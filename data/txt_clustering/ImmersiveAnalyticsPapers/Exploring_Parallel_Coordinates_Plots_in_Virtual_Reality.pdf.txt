ABSTRACT
Parallel Coordinates Plots (PCP) are a widely used approach to interactively visualize and analyze
multidimensional scientific data in a 2D environment. In this paper, we explore the use of Parallel
Coordinates in an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) 3D visualization environment as a means to support
the decision-making process in engineering design processes. We evaluate the potential of VR PCP
using a formative qualitative study with seven participants. In a task involving 54 points with 29
dimensions per point, we found that participants were able to detect patterns in the dataset compared
with a previously published study with two expert users using traditional 2D PCP, which acts as the
gold standard for the dataset. The dataset describes the Pareto front for a three-objective aerodynamic
design optimization study in turbomachinery.

methods have been devised to date to process and analyze large and complex volumes of data. Parallel
Coordinates Plots (PCP) were introduced by Inselberg [8], and the relevant theory has been developed
rigorously since then and presented in great detail by Inselberg [9].Publications involving Parallel Coordi-

nates Plots: According to Heinrich et al. [7]
the number of publications with the term
“parallel coordinates” increased from 14 in the
year 1991 to approximately 543 in 2011, to 5620
in 2012, and to 1680000 as reported by Google
Scholar on the 8th of September 2018.

Dataset: The dataset describes the Pareto
front for a three-objective aerodynamic design
optimization study in turbomachinery.

Hardware setup: The experimental part of the
study was run on a laptop computer with Intel
Core i7-7700K CPU Nvidia GeForce GTX1080
GPU, 32GB RAM, working under Windows 10
Pro 64-bit OS. An Oculus Rift was used to im-
merse users in the VR environment. The inter-
action was facilitated with the help of an Xbox
gamepad controller.

As PCP is so widely used, it was only a matter of time before there would be attempts to recreate
PCP visualizations in 3D. There are many ways in which PCP can be visualized in 3D environments
using standard computer software, and more recently also in immersive environments, such as virtual
reality (VR). Johansson et al. [11] conducted a study that compared existing (at the time) approaches
to 3D visualizations of PCP with a conventional version of 2D PCP and found that 2D PCP was the
preferred solution. However, while many 3D versions of PCP have been explored, only a handful
of them have been using truly immersive environments, such as the one provided with today’s VR
headsets. Even though the 3D setting usually leads to more visual clutter as opposed to the 2D version,
the immersiveness component offered by VR may bring additional benefits for the data manipulation
and understanding.

RELATEDWORK
Researchers have explored 3D versions of PCP for many years. Recently, there have also been some
attempts to use immersive interfaces, such as VR or augmented reality (AR) for 3D PCP visualizations.
For example, Butscher et al. [1] introduce the ART system for collaborative data analysis using
AR-based PCP visualization. Their tool usde an AR headset and an additional multitouch table to
allow users to interact with the plot. Cordeil et al. [3] presented ImAxes that allows interactive
rearrangement of axes according to the user’s needs and simultaneously supports 2D and 3D scatter
plots as well. Rosenbaum et al. [16] discusses benefits and challenges of using immersive interfaces
for abstract data visualizations and provide an example of Immersive Parallel Coordinates (iPC) [16],



which treats the user as part of the visualization itself. Dang et al. [4] proposed a stacking technique
that can be used to denote the grouping or clustering of points overlapping with each other due to the
similar or identical values they represent using various visualization types. They also present a number
of 3D stacked parallel coordinates plots [4]. Moreover, Chang et al. [2] compared PCP with scatter
plot matrices (SPLOMs) and their joined side-by-side 2D view and concluded that, for the majority of
users and some tasks, the latter brought clear advantages over their individual visualizations.

Our implementation is distinct from prior work in the use of interactive cubes to denote the values
for each data item in each dimension. This decision opens a new range of avenues for exploration. For
instance, the glyph characteristic [15] can be used to simultaneously show not only the number of
values but also other information related to the particular dimensions for a subset of, or even all, data
points. Moreover, some of our study participants on their own suggested using a variety of shapes to
differentiate between the selected dimensions as relying solely on color might be insufficient.

VISUALIZATION
To explore PCP in immersive VR we built a visualization system using the Unity game engine. Users
interact with the visualizations using a gamepad Xbox controller. In our version of PCP we have given
our users the ability to adjust the spatial alignment of their virtual workspace by allowing them to
move the elements of the visualization freely in 3D space. In addition, our pattern identification process
has been augmented with the use of 3D scatter plots, which are a natural 3D extension of the 2D
combined design studied by Chang et al. [2]. The 3D scatter plots provide a suitable clustering solution
that allows users to quickly isolate groups of points that are likely to form a pattern. Furthermore,
most of the 3D PCP use some form of translucent parallel planes (see [1, 11]). However, we decided to
use a different approach (Figure 1) to simultaneously minimize the possible effects of occlusion and
cluttering. Moreover, the adopted Cartesian coordinate system (that is, the units and orientations of
the respective axes in 3D space) is the same as for the Unity game engine. Each data item is visualized
as a series of identical evenly spaced unit-sized cubes along the X -axis connected by lines whose
Y -coordinates represent values for each dimension scaled to a chosen range. Every point is shifted in
the Z -axis by a single unit from the previous one, similar to Falkman’s [5] Cube package.
The system also allows the user to make a copy of any selected data items, or a grouping of

data items, and placed in a different position. The copy of the selected items will be generated in a
preconfigured fixed distance towards the direction in which the user is gazing following a tap of a
button on the controller. The design and functionality of the interactive 3D scatter plots was borrowed
from Tadeja et al. [17]. They can be freely moved in 3D space, rotated along any of the three main
axes in 90° intervals (Figure 2) and have very basic, built-in clustering capabilities (Figure 3). Moreover,
all the duplicates, scatter plots and the PCP are interconnected to support the brushing and linking
interaction techniques.



OBSERVATIONAL STUDY
As PCP was designed to deal with complex, multidimensional data, the intended target audience
consists of either experts possessing specialized domain knowledge or users that, at the very least,
are already familiar with the technique. At this early stage we decided to investigate if there are any
advantages in translating PCP to immersive VR and, if there are any potential benefits, which major
bottle-necks or challenges arise as a consequence of translating 2D PCP to 3D VR PCP.

As a consequence, this work studies the system’s efficacy in an observational study with a group of
participants consisting of a mixture of seasoned experts and novice users with regards to conventional
PCP and VR. This method, listed by Lam et al. [14] in their review of common practices for visualization
evaluation methods, relies on an observatory approach rather than quantitative methods. To conduct
the experiment, we used a dataset from Kipouros et al. [13] that contains 54 data items with 29
dimensions per item split into two categories: design parameters (26) and criteria (3). The seven
participants were also asked to self-assess their level of expertise in VR and PCP using a Likert-like
scale and they were all pre-screened with the Ishihara’s tests for color deficiency [10]. Moreover, they
were asked to fill in the simulation sickness questionnaire developed by Kennedy et al. [12] before
and after both the training phase and the experiment phase. They were also instructed to stop if they
developed any of the sickness symptoms.

a number of overlapping points (a). Each

cluster. Selecting any of the points within
a group activates all of them as seen in

tion onto the Parallel Coordinates visual-
ization.

The study consisted of three parts: a short oral instruction and presentation of the PCP, its immersive
adaptation, and details of all the possible interaction techniques (up to 15 minutes), followed by two
experimental sessions, on average 25 minutes for training and 15 minutes in the main study with
approximately a 15-minute break in between. The main task was: choose any two (or more) criteria to
develop the 3D scatter plot and explore it to identify and select a group of points that potentially represent
patterns. Users were also asked to think aloud, that is, discuss what they were doing at the moment
and why, what they wished to achieve and what approach/interaction they were trying to use. Some
of the interaction elements proved to be challenging for first time users of an Xbox controller and
required additional guidance.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Due to the specific nature of the data used in the study, we were predominantly interested in pattern
recognition—(1) which group of points constituted a pattern for the individual participant; and (2) how
many of these patterns was an individual participant able to discover. These findings were later on
compared with the results gathered using the same dataset from Kipouros et al. [13], in which expert
PCP users discovered two patterns containing 11 and 19 data items (which we will from here on denote
as patterns A and B respectively) using traditional 2D PCP. Certain levels of variability were expected
in the data, hence participants were told to take this variability into consideration. However, the final



decision of what constituted a pattern was a decision left to the individual participant. Overall, in
some cases, participants were very close to, or successfully identified the complete pattern A (82%,
82%, 72% and 54% for the four participants that identified pattern A) or B (100%, 84%, 84%, 79% and
79% for the five participants that identified pattern B).Selected comments:

“I think compared to Parallel Coordinates before
(...) it’s better than 2D (..) in that you can see and
identify patterns a bit easier.”

“If there were more minimaps [scatter plots] I
don’t know if I could process (...) I would get
confused”

“That was (...) other side of Parallel Coordinates
that I’ve never seen.”

“I think the initial training session should be
longer (...) especially for people not familiar with
VR”

“(...) is quite immersive. You don’t really feel the
outside (...) as soon as you get the feel of the
controls it’s quite natural. (...) you look around
and you identify where you put your previous
selection, patterns and so on.”

“With the little experience that I have [with 2D]
this was more intuitive”

These differences likely stem from unfamiliarity with the underlying dataset, and in turn influenced
their assessment decision with respect to how much variability was allowed between the values to
be considered as noise and not a meaningful value change. The results indicate that it is possible to
obtain satisfactory results using our implementation of VR-based PCP on a real-world dataset.

User feedback concentrated on three key aspects of the system: PCP, scatter plots and interaction.
Participants seemed to quickly understand which elements constituted a single data item or item
group and they also quickly understood the PCP visualization itself. With regard to scatter plots,
users indicated a preference for fewer plots in order to limit confusion in their analysis.
To improve clarity, in subsequent iterations of the system we signal to the user which exact

dimensions on the PCP were mapped to which axes using textual labels. The scatter plot rotation
seems to be a feature not favored by any of the participants. However, it may be due to the dataset
and bias developed during the training exercise. The simple clustering algorithm has proven to be
surprisingly useful even if some of the participants said they could not understand it. Differentiating
which object in the cluster users want to interact with may be solved by supporting zooming-in into
the cluster structure, or by using a more sophisticated clustering algorithm.

Comments regarding the interaction suggest that participants quickly acquainted themselves with
the implemented movement and maneuvering techniques. When using the gamepad, however, a few
users reported some difficulty. Hence, it may be necessary to either support fewer features or extend
the training session. Distal or cluttered object selection could be augmented with a target acquisition
aid (e.g., Bubble Cursor, Grossman et al. [6]).

The results of the study revealed that the idea of having a useful 3D PCP cannot yet be completely
discarded. This formative qualitative study indicates that VR PCP may be beneficial, or at the very
least, is not obviously detrimental to performance compared with 2D PCP. However, the small-scale
of the study and the fact that participants were not exposed to a standard 2D PCP interface means
it is not possible to conclude that VR PCP would be necessarily more beneficial than 2D PCP. We
conjecture that the differences between VR and 2D PCP are rather nuanced and most likely there are
certain advantages and disadvantages induced by either modality. Future work includes unravelling
these nuances in a set of controlled experiments.
