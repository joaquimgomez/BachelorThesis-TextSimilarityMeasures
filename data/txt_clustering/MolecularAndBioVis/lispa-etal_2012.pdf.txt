Abstract
Close collaboration with other scientific fields is an important goal for the visualization community. Yet engaging
in a scientific collaboration can be challenging. The physical sciences, namely astronomy, chemistry, earth sci-
ences and physics, exhibit an extensive range of research directions, providing exciting challenges for visualization
scientists and creating ample possibilities for collaboration. We present the first survey of its kind that provides a
comprehensive view of existing work on visualization for the physical sciences. We introduce novel classification
schemes based on application area, data dimensionality and main challenge addressed, and apply these classifi-
cations to each contribution from the literature. Our survey helps in understanding the status of current research
and serves as a useful starting point for those interested in visualization for the physical sciences.

1. Introduction and Motivation

In his influential work, Lorensen [Lor04] reflects on the de-
crease in the rate of introduction of new techniques in the
field of visualization. Lorensen warns of the eventual death
of visualization unless proper measures are taken. He advo-
cates a range of measures that can be implemented by the
IEEE Visualization Organizing Committee and by the visu-
alization community. He proposes three main directions in
which the field of visualization could regain a healthy state:
(1) close collaboration with customers can pose challenging
problems and expose our community to new and exciting
application areas, (2) alliances with other fields, especially
computer vision and structural analysis, can generate new
synergies and (3) the identification of some grand challenges
could energize our community.

The first proposition provides the motivation for this sur-
vey. We review application papers on the physical sciences,
classify them in related categories and use the result to iden-
tify fields where visualization has been used extensively and
fields that may benefit from further exploration. Our litera-
ture survey places special emphasis on recent literature as
well as citation rates.

Ertl [Ert10] argues that the field of visualization is flour-
ishing due to the overall growth of the number of submissions
to the main Visualization, Information Visualization and Vi-
sual Analytics conferences, and the recent Visual Analytics
initiatives in the United States and Europe. In discussing the
future of the visualization field, Ertl points out that many
visualization techniques are not usable in practice, due to the
complexity of their application, and that standard datasets

may not be useful for driving research towards relevant ap-
plications.

Ertl’s presentation outlines possible drawbacks of not col-
laborating with application scientists and provides further
motivation for our survey. Physical scientists study many in-
teresting phenomena that pose new and exciting challenges to
visualization researchers. We identify the dimensionality of
the data used to study the underlying phenomena, the main
challenge addressed by each paper in our survey, describe
the novel techniques used to address those challenges and
classify the papers based on data dimensionality and these
challenges.

The main benefits and contributions of this paper are:

1. We review visualization work for the physical sciences
published in the last 10 years.

2. This is the first survey of its kind that provides a com-
prehensive view of existing work on visualization for
the physical sciences.

3. We introduce novel classifications schemes based on
application area, data dimensionality and challenges
addressed, and apply this classification scheme to each
contribution.

4. Our classification helps in understanding the status of
current research by highlighting mature areas in vi-
sualization for the physical sciences and areas where
few solutions have been provided. Collaborations with
domain scientists have the potential to introduce new
problems to the visualization field and can contribute to
its advancement.

This is not simply a list of papers. We also explore and
describe the relationship between papers. Each paper’s con-
tributions are presented in the context of closely related work
following a specific methodology [Lar11].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we define
the scope of the survey in Section (1.1) and we further moti-
vate our paper (Section 1.2); we describe our classifications
(Section 2), we review visualization papers for astronomy
(Section 3), for chemistry (Section 4), for earth sciences
(Section 5) and for physics (Section 6), and we end with
conclusions (Section 8).

1.1. Scope and methodology

This survey reviews visualization papers for the physical sci-
ences. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica [bri10f],
physical sciences study the inorganic world whereas bio-
logical science studies the organic (living) world. Visual-
ization papers on biology are beyond the scope of this pa-
per. Engineering, defined as the application of science to the
conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of human
kind [bri11b], is also beyond the scope of our survey. Physi-

and Supercomputing conferences on physical science appli-
cations.

cal sciences include astronomy, chemistry, physics and earth
sciences.

We do not include flow visualization papers as most are en-
gineering, many are technique rather than application papers
(that is, they solve known problems rather than new problems
so the domain science description is short or non-existent)
and there are already many surveys on flow [MLP*10, PL09,
LHD*04].

Our survey includes application papers rather than tech-
nique papers. Consequently, we include papers that present
background information about a target domain, describe re-
search questions, and in some cases, include a case study
documenting insights found by the users. Although for the
review process, papers are labelled as application or tech-
nique, no such label exists after publication. Consequently,
our decision to categorize a paper as application or technique
is driven by the criteria above.

We review visualization papers on physical sciences pub-
lished at the IEEE Visualization (VIS), EuroVis and Super-
computing (SC) conferences and IEEE Transactions on Visu-
alization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and EG Computer
Graphics Forum (CGF) in the last 9 years (Figure 1). Because
data in the physical sciences have an inherent spatial place-
ment whereas infovis addresses abstract data [vHMM*11,
Tel08], application papers for the physical sciences are not
normally published by the InfoVis conference. This fact is
confirmed by our search through the last 10 years of the
InfoVis proceedings. This does not mean that infovis tech-
niques are not used for research in the physical sciences.
On the contrary, there are many examples of papers where
techniques from both scientific visualization (scivis), that
deal with spatial data, and infovis are used to solve prob-
lems in the physical sciences both in the computer science
[RPW*08, QCX*07, BWH*11] and in the domain specific
[CPB*08, JMS*07, BJJ*07] literature. We also include ref-
erences to survey papers in domain-specific areas [HF11,
KR08, EYD01, Val06].

For consistent paper summaries we incorporate a specific
methodology described by Laramee [Lar11].

1.2. Visualization for the physical sciences

The broad aim of research in the physical sciences is to make
sense of the world around us. That is, to measure quantities
of some physical system, derive a model based upon the re-
sult and then test the model to see whether it can make useful
predictions. The first and last steps usually require the collec-
tion, assimilation and comparison of large quantities of data.
The task of understanding the data and making comparisons
between different but allied data is where the visualization
community has a role, especially given that most physical
systems are three-dimensional and time-dependent. That is
not to say that researchers in the physical sciences are in-
capable of understanding their data on their own—they are,
and if the methods of the visualization community were ex-
plained to them, they could honestly describe themselves as
good practitioners of the subject. Yet, there are many chal-
lenges [Joh04, RK07] which require time and effort, and
pose obstacles that a physical scientist may not wish, nor be
able, to tackle. Off-the-shelf visualization packages, though
a great first step in visualizing data, may fail to meet some
of the challenges listed by Johnson. Even more importantly,
visualizing data in the physical sciences may require do-
main specific knowledge that would be difficult to provide in
a general purpose visualization package. For these reasons
visualization scientists have the opportunity to significantly
influence future discoveries and drive innovation in the phys-
ical sciences.

We view applications as a means to introduce areas with
new problems and new solutions to the visualization commu-
nity. Once a problem is well described and proves important
and challenging, other visualization researchers may study
it without the need for a close collaboration with the ap-
plication scientists. Eventually, significant research is accu-
mulated that handles previously introduced, well described
problems so that those problems can be solved.

Close collaboration with other scientific fields is seen by
leading researchers in visualization [Lor04, Joh04, Ert10,
JMM*06] as an important goal for the visualization commu-
nity. Through these collaborations, the visualization com-
munity can be exposed to exciting new application areas and
can be asked to solve challenging problems. In this way the
visualization community can develop innovative techniques
to solve our customers’ problems and keep the visualization
field vibrant and relevant in the future.

Our survey contributes to this goal by reviewing many re-
cent visualization papers for the physical sciences, by com-
paring and contrasting them, pointing out how they relate
to one another and by classifying them to highlight mature
areas where visualization has made many contributions and
suggest areas where more visualization work can be done.

2. Classifications and Overview

Classifying visualization literature in the physical sciences
is non-trivial given the many sciences covered, the diverse
domain specific knowledge required, and the varied visual-
ization techniques used.

We classify the reviewed papers based on the area of phys-
ical sciences they address: astronomy, physics, chemistry and
earth sciences. Given that each of these broad areas is divided
into many different fields and sub-fields, and that some of
these fields are overlapping, papers can be classified in more
than one area. For instance, molecular dynamics visualization
papers might be classified as chemistry or biology, depending
on the nature of the molecules under consideration.

We have two goals for our classifications: (1) We want
to provide a quick but comprehensive picture of the main
contribution of each paper and (2) we want to present the
state of current research, which may in turn help in deciding
a future research direction.

A typical classification of visualization techniques [Tel08]
(scalar, vector, tensor, . . .) fails to fulfill these goals. On
one hand, most of the papers reviewed visualize scalar data,
which means that we would not get a good distribution among
categories. On the other hand, the fact that many papers use
scalar visualization techniques does not necessarily mean
that these techniques should not be used to visualize data in
the future.

We provide two alternate classifications of the literature.
We categorize the literature based on data dimensionality
and the generic main challenge they address [Joh04]. These
challenges highlight the main contribution of the paper and
convey useful information about the work (such as mak-
ing use of ‘graphics hardware’ or using ‘feature detection’)
not available in other visualization taxonomies (see Ward
et al. [WGK10] for a summary of existing visualization tax-
onomies). If the data studied covers more than one dimen-
sion, we choose the higher dimension for classification. If
a paper addresses more than one challenge, we choose the
main challenge addressed by the paper. We present a short
description of challenges addressed by papers in our survey;
see the work by Johnson [Joh04] for a detailed description
of these and other major visualization challenges.

1. Multi-field visualization. Often physical data contains
several attributes for the same point in space. The ability
to effectively visualize multiple fields simultaneously so
that it facilitates the analysis of the relations and corre-
lations between those fields is the goal in this category.

2. Feature detection. Modern sensors and computers pro-
duce and store data measured in giga to terabytes in size.
Locating features of interest in these vast amounts of
data, representing them and tracking the evolution of
features in time and/or space are the main goals in this
category.

3. Graphics hardware. Scientific data may be too large
to process and render in real time. The papers in this cat-
egory propose novel ways to use the available graphics
hardware (GPUs) to address these challenges.

4. Modelling and Simulation. Visualization application
papers are defined by the fact that they solve domain
specific problems and use domain specific knowledge.
We include in this category papers that use the science
in their respective fields to model, simulate and visu-
alize physical phenomena, for which advanced domain
knowledge is needed. This category is more specific
than the original Johnson challenge ‘think about the
science’ which should apply to all application papers.

5. Scalable visualization. The large amounts of data anal-
ysed by scientists can be challenging on several levels:
data may be too large to read, process or visualize at in-
teractive speeds. Papers in this category use algorithms
that take advantage of available (parallel) I/O, process-
ing and visualization resources to produce scalable vi-
sualizations that are able to visualize larger datasets
as the amount of resources is increased. We define this
challenge similarly to Chen et al. [CHHK11]. This is an
extension of the original Johnson challenge ‘scalable,
distributed and grid-based visualization’ as it includes
visualization papers that address any of the challenges
created by large data: I/O, processing and visualization,
whereas the original Johnson challenge focuses on the
last one.

6. Error/uncertainty visualization. Acquisition or sim-
ulation errors/uncertainty are part of the data analysed
by physical scientists. In addition, errors are introduced
by data transformation (through resampling, filtering,
quantization and rescaling) and visualization [JS03].
The main focus for papers in this category is integra-
tion of error visualization into the main visualization of
data.

7. Time-dependent visualization. A common way of vi-
sualizing time-dependent data is by rendering a frame
for each time step and assembling those frames in a
video. Papers in this category aim to address the main
drawback of presenting time-dependent visualizations
through a video: the inability to engage in interactive
exploration of the data.

8. Global/local visualization (details within context).
The techniques in this category aim to integrate a visu-
alization of the whole data required for navigation and
a global understanding of the phenomenon described
with selection and detailed visualization of sub-sets of
interest.

9. Comparative visualization. Comparative visualiza-
tion refers to the process of understanding how data
from different sources are similar or different [VfETV,
PP95]. Such analysis can happen at different levels:
image, data, derived quantities and methodology lev-
els. The two sources can be compared by using two
visualization images shown side by side, superimposed

or as two symmetrical halves (image level); directly
comparing the available data fields (data level); com-
paring derived quantities such as features in the data
(derived quantities level) or quantifying the differences
in experiment, simulation or visualization parameters
(methodology level).

Other major visualization challenges discussed in [Joh04],
but not included in our survey are: ‘Perceptual Issues’,
‘Human–computer interaction’, ‘Integrated scientific and in-
formation visualization’, ‘Visual abstractions’ and ‘Theory
of visualization’. Some of these challenges (perceptual is-
sues, quantify effectiveness, human-computer interaction,
visual abstractions and theory of visualization) are mostly
addressed by papers not associated with a physical science
or (integrated scientific and information visualization) are
too abstract to be used to define a main challenge of a pa-
per. Comparative visualization challenge is not in the list
presented by Johnson [Joh04], however, it is the focus of a
paper in our review and is identified as a technique needed
by application scientists by a major visualization research
initiative [VfETV].

Table 1 presents an overview and classification of visu-
alization work on the physical sciences. Papers are grouped
by domain along the columns and by the temporal and spa-
tial dimensionality of data along the rows. Entries are also
ordered chronologically within each sub-group. This table
highlights the dimensionality of the data for which most of
the surveyed work has been done.

Table 2 presents an alternate classification for visualization
work for the physical sciences. Papers are grouped by domain
along the columns and by the main challenge or contribution
along rows. Each entry is coloured according to the tempo-
ral and spatial dimensionality of the data. Entries are also
ordered chronologically within each sub-group. This table
highlights the main challenge addressed by each work, and
provides a starting point for exploring areas of future work.

We review a number of solutions designed to address the
multi-field visualization challenge. Multi-field 2D data is
visualized using a field [LFH08] or using time [YXG*10]
as a third dimension. Multi-field 3D data is visualized us-
ing glyphs and a variation in the glyph colour [SIG05] or
shape [CFG*05, BvL06, JKM06, DMB*06, MDHB*07],
using trajectories, vector glyphs or surfaces together with
volume rendering [SYS*06, JCSB03], parallel coordinates
[QCX*07] or multiple-linked views and brushing [CFG*05,
KLM*08].

Auralization is the technique of creating audible sound
files from numerical data [Vor08]. Perception of sound de-
pends on many parameters such as the type of source, di-
rection of sound, source movement, listener movement and
environment. Auralization is used to enhance visualization
of multi-field data by mapping various fields to sound and

source characteristics [SB04]. Although this is an appealing
idea, many challenges remain, such as meaningful mapping
between field values and sounds, generating pleasant sounds
and the speed of processing.

Realistic visualization of physical phenomena use multi-
field data from simulation or acquired through non-visual
means and aim to visualize this data in a visually accurate
way. Examples include: visualization of storm and cloud
scale simulation data [REHL03]—these visualizations ap-
peal to metheorologists, who are trained to extract infor-
mation about a forming storm through visual observation;
visualizations of hot fluids discharges from seafloor vents
acquired using sonar scans—these visualizations may be
used for comparison with data acquired with video cameras
[SBS*04]; or visualizations of nebula’s dependence on view-
point and dust distribution [MHLH05]—these visualizations
can be used for producing scientifically accurate animations
for educational purposes or for exploring the visual effects
of changing a nebula’s physical parameters.

Papers that present feature detection as their main goal are
varied. Locating important features within the data requires
domain-specific knowledge. We review techniques that ex-
amine structures defined by intercluster galaxies [MQF06]
and visualize the build-up regions of ionized gas around the
first stars [NJB07]. We survey papers that detect anomalous
structures in molecular dynamics simulation data [MHM*04]
or in nematic liquid crystals [MJK06, SPL*06], visualize
optical power flow through nano-apertures around critical
points [SBSH04], determine the topology of a toroidal mag-
netic field [SCT*10, TGS11], determine states of energy
minima and represents relationship between these states in a
chemical system [BWH*11], calculate the lines that separate
rocks with different mineral densities or porosity character-
istics [PGT*08], identify regions in the atmosphere which
can act as indicators for climate change [JBMS09], calculate
paths of molecules to possible binding sites [LBH11] and
detect mesoscale eddies in an ocean simulation [WHP*11].
Three papers approach both feature detection and feature
tracking: Bidmon et al. [BGB*08] track and visualize the
paths of solvent molecules, Krone et al. [KFR*11] track pro-
tein cavities and Laney et al. [LBM*06] identify and track the
surfaces separating a heavy fluid placed on top of a light fluid.

Most papers that use graphics hardware (GPUs) are from
chemistry or physics and visualize molecules [BDST04,
RE05, TCM06, GRDE10], molecular surfaces [KBE09,
LBPH10], or quantum chemistry simulations [QEE*05,
JV09]. In physics, Grave et al. [GMDW09] visualize the
Gödel universe, Müller [MGW10] presents computer simu-
lations exploring the special theory of relativity and Laney
et al. [LCM*05] describe a hardware accelerated simulation
of radiographs.

Papers in the modelling and simulation category make
use of domain specific knowledge to model, simulate and

visualize physical phenomena. We review simulations of
sound reflection and refraction within a room [BDM*05,
LCM07b, CLT*08, BMD*08, DBM*06] and works that
model and visualize theories of general and special relativ-
ity[WBE*05], the Gödel universe [GB08], planetary nebula
[MKDH04] and the molecular skin surface [CS04, CS05].
These papers take advantage of advanced domain knowl-
edge and/or close collaboration with the physical scientists
to advance the science in the physical and visualization fields.

Works in the scalable visualization category address I/O,
processing and/or visualization challenges caused by large
data. Solutions include a remote hardware-accelerated visu-
alization farm [QMK*06], a public-resource climate mod-
elling [SFW04], adjusting the frequency of the output from
the simulation based on application and resource dynam-
ics [MNV10], using parallel I/O and query-driven visual-
ization [KGH*09, RPW*08], using parallel I/O [YMW04]
and parallel visualization [MSB*03, YMW04] and design-
ing all components of the simulation pipeline (problem de-
scription, solver and visualization) so that they execute with
shared data structures and no intermediate I/O [TYRG*06].
Fraedrich et al. [FSW09] visualize large particle-based cos-
mological simulations using a multi-resolution hierarchy and
techniques designed to reduce disk and display limitations
produced by the large data.

Li et al. [LFLH07] present tools and techniques for visu-
alizing error and uncertainty in large scale astrophysical
environments and Sanyal et al. [SZD*10] visualize the un-
certainty associated with weather prediction.

Two papers address the time-dependent visualization
challenge. Drocourt et al. [DBS*11] present a radial visu-
alization using nested rings to show the evolution in the tem-
poral dimension, whereas Lipşa et al. [LLCD11] address the
large fluctuations in attribute values by computing the aver-
age of values for a time window behind the current time step.

There is one paper that has as its main challenge
global/local visualization (details within context). Li et al.
[LFH06] present a set of techniques to facilitate travel and
context acquisition in an astronomic virtual environment. Of-
ten papers [KLM*08, CFG*05, LFH08, YXG*10, RPW*08]
that visualize multi-field data include multiple linked views
and interactive brushing which can show both a context and a
focus view. Global/local visualization is, however, secondary
in these cases.

There is one paper [DBM*06] that focuses on compara-
tive visualization of two different approaches for acoustic
simulation.

The next sections review visualization papers for astron-
omy, chemistry, earth sciences, and physics. Note that, to
address space limitation, we only include full summaries for
a subset of the reviewed papers. Papers that include a full
summary are indicated with a star next to their citation.

3. Astronomy

Astronomy is the science of the entire universe, which in-
cludes the study of planets, stars, galaxies, nebula and inter-
stellar medium. Astronomy and physics are linked through
cosmological theories based on the theory of relativity
[bri10a].

This section includes papers that describe visualizations of
nebula [MKDH04]∗, [MHLH05]∗ and a paper that presents
an auralization of cosmological explosions [SB04]∗. In-
cluded are papers that visualize inter-cluster regions in-
side galaxy clusters [MQF06]∗, present an interactive explo-
ration of the visible universe [LFH06], visualize uncertainty
in astrophysical data [LFLH07], visualize the formation of
the first stars [NJB07], visualize multi-wavelength sky data
[LFH08]∗ and cosmological simulations studying matter dis-
tribution in the universe [FSW09].

For further reading on the current state-of-the-art of visu-
alization in astronomy and future directions for visualization
see Hassan and Fluke [HF11], Kapferer and Riser [KR08]
and Goodman [Goo12].

The visible universe spans a huge range of distances, and
contains mostly empty space. These characteristics make it
difficult for users to navigate and gain understanding of posi-
tion and orientation in a virtual environment simulation of the
visible universe. Li et al. [LFH06] present a set of techniques
to facilitate travel and context acquisition in an astronomic
virtual environment (Figure 2).

Navigation and object representation in the multi-scale
universe is done using power spatial scalling [FH07]. This
technique scales the entire Universe’s data relative to the cur-

rent view scale. The authors use a 3D compass for orientation
reference and annotated 3D landmarks for context. They use
a cube, cylinder or sphere as power cues to show the current
image scale, and use an edge which fades in when an object
is close to the viewpoint as a proximity cue. Li et al. [LFH06]
use a slice of the sky flattened into a 2D chart and a map of
the entire universe scaled logarithmically relative to a certain
view scale as an overview map. Li et al. [LFH06] extend
their previous work [FH07] with techniques that facilitate
travel and context understanding in an astronomic virtual
environment. The phenomena studied is 3D, static and the
main challenge is global/local visualization (details within
context).

Li et al. [LFLH07] present tools and techniques for visual-
izing uncertainty in large scale astrophysical environments.
These techniques raise awareness and comprehension of the
large positional uncertainty that exists in astrophysical data.
This uncertainty in spatial quantities such as distance and
velocity is caused by the limited precision of the standard
astronomic measurements of parallax, proper motion, and
radial velocity. Presented tools for visualizing uncertainty in-
clude: a unified colour coding scheme for log-scale distances
and percentage uncertainty, an ellipsoid model to represent
together angular and positional uncertainty, an ellipsoid en-
velope to show trajectory uncertainty and, a magic lens to
expose additional properties in the lens areas and to select
only objects satisfying certain uncertainty criteria. Li et al.
[LFLH07] extend their previous work [LFH06, FH07] by
adding uncertainty visualization to the presented astrophys-
ical visualization tools. The algorithms presented processes
3D, static data and the main challenge is representing error
and uncertainty.

Navrátil et al. [NJB07] describe visualizations used to ex-
amine a simulation of the formation of the first stars. Their
visualizations capture the build-up and growth of bubbles
of gas around the first stars which provides insight into the
evolution of the early universe and guides future telescope
observations. The authors use numerical simulation [SH02,
SYW01], which involves 3D evolution of dark matter and
gas coupled by gravity and radiation-hydrodynamics calcu-
lations, to study how the universe evolved from a simple
homogeneous initial state through the formation of the first
stars. The simulation produces particle data which is inter-
polated to the vertices of a regular grid using work by Jensen
et al. [Jen96, JC98]. This interpolation method controls the
number of particles used in the interpolation using both an in-
clusion distance for particles around the interpolation point
and a maximum number of particles that are used in the
interpolation. The resulting regular grid is imported into Par-
aView to extract isosurfaces and to smooth them. The authors
use colour to differentiate between isosurfaces representing
hydrogen density, molecular density and ionized molecules.
They use transparency to show surface overlap. The isosur-
faces show the build-up and growth of bubbles of either ion-
ized gas or hot, heavy element-enriched gas. Simulation data

is 3D and time-dependent. The main challenge addressed by
the paper is feature representation where the features are the
gas bubbles represented using isosurfaces.

Fraedrich et al. [FSW09] explore scalability limitations in
the visualization of large particle-based cosmological simu-
lations and present techniques to work around limitations on
current PC architectures. The authors address memory size
and bandwidth limitations by using a multi-resolution hierar-
chy exploiting octrees, storing several tree nodes in a single
disk page, culling particles that fall on the same pixel on
the screen, discarding particles depending on their density
contribution and using attribute compression. The authors
use asynchronous I/O and pre-fetching to reduce disk access
latency impact on performance. The authors use a vertex
array buffer to store data on the GPU and a vertex shader
to render the data. Particle data from a cosmological sim-
ulation is rendered in software by Dolag et al. [DRGI08].
Multi-resolution point splatting techniques are presented by
Hopf and Ertl [HE03], Hopf et al. [HLE04] and Szalay et al.
[SSL08]. The authors augment these techniques with out-
of-core rendering and present an approach that is able to
interactively visualize particle data exceeding 10 billion ele-
ments. Simulation data is 3D, static and the main challenge
is scalable visualization.

4. Chemistry

Chemistry is concerned with the properties and structure of
substances, the transformations they undergo and the energy
exchanged during these processes. Physics studies the struc-
ture and behaviour of individual atoms whereas chemistry
studies properties and reactions of molecules [bri10b].

See Valle [Val06] for a project that surveys chemistry visu-
alization tools and methods and collects scientists’ feedback
on them. See Visualizing Chemistry [otNA06] for a review of
the current state of the art in chemistry imaging techniques.
This book has a concluding chapter with grand challenges
and discussion of visualization and domain specific problems
where the visualization community could help.

4.1. Nanotechnology

Nanotechnology is the manipulation of atoms, molecules
and materials to form structures at nanometer scales. These
structures typically have new properties differing from the
building blocks due to quantum mechanics. Nanotechnology
is an interdisciplinary field involving physics, chemistry, bi-
ology, material science and many engineering disciplines.
The word nanotechnology refers to both the science and the
engineering of the field [bri10e].

Included in our survey are contributions that visualize the
formation of nanoparticles in turbulent flows [SIG05]∗, and
that present a web-based nanotechnology visualization tool
[QMK*06].

Qiao et al. [QMK*06] describe the design and inte-
gration of a novel remote visualization framework into
the nanoHUB.org, a science gateway for nanotechnology
education and research. Users run simulations on super-
computing resources and use remote hardware accelerated
graphics for visualization from within a web browser. The
authors created nanoVIS, a visualization engine library that
can handle a variety of nanoscience visualizations involv-
ing vector flows and multi-variate scalar fields. This engine
acts as the server end of the remote visualization and runs
on a Linux cluster equipped with hardware acceleration. A
VNC [RSFWH98] session uses the nanoVIS library to pro-
duce visualizations which are then transmitted over the Inter-
net. The Rapid Application Infrastructure (Rappture) Toolkit
[McL05] is used to generate the user interface for running
a simulation and visualizing results. The nanoVIS visualiza-
tion engine uses work by Qiao et al. [QEE*05] for visualiza-
tion of multi-variate scalar fields using texture-based volume
rendering and work by Kolb et al. [KLRS04] and Krüger
et al. [KKKW05] for vector field visualization. The data
that can be processed by the system is 3D, time-dependent,
multi-variate scalar and vector data and the main challenge
is scalable visualization.

4.2. Physical chemistry

Physical chemistry is concerned with measuring, corelat-
ing and explaining the quantitative aspects of chemical pro-
cesses, rather than being focused on classes of materials
that share common structural and chemical features. Modern
physical chemistry does this using a quantum mechanical
model of atomic and molecular structure [bri10b].

This section presents works focusing on visualizations of
quantum chemistry simulations [QEE*05], [JV09]∗.

Quantum dots (QDs) are nano-scale structures that can
confine a small number of free electrons in a small space and
allow control over the number of electrons and their excita-
tion energy (i.e. material properties). This leads to promising
applications such as infrared detectors, lasers with tunable
wave-lengths, high-density low energy consumption mem-
ory chips, and logical gates for quantum computing. Qiao
et al. [QEE*05] describe a method and system for visual-
izing data from quantum dot simulations (QDs) which is in
the form of two Face-Centreded Cubic lattices (FCC). The
described hardware-accelerated volume rendering approach
and application (Figure 3) allows scientists to interactively
visualize, navigate and query QD simulations.

Decomposing the FCC lattice can result in an enormous
number of tetrahedra, which makes rendering multi-million
atom simulations difficult. The authors achieve interactivity
by using a 3D texturing approach with a logarithmic trans-
fer function. The software can also render multiple fields at
once, and perform simple GPU statistical calculations on the
selected data through the use of fragment shaders to obtain

tum Dot device in the third excited state, showing S and s*

more criteria and b) the percentage contribution of orbitals
to the total electron cloud. It builds on the approach of Rober
et al. [RHEM03] for BCC (body-Centreded cubic) grids and
Westerman and Ertl’s work on 3D texturing [WE98], and per-
forms queries using the techniques of Buck et al. [BFH*04]
and Krüger and Westermann [KW05]. The dimensionality of
the data is 3D, static, multi-attribute, uniform resolution on
a non-cartesian lattice and the main challenge is using the
GPU for volume rendering multi-variate wave functions.

4.3. Organic chemistry

Organic chemistry studies the correlation between the physi-
cal and chemical properties of substances with their structural
features. This has great applicability to the design and syn-
thesis of novel molecules with some desired properties. Most
visualization for organic chemistry show the 3D structure of
molecules [bri10b].

We survey papers that visualize molecules [BDST04,
TCM06], molecular surfaces [CS04, CS05, KBE09,
LBPH10], paths of molecules to possible binding sites
[LBH11], visualize and track protein cavities[KFR*11]
and the solvent pathlines near them [BGB*08]∗, detect
anomalous structures in molecular dynamics simulation data
[MHM*04], determine states of energy minima and repre-
sents relationship between these states in a chemical system
[BWH*11].

Transformation in chemical systems can be studied by
considering its energy as a function of the coordinates of
the system’s components. These energy functions are high-
dimensional and chemists lack effective visualization tech-
niques to handle them. Beketayev et al. [BWH*11] develop
a new technique that enables this analysis. The system com-
bines concepts from topological analysis, multi-dimensional
scaling and graph layout to produce a visualization of the

energy function that focuses on the energy minima (stable
states) of the system and their relationships to each other. The
closest related work is that of Flamm et al. [FHSS07] and
Okushima et al. [ONIS09] on topological analysis in chem-
istry, and that of Gerber et al. [GBPW10] on visual analysis
for chemistry. Simulation data is 3D, time-dependent, uni-
form and the main challenge is feature detection where the
features are states of energy minima and the relationships
between these states.

Bajaj et al. [BDST04] describe both an application that
uses the GPU to accelerate 3D image-based rendering of
molecular structures at varying levels of detail, and an alter-
native approach to interactive molecular exploration using
both volumetric and structural rendering together to discover
molecular properties. Their approach results in an order of
magnitude speedup over traditional triangle based rendering
and enables visualization of large and previously intractable
molecules. Using NVIDIA’s Cg, the authors extend imposter
rendering from spheres to cylinders and helices in their Tex-
Mol application. They also implement volumetric visualiza-
tion using 3D texture mapping, and enable multiple views
(structural and volumetric) to be displayed and linked to-
gether. Their use of graphics hardware allows the rendering
to approach interactive frame-rates. The structural renderer
used in this work was described previously in The Cg Tuto-
rial [FK03]. The view-dependent texture mapping techniques
are described in work by Debevec et al. [DYB98]. The phe-
nomena being studied is 3D, static and the main challenge
is using graphics hardware for rendering regular curved sur-
faces encountered in molecular visualization.

Mehta et al. [MHM*04] seek to detect anomalous (non-
ideal) structures in silicon substances. They propose a method
to automatically generate a salient iso-value that can discrim-
inate the anomalous structures. This is used to generate both
a surface visualization and volume rendering of the data.
The salient iso-surface is obtained by (i) generating a his-
togram of the electron density scalar field, (ii) smoothing
the histogram using a Gaussian kernel, (iii) applying FFT,
(iv) convolving with a band-pass filter to amplify the high
frequency component and (v) applying an inverse Fourier
transform to obtain the enhanced histogram. The histogram
bins where the curvature of the histogram is large are taken
as the salient values. These values are averaged to obtain the
salient iso-value which is used to generate both an isosurface
and volume rendering of the data. The anomaly detection can
be achieved through data processing techniques alone such as
through common neighbour analysis (CNA) [CJ93] or solely
visualization [VBJM*95]. This paper uses a mixture of the
two. Simulation data is 3D, static, uniform resolution, regular
grid and scalar data and the main challenge is feature detec-
tion where the features of interest are anomalous structures
in silicon substances.

Cheng et al. [CS04] present a new skin model of molecules
that are calculated directly from a van der Waals force model.

The challenge is to create skin mesh models that are of good
quality, provably correct, fast to compute and algorithmi-
cally convergent. Their approach is to use an advancing front
surface method that constructs a Restricted Delaunay Trian-
gulation over the model surfaces. However, when advancing
triangles, sometimes they may overlap which causes robust-
ness problems. They overcome this challenge through com-
puting a Morse–Smale complex to simplify the topological
changes. Further, to achieve a homeomorphic mesh with high
quality they reduce the size of the triangles to be proportional
to the radius of the maximum principle curvature of the sur-
face. The Marching Cubes algorithm [LC87] can achieve
topological surfaces at high speed but the surface elements
are not necessarily homeomorphic to the original surface.
Similar to this work, Stander et al. [SH05] track the crit-
ical points of the implicit function by Morse Theory and
Amenta et al. [ACDL00] generate a homeomorphic mesh,
but each method can create bad shape triangles having ex-
treme sharp or obtuse angles. Data processed is 3D, static,
uniform resolution—but the size of triangles is determined
by the curvature, no explicit grid and scalar data. The main
focus of the paper is mesh generation for a new skin model
of molecules.

Cheng et al. [CS05] present a surface triangulation algo-
rithm that generates a mesh for the molecular skin model
[Ede99]. This is the first robust algorithm that is capable of
generating a mesh with guaranteed lower bound on the mini-
mum angle of each triangle in the surface mesh. The authors
employ a Delaunay-based method to generate a mesh for the
molecular skin model incrementally. They add one sample
point each time and maintain the Delaunay triangulation of
the sample points with the incremental flipping algorithm
[Law77]. They extract a subset of the Delaunay triangulation
as a candidate surface triangles. These candidate surface tri-
angles guide the future point sampling. This procedure is ap-
plied iteratively until it obtains a �-sampling of the molecular
skin surface. This algorithm provides better efficiency than
work by Cheng et al. [CDES01] and more robustness than
work by Cheng and Shi [CS04]. The algorithms presented
handle 3D, static data and the main challenge is generating a
mesh for a molecular surface model.

Tarini et al. [TCM06] present a set of techniques to en-
hance the real-time visualization of molecules using the
space-fill and the balls-and-sticks approaches. These tech-
niques enhance the user’s understanding of the 3D shape
of molecules while they maintain real-time rendering speed.
Tarini et al. use impostors to render the two types of prim-
itives in molecule visualization: spheres and cylinders. The
impostors are procedural, which means that all geometric
attributes are synthesized in the GPU. The authors integrate
additional ways of enhancing the images’ visual quality in-
cluding depth aware contour lines as in work by Deussen
et al. [DS00] and halo effects as in work by Luft et al.
[LCD06]. Tarini et al. implement ambient occlusion [Lan02]
using a similar approach with work by Sarletu et al. [SK04]

the temperature factor of the protein. [KBE09]. Image cour-
tesy of Thomas Ertl.

and by Pharr [PG04]. The techniques described handle 3D,
static, unstructured grid data. The main challenge is using
the GPU to maintain real-time rendering speed while en-
hancing the user’s understanding of the 3D shape of large
molecules.

Krone at al. [KBE09] present an approach for visualizing
the solvent excluded surface (SES) of proteins using a GPU
ray-casting technique. They achieve interactive frame rates
even for long protein trajectories and thus enable analysis of
time-dependent molecular simulations (Figure 4). The sur-
face of molecules is important for studying protein-protein or
protein-ligand interactions or for exploration of phenomena
which occur at the surface, such as binding sites or hydropho-
bic and hydrophilic regions.

The ReducedSurface (RS) [SOS98] is used to render
the SES because it can be computed fast and it can
be efficiently updated piecewise between two consecutive
timesteps. Krone et al. [KBE09] use acceleration techniques
to achieve interactive frame rates for rendering long trajecto-
ries. First, they filter out unwanted protein motion [Kab76]
and second they reduce the raw atomic data [BHI*07].
The authors use several visualization techniques for en-
hanced protein analysis: utilize various standard colouring
schemes, enable better depth perception using linear distance
fog or depth darkening [LCD06] and enable better percep-
tion of shape using depth dependent silhouettes. Connolly
[Con83] presents the equations to compute SES analytically.
Sanner et al. [SOS98] develops the Reduced Surface which
accelerates the computation of SES. Chavent et al. [CLM08]
present a related visualization application of a GPU ray-
casting of the Molecular Skin Surface. This works improves
on available molecular viewers in two ways. First it requires
less memory because it uses GPU ray-casting as opposed

to polygon based rendering. Second, it dynamically updates
the SES and thus it enables analysis of arbitrary large molec-
ular simulation trajectories. The algorithms presented pro-
cess 3D, time-dependent, scalar, unstructured, multi-attribute
data. The main challenge is utilizing the GPU to raycast the
implicit mathematical description of the SES.

Lindow et al. [LBPH10] present ways to accelerate the
construction and the rendering of the solvent excluded
surface (SES) and the molecular skin surface (MSS) which
are used in visualizing the dynamic behaviour of molecules.
This is important to domain scientists as the function of
a biomolecule is driven to a large extent by its 3D shape.
The authors propose using the contour-buildup algorithm
[TA96] for building SES because it is easy and efficient to
parallelize. They adapt the approximate Voronoi diagram
algorithm [VBW94] for computing MSS. This algorithm
was originally used to compute SES. Molecule surfaces are
directly visualized on the GPU similarly to Krone et al.
[KBE09] and Chavent et al. [CLM08]. The main reason for
improvements in the rendering of the SES surface is the use
of tight-fitting bounding quadrangles as rasterization prim-
itives. Improvements in MSS rendering speed are caused
by using tight-fitting bounding quadrangles for the convex
spherical patches, using 3D polyhedra instead of mixed cells
of MetaMol [CLM08] and removing empty mixed cells
already on the CPU. The authors accelerate the constructions
and rendering of SES and MSS which improves on work
by Krone et al. [KBE09] and Chavent et al. [CLM08],
respectively. The results are demonstrated on 3D, time-
dependent data. The main challenge is efficiently utilizing
the GPU to raycast the algebraic surfaces that compose SES
and MSS.

Lindow et al. [LBH11] focus on the challenge of com-
puting and visualizing molecular binding sites and paths
leading to these sites. These paths can help in understand-
ing molecular interactions which is key to answering many
open questions in biochemistry and biology. As part of their
interactive visualization, advanced shading, rendering and
lighting methods are utilized to make features of interest,
such as deeply embedded paths, more visible and prominent
to the user. The paths are computed based on a Vornoi di-
agram of spheres from the van der Waals spheres for the
molecule. The significant paths are determined by filtering
the topology graph from the Vornoi diagram based on five
factors: radius, regular branches, edges, cycles and duplicate
branches. The user is then able to select particular paths of
interest and explore the molecule with the interactive visual-
ization. In computing the Vornoi diagram, the authors used
the method of Gavrilova et al. [GR03]. For edge tracing in the
Vornoi diagram of spheres, the authors used methods from
Kim et al. [KCK05] with further techniques from Cho et al.
[CKL*06]. The methods presented process 3D, static, scalar,
unstructured, multi-attribute data. The main challenge is fea-
ture detection where the features are the paths of molecules
to possible binding sites.

Krone et al. [KFR*11] present a method for interactive
extraction and tracking of cavities within time-varying pro-
tein data. In molecular dynamics, identifying cavities in pro-
teins in substrates is important: these cavities can often be
found close to the active centre of the protein. If the cav-
ities open up to the environment by reaching the surface
of the protein, then the active site is made accessible to
the surrounding substrate which is essential for certain re-
actions. Existing tools only work for static snapshots and
do not operate in real-time which means they do not al-
low the exploration of time-dependent structural changes.
A steerable visualization interface is provided: the simula-
tion data is shown in 3D, and cavities can be selected and
tracked via a 2D slice. For the 3D view, the authors use
an SPH-like technique to obtain a continuous density vol-
ume which is visualized by ray-casting. A Region Grow-
ing algorithm computes the cavity size which is then shown
graphically on screen. Existing tools dealing with this type
of data include CAVER[POB*06], PocketPicker[WPS*07]
and MOLE[PKKO07]. The presented methods work on 3D,
time-dependent scalar, unstructured grid. The main challenge
is protein cavities detection and tracking.

5. Earth Sciences

We take Earth Sciences to include geology, hydrology and
atmospheric sciences [bri10d]. It includes the study of water,
both underground, in rivers and oceans, and in ice-caps and
glaciers; of phenomena associated with the atmosphere and
climate; and of the physical and chemical structure of the
earth and its history.

5.1. Atmospheric sciences

Atmospheric sciences deal with the properties, structure and
composition of the atmosphere, understanding atmospheric
phenomena such as clouds, fog and dew, and understanding
and predicting the weather.

We present research to visualize storm and cloud-scale
simulation data [REHL03]∗, to visualize warm rain for-
mation and compare weather models with radar obser-
vation [SYS*06]∗, to analyse air pollution [QCX*07],
to visualize the uncertainty associated with weather pre-
diction[SZD*10]∗, and to simulate and visualize cy-
clones[MNV10].

Qu et al. [QCX*07] present weather data visualization to
analyse air pollution in Hong Kong. They visualize attributes
describing air quality and they allow the exploration of cor-
relations between these attributes. Wind speed and direction
are the primary attributes driving the exploration of other
attributes that describe air quality, such as concentration of
various chemicals in the air. Qu et al. [QCX*07] use a polar
coordinate system to show the correlation of an attribute with
wind speed and direction, with the values of the attributes
shown using a colour map. A sector of interest can be selected
from the polar coordinate display. A pixel bar chart [KHD02]

is shown that depicts three additional attributes (axes X, Y
and colour) for a certain wind direction and speed. Data can
be explored using parallel coordinates [ID90]. A correlation
coefficient [QCX*07] detects linear dependencies between
attributes for normally distributed data and a weighted com-
plete graph is used to show this correlation. Work by Barnes
and Hut [BH86] and Noack [Noa05] is used to draw a graph
in which the distance between nodes reflects the strength of
the correlation. The correlation is also encoded in the width
of the edges of the graph. The weighted complete graph can
be used to reorder the axes of the parallel coordinates visu-
alization such that highly correlated attributes are close to-
gether. This paper uses and adapts standard techniques such
as polar coordinates, colour-mapping, parallel coordinates
and pixel bar charts to visualizing air quality measures in
Hong Kong and exploring their correlation. The phenomena
being studied is 2D, time-dependent, scalar, multi-attribute
on a unstructured grid. The main challenge addressed by the
paper is multi-field visualization.

Malakar et al. [MNV10] present an adaptive framework
that performs cyclone simulations and remote online visual-
ization as part of a system in which the frequency of the out-
put from the simulation is adjusted based on application and
resource dynamics. The goal is to enable continuous progress
in the simulation and to maximize temporal resolution in vi-
sualization, taking into account limitations in storage and net-
work capacities. The implementation uses a software layer
to determine the number of processors to be used for sim-
ulation and the frequency of output of climate data based
on the network bandwidth, the free disk space and the res-
olution of the climate simulation. The authors describe two
algorithms for processor allocation: a greedy algorithm that
tries to maximize the simulation rate and an optimization-
based approach that attempts to provide a steady-state sim-
ulation and visualization rate. The greedy algorithm makes
decisions to reduce or increase the number of simulation pro-
cessors for free disk space equal to 10%, 25% and 50% of
the total disk space. The optimization-based approach uses
linear programming to determine the number of processors
for simulation and the frequency for output. Two solutions
have previously been proposed for online visualization of
numerical simulations—i.e. performing the visualization at
the same time as the simulation so as to avoid storing the sim-
ulation output for all the time steps. First, there is a tightly
coupled execution of the simulation and visualization com-
ponents [TYRG*06, MWYT07, Ma09], where simulation is
followed by visualization on the same set of processors. The
drawback here is that the simulation component is generally
more compute-intensive than the visualization, which means
that visualization results are produced after a considerable
delay. A second solution[EGH*06] uses shared memory for
communication between simulation and visualization which
requires a large amount of shared memory to service both
sets of demands. Weather simulation data is 2D and time-
dependent with adaptive-resolution. The main challenge is
scalable visualization.

5.2. Climatology

Climatology[bri10c] is concerned with climate differences
between different regions and climate changes over long pe-
riods of time. Climatologists seek to identify slow-acting
influences on weather and to identify the consequences of
climate change.

We review papers that visualize climate variability changes
[JBMS09]∗, identify regions in the atmosphere that act as
indicators for climate change [KLM*08], describe visual-
ization for public-resource climate modelling [SFW04∗] and
perform time-lag analysis and drought assessment on satellite
observational data [KGH*09].

Kehrer et al. [KLM*08] use visualization and interaction
technologies to identify regions in the atmosphere that can
act as indicators for climate change. These regions are sub-
sequently evaluated statistically. Multiple linked views allow
the exploration and analysis of different aspects of multi-field
data. A synthesized degree-of-interest (DOI) attribute can be
used to specify a data region in focus. Smooth brushing (frac-
tional DOI values) and logical combination of brushes are
supported. This work uses and extends the SimVis [DGH03,
DH02, DMG*04, MKO*08] framework for climate research.
Extensions to SimVis include: four-level focus and context
visualization, a function graphs view, data aggregations and
image space methods for maintaining responsiveness when
interacting with the data, and enhanced brushing techniques
to deal with the temporal nature of the data. The dimension-
ality of the data is 3D, time dependent, multi-attribute scalar
on a structured grid. The main challenge is feature detection,
where the features are areas that can act as indicators for
climate change.

Kendal et al. [KGH*09] integrate techniques in paral-
lel I/O with concepts from parallel query-driven visualiza-
tion. The driving application is to study over a terabyte of
multi-variate satellite data for drought assessment (Figure 5)
and time-lag analysis. They reduce the end-to-end execution
times on these problems to one minute on a Jaguar Cray XT4.

The authors use their system to discover climatic trends
based on a vegetation index, a water index and a drought
index. They use five criteria to find periods of drought: water
index below a threshold, vegetation index below a thresh-
old, drought index in a certain range, a minimum time span
and a maximum number of years of drought. They visual-
ize the time-lag between the first snow fall and the first sign
of green-up from vegetation. They first query the vegetation
and water indexes on certain ranges and then parallel-sort the
results in the spatial and temporal domains. The authors use
collective I/O[TGL99] to achieve better bandwidth rates in
the I/O phase, a query-driven method[GMHG06] for scalable
contour extraction and visualization, and the parallel sample
sort[BLM*98] for performing temporal analysis. Satellite
data is 2D, time-dependent on a regular grid. The main chal-
lenge is scalable visualization.

5.3. Hydrology

Hydrology concerns the waters of the Earth, their distribution
and circulation, and their chemical and physical properties.

We present a study of visualization tools for an en-
vironmental observation and forecasting system for the
Columbia River [JCSB03], a paper that focuses on detec-
tion and visualization of mesoscale eddies in an ocean sim-
ulation[WHP*11], and work that visualizes changes in the
frontal position of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland
[DBS*11]

Drocourt et al.[DBS*11] present a design study on visu-
alizing spatiotemporal data of changes in the frontal position
of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland, resulting in a
family of radial visualizations. The scientists are interested
in the movement of these glaciers, in light of a changing
climate, as they contribute directly to sea level rise by releas-
ing icebergs into the ocean. The authors developed an auto-
mated algorithm to partition the visualization into quadrants
based on a certain number of key glaciers. The distribution
in each quadrant is then relaxed to spread the radial points
out further. Other examples of time-series visualization in-
clude Havre et al.’s Themeriver[HHWN02]. This work also
provides a solution to some of the issues raised by Borgo
et al.[BPC*10] regarding inaccuracy in change evaluation
based on pixel-based visualization. Studied phenomena are
2D, time-dependent, multi-field, point data. The main chal-
lenge is time-dependent visualization.

Ocean simulations produce high-resolution, 3D data fields,
but publications in oceanography typically show 2D plots
of variables in horizontal or vertical sections. Williams
et al.[WHP*11] visualize and analyse flow data from a 3D
ocean simulation with a particular focus on coherent vor-
tical features called mesoscale eddies. These eddies repre-
sent a large fraction of the total estimate of oceanic kinetic

energy; they have a significant influence on the earth’s cli-
mate by transporting heat, momentum and mass; and they are
important to the biology of the oceans as they transport car-
bon, oxygen and nutrients to nutrient-poor waters. Eddies are
identified by first calculating the value of the Okubo-Weiss
parameter at each point in the simulation. The algorithm then
selects only those areas in which this parameter indicates that
vorticity dominates and the flow is circular in nature. Finally,
the eddy field is shown in 3D with eddies depicted as cylin-
ders, with colour-mapped to rotation direction and spatial
extent corresponding to that of the eddy. This paper is sim-
ilar to other work on extracting structure and visualizing it
through glyphs[TG09], and previous work on visualization
of vortices in 3D[ZM95]. The dimensionality of the data is
3D, static, uniform resolution data on a regular grid. The main
challenge is feature detection, where features of interest are
coherent vortical areas called mesoscale eddies.

Jimenez et al.[JCSB03] present visualization tools for an
environmental observation and forecasting system for the
Columbia River [JCSB03] (CORIE). The authors add inter-
active 3D visualization tools to CORIE which can be used
to inspect the simulated and measured data. The Columbia
River is the target of numerous studies focusing on life cycles
of endangered fish species in the context of navigation and
hydropower improvements and ecosystem re-saturation ef-
forts. A key challenge is to separate natural from man-made
effects. The work uses VTK to add three-dimensional surface
and volumetric visualization capabilities to the CORIE (en-
vironmental observation and forecasting) system. A custom
volume renderer is used with the VTK code. The work uses
an unstructured volume rendering engine similar to that of
Lum et al.[LMC02]. The visualization techniques presented
process 3D, time-dependent, unstructured grid, scalar and
vector data. The main challenge is multi-field visualization,
where data of interest includes bathymetry, salinity scalars,
velocity fields and drifters for the CORIE system.

5.4. Geology

Geology is the scientific study of the Earth, its composition,
structure and physical properties.

Included in our survey are contributions that visualize
hot fluid discharges from seafloor vents [SBS*04]∗, pro-
duce illustrative rendering of geologic layers [PGTG07],
visualize seismic data together with satellite-based observa-
tional data[YXG*10]∗, and present scalable visualizations
of large-scale earthquake simulations[MSB*03, YMW04,
TYRG*06].

See Carr [Car02] for a book on data visualization tech-
niques for geosciences and Erlebacher et al.[EYD01] for a
review article on geoscience visualization techniques, and
areas that need improvement.

Ma et al.[MSB*03] present a parallel volume visualization
algorithm for interactive rendering of time-varying, unstruc-
tured data generated from large-scale earthquake simulations
(Figure 6). High-resolution exploration of the data was not
available in the past to geoscientists who were instead limited
to visualizations of reduced-resolution versions of the data
on a regular grid.

The rendering algorithm uses a spatial (octree) encoding
of the data for adaptive rendering. The appropriate octree
level is selected based on the image resolution. A host com-
putes the octree and uses it to distribute blocks of hexahedral
elements among rendering processors. The centralized data
distribution is not ideal as parallel I/O should have been used
instead. Each processor executes a ray-casting and an image
compositing operation while the data block for the next time-
step is transferred from disk. The authors use SLIC[SML*03]

for image compositing. The data is 3D, time-dependent on
an unstructured grid, and the main challenge is scalable vi-
sualization.

Yu et al.[YMW04] present a parallel visualization pipeline
to study an earthquake simulation that models the 3D seis-
mic wave propagation of the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
Their tests show that they completely remove the I/O bot-
tleneck, common in time-varying data, caused by the need
to constantly transfer each time step from disk to memory.
However, optimizing access to storage remains an important
challenge for visual analysis of large datasets[RPS*08]. The
authors use parallel I/O strategies that adapt to the data size
and parallel system performance. The visualization pipeline
includes input, rendering and output processors. The input
processors read data files from the parallel file system, pre-
process the raw data, and distribute the resulting data blocks
to the rendering processors. The rendering processors pro-
duce volume-rendered images for its data blocks which are
then delivered to the output processors and finally to a display.
The authors extend previous work[MSB*03] by improving
the I/O scheme. This allows them to reduce I/O and pre-
processing times down to rendering time, making possible
to reduce these costs by overlapping I/O and rendering. The
authors visualize 3D, time-dependent data on a unstructured
grid. The main challenge is scalable visualization, specifi-
cally on working around the problems of large-scale I/O.

Tu et al.[TYRG*06] describe an end-to-end approach to
a simulation pipeline in which all elements (problem de-
scription, solver and visualization) are tightly coupled and
execute in parallel with no intermediate I/O. They use this
new approach for an octree-based finite element simula-
tion of earthquake ground motion. Performance evaluations
demonstrate that the end-to-end approach overcomes the
scalability bottlenecks of traditional approaches. The key
idea used by the authors is to replace the traditional file
interface with a scalable, parallel runtime implemented on
top of a parallel octree data structure. All components of
the simulation pipeline (meshing, partitioning, simulation
and visualization) are tightly coupled and execute on the
same set of processors. The inputs are the simulation and
visualization specifications whereas the outputs are image
frames generated as the simulation runs. There is no other file
I/O. The authors use an octree-based earthquake modelling
method[BGK05], a database system to generate unstructured
hexahedral octree-based meshes[TO04] and, scalable render-
ing calculations[MSB*03, YMW04]. The earthquake simu-
lation data is 3D, and time-dependent on an unstructured
grid. The main challenge is scalable visualization.

Patel et al. [PGT*08] present a toolbox for interpretation
and automatic illustration of 2D slices of seismic volumetric
reflection data. They improve both the manual search and the
annotation of seismic structures, reducing the manual labour
of seismic illustrators and interpreters (Figure 7).

interpreted data rendering (bottom) for seismic volumetric
reflection data. [PGTG07]. Image courtesy of Daniel Patel.

The authors improve the search of seismic structures by
pre-calculating the horizon lines that separate rocks with
different mineral densities or porosity characteristics. They
improve the illustration of seismic data by using deformed
texturing and line and texture transfer functions. The authors
extend their previous work [PGTG07] by automatically in-
terpreting horizon lines and by providing transfer functions
for lines, wells and horizon lines. Seismic data is 3D, static,
scalar attributes on a structured grid with uniform resolution.
The main challenge of the paper is feature detection, where
the features are the lines that separate rocks with different
mineral densities or porosity characteristics.

6. Physics

Physics studies the structure of matter and the interactions
between objects at microscopic, human and extragalactic

scales. It is the synthesis of several fields including me-
chanics, optics, acoustics, electricity, magnetism, heat and
the physical properties of matter. This synthesis is based on
the fact that the forces and energies studied in these sciences
are related [bri10g].

6.1. Acoustics

Acoustics is the science of sound, its production, transmis-
sion and effects. Acoustics studies phenomena responsible
for the sensation of hearing, sounds with frequency too high
or too low for the human ear, and the transmission of sound
through media other than air[Pie89].

We review papers that simulate sound within a room
[BDM*05, LCM07b, CLT*08, BMD*08], that show how
the material on room surfaces influences sound [DMB*06,
MDHB*07], and present a comparative visualization of two
different approaches for acoustic simulation [DBM*06].

Bertram et al. [BDM*05] trace the paths of phonons
(sound particles) from a sound source in a scene to a listener’s
position. This enables the computation of a finite-response
filter that, when convolved with an anechoic input signal,
produces a realistic aural impression of the simulated room.
The results from this technique are more precise than those
from finite element simulations for higher frequencies. The
implementation is similar to that of photon mapping: parti-
cles are followed from source and through reflections (using
material-specific properties). Bidirectional reflection distri-
bution functions (BRDF) are used to determine local inten-
sity. The technique of photon mapping [Jen96, JC98, KW00]
was an inspiration for this work. Previous work in acoustics
is divided into image-source [Bor84], accurate but compli-
cated for non-box shaped rooms, and ray tracing [Kul85],
which is computationally expensive and receiver-location
dependent. Processed data is 3D and time-dependent.
The main challenge addressed is performing the sound
simulation.

Deines et al. [DMB*06] present visualizations of acoustic
behaviour inside a room. Through these visualizations the
authors show the surface material’s influence on the sound
coming from the source, the energy of the sound reflected by
various surfaces at different time intervals, and a global view
of the received sound at listeners’ positions (Figure 8).

The authors present four visualization techniques for
acoustic behaviour. They visualize phonons on surfaces by
rendering each phonon as a sphere and colour-coding it ac-
cording to its spectral energy. A second technique visual-
izes wave fronts reflected at the room surfaces by clustering
phonons with a common history and colour-coding the result-
ing surface based on the energy of the phonons. The phonon
clusters reduce to a simple phonon as the number of reflec-
tions increases, so this technique works only for visualizing
wave fronts of phonons resulting from a few reflections. A

the ceiling. Image courtesy of Eduard Deines.

third technique produces a continuous representation of the
emitted energy on the surfaces of the room by interpolat-
ing the energy and pathlength of the phonons. Finally, a
fourth technique shows a deformed sphere according to the
amount of energy received from various directions, colour-
coded based on the frequency of the sound received. Deines
et al. [DMB*06] use their previous acoustic simulation
algorithm [BDM*05] to visualize acoustic room properties
and the sound properties at the listener position. Sound simu-
lation data is 3D, time-dependent, scalar and vector attributes,
on a unstructured grid. The main challenge is multi-field vi-
sualization showing both the energy and the frequencies of
phonons at listener positions.

Deines et al. [DBM*06] present a comparative visualiza-
tion of two different approaches for acoustic simulation: a
finite element (FEM) based solution of the sound wave equa-
tion (precise, but computationally expensive at medium and
high frequencies) and phonon tracing (efficient but not pre-
cise at low frequencies). The goal of this work is to learn in
which range of frequency the results of both methods match
and to devise a measure of the differences between the two
methods. Phonon tracing [BDM*05] fails in the low fre-
quency range because of diffraction and interference effects,
so wave acoustics is used to simulate the low frequency part
of the sound field. As an alternative, the authors use the FEM
to solve the wave equation. This method approximates the
wave equation by a large system of ordinary differential equa-
tions the solutions of which are the pressure at grid points
covering the room. Deines et al. [DBM*06] devise a simu-
lation experiment to compare the two approaches by using

an acoustic measure called gain and displaying the resulting
error. Furthermore they visualize the interference patterns
and wave propagation for different frequencies of the signal.
Through these visualizations, they are able to conclude at
which frequency range the two methods match. The authors
extend their previous acoustic simulation method phonon
tracing [BDM*05] by using pressure instead of energy in
simulation calculations. The phenomena they study is 3D,
time dependent, on an unstructured grid. The main challenge
is doing comparative visualization to aid in studying alterna-
tive methods for acoustic simulation.

Lauterbach et al. [LCM07b] present a new algorithm for
interactive sound rendering that can handle complex scenes
with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles, dynamic
sound sources and dynamic objects. The authors follow
sound though a scene through frustum tracing by handling di-
rect transmission or specular reflection. They trace a convex
frustum through a bounding volume hierarchy that represents
the scene. The frustum is defined by the four side facets and
the front face. The main difference between frustum tracing
and beam tracing is how the intersection with a scene triangle
is calculated. Beam tracing calculates the exact intersection.
In frustum tracing, the frustum is subdivided uniformly into
smaller sub-frusta and only discrete clipping is performed at
the sub-frusta level. Lauterbach et al. [LCM07b]’s algorithm
can be thought of as a discrete version of the beam tracing
algorithm by Funkhouser et al. [FCE*98, FTC*04]. Frustum
tracing is faster but less precise compared with beam tracing.
Precision can be improved through finer sub-division into
smaller frusta at the cost of speed. The techniques described
handle 3D, time-dependent, multi-attribute scalar data on
an unstructured grid. The main challenge is computing the
acoustic simulation.

Chandak et al. [CLT*08] present an interactive algorithm
that computes sound propagation paths in complex scenes
and can be used in acoustic modelling, multi-sensory visual-
ization and training. Their algorithm can offer considerable
speed-up over prior geometric sound propagation methods.
The authors trace sound propagation paths for specular re-
flection and edge diffraction by tracing an adaptive frustum
from a point source to the listener. The adaptive frustum is
represented using an apex and a quadtree to keep track of its
subdivision. The scene is represented using a bounding vol-
ume hierarchy of axis-aligned bounding boxes. The frustum
is automatically sub-divided to accurately compute intersec-
tions with the scene primitives up to a maximum-subdivision
depth. Chandak et al. [CLT*08] improve on the ray-frustum
approach in Lauterbach et al. [LCM07a, LCM07b] by adap-
tively subdividing the ray-frustum in places where the scene
has more complexity and adding edge diffraction to their
sound modelling. Sound data is 3D, time-dependent, multi-
attribute scalar, on an unstructured grid and the main chal-
lenge of the paper is using the science of sound to do the
sound simulation.

6.2. Atomic, chemical and nuclear physics

We now turn to studies of matter at the smallest scale at which
chemical elements can be identified and even at the structure
of atomic nuclei. The most important properties of matter
that we encounter in normal experience depend only on the
mass of the atomic nucleus and its charge [bri10g, col07].

This section reviews research that visualizes parti-
cle data generated by accelerator modelling simulations
[CFG*05]∗[RPW*08], defects in nematic liquid crystals
[SPL*06]∗ [MJK06] and nematic liquid crystal alignment
[JKM06] and visualize large molecular dynamics simula-
tions [RE05, GRDE10]. We review a paper that visualizes
Fourier transform mass spectrometry experiments [BvL06]∗,
and a hardware accelerated simulation of radiographs applied
to the simulation of experimental diagnostics for fusion ex-
periments[LCM*05].

Reina et al. [RE05] describe a method for visualizing
molecular dynamic simulations using the GPU that mini-
mizes the quantity of data that needs to be transferred by
generating implicit surfaces directly in the fragment pro-
gram. This approach allows domain experts to visualize the
results of simulations with a higher number of particles than
before and offers better visual quality (Figure 9).

An existing pointcloud renderer is extended by writing
fragment programs to ray-trace an implicit surface for each
point in the data, which can contain multiple attributes. This
work builds on the existing algorithm and renderer introduced
by Hopf and Ertl [HE03] and developed further in work by
Hopf et al. [HLE04] The method described handles 3D, time-
dependent, adaptive resolution data. The main challenge is

efficiently using the GPU to ray trace implicit surfaces used
to represent molecules.

Rübel et al. [RPW*08] combine infovis and scientific data
management techniques to gain insights from a large, multi-
field dataset produced by a laser wakefield accelerator simu-
lation (Figure 10). These accelerators are of interest because
they are able to achieve very high particle speeds within
a relatively short distance when compared with traditional
electromagnetic accelerators. Their approach performs par-
ticle tracking in a few seconds compared with hours when
using a naive script.

The authors adapt and extend histogram-based parallel
coordinates for use with high-performance query-driven vi-
sualization of very large data (210 GB). Parallel coordinates
are used for both visual display and interactive construc-
tion of boolean data range queries. The queries are used for
subsequent data mining operations. Index/query technology
is used to mine for data and to generate multi-resolution
histograms. Views of the data include a parallel coordi-
nates view showing all particles, a 2D plot of the beam
of highly accelerated particles and a volume rendering of
the plasma density waves generated inside the accelerator.
Rübel et al. [RPW*08] build on the parallel coordinates work
of Novotny and Houser [NH06] to make it parallel and scal-
able to large data. They use the query-driven visualization
work of Stockinger et al.[SSWB05], FastBit[fas]: software
for bitmap indexing, and VisIt[vis]: software for data pro-
cessing and visualization that can handle extremely large
datasets. Data visualized is 3D, time-dependent, multi-field,
particle data. The main challenge addressed by the paper is
scalable visualization.

Liquid crystals are an intermediate phase of matter be-
tween solid and liquid. In this state, molecules do not favour
any particular position but they do favour alignment with
preferred directions throughout the material. Nematic liquid
crystals (NLC) are a class of liquid crystals with elongated
molecules. A common way to represent the average align-
ment of molecules within this type of material is the align-
ment tensor. Jankun–Kelly and Mehta [JKM06] introduce a
glyph-based method for visualizing the nematic liquid crys-
tal alignment tensor. Their method communicates both the
strength of the uniaxial alignment and the amount of biaxial-
ity and, unlike previous methods, does not distort features of
interest. Their glyph is inspired by the work of Kindlmann
[Kin06] with a different parameterization of superellipsoids.
Unlike previous work, their parameterization can represent
negative uniaxial arrangements and also can represent real
symmetric traceless tensors. Positive and negative uniaxial
alignments are distinguished by a pinching in the plane or-
thogonal to the main axes of the glyph. Eigenvalues cannot
be used directly for encoding the scale of the glyph due to the
traceless nature of the tensor - values may be negative or zero.
So other properties of the NLC system are encoded as the
axes radii. This paper extends work by Kindlmann [Kin06]

to represent negative uniaxial arrangements and real sym-
metric traceless tensors. The method described handles 3D,
static data and the main challenge of the paper is multi-field
visualization.

Laney et al. [LCM*05] present a hardware accelerated,
volume rendering based, simulation of radiographs. Their so-
lution can be used as a replacement for software approaches
that trades off accuracy for increased performance. They
apply their algorithms to the simulation of experimental di-
agnostics for fusion experiments to optimize simulation pa-
rameters. The authors present algorithms for absorption-only
and for emissive materials, for hexahedral and tetrahedral
meshes. The radiance for a given frequency can be computed
by integrating along a linear path through the mesh in a back
to front order. The integration is done for a set of frequency
bins. The authors extend the GPU volume rendering tech-
nique for unstructured grids of Callahan et al. [CICS05].
Simulation data is 3D, static on an unstructured grid. The
main challenge of the paper is using the GPU to volume
render unstructured grids.

As computational power increases, the size of molec-
ular dynamic simulations challenges interactive visualiza-
tion on workstation computers. Grottel et al. [GRDE10]
present a method for high-quality visualization of massive
molecular dynamics datasets which enables interactive ren-
dering of data containing tens of millions of high-quality
glyphs. To obtain interactive rendering the authors em-
ploy several optimization strategies. They use data quan-

tization and data caching in the GPU memory (this re-
sults in lower CPU–GPU bandwidth consumption). They
use coarse, cell-level culling to omit blocks of data from
rendering (this results in reduced geometry processing load
and lower CPU–GPU bandwidth consumption) and fine,
vertex-level culling to omit individual glyphs from render-
ing (this results in reduced fragment processing load). Ren-
dering is performed using GPU raycasting using deferred
shading with smooth normal generation. The authors’ work
improves on the rendering speed of other molecular dy-
namics visualization tools such as TexMol [BDST04], Bal-
lView [MHLK05], AtomEye [Li03] and VMD [HDS96].
Simulation data is 3D, static and the focus is on efficiently
utilizing the GPU for raycasting molecules represented as
glyphs.

6.3. Electricity, magnetism and optics

Electricity and magnetism are related physical phenomena
associated with electric charges that are stationary (only elec-
tricity) or moving (both electricity and magnetism) [bri11a,
bri11c].

We outline papers describing techniques that determine the
topology of a toroidal magnetic field[SCT*10]∗ [TGS11].

Optics is the study of the behaviour and properties of
light. Geometrical optics deals with tracing of light rays and
studies the formation of images by lenses and other optical

devices, and physical optics deals with wave phenomena such
as interference and diffraction [bri10g].

We include a paper that visualizes optical power flow
through nano-apertures around critical points [SBSH04]∗.

Tricoche et al. [TGS11] present a general method for the
automatic extraction and characterization of topological fea-
tures in area preserving maps. The authors apply their method
to simulation data of the magnetic confinement of plasma in
a fusion reactor. Their algorithm extracts fixed points in the
map based on island topology, assigns a given range of pe-
riods to these features, calculates the Poincaré index for the
grid cells that may contain a fixed point, computes the ex-
act information (location, stability type, etc.) of these points,
and finally calculates the separatrices that connect the fixed
points. The authors extract a topological skeleton of the map
and visualize it as a Standard Map (a type of 2D area pre-
serving map). Data mining approaches to identifying fea-
tures in Poincaré plots through experiment were developed
by Bagherjeiran and Kamath [BK06]. Also the new method-
ology utilizes the work of Andronov [And73] on defining the
Poincaré index. The authors present a method for analysing
maps with two degrees of freedom of near-integrable sys-
tems (i.e. no fully stochastic systems). The main challenge is
feature detection for topological features in area preserving
maps.

6.4. Gravitation and relativistic mechanics

Historically, the study of gravitation has been placed within
mechanics because of Newton’s contribution to both areas.
The modern theory of gravitation is Einstein’s general the-
ory of relativity which accounts for phenomena such as
the gravitational bending of light around a massive object
[bri10g].

Relativistic mechanics, based on Einstein’s special theory
of relativity, is concerned with the motion of bodies whose
velocities approach the speed of light[bri11d].

We review papers that report on visualizations for theories
of general and special relativity[WBE*05]∗, [MGW10] and
visualize physical aspects of the Gödel universe [GB08]∗

[GMDW09]∗.

See Ruder et al.[RWNM08] for an article describing vi-
sualization techniques used in physics for visualizing and
understanding relativity.

Müller et al. [MGW10] present computer simulations of
the optical effects of travelling near the speed of light: ge-
ometric distortions, Doppler and searchlight effects. Their
method provides a different compromise between rendering
speed, rendering quality and generality compared with ex-
isting relativistic visualization algorithms. There are three
methods of rendering objects moving at near light speed:
polygon rendering, ray tracing and image-based methods.

Polygon rendering is fast but can introduce visual artefacts
that increase with the size of the polygons used to spec-
ify a model. Although ray tracing guarantees optimal visual
quality it does not work at interactive speeds. Image-based
methods are fast but they work only for restricted scenarios
where a fast moving observer travels through a static envi-
ronment. The authors present a hybrid approach based on
polygon rendering and local ray casting. They implement
their method on the GPU and enable interactive rendering.
Their method has fewer artefacts than polygon rendering, is
faster than ray tracing and is more flexible than image-based
methods by allowing visualization of multiple objects in ar-
bitrary relative motion. They use local ray tracing, see e.g.
Reina and Ertl [RE05], to eliminate the object-space search,
required in ray tracing to find the triangle intersected by a
viewing ray. Müller et al. [MGW10] combine work on poly-
gon rendering [HTW90, GMX91] with local GPU ray tracing
[Gum03, RE05]. The techniques discussed process 3D, time-
dependent, unstructured grid data. The main challenge of the
paper is using the GPU for ray tracing.

6.5. Mechanics

Mechanics is the study of the motion of objects under the
action of given forces. In classical mechanics laws are for-
mulated for point particles. These laws are extended for bod-
ies with mass distribution in rigid-body dynamics. Elasticity
is the mechanics of deformable solids, whereas hydrostatics
and hydrodynamics deal with fluids at rest and in motion
[bri10g].

This section describes literature that visualizes the turbu-
lent mixing layer between two fluids [LBM*06] and time-
dependent foam simulations [LLCD11].

A heavy fluid placed above a light fluid creates a charac-
teristic structure of rising ‘bubbles’ (light fluid) and fallling
‘spikes’ (heavy fluid) known as the Rayleigh-Taylor insta-
bility (RTI). The surfaces separating the mixed fluid from
unmixed fluids are known as the envelope and the plane ini-
tially separating the two fluids is called the midplane. Laney
et al. [LBM*06] present a new approach to analyse the RTI
by topological analysis of the envelope and of the midplane.
The objective is to better understand the physics of the RTI
which occurs in many natural and man-made phenomena.
The authors extract a segmentation of the upper envelope to
identify bubbles using work by Bremer et al. [BHEP04] and
Bremer and Pascuci [BP07]. They track bubbles over time
and highlight merge/split events that form the larger struc-
tures at the later stage of mixing of the two fluids using work
by Samtaney et al. [SSZC94]. They analyse the topology of
the density and velocity fields on the midplane to determine
if the mixing phases are discernible and to examine asymp-
totic behaviour at late times. The streaming mesh viewer of
Insenburg et al. [ILGS03] is used for simplification and
viewing of envelope surfaces. Simulation data is 3D, time-
dependent, multi-attribute scalar and vector. The main

challenge of the paper is feature detection and tracking
where the features are the bubbles of the Rayleigh–Taylor
instability.

Lipşa et al. [LLCD11] describe the foam research do-
main area and present an application that provides various
techniques for the visualization, exploration, and analysis
of time-dependent 2D foam simulation data. The goals are
to infer the triggers to various foam behaviours, to visual-
ize general foam behaviour and discover how this behaviour
depends on measurable foam properties. The authors parse
Surface Evolver[Bra92] simulation data and visualize indi-
vidual simulation time steps using colour-mapped attribute
values enhanced with colour-bar clamping and with a topo-
logical changes overlay. Bubbles can be selected and filtered
by bubble ID, by location and by attribute value. The time-
dependent visualization includes the average for a time win-
dow behind the current time step and visualization of bubble
paths. Data visualized is 2D, time-dependent on an unstruc-
tured grid. The main challenge of the paper is time-dependent
visualization, in particular eliminating the large fluctuations
in the values of the attributes between time steps determined
by changes in the topology of the film network.

7. Discussion and Limitations

Our work has some important limitations to consider. First,
because our survey is not comprehensive, it may paint a
skewed picture of the current status of research in visual-
ization for the physical sciences. Second, our survey is of a
subjective nature as there are a number of valid alternative
classifications that can be used to describe the work surveyed.
We analyse these limitations next.

We do not review all possible sources that publish visu-
alization work for the physical sciences. Even though we
try to be very broad and inclusive, our review is influenced
by space limitations and the broad area surveyed. We review
papers from the IEEE Vis/InfoVis conferences, EuroVis con-
ference, Supercomputing (SC) conference as well as IEEE
TVCG and CGF. We do not review visualization work pub-
lished in domain specific journals, but rather, we reference
surveys, and offer a few examples. All papers reviewed are in-
cluded in the classification tables, however to address space
limitations we only include full summaries for a subset of
the reviewed papers. We include a full summary of a paper if
the work is recent or if it has a high citation count in Google
Scholar.

Whereas visualization solutions may address more than
one challenge, we only include in the classification tables the
main challenge which highlights the main contribution of the
paper.

We do not suggest that our classification is the only way
to describe the current state of visualization for the physical
sciences. There are a number of good alternative ways to
describe it. For instance classifying papers as presentation,

analytical, or exploratory (see Bergeron’s position statement
in Visualization Reference Models panel[BAB*93]) is a valid
alternative.

Although knowing the current status of research in visu-
alization for the physical sciences is useful, very important
drivers in choosing a future research direction include solv-
ing a problem, providing a useful tool or addressing a need in
the domain science. Domain scientists may provide valuable
information on future research directions in their respective
fields. Deciding on a future research project in visualization
for physical sciences is best done by considering all these fac-
tors rather than only the observations offered by our survey.

This paper provides a much-needed starting point. We
encourage the reader to use the paper as a way to understand
the status of current research and as a first step to explore
future work.

8. Directions for Future Work and Conclusions

The status of current work in visualization for the physical
sciences presented in Tables 1 and 2 leads us to the follow-
ing observations. As noted in the Section 7, these observa-
tions, when considered alone, might lead to incorrect con-
clusions. Instead, they should be just one of the many factors
that have to be considered when choosing a future research
direction.

1. Multi-field visualization. Most of the work has been
done in earth sciences and physics which suggests that
multi-field visualization for astronomy and chemistry
may be promising future research directions.

2. Feature detection. Locating and tracking features in
data is essential for data analysis in many fields of
the physical sciences, however most work in this area
has been done in physics and chemistry. This suggests
that detecting and tracking features for astronomy, and
earth sciences may be promising directions of future
work.

3. Graphics hardware. Most research on efficiently uti-
lizing novel graphics hardware has been focused on
chemistry and physics. Using the GPUs in other physi-
cal sciences appears a promising research direction.

4. Scalable visualization We note that most work has been
done for Earth Sciences. Limited computing resources,
including resources for visualization, is a perennial
problem in the physical sciences. Addressing some of
the limitations experienced through scalable visualiza-
tions could have the large impact of enabling new anal-
yses and making new discoveries possible.

5. Error and uncertainty, time-dependent visualiza-
tion, comparable visualization A small number of pa-
pers address these challenges. They remains top direc-
tions for future research in visualization for the physical
sciences.

There is also potential for research in the other visual-
ization problem categories proposed by Johnson [Joh04] but
not yet addressed in the literature. For example, we believe
that integrated problem-solving environments is both rele-
vant and a good research direction for visualization in the
physical sciences.

Table 1 reveals that most application papers for the phys-
ical sciences visualize 3D static and time-dependent data.
The exception is earth sciences where both 2D and 3D time-
dependent data is visualized. Most work in astronomy visu-
alizes 3D static data.

There are also opportunities for visualization collaboration
in other fields within the physical sciences that have not yet
been addressed in the visualization literature, e.g. structural
chemistry, geochemistry and quantum mechanics.

In this state-of-the-art report we have provided a com-
prehensive introduction to visualization solutions for the
physical sciences developed in the last nine years. We in-
troduced classifications for the varied visualization solutions
provided for physical sciences. These classifications allow
us to provide a much-needed global view of this wide area
of research. Our survey promotes collaboration with other
scientific fields by reviewing recent visualization papers for
the physical sciences, by comparing and contrasting them,
pointing out how they relate to one another and by classi-
fying them to highlight mature areas, and suggest areas for
future work. Through these collaborations, the visualization
community can be exposed to new problems and be asked to
solve new challenges. In this way, the visualization commu-
nity can develop innovative techniques to solve our domain
experts’ problems and keep the visualization field vibrant
and relevant for the future.
