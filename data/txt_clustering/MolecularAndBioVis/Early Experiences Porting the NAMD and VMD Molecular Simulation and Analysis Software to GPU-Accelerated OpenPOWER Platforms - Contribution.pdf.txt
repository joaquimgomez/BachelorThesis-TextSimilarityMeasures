GPU-Accelerated OpenPOWER Platforms

Content
All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules provide a powerful tool for exploring the
structure and dynamics of large protein complexes within realistic cellular environments. Unfortu-
nately, such simulations are extremely demanding in terms of their computational requirements,
and they present many challenges in terms of preparation, simulation methodology, and analysis
and visualization of results. We describe our early experiences porting the popular molecular
dynamics simulation program NAMD and the simulation preparation, analysis, and visualization
tool VMD to GPU-accelerated OpenPOWER hardware platforms. We report our experiences with
compiler-provided autovectorization and compare with hand-coded vector intrinsics for the POWER8
CPU. We explore the performance benefits obtained from unique POWER8 architectural features
such as 8-way SMT and its value for particular molecular modeling tasks. Finally, we evaluate
the performance of several GPU-accelerated molecular modeling kernels and relate them to other
hardware platforms.
