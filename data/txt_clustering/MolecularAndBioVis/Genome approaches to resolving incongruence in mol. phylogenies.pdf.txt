One of the most pervasive challenges in molecular phylogenetics is the incongruence between phylogenies obtained using
different data sets, such as individual genes. To systematically investigate the degree of incongruence, and potential methods for
resolving it, we screened the genome sequences of eight yeast species and selected 106 widely distributed orthologous genes for
phylogenetic analyses, singly and by concatenation. Our results suggest that data sets consisting of single or a small number of
concatenated genes have a significant probability of supporting conflicting topologies. By contrast, analyses of the entire data set
of concatenated genes yielded a single, fully resolved species tree with maximum support. Comparable results were obtained with
a concatenation of a minimum of 20 genes; substantially more genes than commonly used but a small fraction of any genome.
These results have important implications for resolving branches of the tree of life.

Understanding the historical relationships between living organ-
isms has been one of the principal goals of evolutionary research.
Molecular phylogenetic data are instrumental in research on the
history of life1–3, the polarity of phenotypic and developmental
evolution4, and on the diversity of living organisms5. Despite
tremendous progress in recent years, phylogenetic reconstruction
involves many challenges that create uncertainty with respect to the
true historical associations of the taxa analysed. One of the most
notable difficulties is the widespread occurrence of incongruence
between alternative phylogenies generated from single-gene data
sets. Incongruence occurs at all taxonomic levels, from phylogenies
of closely related species6,7 to relationships between major classes8,9

or phyla and higher taxonomic groups10–12.
Both analytical and biological factors may cause incongru-

ence10,13. Analytical factors affecting phylogenetic reconstruction
include the choice of optimality criterion14, limited data avail-
ability15,16, taxon sampling17 and specific assumptions in the mod-
elling of sequence evolution18. Biological processes such as the
action of natural selection or genetic drift19–22 may cause the history
of the genes under analysis to obscure the history of the taxa. The
large number of potential explanations for the presence of incon-
gruence in molecular phylogenetic analyses makes decisions on how
to handle conflict in larger sets of molecular data difficult23. For
example, two genes with different evolutionary histories (for
example, owing to hybridization or horizontal transfer) for a
particular taxonomic group will by definition be incongruent
while still depicting true histories20. Data sets composed of genes
showing heterogeneity in mode of sequence evolution may also
compound bias rather than resolve the true history24. Furthermore,
because current tests are not always reliable25,26, it has been difficult
to estimate incongruence. To overcome the effect of analytical
and biological factors by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio,
many researchers have attempted to address difficult phylogenetic
questions by analysis of concatenated data sets1,27–29. However,
phylogenetic analyses of different sets of concatenated genes do
not always converge on the same tree8,9, and some studies have
yielded results at odds with widely accepted phylogenies30. Although
theory suggests that a number of factors (such as gene number,
sequence length, optimality criterion and rate of evolution) may
influence phylogenetic reconstruction14,15,31, the effect of these factors
has not been systematically explored with large data sets derived
from biological sequences. Recent progress in the genomics of the

yeast genus Saccharomyces32–34 has presented an unprecedented
opportunity to evaluate these issues in eukaryotic phylogenetics.

Screen for and phylogenetic analysis of orthologous genes
Genome sequence data have been obtained for seven Saccharomyces
species (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii,
S. bayanus, S. castellii and S. kluyveri)32–34 as well as for the outgroup
fungus Candida albicans. The genomes of all eight species were
screened for orthologous genes to serve as phylogenetic markers
(see Methods). Previous work35–37 has suggested the occurrence of
a genome duplication in the evolutionary history of the Saccharo-
myces yeasts, so our gene selection criteria relied on synteny to
establish orthology (see Methods). We retained 106 genes, which are
distributed throughout the S. cerevisiae genome on all 16 chromo-
somes and comprise a total length of 127,026 nucleotides (42,342
amino acids), corresponding to roughly 1% of the genomic
sequence and 2% of the predicted genes. Phylogenetic reconstruc-
tions were performed in three ways: maximum likelihood (ML)
analysis of the nucleotide data, and maximum parsimony (MP)
analysis of both the nucleotide and the amino acid data. Because the
study comprised eight taxa, we used a search strategy in each
analysis that was guaranteed to find the most parsimonious or
most likely tree with respect to each gene (see Methods).

Single-gene phylogenies reveal extensive incongruence
Analyses of the 106 genes resulted in more than 20 alternative ML or
MP trees (see Methods). To assess the degree of support for each of
these trees, 100 bootstrap replicates were generated and summar-
ized as 50% majority-rule consensus trees. Several of the many
strongly supported (defined here as a bootstrap value .70%)
alternative phylogenies are shown in Fig. 1a–f. For example, some
genes recovered strong support for various alternative placements
of species within the sensu stricto group (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus,
S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus; Fig. 1a, c–e), whereas
other genes strongly supported alternative placements of S. castellii
and S. kluyveri relative to the outgroup (Fig. 1a, b, f).

The 106 genes analysed were selected without consideration of
their function, and their phylogenetic performance has not been
evaluated previously. Genes more commonly used in molecular
systematics are often chosen for both historical (for example, ease of
amplification, previous analyses of related taxa) and analytical (for
example, copy number, rate of evolution) reasons38. It is possible

that commonly used genes may provide better resolution of the
same set of taxa. We repeated ML and MP analyses of nucleotide
sequence on a sample of six commonly used genes (actin, hsp70,
b-tubulin, RNA polymerase II, elongation factor 1-a and 18S
rDNA), and also obtained alternative and often strongly supported
phylogenies (Fig. 1g–l). Specifically, actin and RNA polymerase II
(Fig. 1g, j) each support the same tree as in Fig. 1a, whereas hsp70
(Fig. 1h) supports the topology in Fig. 1b. b-Tubulin (Fig. 1i), 18S
rDNA (Fig. 1l) and elongation factor 1-a (Fig. 1k) each support,
albeit weakly at some branches, trees not represented in Fig. 1a–f.
Therefore, analyses of both commonly used genes and the set of 106
orthologous genes provide strong support for several alternative
phylogenies and fail to indicate which gene tree(s) might represent
the actual species tree.

The alternative phylogenies could have resulted from a number
of different scenarios: (1) most genes could have weakly supported
most phylogenies and strongly supported only a few alternative
trees; (2) most genes could have strongly supported one phylogeny
and a few genes strongly supported only a small number of
alternatives; (3) there could have been some combination of these
scenarios so that each branch among alternative phylogenies had
either weak or strong support depending on the gene. To distinguish
between these possibilities, we identified all of the branches recov-
ered during the single-gene analyses, and recorded each bootstrap
value with respect to the gene and method of analysis (see Sup-
plementary Information). Eight branches were shared by all three
analyses with multiple instances of bootstrap values .50%; hence,
we focus on these eight branches in our analyses.

For each branch, we observed a full range of bootstrap values
(Fig. 2c). Only two branches (branches 1 and 4 in Fig. 2) were
supported with high bootstrap values by a majority of genes. The
remaining six branches were supported by bootstrap values that
range evenly from 0 to 100 (Fig. 2c). Two summary statistics of these
distributions, the mean bootstrap value and the percentage of genes
supporting each branch (Fig. 2c), also indicate weak support overall

for each of these six branches (Fig. 2c). Notably, bootstrap values
for branches 3 versus 6 and among branches 5, 7 and 8 exhibit
significant and strong negative correlations so that a low bootstrap
value for one branch corresponds to a high bootstrap value for an
alternative branch (Pearson correlation coefficients and P-values
are: 20.684 and ,0.001, 20.734 and ,0.001, and 20.607 and
,0.001 for branches 3 versus 6, 5 versus 7, and 5 versus 8,
respectively; values are for ML analysis; similar results were
obtained from the remaining two MP analyses (data not shown)).
Although the values of some other pairs of branches were also
correlated, these were the only pairs of branches exhibiting a very
strong negative correlation across all three analyses. This negative
correlation is indicative of the pervasive direct conflict among genes
with respect to these branches. In summary, the support for a given
branch was strongly dependent on the gene analysed.

Although the trees recovered from single-gene analyses are
incongruent in that they exhibit topological differences, the degree
of conflict among trees could be relatively minor. We examined
the degree of incongruence between the trees recovered by deter-
mining the number of taxa that would need to be removed in order
to make two trees congruent (see Methods). These values were
computed for all possible pairwise comparisons among the 106 50%
majority-rule consensus trees generated within each of the three
analyses. The distribution of values shows that only a small
proportion of all pairwise comparisons are in total agreement
(,15%), whereas most of the trees (.50%) require that at least
two of the eight taxa are removed before they become congruent,
regardless of the method of analysis (Fig. 3). These results were
consistent with other metrics of incongruence (see Methods and
Supplementary Information) and indicate extensive incongruence
among the 106 data sets.

Factors potentially influencing incongruence between trees
We mitigated some potential sources of incongruence by analysing a
genome-wide sample of orthologous genes. There are a number of

additional analytical and biological factors—such as outgroup
choice, number of variable sites and rate of evolution—that may
lead to incongruence between single-gene phylogenies10,13. To test
whether the outgroup accounted for the incongruence between
phylogenies, we repeated all of the analyses without the outgroup
C. albicans. We found no change in the distribution of bootstrap
values (correlations among pairwise comparisons of each distri-
bution for the remaining branches were significant with P , 0.05)
or in the degree of incongruence between the remaining branches
(Supplementary Information). We also examined whether support
for each branch was explained by the number of variable sites,
number of parsimony-informative sites, gene size, rate of evolution,
nucleotide composition, base compositional bias, genome location,
or gene ontology (Table 1; see also Supplementary Information).
Number of variable sites, number of parsimony-informative sites
and gene size were significantly correlated with bootstrap values
for some branches, although they accounted for only a small
amount of the total variation in each case (Table 1; see also
Supplementary Information). With a single exception (branch 4
was correlated with the rate of evolution for the ML analysis; Table
1), none of the remaining variables was correlated with bootstrap
values for any branch (Table 1; see also Supplementary Infor-
mation). In summary, there were no identifiable parameters that
could systematically account for or predict the performance of
single genes.

Concatenation of single genes yields a single tree
Although we do not know the cause(s) of incongruence between
single-gene phylogenies, the critical question is how the pervasive
incongruence between single trees might be overcome to arrive at
the actual species tree. Although many potential options exist, we
explored the effect of concatenating single genes into one large data
set1,27,39. Remarkably, all three methods of analysis of the concate-
nated sequences yielded a single tree with 100% bootstrap values at
every branch (Fig. 4). Furthermore, all alternative topologies
generated among the single-gene analyses were rejected (Templeton
test, P , 0.001 for each of three analyses). Thus, even though the
individual genes examined supported alternative trees, the conca-
tenated data exclusively supported a single tree. This level of support
for a single tree with five internal branches is, to our knowledge,
unprecedented; we conclude that it accurately represents the his-
torical relationships of these eight yeast taxa and will be referred to
hereafter as their species tree. The maximum support for a single
topology regardless of method of analysis is strongly suggestive of
the power of large data sets in overcoming the incongruence present
in single-gene analyses.

How much data are sufficient to recover the species tree?
The concatenated data recovered a tree with maximum support on
all branches, despite divergent levels of support for each branch
among single-gene analyses. This raises the question: at what size

values recovered from the three analyses of 106 genes is shown. Results from ML (blue)

bootstrap values from the three analyses are remarkably similar for most branches, on a

gene-by-gene basis there is no tight correspondence between bootstrap values from ML

and MP analyses (see Supplementary Information).

did the data set arrive at the species tree? To estimate the minimum
number of genes required to support the species tree (Fig. 4), we
randomly re-sampled and concatenated variable numbers of genes
from the 106-gene data set (Fig. 5; see also Supplementary Infor-
mation). Although the number of genes required to achieve a mean
bootstrap value .70% across all branches of the species tree was
only three concatenated genes, the variance in this estimate was high
(Fig. 5, right panels). The results show that in order to achieve a
mean bootstrap value of at least 70% with a 95% confidence
interval, eight concatenated genes were required. For a mean boot-
strap value of at least 95% with a confidence interval of 95%, the
number of concatenated genes rose to 20. These results show that
the number of genes sufficient to support all branches of the species
tree ranged from a minimum of 8 to 20 (Fig. 5, right panels),
depending on the threshold of statistical support required.

Because we observed a high variance in bootstrap values from
small numbers of concatenated genes, we sought to explore the
underlying source of this variance. It has been suggested that
nucleotides within a given gene do not evolve independently, thus
potentially influencing the phylogenetic accuracy of single genes16.
To test this hypothesis, we used a variable length bootstrap pro-
cedure in which a subset of orthologous nucleotides was randomly

re-sampled from the total data set with replacement. The results
show that with only 3,000 nucleotides, all five branches were
supported with a mean bootstrap value .70% and a confidence
interval of 95% (Fig. 5, left panels; see also Supplementary Infor-
mation). With 8,000 nucleotides, the mean bootstrap value rose to
.95% with a confidence interval of 95%. The average size of a gene
in our data set was 1,198 base pairs, so 3,000 randomly selected
nucleotides correspond to less than three concatenated genes.
Importantly, random nucleotides had much lower variance in
bootstrap values when compared with corresponding numbers of
concatenated genes. For example, with 3,000 nucleotides the mean
bootstrap value (^95% confidence interval) was 81.03 ^ 1.08 and
91.06 ^ 0.83 for branches 3 and 5, respectively, whereas with three
concatenated genes the corresponding bootstrap values were
74.36 ^ 11.69 and 70.98 ^ 18.48 (Fig. 5). The lower bootstrap
value and much higher variance for concatenated genes relative to
randomly re-sampled nucleotides is consistent with the hypothesis
that nucleotides within genes have not evolved independently16,30,40.

The results demonstrate that concatenation of a sufficient num-
ber of randomly selected genes overwhelms conflicting signals
present in different genes. It is important to determine whether a
consistent bias present in a subset of genes is also overcome by
concatenation. To test this possibility, we concatenated genes with
bootstrap values .50% for each of the alternative branches 6, 7 and
8 (Fig. 2). Each analysis yielded a majority-rule consensus tree with
.90% bootstrap values at most branches, but none of the trees was
congruent with that recovered from concatenation of the full data
set (Fig. 6). For example, the six genes that most strongly supported
S. castellii and S. kluyveri as sister taxa recovered these species as
sister taxa with 100% bootstrap values when concatenated (Fig. 6b).
All three trees in Fig. 6 also rejected all alternative topologies
generated by single-gene and concatenated analyses (Templeton
test, P , 0.001 for each of the three trees in Fig. 6). Hence, when
biased genes present in the data set were concatenated, strong and
misleading support for an alternative species tree was obtained.
Previous studies have shown that the concatenation of genes
that share some bias (for example, mitochondrial genes) can
produce strong support for the incorrect phylogeny30. Thus, con-
catenation of a large number of unlinked genes is clearly the
superior strategy.

Implications for resolution of phylogenies
Our results show that there is widespread incongruence between
phylogenies recovered from individual genes. Therefore reliance on
single or a small number of genes has a significant probability of
supporting incorrect relationships for the eight yeast taxa. Perhaps
surprisingly, none of the factors known or predicted to cause
phylogenetic error41 could systematically account for the observed

Figure 3 Extensive incongruence between trees derived from the 106 individual-gene

data sets. Pairwise comparisons between 50% majority-rule consensus trees from 106

single-gene ML analyses of nucleotide data (black bars), MP analyses of nucleotide data

(white bars), and MP analyses of amino acid data (grey bars) were categorized on the basis

of the minimum number of taxa that need to be removed for two trees to reach

congruence (x axis). For each of the analyses, the majority of pairwise comparisons

require the removal of two or more taxa before congruence is attained. Similar results are

obtained when the ML and MP trees from the analyses of the 106 genes are used (data

not shown).

incongruence, suggesting that there may be no good predictor of the
phylogenetic informativeness of genes. However, regardless of the
source of incongruence, concatenation of a sufficient number of
unlinked genes ($20 genes in this study) yields the species tree with
remarkable support.

These findings have important implications for many current
practices in molecular phylogenetics. A strict interpretation of our
data suggests that analyses based on single or a small number of
genes provide insufficient evidence for establishing or refuting
phylogenetic hypotheses. Furthermore, concatenations of small
numbers of genes that provide support for specific branches leads
to amplification of support for that branch, even if the branch is in
favour of an incorrect topology. For example, a recent phylogenetic
study of a concatenation of eight commonly used genes for 75
species belonging to the ‘Saccharomyces complex’ found a bootstrap
value of 69% in support of a sister group relationship between
S. paradoxus and S. mikatae42, a finding in sharp contrast to our
results. This may be accounted for by both the number and non-

independence of the set of genes examined. The unreliability of
single-gene data sets (or data sets composed of linked genes, such as
genes from the mitochondrial genome) stems from the fact that
each gene is shaped by a unique set of functional constraints
through evolution. Phylogenetic algorithms are sensitive to such
constraints30 and we show that with genome-wide sampling of
independently evolving genes such problems can be avoided. Of
course, the possibility exists that one or a few ‘lucky’ genes39 may
correctly reconstruct the phylogeny of a particular taxonomic group
but, in the absence of other data, the confidence in the conclusion
will be weak (Fig. 5).

It is only through analyses of a larger amount of sequence data
that confidence in the proposed phylogenetic reconstruction can be
obtained. In this phylogenetic analysis of eight yeast taxa, concat-
enated data sets of 20 genes are sufficient to provide very strong
(.95%) support for the species tree. It is possible that the eight
yeast taxa we have analysed represent a very difficult phylogenetic
case, atypical of the situations found in other groups. However, the

Figure 5 A minimum of 20 genes is required to recover .95% bootstrap values for each

branch of the species tree. a, b, The bootstrap values for branches 3 (a) and 5 (b) were

constructed from the concatenation of randomly re-sampled orthologous nucleotides (left)

or random subsets of genes (right) (for the remaining branches see Supplementary

Information). Each data point represents the mean and minus one confidence interval of

ten replicates (confidence interval values for left panels are not clearly visible due to

almost complete overlap with the mean). The species tree is recovered with robust

support (.95% bootstrap values in all branches at 95% confidence interval) by analyses

of a minimum of 20 concatenated genes. This same result is obtained using only 8,000

randomly selected orthologous nucleotides, indicating that nucleotides within genes

evolve non-independently. The variation associated with the confidence intervals in b (for

example, for branch 5 the data point for 25 genes has a larger confidence interval than

that for 20 genes) is due to the small number of replicates. Broken lines in each graph

represent a change in the linear values along the x axis. All analyses were performed

using MP.

amplification of bias. a–c, Concatenation of the ten single genes showing the highest

bootstrap values for a sister-group relationship between S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus

values for S. castellii being the most distant member of the ingroup (c) generates tree

topologies that are inconsistent with the species tree recovered from concatenation of 106

genes (Fig. 4). These results may be explained either by a systematic bias imposed by

analytical factors (for example, variable rates of nucleotide site evolution) misleading

phylogenetic algorithms to artefactually group certain taxa, or by the action of biological

factors (for example, certain genes having different genealogical histories from the

species owing to hybridization). Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap values (ML on

nucleotides/MP on nucleotides).

widespread occurrence of incongruence at all taxonomic levels
argues strongly against such a view6,8–10,21. Rather, we believe that
this group is a representative model for key issues that researchers in
phylogenetics are confronting.

Of course, in other cases the amount of sequence information
needed to resolve specific relationships will be dependent on the
particular phylogenetic history under examination. For example,
branches depicting speciation events separated by long time inter-
vals may be resolved with a small amount of data (perhaps branches
1 and 4 in our analyses), whereas branches depicting speciation
events separated by shorter intervals may be much harder to resolve.
In addition, phylogenetic reconstruction may be complicated by
factors such as taxon sampling17, variable rates of nucleotide site
evolution43, hybridization44, horizontal transfer45 and lineage sort-
ing of ancestral polymorphisms21. These factors may have an as yet
unpredictable effect on the amount of sequence data required for
accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of other taxonomic groups or
of larger numbers of taxa. Larger concatenated data sets have been
very powerful and persuasive in testing specific relationships (such
as monophyly of amoebae39 and rejection of Ecdysozoa46). The
results of our study suggest that use of genome-wide data sets may
provide unprecedented power not only in testing specific phylo-
genetic hypotheses but also in precise reconstruction of the histori-
cal associations of all the taxa analysed. A

Methods
Data set collection
Genes spaced approximately every 40 kilobases (kb) in the S. cerevisiae genome were
examined and retained for analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) had homologous
sequence in each of the eight species; (2) had at least two homologous flanking syntenic
genes; and (3) could be aligned over most of the protein. The species of the sensu strictu
group are thought to have undergone a whole-genome duplication35–37, so determination
of orthology was based on synteny. For S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus, synteny
relative to S. cerevisiae was determined by visual inspection using the synteny viewer
option in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (http://www.yeastgenome.org/). For
S. kudriavzevii, S. castellii and S. kluyveri, synteny was determined by tblastx comparisons
of the S. cerevisiae gene of interest, plus each of the two flanking genes. Genes were
considered as orthologues if the gene of interest and at least one of the two flanking genes
had significant tblastx scores (e-value ,0.001) and were found in close proximity to each
other in all genomes. For C. albicans, genes were retained if they were the best reciprocal
tblastx hits between both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. The genome databases for
S. kudriavzevii, S. castellii and S. kluyveri contain draft quality sequence providing 2–3
times coverage over 85–95% of each genome34. Therefore, some cases of segmental
duplications may have been missed; such cases would be rare and have had little, if any,
influence on our results. The selection of commonly used genes (actin, hsp70, b-tubulin,
RNA polymerase II, elongation factor 1-a and 18S rDNA) involved searching each genome
for the single best tblastx score (in cases of paralogy, the hit with the highest tblastx score
was considered as the orthologue). Many other commonly used genes were not analysed
because a copy was absent in at least one of the genome databases. Data sets are available
from the authors on request.

Phylogenetic analysis
Individual genes were aligned by codon using ClustalW47 as implemented in Bioedit
version 5.0.9 (ref. 48). All gene alignments were manually edited to exclude indels and
areas of uncertain alignment from further analysis. After this step, on average 76% of the
sequence of each gene was retained. All phylogenetic analyses were performed using
PAUP* version 4.0b10 (ref. 49). Each nucleotide data set was analysed under the
optimality criteria of maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP),
whereas the corresponding amino acid data sets were analysed using only MP. In both ML
and MP analyses, tree space was searched using the branch-and-bound algorithm, which
guarantees to find the optimal tree(s). Tree reliability under both optimality criteria was
assessed using non-parametric bootstrap re-sampling of 100 replicates; for a given data set,
bootstrap re-sampling for both ML and MP analyses started from the same seed number to
eliminate variance in the re-sampling procedure between the two optimality criteria.
Under MP all characters were equally weighted whereas under ML the model of sequence
evolution was optimized using likelihood ratio tests as implemented in Modeltest version
3.06 (ref. 50). Analyses of concatenated data sets were performed using MP (1,000
bootstrap replicates) and, in a subset of cases, ML (100 bootstrap replicates). Random
re-sampling of individual nucleotide sites from the complete 127-kb data set was
performed using the variable-length-bootstrap option in PAUP*49 and random gene
re-sampling using a random number generator. Incongruence was tested using
Templeton’s significantly less parsimonious test, and tree distances for all pairwise
comparisons among the 106 trees were calculated using two metrics (the agreement
subtree metric and the symmetric-difference metric) as implemented in PAUP*49. Data
sets and trees are available from the authors on request.
