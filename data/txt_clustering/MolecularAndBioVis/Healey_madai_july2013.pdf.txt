Perceptual Visualization

• Harness human visual 
system

• Layer data in 
“intelligent” ways

• Direct focus of attention
• Avoid perceptual 

blindness
• Build “optimal” 

visualizations semi-
automatically

Visual Interference

• Design, conduct, and analyze target detection experiments
• Study colour: luminance, hue; and texture: size, orientation

• Effectiveness of visual features in isolation, pairwise interference

Postattentive Amnesia

• Does previewing make us faster?
• Intuition suggests it will

• Extract detail
• Access it rapidly on demand

• Experiments show that human
vision does not work this way

• Vision is not a camera
• Detail is only available at the most

Change Blindness Models

• Overwriting
• previous image overwritten

• First impression
• initial view abstracted

• Nothing is stored
• scene abstracted with no detail

• Feature combination
• previous and new views

combined

• Everything is stored, nothing is compared
• details cannot be accessed without external stimulus

Inattentional Blindness

Inattentional Blindness

• Attention-demanding task 
renders viewers “blind” to change

• Change is easily seen if scene is 
viewed without any task

• Limited “visual attention”
• Classic example, counting 

basketball passes
• Woman wearing a gorilla suit walks 

through the scene
• More than half of the viewers do

not notice the gorilla

Familiarity & Gist

• “Real world” search highly efficient
• Elements are arranged in a learned, 

rule-governed manner

• “Gist,” basic scene category, is 
rapidly obtained

• Object recognition uses a limited-
capacity selective pathway

• Guided by classic guidance, e.g. local 
feature difference, feature search

• But perhaps also guided by “gist” cues 
from a non-selective pathway

Search for the loaf of bread

FAMILIARITY & GIST

• Can viewers detect the gist of a visualization?
• Can gist be learned?
• Is gist physically anchored? Is it locally spatial?

• Can gist be used to direct the focus of attention?
• Rapidly deploy attention to “most likely” locations for interesting or 

supporting evidence

• How does visual familiarity impact viewer performance?
• How is scene familiarity tied to other types of learning?



Nonphotorealism

• Visual system operates in two 
stages

• orientation: focus of attention snaps to 
a location in an image

• engagement: visual system chooses to 
linger at the location, taking in detail

• Local feature differences orient
• Hypothesize that increased visual 

aesthetic produces engagement
• Measure engagement using memory 

for detail

For each of the following images,
determine whether it matches

one of the images you memorized

Answer “Yes” if it does

Answer “no” if it does not

Initial Results

• Viewers memorized 12 images, recalled amongst 24 candidates
• Three of each “style:”  IC, ID, VC, glyph

• Varied time between memorization and recall
• Immediately, after 30 minute attention-demanding task, 24 hours

• Memory for detail predicted by aesthetic ordering
