Abstract
We present Gap Charts, a novel class of line charts designed for visualizing the evolution of rankings over time, with a
particular focus on sports data. Gap Charts show entries, e. g., teams participating in a competition, that are ranked over time
according to a performance metric like a growing number of points or a score. The main advantages of Gap Charts are that 1)
tied entries never overlap—only changes in rank generate limited overlap between time-steps; and 2) gaps between entries
show the magnitude of their score difference. We evaluate the effectiveness of Gap Charts for performing different types of
tasks, and find that they outperform standard time-dependent ranking visualizations for tasks that involve identifying and
understanding evolutions in both ranks and scores. Finally, we show that Gap Charts are a generic and scalable class of line
charts by applying them to a variety of different datasets.

1. Introduction
In this article, we are interested in visualizing the evolution of

rankings over time, with a particular focus on sports data. Most
athletic competitions rely on the ranking of individuals, teams,
or countries to determine outcome. These rankings are usually
based on performance metrics like scores, and can evolve over
time. Here, we chose to focus primarily on soccer competitions,
or championships, as they provide a realistic mainstream appli-
cation case for rank-based visualizations—soccer team rankings
are regularly published in newspapers or on the web, and broad-
casted on television.

During a championship, team rankings are updated after each
match-day, or time-step; each team’s rank depends on a score,
which reflects its total number of wins, draws, and losses. If
two teams have the same score at a given time-step, their rank is
determined by their goal difference, i. e., the difference between
goals scored and conceded. Every championship further uses a
specific ranking formula to ensure that every rank is occupied by
one (and only one) team (e. g., points, then goal difference, then
number of goals scored, then game result between the two tied
teams, then random). As a result, the ranking is tie-free: while
scores may be identical, ranks are always unique.

The most common representation for championship rankings
in mass media is a table. Tables can show teams ordered by rank
and display scores in cells [1]. However, they cannot convey
the magnitude of score differences, or the temporal evolution of
both ranks and scores [1, 2]. They also need to be updated or
re-created after each time-step.

A simple alternative is to use line charts. Here, we make a
distinction between Rank Charts (RC), which use the y axis to
encode ranks from top to bottom on an ordinal scale, similarly
to tables; and Score Charts (SC), which use the y axis to encode
scores that increase from bottom to top. Generally speaking, RC
have the advantage of being overlap-free (Figure 1(a)): teams,
or entries, are visually distinct at each time-step—although they
may intersect between time-steps as rankings change. This
makes ranks easy to distinguish. However, RC do not convey
the magnitude of scores, nor do they show ties (equal scores).
This can be problematic when trying to predict future rankings,
and ultimately a championship’s outcome. Conversely, SC con-
vey the magnitude of scores. This can help make predictions.
However, SC are not overlap-free when scores are tied, which
makes it impossible to determine unique ranks (Figure 1(b)).

To address these respective limitations, we introduce Gap
Charts (GC), a novel class of line charts which use the y axis to
encode both ranks from top to bottom, and scores from bottom to
top. The main originality of GC is that they use the gaps between
lines, i. e. the white space, to encode score magnitude. This
makes GC overlap-free (Figure 1(c)), as tied scores are simply
shown by adjacent entries, i. e., lines that are not separated by a
gap at a given time-step.

We evaluate the effectiveness of GC for performing rank-,
score-, and rank-and-score related tasks, by comparison with

RC and SC. We chose to focus primarily on static renderings
of GC, i. e., without possible additional interactive features, as
static charts are most common in mass-media publications on
soccer championships (and on athletic competitions in general).
Our results show that GC are most effective for rank-and-score
related tasks, and that they are a good tradeoff between RC and
SC for rank-alone and score-alone related tasks.

Finally, we extend our initial design of GC by exploring
possible interactive techniques that can alleviate our class of
line charts for tasks for which they are least effective. We also
assess the scalability of GC by applying them to a range of other
datasets. In summary, our main contributions are:

1. a formal distinction between RC and SC, two existing
classes of line charts;

2. the design and implementation of GC, a novel class of line
charts;

3. a comparative evaluation of GC, RC, and SC using real
data from the French soccer Ligue 1; and

4. the extension and generalization of GC using other/larger
datasets.

2. Background
Sports enthusiasts are generally accustomed to seeing sports

rankings in tables. Several studies have shown that tables are ef-
fective for simple tasks like value retrieval (see [2] for a review).
However, other previous work has shown that people interested
in soccer championships usually seek to perform complex syn-
optic tasks like analyzing trends and comparing patterns over
time [1]; and line charts have been found more efficient than
tables for performing such tasks [1, 2].

2.1. Formalizing the distinction between Rank
Charts and Score Charts

Slope graphs are a particular type of line chart that “compare
changes over time for a list of nouns located on an ordinal or
interval scale” (Figure 2(a)) [3]. They map the values of n en-
tries on m axes (or time-steps—m = 4 in Figure 2(a)), and draw
a connection between each entry’s values. Values are displayed
in boxes, i. e., horizontal white spaces or segments, at each time-
step. Connections show magnitudes of score differences. As
entries are plotted on an ordinal scale, values encoded along the
y axis can be either ranks or scores 1 2 3 4 5. We define Rank
Charts (RC) as a class of slope graphs that uses the y axis to
encode ranks, and Score Charts (SC) as a class of slope graphs
that uses the y axis to encode scores.

RC (Figure 1(a)) show each of the n entries at a unique rank
at every time-step m. The main advantages of RC are: 1) they
are overlap-free—assuming two entries cannot have the same
rank; and 2) they scale well, both for n and m. Figure 2(b) shows
an early use of RC from the beginning of the 19th century [4].
RC are also extensively used on the web 6, and come with many
variations. While RC clearly show changes in rank, they do
not show the magnitudes of score differences, nor do they show
tied entries—an important feature according to [5]. That said,
some designs have attempted to address the latter limitation by
grouping entries at a same rank on the ordinal axis 7. However,
this breaks the expected bijection mapping of entries to ranks.

SC (Figure 1(b)) show the scores for each of the n entries
at every time-step m. The main advantage of SC is that ranks
can be inferred from scores, as long as these are distinct (no
ties). If they are not, entries overlap, and ranks are impossible
to determine. SC also waste a great amount of white-space—
particularly in the top-left corner when all scores are low, if
scores start from 0 and increase monotonously—, and suffer
from scaling: the higher n, the more overlap.

Overall, we consider RC useful for showing ranks, and SC
useful for showing scores and the magnitude of their differences.

2.2. Other Ways of Visualizing Rankings
RankExplorer [6], which uses stacked area charts, and

LineUp [5], which enables interactive analysis of multidi-
mensional ranked entries, were developed to visualize time-
dependent rankings. Although they are powerful tools for per-
forming advanced queries, their visual and interaction complex-
ity is high, and we believe untrained people may find it difficult
to interpret and interact with them. Sports enthusiasts cannot
be expected to be visualization experts [7]; they may lack [1]
visualization literacy [8] and interaction propensity [9]. Hence
we focus primarily on static representations in this article.

Another recent work [10] has explored the combination of
tables and line charts for manipulating ranking tables. However,
as for the aforementioned tools, the benefits of this technique lie
in relatively complex interaction.

3. GapChart
We introduce Gap Charts (GC) as a novel class of slope graphs

which combines the advantages of both RC and SC. GC simul-
taneously show the temporal evolution of both ranks and scores,
as they are derived from a specific state in the continuous tran-
sition between an ‘ordinal rank’ y axis (RC) and a ‘continuous
score’ y axis (SC). Entries are represented by lines, composed
of boxes and links. Boxes show the value (rank and/or score)
of the entry at a given time-step, and links connect consecutive
boxes. Labels designate entries’ names.

By exploring the continuum between RC and SC, and by
tuning each component, we identified the following defining
characteristics for GC:

C1 the y axis encodes both ranks and score, and the score
magnitudes are shown in the gaps between lines;

C2 tied entries are made visually distinct by keeping equal
scores at a given time-step adjacent, i. e., with no gap be-
tween lines, which keeps the chart overlap-free;

C3 the result is less compact than RC, but more than SC.

Figure 3 shows a gap chart of the Spanish Liga 2013–2014.
The chart illustrates how three teams are clearly better than the
others, most of which simply struggle to avoid being demoted.
There is a clear gap between the top-three teams that qualify
for the Champions League and the rest. This gap appears early
in the championship, and continuously increases until the end.
There is some competition among the top-three, as they change
ranks several times during the second half of the championship.
They also finish with very small gaps between them—in fact,
FC Barcelona and Real Madrid are tied, i. e., adjacent, at the
end of the championship. Their final rank was determined by
their goal difference. A second group of teams, from 4th to 7th,
fights for 4th place, and Athletic Bilbao is seen to resist until
the end. Betis Sevilla however seems destined to be demoted
early on, while the two other teams of the bottom trio remain
very uncertain throughout the championship.

3.1. Layout Algorithm
We created a simple algorithm for describing RC, SC, and

GC in a unified way. Our generic layout function takes a factor
F ∈ [0,1] as a parameter to compute the vertical position of
boxes over time. F expresses the continuum between RC and
SC: F = 0 creates a RC, and F = 1 creates a SC. Given:

H the height of the canvas
E the set of entries
T the set of time-steps

RANK(en, tm) the rank of en at tm
SCORE(en, tm) the score of en at tm

m = Min(SCORE(Ei,Tj)) i ∈ |E|, t ∈ |T |
M = Max(SCORE(Ei,Tj)) i ∈ |E|, t ∈ |T |
h the height of entries

The vertical position y of an entry En,n∈ |E| at each time-step
tm,m ∈ |T | is computed as follows:

yR = H
RANK(e,t)
|E|

yS = H(1− 1|E|h )(1−
SCORE(e,t)−m

M−m )

y = (1−F)yR +FyS
For a soccer championship, m = 0 and M is the score of

the team ranked 1st at the last time-step. yR is the y position
according to ranks; yS is the y position according to scores.
Setting F = 0 implies y = yR and produces RC; setting F = 1
implies y = yS and produces SC; and setting F = 1− 1n and
h = Hn|E| ensures C1, C2, and C3 and produces GC.

3.2. Rendering Rationale
RC, SC and GC share several adjustable rendering parameters.

These are: box width and height, link curvature (from a straight
line to a “S” shape), link height at extremities and at inflection
point (from very thin to same as box height), shading, and labels
positioning. Each parameter is described in Figure 4.

According to Tufte, data graphics should maximize their data-
ink ratio [3]. This suggests that any class of slope graph should
avoid large link heights and colors—as a priori these do not

encode information. Figure 2(a) respects this principle: links are
rendered as straight lines (no curvature) with a continuously thin
height at extremities and inflection point. There is no shading,
and the labels (numeric values) are shown in every box.

Our choice of rendering for GC (see Figure 3) clearly violates
the data-ink ratio principle. However, it is based on a number
of application-domain-driven rationales, as well as on a short
qualitative evaluation, which we describe below.

An important specificity of soccer championship rankings
is that scores never decrease—they only increase at a steady,
pre-defined pace. Teams gain 3 points for winning a match, 1 for
drawing, and 0 for losing. As such, focusing on a unique team’s
score variations, i. e., on the slope of connections, is of little
interest. However, being able to follow the evolution of a team
as it changes ranks is crucial. This is why we display entries as
continuous lines, where links and boxes smoothly alternate.

In addition, we follow standard color-coding for soccer cham-
pionships: we use blue for the three top-ranked teams at the end
of the championship—as they qualify for the European Cham-
pion’s League—, yellow for the fourth team—as it qualifies
for the Europa League—, and red for the three bottom-ranking
teams—as they are demoted to the minor league.

To further tune the different rendering parameters described
in Figure 4, we asked six volunteers to order 3 classes of charts
(RC, SC, and GC) ∗ 5 rendering parameters = 15 series of three
parameter variations according to aesthetic preference and legi-
bility. We wanted to ensure that the charts would be appealing to
unfamiliar viewers (e. g., sports enthusiasts). Preference orders
were given on 1–3 Likert-like scales, with the possibility of
giving equal preferences. Variations were:

• link shape: straight line, weak curvature, strong curvature;
• link height at extremities: very thin, medium, same height

as boxes;
• link height at inflection point: very thin, medium, continu-

ous (i. e. same height as boxes);
• shading: none, low, strong; and
• labels: origin/middle/end of chart, full name where boxes

are wide enough, repeated initials in every box.

For legibility, we instructed participants to focus on how
easy/difficult each rendering variation made it to identify:

• a lumped group of teams;
• the gap between two or more teams;
• the evolution of a team’s rank over time; and
• the stability of a team’s score over time 8.

We first inspected the legibility scores. We then confronted
the most legible variations with their aesthetic preference scores.
Because both orders were similar for all three classes, i. e., for
RC, SC, and GC, we decided to keep one rendering configu-
ration: weak curvature, stroke widths at extremities the same
size as the boxes, medium stroke widths at link inflection points,
low level of shading, and full name labels where boxes are wide
enough. Generally speaking, we found that thick lines were
preferred over thin ones. Thus, we stress that although the data-
ink ratio principle suggests the use of thin lines, thick lines and
repeated labels were perceived as more effective.

Some of these design takeaways may seem counter-intuitive.
In particular, existing charts usually emphasize the use of thin
lines. However, thick lines and repeated labels make it easier to
follow entries over time, especially when the number of entries
is high. In addition, for GC, line thickness has to be a ratio of the
chart height to ensure that entries with tied scores are adjacent—
one of the main features of GC. While the line thickness / chart
height could be reduced, it would be at the cost of legibility.
Finally, comparing ranks is the main focus of our paper, and
existing representations of ranked entries often use similarly
thick lines 9 10 .

4. Evaluation
We evaluated the effectiveness of GC for performing rank-,

score-, and rank-and-score related tasks, by comparing them
with RC and SC. We used real soccer data form 33 seasons
of the French Ligue 1, a national championship in which 20
teams (entries) confront each other twice, over a period of 38
match-days (time-steps).

Comparing GC with RC and SC may not seem ideal, since
RC are specifically designed to show only ranks, SC to show
only scores, and GC to show both. However, the lack of ex-
isting alternative designs to GC for showing both ranks and
scores simultaneously prevents us from establishing a proper
baseline condition. By default, it is impossible to perform score-
related tasks using RC, and it can be very difficult to perform
rank-related tasks using SC. To alleviate these limitations, we
designed a set of ‘hover’ inspectors. While our main focus is on
static representations—which cannot include such ‘lightweight’
interactions—we wanted to make sure score-related tasks would

8 These features are individually inspired by the tasks we later used in our
evaluation of GC, described in Section 4.

changes-over-time/

10http://in.somniac.me/2010/01/fortune-500-visualization/

be possible to perform with RC, and that rank-related tasks could
be performed without too much effort with SC.

We then selected four tasks based on different visual proper-
ties of each class of charts, which we found to be frequent and/or
important in related work. We also made sure these would be
meaningful for sports rankings. Tasks were:

T1 determine the longest period during which teams Ti and Tj
have the same score;

T2 determine when the score difference between the teams
ranked ri and ri+1 was the highest;

T3 determine how many changes occur at rank ri; and

T4 determine the longest period during which the score of
team Ti stays the same.

Based on Andrienko et al.’s task taxonomy for time-dependent
data [11], Perin et al. [1] have found that comparing teams (T1,
T2) and detecting trends (T3, T4) are important tasks in the
analysis of a soccer championship. Similarly, Gratzl et al. [5]
have found that comparing entries’ scores and slopes over time
(T1, T2, T4), as well as retrieving specific ranks and tied ranks
(T3) are frequent tasks related to ranked entries.

4.1. Inspector Designs
As previously discussed, both RC and SC have several limita-

tions. Score-related tasks are impossible to perform with RC, as
scores are not indicated. Likewise, rank-related tasks are diffi-
cult to perform with SC, as entries with identical scores overlap.
Thus, although our primary goal is to assess the efficiency of
each technique for static representations, we designed a set of
inspectors to enhance RC and SC for our experiment. The ratio-
nale was that: 1) the experiment would be extremely frustrating
for participants if one third of the tasks were impossible to per-
form; and 2) GC would be optimal for static representations if
the technique outperformed the enhanced/interactive versions of
RC and SC. By adding inspectors to each class, we expected to
maximize accuracy at the expense of increasing the amount of
time spent to perform tasks.

We first designed a basic inspector for all classes of charts—
the tooltip inspector—to display an entry’s full name, rank,
score, and goal difference on hover. This inspector also shows
the time-step corresponding to the mouse cursor’s x coordinate.
As RC do not show scores, we then designed a specific scores
inspector to display the scores of all entries at a time-step. Simi-
larly, as SC do not show ranks, we also designed a specific ranks
inspector to displays the ranks of all teams at a time-step. The
scores and ranks inspectors enable quick comparison of the val-
ues of several entries at a time. Meanwhile, the tooltip inspector
only allows for inspection of one entry at a time. Figure 5 shows
the different inspectors.

inspector and the scores inspector. For SC (center), both the
tooltip inspector and the ranks inspector. For all, the tooltip

4.2. Hypotheses
For each task Ti, we formulated two hypotheses Hia/b. Here,

we refer to each task in the form of a question (which we asked
participants), and propose the following coding for hypotheses:
A > B means that we hypothesize participants will be more
accurate using A than B, and will respond more quickly using
A than B if the accuracy rate is similar. All tasks involved
analyzing one season of the championship, i. e., 20 entries over
38 time-steps. T1 and T2 required focusing both on ranks and
scores; T3 only on ranks; and T4 only on scores.

T1 What is the longest period during which teams Ti and Tj
had the same score?

H1a GC > RC
H1b GC > SC
Rationale: using GC, T1 simply consists in finding the longest

segment during which the two entries have no gap between
them (adjacent entries); using RC, T1 requires the scores
inspector, as RC do not convey scores; and using SC, T1
requires the tooltip inspector, as entries with the same
score overlap.

T2 When is the score difference between the team ranked ri and
ri+1 the highest?

H2a GC > RC
H2b GC = SC
Rationale: using GC, T2 simply consists in finding the biggest

gap between the two entries; using RC, T2 requires using
the scores inspector; and using SC, T2 should require the
same strategy as using GC.

T3 How many changes occurred at rank ri?
H3a GC < RC
H3b GC > SC
Rationale: using GC, T3 consists in following the line ending

at the given rank (starting from the end), and counting and

moving up one line every time there is a crossing; using
RC, T3 simply consists in horizontally following the rank,
and counting the number of times it is crossed; and using
SC, T3 requires the ranks inspector.

T4 What is the longest period during which the score of team
Ti stayed the same?

H4a GC > RC
H4b GC < SC
Rationale: using GC, T4 requires the tooltip inspector, as en-

tries with invariant scores may change ranks; using RC,
T4 requires the scores inspector; and using SC, T4 simply
consists in finding the entry’s longest horizontal segment.

4.3. Procedure
We recruited 12 unpaid participants (1 female), aged 19–39

(mean=28), who were not involved in the pre-study. All were
students or university staff, and had at least some basic knowl-
edge of soccer championships and of line charts. The experi-
ment was conducted on a desktop computer equipped with a
mouse, a keyboard, and a 30” LCD display with a resolution of
2560x1600 pixels—charts were 1272 pixels wide and 750 pixels
high. Participants first filled out a short background survey, and
answered general questions about soccer. They were given the
correct answer for each question, to ensure full comprehension
of the ranking process (e. g., number of teams in the champi-
onship, number of points gained for winning, drawing, or losing
a match, etc.). They were then given a sheet of instructions.

The experiment was blocked by class of charts (RC, SC,
GC). Each block consisted of four trials—one for each task
(T1, T2, T3, T4)—repeated five times. Blocks and trials were
counterbalanced. Dependent variables were accuracy (number
of correct answers) and efficiency (time spent answering). The
full factorial design was as follows:

12 participants
× 3 classes (RC,SC,GC)
× 4 tasks (T 1,T 2,T 3,T 4)
× 5 repetitions

720 trials

Before each block, participants were prompted with the new
class, and were invited to ask any questions they might have
about the visual representation. Before each trial, a toy exam-
ple explained the task. All tasks were restricted to the second
half of a championship, i. e., to the right half of the charts (see
Figure 3), as ranks vary too much during the first half—because
all teams start with 0 points. This ensured a consistent difficulty
level across datasets and comparable trials. Repetitions were
limited to 30 seconds, and participants were allowed to “skip” a
repetition if it was considered too difficult. The use of inspec-
tors was allowed, and responses were submitted using a text
field. The correct response was displayed after each repetition.
Finally, after each trial, participants were asked to evaluate on

1–5 Likert scales the difficulty of the task, their confidence in
their responses, and the suitability of the class of charts for the
task. Overall the experiment lasted approximately 45 minutes.

4.4. Results
In order to assess the accuracy and time of performing tasks

with the three classes of charts, we base our analyses on es-
timation, i.e., effect sizes with bootstrapped [12] confidence
intervals [13] (see Figure 6). Using effect sizes with confidence
intervals is recommended by the APA [14], and for reporting
statistical results in HCI [15] over the traditional null hypothesis
significance testing.

We first compared accuracy rates between classes of charts. If
we found no clear difference, we removed timed out and skipped
trials and inspected efficiency. Note that in the experiment de-
sign, we had highlighted entries that participants were required
to focus on in T1 and T4 to avoid measuring any extra time spent
finding those entries.

For T1, there is strong evidence that GC are roughly twice
as accurate as RC (H1a); and while there is little evidence that
GC are more accurate that SC, there is evidence that they are
more efficient (H1b), i. e., the task was completed on average
1.2 times faster using GC.

For T2, there is strong evidence that GC are roughly 75%
more accurate than RC (H2a); and there is evidence that GC are
more accurate than SC (H2b), although the effect size is less
important.

For T3, there is evidence that GC are less accurate and effi-
cient than RC (H3a); but there is strong evidence that GC are
more accurate than SC (H3b).

Finally for T4, there is no evidence that GC are more accurate
than RC, and only little evidence that they are more efficient
(H4a); and there is strong evidence that GC are less accurate

and efficient than SC (H4b).
Figure 7 shows the questionnaire results formatted using Berti-

fier [16]. These are consistent with the accuracy and efficiency
analyses. GC were considered well-suited for T1 and T2, which
were easy to perform. Responses were more mitigated for T3
and T4, although there is no strong trend against GC. RC were
considered ill-suited T1 and T2, well-suited for T3, and re-
sponses were mitigated for T4. SC received enthusiastic feed-
back for T1 and T4, more mitigated responses for T2, and were
considered ill-suited for T3.

4.5. Discussion
H1a is clearly supported by our results. While H1b is also

supported, we had expected to see a bigger difference between
GC and SC. We attribute the little evidence of a difference in
accuracy to the fact that we had initially highlighted entries for
comparison. In a less artificial setting with no highlights, SC
would suffer from visual clutter, and the potentially overlapping
entries of interest would be harder to find and follow. This would
not be the case with GC, as they are overlap-free.

H2a is also clearly supported by our results. H2b however
is not, as we had expected results to be similar for GC and SC.
We attribute the evidence that GC are more accurate than SC to
the fact that GC show score magnitude landmarks (the lightgray
horizontal lines in Figure 1(c)). These convey the relative score
differences between consecutively ranked entries. In contrast,
SC show absolute landmarks (the lightgray horizontal lines in
Figure 1(b)). These only convey the absolute scores of entries,
and not the differences between them.

H3a is supported. We expected RC to outperform GC be-
cause they use stable ordinal vertical positions, which result
in generally horizontal lines—except between time-steps when
rankings change. Using RC, T3 simply consisted in following a

straight horizontal line along the provided rank, and counting
the number of times it was crossed. Vertical positions are not as
stable in GC, as they also continuously increase to show scores.
This is even more true for SC, which is why H3b is so clearly
supported by our results.

H4a is only partially supported, and the effect is small. We
attribute the lack of evidence of a difference in accuracy be-
tween GC and RC to the efficacy of the scores inspector. It
enabled score extraction in RC, which would otherwise have
been impossible—unlike in GC. H4b however is clearly sup-
ported. We expected SC to outperform GC because using the
former class, T4 simply consisted in finding the longest hor-
izontal segment for the provided entry. The task was not as
straightforward using GC, as entries with invariant scores may
change vertical position according to changes in rank. For ex-
ample, a soccer team A that has a stable score over a certain

period may be challenged by another team B that obtains the
same score after winning a match. If team B’s goal difference
is higher than team A’s, then team A will be reclassified at a
rank below team B. Visually, this would result in a break in the
horizontal line representing the team, even though the team’s
score remains unchanged.

Overall, our results show that RC are best suited for rank-
related tasks, SC for score-related tasks, and GC for rank-and-
score related tasks. This makes sense, as each class of charts is
designed to facilitate its respective type of tasks. However, we
have found that GC are a good tradeoff for performing all types
of tasks—especially if interaction is disabled. Although scores
cannot be precisely determined using static GC, we argue that
score-values are generally not a first class characteristic of sports
rankings—ranks come first, gaps between consecutive entries
come second, and scores come last (usually to discriminate
ties). Finally, it is interesting to point out that while the scores
inspector worked very well for T4 using RC, the ranks inspector
was ineffective for T3 using SC (see Figure 6).

Based on our results, we have established the following list
of recommendations:

• GC should be used for rank-and-score related tasks. RC
should not.

• RC are most effective for rank-related tasks, but GC provide
a good alternative. SC should not be used.

• SC are most effective for score-related tasks, but GC pro-
vide an alternative. RC may be used if a scores inspector is
implemented.

On a higher level, we recommend using GC over the other
classes for static representations, as GC are more generic. How-
ever, interactively transitioning between RC, GC, and SC using
our layout algorithm should prove optimal in situations where
interaction is possible.

5. Extensions and Future Work
Participants in our experiment—especially the soccer

enthusiasts—suggested developing a way to visualize cham-
pionships with a focus on a particular team. To address this, we
extended our initial design of GC to include an advanced entry
focus interaction (Figure 8).

We also used GC to visualize a range of other datasets, includ-
ing data from other sports, academia, economics, and politics.
All examples are available at http://newcol.free.fr/.
This variety allowed us to assess the scalability of static ren-
derings of GC, as well as the importance of finding ways to
visualize missing data.

5.1. Entry Focus Interaction
For interactive versions of GC, double clicking on an entry

e sets it as the focus entry. The chart animates to a ‘focus-
centered’ state, where the baseline for the y scale transitions
from the minimal value in the dataset to the origin of e. The

line showing e is thus represented as it would be in a slope
graph, with the vertical position of boxes showing e’s score at
each time-step. This facilitates tasks like T4, as they can be
performed like using SC. All other entries are laid out according
to the baseline, and the vertical distance between e and any other
team encodes the score difference between them.

As several participants in our experiment later asked to visu-
alize the causes of change, we also added visual cues (green and
red vertical bars) for each game played by e. Each bar links e
with its opponent at the corresponding time-step. Green bars en-
code wins, gray bars draws, and red bars losses. Figure 8 shows
this information. We see that e won most of its games against
teams ranked lower, and lost to most teams ranked higher. e also
had difficulties winning several games in a row.

5.2. Generalization and Scalability
As GC are a generic class of slope graphs, we were able to

apply them to various other time-dependent ranking datasets.
Here, we discuss the generalization and scalability of static
renderings of GC through two examples.

Figure 9 shows the evolution of 198 cyclists’ (entries) rank-
ings after each of the 21 stages (time-steps) of the Tour de France.
The magnitude landmarks (thin gray lines) represent 1 minute
gaps between cyclists. Colors encode cyclists’ nationality, and
stage miniatures provide context at the top. The chart clearly
shows that many changes occurred in the rankings during the
second stage of the race, which means this stage was key. After
that, rankings remained stable for three stages, before changing
dramatically once again. Tour de France enthusiasts will also
see that ‘flat terrain stages’ generally do not impact rankings
or gap magnitudes, whereas ‘mountain stages’ strongly impact
both.

Figure 10 shows the evolution of the top 100 universities’
(entries) rankings over 10 years (time-steps), according to the
ARWU Shanghai University Ranking. Colors encode world
regions (North America in purple, Europe in orange, Asia in
green, and unclassified in dark gray). The most immediate
observation is that the entry ranked first (Harvard University)
is far above all others. Below that, several universities struggle

for the top-5 ranks, while competition is fierce at the bottom
of the ranking. Nearly half the top-100 universities are North
American; only five European and two Asian universities are
among the first third. It is also interesting to point out that
rankings varied a lot between 2003 and 2005. This was simply
due to modifications of the ranking formula.

A specific issue raised by this latter example is that data are
sometimes incomplete for certain entries (e. g., the universities
shown in dark gray). This is typically the case when entries enter
and/or leave the ranking at a given time-step. We can think of
several ‘off the bat’ strategies to visualize the presence of miss-

ing data, including changing the color (as we have done here),
using dashed-lines, or applying sketchy renderings. However,
we stress more work is needed to determine best practices.

Overall, these two examples show that although individual
entries may be hard to discern and follow when their number
increases, interesting and important trends can still be detected.
Ultimately, the most limiting factor in the scaling of static GC
is the size of the screen or or of the paper on which they are
displayed/printed.

6. Conclusions
In this article, we have proposed a formal distinction between

Rank Charts (RC) and Score Charts (SC), two previously ex-
isting classes of slopegraphs for visualizing time-dependent
rankings. Rank Charts are effective for visualizing ranks, and
Score Charts for visualizing scores. However, both techniques
are limited when it comes to visualizing the other dimension.

We have introduced Gap Charts (GC) as a novel class of
slopegraphs to address these limitations. GC show both ranks

and scores, ensure no overlap at each time-step, and make it
possible to identify tied entries.

We have evaluated the effectiveness of GC for performing
rank-, score-, and rank-and-score related tasks. Our results
show that GC are most effective for latter type of tasks, and that
they are a good tradeoff between RC and SC for performing
rank-alone and score-alone related tasks.

Using GC to visualize a wide range of different datasets has
raised a set of new challenges and opportunities. Considering
interaction, we have explored the possibility of focusing on a
particular entry. This should alleviate GC for score-related tasks,
which by default are most difficult.

Overall, we believe this work provides evidence that semi
space-filling visualizations have unique properties, which raises
the question as to whether they can be applied to other families
of data graphics.
