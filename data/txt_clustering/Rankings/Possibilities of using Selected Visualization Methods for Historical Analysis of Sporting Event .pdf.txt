aBstract: Nowadays, we are facing an enormous amount of data which are being produced by different systems. 
These must be effectively stored and visualized in order to enable their proper interpretation. In our research, we 
attempted to use circular data visualization applied on the Tour de France cycling race. Since this competition has 
over 100 years of history, a variety of data is available. Using the chord diagrams we tried to illustrate the long-term 
development of this race, with an emphasis on its spatial and sport aspects. Spatial dimension is characterised by the 
large number of stages and mountain climbs in such locations which altogether enhance the meaning of this major 
sporting event, while sport aspects aim to capture the significant personages on the scorecard. Circular visualization 
has found its application in many disciplines (genetics, demography, medicine, etc.). In our contribution, we point 
out its importance also in the visualization of the historical milestones of the most important multi-stage cycling event 
in the world.

Introduction

The Tour de France is one of the most signifi-
cant global sporting events, and also a worldwide 
social phenomenon. Since its first edition in 1903, 
many changes, which are related to the technolo-
gy, organizational and social aspects of the rele-
vant time segment have been made. From the very 
beginning, the Tour de France has enjoyed a large 
audience among both the general public and pro-
fessionals. One of the results of this is many publi-
cations dealing with different aspects of the Tour 
de France. A considerable emphasis on the spatial 
perspective of Tour de France is observed in the 
contributions of Fumey (2006), Campos (2003), 

and Reed (2007). The authors of these papers de-
vote significant attention to linking the race and 
its impact on the space where the Tour de France 
is organized. In addition to the spatial aspect, 
also studies analyzing the event in specific broad 
areas, mainly the economic aspect Reed (2003), 
Desbordes (2007), the social aspect (Balduck et al. 
2011), or last but not least, the physiological aspect 
(Lucia et al. 2003), get into the issue. The history of 
Tour de France can be recorded in different ways. 
Most of the publications map the overall history 
of the race (Mignot 2015, McGann and McGann 
2006, 2008), whereas several were published 
on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the 
event (Dauncey and Hare 2003, Wheatcroft 2005,

Whittle 2003). Other publications focused on 
specific aspects of the Tour de France, which are 
necessarily linked with this event. They are publi-
cations and contributions dealing with particular 
stages (Allchin and Bell 2003), important legends 
and cyclists (Fife 2008), or demanding mountain 
stages (Sidwells 2009) and significant mountain 
crossings and hills (Yates 2006), which make this 
event attractive even from the viewers’ point of 
view. One of specific issues in the Tour de France 
history is also that of doping, which was detailed 
in the papers of Schneider (2006) and Mignon 
(2003). This topic is also discussed very frequent-
ly today and presents a specific research issue not 
only in the field of cycling but also in the field of 
sport. The geographic dimension of the event is 
accented in the work of P. Boury (1987), where 
he focused primarily on selected spatial aspects 
of Tour de France. Therefore the Tour de France 
history going back to the early 20th century pro-
vides us with preconditions to be recorded and 
presented in the most transparent possible form. 
With its grandiosity and interest, the Tour de 
France has markedly gone beyond its national 
sphere, thus becoming a global event, albeit one 
which always keeps its basic identity. Scientific 
contributions focus considerably on analyses of 
this sporting event from different research per-
spectives. One of them is the spatial perspective 
that we will attempt to present in the paper, using 
technologies applied for the distribution of spatial 
data. The actual relation between geography and 
sports is strong attention devoted in the works of 
Bale (1994, 2003), High and Hinch (2006). These 
studies accentuate the importance of geograph-
ic research in the study of sport events of global 
importance. In addition to our cartographic inter-
pretation, we also visualized spatial and statisti-
cal data with diagrams developed based on the 
Circos project. It allows the data circular visuali-
zation in various research fields. These diagrams 
are often used by visualization in the field of bi-
ology and genetics, as exemplified by the studies 
of krzywinski (2009), Russell (2010), Darzentas 
(2010), and Ledford (2010). However, recently 
this method of visualization has also been applied 
in social sciences where space plays an important 
role. An example could be the studies of Abel and 
Sander (2014), as well as Sander et al. (2014), in 
which migration data are shown in this interest-
ing manner.

Research objectives

In the preceding part, we pointed out many 
different approaches revealing the Tour de 
France’s position in the global context. One of 
the methods with which the history of Tour de 
France can be studied is the geographically based 
approach.

Geography as a disciplinary field uses many 
advanced methods for the collection and distri-
bution of various data. One of the main means 
of expression for geographical information is the 
cartographic interpretation of phenomena in the 
form of a map output. At present, a high quantity 
of tools and techniques can be used for the devel-
opment, preparation and final processing, only 
in standard printed form, but also in the online 
environment.

From its origination in 1903 to the present, the 
Tour de France has included many stages and 
mountain ascents in its itinerary. Significant stage 
centres and legendary mountains passes contrib-
ute considerably to the exceptional position of 
this event in the sporting world. Not many sport-
ing events have such a high variability of possible 
places for direct sports competitions. Many sport-
ing events require direct investments in the de-
velopment of necessary sports grounds and rel-
evant infrastructure (stadiums, race circuits, golf 
courses, etc.). On the contrary, Tour de France 
races are held in the places of everyday life, uti-
lizing the existing infrastructure in the country 
with minimum direct investments in the region 
concerned. However, from the point of organiza-
tion and logistics, it is very difficult to organize 
such an event as there are struggles of cyclists in 
a different environment on a daily basis. This is 
preceded by many months’ preparation of the 
complete itinerary covering, among other things, 
a detailed organization of transport in the plac-
es concerned, the routing and an exact schedule 
for the movement of an accompanying convoy, 
the development of the “stage city” at the stage 
finishes or starts, providing the technical infra-
structure required for the transmission, and many 
other activities. Thus the area where the Tour de 
France is performed presents an important part of 
this global event. In the context of sporting perfor-
mance, mainly the relevant cyclists’ performance 
is monitored, either in transit flat terrain stag-
es with the mass finish of the entire peloton, or, 



 POSSIBIlITIeS OF USING SeleCTeD VISUAlIzATION MeTHODS FOr HISTOrICAl ANAlySIS OF SPOrTING eVeNT 7

on the contrary, in competitions in sharp Alpine 
or Pyrenean ascents. From 1903 to the present, 
several thousands of cyclists stood at the start of 
these races, but only some of them indelibly went 
down in the history of this event.

When developing this paper, we asked the 
key question: How is it possible to present the 
most important historical aspects of the selected 
sporting event (the Tour de France) in an effec-
tive and interesting manner? These aspects can 
be perceived in the form of two basic dimensions 
– both spatial and sports. The spatial dimension 
is understood as the identification of the most 
important stages and mountain ascents which 
have a significant presence in the history of this 
race. The sports dimension can be perceived as 
the identification of the most successful rides 
and countries in the Tour de France history. By 
linking these two dimensions (the spatial and 
the sports) we will reveal a new, possible pres-
entation of Tour de France history1. In addition 
to this output, the developed website (tdfrance.
eu), which shows many historical data from the 
Tour de France in interactive form, is an im-
portant part of the paper. It is the online envi-
ronment which presents one of possibilities for 
dynamic representation of the results of such an 
extensive data set. Such an approach can be used 
for the analysis of any other sporting event in 
which space constitutes a significant component 
of its history. Naturally, the methods used can 
find their place in any research in which effective 
processing and subsequent visualization of (not 
only) geographical data in printed or online form 
is inevitable.

A brief description of the use and an active 
presentation of methods used in geographical 
research and in analysing the rich history of a 
sporting event can be understood as the key ob-
jective of the paper. We will attempt to reveal cer-
tain specific features of this important event with 
these methods and to discover the time and spa-
tial peculiarities of Tour de France from its orig-
ination to the present. The main output, in ad-
dition to the contribution, is also a cartographic 
interpretation of Tour de France history, as well 
as the presentation of the results obtained. This

downloaded at http://www.tdfrance.eu/download/

we also consider useful in the dissemination of 
research results as the Internet has a major social 
impact and the visual interpretation of results in 
such an environment is available for any popula-
tion group.

Methods

The presentation of the methodology forms 
the key part of the paper. We can also include 
the map, which expresses the above stated link-
ing of the spatial and sports dimensions of Tour 
de France (see the Chapter Map design), as the 
main output. The methods used in geographical 
research are not limited only to the printed (or of-
fline) expression of a phenomenon under review. 
Various methods of the visualization of phenom-
ena on the Internet are part of advanced methods. 
Here, tools designed for the storage and effective 
handling of data (the database system), and vari-
ous visualization methods allowing clients to see 
the characteristics dynamically, can be consid-
ered as highly important. In this chapter, we will 
deal briefly with the most important character-
istics of particular methods which preceded the 
development of the final map output.

Data processing

The final map development was preceded by 
an extensive process covering the processing of 
historical data from particular Tour de France edi-
tions. For the purpose of efficient data handling, 
as well as due to the attempt to distribute the ob-
tained results on the Internet in the form of a web-
site dedicated to the Tour de France2, a database 
containing 10 tables and 76 attributes (Fig. 1) has 
been developed. In order to visualize particular 
statistics on a map, the most important step was 
to allocate geographical coordinates to particu-
lar stages and mountain ascents. To this end, we 
primarily applied the Google geocoding service. 
Google earth environment was used to localise 
mountain ascents or incorrectly allocated coordi-
nates with specific places, in which case particular 
coordinates were corrected manually. In general,

within 103 Tour de France editions organized 
up till now, we can identify a total of 682 stages 
and 287 categorised mountain ascents3. The de-
sign of database tables and the spatial reference of 
particular places was a basis for the cartographi-
cal preparation of the final map. For the purposes 
of selecting the required data from the database, 
standard SQl orders were applied, whereas par-
ticular selections of required data shown on the 
map were prepared using PHP and MySQl.

Database tables were designed to allow effec-
tive handling of these data on the created web-
site. An important consideration in the design 
was the fact that these attributes saved in tables 
must allow answering any questions related to 
the history of the race under review. The standard 
SeleCT command, based on which we obtain the 
final presentation of necessary data, was used for 
particular queries. A basic example of the use for 
practical questions can be found in Table 1.

The website (tdfrance.eu) is designed so 
that a majority of answers to these questions is

available to clients who are interested in such 
information. Certain functions and attributes 
are available to the administrators only; how-
ever, their implementation is only a question of 
the presentation of the function on the specific 
subpage.

Chord Diagrams

The chord diagrams were used to illustrate 
the quantity of achievements of relevant cyclists 
or nations in a specific stage or mountain ascent 
on a main map document. In this case, data from 
the database were stored (after the relevant selec-
tion taking into account the necessary criteria) as 
simple *.txt files. The diagrams were developed 
using the Circos project, the author of which is 
Martin krzywinski (Genome Sciences Centre, 
Vancouver). The primary aim of the Circos pro-
ject was circular genome visualization, however, 
such an interpretation also has a wide-ranging 
application in other scientific disciplines. This 
form of data processing can be interpreted eas-
ily and intuitively and, in combination with the 
map visualization, constitutes an interesting tool

for the presentation of a high quantity of not only 
genome data but also spatial data. Diagrams gen-
erated through the online service4 could be later 
modified as necessary in appropriate software 
(for example CorelDraw).

The internal structure of a cyclist´s victo-
ries (and nationalities) in each finish places and 
mountain ascents, is captured by using a circular 
visualization, in the form of chord diagrams. This 
form of presentation is interesting and allows the 
display of large amounts of data. Data from the 
database (MySQl tables) were adjusted to the re-
quired form using standard SQL commands. The 
resulting datasets were transformed into the out-
put format (*.txt file in the case of an offline chord 
diagram on the map, *.json file in the case of in-
teractive online presentations). D3 JavaScript li-
brary was also used in the online presentation as

well as on the online maps (see section D3 and 
TopoJSON). The result is a circular visualization 
of selected historical data from Tour de France 
(Fig. 2).

Circular visualization is an useful tool for a 
displaying large amount of data. The interactive 
online environment allows the client to read a 
specific database using a variety of scripting lan-
guages (e.g. JavaScript). In offline mode, the cli-
ent must properly interpret the displayed data. 
Basic interpretation of this circular visualization 
is shown in a chord diagram showing the most 
successful cyclists in the history of the Tour de 
France, according to the number of winning stag-
es (Fig. 3).

The outer circumference of diagram is formed 
by individual matrix entities (cyclists and stage 
finishes, where the selected cyclists triumphed). 
Cyclists are ordered by the number of winning 
stages. Finish places are divided into four basic 
categories (see Fig. 3 legend). The base width of

the relevant cyclist (number 1 in Fig. 3) corre-
sponds to the number of stage triumphs (e. g. eddy 
Merckx – 34 stage triumphs). Under the base are 
small boxes of different colours, with the colour 
corresponding to the type of finish place in which 
the cyclist triumphed and the thickness expresses 
the number of stage wins at a given location. The 
cyclist and the finish place are connected with a 
ribbon of appropriate width (number 3 in Fig. 5). 
In the case of a finish place, the width of the base 
expresses the number of the observed cyclist’s 
triumphs at this place. The individual segments 
reflect the triumphs of concrete cyclists (number 
2 in Fig. 5). In this example we can see that the ob-
served cyclists reached altogether 14 stage victo-
ries in Paris (eddy Merckx and Mark Cavendish 
– 4 victories, André Leducq – 3, Bernard Hinault 
– 2 and André Darrigade – 1 triumph). The city 
of Paris is the only common place where all of 
the above cyclists triumphed (Merckx – 4 vic-
tories, Cavendish – 4, Leducq – 3, Hinault – 2, 
Darrigade – 1). Here, however, we can say that 
it is just the Paris triumph that is one of the most 
valuable victories for cyclists participating in the 
Tour de France. At this point, it is appropriate to 
draw attention to the basic principle of the final 
cyclist´s selection. There was only one criterion 
of this selection and it was the total number of 
stage triumphs. Based on data organized in a da-
tabase, it would be easy to add similar character-
istics to any group of cyclists. For example, five 
and three-time Tour de France champions (eddy 
Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil, 
Miguel Indurain, louison Bobet, Philippe Thys 
and Greg Lemond) triumphed altogether in 119 
stages at 82 different places. In addition to basic 
quantitative characteristics of chord diagram we 
can also indirectly reveal the specific nature of 
these cyclists’ racing techniques. Mark Cavendish 
(30 stage victories) and André Darrigade (22) are 
typical representatives of sprinters. On the con-
trary, the triumphs of Eddy Merckx (34), Bernard 
Hinault (28) and André Leducq (25) demonstrate 
their universality and abilities to win even de-
manding mountain stages. A specific feature is 
the triumphs of Bernard Hinault who gained 
many of his wins in time trials and in initial pro-
logues (20).

Circular visualization of these historical 
data represents an attractive form of data rep-
resentation and its interactive design on Internet 

allows to the client direct identification of values. 
Integral part of the resulting map are four chord 
diagrams, while in the legend is also a reference 
to the online version of each chord diagram.

D3 and TopoJSON

D3 (Data Driven Documents) is a JavaScript 
library for producing data visualizations of ex-
tensive amounts of data. D3 allows direct con-
trol of data while using the standard model of 
an object, the so-called DOM (Document Object 
Model). Developers can link input data to any el-
ements of a document using D3, apply dynamic 
transformation, and modify the content (Bostock 
et al. 2011). The TopoJSON format is a text file 
that encodes the topology between particular 
map objects. At present, the universal nature of 
the D3 library in a combination with the pres-
entation of spatial data in the TopoJSON format, 
can be considered as an effective and user-friend-
ly method of cartographic visualizations of data. 
The previous section of the paper mentions the 
D3 library with respect to the online version of 
circular data visualization. This library was also 
used jointly with the TopoJSON format for an on-
line presentation of maps (final points, mountain 
ascents). Such an online presentation has sever-
al benefits in comparison with a static map. We 
consider easy identification of selected places 
(final points, mountain ascents), and the linking 
of these objects to the database with relevant at-
tributes, as the greatest benefits. Thus the client 
can easily display relevant data related to the 
selected place, and identify historical statistics. 
For the presentation of such a map, we must in-
tegrate basic libraries (topojson.js, d3.js) into the 
source file, while the libraries contain the com-
plete functionality required for the display of the 
map (or of another object) on the part of the cli-
ent. In addition to the above libraries, it is neces-
sary to download the source data required for the 
map. The presentation of the map and the defini-
tion of variables corresponds to the standards of 
JavaScript. A model presentation of such a code 
is as follows5:

variables can be shown directly on the website http://

The supporting map of the countries in the 
world is in the format *.topojson (world.topo-
json). Final points with relevant attributes are 
saved in *.csv file (finishes.csv). This contains 
several important attributes. The latitude (lat) 

and longitude (lon) defines the exact position of 
the relevant final point on the map. The attrib-
ute “ID” is the basic identifier of the given place 
which can show detailed statistics of the place as 
this value is identical to the attribute “id_place” 
in the database table “tdf_places” (see the section 
Data processing). A model final presentation of 
such a map is on Figure 4.

Map design

The basis for creating the final map was ob-
taining and efficiently redistributing all data. All 
necessary data were transformed into map layers 
(*.shp format). This map, consisting of four par-
tial maps and diagrams, we have attempted to 
present the most important sport achievements 
of individuals, including the countries in terms 
of stage triumphs and victories in mountain 
crossings, and also to illustrate the places of such 
historical moments. Such cartographic process-
ing can be viewed as innovative in terms of the 
perception of Tour de France history and could 
be inspiring also for other analyses covering the 
history of sports in all sectors where – as for the 
Tour de France – space plays an important role.

On the final map (Fig. 5) we intended to vis-
ualize the main spatial-historical characteristics 
of the Tour de France, while showing also the

most successful cyclists in history as well as the 
most successful countries. Therefore the key map 
layout (designed for A0 format) is divided into 
two sections (4 maps, including relevant chord 
diagrams). The left section presents stage tri-
umphs; the right section presents triumphs in 
mountain ascents. The upper parts of particular 
sections show the places of stage triumphs of the 
most successful cyclists in terms of the number 
of stage triumphs, or winning crossings through 
mountain ascents of the second, first and “hors 
catégorie”. The bottom parts present the victories 
of relevant countries, in which they show all the 
places of stage finishes or of mountain ascents in 
the history of the race (1903–2016). However, the 
most important stage finishes (20 and more stage 
finishes) and mountain ascents (20 and more 
crossings) are highlighted. The symbols of these 
places are colour-coded by the quantity of stage 
triumphs or of triumphs in the mountain as-
cents of the most successful countries in the his-
tory of Tour de France (for stages it was France, 
Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain – all 
countries with more than 100 winning stages; for 
mountain ascents it was France, Spain, Belgium 
and Italy – all countries with more than 200 win-
ning crossings in mountain ascents). To present 
an internal structure of triumphs, we used a 
non-traditional, but in our opinion, an adequate 
interpretation using chord diagrams. The figures 
presenting places in the diagram and on the map 
are identical, and thus the number of triumphs of 
the countries under review (cyclists) in the rele-
vant place (the map) as well as the share of wins 
of particular countries (cyclists) in the relevant 
place (the chord diagram), is easily identifiable. 
The size of diagrams is expressed on all maps 
based on the total number of stage finishes or of 
mountain ascents. All of the maps applied the 
robinson projection; the scales of the main maps 
of stage triumphs are 1: 4 200 000; for mountain 
ascents, the scale was 1: 2 700 000. Since the nu-
merical or verbal identification of particular plac-
es on the maps would result in a lack of clarity of 
such maps, at www.tdfrance.eu we developed an 
interactive map presentation showing the maps. 
These are linked to the database, so also an exact 
identification of the triumphs of particular cy-
clists in these places is possible. An online ver-
sion of the corresponding chord diagrams which 
are part of the map (the hyperlink is in the map) 

was also created. However, the maps have been 
designed to visualize key historical achievements 
(most successful nations and cyclists). The final 
map showed several historically relevant statis-
tics. For the achievements of particular racers in 
stages or in mountain ascents, part of the legend 
is a list of all triumphs of such cyclists shown on 
the map. For the wins of particular countries, it 
is possible to identify directly on the map only 
stages with 20 and more stage finishes (or ascents 
with 20 and more crossings) in the whole history. 
However, the map shows all stages and moun-
tain ascents included in the race itinerary at least 
once throughout history. For the purpose of iden-
tifying particular places and mountain ascents, 
an interactive map was inserted in the above stat-
ed website. These data are linked to the MySQl 
database, which keeps all collected attributes, 
and in addition to the identification of the place, 
it is also possible to get a detailed presentation of 
stages ending in the relevant stage place.

Important historical moments of the 
Tour de France (1903–2016)

The database and the visualization methods 
described in the preceding part of the paper were 
designed and used in such a manner that it is pos-
sible to identify the basic historical background of 
the history of Tour de France from its origination 
to the present when using them. Therefore, in this 
chapter we would like to stress certain interesting 
facts related to the development of the quantity of 
stage centres. They represent the above stated spa-
tial dimension of the race whereas the inclusion 
of particular places in the itinerary of particular 
years significantly affects the overall character of 
the race. In the more than 100-year history of Tour 
de France we can identify a total of 682 places, 
which gained the status of stage places (either as 
a start or as a finish). 569 places are French, and the 
remaining places are stage places in the surround-
ing countries (most of them in Belgium – 39). In 
the first Tour de France editions, stages repeated. 
The route was almost identical, and new centres 
were included in the itinerary relatively sporadi-
cally. This fact also strongly affected the final clas-
sification of stage centres based on the frequency 
at which the relevant centre was included in the 
Tour de France itinerary as a stage place (Fig. 6)

With regard to the significance we can see that 
many of the places included in the first editions 
remain continuously at the top of the rankings in 
terms of the quantity of performed stages (e.g., 
Paris, Bordeaux, Metz, Grenoble, and lyon). 
However, in the recent decades, there has been 
a notable trend towards increasing the share of 
new stage places to the detriment of stable cen-
tres. This is also connected, among other things, 
with the above stated use of the Tour de France 
for the promotion of particular regions in France, 
which thanks to television rights can be watched 
by millions of viewers throughout the world and 
which has, naturally, a great importance in pro-
moting tourism in the surrounding region. The 
stability of stage centres included in the Tour 
de France itinerary in selected time periods is il-
lustrated by three chord diagrams showing the 
most stable stage finishes (more than 20 times in 
the selected time interval) whereas each diagram 
shows the most successful countries in terms of 
the number of stage triumphs (Fig. 7).

The stability of stage finishes in the period be-
fore World War II (11 places with more than 20 
finishes, a total of 80 stage finishes) can be seen 
on the diagrams. After World War II, we see an 
attempt of race organisers to expand the quantity 
of stages finishes, whereas only 3 towns (1947–
1980: Bordeaux, Paris, Pau, 1981–2016: Paris, Alpe 
d´Huez, Pau) can be classified as stable finishes 
with more than 20 finishes in both following peri-
ods. However, the total quantity of stage finishes 
increased to 232 (1947–1980) or 338 (1981–2016), 
respectively. Also this graphical presentation is 
evidence that the organisers attempted to include 
the maximum possible number of stage finishes 
in the Tour de France itinerary. This fact is also 
visible in the localisation of particular finishes 
below the relevant diagrams on the same Figure 
7. On the relevant diagrams we can also see the 
development of the sport dimension of the race. 
The clear dominance of French and Belgian cy-
clists in the first period is markedly balanced by 
the triumphs of cyclists from other countries.

Based on the database with results, we can see 
that before 1939, cyclists from 9 countries were 
recorded on the scoreboard, while after 1981 it 
was even 32 countries6.

The linking of spatial and sport dimensions 
is shown on the final map (Fig. 5). On this map

countries or of individual racers in the Tour de 
France stages. In the historical statistics of the 
Tour de France, there is a record of a total of 831 
cyclists as the winners of stages (including time 
trials, prologues and including winning teams in 
team time trials). On the main map we reflected 
the places of the triumphs of the most successful 
cyclists in history in terms of the number of stage 
triumphs reached. The five most successful cy-
clists in history won a total of 139 stages, the fin-
ishes of which were in 94 different places (Fig. 8).

The map above (Fig. 8) expresses the stage 
triumphs of individual cyclists using standard 
cartographic methods. The size of the diagrams 
represents the total number of stage finishes in 
observed places (in 103 editions of the Tour de 
France cycling race altogether). Colour filling of 
the diagrams shows the number of triumphs of 
observed cyclists in these finishes. To express the 
internal structure of cyclist´s victories in the fin-
ish places, we used the above-described chord di-
agram, where the numbers of places on the map 
are identical to the numbers of places in the ap-
propriate chord diagrams.

When evaluating the stage sections of par-
ticular countries, both the map and the diagram 
shows the victories of the five historically most 
successful countries (France, Belgium, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Spain), which reported more than 
100 winning stages. The number of winning stag-
es of these countries naturally reflects the long-
term participation of cyclists from these countries 
in particular Tour de France editions. We must 
mention that in recent years, the scoreboard has 
been enriched by several countries in which cy-
cling does not have a very rich history. However, 
globalisation also affects this sport, and therefore 
the movement of cyclists from various countries 
between professional teams with high-quality 
services is not exceptional. The map shows all 
stage finishes in the long Tour de France history. 
With a the coloured presentation of the number 
of triumphs of the countries under review, as 
well as with a diagram, we wanted to stress the 
historically most significant stage finishes, which 
are included in the itinerary of particular editions 
on a relatively regular basis. Thus we stressed 23 
places, where more than 20 stage finishes were 
reported. In all of these stable centres, there is an 
apparently clear dominance of cyclists from the 
countries under review, whereas when looking at 
them in more detail, we can highlight the dom-
inance of French and Belgian cyclists. Together, 
they triumphed in 1166 Tour de France stages, 
which is more than a 50% share of all stages per-
formed (2215). Characteristics similar to stage fin-
ishes are also shown for the triumphs of cyclists 
or of particular countries in mountain ascents. It 
is important to stress that it is much more diffi-
cult to collect correct data for mountain ascents 
than for stage places. Therefore, in our analysis 
we used the official statistics of Tour de France, 

which record cyclists’ triumphs in mountain as-
cents of the second, first and “hors catégorie”. In 
this case as well we wished to highlight, in ad-
dition to a spatial aspect, the success rate of par-
ticular cyclists or of the most successful countries. 
For cyclists, we considered the limit to be 25 win-
ning crossings (6 cyclists), and for the triumphs of 
particular countries, we considered the limit to be 
200 winning crossings. (Here between Italy (the 
fourth) and the Netherlands (the fifth and histor-
ically most successful country), is a significant 
drop in the number of wins). Our analysis covers 
a total of 287 mountain ascents. In the presenta-
tion of the number of wins using chord diagrams, 
the coverage of the ascent by geomorphological 
unit was preferred to the total frequency of the 
relevant ascent included in the stage itinerary. 
This fact also reveals the frequency at which par-
ticular Tour de France ascents are included in 
the itinerary. Here we can see a frequent inclu-
sion of stable Pyrenean ascents in comparison 
with Alpine hills. With respect to these particu-
lar Pyrenean or Alpine ascents which appeared 
first in almost the same period (1910 or 1911), 
the difference is mainly in the shape of the rele-
vant geomorphological unit. The Pyrenees are 
line-shaped, whereas the Alpine massif is much 
more extensive, and thus the general variability of 
possible ascents is higher. The six most successful 
cyclists in history who are considered in our con-
tribution triumphed a total of 205 times in 78 dif-
ferent ascents. A joint triumph was recorded for 
all cyclists in two ascents (Tourmalet and Aspin), 
which in the rich history of Tour de France belong 
to the most frequently covered ascents (Tourmalet 
is on the 1st place, Aspin the 3rd place). Among 
the wins of particular countries the situation is 
similar to that of stage triumphs. Historical sta-
tistics are considerably affected by the long-term 
participation of cyclists from traditional road 
cycling countries (France, Spain, Belgium, and 
Italy). There is also an evident marked dominance 
of cyclists from the countries under review in all 
of the observed mountain crossings (25 ascents, 
whereas the boundary value was 20 crossings for 
the analysis). An exception is the Alpe d´Huez 
ascent, which is, thanks to a considerable dom-
inance of Dutch cyclists in the 1970s and in the 
1980s, nicknamed “the Dutch Mountain“.

The bicycle stage race Tour de France was cre-
ated in 1903. The 103 editions of Tour de France 



20 VLADIMíR BAčík, MICHAL kLOBUčNík

organized up till now have brought many un-
repeatable sport performances which have per-
manently gone down in the history of sports. 
In addition to the sport aspect, it is also unique 
thanks to its spatial coverage. In addition to the 
first editions when particular stages repeated, 
we can say that each edition is unique with its 
spatial arrangement. The organizers attempt to 
gradually present new places, which with their 
attractiveness and visual representation during 
broadcasting transmission, have the potential 
to be the most important places for the tourism 
in the given region. The inclusion of 666 stage 
places in the Tour de France itinerary is really 
a unique phenomenon in the field of sporting 
events. This trend of extending the list of stages 
can be expected even in the future as this aim is 
also declared by the representatives of this event 
at the A.S.O. (Amaury Sport Organisation). In the 
context of stage triumphs we can also expect that 
the list of countries that reported a winning stage 
(until now 33) will grow further. Cyclists from 
less traditional countries are increasingly found 
at the start of the race. A typical example can be 
the participation of the first African team in Tour 
de France 2015 (MTN-Qhubeka).

Discusion

The acquisition and subsequent processing of 
necessary data was an essential precondition for 
the whole research devoted to historical charac-
teristics of the Tour de France. The objective was 
not a detailed description of particular years or 
an analysis of significant sports moments, but an 
overview of the history of the race using selected 
visualization techniques. Therefore, in this place 
it is adequate to briefly discuss the suitability of 
the methods used in similar analyses.

The database system, designed to ensure re-
plies to any question related to space and the his-
tory of the relevant race, was the imagined core of 
the research. Today it is not necessary to discuss 
the significance of database systems in the online 
environment. Database systems are used in all 
tasks, in which data of any nature constitute an 
essential component in the implementation of 
particular activities. In our case, the said database 
system (see the chapter Methods – data process-
ing) presented the input for all other performed 

graphical and cartographical visualizations, ei-
ther in printed or online form. The advantage of 
online presentation (the website www.tdfrance.
eu) is the possibility to obtain detailed informa-
tion on the required characteristics, based simply 
on a query created by the client, and subsequent 
processing through the database system on the 
part of the server. The printed form has, natural-
ly, certain limitations but the tools of graphical 
and cartographical visualization allow relative-
ly adequate presentation of the historical facts 
obtained.

In the cartographical presentation, standard 
methods of proportional symbols were used, 
with the relevant colour based on selected inter-
vals. Interpretation options of this method are 
relatively intuitive, without any need to know 
the methodological details entering the develop-
ment of such a created map. It would certainly 
be possible to use several relevant methods for 
the expression of the characteristics under review 
(e.g., a pie chart, stacked chart, etc.). The method 
preferred by authors of this contribution in the 
form of proportional symbols with the relevant 
range of colours was also affected by the fact that 
all visualizations have been performed by us in 
the online Internet environment. For the pur-
pose of dynamic visualization, we applied the 
D3.js library and the TopoJSON format (see the 
chapter Methods – D3 and TopoJSON). The pos-
sibility of obtaining the visualization of almost 
identical printed and online forms through this 
library was a key reason for its application. There 
are many interesting tools that could be used in 
a similar task; we mention, for instance, map ja-
vascript libraries jQueryMapael, amMaps, jVec-
tor Map, and others. Again, their use is affected 
significantly by the personal preferences of the 
authors of the application. One the other hand, 
we must say that the concept of the D3 library is 
described precisely in several scientific works fo-
cused on the visualization of extensive data sets 
(Zhu, 2013, Bao and Chen, 2014, Jain, 2014). With 
respect to the extensiveness of the said library, 
the use of other cartographical methods is limit-
ed only by the authors’ skills.

Cartographic interpretation of the results is ac-
companied by a graphic presentation in the form 
of chord diagrams. Our aim was to link the spatial 
dimension (the position of the place expressed as 
a position on the map) and the sports dimension

(achievements of a specific cyclist or of a nation-
ality in the stage or in a mountain ascent). Again, 
we must note the fact that, for the purposes of 
graphic presentation, some standard methods (a 
column chart, a stacked chart) could also have 
been used. An example of comparison between 
circular visualization and stacked chart is shown 
at Figure 9.

One of the key advantages of the concept of 
circular visualization is, according to Auber et 
al. (2005), its own neutrality. It means that all 
tops (entities – cyclists, towns) are at an identical 
distance one from another and from the centre 
of the presentation. None of these entities has a 
privileged status as the reader tends to perceive 
objects that are closer to the centre as the most 
important (Huang et al. 2007). Equally, the ad-
vantage of circular visualization is the possible 
presentation of a large amount of data. The use of 
standard graphical presentation (e.g., a column 
chart) would undermine the readability of the 
output. In the opinion of the author of the pro-
ject CIRCOS, M. krzywinsky, the circular form 
of a diagram is also better for perception by the 
human eye, for which circular movement is more 
natural than movement along breaks or sharp 
edges. The usability of circular data visualization 
is versatile and there are many studies that use 
this form. This method is primarily used in the 
area of genetic engineering (Saw et al. 2013, Martis 
et al. 2013). The historical context of the origin of 
europeans is presented in an interesting way in 
the paper of Bollongino et al. (2013). In the field 
of social sciences, this concept is elaborated with 
the visualization of population migration flows 
in the world (Sander et al. 2014). Such a form of 
visualization can be used for the graphic analyses 
of any phenomena in which we wish to illustrate 
mutual links between particular entities. A good 
example of such use of chord diagrams can be 
used by monitoring of mutual balance of matches 
among the selected teams, or individuals in any 
sport sector7. Here we can see a depiction of ten-
nis matches among all world leaders since 1973. 
From such kind of visualization, we see mutual 
balance and number of matches between players, 
the player who was the most successful from this 
point of view and at the same time. The methods

of graphic and cartographic visualization pre-
sented in the study for the purpose of analysis 
of the Tour de France history can find their place 
to a large extent in any research task which in-
cludes visual data interpretation. There are many 
methods with which it is possible to present the 
characteristics under review and data. Usually 
the method is markedly affected by the prefer-
ences of the authors. Nevertheless, it must be un-
derlined that it is only one of possible methods 
of such interpretation. Our concept of the visual 
processing of the history of Tour de France is 
based on the knowledge base of the authors of 
the paper, as well as on the enthusiasm for this 
interesting topic.

Conclusions

The bicycle race Tour de France is a glob-
al sporting event. As one of the most watched 
sporting events on the planet, it has a history go-
ing back more than 110 years. From its origin in 
1903 to the present, the Tour de France has ex-
perienced many major and minor changes (or-
ganisational, sports, logistic, etc.). The original 
plan to organise this event to increase the sales 
of the French newspaper “l’Auto” has turned 
into a global event which is watched today by 
millions of spectators directly along the route 
and by hundreds of millions of viewers on TV 
screens. It is no surprise, then, to see that it enjoys 
unprecedented popularity among the audience, 
sports fans and the scientific community. There 
are many scientific contributions dealing with 
various aspects of this event (sporting, cultural, 
social, physiological, historical, etc.) Cycling fans 
can also enjoy a multitude of available litera-
ture, which usually presents historical statistics, 
significant personalities or iconic achievements 
of cyclists in legendary stages. As regards geog-
raphy as spatial science, however, the space in 
which the event is organised is the most interest-
ing aspect. every year the event consists of many 
stages, which have their start, finish and routes, 
such as significant mountain ascents, that the cy-
clists must overcome. It is this variability of sig-
nificant stages that was the primary impulse for 
the development of the submitted study. With 
respect to the total number of years organised up 
till now (103), we can work with data in a wide

time frame. The extensive quantity of data col-
lected and the spatial aspect resulted in the basic 
research question. We were interested in how it is 
possible to capture the most important historical 
aspects of Tour de France correctly and transpar-
ently and distribute them to persons interested 
in this topic. For the purpose of visualization, we 
used methods allowing graphic and cartograph-
ic interpretation of the results in two basic forms 
- printed and online (the Internet). Both of these 
forms constitute a sort of specific output of this 
paper. The use of the database system (MySQl), 
designed so that it can effectively store the max-
imum possible quantity of data, constitutes the 
backbone of the entire research. The data must 
be organised in such a manner that it is possible 
to answer any questions related to the history of 
Tour de France. Then from such a database, we 
extracted data required for specific visualization 
of selected attributes, using SQl.

In the context of graphical visualization, we 
preferred a less traditional, but in our opinion in-
teresting, method of circular visualization in the 
form of chord diagrams. The advantage of this 
concept is the possibility of displaying of a large 
quantity of data, as well as a certain neutrality 
resulting from the uniform arrangement of enti-
ties under review in a circular form. We used the 
visualization to express the internal structure of 
stage triumphs and of triumphs in mountain as-
cents of the most significant cyclists and national-
ities in the history of Tour de France. The spatial 
presentation was illustrated using the standard 
method of a proportional symbol. The result is 
a comprehensive map composition designed for 
the A0 format, which depicts all significant his-
torical moments of the Tour de France. In the con-
text of graphic and cartographic interpretation, 
other methods used for similar analyses could 
also have been used, but our objective was the 
above stated visualization of results in the online 
environment in the form of a functional website 
developed by the authors of this paper (www.
tdfrance.eu). The methods used by us are easily 
applied with the use of JavaScript library D3. At 
present, it is a standard for data visualization in 
the Internet environment, while for cartographic 
interpretation, this library is used in combination 
with TopoJSON format. The said methods have 
allowed us to capture the rich history of Tour 
de France both at sports and spatial levels. Such 

linking can be inspiring for other analyses in the 
area of sport, and for other analyses in which the 
time and spatial aspects play an important role.

The bicycle event Tour de France is inherently 
connected to the performance of cyclists partici-
pating every year in this prestigious event. This 
part of history is accentuated in many profes-
sional and lay contributions and books dealing 
with this significant sporting event. Our objective 
was to explain these aspects in the context of the 
space where the event is organised. This space 
forms an integral part in the long-term develop-
ment of the exceptional position of this race in 
the sporting world. Today many stage centres 
and mountain ascents are very sought-after by 
tourists. enthusiasts from all over the world often 
follow the routes of the legends of this sport in 
ascents such as Tourmalet, Mont Ventoux, Alpe 
d´Huez, and many others at a later date and try 
to compete with the top cyclists’ performances. 
Therefore, the Tour de France has long ceased to 
be a mere sporting event. Thanks to its nature and 
position, it significantly exceeds this primary role. 
Thanks to broadcasting rights, broadcasts from 
particular stages are transmitted to many coun-
tries in the world and many images feature cul-
tural, historical and natural monuments around 
which cyclists pass by. Thus the race has become 
a significant tool for promoting tourism in the rel-
evant regions. It will also be certainly interesting 
to monitor in the future how the Tour de France 
influences the visit rate of particular regions, the 
number of overnight stays in hotels, etc.

From its origin to the present, the Tour de 
France has experienced many changes. With 
respect to the present form of this race, we can 
expect other significant moments in the future, 
which will go down in the history of this event 
not only in the context of sporting performances, 
but also in the context of race organisation, the 
inclusion of other interesting places in the stage 
itinerary, etc. The Tour de France is a global phe-
nomenon which is interesting from the geograph-
ical point of view thanks to the location where it 
takes place. The space will continue to expand, 
as evidenced through yearly debates on the pos-
sibility of the localisation of the “Grand Départ” 
for this event. More and more frequently, foreign 
towns host this event (3 out of the last 5 years; 
once on the island of Corsica), which contributes 
significantly to strengthening its position outside

France. In the context of constant development of 
this event in all aspects (the technological aspect 
of the development of cycling as such, broadcast-
ing technology, logistical possibilities, etc.) we 
can say that “la Grande Boucle” will never grow 
old, but it deserves the attention of geography, 
which can bring a certain specific view of the sub-
ject and of its rich history.
