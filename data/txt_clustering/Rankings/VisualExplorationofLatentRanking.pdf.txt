Abstract Rankings are everywhere in the world and they change constantly. Detecting and analyzing
ranking changes in a ranked list is of great importance for recommendation and information retrieval tasks.
Common to existing approaches is that the latent correlations and trends of ranked lists are not taken into
account. This paper introduces RankEvo, an integration of rank structuring and visualization techniques, for
detecting and analyzing latent evolutions in ranking time series. We characterize the ranking changes by
computing the similarities among the time series of ranked items and organizing similar items into itemsets,
and further forming ranking evolutions. The integrated RankEvo system provides visualization and intuitive
interactions for exploring correlated itemsets, concurrent ranking evolutions, as well as outlier items of
ranked lists. The system also employs additional information windows on demand for evolution elaboration
and verification. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the RankEvo
system in assisting users to understand ranking changes.

1 Introduction

Ranking is a basic and important tool applied almost everywhere, especially in fields such as web search,
business intelligence, and marketing. Typical ranking operations take two modes: ranking by preference and
ranking by process (Marden 1995). The former is identical to the statistical rating, and indicates the
distribution of user preferences, such as the presidential election, hot search queries, or popular movie
evaluation. The latter compares the item values subject to certain metrics and produces an ordered list. Well
known examples include the US Fortune-500 and top-rated stocks.

Regardless of the mode it takes, a ranked list may vary frequently over time due to either the raters’
changeable preferences or the evolving ranked items, both of which convey insightful temporal information
for understanding ranked items and latent ranking patterns. For instance, in a phrase-based search appli-
cation, the rankings of specific items (queries) may imply the time when these items become popular, the
variation degrees of their rankings, and their temporal trends. Existing solutions for analyzing temporal
ranking changes commonly track the ranking changes of each individual item over time, representing them
with line charts. However, visualizing the curves or their similarities altogether can often cause heavy visual
clutter if there are a large number of items. Another approach (Shi et al. 2012) emphasizes the ranking
changes between successive time points by grouping ranked items into multiple segments at each time point.
Although this method successfully depicts the ranking changes within and across multiple categories, it is
hardly capable of disclosing complicated correlations of ranking changes. We argue that an ideal analytical
solution of ranking changes should take the following aspects into consideration:

– Investigating the ranking change of a single item is not the ultimate goal. It is highly preferred to
characterize a group of items that may have concurrently or correlatively evolved over time.

– Salient ranking changes of some ranked items may indicate an interesting pattern. However, it is quite
challenging to disclose the potential theme by solely leveraging the ranking changes.

– Visualizing ranking changes in large time series can easily lead to visual clutter. Yet, designing an
expressive visualization approach is a non-trivial task.

We present a novel visual exploration method for detecting and analyzing latent ranking evolutions in large
time series. We define latent ranking evolutions as the ranking trends of ranked lists, including trends of a single
item and multiple items of similar ranking fluctuations. We use the term ‘‘latent ranking evolutions’’ because it
is important to distinguish our method of discovering concurrent or correlated ranking changes from typical
time-of-rank line charts. And the term ‘‘latent’’ here indicates the correlations between items that cannot be
revealed with typical methods. It should be noted that while there has been strong interest in representing
ranking changes (Shi et al. 2012), to our knowledge this is the first approach for discovering latent rank
evolutions and ranked items with concurrent trends. The key to discover item-wise concurrency is to group the
ranked items into bundles based on the similarity of the item time series. The dynamic ranking evolution over
time is visualized with multiple views in an integrated interface, RankEvo. The entire system has advantages
over common methods as it illustrates the concurrent rank changes and interesting patterns indicated by salient
ranking changes. The design of the RankEvo system can be easily adapted to work on large scale data or even
streaming data with minor changes. In summary, the presented RankEvo system shows three main novelties:

– A general framework for analyzing latent ranking evolutions in time series that only handles the orders
of ranked items,

– A novel and uniform visual representation for ranking changes that characterizes the occurrence,
evolution, splitting, merging, and decline of an item group,

– A user-guided interactive process that allows dynamic manipulation of the ranked items of interest.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Related work is reviewed in Sect. 2. The flowchart of the
proposed system is presented in Sect. 3. Sections 4 and 5 describe the representation and visual exploration
of the latent ranking evolutions. Case studies are elaborated in Sect. 6, followed by discussions in Sect. 7.
Finally we conclude the paper in Sect. 8.

2 Related work

Methods for statistical modeling of ranking can be categorized into two classes (Marden 1995): modeling the
ranking process and modeling the population of rankers. The first one is the focus of our approach. Repre-
sentative methods include the central ranking extraction and ranking distance models. For ranking modeling,

H. Lei et al.



various ranking distances (Critchlow 1985) are defined to measure the similarity between two rankings such
as Kendall’s tau distance and Spearman’s rho distance. Special care is paid to incomplete ranking or ranking
with tied items (Kidwell et al. 2008; Alvo and Cabilio 1985). In particular, expected weighted Hoeffding
distance (Sun et al. 2010) (EWHD for short) can be used to estimate rankings for missing items.

However, all methods mentioned above deal with a single ranked list. Little attention has been paid to rank
time series despite a number of visualization approaches for time-oriented data (Aigner et al. 2011). The time
dimension of data can be linear or cyclic. The standard visualization for linear time dimension would be a two
dimensional plot: one axis for time, the other for data value. Weber et al. (2001) designed a spiral-shaped time
axis where careful selection of cycle length could reveal the cyclic pattern of the data. If the time dimension
refers to date, a weight-encoded calendar view (Wijk and Selow 1999) can be adopted to visualize the value
changes in different days. Tominski et al. (2004) made use of parallel coordinates to represent high dimen-
sional time series. They placed other dimension axes around the central time axis so that the distribution of
values in other dimensions could be clearly observed. Visualization applying time line structure (Plaisant et al.
1996) is also common in representing events, activities or even status, such as personal health records. For time-
varying evolving topics in text data, TextFlow (Cui et al. 2011) is a technique for visualizing various evolution
patterns from multiple topics. Also, time-oriented data visualization in diverse applications integrates all kinds
of techniques corresponding to the datasets. Good examples include LiveRAC (McLachlan et al. 2008): time
series data visualization of system management , Whisper (Cao et al. 2012): visual tracing tool of information
diffusion, Storyline (Ogawa and Ma 2010): software evolution visualization, and Timebox (Hochheiser and
Shneiderman 2004): an interactive tool for time series exploration.

This paper concerns the visualization of rank time series. The simplest way for visualizing rank time
series is to embed each individual rank in a low-dimensional space and encode it with a heatmap repre-
sentation. Similar models have been proposed in Sun et al. (2010) and Wei et al. (2012). By emphasizing
the subtle rank changes, RankExplorer (Shi et al. 2012) adaptively segmented the ranking time series into
groups, and extends ThemeRiver with color bars and glyphs to convey adjacent ranking changes and overall
trends. To present ranking trends with spirals, RankClock (Batty 2006) employed radial coordinates to
represent the ranks of different time points, however it can hardly scale to long rankings. Slope graph (Tufte
1986) connects time-varying items with lines to reveal temporal changes of item values. If the rank
evolution of each ranked item is considered, it can be visualized as a rank band.

A similar visualization was

adopted in TrajRank Lu et al. (2015), which ranks trajectory clusters by overall ranking score so that users
are able to explore trajectories of higher importance. Another similar visualization is achieved in Wiki-
Top50,

which depicted the variation of the top-50 ranked items one by one and connected the same items

with curves. Even the simplest scatter plots assisted with user selections
3
can be applied to explore temporal

trends of ranked items. Our work differs from existing solutions that our focus is the representation,
visualization and interaction of the latent rank evolutions instead of a single item.

3 Approach overview

To clear up the confusion over similar terms used in this paper, we first provide several definitions related to
ranking (examples shown in Fig. 1) before the overview of our RankEvo system.

Ranked list A ranked list is a list of items ordered by certain measurement at a certain time point.
Ranked item A ranked item is an item with its order in a ranked list.
Ranking time series A ranking time series is the series of ranked lists varying over time, like the four Top-

10 rankings plotted in Fig. 1.
Item time series An item time series is the order series of an item in a ranking time series, plotted as the

curve in blue in Fig. 1.
Concurrent itemset A concurrent itemset is a collection of ranked items on a ranked list that have similar

ranking changes in their recent history and that may indicate an interesting activity or
event. The two items in Fig. 1 form a concurrent itemset since their historical ranking
time series follow a similar trend. If a ranked item’s time series does not belong to any
concurrent itemset, the item is called an isolated ranked item.

We have designed our RankEvo system (Fig. 2) to accomplish the three main tasks for visual exploration
of latent ranking evolutions: generation, visualization and elaboration of the ranking time series. Our
approach first extracts relations of ranked items according to ranking time series, capturing concurrent
ranked items. We then visualize the concurrency and the independence of the ranked items at each indi-
vidual time point and visually aggregate the concurrency to represent temporal ranking evolutions. Con-
currency elaboration and verification are supported via additional information windows on demand.

We adopt a band-based visual design to reveal the latent ranking evolutions of the ranked items. Users
are able to highlight any items to display its evolving ranking orders, or expand any itemset to discover their
concurrency as well. It also provides ranking line chart windows and item detail pages so that users can
easily make comparisons among items or itemsets.

4 Representation of latent rank evolutions

To present the latent rank evolutions, our approach first calculates the dissimilarity of each pair of ranked
items on a ranked list according to their recent ranking trends. An aggregation of the ranked items is
conducted with an agglomerative clustering method to join items into concurrent itemset. In addition,
similar concurrent itemsets are further associated over time to form the latent evolutions.

Fig. 2 The design model of our RankEvo system. The data preprocessing includes three stages, the dissimilarity measurement
of the item time series, clustering items into concurrent itemsets, and the generation of ranking evolution. The RankEvo system
visualizes items, itemsets and evolutions in a single view. The system also employs multiple extra windows to elaborate and
verify item concurrency and independence with the item page and the curve view

4.1 Dissimilarity computation of ranked items

We evaluate the dissimilarity between two ranked items by the proximity of their associated item time
series, with the assumption that two ranked items are potentially (but not necessarily) correlated if they share
similar trends during their recent history. since dynamic time warping method (DTW) (Vintsyuk 1968) is
widely used in time series distance computation, we adopt this method as the main factor for the similarity
of two ranked items, while considering other factors as well. In specific, the dissimilarity of two ranked
items at a certain time point is defined as the weighted sum of three factors: the dynamic time warping factor
fdtw, the average order factor favgo, and the loss compensation factor fcomp.

Dissim ¼
wdtw � fdtw þ wcomp � fcomp þ wavgo � favgo

wdtw þ wcomp þ wavgo
where wdtw, wcomp and wavgo are adjustable weights in correspondence with the three factors.

The dynamic time warping factor fdtw estimates the temporal trends dissimilarity of two ranked items by
computing the cost for matching their item time series curves. For a given pair of curves, a set of the shortest
distances and the associated shortest paths are computed with DTW alignment. It is apparent that two item
time series with similar trends have stable shortest distances, which indicates small standard deviation.
Thus, we define fdtw as the standard deviation of the shortest distances after DTW alignment (see the red
alignments in Fig. 3b). However, in some cases such as that shown in Fig. 3a, the same length of shortest
paths and standard deviation may result from completely dissimilar curves (curve A to curve B and curve A
to curve C) due to a lack of distinction between positive and negative distance. We address the problem by
adding interpolated points into the time series (gray dots in Fig. 3b). The interpolation scheme adjusts the
alignment paths and its distance standard deviation. We do not apply the common offset practice, which
substrates the time series to a constant offset, because it differs the result greatly from different offset
distances (the mean order, the median order or the minimum order of the time series). And we would also

between curve A to curve B and curve A to curve C. The shortest paths and the standard deviations are the same for both of
them. With interpolation (the gray dots), blue dashed lines are added for distance between curve A and curve C. Although the
shortest paths remain the same, the length of the path and the standard deviation of the distances between curve A and curve C
is much larger than that between curve A and curve B. b Red dashed lines indicate distance before interpolation and blue lines
after interpolation. With interpolation (the gray dots), the shortest paths take a different route

Visual exploration of latent ranking evolutions in time series



distinguish two time series of large offset from two of small offset because the latter ones are relatively more
correlated on the ranked list. Besides, we also assign a large number (e.g., twice of the item number in a
rank) to discontinuous item time series, which drops off the ranked list and comes back sometimes. The time
complexity of DTW alignment is Oðn2Þ, where n is the length of the time series.

Although fdtw considers the influence of discontinuous item time series, the factor confidence is low
when the original time series has too many missing values. To compensate this loss, we define a com-
pensation factor fcomp as the sum of the missing items in two underlying time series. To further separate
items with high and low rankings, an average order factor favgo is adopted. Note that the three factors fdtw,
favgo and fcomp are only related to the orders of the ranked items on the same ranked list, and are normalized
to [0,1].

Adjustment of the three factors depends on specific applications. Applications with moderate ranking
changes should weight more on favgo and less fcomp. And fdtw is always the most essential factor in the
dissimilarity computation. The parameter settings are discussed with more details in Sect. 7.2.

4.2 Concurrent itemset generation

The dissimilarities among item time series often indicate the trend differences of the underlying ranked
items. Additional clustering of the series based on item dissimilarity can help users identify the ranked items
and their time points that reveal dramatic ranking changes. The analysis of the corresponding causes and
effects uncovers features of the latent ranking evolutions. In our clustering case, the cluster number is not
fixed and an item time series is not necessarily assigned to a cluster. Therefore, we conduct an agglom-
erative clustering method as described in Algorithm 1, which groups ranked items based on pair-wise
dissimilarity and filters small clusters. The time complexity of Algorithm 1 is Oðn3Þ where n is the number
of items on the a ranked list (e.g. k in a top-k rank).

4.3 Latent evolution formation

If two concurrent itemsets, which are successive over time, share plenty of items in common, then we say
that the two itemsets are consecutive. Consecutiveness between two itemsets is defined by the Jaccard
Index (Jaccard 1901), which estimates the similarity of the two itemsets as an index between common
ranked items and universe ranked items. The consecutiveness is filtered with a threshold, such that the
smaller the threshold is, the more tightly related the two itemsets are.

We also apply the expected weighted Hoeffding distance (EWHD) (Sun et al. 2010) to compute the
dissimilarity between two adjacent ranked lists (see the gray area of rank similarity in Fig. 2). Two ranked
lists are of low EWHD distance if most of the items on the list maintains steady orders. The comparison
between adjacent ranked lists is adopted to measure rapid changes of overall rankings quantitatively. EWHD
can effectively handle partial or missing ranking information and only requires the orders of the items.
Computing EWHD is fast for ranked lists with constant item numbers (e.g., the top-k ranks). To accelerate
the computation, a lookup table can be built and reused by pre-computing all combinations of pairs of the
underlying ranked lists.

5 Visual exploration of latent ranking evolutions

Our RankEvo system visualizes the latent ranking evolutions on a scrollable canvas, which gives an
overview to all ranked lists with concurrent itemsets and isolated ranked items in all time. Users can track
the evolution of one itemset on demand, explore correlations and validate the similarity of the items in extra
linked windows. This exactly follows Ben Schneiderman’s visualization mantra, ‘‘overview first, zoom and
filter, then details on demand (Shneiderman 1996)’’. In addition to ranking evolutions, supplementary
information is provided via extra linked windows instead of inline views or zoomable user interface, to
allow parallel comparisons of multiple small patterns in large ranking time series space. Users can open
multiple extra windows to make flexible comparisons among different ranking trends of different itemsets
without consuming too much visual working memory (Ware 2012).

5.1 Visualizing ranking evolutions

First of all, the ranked list at each time point is represented as a ranking column evenly placed in parallel
along the time axis, which form a time-rank coordinates system (see ranking columns in Fig. 2). The
coordinates system uniformly locate all the concurrent itemsets and isolated ranked items as well as their
evolving relations. Due to limited display space, RankEvo has ranked lists of a limited period of time (28
time steps) shown in one frame and enables users to select any other period with a scrollable slider.

Each concurrent itemset is represented as a rectangle, filled with small rectangles whose colors are
encoded with ranking changes of each item member. Thus, the rectangle reflects recent change patterns of
its item members, and further, the quality and different patterns of item clustering. As it shows in the Fig. 4,
the change of ranking orders are represented from rising order to falling order as red to blue, light gray if the
item falls off the ranking. Itemset with good clustering displays a uniform color distribution. The length of
the itemset rectangle is set to be proportional to the size of the items in the cluster. RankEvo employs the
average order of all the ranked items in the cluster to locate the concurrent itemset at the associated rank
column.

To enhance the temporal relations, the RankEvo system employs a smooth curve-shaped band to connect
the concurrent itemset between adjacent rank columns. The top and bottom boundaries of the band are
represented with two 3-order Bezier curves, respectively, whose control points are set as two points on the
individual rectangles and as two additional points between them. In addition, the vertical boundaries of two
rectangles are used as the left and right boundaries of the band. The edge band in Fig. 5 illustrates the edges
between consecutive itemsets. Normal bands and highlighting bands are encoded in green and blue,
respectively.

The isolated ranked items are located on the rank columns according to their orders posterior to itemsets.
To show the order change compared to its previous time point, an upwards or downwards glyph is used to
encode each isolated item (see the isolated items in Fig. 6, the same item time series with that in Fig. 1).
Also, transparency of color encodes the overall lifespan of the item. Item time series of isolated ranked item
is shown with an edge connecting to the corresponding glyphs. After highlighting, item’s original ranking
order as well as relative position fixed by layout is plotted with a red curve and a green curve, respectively.

To give a summary of the ranked items at each time point, we draw the tags of the itemset’s center item
at the bottom (see rank dissimilarity in Fig. 2). In addition, the difference between two neighboring ranked

lists at each time point is plotted as a stacked graph. The stacked graph enables users to take an overview of
the rank variations and detect significant changes.

5.2 Visualizing concurrency of itemsets

The curve view visualizes the recent history and the near future of the item time series of a selected set of
ranked items with line chart. Line chart is especially straightforward for displaying the details of item time
series for a small number of concurrent items. Users can select a single or a bundle of curves for detailed
investigation, comparison, and trend prediction. Because items may fall off the rank at some time points, we
add a gray area at the bottom. The light gray axis in the view indicates the current given time point of all the
ranked items in the cluster. The visualization represents both the most recent historic rank values (basis for
item dissimilarity computation) and their near future values (if they have). Users can either evaluate the
quality or discover the evolution of the cluster.

The curve view in Fig. 2 shows a list of Wikipedia queries belonging to the same cluster, where the
highlighted curve represents the center of the cluster. We can observe similar ranking trends and subtle
details of individual query item.

5.3 Visual exploration of ranking changes

Users may explore ranking changes in two styles: either focusing on a custom item of users’ interest, or
scanning through the evolution series, looking for specific patterns. For the first style, users first scroll to a
period of time of interest, choosing a single item or itemset. Hovering an item highlights its overall time
series, while hovering an itemset highlights its evolution bands as well as the tag cloud of all its member

items. For the second style, long-lasting itemsets or rapid changes (indicated by rank similarity and the item
evolution visualization) of overall patterns can be potentially interesting patterns.

To allow users to evaluate the relative ranking orders of all member items, users can click on the itemset
for the curve view of a recent period of the time series of the corresponding items. Good or bad clustering
can also be indicated from the overall trends of the line chart. To further explore the semantic correlations of
the items, users can click on the highlighted tag or the curve for item’s semantic page (the Wikipedia page
for example), in which we adopt a degree-of-relevance highlighting technique (Ware 2012) to highlight its
semantic-relevant member items in the itemset. Both the curve view and the item pages are extra linked
windows triggered on demand so that users can open as many windows as it needs to make easy com-
parisons among items or itemsets.

6 Use cases

In this section, we demonstrate how the RankEvo system can be used to analyze latent rank evolutions with
three real-life datasets: Wikipedia top-50 query series, US Fortune-500 series, and life expectancy at birth
series. The construction of time-of-rank tree waves is completed in seconds and the system allows real-time
user interactions in exploring latent rank evolutions.

6.1 Wikipedia top-50 query series

The page view statistics for Wikimedia projects
4
maintains raw page access records for all Wikipedia

projects in all languages. We have collected the page view statistics for three months (from Jun. 1st to Oct.
27th in 2011) and generated daily top-50 queries as the rank time series data. We set items’ latest 10 days as
the recent time series in the similarity computation.

We follow the first exploration style and focus our attention on the topic of Steve Jobs’s death in October
2011. As shown in Fig. 7, we zoom the RankEvo visualization into a 4-day range band, from the Oct. 6th to
the Oct. 9th, when relevant queries appear on the rank. The queries of the cluster on the Oct. 7th (marked by
the red rectangle) contain the name of Apple’s successor ‘‘Tim_Cook’’, Apple’s co-founder
‘‘Steve_Wozniak’’, Jobs’s wife ‘‘Laurene_Powell_Jobs’’, the daughter he had with his high school girlfriend
‘‘Lisa_Brennan-Jobs’’, his biological younger sister ‘‘Mona_Simpson’’, ‘‘pancreatic_cancer’’, ‘‘Bill_Gates’’
and ‘‘Apple_Inc.’’. The branch starts from the top on Oct. 6th and falls down day by day, until out of the top-
50 queries after Oct. 10th. It is interesting that another isolated cluster on Oct. 6th also includes queries
related to Jobs (marked by the gray rectangle), such as ‘‘Pixar’’ graphics studio founded by Jobs, Apple’s
slogan ‘‘think_different’’ and ‘‘macintosh’’. The queries in this cluster are not as consistent as the the first
branch, as they appear only on the first day of this time range. This comparison indicates that Wikipedia
users are interested in Jobs’s family and famous people related to him more than the technology background.
The reason ‘‘Steve_Mozniak’’ is a hotter query than ‘‘Tim_Cook’’ and ‘‘Bill_Gates’’ may be that he played a
part in the popular series ‘‘Big Bang Theory’’ and is known to a wider audience.

With the RankEvo system, we can also find that many of the query inputs are generated from the Internet
links than manual inputs. For example, the queries of ‘‘Mona_Simpson_(novelist)’’ are more popular than
‘‘Mona_Simpson’’ in the data. It reveals that much traffic of Wikipedia comes from internal links rather than
direct query. Wikipedia users tend to click the words they are interested in to jump between pages. In the
example of Steve Jobs, while accessing the page of Steve Jobs they may jump to the web pages of his wife
or his daughter via the internal links on his page.

6.2 US fortune-500 series

The US Fortune-100 dataset
5
published by Fortune magazine maintains an annual list of the top-500

companies in the United States during 1955 to 2012. We set items’ latest 15 years as the recent time series
in the similarity computation, and visualize the top 100 ranking variations since 1970. Following the second
exploration style (both from the low similarity in the rank similarity or from the item/itemset visualization),
we discovered the rapid change pattern in 1995 (in red rectangle).

themselves with others in 1995. This is caused by the addition of service-oriented companies such as
‘‘Walmart’’. This event is also recorded by several other visualization applications for this dataset (Shi et al.
2012). In the RankEvo system, the new companies introduced in 1995 become the roots of new branches in
later years.

The RankEvo system also reveals that the rankings of Fortune-100 companies before 1995 are stable.
Most of the businesses of these companies are in the fields of manufacturing, mining, or energy exploration.
We can also recognize the rising of electronics industry, especially the IT industry. As shown in Fig. 8, the
branch smoothly rising and growing strongly is the cluster of IT companies including ‘‘HP’’, ‘‘Motorola’’,
‘‘Digital Equipment’’, ‘‘Emerson Electric’’, and ‘‘Unisys’’.

6.3 Life expectancy at birth series

The life expectancy at birth dataset
6
published by the World Bank includes the expected life span of 198

countries during 1950 to 2011. First we convert the exact value into ranking orders from longer to shorter
life span of all the countries. Then we set items’ latest 10 years as the recent time series in the similarity
computation. and visualize the ranking evolution since 1960.

Life expectancy at birth statistically indicates the life span of a newborn infant if prevailing patterns of
mortality stay the same. As it shows in Fig. 9 that the clusters remain relatively steady while some items
drop out of their historic clusters due to local rising or dropping of ranking orders. Such patterns as items
isolating themselves from or joining other clusters usually reflect certain events about the corresponding
countries.

Going through all the time range an obvious outlier item at the bottom of the rankings(the green curve) is
uncovered. By highlighting the item, we find that its historic value series follows a rising and sharp dropping
pattern while others are generally steady, which makes the item an outlier. The red curve reflects that the
ranking order of the item rose greatly from the years 1953 to 1958, however, declined even more from 1959
to 1961. After 1961, the order slowly climbed back and maintained steady. Referring to the history of the
item—‘‘China’’, it reflects the development of the country in the 1950s. China put forward the first 5-year

and famous people related to him, such as his biological younger sister ‘‘Mona_Simpson’’ and his successor ‘‘Tim_Cook’’. The
gray rectangle contains other elements associated with Jobs, such as ‘‘Pixar’’ graphics studio and ‘‘macintosh’’. The temporal
evolutions of these two groups are significantly different. The line chart shows the ranking patterns of those items

line chart indicate a rising of IT companies since 1983. The representative company ‘‘Motorola’’ is marked with a green curve.
Also, there reflects a significant evolution change in 1995 in two ways: the sudden dropping of ranked list similarity at the
bottom and the many isolated items on the list of 1995. This evolution reveals the addition of service-oriented companies such
as ‘‘Walmart’’

However, due to natural disasters and government policy errors, China experienced the 3 years of great

7 Discussion

7.1 User evaluation

We conducted a user evaluation study with 5 participants for the effectiveness of our system in exploring
ranking evolution. All participants expressed their interests in discovering the correlations and trends of the
itemsets with the RankEvo system. They indicated that our methods are able to separate different evolution
features and visualize temporal patterns intuitively. They are happy that unfamiliar items in the Wikipedia
page can be explained by the item page. The participants also pointed out that they were confused why
sometimes the rising trend of items and itemset are encoded in a decline trend in the main view, such as the
IT companies case. The red ranking curve and the extra curve view only mitigate the problem to a limited
extent. Also, they found some items in the itemset share a common ranking trend but they’re not much
related. This is due to the weak assumption that similar ranking trend indicates semantic correlation of
items. In the future work, we plan to introduce complementary semantic support to the similarity mea-
surement process. For the Wikipedia case, complementary semantics such as the page-link between items
can greatly enhance the correlations among itemsets. However, such semantic support is case-dependent and
cannot be applied to other applications.

7.2 Parameter discussion

According to different features of various datasets, different ratios of the three parameters: the dynamic time
warping factor, the compensation factor, the average rank factor, are applied to explore latent rank evo-
lutions. We tend to use larger compensation factor for datasets with more short-term ranked items. For
example, the compensator factor in Wikipedia Top-50 dataset is large while that in life expectancy dataset is
set to 0 because the ranks are complete all the time. Also, because most ranks are steady in the life
expectancy dataset, a higher average rank factor is required to further separate the items. However the short-
term popular ranked items, due to the lack of similarities with historic data, are often hard to identify and
require user interactions to analyze.

Although the parameters are crucial for the latent ranking evolutions, users are not allowed to adjust
them interactively. Because each adjustment results to overall data reconfiguration and layout reconstruction
once the parameters are changed, the overall ranking patterns changes so disorderedly that users cannot
follow the visualization smoothly.

7.3 Limitations

According to users’ feedback, our system still has some limitations. First, the visualization reveals the
concurrent ranking pattern rather than the absolute rank orders. An emergence or expansion of a cluster
sometimes yields the layout offset of other clusters and other items, which often confuses users when items’
positions do not indicate their rank orders. Second, because the common ranking trend is automatically
computed based on the rank time series, the semantic correlation is not covered. It still depends on users’
personal knowledge or external query to supplement the semantic correlation among items in one cluster.
Thus, we would enhance the layout of items and itemsets and semantic support of our RankEvo system in
the future work.

8 Conclusions

Studying the ranking evolutions has attracted much attention in the data analysis and visualization com-
munities. This paper presents a novel scheme for discovering latent ranking evolutions by integrating
ranking structuring algorithms with visualization techniques. The ranking structuring process includes
dissimilarity computation of the ranked items and tree wave structure generation of the concurrent itemsets.

H. Lei et al.



Our RankEvo system employs three coordinated visualizations to analyze ranking time series in different
aspects and provide a set of interactive analysis interactions. The three case studies verify its efficiency in
detecting both short-term and long-term evolution patterns of ranked items, as well as patterns of isolated
items.

Concerning the future work, we plan to enrich our visualization with level-of-detail clustering of ranked
items based on custom related parameters. Such clustering approach should be integrated into the system
with additional flexible user interactions. Also, we will leverage other analysis approaches for item prop-
erties to enhance the analysis efficiency.
