ABSTRACT

This article introduces À Table!, an enhanced soccer ranking
table providing temporal navigation by combining two novel
interaction techniques. Ranking tables order soccer teams rep-
resented as rows, according to values of columns containing
attributes e. g., accumulated points, or number of scored goals.
Because they represent a snapshot of a championship at a time
t, tables are regularly updated with new results. Such updates
usually change the rows order, which makes the tracking of a
specified team over time difficult. We observed that the tables
available on the web do not support tracking such changes
very well, are generally hard to read, and lack interactions.
This contrasts with the extensive use of comments on tempo-
ral trends found in soccer analysts articles. To better support
such analyzes, the two interactive techniques presented al-
low exploration of time, and are designed to preserve users’
flow: DRAG-CELL is based on direct manipulation of values
to browse ranks; VIZ-RANK uses a transient line chart of team
ranks to visually explore a championship. An on-line evalua-
tion with 143 participants shows that each technique efficiently
supports a set of important temporal tasks not supported by

INTRODUCTION

Every day, millions of soccer enthusiasts study web sites,
newspapers, or other media to learn about their favorite team’s
current ranking and how it compares historically. One way
to present this information is to use ranking tables. Soccer
ranking tables show results for a given championship, at a
given day. Rows are teams, and columns are statistics. Column
types include, for example: the total points per season, number
of wins, draws, and lost games. Tables are updated once a
round of games is over, and can become quite large. Assuming
a championship with 20 teams, a table will be updated 38 times
since each team plays against each other twice.

We conducted an empirical study of 51 articles (weekly and
monthly summaries of soccer championships) from major
soccer websites, and collected 44 pseudo-interactive soccer
tables to investigate how they support temporal tasks. Our
first observation was that ranking tables are not designed for
comparison, despite the need for analysts and the existence



of guidelines [21, 15]. Furthermore, 77.3% of tables do not
implement column sorting, and 73% of them do not provide
any aid for temporal navigation although it may be useful for
interactive exploration [15, 9]. Finally, we did not observe any
use of visualization, however it provides compact representa-
tion for multidimensional data [15, 9] and displays trends over
long time periods with line charts [13, 17].

We present À Table!, an enhanced ranking table combining
two novel temporal navigation techniques. DRAG-CELL is a
direct manipulation technique to browse values over time by
dragging them into the Value domain; VIZ-RANK uses a line
chart to show the values of cells over time, in the Time domain.
Both techniques follow Bederson [4] principles to preserve
users’ flow, to focus on tasks and prevent interruptions.

We conducted an on-line evaluation to assess how standard
interactions with ranking tables (sorting and changing time
with a slider), along with the two novel techniques, DRAG-
CELL and VIZ-RANK, can be effective for temporal tasks.
Our evaluation shows that the novel techniques efficiently
support temporal tasks, which are currently not supported by
ranking tables. We discuss the design implications of our

improvements and give some scenarios to apply À Table! to
other domains of application.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. A Domain description and task analysis for temporal navi-
gation techniques.

2. Two new techniques for temporal navigation in ranking
tables, one in the value domain (DRAG-CELL) and one in
the time domain (VIZ-RANK).

3. A crowdsourced evaluation of the two techniques along
with standard navigation techniques; we then discuss which
technique is well suited to which task according to the
results and present the main takeaways from the experiment.

Such results provide a framework for further experiments with
temporal tasks, and the design of novel navigation techniques
in both the Value domain and the Time domain. Numerous
application areas where ranking tables are important would
benefit from these results.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

Soccer ranking tables (Figure 2) are standard ranking tables,
i. e. tabular data vertically ordered according to values in one
column. Ranking tables have been extensively explored using
summarization, interaction and visualization techniques. As
far as we know, temporal exploration in tables has never been
investigated in a comprehensive way.

A rank is an ordering technique taking as input a set of items
S (e. g., teams) and provides a permutation of these items
according to one dimension (e. g., points, goals scored). A
rank is a function RANK : S → 0, ..., |S|−1, that generates up
to |S|! permutations, i. e. the number of ways the items in the
set can be uniquely ordered [11]. Ranks apply to dimensions
(columns) D, |D| > 0. Finally, a rank can be applied to
temporal values, where t ∈ T , with T a set of discrete events
(e. g., games in a championship). Sdi,tj is the ranking table,

which is a snapshot of a championship, ranked according to a
dimension di at a time tj .

A soccer ranking table usually has the following properties:
|S| = 20 teams; |D| = 10 dimensions; |T | = (|S| − 1) × 2,
i. e. |T | = 38 games; 0 ≤ t ≤ 38. An important property
of permutations in soccer championships is that the higher
t is, the less the teams’ permutation amplitude is important
because teams tend to have high points difference.

Ranking tables display tabular data and their visual design nor-
mally obey to guidelines. Tufte [21] suggests that minor visual
improvements, such as vertical alignment of characters and
row coloring with zebra patterns, enable comparison tasks and
reduce errors. Interacting with the rank order help users per-
form some tasks (e. g., finding maximum or minimum values)
faster, without scanning all the rows. Many software packages,
such as spreadsheets, implement ranking interactions. They
also provide formulas to summarize rows for more compact
representations with Pivot tables [23] by computing counts or
totals. The same principles can be applied to columns with
statistics such as averages of multiple columns or min/max
values to provide other ranking mechanisms [15].

Summarization of tables is an important challenge because
rankings are often longer than the screen. Visualization tech-
niques can provide compact representation of cells. Table-
Lens [15] represents tables using Focus+Context principles,
collapsing rows to their minimum size or up to a pixel. This
enables representing large tables on one screen as long as
the number of rows is less or equal than the number of pix-
els. However, one row is always expanded as a focus and the

content of the cells is visible. LineUp [9] also uses nested
compact visualizations in tables, but for headers showing the
distribution of values contained in the rows beneath.

Ranking also plays an important role in discovery, particularly
when tables are represented as a grid layout where visual
variables such as color encode values. It results in heatmap-
like representations [20], and ranking becomes the primary
interaction for finding patterns [16]. Such tables may become
very large and require space transformation techniques, such
as zooming or space folding techniques [8] to bring rows and
columns back together for comparison.

Visualization techniques to display ranks are mainly inspired
by line charts [13], and are also called bump charts because of
the visual effect that permutations provide. Slope Graph [21]
plots items’ values on two vertical axis—one for each time t1
and t2—and connects similar items from one axis to another
with a line. The slope of the line is a visual cue that conveys
the importance of the items’ value change. However, some
empty space may appear within the chart and elements may
overlap. Several recent attempts produced compact charts
reducing the amount of space and overlapping, while handling
scalability. RankExplorer [17] shows items ranking as a flow,
with glyphs wherever two items swap their ranks, or when an
item has a particular increase in rank. Generally, visualization
techniques are low-dimensional projections of data, that do
not keep the original multidimensional flavor and interactivity
of tables. They may also break users’ flow [4] because tabular
layouts are too different from line charts, which require a
cognitive overhead for users to connect both.

In summary, existing table improvements tackle the challenge
of better sorting, summarizing, and visualizing tables. These
techniques are usually not trivial for a non-expert, which may
explain why we did not find any in our empirical study. An-
other reason might be that techniques are not specifically tai-
lored for temporal navigation, as time is usually a tricky di-
mension that requires specific attention.

EMPIRICAL STUDY OF SOCCER RANKING TABLES

We conducted an empirical study to better understand current
soccer ranking tables design practices. Over the 44 tables
we collected, we observed that temporal navigation is rarely
supported, unless the table uses non-dynamic drop-down lists.

We also investigated the use of time in soccer newspapers by
collecting 51 articles. We realized that they constantly refer
to temporal trends or team performances during a time period,
that current table designs do not support well.

Time in Soccer Articles

We collected and analyzed 51 soccer articles, mainly from
two highly influential and visited websites: L’équipe1 (70%)
weekly summaries for the entire 2012/2013 Ligue 1 Cham-
pionship in France; and premierleague.com2 (20%) monthly
summaries of the 2012/2013 Premier League Championship in
the UK. This was completed with articles from Yahoo sports,
Wikipedia and other soccer websites (10%). The articles we
collected outlined main events of the week or month, and
illustrated them with statistics.

Out of the articles, we extracted up to 33 different tasks the
journalists had to perform to write these summaries. Then, we
grouped similar tasks into generic categories. For example,
both tasks “What is the number of points of Paris SG at week
17?” and “How many goals has Marseille scored until week 5?”
are subtasks of the generic category “What is the VALUE of
TEAM at t?”, where TEAM and t are the two known variables
and VALUE the unknown one. This grouping resulted in 18
generic task categories.

We observed that all the tasks categories are temporal. Indeed,
even the most basic task, such as “What is the VALUE of
TEAM?” implies knowing when to look at the value. When
t is not explicitly written, it is implicitly the latest week of
the championship. We also observed that the most important
column for ranking tables is the number of points of a team,
determining its rank in the championship. However, the other
dimensions also occur, to improve the summary details and
analysis. For example, analysts often report: the number of
scored goals or wins for the last n games of a team; the team’s
performances at home; or a series of consecutive games with
the same result (e. g., 5 losses in a raw).

To structure our analysis, we mapped the categories to the task
taxonomy for temporal data by Andrienko et al. [3]. Figure 3
illustrates the mapping and provides examples. They classify

the tasks into two categories. 1) Elementary tasks are local
tasks where the object of interest is a given value or a given
time. For example, such tasks are value estimation (e. g., find-
ing extrema [1]), comparison of values at different times and
time retrieval according to a given value. 2) Synoptic tasks are
global tasks involving the user to take into account a set of
values or a time interval. For example, such tasks are trend
estimation, trend comparison, and finding time intervals with
a given trend. Both categories contain direct and inverse tasks.
Direct tasks consist of estimating a value or a trend according
to a given time or time interval. Inverse tasks consist of esti-
mating the time or time interval for which a dimension has a
given value or trend. Finally, relation-seeking tasks consist of
finding relations between dimensions, values and time. For
example, such a task consists of comparing the value of a
dimension for one team with the value of another dimension
of another team, at different times.

We also conducted an interview with a soccer analyst in charge
of an influential French web site3 and asked him to evaluate
the fitness of each task category for soccer (Figure 3, Likert
scale values). One interesting result is that the expert considers
some categories to be important, despite not found in articles
(e. g., elementary relation-seeking tasks), suggesting that those
tasks are probably unconsciously in the head of our expert but
that he can not perform them with his current tools.

The expert and the task analysis together legitimate the tasks
that we classified in the taxonomy. The tasks our expert men-
tioned are, according to him, difficult to perform. In particular
because they involve ranks that change over time, which are
difficult to track with series of static tables. This suggests that
journalists have important questions that they are not easily
able to answer. Consequently, we focus on supporting tasks
and analysis questions that occur in this particular domain (i.e.
temporal navigation in ranking tables) in the rest of the paper.

Soccer Ranking Tables Visual and Interactive Design

We collected a series of 44 ranking tables for soccer, from UK
(39%), France (35%), Spain (11%), Argentina (9%), Brazil
and US (3% each). We extracted and ranked the visual features
of the collected tables, such as colors and decorations.

An example of an important feature in soccer tables is the
background color for the top-k ranks, such as the top-3 ranks
that qualify for the Champion’s League. Or the bottom-k
that indicates which team will downgrade to a minor league.
Such an apparently small visual aid is actually very useful, to
immediately know which team will earn additional revenues
with Champion’s Leagues games, or will lose revenues by
playing in a less popular league the next year.

For the top-3 rank, we found that only 50% of the tables high-
light the corresponding areas, and their design is inconsistent
(e. g., icons, colored rows, bold/dashed separators, colored
text, and gray scale). Tables also make use of Zebra (50%)
and embed visualizations: 27.3% show team logos, 29.5% add
an icon encoding the latest ranking evolution, and 13.6% rep-
resent the latest results using colored circles. As a reference,
Figure 2 shows a full table, with the most frequent features.

One of the main takeaways from our findings is that interac-
tion is rarely available. At best, the table provides the most
common column sorting (for 22.7% of analyzed ranking ta-
bles). At times, the table provides widgets to interact with the
temporal dimension: dropdown lists (11%), range selection
(6.8%), next/previous arrows (4.5%), discrete slider (2.3%).
However, it usually triggers a page reload, making the tracking
of changes between the two tables difficult.

We also observed an interesting type of ranking table mapping
rows on an absolute scale (linear scale of values, in this case
points) rather than the relative scale (linear scale of ranks).
It is referred as Absolute scale rank. Similarly as for Slope
Graph [21], it gives a better idea of the team’s distribution at
a given time. However, it requires more space as the count
of rows for such a table is not the number of teams, but the
difference of points between the first and the last team.

Time Navigation

Only 27% (12/44) of the tables implement temporal naviga-
tion while both soccer ranking tables and analyst tasks heavily
rely on time. When available, changing t is usually cumber-
some, with standard widgets—certainly because implemented
in every GUI—such as:

• Drop-down lists to directly jump to a specific time. They
cannot be used to dynamically browse a time interval but
are very efficient to select a particular time.

• Arrow widgets to jump to previous or next tables, with some
shortcuts to the beginning or the end of the championship.
They are efficient to navigate sequentially, step by step.

• Range slider for 6.8% (3/44), to select the data in [ti, tj ]
and compute the cell values between these two times.

• slider for 2.3% (one table) to support temporal navigation,
similarly to a seeking bar to scrub videos.

The results from our study highlight the lack of temporal
navigation mechanisms, and only one table featured a slider
which would be recommended as an efficient way to explore
such a quantitative data space [19]. We are not able to give any
explanation. From a technical perspective, standard widgets
are implemented in <HTML> and the data to compute ranking
tables are relatively small and freely available. From a user
perspective, we showed a dynamic slider to our soccer expert
and he found it of great value, wondering himself why he does
not provide one on his website.

IMPROVING TEMPORAL NAVIGATION

À Table! is an advanced ranking table that includes current
ranking table practices (Figure 4), with two novel techniques
for temporal navigation: DRAG-CELL is based on direct ma-
nipulation of values to browse ranks; VIZ-RANK uses a tran-
sient visualization of team ranks (line chart) to explore a cham-
pionship. Those techniques aim at improving the support of
temporal tasks we introduced in Figure 3.

Features from Current Ranking Tables

À Table! is a ranking table, along with the following features:

• Temporal Slider to give both an overview of the champi-
onship, and to provide a continuous temporal navigation.

it can have, and colored arrows indicate how teams would behave if the drag was released (green to red arrows). (c-d) Releasing the drag animates the

rows to their new position.

The slider is also synchronized with the two new interaction
techniques we describe below to convey visual feedback.

• Multiple teams selection by clicking on team names to select
and highlight their row, to facilitate their tracking over time.

• Column sorting by clicking on the table’s headers to apply
the rank function over a specific dimension.

Design Philosophy for the Novel Techniques

We designed DRAG-CELL and VIZ-RANK with the challenge
of preserving users’ flow. We followed Bederson [4] principles
by supporting both novice and experts with the same display.
While tabular display remains the default view, novel tech-
niques are activated with specific mouse interactions and new
representations are animated to prevent users’ interruptions.
User is always in control with incremental actions and a visual
feedback to constantly show what he is doing.

Because the design space for novel techniques is important,
we decided to focus on two techniques which support specific
temporal tasks that ranking tables or standard widgets do not
currently support: DRAG-CELL lets the user interact in the
value domain and VIZ-RANK in the time domain.

Novel Technique 1: Direct Manipulation of Values

From the task analysis, we observed that the expert estimated
as important several inverse tasks which were not frequent in
journalist articles. Inverse tasks are challenging to perform
using standard tables and it may explain why journalists avoid
these tasks. We designed DRAG-CELL to make easier to
perform these difficult tasks by interacting with cell values
directly (e. g., the number of points of a team): the user
manipulates the value domain instead of the time domain,
unlike standard navigation techniques such as a temporal
slider. Typically, DRAG-CELL allows users to quickly find if

columns until they disappear; then (c-d) the cells fade out and the time series of the cell’s value for the team fades in. Line charts with a thinner stroke

and when a value was reached. For example, a frequent task
consists of finding the time when a team reaches 42 points;
this specific value being the theoretical minimum number of
points a team needs to be safe from the downgrade area.

DRAG-CELL follows the principle of direct manipulation [18],
with teams as objects of interest and is inspired by Tangle [22].
The visual instance of teams are rows, and each cell can be
dragged to explore the values of the cell itself over t (Figure 5).
Releasing the drag changes the value of t for the table to the
local tc of the cell. The user’s flow is as follows:

1. Start: DRAG-CELL is activated by a mouse drag on a cell.
2. Then by dragging the mouse up and down, the cell value

changes for all possible values for this cell.
3. Arrows indicate the preview of each team’s behavior over

time if the drag was released: the arrows range from point-
ing down and red (e. g., the team is going down a lot) to
heading up and green (e. g., the team is going up a lot).

4. Additionally, the temporal slider displays a visual feedback
as a preview of the current tc.

5. End: Once the drag is released, tc is applied to the table.
Rows permute with animation to their new rank position.

Novel Technique 2: Line Charts as Transient Objects

VIZ-RANK displays a temporary or transient line chart when
a user clicks on a cell (Figure 7). This line chart displays
the teams’ ranks over the whole championship. The user can
click on one point on the chart and t is set according to the
corresponding value. The user’s flow is as follows:

1. Start: VIZ-RANK is activated by a mouse click on a cell.
2. Then, an animated staged transition [10] transforms the

table into a time-line format by successive widening of
columns and rows (Figure 6).

3. A line chart is displayed with the X-axis encoding the whole
championship time range and the Y-axis the dimension of
the cell the user clicked on. Each team line is encoded
with Semantically-Resonant Colors [12] that matches teams’
logo (which is also displayed at the end of the lines).

4. The line chart displays by default the ranks, but the Y-axis
can also encode the absolute values (Figure 7).

5. A visual feedback displays a vertical bar at the current
mouse position to enable comparison. The team associated
to the cell the user clicked on is highlighted.

6. End: When clicking on the chart, it is animated back to its
table form with t corresponding to the click x coordinate.

Figure 7. The two available line chart types: Rank (left) or Value (right).

A click on a team’s name or logo on the right selects the team.

The staged transitions are similar to the ones from the table
to the line chart, but in reverse order.

CROWDSOURCED EVALUATION

We conducted an evaluation to assess how standard interac-
tions, along with DRAG-CELL and VIZ-RANK, can be effec-
tive for temporal tasks. We also expect to identify which task
categories discriminate the techniques.

Methodology

We released À Table! on the web during a 3-week period, for
a crowdsourced evaluation. Crowdsourcing is the use of an
unknown public to perform simple tasks [14]. Participants
(workers) are usually recruited through online markets (e. g.,
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk) and paid to obtain results of qual-
ity. We crowdsourced the evaluation because the target user
is specific (soccer enthusiast with interest in statistics) and to
keep unaltered their environment (they usually browse special-
ized websites) without paying them. We also picked up this
evaluation method because existing tables do not support dy-
namic temporal navigation and have very inconsistent designs,
thus a traditional lab experiment with a baseline comparison
would not be appropriate.

We evaluated participants’ performance using a quiz (Figure 4,
top right). We designed the quiz’s questions based on the
extracted tasks for soccer analysis (similar as the examples
in Table 3). We also displayed the quiz high scores as an
incentive to engage visitors.

Implementation

À Table! is implemented using JavaScript and D3 [5] to run in
any modern web browser. The web page is available in English
and French at https://github.com/charlesperin/atable.
We implemented the table and the temporal slider on the
left; the quiz and the high scores on the right (Figure 4).

We also added a tutorial as instructions for the novel tech-
niques on the bottom right, using a slide-show of animated
GIFs. A help button at the bottom opened a help page on
how to use the table. The experimental setting is available at
http://charles.perin.free.fr/atable. We collected feed-
back from participants with an on-line questionnaire, reached
either by clicking on a feedback button or once the quiz is com-
pleted. We used the data from the French Ligue 1 2012/2013
championship.

Hypotheses

Our hypotheses for the experiment are as follows:

H1: side tutorials will help users to activate and learn the
novel techniques, even without visual cues or affordances
on the table.

H2: the temporal slider will be faster for elementary direct
lookup/comparison because these tasks only require chang-
ing t and browsing the table.

H3: DRAG-CELL will be the fastest for elementary inverse
lookup/comparison tasks, tasks it was designed for.

H4: VIZ-RANK will be errorless for synoptic tasks because
it expresses best the temporal evolution of values over the
whole time span.

H5: VIZ-RANK will be slower for all tasks because the
mental representation of the teams for users changes.

Tasks

Participants performed tasks issued from each category (Fig-
ure 3) using our previously set of 33 tasks. We equally dis-
tributed elementary and synoptic tasks. Task variables were
randomly generated with some constraints to avoid trivial
tasks where the participant’s knowledge of the data would be
enough to answer. Participants had to answer 36 questions
correctly to complete the quiz.

Participants

We recruited participants by advertising the web page URL us-
ing social networks, mailing lists and soccer forums, to select
appropriate participants interested in soccer and statistics.

Incentive Impact: after two weeks, among the 141 visitors
who resulted in 242 tasks performed, only one fully completed
the quiz and answered the questionnaire. We observed the
following recurring pattern: most visitors interacted with the
table, answered a few questions and then dropped out without
finishing the quiz. To encourage visitors to answer more
questions and eventually complete the quiz, as an incentive we

advertised free cinema tickets to participants with the highest
scores. This immediately resulted in a stronger engagement
from the participants.

Demography: we extracted the following informations from
Google Analytics: most of the visitors were from France
(60.5%), then United States (17.4%), United Kingdom (4.9%)
and Canada (3%). 53.1% used French and 46.9% English.

Participation Logs

We logged all participants’ interactions, such as: column sort-
ing, team highlighting, slider navigation, DRAG-CELL and
VIZ-RANK interactions. We recorded the following values for
each quiz answer: quiz session, question number, id, and cate-
gory; time to perform the task; participant’s answer; correct
answer; associated interactions ids.

Results

Over a 3-week period, we registered 1292 visits and 648 vis-
itors performed at least one task. We discarded the data for
participants who performed less than 10 tasks and the 239
answers longer than 120 seconds. 143 performed more than
10 tasks (G1), 62 participants completed the quiz (G2) and
34 filled the questionnaire. Only participants who completed
the quiz filled the questionnaire. This results in 6693 tasks
performed and 185 636 interaction logs.

Quantitative results: participants used VIZ-RANK for 31% of
their answers, DRAG-CELL for 9%, and exclusively the other
features for 60%. We performed the quantitative analysis using
G1 results—the larger dataset—because we did not find any
significant difference between G1 and G2. Figure 8 shows the
time and error for all task categories according to performed
interactions. We grouped the answers from participants using
VIZ-RANK and other interactions into VR, DRAG-CELL and
other interactions into DC, and other interactions (exclusively)
into O. When both DRAG-CELL and VIZ-RANK were trig-
gered, we counted the last interaction as the one that led to the
answer. We performed Anovas when the data had a normal
distribution (we applied a log transform to the measures of
time) and when the analysis of variance allowed it (Bartlett’s
K-squared). We used a Welsh two-sample t-test (unequal sam-
ple size and variance) for pairwise means comparison. We
report significant results only in Table 1.

Interactions: Figure 9 shows which interactions were per-
formed, for correct and incorrect answers: all the interactions
have a higher percentage of use for correct answers than for

incorrect ones. The most frequent interaction is changing the
value of t (for more than 80% of correct answers) and was
triggered most using the temporal slider, then VIZ-RANK and
DRAG-CELL. Participants used the team selection for 70% of
the tasks, and column sorting for a third.

Qualitative Results: Figure 10 shows the participant’s scores
on Likert scales for their background, questions on the inter-

face and more specific questions about À Table! features. The
main observation is that participants’ satisfaction with existing
ranking tables is low: 91% (31/34) of the participants would
like to have access to such an interactive table on their favorite
soccer website. Indeed, they estimate it offers better ways to
analyze soccer championships (74% of the participants discov-

ered unknown information during the quiz). Interestingly, they
scored the team selection, the column sorting and the temporal
slider as the most useful features. However, none complained
that the novel techniques were distracting, or that they were
disturbing obstacles to perform the tasks.

DISCUSSION

Observations from Experiment and Main Findings

Soccer enthusiasts with heterogeneous backgrounds in Infor-

mation Visualization discovered and performed À Table! in-
teractions. Our investigation confirms H1, although users
rated the interface as difficult to use. We also had to provide
an incentive in order to engage participants and make them
complete all the tasks.

Some participants commented that it was difficult to discover
the interactions. For example, one participant wrote: “I think
it has a low discoverability for the graph and the drag in the
cell”. DRAG-CELL and VIZ-RANK are relatively advanced
techniques, performed directly on the table, to let users focus
on their task. For such techniques, discoverability is a well
known problem (as noted by Bederson [4]). We provided a side
tutorial for beginners to learn by example. However, the results
showed that almost all participants discovered both techniques
by exploring the table, without using this side tutorial and they
often accidentally triggered the interactions the first time. In
fact, both DRAG-CELL and VIZ-RANK appear to be quite
discoverable without specific affordance.

Answers to the questionnaire confirm the interest from soccer

enthusiasts for À Table!: 74% of them discovered new infor-
mation and 31/34 participants gave a score higher than 3 on
the 1-5 Likert scale to rate how À Table! offers better ways of
analyzing soccer championships. For example, one participant
wrote: “wish I had it for my own championship (UK)”.

O is faster than VR for both elementary direct lookup and
comparison. This is explained because choosing the appropri-
ate value for t is enough to perform the task well and using
VIZ-RANK makes the user waste time. O is also faster than
DC for elementary direct lookup, so we partially confirm H2.



For both elementary inverse lookup and comparison, DC has
the lowest mean time and is significantly faster than VR and
we partially confirm H3. We also note that for inverse lookup
tasks, we did not find any significant difference between DC
and O because the standard deviation for O was too high,
although it was the slowest technique overall. DRAG-CELL
was rarely used, but when it was, participants performed tasks
faster and with fewer errors. These results confirm that DRAG-
CELL is efficient to perform the tasks it was designed for.

For four synoptic tasks (identification definition, identification
search, inverse comparison, and relation seeking) VR has sig-
nificantly less error than O, participants making respectively
3.6, 4.1, 3.1 and 1.3 times less error using VIZ-RANK. We
did not find any significant difference between DC and VR for
these tasks but the mean error is the smallest for VR and we
partially confirm H4. We also note that DC has less error than
O for the identification definition task.
VR is the slowest for five out of the six tasks for which we were
able to analyze time, with VR being almost twice as long as O
for several tasks. For half the tasks with significant difference,
VR is slower than both DC and O and we partially confirm H5.
We explain this result because participants may not be familiar
with line charts. However, it is not clear if this is a general
issue, if this is in the context of rank visualization or because
of the short apparition of the chart.
Participants used VIZ-RANK for complex synoptic and
relation-seeking tasks that are extremely painful to perform
without a dedicated technique. The technique involves fewer
errors but requires more time. However, because journalists
cannot afford to publish incorrect data, the technique must be
accurate, even at the cost of a slight increase in completion
time; comparing time between techniques makes sense when
the techniques have similar error rates, which is not the case.

The main takeaways from our experiment are as follows:

• Basic interactions remain essential, fast to operate and easy
to learn for basic tasks. However, some tasks are almost
impossible to perform using only these features (up to 82%
of error) and advanced interaction techniques are required.

• Interactive techniques are crucial to explore temporal rank-
ing tables. The more interactions are used, the more the
task is performed correctly (Figure 10).

• DRAG-CELL is fast and error-less for the tasks it was de-
signed for (inverse tasks) but almost never used for other
task categories.

• VIZ-RANK is accurate and well-suited to synoptic tasks and
all tasks can be performed using it. However, it is slow to
operate and requires user’s basic knowledge in Information
Visualization.

Finally, both DRAG-CELL (for elementary inverse lookup and
comparison) and VIZ-RANK (for four out of the five synoptic
tasks categories) makes it easier to perform the tasks they were
designed for. Moreover, several of these tasks were almost
absent from the task analysis from soccer articles but were
estimated as highly relevant by the expert. We may expect
that by providing such interaction techniques as DRAG-CELL
and VIZ-RANK, the analysts will be able to perform tasks they

can not perform today and therefore enhance the quality of the
insights and statistics they can retrieve from the data.

Applicability Beyond Soccer and Limits

À Table! is seamlessly applicable to other sport ranking tables

showing team statistics. We now describe À Table! applicabil-
ity to two types of ranking tables from different domains and
discuss possible issues and limits.

Academic Rankings

Since 2003, the Shanghai University [6] publishes every year
an updated Academic Ranking of World Universities. It ranks
the top |S| = 500 institutions, with |D| = 6 dimensions. The
main rank is computed on the number of Nobel Price or Fields
Medal winners from the institution, among other criteria. Top
institutions like Harvard and MIT are respectively ranked first
and second, and tracking them over time can be done visually.

À Table! would be efficient to browse the top-k, k = 20 ranks
for which permutations are important but mostly remain on the
same screen. However, some issues occur for ranks lower than
100 which are not all visible without scrolling and contain ties.
Furthermore, it only ranks the top-500 universities every year,
meaning that new institutions may appear or disappear over
time, making their tracking difficult.

Sorting Algorithms Execution

Sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or bubble sort, perform
many permutations until they end in a final result. The number
of permutations varies according to the size of the dataset
|S|. The type of permutations varies according to the algo-
rithm itself. Existing works already explored the visualization
of execution steps4 which enable a non-expert to grasp the

underlying sorting strategy. À Table! would be useful to in-
spect executions and to reach a specific execution step or time.
Such an investigation of algorithms—or any ordered dynamic
process—can be used in a variety of contexts, ranging from
educational purpose to algorithms optimization.

Limits

Some real-life rankings may not be immediately compatible

with current À Table! design. It is already challenging to
visualize and interact with rankings with partial ranks, missing
data during time intervals, new dimensions, etc. In contrast,
tables do justice to such rankings by creating empty rows or
additional columns to represent missing data. It may not be
optimal but it has the merit of being a consistent representation.

Design Implications

Adding novel interactive techniques to legacy techniques, such
as ranking tables, implies many design considerations. We
only scratched the surface of making them fully effective, and
we share some lessons we learned on their discover-ability
and learn-ability. Discover-ability is mainly connected to
the affordance of the first interaction to start the technique.
We did not use any for simplicity, and considered natural to
change values by dragging them up and down. Some codes for
affordance are already available, such as Bret Victor’s [22] use
of dashed lines to show draggable values. Learn-ability can

4

be supported in many ways. The tutorial we provided during
our experiment was probably not sufficiently contextualized,
explaining why most of the participants discarded it. It seems
that it was natural for users to click and drag cells as they are
their primary interest. They may have acquired this knowledge

elsewhere and applied it to À Table! by associativity [2]. Line
charts provide visual guides, but require space and time to
appear. Exploring hybrid features, such as dragging values
with a visual overlay showing upcoming and past values, might
be the best of the two worlds but needs more investigation.
Still, regular dragging can be left as an expert-feature [4].

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This paper presented À Table!, an enhanced ranking table
with improved temporal navigation, by combining two novel
interaction techniques. Initially, our goal was to better sup-
port ranking tables interactivity and representation of time,
as the temporal dimension is crucial to understand soccer
championships. We designed novel interactions following
Bederson [4] principles to preserve user’s flow, to focus on
tasks and prevent interruption. Our evaluation shows that the
techniques efficiently support temporal tasks, currently not
supported by ranking tables, while not breaking user flow.
This paves the way for efficiently introducing advanced vi-
sual exploration techniques to millions of soccer enthusiasts
who use tables everyday, as well as other application domains
which use ranking tables.

We also thought to design novel navigation techniques to in-

clude in À Table!. One of them is using a table cube metaphor,
with a transient 3D animation similar as Rolling the Dice [7],
to change a time t or a dimension d step-by-step. This
type of transition provides a consistent temporal navigation
paradigm—adequate with tables which are also squared—and
perfectly fits in table boundaries.
