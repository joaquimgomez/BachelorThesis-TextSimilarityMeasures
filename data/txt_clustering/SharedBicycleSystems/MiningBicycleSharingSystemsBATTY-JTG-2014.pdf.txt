Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are becoming increasingly popular in towns and cities around the
world. They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments.
This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 sys-
tems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive
database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a par-
ticular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and
others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation
of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system’s extent, infers the likely demographics
and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and
diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such pat-
terns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing
operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the sys-
tem area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle
lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of trans-
port research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more
easily modelled and validated. Such work lays foundations for the analysis of larger scale transport sys-
tems by creating a classification of the different systems and seeks to demonstrate that bike-shares have
a lot to offer both as an effective method of transport and a rich source of data.

1. Introduction

Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are a relatively new form
of transport in many urban areas. There are around 450 such sys-
tems currently operating worldwide (DeMaio and Meddin, 2012)
and analysing the relatively freely available data for many of them
generates insights into the habits of their users and, by proxy,
movements within urban areas (Padgham, 2012).

Bike-shares are typically single systems located in and around
the commercial or business centres of their host towns and cities.
Exceptions include suburb-based systems such as Mexico City (Ka-
zis, 2012) or Taipei City (Tso, 2009), or those extending well be-
yond the city core, as is the case for Barcelona. Current bike-
shares [characterised in the literature as ‘‘third-generation’’ (see
DeMaio, 2009; Haverman, 2010)], make use of technology to oper-
ate on a largely automated basis. There are two typical configura-
tions – the docking point/docking station model where bicycles are
hired from a docking point in one of a fixed number of docking sta-
tions in the host area, then later returned to a docking point within
another (or the same) docking station; and the free-placement
model where bicycles are obtained typically from crossroads in
the system area. This paper will focus on systems using the former
configuration as, having a fixed set of locations for the start and
end of each journey with a measureable number of bicycles at
these locations, such systems tend to produce more readily avail-
able and usable data. An example implementation of the latter ap-
proach, not studied further here, is Berlin’s Callabike system.

Bike-shares attract a range of users from professional commut-
ers to students, local residents running errands, leisure users and
tourists (JZTI, 2010, p. 36–7). System operators can influence usage
behaviour by, for example, prohibiting certain user types, such as
in Barcelona, where users must live in the city (introduced to avoid
a perceived impact on an existing manual tourist cycle hire busi-
ness) (OBIS, 2011, p. 14). The result is that the temporal character-
istics of the dominant flows of cyclists will vary between systems
presenting each operator with a unique set of challenges to ensure
the bicycles are appropriately distributed to meet demand. For
example, bike-shares that have a dominant commuter pattern,
such as that in London, often suffer from particularly asymmetric
flows, making effective redistribution an important part of the sys-
tem’s success.

The latest bike-share systems enable users to monitor cycle
availability and docking station spaces via near real-time online
maps. These websites often specify and supply an applications pro-
gramming interface (API) for external software developers to ac-
cess the underlying data. In addition, a number of system
operators release datasets pertaining to individual journeys made
over a particular time period. Both types of data offer insights in
the usage of particular bike-shares and provide a ready basis for
utilisation in transport research. A small number of previous stud-
ies have been undertaken and generally concern the characteristics
of a single city’s system, often with a focus on user demographics.
Jensen et al. (2010), for example, analysed 11.6 million journeys of
the Vélo’v bicycle sharing system in Lyon, constructing a map
showing the likely flows of the bicycles across the city. Several
characteristics emerged; namely greatly enhanced usage during
public transport strikes, and variations in average speeds through
the day such as for example, a small but significant increase in
speed just before 9 a.m. as cycle commuters hurry to complete
their journeys before the start of normal working hours. One
intriguing result was that the average speed during the morning
commute was greatest on Wednesdays, the authors conjecturing
that this was due to a greater proportion of users on Wednesdays
being men, due to the tradition of at-home childcare by women on
this day.

Elsewhere in Europe, Barcelona’s Bicing bike-share exhibits five
spatial clusters of docking stations based on activity (i.e. usage)
variation throughout the day and six separate spatial clusters
based on the intra-day change of availability of bicycles in each
docking station (Froehlich et al., 2009). In addition, Kaltenbrunner
et al. (2010) looked at the system’s usage patterns across seven
weeks, and also developed a simple model to predict future trends.
Like Froehlich et al. (2009), they used docking station data rather
than data on individual journeys. Differences between weekday
and weekend usage were apparent, and peak usages at different
parts of the day depended on the proximity of each docking station
to retail, academic and workplace locations.

More recently, Lathia et al. (2012) published results from the
London bicycle sharing system’s docking station data and as with
Kaltenbrunner et al. (2010) and Jensen et al. (2010) characteristic
usage peaks and significant weekday/weekend differences
emerged. The research focused on the change in the usage patterns
following the introduction of ‘‘casual’’ usage, where credit cards
could be used in place of a dedicated key. He also identified six
clusters of docking stations, grouped by similar intra-day usage
patterns, and observed slight changes to these clusters once the ca-
sual usage of the system was introduced. The clusters were found
to be grouped spatially, and showed a distinctive ‘‘ring and core’’
structure. Finally, Vogel et al. (2011) collected data for 0.74 million
journeys undertaken in the Citybike bicycle sharing system in
Vienna. From these, five spatially similar groups of docking sta-
tions emerged thus suggesting, in line with many of the studies ci-
ted above, distinct groups of users using the bicycles at similar
times and for similar journeys.

This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing pat-
terns by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the
Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this,
an extensive database has been created over a number of years
to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and this of-
fers a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them.

After outlining the method used to obtain and process the data,
this paper discusses various metrics which can be used to gain in-
sights into and to classify each bicycle sharing system, based both
on non-spatial and spatial attributes of the docking station loca-
tions and temporal usage statistics. A tentative qualitative classifi-
cation, based on the observed metrics, is proposed. The paper
concludes by discussing potential further applications of the data
studied, such as demographic analysis and the role of, and benefit
to, operator redistribution activity.
2. Managing docking station data

The data are collected automatically (normally from operator-
run websites) and include locations, capacity and current load fac-
tor of docking stations, for various systems around the world. A
script, written in the Python programming language, and custom-
ised for each system, is run on a regular basis to access the bike-
share’s docking station data online.

The load factor, the key measure in this study, is the proportion
of docking points in each docking station that currently have a
bicycle available to hire. It is normally calculated from the number
of bicycles and the number of free spaces in each docking station,
which is the basic statistic for each docking station. The load in the
‘‘load factor’’ term therefore is a reference to a load of bicycles fill-
ing docking points – rather than a load of bicycles from the system
being used on the streets. Systems that do not make this informa-
tion available online – a key metric for users trying to discover
bicycles or free spaces in their vicinity – are not included in this
study.

It is recognised that the variation in load factor is not a perfect
measure of the performance or popularity of a system. Theoreti-
cally, systems that are very well used but very quick to redistribute
bicycles back to points of need will show a similar variation in load
factor to those systems that are poorly used. In reality, the practi-
calities and costs of ensuring the rate and scale of bicycle redistri-
bution required to alter the load factor in this way are prohibitive.
On this basis we feel the load factor metric remains the most
appropriate for this study.

In many cases, the data are extracted from embedded online
mapping Application Programming Interface (API) instances (nor-
mally the Google Maps API) which typically contain a collection
of pin-style markers, representing the docking stations, with the
capacity and load factor appearing as statistics attached to each
marker. In some cases, the operators provide dedicated APIs, typi-
cally in XML or JSON format. Such data streams are often used for
mobile phone applications or dashboard monitoring of the system
concerned. In some cases there are practical or technical difficul-
ties obtaining the data in a timely fashion directly from the system
operator. In such cases third party APIs, often run by volunteers
based in the city concerned, have been used to access the data in
a standardised format.

The data are typically collected every two minutes, except
where the system’s server is slow to respond, in which case the
data is collected every 10 or 20 min. This frequency is sufficient
to accurately show the activity and availability changes throughout
the day, highlighting commuter ‘‘rush hours’’ and other features.
Our database covers a period of up to 2 years and over 80 cities.
It is therefore the most comprehensive of its kind. For this study
we focus on data collected throughout September 2012.

A few systems also provide journey origin–destination data, on
a historical basis. The data are normally provided by the operator
on a bulk-load basis, rather than being queryable from an API or
map. Such data are not used in this study because of the small
number of systems which make the data available in this way,
meaning that a comparative study is difficult.
3. Characterising global bike-shares based on their docking
stations

This study seeks to compare and contrast the structure of vari-
ous bike-shares, by looking at the ‘‘footprint’’ of their docking sta-

tions, and the spatio-temporal changes in bicycle distribution
within them.

Of the 38 bike-shares studied, 16 fall in Europe and the Middle
East, 11 in Asia, 9 in the Americas and 2 in Australasia. The bike-
shares studied have at least 40 docking stations, a clean feed of
data and are each contained within a single city. A small number
of the selected systems have been more recently set up for data
collection, or have substantially changed in size during this collec-
tion period but their data, upon examination, have been found to
be sufficient for inclusion.

Looking at the relative locations of docking stations in each sys-
tem, and the diurnal and weekly variations in the aggregated load
factor (the proportion of docking points across the docking stations
with bicycles docked to them) a number of characteristics can be
compared and contrasted. These features have been grouped into
three types – aggregate characteristics that provide simple (non-
spatial) measures for each system, spatial characteristics that look
at the placing of docking stations within each system, and tempo-
ral characteristics.

Aggregate characteristics measured include the maximum
number of docking stations, the maximum number of bicycles in
the docking stations, and the biggest change between the daily
maximum and minimum number of bicycles – a measure of max-
imum simultaneous use). From these, the maximum load factor
and maximum intraday load factor change can be simply calcu-
lated. These characteristics are generally measured during Septem-
ber 2012.

Spatial characteristics of the docking station footprints analysed
include the latitude of the centroid of the system, the system’s area
of influence, the observed mean distance between docking sta-
tions, the Z-score (which describes whether the system’s footprint
is statistically clustered, random or dispersed) and the compact-
ness ratio (a measure of the system’s shape compared with a the-
oretical circular footprint around its centre).

Temporal characteristics include the load factor and a norma-
lised measure of the redistribution needed to even out the load
across the system, and how both these measures vary on an intra-
day and weekday/weekend basis. The measures are obtained by
regularly counting up the number of full and empty docking points,
within each docking station. For the load factor measure, these are
simply aggregated across the system. The redistribution measure
compares the deviation of each docking station’s load factor with
the average across the system at that time.
The following sections detail the results of analysis of these
three sets of characteristics in turn that are then used as a basis
for classifying the different bike-share systems.

3.1. Aggregate characteristics

The size of a system can be expressed in terms of the number of
docking stations, the number of docking points (which are grouped
into docking stations) or the number of bicycles available to use in
the system. As a bicycle is essential for use of the system, the latter
metric is used here. This is measured by examining the number of
bicycles available and taking the maximum number typically ob-
served on a normal day during the period of study (shown in
Fig. 1), that is a day where a typical cycle of usage is seen, so
excluding days with special events. The number of bicycles avail-
able dips during periods of high usage such as at the beginning
and end of a working day, and reaches a maximum typically
around 3 a.m. A caveat is that some systems may be gradually
expanding (although not significantly during the relatively short
period of study here) or may have different numbers available on
weekdays and at weekends, to manage differing usage levels and
spatial patterns.

Operator redistributions can also affect availability although a
temporal analysis of the load factor, which is detailed later, reveals
that most systems see little change in the value during the early
morning, indicating that operator redistribution does not contrib-
ute significantly to the low usage of bicycles during these quiet
periods. Indeed, operators may not want to redistribute overnight
as the morning commuters will likely want the bicycles to be in the
same place that they left them the previous evening.

The system size can be contrasted with the docking station size
– average number of docking points in each system’s set of docking
stations. Smaller-scale systems will often use smaller docking sta-
tions for economic reasons. There is a weak direct correlation
(R2 = 0.1, although rising to R2 = 0.3 if excluding Asia), shown in
Fig. 1, between docking station size and system size. For clarity,
only a selection of cities are named in each figure in this section,
but all cities, and their values plotted, are listed in Table 1.

Paris stands out as the largest system in this study – it is be-
lieved to be the third largest in the world at present behind two
Chinese systems, Wuhan and Hangzhou (Jinran and Xiaodong,
2012), for which data are not currently available. It also has rela-
tively large docking stations.

American systems generally build smaller docking stations
(that is, with fewer docking points for each station, on average)
when compared to other regions in this study, but this may reflect
different manufacturer preferences and system specification as
much as usage differences. By contrast, Asian systems generally
have larger than average docking stations. Larger docking stations
allow for the bursts of asymmetric, concentrated flows in particu-
lar areas that are characteristic of commuters.

An additional aggregate characteristic is the proportion of dock-
ing points that are filled by bicycles at the point of maximum avail-
ability. This is known as the maximum load factor or alternatively
the maximum Normalised Available Bicycles, or NAB (Froehlich
et al., 2009):
Lmax ¼ Bmax=D ¼ Bmax=ðBmax þ SðBmaxÞÞ
le
Lmax ¼Maximum Load Factor; Bmax
¼Maximum bicycles available;D ¼ Docking points; SðBmaxÞ
¼ Spaces available at point where maximum bicycles availab

As well as the maximum of the load factor being a useful statis-
tic for a system, the temporal variations in the load factor are also a
key metric that is discussed further below.
A final aggregate characteristic is one of popularity. This can be
inferred by observing the peak utilisation of the bicycles and is cal-
culated by looking at the maximum change, in a single day during
September 2012, the period of study, of the number of bicycles
available:

Udmax ¼ ðBdmax � BdminÞ=Bdmax
Udmax ¼Maximum concurrent usage for day; Bdmax
¼Maximum bicycles available in day; Bdmin
¼Minimum bicycles available in day

The result represents a popular day’s usage within each system,
probably during good weather and with a minimum of docking
stations disabled for maintenance. The day could have been a
weekend day or weekday, depending on when a system’s most
popular usage occurs. It is important to note that it is the maxi-
mum concurrent usage is being measured, rather than the popular-
ity directly. This is considered to be proportional to the total daily
use of the system, in the absence of journey data being available. In
systems where the usage is low or the journeys are short in dura-
tion, then the concurrent maximum measurement may underesti-
mate the total daily use, while still providing a useful indication of
activity.

266 O. O’Brien et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 34 (2014) 262–273
Less popular systems may use a higher maximum load factor so
that bicycles are more readily available for use in most docking sta-
tion locations without a danger of overloading the system, and to
visually attract potential users. More popular systems will lower
the load factor to allow the system to work efficiently during peri-
ods of high simultaneous usage – particularly systems which have
a strong uni-directional flow at certain times, e.g. commutes into a
city centre. Popular systems where usage is predominately tourist
or utility based, so less likely to see uni-directional flow, can how-
ever work efficiently with a higher load factor due to the more ran-
dom nature of the movement of the bicycles.

Time-based charges mean that non-availability of a docking sta-
tion at the end of a journey is considered a much worse situation
than non-availability of bicycles at the start, hence the need for
operators to specify their maximum load factors carefully, taking
into account predominant usage types and the degree of uni-direc-
tional flow that may happen.

A maximum load factor of just under 50% (one bicycle for two
docking points) is typical for most bike-shares, with Europe’s aver-
age of 45% being slightly lower, and America’s average of 50% being
slightly higher, than the worldwide average of 48%. This may re-
flect the different predominant cultural usage types of bicycles in
the different regions. It is acknowledged that the differences in
maximum load factors vary much more between systems within

each region, than between the regions. This reflects that practical
considerations within each city, such as the geographical structure
of a city, population density and the system’s size (both absolute
and relative to the city population), equipment funding and redis-
tribution resources, ultimately are more likely key determinants of
each system’s implemented maximum load factor.

The London system was specified with a docking point to bicy-
cle ratio of 1.7 to 1, equating to an unusually high maximum load
factor of 59% (Transport for London, 2009, p. 10) and launched with
a load factor of 54%. It then gradually reduced to around 50% as the
overall system size increased over the first year of operation – the
total number of bicycles in the system being in fact reduced
slightly as the same time as new docking stations were opened.
During September 2012 it was at 45%, but then increasing gradu-
ally in bicycles available during the wintertime, viable because of
lower usage, and a corresponding decrease in summertime.

Australasia’s systems, relatively unpopular in this study due to
local bylaws requiring helmet use, also have noticeably higher
maximum load factors than the other regions. Aside from this,
the implied inverse correlation between popularity and load factor
is only weakly visible (see Fig. 2).

Taipei City’s system stands out in both sets of comparative
charts above, as having the largest average docking station size
and the lowest maximum load factor of all the systems studied –

this may be due to the compact and off-centre location of its cen-
tral business district compared with the rest of the city, resulting in
fewer, but larger docking stations, and a low load factor needed to
manage large bursts of commuter usage to and from this area.

Rio de Janeiro’s system is small but sees many days of extre-
mely high usage – especially on weekends – where few bicycles re-
main available for hire by additional users for a significant portion
of the day. The strong weekend bias is likely due to use of the sys-
tem by tourists, as this bike-share is located beside several large
beaches – a high tourist use is also suggested by the period of high
usage extending throughout much of the day – tourists are likely to
be less price-sensitive and so less likely to return their bicycle dur-
ing the first hire time band (typically an hour) where the usage
charge is minimal. Fig. 3 shows the typical change in availability
of bicycles across the first part of September 2012, the larger
troughs corresponding to weekend days or public holidays. Week-
days show a slight ‘‘double dip’’ of likely commuter usage but con-
tained within an overarching single large dip, again likely due to
high tourist use regardless of it being a weekend or weekday. These
weekly, daily and intraday patterns continue throughout the year,
with the city’s warm year-round weather resulting in only small
seasonal variations.

These variations in load factor, which provide some insight into
the high maximum load factor aggregate characteristic for Rio, are
studied in more detail below.
3.2. Spatial characteristics

For each system a 1 km buffer around each docking station is
applied with the resulting shape approximating the area of influ-
ence of the system. One kilometre is chosen as a compromise be-
tween the maximum straight-line distance that someone would
likely walk in order to reach a docking station (see Daniels and
Mulley, 2011) and that which a user would likely cycle beyond
the physical system boundary. We concede this is a generous crite-
rion for many systems; for example in designing the London bicy-
cle sharing system a guideline separation of 300 m was targeted
(Mayor of London, 2010, p. 1). This is equivalent to specifying a
buffer of 150 m, that if applied, creates a large number of ‘‘holes’’
that clearly are not present in the context of known usage charac-
teristics. The resulting geographic extents of the 38 systems stud-
ied here vary considerably from 20 km2 to 200 km2, with a

significant cluster around 50 km2. In addition, nearest-neighbour
analysis was also performed to measure the average distance be-
tween each docking station and its closest partner. Results from
this indicate that approximately 50% of the systems have an aver-
age around 300–400 m.

It should be noted that Euclidean distances are used here rather
than network distances. It is assumed that the two are directly pro-
portional, that the latter distances for cycling journeys are not sig-
nificantly longer, and that this proportion is approximately the
same across the systems such that using Euclidean distances is a
justifiable simplification. All the systems studied are based in ur-
ban areas, which typically have a high density of intersections,
allowing journeys to be made in any direction by using road or
bicycle lane infrastructure, with the distance travelled unlikely to
be far beyond the straight-line distance. The physical effort exerted
in cycling means that cyclists are much less predisposed to taking
long detours than car drivers or other transport users (e.g. metro
riders) who are more constrained within their network. Cities also
generally act to maximise the permeability of movement for
pedestrians and cyclists. A Euclidean distance simplification is less
likely to be valid for rural areas, with a lower road and intersection
density.

Based on the relationship between these two attributes, Paris
and Bordeaux are distinct; Paris has the largest area but also main-
tains a high density of docking stations whilst Bordeaux’s system
has a compact core, but also many docking stations separated by
several kilometres from their nearest neighbour in the suburbs.
There is no significant variation of the areas or densities seen
across world regions.

Finally, two dimensionless statistical measures of system shape
and layout are obtained. The compactness ratio, also known as the
circularity ratio, describes how circle-like each system’s shape is. It
compares the area of the polygon formed by the buffer creation
around each docking station, with the area of a circle that has a cir-
cumference equal to the buffer polygon. A perfectly circular, or
compact, system has a compactness ratio of 1. Systems with very
low compactness ratios are more irregularly shaped.

C ¼ 4pA=L2

C ¼ Compactness Ratio; A ¼ buffer area; L
¼ circumference of the buffer
est-neighbour distances.



268 O. O’Brien et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 34 (2014) 262–273
Asian systems have generally lower compactness ratios (aver-
aging 0.55) than European/Middle Eastern ones (averaging 0.72).
This notable difference suggests larger, less compact settlements
that need to meander in shape around local geographies, are more
present in Asia, European systems being more likely to concentrate
in the traditionally compact cores of their cities. It is also likely to
reflect the tendency for Asian systems to cover separate, distinct
communities within one interoperating system in a large city, serv-
ing journeys within sub-systems each covering a local community
while using the same technology across the city for simplicity. As
such, the perimeter of the system is more complex. A side effect
of the fixed 1 km buffer also means that systems which have the
nearest neighbour measurement approaching the same distance
– notably Bordeaux – will result in a low compactness ratio as a
significant proportion of docking stations have a buffer that does
not overlap with those adjacent to it.

The second dimensionless measure is the Z-score, also known as
the standard score. It is beyond the scope of this paper to detail
this, but it can be simply interpreted as the ‘‘orderliness’’ of how
the docking stations appear across the system’s extent, with re-
spect to each other. It does not look at the calculated area, but in-
stead looks at the distribution of distances between all the points
(docking stations in this case) normalised by the distance between
each point and the central mean point of the system. It calculates
whether this distribution is random or exhibits signs of clustering
or dispersal.

Clustered systems predominately have groups of docking sta-
tions in one or more smaller areas within the larger system – per-
haps in middle business districts of a city, or distinct
neighbourhood populated by a demographic that the system
designers expect would use the bicycles extensively. They have a
large negative Z-score. Dispersed systems have been deliberately
designed to be spaced out within their urban areas – allowing a
near-even coverage and confidence to a user that, as long as they
remain in the system area, they are not normally more than a short
distance from the nearest docking station. Such systems have a
large positive Z-score. Systems exhibiting a near random distribu-
tion of docking stations have a Z-score of around zero. These sys-
tems will have concentrations of docking stations in key areas –
major transport hubs and city centres – while also having a sparse
distribution in outlying neighbourhoods and other areas of low
population density and therefore likely ridership.

The Z-score statistic is being used here merely to quantitatively
describe the type of layout of a system. Since docking station loca-
Fig. 5. Shape and density characteristi
tions are designated by urban planners to serve a particular resi-
dential area, high-density office complex, public transport hub or
tourist attraction, and are normally limited by planning require-
ments, population distributions, demographic considerations or
physical constraints of geography, each city is likely to have a nat-
ural Z-score statistic that would be unlikely to change without a
significant redeployment of docking stations. A substantial change
would be seen if a city decided to fill in the gaps in their system to
increase the evenness of coverage, or deploy additional docking
stations to remote neighbourhoods.

There are a wide variety of Z-scores across the 38 systems stud-
ied, as shown in Fig. 5, with European/Middle Eastern systems gen-
erally having a higher Z-score (average �0.6) than those in Asia
(�6.3) – suggesting a more regularly spaced set of docking stations
across the system. The Z-score correlates somewhat with the com-
pactness ratio – again this is most likely because of larger systems
serving several multiple, relatively disconnected communities in
larger Asian cities, compared with more uniform cross-city Euro-
pean systems. Nice’s unusually low Z-score (for Europe) is due to
the area’s steep topography and the system having a long drawn-
out strand of docking stations along the coast and up several adja-
cent valleys, in effect serving communities separate from the sys-
tem’s main core of docking stations in Nice itself.

In the system footprints shown in Fig. 6, Changwon’s complex
shape and wide variations in the distance between adjacent dock-
ing stations – a high degree of spatial clustering – means it has a
low compactness ratio (0.3) and very negative Z-score (�16). In
contrast, Valencia’s grid-like structure – highly dispersed – and
approximately circular shape results in a high compactness ratio
(0.8) and a positive Z-score (6.7). Barcelona has approximately
the same compactness ratio as Valencia’s, but a significantly lower
Z-score (�8) because it clusters more strongly along some major
roads, within the main system area. There is a weak correlation be-
tween the two measures, as shown in Fig. 5, as smaller systems in
particular are likely to be concentrated only in a city centre, which
is typically of uniformly high building density and free of geo-
graphical obstructions, allowing a circular and even structure –
simple to design for and straightforward to use – to be easily
constructed.

3.3. Temporal characteristics

To extract the temporal signatures of each bike-share, the total
number of bicycles available at each moment are summed and
cs: compactness ratio and Z-score.

Valencia (bottom right) shown at the same scale. Each circle represents a docking
station. The area of each circle is directly proportional to the number of docking
points it contains.

divided by the total number of docking points available, to obtain
the load factor. A value of 0 at a particular point in time means
there are no bicycles available to hire, while a value of 100% means
that every docking point in each docking station is full of bicycles.
In practice, as discussed earlier, most systems operate under an
approximate load factor of just under 50% (i.e. just over two dock-
ing points for each bicycle). The measured value drops below this
during periods of heavy use, returning to the ‘‘steady state’’ value
overnight. Load factor will rarely fall below 30%, as this would
probably result in large parts of a system’s area being without bicy-
cles available for hire, restricting additional use.

Redistribution and maintenance activities carried out by system
operators can result in spurious activity being seen, particularly
overnight. It is difficult to remove such activity from the analysis.
We do not, however, consider this as significant when viewing
the macroscopic characteristics of each system, particularly when
the data are aggregated over longer periods of time. In com-
muter-driven systems, such as London and Barcelona, the very un-
equal distribution of bicycles across the system following each
commuting time-period is observed to by-and-large remain until
the next commute time. On transitioning into weekend use, the
less ordered movement of weekend users often acts as a remark-

ably effective redistribution from a Friday-evening post-commuter
distribution in itself.

Many bike-shares are based in city centres and show character-
istic usage peaks (corresponding to temporary troughs in the load
factor) during morning and evening commutes, and a single peak
during weekend afternoons, such as is seen in London in Fig. 7.

A peak in hiring activity leads to a drop in the measured load
factor across the bicycle sharing system, so such bursts of activity
appear as troughs in the graphs shown in Fig. 8.

Fig. 8 highlights obvious differences between systems, but it is
also notable that many systems show common traits, despite sub-
stantial differences in geographical footprint, system size and den-
sity. In particular, a double-trough weekday usage and a wide
single-trough weekend usage is a characteristic shared in a sub-
stantial number of the systems we have studied here. Ultimately,
the ubiquitous ‘‘9–5’’ working day, five days a week, plays out
across most of the systems studied. The high capital costs associ-
ated with setting up a bicycle sharing system also ensures that
most system designers will likely wish to emulate existing success-
ful systems in terms of the user demographics and habits.

3.4. System classification based on temporal characteristics

Based on observations of the 30 systems shown in Fig. 8, and of
the other 8 systems studied, we have developed a classification,
shown in Table 2, that summarises the temporal characteristics.
It incorporates the number of the peaks per day for weekdays
and weekends, the relative difference between weekend and week-
day usage, and average load factor. We have also stated the likely
demographic characteristics of the cyclists themselves. The pro-
posed demographic types are:

� Commuters: Use bicycles to travel between home/transport hub
and office.
� Utility Users: Use bicycles throughout the weekday for shop-

ping, errands.
� Leisure Users: Generally cycle at weekends for fun and exercise.
� Tourist Users: Use bicycles to get to beach or explore city.

3.5. Description of systems based on their comparative characteristics

On observing the relative positions of the individual systems on
the graphs showing the non-spatial and spatial attributes, and
plotting time-series data on systems as we have done in Fig. 8,
the commonalities and differences between the respective systems
become apparent.

cities in this study. The other eight systems’ data are not shown to assuage concerns the operator may have regarding display of such data at a fine temporal resolution. For
two systems here (Melbourne and Rio de Janeiro) this was across winter. Some data cleaning was employed to remove fluctuations caused by unplanned outages and data
collection errors. Denver’s system is closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Taipei City’s data is from September 2012 only and shows some noise due to the smaller number of days it
is averaged across. The time of day is local to each system.

270 O. O’Brien et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 34 (2014) 262–273
London, Washington DC, Toronto, Boston and Montreal all see a
similar pattern, with two weekday commuter peaks and a broad
afternoon peak at weekends. Washington DC’s weekend peak is
larger relative to its weekday use, than for the other cities, likely
reflecting the USA’s traditional leisure and touristic orientated fo-
cus for cycling. The spatial distribution of bicycles after an evening
commute period in London is shown in Fig. 9.

Changshu’s system sees peaks earlier in the day than the other
systems in China, reflecting that China’s single time zone across a
wide longitude means that local timings within the country vary
significantly. Heihe’s system is a small Chinese system. The lunch-
time patterns suggest the bike-share users use the system to go
home for lunch, and then use it again to return to work. Many of
China’s systems also show a weekend usage that is very similar
in shape to weekday usage, often including the same commuter
peaks.

Bordeaux, Toronto and Vienna see only a small but consistent
weekday use, with minor but noticeable commuter peaks. How-
ever their weekend afternoon use is significantly higher. Barcelona
and Saragossa show quite different patterns to the other cities.
Reflecting on the different Spanish/Catalan working life style, there
are three commuter peaks, the evening one being much later than
for other countries. Weekend usage also sees a lull, as users avoid
the afternoon sun.
Barcelona’s first commuter usage peak has a ‘‘double dip’’ –
occurring just before 8 a.m. and just before 9 a.m. A similar pattern
exists in Valencia and Saragossa, the other Spanish systems stud-
ied. In many Spanish urban areas, public sector workers start work
at 8 a.m. and private sector workers start at 9 a.m.

Milan shows a curious increase in load factor after the morning
commuter rush, compared with the overnight values. This suggests
that bicycles are added to the system by the operator, during the
working day, and then removed again before the rush hour.

Melbourne, Minneapolis and Rennes see only a small usage –
the first two having slightly greater weekend use and the latter
slightly greater use during weekdays. Melbourne’s result may be
lower as, being the only southern-hemisphere system studied, it
was wintertime during the period of study. Of note, Melbourne’s
load factor ‘‘at rest’’ (i.e. outside of normal usage hours) is much
higher than for all of the other systems. The low usage allows it
to have many bicycles in each docking station, presumably for vis-
ibility and publicity purposes, without system users suffering from
finding their destination station full. The aggregate characteristic
measure also shows this.

3.6. Bike-share system hierarchy

characteristics of each system through an inductive classification

procedure. A range of attributes, listed in Fig. 10, were assigned to
the 38 schemes and input into a hierarchical clustering procedure
developed by Ward (1963). Ward’s hierarchical clustering treats
each system as unique before merging it with the most similar sys-
tem (based on the input attributes) and then merging the resulting
pairing with the most similar pairing and so on. This process en-
ables a tree structure (dendrogram) to emerge with adjoining
branches forming between similar groups. The resulting dendro-
gram is shown in Fig. 10. It offers a powerful summary of the afore-
mentioned analysis and confirmation of the similarities/
differences between different scheme characteristics. For example,
Chinese systems group together, along with Lille (notable for its
dispersed docking station geography). Spanish systems also group
together, along with Lyon. There are some surprising partners –
Montreal and Changwon, and Miami Beach and Daejeon. The cities
may feel very different on the ground, but a significant number of
the measures applied to the clustering – such as system size, com-
pactness and weekday/weekend popularity comparison – may be
similar, resulting in such a grouping together.

4. Applications

4.1. Demographic and community detection of the data

It is clear from the docking station data that a number of dis-
tinctive patterns are present, and can be used to form hypotheses
both about the characteristics of the system users in each city,
and the city itself. The interval between usage peaks during week-
days can reveal the typical working hours of a city, for example,
while the position and size of the weekend usage peak provides
an insight into the weekend habits of the city’s dwellers. These in-
sights however have a limitation in that the demographic con-
cerned is that of bicycle-sharing system users, not of the city at
large. There is some evidence that such users are more likely to
be male and live in less-deprived areas than the general population
(Ogilvie and Goodman, 2012) so such measures need to be con-
trolled for when describing a city’s behaviour as a whole. A poten-
tial practical observation that can be made is that measured
fluctuations in average apparent speed might indicate episodes of
road congestion or increased system users that take meandering
paths.

The research can easily be extended to further understand the
demographics of the system users – for example, studying ‘‘so-
cial’’ hires, where two or more bicycles are hired from a particular
place at a close point in time, and then re-docked elsewhere at
similar times later, and places where leisure cycling is most desir-
able, either by studying variations of journey speeds (derivable
from calculating likely routes for journey-level data) in particular
areas of the city, or proportions of hires that finish at the same
docking station they started from. Other research has shown that
clustering of docking stations can reveal communities of users,
the classification showing significant spatial similarity despite

full, while white ones with black borders are completely empty. Large areas in the centre are completely devoid of bicycles, surrounded by a ‘‘doughnut’’ of largely full
docking stations. The background mapping contains OpenStreetMap mapping data.

stations; average docking station size; maximum simultaneous usage during

neighbour distance; Z-Score; compactness ratio; number of usage peaks each

location normally not being an input into the clustering process,
suggesting different user types and intentions at different times
in different districts.

4.2. The redistribution problem

The operator has a particular interest in learning the daily and
weekly cycles of system activity, and the effect of external events
such as weather and transport strikes on movements, because
effective redistribution (the act of moving bicycles from where
they are located to where they are needed) is important for many
of the systems – particularly if they are dominated by asymmetric
flows at certain times of the day (e.g. commuters) but with other
user types requiring them at other times (e.g. tourists) or they
are simply too small or too popular for their city to be able to sat-
isfy demand.

Operators can use the datasets to build up a profile of users and
journeys, and monitor trend changes in the numbers of a particular
user type, that may need to be addressed by changes in the redis-
tribution strategy or frequency. While one metric used is the time a
docking station remains full or empty, it may actually be desirable
to retain or even affect such a state, if it is likely that a rapid change
in the numbers of bicycles (caused by the users themselves rather
than operator redistribution activity) can be expected shortly.

In addition, the classifications offered above provide a useful
basis for operators to anticipate usage patterns for planned sys-
tems and learn from systems similar to their own. It is our belief
that this would enable more effective budgeting for future systems
if they can better anticipate the likely redistribution efforts re-
quired and inform changes to existing systems, such as extensions
and pricing strategies. Such insights stand to increase the success
of both existing and future systems and therefore offer a pragmatic
contribution to sustainable urban transport systems.
5. Conclusion

This paper has sought to demonstrate the insights offered by
the straightforward collection of bicycle sharing system data. This
work stands to benefit operators, researchers of urban behaviours
and patterns, and users themselves. The usage of such systems is
quite well ordered, with a relatively high degree of predictability.

It is readily apparent that a number of insightful observations
can be made from a simple analysis of the docking station data
from bicycle sharing systems, including many that are not dis-
cussed in this paper, and that such observations can be used to
form comparisons between urban areas, and between their corre-
sponding systems. It is clear also that there are numerous further
opportunities for research with such datasets.



O. O’Brien et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 34 (2014) 262–273 273
Bicycle sharing systems play an important part in increasing
sustainable transport options in cities. An understanding of their
potential use, and impact, across many diverse types of cities and
multiple user types, is becoming increasingly important.

With the creation of new systems and increased public avail-
ability of individual level origin–destination data for some systems
(such as London, Washington DC, Minneapolis and Boston), the
opportunities and applications of studying spatial, temporal and
journey data associated with bike-sharing will continue to expand.
