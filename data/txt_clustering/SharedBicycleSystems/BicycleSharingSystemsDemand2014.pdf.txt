Abstract 

One of the problems in bicycle sharing systems design is the estimation of the potential demand to the service, especially 
in countries where this type of systems is not yet implemented. The main objective of this methodology is to relate the 
demand of bike-sharing systems with external characteristics that affects the bicycle usage in order to obtain its territorial 
distribution. Due to the limited information available in Portugal this paper will focus on the determination of demand based 
on the experience of other countries. The method is applied to a middle size Portuguese city, Coimbra.

1. Introduction 

The growing need for changes in mobility patterns turns public transportation, bicycle and pedestrian mode 
the solution to reduce the externalities related with mobility, in particular the consequences of the mass use of 
fossil fuels, the growing price of the fossil fuels and the excessive occupation of public space by private cars. 
This can be found in publications such as  (Vuchic, 1999) (European Commission, 2009). 

Apart from its minimal ecological impact and the reduction of energy dependence, bicycle transportation 
mode has certain benefits for cyclists, such as improving health and saving money, it provides a significant 
improvement in the quality of city life and a better experience in the use of urban spaces (European Commission, 
1999).  
 

According to European Commission (1999), there is a range in terms of travel time where bicycles are more 
competitive than any other mode of transport in urban areas (between 2 and 8 minutes). In fact, for trips longer

than 1.5 km the difference in travel time between bicycle and car is less than 2 minutes, so the bicycle can lose 
some potential here. 

Within the factores that are pointed as reasons to restrict and discourage bicycle use it is often referred the lack 
of bikeways and other adapted spaces, and consequently, the feeling of insecurity and bad intersections 
conditions, the distance and the the geographic and weather conditions (European Commission, 1999) (An & 
Chen, 2006) (Dill & Voros, 2007) (Duthie, Brady, Mills, & Machemehl, 2010) (Heinen, Van Wee, & Maat, 
2010). 

Weather conditions are a permanent constraint but only under extreme conditions (pouring rain or blistering 
heat) really discourage cycling. Nevertheless, it is in Northern European countries such as Sweden, where bad 
weather is very common, that the bicycle has its most devoted users. In fact, 33% of all journeys in Västerås, 
Sweden (a cold country), are made by bicycle. In Cambridge, United Kingdom, a wet country, cycling accounts 
for 27% of journeys. 

Steep slopes can make the ascents difficult for cyclists and the descents can lead to fast speeds which might be 
unsafe for cyclists or other users. These situations can be avoided if certain design recommendations are 
followed, which establish a maximum length according to the slope (AASHTO Executive Committee, 1999). 
Other solutions help with steep slopes, such as equipping buses with cycle racks, or installing bicycle lifts where 
the user places a foot in a treadle that pushes them up. 

Several cities around the world adopted public bicycle sharing systems as a modal choice; the service allows to 
pick up and to drop off a bicycle in different stations throughout an urban area. The service allows picking up a 
bicycle and drop-off in different points (stations) of the city allowing the coordination with other transport modes. 

Besides the environmental positive impacts, improvement of city life quality and a better experience in the use 
of urban spaces, it is expected some alterations in the mobility patterns caused by the implementation of bike-
sharing systems. These services capture users from other transport services such as bus transit, walking, autos, 
and taxis. Furthermore, some authors suggest that bike-sharing acts as competitor and complement of the existing 
modal options because it can be used as alternative to car and the trips can be complemented with other modes 
(Shaheen, Zhang, Martin, & Guzman, 2011). 

This work to be performed it should provide a methodology to determine the potential demand of bike-sharing 
services. The bike-sharing systems can be used in two different ways: as an isolated service, or as an intermodal 
service, complemented with other transport. Besides the demand definition, the methodology should identify the 
factors that influence the demand and how do they influence it. 

This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the demand of a new bike-sharing system in a city, at the level 
of defining zones with higher potential demand in urban area. The paper is organized into five sections: in section 
2 is presented a literature review in bicycle sharing systems mainly in demand studies scope, in section 3 is 
presented the bike sharing demand methodology, in section 4 the future study case, in Coimbra, is presented and 
finally the summary and main conclusions are presented in section 5. 

2. Literature review 

2.1. Bike sharing systems 

It is important to distinguish between three generations of services. According with several authors there are 
three generations of services of bike-sharing: free bike system, coin-deposit systems and information technology-
based systems (Shaheen, Guzman, & Zhang, 2010), (Wang, Liu, Zhang, & Duan, 2008) and (DeMaio, 2009). 

The free bike-sharing system is characterized by a set of bicycles (with unusual colors and/or shapes) that are 
available without costs to the user. Typically the stations are located near public facilities that have their own 
staff which are responsible for the users’ identification, reducing the needs of human resources of the system. 
The use of the bicycle is, in the most cases, free to the user. The first bike sharing system was emerged in 



520   Inês Frade and Anabela Ribeiro  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   111  ( 2014 )  518 – 527 

Amsterdam, the Netherlands in 1965. A set of fifty free bicycles was seen as the solution for traffic problems. 
However the Witte Fietsen (white bikes) Plan failed after its launch due to the bicycle damages and thefts. 

In the coin-deposit systems the bicycles are not freely available, once the users have to use a coin to unlock 
the bicycle from the docking stations. At the same time, some concerns about the location of the stations are 
introduced to ensure the efficiency of the operation.  

Although some significant changes on the motorized transportation patterns in some cities the coin-deposit 
system did not solved the thefts problem. To overcome this problem, the third generation of bike-sharing 
emerged based on automatic services. 

This generation uses smart technology (mobile phones, mag-stripe cards, smartcards or codes) to unlock the 
bicycles from the stations allowing the automatic identification of the users (with a code for instance). The casual 
users pay a security deposit to ensure the return of the bicycle, and the use of the bicycles is paid depending on 
the time interval of the usage. Typically the service is free in the first specified time interval and the price 
gradually increases after the interval depletion. This system is simpler to manage in terms of human resources, 
but requires a higher investment in technology. Some of the great advantages of the technology introduction are 
the possibility of 24h service, the easier location of stations in the city and the data collection about the usage of 
the service. 

Shaheen, Guzman, & Zhang (2010) identified also the fourth generation of bike-sharing systems. Fourth 
generation bike-sharing systems are multimodal systems. Their main concern is an improvement of the service to 
the user needs, in other words it is demand-responsive. It includes an improvement in technological mechanisms 
in the stations and bicycles that facilitate their use and share, electric bicycles, bicycle relocations and the 
integration of the several transport services in the same access card (public transportation or car-sharing). 

In Portugal it was implemented a free bicycle sharing system in Aveiro, called Bugas, that was launched on 
April 2000. It stated with a stock of 350 bicycles spread over 33 parks all over the city. However, after the pilot 
period some of the bicycles were vandalized or stolen. Currently the system works as a less ambitious service 
with only one station and some degraded bicycles. 

The successful of the bike-sharing programs depends on how the demand is satisfied. However, the definition 
of bike-sharing demand is not yet a popular subject in the literature. Next section provides a literature review  
about general bicycle demand models and a focus on existing bike-sharing demand definition strategies.  

2.2. Demand studies for cycling and bike-sharing 

One of the biggest concerns of the urban transportation planners is to provide the most adequate response to 
traveller’s needs, estimating transportation demand and its variation. Planners are also aware of the strong 
relation between transportation and land use, and as this relation should be incorporated in demand studies. 

 It is complex and risky to predict the number of bicycle trips, especially in cities where the bicycle is not yet 
widely used.  

There are various studies on the prediction of non-motorized travel demand. Turner, Hottenstein, & Shunk 
(1997) and (Schwartz et al., 1999) present an overview of different approaches to determine the bicycle travel 
demand. 

One of the methods more frequently referred is the Latent Demand Score Method (Landis, 1996) and it is 
specially adapted in cases where bicycles are not yet a popular choice. The methodology provides a coefficient of 
potential demand for bicycle trips throughout a transportation network (in each arc of the network), based on the 
influence of generator/attractors points in the city on the number of bicycle trips for all road segments. One of the 
advantages of this model is that it acts as a geographic information system. However the trips estimated are not 
directional (the method considers the total number of the trips that were generated and attracted), meaning that 
the method compromises an Origin-Destiny evaluation.  

An adaptation of this method was used in a demand study for the city of Tomar (Portugal) where the main 
difference of this adaptation to the Latent Demand Score Method is that it considers the number of trips in each 



521 Inês Frade and Anabela Ribeiro  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   111  ( 2014 )  518 – 527 

origin-destination point, and the choice of shortest path between origin and destination (Ribeiro, Frade, & 
Correia, 2012). 

The current scientific studies or real world applications use ‘revealed’ or ‘stated’ preference surveys as 
methods for bike sharing systems demand estimation (dell’Olio, Ibeas, & Moura, 2011) (ConBici, 2007) 
(PROBICI team, 2010). In the cases of bike-sharing systems expansion, the revealed surveys can be very useful; 
however in some cases the responses to the stated preference surveys can be strategic and may not reflect the real 
intentions of the interviewee. Surveys results must be used with care, mainly in the cases where similar services 
were not yet implemented.  

In order to avoid the constrains caused by the surveys, the demand modelling approach will study different 
bike-sharing systems around the world defining the profile of the users and potential users, the factors that can 
influence the demand (as the geographical conditions, the variation of demand during the day or over the seasons, 
and the travellers characteristics age; sex, and/or job, etc.) and how they affect it. 

The demand of New York City bike-sharing system was designed using the user group patterns of successful 
bike-share programs: Velib’in Paris, Velo’v in Lyon and Bicing in Barcelona; from which three typical user 
groups were identified: commuters, recreational/errand riders and tourists. The authors estimated the number of 
people in each potential user category in New York and applied to them different uptake rates (3%, 6% and 9%) 
to quantify the users of bike-share program. The uptake rates are defined based on London and Paris surveys 
(NYCDCP, 2009). 

Krykewycz, Puchalsky, Rocks, Bonnette, and Jaskiewicz (2010) use a methodology to estimate the demand 
for a new bicycle-sharing program in Philadelphia (Pennsylvania). The authors’ defined two market areas using 
raster based geographic information system analysis and applied three bike share trip diversion rates determined 
through surveys in Lyon, Paris (France) and Barcelona (Spain) in order estimate the modal shift from other 
modes to bike-sharing, establishing different demand scenarios (low, middle and high).  

In the Seattle case, the demand study was based in the Philadelphia study. However, the market areas were 
defined considering a GIS raster dataset of weighted sum indicators that influence bike-share use (population 
density, non-institutionalized group quarter population density, job density, retail job density, commute trip 
reduction companies, tourist attractions, parks/recreation areas, topography, regional transit stations, bicycle 
friendly streets, streets with bicycle lanes and local transit stops). Rates observed in Lyon, Paris and Barcelona, to 
the defined market areas, were also applied (Gregerson, Hepp-buchanan, Rowe, Sluis, Vander, Wygonik, et al., 
2010).  

Daddio (2012) presents a regression approach to relate the surrounding characteristics with the station 
demand. The dependent variable is the number of trip departures per station, using the data provided by Capital 
Bikeshare (bike-sharing system of Washington Metropolitan Area). The independent variables are measure 
within 400 meter walk distance from each station. The variables considered are divided in three sets of 
characteristics: trip generation, trip attraction and transportation network. 

In the District of Columbia, the variables statically significant are the population between the ages of 20 and 
39, the proportion of population that belongs to a race other than “white alone”, the number of retail 
establishments selling alcohol, the number of metro stations and the distance from weighted mean (ridership) 
from the center of full DC and CA Capital Bikeshare system. 

The use of public bicycles increases potentially when they are complemented with other transportation modes 
(intermodality), or when parking problems exists in the origin or destination of the trip.  

In The Netherlands for instance a growth in bicycle use for non-recurrent trips, besides a reduction in car use 
and a growth in train trips, was observed after the introduction of a public bicycle sharing service, (Martens, 
2007). 

Krizek & Stonebraker (2010) presented a methodology - developed for Puget Sound Regional Council in 
Washington in 2002 - that determines the total number of potential users of a bicycle station (in different 
scenarios) depending of the respective user groups, defined as: bicycle commuters who work within a quarter 
mile of the bicycle station; bicycle users who park their bicycles at transit stations and bicycle users who travel 
with their bicycles. The methodology relates the number of the users with the employment data, the number of 



522   Inês Frade and Anabela Ribeiro  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   111  ( 2014 )  518 – 527 

transit trips, the bicycle share within 3 miles of a proposed bicycle station, and the number of bicycle commuters 
to within a quarter mile of the bicycle station. The validation of this method was done considering the data of two 
existing bicycle stations and the methodology was considered reasonably accurate.  

3. Bike sharing demand definition – a methodology proposal 

3.1. Introduction 

For the planning of bike sharing systems in a city it is fundamental to define its demand previously. As stated 
in previous sections, the definition of demand can be done in different ways. One used approach from the 
previous studies is the use of preference surveys, in some cases the results of preference surveys may be 
unreliable because the stated behaviour of the respondents may be strategic and not represent their real individual 
behaviour. The direct comparison with successful implemented bike-sharing systems, as in Barcelona, Paris and 
Lyon does not relate the demand of bike-sharing systems with other external characteristics that affects the 
bicycle usage, as the physical characteristics of the city. Then, this methodology proposes a different approach. 
The main steps of the methodology are referred bellow. 

3.2. Methodology 

The methodology focuses in the relation between the target public of bike-sharing, trip characteristics and the 
physical characteristics of the city paths. As previously referred, the bicycle usage is mainly affected by the 
distance of the trip, the slope inclination, the purpose of the trip and lack of bicycle paths. However it is 
admissible that, in an urban environment, all streets are adaptable for bicycle use, from minor to major 
improvements.  Therefore, the main advantage of this methodology is not only the demand quantification (which 
usually is made by applying a bicycle sharing users proportion to all the city trips – to all O-D pairs – only 
considering different purposes) but also modelling it according the studied area. 

The demand definition is studied considering two parts:  
a) quantifying demand based on other case studies – obtaining the proportion of bike sharing users per trip 

purpose and  
b) defining, sequentially, the effect on demand caused by the trip characteristics (travel time between traffic 

zones) and physical city characteristics (slopes). 
As final result it will be obtained an OD matrix with bike sharing proportions to the studied area. The main 

aspects in this methodology are presented in the next subsections and it will be applied to the case study 
described in section 4.  

3.2.1. Purpose 

The trip purpose influences the probability of using the bicycle (Marleau, Larsen, & Geneidy, 2011). For 
instance, the probability of using a bicycle for leisure trips is greater than for shopping purposes, because it can 
be difficult carrying shopping bags on a bicycle (Mcneil, 2011)(PROBICI team, 2010). 

The bike sharing demand is also affected by the trip purpose, as referred, and there are three typical user 
groups: commuters, recreational/errand riders and tourists. Thus to each one it must be considered different initial 
rates of bicycle trips (Rn) per purpose (n) based on other study cases.  

3.2.2. Distance 

For short distances (between 2 and 8 minutes) in urban areas, bicycle can be the most efficient transportation 
mode. However, while travel distance increases the competitiveness will be negatively affected, and 



523 Inês Frade and Anabela Ribeiro  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   111  ( 2014 )  518 – 527 

consequently the potential demand of this mode will decrease: In other words, the potential demand is affected by 
an elasticity which causes a fall in the percentage of bicycle trips when the distance travelled increases. 

The elasticity is the ratio between the variation in the proportion of bicycle trips and the rate variation in travel 
time, between a reference situation and the desired point.  

The elasticity varies with trip purpose, too. The travel time has a different effect according to the travel 
purpose. For example, two extra minutes on a work journey travel time can significantly reduce the proportion of 
bicycle users, whereas in recreational travel it may be irrelevant (Heinen, Van Wee, & Maat 2010).  

Thus, the percentage of bicycle trips for purpose as a function of travel time, Rtn, is calculated by equation (1): 
very short trips are made on foot thus there is no demand of public bicycles, while there is a range in terms of 
travel time where the demand of bicycle is maximum however there is an instant time from which it decrease 
being affected by the elasticity.

Where t0n and t1n are the reference instants from each the proportion of bicycle trips starts increasing or 

decreasing, respectively, and they can vary by trip purpose, ti is the time travel from each origin to each 
destination points, Rn is the initial rate of  bike-sharing and En is the elasticity. 

The initial values of E by purpose must be appropriate to each case study. They are strongly dependent on 
local conditions and personal attitudes to the use of bicycles. These attitudes should be estimated with field 
surveys or by benchmarking with other examples from around the world. One example is the elasticity values 
presented to Santander case in PROBICI team (2010). 

3.2.3. Slopes  

The bicycle sharing systems are specially adapted in case of cities with steep slopes because the cyclists can 
use bicycle in one direction and use other transport modes (such as buses) for the oposite direction. In these cases 
the main problem of the bikes-haring systems sponsors is the relocation of bicycles that must be carefully design.   

The slopes contribute to the ability of a travel route for cycling, according to (AASHTO Executive 
Committee, 1999), since grades greater than 5% are uncomfortable for many cyclists (because the ascents are 
difficult to climb and the descents induce excessive speeds), but they may be used in short sections. As a  general 
guide the authors suggested the reference values of maximum road length for grades greater than 5% presented in 
Table 1.  

The percentage of bicycle trip per purpose is affected by the differences of slopes between origin and 
destination mainly in cases of ascents.  

In order to incorporate the slopes effect in this methodology, each traffic zone is characterized by its roads 
grades, it means that if the zone has lot of ascendant streets that not to obey to the characteristics in Table 1, the 
demand of bicycle trips tends to decrease in trips with an undesirable destination.

4. Case Study 

4.1. General description 

Coimbra is a town located in the center of Portugal and it had more than 140,000 inhabitants in 2011. It is 
characterized for having a large student population – the University of Coimbra has approximately 30,000 
students, being the oldest in Portugal and one of the oldest in Europe. 

Coimbra does not meet a set of good infrastructural conditions to make bicycle as an optional transport mode. 
The lack of bicycle paths, bicycle supporting facilities and streets in steep slopes suggests that Coimbra is not 
suitable for cyclists. However, there are a lot of paths, with soft slopes, that can easily be adapted for the cycle 
needs of a growing cycling population.  

The latest strategic plans of the city have some points with implications for cycling (Parque Expo, 2012) 
(Regulamento n.o 255/2012).  

In 2008, it was made a study to determine the mobility patterns of its population based on surveys. According 
this study 42% of the households had one car and about 45% had two or more cars per household, emphasizing 
the high motorization rate in the city - 522 cars per 1000 inhabitants against 473 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 
2009 in Europe (info from Eurostat). Most daily trips are made by car (69%), and bicycle has a very low 
importance but the study points bicycle as a forthcoming option. About 57% of the trips have less than 4 km. 

The mobility study divided the municipality of Coimbra in 61 traffic zones, 29 of which correspond to the city 
area of Coimbra. The next section presents the mobility characteristics of the city as well as the data bases that 
will be used in this application. 

4.2. Application  

The defined methodology is applied to this case study considering the origin destination matrix for the traffic 
zones of the city of Coimbra, as well as the distances between each traffic zone and its physical characteristics, in 
a Geographical Information System built for this purpose. 

As referred, the typical users of the bike-sharing systems are commuters, recreational/errand riders and 
tourists. In the Coimbra case study the follow rates of bicycle sharing trips per purpose were considered: (Rn) 
equals to 3%, 9%, and 6% for commuters, recreational riders and tourists, respectively. These values were taken 
from a reference study for New York City study case (NYCDCP, 2009). 



525 Inês Frade and Anabela Ribeiro  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   111  ( 2014 )  518 – 527 

The influence of distance between origin and destination is calculated by equation 1, and considering the 
values of table 2. The values were based in the Santander (Spain) case.

commuters 1 8 3.0% -0.08 

recreational  1 10 9.0% -0.01 

tourism 1 10 6.0% -0.01 

In order to understand the slope effect of the Coimbra´s irregular orography, the routes in the road network 
were classified as suitable and unsuitable for cycling according the relation between grade and extension of the 
roads presented in Table 1. The length proportion of suitable roads in each traffic areas is presented in Fig. 1.  

 

Fig.  1. Traffic zones of the study area classified l by the length proportion of suitable routes. 

As show in Fig. 1the orography of the city is very irregular and, consequently, there are zones where is more 
comfortable to bike (green zones - where near to 100% of road extension respect the relation in table 1) in terms 
of slopes, on the other hand there are also zones where the major part of the routes are uncomfortable for cyclists 
(red zones - where only 40 to 50% meet table 1).  

The factor fs of the equation (2) was determinated determined empirically, it should be adjusted through 
surveys. And it is presented in Table 3.

area and the Fig. 2 (b) presents the results of this methodology application: all the trips simultaneouslly generated

Fig.  2. (a) Total number of trips in traffic zones of study area by all modes; (b) The estimated number of trips in traffic zones of study 
area using bike-sharing. 

From the Fig. 2(a) it is possible to identify two traffic zones with a high number of generated and attracted 
trips (Alta e Solum), where the Alta area includes the Coimbra University and has about 30000 daily trips.  

After the application of the proposed methodology, it is possible to observe some changes in trip patterns: the 
east traffic zones lose some importance and the ‘downtown’ and ‘Vale das Flores’ area gained relevance, Fig. 
2(b). 

The traffic zones of the mobility study are too large for this type of analysis. Some sensitivity analysis should 
be developed in further studies in order to see the influence of shortening the traffic areas dimensions on the 
‘bike-sharing’ systems use proportion.  

5. Conclusions 

This paper sets out a method for estimating the bike-sharing demand and it allows to geo-reference the 
demand, considering the characteristics of the city and of the trips. This approach was illustrated by an 
application to the Portuguese town of Coimbra. 

The main advantages of this approach are that it provides a quick assessment and it can be adapted to other 
towns and cities according its characteristics. The method can help in decision-making for transportation 
planners, policymakers and investors. The method is useful in the full design of the system, including the location 
of bike-sharing stations and in the dimension of the fleet, as well as in the scheduling of the investments.  

Further studies can include the consideration of other socio-economic characteristics, such as population 
density, non-institutionalized group quarter population density, job density, retail job density, commute trip 
reduction companies, tourist attractions, parks/recreation areas, topography, regional transit stations, bicycle 
friendly streets, streets with bicycle lanes and local transit stops, as in the Gregerson, Hepp-buchanan, Rowe, 
Sluis, Vander, Wygonik, et al. (2010) mention before. It should be also considered the demand associated to 
public transport, to understand which public transport mode bike-sharing users chose to complete their trip.  

Therefore, several information is also being collected in socio-economic variables for each district and each 
traffic zone that are part of the case study, in order to have a detailed demand determination framework, which is 
an important part of the formulation in the simulation-optimization  model this study aims to reach for.
