Abstract: Bicycle sharing system has become more and more popular as it can help partly
solve the problems such as CO2 over-emission and traffic congestion. Some systems have been
operated for several years and the analysis work is very necessary for controlling and redesigning
the system in purpose of getting better performances. In this paper we analyze the bike-sharing
stations by clustering algorithms in order to mine the inner-station patterns, and these clustering
results are essential for the system control and redesign. In this study, we take Vélib’ bike sharing
system in Paris as the study case.

rate; station behavior pattern

1. INTRODUCTION

With highlighted concerns about the global warming and
urban traffic congestion, decision makers and policy ex-
perts look for sustainable transportation alternatives such
as bike sharing. The shared bicycle fleets have been put
into reality to encourage more citizens to use public trans-
portations instead of private cars. Usually combined with
bus and subway systems, the bike sharing service has
become an approach to facilitate the short-distance trips
within the city. The trip refers to the distance between
home and the subway station or between a bus stop and
the workplace, which maybe too far to walk. Thus, the
bike sharing service is necessary to fill the unpleasant gap
in the transportation system.

As one of the most successful large-scale bike sharing
systems in the world, Vélib’, was launched by JCDecaux
in 15 July 2007 which encompassed around 18000 bicycles
and 1230 docking stations covering Paris and its close
suburbs. By July 2014, there have been more than 200
million trips and more than 274000 annual subscriptions
in Vélib’. It offers non-stop service (24/7) and each station
is equipped with an automatic rental terminal. An open
data system about the stations’ status is available on-line.

The Vélib’ network will be extended in the coming years
to cover new areas and will probably integrate electrical
bicycles. The extension of this network raises some issues
which could cause the change in several aspects: manage-
ment of the current network, the definition of extended ar-
chitecture (dimensioning and locations) and the enabling
services such as maintenance, electrical batteries supply,
etc. To solve these problems, we need to understand the
existed network regarding to the static locations and dy-
namic behaviors.

Our first goal is to analyze the behaviors of bike sharing
stations by following various performance indicators (e.g.

availability rate). The user’s satisfactory level can be seen
as a global indicator related to the system performance,
but it can not reflect the dynamics among the stations; the
availability rate can show the status of available bicycles
in the stations, and different stations behave differently
because of their geographical locations. For instance, those
stations which locate at the central business area must not
have the same usage patterns compared with those which
situate in the tourist places.

An extensive analysis of the system allows us therefore
to determine their dynamic behaviors, which means a
necessary understanding on station dynamics is required
for further research works in terms of system control or
redesign. In this process, it is too complicated to analyze
the stations one by one; and it is also too general if we
consider the station set as a whole object. Therefore, we
need to separate the stations into several groups and make
sure that inner-group stations are as similar as possible.
As we did not have any knowledge on the stations, we
choose clustering methods to help us decide the station
divisions. In the literature there are numerous works which
analyze bike sharing systems by clustering techniques.
However, they do not give a common understanding about
the number of classes that should be considered and they
do not treat this problem focusing on rush hours of the
day.

In this paper, we will present clustering analyses of Vélib’
system by using hierarchical and partitioning approaches.
This paper has been organized as follows. Section 2 dis-
cusses the related research work and gives the motivation
of our research. Sections 3 and 4 describe the analysis
works by descriptive method and unsupervised learning.
We present and discuss the experimental results in Section
5. At last, we close the paper by some conclusions and the
definition of future works.

2. RELATED WORKS

Almost all bike sharing systems open their station-usage
database to public. This offers great convenience to re-
searchers. In this research field, since several years ago,
the works which were related to the system analysis, con-
trol and design or redesign flourished. Next we will only
introduce those works regarding the system analysis.

2.1 System Analysis

Focusing on the system analysis, two major school of
thoughts can be distinguished.

By Machine Learning Algorithms. Most of the re-
searchers focus on the system analysis using algorithms
and data structures in machine learning. Chabchoub and
Fricker (2014) applied k-means in one-day trip dataset
from Vélib’ system by abstracting each station as a data
vector and got six clusters (railway station, mixture,
employment, periphery, habitation and entertainment).
Sarkar et al. (2015) analyzed 996 stations included in 4.5-
months data from ten cities by applying agglomerative
(bottom-up) hierarchical clustering method considering
station occupancy and activity level. They found four and
six clusters regarding these two indicators. Vogel et al.
(2014) have built the user profile and developed an analysis
by k-means over an one-year database of Lyon’s Vélo’v
system and found nine clusters. Borgnat et al. (2011)
discovered the temporal bike rental regularity and spatial
traffic pattern for Vélo’v system by descriptive statistical
methods jointly with k-means. Wong and Cheng (2015)
found three clusters on weekdays and four clusters on
weekends by analyzing station availability in Taipei’s bike-
sharing System. Xu et al. (2013) combined k-means and
simulated annealing algorithm then applied it to the sta-
tion segmentation in bike sharing system in Hangzhou.
Vogel et al. (2011) implemented the clustering on about
760 thousand trip data of Vienna’s Citybike Wien by k-
means, expectation maximization algorithm and sequen-
tial information-bottleneck method. Their study yielded
five clusters by locating the elbow point in cluster valida-
tion chart.

By Probabilistic Methods. Based on Poisson mixture
models and the origin-destination flow of Vélib’, the one-
month data led to nine clusters (Randriamanamihaga
et al., 2013) while two-month data yielded eight clusters
(Randriamanamihaga et al., 2014). Fricker et al. (2012)
performed mean field analysis and measured the system
performance by calculating the stationary probability that
a station is either empty or full. Montoliu (2012) used La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation to discover station behavior pat-
terns in a Spanish bike sharing system. Chen et al. (2015)
examined the Washington, D.C’s system and detected the
significant bike usage by sliding-window based method and
selected unusual bike usage from its probabilistic distribu-
tion. They found that the most bicycle usages are located
at the downtown areas, public parks, sports stadiums, and
community centers. Corcoran et al. (2014) modeled the
daily trip number by Poisson distribution and measured
the effect of weather conditions and calendar events on
bike usage data in Australia’s CityCycle by multivariate
regression method.

It can be concluded that among all the analysis techniques,
the most widely used one is clustering. However, looking
at those works that focus on Vélib’ system, it might be
seen that six, eight or nine clusters identified by different
researchers. Therefore, there is no consensus about the
number of classes.

2.2 Motivation and Contributions

Understanding such complex systems which combine ran-
dom variables with a big number of stations and bikes is
a hard task. To do so, as other researchers we looked for
finding out a set of classes of stations by focusing on their
dynamic behaviors. We performed then clusterings with
more precise time scales while looking at the clustering
quality indexes in order to find out the most appropriate
number of classes that could help designers or controllers
to do their job.

The goal was to identify the bike station service level
and extract the temporal-spatial patterns of the bike
usage. Service level is measured by station availability
for both bike and dock. This indicator used to show
the basic statistical information. We collect the station
availability record from JCDecaux Open Data transferred
to a visualization interface in connection with Google map.
We applied k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms
to stations’ dataset and compare the results through a set
of quality indexes.

Our contributions can then be summarized as:

(1) Construction of station behavior database, started
from March 2015.

(2) Analysis of the stations behaviors by clustering
through unsupervised learning methods.

3. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS

We defined the time duration and extracted data from that
specific time period from Sep. 07, 2015 to Oct. 18, 2015 (six
weeks), because neither public holiday nor big event was
presented, so we can eliminate these exterior factors and
focus on the bike-usage on weekdays. The single station
data can be considered as data point, and the whole six
weeks’ dataset is formed by numerous discrete data points.
At each point it contains the information about the station
capacity, available bike number and parking place, current
update time, etc.

We defined the service level as the binary measurement of
availability. We consider a station as on-service if it has
at least one available bicycle and at least one free parking
place, otherwise we reckon it as off-service. For a station,
we compute the ratio of on-service status during the six
weeks’ data as its service level.

We follow the time-line to implement the service level
calculation: first we start from the first non-zero availabil-
ity data point in our dataset, and we stop at the first-
appeared zero availability point, then we calculate the time
duration in the unit of second by using the update time-
stamp of ending points to subtract the one from starting
point, we continue the computation until the whole time
line is covered. We set the accumulated time duration as

the station service level is yielded by the quotient.

From the global view, we calculate the service level of all
stations on the six weeks’ data on weekdays and group the
results by setting different value intervals.

Table 1 displays that no station keeps on-service status
for all the time and there are only 14% of stations whose
service level is higher than 95%. This indicates that
the system improvement is quite necessary. To achieve
this objective we need to acquire more comprehension of
the system, which means more analysis work should be
involved.

4. CLUSTERING

Clustering is the process of grouping elements such that
the inner-group elements as similar as possible while the
elements of different groups are as dissimilar as possi-
ble. Clustering analysis methods can be classified into
supervised or unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learn-
ing studies the patterns inside the input data without
any previous understanding or expert knowledge about
the awaited groups while supervised learning methods are
dedicated to discovering input data patterns by a well-
labeled training set. In our current research, as we look
for the classes without previous knowledge about them, we
have applied two unsupervised learning methods. Among
all cluster analysis methods we have chosen two very
largely used techniques: k-means and hierarchical cluster-
ing method.

4.1 K-means and Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms

K-means This algorithm groups the data points into a
certain number (assume as K) of clusters. First we define k
initial cluster centroids by assigning them to k data points
randomly. Next we calculate the distances between every
data point and its nearest centroid among the k newly
defined centroids. After each point is passed through, we
get k data clusters and now we need to calculate the new
centroids by averaging the points in their cluster. We re-
execute the data assigning phase and get newer centroids,
this iteration continues until no more change is generated.
Readers may refer to Hartigan (1975) for more details and
examples of this technique.

Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm It expresses a series of
operations which create data partitions based on the par-
tition generated in the former process. An agglomerative
type of algorithm first considers each of the n data point as
an individual cluster, and then a pair of clusters is found
and merged into a new one according to the global distance
measurement, so the size of dataset changes to n− 1. This
process advances until a single cluster containing n data
points appears. A divisive algorithm runs in the reverse
way, see Johnson (1967) for more details.

The Fig. 1 shows a typical process of agglomerative
(bottom-up) hierarchical clustering represented by a den-
drogram. The horizontal axis represents the elements or
items to classify while the vertical axis shows the distance
between elements or groups of elements. For instance the
distance between a and b is less than 0.1. One advantage
of hierarchical method lies on its flexibility to determine
how many clusters are considered. In fact, we can consider
three classes if we cut the dendrogram at the distance level
0.75. In this case, the groups are: (a, b, c, d, e), (f, g) and
(h, i, j). If more relevant clusters are required, the cutting
level could be at 0.5 which gives 5 clusters: (a, b), (c, d, e),
(f, g), (h) and (i, j).

5. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

Thanks to the literature review and discussions with
experts of the Vélib’ operator, we have defined two critical
times of the day: 7:00 to 10:00 and 17:00 to 20:00 referred
in the following as rush-hours.

5.1 Data Preprocessing

The raw data are always noisy (unusable values or has a
long update time gap due to data server issues). So we
filtered the dataset and re-constructed it before applying
the clustering algorithms.

The station is represented by a data vector with specific
number of dimensions. The data normalization need to
be done first. For a station i, we set its capacity (the
total number of bike parking places) as ci; at time t, the
available bike number is denoted as ni,t and we normalized
the availability data by calculating the occupation rate oi,t
in station i at specific time t, which is

oi,t =
ni,t
ci

(1)

Equation (1) is used to calculate the normalized availabil-
ity at one single data point. We set up a time sampling
period to allocate the data point to its right time interval.
For instance, with a sampling period of 12 hours, we get
two intervals; with one hour sampling period we get 24
intervals, see 2. Afterwards, the mean occupation rate
of the intervals is calculated and the respective multi-
dimensional vector is formed and is ready for clustering.

5.2 Data Representation

The sampling period affects both data vector precision
and computational cost. For a large period provides the
average values that can not describe the real occupation
rate level (averaging bias). A very small period may
contain insufficient data points because of the imbalance
of data upgrades by the JCDecaux’s servers and also it
increases the data matrix dimension and cause too much
computation. We have set six different sampling periods
as shown in Fig. 2. They are: 12 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours,
1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes; each point stands for
the mean occupation rate of the time interval with the
vertical line indicating the range of variation(mean value
± standard deviation).

Fig. 2. Comparison of time slot sampling on station 8015

As we want to find out a suitable trade-off between the
data precision and complexity, we used two different sam-
pling periods: 30 minutes for normal hours and 2 min-
utes for rush hours. For clustering, we use the Euclidean
Distance for both algorithms. For k-means process, we
find the cluster numbers from two to twelve considering
the interpretation difficulties. For hierarchical process, we
apply average linkage as the criterion of the measurement
between two merged clusters.

5.3 Discussion of Results

We use quality indexes explained in Rendón et al. (2011) to
evaluate the clustering results as we only have the intrinsic
information from the clusters themselves, so here are
several cluster validation tools which are used to measure
the quality of the clustering results:

• Davies-Bouldin index (Davies and Bouldin, 1979): the
smaller the better.

• Dunn index (Bezdek and Pal, 1995): the bigger the
better.

• Silhouette index (Rousseeuw, 1987): the bigger the
better.

• Calinski-Harabaz index (Caliński and Harabasz, 1974):
the bigger the better.

• Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik (PBM) index
(Pakhira et al., 2004): the bigger the better.

All these quality indexes concern about the cohesion
and separation of clusters, for the calculation they use
between-cluster distance, within-cluster distance, paired
point distance, etc. Interested readers may refer to Rendón
et al. (2011) for a complete survey of these basic concepts
of the quality indexes.

Clustering comparison The general clustering results
are computed on different sampling period and qualified
by the aforementioned quality indexes for the different
cluster number k. We pick up the 30-minute sampling
slot, normalize the index results and plot them together
as shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Index values for k-means and hierarchical clustering

Apart from the five indexes we have also introduced
another quality indicator called logarithm of ratio of
summed squares (Hartigan, 1975), by which an elbow
point is observed to help determine the cluster number
k. An elbow point on a curve representing a function y
of x means that the ratio between the variations of y
regarding the variations of x becomes too small to be
worthwhile. Therefore, often it corresponds to the best
trade-off between the knowledge we get about y from
varying x and the efforts we need to use to do so.

Table 2 summarizes the clustering results from the k-
means and hierarchical algorithms.

cluster number than others. It gets too many clusters that
would be hardly usable for any interpretation. Moreover,
looking at this index, it might be seen that it does not
have a stable behavior and does not show a real trend.
Silhouette, PBM and Calinski-Harabaz and Davis-Bouldin
yield clearly three clusters whereas four and five clusters
are also supported. Using these suggested values of the
cluster numbers, we plot the dynamic behavior of the
cluster centroid in k-means case to examine the temporal
patterns for three, four and five clusters at the same time,
shown as Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. Temporal patterns of general clusters on weekdays

The green curve is displayed by all three cases and it
could be explained as the cluster ”Employment” of which
two morning and evening peaks (i.e. the low availability
rate) are identified, as users arrive at the stations which
are located around the working places and put the bikes
off in the morning and take them away when they get
off the work in the evening. Compared with the green
one, the blue line shows the inverse behavior of which the
occupation rate decreases in the morning and increases in
the evening, which represents a pattern of ”Residence”.
Users ride bikes away when they leave the stations in
the morning and put the bicycles back when they get off
work. The red and black lines, in the case of four and
five clusters, both keeps relatively stable availability all
the time corresponding to low and high occupation rate
which can be thought as one line with different shifts.
Both can cause problems. The red stations correspond to
the ”starving” stations while the black ones represent the
”overfed” stations. The purple curve in the five-cluster
figure is very similar to the blue one and it can be
considered as the ”semi-residential” stations combining
those stations which cover mix industrial/economical and
residential spaces. Therefore, from the temporal point
of view, which focuses on the daily behaviors, it can
be concluded that three clusters seems to be the most
interesting clustering result. It defines the clusters which
represent properly three types of behavior. It is quite

intuitive. From spatial point of view, the stations within
the same cluster tend to locate at neighbouring areas (no
figure presented in the paper). Most of the stations in
cluster-employment locate along the Paris’s river and focus
on central part of Paris, which is considered as the major
working place region. Stations in cluster-residence can be
found around the cluster employment with the inverse
behavior. These ones are more located in residential places
outside central business districts. This cluster contains
almost half stations of the entire Vélib’ system, most of
which occupy the peripheral part of Paris.

Rush-hour Clustering We apply the same form of data
vector with different time-cut to rush-hour dataset. The
results are presented in Table 4. (K.M. as k-means, H.C.
as hierarchical clustering)

From Table 3 we can note that quality index results
converge towards two or three clusters for evening rush
hour, but the results of morning rush-hour clustering are
not conclusive. The inaccuracy of index assessment is
related to data sampling which considers the selection of
sampling periods and affects the precision of data vector.
For instance, the stations which locate at the central
business area have more bicycle pick-ups and returns than
the ones situated in suburban places, thus the whole
dataset of station holds unsynchronized update frequency
in the peak period of the day and this has an impact on
station availability sampling and the clustering results.

days

Considering this problem, we have analyzed the behaviors
of two, three and four clusters for both rush hours of
the day according to the suggestion of the quality in-
dex; we exclude the Dunn index. Despite the difference
between the morning and evening rush hours clustering,
the behaviors of cluster are similar for these two time
periods considering these three cases studied. Fig. 5 shows
the 4-cluster result from which we can identify different
behaviors of bicycle usages, and they are very similar to
the behaviors presented in the 4-cluster clustering results
as Fig 4, in condition of observing the same time range.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

We develop our research based on exhaustive digital foot-
print of Vélib’. The computed availability data allows us
to carry out the descriptive statistics analysis as well as
the clustering process.

In descriptive analysis we defined two station status which
are respectively on-service and off-service according to the
availability, then we determined the global station service
level by on-service status and it came to a conclusion
that the system did not reach a fully available state and
the improvement is necessary. Clustering process catego-
rized all the stations into several groups, which revealed
the bicycle usage patterns. By defining different station
data models, two types of clustering were implemented
by applying k-means and hierarchical method in terms
of identifying the station typology. Based on observations
made on the clustering yielded, we think that the four
clusters (employment, residential, starving stations, and
overfed) corresponds the best to the reality of the system
control and re-design because much clearer strategies and
recommendations may be determined for them (bike trans-
ferring from overfed to starving stations for instance).

This paper offers the insights on the entire system from
the view of station availability, but more research work
is still needed regarding to the clustering stability for a
longer time period. Also, with the knowledge extracted
from clustering, we could step forward to deploy super-
vised learning approaches into the research and gain more
understanding about the system.
