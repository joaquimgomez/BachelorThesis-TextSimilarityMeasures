Bike-sharing systems are a popular mode of public transportation, increasing in number and size around
the world. Public bike-sharing systems attend to the needs of a large number of commuters while
synchronizing to the rhythm of big cities. To better understand the usage of such systems, we introduce
an interactive visualization system to explore the dynamics of public bike-sharing systems by profiling its
historical dataset. By coordinating a pixel-oriented timeline with a map, and introducing a scheme of
partial reordering of time series, our design supports the identification of several patterns in temporal
and spatial domains. We take New York City's bike-sharing program, Citi Bike, as a use case and
implement a prototype to show changes in the system over a period of ten months, ranking stations by
different properties, using any time interval in daily and monthly timelines. Different analyses are pre-
sented to validate the visualization system as a useful operational tool that can support the staff of bike-
sharing programs of big cities in the exploration of such large datasets, in order to understand the
commuting dynamics to overcome management problems and provide a better service to commuters.

1. Introduction

Public bike-sharing systems (BSSs) are services of increasing
popularity, with many instances running around the world. The
system is based on a set of stations located at several spots around
the town with bikes available for rent. Commuters can take a bike
out of any station, ride it for a limited period and then return it to
any station. One problem with this usage scheme is that the
operational staff has little control over the distribution of resour-
ces (bikes) as commuters are always moving them around. This
control ensures that the stations do not get full or empty (an event
called outage), thus users can get a bike from any station and also
leave a bike at any station. Station rebalancing is used to prevent
outages. Trucks are used to move bikes from different locations,
which raise questions about how to choose the best route that
minimizes gas consumption and time. Also, trucks are subject to
traffic conditions and popular stations might need to be reba-
lanced more often than others.

Citi Bike of New York City is an example of a bike-sharing
system. It was deployed in May of 2013 and is the largest bike-
sharing system in the United States, officially serving 6000 bikes
.

through 330 stations with a total of more than 11,000 docks [1].
Rebalancing efforts in Balancing Bike-Sharing Systems are usually
done during the night when the usage frequency is minimal (or
there is no service at all). Citi Bike NYC's rebalancing operations
are performed during daytime to handle the intense commuting
behavior. The recording of the information about each station
throughout time (station states) can serve as an indicator of
unbalanced stations, as well as circulation habits in the city. The
analysis of usage data may lead to strategies for improving reba-
lancing procedures, plan upgrades in the infrastructure, and help
commuters better use the program. Previous work with such data
analysis usually focuses on simple scenarios, like small time win-
dows, few variables, only trips or only balance data. In this work,
we provide an exploratory view of bike-sharing usage data to
understand its underlying dynamics. We provide sample analysis
of such data that could be of use to the operational staff of bike-
sharing systems trying to improve the quality of service to com-
muters. The data is composed of the station states (number of
bikes and free slots available) recorded at periodic time intervals,
as well as commuter's trip information (origin and destination
station and timestamps). Fig. 1 shows one of the visual designs
proposed to inspect station state data.

The main contributions introduced in this work for the analysis
of this data can be summarized as follows:

Fig. 1. Average frequency (number of commuters leaving or taking a bike from a station per minute) on Mondays in New York City. (a) Station data can be inspected for a
given day, days of the week, or other periods of the year. Each station is presented as a row in the station state matrix (c) and as a circle on the map (e). In the station state
matrix, each cell is color-coded based on the value of a selected variable, sampled at a 15-min interval in a day-long timeline. On the map, circles represent station locations
with area proportional to the total capacity (maximum number of bikes supported). Rows (stations) can be ordered by any variable (b). A selected ordering is used in the
ranking of the top and last ten stations (d), which are shown in the map using colored circles. The timeline color changes indicate the behavior on working days, where
frequency peaks around 9am and 6pm. Ordering stations by maximum frequency show the 11 Av & 59 street station at the top with a frequency of at least 7.4 usages per
minute. Selecting the Central Park South & 6 Avenue station shows its row and surrounding stations (f). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the

2. Related work

Several works analyze the behavior of bike-sharing systems. In
this section, we report the related work and discuss how they
differ from our proposal. We organize this material in three sec-
tions: rebalancing systems for finding optimal routes and loading
operations, statistical tools for prediction and planning purposes,
and visual analytics tools for a similar type of data.

2.1. Balancing Bike-Sharing Systems

The balancing of BSSs discusses strategies to find optimal
routes that visit unbalanced stations while performing rebalancing
operations. Several papers address the optimization issues derived
from this problem, and our system could be used to visualize the
different results obtained in these algorithms. Rainer-Harbach
et al. [2] generate candidate routes for visiting unbalanced sta-
tions and optimal loading operations (load or unload) to be per-
formed along the route. Papazek et al. [3] also describe a hybrid
heuristic to find efficient vehicle routes, showing how it scales
with benchmark instances derived from real data from Vienna.
Raidl et al. [4] calculate optimal loading operations but use graph
maximum flow algorithms. Schuijbroek et al. [5] propose a heur-
istic to find loading operations and near-optimal vehicle routes to
rebalance the inventory. Urli et al. [6] address the problem of
instance generation for benchmarking proposed approaches to the
optimization problem of balancing BSSs. They describe a process to
generate input instances based on data from Citi Bike and rely on
very simple box plots to display the data. They display individual
daily plots for each station, which generates a great number of
plots to evaluate. Our system could be used in conjunction with
this data to more easily identify sinks and sources stations, as well
as rebalancing procedures that occurred.

2.2. Statistical tools for prediction and planning

Statistical tools allow analyzing system dynamics with minimal
use of visualizations. Our individual visual designs or complete
tool could be used to improve these statistical tools. Guenther
et al. [7] focus on the forecasting of future bicycle migration
trends. An analysis using data from the Barcelona's Shared Bicy-
cling program is described by Froehlich et al. [8] to gain an
understanding of human behavior and city dynamics. This pro-
posal relies on analytics tools to analyze 45 days of data. On the
other hand, our work makes extensive use of visualization and
interaction to support the exploration of a 10-month long dataset,
which can be easily extended to all data generated by Citi Bike. A
follow-up work by Froehlich et al. [9] compares experimental
results from four predictive models of near-term station usage,
considering impact factors such as time of day and station activity
in the prediction capabilities of the algorithms. In [10], a study is
given that relies on statistical modeling and data mining to model
the evolution of the dynamics of movement. Visual designs as we
proposed in this work can help in finding interesting patterns of
trip circulations.

2.3. Visual analytics

Visualization and analytics tools are used in the analysis of
bike-sharing dynamics. Maps displaying the operational status of
the system are given in the WorldMap system [11]. Such a visua-
lization is useful for understanding the current status of the sta-
tions, but inadequate to present the evolution of the operational
status in time such as we propose in this work, which helps to
identify bottleneck stations, among other problems. Several works
discuss the visual interpretation of bike data and their impact on
city life. Zaltz et al. [12] use visualization techniques, statistics,
spatial, and network analysis tools to explore bike-sharing system
usage in five different cities. A Voronoi diagram is created using

station locations to partition the city into regions [13], which are
then color-coded based on trip data (e.g. trip duration, age, user
profile, the number of bikes, etc). Kaufman [14] shows an analysis
of the popularity of Citi Bike stations between genders. Beecham
et al. [15] use coordinated views to understand cycling behaviors
in London.

The visualization of several trajectories allows understanding
the flow of bikes in the city, which is represented by lines with a
different thickness. A design study using visualization techniques
for bike-sharing systems is described by Wood et al. [16]. The bike-
sharing system is represented as a connected graph, where a
single resource (bike) circulates over edges to nodes with different
capacities. A visual analysis of London's bicycle system is described
in [17]. Two views show trips and station balance using a
restructuring scheme that avoids cluttering, while bike trips are
displayed on the map. Citi Bike trip data is used by O'Brien [18] to
estimate bike trajectories since trip data only contains origin and
destination. Ferzoco [19] shows trip circulations in NYC for a two-
day period. Our system is more flexible since it can be used to
inspect trip data in any period of time with different possibilities
of ranking this data. Hurter et al. [20] visualize changes in dynamic
graphs and paths using edge bundling. This approach could be
integrated into our visualization of trips to reduce cluttering. Taxi
trips are used by Ferreira et al. [21] to understand the city life
dynamics. To derive traffic information and visualize how traffic
jams propagate in the city, Wang et al. [22] fit trajectories given by
taxis with GPS to the road network. Guo et al. [23] use coordinated
views that are used to explore spatiotemporal data with a reor-
dering matrix representation of time series connected to a map.
While these works target a single question, variable, data facet
(balance or trips), or very limited periods, in our work, we aimed
for flexibility to support a more detailed understanding of BSS's
usage. In this sense, our work is closer to the one by Wood et al.
[17]. We add to the design by Guo et al. [23] a partial reordering to
explore a long history of system's activity in both stations’ balance
and trips, and to identify patterns, outliers, raise questions and
confirm prior theories.
3. Materials and methods

The proposed method was designed to conform to require-
ments that guided our data analysis and visual representations.

3.1. Desiderata

The goals in the analysis of bike-sharing systems were used to
formulate tasks that should be supported by visualization and
interaction. The result desiderata to be satisfied by the method
described in Section 4 are presented in the requirements below:

� R1: Identify stations that become bottlenecks in the system,
frequently getting outages (empty or full of bikes). This can help
design changes to improve the resilience of the system, pro-
viding better service for commuters.

� R2: Verify the influence of city life changes and events in the
behavior of bike-sharers. As the popularity of bike-sharing
programs increases, its dynamics becomes a relevant indication
of changes in the city life routine.

� R3: Understand how the distribution of station roles, into
source/provider and sink/receiver, changes through the day.
This division of tasks is recurrent in bike-sharing systems, being
usually a good indicator of commercial and residential areas,
and aspect of primary importance when designing balancing
solutions in BSS's.

� R4: Compare the dynamics of the system at different periods
since its deployment. As Citi Bike was deployed only recently,
the city is still adapting to it and vice versa. Looking into how
the usage dynamics changed over its first year may give rise to
valuable insights on what to expect when the system expands
to cover new areas and for the years to come. Also, it can show
how the cycling behavior changes through the seasons as the
weather varies.

3.2. Citi Bike data

The state of all stations in the Citi Bike system can be queried
by fetching the JSON feed [24]. The feed has current balance for all
stations and is updated every time the balance of one station
changes. The feed consists of a list of state entries, one for each
station. Each entry has the station id, name (address), number of
bikes available, number of free parking slots, latitude, longitude,
and timestamp of the last change. We tracked changes in the JSON
feed for eight months, at an interval of 30 s, since June of 2013, for
a total of more than ten million updates about the state of 330
stations. Fig. 2 illustrates both station state and trip data.

Changes in the station states happen when a commuter is
either parking or taking one bike out of the station. A sequence of
these events leads to a time-series sampled at irregular intervals.
The usage activity for one station on a given day is a sequence of n
events. A bike return is detected when the number of bikes
increases after an event. Otherwise, it is called a bike rental. The
capacity of each station is defined as the total number of slots. The
station balance is calculated as the ratio between the number of
bikes at the station and its capacity. Due to visualization con-
straints that we address in the next subsection, we reduced the
size of the time series data. We applied a piecewise aggregation to
resample the series into regular 15-min intervals. This interval was
satisfactory for a 24-h period and the station rate of usage.

Trip data was aggregated using a 1-h interval. We computed
aggregated measures for trips that began or ended in each interval:
balance, capacity, in/out difference, number of cyclic trips, number of
incoming trips, number of outgoing trips, outage state (empty, full or
no outage), number of incoming origins and outgoing destinations,
number of trips, trip duration and trip distance. Trips are divided into
three classes: outgoing, incoming, or cyclic. Outgoing and incoming
trips have different origin and destination stations while in cyclic trips
they are the same. For each interval, we counted each class separately
and the difference between incoming and outgoing stations. Outages
can be identified by the average balance (0 defines an empty outage,
1 a full outage). We use a threshold to allow values closer to 0 and 1 to
indicate outages. For example, if a threshold is 0.1, average balance
above 0.9 is considered a full outage, and below 0.1 as an empty
outage. Since trip distances are not provided, we estimated them by
the shortest path between the origin and the destination station given
by Google Directions using cycling routes. For cyclic trips, we estimated
the distance by multiplying the duration by the average speed of
2.7 m/s. Our Citi Bike dataset has station state information for each day
from June 2013 to March 2014, leading to about 270 time series per

station and 8000 series in total. We created daily and monthly
aggregations (from June 2013 to March 2014), as well as the summer,
fall, and winter seasons within this period.
4. Visualization designs

In this section, we describe visualization designs with inter-
active capabilities to explore data from bike-sharing systems.

Street Station (red circle on the map) ordered by maximum balance. The history is
shown as a line graph connecting ranking positions of the station for a sliding
window of 15 min from midnight to 6pm. The ranking for this station changes from
lower balance values at 9am to higher values at 6pm. (For interpretation of the
references to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of
this paper.)
4.1. Partially re-ordered station state matrix

Station state data might give insights about which stations are
often used during a given period of time, and how stations relate
to one another. This natural comparison among stations suggests
that station states be displayed in order of some attribute (number
of bikes available, balance, etc). However, this order changes dur-
ing the time series, and different rankings can be observed with
different time intervals. We use the linear representation of time
series from the work of Guo et al. [23] as it makes the best use of
screen space up to our knowledge, being able to represent hun-
dreds of series on the same screen with no overlap. In order to find
spatial patterns related to the different properties of the stations
over time, with adjustable temporal resolution, we improve this
representation with an interactive reordering scheme using
brushing, as explained below.

4.1.1. Station state timeline matrix
Each station state timeline is shown in individual horizontal

rows to avoid overlap. Data for all stations create a station state
timeline matrix, with rows identifying stations, and columns
associated to subsequent instants of time. Matrix cells are color-
coded based on a given variable. The column range of this matrix
has two resolutions: a 24-h timeline, with samples of data
aggregated over a 15-min period, and a 10-month timeline, with
samples aggregated for each day (Fig. 3).
4.1.2. Partial reordering using brushes
The rows of the station state matrix are ordered by their content. In

the left of Fig. 4, the rows are ordered according to the average value of
the entire timeline. If a particular time interval is important, it is
possible to reorder the rows considering only the data within this
interval. In the middle and right parts of Fig. 4, the rows are ordered
using other time intervals, defined by a timeline brush over the col-
umns of the matrix. The timeline brush can also be animated as a
sliding window to display how the station ranking changes over time.
The ranking history of each station is shown over the matrix as a line
graph when the station is selected (Fig. 5). Additionally, a ranking
brush is used to define an interval along the rows of the matrix. This
allows constraining the analysis to a subset of the ranking, important
when displaying station information on the map. We keep a ranking

panel with a list of the top and bottom 10 stations in the ranking brush
interval.

4.1.3. Coordinated view of map and station state matrix
We integrated the partially re-ordered station state matrix with a

map showing station locations. Fig. 1 gives an overview of the com-
ponents that create this coordinate view. The station state matrix in
Fig. 1(c) is the major interaction and informative component. The
average series can be displayed for different periods (e.g. specific day
or month, days of the week, weekdays, weekends, season, etc). The
selected variable, ordering scheme, color mapping, and normalization
can be changed in the panel of Fig. 1(b). Selected variables include:
balance, bikes available, free slots, frequency, station capacity, bike return,
bike return frequency, bike rental and bike rental frequency. The station
capacity is not always constant as expected. The sum of bikes available
and free slots does not always add to the same value at different
timestamps. Keeping track of this value over time may reveal unex-
pected changes that might indicate problems in a station. Ordering
options correspond to the same variables available for color coding in
the cells, reduced using one of the four reduction operators (max, min,
mean and range), and time-invariant properties of the stations (id,
name, latitude and longitude). The map in Fig. 1(e) shows each station
as a circle whose color is associated with the index of the row of the
respective station in the matrix, while the area encodes the capacity of
the stations. The selection of one station on the map highlights its row
using a lens metaphor, its entry in the ranking lists (if listed) and more
information on the panel of Fig. 1(f). Also, a circular region can be
defined on the map to select a group of stations.

In the 10-month timeline, each cell represents an aggregation
over entire days. Since a simple average is not informative, we
aggregated the data for each day by six different reduce operators:
average, minimum, maximum, range, and time of minimum and
Fig. 6. Trips timeline matrix. (a) Trips are represented by star-plot glyphs in their
respective cell of the matrix. (b) Incoming and outgoing trips are given by red and
blue lines respectively. Cyclic trips are drawn using a transparent circle with a
radius proportional to the trip distance. (c) Two stations selected in the matrix in a

maximum values. Such operators show the time of the day during
which extreme values were first registered.

4.2. Trips timeline and origin–destination matrices

Trips contain origin and destination stations and times of
pickup and drop-off. We use two matrix visual designs to explore
the outgoing directions of trips and the relationship between
origin and destination stations. This design allows inspecting the
station commuting behavior during the day and identify the trip
directions that might lead to station outages.

4.2.1. Trips timeline matrix
We use a timeline matrix similar to the station state matrix to

encode the outgoing direction of trips, with rows and columns
representing stations and time intervals, respectively. Partial re-
ordering of this matrix is similar to the state station matrix but
now using derived variables from the trip data. In each cell of this
matrix, we draw a glyph to encode the directions of trips from that
given station in the corresponding time interval. In Fig. 6 we
illustrate a portion of the timeline for two stations in the 9–12am
period. We use a 1-h aggregation interval for the trips, instead of
the 15-min interval used for the station states. The center of the
glyph corresponds to the station associated with the current row.
Every incoming trip at this station generates a red segment,
coming from the relative direction of the origin station. Similarly,
outgoing trips are colored in blue. Cyclic trips are represented with
a particular design. We use semi-transparent station-centered gray
circles that cover the area that a bike could reach if moving along a
straight line at an average speed of 2.7 m/s. Also, station outages
are encoded in the cell border color (red and blue are full and
empty outages respectively). This matrix timeline provides a
summary of how many trips started or ended at each station at
every hour, which are used to identify interesting time intervals
that can be selected for further inspection. Selected stations are
highlighted in the map view, with trip directions drawn using
curved lines, to avoid overlap of incoming and outgoing trips
between the same two stations, as used in the representation of
Wood et al. [17]. However, in our scheme, colors are used to differ
between outgoing and incoming trips: outgoing ones are drawn in
blue lines in clockwise order, while incoming trips are drawn in
red lines in anti-clockwise order (Fig. 6). Also, lightness is a cue of
direction: outgoing trips begins in the station at the cyan extreme
ending at the station in the blue extreme, while incoming trips go
from red (origin) to yellow (destination). Note that the selected
station is always at the lighter extreme of the curve.

4.2.2. Trips origin–destination matrix
The second matrix visual design is an origin–destination (OD)

matrix, with rows and columns representing outgoing and incoming
stations respectively. Cell colors are mapped to a trip variable aggre-
gated at the selected time. Possible variables include: number of trips,
trip duration, balance difference and station capacity difference. The
number and duration of trips can be used to identify preferred sta-
tions. The difference of balance from the incoming and outgoing sta-
tions encodes the states of the stations involved in the trip. The bal-
ance difference varies from �1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates that the
incoming station is full and the outgoing station is empty (critical
case). On the other hand, a value of �1 shows the opposite; a full
station at the origin and an empty station at the destination (ideal
case). Closer to zero values means that the two stations have similar
balances. The capacity difference helps distinguish trips that occurred
from bigger to smaller stations (or vice versa), or between stations
with equivalent capacities. Aggregate values can be shown for days of
the week, weekdays, weekends, months, seasons, or simply a parti-
cular day of the year. Partial reordering is similar to the station state

matrix, using the following variables: station trips, capacity, latitude,
longitude, number of trips, trip duration, and balance.

The OD trip matrix can be inspected using a manual or auto-
matic selection. In the manual selection, the user navigates over
the trips OD matrix to find relevant patterns. The vertical and
horizontal brushes select the stations that serve as start or end
points, respectively. To conserve geospatial context along with the
trips matrix view, we use a map that shows each station as a circle
whose color is associated with their role in the selected trip.
Outgoing stations are drawn in blue, incoming stations in red, and
stations that serve as both source and sink in purple. The second
mode uses a variable to automatically select stations. This allows
making comparisons based on the percentage of a variable range.
For example, automatic selection with a range of 70–100% for the
balance difference finds the highest 30%, in this case with values
between 0.4 and 1. This and other two selections are illustrated
in Fig. 7.
5. Results

Next, we describe several analyses performed over the NYC Citi
Bike data. We show a high-level calendar overview analysis, from
an in-depth exploration of specific days of the week in different
periods (months or seasons), to answering queries of stations and
circulation patterns.

5.1. Calendar view analysis

The calendar view supports an overview analysis as the initial
stage of the exploration pipeline. By combining any of the derived
variables extracted from the station state feeds with a choice of
how to reduce it for each day, it gives different perspectives on
how the Citi Bike program developed along the 10 months after
inception. Fig. 8 shows different visual profiles, with color scales
chosen according to the nature of the variable displayed. Column
patterns are visible in almost all profiles and serve as good points
to start the analysis of the data.

The first profile row displays maximum and average balance.
The max balance reveals that in the early months (summer), it is
common for the stations to get close to a full outage at least once a
day. This pattern changes as fall and winter approach and system
usage decreases. Since balance is aggregated over a whole day in
this view, we cannot argue about the severity of the outage (its
duration), such analysis needs to be done in the 24 h timeline view
presented ahead. The average balance has a predominance of
neutral values (lighter colors) at early months. This pattern begins
changing slightly when Fall arrives, with stations showing darker
red and blue patterns.

In the first profile of the middle row, we show the daily maximum
bikes available at each station. There is a column pattern of lighter
colors in February, which indicates a smaller number of bikes at sta-
tions. This could mean that either bikes were removed from the sys-
tem, or more bikes were circulating. By looking at other profiles, we
observe that the first explanation is more likely. Profile (d) shows a
decrease in the maximum return frequency during the same period.
This profile also reveals a period of outliers at the end of January. The
regularity of the anomaly makes the operational activity be the likely
cause for the pattern observed.

In the third row, we also display return frequency like in profile
(d), but instead we encode the time of the day when the max-
imum value was registered. The purpose of this perspective is to
see which stations are destinations by morning (orange) and night
(purple). Profile (g) displays the time of maximum using total
frequency (returns plus rentals). We observe which stations are
more used during early and late hours, regardless if the station is
origin or destination. Both perspectives show stations becoming
popular at early hours during winter (the increase of orange color
during this period), but only the second one brings up the system-
wide anomaly that happened at the ending of February (a dark
purple column). The profiles (e) and (h) are based on the station
capacity, which is supposed to be constant, but the profiles show
otherwise. In profile (e) we observe changes in the average capa-
city (e.g., end of February). The time of minimum capacity of the
stations in profile (h) reveals a pattern of the predominance of late
hours until the end of August. There is a sudden change at early
hours, changing again in November, with a single-day-wide purple
column followed by a random pattern until March.

Fig. 9. Monthly frequency during weekdays and weekends. System usage increase is observed when profiles get darker from June to October, and lighter during the winter.
Some profiles show interesting results: October weekends have a peak of use around 8pm, the 9am peak on weekdays of January is more evident than at 8pm, and weekends
of February have two short peaks around 11am and 3pm. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this

16 February. And a strong one-hour-long frequency peak around 8pm on 26

Fig. 11. Partial ordering of four profiles in a 24-h period: (a) ordering stations (rows)
considering the balance from the first third of the day. A pattern reveals that stations
with high balance (red) change into low balance (blue) after 8am, and return back at
6pm. The same pattern is not visible for weekends (b), with no clear definition of roles
for the stations, and an even distribution of balance. Another partial reordering of
weekdays around 9am is given in (c). We observe that stations with low return fre-
quency around 9am have a high return frequency at 6pm, which is a common com-
muter pattern. The balance in (d) using the same ranking of (c) allows to find provider
and receiver stations. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption,

5.2. Daily view analysis

In the calendar view analysis, we identified smooth changes
along the 10-month timeline and anomalies in the different pro-
files of the station state data. Daily timeline views allow narrowing
the analysis to specific days in which unexpected behaviors hap-
pened. Fig. 9 shows weekday and weekend profiles in monthly
frequency. There is a clear difference between the system usage
during workdays and weekends. Frequency on weekdays has two
peaks, one around 9am when commuters go to work, and another
at 6pmwhen they return home. The usage during the day is higher
than early morning or late night, but lower at rush hours. During
weekends, there is a single wider, lower, and smoother peak that
begins later than weekdays, at 10am, and ends later, at 9pm. Since
the same color scale and extreme values were shared between the
profiles, we observe that Fall had the most intense activity (overall
darker colors) with a strong decrease during Winter. We notice the
contrast increasing from June to October and decreasing again to
February. Also, the duration of the weekend peak during Winter
was shorter than the other months (11am–6pm), probably due to
shorter days and longer nights.

There is a peak between 9 and 10pm only seen during week-
ends in the Fall. To further inspect these outliers we drill down
specific days of the week. Fig. 10 compares the frequency of
Saturdays and Sundays in October, revealing that the anomaly
comes from the former. By looking into the profiles of each
Saturday of October, we found out that it only happened on the 26
October. Fig. 10 also shows other two outlier days with different
patterns. Due to the synchronization and intensity of those pat-
terns, it is unlikely that they were caused by the commuters
activity.

Fig. 12. Station analysis. All station data can be queried using different variables and aggregations. Timeline and station brushes allow narrowing the period and highlight
stations on the map. (a), (b) Highest and lowest balance average of full and empty stations during working hours of Wednesdays during the Summer. A separation on the
map can be seen between nearly full stations below midtown and empty ones at north. (c) Stations with the lowest range of balance during the day. (d) Stations with the
highest number of bikes during working hours. Highest station capacity for Wednesdays during Fall (e) and on 01/28/2014 (f). This particular day has an unusual change for
some stations around 9am. Using the time brush to select this interval allows finding the most affected stations.

Fig. 13. Station roles. Stations are ordered by average balance at different times in a
typical weekday in the Fall of 2013. We observe a change of station roles (providers
or receivers) during the day. Early in the day, most riverside stations are almost full
(red circles). This situation changes as time goes by and it is almost the opposite at
2pm, returning to the initial setting after 9pm. (For interpretation of the references
to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this
paper.)

Fig. 14. Usage frequency on weekdays at different times. Stations around Penn
station show early movement. As the day progresses, the frequency increases in
other parts of Manhattan. At night, it is not completely back to normal in areas with
entertainment options.

Fig. 11 shows how to use partial reordering to find temporal
patterns. The brush defines the extent of the partial reordering in
the matrix. Different patterns arise for weekdays and weekends.
On weekdays, top-ranked balance stations are full in the morning,
become empty during working hours, and back to full again at
night. Lower-ranked stations have the opposite behavior. However,
during weekends this pattern is not visible, as bikers have an
unpredictable behavior, riding more for leisure than for working.
In the bottom row, we display the return frequency on weekdays
and order the rows by the same 8–10am interval (morning rush
hour). The result clearly shows working hours destinations at the
top and origins at the bottom.



Fig. 15. Incoming trips on weekdays at different times for station E17 & Broadway.
Using the trips matrix we identified E17 & Broadway as a commuting hub. Being a
central station, it sustains intense activity from 6am to 10pm, as a destination of
trips from almost every part of the city.

Fig. 16. Incoming trips on weekdays at different times. Top: Station 1 Ave & E30 St.
Bottom: Station 2 Ave & E30 St. As the day goes by, the frequency of incoming trips
decreases for the top station and increases for the bottom station, despite being
nearby stations. At night, we observe a high number of incoming trips coming from
the southern part of the city for the 1 Ave & E30 station.

Fig. 17. Cyclic trips on Sundays in the Summer of 2014. Stations are ranked by the
average number of cyclic trips. Cyclic trips are evenly distributed around 4pm. The
Central Park station has the highest number of cyclic trips per hour.

Fig. 18. Outages. Stations are ranked by the number of outages. Areas with a higher
concentration of stations suffer from outages on weekdays: Midtown and East
Village in Manhattan, and between Fort Greene Park and the Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn. Midtown and in Williamsburg have outages on weekends. Also, notice
the difference between the overall distribution of outages in weekdays and the one
in the weekends. It has a larger spread in the weekdays.

5.3. Station analysis

An important design requirement is to be able to identify the
stations that become bottlenecks of the system by having outages.
Our prototype provides a myriad of ways to look at this data. It is
possible to select which variable to inspect, different aggregation
periods, narrow the data scope using brushes and evaluate the
station rankings generated using partial reordering. In Fig. 12, we
illustrate six queries using different criteria. In (a) and (b) the
brush is defined between 9am and 5pm. Stations are ordered by
the average balance in that period of the day. Using the station
brush (selecting rows of the matrix) we order stations according to
their average balance. In (a) the brush is limited to the highest
rows of the matrix, which reveals on the map the stations that are
usually full at the selected period (Wednesdays during the Sum-
mer). In (b), the brush selects the lowest rows to reveal empty
stations. We observe a division between full and empty stations in
the lower and upper parts of the area covered by the program
respectively. In (c) rows are ordered by their range of balance
values during the day. By selecting the lowest rows, we found that
these stations remained at a nearly constant balance level. An
interesting task is to find out where the majority of bikes of the
program are at a given interval. In (d) the number of bikes avail-
able in the stations is displayed. Ordering the rows by the number
of bikes available and selecting the highest rows with the brush
allows drawing in the map the stations with the largest number of
bikes. Stations of higher capacity are shown in (e) for Wednesdays
during Fall. Since the capacity is constant for each station, the
expected pattern is a smooth vertical gradient. However, the
capacity results for a single day revealed changes in this data, In
(f) there is an anomaly in the capacity profile on 01/28/2014

Rows in the OD trip matrix are ordered by station balance, and colored from high
(yellow) to low (red) values. (a) Stations with highest 20% at noon showing trips
that leads to outages and (c) corresponding OD matrix. (b) Stations with lowest 20%
and (d) corresponding OD matrix. (For interpretation of the references to color in

G.N. Oliveira et al. / Computers & Graphics 60 (2016) 119–129128
around 9am. Selecting this interval in the timeline brush and
ordering the rows by capacity allows finding the affected stations.

5.4. Circulation and outage analysis

Bike movement can be observed during the day by looking at
changes in the average balance. An alternating pattern of station
roles was observed in Fig. 11. To complement this analysis, in
Fig. 13 we display station data on the map. Red and blue circles on
the map correspond to full and empty stations respectively. At
6am most bikes are located at riverside stations. At 9am few bikes
are parked, probably because bikers are commuting to work. At
early afternoon, the opposite happens. There is a concentration of
full stations in the middle of Manhattan, while riverside and
Brooklyn stations are empty. Later in the day (after 9pm) the
system nearly returns to the original morning situation, with
slightly higher concentration at Williamsburg and East Village.

Fig. 14 displays the overall usage frequency during weekdays in
the Fall of 2013. The day begins with little activity, except for stations
nearby Penn station. Usage frequency increases in Manhattan
towards the financial district and midtown around 9am, decreasing
again only late in the night. Also, stations near Broadway are shown
to be popular destinations, as expected. There is some increase in the
Brooklyn downtown area, but not as intense as in Manhattan.

While balance derived data can tell a lot about commuters circu-
lation, trip data add distance, duration and origin–destination infor-
mation. We used the trips timeline and OD matrix to explore and
relate both balance and trip data. With the timeline showing trips as
glyphs, we could easily find patterns in the direction of trips of the
stations. In Fig. 15 the timeline of trips shows how the station at E17 &
Broadway has a constantly high flow of incoming trips coming from
every direction, while the map shows the trip directions in different
time intervals. Fig. 16 now relates the arrival patterns of two neighbor
stations. As the incoming flow at 1 Ave & E30 St. station decreases, the
flow at Station 2 Ave & E30 St. increases proportionally.

As observed before, there is a significant difference in station
usage during weekdays and weekends. During weekends, there is
no clear partitioning of the city into regions of contrasting beha-
vior. However, an evident pattern is the increase of cyclic trips. In
Fig. 17, we inspect Sunday trips in the Summer of 2014. Stations
are ranked by the average amount of cyclic trips between 9am and
midnight. We observe that cyclic trips happen more frequently
around leisure spots such as the Central, Battery, and Brooklyn
Bridge Parks. Another difference betweenweekdays and weekends
is the places where outages occur. As can be seen in Fig. 18,
outages happen during weekdays in the upper north stations in
Midtown, East Village and a region of Brooklyn. Over the week-
ends, outages happen in Midtown and Williamsburg.

A different, trip-centered, outage analysis can be done using
the OD Trips Matrix. By aggregating day intervals in three defined
periods of times we can show different behaviors during the day.
We considered four-hour long intervals: 6am–10am (morning),
10am–2pm (lunch), and 5pm–9pm (evening). To identify the
highest values, we used the automatic selection with a percentage
range of 80–100%, which means that only the highest 20% will be
selected. Similarly, for the lowest values, we used the 0–20% range.
Balance difference (BD) was the selected variable to inspect
because it can be used to identify problematic trips, i.e. trips that
contribute to outages in the system, taking a bike from an almost
empty station to another one almost full. In Fig. 19 we used the OD
trip matrix to find such trips, the ones with high BD. The opposite
kind is also shown, with lowest BD values: full stations at the
origin and empty stations as the destination. March 2014 was used
for this test, showing that evening trips from the middle region to
the north or south are more guaranteed to avoid outages.
6. Discussion

Our prototype led to several insights in the usage of the Citi Bike
program for the first 10 months of use, demonstrating the potential
to analyze Bike-Sharing Systems in general. The solution can be
applied to other similar BSSs, where datasets represent the state of
stations and trips between them, as a problem of flow of commod-
ities in a graph. The 10-month timeline (Fig. 8) showed how to follow
commuters behavior as the program matured and the city under-
went weather changes (design requirement R4). The same trends can
be found by looking for patterns in different periods using the 24-h
view (Fig. 9). The straightforward analysis that followed was the
comparison among different days of the week, same days of the
week in different periods, and weekdays against weekends.
Anomalies were easily identified in specific days and hours as sud-
den changes of color in the different matrix views as shown in Fig. 10.
Due to the regularity of the anomalies, lack of spatial correlation
among affected stations, we concluded that they were related to
operational activities. A possible cause could be special events in the
city at the given periods of time, however, we could not find such
case in the news that would explain the outliers.

Another problem is finding stations that fit a given criteria,
such as empty or full outages (design requirement R1). We
showed that brush-wise reordering of the rows in the matrix by
different variables was useful to identify locations on the map that
exhibit the behavior we are looking for. We found full and empty
stations during working hours on the map in Fig. 12(a) and (b);
identified stations with almost no balance change in usual days in
Fig. 12(c); showed stations that kept the highest amount of bikes
in Fig. 12(d) and found unexpected changes in the capacity of
stations comparing Fig. 12(d) and (e). More than helping in the
search of patterns, the reordering brushes was essential to create
time lapses that show the evolution of rankings through time.
Figs. 13 and 14 showed how bikes moved among different city
regions (associated with the requirement of finding station roles
R3), and the system usage in a typical working day. We observed
changes in popularity among the regions of Manhattan, Brooklyn,
and Williamsburg in Fig. 18 by looking at the station rankings for
the frequency of outages in both weekdays and weekends.

Seasonal trends were clearly observed, with a considerable
decrease in the rate of commuting during cold months (even



G.N. Oliveira et al. / Computers & Graphics 60 (2016) 119–129 129
though it was still surprisingly high given the harsh weather). We
found no explanation for the anomalies identified by relating them
to unusual events in the city (design requirement R2), resting on
the assumption that those were caused by operational issues.
Finally, the results validated the hypothesis that data from bike-
sharing can be used to provide many cues of the city lifestyle, and
that our proposal is adequate for this analysis.
7. User scenarios

We believe that the main contribution in this work is more
than the individual visual designs or the user interactions descri-
bed in Section 4, but instead their combination into an integrated
tool suitable for the analysis of Citi Bike data. We list below pos-
sible scenarios of users that can benefit from our system:

� Scenario 1 – BSS administrator: The administrator can use the
station state timeline matrix with partial re-ordering to forecast
a group of top ranked stations' outages, and use this informa-
tion to prioritize staff re-balancing assignments. This analysis
heavily depends on the day of the week and the time of the day
considered. The flexibility of the interface combined with the
user interface offers the user the ability to process the different
groups of top ranked stations generated in different time
searches. As a result, the administrator can assign rebalancing
staff and resources on a weekly, monthly, or seasonal basis.

� Scenario 2 – Rebalancing researcher: In Section 2.1 we list papers
that propose re-balancing algorithms for BSS's. Most of these
algorithms work with real data from BSSs, but generate simulated
data that forecast alternative re-balancing scenarios. Our system
could be used to further inspect such simulated scenarios. For
example, deletion or insertion of stations can be simulated in
these algorithms, and our tools can be used to inspect the impact
of the results at specific stations or group of stations.

� Scenario 3 – Big data analyst: Our system offers a flexible way to
inspect trips (e.g. the timeline matrix or trips OD matrix). The
patterns of trip movements can be used by a big data analyst to
find correlations and customer preferences. This analysis can be
used to improve marketing along important routes, suggest
revenue opportunities, among other business benefits.
8. Conclusion

Operating a bike-sharing system deployed in a big city is a chal-
lenging task due to the intense commuting dynamics and its com-
plexity. In such scenario, when the number of outages increase,
rebalancing requires more effort as the system is usually larger (more
stations and bikes) and the rebalancing fleet is subject to traffic jams.
This is even more important when the system provides 24-h service
and rebalancing must be done on-the-fly. A deeper understanding of
the system dynamics may help the operational efforts to provide a
better service. For this purpose, we introduced visualization designs
to support the exploration of a dataset with station usage footprint
and user trips from NYC Citi Bike. Data can be visualized for specific
days, or aggregated over different time periods. The designs we
proposed introduced different matrix visualizations of the data,
combined with a brushing interface that created partial re-orderings
of the data. We presented results to validate the applicability of the
proposed solution over a 10-month long period, which can be used
to justify the adoption of the bike-sharing as a new transportation
mode. Even though we did not introduce a solution to rebalancing,
we believe that our analysis tool may improve rebalancing schemes
by adding instance-specific knowledge to current solutions.
