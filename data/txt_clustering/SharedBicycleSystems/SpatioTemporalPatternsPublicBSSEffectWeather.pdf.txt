Public Bicycle Sharing Programs (PBSPs) have become a prominent feature across city spaces worldwide.
In less than a decade, PBSPs have grown from a small number of European cities to include five continents
and in excess of 200 schemes. Despite the rapid rise of this new transport opportunity, there has been
limited research on the underlying dynamics of these schemes, arguably reflecting a lack of detailed data
available to researchers. The current paper redresses the observed deficit using trip level data from Bris-
bane’s ‘CityCycle’, the largest PBSP in Australia. These data provide an opportunity to investigate the spa-
tio-temporal dynamics of a large PBSP system, specifically the effects of weather and calendar events on
the geographic and temporal patterning of public bicycle use.

Employing novel spatial analytical techniques we explore the impact of site specific weather conditions
and calendar events on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the case study PBSP. We conclude by highlight-
ing how the results from such analyses may form part of an evidence base for policy makers, providing
insights into ‘best practice’ and potentially informing future PBSP expansions to further enhance uptake
of this non-motorised urban transport mode.

1. Introduction

Public Bicycle Sharing Programs (PBSPs) have a long history dat-
ing back to an unsuccessful 1965 pilot scheme in Amsterdam,
which was plagued by vandalism and theft (Shaheen et al.,
2010). The recent explosion in the size and scale of PBSPs has been
facilitated by the digital registration of PBSP users pioneered in a
small scale program (25 bicycles during the scheme’s pilot phase,
eventually increasing to 75 bicycles) at Portsmouth University in
1996 (Black & Potter, n.d.), and subsequently rolled out at a city-
wide scale in Renne in 1998, followed by Munich in 2000. These
early programs were replicated at still larger scales in Lyon in
2005 (4000 bicycles in the scheme) and then Paris in 2007 (7000
bicycles initially expanding to 23,600) – see Henley (2005) and
DeMaio (2009). Rapid growth in PBSPs followed and, at the time
of writing, PBSPs can be found in five continents and include in
excess of 200 schemes (Ahillen et al., accepted for publication).
The system for tracking bicycles and the identity of bicycle users
in the modern PBSP systems has resulted in rich datasets with
the potential to unveil the underlying dynamics of PBSPs, and pro-
vide insights into the contribution of these schemes to urban pub-
lic transport.

Two distinct types of data capturing the dynamics of PBSPs have
emerged in recent years: data capturing stocks, and data capturing
flows. Stock data track variations in the number of bicycles docked
at stations within a PBSP network. Such data can provide insights
into spatio-temporal fluctuations in demand across a system (see
Kaltenbrunner et al., 2010), but do not capture the underlying
mobility behaviour (e.g. trips). Flow or trip data have emerged much
more recently, and are consequently more limited in their availabil-
ity. At present, the use of PBSP trip level data has been confined to a
small number of studies that have been restricted in scope to mea-
suring operational dimensions of the PBSP. One example of such an
operationally-focussed study is the analysis of spatial flows by
Jensen et al. (2010). The primary focus of this work was to determine
the average transport speed within the network. A second study of
the Parisian PBSP (Vélib) by Nair et al. (2013) was concerned with
the issue of establishing ‘balance’ across the bicycle network. To
date, there has been little attempt to analyse these rich trip level
datasets with the more generic goal of better understanding the spa-
tio-temporal dynamics of human spatial mobility. It is the purpose
of the current paper to demonstrate how trip level data can be inter-
rogated to help shed insight into the dynamics of PBSP journeys. We

demonstrate the utility of these data by exploring how external
effects, including weather conditions and calendar events (i.e. pub-
lic holidays and weekends) impact on the spatial distribution and
timing of PBSP trips in Brisbane, Australia.

Weather conditions are known to exert an influence on cycling
patterns. Previous studies have revealed the significant of role
inclement weather as a detractor whereas warm and dry weather
conditions were found to encourage both commuting and in partic-
ular recreational bicycle trips (see for example, Nankervis, 1999;
Brandenburg et al., 2007; Parkin et al., 2008; Heinen et al., 2011;
Thomas et al., 2013). In addition, calendar events such as public
holidays and weekends have also been identified as a factor influ-
encing cycling dynamics (see for example, Brandenburg et al.,
2007; Borgnat et al., 2011). Studies have suggested such periods
of time reflect changes in the routine activities of individuals and
families which in turn have the potential to bring about both
increased and reduced prevalence in the spatio-temporal patterns
of bicycle trips. Taken together, weather conditions and calendar
events (for example, a warm, dry and light wind public holiday
versus a cool, wet and windy weekday) potentially have a signifi-
cant role to play in explaining the spatial distribution and timing
of PBSP trips.

The visualisation component of the analysis requires the inte-
gration of existing spatial exploratory analysis tools. In this paper
we embed flow maps (Thompson and Lavin, 1996), which graphi-
cally present origin–destination flow matrices, into the comap
(Brunsdon, 2001), which displays spatial information conditioned
on one or more external variables. This new analysis technique,
we term the flow-comap, which in combination with a regression
modelling exercise and a suite of metrics is demonstrated to be
capable of illuminating the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics
of our case study PBSP, Brisbane’s CityCycle Scheme. The flow-
comap is able to graphically depict subtle changes in usage pat-
terns under different weather conditions (for example, a hot versus
a cold day), and across various calendar events (for example, a pub-
lic holiday versus a ‘normal’ working day).

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section
2, the role and benefits that PBSPs potentially hold for our urban
areas is outlined, along with the number of studies that have begun
to explore the rich databases PBSPs are generating. In Section 3, the
case study area and various data drawn upon in this paper are
described in detail. In Section 4, results are presented, first at the
system-wide or aggregate level, and second at the sub-system
scale using the flow-comap. This is followed by a discussion of
the insights that our exploratory data analyses bring in Section 4
and concluding remarks in Section 5.

2. Background

2.1. The rise and benefits of PBSPs

PBSPs have been in existence for the past 50 years, however, it
is only in the last couple of years that these systems have gained
currency as an important citywide transport strategy; addressing
the twin challenge of reducing traffic congestion and providing
sustainable transport alternatives in cities. From an estimated
70,000 bicycles in operation in 78 cities across 16 countries in
2009 (Midgley, 2009), this numbers increased to 139,300 bicycles
spread across 125 cities in 5 continents (Europe, North America,
Australia and Asia) a year later (Shaheen et al., 2010). A more
recent count, of PBSPs with 100 or more bicycles and 10 or more
stations, estimates that there are in the order of 200 PBSPs around
the globe, of which 70 per cent were implemented between 2010
and 2012 (Ahillen et al., accepted for publication). Studies of PBSPs
have lagged behind implementation reflecting the fact their data-
sets have only recently become available.
Nonetheless, there are a number of studies reporting the social
and environmental benefits of PBSPs. For example, Montreal’s bike
sharing scheme has been found to save over 1.3 million kilograms
of greenhouse gases since inception in May 2009 (DeMaio, 2009).
More broadly, the implementation of PBSPs has been demon-
strated to increase the overall cycling share in cities with the effect
of decreasing carbon emissions and reducing urban traffic conges-
tion (Shaheen et al., 2010; DeMaio, 2009; Cavill and Davis, 2007;
Cavill et al., 2006). Barcelona (Romero, 2008) and Paris (Nadal,
2007), for example, have seen a 1 and 1.5 percentage point increase
per annum in the proportion of bicycle journeys, respectively. In
2007, Lyon’s bicycle count increased by 75 per cent contributing
to a two percentage point increase in bicycle trips across the city.
According to Cavill and Davis (2007), empirical results have shown
that bicycle sharing has significantly improved individual fitness
and contributed towards public health improvements, such as a
risk reduction on a range of health problems, most notably heart
disease and cancer (Cavill and Davis, 2007; Cavill et al., 2006).

While cataloguing the strengths and weaknesses of PBSPs
undoubtedly assists in better understanding their role within lar-
ger urban transport systems, we argue that the ultimate success
of PBSPs is dependent on improved knowledge of the fundamental
dynamics of the system (e.g. volume, pattern and timing of trips)
along with the extent to which various system attributes (e.g.
number of stations, climate regime, etc.) affect usage. O’Brien
et al. (2014) highlights the importance of developing such knowl-
edge in their analysis of 38 PBSP located across Europe, the Middle
East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. Furthermore, they stress
the need for a PBSP-specific understanding of dynamics given that
flow patterns vary widely between systems, resulting in unique
challenges for operators in maintaining an optimal distribution of
bicycles to meet variations in demand.

To date, considerably less attention has been dedicated to
empirically examining the underlying dynamics of these schemes
than to exploring system-wide patterns (Borgnat et al., 2013). This
situation is arguably underpinned by a general lack of data avail-
able to researchers, a status that is slowly changing as more PBSP
operators open up access to both stock and flow data. It is crucial,
however, that planners not only understand the contexts in which
PBSPs are implemented, but also are able to draw on reliable tools
and metrics to interrogate stock and flow data. Such tools and met-
rics will facilitate the implications of evolving policies affecting
PBSPs use to be evaluated along with evidenced-based changes
to schemes implemented that better respond to mobility needs
of its catchment populace.
2.2. Spatial analytical research on PBSPs

Since 1965 PBSPs have evolved through four generations from
the initial introduction of the first generation white bicycles (or
free bicycle systems), to the coin-deposit systems of the second
generation, followed by the integration of information technol-
ogy-based systems in the third generation and most recently the
roll-out of demand responsive systems as part of the fourth gener-
ation (DeMaio, 2009; Shaheen et al., 2010). As such, operators of
third generation PBSPs onwards are now able to gain access to
real-time usage data of their networks. Collected via mobile
devices or other ICT-based measures, this information can then
be drawn upon to enhance our understanding of individual travel-
ler’s behaviour, offer real-time travel information, and also present
personalised location-based services. Moreover, fine-grained data
on the status of shared bicycles also enables an empirical measure-
ment of the impacts of proposed system improvements or policy
changes (e.g. fare restructuring) as well as the results of force maj-
eure on the system (e.g. flooding).

A number of studies have utilised stock or usage data to explore
spatial and temporal patterns. A recent example includes the work
by O’Brien et al. (2014) in which they draw on data for 38 systems
and propose a classification of schemes using their geographical
footprint in conjunction with spatio-temporal usage patterns. This
study highlights the utility of stock data to compute various met-
rics that have value in a range of application areas, including
informing issues of maintaining system balance and identifying
potential new sites for docking stations. Other studies using stock
data include the examination of Barcelona’s ‘Bicing’ scheme by
Froehlich et al. (2009) who investigated user behaviour across sta-
tions in relation to location, neighbourhood, and time of day. Also
in the European context, Borgnat et al. (2009) predicted the num-
ber of bicycles hired per hour in Lyon’s community bicycle pro-
gram to describe the daily and weekly patterns. The prediction
method involved several explanatory factors such as the number
of subscribed users, the time of the week, the occurrence of holi-
days or strikes, and weather parameters. However, methods to
identify and visualise spatio-temporal patterns (i.e. location and
times when frequency of bicycle use is particularly high) based
on flow or trip data have not been adequately examined in past
studies, particularly, in Australia. A limited number of international
studies which are exceptions to this deficit include the examina-
tion of Lyon’s Vélo’v (Borgnat et al., 2011, 2013) and the visual
exploration of the London scheme (Wood et al., 2011). Wood and
colleagues advocate a visual approach to understanding the com-
plex spatio-temporal patterns of PBSP usage and offer a particu-
larly useful discussion on the graphical challenges associated
with representing the large origin–destination matrices generated
by PBSPs. Furthermore, they express the need to follow good prac-
tice in the design of flow maps that necessitates careful spatial and
temporal aggregation in order to reveal underlying patterns. To
date, the study by Ahillen et al. (accepted for publication) compar-
ing the temporal dynamics between the Brisbane and Washington
Fig. 1. Public bicycle st
DC schemes is the only Australian study that draws on flow data.
However, this study did not extend to an examination of spatial
patterns. To progress the previous work there is, therefore, a need
to better understand the location, time and reasons for these indi-
vidual uses to inform strategies to ensure a more successful PBSP
implementation.
3. Case study region and input data

This section first describes Brisbane, the study context, before
introducing the input data drawn upon in the analysis. Three dat-
abases are used in this study: (1) CityCycle trip data; (2) calendar
events; and (3) daily weather data. The three databases are inte-
grated such that for any single bicycle trip it is possible to ascertain
the weather conditions during which the trip occurred and
whether it coincided with any salient calendar event.
3.1. Brisbane, case study region

Brisbane, the capital city of the State of Queensland is the third
largest urban conurbation in Australia with a total population of
1,874,427 (ABS, 2011). Brisbane has proactively introduced strate-
gies and measures to encourage active transport, particularly to
increase cycling participation rates. While difficult to measure,
growth in population and employment particularly within the Cen-
tral Business District (CBD) alongside the improvement of cycling
infrastructure are claimed to be contributory factors towards the
increasing cycling share in the State (TMR, 2010). In 1986, the
cycling share in Brisbane was reported to be 0 per cent as a result
of largely non-existent cycling infrastructure (TMR, 2011). By 2006
75 kilometres of major cycling infrastructure had been built that
was reported to have contributed to observed increases in the
cycling share up from 2 to 7 per cent within the inner suburbs of
ations in Brisbane.



J. Corcoran et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 41 (2014) 292–305 295
Brisbane (TMR, 2011). There was also marked growth of cycling in
the suburbs of West End and St Lucia attributable to the opening of
the Eleanor Schonell Bridge, a transport facility which exclusively
caters to pedestrians, cyclists and public buses (Loader, 2014;
BCC, 2008).

In general, the journey-to-work cycling mode share has consis-
tently grown across all Australian cities since 1996. However,
while Australian Bureau of Statistics census data only capture
growth in absolute numbers of cyclists between 1996 (5719 per-
sons), 2001 (6788 persons), 2006 (7951 persons) and 2011
(10,425 persons) in Brisbane, the proportion of daily journeys to
work made by bicycle continues to be relatively low (Mees et al.,
2007; ABS, 2011). Moreover, relative to other international cities,
the overall cycling participation level in Brisbane as a proportion
of all trips remains behind best practice cities (for example,
Amsterdam, 27 per cent; Copenhagen, 29 per cent; Munich, 13
per cent) but is generally comparable to many US cities, including
Minneapolis (2.4 per cent) and Washington D.C (1.7 per cent)
(Pucher and Buehler, 2008).

The national, state and local governments have continued to
pursue strong targets and commitments to increase cycling partic-
ipation and active transport rates within Australia. These include
for example:

� The National Cycling Strategy 2011–16 that aims to double the
number of people cycling in Australia by 2016 (ABC, 2010).
� The Queensland Cycle Strategy 2011–2021 that aims to double

cycling share of commute trips to work by 2021 and tripling
cycling trips by 2031 (this target implies achieving a growth
to 2.8 per cent or 56,000 commuter cycle trips to be made per
day) (TMR, 2010).
� the Transport Plan for Brisbane 2008–2026 that targets an

increase in cycling trips from 2 per cent to 5 per cent by 2026
(BCC, 2008).

To document changes in cycling share, a bi-annual National
Cycling participation survey is conducted to monitor the number
of people cycling across Australia (ABC, 2013). The most recently
published survey reports that participation rates in Brisbane are
comparable to the national average (ABC, 2013). It further reports
that 15.8 per cent of residents ride a bicycle in a typical week. Also,
while cycling participation continues to be significantly higher
amongst males (21 per cent compared to 10.8 per cent female)
and young children (44.4 per cent of 2–9 year old children had rid-
den in the previous week) (ABC, 2013), there is also increasing evi-
dence of changing demographic structure as a result of
implementing both hard (i.e. expansion plans to bikeway infra-
structure to improve bikeway links and connections) and soft mea-
sures (for example, education and bicycle skills training programs
to encourage cycling) in Brisbane (ABC, 2013). Furthermore, after
more than two decades, cycling laws in Queensland are being
reviewed to acknowledge the potentially significant growth in
cycling within the State as well as to recognise the need to develop
new strategies to improve the interaction between cyclists, motor-
ists and other road users on Queensland’s roads and integration
within the transport network (THLGC, 2013). Such reviews are crit-
ical to ensure that regulatory frameworks are supportive of and
encourage active transport strategies such as cycling in general,
and PBSPs in particular.

3.2. CityCycle trip data

CityCycle, Brisbane’s self-service bicycle share scheme, was
launched in October 2010 and Brisbane was the second city in Aus-
tralia to adopt such a program after Melbourne. At present, the sys-
tem accommodates 150 docking station terminals distributed
across Brisbane’s city centre, stretching from the suburbs of New-
stead in the north to West End in the south and St Lucia in the west
(Fig. 1). Payment for the system is based on a per-trip usage fee
with the first 30 min being free of charge.

Disaggregate CityCycle trip data was drawn upon for a period
covering 20 months (November 2010 to July 2012) and comprised
a total of 285,714 trips. Each record contained the date and time of
the bicycle release and return station. Spatial information describ-
ing the location of each of the 150 bicycle stations was also pro-
vided. Some aggregation of the spatial unit of analysis (from the
individual bicycle to a larger unit) was required in order to
enhance our capacity to visually depict the complex spatio-tempo-
ral flows using the flow-comap. This was deemed necessary given
that the 150 CityCycle stations are located in relatively close prox-
imity (between 300 to 500 metres) to one another. The Australian
Bureau of Statistics State Suburb was used as the unit of analysis,
generating 16 areas for the analysis of system-wide patterns
(Fig. 1). Allied to this, and recognising the importance of investigat-
ing transport problems at a range of spatial scales (Tribby and
Zandbergen, 2012), we aggregate data to investigate usage pat-
terns. Here we perform a modelling exercise and draw on disaggre-
gate data to investigate flows at the finest spatial scale of the
individual station in a visual analysis using a subset of high use
stations.

3.3. Calendar events

A database of all major calendar events during the study period
was generated. The inclusion of specific dates or periods into a list
of events was guided principally by previous research such as
Brandenburg et al. (2007), and included all school and public holi-
day periods. School holidays (Department of Education, Training
and the Arts (DETA) 2013) covered adjacent weekends and pupil
free days but did not include non-adjacent weekends.

Calendar events were integrated into the CityCycle trip data via
simple database query assigning a value of 1 or 0 to the field of a
particular trip where its ‘date’ was equal to that of the calendar
event. A separate field for each calendar event was created. In
instances where a holiday (e.g. Christmas) fell on a weekend, then
the weekend was included in the holiday. The distribution of calen-
dar events included in the case study is shown in Fig. 2.

3.4. Weather

Data from a single weather station located central to the study
area were used (as indicated in Fig. 1). Data measurements
included temperature, rainfall and wind speed. Given its centrality
coupled with a relatively small study area (30 square kilometres), a
single weather station was deemed adequate to represent the
weather conditions experienced across the CityCycle network.
The data covered the same time period as the CityCycle database
and reported weather measurements as daily averages. The varia-
tion in weather variables used in the case study is depicted in
Fig. 2.
4. Method and results

The results are divided into three components. We first examine
the effect of calendar events and weather conditions to establish
the presence of system-wide associations. In other words, we
adopt an aggregate perspective across the CityCycle scheme to
examine whether particular calendar events or weather conditions
explain temporal variations in the number of trips. We next inves-
tigate spatio-temporal dynamics at the sub-system level (suburb-
to-suburb and station to station), employing the flow-comap to

usage.

4.1. System-wide associations

Here, system-wide associations between weather and calendar
events are considered. More specifically we examine whether par-
ticular calendar events or weather conditions (for example, a pub-
lic holiday), which we term event A, and the number of daily trips
taken during event A (denoted CA) are related to the number of
trips taken during all other periods (denoted as Cnot A). To assess
this relationship, it is necessary to count the number of times that
event A occurs, and similarly, the number of time that event A does
not occur. A natural assumption under these circumstances is that
there is a fixed infinitesimal probability that a CityCycle trip will
occur in a small interval of time, but there is also a very large num-
ber of such intervals. Under these circumstances the Poisson distri-
bution is appropriate to model the total number of daily trips.
Therefore, the distributions of CA and Cnot A are assumed to be Pois-
son and have the following form:

CA � PoissonðkAÞ and Cnot A � Poissonðknot AÞ ð1Þ

where kA and knot A are the rate parameters for the two Poisson dis-
tributions. A two sample Poisson test can then be performed under
the null hypothesis that kA = knot A. Similarly, a confidence interval
can be placed upon the ratio kA/knot A, which will be 1 if the two
Poisson distributions have the same rate.

First, investigating school holidays, Table 1 shows that the data
is consistent with the hypothesis that school holidays do not sig-
nificantly affect the number of trips. The estimated ratio is kschool
holiday/knon school holiday = 0.99, because the 95% confidence interval
for the same quantity is [0.83, 1.19].

Next, examining the effect of public holidays, Table 2 highlights
that there is also no evidence at the system-wide level of a signif-
icant change in the number of trips. Here, the estimated ratio is
kpublic holiday/knon public holiday = 0.87, the 95% confidence interval for
the same quantity being [0.62, 1.29].

Table 3 shows that in the case of rainfall there is a significant
effect of rain on the number of trips. The estimated ratio is krain/knon
rain = 0.69, because the 95% confidence interval for the same quan-
tity is [0.59, 0.82].
Similar to rainfall, wind speed was also shown to significantly
affect the number of trips (Table 4). The estimated ratio is kstrong
wind/klight wind = 0.83; the 95% confidence interval for the same
quantity is [0.71, 0.97].

Finally, the effect of temperature was examined where no sig-
nificant effects were revealed at the system-wide level (Table 5).
The estimated ratio is khigh temp/klow temp = 1.12, the 95% confidence
interval for the same quantity being [0.95, 1.31].

Next, we compute a multivariate regression model to capture
the simultaneous effect of weather conditions and calendar events
on the number of trips. Since the demand variable (number of
trips) is based on a count, it is assumed that the probability distri-
bution of the dependent variable is a non-negative integer such as
the Poisson distribution. Based on a variance-mean ratio of the trip
count data of 1.1 a Poisson model is fitted in which the number of
trips (captured as the average number of daily trips per station) is
encoded at the system-level over the 640 day period and combines
three dummy variables (i.e. weekend, public and school holiday)
representing calendar events in addition to the three weather vari-
ables (i.e. temperature, rainfall and wind speed). Temperature was
the only independent variable found to possess non-linear proper-
ties in its relationship to the dependent variable. Further examina-
tion highlights the presence of an inverted U-shaped relationship
with increases in bicycle trips from a base of 3 trips per station
during the coolest day (12 �C) rising to a peak of around 4 trips
per station where the average daily temperature is 20 �C. At tem-
peratures greater than 20 �C the mean number of trips per station

consistently lessens reaching a total of just over 3 trips per station

The analysis suggested that public holidays, weekends and to a
small extent warmer temperatures exerted a significant and posi-
tive effect on bicycle usage. Rainfall and higher wind speeds both
have a significant negative effect on bicycle usage. School holidays
were not found to impose a significant influence.

In summary, at the system-wide level statistically significant
effects were observed for rainfall and wind speed both as individ-
ual factors as well as when considered simultaneously with other
variables within the regression model. Temperature returned an
insignificant relationship as an individual factor, but exerted a
small but significant positive influence when modelled in alliance
with the other variables. This difference also existed for public hol-
idays. These disparities suggest that effects of temperature and

public holidays on usage are significant only when considering
each in combination with the other variables. Consistent in both
the independent analysis and regression model was the finding
that school holidays exerted no significant influence on usage.
We next graphically investigate the effects of both weather and
calendar events at the sub-system or suburb level before examin-
ing disaggregate (station to station) trip-level patterns.

4.2. Sub-system variations

The CityCycle dataset contains trip level information in the form
of an origin–destination matrix. The rows represent origin stations
and the columns destination stations along with individual counts
of transitions. This data, which contains both spatio-temporal
characteristics as well as movement information, is not easily ame-
nable to standard analysis methods, particularly in this multivari-
ate case where the difference in origin–destination matrices
conditional on other variables (for example, hour of day) is of inter-
est. Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) is a promising route
for considering complex problems such as this, and the case has
been made convincingly for ESDA elsewhere (see for example,
Haining et al., 1998; Anselin, 1999). However the specialised nat-
ure of our problem means that existing tools are of limited use. A
brief survey of widely used software packages highlights this diffi-
culty. Geographical Information Systems such as QGIS (Quantum
GIS. Development Team, 2012) or ArcGIS (Ver Hoef et al., 2001)
combine spatial databases with mapping software, but do not cur-
rently have well developed facilities for the analysis of movement
dynamics nor capacities to explore how these dynamics are
affected by other variables. Similarly, software environments for
statistical computing and graphics such as R (R Core Team, 2005)
provide a very flexible environment for data analysis and contain
advanced graphical tools such as the ggplot2 library (Wickham,
2009). While this package provides means of analysis of multivar-
iate data using conditional plots (coplots) or facet grids, it provides
only rudimentary mapping capabilities (e.g. see Section 5.7 of
Wickham (2009)) and no capability for the analysis of geographic
movement. Similar comments apply to the engineering and
numerical computing environment Matlab (Moler, 2008), which
provides a range of scientific programming and visualisation tools,
some of which can be used in a multivariate setting such as a
draftsman’s plot. Common to the previous issue this tool also pro-
vides little that is suitable for understanding origin–destination
matrix data and provides no mapping capabilities.

The flow map is a well-established cartographic technique. It
can assist in our understanding of origin–destination matrices by
mapping transitions between spatial units. Here, lines depicting
the transitions between spatial units are typically appended with
arrows to indicate flow direction and the width of the line is used
to indicate the flow volume. While the flow map can be used to
develop an understanding of origin–destination matrices, it does
not readily allow the incorporation of other variables such as
weather and calendar events as a component of the visual output.
In such circumstances, the analysis of bivariate spatial data can be
analysed using a technique termed the comap in which plots with
overlapping subsets of data are selected using non-spatial vari-
ables. These plots of raw data can be used to offer a sense of
how spatial relationships change conditional on one or more exter-
nal variables (for example, how bicycle trips vary spatially accord-
ing to how windy it was at the time particular trips were made).

Flow mapping, a visual analytical tool to depict spatial interac-
tion and movement, has a long history dating to 1869 when
Charles Minard first used the technique to depict Napoleon’s
army’s advancement towards Moscow (Minard, 1869). The devel-
opment of computerised flow mapping tools, however, only com-
menced in the late 1980s with Waldo Tobler’s flow mapper

program. This program was designed to visualise discrete node-to-
node movements (Glennon and Goodchild, 2005). Since then, a
number of significant efforts, particularly in computer science,
have been made to develop more advanced tools to visualise flow
information in various standalone applications (see for example,
Phan et al., 2008; Guo, 2009; Boyandin et al., 2010; Boyandin
et al., 2011).

In circumstances where there is a need to investigate the extent
to which the origin–destination matrix changes as a function of
other variables (for example, under certain weather conditions),
another technique is required that extends the current capabilities
of both flow mapping and the comap. To this end, we progress a
promising new technique, the flow-comap that is the product of
embedding the flow map into another spatial exploratory data
analysis technique, the comap.

The comap (Brunsdon, 2001) and its older, more generic cousin,
the coplot (Cleveland, 1994), provide an effective means of visual-
ising multivariate data in order to assist with uncovering previ-
ously hidden patterns embedded within complex data. The basic
idea is that a bivariate subset of raw data is selected based upon
some condition (for example, a defined range of rainfall or a cate-
gorical variable such as weekend or weekday). This data is then
plotted either in raw form in a scatter plot panel or a mapped ker-
nel density surface. The comap and coplot embrace the small mul-
tiple principle (Tufte, 1991) by using multiple panes of similar and
typically overlapping regions to illustrate how gradual changes can
be observed as a function of external variables.

Embedding the flow map into the comap to form a technique
we term the flow-comap, represents a straightforward extension
of the two techniques which allows multivariate exploration of ori-
gin–destination data which would not otherwise be readily possi-
ble. The current lack of a generic tool for the analysis of this type of
data suggests that there is the potential to develop such a tool with
a general purpose language such as C (Kernighan and Ritchie,
1988) or Java (Gosling, 2000). As this is likely to be a time consum-
ing exercise, a pilot project investigating the viability of such an
approach without full automation of the analysis seems prudent.
To this end, the flow-comap is generated through the repeated
(but time consuming) application of specialised software for the
analysis of movement dynamics, FlowMap (Guo, 2009).

4.2.1. Suburb to suburb variations
Fig. 3 depicts the spatial flows of CityCycle trips at the suburb

scale. The number of trips between suburbs is represented using
a variable line thickness, where the width of the line is propor-
tional to the total flow volume. The choropleth classification of
suburbs represents the within-suburb flows (i.e. where the bicycle
release and return are within the same suburb), with darker col-
ours representing higher numbers of internal trips.

Fig. 3 highlights that a high proportion of trips take place over
relatively short distances, along with a high degree of interaction
between adjacent suburbs. The number of trips appears to be
higher (but not concentrated) between the Brisbane Central Busi-
ness District (CBD) and the immediate surrounding suburbs, whilst
the trips between suburban locations are lower. In regards to self-
containment, a number of suburbs including New Farm (41 per
cent), Fortitude Valley (17 per cent), West End (26 per cent), South
Bank (25 per cent), and the CBD (38 per cent) exhibit relatively
high levels of within suburb trips. These results are expected given
that each of these suburbs contains high concentrations of urban
amenities that include parks, river-side bicycle paths, and public
transport links.

Fig. 4 displays the spatial flows over a 24-h period using a uni-
variate flow-comap. Following computations outlined in Bell et al.
(2002), the GINI and CV indexes are calculated for each of map
panel to quantify the relative spatial concentration of suburb-to-
suburb flows for a given time window. Results highlight that early
morning trips (between 5 am and 10 am) are more spatially dis-
persed. Later on in the morning and early afternoon (from between
10 am and 2 pm), trips tend to be more concentrated and spatially
focussed around the CBD and the immediate surrounding suburbs.
This spatial flow pattern continues until around 5 pm where after
(from 5 pm to 10 pm) trips begin to spread further into the suburbs
but appear less dispersed than during the morning peak hours.
There is also evidence that there is a relatively high proportion of
self-contained trips that remain comparatively constant across
the 24-h period within selected suburbs.

The simultaneous effects of specific calendar events (i.e. week-
days, weekends, public and school holidays) and hour on trip pat-
terns are shown using a bivariate flow-comap (Fig. 5). A number of
specific observations can be made. First, CBD-based trips taking
place during weekends, especially between the hours of 9 am to
5 pm are shown to be markedly less concentrated that those occur-
ring during workdays. Trips taking place during weekday evenings
(i.e. after 5 pm) show a significant reduction that is not as promi-
nent during weekends. The effect of public holidays on the spa-
tio-temporal patterns is very similar to weekend patterns. Trips
occurring during school holidays differ very little from regular
weekdays apart from a small reduction in the number of trips tak-
ing place between the suburbs and the CBD during peak hours.

Next, we simultaneously examine the relationship between
weather (i.e. rainfall, temperature and wind) and day of the week
on trip patterns using a bivariate flow-comap (Figs. 6A–6C).
Classifying each of the weather variables into two categories (for
example, with rainfall into dry and wet) permits the investigation
of the weather extremes on the location and timing of trips. Results
suggest that weather conditions influence the spatio-temporal
patterning of trips. A number of specific observations can be made.
First, there is clear evidence to suggest that rainfall affects trips,
especially during weekends, when there is a general system-wide
decrease in the number of trips taking place. That said, there are
a number of relatively short trips that persist during wet weather,
especially between and within West End, South Bank, New Farm
and Teneriffe. Wind was also shown to exert a notable impact on
tips for both weekdays and weekends in which strong winds (in
excess of 5.5 kilometres per hour) considerably reduced the num-
ber of longer distance trips. Compared with both rainfall and wind,
temperature appears to exert much less of an influence on trips
both during weekdays and weekends possibly highlighting the rel-
atively consistent year-round sub-tropical climate in Brisbane.

4.2.2. Station to station variations
Finally, we draw on the disaggregate data to investigate flows at

the finest spatial scale of the individual station. Given the lack of
visual clarity of the resulting flow-comap if we were to map all
flows, we focus on the most dominant interactions. To this end,
the twenty highest station-to-station trips (accounting for 7.4 per
cent of all trips) are mapped over a 24 h period (Fig. 7) to form a
disaggregate representation of the flow patterns depicted in Fig. 4.

The results highlight that the increased spatial dispersion expe-
rienced during the early morning trips (between 5 am and 10 am),
as observed in Fig. 4, appears to be largely driven by journeys to
destinations in one of seven of the CBD stations. These trips have
trip origins in one of the CBD’s surrounding suburbs including
New Farm, Fortitude Valley, South Brisbane and West End. Later
on in the morning and early afternoon (from between 9 am and
2 pm), the sharp increase in spatial concentration of trips captured
in Fig. 4 is clearly shown in Fig. 7. Specifically, the key driver of this
pattern is that more than half of the twenty highest usage trips
(52.2 per cent of trips) both begin and end at the same station com-

pared to 0 per cent between 5 am and 10 am. Between 1 pm and
5 pm the spatial concentration of trips lessens with only 28.3 per
cent of bicycle hires beginning and ending at the same station
alongside the emergence of a number of flows that differ in both
the specific stations involved and the direction of travel to those
of the early morning period. From 5 pm to 10 pm trips exhibit a

J. Corcoran et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 41 (2014) 292–305 301
similar spatial spread to the patterns observed during the early
morning period with a number of subtle differences in trip
patterns. During this time there is evidence of a reversal of the
early morning patterns with flows originating from the CBD to
the same destination stations in West End, South Brisbane, Forti-
tude Valley and New Farm Park that were origin stations in the
early morning period. In addition, there are new flows that emerge
at a select number of stations between Fortitude Valley and
Auchenflower and between Toowong and Milton.

In summary, Fig. 7 highlights that just under half of the City-
Cycle stations (47.3 per cent) are involved in the twenty most
dominant flows across an average 24 h period. The early morning
CBD centric trips are typically longer in distance and do not
appear to be mirrored in trips that take place in the late after-

noon/early evening. This suggests a tendency CityCycle to be used
for longer commute trips at either the beginning or end of the
day pointing towards users completing only one leg of their jour-
ney (i.e. either the inbound or outbound leg). Trips made during
the morning and early afternoon show higher proportions of cir-
cular trips (i.e. journeys that originate and end at the same
station), in particular at stations that are located within high con-
centrations of urban amenities, suggesting use for both leisure
(for example, riverside touring) and work-related transit to and
from meetings. To confirm each of these findings further data
describing both the individual users and trip purpose are now
required.

5. Discussion and conclusions

PBSPs have rapidly risen as a new alternative transport mode in
many cities worldwide. Despite their rapid growth, there has been
relatively limited research that has explored their underlying spa-
tio-temporal dynamics using trip level data. Developing an under-
standing of these complex dynamics is critical to compiling an
ongoing evidence base with the capacity to ensure the system is
configured in a manner that meets the needs of the users. In addi-
tion, this evidence base has the potential to offer prospective
insight into how the system might be reconfigured to better meet
the changing needs of the user base (e.g. by varying the spatial dis-
tribution of bicycles and bicycle stations). The data necessary to
establish such an evidence base already exists (albeit disparately)

in the form of disaggregate trip-level records (PBSP trips), the
meteorological office (weather data) and the State’s Department
of Education (calendar events). The challenge now for PBSP opera-
tors and researchers is to draw upon existing data, and where nec-
essary, develop new tools and techniques to examine these data in
a manner that has the potential to improve the use and uptake of
these systems worldwide.

The first step to developing this evidence base is the testing and
development of suitable tools with the capacity to quantify the
salient factors influencing the PBSP dynamics. This paper has
attempted to progress research in this area through the assembly
of a new integrated database and development of the flow-comap.
Results from our analysis highlight that at the system-wide level
rain and wind are both significantly related to the number of trips
taken. Stronger winds and rainfall significantly reduce the total
number of trips taking place. These findings concur with previous
studies that have examined the effect of weather conditions on
cycling (see for example, Nankervis, 1999; Brandenburg et al.,
2007; Parkin et al., 2008; Heinen et al., 2011) and suggested that
inclement weather conditions are significant detractors for both
recreational and commuting bicycle trips. Temperature was found
not to be a significant independent factor influencing the number
of trips taken, but when modelled simultaneously with other fac-
tors returned a significant and small positive influence on usage
concurring with existing studies including Brandenburg et al.
(2007). The small effect of temperature is not surprising given
the relatively small temperature variations experienced in Bris-
bane’s sub-tropical climate, which are quite unlike the weather
conditions reported in Brandenburg’s survey of Vienna-based
cyclists. Here, temperatures were reported to vary between below
minus 4 �C to in excess of 40 �C, which compare to a range of only
18 �C (comprising average daily low of 12 �C and top of 30 �C) in
Brisbane for the case study period. In regards to the effect of calen-
dar events, both public and school holidays were not found to exert
a significant influence at the system-wide level when considered as
independent factors but public holidays were found to exert a sig-
nificant positive effect when modelled with the other factors. The
result for school holidays differs from other studies on cycling
(for example, Brandenburg et al., 2007) which have suggested that
this type of calendar events helps to explain variations in both the
number of recreational and commuter bicycle trips resulting from
changes in the routine activities of individuals and families. A very
straightforward explanation for our result is that the minimum age
to hire a CityCycle is 17, which makes it difficult for families and
children to utilise the network during school holiday periods.

Examining the spatial flows in conjunction with weather condi-
tions highlighted that both rain and wind (specifically stronger
winds) reduce the frequency of trips taking place, and in particular
the longer trips. These findings align closely with existing research
(for example, Heinen et al., 2011) which suggests that cyclists have
limited capacity to protect themselves from inclement weather
when compared to other transport modes. Despite showing no
effect at the system-wide level, calendar events (in particular pub-
lic holidays) were shown to exert some subtle variation in the spa-
tial distribution of trips. The CBD experienced a reduction in the
number of trips to and from the immediately surrounding suburbs,
pointing to the adjustment in individuals’ routine activities during
holiday periods.

There are at least two areas that could form the basis for follow-
up research. First, based upon our case study presented in this
paper, we advocate the integration of the flow-comap as a tool
within a standard GIS environment. The various flow maps pro-
duced here have been generated individually using the ‘‘FlowMap’’
package (Guo, 2009) (one flow map at a time), and then integrated
into a final output using graphic design software. As mentioned
previously, this time consuming step is required because no cur-
rently available software is able to automate this type of analysis.
The effectiveness of this visualisation technique suggests, however
that the development of a GIS-based equivalent would greatly
facilitate their efficient generation. Embedded within this tool
should be the capacity to automate the generalization of the spatial
unit such that the user can readily adjust the unit of analysis. In
this case study, it was necessary to fix the spatial unit of analysis,
i.e. the suburb. However, a tool with the ability to adjust the spatial
unit to either smaller or larger units on-the-fly would greatly assist
in assessing the spatial scale and degree to which weather and cal-
endar events impact the spatio-temporal dynamics of the PBSP. A
second avenue for future research is concerned with broadening
the scope of this current study so as to assess different situational
and climatic contexts and to draw comparable data in order to
establish if the reported findings are replicated in other PBSPs
around the world.
