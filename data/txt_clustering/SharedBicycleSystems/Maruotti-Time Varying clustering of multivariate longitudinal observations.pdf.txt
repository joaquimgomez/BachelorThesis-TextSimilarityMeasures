Time-varying clustering of multivariate longitudinal observations

Abstract

We propose a statistical method for clustering of multivariate longitudinal data into homogeneous

groups. This method relies on a time-varying extension on the classical K-means algorithm, where a

multivariate vector autoregressive model is additionally assumed for modeling the evolution of clusters’

centroids over time. We base the inference on a least squares specification of the model and coordinate

descent algorithm. To illustrate our work, we consider a longitudinal dataset on human development.

Three variables are modeled, namely life expectancy, education and gross domestic product.

Keywords: Time-varying clustering; K-means; Longitudinal data; Human development index

1 Introduction

This paper considers estimation and inference in multivariate models for longitudinal data within a time-

varying clustering framework. Longitudinal data typically refer to data containing time-series observations

of a number of statistical units. Therefore, observations in longitudinal data involve at least two dimensions:

a cross-sectional dimension and a time-series dimension. There are at least three factors contributing to

the growth of longitudinal data studies: data availability (see, e.g. Wooldridge, 2002; Fitzmaurice et al.,

2008; Baltagi, 2009); greater capacity of modelling the complexity of phenomena under study than a single

cross-section or time-series data; challenging methods. Indeed, longitudinal data, by blending the inter-unit

differences and intra-unit dynamics, have several advantages over cross-sectional or time-series data. Con-

taining more variability than other types of data, longitudinal data improves the efficiency of statistical

estimates, by providing more accurate inference of model parameters. Moreover, more complicated behav-

ioral hypothesis can be constructed and tested, as well as the impact of latent variables can be controlled,

uncovering hidden dynamic relationships.

New challenges appear when analyzing longitudinal data within a clustering framework. Clustering

methods generally aim at partitioning units into meaningful clusters, measuring the homogeneity within

clusters as well as the difference between clusters. Standard clustering approaches have been considerably

improved, allowing for solutions to some practical issues such as the choice of the number of clusters, the

allocation to clusters and the clustering algorithm obtained. Several approaches have been developed in

model-based and non-model-based frameworks. In a model based framework, related to mixture modelling

techniques, examples aiming at clustering longitudinal data are of various nature (see e.g. De la Cruz-

Mesia et al., 2008; McNicholas and Murphy, 2010; Alfò and Maruotti, 2010, Maruotti, 2011; Komarek and

Komarkova, 2013; Ciampi et al., 2013). Fewer methodologies have been developed in a non-model-based

framework in the literature (D’Urso, 2004; Tarpey, 2007; Genolini and Falissard, 2010).

We would contribute to extend this branch of literature by introducing a new method to cluster multi-

variate longitudinal observations focusing on the evolution of partitions over time and taking into account

latent heterogeneity and time-dependence, simultaneously. In an univariate longitudinal setting, an attempt

at describing processes dynamics can be achieved by modeling the current value of the outcome as a weighted

linear sum of its previous values. This is an autoregressive process and is a very simple, yet effective, ap-

proach to account for time-dependence structure. However, in many applications the univariate setting may

be restrictive since only partially captures the inter-relationships among different aspects of the analyzed

phenomenon and, furthermore, it is less efficient than the multivariate approach whenever outcomes show a

certain degree of correlation. Thus, a multivariate model should be adopted. To account for the components

that need to be described by a model for multivariate longitudinal data, i.e. serial dependence that arise

due to the nature of repeated measurements over time and heterogeneity in the observed units, we propose

a multivariate vector autoregressive (MVAR) model in a clustering framework. MVAR is a flexible and easy

to use model for the analysis of dynamic multivariate time-series. We extend MVAR under a longitudinal

setting where multivariate time-series are observed for each unit of the longitudinal study with the aim of

describing the dynamic behavior and clustering the different time-series (other approaches in a time series

framework can be found in Coppi et al., 2010; Maharaj and D’Urso, 2011). The resulting model allows for

heterogeneity and dynamic clustering, modeled by a MVAR on the units’ partitions centroids. The proposed

approach has some potential advantages over competitive methods. It does not require any distributional

assumption within clusters. It is an interesting by-product when no prior information on the clustering

structure is available. A simple structured assumption regarding the shape of the clustering dynamics is

made. Robustness with respect to the computational burden involved in the estimation step and invariance

to time-scaling are other properties of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate the

trajectory of each cluster and cluster memberships are time-varying. The model parameters are estimated

via least squares (LS) by using a coordinate descent algorithm.

The proposal is illustrated on real data by analyzing a sample taken for the United Nations Development

Program (UNDP) database where life expectancy, education and GDP indexes used in the computation of the

human development index (HDI) are considered as response variables. Data are recorded for 143 Countries

over 9 years (from 1997 to 2005). The three dimensions in the HDI represent the minimum set of indicators

for assessing the aggregate level of human development. The HDI combines indicators of very different

sensitivity to change and as such it can hardly capture the short-term improvements: social indicators of

longevity and literacy (stock), strictly related to demographics; the slow social indicator on gross education

enrollment; the fast changing economic flow indicator on living standard. These three dimensions address

conceptually different aspects of human development, which although correlated do not predetermine one

another. We provide evidence of the usefulness of a multivariate approach and of the presence of a latent

time-varying structure. A clustering structure is identified corresponding to different levels of development,

as well as a dynamic process describing the evolution of human development.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce our approach for multivariate dynamic

classification, by specifying the adopted notation, by providing least square estimation and a model selection

criterion. In Section 3, we describe the data and analyze HDI components in a univariate and multivariate

setting by looking at clustering and time dependence. A final discussion follows in Section 4.

2 Partitioning longitudinal multivariate observations

2.1 Notation

For the convenience of the reader the notation and the terminology used is listed here.

n, J, T,G, P : number of units, variables, times, classes of units; number of lags of order of the VAR model.

X, E : (n× J × T ) three-way data and three-way array of error terms; where xijt (similarly for eijt) is the

value (error) of the j-th variable on the i-th unit at time t.

U = [uigt]: (n×G× T ), [U..1,U..2, . . . ,U..T ] binary matrix specifying a partition of the units U..t for each

time t, where uigt = 1 if the i-th unit belongs to class g at time t, uigt = 0 otherwise. Matrix U has

only one nonzero element per row.

X = [x̄gjt]: (G × J × T ), [X̄..1,X̄..2,. . . ,X̄..T ] matrix of centroids X̄..t for each time t including the G

class-conditional mean vectors x̄g.t in the J-space.

3



2.2 The model

The partition of the units over T times can be achieved by estimating the parameter matrices U..t and X̄..t

of the following model

xi.t = X̄
′

..tui.t + ei.t (1)

and rewritten in compact form

X..t = U..tX̄..t +E..t, t = 1, . . . , T. (2)

The dynamic evolution of a partition of units along time for each time can be modeled by considering

the following autoregressive VAR(P) model on the centroids of the partitions

x̄g.t = c+A1x̄g.t−1 +A2x̄g.t−2 + · · ·+AP x̄g.t−P +wg.t (3)

where c denotes a (J × 1) vector of constants, Ap is a (J × J) matrix of autoregressive coefficients for

p = 1, . . . , P . The (J × 1) vector wg.t is a white noise process such that E[wg.t] = 0, and

E[wg.t,wg.t′ ] =







Ω, t = t′

0, otherwise
.

Rewritten in compact form we have

X̄ ..t = 1Gc
′ + X̄ ..t−1A

′

1 + X̄ ..t−2A
′

2 + · · ·+ X̄ ..t−PA
′

P +W..t (4)

where W..t = [wg.p,wg.p+1, . . . ,wg.T ]

Now we are in position to specify the K-clustering autoregressive VAR(P) model for modeling the dynamic

evolution of the clusters. We include an AR(P) model as specified in equation (4) into the clustering model

(2). Formally,

X..t = 1Nc

where

D..t = U..tW..t +E..t

This model will be named CAR(K,P), i.e. K-clustering P-autoregressive model.

2.3 Least squares estimation

Let us start to consider the CAR(K,1) model. To evaluate the partition of the objects alongside, the AR(1)

is included in the partitioning model (2). Thus, we have

X..t = 1Nc
′ +U..tX̄..t−1A

′

1 +D..t, t = 2, . . . , T (6)

or in more compact form

X..t = U..t

1
+D..t, t = 2, . . . , T (7)

where B1 = [c,A1] and
˙̄X..t−1 = [1G, X̄..t−1].

The least-squares estimation of the model (6) can be obtained by solving

F (B1,U..t, X̄..t−1) =

subject to U being a binary and row-stochastic matrix.

Problem (8) can be solved by considering a coordinate descent algorithm (see Zangwill, 1969), which

updates parameters c,U..t
˙̄X..t−1A1 and decreases the loss function. Each matrix to be estimated is updated

while maintaining all the others fixed.

Thus, given Û..t and B̂1, the optimal X̄..t is specified solving a multivariate regression problem

uigt = 0, otherwise
(11)

For the general CAR(K,P) least square estimation, we can follow similar steps as for CAR(K,1) model.

Let us rewrite the CAR(K,P) model (5) in compact form.

X..t = U..t

P +D..t, t = 2, . . . , T (12)

where BP = [c,A1,A2, . . . ,AP ] and

The least square estimation can be given minimizing the quadratic function

Finally, given

(17)

2.4 Coordinate descent algorithm for CAR(K,P)

The coordinate descent algorithm alternates three steps starting from a set of random or rational partitions

U..t, t = 1, . . . , T.

Step 1: Update centroids
ˆ̄̇
X..t−P by (14).

Step 2: Update autoregressive coefficients BP by (16).

Step 3: Update partitions U..t by (17).

At each step, function (13) decreases or at least does not increase. Since (13) is bounded by below, the

algorithm stops to a solution when (13) decreases less than an arbitrary fixed constant. The solution is at

least a local minimum of the problem, thus, the researcher is advised to repeat the algorithm from different

initial solutions retaining the best one in order to increase the chance to find the global minimum of the

problem. To avoid local maxima, we run the algorithm 10 times, and retain the best solution on the basis of

the selection criterion described in the next subsection.

2.5 Model selection

Without a measure for model selection, it may be difficult to correctly assess model behavior and quality.

Here, the model selection is based on an internal criterion defined solely from the data that evaluates

each partition of the observations into groups through some function measuring adequacy of each partition.

Clustering criteria are often based on decomposition of the total variance of the data into the total within-

group variance and the total between-group variance. A natural criterion for the evaluation of a certain

partition is the amount of heterogeneity explained by the obtained partition. Thus, to chose the optimal

number of clusters , we use the Calinski and Harabasz criterion CH(G) (Calinski and Harabasz, 1974). The

CH(·) criterion combines the within and the between covariance matrices to evaluate the clustering quality.

The within covariance matrix is

W =

G
∑

g=1

T
∑

t=1

n
∑

i=1

(xi.tg − x̄g.t)(xitg − x̄g.t)
′

and the between covariance is

B =

G
∑

g=1

T
∑

t=1

ngt(x̄g.t − x̄..t)(x̄g.t − x̄..t)
′

where xi.tg collects data clustered in g at time t and ngt represents the number of units in cluster g at

time t. The optimal number of clusters corresponds to the value of G that maximizes

CH(G) =
trace(B)

trace(W )

n× T −G

G− 1

Its computation is very fast and, therefore, it is possible to run our method repeatedly with different

starting points and to use the solution with the largest value of CH(·).

3 Empirical application: the Human Development Index

3.1 Data description

The empirical application is derived from the analysis of the HDI for 143 Countries over 9 years (from

1997 to 2005). In 1990 the United Nations Development Programme introduced a new way of measuring

development by combining indicators into a composite development index, the HDI. The breakthrough for

the HDI was the creation of a single index which was to serve as a frame of reference for both social and

economic development. It is composed from statistics derived by life expectancy index (LEI), education

index (EI) and gross domestic product index (GDPI) collected at the national level. The HDI represents the

uniformly weighted sum of: the life expectancy (LE) at birth, measured as an index of population health

7



and longevity; the education, measured by the adult literacy rate (ALR, with 2/3 weighting) with gross

enrollment ratio (GER, with 1/3 weighting); the GDPI as a measure of standards of living given by the

GDP per capita at purchasing power parity. Each of HDI components is mapped onto a unit free index. In

detail, each HDI component is given by

Indexijt =
xijt −max(xijt)

max(xijt)−min(xijt)

HDI, although frequently used when synthesizing the degree of development of a Country, presents an

evident limit since it is built as a simple arithmetic mean of three social-economic indicators. Therefore, a

novel formulation of the HDI has been proposed in recent literature, characterized by a different definition of

its three components and presented by their geometric mean. Nevertheless, in this application we consider

the non-updated version of the index as an illustrative example. Furthermore, data refer to a period where

the old version of the HDI was applied. The proposed methodology can be straightforwardly applied to the

new version of the index.

However, studying and monitoring human development often involve the analysis of multivariate longi-

tudinal data, i.e. a number of different variables measured over time on a set of Countries. The growing

interest in human development has led to a substantial literature. One branch of this is concerned with syn-

thetic indexes designed to summarize a series of measurements and to provides easily interpretable results

for widespread dissemination (see e.g. Konya and Guisan, 2008; Nathan and Mishra, 2010). On the other

hand, synthetic index as HDI may fail to take into account certain aspects of development processes that

deserve particular attention. These include the association between indicators composing the HDI (for a

discussion on this topic see e.g. Cahill, 2005) and the serial dependence structure in the longitudinal data,

as well as the unobserved heterogeneity sources that typically arise in these studies. Due to these limitations

(for a critical review of the HDI see e.g. Sagar and Najam, 1998) a different approach should be pursued.

This dataset contains sufficient data to enable the determination of development patterns and changes

in Countries behaviors over time. We observe Countries for all 5 continents. The range of each time-series

varies considerably across Countries and over time. For example the overall median for LEI is 0.760 but

can rise 0.954 in some Countries (e.g Japan) and can show very low values, such as in Swaziland with a

value of 0.100. Similarly for EI and GDPI, we observe that in Western Countries both levels are quite high.

For the EI e.g. Australia, New Zeland, Denmark, Finland and Ireland reach a value of 0.993, while Bhutan

and Guinea show the lowest value at 0.330 with respect to a median value at 0.860. As expected, poor

Countries (most of Africans) show very low values for the GDPI, e.g. for Rwanda we observe 0.310, while

some economic developed Countries may reach a value of 1, e.g. Luxembourg, Norway, USA, Ireland, while

the median level is 0.680. Descriptive statistics (see Table 1) provide few insights but not exhaustive results.

A first step towards a more comprehensive analysis of human development index behavior may be provided

8



by a univariate or a multivariate analysis, highlighting the tendency of countries to develop similarities in

structures, processes and performances over time. Multimodality can be easily detected by looking at Figure

1.

3.2 Univariate analysis

In order to better understand the dynamics of indicators measuring human development and to check for

homogeneity within groups of countries, we first fit a univariate autoregressive model for the HDI. We aim

at identifying multiple behaviors. According to the model selection procedure described in Section 2.5,

we identify three groups of countries interpreted as different process describing the evolution of HDI. The

estimated distribution reveals the presence of under-developed, middle-developed and developed countries;

their evolution is easily shown by looking at the evolution of the centroids of each group over time (Table

2).

A clear and consistent pattern can be detected for groups’ centroids, which show an interesting evolution

over time. An increasing in the human development conditions is estimated; this can be considered as an

indicator of groups’ convergence toward better steady-states. We estimate an increment of the 11.29%,

6.00%, 4.41% in the HDI group-mean values for each of the three groups respectively.

Focusing on HDI convergence for the identified clusters, we notice dynamic cluster-specific processes, i.e.

clusters means move towards different steady-states. We are able to observe the implied transitions between

clusters, occurring when memberships change. As expected (see Table 3), a few transitions occur and it is

not possible to move from the developed to the under-developed cluster (and viceversa) from one year to

another.

3.3 Multivariate analysis

Up to now, we have discussed about the dynamics (evolution over time and heterogeneity) in a univariate

setting. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the human development issue, a multivariate analysis should

be pursued to provide further insights that univariate approaches cannot capture. Furthermore, it is clear

from Figure 2 that LEI, EI and GDPI are not independently distributed, necessitating a multivariate model

specification. Besides, when we face multivariate variables, the univariate approach is no longer sufficient and

needs to be extended. In this context, we are likely to face complex phenomena which can be characterized

by having a non-trivial correlation structure, and it is well known that, when responses are correlated, the

univariate approach is less efficient than the multivariate one (see e.g. Davidson and MacKinnon, 1993).

The first evidence concerns the number of identified clusters (see Table 4): four well-defined clusters can

be identified. Three of these are defined as before under-developed, middle-developed and developed; the

fourth one shows a mixed behavior which is completely missing in the univariate analysis. In this cluster, the

9



mixed-developed cluster, relatively small and time-decreasing values for the centroids are estimated for the

LEI, with a simultaneous increasing of EI and GDPI centroids (see Table 5). Time-dependence can be easily

detected by looking at the evolution of the centroids over time. A strong improvement in the estimated

centroids values is obtained for the under-developed countries: LEI passes from 0.4838 to 0.5975; EI from

0.4559 to 0.5420 and GDPI from 0.4333 to 0.5014. Similarly, middle-developed and developed countries show

an improved path for all the HDI components, even if such improvement is not dramatically relevant with

respect to LEI and EI, indicating that GDPI represents the primary focus for these countries. Indeed, it is

well-known that larger improvements from a low situation are more likely than improvements of the same

size starting from a higher level.

According to the marginal membership matrix, we classify 10.41% of countries in the mixed-developed

cluster, while 15.93%, 41.10% and 32.56% are clustered in the under-developed, middle-developed and de-

veloped clusters, respectively. As described in Section 2, we assign countries to components according to the

estimated matrix U. A graphical representation, which provides further insights on the obtained partitions,

is provided in Figures 3-4.

Given this partition, we observe the implied transitions between components. Transitions are relatively

rare during our sample period and a small number of countries account for most of them so that immobility

rather than mobility is the norm. Of the 1144 possible transitions only 30 occur (2.62 %; in line with the

results of Paap and van Dijk, 1998, in a similar context). 117 countries in our sample remain assigned to the

same component throughout the sample period. Of those that do transit from their initial component 22 shift

just once, and 4, i.e. Cameroon, Congo, Honduras and Kenya, shift more than once. Of the countries that

never leave their initial component, 41 are those initially classified as developed countries; while 10 (Costa

Rica, Croatia, Estonia, Honduras, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Oman, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia)

transit from the middle to the developed cluster. Bolivia and Nicaragua move from the mixed-developed

to the middle-developed cluster; while Cambodia, Congo, Ghana, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea worsen

their condition passing from the mixed-developed to the under-developed cluster. Kenya reaches the middle-

developed cluster after visiting the mixed-developed and the under-developed ones; similarly Honduras,

initially classified in the middle-developed cluster, moves in the mixed-developed cluster first and then, after

returning in the middle-developed cluster, to the developed one. The empirical transition probability matrix

is provided in Table 6.

4 Concluding remarks

In this paper, we presented a new clustering method, extending the well-known K-means algorithm, for the

analysis of multivariate longitudinal data. The computational burden is dealt with a least squares approach

10



through a coordinate descent algorithm. Although many clustering strategies have been introduced using

various perspectives, most of the proposed approaches rely on very simple association structures. Here, we

are able to distinguish and account for two different sources of association: true and apparent. In the former,

actual and future centroids are directly influenced by past values, which cause a substantial change over time

in the corresponding distribution. The latter case arises when statistical units are drawn from heterogeneous

populations. In the analysis of heterogeneous populations, ignoring time-related factors could produce a

misleading statistical finding, since this unobserved but persistent heterogeneity can be interpreted as due to

a strong serial dependence. In some sense, our approach is semi-parametric. It shares the classical features

of the K-means algorithm and, at the same time, a model-based structure is imposed on the evolution of the

clustering over time.

The considered approach provides new insight when applied to the human development index. Human

development is not the same and does not evolve in the same manner for all Countries. Furthermore, the

rate of development is different, as well as different steady state of development can be reached by groups

of Countries. The multivariate analysis provided in the empirical applications remarks the need of a more

complex analysis than the one provided by simply looking at descriptive indexes.

It seems to be worthwhile to investigate the possibility of extending this approach to more complex prob-

lems. The inclusion of a dimensionality reduction step in the estimation step is straightforward. Least squares

estimation allows us to include further independent covariates to estimate clusters centroids. Unbalanced

panels can be easily treated, slightly modifying the proposed approach.
