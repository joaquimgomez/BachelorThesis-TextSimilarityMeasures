A scalable framework for NBA player
and team comparisons using player
tracking data

Abstract. Player tracking data provides a platform for the creation of new basketball statistics that can dramatically improve
the ability to evaluate and compare player performance. However, the increasing size of this new data source presents
challenges in how to efficiently analyze the data and interpret findings. A scalable analytical framework is needed that can
effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the ability to compare player performance.

In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify four components accounting for 68% of the variation
in player tracking data from the 2013-2014 regular season. The most influential statistics on these new dimensions are used
to construct intuitive, practical interpretations. In this high variance, low dimensional space, comparisons across any or all
of the principal components are possible to evaluate characteristics that make players and teams similar or unique. A simple
measure of similarity between player or team statistical profiles based on the four principal components is also constructed.
The Statistical Diversity Index (SDI) allows for quick and intuitive comparisons using the entirety of the player tracking data.
As new statistics emerge, this framework is scalable as it can incorporate existing and new data sources by reconstructing
principal component dimensions and SDI for improved comparisons.

Using principal component scores and SDI, several use cases are presented for improved personnel management. Team
principal component scores are used to quickly profile and evaluate team performance, more specifically how New York’s
lack of ball movement negatively impacted success despite high average scoring efficiency as a team. SDI is used to identify
players across the NBA with the most similar statistical performances to specific players. All-Star Tony Parker and shooting
specialist Anthony Morrow are used as two examples and presented with in-depth comparisons to similar players using
principal component scores and player tracking statistics. This approach can be used in salary negotiations, free agency
acquisitions and trades, role player replacement, and more.

1. Introduction

The National Basketball Association (NBA)
launched a public database in September 2013
containing new statistics captured by STATS LLC
through their innovative sportVU player tracking
camera systems (NBA partners with Stats LLC for
tracking technology, 2013). The cameras capture and

record the location of players on the court as well
as the location of the ball, and the data are used to
derive statistics that expand greatly upon traditional
statistics available for analysis of basketball perfor-
mance. We can now break down shot attempts and
points by shot selection (e.g. driving shots, catch and
shoot shots, pull up shots), assess rebounding ability
for contested and uncontested boards, and look at new
statistics like average speed and distance and oppo-
nent field goal percentage at the rim. The availability
of such data enables fans and analysts to dig into the

data and uncover insights previously not possible due
to the limited nature of the data at hand.

For example, techniques to uncover different ‘posi-
tions’ based on grouping statistical profiles have
become increasingly popular. It reflects the mindset
of current NBA coaches and general managers who
are very much aware of the different types of players
beyond the five traditional roles. However, a recent
proposal (Alagappan, 2012) has received criticism
for its unintuitive groupings and inability to separate
out the impact of player talent (Haglund, 2012). The
NBA player tracking data has the ability to differenti-
ate player performance across more dimensions than
before (e.g. shot selection, possession time, physical
activity, etc.) which can provide better ways to evalu-
ate the uniqueness and similarities across NBA player
abilities and playing styles. Another example is in the
development of offensive and defensive ratings. Cur-
rent methods require an estimation of possessions and
other statistics to produce ratings (Oliver et al., 2007).
With the ability to track players’ time of possession
and proximity to players in possession of the ball
through player tracking, we can develop more accu-
rate representations of possessions and better player
offensive and defensive efficiency metrics.

However, the high dimensionality of this new data
source poses major challenges as it demands more
computational resources and reduces the ability to
easily analyze and interpret findings. We must find a
way to reduce the dimensionality of the data set while
retaining the ability to compare player performance.
One method that is particularly well-suited for this
application is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
which identifies the dimensions of the data contain-
ing the maximum variance in the data set. This article
applies PCA to the NBA player tracking data to dis-
cover four principal components that account for 68%
of the variability in the data for the 2013-2014 regular
season. These components are explored in detail by
examining the player tracking statistics that influence
them the most and where players and teams fall along
these new dimensions.

Additionally, a simple measure of similarity in
statistical profiles between players and teams based
on the principal components is proposed. The Sta-
tistical Diversity Index (SDI) can be calculated for
any pairwise player combination and provides a fast
and intuitive method for finding players with similar
statistical performances along any or all of the prin-
cipal component dimensions. This approach is also
advantageous from the standpoint of scalability. The
possibilities to derive new statistics from the player

tracking data are endless, so as new statistics emerge,
this approach can again be applied using the new
and existing data to reconstruct the principal com-
ponents and SDI for improved player evaluation and
comparisons.

Numerous applications in personnel management
exist for the use of SDI and principal component
scores in evaluating and comparing player and team
statistical performances. Two specific case studies are
presented to show how these tools can be used to
quickly identify players with similar statistical pro-
files to a certain player of interest for the purpose of
identifying less expensive, similarly skilled players
or finding suitable replacement options for a key role
player within the organization.

This article is organized as follows. Section
2 describes the player tracking data and data
processing. Section 3 provides the analysis and inter-
pretations for the four principal components in detail,
showing how players and teams can be compared
across these new dimensions. Section 4 introduces
the calculation for SDI and two case studies where
principal component scores and SDI are used to find
players with similar statistical profiles to All-Star
Tony Parker and role player Anthony Morrow for per-
sonnel management purposes. Section 5 concludes
the article with final remarks.

2. NBA player tracking data

2.1. Data description

Currently, there are over 90 new player tracking
statistics, and data for all 482 NBA players from the
2013-2014 regular season are available. Separate
records exist for players who played for different
teams throughout the season, including a record
for overall performance across all teams. Brief
descriptions of the newly available statistics adapted
from the NBA player tracking statistics website
(Player Tracking, 2016) are provided for reference
and will be helpful in better understanding the
analysis going forward.

Shooting
Traditional shooting statistics are now available for
different shot types:

�

Pull up shots - shots taken 10 feet away from
the basket where player takes 1 or more dribbles
prior to shooting



S. Bruce / A scalable framework for NBA player and team comparisons using player tracking data 109

�

Driving shots - shots taken where player starts
20 or more feet away from the basket and drib-
bles less than 10 feet away from the basket prior
to shooting

�

Catch and shoot shots - shots taken at least 10
feet away from the basket where player pos-
sessed the ball for less than 2 seconds and took
no dribbles prior to shooting

Assists
New assist categories are available that enhance
understanding of offensive contribution:

�

Assist opportunities - passes by a player to
another player who attempts a shot and if made
would be an assist

�

Secondary assists - passes by a player to another
player who receives an assist

�

Free throw assists - passes by a player to another
player who was fouled, missed the shot if shoot-
ing, and made at least one free throw

�

Points created by assists - points created by a
player through his assists

Touches
Location of possessions provides insight into style of
play and scoring efficiency:

�

Front court touches - touches on his team’s
offensive half of the court

�

Close touches - touches that originate within 12
feet of the basket excluding drives

�

Elbow touches - touches that originate within 5
feet of the edge of the lane and the free throw
line inside the 3-point line

�

Points per touch - points scored by a player per
touch

Rebounding
New rebounding statistics incorporate location and
proximity of opponents:

�

Contested rebound - rebounds where an oppo-
nent is within 3.5 feet of the rebound

�

Rebounding opportunity - when a player is
within 3.5 feet of a rebound

�

Rebounding percentage - rebounds over
rebounding opportunities

Rim Protection
When a player is within 5 feet of the basket and within
5 feet of the offensive shooter, opponents’ shooting
statistics are available to measure how well a player
can protect the basket.

Speed and Distance
Players’ average speeds and distances traveled per
game are also captured and broken out by offensive
and defensive plays.

2.2. Data processing

Only players who played at least half the 2013-
2014 regular season, 41 games, are included in this
analysis. This restriction is made to reduce the influ-
ence of player statistics derived from only a few
games played. Also fields containing season total
statistics and per game statistics are dropped from
the analysis since they could be influenced by number
of games and minutes played throughout the season.
Instead, per 48 minutes, per touch, and per shot statis-
tics are used. The final data set contains 360 player
records each containing 66 different player tracking
statistics.

3. Principal component analysis

With numerous player tracking statistics already
available and the potential to develop infinitely many
more, it is difficult to extract meaningful and intuitive
insights on player comparisons. Now that the data
are available for more granular and detailed compar-
isons, a methodology is needed that can analyze the
entirety of the data set to extract a handful of dimen-
sions for comparisons. These dimensions should be
constructed in a way that ensures optimality in dif-
ferentiating players (i.e. dimensions should retain
the maximum amount of player separability possi-
ble from the original data) and can be understood in
terms of the original statistics.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), devel-
oped by Karl Pearson (Pearson, 1901) and later
by Hotelling (Hotelling, 1933), is a particularly
well-suited statistical tool that can accomplish this
task through identifying uncorrelated linear com-
binations of player tracking statistics that contain
maximum variance. Interested readers can find a
brief technical introduction to PCA in Appendix A.
Components of high variance help us better dif-
ferentiate player performance in these directions
in hopes that the majority of the variance will be
contained in a small subset of components. This sim-
ple and intuitive approach to dimension reduction
provides a platform for player comparisons across
dimensions that best separate players by statisti-
cal performance and can be implemented without

expensive proprietary solutions, providing more vis-
ibility into how the method works at little to no
additional cost.

3.1. Dimension reduction

PCA is sensitive to different variable scalings in
the original data set such that variables with larger
variances may dominate the principal components if
not adjusted. To set every statistic on equal footing, all
statistics are standardized with mean 0 and variance
1 prior to conducting the analysis.

PCA is most useful when the majority of the total
variance across variables are captured by only a few of
the principal components, thus the dimension reduc-
tion. If this is the case for the NBA player tracking
data set, it means that we are able to retain the ability
to differentiate player performance without having
to operate in such a high dimensional space. Fig-
ure 1 shows the variance captured by each principal
component. Note the variance captured in the first
principal component is very high and decreases dras-
tically through the first four components. After that,
the change in variance is relatively flat, forming an
elbow shape in the plot. This means that the variances
captured by the fifth component onward are very sim-
ilar and much smaller than the first four components.
Moreover, the first four components capture 68% of
the variance across the original variables, so we uti-
lize these four components going forward to analyze
and compare player performance and playing styles.

3.2. Principal components

Each principal component (PC) is a linear combi-
nation of the original variables in the dataset. There
is a vector for each principal component containing
the coefficients associated with each of the variables
in the original data set and are called loading vectors.
These describe the influence of each variable for each
principal component and are used to interpret these
new dimensions in terms of the original variables.
Figure 2 plots the categorized loading coefficients
for the four principal components and is explored in
detail in the following sections. Variables can have
a positive or negative contribution to the principal
component. While the sign is arbitrary, understanding
which variables contribute positively or negatively
can help with interpreting the principal components.
The most important statistics for each component
are presented in the following sections, but tables
containing all loading coefficients for variables
contributing significantly to the principal compo-
nents are also available in Appendix B for more
details.

Each player can then be given a set of PC scores by
multiplying the standardized statistics by their corre-
sponding loading coefficients and then taking a sum
(see Appendix A for details). Figure 3 contains plots
of the PC scores for all players with a select few noted
for illustration. Using the loading and score plots
here, we can begin to understand and interpret what
these new dimensions are capturing and use them for
player comparisons.

3.2.1. PC 1: Inside vs. Outside
The first principal component accounts for the

most variation, 42% of the total variance. Table 1
lists statistics with highly positive and negative load-
ings for PC 1. Refer to Figure 2 for categorized PC
1 loadings for all statistics. These are used to bet-
ter understand the meaning of the scores along this
dimension. Players with positive scores for PC 1 are
able to secure rebounds of all kinds and are respon-
sible for defending the rim and close shots. Notable
examples are Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan,
and Omer Asik. Players with negative scores for PC
1 drive the basketball to the hoop and take pull up
and catch and shoot shots often, which implies they
tend to be outside players. These players also tend to
possess the ball more often and generate additional
offense through assists. Examples here are Stephen
Curry, Tony Parker, and Chris Paul.

3.2.2. PC 2: Assist and Drive vs. Catch and
Shoot

PC 2 accounts for another 12% of the total variance
and Table 2 lists statistics with highly positive and
negative loadings. Also refer to Figure 2 for catego-
rized PC 2 loading coefficients. Players with positive
PC 2 scores generate offense mainly through assists
and driving shots. These players tend to possess the
ball often and either kick the ball to teammates for
shot attempts or drive the ball to the basket. Many
point guards fall into this category with examples like
Ricky Rubio, Tony Parker, and Chris Paul. Players
with negative PC 2 scores provide offense primarily
through catch and shoot shots and are very efficient
scorers, especially from behind the 3-point arc. Pri-
mary examples are Klay Thompson, Kyle Korver, and
Anthony Morrow.

3.2.3. PC 3: Scoring and Rebounding Efficiency
vs. Speed

Table 3 lists statistics with highly positive and neg-
ative loadings for PC 3 which explains 9% of the total
variance. Also refer to Figure 2 for categorized PC 3
loading coefficients. Players with positive PC 3 scores
are extremely quick on both sides of the ball and cover
a lot of ground while on the court. Some examples are
Ish Smith, Shane Larkin, and Dennis Schroder. Play-
ers with negative PC 3 scores are largely responsible
for scoring when on the court and provide a signifi-
cant amount of offensive production per 48 minutes.
Scoring and rebounding efficiency characterize many
of the superstars in the NBA with players like Kevin
Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and LeBron James touting
highly negative PC 3 scores.

3.2.4. PC 4: Catch and Pass/Shoot vs. Slash
Table 4 lists statistics with highly positive and neg-

ative loadings for PC 4 which accounts for another
4% of the total variance. Also refer to Figure 2 for
categorized loading coefficients for PC 4. This com-
ponent is characterized by players’ tendencies when
they receive possession of the ball. Players with pos-
itive PC 4 scores tend to pass or convert catch and
shoot shots when the ball goes their way (e.g. Kevin
Love, Spencer Hawes, and Patty Mills) while players
with negative PC 4 scores tend to drive the ball and
score efficiently when they get touches (e.g. Tyreke
Evans, Rodney Stuckey, and Tony Wroten).

3.3. Team PC Scores

Not only can we characterize players by princi-
pal components, but teams can also be profiled along
these new dimensions as well. There are numerous
ways to aggregate the player PC scores to form a
team-level score, but here a simple weighted average
is used. The kth team PC score, tk(team), can be found
by taking an average of the kth PC scores across the
n players weighted by the minutes played throughout
the season, mi, i = 1, . . . , n.

similarities in team playing styles and how they
impact success.

For example, the New York Knicks had an
extremely negative PC 2 score. Further investiga-
tion shows it is partially the result of catch and shoot
offense from J.R. Smith, Andrea Bargnani, and Tim
Hardaway Jr. who were all in the top 50 in catch and
shoot points per 48 minutes. However, another major
factor is that 8 of the 12 New York players were below
average in passes per 48 minutes (average was 58
passes per 48 minutes) which is indicative of poor ball
movement. All-Star Carmelo Anthony is in this group
and has long been labeled a “ball hog” (Naessens,
2014) which is supported by his below average pass-
ing and above average number of touches and scoring.
In fact, Anthony’s top 10 performance in points
per 48 minutes, points per touch, and rebounding

efficiency helped earn his team the most negative PC
3 team average score. Note that team average PC 3
score is negatively correlated with winning percent-
age, yet the Knicks won only 37 games and failed to
make the playoffs.

To better understand how these team average PC
scores impact winning, Table 5 contains the results
from a multiple linear regression analysis on winning
percentage. Note that negative PC 3 scores are highly
correlated with winning while positive PC 2 and PC 4
scores are also highly correlated with winning. Neg-
ative PC 3 scores are associated with high average
scoring and rebounding efficiency. Referring back
to Tables 2 and 4, passes, touches, and assists con-
tribute positively to PC 2 and PC 4 scores. Regarding
New York’s lackluster season, it seems that Anthony’s
great offensive production was not enough to offset

the negative impact of extremely poor passing and
ball movement.

These results are better illustrated in Figure 5
where the regression-weighted sum of PC 2 and PC
4 scores (0.17∗[PC 2 Score] + 0.09∗[PC 4 Score])
determine the size of the points. Low average PC
3 scores (i.e. high average scoring and rebounding
efficiency) have the strongest influence on winning
percentages. However, controlling for PC 3 scores,
teams with higher regression-weighted PC 2 and PC
4 scores (i.e. higher average passing, touches, and
assisting) generally hold higher winning percentages.
This helps account for the success of the Spurs, who
distributed the scoring responsibilities more evenly
across the team, resulting in lower average scoring
efficiency and higher passing on average (9 of the 13
Spurs players were above the average 58 passes per
48 minutes).

4. Statistical Diversity Index (SDI)

Another way the PC scores can be used to com-
pare player statistical profiles is to combine them to

produce one measure of how different one player’s
statistical profile is from another. Here a simple calcu-
lation based on the sum of squared difference between
the two players’ four PC scores is proposed.

4.1. Calculation

For any two players, player i and player j, where
tk(i) represents the kth principal component score for
player i, the Statistical Diversity Index (SDI) can be
calculated as

SDIij =
4∑

k=1

A large SDI for two players indicates that their
statistical profiles are very different across the four
principal components defined above. Using this mea-
sure, we can develop lists of players that have
statistical profiles most similar to certain players
which has many applications in personnel manage-
ment.

4.2.1. Case Study 1: Tony Parker
For coaches and general managers that have a cer-

tain player in mind they would like to add to their
team, this measure can produce a list of players with
the most similar statistical profiles who may also be
good candidates to consider and might come at a
lower price tag. For example, Table 6 lists the five
players with the lowest SDI when compared with
Tony Parker, meaning they have similar PC scores
to Tony Parker, along with their 2013-2014 season
salary.

To better understand the additional value of the
player tracking data, PC scores and SDI can be
recalculated using only traditional statistics. This
approach identifies DeMar DeRozan as the most sim-
ilar player to Tony Parker although DeRozan and

Parker have an SDI of 75 using player tracking statis-
tics (89 other players have a lower SDI compared
to Tony Parker). To better explore the difference
between the comparisons using traditional and player
tracking statistics, DeRozan is included in the next set
of comparisons along with J.J. Barea and Brandon
Jennings from Table 6. See Fig. 6 for a comparison
of the PC scores and Table 7 for selected statistics for
these players.

DeRozan and Parker have similar point totals per
48 minutes, but Parker generates more driving points
compared to catch and shoot points while DeRozan is
more balanced. Additionally, DeRozan doesn’t match
the others in terms of assist categories, touches, and
passes. This helps explain why DeRozan’s PC 2 score
is much smaller than the others as catch and shoot
offense and lack of passing and assists contribute to
negative PC 2 scores. Shot type, touches, and passes
are key aspects of the player tracking statistics that

add value by improving player comparisons beyond
simple number of points and assists.

With player tracking statistics, J.J. Barea rises as a
less expensive option to Parker’s $12.5M salary who
had the most similar statistical performance to Parker
in the 2013-2014 season as measured by SDI. This
can be seen in the similarities among PC scores and
the selected statistics and shows how SDI can provide
a quick method for identifying similar players for
further detailed comparisons.

4.2.2. Case Study 2: Anthony Morrow
Another situation where SDI can be useful is in

finding suitable replacements for players who may
be considering free agency. Finding candidates who
can play a similar role in the organization can be
difficult, but SDI can help identify candidates who
may be more prepared to step into a specific role
that needs to be filled. For example, Anthony Mor-
row left the Pelicans through free agency after the
2013-2014 season to join the Thunder who offered
Morrow $3.2M for 2014-2015 compared to the
$1.15M under his contract with the Pelicans (Hogan,
2014). Using SDI, the Pelicans can find players
similarly suited to replace Morrow’s shooting abil-
ity at 54% effective shooting percentage and 60%
catch and shoot effective shooting percentage (see
Table 8).

Figure 7 shows that these players are very sim-
ilar in terms of the first two PC scores with slight
differences in PC 3 and 4. Based on the interpretation

of the PC dimensions previously covered, these play-
ers generally produce offense through outside catch
and shoot shots (negative PC 1 and 2 scores), but they
vary more in shooting efficiency and passing (PC 3
and 4 scores). See Table 9.

In terms of catch and shoot points per 48 minutes,
all of these players including Morrow are in the top 20
with the exception of Hardaway Jr. at 34th. However,
you can see the differences among the players in terms
of points per touch and passes which impact PC 3 and
4 scores. As SDI increases, the similarity between the
players and Morrow’s points per touch and passes
begin to break down. The Pelicans could use SDI
not only to identify suitable replacements to pursue

in the offseason but also to estimate the salary of
comparable players for use in salary negotiations.

5. Discussion and further remarks

This article explores the utility of the newly avail-
able NBA player tracking data in evaluating and
comparing player and team abilities and playing
styles through their statistical profiles. Using PCA,
we identify and interpret four principal components
that capture over 68% of the variance in the NBA
player tracking data set and compare players along
these new dimensions. A simple measure of com-
parison between two players or teams based on
principal component scores, SDI, is also introduced.
This framework is scalable as it can incorporate exist-
ing and new statistics that will emerge to reconstruct
the principal component dimensions and SDI for
improved comparisons.

SDI and the principal component scores can be
used by head coaches and general managers to eval-
uate team performance and personnel needs and also
for quickly identifying players with similar statisti-
cal profiles to a certain player of interest for use in

numerous personnel management applications (e.g.
salary negotiations, free agency acquisitions, replace-
ment options for key role players, etc.). This approach
is advantageous as it allows for use of the entirety
of the available data for finding suitable compar-
isons across the NBA quickly along with principal
component scores to help understand why players
are deemed similar statistically. This can serve as
a starting point for more detailed comparisons by
considerably narrowing down the number of players
under consideration.

This work could be extended by incorporating new
data from the 2014-2015 season to see if principal
component dimensions and player principal compo-
nent scores change significantly from one season to
another. This would also provide additional data for
players who didn’t see much playing time in the
2013-2014 season. Additionally, player tracking data
at the game level could greatly extend this analysis
by tracking how players’ statistical profiles change
throughout the course of the season.

Appendix

A. Brief Introduction to Principal Components
Analysis

The method can be formulated (Jolliffe, 2002) as
an orthogonal linear transformation of the data into
a new coordinate system such that the first direc-
tion (first principal component) contains the greatest
variance in the data, the second direction (second
principal component) contains the second greatest
variance, etc. Consider a data matrix Xnxp whose
n rows represent observations each with p different
variables of interest. We define a set of px1 load-
ing vectors, w(k), k = 1, . . . , p that map each row of
observations in Xnxp, call it x(i), i = 1, . . . , n to a
new vector of principal component scores, call it t(i)
such that tk(i) = x(i) ∗ w(k). We can find the loading
vector for the first principal component as w(1) such
that the variance of the corresponding principal com-
ponent scores t1(i) is maximized and w(1) is of unit
length, which can be expressed as:

w(1) = argmax
wT XT Xw

wT w
The remaining principal component loading vectors
can be found in a similar fashion. To find the kth
component, subtract the first k–1 components from
X:

X̂k = X −
k−1∑

s=1
Xw(s)w

T
(s)

Then use the same variance maximization method on
the new matrix X̂k to find the kth component:

w(k) = argmax
wT X̂T

k
X̂kw

wT w
Principal component analysis can also be viewed
as the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance
matrix where the eigenvectors are the principal
components as stated above. There are numerous
resources available for explaining the methodology
in more detail, but a basic understanding as outlined
above should suffice for this article.
