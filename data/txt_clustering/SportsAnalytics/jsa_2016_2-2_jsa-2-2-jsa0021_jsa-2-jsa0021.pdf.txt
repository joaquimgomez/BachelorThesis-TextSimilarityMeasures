When do soccer players peak? A note

Abstract. The peak age for professional soccer players is of significant interest to coaches, managers and executives alike. The
evidence so far is predominantly anecdotal and subjective. This paper formally analyzes the peak or optimal age in professional
men’s soccer using performance ratings of players in the four major top flight leagues of Europe. WhoScored.com ratings from
2010/11 to 2014/15 are used. The analysis is done for all outfield players, separately by field position. In addition to simple
age distribution and bivariate approaches, a player fixed effects model that accounts for potential selection bias is estimated.
The results show that the average professional soccer player peaks between the ages of 25 and 27. In the preferred models,
the average forward peaks at 25, whereas the typical defender peaks at 27. For midfielders, the estimated peak age varies
by model but still occurs in the 25–27 age band. Defenders experience relatively minimal curvature in the age-performance
relationship. Further results show that peak age may vary directly with ability.

Keywords: Age-performance relationship, aging curve, peak age, optimal age, soccer

1. Introduction

For several years, the Premier League soccer club
Arsenal has had an unofficial policy of offering play-
ers over the age of 30 only a one-year contract
extension. The policy was largely driven by their
astute manager, Arsene Wenger, and his view that by
age 30, a soccer player is well past his peak (Kuper
and Szymanski, 2009). This view and the contract
policy have baffled many of his players. Observers
have also pointed out that the policy is partly to blame
for a few of the club’s most influential players leaving,
at the peak of their powers when nearing 30, looking
for better and longer contracts elsewhere. For them,
a strict cut-off such as 30 years of age is too rigid. It
also ignores evidence – after all, the club and man-
ager have witnessed stellar performances from “over
age” players whose services were retained, especially
during the early days of the manager’s tenure (for a
recent example, see Hytner, 2014).

The club has since softened its stance somewhat
(Jackson, 2010; James, 2014). However, at the heart

of the discussion here is the question of peak or opti-
mal age: ‘Given a measure of performance, when
do professional soccer players in the men’s game
typically achieve peak or maximum performance?’
Conventional wisdom has it that the average player
peaks in his mid to late 20 s. This is largely based on
anecdotal evidence and views of professionals in the
game. In his early days at Arsenal, Wenger reportedly
held the view that a professional player is finished
physically after age 30 (Rees, 2003). More recently
he said that the optimum or peak age is between 23
and 30, while admitting that exceptional fitness of
the modern player and the value of experience in the
modern game imply clubs need to retain a few over
30 players in their squad (James, 2014).

Others have spoken similarly about peak age for
soccer players. Alex Ferguson, the legendary former
manager of Manchester United, has intimated that
players peak in the band of 24 to 28 years of age
(Ferguson, 2013). Former and current players gen-
erally agree. Paul Scholes, a former player of Alex
Ferguson’s, has spoken of the ‘normal’ peak for play-
ers occurring at age 28 or 29 (Ducker, 2014). Very
recently, Samir Nasri, a current player for Manch-
ester City noted that a midfielder is in his prime at
27–31 or 28 –32 (Jackson, 2014).

90 S. Dendir / When do soccer players peak? a note

Our research could not uncover any systematic,
published study that examines peak age in profes-
sional soccer. Most of the semi-formal evidence
comes in the form of short newspaper articles and
blog posts. The World Cup and the role of average
squad age in winning it has been fertile ground for
discussion. The average age of the 32 teams that par-
ticipated in the most recent world cup was 27.5 years.
The BBC’s Ben Carter notes that this is “historically
the perfect age to be a player in the World Cup” since
it also happens to be the mean age of the winning
teams in the 19 prior World Cups (Carter, 2014). The
Economist also analyzed the impact of average age
of squad on performance of defending World Cup
champions, a relativelyhomogenousgroup in termsof
overall quality. Although the analysis was not focused
ondeterminingpeakageperse, it foundthataone-year
increase in average squad age results in a four-place
drop in performance (The Economist, 2014).

Of course a month-long tournament is different
from a regular league season that typically spans 10
months and, likely, so are the determinants of perfor-
mance. Analyzing data on players featuring regularly
in seven of the world’s elite clubs, Simon Kuper con-
cluded that the average player enters his peak between
the ages of 23 and 25. Attackers tend to peak ear-
lier than defenders but, interestingly, he also argues
peak performance can last a while, until about age 31
(Kuper, 2011). This optimal age range of the mid to
late 20 s, he notes, matches up well with the range
in other sports as well, such as professional basket-
ball, baseball and even tennis. Caley (2013) analyzed
minutes played in the Premier League as a proxy
for performance and concluded that peak age likely
occurs between the ages of 24 and 28, with attack-
ing players likely to peak at 25-26. Using a similar
approach, Gleave (2015) labels players into three
age categories: Talents (younger than 24), peak age
(24–29) and veterans (older than 29).

Alternatively, to the extent that a player’s transfer
value is a good proxy for his ability and perfor-
mance, one way to gauge optimal age is by estimating
whentransfermarketvaluepeaks.ChrisAndersonand
David Sally, writing on their blog, Soccer by the Num-
bers, analyzed transfer market value of all players in
the Premier League in October 2012 using regression
analysis.Theirresultsshowedthataninverted-Ucurve
characterizes the relationship between market valu-
ation and age, with peak value occurring at age 26
(Anderson and Sally, 2012).

There are several reasons why, for analysts, the
age-performance profile of players may be difficult

to map, possibly explaining the dearth of systematic
evidence on the issue. As noted by many observers,
soccer is the quintessential team game that lacks
clearandquantifiabledimensionsof individualperfor-
mance,whichare typicallypresent inother sports such
as baseball, tennis or even basketball (Anderson and
Sally, 2013; Simmons, 2007). In essence, a player’s
performance could very much ebb and flow with that
of other players on the team, a fact that introduces
too many unknowns into the estimation of individ-
ual profiles. Second, whereas clubs track data on
some measures of physical performance (e.g. speed,
stamina, etc.) from training and matches, these data
historically have been proprietary, and are typically
used to make game-by-game decisions by managers.
In recent years match-day data on these and other vari-
ables are becoming increasingly available for analysts
and the public, but the extent to which they can be
aggregated and utilized to measure longer-term per-
formance by players is yet to be seen.

Knowledge of optimal age in soccer is intrinsi-
cally valuable from the perspective of performance
analysis. However, it also has significant value for
the business of soccer. As illustrated above, clubs’
perception of when players peak can affect various
personnel decisions, from the kind of contract they
offer a player to the fee they are willing to pay (or
accept) for a transfer. Player contract is especially
important in soccer because, unlike in other sports
(e.g. in the National Football League), it is often guar-
anteed. It is also shown to more closely track, relative
to other team sports, a player’s contribution to the
team, particularly for a first team player (Simmons
and Forrest, 2004; Simmons, 2007). In an industry
where the wage to revenue ratio typically pushes the
70% mark – players are a major asset a club possesses
– whether a player is ‘on the up’ or ‘over the hill’ is
an extremely valuable piece of insight for managers
and executives alike.

This paper aims to shed light on the optimal
or peak age in professional soccer. For the anal-
ysis, it uses performance ratings of players who
played in the top four European leagues during the
last five seasons, 2010-11 to 2014-15. The ratings
come from WhoScored.com, the influential website
whose detailed statistics and ratings are widely used
by analysts and contributors to various media out-
lets. The estimation exercise adopts a panel fixed
effects model, which utilizes the longitudinal vari-
ation in age and performance to determine optimal
age. Separate models are estimated for each outfield
position (defence, midfield and forward). Additional

robustness exercises estimate individualized age-
performance curves and test for potential variation
in peak age by ability.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
next section describes the data. Section 3 presents
preliminary estimates of peak age using distributional
and bivariate methods. Section 4 discusses the main
fixed effects model and results. Further results are
presented in Section 5. Section 6 contextualizes the
results in the broader literature on age and perfor-
mance in sports and the final section concludes.

2. Data

The data for the study come from the increasingly
influential soccer statistics website WhoScored.com.
For the top leagues around the world, the site obtains
its raw statistics from Opta and presents them in an
accessible, publicly available platform. The analysis
in this paper employs data from the four major Euro-
pean top flight leagues – the Bungesliga (Germany),
Premier League (England), Serie A (Italy) and La
Liga (Spain). We use data from the last five seasons,
2010/11 through 2014/15.

The main indicator of performance is players’
WhoScored.com rating. WhoScored.com gives a rat-
ing out of 10 points for every player in a match on
the basis of each recorded event using a computer
algorithm. Here is how WhoScored.com describes
the rating system:

“Whoscored.com Ratings are based on a unique,
comprehensive statistical algorithm, calculated
live during the game. There are over 200
raw statistics included in the calculation of a
player’s/team’s rating, weighted according to
their influence within the game. Every event
of importance is taken into account, with a
positive or negative effect on ratings weighted
in relation to its area on the pitch and its
outcome. An Example: An attempted dribble
(event) in the opposition’s final third (area
of the pitch) that is successful (outcome) will
have a positive effect on a player’s rating.”
(www.whoscored.com/Explanations)

According to the ratings scale, a rating of 6.0–6.9
is considered “Average”, whereas 7.0–7.9, 8.0–8.9
and 9 or above are respectively classified as “Good”,
“Very Good” and “Excellent”. Ratings of 5.9 or less
are labeled “Poor” to “Extremely Poor” depending
on the specific value. WhoScored.com states that its

ratings are received as “the most accurate, respected
and well-known performance indicators in the world
of football”, increasingly being used by clubs, the
media and bookmakers. While ratings are updated
live during a match, the final rating is determined after
full time, taking into account match outcomes and any
necessary adjustments and corrections in statistics.

The use of an algorithmic rating such as
WhoScored.com’s for measuring performance is a
strong suit of the paper. First, as noted the rating gives
a composite measure of performance, taking into
account all contributions, positive and negative, of
a player. It can be argued that no other single statistic
commonly reported in the sport sufficiently captures
overall performance, even for a homogenous group of
players. For example, forwards are often assessed by
goals and assists, but these statistics miss other impor-
tant facets of a forward’s contributions, such as link
or hold-up play or dribbles into danger areas. Lack of
an adequate proxy for performance is even more of
an issue for defenders and, particularly, midfielders
whose roles are intrinsically multi-faceted. Second,
although the weighting of outcomes underlying an
algorithm inevitably involves some value judgment,
the overall rating itself is objective in the sense that it
is applied consistently across players and over time.

More specifically, in this paper we adopt a player’s
season-average WhoScored.com rating (WS rating)
as the main measure of performance. We prefer aver-
age rating because it likely smoothes out fluctuations
in performance that occur during the course of a sea-
son – due to individual and team form, injury, luck,
and various other factors – and thereby gives a truer
measure of sustained performance.

Age is measured by player’s age as of January
15, approximately the mid-season mark for a typi-
cal league. It is thus measured on a continuous scale.
For instance, a player born on October 26, 1984 is
28.2 years of age in the 2012-13 season. In instances
where age will be treated as a discrete or categori-
cal variable, the computed age is rounded off to the
nearest whole number.

The initial sample consisted of all outfield players
in the four leagues who registered positive minutes in
any of the five seasons under consideration. The data
are stacked in panel form (each player across years).
Players are then classified into three groups based
on their field position: Forwards, Midfielders and
Defenders. We exclude observations (player-year)
with less than 270 minutes of total playing time dur-
ing a season (roughly the equivalent of 3 full games).
This is done to minimize potential bias arising from

including fringe players who nonetheless receive a
rating. For example, a player that is just breaking
through sometimes shines – and receives a high rating
– with minimal minutes, but it is difficult to assume
he would maintain that level of performance over
extended playing time over a season. The threshold of
270 minutes provided an acceptable balance between
the competing goals of removing outlier observations
and minimizing the loss of unduly large number of
observations. We also dropped entries when a player
is younger than 18 (after rounding off) or older than
38. It is reasonable to assume that those who manage
to play sustained minutes in a competitive European
league at these ages are outliers.1

After these constructions, the final sample con-
sisted of 7968 observations on 3102 players. The
breakdown comprised of 1721 observations in the
sample for forwards, 2779 for midfielders and 3468
for defenders. The panel data for each group was
unbalanced because not all players had entries for
each of the five seasons. Table 1 presents summary
statistics on WS rating and age for each group.

3. Preliminary evidence

Before we present and estimate a formal statistical
model of the age-performance relationship, we begin
with two relatively simple methods of identifying
peak age: Age distribution and bivariate analyses.

3.1. Age distribution

Arguably the most straightforward method of
determining age of peak performance is to plot the

1270 minutes represents roughly the 26th, 24th and 14th per-
centiles, respectively, in the minutes distribution of the original
sample of forwards, midfielders and defenders. The age restriction
then ruled out only 9 player-year observations – 6 defenders and 3
midfielders.

players’ age distribution and find the modal age. The
premise is simple: If most players, including those
with marginal ability, play professionally when they
are at their highest performance level, then the modal
age – the age at which most players participate – also
happens to be the peak age.

Figures 1a to 1c present the histogram age distri-
bution for forwards, midfielders and defenders. The
modal age for forwards happens at 26. But near peak
frequencies – contributions of 8 percent or above –
are observed 2 years either side of the peak. There
is a substantial drop-off at 29, albeit followed by a
slight recovery at 30. Midfielders realize a very sim-
ilar pattern as forwards – a peak at 26 and near peak
frequencies between 24 and 28. The percentage con-
tribution to the age distribution in these years ranges
from 8.28 to 10. But the decline in participation after
the drop-off at 29 is more uniform for midfielders.
Defenders, meanwhile, have their modal age a year
later, at 27, and near peak frequencies for a longer
period (24–29 years). The decline later on is also vis-
ibly more gradual. In sum, based on modal age alone,
one can conclude that forwards and midfielders share
the same peak age (26) and “peak range” (24–28),
whereas defenders peak a year later and perform close
to near-peak levels for longer as well.

3.2. Bivariate approaches

Bivariate approaches to estimating peak age sim-
ply plot a measure of performance against age. Two
types of bivariate analysis are employed here. In the
first playing time is used to proxy performance. The
second uses WS rating.

3.2.1. Playing time versus age
The use of playing time as a proxy for performance

follows a similar logic. If, at any given time, coaches
or managers pick players purely on the basis of per-
formance, then the players who are given the most
minutes are the best performers. The age at which
the most minutes are registered is thus the peak age.

Figures 2a to 2c plot the ratio of total minutes by
age for forwards, midfielders and defenders, respec-
tively. Age is again rounded off to the nearest integer
and the ratio for a given age is calculated by divid-
ing the total minutes of players of that age by the
total minutes of all players. For example, for 23 year-
old forwards, the ratio represents the minutes played
by all 23 year-old forwards to total minutes played
by all forwards. In addition to the simple plot, the

best cubic fit line is also shown.2 In all figures a ver-
tical reference line is inserted at age 25 for easier
visualization.

As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the minutes ratio for
forwards peaks at age 27. However, near-peak ratios,
again conveniently defined as contributions of 8 per-
cent or more, are observed between the ages of 24 and
28. In Fig. 2b, the peak for midfielders happens earlier
– at 26 – but they again share the same “peak range”
as forwards. Interestingly, the plot for midfielders has
a sharper peak, signifying that during the peak years,
midfielders are given a relatively higher proportion of
playing time than forwards. Finally, defenders realize
the literal peak in minutes at 27 years of age while
their “peak range” extends from 24 to 29. In sum,

2For each group, two regressions were estimated: The ratio of
minutes on a quadratic and a cubic polynomial of age and, when
feasible, the better fit of the two is chosen. Better fit was determined
by the significance of the cubic term and goodness-of-fit measures.
For all three groups, the cubic specification was found to be the
better fit.

except for the later peak age of forwards, the results
of the bivariate ‘minutes versus age’ analysis mir-
ror those from the simple/univariate age distribution
above.

3.2.2. Mean WS rating versus age
Another routinely used method defines peak age as

the one when average performance, computed over
the available sample, is highest. Accordingly, we cal-
culate mean WS rating by age, for ages 18 to 38.
Figures 3a to 3c plot average performance by age
for forwards, midfielders and defenders, respectively.
When possible, the best quadratic or cubic fit line is
also shown.

According to this method, forwards technically
peak at age 27 – that is when computed average per-
formance is highest – but they maintain near peak
performance roughly from 21 to 30. A cubic func-
tion fits the average rating – age relationship best
with a highly significant cubic term and R2 of 0.82.
The predicted peak age from the cubic fit is 25

years. Midfielders meanwhile hit the literal peak at 29
years, although near peak performance, even when
conservatively defined as average WS rating of 6.8
or higher, persists from 24 to 31 years of age. A
quadratic polynomial best fits the data for midfield-
ers (R2 = 0.80, insignificant cubic polynomial) and
the predicted peak age is also 29. For Defenders,
however, the bivariate approach fails to show any
discernible pattern of improvement and decline in
performance in the normal career years (Fig. 3c). A
regression of average performance on age yields sta-
tistically insignificant estimates whether in a cubic or
quadratic polynomial.

This result, as well as a careful look at the implied
average performance of forwards and midfielders dur-
ing the early and late career years in Figs. 3a and 3b,
shows why this approach is sometimes called Naïve
(Brander et al., 2014). It suffers from the problem of
selection bias. Entry and exit from professional sports

is non-random. Very good players start earlier and quit
later than average or weak players. This means aver-
age computed performances during the early and later
career years are biased upward due to the prevalence
of players of very high ability in the sample. In turn,
this dulls the age-performance curvature – that is, it
masks the improvement and decline in performance
in the pre- and post-peak years, respectively.

In summary, the age distribution and bivariate
approaches, while simple to implement and infor-
mative, can in fact lead to biased estimates of the
age-performance curve and peak age. Age distribu-
tion can be unduly influenced by marginal players
that feature in the game at their peak only. Playing
time as a proxy strongly rests on the assumption that
no other factor plays a role in player selection and
minutes played (e.g. it assumes there is no so-called
veteran bias). Mean rating, as noted, typically suffers
from selection bias.

4. Modeling the age-performance relationship:
Player fixed effects estimation

An exercise in modeling the age-performance
relationship and the estimation of peak age should
therefore use an actual measure of performance and
alsoadequatelyaddress theproblemofpotentialselec-
tion bias. Since selection bias primarily stems from
unobservable differences among players, such as dif-
ferences in [innate] ability, addressing it requires a
model that accounts for player heterogeneity.

In this paper we utilize the longitudinal dimension
of the data and estimate a panel model of the form:

WSit = f (Ageit) + ∝i +εit (1)
whereWSit is WhoScored.com rating of player i in
season t (t = 2010/11 through 2014/15), Ageit is the
player’s age, ∝i is a player-specific effect, and εit is
a player-season random error. ∝i, which stays con-
stant across seasons, captures player heterogeneity.
Depending on whether or not it is assumed to be cor-
related with other exogenous variables in the model,

it can be treated as a fixed or random effect. For
our purposes, we estimate a fixed effects panel data
model. Intuitively, the assumption of no correlation
between the heterogeneity term and age seems too
strong.3 But to confirm this, we also conducted a for-
mal statistical test, which consistently rejected the
random effects model.

A few recent papers investigating the age-
performance relationship in professional sports have
employed fixed effects panel estimation.4 The attrac-
tion of the fixed effects model is that, through the
player-specific term, ∝i, it allows each player to
have an individualized age-performance trajectory.
The estimation exercise can essentially be conceived
as a separate model being estimated for each player

3Relative to other disciplines, fixed effects panel data model is
the workhorse of applied economic research.

4These include Fair (2008) in baseball and Brander et al. (2014)
in ice hockey. Bradbury (2009) also analyzes baseball but employs
a random effects estimator. Other applications of fixed effects esti-
mation in sports include Arkes (2010), who tests the hot hand
theory in basketball, and Broadie and Rendleman Jr. (2013), who
examine world rankings in golf.

We present two sets of results based on how the age

as a categorical or dummy variable. This approach
essentially allows the ‘functional form’ of the age-
performance relationship to be determined by the
data.

4.1. Age polynomials

As noted, we estimate two types of polynomials.
A third-degree polynomial of the form:

WSit = γ0 + γ1Ageit + γ2Age2it
+ γ3Age3it+ ∝i +εit (2)

and a quadratic polynomial:

WSit = γ0 + γ1Ageit + γ2Age2it+ ∝i +εit (3)
Table 2 presents the results of the fixed effects

model with polynomials in age. For forwards and
midfielders, the cubic and/or other terms are not well
determined when specifying a third-degree polyno-
mial, therefore the focus will be on the quadratic
specification. For defenders, the relevant terms are
significant in both specifications. For each group, the
estimated coefficients have the expected signs – pos-
itive linear age and negative squared age – and are
highly significant. The peak age, which is computed

through the appropriate non-linear transformation of
the estimated coefficients, is presented along with a
95% confidence interval.5

The results show that forwards and midfielders
peak at 25 years of age. This estimate of peak age is
bolstered by a relatively narrow confidence interval
for each group. Defenders peak about 1 to 1.5 years
later, at 25.7 and 26.5 years, to be precise, in the
two specifications. These estimates imply that pro-
fessional soccer players generally peak at or closer to
their mid-20 s (between 25 and 27 when rounding-
off), perhaps somewhat earlier than conventional
wisdom holds.

Based on the fixed effects estimates, Figs. 4a to 4c
plot the predicted age-performance trajectory for the
average player – that is, when ∝i= 0. The plots for
forwards and midfielders are based on the quadratic
specification, hence the symmetry around peak age.
The two plots for defenders (Figs. 4c-1 and 4c-2)
are based on the cubic and quadratic specifications,
respectively. It is easy to note that forwards and mid-
fielders share very similar age-performance profiles.
In contrast, defenders generally realize much smaller
curvature in performance by age. The ascent towards
peak age is relatively similar for all three groups,

5Computing peak age is akin to finding the root/s of the deriva-
tive of the estimated function. Under the cubic specification (2),

the roots are given by:
−2γ̂2±

√
4γ̂2

2−12γ̂2 γ̂2
6γ̂2

, where γ̂’s are esti-
mated coefficients. Under the quadratic specification (3), peak
age is given by: −γ22γ̂2 . Of course peak age is a random variable
since the underlying estimators are random. The standard error
of peak age and the resulting confidence intervals are estimated
using the ‘delta method’. To check, alternative confidence inter-
vals were constructed using nonparametric bootstrapping methods.
They were virtually identical.

but the post-peak decline is significantly flatter for
defenders. Whereas defenders lose very little in per-
formance even after 30 years of age, forwards and
midfielders experience a considerably steeper decline
in their 30 s. Accordingly, for the average defender,
the range in predicted performance is tighter and
the duration of near-peak performance longer. If, for
instance, near-peak performance is defined as a rating
of 6.8 or above, the average forward performs near
the maximum level between 21 and 29 years of age,
the average midfielder between 20 and 29, and the
average defender between 20 and 33.6

6In general, absence of an acutely steep pre- and post-peak
gradient in the age-performance curvature and, consequently, the
presence of a prolonged period of near-maximum performance
by elite athletes is well documented in the literature (see for
instance Berry et al., 1999 for baseball and golf; Bradbury, 2009
for baseball; Brander et al., 2014 for hockey). The long duration of
near-peak performance predicted here for soccer players is in line
with the observations of Arsene Wenger (James, 2014) and Kuper
(2011).

4.2. Age dummy variables

Polynomials such as (2) and (3) are often employed
for modeling the age-performance relationship. Here,
they also fit the data relatively well.7 However, by
imposing a parametric structure, a polynomial con-
strains the age effect to have a certain, pre-determined
form. For example, a quadratic polynomial implies a
single peak and symmetry around that peak.

One way of allowing the age effect to be natu-
rally determined by the present data is through the use
of age dummy variables. Specifically, we estimate a
specification of the form:

WSit = γ0 +
∑

kγkDAGEk+ ∝i +εit (4)
where DAGEk is a dummy variable which is equal
to one if a player’s age (Ageit) equals k, zero

otherwise. We round off age to the nearest integer
and construct a dummy for each age from 19 to 38
(i.e. 19 ≤ k ≤ 38), where 18 year-olds form the ref-
erence category. Accordingly, at every level, age is
allowed to have an unconstrained, nonlinear effect on
performance.

Table 3 presents the regression results. For each
group, the constant term predicts the performance of
the average 18 year-old. The estimated coefficients
measure the difference in performance by an average
player of a given age, relative to the average 18 year-
old. The sum of the constant term and an estimated
age coefficient therefore measures predicted perfor-
mance at that age. Figures 5a to 5c plot this predicted
performance along with 95% confidence intervals.

The results imply that the average forward peaks at
26. But, as can be seen from Fig. 5a, forwards main-
tain near-peak performance from about 21 to 28 years
of age.8 The age-specific coefficients for midfield-
ers are generally not well-determined due to large
standard errors, but Fig. 5b shows that the overall
trajectory of performance is significant and fits the
expected pattern. The trajectory also shows that mid-

fielders seem to perform near maximum levels over a
slightly longer period, from about 21 to 29 years. As
shown in Fig. 5c, the predicted performance curve is
much flatter for defenders even well into their 30 s,
confirming the results from the polynomial regres-
sions. Visually, defenders maintain a very high level
of performance – less than half the sample standard
deviation from peak predicted rating – from about
21 to 32 years of age. More generally, a compari-
son of the shapes of the age-performance profiles in
5a-5c to those in 4a-4c confirms that, for all three
groups of players, the more parsimonious polynomial
specifications indeed fit the data well.9

5. Further analyses

Individualized age-performance trajectories

In the fixed effects specification in (1), all players
in a sample share the same basic age-performance

9Despite its supposed flexibility, the dummy variable speci-
fication is generally associated with statistical ‘roughness’ in the
estimation of age-specific coefficients, which renders precise or lit-
eral interpretation of the results difficult (see Albert, 1999; Furnald,
2012; Brander et al., 2014).

trajectory, f (Ageit). Player-specific trajectories are
then obtained through intercept shifts introduced by
the player fixed effect and regression error. However,
what if players have individualized age-performance
trajectories, with varying slopes and peaks? Could
it be, for instance, that aging functions vary on the
basis of ability – that is, higher ability players peak
systematically earlier or later than their lower ability
counterparts?

To further examine this, we estimate a model that
allows each player to have his own aging trajectory
of the general form:

WSit = fi (Ageit) + εit (5)
There are different ways of estimating such a

model (see Brander et al., 2014). In this paper, we
fit a random-coefficients model on a parsimoniously
specified quadratic aging function:

WSit = γ0i + γ1iAgeit + γ2iAge2it + εit (6)

As can be seen from the notation, the coefficients
in the model vary by player. Specifically, a random-
coefficients model introduces random effects to the
slope and intercept parameters in additive form:

WSit = (γ0 + U0i) + (γ1 + U1i)
Ageit + (γ2 + U2i) Age2it + εit (7)

where the random effects (U ′is) are treated as
observations from a multivariate normal distribution
with zero mean and a certain, specified variance-
covariance structure. The fixed components, which
are analogous to standard regression coefficients,
are estimated directly. Typically, the random effects
are summarized in terms of their estimated vari-
ances and covariances, although cluster-specific best
unbiased linear predictors (BLUPs) can be retrieved
post-estimation.

In this exercise, we again estimate Equation (6)
separately for the three groups of players. For each



100 S. Dendir / When do soccer players peak? a note

group, we predict the player-specific BLUPs of the
random effects, combine them with the estimated
fixed components, and construct individualized age-
performance trajectories. We then compute peak age
for each player based on his fitted trajectory. The dis-
tribution of peak ages is analyzed for comparison
with the peak age implied by the polynomial fixed

effects model in the previous section. Furthermore,
we regress individual peak age on a performance
proxy to check for the presence of a systematic rela-
tionship between ability and peak age.

in (6). Due to lack of convergence during maximum
likelihood estimation, the results for forwards use the
sub-sample of players who have data points for 3 or
more seasons (1208 observations from 289 players).
No such problem was encountered for midfielders
and defenders, whose regressions used the full sam-
ples. Comparing Figs. 6a-6c, it is apparent again that,
as a group, forward and midfield players face more
pronounced curvature in their age-performance tra-
jectories than defenders. Under a watchful eye, it also
appears that the denser concentration of fitted trajec-
tories and peak performances occur progressively to
the right as one moves from Figs. 6a to 6c, implying,
as a group, forwards seem to have their best years
earlier than midfielders and defenders.10

To be more precise with such statements, the peak
age is computed for each player based on his fit-
ted individual age-performance trajectory. Table 4a
presents important summary statistics on the esti-
mated peak ages, whereas Figs. 6d-6f show the full
histogram distribution for the three groups (along
with the estimated kernel density). It is clear from
the results that indeed forwards as a group peak rela-
tively early. The middle two quartiles of the peak age
distribution are bounded by 25.1 and 25.4 years, with
the mean (and median) peak age occurring at 25.3
years. In fact, Fig. 6d shows that more than 80% of
the estimated peak ages for forwards are between 25
and 25.5 years. According to the results in Table 4a,
the mean (and median) peak ages for midfielders and
defenders are comparable, although the distribution
is noticeably tighter for midfielders than defenders.
For instance, the standard deviation of peak age for
defenders is more than three times that of midfielders.
A comparison of Figs. 6e and 6f makes this visually
apparent – the peak age distribution for defenders
not only exhibits a wider range, it also sits slightly
to the right on the age scale relative to the one for
midfielders.

For forwards and defenders, the mean (or median)
peak age computed from the individualized trajecto-
ries here is comparable to the estimated peak age from
the polynomial fixed effects regressions in Table 2. In
both models, forward players peak around 25 years
of age, whereas defenders peak around 27 years. For
midfielders though, the estimated peak ages do not
match up well – the fixed effects model implies a peak
age that is roughly 1.5 to 2 years younger than the

average peak from the individual fitted trajectories.
The discrepancy suggests that midfield players are
perhaps a more heterogenous group and the assump-
tion that they share the same basic age-performance
trajectory is probably too strong.11

As noted earlier, the final exercise in this section
checks for the presence of a systematic relation-
ship between ability and age of peak performance.
To check this simply, the peak age estimated from
the individualized age-performance trajectory is
regressed on a measure of player ability. We use
two proxies for player ability – average WS rating
and maximum WS rating – and separate regressions
are run using the two measures. The results, which
are presented in Table 4b, strongly imply that bet-
ter players indeed peak later in their playing career.
For example, a forward player whose average rating
is 0.4 points higher – the equivalent of one standard
deviation in rating for the full sample of forwards –
peaks about a quarter year later. A similar computa-
tion for midfielders yields a comparable increase in
peak age. The implied effect for defenders is quite
substantial though – the equivalent of a full-sample
unit standard deviation rise in the average rating of
a defender pushes back his peak age by more than a
year.

6. Discussion

Put simply, the principal implication of the anal-
yses so far is that professional soccer players peak
around their mid-20 s – more precisely, between 25
and 27 years of age, depending on playing position.
This is perhaps earlier than what conventional soc-
cer wisdom holds. But is it broadly consistent with
the peak age identified for other sports that require
similar physical skills and dexterity as soccer? The
answer, largely, is yes.

11As noted by a reviewer, one reason for this could be the
varying demands of playing in different areas/positions in midfield.

In a seminal study, Schulz and Curnow (1988)
analyzed historical data from multiple sports to deter-
mine peak performance. Their analyses showed that
athletic events that demand strength, speed, explosive
power, quick reaction and body coordination tend
to experience peak performances in the early 20 s.
Swimming, sprinting and tennis belong to this cate-
gory. Those events that rely on endurance and more
complex motor and acquired skills, such as baseball
and golf, tend to peak in the late 20 s. Interestingly,
they also find that although peak performance in most
events improved dramatically during the course of the
20th century, the age of peak performance has largely
held steady. This, they argue, is evidence that physi-
ological constraints primarily dictate the window for
optimal performance.

Other studies have since corroborated the gen-
eral conclusions of Schulz and Curnow (1988) in the
context of various sports. For instance, peak perfor-
mance in baseball is generally thought to be achieved
between the ages of 27 and 30, although peak age
varies widely between specific tasks of the game
(Schulz et al., 1994; Fair, 2008; and Bradbury, 2009,
among others). The peak age in ice hockey, among
the most physically demanding of all sports, occurs
between 27 and 29 years depending on playing posi-
tion (Berry, et al., 1999; Brander et al., 2014). Berry
et al. (1999) noted that this is somewhat earlier than
home run hitters in baseball (29 years) and consid-
erably earlier than golfers (around 34 years; see also
Tiruneh, 2010). Track and field performance peaks
between 23 and 28 years depending on the specific
event (Hollings et al., 2014). Runners and jumpers,
for example, peak around 25 years of age whereas
throwers peak later, around 26 to 28 years. A recent
study on tennis indicated that the age of peak per-
formance has probably edged up over time, perhaps
owing to the increasing importance of stamina in the
modern game (Kovalchik, 2014).

In a recent paper, Allen and Hopkins (2015) pro-
vided a systematic review of estimates of age of
peak performance of elite athletes in the twenty-
first century. They classify events into three types –
explosive power/sprint, endurance, and mixed/skill
– and summarize their findings by relating peak
age to event duration. In explosive events, such as
sprints and 50–100 m swimming, the peak age ranges
from 20 to 27 years, but it invariably decreases
with event duration (i.e. longer duration explosive
events realize younger peak age). For endurance
events, such middle- and long/ultra-distance running
and cycling, the range for peak age is considerably
wider, but it linearly increases with event dura-
tion. There was no specific pattern for mixed-skill
events.

The physical and physiological demands of elite
soccer would make it a quintessential mixed-skill
event a la ice hockey and tennis. On the one hand,
the game requires extraordinary endurance – outfield
players run 6-7 miles in a game at an average intensity
close to the anaerobic threshold, defined as 80–90%
of the maximal heart rate (Stolen et al., 2005). This
endurance aspect of the game presumably pushes the
age of peak performance to the upper 20 s. On the
other hand, within the endurance context, strength
and explosive power are equally essential. Force
generated by the neuromuscular system, speed and
acceleration routinely combine to produce the maxi-
mum power that is needed to undertake the numerous
bursts of explosive activity. These include sprinting,
high-intensity running, tackling, jumping, cutting,
dueling and so on.12 According to the evidence cited
above, performance in these types of predominantly
strength and power events peaks in the early 20 s.
Therefore, the peak window of mid-20 s estimated in

12Stolen et al. (2005) provide estimates of the number and
duration of these various activities in a typical game.



S. Dendir / When do soccer players peak? a note 103

this paper is perhaps explained by the unique com-
bination of endurance and explosive power that is
necessary to perform at the highest levels of the
game.

Moreover, the other important finding of the paper
– that forwards peak probably earlier than midfielders
and certainly earlier than defenders – is also largely
explainable by the physical demands of playing each
position. Time-motion analysis in elite soccer has
shown that forwards undertake the most maximal
sprints and for longer durations, ahead of midfield-
ers and defenders (Bloomfield et al., 2007 and sources
cited therein). Using data from the Premier League,
Bloomfield et al. (2007) confirm that defenders spend
the least amount of time sprinting and running,
whereas midfielders run the most and shuffle the least.
Forwards, on the other hand, perform significantly
higher amount of shuffling, endure the most physi-
cal contact at high intensity, and generally undertake
more high to very high intensity activity relative to
players in the other two positions. These findings sug-
gest that, for forwards, the explosive/power elements
of thegameprobablypredominate theendurancecom-
ponent.

Put another way, the results confirm the conven-
tional wisdom that the physical demands placed on
defenders are perhaps less strenuous. Because of
this, defence is probably the one position where
acquired learning and experience can be most utilized
to compensate age-induced deterioration in physical
performance.Schulzetal. (1994)notedthatamongthe
three interrelated factors that determine performance
– physiological capacity, experience and motivation
– only experience continues to rise over time, albeit
with diminishing marginal gains. Motivation of elite
athletes is assumed to remain more or less con-
stant, while physiological capacity declines after the
well-known threshold age of 30 (Gabbard, 2004).
In athletic endeavors, they conclude, typically phys-
iological capacity eventually overrides experience.
However, one would expect that the lesser the physi-
caldemands, in relative terms, thebetter thechancesof
slowing down this overriding process. This is presum-
ablywhydefenders tend topeak laterbutalsomaintain
near-peak performance over a wider range, sometime
well into their 30 s. The fruits of experience – such as
game knowledge, anticipation and tactical awareness
– can be brought to the fore to minimize the effects of
physical decline.

Alex Ferguson’s advice to Rio Ferdinand, one of
the most physically and technically gifted central
defenders of his era, encapsulates this:

“In his autumn years I had to tell him to change
his game to take account of age and what it does to
all of us. The years catch up with you. I told him,
publicly and privately, that he needed to step back
a yard or two to give himself a chance against
strikers. Five years previously it had been lollipop
stuff. With his change of pace he’d rob a center-
forward just when the striker thought he was in
business. He could no longer do that. He needed
to be on the scene before the crime could happen.”
(Ferguson, 2013:85)

In fact, his advice encapsulates the theme of this
paper.

7. Conclusion

Modern professional soccer players are finely
tuned athletes that perform at a very high level phys-
ically. They do so despite an increasingly demanding
and crowded calendar of competitions and games.
Part of the credit for this goes to clubs, who over the
years have invested considerably in sports science
support infrastructure – from modern training facili-
ties, to fitness and diet professionals, to performance
analytics capabilities – to monitor, elevate and sus-
tain player performance (Anderson and Sally, 2013;
Williams, 2013).

But even with state-of-the-art fitness regimen,
nature will surely have its say on the limits of player
performance. This paper has examined one aspect of
this, namely the optimal age for performance. The
results show that the average player peaks between
ages 25 and 27. This represents perhaps a younger
and narrower age band than the widely considered
peak age of mid to late 20 s. But in line with conven-
tional wisdom, forwards peak earlier than defenders.
They most likely peak earlier than midfielders as well,
althoughinonemodel thetwogroupsarefoundtopeak
around the same age (25 years).

The results in the paper are useful in terms of
informing our expectations about when soccer players
are likely to perform at the maximum level. By impli-
cation, they also inform us about when they are likely
to be most valuable in the marketplace. Two caveats
are in order, however. First, the results largely pertain
to the ‘average’ player. Players vary in physical and
other ability and only individualized assessment can
inform us when a specific player is likely to perform
optimally (Strudwick, 2013).13 Second, as already

13It goes without saying that this is why clubs do extensive
scouting and monitoring of potential buys and current players.



104 S. Dendir / When do soccer players peak? a note

noted in the paper, soccer remains the prototypical
team game, and the extent to which a player can
express his ability, physical or otherwise, still largely
depends on the players surrounding him, in addition
to numerous other factors.

Note: For forwards and midfielders, the estimated fixed effect (EFE) is from the quadratic polynomial; for defenders it is from the cubic
polynomial. See Table 2. The ranking shows the top 25 players, by position, who had at least 3 data points in the estimation sample. Notable
omissions are Zlatan Ibrahimovic (EFE = 1.110) and Neymar (EFE = 0.869), each with ratings for two seasons only (the former had moved
to the French League and the latter joined Barcelona in 2013/14). With their EFEs, they ranked 4th and 8th, respectively, in the forwards list.
