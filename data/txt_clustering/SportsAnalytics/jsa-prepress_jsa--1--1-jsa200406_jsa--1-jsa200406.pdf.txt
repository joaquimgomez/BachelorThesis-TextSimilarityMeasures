Abstract. Taking advantage of space and time is a major focus of tennis coaching yet few statistical measures exist to
evaluate a player’s spatio-temporal performance in matches. The present study proposed the time to net as a single metric
capturing both space and time characteristics of the quality of a shot. Tracking data from 2017 Australian Open allowed
a detailed investigation of the characteristics and predictive value of the time-to-net in 33,913 men’s and 19,195 women’s
shots. For groundstroke shots, the majority of men’s and women’s shots have a time-to-net between 200 and 800 ms. The
expected time to net was found to vary significantly by gender, shot type, and where in a rally it occurred. We found
considerable between-player differences in average time-to-net of groundstrokes when serving or receiving, indicating the
potential for time-to-net to capture differences in playing style. Time-to-net increased prediction accuracy of point outcomes
by 8 percentage points. These findings show that time to net is a simple spatio-temporal statistic that has descriptive and
predictive value for performance analysis in tennis.

1. Introduction17

Ask any tennis coach what distinguishes the most18
successful players in the sport from other players and19
they are likely to say it’s their ability to dictate “space20
and time” (Crespo and Miley, 1998). When coaches21
talk about space, they are referring to a player’s ability22
to maintain a position of advantage, occupying the23
part of the court that gives them good coverage while24
limiting the coverage of their opponent. Time is the25
term coaches use when they are referring to a player’s26
ability to play at a comfortable pace while disrupting27
the pace of their opponent.28

Few statistical measures exist to assist tennis29
coaches and performance analysts in evaluating a30
player’s spatio-temporal performance in a match. In31
(Carvalho et al., 2013) authors propose a measure32
of positional advantage that is based on the distance33

between players during a rally. The positional advan- 34
tage measure of Carvalho and colleagues has gone 35
the furthest of any other published work to quantify 36
the quality of player position (Carvalho et al. 2014). 37
However, the measure ignores the timing or quality 38
of shots, and much about its influence on outcomes 39
remains untested. 40

There is a growing number of papers that are utiliz- 41
ing positional tracking data to advance the statistical 42
analysis of professional tennis. These studies have 43
focused on the prediction of shot and point outcomes 44
(Wei et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2016) characterizing 45
shots (Kovalchik and Reid, 2018; Mecheri et al., 46
2016), or describing the characteristics of matchplay 47
(Reid, Morgan and Whiteside, 2016; Kovalchik and 48
Reid, 2017). Metric development from tracking data 49
has received less attention in the sports statistics lit- 50
erature. 51

Considering the lack of measures for describing 52
spatio-temportal features of performance in tennis, 53
the present paper sought to develop a useful spatio- 54
temporal statistic from tracking data that could be 55

easily interpreted by tennis coaches. The proposed56
statistic is the time to net, which measures the57
time from impact to when a shot crosses the net.58
The remainder of the paper describes the calcula-59
tion of time to net and provides a detailed analysis60
of its characteristics and predictive value using a61
large dataset of shots played in professional tennis62
matches.

2. Data description64

This analysis was based on the matches from65
the 2017 Australian Open tournament. Our data66
included matches that were played on the courts67
equipped with the Hawk-Eye system (Owens, Harris68
and Stennett, 2003). The ball tracking system allows69
players to challenge line calls during matches,70
with Hawk-Eye calculating the ball bounce loca-71
tion with a mean error of 2.66 mm (Hawk-Eye72
Innovations). The full explanation is available73
from the Hawk-Eye website at: http://pulse-static-74
files.s3.amazonaws.com/HawkEye/document/2016/75
01/18/caa1c8ce-9a27-47f1-bf5e-777d2a9f5d13/ELC76
Accuracy & Reliability.pdf (accessed 14 February77

2020).78
Our dataset included 66 men’s matches and 6479

women’s matches. Since we wanted to analyze time80
pressure rallies, we included only points longer than81
2 shots. For men, this included 8,026 points with82
all together 33,913 shots. For women, this included83
4,834 points and 19,195 shots. The reason for having84
so much more points for men is because men play85
best of 5 sets compared to women’s best of 3.86

Figure 1 shows how many shots (rally length) were87
in all points. We can see that the longer the rally, the88
lesser the number of points.89

For each shot in addition to player name, shot type90
and shot number in a rally; we also calculated the91
time to net. This is the time from shot impact to when92
the ball passes over the net, and it is the portion of93
the time the ball occupies a player’s side of the court94
and thus is completely under their control.95

3. Measuring time pressure96

To measure time pressure, we used the previously97
described time to net. Of course, if this time to net98
is small then the opponent will have less time for his99
shot and thus he will be more under pressure.100

First, we compared shots, focusing only on fore-101
hands and backhands and left other shots out of this102

analysis. We can see a distribution of time to net for 103
forehands and backhands for the men in Fig. 2. We 104
can see that the forehand is clearly the dominant shot 105
which is used to hit the ball faster, thus producing 106
lower time to net. 107

In women’s tour, we can see in Fig. 3 that the time 108
to net for forehand is similar then it is for backhand. 109
The reason for that is probably in the strength where 110
women cannot produce much more power with the 111
same accuracy with one hand. 112

To compare men’s and women’s distributions, we 113
also draw time to net distributions for backhand shots 114
(Fig. 4). We can see that time to net for the most 115
shots is very similar. We can see a slight difference 116
in variation, where for the men, the larger amount of 117
shots has lower time to net. These shots are slice shots 118
which are slower and are used far more in men’s tour 119
than in women’s. 120

Next, we focused on exploring how time to net 121
changes with the length of the rally and how serve 122
influences the time to net. So, we further divided data 123
to only shots from server and shots from returner 124
to see how the serve influences the time to net and 125
how long this influence lasts. The Fig. 5 shows the 126

average time to net (and the 95% confidence interval)127
for shots made by server and returner. On the x-axis128
we have shot number, so we can draw both averages129
from server and returner nicely on one graph. The130
average in this case refers to i.e. all 4th shots in a rally.131
If rally is shorter, and there is no 4th shot, we do not132
include this point. Since here, we are not interested in133
time to net for serve and return the graph starts with134
shot number 2.135

As we can see, by the 6th shot (rally length = 11 or136
12) the time to net for the server and returner comes137
together. So, this means that the advantage the server138
is gone when the rally length is more than 10.139

For the women’s tour, the average times to net for140
server and returner with confidence intervals can be141
seen in Fig. 6.142

As we can see, the average time to net for server143
and returner comes together around 4th shot (rally144
length 7 or 8). The lines are not together further on as145
with men, due to the smaller number of data points146
for longer rallies. So, some “special” points can move147
the line a bit.148

men’s game.

Fig. 8. Percentage of winner shots on each shot number for the
women’s game.

To take a different look at server influence, we 149
calculated the percentage of winners’ players hit on 150
average for each shot in a point. The idea here is that if 151
you have a good serve you would get weaker returns 152
and thus can hit more winners after the serve. And 153
as the rally continues the advantage from the good 154
serve would be gone and the percentage of winners 155
would lower and would become similar for server and 156
returner. These graphs for men’s and women’s game 157
can be seen in Figs. 7 and 8. 158

We can see that similarly as with average time to 159
net, the percentage of winners gets even when rally 160
length is more than 10 (shot number 5-6). And with 161
women, similarly when rally length is more than 7. 162
So, it is fair to say, that the influence of the serve 163
can be felt for the next 4 shots after serve in men’s 164
competition and for the next 2 shots in women’s. This 165
confirms that the men are serving relatively better and 166
that serve is much more of an advantage in men’s 167
competition. 168

Next, we focused on the last shots in a point. We 169
wanted to know if the last shots in average have dif- 170
ferent times to net then the shots that are not the last 171
ones in a point. The graphs for men can be seen in 172
Fig. 9 and for women in Fig. 10. 173

In both cases, we can see that there is a difference 174
if a shot is the last shot of the point or not. The differ- 175
ence is expected, since winners (or winner attempts) 176
are usually faster shots, thus have lower time to 177
net. The difference is somewhat similar and mostly 178
independent of the rally length, so it is not influenced 179
by the serve. Interestingly in women’s game the dif- 180
ference is a bit larger. We can also see especially for 181

the men’s the difference in time to net for the first few182
shots, because of the serve influence.183

4. Player specifics184

In this section, we focused on how time to net185
characteristics vary from player to player. Estimates186
of the expected time to net for each player was187
obtained from a linear mixed model with a player188
random effect, which was fit separately for points189
on serve and points on return. To verify the signifi-190
cance of the results, we used likelihood ratio tests to191
derive measures of statistical significance and boot-192
strap resamples for 95% confidence intervals.193

The analyses revealed notable between-player194
variation in average time to net characteristics. For195
men, the fastest averages when serving were under196
400 ms, while the slowest times were over 530 ms;197
when receiving times were systematically slower but198
the fastest and slowest averages were still separated199
by more than 100 ms (Figure 11). Indeed, men took200
50 ms less time to net on average when serving than201
when receiving (P < 0.001).202

Players who were significantly faster to get to net203
on serve and return included Marin Cilic, Roger Fed-204
erer, and Alexander Zverev. A number of the fastest205
on serve were not significantly different from aver-206
age on serve, like Sam Groth and Ivo Karlovic; while207
Mischa Zverev was significantly slower than average208
when receiving.209

We observe more consistency in the time to net210
characteristics among players that are slower than211

average on serve. Specifically, players who were sig- 212
nificantly slower than average on serve, such as Robin 213
Hasse, Steve Darcis, and Paolo Lorenzi, also tended 214
to be similarly slower than average when receiving. 215

The time difference between the fastest and slow- 216
est time to net for female players was also more 217
than 100 ms, revealing comparable between-player 218
variation as was observed for the men. However, 219
unlike male players, the time to net characteristics 220
for women were less dependent on serve (Figure 12). 221
Women were 18 ms faster to net on average when 222
serving than when receiving (P < 0.001). 223

Several women who had the fastest time to net on 224
serve and return were CoCo Vandeweghe, Ana Kon- 225
juh, Elina Vesnina and Ashleigh Barty. These players 226
had time to net averages under 450 ms when serving 227
and under 500 ms when receiving. 228

Players who exhibited the slowest times to net on 229
serve and return, included Mariana Duque-Marino, 230
Agniezska Radwanska, and Barbora Strycova. The 231
average time to net for this group of players was 232
570 ms or slower when serving and 580 ms or slower 233
when receiving. 234

5. Predicting point endings with time to net 235

In addition to all the presented stats, we also wanted 236
to look at the sequence of times to net for each shot in 237
the rally and then predict if the point would end with 238
the winner or with the error. The tracking data allows 239
us to identify shots that are clean winners and shots 240
that are errors, but it does not include subjective clas- 241
sification of errors, so we were not able to separate 242
between ‘unforced’ and ‘forced’ errors. If the pre- 243
diction accuracy would be high this would indicate 244
that just by looking at the sequence of times to net, 245
we could predict the point endings. Also, accurately 246
predicting point outcomes by just looking at the time 247
to net sequences, would indicate that time to net is an 248
(very) important factor for players to focus on. 249

If we look at the characteristics of time to net for 250
the last shot in the rally the average time to net for 251
winner is 380 ms for men and 390 ms for women and 252
the average time to net for error is 530 ms for men and 253
540 ms for women. This is somewhat as expected, 254
because if you want to hit a ball so that the opponent 255
doesn’t get to the ball, the shot must be fast and thus 256
it has a lower time to net. 257

Another thing that obviously comes to mind is to 258
calculate how difference between last shot and oppo- 259
nents last shot influences the point outcome. The idea 260

here is that for hitting winner you usually need to first261
hit one good shot and then after opponent hits back262
weaker shot with higher time to net you have more263
time and can hit your last shot faster (and more accu-264
rate) and thus hit a winner. If we calculate the average265
difference for last shots, we get the average time to net266
for winners -270 ms and for errors 30 ms. For women,267
we get -290 ms for winners and 33 ms for errors. This268
is expected and again the results are very similar for269
men and women.270

These two features may sound like the most 271
descriptive ones, but we calculated also additional 272
features that may help to get better predictions. So, 273
for the machine learning, we used the following set 274
of features:

275

– time to net for last shot 276
– time to net for before last shot 277
– time to net for before last shot of the player that 278

hit the last shot 279

detect patterns that occur between two players where296
one player is an attacker and constantly has lower297
time to net compared to the defensive player. A fea-298
ture with standard deviation is included to detect a299
type of player that mixes his time to net a lot, like300
Federer that plays slow slices combined with fast301
shots.302

So, having these all additional features could303
increase the possibilities of model recognizing dif-304
ferent types of play or specific players and then use305
this information with last time to net differently, as306
it would without this knowledge. We know that there307
are styles of play that are hard to describe with just308
simple features, but for some players, these features309
could be useful.310

We build 2 separate prediction models, one for men311
and one for women. To build and test the prediction312
models, we used stratified 10-fold cross-validation.313
This means that we randomly separated the dataset314
to 10 pieces, with each piece having the same class315
distribution. Then we used 9 pieces to train the model316
and the remaining piece to test it. We repeated this317
for each of 10 pieces and averaged the results we318
obtained on the test set.319

For the prediction model, we used the Extreme320
Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm (Chen, He and321
Benesty, 2015). The algorithm is known for its proven322
efficiency, speed and flexibility and was therefore323
used many times at Kaggle tournaments by win-324
ning teams (Mangal and Kumar, 2016; Sheridan.,325
2016). We used 100 trees as a parameter for XGB326
and left other parameters with default. We know that327
by optimizing parameters we could maybe increase328
the prediction accuracy further by a small margin, but329
this was not the scope of this paper.330

To put results into a perspective, we first used331
a dummy classifier. This is a very simple classifier332
that does not take into account any features, but just333
always predicts the class that is most frequent. We334
started with predicting men’s point endings first. So,335
the classification accuracy with the dummy classifier336
was 66.1%. To see how much accuracy improves with337
just time to net, we used only this one feature to train338
the model. The accuracy we obtained was 73.6%.339
Next, we added the feature describing the difference340
between the last shots and with these two features341
we got the classification accuracy of 74.8%. Then we342
added all the other features and calculated the final343
accuracy and it was 75.1%.344

For the women’s points, we did the same procedure345
with no (dummy classifier), one, two and all features.346
The results are presented in Table 1.347

Table 1

Classification accuracies for different prediction models for men’s
and women’s points

Dummy Time to net 2 features All features

Men’s 66.1% 73.6% 74.8% 75.1%
Women’s 65.2% 73.0% 75.0% 75.3%

We can see that the results for predicting point 348
endings on men’s points are very similar to results 349
obtained on women’s points. First, the dummy clas- 350
sifier indicates that approximately two out of three 351
points end with an error. So, if the model predicts 352
every point as the error it gets correct approximately 353
two-thirds of the time. Then with just using feature 354
time to the net we are able to increase the prediction 355
accuracy by almost 8 percent. By adding the differ- 356
ence feature we can see that the accuracy increases by 357
1.2% with men and 2% with women. This indicates 358
that this feature holds some additional prediction 359
value. On the last step, we used all the remaining 360
features and build the best model we could with all 361
the features available. We did manage to increase the 362
prediction accuracy a little bit but this clearly indi- 363
cates that the other features do not hold much new 364
information about how the point will end. This means 365
that the most important information about the point 366
ending is in the last two shots. Of course, having addi- 367
tional features like player positions, ball speeds and 368
others would improve the classification accuracy, but 369
in this paper, we focused only on the time to the net 370
and its characteristics.

371

6. Conclusion 372

In this paper, we introduced the time to net, the time 373
from the shot impact to the time when the ball passes 374
over the net, as a statistic that captures a player’s spa- 375
tial and temporal advantage when making a shot. We 376
used this feature to analyze differences between shots 377
and genders, determine how it influences the shot out- 378
comes and how it differentiates between the different 379
playing styles. For our work, we used Hawk-Eye data 380
from the 2017 Australian Open tournament for both 381
men’s and women’s matches. The main findings can 382
be summarized as following: 383

– Men’s forehands have lower time to net then 384
backhands and women’s forehands and back- 385
hands have similar time to net 386

– Compared to women’s shots, men’s forehand 387
shots had a lower time to net, but men’s backhand 388
shots had a similar time to net 389

– Average time to net gets longer with rally length,390

– The server advantage for men vanishes approxi-392
mately by the 10th shot of the rally. With women,393
where the serve is not that much of a weapon,394
the advantage vanishes around the 7th shot of395
the rally.396

– The average time to net for the last shot in a rally397

– Player specifics identify which players have400
lower (higher) average time to net on serve,401
return or both. With these results players could402
be grouped in to several playing styles.403

– Using machine learning, we build several mod-404
els for predicting the point outcomes using405
different features calculated from the sequence406
of time to nets for each shot. We showed which407
features are the most descriptive and what accu-408
racy can be obtained using just time to net409
features.
