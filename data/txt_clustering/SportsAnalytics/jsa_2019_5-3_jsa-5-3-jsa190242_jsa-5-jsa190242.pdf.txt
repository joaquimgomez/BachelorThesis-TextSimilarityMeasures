Abstract. Scores of 464 dunks (of 682) in the 1984-2016 NBA Slam Dunk Contests (SDCs) were analyzed. Nonparametric
regression was used to analyze the elements of dunks themselves (R2 = 0.44). Residuals were the dependent variable in a linear
mixed-model with contest formatting and superlative variables as fixed effects; contestant and year were random effects. SDC
scores were significantly influenced by the elements of a given dunk such as whether a pass was thrown, if the contestant
rotated his body while airborne, or spun his arm while possessing the ball. Dunking later in the scheduled sequence increased
scores in the initial round. Higher contestant popularity (measured by proportional newspaper mentions) and competing
in home arenas increased scores. Replacing missed dunks reduced scores. Histrionic displays that were exhibited prior to
dunking but were uninvolved in the execution of the dunk itself increased scores. Greater dunk novelty and judge experience
reduced scores. The results are interpreted to show that athleticism influences scoring, that excitement factors prominently
in scoring, and that SDC scoring is subject to similar superlative pressures found in other aesthetic sports. The findings are
discussed and related to the NBA, SDC, and dunk contests in general.

1. Introduction

Slam dunking is the most efficient and spectacular
maneuver for scoring points in basketball. Observers
may cheer or jeer the points scored but the dunk is a
crowd favorite. Hence, exhibitory dunk contests are
held worldwide at all levels of organized basketball.
To date, there has been no systematic examination
of the factors that influence the predominate method
of scoring in dunk contests: judge’s subjective eval-
uations. By factors, we refer to elements of a dunk
itself, the context in which a dunk occurs, and others,
such as the popularity of the contestants. To elucidate
the influence of these factors on judge-awarded dunk

scores, we analyzed data from the most well-known
dunking competition, the NBA Slam Dunk Contest
(SDC).

The text is organized as follows: [i] a review
of, operationalization of, and hypotheses about the
variables; [ii] descriptions of the data set; [iii] expla-
nations of the analytic procedures; [iv] presentation
of the results; and [v] discussion of the findings.

1.1. Variables

We focused on three broad factors thought to influ-
ence the dependent variable, judge-awarded dunk
scores in SDCs. The factors were the [i] elements
of a dunk such as the distance leapt from or air-
borne anatomical maneuverings; [ii] formatting and
other contest-contextual pressures such as elimi-
nation schedule and replacement dunks; and [iii]

superlatives that are exogenous of dunk execution
such as contestant popularity and home advantage.
First, however, we introduce the judging procedures
as we understand them.

1.2. Dunk scores

At the beginning of each SDC telecast, commen-
tators introduced the judges, judging procedures, and
contestants. All SDCs utilizing judges featured a
panel of five judges consisting predominately of for-
mer or current NBA players, though a minority were
public figures. Telecast commentators or graphics
specified that dunks were judged on “style, athletic
ability, and creativity. Judges assigned an integer
from 1 to 10, with greater values indicating a more
athletic, creative, or stylistic dunk.” For SDCs 1989-
96, judges could include tenths of points. The values
from the five judges were summed to yield the score
for a dunk. The maximum score for a successful dunk
(i.e., would garner 2 points in basketball) was 50,
across contests; the maximum for a missed dunk (i.e.,
missed field goal in basketball) was 25 until 2000,
thereafter it was 30. Scores for all dunks in a round or
the highest scoring dunks in a round were summed to
determine which contestants progressed to the next
round. In SDCs in which replacements for missed
dunks were permitted, judges were asked to excuse
the attempts that were replaced when evaluating the
ultimate dunk.

With the exceptions described below, a contes-
tant performed his dunk and then judges scored the
dunk. Scores were always awarded after one dunk
and before the next dunk was performed. It appears
judges were unaware of what dunks would be per-
formed. Although maneuvers have been disclosed
to the press and in other media (Denberg, 1986,
Aschburner, 1995, Tillery, 2008), it appears many
contestants prefer to keep their strategies guarded
(Denberg, 1986, Farrey, 1990, Aschburner, 1995,
Schmitz, 2008) whereas others opt for an improvi-
sational approach (Krieger, 2000, Dougherty, 2001,
Rudman, 1987, Times, 2006).

There were several exceptions to the dunk-then-
judge procedure. In the 1994-97 initial rounds and
in the 1995 final round, each contestant received a
single score for several dunks he performed consec-
utively, prior to judging (on the same 0–10, max of
50 scale). From 2009-13 dunks in the final rounds
were not judged, rather, viewer submitted votes for a
contestant were summed to determine the winner. No
dunks were scored in the 2012 and 2014 SDCs when

the winners were determined using the viewer voting
method.

1.3. Dunk elements

Intuitively, dunk elements should correspond to
variability in scores because the elements distin-
guish one dunk from others. Some elements require
greater athleticism and thus are more difficult to
execute successfully than others. Likewise, creativ-
ity and style are restricted by athleticism. Judging
dunks on athletic ability ostensibly corresponds to
difficulty as in figure skating (Union, 2016) or gym-
nastics (Butcher, 2017). This seems to be a reasonable
interpretation of athletic ability absent a more precise
definition. Insight into which elements might be most
influential is inferable from the comments of past
contestants.

Dominique Wilkins implied the importance of
achieving maximal verticality (Bee, 1988). Clyde
Drexler endorsed airborne movements of the legs
(Wendy, 1989). Kenny Walker seconded the notion of
leg movements and stressed the importance of hang-
time and full extension of the arms (Wendy, 1989,
Powell, 1990). Comments by Isaiah Ryder suggest
leaping over obstructions such as players or motor
vehicles (Aschburner, 1995). Julius Erving implied
jumping farther away from the goal and approaching
it from different angles (Spencer, 2000). Baron Davis
indicated exerting maximal force on the basket while
finishing (Dougherty, 2001).

These and other elements will be analyzed; the
exceptions to the above being, duration of hangtime
and the exertion of power at the finish because each
is too specific for this seminal analysis. We antici-
pate that elements will influence judge-awarded dunk
scores, with dexterously more demanding kinemat-
ics such as the between-the-legs and behind-the-back
garnering greater scores. We expect that airborne
rotations and leaping farther from the basket, par-
ticularly from the free throw line, will also increase
scores.

1.4. Contest formatting

Except for 2012 and 2014, SDCs progressed in
single-elimination format, with contestants generally
performing at least two dunks in each round. Succes-
sive rounds culminated in a final round in which the
winner was determined. Lower scoring competitors
in a round were eliminated whereas higher scoring
competitors survived to compete in the next round.

Ties were decided with the tied-contestants per-
forming additional dunks and eliminating the lower
scoring contestant.

The number of contestants has varied over the years
(see Table 1). In 1985, the top-two 1984 contestants
and in 1986, the 1985 winner were each granted a first
round by. Half or more contestants were generally
eliminated in each round. Two contestants survived
to the final rounds of all SDCs except 1993-97 and
2000-01, when three survived.

In the words of one Association executive in
1988: judging is “totally subjective” (Denberg, 1988).
Another matter to consider then, is how individ-
ual judges interpret and apply the scoring criteria
when evaluating a dunk. An inter-judge analysis of
deviance would provide insight in this regard, but

individual judge-scores were rarely displayed on the
SDC broadcasts prior to 2000. Even then, of 170
judged dunks from 2000 and after (or 850 possible
judge scores), 18.4% of judge-scores were not dis-
played on the broadcast (or 156 judge scores). To
account for potential differences in how judges inter-
pret and apply the scoring criteria, we include year as
a random effect in the analysis and include a variable
indicating prior judging experience of the judging
panel in each SDC.

1.4.1. Rounds
From 1984-92, the SDC consisted of three rounds

and thereafter, two. Because dunks are scored on
“athletic ability, creativity, and style”, less impres-
sive competition should be awarded lower scores



226 J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC

and eliminated from one round to the next. Thus, a
reasonable expectation is that athletic and creative
dunking increases in each round. However, judges
might anticipate superior dunks in later rounds and
be reluctant to award higher scores in initial rounds.
Qualifying rounds in elite figure skating tend to yield
lower scores and have greater variance compared to
later rounds (Lee, 2004). Similar patterns have been
documented in men’s elite gymnastics (Leskošek et
al., 2010) and culinary competitions (Haigner et al.,
2010). Our hypothesis is mean increases and vari-
ance decreases in scores will be observed as rounds
progress.

1.4.2. Sequence
Sequence effects, whereby performing later in

sequence yields more favorable scores, have been
demonstrated in figure skating (de Bruin, 2006),
gymnastics (Morgan and Rotthoff, 2014), and syn-
chronized swimming (Wilson, 1977). In SDCs,
contestants completed several dunks in each round
such that all completed their first dunk in order, then
all completed their second in the same order, and so
on. We refer to sequence, however, as the chronologi-
cal completion of dunks within a round, from the first
to the last. For example, in a round with four contes-
tants who each dunked twice, dunk 4 is the first dunk
of the last contestant and dunk 5 is the second dunk
of the first contestant. We refer to this as positions in
sequence.

Inasmuch as can be gleaned from telecasts and
associated media, the initial round positioning of
contestants in sequence was determined following
“random draw” or “by draw”. Likewise, within each
SDC, the contestant with the highest score in a round
was often the last dunker in the following round, but
sequences of some were determined randomly or by
coin toss. Telecast commentators exhibited a change
in verbiage in 1991, changing the description of initial
round sequence from “by random draw” to “by draw”.
Although subtle, and that ‘draw’ still implies some
measure of randomness, the change in verbiage sug-
gests that sequence may have no longer warranted the
qualifier of ‘random’. That is, positions in sequence
could have been coordinated, in lieu of randomiza-
tion, to serve some extracurricular purpose such as
positioning more popular contestants earlier or later
in the sequence to appeal to viewers. To account for
this possibility, a precursory examination of popu-
larity, home-advantage, sequencing, and progressing
beyond the initial round was conducted such that a
trend was expected to emerge if sequence changed as

a function of contestant popularity or home advan-
tage and the extent to which those three variables
influenced surviving the initial round.

Additionally, there was one exception to the ran-
domness of sequence in the initial round. The winner
of the previous SDC dunked last, if he was a con-
testant. Conceivably, the previous SDC winner has
demonstrated an ability to successfully execute dunks
that yield high scores and by being positioned later
in the sequence, could moderate a sequence effect.
To our knowledge, SDC judging protocols are less
refined than that of the subjectively-judged Olympic
sports. Because of this, we suspect there will be a
sequence effect but are uncertain of the magnitude.

1.4.3. Errors in execution
Unique to the SDC are replacement dunks, granted

when a contestant misses a dunk (i.e., a missed field-
goal in basketball). We also included in the analysis,
attempts, or dunks aborted before attempting a dunk
(i.e., not an attempted field goal). To our knowl-
edge, no other aesthetic sports grant replacements of
errancy. In 1984 replacements were prohibited but
attempts were permissible. In the remainder of the
1980s and in the 1990s, contestants were generally
afforded 1 or 2 replacements per round and attempts
were permitted. In recent years, unlimited replace-
ments per dunk have been allowed within a 90- or
120-second time limit.

Replacements and attempts might place additional
pressure on the contestant to execute successfully,
perhaps affecting performance (Dohmen, 2008, Kent
and Ewell, 2001). Notably, retired NBA player and
judge in recent years, Shaquille O’Neal, has con-
tended that a maximum score (50) should not be
awarded following a replacement dunk, indicat-
ing that contestants should be sufficiently practiced
executing their dunks. For these reasons, we hypoth-
esize that scores will decrease as replacements and
attempts increase.

1.5. Superlatives

In competitive sanctioned sports, judges and
referees are asked to maintain impartiality when
evaluating performances and enforcing regulatory
statutes. This is tenuous in application because
myriad variables influence human cognition and
behavior, often imperceptibly. Thus, it may be that
factors exogenous of the actual dunk execution influ-
ence scoring.



J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC 227

1.5.1. Contestant popularity
NBA basketball is a commodity, as are activities

adjunct to it, such as the SDC. In addition to team
performance, the most popular NBA players increase
attendance at road games (Hausman and Leonard,
1997). They bolster gate revenues when visiting are-
nas (Berri and Schmidt, 2006), increase television
ratings, and were the impetus for sustained growth in
television contract revenues (Sarmento, 1998). Sep-
arately, heightened player status has been found to
engender favoritism in professional baseball umpires
(Mills, 2014) and accredited judges are prone to
award higher marks to figure skaters carrying a pos-
itive reputation (Findlay and Ste-Marie, 2004). We
suspect that popularity will influence judging in the
SDC, resulting in higher scores for greater popularity.

1.5.2. Home-status advantage
An advantage for competing at home has been

found in US women’s collegiate gymnastics scores
(Baghurst and Fort, 2008) and higher Olympic medal
counts have been observed for host-countries, par-
ticularly, in subjectively judged events (Balmer et
al., 2001). Reasonably, a SDC contestant performing
before his hometown fans may be emphatically her-
alded. In association football, heightened crowd noise
has been shown to influence officiating in favor of the
home team (Pope and Pope, 2015). SDC judges gen-
erally observe from the court proximal to the crowd
and as one 1987 judge remarked, “we have to, as
judges, desensitize ourselves from the crowd and not
let them affect us,” (Zeigler, 1988). Given this, we
suspect that dunk scores will be inflated for contes-
tants competing in their home city.

1.5.3. Histrionics
Three-time contestant Shawn Kemp noted in 1994,

“guys are starting to create a little more before the
dunk,” (Richardson, 1994; italics added). Perhaps
Kemp was referring to Dee Brown, whom he lost to in
the 1991 SDC final. Brown became inextricably asso-
ciated with the Reebok Pump sneaker by inflating the
sneakers before many dunks and later stated his inten-
tion “to get the crowd into it.” (Moore, 1991) This sort
of premeditated extradunking activity, which we term
histrionics, typically exerts no direct influence on the
execution of a dunk. Unnecessarily ornate passes per-
formed by individuals other than the contestant were
identified as histrionic.

Indeed, there is much subjectivity in identi-
fying histrionics. 1986 SDC winner Spud Webb
stood 170.18cm. Historically, basketball, and dunk-

ing especially, were reserved for taller people. Webb’s
stature may have garnered a histrionic, underdog
effect albeit inadvertently. Consider also Gerald
Green in the 2007 SDC. Green’s teammate climbed
a ladder, placed a cupcake on the back of the rim,
and lit a candle anchored in the cupcake icing. At the
peak of his vertical jump, Green exhaled and extin-
guished the candle flame before dunking. Despite the
histrionics of a cupcake and lit candle, the procedure
was ultimately functional as it demonstrated Green’s
athleticism and enhanced the difficulty of his airborne
activities. Contrast the cases of Webb and Green with
the singing choir Blake Griffin staged in 2011 SDC.
To account for this, we included contestant height and
specified if histrionics was functional in the analysis.

In our observations, SDC commentators and
judges appear to respond positively to and encourage
histrionics. Some instances of functional histrion-
ics, however, seem to be less obvious (e.g., Dwight
Howard adhering a sticker high on the backboard
was awarded a 42) and other instances, blatant (e.g.,
Dwight Howard dunking on an elevated basket after
it was delivered to the court was awarded a 50).
Overall, casual observation suggests judges may fail
to register less obvious functional histrionics. We
hypothesize that the presence of histrionics will
increase dunk scores but functional histrionics will
have a negligible influence.

1.5.4. Dunk novelty
Numerous former winners have indicated there is

pressure to execute novel dunks. “How many differ-
ent dunks can you do?” pondered Dominique Wilkins
after winning the 1990 SDC (David, 1990). 2008 vic-
tor Dwight Howard contended in 2014 that “I think
people forget that every dunk has been done basically,
it’s not a lot of stuff you can really do,” but noted in
the same interview that, “there is some stuff I haven’t
shown,” (Harris, 2014). Inaugural SDC winner Larry
Nance speculated in 1998 that observers had become
inured “getting to see the same [dunks] over and
over,” (Jones, 1998). If the suspicions of contestants
are accurate, it may be that judges score novel dunks
more favorably. For example, sometime judge and
commentator Kenny Smith can be heard on numer-
ous broadcasts exclaiming, to the effect of, “show
me something I haven’t seen before!” Therefore, the
reuse of dunk elements could also result in reduced
scores. To test this hypothesis, a variable indicating
the number of prior instances of the elements in a
dunk was included.

2. Data

All NBA SDC 1984-2016 were reviewed using
unofficial but authentic footage primarily sourced
from YouTube. Because the intent was to record the
scores judged for each dunk, assign the elements of
each dunk to one or more categorical variables, and
evaluate how dunk elements influence scoring, secur-
ing footage of dunks and their scores was imperative.
When possible multiple videos posted by different
users were viewed for each dunk or cross-referenced
from NBA TV broadcasts and other licensed NBA
materials. In total, 682 dunks were identified. Dunks
without scores or footage were inherently ineligible.
Table 1 provides distributions of dunks by SDC year
as well as other pertinent information we refer to
throughout the text.

Footage of 36 dunks and the score of 1 dunk in
the 1992 final could not be secured leaving 645.
From 2009-13 dunks in the final rounds were not
judged and no dunks in 2012 and 2014 were judged.
Absent judged-scores, 38 dunks from these SDCs
were ineligible for analysis, leaving 607. In the 1994-
97 initial and in the 1995 final rounds, contestants
received a single score for several completed dunks.
The score for each completed dunk in these rounds is
unknowable, rendering 82 dunks ineligible for anal-
ysis, leaving 525.

In our observations, judges appeared to discrim-
inate little between the potential quality of scored
missed dunks (i.e., the dunk that judges scored was a
miss). Because of this, 58 missed dunks were also
excluded, leaving 467 eligible for analysis. Addi-
tionally, three dunks were excluded because there
was only a single legitimate instance of the prin-
cipal element, Vince Carter hanging on the rim by
his elbow-pit in the 2000 final. The other two were
failed replications of Carter’s elbow-hang maneu-
ver (Gerald Wallace, 2002; Richard Jefferson, 2003).
Although the latter two dunks were not missed, that is,
they would have counted as field goals in basketball,
the judges scored as though the dunks were missed,
in our estimation. This left a total of 464. Secondarily,
sequence was indiscernible for 32 dunks from SDCs
held in 1986, -88, and -92 because footage could not
be secured. These 32 dunks were ineligible, leaving
a total of 432 for the analysis of contest factors.

2.1. Interrater reliability

To ensure accuracy, dunk elements were identified
and recorded by two raters. The first author identified

all elements in all dunks eligible for analysis, twice.
The second author was enlisted as a rater, pro bono. At
the time, naïve to the study, but thereafter contributed
significantly to the project. The first author provided
the blinded rater an instructional text describing the
methods used to identify dunk elements which is
available on the ResearchGate page of the first author.
The blind rater was supplied 108 dunks selected at
random, with ≥ 2 per SDC. This many dunks were
needed to conclude that a Fleiss’ Kappa of 0.70 was
greater than 0.50 at the 0.05 alpha level, with 0.80
power.

3. Method

3.1. Dunk elements

To quantitate dunk elements for analysis, we par-
titioned the dunk into four manageable components.
First, there is a stage of pre-launch activity which
is described below and is followed by the launch,
which entails how a contestant becomes airborne
(exclusively by jumping in the SDC). Third, once
airborne, a variety of movements, or airborne activ-
ity, can be performed with or without possession of
the ball. Fourth, during even the most rudimentary
dunk, a controlled and possessed ball is manually
guided from above the horizontal plane of the basket
rim, into the basket. As the ball is guided downward
through the basket, the non-dorsal side of the hand(s)
(but potentially the arm(s), also) will contact the rim,
known hereafter as the finish.

Pre-launch activity, launching, airborne activity,
and finishing will always occur in sequence except for
additional dunking executed after the finish, without
returning to the substrate or hanging on the rim. Sup-
plementary Table 1 contains additional commentary
on the elements described below, including kines-
thetic descriptions of airborne activity. This content
is excluded for brevity but esoteric constructs vital to
the analysis are defined below. Table 2 names and pro-
vides distributions and levels of each dunk element
in the analysis.

3.1.1. Pre-launch activity
Pre-launch activity occurs prior to initiating a dunk

when various predetermined modifiers of airborne
activity are implemented, such as the coordination
of a pass. Passing was recorded if the contes-

the substrate). Four launch-distances were specified
including (distance from center of basket): none, key
circle (2.36m), lane line (2.44m), and free throw line
(4.19m). Distance was recorded if, for a one-footed
launch, the launch-foot was on or behind the line or,
for a two-footed launch, if the planted (back) foot was
entirely behind the line or less than half of it was on
and beyond the line.

3.1.2. Airborne activity
Airborne activity was delineated into primary

kinematics and kinematic modifiers, or primary and
modifier for brevity. Although primaries and mod-
ifiers have each spawned colloquial appellations of
dunks, we distinguished the two by a primary involv-
ing the maneuvering of a possessed ball (or the intent
to assume possession, as described below) whereas
modifiers can be performed with or without posses-
sion of the ball. By this system, two primaries cannot
be performed simultaneously with a single ball but
two primaries could be performed simultaneously
with one arm each controlling a ball—a multiple-ball
modifier.

However, a primary and a modifier can be executed
simultaneously. Likewise, multiple modifiers could
be executed simultaneously absent a primary (e.g., a
360◦ rotation while covering the eyes). The absence
of both a primary and a modifier can be thought of
as the most inanimate launch-then-finish dunk. Thus,
although one might refer to a 360◦ dunk colloquially
(i.e., with no primary), for empirical purposes, this

system would refer to it as a dunk with no primary
modified by a 360◦ rotation of gross anatomy.

3.1.2.1. Primary kinematics Ten primary kinemat-
ics were identified for the analysis. The majority
were ascribed common, colloquial appellations and
descriptions of others follow. Because there are 16
possible combinations of two primaries but only four
instances of multiple primaries in the data set, we
collapsed these into a single category. Tapping the
goal with the ball was defined as volitionally touch-
ing a possessed-ball to any component of the goal
while airborne, other than for the purposes of fin-
ishing. Reaching entails an exaggerated reaching of
the arm(s) to obtain possession of a ball (e.g., for
a pass) or when possessing the ball. The latter defi-
nition was applied parsimoniously, only to palpable
exaggeration of flexion or abduction of the arm(s).
Although the reach could justifiably be classified as a
modifier in this system, we classified it as a primary
because other primaries should not be simultaneously
executable if the reach is palpable.

3.1.2.2. Kinematic modifiers Nine modifiers were
identified. Because contestants’ intentions are largely
unknowable, leg-kicking was ascribed parsimo-
niously and only when it appeared intentional.
Limiter of trajectory refers to a contestant being
beneath some component of the goal while airborne.
For horizontal rotations of gross anatomy, if a con-
testant’s back was toward the goal as he launched,



230 J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC

and no additional discernible rotation occurred while
airborne, rotation was recorded as ‘none’.

Contestants vary in their arm extension, or angle
of extension of the elbow joint (toward a straight-
ened arm) on the double-pump, cradle, tomahawk,
and windmill primaries, which is representative of
athletic ability. We recorded if arm extension was
notably less than maximal. Although our method is
crudely subjective, the distinction is readily apparent
to a reasonable observer.

Swings were defined as premeditated or improvi-
sational appreciable maneuverings of the possessed
ball prior to initiating a primary (i.e., swinging occurs
first). Swings predominantly precede the cradle pri-
mary but our definition also accounts for appreciable
maneuverings of the ball prior to other primaries.
These instances are distinct of those same pri-
maries absent the maneuvering. For example, swings
included outstretching—but not reaching—to corral
an awry pass or a slight circumduction of the arm prior
to initiating a primary. Swings were distinguished
from reaches because the swinging motion is less pal-
pable, thus a primary may be initiated immediately
without impediment.

Touching goal with the hand entails touching any
component of the goal apparatus with the hand(s)
while airborne, other than for the purposes of finish-
ing, including slapping the backboard and grabbing
the rim. Grabbing the rim could interrupt the natu-
ral airborne trajectory and, potentially, provide some
advantage by delaying the descent, whereas slapping
the backboard would not. We believed this was too
granular for the analysis and settled on a combined
variable.

3.1.2.3. Finishing (& launching) We recorded if
dunks were finished with the back to the goal or if
his side was to the goal but he was facing away from
the goal (reverse finish). Launching was excluded
from this analysis to avoid granularity. However, its

core element is the launch employed, either one- or
two-footed.

3.1.3. Interrater reliability
Identifying and discretely classifying dunk ele-

ments is subjective. This is evident in Table 3
which contains the Cohen’s κ-coefficients and per-
cent agreement between the combinations of two sets
of dunks identified by the first author and the sub-
set identified by the second author. A preponderance
of weak κs bespeaks the subjectivity of classifying
dunk elements (McHugh, 2012). Our agreements on
the absence of a modifier produced inflated agree-
ment values. For instance, in the second and third
supracolumns of Table 3, 32 reverse finishes were
identified but we agreed on only 10 (32.3%) whereas
we agreed on 76 non-reverse finishes (77.6%).

These preliminary IRR fostered consensus clas-
sifications for the many dunks that we had initially
classified incongruently. The opportunity also arose
to more thoroughly define and delineate the elements.
For example, the 32.3% agreement on reverse fin-
ishes was due to an imprecise definition. JMB was
ascribing reverse finish using the definition provided
above. However, in the instructions supplied to ESR,
the latter scenario was only implied; back to the bas-
ket was emphasized, qualified by a gaze away from
the basket. Although the classification of elements
remained subjective, ultimately, the classification of
dunk elements included in the analysis were decided
upon conjointly.

3.2. Contest formatting

Year was included as a random effect to account for
random year to year variance in scores not explained
by other variables. To account for potential differ-
ences in how judges interpret scores, we examined
several possible variables including, for each dunk, a
sum of each judge’s prior exposure to all elements

found in that dunk; and for each SDC, counts of
judges who were current or former NBA players and
the counts of judges who were former SDC con-
testants. However, the sole variable that influenced
scores in the model was the sum of prior SDCs judged
by members of judging panel. That is, if, in a given
SDC, five judges had respectively judged 0, 0, 2, 4,
and 0 previous SDCs, then the judge experience value
for all dunks in that SDC would have been 6.

3.2.1. Rounds
Because some SDCs had three rounds and others

two, for SDCs with three rounds, we refer to the sec-
ond round as the middle round and the third as the
final. For SDCs with two rounds, we refer to the sec-
ond round as the final round in respect of the greater
stakes of the finale. The first round is always the
initial. Round entered the analysis as a categorical
variable with three levels: initial, middle, final.

3.2.2. Sequence
Given the differences of total contestants over the

years, we normalized contestant sequence-position
in each round of each SDC and computed it sepa-
rately for each set of overtime dunks within a round,
(position in sequence – 1) /(total dunks in round – 1).
The first position in sequence always equaled 0 and
the last position always equaled 1. A dummy vari-
able indicating if an initial round contestant won the
previous SDC was also included.

3.3. Superlatives

3.3.1. Home Status
Home-status was ascribed to dunks by contestants

who were a member of the team hosting the SDC
(e.g., Blake Griffin in 2011), played collegiately in the
hosting city or surrounding area (e.g., Blue Edwards
in 1992), or known to be a native of the hosting city
or surrounding area (e.g., Spud Webb in 1986). The
home-status variable was dummy coded.

3.3.2. Contestant popularity
Myriad operationalizations of NBA player popu-

larity exist in the literature (Berri and Schmidt, 2006,
Brown et al., 1991, Burdekin and Idson, 1991, Kian,
2009, Scott et al., 1985) but a continuous variable
was preferred as to capture year to year variation
for repeat contestants. We elected to use newspaper
article mentions because it satisfied the need for con-
sistent coverage from 1983 through present (i.e., all
SDCs).

For the 1988 through 2016 SDCs, NewsBank
Access World News database searches were per-
formed within the publication USA Today. Because
UST is unavailable digitally prior to 1 JAN 1987,
ProQuest searches of the New York Times and Lexus-
Nexus searches of the Washington Post were used
for 1984 through 1987 SDCs. The NBA mentions
string was: ‘NBA OR “national basketball associa-
tion” OR “N.B.A.”’. We searched for all mentions
within a date range from the day after the previ-
ous SDC through the day of a given SDC. For the
first SDC, that range included the 365 days prior.
Returned was the quantity of articles containing text
that matched the criteria. This value was considered
the total NBA mentions for a year (the value from
NYT and WP were summed for 1984-87).

Searches with ‘AND “ [contestant’s name]”’
appended to the NBA mentions string were per-
formed for each SDC date range. Contestants’ names
were searched in quotes to ensure only his exact name
would yield results. The values for each contestant in
each SDC was divided by the NBA total mentions for
that year, multiplied by 100, and used as the measure
of player popularity.

We also collected the publicly available NBA
All-Star team rosters to impute an ordinal All-Star
status variable (Basketball Reference). The 10 All-
Star starters, 5 for each NBA conference, are chosen
by fan votes and then head coaches from each confer-
ence select the players for the All-Star team benches.
Thus, being an All-Star starter indicates that a con-
testant is among 10 of the most popular players in a
season. The All-Star status variable indicated whether
a contestant was not an All-Star, was an All-Star
reserve, or was an All-Star starter in the year of a
SDC. We collected All-Star roster data, first, because
the variable provides a means to check the ecological
validity of newspaper mentions as a measure of player
popularity. That is, we expected contestants who were
All-Stars to have more mentions than those who were
not All-stars and All-Star starters to have more men-
tions than both. Second, if the newspaper mentions
were found to have substandard validity, All-Star sta-
tus was to be used as the popularity measure.

3.3.3. Histrionics
Dummy variables indicating whether histrionics

was present and whether the histrionics was func-
tional were included. Histrionics was ascribed to none
of Webb’s 1986 dunks. Instead, contestant height, in
inches, was also included as a continuous variable to
avert subjective misevaluations.



232 J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC

3.3.4. Dunk novelty
To quantitate dunk novelty, each dunk was given

a string label that included the primary and the fol-
lowing modifiers, only if present: baseline approach,
reverse finish, extent of rotation, launch distance,
limiter of trajectory, obstruction, multiple balls,
swinging, and if a pass was caught. For example,
a dunk with a windmill primary, a pass caught, and
reverse finish was labeled ‘windmill pass reverse’. All
prior instances of a dunk label were counted using all
645 dunks with footage because even dunks without
judge-awarded are observable. The resultant value
indicated the quantity of instances of airborne activ-
ity having occurred prior to a given dunk, including
in previous SDCs and earlier in the same contest.

3.4. Data analyses

All statistical analyses were completed using
the R v3.3.2 console. Figures were created using
ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and its extension, ggth-
emes (Arnold, 2013). For interrater reliability (IRR),
the kappa2() function in the irr() package was used to
compute Cohen’s Kappa values (Gamer et al., 2012).
The IRR consisted of the primary kinematic and mod-
ifiers carrying greater subjectivity: reverse finishes,
rotation, maximum vertical, leg-kicking, swinging,
and arm extension. Other modifiers such as dunking
multiple balls or catching a pass are comparatively
unequivocal.

A measure of dunk difficulty was sought and
derived in lieu of subjectively deciding which dunks
were more difficult than others. Because scores were
not used in this part of the analysis, all dunks with
available footage were included (n = 645) in the
derivation of a measure of dunk difficulty. First, we
visually inspected the proportions of instances of
each dunk element that had ≥ 1 attempt, ≥1 replace-
ment dunk, ≥1 of both, or was judged as a missed
dunk. The premise is straightforward: the more ath-
letic or difficult elements were expected to have
a higher likelihood of error in execution. Logistic
regression was used to evaluate this expectation. The
dependent variable was a dummy variable indicating
whether each dunk had > 1 attempt, >1 replacement,
or was judged as a miss. All dunk elements except
for the arm extension modifier were included as
independent variables. Arm extension was excluded
because visual inspection indicated that less-than-full
had a high proportion of errors that we reasoned were
related to something other than dunk difficulty. The
logistic regression model was used to predict proba-

bilities there would be an error for each of 645 dunks.
An optimal cut-off was identified (0.191) and used to
classify dunks as either ‘easier’ or ‘harder’.

Nonparametric regressions were conducted using
the npregbw(), npreg(), and npsigtest() functions
of the np package (v0.60-2; Hayfield and Racine,
2008), for bandwidth selection, model computation,
and significance testing, respectively. Least-squares
cross-validation was used to estimate fixed band-
widths for explanatory variables in local-linear
least-squares regressions (LL). To avoid potential
model misspecification due to the presence of local
minima, the cross-validation procedure was restarted
100 times. 399 IID bootstrap replications were used
to test significance of explanatory variables in LL
model.

Upperbounds for bandwidths are specified as: 2
SDs for continuous variables; (d – 1) /d for nominal
categorical variables, where d = levels; and 1 for ordi-
nal categorical variables. As a bandwidth approaches
zero, more weight is assigned to nearer values and less
weight to farther values. Conversely, as a bandwidth
approaches its upperbound, the difference in weights
diminishes. Thus, the LL will essentially ‘smooth
out’ or render irrelevant noninfluential explanatory
variables. Readers interested in a more thorough,
applied treatment of non-parametric regression using
the np package are directed elsewhere (Delgado et
al., 2014, Peiró-Palomino, 2016).

To test the validity of newspaper mentions as a
measure of contestant popularity, a generalized linear
mixed-effects model (GLMM) was conducted with
the glmer() function of the lme4 package (v1.1–12)
specifying a Poisson distribution (Bates et al., 2014).
Contestant mentions was the dependent variable and
it was offset by NBA mentions of the SDC year
(producing a proportion). The ordinal All-star status
variable entered as a fixed-effect. Year and contestant
entered as random-effects with random intercepts.
The cld() function in the lsmeans package (Lenth,
2016) was used to compute pairwise comparisons
between All-star statuses.

The examination of randomness in sequence had
two steps, whether popularity and home status influ-
ence sequence and whether those variables influenced
surviving the initial round. First, a simple linear
regression was conducted with a popularity and
home-advantage interaction as independent variables
and an alternative sequence variable as the depen-
dent. The alternative sequence variable was computed
using only the assigned position in the initial round
of each SDC, that is, whether a contested performed



J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC 233

first, second, third, etc. The alternative sequence vari-
able was normalized as (assigned position – 1) /(total
competitors in round – 1); the first contestant equaled
0 and the last contestant equaled 1. Second, a dummy
variable indicating whether a contestant survived the
initial round, or survived, was created as a proxy for
scores (as to include all initial round contestants).
SDCs 2012 and 2014 had only one round and the
winner was indicated as having progressed (indeed,
dunks were not scored by judges but the results
are unchanged if excluding these years). A logis-
tic regression was performed with survived as the
dependent; sequence and a popularity-home status
interaction were covariates.

To examine contest format and superlative vari-
ables, linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) were
conducted with the lmer() function of the lme4
package (v1.1–12; Bates et al., 2014). Functions
in the influence.ME (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2012)
and LMERConvenienceFunctions (Tremblay and
Ransijn, 2013) packages were used for LMM diag-
nostics. Tests of significance of fixed and random
effects in LMMs were computed using the lmerTest
(Kuznetsova et al., 2015) package. Confidence inter-
vals for coefficients were computed at the 95%-level
based on likelihood tests.

Figure 1 indicates that mean scores (white lines)
increase from the initial to the final round. Simple
regression slopes of score regressed onto the interac-
tion of sequence and round indicate that the effect of
sequence differs between rounds.1 Sequence, round,
and the interaction of the two entered the LMM as
fixed effects. The dummy variable indicating whether
a contestant won the previous SDC (hereafter, WPS)
and the WPS-sequence interaction entered as fixed
effects.

Raw counts of replacement dunks and attempts
for each dunk entered as fixed-effects. Judge experi-
ence, dunk novelty, contestant popularity and height,
and the dummy indicators for histrionics, functional
histrionics, and home-status entered the model as
fixed-effects. SDC year entered the model as a
random effect, as did contestants, due to repeated
measurements; both were set with random intercepts.
Score was the dependent variable, offset by the fitted
values from the LL model to control for the influence
of dunk elements.

1 The interaction of round and sequence yield slightly improved
goodness-of-fit over the main effects alone, R2 = 0.105 compared
to R2 = 0.099.

Fig. 1. SDC Mean Scores ±1 SD by Round with effect of sequence
superimposed. Differentiation between 2− and 3-round SDCs was
only recognized after the analysis was complete. Hence, the anal-
ysis is based on the interaction of sequence × round whereas the
figure suggests an interaction of sequence × round × total rounds
is appropriate. The points are jittered to prevent overplotting, the
points neither differentiate between SDC rounds nor correspond
to sequence. Black lines are trend lines of scores regressed onto
sequence × round, which yielded slightly improved fit over the
main effects of each alone, R2 = 0.105 compared to R2 = 0.099.
The trendlines are superimposed such that the leftmost point of
each line is the first position in sequence and the rightmost point
of each line is the last position in sequence. White line bisect-
ing bars represents mean and the bars correspond to ±1 standard
deviation in score.

4. Results

4.1. Dunk elements

Figure 2A was plotted to inspect the proportions
of each primary and modifier with at least one
replacement dunk, attempt, or that was a judged
missed dunk. Interestingly, dunks with less-than-full
extension had a higher proportion of attempts and
replacements. This suggests contestants might have
become fatigued after repeated misses and were less
able to achieve full extension or that they became
warry of committing another error and extended less
to increase the likelihood of successfully dunking.
Similarly, dunks with obstructions and limiters of tra-
jectory plausibly are more difficult because airborne
contestants must avoid colliding with an obstruction
or the underside of the goal, respectively. However,
in lieu of subjectively evaluating difficulty, logistic

Fig. 2. The X-axis of Panel A represents the proportion of all dunks with a given Primary or Modifier that required ≥1 attempt, replacement
dunk, ≥1 of each, or a missed dunk that was scored. The Y-Axis of Panel A is sorted by total proportion of a given Primary or Modifier
that required any of the four. The X-axis of Panel B represents the proportion of a given Primary or Modifier that was classified as easier or
harder using logistic regression. The Y-Axis of Panel B corresponds to the Primary or Modifier, with the count of each that was classified as
easier (left) or harder (right).

regression was used to predict probabilities and clas-
sify each dunk as easier or harder. The classifications
of primaries and modifiers are shown in Fig. 2B.

Overall, harder dunks (M = 45.8, SD = 3.77)
were scored significantly higher than easier dunks
(M = 44.99, SD = 3.88), t(386.5)=2.23, p = 0.03.
Although some of the more athletic modifiers were
less frequently classified as harder, the disparity is
justifiable. For instance, dunks from the freethrow
line were largely classified as easier likely because
they were typically basic primaries without other
modifiers. That is, assuming a contestant can leap
the necessary distance, there is a reduced risk of error
because those dunks were generally free of additional

airborne activity. Likewise, dunks with passes reason-
ably require more attempts due to the triangulation
and coordination necessary to locate and possess the
ball in space while airborne. Summarily, the findings
presented in Fig. 2 are interpreted as evidence that
some dunk elements are harder to execute success-
fully than others, dunks with harder elements receive
higher scores, and the objectively measured difficulty
of elements are in line with our expectations.

All dunk element variables were included as
explanatory variables with judge-awarded dunk
scores as the dependent variable in the LL. Bandwidth
estimates appear in Table 4 along with the upper-
bound for each variable. Figure 3 contains the partial

vant modifiers held constant and how each modifier

The results of the LL indicate that primary kine-

extension, approaching from the baseline, covering
the eyes, limits of trajectory, and jumping from a
distance are explanatorily relevant to judge awarded
dunk scores. That these variables are also statistically
significant at or near conventional significance lev-
els, tends to support our hypotheses. Leaping over
obstructions and leg-kicking could be irrelevant ele-
ments in SDC judge awarded dunk scores given that
the bandwidths for the variables are essentially equal
to the upperbounds. Other modifiers, however, such
as maximum verticality and swings appear to be
relevant but not statistically significant. The distinc-
tion between relevance and significance is important.
For example, excluding baseline approach, leg kick-
ing, and limited trajectory from the model yields an
R2 = .441 whereas excluding all explanatory variables
with p > 0.10 yields an R2 = .356 (each with 10 restarts
of cross-validation procedure).

4.2. Validity of popularity measure

From 1984-2016, 118 NBA players comprised 178
contestant-spots in SDCs. Of those 178, 27 were All-
stars, 12 were All-star starters, and the remainder
were not All-stars. The raw mean of popularity was
2.33 (SD = 2.38, range 0 to 12.82). The quantity of
newspaper mentions for each SDC contestant was the
dependent variable in a GLMM, offset by the quantity
of NBA newspaper mentions for a given SDC year.
All-star status was a fixed effect. Contestant and year
were random effects with random intercepts. Model
summary appears in Table 5 and indicates that news-
paper mentions increase such that non-All-stars are
mentioned in 1.1% of NBA articles, All-stars in 1.9%,

and All-star starters in 2.5% of articles pertaining
to the NBA when accounting for year and contes-
tant (and holding NBA mentions constant). All-star
starters (z = 7.3, p < 0.001) and All-stars (z = 6.9,
p < 0.001) were mentioned in significantly more arti-
cles than non-All-stars, and All-star starters more
than All-stars, z = 2.3, p = 0.062. We interpreted this
as evidence that proportional contestant newspaper
mentions were an acceptably valid measure of con-
testant popularity.

4.3. Randomness of sequence

As stated, from 1984-2016 there were 178
contestant-spots in SDCs. Of those, 175 were
sequenced in an initial round, 15 of which had
home status. Additionally, sequence for 7 contestant-
spots was indeterminable leaving 168 for analysis,
14 with home status. The regression indicates vari-
ance in initial round sequence was poorly explained
by contestant popularity (b = 0.002, p = 0.841), hav-
ing home advantage (b = 0.011, p = 0.929), and the
interaction of the two (b = 0.028, 033 p = 0.395),
R2 = 0.01, F(3, 114)=0.572, p = 0.63). However, a
trend of more popular home contestants being posi-
tioned later in sequence is evident in Supplementary
Figure 1, as is a very popular home outlier positioned
mid-sequence (R2 = 0.03, p = 0.14 and significant
interaction when outlier is excluded). This finding
suggests that sequence might have been coordinated
such that more popular contestants with home sta-
tus were positioned later in sequence in SDC initial
rounds. However, the aim of the study is examining
how these factors influence scoring.

A logistic regression had the survive dummy as
the dependent variable with sequence as well as
an interaction between popularity and home sta-
tus as covariates. The logistic model indicates that
sequence was a significant predictor of surviving the
initial round (z = 3.09, p = 0.002) whereby performing
last carried a 0.97 probability of surviving whereas
performing in the middle was 0.48 and perform-
ing first was 0.31. Popularity (z = 0.829, p = 0.407),
home status (z = –0.603, p = 0.547), nor the interac-
tion (z = 0.661, p = 0.509) were significant predictors.
We interpret these results to mean that, whether
or not sequence was coordinated around popular
and home status contestants, it appears that if such
coordination occurred, judging in initial rounds was
influenced by sequence more so than the superlative
variables.

4.4. Format & superlatives

As seen in Table 1, attempts and replacements
dunks increased as time progressed, due to changes
in SDC rules. Fourteen SDC winners competed in the
following SDC and completed 30 dunks in the initial
rounds. Fifteen contestants with home status com-
pleted 60 dunks in 11 SDCs. The average and median
height of SDC contestants was 78in (SD = 3.61) with
a range of 66in to 88in. Sixteen dunks were iden-
tified as having histrionics, five of which were also
functional. Regarding dunk novelty, dunks had been
executed an average of 6.66 (SD = 10.84) times prior.
The average judge experience of each panel was 7.14
(SD = 6.26) prior SDCs judged.

Offset by the fitted values from the dunk ele-
ments LL, judge awarded dunk scores were the
dependent variable in a LMM. All the contest for-
mat and superlative variables described earlier were
fixed effects. Year and contestant were random effects
with random intercepts. No violations of normality
or homoscedasticity were evident following visual
inspection of the LMM residuals plotted against the
fitted values, other than precisely truncated scat-
ter in the upper right quadrant which is plausibly
attributable to the maximum possible dunk score of
50. Likewise, the linearity of each fixed effect was
evident in plots of profile zeta functions.

Fifty-six potentially influential observations were
identified using a Cook’s distance cutoff of 4/432
(0.009); the quantity influential for each fixed effect
appears in Table 6 and many were potentially
influential over multiple fixed effects. All poten-
tially influential observations occurred in 2009 and
after. The estimates most effected by exclusion are
those for attempts and replacement dunks. Attempts
and replacements began increasing in the mid-
2000s. Thus, the influence of these observations is
attributable to regulatory and participatory changes
over time (as opposed to measurement or model
specification). We have no reason to exclude these
observations on ecological grounds but do acknowl-
edge their statistical influence and include a summary
of the model without these cases in Table 6.

Attempts were significant predictors of lower
scores (replacements approached significance). The
interaction between WPS and sequence was not sig-
nificant, indicating the effect of sequence on scores
is independent of the initial round positioning of
the previous SDC winner. Compared to the initial
round, dunks yielded significantly higher scores in
the middle and final rounds, the difference for each

approaching two points. The interaction between
sequence and round was significant for the initial
round, the final round approached significant, and
was not significant for the middle round. Figure 4
contains the estimated marginal mean dunk scores
by sequence, for each round (Lenth, 2018).

A significant home advantage equivalent to a one-
point increase in scores was found. Dunk scores
increased as popularity increased. The effect of
contestant height trended toward significance, with
scores increasing as height decreased such that a con-
testant of 208.28cm of height would receive about
∼1 point less for the same dunk completed by a con-
testant of 182.88cm. The presence of histrionics was
significant, imparting a 2.7-point advantage, but there
was no effect of the functionality of the histrionics.
Dunk novelty had a significant effect of decreasing
scores. A dunk that had been done 20 times before
could be expected to lose ∼0.50 point. Judge experi-
ence approached significance also, reducing scores.

4.5. Post-hoc examination of scoring in rounds
and dunking prowess

Although the LMM indicates that dunks generally
receive higher scores in the middle and final rounds,

Fig. 4. Estimated Marginal Mean Scores in Sequence by Round.

it is unclear what is driving this difference. It may be
that contestants with greater dunking prowess gen-
erally survive to later rounds. However, it may also
be that judges award higher scores in later rounds
because they expect that scores should be greater
as contests progress. Post-hoc analyses were under-
taken to better understand the differences in scoring
between rounds.

Using all dunks with available footage and the
easier/harder dichotomous variable discussed ear-
lier (see §4.1), the proportion of harder dunks made



238 J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC

(i.e., not missed dunks) in the initial round of each
SDC was computed for each contestant. The logistic
regression used to evaluate randomness of sequence
(see §4.3) was recomputed with this proportion
included as a covariate. The effect of dunk difficulty
on surviving the initial round trended toward signifi-
cance (�=0.641, p = 0.131), otherwise the model was
virtually unchanged. The effect of difficulty would be
such that a contestant had a 50% likelihood of sur-
vival if he had zero harder dunks and a 58% likelihood
if half of his dunks were difficult.

Scores of all made dunks from initial rounds in
all SDCs were then regressed onto an interaction
between the easier/harder variable and a yes/no indi-
cator of surviving, with contestant as a random effect.
This LMM indicated that harder dunks were scored
higher (�=1.686, p < 0.001) and surviving contestants
produced higher scores (�=3.643, p < 0.001) but the
interaction was nonsignificant (p = 0.242). Pairwise
comparisons adjusted with Tukey’s method indicated
that survivors were rated 4.04 points higher on eas-
ier dunks and ∼3 points higher on harder dunks
(ps < 0.001) compared to nonsurvivors. For nonsur-
vivors, harder dunks were scored significantly higher
than their easier dunks (p = 0.01). Importantly, eas-
ier dunks done by survivors were scored ∼1.9 points
higher than the harder dunks done by nonsurvivors
(p = 0.018). Dunk difficulty appears to be negligi-
bly influential on surviving the initial round because
contestants who survived produced higher scores on
easier and harder dunks, suggesting greater dunking
prowess.

Data were then subsetted to include only made
dunks from participants who survived the initial
round (n = 319). That is, made dunks from all rounds
in each SDC by all contestants who survived the ini-
tial round in each SDC. Easier/harder dunk was the
dependent variable regressed onto the interaction of
round and a categorical variable indicating whether
that year the SDC had two or three rounds. Harder
dunks were more likely to be executed in 2-round
SDCs (β=1.53, p = 0.003) than 3-round SDCs. The
interaction was not significant and there was no round
effect. Pairwise comparisons showed that there were
no differences between rounds within 2- and 3-round
SDCs (ps > 0.95). This demonstrates that, among the
more skilled dunkers, the difficulty of dunks has
increased through the history of the SDC but there
are no differences in dunk difficulty between rounds
within eras.

The LMM of superlatives performed in §4.4 was
recomputed with this subset of the data (n = 291 eli-

gible); but functional histrionics was dropped due to
there being no instances of it in the subset. Scores did
not significantly differ between rounds (ps > 0.36),
which would suggest that the effect of higher scores
in later rounds is plausibly attributable to lower scores
for contestants who did not survive the initial rounds.
Effects of attempts and replacements (ps > 0.40),
sequence (p = 0.34), dunk novelty (p = 0.39), and
home advantage (p = 0.11) were no longer signifi-
cant. Popularity and histrionics remained significant,
with similar effects on scores, and judge experience
significantly decreased scores (� = –0.09, p = 0.03).

Lastly, an interaction between round and the cat-
egorical variable indicating whether a SDC had two
or three rounds was included in the post-hoc superla-
tives LMM. Pairwise comparisons indicate that the
average final round score was 1.32 points higher than
that of initial rounds in 3-round SDCs (p = 0.03);
middle rounds trended toward having higher average
scores,+0.91, than initial rounds (p = 0.16). How-
ever, the difference between final and initial rounds
in 2-round SDCs, although –0.69 points, was non-
significant (p = 0.63). Effects of other variables were
comparable to the first post-hoc superlatives LMM
(see Supplementary Table 2). Because dunk difficulty
for superior dunkers was not different between rounds
within either type of SDC, this suggests that scores
were inflated in the final rounds of 3-round SDCs but
not 2-round SDCs.

5. Discussion

Analyzed in the present study were factors that
influence SDC dunk scores. The primary airborne
kinematic and six (of 14) modifiers were found to
relevantly influence scores, generally in line with
the reports of former contestants and our hypothe-
ses. Sequence, round, and dunk attempts influenced
scores as hypothesized, but the more nuanced effect
of round is addressed below. Lesser dunk novelty
and greater prior judge experience were both found
to reduce scores. Heightened contestant popularity,
having home-status, and engaging in histrionics each
increased scores when controlling for dunk elements
and other factors. Tertiarily, newspaper mentions
were found to be an acceptably valid predictor of
contestant popularity.

5.1. Elements

Preliminary analyses revealed that more athletic
dunk elements had higher proportions of errors of



J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC 239

execution. Using an aggregate indicator of error,
logistic regression generally classified the more diffi-
cult dunk elements accordingly, and in line with our
expectations. Despite this, and that harder dunks aver-
aged higher scores than easier dunks, the measure
of dunk difficulty cannot capture all the nuances of
elements and misses subtle differences in difficulty
between the execution of elements in different dunks.
This shortcoming could be overcome in future stud-
ies by objectively measuring the airborne activity of
dunk elements.

The LL supported the hypotheses regarding pri-
maries and modifiers. Although the more athletic
primaries such as behind-the-back and between-the-
legs were generally scored higher than others when
controlling for modifiers, pairwise comparisons were
not performed. The model expected more athletic
modifiers such as 360◦ rotations of gross anatomy and
launching from the free throw line to increase scores
by two or more points for most primaries. Likewise,
lesser extension of the arms considerably reduced
scores for the cradle, double-pump, and windmill
primaries (but it actually increased for tomahawks).
Taken together, these findings indicate that execut-
ing more athletically-demanding elements increases
scores in the SDC.

However, in ordinary least-squares terms, the dunk
elements model accounted for less than half of the
variance in dunk scores. Some variation may be due,
in part, to there being fewer scheduled dunks and the
use of fan votes (instead of judging) that restricted
sample sizes for many of the elements that emerged
or became more prevalent after 2000. Alternatively,
factors we did not measure such as judges’ angle of
observation (Dallas et al., 2011) or inflated scores
for more difficult elements irrespective of the quality
of execution (Morgan and Rotthoff, 2014) may be at
play. Nonetheless, the model appears to support the
system we used to classify the dunk elements. The
raw mean score awarded for dunks with the basic
kinematic is 44.45 whereas the LL estimated it to
be 38.5 in the absence of modifiers (the least of all
primaries), indicating that the execution of modifiers
contributes considerably to scores of dunks ascribed
the basic kinematic.

Although the elements are observable, the system
used to identify dunk elements remains imprecise
and subjective. Regarding imprecision, for exam-
ple, the swing modifier most commonly precedes
the cradle kinematic; however, swinging was given
broader applicability in the analysis. Using swing-
ing to account for appreciable maneuverings of the

ball prior to initiating any primary kinematic may
have adulterated how swinging behaved in the model.
This system also provides little objective measure
(e.g., distance and rotation are semi-quantitative) as
to the degree of difficulty or athleticism necessary
to complete a dunk element. Therefore, concerning
subjectivity, a matter for future study is examining
quantifiable, objective measurements that correspond
to athletic ability or difficulty such as measurement
of airborne anatomical motions (e.g., length of the
arc of ball movement during a windmill) or the
duration of the goal shaking after finishing (as a
proxy for dunk power). Notably, the present finding
that contestants of shorter stature tend to be scored
higher than their taller counterparts suggests that the
duration of hangtime prior to finishing is also a tar-
get for objective measurement (Harding and James,
2010).

More broadly, this system of identifying dunk ele-
ments may also be confounded because it requires
every element be assigned to a discrete class. This is
highly subjective and, as indicated in Table 3, prone
to inconsistent application between raters. For exam-
ple, a John Starks dunk in 1992 was initially viewed
as a double-pump with less-than-full arm extension
by the first author but as reaching by the second
author (our consensus was reaching). If standardized
dunk contest scoring protocols were implemented
by a governing body, competition could be unduly
influenced by this or a similar nominal system of
classifying elements. One concern is discrete classes
might portend intuitive score-ranges that could out-
weigh the assessment of the airborne activity that was
observed. Imagine the present authors were judg-
ing this 1992 John Starks dunk. JMB may have
awarded a lower score simply because he ascribed
‘less-than full extension’ (implying less athleticism)
whereas ESR may have awarded a higher score to
Starks for outstretching to catch the ball (implying
greater athleticism)—for what is the same anatom-
ical motion. Another concern is the use of classes
could restrict creativity by compelling contestants to
utilize only dunk elements listed in a regulatory doc-
ument. Thus, future operationalizations in empirical
study and protocols of competition should strive to
objectively quantify airborne activity.

5.2. Format

The LMM indicated that dunk scores decreased
as the judging experience of the judges increased.
Scores are estimated to be reduced ∼0.25 point when



240 J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC

the judging panel has judged 3 previous SDCs com-
bined. In line with the finding that dunk novelty
slightly increased scores, this suggests that scores are
slightly lowered when judges have observed more
dunks. The present findings cannot directly inform
whether this is due to judges’ preference for novel
dunks or whether they become more discriminate in
their evaluation and scoring of dunks. If judges do
become more discriminate in scoring with increasing
experience, we might expect judges’ prior exposure to
all elements found in a dunk to affect its scores. How-
ever, a variable measuring this sort of exposure was
discarded from the model due to its lack of influence
(even when considering polynomic terms and dunk
novelty was excluded) and judge experience reduced
scores in the post-hoc model using data from contes-
tants with greater dunking prowess. It appears that
judges grant higher scores for novel dunks, which is
in line with our conclusions below about their pref-
erence for excitement. If additional individual-level
judge scoring data were obtained (i.e., pre-2000), this
could be further teased apart by examining how each
judge scores in the presence of various elements,
when controlling for novelty.

5.2.1. Rounds
As indicated in Fig. 1, SDC scores increased and

the variability of scores tended to decrease from the
initial to the final round. The distinction between
SDCs with 2- or 3-rounds seen in Fig. 1 was only
recognized after analysis and was addressed post-hoc
using a subset of dunks by contestants with ostensibly
greater dunking prowess. post-hoc analyses indicated
that, among superior dunkers, there were no differ-
ences in dunk difficulty between rounds within 2-
and 3-round SDCs. Dunks were comparably diffi-
cult across rounds among superior contestants and so
scores should have also been comparable. However,
scores were significantly greater in the final than in
the initial rounds of 3-round SDCs but not 2-round
SDCs. Later-round biases have been documented in
aesthetic sports with more rigorous protocols (Lee,
2004, Leskošek et al., 2010) and our findings sug-
gest that such a bias was present in earlier SDCs
but subsequently diminished. Thus, at least in recent
years, it appears judges are appropriately awarding
scores across rounds and the round effects reported in
§4.4 are likely due to lower scores of contestants who
did not survive the initial rounds rather than inflated
scores in later rounds.

The diminution of later round score inflation over
time may be attributable to changes in contest pro-

cedures. For example, reducing the quantities of
contestants, rounds, and dunks per round resulted in
judges scoring fewer dunks while an increase in dunk
difficulty occurred in parallel. Fewer contestants may
have served to restrict entry to more elite dunkers.
Having fewer opportunities would have allowed con-
testants to execute harder dunks in the repertoires that
they otherwise might have reserved if there were more
required dunks in the initial rounds. If so, the number
of less impressive dunks would also be limited. Given
that there were fewer dunks and those dunks were
generally more difficult, the effects of dunk novelty
within contests could also have led to the diminution
of later-round score inflation. Accounting explicitly
for within-SDC novelty could be used to address that
matter going forward. Future study could also more
thoroughly examine scoring across rounds by con-
sidering factors such as aggregated popularity of all
contestants or competitiveness of the contest (e.g.,
measured by win probabilities).

5.2.2. Sequence
As hypothesized and in line with previous research

on subjective judgments (de Bruin, 2006, Li and
Epley, 2009, Morgan and Rotthoff, 2014, Page
and Page, 2010, Wilson, 1977), higher scores were
awarded to dunks later in sequence, especially for the
initial round where the last dunk yielded a 1.69-point
advantage over the first. This effect was indepen-
dent of the most-previous SDC winner being the last
contestant in the initial round as well as the other
superlative variables. The difference between first
and last dunk was < 0.50-point and not significant in
the middle and final rounds. However, we did not con-
trol for the position of the highest scorer from one
round to the next, within contests, as he was often
positioned last.

Also, within rounds, all contestants completed
their first dunk in order, their second dunk in the
same order, and so on, but sequence at this level of
ordering was not directly accounted for in the analy-
sis. However, consider the current SDC format which
features four contestants, each with two dunks in the
initial round. With all else held constant, the LMM
predicts that the fifth dunk in the initial round car-
ries a 1-point advantage over the first dunk—even
though the fifth and first dunks would be performed
by the same contestant. This is interpreted to show
that judges award higher scores later in the sequence
of the initial round, but sequence appears to be min-
imally influential in the middle and final rounds.
This is perhaps due to contestants in later rounds



J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC 241

exhibiting generally exhibiting greater dunk prowess,
as indicated by our post-hoc analyses. Nevertheless,
sequence effects could be further assessed in future
analyses by accounting for possible influence exerted
on the score of a dunk by the previous dunk, an effect
detected in other subjectively evaluated competitions
(Page and Page, 2010).

Additionally, a preliminary analysis of sequence
revealed the possibility that sequence was coordi-
nated around popular contestants with home status;
that is, potentially undermining the assumption that
sequence was random. We did not account for this
possibility in the LMM because a subsequent analy-
sis indicated that a contestant’s surviving the initial
round was significantly predicted by sequence but not
the superlative variables. Thus, it seemed SDC judges
were sufficiently impervious to any coordination of
sequence, if it occurred. Additionally, the approxi-
mate correlation between coefficients of popularity
and home status in the LMM r = –0.03 suggests that,
if some sample of other dunks were also included in
the model, the coefficient of the two variables could
change irrespective of one another. However, this
conclusion is made tentative by the limited instances
of home status.

5.2.3. Replacements & attempts
Scores decreased by ∼1 point for every three

replacement dunks or attempts prior to completing
the dunk that was scored by judges. We based our
hypothesis on prior research and posited that SDC
contestants may be ‘choking’ under increased pres-
sure to dunk successfully following one or more
failures. Although ‘choking’ remains a plausible
explanation, we speculate this finding may also be
due to the loss of novelty or lowered excitement,
corresponding with our conclusions about histri-
onics, described below. Boring stimuli have been
shown to reduce favorability ratings (Leary et al.,
1986) and, perhaps, repeated attempts or replace-
ments bored judges, resulting in lower scores. Also,
replacements may attenuate scores because a dunk
could be revealed in a replacement or attempt (unless
the next attempt is different), akin to a ‘spoiler’ (Ben-
ton and Hill, 2012, Tsang and Yan, 2009), which is
in line with our finding that dunk novelty increases
and judge experience decreases scores. Alternatively,
it may be that contestants resorted to less impressive
dunks after repeated attempts and replacements. This
was not accounted for in the present study but should
be addressed in the future.

5.3. Superlatives

5.3.1. Home status
A significant, ∼1-point advantage was found for

contestants at their home site when controlling for
dunk elements, contest formatting, and other superla-
tives. Prior studies have shown that competing before
a home or supportive crowd can enhance performance
(Greer, 1983) and an oppositional crowd can inhibit
performance (Lefebvre and Passer, 1974, cf., Butler
and Baumeister, 1998). In reviewing footage, how-
ever, the one instance we saw of the crowd outright
booing a contestant was attributable to prior com-
ments Clyde Drexler made about that team (Shirk,
1985). A performance enhancing effect may then be
inapplicable since SDC crowds typically cheer fol-
lowing every dunk and even before the dunk when
encouraged by contestants. Applying objective mea-
surements of athletic ability such as duration of
hangtime would allow future research to better dis-
cern if athletic performance is enhanced at the home
site or if contestants at their home site merely garner
in inflated scores.

5.3.2. Contestant popularity
Greater contestant popularity increased scores

such that a contestant of median popularity would
receive an advantage of about 0.25-point over the
least popular contestants but those at and above the
90th percentile of popularity would receive an advan-
tage of about 1- to 2.39-points. This finding evidenced
when controlling for dunk elements, formatting, and
the other superlatives. It may be that this inflation
of scores is exclusively the result of the popularity.
However, it is also conceivable that the most popular
contestants exhibit athletic abilities or other qualities
that led to their heightened popularity as NBA play-
ers and that those abilities or qualities translate to the
SDC in a way that is apparent to judges but is uncap-
tured by the system used to classify dunk elements.
That is, for example, Michael Jordan jumped higher
than most players and this facilitated his success as
a basketball player and in the SDC. This could be
disentangled with the application of more objective
measurement of dunk elements.

5.3.3. Histrionics
The presence of histrionics was found to inflate

scores when controlling for dunk elements and con-
test formatting. A common histrionic act is the
tributary uniform alteration whereby contestants don
the jerseys of former, often revered NBA players. This



242 J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC

may indicate a belief that the uniform will enhance
performance (Lee et al., 2011) or that positive regard
for the revered player will transfer to the contes-
tant and influence judging (Langmeyer and Walker,
1991). Other instances of histrionics correspond to
the latter, such as involving a celebrity when a team-
mate would suffice (e.g., to throw a pass), but neither
rationale explains contestants introducing histrionics
such as the presence of a singing choir or effervescing
cheerleaders.

Ultimately, a desire to induce excitement appears
to underlie histrionics. A more inclusive explanation
for the use of histrionics then is excitation transfer
(ET). ET occurs when a stimulus arouses the auto-
nomic nervous system (ANS) and the residual of that
arousal influences the emotional response to a subse-
quent, unrelated stimulus. For instance, attractiveness
ratings of potential mates are heightened following
ANS arousal induced via exercise (White et al., 1981)
or a roller coaster ride (Meston and Frohlich, 2003).
Although this is a matter for future study, if we apply
the ET theory to the SDC, histrionics would excite
judges, who then award inflated scores.

If our interpretation of histrionics is accurate, then
histrionics may benefit the SDC, the contestants,
and the NBA. That is, histrionics might enhance the
promotional utility of or interest in the SDC. For
example, future research might examine if histrionics
in one SDC increases fan interest in the following or
if histrionics helps boost the contestant’s popularity.

5.4. Shortcomings

The SDC is an exhibition held during All-Star
Weekend, a time many NBA players reserve for
rest. Although it potentially boosts brand exposure
(Blount, 1987, Nathan, 1991, Aschburner, 1995), the
SDC in no way affects basketball rankings, other
than the risk of injury and how an injury might
impact team success. SDC outcomes may then be
subject to certain exhibitory trivialities compared to
a dunk contest motivated exclusively by intrinsic ath-
letic competitiveness. We are not insinuating that
SDC outcomes might be marginalized; rather that,
NBA players likely and appropriately train to max-
imize basketball skills whereas dunking specialists
would likely train to maximize dunking skills. Thus,
it remains to be seen if the methods and findings of
this study are applicable to dunk contests involving
dunking specialists.

Given the number of variables employed in the
analysis, the SDC offers a relatively small data set.

The small n could undermine many of the conclusions
we have drawn, particularly those regarding the dunk
elements. This latter point can be addressed if future
study distills airborne activity into a few continuous
and categorical variables that are measurable to some
extent in the movements of any primary or modi-
fier. However, despite the relatively small data set,
the LMM was relatively unchanged when 56 dunks
were excluded due to potential statistical influence.

Also, given the significant effects of several
superlative factors, we cannot assume that scoring
procedures were consistently implemented through-
out SDC history. We do know that the procedure of
determining a winner has changed because viewers
voted for the winning contestant in some SDCs. That
is, the SDC has been used as a promotional vehicle
(Nelson, 1995, Latimer, 1994) and the NBA is a com-
modity of competitive entertainment. Therefore, it is
not unimaginable that judges could be encouraged by
SDC organizers to evaluate dunks in a way that maxi-
mizes entertainment value or could bolster status of a
contestant. Likewise, irrespective of encouragement,
it may be that judges, like fans, are excited by the SDC
and their capacity for subjectivity is reduced—this
corresponds to our conclusions about histrionics.

5.5. Applicability

Our findings could be of immediate value for SDC
contestants. Consider the 2017 SDC: Aaron Gor-
don used three replacement dunks while attempting
to catch a ball that bounced from the floor after
being dropped from a high hovering drone. First, the
histrionics of a drone are expected to garner + 2.76
points for whichever dunk he performed as well as
some amount of additional points for catching a pass
‘from’ the drone. Second, Gordon was attempting the
between-the-legs airborne kinematic which requires
greater athleticism and coordination than other pri-
maries, i.e., increased risk for error. Third, by using
three replacement dunks, Gordon’s score would be
expected to decrease by ∼1 point. The between-
the-legs kinematic has an average score of 47 when
controlling for other dunk elements whereas, say, the
windmill kinematic is 44.9 and demands less ath-
leticism. If we are willing to imagine that Gordon
successfully dunks a windmill on his first try, with no
replacements, and all else is unchanged, we expect
his score to be ∼48.5 whereas with a between-the-
legs with three attempts we would expect it to be
∼49. Thus, the reward of a higher expected score for
the between-the-legs is not only limited by the max-



J.M. Barber and E.S. Rollins / Factors influencing scoring in the NBA SDC 243

imum possible score of 50 but is also diminished by
its difficulty.

Less publicized dunk contests will be staged at
a secondary school pep rallies or broadcasted on
network television in fringe time slots. Ideally, the
findings reported herein are applicable to contestants
in those dunk contests, too. Aside from the potential
applicability of the foregoing anecdote (i.e., perform
creditable dunks one can execute successfully on
the first try), the totality of the findings indicates
that judges respond positively to excitement that sur-
rounds a given dunk. The influence of excitement
on judging may be acceptable or even preferable
in exhibitory dunk contests. However, if the dunk
contest is to ever become a standalone, sanctioned,
athletic competition then the influence of excitement
on judging will need to be addressed.

Additionally, the present findings demonstrate the
usefulness of newspaper mentions as a measure of
popularity for NBA players. Summarily, although
more precise and objective methods of quantifying
the dunk elements is appropriate for future analy-
sis of the SDC, and dunk contestants in general, the
present study is the first to analyze the dunk contest
while also contributing to the literature on subjective
judging in aesthetic sports.

Acknowledgments

This research was made possible by Morehead
State University and University of Kentucky hosting
resources necessary for completion. We would thank
the reviewers for taking their time to provide us with
insightful critiques. Their insights into round-order
effects, randomness of sequence, and the potentially
confounding effects of dunk novelty and judge expe-
rience, as well as other insight, produced an enhanced
manuscript.
