Abstract. The utilisation of performance criteria to determine power rankings of various teams is useful for a vast number
of audiences in many traditional sports, such as soccer, football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and the like. With market
hyper-competition and viewership growth in the digital sector of eSports and related professional video gaming, the usage
of performance evaluation in the scholarly literature is relatively scant. Thus, the current study provides a performance
assessment and ranking structure in eSports. Applying a hybrid technique developed by previous research involving a series
of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) tools, those being: Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), Simple Additive Weighting
(SAW), and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), this study develops power
rankings for professional teams in the popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, Defense of the Ancients
(Dota) 2. Further analyses offer a comparison of the produced ranking structure to other metrics commonly used in eSports
evaluation, such as Elo and Glicko ratings. The findings of this study offer implications for players, teams, performance
analysts, oddsmakers, consumers, among others. Recommendations and future directions of this research are also provided.

Keywords: Ranking, eSports, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), grey relational analysis (GRA), simple additive
weighting (SAW), technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS)

1. Introduction

Over the course of more than 40 years, video
games have advanced far beyond Pitfall!, Asteroids,
and Frogger on the Atari 2600 gaming console,
with some of the earliest gaming tournaments taking
place in the United States during the 1970s (Bountie
Gaming, 2018). Considering this, gameplay contin-
ues to be adapted by developers and organisers in
order to garner the interest of millions of people
around sporting events of a new kind, often termed
eSports, filled with familiar features such as com-

mentators, large screens, and stages. Since 2012, the
number of fans and viewers in this domain has been
steadily increasing (Statista, 2018). eSports figures
are rather promising as they have also improved year-
over-year. NewZoo, a market intelligence agency
specializing in digital media and video gaming, esti-
mates that eSports generated $345 million in revenue
in North America in 2018, along with over $500
million abroad (Pannekeet, 2018). Furthermore, the
most recent global revenue figures have experienced
a year-on-year growth of over 26%, with revenue
approaching over $1 billion during 2019 (Pannekeet,
2019).

Within this realm, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena
(MOBA) titles are among the most played and

watched digital games in the world (Gaudiosi, 2012).
Some of the most popular MOBA games include
League of Legends (LoL), Heroes of the Storm, Smite,
Strife, and Defense of the Ancients (Dota) 2. Despite
this, Ingraham (2018) points out that the North Amer-
ican eSports market pales in comparison to more
traditional sports leagues, such as the National Foot-
ball League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB),
National Hockey League (NHL), and National Bas-
ketball Association (NBA), which each brought in
over $4 billion in 2017 alone (Mathewson, 2019). In
a more promising vein, viewership for the 2018 Dota
2 International Championship nearly matched that
of the 2018 Kentucky Derby and exceeded figures
for the Association of Tennis Professionals’ (ATP)
2018 Wimbledon tournament, National Association
for Stock Car Auto Racing’s (NASCAR) Daytona
500 in 2018, the Professional Golfers’ Association
(PGA) 2018 United States Open, and the Union
Cycliste Internationale (UCI) 2017 Tour de France
(Ingraham, 2018).

Produced by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 is an action
real-time strategy (ARTS) video game, which sets
two teams, named the “Radiant” and the “Dire”, of
five characters (or “heroes”) against one another in
a fictional fantasy world (Gaston, 2013). The objec-
tive of the game is to demolish the opposing team’s
main building called the “Ancient”. Teams begin the
game at their own base and move into enemy ter-
ritory using three pathways called “lanes”. Several
buildings called “Towers” are distributed within these
lanes and will attack members of the opposing team.
A river, positioned towards the centre of the map,
divides the teams’ territories equally. Creatures called
“Barracks” will spawn every 30 seconds within the
lanes and proceed to the enemy base, attacking oppos-
ing players, Towers, and enemy Barracks along the
way (Gaston, 2013). To strengthen the selected hero,
players gain experience points by defeating enemies.
Dota 2, considered an advanced form of ARTS, also
contains an intricate item drop system that can be
used to further enhance a player’s hero.

At this juncture, understanding and building sta-
tistical models can help predict players’ and teams’
performances in tournaments, particularly during
high-stakes events where prize pools are expansive.
Findings from the current study can better inform
players, teams, oddsmakers, and consumers on how
to plan respective in-game strategies and external
wagers. Thus, we present a unique application of
various Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)
techniques to eSports performance modelling using

data obtained from the MOBA game, Dota 2. The
remainder of the current paper is organised as fol-
lows: In section 2, a concise review of the literature
and related scholarship is presented. A description of
the data and relevant statistics are provided in section
3. The results of the current study are summarised
in section 4. Finally, section 5 offers conclusions,
recommendations, and directions for future work.

2. Literature review

2.1. MCDM and related techniques

Within operations research and the decision-
making sciences, MCDM has emerged as a prevailing
technique in providing solutions to a variety of issues
involving multiple, even divergent, objectives (Tri-
antaphyllou, Shu, Sanchez, & Ray, 1998). MCDM
deals with a variety of decision problems in the pres-
ence of numerous criteria as a means to arrive at
the ideal solution involving a series of alternatives.
According to Triantaphyllou et al. (1998), there are
three primary steps when numerically analysing and
deciding between alternatives: 1) Collect the rele-
vant criteria and alternatives; 2) Assign numerical
weights to selected criteria; and 3) Compute numeri-
cal values to provide a ranking of each alternative.
Scholars of MCDM have offered numerous meth-
ods to rank alternatives, such as analytic hierarchy
process (AHP), ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la
REalité (ELimination and Choice Expressing Real-
ity; ELECTRE), simple additive weighting (SAW),
grey relational analysis (GRA), Technique for Order
Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOP-
SIS), among many others (Triantaphyllou, 2013).
As Triantaphyllou (2000, p. 5) states: “with the
continuing proliferation of decision methods and
their variants, it is important to understand their
comparative value.” Considering these assertions by
Triantaphyllou (2000), several MCDM methods are
expanded upon.

2.1.1. Grey relational analysis
Deng (1982) proposed that solutions to prob-

lems may not always be easily attained, given that
researchers typically do not have all the informa-
tion required to resolve an inquiry. Thus, GRA was
developed to aid in the MCDM process by utilising
the available information to reach an ideal solu-
tion. The process of GRA involves first generating
a matrix containing available data. The data is then



S. Pradhan and Y. Abdourazakou / Power ranking eSports teams 63

normalised by a selected reference series according to
the ideal direction of each performance indicator. For
instance, indicators where higher values signal better
performance (e.g., kills in Dota 2) utilise the high-
est data point as the reference series, while those in
which lower values denote stronger play (e.g., deaths)
employ the lowest value among the chosen indica-
tor. Following an absolute value transformation, grey
relational coefficients and grades are generated and
then ranked in order to determine the ideal solution
(see Kuo, Yang, & Huang, 2008 for a full description
of GRA). In a previous study, Kuo et al. (2008) have
illustrated the suitability and parsimony of the GRA
method in calculations and optimisation in decision-
making. GRA has been employed in a variety of
different fields, such as in fire safety assessment
(Yang, Qian, & Huang, 2012), product life strat-
egy (Chan & Tong, 2007), and genetic algorithms
(Huang, Chiu, & Chen, 2008).

Moreover, GRA has been utilised in many con-
texts within sports-based research, such as in ranking
teams and individual athletes in the NFL (Chen et al.,
2010) and NBA (Chen, Huang, Lin, Lin, & Kuo,
2006). More specifically, research by Sakinç (2014)
assessed Turkish association football clubs, using
GRA to rank the financial performance of four major
clubs (i.e., Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray and
Trabzonspor) listed on the Borsa İstanbul (BIST)
from the period of 2009 to 2013. Using a variety
of both traditional and advanced statistics from the
NBA, Pradhan (2018) created a structured ranking
system of NBA players in the Modern Era using
GRA.

2.1.2. Simple additive weighting
Much like GRA, SAW was developed by Hwang

and Yoon (1981) as a way to solve MCDM prob-
lems. The underlying logic of SAW involves a similar
sequence of calculations that produce standardised
scores based on the ideal direction (i.e., higher or
lower) of each performance indicator. Often, weights
for these standardised scores are then selected based
on the importance of each criterion. These scores
are then summed to create weighted averages, which
are then ranked in determining the ideal solution
(Afshari, Mojahed, & Yusuff, 2010).

The usage of SAW has been widespread, having
been previously exercised in circumstances assess-
ing supply chain risk within pharmaceutical systems
(Jaberidoost et al., 2015), the effects of cocoa
combinations on various human sensory parame-
ters (Dogan, Aktar, Toker, & Tatlisu, 2015), and

wind energy resource sites (Georgiou, Polatidis,
& Haralambopoulos, 2012). Although the schol-
arly application of SAW to sports has been very
limited, it has been applied in dance member evalua-
tions by Adela, Jasmi, Basiron, Huda, and Maseleno
(2018). Researchers in this study examined several
pre-selected criteria related to dance (e.g., physical
flexibility, skill, deftness, and the like). Using SAW,
Adela and colleagues provide findings that could aid
in the selection of the “best” dancers for outlets such
as professional organisations and schools.

2.1.3. Technique for order preference by
similarity to an ideal solution

Originally conceived by Hwang and Yoon (1981)
and advanced further by Yoon (1987) along with
Hwang, Lai, and Liu (1993), the TOPSIS approach
attempts to locate the ideal solution by parsing out the
best and worst alternatives using vector-type normali-
sation methods. In doing so, TOPSIS produces scores
that can be ranked to determine the ideal solution of
a given MCDM problem, akin to GRA and SAW.
For instance, across multiple studies in the context of
sports, Chen and colleagues (2012, 2014) developed
an evaluation model using both AHP and TOPSIS
to aid in the managerial decision-making of the opti-
mal selection of a pitcher within Chinese professional
baseball. Chen et al. employed AHP to determine
patterns in starting pitcher selection and created
numerical weights for the selected performance indi-
cators. To this end, both AHP and TOPSIS were
utilised in the final determination of pitcher rank-
ings. Further research by Dadelo, Turskis, Zavadskas,
and Dadeliene (2014) has also employed TOPSIS
in the development of a player ranking system inte-
grating several measured attributes, such as objective
performance indicators as well as expert judgment
assessments submitted by coaches, within basket-
ball. Likewise, TOPSIS has been applied to situations
involving ranking the performance of German Bun-
desliga association football teams (Kiani Mavi, Kiani
Mavi, & Kiani, 2012), as well as various urban engi-
neering applications (Oz, Mete, Serin, & Gul, 2018;
Yuvaraj & Pradeep Kumar, 2015).

2.2. Purpose

There are a vast number of methods implemented
for sports ranking today. For example, Barrow,
Drayer, Elliott, Gaut, and Osting (2013) estimate
there are 101 different ranking techniques used in
the field. ESPN, one of the largest global distrib-



64 S. Pradhan and Y. Abdourazakou / Power ranking eSports teams

utors of sports media, has compiled a library of
different statistics to rate players and teams, such as
Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Quarterback Rating
(QBR), Basketball Power Index (BPI), and many oth-
ers (Katz, 2015). Sports ranking techniques employ
a variety of approaches for valuing teams, but one of
the most prevalent methods is termed power ranking.
This technique computes a team’s strength relative to
other teams in the same league. Typically, these rat-
ings are expressed as ranks, with the best teams being
placed first overall. Within the literature, there are
scores of studies that have evaluated different ranking
methods and their predictive validity (Barrow et al.,
2013; Burer, 2012; Langville & Meyer, 2012).

Performance analysis in eSports appears to be sim-
ilar to modelling performance in traditional sports
(e.g., soccer, basketball, baseball, and the like), as
each rely on features related to the athletes involved
and the game itself, wherein players’ performances
impact the outcome. In this context, the purpose of our
study is to gain a more comprehensive understand-
ing of the underlying factors that determine various
eSports teams’ performances within the realm of
the popular MOBA game, Dota 2. eSports has a
great advantage for game analytics over classic sport
games due to the granularity in providing structured
information about matches that are held online (Wag-
ner, 2006). The use of MCDM techniques is also
not foreign to the realm of eSports, or Dota 2 for
that matter. Aryanata, Rahadi, and Sudarmojo (2017)
utilised AHP in predicting performance of Dota 2
matches. The authors employed several metrics to
predict match results, such as experience per minute,
gold per minute, matchmaking ratio points, outcomes
of the last three head-to-head matches, and the over-
all results of the last 10 matches. Findings from
their AHP analysis provided accurate depictions of
match prediction using the selected a priori parame-
ters. Thus, our study seeks to investigate the influence
of various criteria on Dota 2 teams’ performance by
applying several MCDM models to offer insights into
the performance analysis of eSports.

3. Method

3.1. Data collection and performance indicators

Data for the 2017–2018 Dota 2 Professional
Circuit were collected from two primary sources,
DOTABUFF (https://www.dotabuff.com) and dat-
Dota (https://www.datdota.com). We utilised a series

of performance indicators in structuring our power
ranking system for each team. Specifically, we
employed all available, composite player statis-
tics from the public Dota 2 community statistical
database, DOTABUFF. In all, these comprised a total
of 17 variables, which included: 1) number of matches
played, 2) winning percentage, 3) kill-death-assist
ratio, 4) kills, 5) deaths, 6) assists, 7) last hits, 8)
denies, 9) gold per minute, 10) experience per minute,
11) points, 12) majors won, 13) majors qualified, 14)
minors won, 15) minors qualified, 16) match wins,
and 17) match losses. These statistics were compiled
to create team averages for the selected metrics. All
players who participated during the 2017-2018 Dota
2 ranked season were included in our analysis.

We also included additional indicators of team
strength obtained from the professional Dota 2
statistical catalogue, datDota. Specifically, we incor-
porated team ratings as determined by Elo (k = 32)
and Elo (k = 64), as well as Glicko-1 and Glicko-
2 methods. Elo ratings, developed by Arpad Elo
(1961) in the context of chess, are computed using
the results of a previous number of (k) matches.
These ratings have been widely used in the context of
sports in evaluating team strength ratings and assess-
ing outcome predictions of NBA, NFL, MLB, and
NHL franchises (FiveThirtyEight, 2019; Karminsky
& Polozov, 2016). More recently, Glicko-1 rat-
ings conceived by Glickman (1995) and described

as a “special case of Elo” (p. 1) have also been
implemented into the purview of sporting events.
The primary differentiator of Glicko ratings is the
accounting of a team’s standard deviation, termed
ratings deviation (Glickman, 1995). The second
iteration of these ratings, namely Glicko-2 rat-
ings, attempts to further improve upon predictive
capability by factoring in a team’s volatility (i.e.,
likelihood of inconsistent performance; Glickman,
2013). Teams with no earnings and where team
strength data were unavailable were excluded from
our dataset. A list of all 21 performance indicators
used for our team ranking system is included in
Table 1. A summary of statistics obtained from each
player, as well as team strength markers are provided
in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 1.

3.2. Statistical analysis

To create our power ranking of Dota 2 teams,
we used a revised version of the hybrid MCDM
model proposed by Wang, Zhu, and Wang (2016).
As mentioned previously, MCDM employs a series
of performance attributes to determine the ideal solu-
tion out of a number of selected alternatives (Rolland,
2006). This is accomplished by aggregating the cho-
sen criteria to produce a single numerical value that
represents the ideal solution (Vu & Li, 2014). These
values for alternatives are then ranked in MCDM to
select the best alternative (Martinez & Herrera, 2006).
Wang et al. have argued that a method that combines
several MCDM methods, namely GRA, SAW, and
TOPSIS, tends to produce a more accurate depiction

lines represent the median scores.

and subsequent ranking of the alternatives presented.
Wang et al.’s model, which brings together the afore-
mentioned techniques, has been shown to produce
similar outcomes as other singular forms of MCDM,
such as AHP, ELECTRE, multi-objective optimisa-
tion on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA), along
with GRA, SAW, and TOPSIS among others. In the
present study, we simplified Wang et al.’s hybrid
model by only using the average numerical scores
obtained from the output of the GRA, SAW, and TOP-
SIS analyses. This method of analysis was performed
since we did not assign any specific weights to the
performance indicators (i.e., all performance statis-

selected MCDM procedures is provided in Table 3.

4. Results

Statistical analyses were performed in R Stu-
dio for macOS (Version 1.1.463) using the topsis
package (Yazdi, 2013) and Microsoft Excel. Each
MCDM model was generated separately and then
aggregated using a modified version of Wang et al.’s
(2016) procedure, as described previously, to produce
the hybrid analysis. The full results of the hybrid
MCDM analysis are presented in Table 4. Overall,
the hybrid MCDM analysis ranked Virtus.pro as the
top team during the 2017-18 Dota 2 Professional Cir-
cuit season, followed by Team Secret, Team Liquid,
PSG.LGD, and OG, respectively. Digital Chaos was
ranked as the last team in the hybrid analysis. Across

each of the MCDM component analyses (i.e., GRA,
SAW, and TOPSIS), Virtus.pro was ranked as the top
team. Digital Chaos was categorised as the worst per-
former in all but the TOPSIS analysis, in which the
team was ranked 34th (i.e., second-to-last; scoring
slightly higher than the team, Vega Squadron, with
a TOPSIS score of 19.31% compared to 18.74%).
Among the actual placement of the teams based on
seasonal performance, the hybrid model accurately
identified the top four teams, albeit placing them in a
different order apart from Virtus.pro.

Supplementary analyses. To validate the results
of the rankings generated by the hybrid MCDM anal-
ysis, we performed a series of Spearman rank-order
correlations. These tests correlated the standings
yielded by the hybrid model and the singular GRA,
SAW, and TOPSIS rankings. We also sought to exam-
ine the association between the rankings produced by
common team strength performance indicators, such

as Elo (k = 32), Elo (k = 64), Glicko-1, and Glicko-2
ratings. Results from the Spearman rank-order cor-
relations supported the validity of our findings (all
Spearman rho [ρ] values > 0.45, all p values < 0.01;
see Fig. 2). Follow-up Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
with continuity correction were performed to fur-
ther examine differences between the ranks produced
by the hybrid MCDM method and the previously
examined rankings. These tests did not reveal any sig-
nificant differences arising from the use of the hybrid
model, suggesting consistency with the other forms
of ranking (all p values > 0.05; see Table 5).

5. Discussion

This study aimed at crafting a power ranking model
for seasonal performance in the popular MOBA video
game, Dota 2. Specifically, we employed a modified

version of Wang et al.’s (2016) MCDM hybrid model,
which utilised a combination of GRA, SAW, and
TOPSIS, to rank teams during the 2017-18 Dota 2
Professional Circuit season. Results from the hybrid
analysis are consistent with other forms of perfor-
mance evaluation, such as Elo and Glicko ratings.
With respect to top performing teams, our ranking
system offered an accurate depiction of actual season

standings. Nevertheless, our study did have several
limitations.

Compared to physical sports, eSports prediction
involves even more information, as the selection
of characters could also be a factor that influences
game results. For instance, each character in the
game will have its own abilities, which could lead
to different competitive advantages and disadvan-

tages due to specific match-ups (Yang, Qin, & Lei,
2016). While the current study did not consider the
impact of character selection, future research could
examine how such choices influence eSports team
performance. Although the present study utilised data
from a MOBA-type game, there are other genres
that might require different forms of power rankings
based on their characteristics. For instance, games
like Counter-Strike rely on other technical abilities
as opposed to characters that one selects, such as the
ability of players to know which weapons to use, how
to control them, and where to be on the map relative
to their teammates and opponents. These sets of skills
involved in effective performance are what differen-
tiates such titles from MOBA games like Dota 2.

Power ranking brings in many new opportunities
to assist in detecting which players and teams have
the most potential for performance, as well as mar-
ketability. In comparison to traditional sports athletes
in leagues, such as the NBA, eSports athletes are
quite different from a content standpoint. For exam-
ple, LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers or
Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors needed
to first develop their performance on the court before
acquiring sponsors and fans. In eSports, both per-
formance and marketability content can be created
equal. In many instances, an eSports athlete might
have a better career streaming their games via Twitch
and other related sites compared to competing and
winning prize money with their team in league play.
An eSports player does not have to wait to win titles
in order to monetise their skills within games. In
essence, the community defines what is relevant by
promoting exciting content.

To that end, an influx of professional teams from
traditional sports have joined the eSports market to
further their already sizeable investments. The Sacra-

mento Kings, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia
76ers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Houston Rockets
have all endorsed their own LoL teams (Chikhani,
2018). As eSports continue to evolve, practition-
ers face managerial challenges that are similar to
those in traditional sport, particularly in areas of in-
game performance. Forecasting performance plays
an important role in sports, with nearly every major
professional sports team containing an analytics
department. These analysts use player statistics to
predict future games and attempt to enhance perfor-
mance through draft selections or roster adjustments.

As Makarov, Savostyanov, Litvyakov, and Ignatov
(2018) assert, the rapid maturity of eSports serves
as a guide to gambling businesses and bookmakers
that will inevitably turn their attention to such events.
With thousands of bookmakers accepting wagers on
sporting events around the world today, gambling in
sports is more popular than ever before. For example,
during the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s
(NCAA) Basketball Tournament, March Madness,
the American Gaming Association estimated that
approximately 50 million Americans wagered $8.5
billion in 2019 (Axson, 2019). Similarly, eSports
bookmakers need access to data in order to compile
statistics to accurately set odds and make match pre-
dictions that facilitate gambling in real time. Several
other issues identified by Grove (2016) also become
apparent in the regulation of eSports gambling, such
as specifically how to enforce a global industry like
eSports, how skin gambling and in-game casinos will
be treated, the involvement of minors in eSports, and
equating eSports betting to traditional sports gam-
bling.

In general, power rankings can apply to many
sports, but may also be used for teams playing
in specific tournaments, such as university cham-
pionships. With the massive success of the eSports
market, ESPN has begun broadcasting the Collegiate
eSports Championship (CEC). Various college teams
will compete in games like Overwatch, Hearthstone,
among others (Wilson, 2019). There will also be
a corollary pre-game show, called College eSports
Championship: Countdown, that will air weekly.
Consumers will be able to tune in through ESPN3,
Twitch, YouTube, and Twitter. Considering the vari-
ety of other titles, the results of this study could also
be adapted to other games in eSports. Future investi-
gations could examine the relationships between the
use of different parameters and actual championship
results through Wang et al.’s (2016) hybrid model and
other MCDM techniques.

In the light of recent development in the gam-
bling industry, such inputs can help bookmakers and
sponsors better assess the profitability of eSports ath-
letes and increase brand visibility. For sponsorship
and endorsements, in particular, such a data driven
approach can further assist in assessing the potential
return on interest (ROI) for different eSports teams.
Moreover, these findings may even aid in team con-
tracts and endorsement deals, in which eSports teams
and sponsors can utilise a combination of MCDM
techniques to compare and contrast players. eSports
athletes careers often begin at a very early age and
thus, accurate power rankings can potentially rede-
fine the way such deals are negotiated in the long
run. Organisations may even be able to craft well-
informed prize pools based on in-game predictive
performance. Such analyses are also vital for a team,
its players, and management in terms of develop-
ing tactics and increasing performance. We hope
our study provides future directions for research and
insights for practitioners in guiding both in-game
strategy and understanding Dota 2 performance.
