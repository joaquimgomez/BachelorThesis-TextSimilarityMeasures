behavior tell us?

Abstract. Passing is an important and crucial aspect of winning a soccer match. It plays a big role in important decisions
made by managers and owners when buying/selling players, picking offensive/defensive strategies and defining a style of
play. In this article we show how to support these decisions by analyzing the unique passing behaviors (motifs) of players
and teams from the patterns in their passing-possession data. We analyze individual players as well as teams based on the
diversity and frequency of their involvement in different motifs. We gather passing and possession data from 4 seasons
(2012–15) of 6 big European leagues with 8219 matches, 3532 unique players and 155 unique teams and apply the network
motif concept to study the patterns. By introducing an expected goals model we build on the motif concept to measure
the effectiveness of styles of play. We also make use of a novel way to represent the motif data (the radar graph) to make
comparisons between players and teams across multiple seasons. We show how this analysis can support scouting for players
and managers, identifying unique players/teams, finding relationships between position and style and in finding a suitable
replacement for La Computadora.

1. Introduction

In today’s world we see an increasing trend in the
availability of data. This is particularly true for sports,
and football is no exception. Firms such as OptaS-
ports gather all sorts of data on matches played all
over the planet. Gone are the old days of searching
for statistics in the Sunday newspaper. Now a quick
search on FourFourTwo.com or Squawka.com can
provide you with in-depth information on any player
– ranging from minutes played on the field to passes
made, conversion rates, percentage of total posses-
sion held, fouls committed, and goals attempted and
scored. Managers and fans have been using this data
for many years to make strategies and comparisons
between players. However, we are now also able to
extract a second by second description of play from

these websites. This opens doors to extract a lot of
hidden information on player and team behaviour by
devising new metrics and studying the data using
models from network theory. We use the network
motif concept shown in Milo et al. (2002) to study
patterns in the data and illustrate its use in sports
analytics.

There are two approaches to studying passing
behaviour and team style. One is a static approach
where analysis is done on aggregated data, while the
other approach involves real time tracking of both
players and the ball during play. Both approaches
have their advantages and challenges and are more,
or less, suitable for a specific sport. Spatio-temporal
analysis has been studied extensively for the NBA.
We refer the reader to the works of Goldsberry (2012),
Shortridge et al. (2014). In Bialkowski et al. (2014)
the authors apply this methodology for soccer and
demonstrate how to accurately detect and visual-
ize formations, as well as analyze individual player
behavior. Earlier, Grunz et al. (2012) introduced a
hierarchical architecture consisting of artificial neural

networks capable of classifying different patterns and
variations in those tactical patterns in soccer matches
and Clemente et al. (2013) used the spatio-temporal
data of a U13-soccer match to measure the tactical
responses of two opposing teams both with and with-
out possession of the ball.

Our focus is on the static analysis, where the play-
ers are not tracked unless they are involved in a ball
event. The ball is also not tracked per se, but its posi-
tion can be interpolated with the available data. A few
articles have investigated this passing-possession net-
work that the data allows us to construct. In Gyarmati
and Hefeeda (2015), the authors estimate the maxi-
mal speed of soccer players by knowing their position
on the field between two ball events (such as receiv-
ing a pass and then making a pass). In Clemente et al.
(2015a,b) the authors create an adjacency matrix with
the passes made between the players. They study net-
work metrics like centrality to characterize the team,
importance of players such as midfielders and study
the style differences between two halves of the game.
In Pena and Touchette (2012) they analyze the motifs
for passing behavior of countries in the 2010 FIFA
World Cup. In Pena (2014), they use the possession
data and show that a finite state Markov process is
very accurate in approximating the distribution of
passing sequences and chances of taking shots for
English Premier League teams for the 2012/13 sea-
son. To study team passing behaviour, Gyarmati et al.
(2014) use the motif analysis from Milo et al. (2002)
to obtain passing styles during the 2012/13 season for
a few European leagues and find that FC Barcelona’s
tiki taka style is unique. A similar work by Pena and
Navarro (2015) analyzes individual players on their
styles in the English Premier League and the Spanish
La Liga and show that Xavi has a unique style.

In this research we will utilize the idea of flow
motifs to find unique styles in both regular pass-
ing and the final attacking passes prior to a goal
attempt of both teams and players. This is done by
differentiating between possession and goal attempt
flow motifs. Subsequently, these results are combined
with multiple other techniques such as a coordinate
based expected goals models adapted from Mac-
donald (2012), and clustering techniques such as
the mean shift algorithm from Comaniciu and Meer
(2002) and the Euclidean distance. We analyze dif-
ferent events in six of the biggest European soccer
leagues and illustrate that their implementation yields
useful insight that might help teams and managers
in buying or selling players, analyzing opponents or
defining styles of play. We also analyze the depar-

ture of Frank de Boer from Ajax to Inter Milan, the
difference in flow motifs used between home and
away games, who Jean Seri is and why he must be an
elite midfielder and the difference in attacking style
between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. We try
to answer the question posed by Lopez Peña “Who
can replace Xavi?” Pena and Navarro (2015) and ulti-
mately we show that with the use of flow motifs it is
possible to identify potential replacement players and
managers.

2. Data and methodology

2.1. Data

The data used was obtained from www.squawka.
com using a python web-crawler. It covers four sea-
sons (2012/2013 to 2015/2016), six different leagues
(Dutch Eredivisie, English Premier League, Spanish
Primera Division, Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1 and
German Bundesliga) and 8219 matches. This ulti-
mately yields a vast data set containing 7412 players
(of which 3532 are unique players) and 466 teams
(of which 155 are unique) and their total time played
per season. No data was available for the Eredivisie
in ’12/13.

The data set consists of chronological vectors
with the parameters: league, season, play type (pass,
goal attempt, cross, tackle, clearance or intercep-
tion), result of the play type (failed, completed,
foul), team name, player name, total seconds expired
since the start of the match, and the coordinates at
which the play occurred on a (0,100) by (0,100) two-
dimensional plain.

Due to time stamp structuring in the 2012/13 and
2013/14 season data points recorded during injury
time show up as either 45:00 or 90:00 thus making it
impossible to arrange them chronologically. There-
fore these data points, 1.5% and 5% of first half and
second half data respectively, have been removed for
these two seasons. Furthermore, failed tackles have
been removed from the data set since they have no
apparent influence on the flow of the game.

In order to reduce outliers when comparing indi-
vidual players, those who played less than 900
minutes (the equivalent of approximately 10 matches)
in a given season were omitted. While analyzing team
motifs, no data treatment is made, all players are con-
sidered irrespective of how much time they played in
the season.

2.2. Flow motifs

Flow motifs, as shown in Milo et al. (2002), are
building blocks of the passing behaviour of teams.
We differentiate between two flow motif types for
both players (P) and teams (T):

�

Possession Motifs (PMs): a sequence of at least
3 passes a team/player creates that does not lead
to a goal attempt.

�

Expected Goal Motifs (xGMs): a sequence of
at least one pass that leads to a goal scoring
opportunity with a certain expectation of being
converted.

We consider up to 3 passes as part of a motif as long
as they were made within 5 seconds individually. Any
transition with an interval time greater than this upper
bound is not considered to be a part of any motif. Fur-
thermore, a passing sequence is terminated when a
game ends at either half, a foul is committed, the ball
goes out of play, or when an opposing team’s player
disrupts the flow by tackling, intercepting, passing
or clearing away the ball. Sensitivity analysis on the
choice of using a 5 second interval is shown in Sec-
tion 6. Using 3 passes in the motif is easier to visualize
and analyze. Including a 4th pass is also possible, but
this creates 48 more combinations for players making
the problem too large.

The difference between the two motif types is illus-
trated in Figs. 1 and 2. For the expected goal motifs,
the goal attempt is the definitive end point, the start
is up to 3 passes before the attempt. In Fig. 1 we
show the ABACG motif. The motif would have been
counted as BACG if the first pass was longer than
5 seconds. The possession motifs are obtained by
looking at passes during the whole game. Here we
consider 3 passes to make a motif. From Fig. 2, we
can see the ABAB, BABC and ABCD motifs occur
in the pass sequence.

Fig. 1. The ABACG Expected Goal Motif.

Fig. 2. The ABAB, BABC and ABCD Possession Motifs.

When looking at either Possession Motifs (PM) or
Expected Goal Motifs (xGM), A is the player under
consideration while B, C and D are other players
on the same team that are involved in the motif. In
Expected Goal Motifs (xGMs), a goal attempt (with
a given expected value) is denoted by G.

2.3. Expected goals

Each xGM is valued by means of an expected goal
(xG) model solely based of the coordinates of the final
attempt. Based on the coordinates of where the goal
shot was made from, we divide our set of 204984 goal
attempts in to a grid of 12 by 20 tiles (creating tiles
of approximately 5.3 by 5.7 meters given a median
pitch of 105 by 68 meters, (UEFA, 2016)). Then we
establish the expected value of a passing sequence by
weighing each motif by the percentage of converted
goal opportunities from within that tile.

2.4. Radar graph

To be able to compare players or teams visually, we
devised a novel way of representing their involvement
in motifs, i.e. their style, by means of a radar graph.
Players and teams’ involvement in a particular motif
is compared against the maximum value for that motif
from the whole data set. This makes it possible to
compare players and teams across different seasons
and leagues. This maximum value can also be specific
to the season and league, however for the purpose of
this article, we have used the maximum value from
the entire data set.

An example of a radar graph is shown in Fig. 3.
Each radius shown in the figure represents a motif.
The extent of a players’ or teams’ use of this motif is a
percentage of the maximum value from the data set. In
this specific figure we show Paulo Dybala’s expected
goal motif performance in the ’15/16 season at Juven-
tus. The figure is constructed as follows: in the top
right quadrant we indicate all motifs ending with -
AG indicating that Dybala was the final shot taker.
Continuing counterclockwise, we have three motifs
(ABAG, BABAG, and BACAG) that indicate a one-two
combination with Dybala as the main protagonist. As
we keep going counterclockwise, we have the assist
motifs (-AXG) where Paulo Dybala was not the final
shot taker, but played an assisting role. Again we can
identify the one-two combinations BABG, BCACG,
ABABG, and ABACG. In the latter two Dybala is
the person with two touches in the motif. After
the assist motifs the second assist motifs are shown



302 J. Bekkers and S. Dabadghao / Flow motifs in soccer: What can passing behavior tell us?

Fig. 3. Dybala’s (A) Expected Goal Motifs in ’15/16.

(-AXYG), followed by the third assist motifs (ABCBG,
and ABCDG). As it is seen in the graph, Dybala uses
the ABG motif just more than half as many times as
the player with the maximum use of that motif. We
can see at a glance that Dybala was hardly involved
in motifs with one-two combinations when creating
goal attempts, but is well rounded in the use of most
other motifs.

2.5. Clustering

To find unique players or teams we make use of
the unsupervised machine learning algorithm mean
shift. This hierarchical clustering method is a centroid
based algorithm which works by updating candidates
for centroids to be the mean of the points within a
certain radius (bandwidth) around the centroid, see
Fukunaga and Hostetler (1975). Every data point
(vj) is considered a centroid, until the mean of the
data points within the bandwidth is stationary. The
k-means clustering algorithm does not automatically
compute the optimal number of clusters given a cer-
tain bandwidth, and is biased towards equally sized
clusters (making unique playing styles less appar-
ent) given it’s adherence to Euclidean distances, see
Georgescu et al. (2003). However, we do use the
Euclidean distance to find the k-nearest neighbours
with the most similar motif tendencies to a given node
within our vast data set.

3. Team motifs

In Table 1 we identify 5 different team passing
motifs (TPM) and 8 different team expected goal
motifs (TxGM). Team motifs are obtained from the
sum of the motifs per 90 minutes of all players that
belong to this team during a given season. Since sub-
stitutes are an integral part of a team, players who
played less than 900 minutes will not be excluded
from this analysis.

3.1. Uniqueness in passing (TPM)

To search for unique teams, we analyze their style
by looking at how they use the five different motifs
by employing a simple scatter plot. One of these five
plots is shown in Fig. 4. It represents the plot for the
ABAC motif for all teams showing their intensity of
use (per match) versus the popularity of use within
the team (the percentage of time it is used). We find
that some teams are consistent outliers in all five plots
at either end of the spectrum, implying the presence
of unique styles. To find these unique team motif ten-
dencies, we can cluster the teams together with the
mean shift clustering algorithm using the vector of
motif intensities per team as input to form these clus-
ters. In Table 2 the results of the mean shift clustering
are shown, indicating four unique clusters.

From these clusters we derive that Paris Saint-
Germain has a unique passing style whereas the
passing styles at FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich
are closely related. The latter is not surprising consid-
ering Pep Guardiola integrated his specific style into
the Barcelona when he coached them between 2008
and 2012 (still largely used today), and then at Bay-
ern Munich after he joined there as a coach in 2013.
In the third cluster with 29 teams we see teams that
utilize intelligent possession based football. Even the
more suspect teams seem to fit in rather well. Empoli
managed by Maurizio Sarri in 2014/15, who is now
head coach at Napoli; Nice managed by Claude Puel
during the past four seasons, and Southampton where
he has been the head coach from the 2016/17 season;
Vitesse coached by Peter Bosz during 2013-2016 and

head coach at Ajax in the 2016/17 season; Wigan
Athletic, Swansea City and Everton all coached by
Roberto Martinez. Las Palmas, coached by Quique
Setién, who finished 11th in their first year back in
the Spanish top tier since 2002, also shows up in
this cluster. This indicates that Quique Setién might
be a suitable coach for other teams looking to play
possession based football.

The main difference between the first three clus-
ters and the remaining 121 teams seems their lower
probability of executing ABCD and ABCA motifs,
and thus higher probabilities of utilizing ABAB,
ABCB, and ABAC. This trend gradually decreases
per cluster, meaning that this trend is strongest for
the Paris Saint-Germain cluster and weaker for the
subsequent Guardiola cluster and the cluster with 29
teams respectively. Furthermore, the first three clus-
ters have a overall higher average motif intensity per
match.

3.2. Uniqueness in expected goal motifs (TxGM)

A similar analysis can be made for the team
expected goal motifs (TxGMs). Applying the mean
shift clustering algorithm on the team intensity vec-
tors gives us three clusters (shown in Table 3). The

first two unique cluster groups are mainly differenti-
ated by their expected goal attempts from the ABG,
and ABCG motifs. The fact that teams in the first two
clusters create on average significantly more xGs than
“all other teams” sets them both apart from the third
cluster.

At the end of the 2015/2016 season Frank de Boer
left Ajax after 5.5 seasons to become head coach at
Inter Milan. Ajax subsequently replaced him with for-
mer Vitesse manager Peter Bosz. Both these trainer
changes can be explained by means of the TPMs and

TxGMs employed by these three teams during the
past four seasons. Ajax is the 5th nearest neighbour to
Inter Milan on TPMs by Euclidean distance. Despite
this, Inter Milan is not placed in the first two clusters
based on TxGMs; but Ajax is (see Tables 2 and 3).
This indicates that Inter Milan is lacking high poten-
tial goal attempts, and they appointed Frank de Boer
to fix this. The fact that Peter Bosz replaced Frank
de Boer is not surprising considering their styles are
rather similar. Vitesse’s TPMs and TxGMs are 2nd
and 5th closest to Ajax respectively by Euclidean dis-
tance. At the end of the 2016/17 season Peter Bosz
signed for Borussia Dortmund, a team with a similar
style to his previously managed teams.

3.3. A comparison between home
and away games

Home advantage is a big part of soccer, with teams
winning about 64% of their points in home games,
Pollard (1986). In our data set, an average team wins
45%, loses 30% and draws 25% of their home games.
This difference between home and away wins sug-
gests that there must be something more than just
home field advantage that plays a role. We conjec-
ture that the teams either employ different motifs or
increase motif intensity, i.e. play a more possessive
home game compared to away games.

Separating the team possession motifs into home
and away games for all teams and leagues shows
that on average a team creates 7.6% more possession
motifs, and 31.2% more expected goal motifs during
home games. Pescara (+106.9%), Ajaccio (+101.9%)
and Sporting de Gijon (+92.9%) have the biggest pos-
itive difference when comparing home versus away
games on TxGMs. Exceptions to the rule include
FC Twente (–9.0%), Borussia Monchengladbach
(–7.8%) and Rayo Vallecano (–5.1%), who consis-
tently preform less possession motifs (TPM’s) during
their home games vs away games in three of the last

four seasons recorded. SV Darmstad (–15.1%) and
Siena (–12.1%) create significantly less expected goal
motifs (TxGM’s) when playing at home as compared
to away.

Three time consecutive UEFA League winner
Sevilla stands out when comparing home and away
TPMs. In 2012/13 they created 22.5% more posses-
sion motifs during their home games. After Unai
Emery took over the role as head coach in January
2013 he increased this number to absolutely extraor-
dinary heights and consistency in the following three
seasons. Sevilla respectively created 60.4%, 42.4%,
and 49.3% more possession motifs during their home
games when compared to their away games. Table 4
shows the teams closest to Sevilla when playing at
home or away using Euclidean distance. The fact
that Sevilla has a similar away style to bottom-of-the-
league teams like Sunderland, Chievo and Cordoba
suggests that Sevilla is using completely different
passing strategies during games away from their own
stadium.

3.4. The ABABG motif

It seems that almost every week a long range
screamer is scored, and subsequently named to be
a contender for goal of the season. Other goals such
as Jack Wilshere’s 1-0 against Norwich City in 2013
and Messi’s 3-0 against Real Sociedad in 2010 are
also considered some of the most beautiful goals
ever scored. Both these goals utilize the ABAB motif
(between Giroud and Wilshere, and Dani Alves and
Messi respectively) to create the final shot on goal.
Why are these goals considered to be so beautiful and
why do they not dominate the goal of the season lists?

In Table 5 we see that among all the goal attempts
in the data set, only 0.90% are created from an ABAB
motif. We also see that it is more difficult to create
a valuable goal attempt from the ABAB motif; every
goal attempt from this motif results in only 0.064
expected goals, almost half the value of an AB goal
attempt. So, in the case of the ABAB-goals the beauty

Table 5

Goal Motif Frequency and Conversion Ratio

ABG 39.2% 0.123 xG

lies in the rarity of the event, and the inherent diffi-
culty of turning the motif into an actual goal. Due to
this they hardly ever appear in the goal of the sea-
son lists, but when they are scored they are surely
considered.

4. Player motifs

Like teams, we can also differentiate between play-
ers by analyzing their style. In Table 6 all possible
player possession motifs (PPMs) and player expected
goal motifs (PxGMs) are shown. We can construct
a scatter plot similar to what we saw in the previ-

ous section; Fig. 5 shows all the 3532 unique players
in our data set with respect to their involvement in
the ABCD motif. We differentiate the players by
their positions (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder or
Forward) and observe a clear link between player
position and how they use a motif. The player pos-
session motifs (PPMs) can be used to cluster similar
players, compare players to one-another and scout
potential replacements that employ a similar style.

4.1. Unique PPM tendencies

Applying mean shift clustering algorithm with an
estimated bandwidth identifies eight clusters. Clus-
ters with less than 100 nodes are shown in Table 7

tiple node clusters.

We also ran the mean shift clustering algorithm to
give us 25 unique clusters. Table 8 shows all the small
clusters (the next biggest cluster has 18 nodes) with
the defining trait of the cluster. These classifications
demonstrate the accuracy with which the mean shift
algorithm is able to cluster players playing in similar
positions.

Inspecting the players in Table 8, we see mostly
(former) players from elite European teams such as
FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain,
Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. An interesting
player within this exclusive list of players with his
own single node cluster is OGC Nice and Ivory Coast
central midfielder Jean Seri. To see whether Seri is an
outlier at the bottom or top end of the player spectrum
we can find the nodes closest to him by Euclidean
distance. The players closest to Seri are: Toni Kroos,
Jérôme Boateng, Cesc Fàbregas and Bastian Schwe-
insteiger. This implies that Jean Seri must be a prolific
central midfielder.

4.2. Unique PxGM tendencies

Player Expected Goals Motifs (PxGMs) can be
used to shed light on the mind of the individual,
the way they personally shape their opportunities,
create opportunities for their team mates and show
how effective they are at finding the right spot for
a goal attempt. Applying the mean shift clustering
algorithm with an estimated bandwidth, we identify
thirteen different PxGM clusters. Clusters with less
than 20 nodes are shown in Table 9 accompanied by
a cluster classification.

different goal scoring styles. In Figs. 6 and 7 the dif-
ferences in expected goal scoring style between Messi
and Ronaldo are easily seen. Messi is involved more
in the build-up of his own chances utilizing BACAG,
ABAG, ABCAG and BABAG to create most of his
expected goals. Ronaldo is significantly less involved
in his own chances prior to taking the final shot
(BCBAG and BAG).

We also see that Messi gave assists that had a
higher probability of being converted into goals in the
2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons (BCACG, BCADG and
BACG). This is most likely the result of Barcelona
acquiring Luiz Suarez in the summer of 2014. Suarez
managed to outscore Messi during the 2015/16 sea-
son by 14 goals (40 against 26). On the other hand we
notice that Ronaldo and Real Madrid have evolved
from a team that would simply pass the ball to
Ronaldo and let him shoot on goal (BAG), to a team
that attempts a build-up before passing to Ronaldo
seeing how the use of BCDAG and BCBAG motifs
clearly increased.

4.3. Who can replace Xavi?

In the research appropriately titled “Who can
replace Xavi?”, the authors contemplate on the pos-
sible replacement for Xavi after he departs from FC
Barcelona, (Pena and Navarro, 2015). La Computa-

dora, who moved to play for Al Sadd in 2015, is
widely regarded as the puppet master pulling the
strings in arguably the best football team the world
has ever seen. In their analysis, Peña and Navarro
show that Xavi is a clear outlier when it comes to
his extraordinary passing ability, raising the question
of whether anyone could possibly follow in his foot-
steps. In Fig. 8 Xavi’s radar graph is depicted for the
season 2012/13 (by far his best season in this data
set) with 228.6 PPMs/90 minutes.

Xavi’s successor by PPMs can be found by inves-
tigating the players closest to Xavi on Euclidean
distance. Not surprisingly, the five players closest to
Xavi are Thiago Alcantara, Verratti, Thiago Motta,
Kimmich and Weigl respectively over all their sea-
sons in the data set (see Table 7). Taking a closer look
into the data shows that Marco Verratti is an interest-
ing prospect (see Fig. 9) because in the 2015/2016
season he produced 237.8 PPMs/90 minutes.

Subsequently we look at the players closest to Xavi
by PxGMs. We find that Verratti is quite far from
Xavi by Euclidean distance, however looking at their
PxGM radar graphs (Figs. 10 and 11) we see that
Verratti is involved in more expected goal motifs than
Xavi. They also show a similar style with most of
their xGs coming from playing as the second and
third assist.

Does this make Marco Verratti the perfect replace-
ment for Xavi? Possibly. Marco Verratti played the
equivalent of 10.19 matches in the 2015/16 season,

due to seven different minor injuries, whereas Xavi
played the equivalent of 35.24 matches. However, in
the 2014/15 season Verratti played the equivalent of
28.3 matches where he reached a total average of
183.9 motifs per 90 minutes, and was ranked at first
place by motif use that season.

5. Scouting and tactical analysis

In addition to analyzing past events, the PMs and
xGMs can also be used to select possible replace-
ments for departing players and coaches in the near
future and finding more optimal strategies than those
currently utilized by a team.

5.1. (Hypothetical) player replacements

Arsenal’s Mesut Özil and left-back Nacho Mon-
real are both players who were frequently involved
in passing motifs with Alexis Sánchez in 2015/16.



J. Bekkers and S. Dabadghao / Flow motifs in soccer: What can passing behavior tell us? 309

Coaches/Teams closest to Arsène Wenger by TPMs and TxGMs

Lucien Favre Borussia M’gladbach ’14/15
Rudi Garcia AS Roma ’13/14
Massimiliano Allegri Juventus ’15/16
Antonio Conte Juventus ’14/15
Luciano Spaletti AS Roma ’15/16

In this section we will look at possible replacements
for these players in the hypothetical case that either
of them leaves Arsenal during the summer of 2016
(Note: Sánchez left Arsenal after the 2017–18 sea-
son). In this case it is possible to execute a nearest
neighbour search for the departing player to look for
a replacement with a similar PPM and PxGM style,
and similar position. This search will be conducted
on the aggregate last two seasons of both players –
the seasons in which they played with Sánchez. These
possible replacements, identified with the help of the
Euclidean distance nearest neighbours for PxGMs
and PPMs, are shown in Table 10 for Mesut Özil,
and Table 11 for Nacho Monreal.

5.2. (Hypothetical) manager replacement

A similar analysis can be done for team style anal-
ysis. 2016 marked the 20th anniversary of Arsène
Wenger as Arsenal’s head coach. Judging from the
void left by Alex Ferguson at Manchester United
when he retired in 2013 after a 26 year reign, it would
be very difficult to replace a manager that shaped a
team for such a long period of time. To be able to make
a smooth transition whenever Wenger leaves Arsenal,
finding a manager that coached a team with a similar
play style to that of Arsène might help smooth this
eventual transition.

To find such managers we conduct a search for
coaches that managed teams with a similar style in
one season, when compared to the aggregate style of
Arsenal over 4 seasons. In Table 12 the coaches that
are close to Arsenal on both TPMs and TxGMs are
depicted.

5.3. Strategic improvements

In Section 4.4 we show that some goal attempt
motifs occur more frequently then others and that the
average value of a goal attempt differs significantly
depending on the type of motif executed. When look-
ing at these two aspects for Arsenal it is possible to

Table 13

Statistics on Arsenal’s xGM’s

Motif Frequency Average goal
attempt value

ABCDG 30.2% 0.117 xG
ABG 29.5% 0.131 xG
ABCG 14.9% 0.122 xG
ABACG 8.7% 0.124 xG
ABCBG 8.0% 0.094 xG
ABCAG 5.3% 0.091 xG
ABAG 2.2% 0.110 xG
ABABG 1.1% 0.098 xG

find xG-motifs that are less effective and might hinder
Arsenal in creating even more valuable opportunities.

Table 13 shows that ABAG, ABABG, ABCBG
are executed 11.3% of the time. These motifs, end-
ing in a one-two combination, are 3 of the 4 motifs
with the lowest average goal attempt value. By
introducing a new player after the one-two combi-
nation ABAG becomes ABACG, ABABG becomes
BABCG (=ABACG), and ABCBG becomes BCBAG
(=ABACG). Extending the motif by one player
(within five seconds) to make the final attempt can
create a great amount of extra value, because ABACG
generates an average goal attempt value of 0.124 xG
as opposed to 0.110, 0.098 and 0.094. For instance a
reduction of just 1% for both ABAG, ABABG and
ABCBG, and thus an increase of 3% in ABACG
would help Arsenal from a weighted average of 0.110
xG per goal attempt motif to 0.120 xG per goal
attempt motif – an increase of 9%.

6. Threshold sensitivity

In Gyarmati et al. (2014), in Pena and Navarro
(2015) and in this article, the maximum time between
passes (the threshold) was set at 5 seconds. In Fig. 12
we depict the impact of varying the threshold on
the number of passing motifs per team per game
in the first season of every league in the data set.
We see that using 6 seconds through infinity, leads
to the inclusion of almost every motif imaginable,
and every pass made in the game with the excep-
tion of pass sequences shorter than 3 passes. We
find that using 1 or 2 seconds also seems insensible
with on average just 2.65 and 9.1 motifs per team
per game respectively, rendering player play style
analysis impossible.

Another important aspect to look at is the dis-
tance travelled by the player with the ball between
passes. This metric, along with the time spent on

Fig. 12. Threshold sensitivity on team motifs.

Fig. 13. Travel distance between passes.

the ball (time between passes), seems to be an intu-
itively appealing parameter to discern what should,
and should not, be included in a passing motif. A
scenario in which a player covers half the pitch after
receiving a pass, and subsequently passing the ball to
a team mate could be perceived as not all being part
of the same passing motif.

Distance travelled while on the ball is calculated by
converting all pass coordinates to meters, using the
appropriate pitch dimensions of all home team sta-
diums and subsequently calculating the straight line

distance travelled using the end coordinates of the
previous pass and the start coordinates of the current
pass. In Fig. 13 we show the distribution of straight
line distance travelled (D) for 3, 4 and 5 seconds on
the ball (Tb) excluding outliers. We see that for 3
seconds the maximum lies at 15 meters and the first
75% of the data includes passes up to 6.5 meters.
For 4 seconds the maximum lies at 21 meters, with
75% of data below 9.6 meters and for 5 seconds most
passes are below 28 meters with 75% of passes shorter
than 13 meters. We conclude that using 5 seconds is
reasonable, considering most passes do not cover a
length of more than 12.5% of the length of the pitch.
Furthermore, we suggest that both these parameters
(threshold and distance travelled) should be taken in
to consideration while doing analyses of this kind in
the future.

7. Conclusion

In this article, we show how to utilize the flow
motif methodology to analyze passing behavior in
soccer. We use a large data set comprising 4 seasons
of 6 major soccer leagues with over 8000 matches,
over 3500 unique players and 155 unique teams. This
methodology was applied to both teams and individ-
ual players to analyze their possession game as well



J. Bekkers and S. Dabadghao / Flow motifs in soccer: What can passing behavior tell us? 311

as their goal attempts. We also show how to interpret
the results and draw insights from them. Our contri-
bution also helps representing the motifs in a novel
way – by using the radar graphs which are very useful
to compare players or teams across various seasons.

Unique styles for both teams and players can be
found by clustering them based on their motif use.
We find that Paris Saint-Germain is in a cluster by
itself indicating its unique style, and FC Barcelona
and Bayern Munich are in their own cluster, being
heavily influenced by Pep Guardiola. We identify
three players with unique styles; Iniesta, Rafinha and
Denswil. We find that players with similar styles can
be scouted easily by searching for those with similar
motif use. This aided us in the search for the heir to
Xavi’s throne, the identification of possible replace-
ments for Özil and Monreal, and the hypothetical
replacement for Wenger at Arsenal.

These analyses can be extended to identify differ-
ences in styles between the two halves of the game,
whether a change in the style of a team follows a
certain trend and even analyze two players simul-
taneously by studying their joint passing behaviour
and impact on team performance. Powered by the
availability of data and this analysis, it is now possi-
ble to explore many more questions about the sport
providing us with valuable insight that has strategic
implications on the game.
