Abstract. In football, many people argue that in knock-out competitions the team that plays the second game in its stadium
would have an advantage, a greater probability of victory in the final outcome of a two leg knock-out match. The purpose of
this study is to verify the veracity of this statement using data from the Brazil Cup. We find evidence that the ability spread
between the teams participating in a match is the main factor that explains the qualification of one of the teams for the next
round. Until 2018, there were three criteria for break the tie in the Brazil Cup, they were used in the respectively order: goal
difference, away goals rule, penalty shootout (there is no extra-time in any play-off of the championship). It is estimated that
36% of the matches end tied and need a criterion to determine the winner. Of these, 51% use the goal difference decision,
29% use the away goals rule and 20% penalty shoot-out. When considering the championship in general there is evidence that
the home team wins the match in approximately 63% of the matches, a significant advantage. However, in the confrontations
that were decided by the away goals rule or the penalty shoot-out, the home team wins percentage is 20% lower, indicating
that these criteria level the odds of both teams.

1. Introduction

Widely studied, the home advantage has appeared
as a consistent and sturdy effect in a large number
of research articles in a lot of different sports, see
for instance (Pollard 2006; Page and Page 2007), and
references therein.

Many of these studies show that this advantage
exists also for football, on several tournaments around
the world. The phenomenon has a historical origin,
occurring for more than 100 years in England (Pol-
lard 1986). However, there has been a decline in this
advantage, possibly due to changes in the rules, such
as the increase in the number of points gained per
win, among others that minimise the defensive posi-
tioning of the visiting team (Sánchez et al. 2009). The
main factors considered to cause the home advantage
effects are: crowd, travel fatigue, familiarity with the
pitch, referee bias, territoriality, special tactics, rules
and psychological factors (Pollard 2008). It is esti-
mated that the average advantage is 61.5% in the
world and 64% in South America, being measured
as a percentage of points earned at home on the
total points earned (Pollard 2006). However, for local
derbies, it is concluded that the advantage of play-
ing in their stadium is significantly lower (Pollard
1986; Seckin and Pollard 2008). In some countries,
such as Turkey and Spain, it turns out that there is
no significant difference between the advantage of

playing in their domains for the first and second
division championships (Seckin and Pollard 2008;
Sánchez et al. 2009). However, in Brazil, in (Almeida,
Oliveira, and Silva 2011), Almeida et al. showed that
average percentages of approximately 65% in Series
A and 69% in Series B of the Brazilian Champi-
onship are observed (significantly at p-value 0.05).
The authors cite some factors like condition of the sta-
diums and bigger traveling distances to explain this
difference of the home advantage in Series B and A
of Brazilian Championship, the study analyses both
championship from 2003 and 2009.

Analysing the existence of regional discrepancies
in the home advantage among the countries of Europe
and South America, where the main leagues are close
to the world average, it is reported that this varia-
tion is mainly due to geographical locations (Pollard
2006), it is concluded that the advantage is greatest
in remote and ethnically distinct places (Seckin and
Pollard 2008).

The size and weather diversity of Brazil make the
effect of travelling possibly more important than in
other countries. Significant results for first division
of the Brazilian Championship were obtained indi-
cating that 0.115 more goals are expected for the
home team every 1000 km travelled by the visiting
team (Pollard, Da Silva, and Nı́sio 2008). Besides,
the second division, as well the Brazil Cup, includes
less expressive clubs, that usually play in small stadi-
ums, which can give the feeling of a greater presence
of the fans, consequently increasing the pressure on
the players, especially on the visitors. Another rel-
evant point is the field conditions, which are often
worse, making familiarity with the venue an even
more decisive factor in the advantage of playing at
home.

There are several studies on the advantage of play-
ing at home, but few have as objective to identify the
existence of advantage in confrontations of simple
knock-out; in particular, to the best of our knowledge
there are no articles in the literature that address the
effects of the away goals rule. In two-stages knock-
out competitions, it has been reported an advantage
for the team that plays the second leg at home (Page
and Page 2007). A significant advantage is identi-
fied: the classification percentage is 54.98% for the
team playing the second game at home, in the average
of three championships analysed, namely Champions
League, UEFA Cup and Cup Winner Cup; controlling
the analysis for the ability of the teams, the advantage
is 54.33%. It is estimated, from a logistic regression fit
to the data, that the probability of this team to win the

match, adjusted for ability, is 53.77%, significantly
favourable to it. In addition, it is concluded that the
advantage remained over time, but has a significant
downward trend, as was identified in the leagues of
running points (Page and Page 2007).

When single elimination matches are tied in num-
ber of points, a criterion is necessary to define the
winner; the three most used are:

• Goals difference, GD: the team that scores the
most goals wins;

• Away goals rule, AGR: the team that scores the
most goals when playing away from home wins;

• Penalties shoot-out, PN: the team that scores
more goals in the alternating penalty shoot-out
wins.

The AGR is currently used in the major champi-
onships worldwide. Considering that at the end of the
first game the outcome of that match is fixed (i.e. the
team that played as a visitor can no longer change the
number of goals scored away from home), it turns
out that in the second game only one team can mod-
ify that criterion. That is, in the second game, both
teams can try to improve/change the first two criteria
of classification (score and GD), but only the visitor
has the chance to change the third. For this reason,
the AGR may manifest as an advantage (or at least
an equalisation) for the visiting team of the second
game, in two ways: minimising the home team offen-
sive posture, and by the possibility of changing this
criterion when the other team can not do it any more.

Thus, the present study aims to investigate whether
having the field command in the second match of
a knock-out match represents an advantage; in par-
ticular, to see how certain characteristics (such as
the ability of the teams participating and the use of
the away goal, for example) influence this supposed
advantage.

2. Hypotheses

The hypotheses that will be analyzed in this work,
based on the literature review and personal knowl-
edge, through popular beliefs, are:

• The main determining factor for a team’s classi-
fication is the difference in quality between the
participants of the confrontation.

• The SLHT probability of classification is greater
than 0.5, representing the advantage of play-
ing the second match of a Knock-out in their
stadium.



A.P. Waquil et al. / Home advantage and away goals rule 15

• When using the away goals rule or penalties
shoot-out the SLHT probability of classification
is approximately 0.5, regardless of the quality
difference.

3. Methodology

3.1. Database

The main objective of this study is to analyse
the advantage of deciding football play-offs (consist-
ing in two matches) at home, especially to measure
the influence, if any, of the away goals rule on this
advantage. Our database consisted of 1662 knock-out
rounds of Brazil Cup (Copa do Brasil) from 1994 to
20171.

For the analysis we considered 1093 play-offs
(2186 individual matches). From the original 1662,
we excluded:2

• 288 observations in which the confrontation was
decided in only one game, since it was not the
scope of this study.

• 203 observations from qualifying rounds
because they also do not have the characteris-
tics in focus in the research (generally there are
great ability discrepancies among the teams, in
addition to approximately 44% of them being
defined in only one game).

• 11 observations that were defined by punish-
ments, that is, legal decisions that have no
relation to the practice of sports.

• 5 observations where the away goals rule could
not be applied. The rules of the competition pro-
vide that in the situation where the venue is
considered neutral, the away goals rule can not
be applied, these happened twice. In 2015, 2016
and 2017 it was also determined that in the finals
the rule would not applied. Since it is considered
that the simple possibility of using the rule mod-
ifies the characteristics of the confrontation, it
was chosen to exclude these 5 knock-outs from
the analysis.

1The years from 1989 to 1993 were not used because it was not
possible to determine adequately the ability of the teams, which
will be discussed below.

2Some confrontations are in more than one situation, for exam-
ple a confrontation that were from a qualifying round and had just
one game.

3.2. Data collection and model

The database was collected and organized by
the authors. Data are widely disclosed, and can be
consulted on the CBF website and also in special-
ized websites such as http://www.bolanaarea.com/.
Throughout the paper, we will call the team playing
at home the second game as second leg home team,
SLHT, and the team playing at home the first game as
the first leg home team, FLHT. Differently of most of
the consulted papers, the home advantage is not mea-
sured as a percentage of points earned at home on the
total points earned, as knock-out matches are being
analysed in these study: instead, we will be interested
in analysing a binary response variable y which repre-
sents the outcome, after both games, of the second leg
home team (1 if it qualifies and 0 otherwise); this is
similar to the approach adopted in (Page and Page
2007). Besides, we believe that this methodology
could also be used to measure the home advantage in
one leg championships, not only in knock-out compe-
titions, considering as home advantage only the cases
that the home team wins the match.

One of our hypotheses is that the main component
explaining the outcome of a play-off is the ability
spread3 between the teams participating in the match.
Therefore, based on the 2016’s criterion of the Brazil-
ian Football Confederation (CBF 2014) we created a
proxy variable that measures the overall ability of
each team in the sample, on a yearly basis.

In some years, at the first stages, the seeding system
allocates the “better” teams as the SLHT. The fact the
draw is not totally random means we should expect
the SLHT qualifies with a higher percentage in the
play-offs. However, as did (Page and Page 2007), we
can accurately assess the real effect of the second
leg home advantage controlling for the differences in
teams’ ability.

The proxy variable ability was constructed as fol-
lows. Each team receives a score according to its final
classification in the Brazilian Championship and the
Brazil Cup. In addition, they receive a bonus score as
compensation if they have been prevented from com-
peting in the Brazilian Cup due to conflict of dates
with their participation in the South American and
Libertadores Cups. The score is calculated at the end
of each year as a weighted average of the last five
years’ points. It should be emphasised that the score
of a team in any given year does not depend on his

FLHT. See the discussion below.

result on that year, only on the previous ones – this
prevents endogeneity of the variable ability.

A simple points in the standings or a prior year fin-
ish in a championship has not been used because the
teams that play the Brazilian Cup change from year
to year. Also, since Brazil is a continental country, it
is needed to travel long distances sometimes to play,
for this reason it is common that a team prioritizes
one championship over the other. Therefore a ranking
that looks to just one championship may not reflect
the reality of a team that decided to not prioritize that
competition. Overall looking to a bigger period of
time permit us to look not only to the “moment” of a
team but also how well he is being administered, how
much competitive he is over the previous years. Off
course, the fact that the proxy gives more weight on
the achievements of the year just before it is computed
means that last results obtained are the most important
element in the ability, however it is not the only one.

In the adjusted models, we used a standardisa-
tion of the difference between the teams’ scores, as
a proxy for their ability spread, similar to the idea of
(Page and Page 2007). It is noticed that this variable,
besides representing the ability spread, also captures
the variation between the phases of the competition,
since the spread in abilities decreases as one advances
from 32th to 16th to 8th and so on. Likewise, the vari-
ation between the years is mainly due to changes in
the ability of each team. Another reason to use this
variable is to analyze the hypotheses cited above.

The unstandardised ability spread, ABUi , for each
two-leg match i = 1, . . . , n, where n = 1093, is given
by

AB
U
i = Ability of SLHTi − Ability of FHLTi

The standardised ability spread (hereafter simply
ability spread) is then defined by

ABi =
ABUi

sd

where sd is the sample standard deviation of the
unstandardised ability spread. We chose not to sub-
tract the mean in the standardised ability spread, ABi,
so that the values were centred at zero4. In this way,
negative values represent play-offs in which the abil-
ity of the SLHT is inferior to that of the FLHT, while

4The sample mean of the ability spread is equal to 0.65, a
positive value, indicating that there is a slight imbalance in the
sense that better teams tend to have the field command. This fact
is an indication that, at least in a part of the confrontations that
compose our sample, there is no randomisation in the assignment
of field command.

positive values correspond to play-offs where the
SLHT has superior ability. An ability spread equal
to one standard deviation represents a difference of
5694.89 points in the original index5.

In order to estimate the probability of classifica-
tion of the SHLT in the Brazil Cup, relating to the
ability spread and criteria used to decide the winner,
we adjusted a logistic regression model. For this, the
response variable is the classification of SLHT and
the explanatory components considered in the model
are the ability spread (AB) and the type of decision,
which is a polytomic categorical variable. Therefore,
three dummies were introduced, for goal difference,
away goals rule and penalties shoot-out (respectively
GD, AGR and PN), maintaining the classification
by points as a reference category. In addition, we
included the interactions between the ability spread
and each dummy in the adjustment.

In preliminary studies, we also adjusted two addi-
tional models. The first, a logistic regression with
the reduced database, containing only the confronta-
tions of the final stages – round of 16, quarter-finals,
semi-finals and final. However, the results were sim-
ilar to those obtained by the regression that will
be described next, and thus we chose to use all
data to avoid discarding information. In the second
model, the dependence between the same response
and covariates as above was estimated through a
non-parametric fit to the data, yielding once again
results that were ‘close’ to those obtained through
the logistic regression approach,indicating that the
parametric adjustment is suitable; results are pre-
sented in the Appendix A.1, more details about this
methodology in (Hayfield and Racine 2008) and (Bar-
bosa and Brandão 2017). Since both preliminary
fits yielded results similar to the logistic regression
adjustment described below, we refrain from provid-
ing the detailed analysis.

Therefore, the final adjusted model is

g(xi) = ln
(

π(xi)
1 − π(xi)

)
= β0 + β1ABi + β2GDi

+β3AGRi + β4PNi + β5ABi × GDi + β6ABi
×AGRi + β7ABi × PNi,

i = 1, . . . n, where π(x) is the probability of the SLHT
winning the two-leg knock-out match given the value
of the covariate vector x, that is π(x) = Pr(y = 1|x).
This model is useful to understand the phenomenon

of the advantage of playing at home the second match
of a play-off, as well as some features that may have
an influence on this advantage.

3.3. The independence assumption: A discussion

Independence between observations is an impor-
tant feature because it ensures good statistical
properties for the maximum likelihood estimators of
the model parameters. In the case of the Brazil Cup,
the participating teams might be repeated over the
years and, more specifically, some are repeated along
different phases during the same year, as they advance
in the competition. For example, the information that
a certain team has already won a play-off as FLHT
certainly alters the likelihood that the same team will
win a new showdown at a later stage in which they
play as FLHT: there are indications that this team
has competence to qualify when he does not play the
second game at home. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that there is some correlation between certain
characteristics of the sample units. However, in each
phase, new play-offs are formed, defined by a previ-
ous draw, so that the home teams at the second leg
are largely randomised. In addition, the ability of each
team is maintained, but the ability spreads between
the participants are different, so the characteristics of
the new observation, at worst, have weak dependence
on the characteristics of the previous observation, not
enough to violate the hypotheses that legitimise the
estimation procedures adopted herein. Moreover, in
the present study the observational units are the two-
leg matches, not the particular participants of each
confrontation and the response variable considered
here is the classification, or not, of the SLHT.

We argue that the characteristics that are corre-
lated between the confrontations, as the participating
teams, do not cause problems since they are not used
in the adjusted models. Even when a team repeats
itself in two different play-offs of the same year,
the ability spread of that confrontation (which is
likely the main factor influencing the classification
probabilities) is bound to change, as said team will
necessarily face a different opponent. Thus, even
supposing there is prior information on whom the
participants in the confrontation are, it is not known
who the FLHT will be (because of randomised assign-
ment), so there is no indication as to the likelihood of
the response6.

6For most of the confrontations in our sample, the FLHT was
decided randomly; however, we couldn’t obtain the information of

Finally, we chose to use logistic regression, despite
the knowledge that there are insurmountable lim-
itations to this approach because of the possible
existence of a correlation between the observational
units, even though the responses are independent. A
possible alternative is the use of mixed models, which
would add a random-effects term for the year of the
clashes, so that the correlation between clashes of
the same team would be controlled by the year of
the competition. However, in a preliminary study we
found it has led to results similar to those obtained
by the fixed-effects-only logistic regression that we
adopt herein; additional results are presented in the
Appendix A.2. Comparing the AIC of the two regres-
sions the difference is 1.65, being 1255.32 for the
mixed model and 1253.67 for the fixed-effects-only
logistic regression. In the same way, the difference
between the estimated coefficients is not relevant and
both give the same conclusions about significances.
Therefore, for convenience of the reader, we chose to
adopt the more parsimonious model.

4. Results

4.1. Descriptive

In the tournament, 44.19% of the play-offs have the
direct qualification of the SLHT, that is without tie in
the aggregated result. However, when looking only
the observation of the final stages, this percentage
decreases to 37.25%. On the other hand, the percent-
age of tied play-offs (which will be defined by some
of the criteria) remains around 36% when consider-
ing the whole tournament or only the final stages,
divided into about 19% of SLHT qualified and 17%
of the FLHT.

The SLHT has qualified in 63,31% of the play-offs,
significantly more than half (p-value <0.0001), with
CI = 0.6331 ± 0.0286. On the other hand, consider-
ing only the play-offs from the sixteenth rounds, this
percentage decreases to 56.96%, and it is also signif-
icantly more than half the clashes (p-value = 0.0004),
with CI = 0.5696 ± 0.0385. Although both are larger
than 0.5, it can be noted that the estimates of the
intervals are quite different. This is because, in the
final stages, the disparity in the ability of the teams is
smaller, so that the visitor can win more often, even
though the SLHT persists with the advantage.

Table 1 presents the percentages of aggregate
results and classification. The Fig. 1 presents the per-
centages of the aggregated results (Chart (a)) and
the percentages of classification (Chart (b)) over the
years, in order to analyse if there are also differences
between the years.

In the two graphs, it is identified that there is a
variation between the years, but mainly in the pro-
portions of the results. This is due to the phases that
were disputed. In the years in which the champi-
onship had more stages, there were more observations
in the initial phases, in which there was no draw to
decide the SLHT, often it was the one with better
ability, consequently, happened more victories of the
SLHT. In the classification chart, the behaviour seems
to be more constant, especially after 2002, when it
started the phase thirty-second round. This indicates

that, although the points in the play-offs is consider-
ably variable, the final outcome, the qualification, is
relatively constant over the years.

Figure 2 presents the percentages of qualifica-
tion in each round of Brazil Cup. It is possible to
identify that in the two initial rounds, the SLHT
wins approximately 72% of the play-offs, with
CI = 0.7225 ± 0.0414, significantly more than half
(p-value<0.0001). In addition, this percentage in the
early stages is also significantly higher than in the
final stages (p-value <0.0001), whose percentage is
56.96%, which is also significantly higher than 0.5
(p-value = 0.0004), with CI = 0.5696 ± 0.0385. This
again evidences that the ability spreads between the
teams of final stages play-offs is smaller than in
the beginning. So, even if the SLHT team has an
advantage, the FLHT manages to win more than
in the early stages. However, if only post eighth
rounds are considered, then the percentage is 51.99%,
matching the SLHT and FLHT rating percentages
(p-value = 0.4563), CI = 0.5199 ± 0.0525.

In the cup finals, the percentage of victory of
the SLHT is 31.58%, much lower than in the other
phases. It is the only one that shows an advantage for
the FLHT, but it is important to note that this figure
is calculated with only 19 observations.

4.1.1. Tied play-offs
Considering our data, 388 play-offs were tied

in points after the two games. Among them,

final stages, significantly more than half (p-value

observations, there are more ties in the final stages,
since the qualities of teams are more balanced. Table 2
shows the frequencies of qualification of the SLHT
and also the frequencies of use of the criteria, com-
paring the whole championship with only the final
rounds.

It can be noticed that, considering only the con-
frontations of the final stages and in the championship
as a whole, the percentages are maintained for each
team qualified and for criterion. It is identified that the
SLHT qualifies in about 53% of the play-offs. Consid-
ering the whole tournament or the final stages, there
is no evidence that this value is significantly different
from 50% (p-values 0.1279 and 0.2986), indicating
that, in tied play-offs, there is no advantage for any

of the two teams. In addition, the main criterion of
tiebreaker is the goal difference, used in about half
of the observations, followed by away goals rule and
penalties.

Table 3 shows the percentage of qualification of
SLHT and FLHT in each criterion of breaking the
tie. It is observed that the SLHT has a significant
advantage (p-value = 0.0006) only when the play-off
is decided in the goal difference, whose confidence
interval is 0.6224 ± 0.0678. The use of the other
criterion does not result in a significant advantage,
however, they equate the probability of the two
teams – p-values respectively 0.2214 and 0.5737 for
away goals rule, which has CI = 0.5575 ± 0.2066, and
penalties, with CI = 0.5316 ± 0.1743.

Table 4 shows the percentages of qualification
for SLHT and FLHT in each type of tie-breaking
criterion, considering separately each tie possible
combination of results (after both games of the play-
off): loss of both teams playing at home (LL), both
games end with a tie (TT) and victory of the teams
playing at its stadium (WW).

4.1.2. Qualification proportion
In order to ascertain – globally and in each of the

four possible criteria for qualification – whether the
probability of victory of the SLHT in play-offs of the
Brazil Cup is equal to 0.5, that is, if the two teams have
equal probabilities of qualification, we estimated the
respective proportions and confidence intervals. The
results are presented in Table 5.

Considering all the play-offs, the SLHT quali-
fication ratio is 63.31%, significantly higher than

the classification in more than half of the play-
offs. This confirms the SLHT has an advantage.
The same happens in the play-offs that were
decided by points and goal difference, with esti-
mates of 68.51%, CI = 0.6851 ± 0.0344, and 62.24%,
CI = 0.6224 ± 0.0684, respectively. However, when
considering observations that were decided by the
away goals rule or penalty shoot-out, the proportions
are 44.25% and 46.84%, respectively. Therefore, in
these cases, there is no evidence that any team has
a qualifying advantage: both confidence intervals
include the value 0.5.

When the play-off ends tied and it is necessary
to use away goals rule or penalties as the criterion
of definition, the two teams have equal probabilities
of qualifying. However, knowing that the decision
was through points or goal difference, then it is more
likely that the SLHT will win.

4.2. Regression parameters

The estimated coefficients and their respective
significance, obtained by the Wald’s test, after the
estimation of the logistic model, are described in the
Table 6. It is found that only the spread in ability
is individually significant. However, the interactions
of the ability spread with each type of classification
are significant. Thus, there is evidence that the prob-
ability of victory of the SLHT, given each type of
qualification, changes according to the ability spread
between the teams of the play-off. Therefore, these
results demonstrate that all the variables of the model
are important to explain the probability of qualifica-
tion of the SLHT in the Brazil Cup.

Although in the significance tests the classifica-
tion types are not significant according to Table 6,
we see in Table 7 that the model with these variables,
even without the interactions, presents a gain with
respect to the ROC curve considering the model that
uses only the ability spread. In order to check this,
two tests were done comparing the deviance’s of the
models. For that, three models were adjusted: the first
one is the complete one, previously described; in the

second, all variables were maintained, but the inter-
actions were withdrawn; the third model considers as
co-variate only the ability spread.

The result of this analysis is that the model 1 is
significantly more informative than model 2, which
is significantly more informative than model 3. There-
fore, removing the interactions reduces the likelihood
of the model, and removing the indicators causes it
to decreases further. Therefore, the variable quali-
fication type, when considered globally, is in fact
significant to explain the probability of classification
of the SLHT. The comparison between models 1 and
3 informs that, together, the type of qualification and
the interaction with the ability spread significantly
improves the explanation of the model.

In addition, in order to ascertain that ability spread
is the most important variable for classification, we
have done tests comparing the values of the areas
under the ROC curve, the DeLong test. The values
are described in Table 7. It is observed that for the
first three models, which include the ability spread,
the predictive capacity is above 70%. However, by
removing this variable from the model, the predictive
capacity has a large reduction, decreasing to 58.41%.

The results of the tests, which allow us to identify
the significance of the decrease in predictive capacity
of the model, are presented in Table 8. It is veri-
fied that the interactions, the type of qualification and
the ability spread are important variables, since the
withdrawal causes a significant decrease in the area
below the curve. However, ability spread is the vari-
able whose inclusion that results in greater predictive

capacity increase, corroborating the hypothesis that
this is the most important variable for the model.

The estimated probabilities are represented in
Fig. 3. Each point in the graph represents an observa-
tion: the cases where the SLHT qualified are arranged
in row 1, whereas in the 0 line are those whose result
was defeat of the SLHT. The horizontal position of
each point represents the ability spread of the teams
of this play-off, so the closer to 0 a value is, the greater
the equivalence in the qualities of the teams.

Analysing the probabilities as AB becomes more
positive, that is, the more ability the SLHT has over
the FLHT, it turns out that, for the SLHT, the criterion
that leads to the highest probabilities of classification
is the penalty shoot-out until the difference is –0.43
standard deviation. Then the highest probability is for
the goal difference, until the SLHT is 0.09 standard
deviation the better. Above this value the most likely
criterion is points.

For the FLHT, the highest probability happens
when the decision is by points while this team is much
better than the principal. When the difference is –0.42
standard deviations, the best criterion for the FLHT
is the away goals rule, this is maintained until the

ability spread is 1.50 standard deviations, after that
the penalty shoot-out becomes the criterion in which
the qualification of the FLHT is more likely.

The away goals rule is never the best criterion for
the SLHT because the probabilities are always lower.
It should be noted that this does not mean that these
teams can not use these criterion, only that there is
always another one that provides a higher qualifica-
tion probability. Although the teams do not choose
the criterion used, at most it can set up a strategy
that aims at a certain type of decision, but it does not
depend only on the team.

To complement the analysis, the Fig. 4 presents a
chart with four graphs, one for each curve exposed
in the previous figure, estimated by the complete
model. The curves were separated into four graphs
only for easy visualisation. In each graph, the cen-
treline represents the estimation of the pointed of
probability, while the dotted lines represent the corre-
sponding confidence intervals. According to Table 2,
the goal difference was used in 196 play-offs, the
away goals rule in 113 and the penalty shoot-out in
79, which influences the precision of the confidence
intervals. The other 705 observations were decided by
the points and therefore did not use any tie-breaker
criterion.

In the matches defined by away goals rule or
penalty shootings, the estimates are less accurate
because of the small number of observations. It can
be noticed that the confidence intervals are wide for
all ability spreads. However, for values of the abil-
ity spread close to 0, the confidence intervals have
the smallest amplitudes. This is because most of the
observations that used these criterion had small abil-
ity spreads, that is, when teams have similar qualities.
Despite the large amplitude, these estimates bring
relevant information. Since the range contains the
value equal to 0.5, for all ability spreads, then for
the two criteria, teams have the same qualification
probabilities, regardless of the ability spread.

5. Discussion

Throughout this work, we found evidence that,
on the aggregate, there exists home advantage on
play-offs of Brazil Cup: the SLHT qualifies in
approximately 63% of disputes (significantly higher
than 0.5, p-value <0.0001). This is in agreement with
the literature that has proven a similar advantage for
others play-offs championships. However, when the
play-off is decided by away goals rule or penalties the
percentage of classification is about 20% lower than

the general percentage. These criteria significantly
benefit the FLHT, if not giving the advantage, at least
equating the probabilities of the two teams (p-values
respectively 0.2229 and 0.5770).

The use of the away goals rule or penalties as
a tiebreaker criterion decreases the probability of
classification of the SLHT, considering the effects
alone or interacting with the spread in ability between
teams. On the other hand, the increase in the ability
spread has the inverse effect, because the more posi-
tive the spread, the better the SLHT is, the more likely
it is to be the winner of the match for all decision
criteria.

When the two teams of the play-off have equal
qualities, the probability of classification is equal
to 0.5 for both teams, regardless of how the play-
off was decided. That is, regardless of the criterion
used, the two participants have the same classifica-
tion probabilities when their qualities are equivalent
as described in Section 4.2.

A factor that can be considered in a future study is
the distance travelled by the teams to play the games.
Other works, such as (Pollard 2006) and (Pollard, Da
Silva, and Nı́sio 2008), have concluded that this is a
variable related to the advantage of playing a single
game in their domain. According to the discussion



A.P. Waquil et al. / Home advantage and away goals rule 23

in Section 1, in the Brazil Cup this effect, on one
match, may be even greater, due to the inclusion of
teams from all regions, resulting in great distances
and climatic variation. However, this effect is coun-
terbalanced by the fact that, in this tournament, the
matches are played in two games, so both teams must
travel the same distance and face similar climatic
variation.

In agreement with others tournaments, the team
that plays the second game at home also has an advan-
tage in the Brazil Cup. Moreover, the away goals rule
minimizes this advantage and thus makes the play-off
more unpredictable and exciting for the fans. The rule
is important as a criterion that equals the probably of
the classification of the teams in the play-off.

Appendix B. 2018 Brazil Cup

As an illustration we apply our model to fore-
cast the outcome of 30 confrontations occurring in
the 2018 Brazil Cup. The model that considers as a
regressor the ability spread alone correctly predicts
which team qualifies 70% of the time, a value that
is close to the predictive capacity estimated by the
area under the ROC curve. We have considered as a
correct prediction those confrontations in which the
winning team had an estimated probability of quali-
fying higher than 0.5.

On the other hand, the model that also takes into
account the types of decision correctly predicts the
outcome 63% of the time. In practice this 7% differ-
ence correspond to only 2 matches and is possibly
explained by the small number of predictions, as it
is very likely that the complete model has a higher
predictive ability.

In the 2018 Brazil Cup, the away goal rule is no
longer valid. Interestingly, if it were valid, 4 of the
6 confrontations that were decided by penalty shoot-
outs would have been defined by the away goal rule.
The predicted outcome was the same in both criteria,
but in 2 confrontations the qualified team would be
the other one, the FLHT in both cases. In the other 2
confrontations the team that won the penalty shoot-
outs would have won by the away goal rule, one was
the SLHT e the other was the FLHT.
