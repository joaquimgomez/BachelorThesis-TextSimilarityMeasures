Abstract—Bicycle-sharing systems, which can provide shared
bike usage services for the public, have been launched in many big
cities. In bicycle-sharing systems, people can borrow and return
bikes at any stations in the service region very conveniently.
Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a short-
distance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular
public transportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different
places in the service region, the bike usages can be quite skewed
and imbalanced. Some stations have too many incoming bikes
and get jammed without enough docks for upcoming bikes,
while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough
bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential
destinations and arriving time of each individual trip beforehand
can effectively help the service providers schedule manual bike
re-dispatch in advance. In this paper, we will study the individual
trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharing systems. To address
the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing system and
analyze individuals’ bike usage behaviors first. Based on the anal-
ysis results, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration
inference model will be introduced. Experiments conducted on a
real-world bicycle-sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed model.

I. INTRODUCTION
Bicycle-sharing system refers to a public transportation

service system in urban areas offering bicycles for shared use
to individuals in a relatively short period of time (about 30−45
minutes) for free or with very low charges [10]. In bicycle-
sharing systems, people can borrow bikes from stations near
them and return the bike to any stations in the city, which can
be used as a short-distance trip supplement for private vehicles
as well as regular public transportation (e.g., buses and metro
trains). Bicycle-sharing system is green and of low carbon,
and each bike can be used by several people per day. What’s
more, due to the widely spread branches and stations available
in the city, people can usually borrow and return the bikes
very conveniently without wasting time on waiting (needed for
the public transportation) or concerns about parking issues in
cities (of private vehicles). As a result, bicycle-sharing systems
are becoming more and more popular nowadays, which have
been adopted in many large cities, e.g., Chicago (Divvy Bike),
New York (Citi Bike), San Francisco (Bay Area Bike Share),
Washington, D.C. (Capital Bikeshare).

Bicycle-sharing system allows people to borrow bikes with
either “one-day pass” or “annual subscribed membership”.

“One-day pass” is usually preferred by people for temporary
usages, e.g., tourist for short-time sightseeing, but the charges
per day are slightly higher. Meanwhile, “subscribed member-
ship” is a great option for people with frequent travel needs,
e.g., office worker and students. Generally, trips completed
by one-day pass/membership holders within 30 minutes are
included in the pass/membership, but trips longer than 30-
minutes may incur overtime fees. More information about the
detailed pricing rules is available at Divvy’s official website1.

Unlike traditional fixed-route public transportation at pre-
scheduled time, services provided by bicycle-sharing systems
are more flexible and can meet the daily travel needs of
different categories of users. Bicycle-sharing system provides a
more microscopic perspective to understand individuals’ travel
behaviors, which include various aspects about the trips, e.g.,
trip origin station and start time, as well as trip destination
stations and end time. Generally, the travel behaviors of
different categories of people with various travel purposes can
be quite different. For instance, tourists with one-day pass
tend to use the bike to travel among attraction spots, while
registered subscribers (like workers and students) mainly travel
between companies/schools and homes with the bike.

Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in the
city, the bike usage can be quite skewed and imbalanced
[7]. Some stations that individuals like to borrow bikes from
will lack enough bikes for people to check out, while some
other stations that people normally return the bikes to will
get jammed easily without enough docks for upcoming bikes.
To support such a claim, we also analyze the real-world
bicycle-sharing system data (to be introduced in Section II),
and count the numbers of bikes borrowed from/returned to
each stations respectively. According to the analysis results,
among all the 474 stations, 470 of them have historical usage
records: 235 stations have more bikes being checked out (i.e., #
bikes checked out># bikes returned), 234 of them have more
returned bikes (i.e., # bikes checked out<# bikes returned),
and only one station (station ID: 449) has balanced usages
(i.e., # bikes checked out=# bikes returned). Therefore, one
of the most challenging task for the effective operations of
bicycle-sharing systems is to manually shift and rebalance the
bikes from the jammed stations to the empty ones. Monitoring

the bike usage and inferring the potential destinations of
individuals’ trips in advance (e.g., at the moment when indi-
viduals borrow a bike and start their trips) can help the service
providers schedule the manual bike re-dispatch beforehand.
Problem Studied: In this paper, we propose to predict the
potential destination station and arriving time when people
start their trips and check out bikes from the origin station at
the very beginning. The problem is formally defined as the
“trip prediction” problem.

The trip prediction problem is an interesting yet important
research problem, which is also very challenging to address
as individuals’ bike trips can be quite complicated and depend
on various factors:
• Users Composition: The user composition of bicycle-

sharing systems can be quite diverse, which include
both (1) long-term registered subscribers and short-term
temporary users, (2) male users and female users, as
well as (3) young, mid-aged and senior users. The trip
prediction problem can be strongly correlated to user
categories, and a clear categorization of the bike users
can be the prerequisite for addressing the problem.

• Temporal Travel Patterns: Start time of a trip is another
important factor that may influence individuals’ travel
behavior as well as the trip prediction problem. Consider,
for example, when a registered member (e.g., a student)
borrows a bike in the morning on workdays, it is highly
likely that he/she will go to a school for classes. Ana-
lyzing the individuals’ historical temporal travel patterns
will help predict the trips more accurately.

• Spatial Travel Patterns: Besides the time factor, the origin
location is another important factor affecting the trip and
individuals’ travel behaviors. For instance, if a temporary
one-day pass holder borrows a bike from a station at the
entrance of a sight-seeing trail, he may want to go to
the end of the trail. Studying and utilization the historical
spatial travel patterns of individuals can help improve the
trip prediction performance a lot.

To address the trip prediction problem, in this paper, we
will analyze the user composition, individuals’ temporal and
spatial travel behavior patterns of a real-world bicycle-sharing
system. Based on the analysis results, we will formulate the
trip prediction problem and introduce new models to infer both
the trip destination station and trip duration.

The remaining part of the paper is organized as follow.
In Section II, we first introduce the Divvy bicycle-sharing
system dataset and give some basic statistical information
about the dataset. The user decomposition of the bicycle-

sharing system Divvy is available in Section III. Individuals’
temporal and spatial travel patterns are studied in Section IV
and Section V respectively. Based on the analysis results,
we formulate the trip prediction problem in Section VI and
introduce the trip prediction model in Section VII, which is
evaluated in Section VIII. Finally, we discuss the related works
in Section IX and conclude the paper in Section X.

II. DIVVY DATASET DESCRIPTION

Before analyzing the individuals’ travel behaviors, we will
introduce the dataset about a real-world bicycle-sharing system
first in this section. The dataset used in this paper is about the
Divvy bicycle-sharing system initially launched in the Chicago
city on June 28, 2013. At the very beginning, Divvy had about
750 bikes at 75 stations (operating in an area spanning from
the Loop north to Berwyn Avenue, south to 59th Street, west
to Kedzie Avenue, and east to the Lake Michigan coast). A
quick expansion has been made at early 2015, and Divvy now
operates 4, 760 bicycles at 474 stations (in an area bounded
by 75th Street on the south, Touhy Avenue on the north, Lake
Michigan on the east, and Pulaski Road on the west).

The Divvy bicycle-sharing system datasets are public and
new datasets are released every two quarters, which can be
downloaded at its official website2. We downloaded the Divvy
bicycle-sharing system data on November 2, 2015, which
contains 4 separate datasets time ranging from the middle
of 2013 to the middle of 2015 respectively. The downloaded
datasets include the complete historical trip records as well
as the station information, whose statistical information and
detailed descriptions are available in Table I and as follows.
• Trip: Each trip record in the datasets has a unique ID.

From the trip record data, we can know the trip start
and end time as well as the corresponding origin and
destination bike stations. The trip record also indicates
whether the user is an annual membership holder or just
an one-day pass holder, who are called the “subscriber”
and “customer” respectively. For the annual membership
subscribers, the trip record data also includes their gender
and birth year information, which is helpful for catego-
rizing the users (into male vs female, as well as youth vs
senior) and allows us to study the bike-usage behaviors
of different categories of people.

• Station: For each station, we can know its ID, name as
well as its specific location, which is represented as a
(latitude, longitude) coordinate pair in the dataset. At
stations, bikes are locked at the docks and the numbers
of docks available at the stations are called the station
capacities, which are also available in the datasets.

As shown in Table I, the numbers of trips in these 4
separate datasets are 2013 Q3-Q4: 759, 788; 2014 Q1-Q2:
905, 699; 2014 Q3-Q4: 1, 548, 935; 2015 Q1-Q2: 1, 096, 239
respectively. Generally, the Chicago people like to use the
Divvy bike a lot and, on average, 179, 610 trips were taken in
each month during the past two years. Meanwhile, the number
of stations doesn’t change in the first 3 datasets (which are all
300), and increases to 474 in the last dataset because of the
scheduled expansions at the beginning of 2015.

In the following sections, we will study the datasets in great
detail to analyze the user composition, individuals’ temporal
travel patterns, and spatial travel patterns respectively. Based
on the analysis results, we will introduce the trip prediction
problem and the model to address the problem.

III. DIVVY USER COMPOSITION

To predict the trips taken by users in bicycle-sharing sys-
tems, we need to understand the composition of people using
the bike at first. By studying the historical trip record data,
we count up the numbers of trips taken by “customers” and
“subscribers” respectively among the Divvy users and the
statistical results are shown in Figure 1.

From Figure 1, we observe that the majority of trips are
actually taken by the “subscribers” (i.e., the green area marked
with “Sub”), which account for about 66% in the total trips,
while those finished by the “customers” (i.e., the gray area)
account for 34% in all.

No extra information is available for the “customers”, as
they just buy one-day pass and no personal information
is recorded. Meanwhile, for the “subscribers” with formal
membership registrations, we can know more (e.g., gender and
age) about them and can further study their compositions.

As shown in Figure 1, the “subscribers” area is further
divided into the “male” and “female” subscribers. Among all

these Divvy bike trips, “male subscribers” (i.e., the blue area)
finish about 50% of them, and “female subscribers” (i.e., the
red area) have taken 16% of the trips.

In addition, we also count the trips finished by people be-
longing to 3 different age groups, which include young people:
age<30; mid-aged people: 30≤age<50; and senior people:
age≥50, which are denoted by the red/blue color of different
saturations in Figure 1. From the result, we observe that among
the 50% bike trips finished by the “male subscribers”, the
ratio of trips taken by the young, mid-aged and senior people
account for 17%, 27% and 7% respectively. Meanwhile, the
trip finished by the female subscribers belonging to these 3
groups are 7%, 7%, and 2% respectively. Therefore, the Divvy
bike is preferred and frequently used by the young and mid-
aged people, who together finish about 58% of the total trip.

In summary, based on the analysis results, we can partition
the users into several categories (e.g., “customers” vs “sub-
scribers”, “male” vs “female”, young vs mid-aged vs senior).
In the following sections, we will study the temporal and
spatial travel patterns of different categories of users in detail.

IV. TEMPORAL TRAVEL PATTERNS

In this section, we will study individuals’ temporal travel
patterns with the Divvy bike. We will first study and analyze
the Divvy trip taken on each day in the 2014 year, from
which individuals’ cyclic travel patterns can be observed. For
different cycle lengths (one year, one week and one day), we
analyze the distribution of individuals’ bike usages in each
cycle. Finally, we also study the time durations of historical
bike trips in the dataset.

A. Trip Temporal Distribution Overview

The Divvy bicycle-sharing system provides bike sharing
services throughout the whole year. To have a look at the
bike usages within a year in the dataset, we count up the trip
records on each day in 2014 taken by “customers”, “male
subscribers” and “female subscribers” respectively, whose
results are available in Figure 2.

From Figure 2, we observe that people use the Divvy bike
everyday, but the majority of the trips concentrate within the

months ranging from April to November, and the number
of trips taken during the winter seasons is quite limited
(we will further study the monthly bike usages in 2014 in
Section IV-B). Such a phenomenon can be correlated to the
weather in Chicago and, to support such a statement, we
also check the historical weather within the Chicago area in
2014 from Weather Underground3. According to the historical
weather data in Chicago, the average temperatures during
January and February of 2014 were below 20◦F , and the
average temperature in November and December of 2014 were
below 40◦F respectively. Meanwhile, over 20 days snowed in
January 2014, and the numbers of snowing days during the
February, November and December were all larger than 10.
In this kind extreme weather conditions, travelling by bike
is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, as the weather gets better,
Divvy bike usage increases steadily.

Besides the weather reasons, some other factors can also
influence the Divvy bike usages, like various events celebrated
in Chicago. For instance, from Figure 2, we observe that
people’s bike riding activities reach the peak on July 19-20,
2014 (Saturday and Sunday) in Chicago. According to Chicago
event schedule4, at the same time, various events were taken
place at Chicago including the “Pitchfork Music Festival” (tens
of thousands of music fans are involved and gathered together),
“Taste of River North”, “Chicago Craft Beer festival”, etc. To
attend these celebration festivals, Divvy bikes with no worries
about the parking issues are the ideal travel options for people.
Viewed in this perspective, the Divvy bike riding activities are
also correlated with the offline events.

In addition, by investigating the bike sharing activity chang-
ing trends in Figure 2, we observe that their activity patterns
follow cyclical fluctuations. We will give the analysis about
people’s cyclical Divvy bike usages in the following section.

B. Cyclical Travel Patterns

In this part, we will analyze the cyclical fluctuations of
people’s bike usages in one year, one week and one day
respectively.

1) Cyclical Pattern in One Year: In Figure 3(a), we count
the trip numbers of each month in the 2014 year taken by
“customers”, “male subscribers”, and “female subscribers”
respectively, and the total number is also marked on top of
the bars. Similar to the observations discussed for Figure 2,

3http://www.wunderground.com
4http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/CHICAGO-EVENTS-

FESTIVALS-2014-CALENDAR-HIGHLIGHTS/1243/

most of the trips are done during April until October in the
year 2014, due to the weather reasons, like temperature and
snow precipitations.

In addition, we observe that the trips taken by the “cus-
tomers” mostly appear during April until October, and they
rarely use the Divvy bike during the winter and early spring
seasons. To support such a claim, we calculate the ratio of
trips taken by “customers” against the total number of trips in
each month of 2014. The ratio during January and February
of 2014 is below 5%, and around 10% in November and
December. However, the ratio increases rapidly to over 40%
during May to August (i.e., the summer season). Therefore,
the “customers” should be different from the regular long-term
“subscribers”, and they can be temporary visitors to Chicago.

2) Cyclical Pattern in Each Week: From Figure 2, we
observe the cyclical fluctuations in the bike usages and the
cycle length takes about 1

4
month, i.e., one week. In this part,

we will check whether there is cyclical pattern in each week
or not for both “customers” and “subscribers”.

In Figure 3(b), based on the whole dataset, we show the
number of trips finished by “customers”, “male” and “female”
subscribers respectively on each weekday from Sunday to Sat-
urday. Based on the results, we observe that “customer’s” bike
usage pattern is totally different from that of “subscribers”.
“Subscribers” mainly use the Divvy bike during the weekdays
from Monday to Friday, and their usages on weekends (i.e.,
Sunday and Saturday) drop a lot. For instance, the number
of trips taken by the “subscribers” on Tuesday is 473, 957
in all, but the number drops to 261, 321 on Sunday, which
decreases almost by 45%. However, the Divvy bike usages for
the “customers” follow a totally different pattern: “customers”
tend to use the Divvy bike more often on weekends than
weekdays. For instance, the number of trips taken on weekends
(Saturday and Sunday) by “customers” is 721, 073, which
account for 49% of their total trips.

3) Cyclical Pattern in Each Day: Besides the annual and
weekly patterns, we also wonder whether people’s bike usages
have daily cyclical patterns or not. In Figure 3(c), we divide
each day into 24 hours and count the trips taken at each hour,
where the trips time denotes their starting time.

From Figure 3(c), we can observe that most of the Divvy
trips are taken during the daytime from 6AM to 7PM for both
“customers” and “subscribers”. However, the activity patterns
for “customers” and “subscribers” are totally different: (1)
“subscribers” mostly ride the Divvy bike during 7AM-9AM
and 4PM-6PM; but (2) “customers” use the Divvy bike during

the daytime from 10AM-6PM. The peak Divvy usage hours
of “subscribers” happen to be most employees’ and students’
commute rush hours, and the “subscribers” mainly use Divvy
for (at least part of) their workplace-home commutes. Mean-
while, the peak Divvy usage hours of “customers” concentrate
round the daytime, especially the visitors’ sightseeing hours.

C. Trip Time Duration

In addition to the cyclical bike usage patterns, we are
also interested in the time durations of Divvy bike trips. To
study the bike usages in the real-world, we calculate the
average trip time duration in the whole dataset to be 17.76
minutes. To study the detailed distributions of trip time length,
in Figure 4, we partition the trip length into 6 bins: {<30
minutes, 30 minute-1 hour, 1 hour-2 hours, 2 hours-5 hours, 5
hours-10 hours, >10 hours} and count the number of trips
belonging each time bin. From Figure 4, we can observe
that the number of trips which are shorter than 30 minutes
ridden by “subscribers” and “customers” are 2, 784, 145 and
1, 128, 802, which together accounts for 90.77% of the total
bike trips. In other words, the majority of users will return the
bike within the free-ride time (i.e., 30 minutes) and don’t want
to pay the over-time charges. However, about 397, 714 bike
trips are still longer than 30 minutes, the majority of which are
taken by “customers”. The number of over-time trips ridden
by “customers” is 345, 446, and accounts for 86.85% of the
total over-time trips.

V. SPATIAL TRAVEL PATTERNS

In this section, we will study the individuals’ spatial travel
patterns. We will first introduce the overall distributions of
Divvy bike stations in the Chicago city. Next, we will analyze
the geo-distances of trips taken by different categories of
people, and study the top 10 stations that individuals frequently
start and end their trips at, as well as the station pairs that
people usually travel between.

A. Station Spatial Distribution Overview

In Figure 5, we show the distribution of the Divvy stations
at the Chicago city, where the blue area and blue dots are the
existing service region and the existing Divvy station locations.
Due to the vast travel demands from the public, Divvy is
expanding its service region to broader areas by adding new
stations to both new and existing service regions, i.e., the red
area and the red dots. By comparing the number of stations in

& service area

the existing and planned service regions (i.e., the blue and red
areas), we observe the station distribution is denser in the blue
region, which also corresponds to the densely populated area at
the Chicago city. The most prosperous area at Chicago should
be the Loop area, which is also the region that the Divvy
bike was initially launched at. To have a clear view about the
stations available at the Loop area, in Figure 5, we also zoom
in the area (i.e., marked in the green dashed square), from
which we can observe divvy stations within the Loop region
is extremely dense and many new stations are to be added.

B. Trip Geo-graphical Distance

For bike trips taken by different categories of people among
the stations, their distances can vary a lot. In Figure 6, we show
the distributions about the distance (in kilometers (KM)) of
trips taken by “customers”, “male subscribers” and “female
subscribers” respectively. Here, Manhattan Distance [15] is
used as the distance measure, as the roads in Chicago are
very similar to those in Manhattan. We observe that the
distribution curves don’t follow the power law distribution
[2] exactly, where the majority of trips are within distance
about 0.5 − 5KM, while those shorter than 0.5KM or longer
than 5KM only account for a very small proportion. What’s
more, based on the historical trip data, we calculate the average
distance of trips ridden by “customers” and “subscribers” (both
male and female subscribed users) to be 2.12KM and 1.91KM
respectively. In other words, trips finished by the customers are
slightly longer.

C. Top 10 Trip Origin Stations

The trip origin stations that people frequently start their
trips from (i.e., the trip origin stations) can be quite different.
In Figure 7, we show the top 10 Divvy bike stations that

usually start their trip from, which include the ranked station
list with station IDs and station names. In addition, we also
give the number of trips starting from the stations (i.e., the
length of the bars), as well as their specific coordinates on
the map. Different categories of users can also have certain
overlaps in the trip start stations, and some of the overlapped
station markers are covered and not shown. For instance,
Station 174 serves as the top 3rd frequently visited station for
both male and female subscribers, but the icon corresponding
to the “female subscribers” is hidden by that of the “male
subscribers” on the map.

From the results, we observe that “male subscribers” mainly
use the Divvy bikes from the loop area; “female subscribers”
normally use the bike from the northern residential area; and
“customers” mostly use the bike for sightseeing at attraction
spots along the Lake Michigan coast. For instance, (1) the top
ranked site that “male subscribers” frequently borrow the bike
to start their trips is “Station 91”, and it is located close to
the loop area and is next to many sites of very large pop-
ulation flow, which include several important transportation
hubs in Chicago (i.e., Chicago Union Station and Ogilvie
Transportation Center), apartment buildings, as well as office
buildings. (2) The top ranked site that “female subscribers”
usually start their trips from is “Station 289”, and it is located
at the northern part of the Chicago city, which is a rich and
safe residential area in Chicago. And (3) the top ranked start
station for “customers” is “Station 35”, which is located near
the famous Chicago landmark “Navy Pier”, and their 2nd and
3rd top stations are located next to the “Millennium Park”,
which is also a famous tourist site in Chicago.

D. Top 10 Trip Destination Stations

Besides the start stations, we also show the top 10 stations
that people usually end their trips, i.e., the destinations of their
trips, and the results are shown in Figure 8.

From Figure 8, we observe that the top 10 frequently
visited stations of “male subscribers”, “female subscribers”
and “customers” are quite similar to those shown in Figure 7.
For instance, 7 of the top ranked end stations of “male
subscribers” and “female subscribers” have ever appeared
in the corresponding origin station ranking list, and the top
10 end stations of “customers” are even identical to their
origin stations as shown in Figure 7, but the trip numbers

(i.e., the bar width) are different. The potential explanation
for such a phenomenon can be that the bike trips for many
users are normally bi-directional. In other words, if they ride
from station A to station B for certain events (which can be
“go to workplaces” for subscribed users, or “sightseeing” for
customers), then they may also need to ride back after the
events. Therefore, station A and station B both serve as the
origin and destination stations respectively in these two trips.

E. Top 5 Frequently Traveled Station Pairs

Generally, different Divvy bike trips are for different pur-
poses, and the purpose can be captured more clearly by
considering the origin and destination stations at the same
time. For example, if the bike trip departs from residential
region and the destination is a campus, the rider is likely to
be a student and uses Divvy bike to commute from home
to schools; while if the trip origin and destination stations
are both attraction sites, then the rider mainly uses the Divvy
bike for sightseeing. Motivated by this, we show the top 5
frequently traveled station pairs of “male subscribers”, “female
subscribers” and “customers” in Figure 9, where the origin and
destination stations are listed and marked on the map.

From Figure 9, we observe that the top ranked Divvy
station pair for “male subscribers” is “Station 283 → Station
174”, where station 283 is at the Chicago loop region (i.e.,
the Chicago city center area full of office buildings) and
station 174 is just next to the “Ogilvie Transportation Center”.
Therefore, the divvy trip for male users from station 283 and
station 174 can be for catching up transportation vehicles from
their workplaces.

Meanwhile, the top ranked station pair for “female sub-
scribers” is “Station 284 → Station 255”, where station 284
is next to “The Art Institute of Chicago” and station 255 is next
to various spots, e.g., “The Field Museum”, “Chicago Shedd
Aquarium” and “Chicago Adler Planetarium”. In addition,
between station 284 and station 255, there exist an exercise
trail for jogging and bike-riding along the Lake Michigan
coast, and Chicago people like to go there for relax a lot.
Therefore, the divvy trip for female users from station 284
and station 255 can be for either museum visiting or personal
exercises.

Fig. 8. Top 10 trip destination stations.

For the “customers”, we observe that the top 5 Divvy trips
for them are actually among only 3 stations, which are “Station
35” (a station next to Chicago Navy Pier), “Station 76” (a
station next to Millennium Park) and “Station 85” (a station
next to the Oak Street Beach). Actually, these 3 stations are all
close to attraction spots and are very popular for tourists. In the
trip station pair list, we notice that customers will depart and
arrive at the same Divvy stations (e.g., Station 76 → Station
76, and Station 35 → Station 35), which means they borrow
the bike from a station to wander around the nearby places
and return the bike back to the same station. However, such
observations (i.e., borrowing and returning bikes at common
stations) are not common for the subscribed users.

VI. TRIP PREDICTION PROBLEM FORMULATION

Based on the above analysis, we will introduce the trip
prediction problem in this section. The trip prediction problem
studied in this paper aims at inferring the destination station
and trip end time, given that a user borrows a bike from a
Divvy station at certain time. We propose to formulate the
problem as an origin and destination station pair prediction
problem in this paper.

In other words, for a given user, who has borrowed a bike
from a known Divvy station A at time t, the trip prediction
problem aims at returning a set of potential destination Divvy
station candidates in the decreasing order of their likelihood
that u will ride the bike to as well as the trip duration τ . The
trip end time can be represented as t+τ . In the trip prediction
problem, we can represent trip origin and destination stations
as pairs (so, sd), where so denotes the origin station and sd
represents the trip destination station. Based on the existing
historical data, a set of features that depict either the user or
the characteristics of stations so, sd can be extracted, which
can be represented as vector x(so, sd) ∈ Rk of length k (the
features will be introduced in Section VII). Pair (so, sd) can be
labeled with relevance scores between the origin station so and
the potential destination station sd, which can be represented
as y(so, sd) (y(so, sd) = +1 if the trip ends at station sd and
0 otherwise). Meanwhile, the time duration of trip from so
and sd can be denoted as t(so, sd) ∈ R.

Formally, let T be the training set containing labeled station
pairs. We can represent the features and labels extracted

for pairs in T as D = {x(so, sd), y(so, sd), t(so, sd)}. The
trip prediction problem can be formalized as building two
functions f : Rk → {1, 0} and h : Rk → R, where
function f maps the station pair feature vector to their inferred
relevance score (i.e., the likelihood for the trip to finish at
the potential destination stations), while function h maps the
feature vector to the inferred trip duration time. These two
regression functions will be applied to the potential stations
in the test set and can return the predictive confidence scores
{y(so, sd)}(so,sd) and duration length {t(so, sd)}(so,sd) for
station pairs in the test set.

VII. TRIP PREDICTION MODEL

To address the trip prediction problem, in this part, we
will introduce the prediction model in detail. First, we will
introduce the features extracted for station pairs based on
information about users, start time and stations. Next, we will
briefly talk about the specific models used in this paper.

A. Features about the user

Throughout the previous data analysis sections, the type
of users (i.e., “customer” vs “male subscriber” vs “female
subscriber”) have significant influences on the bike trips in
both destination stations and trip duration. As a result, based
on the user personal information, we propose to extract 3
features about the users, which include
• User Type: “Customers” normally behave very differently

from the “subscribers” in Divvy bike usage (see Figures
in Section IV and V). To differentiate them from each
other, based on the user type information, we propose to
extract feature x1. If user u is a subscribed user, then
x1 = +1; otherwise, x1 = −1.

• User Gender: “Male” uses Divvy bike more often and
their activity region concentrates around the Chicago loop
area, which is different from the “female” users (see
Figures 7, 8 and 9). To denote the gender about the
subscribed users, we define feature x2, where x2 = +1
for “male subscribers” and x2 = −1 for “female sub-
scribers”. For “customers”, we have no idea about their
gender and we will assign x2 = 0.

• User Age: In addition, the birth year information is
available for subscribers. Young people and mid-aged



people tend to use Divvy bike more often (see Figure 1).
We propose to extract feature x3 to represent the user
age. For “customers”, we set x3 = 0, as we don’t know
their ages.

B. Features about the departure time

Besides the users information, the Divvy bike usage is also
correlated with the trip start time a lot. For instance, people use
Divvy bike more often in the summer; “customers” tend to use
Divvy bike at weekends; “subscribers” mainly use the Divvy
bike during the rush hours. Therefore, 3 different features are
extracted based on the trip start time:
• Month of the trip time: Winter and early spring in Chicago

are not suitable for bike riding (see Figure 3(a)). To
denote the month of the trip start time, we define feature
x4 in the paper, where x4 = 1 if the trip is at January,
x4 = 2 if it is at February, and so forth.

• Weekday of the trip time: For subscribed users and
customers, they have totally different bike usage patterns
on different weekdays (see Figure 3(b)). To utilize this
information, a new feature x5 is introduced. We set
x5 = 0 if the trip starts on Sunday, and set x5 = 1
for Monday, and so forth.

• Hour of the trip time: Another time-related feature ex-
tracted is the specific hour of the start time, as the
start hour can show the purpose of the trip a lot (see
Figure 3(c)). For simplicity, we divide each day into
24 hours and define another feature x6 to represent the
specific trip start hour, where x6 = 0 if it starts within
[12AM, 1AM); x6 = 1 if at [1AM, 2AM); and so forth.

These 3 extracted features show the information about trip
start time in 3 different cyclic patterns.

C. Features about the stations

In Figure 9, we have shown the some top frequently com-
muted station pairs by different categories of users. Therefore,
the trip origin station can provide important information to
help us infer the destination station as well. Three different
features about the stations are extracted in the experiments:
• Station Pairs: In Figure 9, we show that some station pairs

can be frequently traveled by the users. The first station
features extracted for (so, sd) is the station ID pairs, i.e.,
x7 = ID((so), ID(sd)).

• Station geographic information: Besides the ID infor-
mation, we also have the geographic information about
the stations, which can be represented as the (lati-
tude, longitude) pairs. The coordinate pairs are also
used as a feature, which can be represented as x8 =
latitude(so), longitude(so), latitude(sd), longitude(sd).

• Geographic Distance: The majority of Divvy bike trips
are of length 0.5− 5KM (see Figure 6) and trips that are
too short (around 0KM) or too long (longer than 10KM)
are very rare. We propose to extract feature x9 to de-
note geographic distance between stations (so, sd), where
Manhattan Distance is used as the distance measure.

Based on the above extracted features, we can represent the
feature vector for certain station pairs (so, sd) as x(so, sd) =
[x1, x2, · · · , x9] of length 13 in total (as x7 and x8 are of
lengths 2 and 4 respectively), which together with the label
y(so, sd) and time t(so, sd) can be used to build the confidence
score and trip duration prediction models.

D. Trip Destination Station Inference Model

For the trip destination station prediction problem, we
propose to map it to a binary classification in the experiments.
For each trip origin and destination station pairs (e.g., (so, sd)),
we assign it with different labels {1, 0} to denote whether a
certain trip starting at so will end at sd or not. To address
the problem, we propose to apply a state-of-the-art pairwise
based regression algorithm, namely MART (Multiple Additive
Regression Trees) [16], to develop a regression function.
MART is based on the stochastic gradient boosting approach
described in [5], [6] which performs gradient descent optimiza-
tion in the functional space. In our experiments, we used the
log-likelihood as the loss function, steepest-descent (gradient
descent) as the optimization technique, and binary decision
trees as the fitting function. For more information about the
MART model, please refer to [5], [6], [13].

E. Trip Duration Inference Model

To predict the time length of the trip, the same set of features
are applied to build the trip duration inference model. Different
regression models can be used as the base prediction model,
and, without a loss of generality, we will apply the Lasso
regression model as the base regression model in this paper,
which fits a linear equation t̂(so, sd) =

∑k
i=1 bixi+b0, where

t̂(so, sd) is the inferred trip length between stations so and sd,
term bi denotes the coefficient of feature xi and b0 represents
the bias term.

To get the coefficient values in training the model, Lasso
uses the L1 prior as the regularizer, and the optimal coeffi-
cients can be learned by solving the following equation

argmin
b

∑
(so,sd)

(t̂(so, sd)− t(so, sd))2 + α |b|1 ,

where t(so, sd) is the real duration of the trip between so and
sd and α is the weight of the regularizer term.

VIII. EXPERIMENTS

To test the effectiveness of these two models in addressing
the trip prediction problem, we conduct experiments on the
real-world bicycle-sharing system Divvy (introduced in Sec-
tion II). In this section, we will first introduce the experiment
settings, which include the experiment setups, comparison
methods and evaluation metrics. Next, we will show the
experiment results and give detailed analysis.

A. Experiment Settings

tuples (user, origin station, destination station, departure time)
as the existing trip set, where each tuple contains the complete

information about the trip. In the trip destination station
prediction problem, the existing trip set is used as the positive
set (i.e., assigned with labels 1), and a equal-sized negative
trip tuple set is random generated, instances in which are
assigned with labels 0. In the negative tuple set, (1) users
can be “customers” and “subscribers” of equal chance, and
the gender of “subscribers” is randomly assigned with either
“male” and “female”, whose ages are random selected from
{1, 2, · · · , 100}; (2) the origin and destination are randomly
selected from the whole station set; and (3) the negative trip
departure time is random selected from July 1st, 2013 to June
30th, 2015. Both positive and negative trip sets are divided
into two parts according to ratio 4 : 1 based on the time order,
where 4 folds are used as the training set and 1 fold is used as
the test set. A set of features are extracted for each instance
in the training and test sets. We train the trip end prediction
model MART with the training set, which will be applied to
the test set to infer the labels of the test pairs.

Meanwhile, in the trip duration inference problem, similarly,
we divide the existing trip set into two parts according to ratio
4 : 1 based on the time order, where 4 folds are used as the
training set and 1 fold is used as the test set. However, the
setting of trip duration inference is slightly different: (1) no
negative trip set is needed; and (2) the instances in the training
and test set are assigned with their real-trip duration as their
labels. The same set of features are extracted to build the trip
duration inference model (i.e., Lasso) based on the training
set, which will be applied to infer the trip time duration of
instances in the test set.

2) Comparison Methods: The comparison methods used in
trip destination and duration inference can be divided into two
categories depending on the information used:
Models using all information
• ALL: Method ALL builds the trip end prediction and trip

duration inference models with all the three categories of
features extracted, which include user, station and time
based features.

Models using partial information
• USER: Method USER builds the trip end prediction and

trip duration inference models with the features about
users only.

• STATION: Method STATION builds the trip end prediction
and trip duration inference models with the features about
stations only.

• TIME: Method TIME only uses the features about the
time only to build the trip end prediction and trip duration
inference models.

3) Evaluation Metrics: To evaluate the performance of
these different methods in addressing the trip prediction prob-
lem, we apply different evaluation metrics to measure their
prediction results.

We formulate the trip end prediction problem as a binary
classification problem, and all these 4 comparison methods
can output the predicted labels of trip pairs in the test set. By
comparing them with the ground-truth labels, we can evaluate
their performance with 4 frequently used metrics: Accuracy,
Precision, Recall and F1-score.

We formulate the trip duration inference problem as a re-
gression problem, and the comparison methods will output the
inferred the time duration of trips in the test set. Meanwhile,
we also have the real-world trip duration from the dataset,
i.e., the ground-truth. Different metrics used for regression
problems can be applied here, and we use the MAE (Mean
Absolute Error) and R2 (i.e., Coefficient of Determination) as
the evaluation metrics.

B. Experiment Results

The experiment results are available in Figure 10 and
Figure 11. Figure 10 show the results of trip end prediction
and Figure 11 gives the results of trip duration inference.

By comparing ALL with the other methods in Figure 10, we
can observe that ALL can outperform other methods with sig-
nificant advantages consistently evaluated by different metrics.
For instance, in Figure 10(a), the Accuracy achieved by ALL is
0.87 which is about 21% higher than the Accuracy gained by
USER (i.e., 0.72); 4% higher than the Accuracy score achieved
by STATION (i.e., 0.84); and 43% larger than the Accuracy
score obtained by TIME (i.e., 0.61). Similar results can be
observed in Figures 10(b)-10(d), where Precision, Recall and
F1 are used as the evaluation metrics.

Generally, among the comparison methods, ALL utilizing
all these 3 categories of features perform the best. Among the
3 methods using one category of feature only, STATION can
outperform USER, while USER performs better than TIME.
It is also easy to understand, as the task is to infer the trip



destination station, historical trip station pair information can
only provide more direct information for addressing the task.
Meanwhile, the features about users and trip start time can
provide the indirect hints, as they are about the bike user and
time, not directly about the stations.

In Figure 11(a)-11(b), we show the results about trip dura-
tion inference problem, which are evaluated by both MAE and
R2 metrics. Compared with other comparison methods, ALL
achieves better performance with the much smaller MAE and
larger R2 score. For example, the MAE introduced by ALL
is 7.39 (minute), which is 22.23% lower that the MAE intro-
duced by USER, 10.64% smaller than the MAE introduced
by STATION and 28% lower than the MAE introduced by
TIME. For the R2 metric, the R2 score achieved by ALL is
0.059, which is nearly the double of the R2 scores gained by
USER and STATION. The advantages of ALL against TIME is
more obvious: the MAE of ALL accounts for only 72% of
that achieved by TIME; and the R2 score obtained by ALL is
as large as the 30 times of the R2 achieved by TIME.

Therefore, by utilizing the complete information available
about the trips, ALL can outperform other comparison methods
with significant advantages in both predicting the trip destina-
tion stations and inferring the trip duration time.

IX. RELATED WORK

Bicycle-sharing has received increasing attention in recent
years with initiatives to increase cycle usage improve the first
mile/last mile connection to other modes of transit, and lessen
the environmental impacts of our transport activities. DeMaio
gives a complete introduction about the history, impacts, mod-
els of provision, and future of bicycle-sharing systems in [3].
Midgley provides a complete overview work about the bicycle-
sharing schemes, management, policies, and challenges as well
as opportunities in [10]. A large number of other review and
case-study works on bicycle-sharing systems have appeared so
far [9], [17], [14], [4], which study the bicycle-sharing systems
from different aspects and directions.

Recently, urban computing has become a hot research area
and lots of works have been done by Zheng et al. already [18],
[11], [7]. The bicycle-sharing systems are an important part
in urban computing. Many research works have been done on
bicycle-sharing systems and other transportation systems to
study the system design problem [8], load balance problem
[12], and bicycle traffic prediction problem [7]. Lin et al.
[8] introduce a strategic design problem for bicycle sharing
systems incorporating bicycle stock considerations, which is
formulated as a hub location inventory model. The problem
studied in [8] covers the design work about various aspects
of the bicycle-sharing system, e.g., the number and locations
of bicycle stations, the creation of bicycle lanes, the selection
of paths, etc. Pavone et al. develop methods for maximizing
the throughput of a mobility-on-demand urban transportation
system and introduce a rebalancing policy that minimizes the
number of vehicles performing rebalancing trips [12]. The
optimal rebalancing policy can be found as the solution to
a linear program effectively in the proposed model. Li et al.

propose a hierarchical prediction model to predict the number
of bikes that will be rent from/returned in a future period
for bicycle-sharing systems [7], which focus more on the
macroscopic bike traffic flow in the bicycle-sharing system and
is different from the microscopic trip destination and duration
prediction problem of a specific trip studied in this paper.

X. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have studied the trip prediction problem for
bicycle-sharing systems to infer the potential trip destination
station and trip duration. Extensive analysis about the user
composition of a real-world bicycle-sharing system, individ-
uals’ temporal bike usage behavior patterns and spatial bike
usage behavior patterns have been done. Based on the analysis
results, two new regression based inference models have been
introduced in this paper to predict the potential trip destination
station and trip duration respectively. Experiments conducted
on the real-world bicycle-sharing system dataset demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed model.
