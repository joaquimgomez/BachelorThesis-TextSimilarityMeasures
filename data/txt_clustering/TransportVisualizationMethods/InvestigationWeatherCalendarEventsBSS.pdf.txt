Public bicycle systems are widely spread across many cities worldwide. ‘Tashu’, a public bicycle sharing system
in Daejeon, was installed in 2009 and it is one of the well-established public bike-sharing systems in South Korea.
Previous studies in the literature found that in general, bicycling is affected by weather conditions and temporal
characteristics. However, the degrees of impacts or the signs of effects may be different depending on the sta-
tions. Therefore, this study investigated the different effects of weather conditions and temporal characteristics
according to the characteristics of the stations at the station level analysis in addition to the system level ana-
lysis. For the cost-effective station level analysis, clustering analysis was utilized to find out the groups of the
stations with the similar properties. Moreover, temperature humidity index (THI) and the indicator variable of
heatwaves were introduced to consider the interaction between temperature and humidity and measure the
influence of high temperature, which has been rarely considered. In the system level analysis, the results showed
that the selected factors have the different influence over the different time periods within a day. Especially,
scorching heat and non-working days differently affect the demand for public bikes by hours. Also, it was
observed that high temperature over 30 °C reduces the bicycle usage, which revealed the necessity of taking into
account not only severe colds but also heatwaves in the prediction of the demand. By clustering analysis, the
stations were partitioned into the three clusters. One cluster shows the strong peak in the morning while two
others have peaks in the evening. The effects of weather conditions and non-working days on the demand for
public bicycles were different depending on the clusters, which seemed to be related to the main purposes of bike
usage in the clusters.

1. Introduction

A public bicycle system, also called as a bike-sharing system is a
service in which bicycles are made available for shared use. It allows
people to borrow a bike from one of the stations belonging to the
system and return it at another station of the sharing system. The public
bicycle system began in Amsterdam in 1965 (Shaheen et al., 2010), but
the expansion of the system to the world was due to the development of
IT technology in the 2000s. The development of technology has made it
easier and more convenient for people to rent a bike, and mobile IT
devices have allowed people to find a nearby station where they can
rent a bike. In 2014, public bike-sharing systems were distributed over
50 countries on five continents and included 712 cities (Shaheen et al.,
2014; Ahillen et al., 2016).

Such a bike-sharing system provides an affordable alternative to
motorized public transport and private vehicles for short-distance trips
in an urban area and aims to reduce noise and air pollution. In addition
to this, it was reported that transit use increases in cities with bike-

sharing due to improved connectivity to other means of transit
(DeMaio, 2009). However, the bike-sharing system has been criticized
as less convenient than a privately owned bicycle and as relatively in-
efficient and high cost in relation to its effectiveness. Therefore, to
ensure the success of a bike-sharing system, it is necessary to select
appropriate areas for the stations and predict the demand according to
different situations.

Current bike-sharing systems are supported by information systems
that automatically collect records related to renting and returning of
bikes, and this information provides useful data for the bike-sharing
system. Utilizing this information not only predicts the long-term demand
at a station, it can also determine the relationship between the local
characteristics and external factors and the demand. Therefore, analyzing
the rich data of the detailed trip records of the system can be used to
successfully manage the bike-sharing system. In addition, this information
can be used to understand the human mobility patterns that are influ-
enced by bicycle use in urban areas, which may show characteristics that
differ from the mobility patterns by other modes of transit.

In recent years, research utilizing such data has been actively con-
ducted. Several studies investigated the spatio-temporal variations in
demand across a system to predict the demand at the system level or
station level. Those studies provided ways for optimizing the location of
stations and the inventory management or found the factors that af-
fected the demand for public bicycles. The different works used dif-
ferent approaches or models and different explanatory variables to es-
timate the demand for public bicycles. In Kaltenbrunner et al. (2010),
prediction of the total number of available bicycles or free slots in the
stations was conducted using an Auto-Regressive Moving Average
(ARMA) model for the community bicycle program, Bicing in Barce-
lona. Since ARMA is a tool to understand a stationary stochastic process
in the analysis of time series, this work only utilized the data which
consists of the total amount of bicycles available at the stations mea-
sured at the same time interval in modeling for prediction. Unlike this
work, many other studies usually used additional explanatory variables
in prediction. García-Palomares et al. (2012) built the models to predict
the potential demand for sharing bicycle as the first step for optimizing
the location of stations of the bike-sharing program in Madrid. The
spatial distribution of the demand was estimated using the population
and employment. Corcoran et al. (2014) studied the effect of weather
and calendar events on the total number of trips by all stations of Ci-
tyCycle in Brisbane using a Poisson regression model. However, this
work did not provide the statistical models in sub-system level or sta-
tion level. Instead, the spatio-temporal dynamics of public bicycle trips
in sub-system level were visualized by flow-comaps. Rixey (2013) in-
vestigated the effect of demographic and built environment on average
monthly bicycle usage of the three cities in USA using linear regression.
As similar to Rixey (2013), Faghih-Imani et al. (2014) investigated the
effect of land use and urban form on arrival and departure rates at the
stations of BIXI in Montreal by regression analysis, but it used a linear
mixed model instead of a simple linear regression model to consider
station specific effects.

The several kinds of literature used various information, including
the geographical characteristics of stations, such as land use, built en-
vironment, and accessibility, or external conditions such as weather and
calendar events, to explain the public bike ridership in detail. However,
it is not easy to find out research that considered the possibility that the
selected factors are differently related to the pattern of public bicycle
usage. In many cases, the models were trained using the local char-
acteristics of stations as station specific explanatory variables and the
coefficients of the factors were estimated as they have the same influ-
ence on the demand regardless of stations. Therefore, these models
could not reflect the interaction between the characteristics of stations
and other factors.

To address this issue, this study used clustering analysis to group the
stations into homogeneous subsets, because building a separate model
for each station is costly and not efficient although the separate models
can measure the different effects of explanatory variables depending on
stations. On the other hand, learning a separate model for each cluster
is much efficient and it is possible to identify the relationships between
the common characteristics within clusters that help to understand
human mobility by bicycles and other explanatory variables on the
demand for public bicycles.

In this study, I investigated the effects of external factors such as
weather and non-working days on public bike ridership as similar to the
literature, using the bicycle usage data obtained from the bike-sharing
system called ‘Tashu’ operated in Daejeon, South Korea. This study
estimated the separate negative binomial models for the detected
groups of the stations by clustering analysis as well, in addition to the
system level models. The temporal patterns of people renting public
bicycles were used to measure the similarity between the stations with
reference to other literature which found that the temporal variations in
human mobility are generally associated with the geographical char-
acteristics of regions (Handy, 1996; Dieleman et al., 2002; Pan et al.,
2013; Zhang et al., 2014). The bicycle flows between the detected

clusters are utilized in order to characterize the clusters and derive
plausible interpretations of the estimated models. Additionally, I in-
troduced new variables, temperature humidity index (THI) and the
indicator variable whether the highest temperate exceeds a certain
point or not. The first variable is introduced to deal with the interaction
between temperature and humidity. The second variable is generated to
reflect the phenomenon that outdoor activities are limited in the hot
summer, while other studies have shown that the demand for public
bicycles increases as temperature increases.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces
the study area, Daejeon and explains the datasets in detail. Afterwards,
the methodology used for the analysis in different levels was described
in Section 3. Then, Section 4 provides the results of the system and
station level analysis. Finally, the conclusions of the article is presented
in Section 5.

2. Case study region and datasets

This section first describes Daejeon, the study area, and then in-
troduces the datasets used in this study. The aim of the study was to
reveal the relations between weather and calendar events on the bicycle
ridership at the system and station levels. I conducted an exploratory
data analysis and then completed the appropriate preprocessing steps
needed to build the models necessary for the aim.

2.1. Geographical area covered by the study

Daejeon is the fifth largest city in South Korea and located in the
central region of South Korea. Due to the characteristics of this location,
Daejeon serves as a hub of transportation. The area of Daejeon is
539.97 km2 and the population was approximately 1.5 million in
2015.1

Daejeon maintains policy efforts to promote the low carbon growth.
As part of that effort, Daejeon has been pursuing several policies to
expand bicycle use in order to save energy, eliminate traffic congestion,
improve the environment and promote citizen's health. The policies to
expand bicycle use include a public bike-sharing system and provisions
to create and maintain bicycle paths and bicycle facilities as well as to
create incentives for transferring public transportation to bicycles. As of
2014, the total length of bicycle paths in Daejeon was 107.6 km and the
length of the shared roads by pedestrians and bicycle riders was
627.8 km.2 Moreover, a public bike-sharing system was introduced in
2009 as a pilot project and after the pilot project, the system has been
extended to other areas besides the pilot project area. In addition to the
bicycle infrastructure, Daejeon has a nationwide high rate of bicycle
use. As a result of the survey on the use of bicycles by the Korea
Transport Institute in 2016, Daejeon had the highest proportion of
people riding a bike more than once a week (36%) in South Korea.3

2.2. Datasets

2.2.1. Tashu trip data
Tashu is the self-service public bike share system in Daejeon.4 It was

launched in 2009. As of May 2017, the system had 226 stations and
2955 racks throughout Daejeon. Bike rental is possible for both mem-
bers and non-members. When registering as a member on the website,
users can pay a flat fee for a week, a month, or a year, or purchase a
one-day pass when they want to take a bicycle. For non-members, the
one-day pass can be purchased after a confirmation process using a

mobile phone. The price of a one-day pass is 500 won for both members
and non-members, whereas 7-day, 1-month and 1-year cannot be pur-
chased without a membership registration, and the prices are 2000,
5000 and 30,000 won, respectively. With a purchase of any pass, bike
rental is free for the first 1 h of every individual trip and an unlimited
number of such free trips can be made within the specified time period
for each pass. After 1 h, an additional charge of 500 won per 30 min is
incurred up to 3 h. If a trip lasts over 3 h, the charge is 1000 won for
each subsequent 30-minute period.

Though the Tashu service started in 2009, Tashu trip data are open
for three years from 2013 to 2015. In this study, the trip records in 2015
were used. The selected dataset contains a total of 959,824 trips. Each
trip record consists of the date, time and station ID of the bicycle rental
and return. The bicycle stations have continued to grow and there was a
total of 202 stations by the end of 2015. Of the 202 stations, 53 stations
were built in 2015. Therefore, the records from the 53 stations built in
2015 were excluded from the analysis, and then finally 874,315 trip
records were selected for the analysis. The locations of the stations are
depicted in Fig. 1 with land use of the urban area in Daejeon.5 As ob-
served in Fig. 1, the stations are mostly located in the urban area of
Daejeon.

Fig. 2 shows the average daily bicycle rental count on weekly basis
and Fig. 3 describes the hourly bike rental over 149 stations by week-
days and weekends. From spring to autumn except for the middle of
summer, the number of bicycle rentals was high and it was low in
winter. The hourly bike rental patterns show different characteristics
depending on whether it is a weekday or a weekend. The peaks

appeared between 8 am and 9 am, but not on weekends. These peaks
can be attributed to bicycle rentals for commuting because the location
of the peak coincides with normal commute times in the morning.
However, the peak observed at 6 pm were observed on both weekdays
and weekends. Overall, bicycle rentals were more frequent in the eve-
ning than in the morning or afternoon. Such usage pattern was also
observed in the public bike-sharing system in Moreal Faghih-Imani
et al. (2014) and Faghih-Imani et al. (2014) explained that the lower
usage of bicycles in the morning might be because employers might not
be in as much of a rush as when going to work in the morning. In
Section 4, the plausible explanation was examined in the case of Dae-
jeon.

development district in Daejeon and is governed by Daedeok Science Town Special Zone
Act. In this district, areas for educational and research facilities are categorized as green
urban areas, so these areas as well as other universities in Daejeon are differently colored
based on Daedeok Science Town Special Zone Act to clarify the real land use.

2.2.2. Holiday data
A database of all public holidays during the study period was col-

lected to identify the non-working days in 2015. I expected that the
patterns of people riding bikes would be different on weekdays and
weekends because the patterns of daily life are usually different on
weekdays and weekends. To distinguish between regular non-working
days (weekends) and occasional holidays, weekends and public holi-
days are represented as different variables. ‘Weekend’ and ‘Public
holiday’ variables are binary variables that indicate weekends and
public holidays, respectively.

2.2.3. Weather data
The National Climate Data Service System (NCDSS) provides sta-

tistical data on past weather observation factors such as temperature
and humidity.6 The statistics are provided at various time intervals
from 1 h to a year. In this study, data were collected at one-hour in-
tervals. The collected factors were temperature, humidity, wind speed,
and precipitation. Since the NCDSS provides only one observation value
for Daejeon, all stations shared the same weather conditions.

Fig. 4 shows the daily weather variations for temperature, relative
humidity, precipitation and wind speed and the daily bike rental
counts. Comparing two figures in Fig. 4, the trend in temperature is
quite similar to the daily bicycle rentals except during the middle of
summer. The daily total number of bike rentals generally increases as
the average temperature rises. However, if a heat wave continues, a
warning or alert is issued to refrain from outdoor activities, which
might cause a reduction in bike rentals.

To reflect the observation that the number of bicycle rentals drops
in the middle of summer, an additional dummy variable that indicated
scorching heat in the summer was created. The Korea Meteorological
Agency issues the heatwave warning when the maximum daytime
temperature exceeds 33 °C for two days. However, even if the warning
is not issued, outdoor activities may be reduced when the temperature
is relatively high. As referring many news articles, it is usually con-
sidered to be hot in South Korea if the maximum daytime temperature
exceeds 30 °C. In order to determine the reference point for enhancing
the performance of the predictive models, several prediction models
were trained by changing the reference temperatures around 30 °C, and
the likelihood of the model was the highest when the reference tem-
perature was set to the value between 29 and 30 °C. Therefore, the
dummy variable was generated based on 30 °C. There were 49 days of
the highest temperature above 30 °C in 2015.

Moreover, since temperature and humidity do not independently
affect people's activities, the temperature humidity index (THI) was
considered as one of the explanatory variables, which takes into ac-
count the interaction between temperature and relative humidity. The
THI accounts for the combined effects of environmental temperature
and relative humidity, and it was used to assess the risk of heat stress as
the discomfort index. The THI is defined as follows (Thom, 1959):

= − − ⎛
⎝

− ⎞
⎠

+THI T RH T
9
5

0.55(1 )
9
5

26 32
(1)

where T represents temperature (°C) and RH represents relative hu-
midity (%). When the THI exceeds 80, most people feel discomfort and
a THI of less than 70 implies no discomfort. To reflect the relationship
between the THI and discomfort, the THI was transformed by the logit
function defined in the following way:

=
+ − −

f x
x

( )
1

1 exp{ 0.8( 75)} (2)

Through the transformation, the final THI is scaled within the range
of [0,1] and it has very low values when the THI is less than 70 and it
approaches 1 when the THI is over 80.

In addition, the unit of relative humidity was converted from % to
the ratio and the unit of precipitation was changed to cm instead of mm
to adjust the range of all variables to some extent. After the conversion,
the daily weather variations were calculated from the meteorological
observations at one-hour intervals. For the temperature, relative hu-
midity, wind speed and THI, the mean values were used and the total
sum of precipitation was used as the representative values of the days.

Table 1 shows the summary statistics of weather-related variables.

2.3. Additional data

In this study, weather conditions and the non-working days were
mainly considered to predict the number of bicycle rentals in the Tashu
system. However, for the detailed analysis, additional datasets related
to Daejeon and Tashu data were also collected.

First of all, Tashu data only provides locations of the stations, but
the distances between stations are unknown. Of course, the inter-station
distance can be calculated directly from locations, but Euclidean dis-
tance is not the actual travel distance between two stations. Hence, the
actual distances between the stations collected from Naver Map's di-
rections by a bike.7 To check the relevance of the distances provided by

Naver Map, a correlation coefficient was calculated. The correlation
coefficient between the usage time (time difference between a rental
and return) and the Euclidean distances was 0.27 and the correlation
coefficient between the usage time and the distances from Naver Map
was 0.54.8 From the correlation coefficients, I decided to use the dis-
tances from Naver Map for further analysis.

Secondly, datasets about land use and housing complexes in
Daejeon were collected to determine geographical characteristics near
the stations. Since all the stations considered in this study except for
some stations in Daedeok Innopolis, are located in urban areas of
Daejeon, four different land uses such as residential, commercial, in-
dustrial, and green areas were gathered from Korea National Spatial

Data Infrastructure Portal.9 The list of housing complexes in Daejeon
containing the name, address, and the maximum number of households
was provided by Daejeon Metropolitan Government.

3. Method

3.1. Modeling for the demand for public bicycles

For the system level analysis, I examined the effects of weather
conditions and non-working days on bicycle rentals regardless of the
geographic features of the stations. Since popular times of bicycling
depend on the purpose of riding a bike, I considered the effects of
weather and non-working days on the total rentals per day as well as
the hourly number of rentals.

Since the target variable, the number of bicycle rentals, is count
data, one possible approach to model a dependent variable as count
data utilizes the assumption that the target follows the Poisson dis-
tribution. However, one of the key features of the Poisson distribution is
that the variance of the distribution equals the mean
( = =var X X μ[ ] [ ] ) (Cameron and Trivedi, 2013). When the means
and variances of the overall frequencies of bicycle rentals during a day
and the hourly number of bicycle rentals were calculated, the ratios of
the variance over the mean were greater than 5 for all cases, which
indicates over-dispersion.

The alternative approach to handle the count data with over-dis-
persion is to use negative binomial regression instead of Poisson re-
gression (Fox, 2015). The negative binomial regression is based on the
Poisson regression model and adds a multiplicative random effect to
represent unobserved heterogeneity. It supposes that the expected
count is an observable random variable that is gamma-distributed with
parameters α and β. In this setting, the distribution of the target follows
the negative binomial distribution as follows:

= =
+

+ +
P Y y

y α
y α

β μ
μ β

( )
Γ( )

!Γ( ) ( )

α y

α y (3)

The gamma distribution has the mean α/β and variance α/β2 and α
and β are generally regarded as the same value, 1/σ2 in the negative
binomial model, which makes the mean of the unobserved effect 1 and
its variance σ2. With α=β=1/σ2, the negative binomial distribution
has mean

=Y μ[ ] (4)

and variance

= +var Y μ σ μ[ ] (1 )2 (5)

As the same as the Poisson regression model, the mean of each
outcome, μ is given by

= = + ⋅βY μ cx xlog ( [ | ]) (6)

3.2. Clustering of the stations

As described in Section 1, in order to examine whether the effects of
weather and non-working days on bicycle rentals depends on the sta-
tions, the station level analysis was conducted. To reduce the cost of
learning multiple models for individual stations, the stations were first
partitioned into subsets by clustering.

For clustering, it is necessary to decide which criterion should be
used to group the similar stations. In previous research that analyzed
datasets related to several means of transit, the diurnal patterns of
transit ridership or the diurnal patterns of both pick-ups and drop-offs
have been utilized to obtain the representative features for stations or
locations (Chen et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; Deng and Xu, 2015; Liu
et al., 2015). Since return of public bikes is not always done at the end
of riding, this study only considered the number of bike rentals by hours
instead of the diurnal patterns of rental and return of bicycles at the
stations. On the other hand, each station was represented by a vector
consisting of 24 elements whose values corresponded to the hourly
frequencies of bike rentals.

To cluster the stations with the similar characteristics, hierarchical
clustering was used. Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering
algorithms which builds a hierarchy of clusters, and it is deterministic
unlike k-means clustering, which is one of the widely used clustering
algorithms (Rokach and Maimon, 2005; Aggarwal and Reddy, 2013).
After determining the hierarchy of clusters, any number of clusters can
be obtained.

As with other clustering algorithms, it is important for hierarchical
clustering to define how the similarity between two stations is calcu-
lated and how the similarity between two clusters should be also de-
fined for hierarchical clustering. When Euclidean distance is used to
measure the dissimilarity between two stations, it considers the overall
difference between two time series at each time period, so a large dif-
ference at a certain time period increases the distance between two
stations. To measure the similarity between two stations to reflect the
positions of peaks or the shape of representative vectors, Pearson's
correlation coefficient between two vectors was used as a similarity
measure, as done by Rodrigues et al. (2008). In order to convert the
correlation coefficient as dissimilarity measure, the calculated correla-
tion coefficient is subtracted from 1.

To determine the appropriate number of clusters, the different

number of clusters, k from 2 to 20 were tested and the results of clus-
tering were evaluated using a silhouette coefficient (Rousseeuw, 1987).
The silhouette coefficient is the proximity of the quality of clustering
considering both tightness within cluster and separation between
clusters. A silhouette coefficient for a sing object s(i) in the cluster A is
defined as follows,

=
−

s i
b i a i

a i b i
( )

( ) ( )
max { ( ), ( )} (7)

where a(i) is the average dissimilarity of i to all other objects in the
cluster, A and b(i) is defined as b(i)=minC≠Ad(i,C) where d(i,C) is the
average dissimilarity of i to all objects in a cluster, C. By definition, s(i)
is in the range of [−1,1] and the value close to 1 implies that the
sample, i, is ‘well-clustered’. The silhouette coefficient of clustering is
obtained by averaging s(i) for all samples. The final k was determined
by selection k achieving the highest silhouette coefficient.

4. Experiments and results

4.1. Results of system level analysis

First of all, the effect of weather and non-working days was ex-
amined by the negative binomial regression models at the system level.
Popular times of bicycle rentals may vary according to the purpose of
riding the bicycle, and the influence of weather and non-working days
on the number of bike rentals may also vary. Therefore, different ne-
gative binomial regression models by hours in a day were trained in
addition to the model for a whole day. The time periods during which
the Tashu system prohibits bike rentals were eliminated in the analysis.

Tables 2 and 3 show the coefficients of the learned models with the
number of samples, log-likelihood of the trained models, and Akaike
information criterion (AIC). Below the estimated coefficients, standard
errors of the coefficients are provided in parentheses. All time periods
are one-hour interval and denoted as the start time.

The number of training samples is not the same for every model
because there exist some days with no bike rental during the specific
time period, but the number of observations exceeds 350 for all time
periods except 1 am. The log likelihood of the model to estimate the
overall frequency of bicycle rentals is lower than all the other models
for the hourly frequency of bicycle rentals. Moreover, the models for
dawn and morning show higher log-likelihood than the models for
afternoon and night.

Overall, the temperature is positively correlated with the number of
trips and relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and THI are ne-
gatively correlated with the number of trips. This tendency appeared at
every hour. Higher temperatures generally lead to increase use of bi-
cycles, but the number of bike rentals usually decreases when the
highest temperature of a day is above 30 °C. The same tendency was
observed from 10 am to 9 pm except for 6 pm under significance level
of .1 and the negative correlation of the Scorching heat variable with
the target is significant at the .01 level from 1 pm to 5 pm, which in-
cludes the hottest time of a day. It might be because the average tem-
perature at dawn or early in the day is about 22 °C and the average
temperature at midnight is approximately 24 °C even if the highest
temperature of a day is above 30 °C, which is quite a good temperature
for bicycling. In addition, the time periods when the Scorching heat
variable is not relevant for estimating the target includes typical rush
hours.

Examining the variables related to indicators of non-working days,
whether it is a weekend or not is not a significant factor on the daily
number of bike rentals, but the number of bicycle rentals decreased on
the public holidays. This result is different from results reported in
previous research for other cities such as Montreal, Canada (Faghih-
Imani et al., 2014), and Brisbane, Australia (Corcoran et al., 2014). In
Brisbane, the bicycle usage increases on both weekends and public
holidays, while bicycle usage decreased during weekends in Montreal

and increased on Friday and Saturday nights. The Weekend variable is
not significant for the daily number of bicycle rentals in Daejeon be-
cause the effect of weekends is different depending on the time periods.
It was found that the number of bike rentals increased on weekends in
the afternoon, but the opposite trend was observed in the morning and
early evening. In addition, the variable to indicate weekends is not
significant from 8 pm to 11 pm. The times when the bicycle rentals
decreased on weekends were consistent with typical rush hours. From
this observation, it was inferred that the purpose of bicycle rental is
mainly commuting at around 8 am and 6 pm. On the other hand, except
typical rush hours, the purpose of bicycle rental seemed not to be
commuting since the number of bike rentals on weekends is higher than
weekdays or is not significantly changed from than on weekdays. In the
case of public holidays, although the daily number of bicycle rentals
decreased on the public holidays, there is no significant change in the
hourly demand for bikes on the public holidays except commuting time
periods.

4.2. Results of station level analysis

At the station level analysis, the aim of the analysis is to examine the
different effects of weather and non-working days according to the
characteristics of stations. To do this, first of all, 149 stations were
grouped into subsets using hierarchical clustering. To determine the
appropriate number of clusters, the different number of clusters, k from
2 to 20 were tested. The results of clustering were evaluated using the
silhouette coefficient. Fig. 5 shows the silhouette coefficients varying
with the number of clusters. As seen in the figure, the silhouette coef-
ficient is the highest when k is 3, which implies that the average intra-
cluster similarity is most larger than the average inter-cluster similarity
when the stations are partitioned into three clusters. As k increases, the
average intra-cluster similarity increases, but the average inter-cluster
similarity decreases as well, which makes the silhouette coefficient
small. Therefore, 3 was finally determined as the best number of clus-
ters.

When k is 3, the number of stations in three clusters, C1, C2, and C3
is 36, 43, and 70 respectively. In Fig. 6, each cluster shows a different
peak time for bike rentals. The first cluster, C1, shows a strong peak at
around 8 am, but two other clusters, C2 and C3, do not have such peaks
at that time. However, C2 has a peak at around 6 pm and C3 shows the
largest demand at 9 pm. From these observations, it could be inferred
that the main purpose that people have to rent bicycles from the sta-
tions in the different clusters.

Fig. 7 shows the spatial distribution of three clusters. As seen in
Fig. 1, two regions, the center and some northern regions of Daejeon,
are urban areas, and the boundaries of the two regions, unions of ad-
ministrative areas where the bicycle stations are located, are depicted
in Fig. 7.

Before training the predictive models for the three clusters, the
different characteristics of the temporal patterns in bike rentals was
analyzed in more detail cluster by cluster. Figs. 8 and 9 show two-
dimensional histograms over minutes of the bike usage by hours and
distances between rental and return stations for C1, C2 and C3. Be-
cause the bicycles were returned within an hour for over 85% of trips,
Figs. 8 and 9 were obtained from the trips for which the bicycles were
returned within an hour. In all the clusters, the rental times and
distances in the morning commuting time are less dispersed than

those in the evening. In C2, the rental times are mostly around 10 min
and distances between rental and return stations are usually between
1 and 2 km from 6 pm and 7 pm. In C3, the rental times and distances
are more dispersed in the evening compared with C2. The thing ob-
served only in C3 is that the number of trips whose distances between
rental and return station are less than 0.5 km is relatively more than
C1 and C2 in the evening. The reason for this is that the ratio in which
the rental station is the same as the return station is the highest in C3.
The ratios for which the rental and return stations are the same in C1,
C2 and C3 are 5.38%, 5.29%, and 10.94%, respectively. The high
ratio of returning bicycles to the same station in C3 suggests that
more people use bicycles for purposes other than transit in C3 than C1
and C2.

As similar to the system level analysis, the different time periods
were considered as well as the daily usage of bikes in building a pre-
diction model. For the station level analysis, three different time per-
iods, 7–10 am (AM), 5–8 pm (PM), and 8–11 pm (Night), were selected
based on the distinct patterns observed among the three clusters.
Table 4 shows the estimated coefficients of the negative binomial re-
gression models with the number of observations, log-likelihood, and
AIC.

The impacts of weather are not much different over different clus-
ters except the Scorching heat variable. In C1, the Scorching heat
variable is not the significant factor, but on the days the heatwave was
recorded, bicycle use decreased in C2 and C3. In addition, the estimated
coefficient in C1 is much closer to zero compared with those in C2 and
C3. It is because the peak in C1 is observed around the morning com-
muting time that is less affected by the scorching heat of midday.
However, the estimated coefficients of the Scorching heat variable is
negative and significant in all the models for PM.

Similar to the Scorching heat variable, non-working days have dif-
ferent influences on bike rentals for the three clusters. Considering the
daily total number of the bike rentals, the effect of weekends is irrele-
vant in C1. In the morning, the number of the bike rentals decreases for
all the clusters on weekends, but the decrease is the highest in C1 and
the least in C3. The same tendency is also observed during public
holidays. At PM, except C3, the number of bike rentals is not sig-
nificantly changed on weekends. In C3, the number of bike rentals in-
creased on weekends. On public holidays, the daily bike usage de-
creases in C1 and C2 while C3 is not significantly influenced by public
holidays. The effect of public holidays is only significant in the morning
for the three clusters.

The different effects of non-working days depending on the clus-
ters might be due to the different purposes of bike usage, which also
affects the temporal patterns of the bike rentals. Moreover, the ratio of
the number of people who rent a bicycle for different purposes at each
station is affected by where a station is located. Although the main
purpose of bike rentals at each cluster can be inferred from the tem-
poral pattern of bike rentals, geographical characteristics were ad-
ditionally examined for the detailed analysis. Table 5 shows the
average ratios of different land uses within a radius of 500 m from the
stations depending on the clusters. C1 has a high proportion of re-
sidential areas and there is no industrial area in C1. C2 has the rela-
tively low proportion of residential areas, compared with C1 and C3,
but the higher ratios of commercial and industrial areas than other
clusters. C3 shows the similar proportion of residential areas as that of
C1, but the ratio of industrial areas is zero in C1. Although the ratio of
residential regions in C3 is comparable to that of C1, the ratio of
stations where the number of households is more than 3000 within a
range of 500 m in C1 is 0.8056 which is higher than C2 (0.2791) and
C3 (0.5143). This observation implies that the most stations belonging
to C1 are located in residential areas. Therefore, the temporal pattern
of the bike rentals for C1 that has the peak in the morning is quite
likely to be observed.

In the case of C2, the peak around 6 pm is also well matched with
the distribution of land uses. However, although the peak time is at

6 pm, which corresponds to typical rush hours, the effect of weekends is
not significant at that time unlike the observation that the number of
bicycle rentals decreases around 8 am on weekends in C1. Furthermore,
the effect of weekends is also not significant at Night in C2 while the
number of bicycle rentals significantly increased at Night on weekends
in C3. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the peak in the morning on weekdays is
much lower than the peak at 6 pm on weekdays. One plausible ex-
planation of this trend was suggested that employers might not be in as
much of a rush as when going to work in the morning, which was
suggested in Faghih-Imani et al. (2014). However, the further analysis
was conducted to confirm the validity of this explanation in Daejeon.

To get a reasonable explanation for this observation, two additional
statistics were obtained from the datasets; 1) the mean ratios of dif-
ferent land uses by clusters only considering the top stations10 for re-
turning a bike at PM (Table 6) and 2) the number of the trip records by
rental and return stations to check flows of the trips across three clus-
ters as well as the frequencies of the bike rentals in the clusters
(Table 7).

Comparing Table 6 with Table 5, the ratios of the areas of uni-
versities and research facilities increased for all clusters when the top
stations by the number of bike returns at PM were considered, but the
difference in these ratios between two tables is the greatest in C2.
13.92% of the total trips originating from C2 at PM were trips between
the stations at university campuses or right next to the campus
boundaries.11 Moreover, 26.73% of the total trips originating from C2
at PM was the trips originating from the stations at university campuses
or right next to the campus boundaries. It is interesting to note that the
university in which these bicycle stations are located has enough dor-
mitories in which almost all student can live.12 Hence, it may be con-
cluded that there are other causes of the peak at 6 pm in C2 besides
going home.

The same conclusions were derived from Table 7. While people who
rent a bike from a station in C1 are more likely to return the bike to a
station in C2 or C3, a large flow volume within C2 and C3 was

10 The stations where the cumulative sum of the number of the bike returns is 90% of
the total were selected.

11 For the stations at university campuses or right next to the campus boundaries, the
peak time for returning a bike is around 6 pm that is consistent with the peak time for
renting a bike.

observed. At AM, the proportion of C2 for the return stations of the
bikes rented from C1 increases as expected, which is well matched with
the other evidence that supports the conclusion that the main purpose
of bike rental at the stations belonging to C1 is commuting at AM.
However, the proportion of C1 for the return stations of the bikes rented
from C2 is the lowest at PM. For C2, the volume of flows from C2 to C3,
not C1, increases at PM compared with AM. Therefore, it is hard to

conclude that the main purpose of bicycle use at PM in C2 is com-
muting.

5. Conclusions

In this study, the effects of weather and non-working days on the
number of bike rentals were examined at both the system and station

levels. To reflect the weather conditions that reduce outdoor activities
during hot summer days, the temperature-humidity index (THI) as a
discomfort index and the Scorching heat variable, indicating days when
the highest temperature of a day exceeds 30 °C was introduced. This
study confirmed that these two factors are negatively correlated with
the daily demand for bicycles, but the effects of the factors are not same
for all time periods. The coefficients of the Scorching heat variable from
1 am to 7 am were insignificant, which might be because the Scorching
heat variable only considers the highest temperature of a day.
Generally, the temperature is suitable for outdoor activities at dawn in
summer, although the highest temperature is too high to ride a bike.
Next, there was no significant difference in the number of bicycle
rentals on weekends and weekdays, but the number of bike rentals
decreased during public holidays. Similar to weather conditions, the
effects of non-working days were different by the time periods. During

commuting times, bike rentals decreased on weekends, but the number
of bike rentals increased during the daytime except for rush hours on
weekends. During public holidays, no significant change was observed
except for rush hours.

The objective of the station level analysis was to determine whether
weather and non-working days differently influence public bike rider-
ship according to the characteristics of the stations in this study. For
this aim, clustering analysis was applied to group similar stations and
then three distinct clusters were obtained. The observed clusters
showed different temporal patterns of bike rentals. C1 represents sta-
tions that have high usage during the morning commuting times. Both
C2 and C3 show the high frequency of bike rentals in the evening, but
the peak times do not match. C2 has a peak at around 6 pm and C3 has a
peak at around 9 pm. From the distributions of land uses in the three
clusters, it can be inferred that the temporal distributions of bike rentals
originate in geographical characteristics.

The effects of weather and non-working days on three clusters were
also different. The scorching heat was insignificant for C1, which might
be because the peak time of C1 is morning. Regardless of the clusters,
the number of bicycle rentals decreased in the morning on weekends,
but the amount of drop was the largest in C1. On the other hand, the
number of bicycle rentals significantly increased only in C3 at PM and
Night. From these observations, it can be inferred that the different
temporal patterns are related to the purposes of bike usage. The peak in
the morning of C1 can be attributed to commuting, but the main peaks
in C2 and C3 cannot be mainly caused by commuting. This conclusion
was also supported by other statistics such as the flows between three
clusters.

Although this work revealed that the effects of weather and non-
working days on the number of bike rentals are different from the
clusters consisting of the stations with the similar temporal patterns of
bicycle rentals, this work did not consider the other factors character-
izing the stations such as built environment and population in the
prediction models. There might be other factors that also differently
affect the demand for public bikes. Hence, if the other factors are re-
flected in a prediction model, variations among stations within the
same cluster can be better explained. In addition, the purpose of renting
a public bicycle could not be obtained from the data of Tashu system, so
I had to infer the purposes by considering the hourly rental counts, the
flows of the trips, and other information such land uses in this study.
The purpose of travels can be analyzed more precisely by analyzing the
data of Tashu system with other datasets such as household travel
surveys that provide the purposes of travels and then it will be possible
to figure out the different effects of weather and non-working days
depending on the purposes of travels. Finally, it will be meaningful to
compare different cities with a public bike sharing system in South
Korea, although the research was conducted only for Daejeon.
