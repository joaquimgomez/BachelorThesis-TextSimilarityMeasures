Sensing and Predicting the Pulse of the City through Shared Bicycling


 

Abstract 

City-wide urban infrastructures are increasingly 
reliant on network technology to improve and ex-
pand their services. As a side effect of this digitali-
zation, large amounts of data can be sensed and 
analyzed to uncover patterns of human behavior. In 
this paper, we focus on the digital footprints from 
one type of emerging urban infrastructure: shared 
bicycling systems. We provide a spatiotemporal 
analysis of 13 weeks of bicycle station usage from 
Barcelona's shared bicycling system, called Bicing. 
We apply clustering techniques to identify shared 
behaviors across stations and show how these 
behaviors relate to location, neighborhood, and 
time of day. We then compare experimental results 
from four predictive models of near-term station 
usage. Finally, we analyze the impact of factors 
such as time of day and station activity in the 
prediction capabilities of the algorithms. 

1 Introduction  

Observing and modeling human movement in urban 
environments is central to traffic forecasting, understanding 
the spread of biological viruses, designing location-based 
services, and improving urban infrastructure. However, little 
has changed since Whyte (1980) observed in his "Street Life 
Project" that the actual usage of New York's streets and 
squares clashed with the original ideas of architects and city 
planners. A key difficulty faced by urban planners, 
virologists, and social scientists is that obtaining large, real-
world observational data of human movement is challenging 
and costly (Brockman et al., 2006). 

As websites have evolved to offer geo-located services, 
new sources of real-world behavioral data have begun to 
emerge. For example, Rattenbury et al. (2007) and Girardin 
et al. (2008) used geo-tagging patterns of photographs in 
Flickr to automatically detect interesting real-world events 
and draw conclusions about the flow of tourists in a city. In 
addition, as city-wide urban infrastructures such as buses, 
subways, public utilities, and roads become digitized, other 
sources of real-world datasets that can be implicitly sensed 
are emerging. Ratti et al. (2006) and González et al. (2008) 
used cellular network data to study city dynamics and 

human mobility. McNamara et al. (2008) used data 
collected from an RFID-enabled subway system to predict 
co-location patterns amongst mass transit users. Such 
sources of data are ever-expanding and offer large, under-
explored datasets of physically-based interactions with the 
real world.  

In this paper, we introduce a novel source of real-world 
human behavioral data from a new type of urban infra-
structure: shared bicycling systems. We show how station 
usage data from Barcelona’s Bicing system (Figure 1) can 
be used to infer cultural and geographic aspects of the city 
and predict future bicycling station usage behavior, which 
corresponds to human movement in the city. 

In particular, the main contributions of this paper are: (1) 
demonstrating the potential of using shared bicycling as a 
data source to gain insights into city dynamics and 
aggregated human behavior; (2) exploring the relationship 
between spatiotemporal patterns of bicycle usage and 
underlying city behavior and geography; and (3) studying 
patterns in bicycle station usage, including the prediction of 
usage patterns and an analysis of how factors such as the 
time of the day affect this prediction. In our analysis, we 
emphasize not just what the bicycling station usage data

reveals about shared bicycling patterns, but also how these 
patterns reflect the culture and the spatial layout of the city. 

We believe this work not only has direct implications for 
the design and operation of future shared bicycling systems 
(e.g., more precise load balancing and station dimensioning, 
improved online services for Bicing users), but also for 
urban planning (e.g., for blueprinting new bicycle paths and 
roads), traffic forecasting (e.g., understanding where and 
when people are in the city), the social sciences (e.g., 
studying how people move about a city, see Latour, 2007) 
and the development of novel context-based mobile 
services. In addition, we expect that similar types of 
analyses can be applied to other sources of urban digital 
traces, such as those provided by subways (e.g., London’s 
Oyster), buses (e.g., Seattle’s Orca program), parking 
management (e.g., San Francisco’s SFpark), and cellular 
networks (González et al., 2008). Our work thus emphasizes 
the increasing role that machine learning (ML) and pattern 
recognition techniques will play to assist the aforementioned 
fields in analyzing traces of human behavior.  

2 The Bicing Dataset 

Community shared bicycling programs offer an environ-
mentally friendly, healthy, and inexpensive alternative to 
automobile transportation. Recent technological advances 
have led to a third generation shared bicycling system 
whose real-time usage data can be collected, archived, and 
analyzed. Currently, there are over forty such programs in 
the world including SmartBikeDC in Washington D.C. and 
Vélib’ in Paris, which has 20,000 bicycles and 1,450 
stations (approximately 1 station every 300 meters). 
Barcelona’s shared bicycle program, Bicing, was launched 
in March of 2007. It currently has 390 stations with 6,000 
bicycles and over 150,000 yearly subscribers.  

Bicycles are checked out by swiping an RFID membership 
card at a Bicing station kiosk (Figure 1), which then unlocks 
a bicycle and displays its rack location on an LCD screen. 
Check-out information is uploaded to a web server that 
provides real-time information about the number of 
available bicycles and vacant slots at each station. A check-
out provides 30 min of free ride time, and every 30 min 
beyond that costs €0.30 for up to two hours. Bicycles can be 
returned to any station, where they are placed in an auto-
locking rack. Warnings, monetary penalties (€3/hr), and 
eventually suspension of membership are possible if a user 
consistently returns a bicycle beyond the two hour limit. 
Bicing is open from 5AM to 12AM on Sunday through 
Thursday and 24 hours during the weekend. The Bicing 
website reports the status of all bicycle stations via a Google 
Maps visualization

1
. We scrape this webpage every two 

minutes and extract three data elements per station: the 
station’s geo-location, the number of available bicycles and 
the number of vacant parking slots. Our dataset contains 13 
weeks of contiguous observations from Aug. 27, 2008 to 
Dec.1, 2008. In total, we have collected 26.1 million 
observations from 390 stations.

In this paper, we focus primarily on weekday data 
(Monday to Friday, excluding holidays), because weekdays 
typically correspond to more regular shared bicycling usage 
patterns. 

2.1 Definitions and Notation 

In this subsection, we define the terms, notation and 
intermediary processes used in our analysis.  

Station size: Station sizes are not directly reported by the 
Bicing website, but can be calculated as the sum of available 
bicycles Bt and free parking slots St at time t at each station. 
Note that this sum fluctuates over time, likely due to a com-
bination of temporarily broken bicycles or parking slots, 
station growth as the Bicing system evolves, and/or stations 
reporting invalid numbers while being serviced. 
Consequently, we infer station size as the 95

th
 percentile of 

all observed Bt+St values for a specified time window for 
each station. The average inferred station size is 25.2 slots. 

Observation normalization: Stations range in size from 
15 to 36 slots. Therefore, a station’s data is normalized by 
dividing each observation by the inferred station size. In 
particular, analyses presented in this paper will be carried 
out using normalized available bicycles (NAB), unless 
specified otherwise. Note that NAB is analogous to the 
station’s percentage full. 

DayView: A DayView is calculated by averaging station 
data that matches certain criteria into a 24 hour window, 
discretized into five-minute bins (288 bins/day). For exam-
ple, a station’s “NAB Weekday DayView” is created by 
computing the station’s average NAB values in each of the 
288 bins for each weekday over the 13-week observation 
period. Example weekday and weekend DayViews are 
shown in Figure 2 for a single station.  

Activity and Event Score: The Activity Score (AS) is a 
measure of how active a station is at a given time: 
AS(t)=|Bt -Bt-1|, where Bt is the number of bicycles at time t.  
The Event Score (ES) is a binary version of AS: ES(t)=1 if 
AS(t)>0, otherwise ES(t)=0. We typically compute average 
Activity (ASAVG) and Event Scores (ESAVG) over a specified 
period of time to measure station activity. 

Distance metric: In order to compute the distance be-
tween two DayViews or between a single day’s data and a 
station’s DayView, we use a Dynamic Time Warping 
(DTW) based metric with a one-hour Sakoe-Chiba band 
(Sakoe, 1978). DTW was used in preference to a Euclidean-
distance measure because we were interested in comparing 
overall temporal patterns and wanted to allow for up to one 
hour of temporal shifts in the data. 

2.2 Data Cleansing 

The data scraped from the Bicing website is noisy as a result 
of temporary station closures, technical issues at the stations 
caused by maintenance work, internet connectivity failures, 
server-side SQL time-outs, and broken bicycles and parking 
slots. We employed a three step process to detect and 
eliminate these faulty observations. Data cleansing was 
critical to ensure that the data used to train our prediction 
models was valid. 



 

Observation Removal. We eliminated approximately 
10% of the 26.1 million individual observations collected 
from the Bicing website due to: (a) a fluctuating Bt + St ; 
(b) unattainable values, where Bt + St exceeded the station’s 
size; and (c) unusually low station activity, where 
ES  < 0.1* ESAVG within a twelve hour sliding time window. 

Day Removal. We then eliminated 13.7% of all observed 
days because: (a) there were too few observations for the 
day (less than 70% of the 720 possible observations/day); or 
(b) the day exhibited extremely anomalous behavior, i.e., 
the DTW distance between the day and the station’s 
DayView was larger than two standard deviations from the 
station’s average DTW distance computed across all days. 

Station Removal.  Finally, we removed all stations that 
had less than 30 weekdays (out of a total of 64) of good 
data, according to the previously described criteria. This 
step reduced the number of stations from 390 to 370 (5.1%). 

At the end of this process, a total of 20.2 million observa-
tions remained, as depicted in Table 1. 

3 Temporal and Spatiotemporal Patterns 

Before exploring the predictability of individual station 
usage, we discuss temporal and spatiotemporal patterns and 
highlight how these patterns reflect the underlying cultural 
and spatial characteristics of Barcelona. 

3.1 Temporal Patterns 

Figure 3 compares DayViews of normalized weekday and 
weekend Activity Scores (AS) for all stations. The shaded 
background in Figure 3 plots the standard deviation of the 
scores within each bin. Figure 4 shows the total number of 
bicycles checked-out from all stations over a week, aver-
aged across the 13-week observation period. Both figures 
reveal a repeating three-pronged spike in station activity 
during the weekday, which corresponds to the morning, 
lunch, and evening commutes. The “lunch spike,” which 
appears across all days, occurs at 2PM, reflecting the late 
lunch culture of Spain. As one might expect, the morning 
commute is absent in the two weekend days, resulting in a 
two-pronged spike. Fridays are the least active weekday, 
most likely due to reduced working hours in many offices in 
Barcelona, Mondays are the most active, which is also the 
most congested vehicle traffic day. The fact that people tend 
to use Bicing more during the work week reflects results of 

an online survey
2
 we conducted earlier this year with 212 

respondents, in which 75% of Bicing users stated 
commuting as a motivation to sign up for membership.  

3.2 Spatiotemporal Patterns 

The spatial layout of a city has an obvious influence on the 
movement patterns and social behaviors found therein. Bar-
celona has a mixture of residential, commercial, and recrea-
tional areas connected via narrow streets, one-way avenues 
and a multitude of public transportation options and 
topographic features. To investigate how Bicing usage 
patterns are shared across stations and geographically 
distributed in the city, we used a hierarchical clustering 
technique called dendrogram clustering (Duda, 2000) over 
each station’s DayViews.  

We built two sets of clusters: one based on weekday 
Activity Score DayViews (“Activity Clusters,” Figure 5) 
and the other on weekday Available Bicycle DayViews 
(“Bicycle Clusters,” Figure 6). In both cases, a normalized 
weekday DayView representation was created for each 
station and a similarity matrix constructed to store the DTW 
distance between each cluster. The clustering algorithm 
began with 390 clusters (one for each station). Cluster-to-
cluster similarity was calculated as the average of all DTW 
distances between the weekday DayViews of each station 
within the cluster. At each clustering iteration, the two most 
similar clusters were grouped together. Clustering 
terminated when the average intercluster-to-intracluster 
distance was maximized with a weight applied to decrease 
the total number of clusters. Note that the clustering 
algorithm had no knowledge about the station’s geo-
location.  

Figures 5 and 6 (top) illustrate the clustering results in a 
geo-visualization of Barcelona and show that neighboring 
stations generally share similar usage patterns. Each node 
represents a station location colored according to cluster 
membership. The line graphs shown in Figure 5 and 6 
(bottom) were created by averaging normalized 
activity/bicycle data across all the stations in each of the 
clusters. The shading around the lines depicts the standard 
deviation across stations in each of the 288 DayView bins. 
The line colors are consistent with the cluster colors used in 
the map visualization.

Activity Clusters. The clustering algorithm returned five 
activity clusters (Figure 5), each with a similar three-
pronged spike shape (see also Figure 3). The clusters gener-
ally become more active (from A1 to A5) as one moves 
from the outward edges of the city into downtown. The least 
active cluster, Cluster A1 (N=207), surrounds nearly the 
entire perimeter of Barcelona. The more active clusters (A3, 
A4, and A5) become noticeably more active as the day ad-
vances.  

Bicycle Clusters. Our algorithm identified six bicycle 
clusters (depicted in Figure 6) with three classes of 
behavior: outgoing (Clusters B3 and B4), incoming 
(Clusters B5 and B6) and flat (Clusters B1 and B2). The 
outgoing clusters show a precipitous drop in available bi-
cycles around 7-8AM as people leave for work, a slight rise 
at 2-3PM during lunch and a return to early morning levels 
by 10-11PM. These stations are spread around the edges of 
the downtown and midtown sections of the city. The 
incoming stations are located in high density commercial 
areas and along two major arterial routes: Rambla de 
Catalunya and Avinguda Diagonal. The incoming station 
shape is nearly inverse of the outgoing stations: people be-
gin arriving around 7-8AM and begin leaving around 
1-2PM. Many financial businesses in Barcelona open at 
9AM and close around 2:30PM, which aligns well with the 
temporal patterns of these two clusters. Finally, clusters B1 
and B2 have relatively flat usage patterns. Cluster B2 tends 
to have a high degree of available bicycles (on average, it is 
66% full) whereas cluster B1 is just the opposite (15% 
availability). One reason for this discrepancy is likely due to 
Barcelona’s topography: the city itself is built on a long 
incline. Stations located at the top of Figure 6 are between 
80-110 meters above sea level versus those at the bottom, 
which are at 0-10 meters above sea level. People tend not to 

bicycle up to the higher altitudes, thus leaving those stations 
in Cluster B1 starving for bicycles. 

4 Station Behavior Prediction 

We focus next on the prediction of station usage. In 
particular, we are interested in predicting the number of 
available bicycles at each station at a given time in the fu-
ture. This work is related to traffic forecasting. Most 
approaches in traffic engineering rely on flow theory and 
incorporate queue-theoretic models (Vandaele et al., 2000). 
Horvitz et al. (2005) took an alternative approach that is 
closely related to ours: they successfully modeled key traffic 
bottleneck areas using a Bayesian network and ignored the 
underlying flows. Similarly, we do not attempt to model 
individual bicycle movements in the city but rather focus on 
modeling Bicing station usage directly.  

Predictive station usage models would (a) allow for more 
accurate load balancing of the stations; (b) assist urban 
planners and city officials by providing them with 
information about expected activity in the city; and (c) open 
the way to new mobile services for Bicing users. In the 
previously mentioned online survey, Bicing users identified 
finding an available bicycle and parking slot as the two 
most important problems in their Bicing experience (76% 
and 66% of respondents, respectively). Therefore, we are 
also interested in predicting the probability of finding a free 
bicycle and slot in a station at a given time in the future. 
Furthermore, our models shed light on some of the factors 
that influence the predictability of station usage behavior. 

4.1 Models of Station Behavior 

We have implemented four simple predictive models, 
including a Bayesian network (BN) to predict the 
availability of bicycles at each station. All models have 
three input parameters: (1) the current time 𝑡0; (2) the last

known number of bicycles at time 𝑡0 (Bt0); (3) and a 
prediction window (PW) that specifies how far into the 
future to predict. In this paper, we focus on PW values 
ranging from 10 min to 120 min, as they correspond to the 
most common Bicing usage scenario. Models that use 
historic data have a fourth input parameter: all previous 
observations up to time 𝑡0.  

Last Value (LV). This model predicts that the current 
number of available bicycles remains constant at its last 
measured value of 𝐵𝑡0  for all PW: 

𝑷𝒓𝒆𝒅𝑳𝑽(𝒕𝟎, 𝑩𝑡0 , 𝑷𝑾) = 𝑩𝒕𝟎  

Historic Mean (HM). This model dynamically constructs 
a DayView based on all observations up to 𝑡0 , and returns 
the value at the corresponding DayView’s time bin (𝑡0 +
𝑃𝑊). More formally: Let the average number of bicycles in 
time bin 𝑇𝐵𝑡0 within a DayView be denoted as 𝐵 𝑇𝐵𝑡0. The 
HM predictor forecasts the number of bicycles at time 
𝑡0 + 𝑃𝑊: 

𝑷𝒓𝒆𝒅𝑯𝑴(𝒕𝟎, 𝑩𝒕𝟎 , 𝑷𝑾) = 𝑩
 

𝑻𝑩𝒕𝟎+𝑷𝑾 

In other words, this predictor returns the average number 
of bicycles in the time bin 𝑡0 + 𝑃𝑊. 

Historic Trend (HT). This model builds upon the LV and 
HM predictors. The historic trend is extracted by computing 
the difference in the average number of bicycles at 𝑡0 and  
𝑡0 + 𝑃𝑊 , and adding it to the current number of bicycles, 
𝐵𝑡0: 

𝑷𝒓𝒆𝒅𝑯𝑻 𝒕𝟎, 𝑩𝒕𝟎 , 𝑷𝑾 = 𝑩𝒕𝟎 + 𝑩
 

𝑻𝑩𝒕𝟎+𝑷𝑾
−𝑩 𝑻𝑩𝒕𝟎

 

Bayesian Network (BN). This model consists of a simple 
BN per station with three observed (input) nodes and one 
hidden (output) node, where all observed nodes are the 
parents of the hidden or output node (naïve Bayes), as 
depicted in Figure 7. 

 
The nodes of the network are: (1) time, a discrete observed 

node with 24 possible values corresponding to each of the 
hours of the day; (2) bikes, the value of NAB at time t, 
discretized into five bins, where a value of one corresponds 
to 0-20% of bicycles, two corresponds to 20-40%, etc; (3) 
PW, the size of the prediction window, with six possible 
values corresponding to 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes 
into the future; and (4) delta, a continuous Gaussian variable 
that contains the change in the number of bikes at time t + 
PW with respect to its value at time t. Predictions in the 
number of bicycles are made by adding the value of the 
delta node to the most recent observation: 

𝑷𝒓𝒆𝒅𝑩𝑵 𝒕𝟎, 𝑩𝒕𝟎 , 𝑷𝑾 = 𝑩𝒕𝟎 + delta 

The dimensionality of the values in the three observed 
discrete nodes will have an effect on the accuracy of the 
BN. We carried out extensive experiments with two pilot 
stations to determine the optimal dimensionality of the dis-
crete nodes. The above configuration had the smallest pre-
diction error and therefore has been used for all stations. 

The three history-based predictors used three weeks of 
historic data, from Nov. 2, 2008 to Nov. 23, 2008 (see 
Figure 10) to build their models. The HM and HT predictors 
used the corresponding DayViews built from the same 
three-week period. Each BN was trained by computing a 
posterior over the parameters given the fully observed data 
from time, bikes, PW and delta, with 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 covering the 
three-week period of training data, in five minute 
increments. We used the Matlab BN toolkit by Kevin 
Murphy

3
 to learn the parameters of the Bayesian network 

(“learn_params”) and to compute the ML estimation of the 
unobserved delta note (in the toolbox labeled as 
“marginal_nodes” of a “jtree_inf_engine”). 

4.2 Prediction Evaluation 

We used the next five weekdays following our training data 
(i.e., from Nov. 24 to Nov. 28, 2008) to evaluate the models. 
To simulate real-world conditions, we did not remove 
unusual days from the test data. Starting at midnight on Nov 
24

th
, the prediction models were fed the current time (in five 

minute increments), the current number of available 
bicycles, and each of the six previously mentioned PW 
values. For each PW, our models returned the predicted 
number of available bicycles. 

The prediction error was computed as the absolute 
difference between the predicted number of bicycles and the 
ground truth observation at time t0 + PW. The error was 
normalized by the station’s size (thus, given in NAB units). 
For completeness, we also compared our results to a 
Random predictor (Rand), which returns a random value 
drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and the 
station’s size. 

Table 2 lists the prediction error for each of the models, 
averaged over all stations, all days and all values of PW. 
The BN predictor had the smallest average error of 0.08 
NAB. At a station with 25 slots, this corresponds to an 
average error of two bicycles (8%). 

Interestingly, the HM predictor performed worst of all - 
excluding the random model, implying that a station’s daily 
activity is quite varied when compared to its historic mean. 
This highlights the importance of giving more weight to the 
most recent observations. 

Full-Empty Station State Prediction. From the 
perspective of both Bicing users and managers, a more 
useful measure is the accuracy in predicting if the station is 
empty (i.e., relevant when someone wants to pick up a 
bicycle) or if the station is full (i.e., someone wants to drop 
off a bicycle). In both cases, the station state can easily be 
derived from the number of available bicycles as predicted 
by our models.

In Table 3 below, we compare the resulting classification 

errors applying the above models with a PW=120min, 

which is the most challenging scenario. Note that in the 

analysis below, we: (1) exclude the Rand, HM and LV 

models, as they perform poorly for PW=120 min; (2) 

include the classification error of two additional binary 

classifiers that have been trained to predict the station states: 

a decision tree classifier (ID3) and a support vector machine 

classifier (SVM) with a dot product kernel. Both classifiers 

have been trained and evaluated with observation triplets 

that consist of the time of the day (in minutes), the 

percentage full of the station (i.e. a number between 0% and 

100% specifying how full a station is with respect to its 

capacity) and the state of the station (full/not full; and 

empty/not empty) at PW=120 min. Note that we train one 

classifier per binary decision: full/not full and empty/not 

empty.

Table 3. Comparison of the error of four classifiers at PW=120 min. The 

predicted number of bicycles of the HT and BN models were used to obtain 
the predicted station state. In contrast, the ID3 and SVM classifiers are 

directly trained and evaluated with the station state. 

Interestingly, the four classifiers listed in Table 3 show 

very similar classification errors, despite using different 

input variables and optimizing different cost functions 

(generative vs. discriminative approaches). The similarity 

between prediction errors may indicate that the lower bound 

of station state predictability is ~12%. Data from additional 

sources (e.g., weather, local event information, train 

schedules) might be needed to overcome this barrier. 

4.2 Factors that Impact Predictability 

Next, we discuss factors that impact the predictability of the 
stations’ usage. 

Prediction Window. The average prediction error as a 
function of PW is shown in Figure 8. The HM predictor 
resulted in an average error of 0.17 regardless of the PW. If 
station usage was perfectly consistent across weekdays, this 
predictor would perform flawlessly. The LV predictor did 

nearly as well as the best performing predictors for PW <= 
60 min. Thus, for small PWs the number of available 
bicycles at t0 is a strong indicator of the number of available 
bicycles at t0 + PW. For PWs > 60 min, however, the HT 
and BN predictors begin to perform significantly better than 
the rest: an unpaired t-test showed that the difference in 
prediction error at PW=120min is significant between all 
four predictors: t(1002229) = 34-158, p < 0.001 
(Bonferroni's adjustment for comparing five models 
applied). A mobile Bicing user interested in predicted 
station vacancies would likely be most interested in PW <= 
60 min, where the LV, HT, and BN models are able to 
predict the number of available bicycles to within a single 
bicycle.  

Time of the Day. Figure 9 shows the accuracy of the four  
predictors as a function of time of day. As expected, all 
predictors perform well during the night, when there is little 
activity, and become less accurate during the day. Although 
all predictors performed worse during the most active times 
of day, the BN was the most resilient. 

Amount of Historic Data. Three of the station usage 
models required previous observations to build their 
predictions. Given that our models are data driven, an open 
question is how much data is needed to build accurate 
models. Figure 10 shows the average prediction error for six 
stations (one per Bicycle cluster) at PW=120min. The more 
observations used, the lower the prediction error of the HT 
and BN predictors. After 15 weekdays of training data, the 
average prediction error plateaus, showing a 22% (HT) and 
26% (BN) improvement over predictors trained with only a 
single day. Note the error of the HM predictor actually 
increases with more observations, corroborating the 
intuition that more recent data should be weighted higher. 

Station Clusters. To better understand how station usage 
patterns affect predictability, we grouped our prediction 
results by the Activity and Bicycle Clusters presented in 
Section 3. In general, the more active stations are more 
difficult to predict (Figure 11). The BN is significantly bet-
ter in the more active clusters than other predictors. The flat 
clusters (B1 and B2) result in the lowest overall prediction 
error as there is minimal variation in bicycle availability 
over time (Figure 12). There is no significant difference 
between incoming and outgoing stations, probably due to 
having similar, yet reversed, dynamics in their behavior.

5 Conclusions and Future Work 

As urban infrastructures are increasingly digitized, human 
behavior data will become ubiquitous. Pattern recognition 
and ML techniques will be necessary to sort through and 
analyze the large amounts of real-world behavioral data 
being produced. We have shown how shared bicycling 
station usage data can reveal not just patterns of bicycling 
usage, but also the underlying temporal and spatial 
dynamics of a city. We have also shown that fairly simple 
predictive models are able to predict station usage with an 
average error of only two bicycles and can classify station 
state (full, empty, or in-between) with 80% accuracy up to 
two hours into the future. Our experiments indicate that 10 
to 15 weekdays of historic data are enough to build station 
models. 

Although some of the results presented in this paper align 
with our intuition of human behavior patterns in Barcelona, 
other details were surprising. For example, shared temporal 
trends in station usage can allow us to infer attributes about 
neighborhoods (e.g., residential vs. commercial, proximity 
to downtown). Station usage is also far less regular than 
initially suspected, as revealed by the poor performance of 
the HM predictor. Although shared bicycling station usage 
is only one source of human movement in the city, it has the 
potential to uncover underlying temporal and spatial 
dynamics of the city, as shown in this paper. We believe 
similar analyses can be expanded to and combined with 
other digitized urban infrastructures such as roadways, 
buses, and subways. 

In the future, we would like to incorporate contextual 
features into our BN, such as weather, season, special events 
(e.g., concerts or soccer matches), public transportation 
schedules and locations, and data from additional urban 
infrastructure (e.g., cellular networks). We also plan to 
experiment with dynamic BNs and continuous dynamic 
models. We are currently working to leverage our prediction 

results as a backend for mobile and web applications that 
would provide real-time information about the probability of 
finding a bicycle or a free parking slot at a station. Finally, 
we are logging 18 additional shared bicycling programs 
including Paris and Washington D.C. and are planning a 
large-scale analysis that compares behavioral patterns across 
cities.
