ABSTRACT 
 
Installed in 2009, BIXI is the first major public bicycle-sharing system in Montreal, Canada. The 
BIXI system has been a success, accounting for more than one million trips annually. This 
success has increased the interest in exploring the factors affecting bicycle-sharing flows and 
usage. Using data compiled as minute-by-minute readings of bicycle availability at all the 
stations of the BIXI system between April and August 2012, this study contributes to the 
literature on bicycle-sharing. We examine the influence of meteorological data, temporal 
characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use and built environment attributes on arrival and 
departure flows at the station level using a multilevel approach to statistical modeling, which 
could easily be applied to other regions. The findings allow us to identify factors contributing to 
increased usage of bicycle-sharing in Montreal and to provide recommendations pertaining to 
station size and location decisions. The developed methodology and findings can be of benefit to 
city planners and engineers who are designing or modifying bicycle-sharing systems with the 
goal of maximizing usage and availability.

1. Introduction 
 
In recent years, there has been growing attention on bicycle-sharing systems as an alternative and 
complementary mode of transportation. These systems are recognized to have traffic and health 
benefits such as flexible mobility, physical activity, and support for multimodal transport 
connections (Shaheen et al., 2010). A bicycle-sharing system is intended to provide more 
convenience because individuals can use the service without the costs and responsibilities 
associated with owning a bicycle for short trips within the service area of the system. Further, a 
bicycle-sharing system frees individuals from the need to secure their bicycles; bicycle theft is a 
common problem in urban regions (van Lierop et al., 2013; Rietveld and Daniel, 2004). Another 
advantage associated with this system is that the decision to make a trip by bicycle can be made 
in a short time frame. 

Currently, there are more than 4 hundred thousand public bicycles around the world and 
400 cities have installed or are planning to install a bicycle-sharing system (Fishman et al., 
2013). BIXI (a word formed by combining bicycle and taxi) was one of the first major public 
bicycle-sharing systems in North America. It was installed in 2009 in Montreal, Canada. The 
service began with 3000 bicycles and 300 stations. In 2012, the BIXI system had 410 stations 
with more than 4000 bicycles. Although bicycle-sharing systems are becoming more and more 
common around the world, there are relatively few studies exploring the factors affecting shared 
bicycle flows and usage. Fishman et al. (2013), after an extensive literature review, concluded 
that in order to better understand and maximize the effectiveness of bicycle-sharing programs, 
the evaluation of current performance of bicycle-sharing systems is crucial. Demand modeling 
plays an important role in determining the required capacity, and hence the success of new 
bicycle-sharing systems and/or the success of expanding an existing system. BIXI in Montreal is 
a mature system that offers a unique opportunity for understanding the factors influencing its 
flows and usage.  

In this study, using data compiled from minute-by-minute readings of bicycle availability 
at all 410 stations on the BIXI website between April and August 2012, we attempt to examine 
the determinants of bicycle-sharing demand in Montreal. The BIXI database compiled is 
augmented with meteorological data, temporal characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use, 
and built environment attributes allowing us to examine the influence of these factors on bicycle-
sharing system demand. Specifically, the main objective of the current paper is to quantify the 
influence of various factors on arrival and departure flows at the bicycle sharing station level 
using a general statistical modeling technique that other regions can adopt. The study employs a 
multilevel linear mixed modeling approach that explicitly recognizes the dependencies 
associated with bicycle flows originating at the same station. The model results obtained are 
validated using operational data compiled from 2013 (one year after the data used to fit the 
model). Further, we compute elasticity estimates of various attributes to illustrate the 
applicability of the developed model for policy analysis.  

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review of 
earlier research and positions our research. Section 3 explains the data compilation and sample 
formation in detail. Section 4 presents the visual representation of BIXI flows. The statistical 
model employed in this paper and the model estimation results are discussed in section 5. Section 
6 discusses a policy exercise. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper with recommendations for 
future research.

2. Literature Review 

  
The first bicycle-sharing system was introduced in the 1960s in the Netherlands (DeMaio, 2009; 
Shaheen et al., 2010). Since then, there have been four generations of these systems. The first 
generation was “white bicycles” or free bicycles available in different locations around the city. 
The idea was simple: a person would pick up one of the bicycles, which were typically painted in 
bright colors and unlocked, ride it to his or her destination, and leave it there for the next possible 
user. It was free and without any time constraint. This program failed because of many stolen 
and vandalized bicycles. In the 1990s, a second-generation coin-deposit system was introduced 
as a result of the experience of the first generation of bicycle-sharing systems. Locked bicycles 
could be borrowed with a small deposit, which was usually refunded on return. Unfortunately, 
this did not eliminate the issue of bicycle theft due to user anonymity (Shaheen et al., 2010). 
Also, no time limit for the use of bicycles resulted in excessively long rental periods for 
borrowed bicycles. The third generation system added transaction kiosks to docking stations to 
solve the problem of user anonymity. People could rent a bicycle for only a limited amount of 
time. These systems became relatively successful around the world. Fourth generation systems, 
also called demand-responsive multimodal systems, have been built on the success of the third 
generation, while also improving docking stations, bicycle redistribution, and integration with 
other transport modes (DeMaio, 2009; Shaheen et al., 2010). BIXI belongs to the latest 
generation of bicycle-sharing systems. The BIXI system aggregated more than 3.4 million trips 
in the 2010 season (PBSC, 2013).  

Over the past few years there have been several studies devoted to examining factors 
affecting bicycle-sharing flows and usage. A subset of these studies conducted a feasibility 
analysis, proposing different bicycle-sharing programs for different cities (for example, see 
Gregerson et al., 2010). These studies typically aim to identify potential locations for stations 
and to estimate bicycle-sharing flows and usage considering socio-demographic and land-use 
variables (such as population and job density) as well as topological and meteorological 
parameters for the proposed locations. There are relatively few quantitative studies on bicycle-
sharing systems employing actual bicycle usage data. Nair et al. (2013) investigated several 
aspects of such systems including system characteristics, utilization patterns and the connection 
with public transit using data from the Velib’ bicycle-sharing system in Paris, France. Buck and 
Buehler (2012) explored the influence of various factors — including bicycle lanes, population, 
number of households without a car, and retail destinations around the stations — on bicycle 
flows of the Capital bicycle-sharing system in Washington DC. Krykewycz et al. (2010) 
estimated demand for a proposed bicycle-sharing program in Philadelphia using observed 
bicycle flow rates in European cities. Rixey (2013) investigated the effects of demographic and 
built environment characteristics on average monthly bicycle usage in three different cities in the 
US at the station level using a regression analysis. He concluded that population density, job 
density, income levels, and the share of alternative commuters are all critical factors affecting 
bicycle-sharing ridership. The same approach has been applied by Daddio (2012) to the bicycle-
sharing system in Washington DC. Wang et al. (2012), in their analysis, considered annual rates 
for each station and examined the effects of nearby business and job densities, socio-
demographics, built environment, and transportation infrastructure variables on annual usage 
flows. They found that locating stations closer to jobs results in higher usage of the bicycle-



5 
 

sharing system. Moreover, the presence of food-related businesses near stations has a more 
positive impact on arrivals and departures than non-food commercial businesses. 

The objective of our research effort is similar to these previous studies. However by 
using aggregated monthly or yearly flow rates, these studies fail to capture the impact of 
variables that change in the short term; i.e., at an hourly level (such as variations in weather and 
time-of-day effects). Neglecting the presence of such variations usually reduces the applicability 
of the results obtained. Moreover, examining bicycle flows at an hourly level (or a short time 
frame) allows the analyst to provide the operators with bicycle demand profiles including excess 
and shortage information. A more recent research effort, Hampshire et al. (2013), studied the 
influence of bicycle infrastructure attributes and land-use characteristics on bicycle flows using 
aggregated hourly arrival and departure rates at the sub-city district (SCD) level in Barcelona and 
Seville, Spain. They highlighted that bicycle station density, the average capacity of stations in 
the SCD, and the number of points of interest in SCD are important contributors to arrival and 
departure rates. Contrary to the previously mentioned literature, while Hampshire et al. (2013) 
used a fine temporal dimension, their study fails to capture fine-grained spatial effects because 
the station flows studied are aggregated at the SCD level.  

There have been several studies conducted using the BIXI system. These studies use 
survey data rather than actual bicycle flow data obtained from stations. They contribute to the 
literature by studying user behavior in response to bicycle-sharing systems and examine the 
integration of this system with public transit (Bachand-Marleau et al., 2011; Bachand-Marleau et 
al., 2012; Fuller et al., 2011)1. 

The current paper contributes to literature by determining the effect of meteorological 
data, temporal characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use and urban form attributes on 
bicycle arrival and departure flows at the station level using real data. The estimated models will 
allow us to predict changes to the demand profiles (arrivals and departure flows) allowing us to 
examine the influence of changes to the system – capacity reallocation or new station 
installation.  

 
3. Data 

 
For this study, the hourly arrival and departure rates are obtained from minute-by-minute BIXI 
bicycle availability data for all stations in service (410 stations) between April and August 2012. 
Figure 1 shows the location of BIXI stations on the Montreal Island. It is important to note that, 
due to severe winter conditions in Montreal, the BIXI season starts on April 15th and ends on 
November 15th of each year.  

A sample formation exercise was necessary to obtain the arrival and departure rates from 
the bicycle availability data for every station. The raw data saved from the BIXI website 
provided information on the number of bicycles available at each station for every minute. The 
raw data was processed to generate minute-by-minute bicycle arrival and departure rates for 
every station. The arrival and departure rates obtained are not necessarily due to customer-based 
bicycle flows. It is important to note that bicycle-sharing system operators frequently perform 
rebalancing operations, removing bicycles from stations that are full and refilling the docks of 

                                                 
1 A stream of studies concentrates on operational issues of bicycle-sharing systems such as maximizing efficiency of 
operator rebalancing program (Borgnat et al., 2011; Froehlich et al., 2009; Jensen et al., 2010; Kaltenbrunner et al., 
2010; Vogel and Mattfeld, 2011). The focus of these studies is more on optimizing bicycle repositioning operations 
to remove bicycles from full stations and refill empty stations, and it is not particularly related to our research effort.

empty stations. Unfortunately, the occurrence of rebalancing operations is not indicated in the 
minute-by-minute data available, and so it is not possible to directly distinguish whether the 
addition (removal) of bicycles is due to customers or operators. So, we adopt a heuristic 
mechanism to arrive at the “true” arrivals and departures. We identify spikes of bicycle 
availability (or removal) in the data compiled to differentiate between customer flows and 
operator flows. For this purpose, we aggregate the flow rate data temporally up to a 5-minute 
level to capture the effect of rebalancing operations. Specifically, we assume that a rebalancing 
operation has occurred if the 5-minute arrival/departure rate is greater than the 99th percentile 
arrival/departure for that station. When such a trigger is identified, the actual bicycle flow for 
this 5-minute period is obtained by averaging the bicycle flow rates of the two earlier 5-minute 
periods and the remainder of the flow is allocated to the rebalancing operation (a slight variant of 
this approach is employed in Hampshire et al., 2013). After correcting for rebalancing 
operations, hourly arrival and departure rates for every station are obtained by aggregating this 5-
minute bicycle flow data. 

Although the BIXI season starts April 15th every year, only a subset of the stations begin 
functioning within the first ten days of the season. Hence, from 2012 BIXI data, we removed the 
month of April and restricted our sample to the four months of May, June, July and August. 
Subsequently, to obtain a reasonable sample size, we randomly select two days for every station 
in our database. The arrival/departure rates in overnight hours (1 AM to 6 AM) are very low. 
Thus, we aggregate the bicycle flow rates in the overnight time period as one record, generating 
20 records for every day (one for the period 1 AM to 6 AM, and one for each remaining hour of 
the day). Further, to account for the influence of station capacity on bicycle flows, we 
normalized our dependent variable (arrivals or departures at a station) with station capacity. The 
final sample consisted of 16400 records (20 hours × 2 days × 410 stations) of normalized 
arrival and departure rates at a station level. The data sample compiled is well distributed across 
the four months (percentages of April, May, June and July range between 22.4 and 26 percent) 
and across all 7 days in a week (daily shares range from 12.8 to 15.6 percent). To be sure, the 
data sample employed in our analysis forms a small share of the entire data compiled. If the 
objective is to estimate a linear regression model, large sample size would not be an issue. 
However, in our paper, we estimate a linear mixed model (described in Section 5) whose 
structure results in longer model run times for larger samples. Further, employing very large 
samples for model estimation might result in data over-fit and inflated parameter significance. 
Two separate models are developed to examine the arrival rates and departure rates at every 
station. 

 
3.1. Independent variable generation 
The independent variables considered in our analysis can be categorized into three groups: (1) 
weather, (2) temporal and (3) spatial variables. Weather variables include hourly temperature, 
relative humidity, and the hourly weather condition represented as a dummy variable indicating 
whether or not it is raining. The temporal variables considered aim to capture time-of-day and 
day-of-the-week effects. Specifically, the day is divided into four periods: morning (6AM-
10AM), mid-day (10AM-3PM), PM (3PM-7PM) evening (7PM- 12AM). The influence of 
weekend vs. weekday was also taken into account. Further, to account for young individual users 
in the downtown core of Montreal, we included a Friday and Saturday night dummy variable to 
test for possible increase in BIXI usage during these periods compared to other times. 



7 
 

To examine the spatial determinants influencing bicycle usage at each station, two classes 
of spatial variables were used: a) Bicycle infrastructure and b) Land-use and built environment 
variables. The bicycle infrastructure variables included are at both the traffic analysis zone 
(TAZ2) level and the buffer level. A 250 meter buffer around each station was found to be an 
appropriate walking distance considering the distances between BIXI stations. Bicycle 
infrastructure variables were used to examine the effect of cycling facilities on the bicycle 
demand and usage of the bicycle-sharing system. The length of bicycle facilities (bicycle lanes 
and bicycle paths) in the buffer was calculated to capture the impact of placing BIXI stations 
near bicycle facilities on the usage of the bicycle-sharing system. Moreover, the length of minor 
roads (local streets and collectors) and major roads (arterials and highways) in the buffer were 
calculated to identify cyclist preference of routes. The number and capacity of BIXI stations in 
the 250 meter buffer were computed to capture the effect of neighbouring stations. 

Land-use and built environment characteristics are the other group of variables 
considered in our analysis. To study the influence of the central business district (CBD), the 
distance from each station to the CBD was computed. The walkscore corresponding to every 
station is also generated3. The presence of metro and bus stations near a BIXI station and the 
length of bus lines in the 250 meter buffer were generated to examine the influence of public 
transit on bicycle arrival and departure rates. We also considered three types of points of interest 
near each station: (1) the number of restaurants (including coffee shops and bars), (2) the number 
of other commercial enterprises and (3) a categorical variable indicating whether or not the BIXI 
station is near a university. The TAZ level variables considered in our analysis include 
population density and job density of the TAZ associated with each BIXI station. To provide an 
illustration of the data compiled, we provide a descriptive summary of the sample in Table 1. 

 
4. Visual Representation of BIXI flows 

 
In order to better understand the spatial and temporal variation of bicycle usage in the BIXI 
system, we represent the bicycle arrival and departure rates of every station visually using a 
geographic information system. For this purpose, the bicycle flows of every station in every day 
of June were considered. To conserve space, we mainly focus on the AM and PM time periods in 
our visualization exercise. We compute the average hourly arrival and departure flows at every 
station for the AM and PM time periods. The patterns are presented in Figure 2. Several 
interesting observations can be made from the results. First, we can see that flows are much 
higher for the BIXI system during the PM period. One plausible explanation for the trend is that 
employed individuals might find it easier to bicycle home since they are presumably not in as 
much of a rush as when going to work in the morning. These individuals might decide to arrive 
at work using less strenuous modes (such as bus or metro). Furthermore, people might also 
consider riding the BIXI as a useful exercise after work or might make short trips within the 
CBD — for instance, going from work to a restaurant. It is also possible that during the evening 
peak hour the population using BIXI includes students and other individuals without the typical 
schedule (e.g., workers in restaurants and coffee shops, and non-workers). Second, the higher 
concentration of arrival rates in CBD in the morning peak hour confirms the use of bicycle-
sharing system for daily commute purposes. Third, the results indicate that bicycle flows are

more spatially widespread in the evening peak compared to morning peak. Overall, the 
visualization provides a brief overview of bicycle flows in Montreal using the BIXI system. 

 
5. Analysis and Discussion 

 
5.1. Linear mixed models 
The most common methodology employed to study continuous dependent variables such as 
arrival and departure flows is the linear regression model. However, the traditional linear 
regression model is not appropriate to study data with multiple repeated observations. In our 
empirical analysis, we observe the arrivals and departures at the same station at an hourly level 
for each station. Hence to recognize this, we employ a multilevel linear model that explicitly 
recognizes the dependencies associated with the bicycle flow variable originating from the same 
BIXI station. Specifically, we employ a linear mixed modeling approach that builds on the linear 
regression model while incorporating the influence of repeated observations from the same 
station. The linear mixed model collapses to a simple linear regression model in the absence of 
any station specific effects. A brief description of the linear mixed model is provided below.  
 Let q = 1, 2, …, Q be an index to represent each station, d = 1, 2, …, D be an index to 
represent the various days on which data was collected and t = 1, 2, …, 20 be an index for hourly 
data collection period. The dependent variable (arrival or departure rate over station capacity) is 
modeled using a linear regression equation which, in its most general form, has the following 
structure: 

yqdt = βX + ε 
where yqdt is the normalized arrival or departure rate as dependent variable, X is an L×1 column 
vector of attributes and the model coefficients, β, is an L×1 column vector. The random error 
term, ε, is assumed to be normally distributed across the dataset. 

The error term may consist of three components of unobserved factors: a station 
component, a day component, and an hour-of-the-day component. Due to the substantial size of 
the data and the number of independent variables considered in our study, it is prohibitively 
burdensome, in terms of run time, to estimate the combined influence of the three components 
simultaneously. Thus, we consider the station and the time-of-day to be related common 
unobserved effects. In this structure, the data can be visualized as 20 records for each 
Station-Day combination for a total of 820 observations. Estimating a full covariance matrix (20 
x 20) is computationally intensive while providing very little intuition. Hence, we parameterize 
the covariance matrix (Ω). For estimating a parsimonious specification, we assume a first-order 
autoregressive moving average correlation structure with three parameters σ, ρ, and φ as follows: 

 

Ω 	

1 				
1

	 ⋯
⋯ ⋯ ⋯

⋮ ⋮							
⋯										

⋮ ⋮ ⋮
⋯ ⋯ 1

 

 
The parameter σ represents the error variance of ε, φ represents the common correlation factor 
across time periods, and ρ represents the dampening parameter that reduces the correlation with 
time. The correlation parameters φ and ρ, if significant, highlight the impact of station specific 
effects on the dependent variables.  The models are estimated in SPSS using the Restricted 
Maximum Likelihood Approach (REML) that is slightly different from maximum likelihood 



9 
 

(ML) approach. The REML approach estimates the parameters by computing the likelihood 
function on a transformed dataset. The approach is commonly used for linear mixed models 
(Harville, 1977). 
 
5.2. Model fit measures 
In our study, two model frameworks were estimated for arrivals and departures: (1) a linear 
regression model and (2) a linear mixed model. The final model selection was based on the 
restricted log-likelihood and Bayesian Information Criterion metrics. Our model estimation 
process was guided by considerations of parsimony and intuitiveness. The two model 
frameworks were compared using the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test. For the arrivals model, the 
LLR test statistic was significant at any reasonable level of significance (the LLR test-statistic 
value was 3632, significantly higher than the corresponding chi-square value for two additional 
degrees of freedom (φ and ρ)). Similarly, for the departures model, the LLR test statistic was 
significant at any reasonable level of significance (the LLR test-statistic value was 3491). The 
LLR test comparisons clearly highlight the suitability of the mixed modeling approach employed 
in our analysis for examining the determinants of BIXI usage in Montreal.  

 
5.3. Results 
In this section, we discuss the results of linear mixed model estimation to understand the 
different effects of meteorological, spatial and temporal elements on the bicycle usage in the 
BIXI bicycle-sharing system. It must be noted that we considered several specifications but only 
the statistically significant results for arrival and departure rates are presented in Table 2.  

 
5.3.1.  Weather variables 
As expected, there is a positive correlation between temperature and the arrival and departure 
rates. On the other hand, humidity has a negative impact on the arrival and departure rates. 
People are less likely to ride a bicycle in rainy or very humid time periods. However, the rainy 
weather variable is not significant for the arrival rate model. This might be explained by the idea 
that the weather has a stronger effect on the decision of taking out a bicycle than on returning it. 

 
5.3.2. Temporal Variables    
People tend to bicycle more on weekdays than weekends, as highlighted by the negative 
coefficient of the weekend variable. The interpretation of the time-of-day variables needs to be 
judiciously undertaken due to the presence of interaction effects with population density and 
university variables. Nevertheless, we clearly observe that the BIXI system is more 
predominantly used during the PM period relative to other times of the day. The likelihood of 
using bicycle-sharing systems increases on Friday and Saturday nights, indicating a propensity of 
young individual users in the downtown core of Montreal during these periods compared to other 
days. 

 
5.3.3. Bicycle Infrastructure Variables 
In this section, the results for parameters related to bicycling infrastructure variables are 
explained. The bicycle flows and usage of the bicycle-sharing system increase when there are 
more bicycle facilities (bicycle lanes, bicycle paths, etc.) nearby a BIXI station (in agreement 
with the findings of Buck and Buehler, 2012). While the length of minor roads in a 250 meter 
buffer of each station is associated with a positive impact on arrival and departure rates, the 



10 
 

length of major roads has a negative effect. The results indicate that BIXI usage is more likely to 
occur in densely populated neighborhoods. The impact of the number of BIXI stations and the 
BIXI capacity in a 250 meter buffer need to be examined as a combination. At first glance, it 
might seem unintuitive that the impact of capacity is negative on BIXI usage. However, the 
result recognizes that as the number of stations increases we simultaneously increase the 
capacity. Hence, the estimates obtained are the overall effect of adding stations as well as 
capacity. In fact, the capacity variable is almost 25 times smaller than the positive impact 
associated with the number of BIXI stations, highlighting that adding more stations with capacity 
of 10-15 (the typical size in Montreal) is likely to increase BIXI usage more than adding a few 
large stations. The result provides an indication that adding stations with very large capacity is 
not as productive for arrivals and departures as adding smaller stations.  

 
5.3.4. Land Use and Built Environment Variables 
It is expected that the arrival and departure rates decrease when a BIXI station is located farther 
from the CBD. This is supported by the negative coefficient of the distance-to-the-CBD variable. 
BIXI users often combine their trip mode with the metro more than other modes of transport 
(Bachand-Marleau et al., 2012); this is also recognized by the positive impact of the presence of 
metro stations near BIXI stations in the results (similar results can be seen in Nair et al., 2013). 
In general, the number of restaurants in the vicinity of a BIXI station increases the usage of that 
station (similar to the findings of Wang et al., 2012, Hampshire et al., 2013). While the presence 
of this type of business has a negative impact on the departure rate of a BIXI station in the AM 
period, it intuitively has a positive influence in both arrival and departure rates in the PM period, 
reinforcing the attraction of bicycle-sharing systems for restaurant customers. The number of all 
other commercial enterprises in the 250 meter buffer of each station during PM and evening time 
periods is associated with negative impact. The coefficient associated with the presence of a 
university campus on a BIXI station’s arrival rate has, interestingly, the opposite sign in the AM 
and PM periods. BIXI stations near universities are more likely to experience a higher volume of 
bicycles arriving in the AM than in the PM. While for the departure rates model, the negative 
coefficient for the AM period has the similar explanation, the university variable does not have a 
significant influence in PM period. This is plausible since students and teachers tend to have 
more flexible schedules and usually do not have a fixed time for the end of a work day. The 
effect of population and job density are incorporated in both models at the TAZ level. BIXI 
stations in TAZs with higher population density tend to have higher arrival and departure rates 
(see Rixey, 2013; Wang et al, 2012, similar results). The opposite sign of job density in the AM 
and PM in the arrival rate models highlights the likely use of bicycle-sharing systems for daily 
work commute trips. 
 
5.4. Model Validation 
The model estimation results for arrival and departure rates were validated using data from May 
2013 (one year after the data used to fit the model). The bicycle availability data was compiled 
from minute-by-minute readings from the BIXI system for all the stations in May 2013. The 
same data compilation process described in sample preparation for model estimation (see section 
3) was repeated to compute bicycle arrival and departure rates. The model developed in section 
5.3 was used to generate predictions of bicycle arrivals and departures, and the predictions were 
compared with the observed values in the validation dataset. Specifically, we calculated two 
error metrics to evaluate model prediction performance: a) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and 



11 
 

b) Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, we computed the absolute error as a percentage of 
station capacity and examined the number of stations with less than 5% error, between 5 and 
10% error, between 10 and 15% error, between 15 and 20% error, between 20 and 25% error, 
greater than 25% error. These measures were computed for the entire sample as well as for 
specific time periods of the day. The validation exercise results are presented in Table 3. Overall, 
the predicted arrival and departure rates are reasonably close to the observed rates with absolute 
error of around 1.8 bicycles per hour. The results indicate that for about 90% of the records the 
error in prediction is within 20%. The fit for the arrival model is slightly better than the fit for the 
departure model. In terms of time of day, we can see that the performance of the model in the 
PM period is relatively inferior to the performance of the model for other time periods. However 
the results are satisfactory considering the larger rates of arrival and departure in the PM period. 
The validation highlight the predictive ability of the proposed framework to examine BIXI 
system bicycle flows (arrivals and departures). 

 
6. Policy Exercise 

 
To better illustrate the magnitude of effects of variables on the use of BIXI system we computed 
the elasticity effects for both arrival and departure models by computing the percentage change 
of arrival/departure rate due to changes to the exogenous variables.  

In this part, we focus on the following variables: 1) increasing the length of bicycle 
facilities by 10% in the 250 meter buffer; 2) increasing the number of stations in the buffer 
without increasing the capacity in the buffer, i.e., we reallocate capacity to add a new station; 3) 
increasing the station capacity by the average station size (19); and 4) increasing the number of 
restaurants by 50% of average number in the 250 meter buffer. The elasticity effects are 
computed as a percentage difference in arrivals and departures relative to the base case. The 
measures generated are presented in Table 4. 

The following observations can be made from the results presented. First, an increase in 
the bicycle infrastructure variables (length of bicycle facilities, stations and/or capacity) leads to 
an increase in usage of the bicycle-sharing system, as expected, since the presence of 
infrastructure plays a great role in cyclists’ decision to use such a system. These effects are 
marginally higher for departures than for arrivals. Second, and more strikingly, we see that 
increasing the number of stations without increasing capacity in the buffer has a greater impact 
than increasing capacity by as much as an average station. We believe that this result is quite 
useful for future BIXI system planning purposes and for other bicycle-sharing operators. The 
result clearly underscores the need to reallocate very large stations as smaller stations with lower 
capacity in multiple locations to increase BIXI system usage. Third, it is interesting to see that 
the bicycle infrastructure variables in the buffer have the most significant impact on arrival rates 
in the AM period and on departure rates in the Night period, while the effect of station capacity 
has a similar trend during the day for both arrivals and departures. Finally, we see that increasing 
the number of restaurants results in an increase of bicycle usage especially in the PM and 
Evening periods. This finding can be helpful when trying to understand the best areas to allocate 
new stations to ensure high usage. 
 
7. Conclusion 

 



12 
 

This study examined the factors influencing the usage flows of a bicycle-sharing system in 
Montreal, Canada. It contributes to the literature by capturing the effect of meteorological data, 
temporal characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use, and built environment attributes on 
bicycle arrival and departure flows at the station level, using data obtained from the BIXI 
system. The multilevel model estimation approach provides intuitive results for both arrival and 
departure rates. It is observed that people are more likely to use a bicycle-sharing system under 
good weather conditions. While during the weekends the bicycle usage reduces, Friday and 
Saturday nights are positively related to arrival and departure rates. The bicycle flows are 
expected to decrease when we go farther from CBD. The accessibility measures are plausibly 
correlated to bicycle usage for every station. Restaurants, other commercial enterprises, and 
universities in the vicinity of a station significantly influence the arrival and departure rates of 
the BIXI station. The BIXI system variables, number of stations and capacity, have an intricate 
relationship with arrivals and departures. Specifically, we observe that adding a BIXI station has 
a predominantly stronger impact on bicycle flows compared to increasing station capacity. 
Population density of a station’s TAZ positively affects the bicycle flows while the effect of the 
TAZ job density variable has an opposite sign in the AM and the PM. 

The model estimation results for arrival and departure rates were validated using the data 
from May 2013. Overall, the predicted arrival and departure rates are reasonably close to the 
observed rates with absolute error of around 1.8 bicycles per hour. Further, in almost 90% of the 
validation records, the error in prediction was less than 20% of the capacity of that station. 
Further, to examine the impact of exogenous variables on BIXI arrivals and departures, the 
impact of changes to exogenous variables is considered. The results provide interesting insights. 
The most prominent result from the exercise highlights the intricate relationship between the 
number of stations and bicycle capacity. The relationship suggests that adding additional stations 
(either by relocating existing capacity from large stations or adding new bicycle slots) is more 
beneficial in terms of arrival and departure flows compared to adding capacity to existing 
stations. The finding is very important for decision makers planning to install new BIXI stations 
in Montreal or for decision makers planning new bicycle sharing schemes in other cities.
