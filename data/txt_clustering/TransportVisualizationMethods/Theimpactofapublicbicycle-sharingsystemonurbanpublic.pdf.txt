As a healthy and environment-friendly trip mode, public bicycle-sharing systems, which have so
far been built in hundreds of cities around the world, have been developing rapidly recently. The
public bicycle-sharing systems, which are usually spatially embedded where original urban bus
transport networks are located, comprise the new urban public transport system together with
the bus transport networks. Therefore, studying the impact of the public bicycle-sharing systems
on the original urban public transport networks is an important research subject. In this study,
using the real spatial location data of the public bicycle-sharing systems of Hangzhou and Ningbo
in China, we propose a multi-layer coupling spatial network model that considers the geo-
graphical information on bus stations, bus routes, and public bicycle stations by studying the
urban public transport networks. The spatial network model consists of bus subnets, short-dis-
tance bicycle subnets, and short-distance walk subnets which are interdependent rather than
independent. We apply the model to study the influence of bicycling between the short-distance
bicycle station pairs (SDB) and walking between the short-distance bus station pairs (SDW) on
the performance of the urban public transport networks. Results show that SDB and SDW can
significantly reduce the average transfer times, the average path length of passengers’ trips and
the Gini coefficient of an urban public transport network. Therefore, the public bicycle-sharing
systems can decrease the average trip time of passengers and increase the efficiency of an urban
public transport network, as well as effectively improve the uneven level of traffic flow spatial
distribution of an urban public transport network and will be helpful to smoothening the traffic
flow and alleviating traffic congestion.

1. Introduction

The number of public bicycle-sharing systems, which are cheap, healthy, and environment-friendly trip modes, has been in-
creasing rapidly. Thus far, hundreds of cities around the world have built the public bicycle-sharing systems (DeMaio and Meddin,
2016). The implementation of the public bicycle-sharing systems is so flexible that it complements the original urban public transport
pattern, such as the bus and subway. A passenger can borrow a bicycle from an arbitrary self-help bicycle station and then return it to
another arbitrary station after the trip. Research on public bicycle-sharing systems’ performance and optimization methods have been

drawing increased attention at present. For example, de Chardon and Caruso (2015) estimated bike-share trips using station level
data. Gosse and Clarens (2014) based their estimation on sparse data in temporally and spatially continuous bicycle volumes. Winters
et al. (2013) proposed a method to find the most appropriate areas for a public bicycle-sharing system through statistics. Frade and
Ribeiro (2015) proposed a maximal covering location approach for a public bicycle-sharing system’s stations. Chen et al. (2015)
judged the number and locations of stations and optimized route options. Chow and Sayarshad (2014) proposed a framework which
is applied to formulate a symbiotic bike-sharing network design problem in the presence of a coexisting transit system as a departure-
time-elastic multicommodity flow problem. We also observe that, in the public transport networks with a public bicycle-sharing
system, passengers often achieve flexible transfer by way of short-distance walking. For example, de Jonge and Teunter (2013)
proposed optimizing itineraries in public transportation with walks between rides. Buehler and Hamre (2015) studied American
adults’ trip modes including driving, walking, bicycling, and public transportation.

A public bicycle-sharing system is usually embedded in the space of original bus public transport network and complements it to
form the new urban public transport system. An urban public transport network is a type of spatial network (Barthélemy, 2011; Silva
et al., 2015) that is one kind of complex networks with spatial characteristics. The networks are embedded in their specific spaces,
where every node and edge has its own spatial (geographical) position whose restriction plays an important role in the network
characteristic. In the real world, many networks related to geographical positions belong to spatial networks, such as the Internet
(Huang and Tang, 2015; Choi et al., 2015), power grid networks (Pei et al., 2015; Dewenter and Hartmann, 2015; Bai et al., 2016),
airline networks (Ryerson and Kim, 2013; Dobruszkes, 2013), and road networks (Austwick et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2014; Zheng
et al., 2015; Ruan et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2016). An urban public transport network is a kind of typical spatial networks because its
nodes and edges have spatial positions (Zhang et al., 2016; Louf et al., 2013). In addition, new public transport networks often consist
of the public bicycle-sharing system subnets, bus subnets, and subway subnets, which are interdependent rather than independent. So
they belong to typical coupling spatial networks (Yang et al., 2014; Morris and Barthelemy, 2012).

Studying the influence of a new public bicycle-sharing system on an urban public transport network is the topic of this paper. We
propose a new multi-layer coupling spatial network model that consists of bicycle subnets, walk subnets, and bus subnets to represent
the whole public transport system, where bus and bicycle-sharing stations have their geographical positions and edges are directed-
weighted (weight is the path length between two stations). We studied the features of urban public transport networks with public
bicycle-sharing systems on the basis of real public transport network data of Hangzhou and Ningbo in China. We discovered that
bicycling between short-distance bicycle station pairs (SDB) and walking between short-distance bus station pairs (SDW) can not only
significantly improve the performance of urban public transport networks but also smoothen traffic flow and alleviate traffic con-
gestion.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose the multi-layer coupling spatial network model of the urban public
transport system. In Section 3, we study the influence of SDB and SDW on the performance of an urban public transport network. In
Section 4, we describe the performance of an urban public transport network under the conditions of feasible major short-distance
bicycling and walking thresholds. In Section 5, we design a transfer algorithm on the basis of the proposed three-layer coupling
spatial network model. Finally, our conclusion and discussion are given in Section 6.

2. Three-layer coupling spatial network model of urban public transport systems

A public transport network is composed of stations and routes. In recent years, researcher often used the Space-L and Space-P
network models to study the network properties of urban public transport networks (Sen et al., 2002). In the Space-L network model,
a node represents a bus station, there is an edge between two bus stations when they are adjacent in one bus route. In the Space-P
network model, a node denotes a bus station, there exists an edge between two bus stations when they are contained in at least one
common bus route. The Space-L model reflects connection status of adjacent bus stations in a bus transport network, while the Space-
P model denotes the transfer topology and often is used to study the transfer feature of a bus transport network.

To represent the spatial geographic location factors of an urban public transport network, we extend the Space-L and Space-P
networks and propose two new models which are named as Spatial Space-L Network Model and Spatial Space-P Network Model. For

Fig. 1. (a) A public transport network consists of two bus routes. Different edge colors represent different bus routes, and arrows denotes the bus route directions. The
weights of edges represent the path length of bus routes (km). The red Station 4 represents the common station of the two bus routes. (b) represents Spatial Space-L
Network Model, and (c) represents Spatial Space-P Network Model.

example, Fig. 1(a) shows the original topology structure of an urban public transport network, Fig. 1(b) shows the directed-weighted
Spatial Space-L Network Model, Fig. 1(c) shows the directed-weighted Spatial Space-P Network Model. In the Spatial Space-L Net-
work Model and Spatial Space-P Network Model, a node represents a bus station with spatial geographic position information
(longitude and latitude), and a directed-weighted edge presents the corresponding bus route path between two nodes, namely, its
arrow direction reflects the route direction and its weight denotes the real path length .

The short-distance spatial walk network model, which is an undirected-weighted spatial network, is proposed to study the in-
fluence of SDW on an urban public transport network. In the Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network Model, nodes are bus stations with
spatial position information. Two bus stations are called a short-distance bus station pair when the path lenth between them is less
than short-distance walking threshold Tw that is the maximum distance of short-distance walking, e.g., 0.5 km. There exists an edge
between an arbitrary short-distance bus station pair whose weight is the path length between the two nodes. In a real an urban public
transport network, two nodes that are very near each other but are not in the same bus route can often be found, as illustrated by
nodes 3 and 5 (0.2 km away from each other) in Fig. 1(a). If a passenger wants to go to station 6 from station 1, he has to transfer at
station 4, which shares two bus routes. The bus route is 1-2-4-5-6 and the total distance is 7 km. However, stations 3 and 5 are only
0.2 km away; thus, the passenger can walk to station 5 from station 3 to achieve an different station transfer. The route of bus is 1-3-5-
6 and the distance is only 3.8 km, reducing the path length of the bus journey. Obviously, SDW can also reduce the transfer times for a
trip in a complex urban public transport network which is helpful to improving trip efficiency.

Recently, research on the actions of people using the public bicycle-sharing systems have indicated that most bicycle trips are of
short distances and short time[14] (e.g., within 1.5 km). Therefore, studying the influence of SDB on an urban public transport
networks is the topic of the current paper. We propose the Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model which is an undirected-
weighted spatial network. In Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model, nodes are bicycle stations with spatial position in-
formation. Two bicycle stations are called a short-distance bicycle station pair when the path length between them is less than short-
distance bicycling thresholdTb that is the maximum path length of short-distance bicycling, e.g., 2.0 km. There exists an edge between
arbitrary short-distance bicycle station pair whose weight is the path length between the two nodes.

In real public transport networks, there are only part of the bus stations near the bicycle stations, rather than there exist bicycle
stations nearby every bus station. For example, Table 1 shows that there are 3261 bus stations, while there are only 626 bicycle
stations in Ningbo. Namely, there are many bus stations without nearby bicycle stations. In this paper, we do not consider all bicycle-
sharing stations and only concentrate on those bicycle stations near bus stations because we think that bicycle stations which are
close to bus stations have greater influence on transfer performance of the whole public transport networks than those that are far
away from bus stops. In light of the real distribution data of Hangzhou and Ningbo, we define the combining threshold Cb of a bus
station and its nearby bicycle stations. People can arrive at bicycle (bus) station from bus (bicycle) station by walk within the
combining threshold Cb. The Cb is so short that we can ignore the walk cost within it. Specifically, the Cb represents the maximum
distance to combine a bus station and its adjacent bicycle stations, and all the bicycle stations within the scope of Cb around a
particular bus station should be combined, which means that people can transform conveniently between two trip modes of taking
bus and riding at the new combined station. The new combined station are both bus stations and bicycle stations, which simplifies the
complex real public transport networks and is beneficial to our study to expand. For example, In Fig. 2, the geographic locations of
bicycle stations B1, B2, and B3 near bus station S1, their geographic locations are all regarded as the S1 position. In the same way, the
geographic locations of bicycle stations B4, B5, and B6 near bus station S2 are all regarded as the S2 position. The path length
between the bicycle stations S1 and S2 is the shortest path length between them. Bicycling between short-distance bicycle station
pairs (SDB) can reduce the average bus transfer times and the trip length effectively. SDB has more influence on an urban public
transport network than SDW because the SDB distance threshold is greater than that of the SDW. As shown in Fig. 1(a)’s nodes 2 and 7
(1.5 km away from each other), if a passenger wants to go to station 2 from station 7, the bus route is 7-4-2 and the total path length is
2.5 km with one transfer at station 4. However, the trip between stations 7 and 2 are only 1.5 km away by bike, which has lower cost
because of free, less time and no transfer.

We think that the whole public transport system consists of the bus transport network layer, Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle
Network layer, and the Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network layer, whose nodes are all bus stations, and the nodes in the Short-
Distance Spatial Bicycle Network layer and the Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network layer are part of the nodes in the bus transport
network layer. People can transfer freely with the help of sharing stations between two arbitrary network layers via three transfer
patterns, namely, bus, bicycle, and walk. The three network layers affecting one another are coupled by sharing bus stations, building
the three-layer coupling spatial network model.

3. Influence of bicycling between the short-distance bicycle station pairs (SDB) and walking between the short-distance bus
station pairs (SDW) on the performance of an urban public transport network

In this section, the three-layer coupling spatial network model is applied in urban public transport networks to study the influence
of SDB and SDW on urban public transport networks based on the public transport system data (AMAP, 2016) of Hangzhou and
Ningbo in China. The basic public transport system data of Hangzhou and Ningbo are listed in Table 1, and the distributions of bus
routes and bicycle stations are shown in Fig. 3. In Hangzhou and Ningbo, the proportion of the number of bicycle stations within
300m of bus stations in the total number of bicycle stations is 85% and 83% respectively, namely, most bicycle stations are located
within 300m of the bus stations. So we set the value of Cb (the combining threshold of a bus station and its nearby bicycle stations) to
300m.

3.1. Influence of the short-distance bicycling thresholdTb and the short-distance walking thresholdTw on the average number of bus routes of a
trip in an urban public transport network

In our network model, Tb is the maximal path length of SDB and Tw is the maximal distance of SDW. The different values of Tb and
Tw make up the different scales of Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model and the Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network Model,
and thus have different influences on the performance of an urban public transport network. In an urban public transport network,
the number of bus routes from arbitrary node I to j is the number of bus routes of the shortest paths of this trip, the average number of
bus routes denotes the average number of bus routes between any two different stations, namely the transfer times of the trip plus 1,
which is an important indicator in evaluating the transfer performance of an urban public transport network. That is, in an urban
public transport network, low average number of bus routes means a passenger will has low average transfer times to finish a trip
between two arbitrary stations, namely, the lower the average number of bus routes the better the transfer performance of an urban
public transport network.

Fig. 4 presents three-dimensional relationship diagram of Tb, Tw, and the average number of bus routes. The scopes of thresholds
are ∈T [0.0,3.8]b and ∈T [0.0,1.0]w respectively. When =T 0b and =T 0w , the condition does not consider bicycling and walking, while

>T 0b and >T 0w considers otherwise. When the bicycling and walking thresholds are both zero, the average number of bus routes is
the highest. As the thresholds gradually increase, both of the average number of bus routes of the two cities present a declining trend,
where they decline sharply when Tb and Tw are small values and decrease slowly when Tb and Tw are big values. The result indicates
that, instead of the bigger the better, large values of Tb and Tw are less meaningful, which is in accordance with people’s trip habits
because people usually use bicycles and walk as trip modes within short distance rather than long distance.

Therefore, there should be a suitable threshold which we call feasible major threshold. Within the feasible major threshold, the
increments of Tb and Tw have obvious influence on the average number of bus routes of a trip; whereas outside the scope of the
threshold, the increments of Tb and Tw have little effect on the average number of bus routes of a trip.

The steps of solving the feasible major threshold are as follows.
To simplify the expression of equations, we define the following equivalent variable symbols: x is equivalent to Tb, y is equivalent

to Tw, z is equivalent to the average number of bus routes of a trip.

(1) Fitting the 3D curved surface in Fig. 4(a), we can get its function expression which can be supposed to be =f x y z( , , ) 0.
(2) At arbitrary point x y z( , , ) of the curved surface, using the fitting function =f x y z( , , ) 0 to obtain the tangent plane equation

=z tp x y( , ).
(3) Using the tangent plane equation =z tp x y( , ) to get the partial derivative ∂

∂

tp x y

( , ) and ∂

∂

tp x y

( , ) which indicate the change rates of z for
x and y respectively in the tangent plane. When both change rates are less than a certain fluctuation threshold τ , the change of x
and y have little impact on z, namely, the change ofTb andTw have little impact on the average number of bus routes of a trip. The
minimum values of Tb and Tw which satisfy above conditions are feasible major thresholds.

We set the fluctuation threshold =τ 0.4 (average number of bus routes of a trip/km) and get the feasible major thresholds as
=T 2.2 kmb and =T 0.5 kmw according to the above three steps.

3.2. Influence of the short-distance bicycling threshold Tb and the short-distance walking threshold Tw on the average path length of an urban
public transport network

In an urban public transport network, the path length between two random nodes i and j is the shortest path length between them.
In the three-layer coupling spatial network model of an urban public transport network, a transfer may occur between arbitrary two
of three network layers during a trip from random node i to j. Therefore, the path length is the sum of all the lengths of paths that pass
through the whole network layers. For example, if a passenger starts from bus station i to j, whose trip consists of bus routes’ length of
bus trip Lbus, SDB path length Lbike, and SDW distance Lwalk, then the path length of the trip is + +L L Lbus bike walk. The average path
length is the average value of the path lengths among all station pairs.

Fig. 5 presents 3D relationship diagram of Tb, Tw, and the average path length. The scopes of thresholds are ∈T [0.0,3.8]b and
∈T [0.0,1.0]w respectively. When =T 0b and =T 0w , the condition does not consider bicycling and walking, while >T 0b and >T 0w

consider otherwise. As =T 0b and =T 0w , the average path length is the highest. As the thresholds gradually increase, both of the
average path lengths of the two cities present a declining trend, where they decline sharply when Tb and Tw are small values and

decrease slowly when Tb and Tw are big values. The result indicates that instead of the bigger the better, large values of Tb and Tw are
less meaningful, in accordance with people’s trip habits. From the Fig. 5, according to the steps in Section 3.1 of this paper, we get the
feasible major thresholds are =T 2 kmb and =T 0.5 kmw respectively. The feasible major threshold value of Tb of Fig. 5 is different
from that of Fig. 4, but we can see that the two figures have similar evolutionary trend.

Fig. 5 also shows that SDB and SDW can significantly reduce the average path length in an urban public transport network.
Considering bicycling and walking are both short-distance, in fact the average bus path length of a trip is also drastically reduced, that
is, the same departure frequency bus can load more passengers or the lower departure frequency bus can carry the same number of
passengers, which would increase the operation efficiency of an urban public transport network, reduce fuel consumption, improve
the efficiency of whole city road networks.

3.3. Influence of short-distance bicycling the thresholdTb and the short-distance walking thresholdTw on the Gini coefficient of an urban public
transport network

The initial definition of the Gini coefficient is as an analysis index used in economics to inspect the income difference of residents
in a country. Reference Morris and Barthelemy (2012) applies the principle of the Gini coefficient in networks with the betweenness
centrality to describe the edges’ flow distribution in a complex network. In the present paper, we use the Gini coefficient in an urban
public transport network to describe the traffic flow allocation of edges. The definition of Gini coefficient is

∑ ∑= −G
E x

x x
1

2
| |

p q
p q2

(1)

where subscripts p and q are edges in a network, E represents the total number of edges, xp indicates the betweenness centrality of
edge p, that is, the number of shortest paths that pass this edge, and = ∑x x E/p p is the average flow of all the edges. ∈G [0,1]. The
Gini coefficient can describe the smoothness of the flow distribution of edges in the urban public transport network. When network
flows are distributed unevenly, they centralize a few edges and the flows of the other edges are less; thus, the value of G is relatively
big. Otherwise, the flow difference between edges is not large, and the value of G is relatively small. For example, a Gini coefficient of
one indicates that all flows only pass one edge; a zero coefficient indicates that the traffic flow is allocated at every edge homo-
geneously.

In the three-layer coupling spatial network model, we assume that the flow of every edge in three network layer is zero at first. For
a path between random nodes i and j, the flow of an edge in every network layer passing through the shortest path between i and j
plus one. We compute all shortest paths between every node pairs. Then we get the flow of every edge. According to formula (1), we
can obtain the Gini coefficient. In particular, we only use the flow of edges of bus network layer in Spatial Space-L Network Model to
compute the Gini coefficient of an urban public transport network.

Fig. 6 presents the 3D relationship diagram of Tb, Tw and the Gini coefficient of the urban public transport networks in Hangzhou
and Ningbo, where ∈T [0.0,3.8]b and ∈T [0.0,1.0]w , respectively. When =T 0b and =T 0w , the Gini coefficients are the highest. As Tb
and Tw gradually increase, the Gini coefficients of the two cities show declining trends, where Gini coefficients decline sharply when
Tb and Tw are small values, Gini coefficients decrease slowly when Tb and Tw are big values. The result indicates that, instead of the

bigger the better, large values of Tb and Tw are less meaningful. From Fig. 6, according to the steps in Section 3.1 of this paper, we get
the feasible major thresholds =T 2.2 kmb , =T 0.5 kmw .

From Fig. 6, we can see the Gini coefficients decline with the increasement of Tb and Tw, which means that SDB and SDW can
effectively improve the uneven level of flow distribution of an urban public transport network, so they will be helpful to smoothening
the traffic flow and alleviating traffic jams.

4. Analysis of property and performance of an urban public transport network on the feasible major thresholds of short-
distance bicycling and walking

We got the feasible major short-distance bicycling threshold Tb and walking threshold Tw of Figs. 4–6 respectively in the last
section. We use the maximum value of them as the feasible major thresholds, namely, =T 2.2 kmb and =T 0.5 kmw . In this section, the
properties and performance of an urban public transport network on the feasible major bicycling and walking thresholds are analyzed
to study the influence of SDB and SDW on an urban public transport network.

4.1. Degree distribution

The degree of a node in the network is the number of edges connected to the node directly. Degree distribution, which describes
the distribution sequence of a network degree, plays an important role in evaluating network performance. We analyze the degree
distributions of Spatial Space-L Network Model, Spatial Space-P Network Model, Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model, and
Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network Model. The network is processed using the smooth method in actual condition to eliminate
errors from the noise disturbance, that is, by drawing its cumulative degree distribution Pk, which is the proportion of nodes whose
degrees are not less than k in the whole network, as shown below:

∑= ′
′=

∞

P P k( )k
k k (2)

Specifically, the degree distributions of the Spatial Space-L Network Model and the Spatial Space-P Network Model are re-
presented by the semi-log form. However, the Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model and Short-Distance Spatial Walk
Network Models are represented by the degree distribution form. They are shown in Fig. 7.

In Fig. 7(a) and (b), we can see that most of the data fall on linear lines on the single-logarithmic plane, which means the
cumulative distributions of Spatial Space-L Network Model and Spatial Space-P Network Model in two figures can be presented as two
exponential functions [form ∼ −p x e( ) αx ] respectively, indicating that an urban public transport network is a kind of growth network
with random attachment mechanism (Barabási and Albert, 1999). In Fig. 7(c), the cumulative degree distribution of the Short-
Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model is similar to the uniform distribution [form ∼ +p x kx b( ) ]. Because each edge’s length is less
than Tb [the maximal path length of SDB (bicycling between the short-distance bicycle station pairs)], the Short-Distance Spatial
Bicycle Network Model is a kind of spatial distributed set of networks with short edges. The reason for the uniform distributions is
that, for the Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model, its degree distribution accords with random distribution, namely, bicycle

stations with many neighbor nodes is less, and the number of neighbor nodes of most stations satisfies even distribution. In Fig. 7(d),
the degree distribution of the Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network Model is similar to the Gaussian distribution [form

∼ − −p x e( ) x μ σ(( )/ )2]. These results show that Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network Model and Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network
Model are both random networks whose degree distributions are random distributions without preference.

4.2. Edge length distribution

The edge length in the urban public transport network model is the actual path length (including bus, bicycle and walk path
length) of a trip between arbitrary two stations, which plays an important role in the computation of the bus trip cost and transfer
scheme. Fig. 8 shows the edge length distributions of Spatial Space-L Network Model, Spatial Space-P Network Model, Short-Distance
Spatial Bicycle Network Model, and Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network Model, where the Spatial Space-L Network Model and
Spatial Space-P Network Model are represented by cumulative length distribution.

As shown in Fig. 8(a), the cumulative edge length distributions of the Spatial Space-L Network Models resemble the power-law
distribution [form ∼ −p x x( ) β], which indicates that the setting distance between the two adjacent stations prefers short distances
rather than few stations that are far away from each other. In Fig. 8(b), the cumulative edge length distributions of the Spatial Space-
P Network Model resemble the exponential distribution [form ∼ −p x e( ) αx], which indicates that the total setting path length between
two stations has no specific preference based on random demand. The edge length distributions of Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle
Network Model and Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network Model also resemble the linear distribution [form ∼p x γx( ) ]. The dis-
tributions show that bicycling and walking networks have similar edge characteristics, that is, network edge length is proportional to
the network scale i.e., the larger the network scale, the higher the probability of long edges.

4.3. Transfer performance

The average number of bus routes of a trip and the average path length of an urban public transport network are two important
indicators in evaluating the transfer performance of an urban public transport network. We calculate the average number of bus
routes and the average path length of the two cities and list them in Table 2.

Table 2 indicates that SDB and SDW cause the sharp decrease of the average number of bus routes of urban public transport
networks, which reduces Hangzhou to 58% and Ningbo to 66%, the sharp decrease of the average path length that reduce Hangzhou
to 40% and Ningbo to 49%. Passengers will spend less time and path length on a trip with the bicycle and walk pattern. So the
transfer performance was clearly improved.

4.4. Bus average path length distribution

A bus path length of a trip is the marched route length of a passenger taking the bus between two random nodes i and j without
including the bicycling and walking path lengths. The bus average path length (km) is the average value of bus path lengths among all
station node pairs.

Fig. 9 shows the bus average path length distribution considering and without considering the SDB and SDW. We can see that the
bus average path length considering the SDB and SDW is located below the bus average path length curves without considering the
SDB and SDW. This result indicates that SDB and SDW can effectively reduce the bus average path length so that loading the same
number of passengers only need buses with less departure frequency. It is beneficial to the improvement of the operating efficiency of
an urban public transport network and the reduction of fuel consumption.

5. An application of the three-layer coupling spatial network model: transfer algorithm design

A new improved public transport network transfer algorithm based on the three-layer coupling spatial network model is designed
in the light of the Dijkstra algorithm. The new algorithm can find the transfer route of the minimum travel cost between arbitrary two
stations in the proposed three-layer weighted directed network, which can be use to plan passengers’ travel route.

Assuming there is a transfer route P in which the transfer times is T , the distances of taking bus, bicycling and walking are s1, s2,
and s3 respectively. The average speeds of taking bus, bicycling and walking areν1, ν2 and ν3 respectively.

The transfer cost function of transfer route P is defined as

= + + +CT P T αs βs γs( ) 2 1 2 3 (3)

where = = =α ν β ν γ ν1/(2 ), 1/(2 ), 1/(2 )1 2 3 . Here we use empirical data: =ν 20,000 m/h1 , =ν 1250 m/h2 , =ν 5000 m/h3 , and corre-
spondingly =α 0.000025, =β 0.00004, =γ 0.001.

On the basis of the cost function, taking an example of a node v0, let Phs be the set of the optimal paths of v0 to all other nodes. The
new algorithm is detailed as follows.

(1) Initialization: Let ν0 be the initial node, and add v0 into the Phs, namely, Phs ={ v0}. Initialize a stack H to store nodes, and add
the initial node v0 into H at first. Then define a data structure →ν CT ν ν( , ( ))i i 0 where νi represents the node which has been
searched and →CT ν ν( )i 0 is the value of the cost function traveling from νi to ν0. Let seen be the set of →ν CT ν ν( , ( ))i i 0 , and its
initial value be {(ν0, 0)}. If the initial state node ν0 is not connected with other nodes, it is defined as → = ∞CT ν ν( )j 0 .
Meanwhile, initialize arrays of T , S1, S2, and S3 whose sizes are the numbers of nodes in the whole network, in which the index of
the array corresponds to the numbers of nodes. Set initial values in the array of T are −1, and all values inS1, S2 and S3 are 0.

(2) Pop the top node in the stack H, which is defined as v. Traverse all neighbors of the node v in Spatial Space-L Network, Spatial
Space-P Network, Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network and Short-Distance Spatial Bicycle Network, respectively, and then store
them into the variable array N.

(3) After getting a node w in array N, judge whether the node v and node w exist an edge in Spatial Space-L Network or Spatial Space-
P Network at first. If edges exist, add 1 at T [w], record the distance between v and w in S1 [w] and calculate the value of trip cost
CP based on the formula (3). Secondly, judge whether the node v and node w exist an edge in Short-Distance Spatial bicycle

Network. If edges exist, record the distance between v and w in S2 [w] and calculate the cost value. In a similar way, judge
whether the node v and node w exist an edge in Short-Distance Spatial Walk Network. If edges exist, get the distance and the cost
value in S3 at last. After calculating values of the trip cost CP of four networks above respectively, namely, the minimum value of
CP, judge whether w exists in seen. If it doesn’t exist in the array seen, add it in seen and Phs and push w in stack H. Otherwise if w
existed in seen and the calculated value of CP is less than the corresponding recorded value in seen, update the node and its value
of CP in seen and Phs, mark the specific type of trip mode (by bus, by bicycle or walking) and update values in arrays of T , S1, S2
and S3.

(4) Acquire the next node in N, repeat the step (3) until traverse all nodes in N. Then we get next node of v with the minimum cost.
(5) Repeat the step (2) until the stack H is empty. We get the Phs which is the set of optimal routes from ν0 to all other nodes.

6. Conclusion and discussion

In this paper, according to the actual spatial location data of the public bicycle-sharing systems of two cities in China, we propose
a multi-layer coupling spatial network model that considers the spatial geographic location information of bus stations, bus routes,
and bicycle stations to study the influence of the public bicycle-sharing systems on an urban public transport network, with special
concentration on the influence of SDB and SDW. We find that SDB and SDW can reduce the number of transfer times and the travel
time of passengers’ trip effectively, improving the operation efficiency. Therefore the public bicycle-sharing systems can smoothen
the traffic flow, alleviate traffic jams, save energy and protect the environment.

A public bicycle-sharing system that is usually embedded in the original space of a bus transport network composes the new urban
public transport system together with the bus transport network. Configuring the optimal number and location of bicycle stations in a
public bicycle-sharing system and achieving the optimal performance with minimum cost of deploying a public bicycle-sharing
system in an urban public transport network will be our future major subject.
