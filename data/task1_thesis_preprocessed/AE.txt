Abstract 

 

Antibiotic (AB) Resistance is an increasing global problem for public health, with multi-resistant 

bacteria persisting and spreading not only in clinical settings but also in the environment.  The 

Wellcome Trust estimated 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050 due to AB resistant pathogenic 

bacteria. One of the possible vectors of this spread is the use and re-use of waste water (WW), 

manure and sludge from WW treatment plants (WWTPs) in different agriculture practices 

(irrigation, soil amendment). These practices are becoming widespread worldwide, especially 

in regions with scarcity of water. WWTPs are known as AB resistance hotspots, whereas soil 

amendment by organic fertilization is known to increase AB resistance in the soil microbiomes. 

Hence, there is a growing concern about the possible transmission of AB resistance from 

agricultural soils to crops and, ultimately, to the microbiomes of consumers' guts.  

 

Studies about the uptake of AB Resistant Bacteria (ARB) and Antibiotic Resistant Genes 

(ARGs) have been mainly limited to soil and root studies. Therefore, research regarding the 

spread of ARBs and ARGs into the environment and their transmission into the food chain is 

of the utmost importance. Currently, there are no studies addressing the impact of irrigation 

water quality and soil amendment in the ARGs and microbiomes along the soil-plant-food 

continuum. In this Thesis, the latter issue was assessed in commercial fields producing 

vegetable crops. This strategy allowed us to analyze AB resistance elements in foodstuffs 

actually reaching the consumers, and to be able to predict the potential risk for consumers, 

due to the entering of ARGs into the food-chain.  Moreover, this Thesis tackles the alterations 

in soil, plant and crops bacterial communities due to several agricultural practices, and the 

association of taxa with the ARGs and intI1, an anthropogenic pollution marker. To achieve 

this goal, five agricultural fields located in the area of Barcelona (NE Spain) were selected, 

under different irrigation regimes and soil amendment. The selected crops were lettuce, 

tomatoes, and broad beans, as they represent vegetables with different edible parts, 

commonly eaten either raw or cooked. 

 

The Thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter I describes the state of the art of the studies 

of ABR in food and agricultural fields and presents the objectives of the PhD project. Chapter 

II and III assess the distribution of ARGs and microbiomes along the soil-plant continuum in 

Lycopersicum esculentum and Vicia faba in peri-urban and rural agricultural fields under 

different irrigation regimes and soil amendments. Our data show that field practices influenced 



X 

 

the distribution of ARGs and intI1 along the soil-plant continuum in both cases, although the 

impact on soil and plant microbiomes differed between the two crops. In tomatoes, few 

abundant bacterial families discriminated the different agricultural fields, including 

Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. The predominance of Pseudomonadaceae 

correlated positively with the levels of intI1, blaTEM, blaOXA-58 and sul1 detected in the fruits. In 

contrast, microbiomes from broad bean plant organs (beans, leaves, roots) were dominated 

by Rhizobiales, whose predominance inversely correlated with intl1 and ARGs abundances. 

We concluded that Rhizobiales limits the translocation of ARGs into the crops, as well as the 

colonization of roots and plant parts by other bacteria. Chapter IV integrates the data from the 

distribution and abundance of the ARGs in different model crops (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Batavia, 

Vicia faba L., Lycopersicon esculentum Mill). The crops were grown in three peri-urban and 

two rural agricultural fields. ARGs were detected in all plant compartments, with highest loads 

in roots and lowest in fruits or beans. ARGs profiles within the crops reflect the soil ARG 

composition. The statistical analyses also showed positive correlations between certain soil 

taxa and ARG profiles. The crop type revealed to be determinant for both ARG distribution and 

microbiome composition. Irrigation water appeared to have a limited influence, suggesting that 

the soil amendment practices were determinants on ARG distribution and on their abundance 

in edible crop parts. Chapter V presents a general discussion of the results showed previously, 

followed in Chapter VI including the main conclusions of the Thesis.

Resumen 

 

La resistencia bacteriana a los antibióticos (AB) es un problema mundial cada vez mayor para 

la salud pública, con bacterias multirresistentes que persisten y se propagan no solo en 

entornos clínicos sino también en el medio ambiente. Wellcome Trust estimó en 10 millones 

las muertes en todo el mundo hasta 2050 debidas a bacterias patógenas resistentes a AB. 

Uno de los posibles vectores de esta propagación es el uso y la reutilización de aguas 

residuales (AR) y de estiércol y lodos de plantas depuradoras (EDAR) en diferentes prácticas 

agrícolas (riego, enmienda del suelo). Estas prácticas se están generalizando en todo el 

mundo, especialmente en regiones con escasez de agua. Las EDAR se conocen como puntos 

calientes de generación de resistencia a los AB, mientras que la enmienda del suelo mediante 

fertilización orgánica aumenta la resistencia a los AB en los microbiomas del suelo. Por lo 

tanto, existe una creciente preocupación por la posible transmisión de la resistencia AB de 

los suelos agrícolas y a los cultivos y, en última instancia, a los microbiomas del intestino de 

los consumidores. 

 

Los estudios sobre la absorción de bacterias resistentes a AB (ARB) y genes resistentes a 

antibióticos (ARG) se han limitado principalmente a estudios de suelo y raíces. Por lo tanto, 

la investigación sobre la propagación de ARB y ARG en el medio ambiente y su transmisión 

a la cadena alimentaria es de suma importancia. Actualmente, no hay estudios que aborden 

el impacto de la calidad del agua de riego y la enmienda del suelo en los ARG y los 

microbiomas a lo largo del continuo suelo-planta-alimento. Este tema se ha evaluado en esta  

Tesis partiendo de parcelas comerciales de productores de hortalizas para consumo humano. 

Esta estrategia nos permitió analizar los elementos de resistencia a los AB en los alimentos 

que llegan a los consumidores, y comprender el riesgo que plantea su consumo debido a la 

entrada de ARG en la cadena alimentaria. Además, esta Tesis aborda las alteraciones en las 

comunidades bacterianas del suelo, de las plantas y de los cultivos comerciales debidas a 

estas prácticas agrícolas, así como la asociación de diferentes taxones bacterianos con los 

ARG e intI1, un marcador de contaminación antropogénico. Para lograr esto, se seleccionaron 

cinco zonas producticvas ubicadas en el área de Barcelona (NE España), bajo diferentes 

regímenes de riego y enmienda del suelo. Los cultivos seleccionados fueron lechugas, 

tomates y habas, ya que representan vegetales con diferentes partes comestibles, que 

comúnmente se comen tanto crudos como cocidos. 

 



XII 

 

La Tesis se divide en seis capítulos. El Capítulo I describe el conocimiento actual sobre la 

presencia de ARB en campos agrícolas y productos alimentarios y presenta los objetivos del 

proyecto de tesis doctoral. Los capítulos II y III evalúan la distribución de ARG y microbiomas 

a lo largo del continuo suelo-planta en Lycopersicum esculentum y Vicia faba, cultivadas en 

campos agrícolas periurbanos y rurales bajo diferentes regímenes de riego y manejo 

agronómico. Nuestros datos muestran que las prácticas de campo influyeron en la distribución 

de ARG e intI1 a lo largo del continuo suelo-planta en ambos casos, aunque el impacto en el 

suelo y los microbiomas de las plantas difirió entre los dos cultivos. En los tomates, pocas 

familias bacterianas abundantes discriminaron los diferentes campos agrícolas, incluidas 

Pseudomonadaceae y Enterobacteriaceae. El predominio de Pseudomonadacea se 

correlacionó positivamente con los niveles de intI1, blaTEM, blaOXA-58 y sul1 detectados en las 

frutas. En contraste, los microbiomas de los órganos de la planta de haba (habas, hojas, 

raíces) estuvieron dominados por Rhizobiales, cuyo predominio se correlacionó inversamente 

con las abundancias intl1 y ARG. Llegamos a la conclusión de que Rhizobiales limita la 

translocación de ARG en los cultivos, así como la colonización de raíces y partes de plantas 

por otras bacterias. El Capítulo IV integra los datos de la distribución y abundancia de los 

ARG en diferentes cultivos modelo (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Batavia, Vicia faba L., Lycopersicon 

esculentum Mill). Los cultivos se obtuvieron de tres parcelas agrícolas periurbanas y dos 

rurales. Los resultados obtenidos de los diferentes suelos y cultivos mostraron que se 

detectaron ARG en todos los compartimentos de las plantas, con cargas más altas de ARG 

en las raíces y más bajas en frutas o habas. Los perfiles de ARG dentro de los cultivos reflejan 

la composición de los del suelo, y los análisis estadísticos también mostraron correlaciones 

positivas entre ciertos taxones bacterianos del suelo y los perfiles de ARG. El tipo de cultivo 

se reveló como factor determinante tanto para la distribución de ARG como para la 

composición del microbioma. El agua de riego parece tener una influencia limitada, lo que 

sugiere que las prácticas de enmienda del suelo fueron determinantes en la distribución de 

ARG y en su abundancia en las partes comestibles del cultivo. El Capítulo V presenta una 

discusión general de los resultados obtenidos anteriormente, seguidos del Capítulo VI que 

incluyen las principales conclusiones de la Tesis Doctoral.

Motivation and Thesis outline 

 

Motivation 

 

Antibiotic Resistance is an increasing problem all over the world. Many reports confirmed 

the persistence and spreading of AB multi-resistant bacterial strains not only in clinical 

settings but also in the environment, a phenomenon that has a potential to become a 

future global crisis. The “golden era” of AB development, when many new ABs were 

discovered in matter of years, is long gone, further contributing to fuel the crisis of 

antimicrobial resistance. The actual scarcity of new ABs is due both to the low probability 

of pharmaceutical industry making a substantial return from the investment, and to the 

financial costs of their development to fulfill current regulatory requirements. The misuse 

of ABs either for human or veterinary uses accentuates the AR problem.  

 

Studies across clinical settings and environment and agriculture/livestock sectors to 

understand the spread of ARB and ARGs in the food chain requires a multidisciplinary 

effort. The MSCA-ITN "Antibiotics and mobile resistance elements in wastewater reuse 

applications: risks and innovative solutions: ANSWER” aims to apply state-of-the-art 

knowledge in the fields of Chemistry, Biology, and Civil Engineering to study the spread 

of ABs, ARGs, and ARBs from the WWTPs to the edible part of crops, along with the 

development of new technologies to remove more efficiently those agents from the 

WWTP effluents. 

 

The topic and goals of this study are very relevant both scientifically and socially. There 

is an urgent need to increase our understanding about the potential dissemination of 

ARG in the environment, and little is known yet of whether farming practices increase 

ARG in edible parts. The uptake of these ARBs and ARGs occur through the food chain, 

when humans later consume these plants. Over the past few years, great advances have 

been done, to develop high-throughput sequencing methods with increased outputs of 

data per instrument run at lower costs. These techniques  allowed the study of microbial 

ecology to new levels, by a combination of meta-barcoding sequencing (Dormontt et al., 

2018; Hebert et al., 2003) and large-scale metagenomics (Handelsman, 2004; Tringe, 

2005). Meta-barcoding consists in using specific DNA sequences for identification of the 

different organisms present in complex samples (Dormontt et al., 2018). Metagenomics 

goes one step farther, aiming to know the habitat-specific gene fingerprints of sampled 

environments, by sequencing the total DNA in collected  samples (Tringe, 2005). The 



 

20  

innovative combination of molecular biology methods with next-generation sequencing 

technologies allows the study of the microbiomes and how they modulate the ARGs 

prevalence and persistence in the environment. We wanted to understand the influence 

of the use of treated wastewater (TWW) and of other agricultural practices in the uptake 

of ARGs along the soil-plant continuum. The final aim is to characterize the interactions 

between agricultural practices, water quality, and food safety.

Thesis outline 

 

Chapter I provides the state-of-the-art knowledge related to the antibiotic resistance 

spread in the environment, and its risks for the food-chain. The study characterizes the 

sources of ABs, ARGs and ARBs, including agricultural fields, the influence of certain 

agricultural practices in the microbiomes and ARGs, and ARBs transmission along the 

soil-plant continuum. Moreover, we explore the relationship between Horizontal Gene 

Transfer (HGT), bacterial Ecology and Phylogeny. Finally, this Chapter includes the 

hypotheses and the objectives of the Thesis.  

 

Chapter II describes the distribution of several clinically relevant ARGs (sul1, blaTEM, 

blaCTX-M-32, mecA, qnrS1, tetM, blaOXA-58), intI1 and 16s rDNA in L. esculentum peri-urban 

and rural agricultural fields. Samples were collected to have a survey of the soil plant 

continuum (soil, roots, leaves, fruits). Bacterial communities were analysed by next-

generation sequencing, and the potential relationships were studied by bioinformatics 

and statistical analysis. 

This Chapter is based on the paper: Francisco Cerqueira, Víctor Matamoros, Josep 

Bayona, Benjamin Piña. (2019). Antibiotic resistance genes distribution in microbiomes 

from the soil-plant-fruit continuum in commercial Lycopersicon esculentum fields under 

different agricultural practices. Science of the Total Enviroment, 652, 660-670. 

 

Chapter III studies the distribution of selected ARGs (sul1, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, mecA, 

qnrS1, tetM, blaOXA-58), and intI, and their association with specific taxa along the soil 

plant continuum in legume plants (V. faba L.) grown under different agricultural practices. 

In addition, it includes the classification of the agricultural regimes by applying a machine 

learning model.   

This Chapter is based on the paper: Francisco Cerqueira, Víctor Matamoros, Josep 

Bayona, Goffe Elsinga, Luc M. Hornstra, Benjamin Piña. (2019).  Distribution of antibiotic 

resistance genes in soils and crops. A field study in legume plants (V. faba L.) grown

Chapter I: Introduction 

 

1.1. AB resistance world-wide 

 

Antibiotics have helped to save innumerable lives, and helped to increase life 

expectancy, since  diseases such as diphtheria, pneumonia, typhoid fever, plaque, 

tuberculosis, typhus, syphilis, were a major cause of death until their use become 

globally widespread (Piddock, 2012; https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-

expectancy.htm). 

 

Penicillin was discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928 and became the first AB 

medically used (Piddock, 2012). It started to be prescribed to treat infections in the 

1940s, and just in the 1950s the first signs of resistance to the penicillin treatments 

started to arise. Over the decades, new AB were discovered, such as vancomycin, 

tetracyclines, etc., but soon bacteria started to resist treatments with the newly 

discovered ABs as well. 

 

AB resistance is becoming a global threat in the near future, due to multi-resistant 

bacteria becoming widespread. Cases of bacterial strains resistant to most or even all 

known ABs (also known as pan-drug resistance) have been identified for different 

pathogenic species, like Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Suay-García and Pérez-Gracia, 2018), 

Klebsiella pneumoniae (Krapp et al., 2018), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Fernandes 

et al., 2016). The number of deaths due to the AB resistance is increasing, with recent 

estimations of 23,000 and 25,000 annual deaths caused by ARB in the United States of 

America and in the European Union, respectively 

(https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/,(Piddock, 2012))⁠. The numbers of deaths are 

predicted to keep raising and there is an estimate of 10 million deaths annually by 2050 

(O’Neill, 2016). 

 

The complex relationship between environmental and human settings and their 

interactions, show the potential of serious public health problem due to ARB and ARGs 

spread (https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/en/). The high concentrations of 

ABs used to treat infections and the subsequent high selective pressure (Almagor et al., 

2018; Oz et al., 2014) made the clinical settings prone to fast emergence of resistant and 

multi-resistant bacteria. ABs are over-used outside controlled clinical settings, possibly 

leading to an increased selective pressure also for ARBs resistance reservoirs such as

WWTPs and soils (Lüneberg et al., 2018; Michael et al., 2013). They This may lead to 

incorporation of ARB and ARGs in the food-chain (Berendonk et al., 2015). 

 

1.2. Resistance Mechanisms 

  

Resistance to ABs is an ancient, natural occurring phenomenon (D’Costa et al., 2011; 

Peterson and Kaur, 2018). Production of ABs results from processes of co-evolution. 

Bacteria compete with their neighbours in their habitat for the limited space and 

resources. It represents one of many strategies to gain competitive advantage over 

competitors (Hibbing et al., 2010). 

 

Two classic examples of inter-species competition are the scramble competition and the 

contest competition. The former involves the fast usage of a limiting resource (Nicholson, 

1954; Rozpędowska et al., 2011). Contest competition refers to the direct removal of 

other competitors (Nicholson, 1954). ABs production relates to the latter strategy. The 

spectrum of the ABs synthesized by a bacterial species is related to their specialization. 

A species capable of thriving in a wide variety of habitats may synthesize either multiple 

ABs or broad-spectrum ABs, therefore, enabling it to deal with a diverse group of 

competitors. Streptomyces spp.  of the Actinobacteria Phylum are a good example (de 

Lima Procópio et al., 2012). In contrast, species adapted to a specific environment would 

probably only target a specific competitor (Hibbing et al., 2010). 

 

Antibiotic resistance can be classified as either intrinsic or acquired, depending on 

whether or not the mechanism involves a genetic change. Intrinsic resistance refers to a 

generalizable trait that does not change regardless of antibiotic selective pressure 

(Culyba et al., 2015).  By contrast, the acquired resistance develops when a new trait is 

expressed, often because of a genetic change that has been selected due to antibiotic 

exposure (van Hoek et al., 2011).  

 

Several mechanisms are known to give resistance to ABs. The resistance may come by 

affecting the ABs molecules, modifying them, or inactivating/degrading them (Munita and 

Arias, 2016). The latter is illustrated by the action of β-lactamases, which hydrolyse the 

amide bond of the β-lactam ring (Munita and Arias, 2016), which is essential for β-lactam 

ABs. This is the mechanism of action TEM (Bush, 2013), OXA (Evans and Amyes, 2014) 

and CTX (Bonnet, 2004) β-lactamases. Resistance is also gained by altering the 



 

25  

permeability of the Gram negative outer membrane (Delcour, 2009). It can be 

accomplished by changes in the sequences of the expressed porins, or in their 

expression levels (Munita and Arias, 2016; Nikaido, 2003). 

 

Efflux-pumps provide a way to extrude ABs from the cell cytoplasm (Du et al., 2018). 

They can be very specific for a given type of substrate, like the Tet efflux pumps (Kumar 

and Varela, 2012), or to have a wide variety of substrates to act on. There are five main 

families (Du et al., 2018) of unspecific target efflux pumps: the major facilitator 

superfamily (MFS) (Pao et al., 1998), the small multidrug resistance family (SMR) (Bay 

et al., 2008), the resistance-nodulation-cell-division family (RND) (Tseng et al., 1999), 

the ATP-binding cassette family (ABC) (Fath and Kolter, 1993), and  the multidrug and 

toxic compound extrusion family (MATE) (Pallen, 1999). They are present in gram-

positive and gram-negative bacteria, except the RND family, which is only present in 

gram-negative bacteria, and they typically confer multi-drug resistance. 

 

Bacteria can protect, change, replace, or bypass of the target sites to make certain ABs 

inefficient. For example, the tetM gene encodes a protein that competes with tetracycline 

for the same ribosomal space and it alters the geometry of the binding site (Li et al., 

2013). The QnrS1 protein competes with quinolones for the DNA binding site of the DNA 

gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Quinolone targets are DNA gyrase in gram-negative 

bacteria and topoisomerase IV in gram-positive ones (Rodríguez-Martínez et al., 2011). 

By binding to the DNA it decreases the opportunities of the quinolones to form and 

stabilize the gyrase-cleaved DNA-quinolone complex (Rodríguez-Martínez et al., 2011). 

The replacement or bypass of the target site happens when the bacteria synthetises new 

targets that accomplish similar functions to the AB intended target, but that are not 

affected by the AB. Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus aureus is conferred by 

the acquisition of the mecA gene, which codifies the Penicillin Binding Protein PBP2a. 

This protein has low affinity for all β-lactam ABs, including penicillin, cephalosporins, and 

carbapenem. It has the same function of the PBPs produced by S. aureus, carrying the 

transpeptidation and transglycosylation of the peptidoglycan (Chambers and DeLeo, 

2009).

1.3. ARGs transmission 

 

1.3.1. Vertical Gene Transfer 

 

The transmission of bacterial genes generally occurs either by vertical gene transfer or 

by HGT. The vertical gene transfer consists in transmission of genetic material from the 

parent to the daughter bacterial cell (Lawrence, 2004).  

 

1.3.2. Horizontal Gene Transfer 

 

HGT is the process of acquiring new genetic material without this vertical flow of the 

genetic material relationship. There are three basic forms of HGT: conjugation, in which 

conjugative plasmids are exchanged between bacteria; transformation, in which free 

DNA in the environment is uptaken by bacteria; and transduction, in which viruses act as 

a vectors for HGT (Thomas and Nielsen, 2005). Genes acquired through HGT generally 

have negative effects for the host bacteria, as they can destabilize the genome. However, 

they may also confer selective advantage to the bacteria provided the environmental 

condition are appropriate, and therefore they may spread in the bacterial communities. 

A good example of this is the contribution of the presence of ABs in soil and the spread 

of ARGs by HGT.  

 

1.3.2.1. Conjugation 

 

Conjugation occurs when there is direct cell-cell contact between two bacteria to transfer 

genes through conjugative plasmids (Ryan et al., 2004). The conjugative process 

involves a donor and a recipient cell. The donor bacteria needs to possess the 

conjugative plasmids (Norman et al., 2009) and specific structures. There are three types 

of such structures, the F-like pili (mainly IncF plasmids), the P-like pili (IncP, -N, and -W), 

or type IV secretion apparatus (Hong et al., 2017). In Gram positive bacteria, conjugation 

occurs either through type IV secretion systems (in the case of single strand DNA) or by 

the TraB-dependent spreading mechanism, identified in Streptomyces spp., where 

double-stranded DNA translocation is performed by a single protein during cell division 

(Goessweiner-Mohr et al., 2017; Sepulveda et al., 2011; Thoma and Muth, 2012). 

 

 



 

27  

1.3.2.2. Transformation 

 

Transformation is a process where DNA fragments are taken up by bacteria from the 

environment, coming usually from the lysis of other bacteria. The uptake of DNA, its 

integration and its expression requires the bacteria to be in a regulated physiological 

state of competence. DNA uptake requires protein components also utilized in type IV 

pilus formation, twitching mobility, and the type II secretory system (Zaneveld et al., 

2008). The fact that transformation is widely spread among diverse taxonomic groups of 

bacteria indicates that it has an important function in the environment (Thomas and 

Nielsen, 2005). DNA, including ARGs, may persist in the environment for weeks or even 

months in soil after its release from dead cells (Dong et al., 2019; Pietramellara et al., 

2009). Most competent bacteria can uptake both chromosomal and plasmid DNA, 

although plasmidic DNA requires linearization prior to its integration into the host 

chromosome (Thomas and Nielsen, 2005). These mechanisms are important 

contributors to the spread of ARGs in the environment (Dong et al., 2019; Thomas and 

Nielsen, 2005). 

 

1.3.2.3. Transduction 

 

Transduction occurs when bacteria-specific viruses (called bacteriophages or, simply, 

phages) transfer DNA between two bacteria, therefore acting as DNA vectors. Phages 

gain entry to their microbial host cell by binding to extracellular receptors on the cell 

surface.  The origin of DNA obtained through transduction largely depends on the host 

range of the phage (Andam et al., 2015), which may cover from very narrow to rather 

broad  taxonomical groups (Ma et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2013). Interestingly, the phage 

life cycle may have an extra impact on HGT, as lytic bacteriophages may release a 

considerable quantity of plasmid and chromosomal DNA after provoking bacterial lysis. 

This increases the free DNA in the environment and therefore increases the chances for 

transformation to occur (Keen et al., 2017). 

 

1.3.3. MGEs 

 

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are segments of DNA that encode enzymes and other 

proteins that mediate the movement of DNA from a bacterial cell to another. Integration 

of new genetic information into bacteria constitutes a large functional leap that allows 



 

28  

fast adaptation to new environments or to stressful conditions. Plasmids and transposons 

are relevant members of the class of MGEs. Integrons may be associated with plasmids 

or transposons (Stokes et al., 2006) and facilitate the transmission of several genes. As 

they usually encompass gene cassettes codifying for different ARGs, they contribute to 

the spread of AB multi-resistance (Labbate et al., 2009).  In some cases, they also 

encode genes conferring heavy metal resistance, which may drive co-selection of ABR 

and heavy metal resistance (Seiler and Berendonk, 2012). 

 

1.3.3.1. Plasmids 

 

Plasmids are collections of functional genetic modules organized into a stable, self-

replicating entity. While plasmids usually do not contain genes required for essential 

cellular functions, they usually encompass genes that give bacteria phenotypic 

advantages in response to selective pressures, such as ARGs or genes conferring 

resistance to heavy metals (Li et al., 2015; Seiler and Berendonk, 2012). Plasmids are 

found in three domains of life (Shintani et al., 2015),  although the vast majority of them 

(93.5 %) are present in Bacteria (Fig. 1.1). 

 

Figure 1. 1. The taxonomic distribution of fully sequenced plasmids (Shintani et al., 2015). 

 

Plasmid may be classified according to their function, their capability for conjugation, or 

by incompatibility groups (Shintani et al., 2015). The term Incompatibility (Inc) refers to 



 

29  

the fact that two plasmids belonging to the same Inc group cannot be stably present in 

the same bacterial cell (Popowska and Krawczyk-Balska, 2013). Incompatibility results 

from two plasmids possessing replicons with the same specificity for Rep protein or 

controlling elements (Thomas, 2014). Therefore, related plasmids are usually 

incompatible, and non-related plasmids tend to be compatible, with exceptions. Related 

plasmids can coexist in a bacterial cell due to sequence differences in regulatory RNA, 

whereas non-similar plasmids that share a common ancestor can show incompatibility, 

such as the IncP-1 replicons (Thomas, 2014).  

 
The IncP-1 plasmids contain mosaic structures that originated from several parental 

plasmids lines that have evolved and adapted different in phylogenetically distant 

bacterial species (Norberg et al., 2011). Therefore, IncP-1 are pervasive and have a 

broad host range (Sen et al., 2011) due to their highly efficient conjugative transfer in 

Gram-negative bacteria (Popowska and Krawczyk-Balska, 2013), including Escherichia 

coli, Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella aerogenes (Popowska and Krawczyk-Balska, 2013; 

Shintani et al., 2010; Thomas, 2000). Bacteria carrying IncP-1 have been isolated from 

soils under anthropogenic pressure (Heuer et al., 2012; Popowska and Krawczyk-

Balska, 2013). IncP-1 plasmids are potential AB resistance vectors, and they may carry 

intI1, sul1, tet, blaOXA and blaTEM, just to mention genetic elements relevant for this Thesis 

(Heuer et al., 2012; Sen et al., 2013, 2011; Szczepanowski et al., 2011). 

 

1.3.3.2. Integrons 

 

Integrons are genetic elements that contain a site-specific recombination system able to 

integrate, express and exchange specific DNA elements, called gene cassettes (Fig. 

1.2). The complete integron is not considered to be a mobile element as such, as it lacks 

functions for self-mobility, whereas the gene cassettes present in integrons are 

considered as mobile (Domingues et al., 2012).  

 

1.3.3.3. Class 1 integrons 

 

Integrons are divided into different classes. The classification system is based on the 

amino acid sequences of IntI integrases, with some of them associated to mobile genetic 

elements (e.g. Class 1, 2 and 3), while others are associated to the bacterial 

chromosome (e.g. Class 4) (Deng et al., 2015). 

 



 

30  

Class 1 integrons are widely reported in pathogens from clinical settings, carrying gene 

cassettes associated with antibiotic resistance, and can be found in transposons and 

plasmids, allowing their dissemination through HGT. Integrons have been recently 

detected in microbial species from various environments, including wastewater, river 

water, and soil, suggesting that the dissemination of integrons may be a general problem 

of environmental pollution and public health (Gillings et al., 2015).  

 

 

 

Figure 1. 2. Integron structure and function. Integrons consist of a gene for an integron-integrase 
(intI) that catalyses recombination between the attC site of circular gene cassettes and the 
attendant integron recombination site, attI (Gillings et al., 2015). 

 

1.3.4. ARGs and MGE associated gene selection 

 

This Ph.D. Thesis is focused on the distribution of ARGs and microbiomes along the soil-

plant continuum.  Seven ARGs (blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, blaOXA-58, mecA, qnrS1, sul1, tetM) 

were selected based on their relevance in the assessment of the antibiotic resistance 

status in environmental settings, on their clinical relevance (described below), and 

association with MGEs (Berendonk et al., 2015). In addition, we chose the integron class 

1 a proxy for anthropogenic impact and because of its association with HGT activity 

(Gillings et al., 2015). These are the main characteristics of these selected, AB resistance 

related sequences: 

 

 The blaTEM genes encode for TEM β-lactamases (Muhammad et al., 2014).  blaTEM 

genes have a high prevalence and distribution in the environment (Lachmayr et 

al., 2009).  They require just few specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 

to turn from specific to extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes 

(Muhammad et al., 2014). 

 



 

31  

 blaCTX-M-32 encodes an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) found mostly in 

the Enterobacteriaceae family members, including E. coli. (Cartelle et al., 2004; 

Mugnaioli et al., 2006). 

 

 blaOXA-58 confers resistance to carbapenems, which are considered drugs of last 

resort in Acinetobacter species. Several of those species are responsible for 

nosocomial infections (Bertini et al., 2007).  

 

 mecA confers resistance to methicilin, and it is present in Staphylococcus species 

MRSA (Methicilin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), also causing nosocomial 

infections (Wielders et al., 2002). 

 

 qnrS1 confers resistance to quinolones and it is found in Enterobacteriaceae 

clinical isolates (Tamang et al., 2008). 

 

 tetM (tetracycline resistance) and sul1 (Sulfonamide resistance) have been 

shown to co-occur in plasmids derived from environmental samples with 

anthropogenic impact, sometimes linked to intI1. (Gillings et al., 2015, 2008; Hu 

et al., 2008; Nonaka et al., 2012). 

 

 intI1 encodes the site-specific recombinase IntI1, responsible for the insertion 

and excision of exogenous gene cassettes at the integron-class 1 associated 

recombination site attI1 (Mendes et al., 2007). 

 

 

1.4. ARGs quantification   

 

Molecular biology has as wide range of applications in environmental studies. PCR 

(Bartlett and Stirling, 2003) is widely used to detect the presence of target genes present 

in  soil, water, etc. This allows the detection of bacteria of interest, or even or with further 

processing study microbial communities (bacteria, fungi). qPCR (Higuchi et al., 1993) is 

a variant of the PCR method that allows detection and quantification of target genes with 

a high sensitivity and precision (Muniesa et al., 2014). 

 

 

 



 

32  

1.4.1. PCR 

 

The PCR reaction allows the amplification of specific DNA sequences from a DNA 

sample. It requires the template DNA, primers, nucleotides (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine 

and Thymine), and a heat-stable DNA polymerase, usually the Taq polymerase (Chien 

et al., 1976). The primers are short nucleic acid sequences complementary to the target 

DNA. They are required to bind to the 3’ end of the target DNA for the Taq polymerase 

to start incorporating the nucleotides to synthesize a complementary strand (Garibyan 

and Avashia, 2013).  

 

The PCR reactions are carried in a thermocycler, a programmable system able to 

perform the polymerase chain reaction. It works by creating repeated thermal cycles, by 

increasing and lowering temperature to allow DNA amplification in three steps (Fig. 1.3). 

The first step is named denaturation. The solution with DNA template and reagents is 

heated above the melting point of the double strand DNA of the target sequence, allowing 

the two strands of DNA to separate one each other. Secondly, the temperature is lowered 

slightly below the primers Tm to allow the primers to bind to the target DNA sequences, 

in a step named annealing. At the third step, the temperature is raised, which allows the 

Taq polymerase to extend the primers by adding nucleotides to the complementary DNA 

strand (Garibyan and Avashia, 2013).

allowing the primers to bind to the targeted sequences.  (3) The final step, extension happens 
with the bidding of DNA polymerase and synthesis of a new DNA strand 
(https://www.thermofisher.com). 

 

1.4.2. qPCR 

 

The qPCR technique serves for quantification of target sequence by measuring the 

amount of amplified product in real time. This is achieved by either using a fluorescent 

dye,  Sybr Green I (Zipper, 2004) or by the use of fluorophore-containing DNA probes 

such as TaqMan (Holland et al., 1991). The methods used in this Thesis were based on 

Sybr Green technology. This dye binds to all double–stranded DNA and the binding is 

monitored by measuring the increase in fluorescence throughout reiterative qPCR 

reactions (Fig. 1.4 B). The qPCR reaction has four phases. The first phase, named 

ground or lag phase, corresponds to the first amplifications, during which the amount of 

fluorescence produced is too low to be detected. The second, exponential phase, occurs 

once the amplification of the target sequence reached a number of copies that make the 

subsequent doublings detectable as increases in the fluorescence of the solution. The 

amount of amplicons, and therefore, of the recorded fluorescence, doubles every cycle 

when the efficiency is 100% (equation 1.4). Thirdly, as the reagents are being consumed 

and their concentrations start to run low, the reaction slows down and linear phase is 

reached. Lastly, a plateau is reached, where there is no more amplification as the 

reagents run out (Fig. 1.4) (Page and Stromberg, 2011).

DNA. (B) The four qPCR phases in a linear view:  plotting the number of cycles (x-axis) to the

34  

emitted fluorescence (y-axis) in real time. The dashed line separating the grey and white 
backgrounds represents the Ct (Page and Stromberg, 2011; Rutledge, 2003). 

 

1.4.2.1 Gene quantification 

 

Relative quantification is performed by comparing the copy numbers of target amplicon 

with a housekeeping gene (positive control), and it is commonly used for studies of gene 

expression (Čikoš et al., 2007).  Absolute quantification of a target is measured by the 

standard curve method (Rutledge, 2003), and it was the method used in this Thesis 

 

1.4.2.2. Absolute Quantification by the standard curve method  

 

The standard curve provides information about the 10-fold serial dilution prepared with 

the standard. In each dilution is possible to calculate the copy numbers of the standard, 

by measuring its concentration and knowing beforehand its length in base pairs. This is 

shown in formula (1.1): 

 

(1.1) 
𝑋 𝑛𝑔𝜇𝑙−1

𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 (𝑏𝑝) ×660 𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒−1
 × 6.0022 × 1023 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒−1 = 𝑌 𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑒𝑠𝜇𝑙−1 

 

The serial dilutions should cover the complete range of expected number of DNA copies 

of the unknown samples. The standard curve is specific to each qPCR assay; therefore, 

samples must run in parallel. The Ct value of the samples is compared with the standard 

curve to determine their copy numbers.  

 

The Ct value may be obtained by two methods, the fit-points and the Second Derivative 

Maximum calculation (Luu-The et al., 2005). The latter method was used in this Thesis. 

It identifies the turning point when the fluorescence turns sharply upward during the 

exponential phase (Fig. 1.4 B), which corresponds to a maximum on the second 

derivative of the fluorescence values (Luu-The et al., 2005). This method is applied 

automatically and calculated by the PCR machine without the user interference. The 

obtained Ct values (Fig. 1.5 A) are then plotted as function of the copy numbers 

calculated with the serial dilution curve (Fig. 1.5 B).  

 

The standard curve allows to evaluate the performance of the qPCR assay (Fig. 1.5 B) 

using several parameters. Ct values are inversely proportional to the logarithm of DNA 

concentration, and the efficiency of the reaction is calculated from the slope between the 



 

35  

target concentration and Ct values. The efficiency of the qPCR (equations 1.2 and 1.3) 

should be between 90–110%, corresponding to a slope ranging from −3.6 to −3.3, 

meaning that Ct values of the standards 10-fold serial dilution should be 3.3 cycles apart 

-i.e., log2(10).  This means there is a 2-fold change in DNA concentration between two 

cycles when the efficiency is 1 (100%), as showed in the formula 1.4, in which Cn is copy 

number at cycle n and Ci the initial copy number. 

 

Figure 1.5. (A) Amplification curves with the number of qPCR cycles on the x-axis and y-axis the 
fluorescence levels. The brown amplification lines correspond to the standard serial dilutions, 
which will be used for the standard curve. The standard curve allows to calculate the number of 
DNA copies of the samples (red curves). (B) Example of a standard curve, with 7 dilution points. 
The x-axis contains the number of DNA copies and the y-axis the Ct value (Yan et al., 2011).

The correlation coefficient (R2) value (Fig. 1.5 B) is obtained after a linear regression 

analysis on the measured Ct values. It shows how well the regression line fits the data 

points, plus the scattering of the standard technical replicates. The correlation coefficient 

should be above 0.98 (Broeders et al., 2014). 

 

The reproducibility of technical replicates should also be taken into account. The 

maximum allowed standard deviation in Ct value between the qPCR replicates should 

be approximately 0.35, corresponding to 0.5 cycles. In the work showed in this Thesis 

the maximum standard deviation accepted was 0.3. Low values are important since a 

small contribution of the technical variance means that most variance will be due to the 

biological variability.

As Sybr Green I only binds to double-stranded DNA, the fluorescence levels maybe 

plotted as a function of the temperature. As soon as the temperature rises, the double-

stranded DNA start to dissociate leading to a decrease in fluorescence levels. The Tm 

corresponds to the inflection point of the melting curve (Broeders et al., 2014).  The 

melting curve is essential to detect dimers or unspecific amplifications, and can be used 

to differentiate amplicons separated by less than 2 oC. This is possible as Tm depends 

on the G+C/A+T ratio of the amplicon (Ririe et al., 1997). 

 

1.5.  HGT, Ecology and Phylogeny 

 

1.5.1. Ecology 

 

HGT between different species has been recognized as a common and major 

evolutionary process (Reitner and Thiel, 2011) whose impact in soil resistomes is still 

under investigation (Zhaxybayeva and Doolittle, 2011). HGT frequency and effects are 

dependent on both Ecology and Phylogeny. The analysis of the potential transfer of 

genes between human bacteria and bacteria from different environments, such as soil, 

livestock, and others, showed an approximately threefold rate of HGT between bacteria 

of the same environment than from different environments (Fig. 1.6), irrespectively of 

their phylogenetic distance (Smillie et al., 2011).

Figure 1.6. HGT frequency is plotted as a function of the phylogenetic divergence between 
species of environmental bacteria (Smillie et al., 2011). 

 

Bacteria from environmental and human-associated microbiomes differ in their core 

resistomes (Fig. 1.7). Some ARGs that define those environments provide resistance to 

β-lactams and tetracyclines by different mechanisms.  Despite soil and human gut 

microbiota have functionally distinct ARGs, there are no significant differences in the 

number of distinct ARGs between them when grouped by functional AB resistance 

(Gibson et al., 2015). Therefore, Ecology defines different core resistomes, including 

human-, water- and soil-associated resistomes (Fig. 1.7). Ecology is then a  barrier as 

donor and recipient bacteria have to be in the same niche for HGT to occur (Schmidt and 

Hensel, 2004). The conclusion is that Ecology, that is, the co-occurrence of donor and 

acceptor bacteria in a same environmental compartment, is more important than 

phylogeny for HGT.

AR mechanism is significantly enriched within a particular phyla or habitat (Gibson et al., 2015).  

 

1.5.2. Persistence of AB resistance 

 

Many resistance genes persist for long periods in the absence of antibiotics. The factors 

that affect the maintenance of ABs resistance have a different weight according to the 

system type (Andersson and Hughes, 2011). In an open system in which external 

interactions and bacterial migrations occur (e.g. hospitals, farms), AB resistance will 

either persist or reverse, according the dilution of the ARB present in that same system. 

This is dependent on the influx and outflow of non-resistant bacteria from the system, 

compared to the number of the system resistant bacteria. Thus, if the proportion of non-

resistant bacteria in arriving to the system is higher than the resident community, the 

incoming bacteria will reduce the resistance frequency. Conversely, the fitness cost of 

resistance has a major role determining ARBs persistence in systems with low bacteria 

migration or closed systems. Therefore, if the fitness cost of keeping the AB resistance 

is low, or if there are compensatory mechanisms, the ARB survival and spreading is not 

affected and the AB resistance will persist (Andersson and Hughes, 2011).  



 

39  

The fitness cost may be counter-balanced by several mechanisms. Bacterial co-

selection with  heavy-metals and AB resistance (Baker-Austin et al., 2006) has been 

studied in contaminated water and soils (Baker-Austin et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 2019; 

Seiler and Berendonk, 2012), likely due to the presence genes codifying both resistances 

in a same MGE (Chapman, 2003). 

 

Evolution of the host (Millan et al., 2014), plasmid (Harrison et al., 2015), or both 

(Dahlberg and Chao, 2003; De Gelder et al., 2008; Loftie-Eaton et al., 2016) also 

decreases the fitness cost of carrying AB resistance (e.g.  in plasmids). This happens 

due to compensatory mutations in the plasmid, bacterial chromosome or a combination 

of both. It leads to an interaction shift between plasmid and hosts proteins/enzymes 

(Yano et al., 2016). For example, this has been observed in mutations of the replication 

initiation gene (trfA1). Carrying plasmids with the mutated gene have a lower fitness cost 

to the bacteria with the non-mutated gene.  This happens due to lower affinity of the 

TrfA1 protein to the DNA helicase DnaB. The mutated TrfA1 cannot activate DnaB at the 

plasmid origin of replication (oriV) without the host DnaA gene, as both helicases are 

involved in chromosomal replication. Two models were used to explain the improvement 

in fitness cost: the titration model, in which the non-mutated trfA1 causes a reduced 

concentration of free DnaB, and the inhibition model, which postulates the formation of 

a TrfA1-DnaB complex that inhibits chromosomal DNA replication (Loftie-Eaton et al., 

2017; Yano et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the reason DnaB-TrfA1 interactions have a 

negative effect on host fitness, and the underlying mechanisms that explain the 

compensatory mutations are still poorly understood (Millan et al., 2014; Yano et al., 

2016). 

 

Several factors are critical for the non-conjugative plasmids statibility and persistence, 

including the genetic makeup of the hosts, the proportion of bacteria carrying the plasmid 

with compensatory mutations, and the rate at which they appear in the microbiome 

before antibiotic exposure. Therefore, the combination of selective pressure, even in rare 

events, and compensatory mutations may overcome the fitness costs of non-conjugative 

plasmids (Millan et al., 2014).   

 

In the case of conjugative plasmids, even with high fitness costs their stability and 

persistence, may not be affected as long high conjugation rates are present in a 

population.  High conjugation compensates for fitness cost and plasmid segregational 

loss in the absence of the ABs selective pressure. The fate of a conjugative plasmid in a 



 

40  

sub-population may not be affected by the presence of other plasmids, if for instance 

they belong to other incompatibility groups. The main barrier would be the Ecological 

relations between the sub-populations carrying the different plasmids, reflected in the 

microbiome composition (Lopatkin et al., 2017). 

  

1.5.3. Phylogeny 

 

Conjugation between different Phyla may happen more often than previously thought, 

(Klümper et al., 2015), meaning that broad-host range plasmids can be hosted by diverse 

types of bacteria in complex communities. These plasmids can be received by bacteria 

distantly related to the donor, along with genes associated to transposons and class 1 

integrons, such as the referred IncP-1 plasmids between gram-negative bacteria 

(Klümper et al., 2015; Sen et al., 2011). Transfers between gram-negative and positive 

bacteria may also happen, when fueled by  selective pressure (Jiang et al., 2017; 

Klümper et al., 2015). 

 

Inter-Phyla HGT with conjugative plasmids between Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria 

may happen quite often in soil (Klümper et al., 2015). It has been hypothesized that 

Actinobacteria, known to synthesize different bacterial antibiotics may be the source of 

transmission to Proteobacteria, and that they may represent both old and recent HGT 

events (Fig. 1.8) (Jiang et al., 2017).   

 
As stated previously, bacteria need to be in the same environment for high rates of HGT 

to be able to counteract the fitness cost of maintaining plasmids. In an open system, this 

physical barrier maybe be broken by the inflow and outflow of bacteria. Incoming 

bacterial species may not be able to outcompete and colonize the Ecological niche 

(Gatica and Cytryn, 2013), but,  if they persist in the recipient environment, intra-taxon 

genetic exchange will occur more often than inter-taxon. In this case, Phylogeny will be 

the main influencer of the global HGT rate (Y. Hu et al., 2016; Schmidt and Hensel, 2004). 

This is related to host range of the conjugative plasmids (Klümper et al., 2015), as some 

of them show a narrow host range (e.g. IncF, IncH, and IncI) while others have a wider 

range (e.g. IncN, IncP, and IncW) (Suzuki et al., 2010). Therefore, Phylogeny acts as a 

complementary barrier to Ecology, as clusters of ARGs associated with MGEs were 

limited by the bacterial lineages. For instance, sul1, sul2, strA, and strB tend to 

transferred in Proteobacteria, while tetM, tetO, and ermB are transferred preferentially 

among Firmicutes species (Y. Hu et al., 2016).

1.6. Microbiomes 

 

1.6.1. Soil microbiomes 

 

Soils are the most complex and heterogeneous ecosystems on earth, probably 

containing more unravelled biodiversity than any other genetic reservoir of the biosphere 

(Fitter, 2005). Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes are the 

predominant phyla in soils from different environments (Gibson et al., 2015), but the final 

microbiome composition depends on several biotic and abiotic factors. It modulates 

several biogeochemical processes, including nitrogen fixation (Rhizobium spp., 

Bradyrhizobium, spp., Azotobacter spp., etc), nitrification (Nitrosomonas spp., 

Nitrococcus spp., etc) and denitrification (Flavobacterium spp., Bacillus spp.) (Fierer, 

2017). It has been estimated that each gram of soil contains about 10,000 different 

bacterial species (Torsvik and Øvreås, 2002), although the vast majority of the soil 

biodiversity remains uncharacterised (Banwart et al., 2019).  

 

 

 

 

 



 

42  

1.6.2 Root microbiome assemblage 

 

1.6.2.1. Soil type and properties 

 

Soil properties influence the formation of bacterial communities in the roots (Lundberg et 

al., 2012)(Fierer, 2017), including pH, O2 concentration, redox status, and soil nutrients 

(Xue et al., 2018). Roots also affect soil properties, in a distance-dependent manner 

(Costa et al., 2006; Dotaniya and Meena, 2015). The portion of soil adjacent to the roots, 

which presents different physical and chemical properties from the bulk soil due to roots' 

influence, is referred to as the rhizosphere, whereas the surface of plant roots is 

denominated rhizoplane (Fageria and Moreira, 2011). Soil, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane 

form a continuum, in which the soil type influences the microbiomes in the rhizosphere, 

rhizoplane, and, finally, the bacterial population inside of the root, the root endosphere 

(inner tissues) (Berg et al., 2014). In this scheme, the bulk soil acts as reservoir of 

bacteria that can be recruited to colonize the roots. In general, it is assumed that the 

rhizhospheric community is shaped by the plant, based on the reservoir present in the 

soil, and that there is a mutual interaction between the rhizosphere and the plant genome 

(Costa et al., 2006; Schreiter et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2003). 

 

1.6.2.2. Rhizosphere Effect 

 

The rhizosphere forms a narrow zone of soil (~ 2mm) surrounding the roots, and it shows 

a microbial community structure different from the bulk soil. This difference is strongly 

dependent on the distance to the roots (Costa et al., 2006; Dotaniya and Meena, 2015; 

Smalla et al., 2001), with a decrease on bacterial diversity and increase in dominance, 

on what is named the “rhizosphere effect” (Dotaniya and Meena, 2015). The plant 

contributes to this “rhizosphere effect” by producing root exudates that contain small-

molecular weight metabolites, amino acids, enzymes, mucilage, and cell lysates. The 

root exudates may represent a substantial proportion of the net carbon assimilation of 

the plant, from less than 10% to as much as 44%, for nutrient-stressed plants (Fig. 1.9) 

(Bais et al., 2006). This output of carbon-rich material significantly contributes to the 

composition and properties of the rhizospheric bacteria, acting as signaling molecules, 

attractants,  stimulants, inhibitors or repellents (Baetz and Martinoia, 2014; Haichar et 

al., 2008). The exudation patterns may change over time, as plants can select a subset 

of microbes at different stages of development, presumably for specific functions. 

 



 

43  

 

Figure 1.9. Plant-soil bacteria feedback. The interaction between the plant’s roots and the 
microorganisms creates the rhizosphere effect (Chaparro et al., 2014).  

 

1.6.2.3. Plant Host and Genotype 

 

The assemblage of the plant roots’ microbiome is complex and affected by various 

factors including the plant genotype (Reinhold-Hurek et al., 2015; Zolti et al., 2019) (Fig. 

1.10). The host plant has important role in the bacterial community composition, affecting 

the active bacterial community in the soil. This effect, which decreases with the distance 

to the root, varies according the plant species (cucumber, tomato, maize, wheat). Gene 

expression profiles in both bacteria and roots' cells reflect  the requirements to colonize 

the roots (Yu and Hochholdinger, 2018) and to the selection of appropriate bacterial 

species, including motility and chemotaxis, polysaccharide degradation, various two-

component systems, multiple secretion systems, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis 

(Ofek et al., 2014). 

 

The richness of bacteria in the root compartments decreases to approximately half of the 

OTUs of the bulk soil (Ofek et al., 2014). This "funnel effect" implies that only a fraction 

of the bacterial pool present in the bulk soil colonizes the rhizosphere, and that, from this 

community, only another fraction colonizes the rhizoplane and roots’ endosphere. Due 

to the factors mentioned previously, the microbiome of root endosphere is usually distinct 



 

44  

from the rhizosphere and rhizoplane bacterial populations. This is due to the phenotypic 

traits required to colonize the plant, as root surface attachment and colonization are 

necessary steps for root colonization (Dörr et al., 1998; Reinhold-Hurek et al., 2006). 

 

Figure 1.10. The effects of the plant genotype according the distance to the roots (Reinhold-
Hurek et al., 2015).  

 

1.7. Microbial Ecology Methods 

 

The advent of Molecular Biology, invention of PCR, and, more recently, DNA sequencing, 

broaden the ways how Ecosystems could be studied (Fox et al., 1977; Gupta et al., 1983; 

Hugenholtz et al., 1998; Staden, 1979). It became possible to focus on microbial 

communities, thanks to the development of specific genetic markers. Among them, 

ribosomal DNA is widely used for Phylogenetic studies, and allowed (Woese, 1990) to 

define the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archea, Eukarya.  

 

Bacteria and Archaea have a 50S large ribosomal subunit that contains two rRNA 

species, the 5S and 23S rRNAs. The Prokaryote 30S small ribosomal sub-unit contains 

a single 16S rRNA. rRNAs evolve more slowly than protein encoding genes, and are 

particularly important for the phylogenetic analysis of distantly related species. The 16S 

rDNA is about 1550 base-pairs and it is constituted by 9 hypervariable regions (Fig. 1.11), 



 

45  

V1 to V9. Particular phylogenetic groups have unique oligonucleotide sequences in the 

variable regions, surrounded by conserved regions, thus allowing for the design of 

“universal“ primers. The “universal” primers allow DNA amplification of conserved 

regions and hyper-variable regions and the subsequent identification of bacteria (Amit 

Roy, 2014). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.11. Schematic representation of the hyper-variable regions of the 16S rDNA gene, 
from V1 to V9 (Yang et al., 2016).  

 

The utilization of 16S rDNA has its shortcomings, particularly concerning sensitivity and 

resolution. Short amplified sequences from next-generation sequencing results in a 

narrow choice of sets of primers for certain hypervariable regions. The short size of these 

sequences, added to the fact many bacteria may share the same sequences, leads to 

the uneven amplification of certain taxa,  with their posterior erroneous taxonomy 

attribution, under- or over- estimation in their abundance, and a consequent reduction in 

sensitivity of the system (Wang and Qian, 2009; Yang et al., 2016). Connected to the 

sensitivity is the correlation of different Phylogenetic groups to different hypervariable 

regions (Yang et al., 2016), wich represents an extra bias. Several genetic markers have 

been proposed over the years as alternative or complement to 16S rDNA, such as rpoB 

(Case et al., 2007; Vos et al., 2012) or gyrB (Peeters and Willems, 2011; Wang et al., 

2007).

1.7.1. Methodology for 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing 
 
 
An outline of the procedure for 16S rDNA sequencing is shown in Fig. 1.12. Isolated DNA 

from biological material is subjected to targeted enrichment to amplify the 16S rDNA 

regions of interest, producing amplicon libraries enriched in the targeted sequences. 

These libraries are then subjected to two additional PCRs. The purpose of the first PCR 

is to add unpaired nucleotides at 5’ of both sense and anti-sense sequences. The 

subsequent PCR will add a specific sequence of nucleotides (multiplexing indexes) per 

sample, allowing either single (Fig. 1.12 A) or double indexation (Fig. 1.12 B).  Afterwards 

the samples are pooled and a single NGS run is performed.

1.7.3. Ecology Measurements  

 

The basis to study microbial communities is their diversity, a concept that was developed 

in the mid-20th century. The denominations of α-, β- , and γ-diversity were introduced by 

Robert Harding Whittaker (Whittaker, 1960), but only the first two are used for 

microbiome studies. The concept of  α-diversity in Ecology is related to richness and/or 

evenness of species on a local site, whereas  β-diversity is broadly defined as the 

variation in the identities of species between two sites  (Anderson et al., 2011).  

 

The presented work in this Thesis is mainly focused on β-diversity, as it is more relevant 

to compare microbiome compositions, either in longitudinal or cross-sectional studies, 

and to understand the impact of stressors on the microbiomes (agricultural practices). 

There are dozens of developed equations/algorithms for α- and β-diversity (Anderson et 

al., 2011; Hill et al., 2003; Koh, 2018; Wilson and Shmida, 1984).  However, it will be only 

presented the most commonly α-diversity measurements used and the relevant β-

diversity measurements for this Thesis. 

 

1.7.4. α-diversity 

 

Diversity describes both richness, the number of different classes measured (species, 

OTUs, etc) and evenness, the distribution of individuals among classes, and both 

parameters have to be taken into account by  diversity descriptors (Hill et al., 2003). The 

different α-diversity metrics are classified into non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic 

metrics. The non-phylogenetic measures are constructed based solely on microbial 

abundance information, while the phylogenetic metrics further utilize information from 

phylogenetic trees (Koh, 2018). Non-phylogenetic measures are more common and 

have been used since mid-20th century. Three of the most known metrics are the 

Shannon (Shannon, 1948), the Simpson (Simpson, 1949; Hurlbert, 1971), and the Pielou 

index (Pielou, 1966).  

 

The Shannon index (H’) is calculated by the equation 1.5, in which is pi stands for relative 

abundance value of species i and S is the number of species.  

 

  (1.5)        𝐻′ = ∑ 𝑝𝑖 ln(𝑝𝑖)
𝑆
𝑖=1  

 



 

48  

The evenness are relative measures expressing the degree of evenness and inequality 

in a given community,  derived from species richness and diversity (Jost, 2010). Pielou’s 

eveness index (1.6) is derived from the Shannon’s diversity index, by dividing it by the 

natural logarithm of the number of classes (S).

∑ 𝑝𝑖 ln(𝑝𝑖)

𝑆
𝑗=1

The Simpson index (1.7) (D) access diversity by measuring dominance, gives more 

weight to the most common species.  In this equation S is the number of classes, ni is 

the number of bacteria observed from the ith class and N is the total number of individuals 

observed in the sample.

The Simpson’s index Ds (1.8) is a derivative of Simpson index (l) that is normally used to 

calculate the probability of two random selected individuals belong to two different 

species.  It serves as an evenness measure.

1.7.5. β-diversity 

 

α-diversity does not give values for species turnover, gradients, or variation in bacterial 

communities (Anderson et al., 2011). β-diversity measurements approach either 

turnover, or variation of species within a given population, or between two populations. 

In microbial ecology, β-diversity is derived from multivariate measures based on pairwise 

comparisons among samples. (Anderson et al., 2011). This approach explores the 

relationships between the communities’ composition and environmental factors, and 

variation comparison among a priori stablished groups (Fig. 1.13)  (Anderson et al., 

2011). Many other approaches may be applied according the research objective. This 



 

49  

may include study of partition variation in communities’ composition by specific factors, 

environmental variables, or hierarchical scales. It can be used as well for comparisons 

of effect sizes of factors (Anderson et al., 2011).  

Figure 1.13. Multivariate measures applied for the present work. (A)  exploration of the 
relationships between the community composition and factors. (B) variation comparison among 
a priori groups (Anderson et al., 2011).  

 

Two algorithms are mainly used to analyse dissimilarities in microbiome β-diversity, the 

Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (Bray and Curtis, 1957), and the UniFrac metrics 

(Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Lozupone et al., 2007). Both of them calculate pair-wise 

sample comparisons generating samples dissimilarity matrixes. The matrixes are then 

used for permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (Anderson, 

2001), which allows the analysis of microbiomes composition variation between a priori 

defined groups.   

 

1.7.5.1. Bray-Curtis 

 

The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is a non-phylogenetic β-diversity measure and depends on 

the number of a species counts that are unique to any of both communities in relation to 

the sum of abundances in both communities (Baselga, 2013). It excludes joint absences 

of species in the compared communities (Anderson et al., 2011). Abundant species   

have more weight in the coefficient than rare species, as the latter add very little to the 

value of the coefficient. 

 

The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (1.9) takes in consideration XAi and XBi, representing the 

abundance of species i on the communities A and B. This will result in a value between 

0 and 1.

∑ |𝑋𝐴𝑖−𝑋𝐵𝑖|

𝑆
𝑖=1

∑ (𝑋𝐴𝑖+𝑋𝐵𝑖)
𝑆
𝑖=1

 

 



 

50  

Two completely equal communities, having equal species abundances will present a 

value of 0, whereas different communities will have a value of 1. This would mean that 

both communities have no species in common and that the abundance of species in one 

community is balanced by the abundance of species in the other community. Bray-Curtis 

dissimilarity is an example of a classical β-diversity that does not take into consideration 

evolutionary relationships between species present in the same population, butonly their 

abundances (Lozupone and Knight, 2005).          

 

1.7.5.2. UniFrac dissimilarities 

 

The UniFrac metrics were developed to test differences between microbiomes, including  

phylogenetic information (Lozupone and Knight, 2005). There are two methods to 

calculate UniFrac dissimilarities, the unweighted and weighted. They were created to 

avoid the shortcomings of the non-phylogenic β-diversity measures, like Bray-Curtis 

dissimilarity.  In UniFrac, phylogenetic distances are taken into consideration, measured 

as the length of the branches from phylogenetic trees constructed for each community, 

an information usually extracted from 16S rDNA sequencing data (Lozupone and Knight, 

2005; Lozupone et al., 2007).  

 

1.7.5.3. Unweighted Unifrac (UniFrac value) 

 

The UniFrac value (u) (1.10) is calculated by using n as the total number of branches in 

the phylogenetic tree, and being bi the length of branch i.  Ai and Bi are the numbers of 

sequences that descend from branch i in communities A and B, respectively. AT, BT are 

the total numbers of sequences in those communities.

1.7.5.4. Weighted Unifrac 

 

Weighted UniFrac is used to count how many sequences from each lineage are present, 

as well as detect changes in which taxa are present (Lozupone et al., 2007). It quantifies 

the compositional dissimilarity between two different communities based on the 

sequences (OTUs) counts as well as the phylogenetic dissimilarity. It is calculated by 

dividing the u coefficient from formula (1.10) by the scaling factor D (1.11). Where dj is 



 

51  

the distance of the sequence j from the root. Aj, Bj represent the number of occurrence 

of sequence j in communities A and B, respectively. AT and BT are the total numbers of 

sequences from communities A and B (1.12).

1.8. Water scarcity and water reuse 

 

Quality fresh water for agriculture is becoming an increasingly scarce resource due to 

climate change effects and to the escalating competition from other water-using sectors. 

TWW can constitute an alternative source of water, capable to preserve socio-economic 

development, vital ecosystems, and security in food production. This is especially true 

for arid and semi-arid regions where water shortage is a severe problem.  Although TWW 

reuse for irrigation has gained an acceptance as an economic alternative that could 

substitute nutrient needs and water requirements of crop plants, TWW may contain 

undesirable chemical constituents and pathogens that pose negative environmental and 

health impacts (Piña et al., 2018). 

 

1.8.2. WWTPs and TWW 

 

WWTP treatments usually consist in two or three distinct stages (Michael et al., 2013) 

(Fig. 1.14). The primary treatment uses a physical unit to remove large objects, and a 

grit chamber to remove small stones or sand from the raw influent. This physical 

screening is followed by sedimentation tanks, to remove suspended solids still present 

in the WW, allowing the formation of a primary sludge. The effluent from the 

sedimentation tanks then goes through the secondary treatment, in which biodegradable 

organic matter, including organic matter, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and 

suspended solids are removed to a great extent using activated sludges.

Desinfection (Step 4) is optional, only applied if WW is going to be reused (Manaia et al., 2018).   

 
 

The activated sludge step consists in the utilization of aerobic bacteria and other 

microorganisms, as protozoa, that form flocs in aerobic tanks. Next, WW flows to 

sedimentation tanks for WW clarification, henceforth originating the secondary sludge. 

Both primary and secondary sludge may be used as fertilizers, after composting or 

stabilization (Kirchmann et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2015) with certain limitations 

regarding the content of heavy metals (EC Council Directive 86/278). Finally, a tertiary 

treatment may be employed to disinfect the WW, but this step is not required nor 

frequently employed in WWTPs. These processes mainly include media filtration (e.g., 

granular activated carbon/sand/gravel) and disinfection (e.g., chlorination, UV irradiation, 

and ozonation), and it may include a combination of individual treatment processes. 

(Manaia et al., 2018; Michael et al., 2013).  

 

1.8.3 Removal Efficiencies of ABs 

 

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as “hot spots” of ABs, ARB, 

ARGs (Burch et al., 2019; Rizzo et al., 2013), and as a main source of them in 

downstream environments. WWTPs fail to completely remove antibiotics, antibiotic 

resistant bacteria (ARB), and ARGs in most cases (Manaia et al., 2018; Michael et al., 

2013). Removal efficiency varies markedly under different environmental conditions and 



 

53  

as a function of chemical and physical properties of the compounds (Burch et al., 2019) 

as shown in Table 1.1. 

 

Table 1.1. Removal efficiencies with secondary treatment plant. Negative removal 
efficiency values refer to increases, rather than decreases, of the concentration of a 
given analyte, which can happen due to several factors, including operational 
parameters, chemical analytical procedures, deconjugation of conjugated metabolite, 
and other unique WW characteristics (Burch et al., 2019).

The efficiency of different tertiary treatments for ABs removal are based mainly on bench-

scale studies, as the available data in full scale WTTPs is still limited. Tertiary treatments 

are not mandatory in most countries, and are expensive to use at a full scale (Burch et 

al., 2019). Table 1.2 shows results from some of these studies.

1.8.3. Removal efficiencies of ARB and ARGs 

 

WWTPs are considered “hotspots” for ARGs dissemination as well as for propagation of 

clinically relevant ARB, depending on the origin of the influent: housing areas, industrial 

or hospitals. For example, hospital WW show higher abundance of multi-resistant P. 

aeruginosa,  which can disseminate into receiving waters and ultimately reaching 

irrigated soils (Czekalski et al., 2012). Several studies indicate that clinically relevant 

bacteria (E.coli), MGE, and integrons can survive most WWTP processes (Table 1.3) 

(Fekadu et al., 2019; Gatica et al., 2016; Michael et al., 2013). Bacteria may enter a state 

of dormancy due to the stress, re-covering when the stressors disappear (Becerra-

Castro et al., 2016; Moreira et al., 2018; Sousa et al., 2017). In addition, some 

disinfectants, as peracetic acid chlorine, or elevated temperatures, may even have a 

positive selective effect on ARGs (Di Cesare et al., 2016; Novo et al., 2013).

1.8.4.  Sources of contamination for downstream environments 

 

WWTPs rank among the most important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance in urban 

environments. Their fairly stable pH and temperature favour a remarkable diversity of 

microorganisms present in these peculiar habitats, leading to the release of high 

amounts of bacteria into the environment, many of which of animal (e.g. pets or small 

husbandry or animal farms) or human origin (Berendonk et al., 2015; Manaia et al., 2018; 

Rizzo et al., 2013). Many of these bacteria harbour acquired ARGs and are potential 

carriers for the dissemination of these genes in the environmental microbiome 

(Berendonk et al., 2015; Manaia et al., 2018; Pruden, 2014). Therefore, their contribution 

to the emergence of resistance in pathogenic bacteria cannot be neglected (Manaia et 

al., 2018).

1.9. Downstream Environments 

 

1.9.1. Fate of ARGs in soils and crops/ impacts of agricultural practices 

 

Human activity, in particular agricultural practices such as the application of manure and 

sewage sludge to crop fields, can significantly alter the composition of the so-called 

resistome, the sum of ARGs  and of their precursors present in a particular microbiome 

(Wright, 2007) (Fig. 1.15). Several studies have shown that these practices increase the 

presence in soil of ARGs that are usually found in pathogenic bacteria, thereby 

contributing to the mix of human and environmental resistomes (Banwart et al., 2019).

to the soil environment (Banwart et al., 2019).  

 

 

 



 

59  

1.9.2. Irrigation water impact 

 

1.9.2.1. ABs uptake by crops 

 

The use of TWW for irrigation has the potential to transfer heavy metals (Khan et al., 

2008), ABs and other CECs (Conkle et al., 2008); Christou et al., 2019), and pathogens 

(Manaia et al., 2018) to soils, crops, and, finally, foodstuffs. This potential risk increases 

when TWW are directly or indirectly reused for agricultural irrigation, a practice becoming 

more and more frequent due to the actual water scarcity in many countries (Piña et al., 

2018). ABs used in human or livestock healthcare become excreted and ultimately 

discharged into the aquatic environment, either as the primary products or as 

metabolites, in some cases with similar or even higher biological activities than the 

parental compound (Marx et al., 2015). Once ABs reach the soil, their degradation 

depends on soil physicochemical properties and microbial activity, so they may exert a 

continuous selective pressure over soil microbiomes for long periods (Kümmerer, 2009; 

Pan and Chu, 2016; Segura et al., 2009). Plants may uptake ABs via their roots, and 

they can be found in different plant parts (root, fruit, leaves). Plant tissues may therefore 

accumulate sub-inhibitory concentrations of different ABs, such as tetracycline, 

streptomycin, and ciprofloxacin (Ahmed et al., 2015; Gullberg et al., 2011). 

 

The AB uptake capability of different plants varies due to several factors, including the 

soil properties, plant evapotranspiration potential and its net irrigation requirements   

(Christou et al., 2019; Trapp, 2015). Plants grown in a hot and dry environment have 

increased rates of evapotranspiration compared to those grown in milder environmental 

conditions (Christou et al., 2019). Fruit vegetables (cucumber, tomato, pepper, beans)  

have a lower ability for uptake of soil-borne pollutants, including AB, compared to leafy 

and root vegetables (Christou et al., 2019) (Fig. 1.16). The uptaken pollutants become 

ultimately translocated to leaves and fruits (Christou et al., 2019; Goldstein et al., 2014).

potential for uptake is indicated with dark red; the lowest potential with dark green (Christou et al., 
2019). 

 

1.9.3. Soil amendment impact 

 

1.9.3.1. Manure 

 

The application of manure for amending crop soils may cause a series of environmental 

problems, among them the spread of ARGs is considered as a serious concern (Heuer 

and Smalla, 2007; Jechalke et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Marti et al., 2013; Riber et al., 

2014; Udikovic-Kolic et al., 2014). Large amounts of in-feed ABs that cannot be absorbed 

by livestock are excreted through feces or urine, forming part of the manure and, if used 

for soil amendment and fertilization, leading to an elevated level of residual antibiotics in 

arable soil (Christou et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017). In addition, animal manure has been 

proved to be an important reservoir of bacteria carrying ARGs and MGEs, whose relative 

abundances in soil are mutually correlated (Heuer and Smalla, 2007; Wang et al., 2015; 

Xiang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2013). The high abundance of MGEs facilitates a higher 

rate of gene transfer between different bacterial species by HGT.  This is  a main factor 



 

61  

driving the alteration of soil resistome by manure application (Stalder et al., 2012; 

Tamang et al., 2008), as ARBs in the manure may be introduced into soil and the ARGs 

they carried could be horizontally transferred to native soil bacteria and/or human 

pathogens present in soils, like Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and E. coli (Ding et al., 

2014; Forsberg et al., 2012; Gatica and Cytryn, 2013; Wang et al., 2017).  

 

1.9.3.2. Chemical fertilizers 

 

Use of chemical fertilizers is known to have a high influence on the soil bacterial 

community, particularly on bacterial species related to the nitrogen cycle.  Nitrogen fixing 

bacteria (Berthrong et al., 2014), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Ai et al., 2013), and 

denitrifiers (Tang et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2015) are affected by chemical fertilization. 

Long time application (decades) of chemical fertilization is known to alter soil bacterial 

populations (Zhou et al., 2015),  likely due to changes in soil properties. Fertilization 

significantly increased total Nitrogen, Phosphorus, NO3
-, NH4

+, and decreased soil pH. 

From these parameters, soil pH and NO3
- concentration are the most important factors 

affecting the composition of the bacterial communities. A high α-diversity in the microbial 

community is negatively correlated with NO3
- concentration and positively correlated with 

pH. The application of inorganic chemical fertilizers caused  the increase of the relative 

abundances of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Saccharibacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, 

among other taxa (Zhou et al., 2015). 

 

1.9.3.3. ARBs and ARGs uptake in crops 

 

ARB and ARGs are found naturally in soil, where they likely originated (Gibson et al., 

2015).  In turn, plants hold a large microbial diversity either adsorbed onto the surface, 

or inside the vascular system, forming communities designated as phyllosphere and 

endosphere, respectively. Soil is assumed to be the major source of endophytes, the 

entrance of which can be considered as a dynamic interaction between the plant root 

system, the rhizosphere, and soil microbiomes (Gibson et al., 2015; Reinhold-Hurek et 

al., 2015). Practices that have the potential to alter the soil microbiome can be regarded 

as a source of contamination first for the plant phyllosphere and endosphere and, 

ultimately, for the human and animal food chain, in the case of agriculture exploitation. 

Irrigation with TWW and soil amendment with manure are two agricultural practices that 

may cause such alterations in soil, plant, and food microbiomes.  

 



 

62  

In summary, there is a growing concern that the currently increasing presence of ABs in 

the environment may affect soil and plant microbiomes and that this may lead to the 

increase of antibiotic resistance of bacteria present in the human and livestock food 

chains, from soils and harvested vegetables up to the human consumers (Chen et al., 

2016; H.-W. Hu et al., 2016; Marti et al., 2013; Westhoff et al., 2017). As the fitness costs 

of the resistance to antibiotics are apparently null or very low, concentrations as low as 

1/10 the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for susceptible strains may still favour 

antibiotic resistant strains over sensitive ones in food microbiomes (Westhoff et al., 

2017).

1.10. Hypotheses 

 

The project was performed at the Institute of environmental research and Water Studies 

(IDAEA), under the supervision of Dr. Benjamin Piña and Dr. Josep Bayona. It focuses 

in soil and plant-associated microbiology, with emphasis on the impact of ABs present in 

TWW used for crops’ irrigation, the distribution of ARGs and their modulation, and the 

microbiomes dynamics correlated to TWW use and soil amendment. Therefore, there 

were two initial hypotheses. 

 

Hypothesis I: agricultural practices affect the abundance of ARGs along the soil-plant 

continuum. 

 

Hypothesis II: agricultural practices cause a shift in the bacterial communities along the 

soil-plant continuum. 

 

These hypotheses were tested using culture-independent methods. They included qPCR 

for the quantification of ARGs and next-generation sequencing methods along with 

bioinformatics approaches to analyze the DNA sequences, assessing the microbiomes 

composition, diversity, and possible shifts along the soil-plant continuum.  

 

The project was divided in three main objectives: 

 

 Quantify selected ARGs in soil, rhizospheric soil, roots, leaves, and fruits or 

beans (seeds) in different crops from real commercial fields 

 

  Detect and quantify proxies for anthropogenic impact and HGT on crop 

resistomes and microbiomes 

 

 Assess changes of soil and endophytic microbiomes related to the quality of 

irrigation water using commonly eaten plants 

 

 

Hence, as part of the MSA-ITN project, this project aimed to promote safe TWW reuse 

and agricultural practices, by generating relevant data based on validated scientific 

information.

Chapter II: Antibiotic resistance genes distribution in 

microbiomes from the soil-plant-fruit continuum in commercial 

Lycopersicon esculentum fields under different agricultural 

practices 

 

 

This chapter is based on the article:  

 

Francisco Cerqueira, Víctor Matamoros, Josep Bayona, Benjamin Piña. (2019). 

Antibiotic resistance genes distribution in microbiomes from the soil-plant-fruit continuum 

in commercial Lycopersicon esculentum fields under different agricultural practices. 

Science of the total Enviroment, 652, 660-670. 

 

 

While the presence of ARGs in agricultural soils and products has been firmly 

established, their distribution among the different plant parts and the contribution of 

agricultural practices, including irrigation with reclaimed water, have not been adequately 

addressed yet. To this end, we analysed the levels of seven ARGs (sul1, blaTEM, blaCTX-

M-32, mecA, qnrS1, tetM, blaOXA-58), plus the integrase gene intI1, in soils, roots, leaves, 

and fruits from two commercial tomato fields irrigated with either unpolluted groundwater 

or from a channel impacted by TWW, using culture-independent, qPCR methods. ARGs 

and intI1 sequences were found in leaves and fruits at levels representing from 1 to 10% 

of those found in roots or soil. The relative of intI1 sequences correlated with tetM, blaTEM, 

and sul1 levels, suggesting a high horizontal mobility potential for these ARGs. High-

throughput 16S rDNA sequencing revealed microbiome differences both between 

sample types (soil plus roots versus leaves plus fruits) and sampling zones, and a 

correlation between the prevalence of Pseudomonadaceae and the levels of different 

ARGs, particularly in fruits and leaves. We concluded that both microbiome composition 

and ARGs levels in plants parts, including fruits, were likely influenced by agricultural 

practices.

2.1. Introduction 

 

The occurrence of pathogenic bacterial strains increasingly recalcitrant to medical 

treatment with the existing ABs is becoming a worldwide concern (World Health 

Organization, 2014). AR is associated to increased hospitalization and mortality rates of 

humans and with AR-resistant zoonotics, two serious concerns for the health and welfare 

of both humans and animals (Berendonk et al., 2015; Koch et al., 2017). Moreover, the 

estimate number of deaths caused annually by ARB in the United States of America and 

in the European Union are calculated as 23,000 and 25,000, respectively 

(https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/;Freire-Moran et al., 2011). 

 

The onset of ARB, and of its worse manifestation, multi-antibiotic-resistant microbes, is 

linked to the ever-increasing presence of ABs in the environment, largely related to 

human activities (Chen et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; H.W. Hu et al., 2016; Koch et al., 

2017). ABs reach the environment mainly from excretion of treated humans and 

livestock, whose wastes contain either non-metabolized ABs or their active (or activable) 

metabolites (Marx et al., 2015). As  

WWTPs can only partially remove ABs, ARB, or ARGs (Le-Minh et al., 2010; Michael et 

al., 2013), they have been identified as relevant contributors to their total environmental 

loads. This potential risk increases when TWWs are directly or indirectly reused for 

agricultural irrigation, a practice becoming more and more frequent due to the actual 

water scarcity in many food production regions in the Mediterranean and other areas 

(Piña et al., 2018). Once ABs reach the soil, their degradation depends on soil 

physicochemical  properties and microbial activity, so they may exert a continuous 

selective pressure over soil microbiomes for long periods (Kümmerer, 2009; Pan and 

Chu, 2016; Segura et al., 2009). Plants may uptake ABs via their roots, and they are 

found in different plant parts (root, fruit, leaves), which may accumulate sub-inhibitory 

concentrations of different ABs, like tetracycline, streptomycin, and ciprofloxacin (Ahmed 

et al., 2015; Gullberg et al., 2011). As fitness costs of the resistance to ABs are apparently 

null or very low (Westhoff et al., 2017), concentrations as low as 1/10 the MIC for 

susceptible strains may still favor AB resistant strains over sensitive ones in food 

microbiomes (Westhoff et al., 2017). Therefore, and due to all this anthropogenic 

pressure, soils may turn into hotspots for ARGs. 

 

ARB and ARGs are naturally found in microbial soil communities even in unpolluted 

and/or isolated areas (Allen et al., 2010; Bhullar et al., 2012). However, there is a growing

concern that the currently increasing presence of ABs in the environment may affect soil 

and plant microbiomes and that this may lead to the increase of AR of bacteria present 

in the human and livestock food chains from soils and harvested vegetables up to the 

human consumers (Chen et al., 2016; H.-W. Hu et al., 2016; Y. Hu et al., 2016; Marti et 

al., 2013; Westhoff et al., 2017). This potential risk is increased as many AB-resistant 

genetic elements may transfer from essentially innocuous soil bacterial species to 

potentially pathogenic ones by mechanisms of HGT, thanks to their association to MGEs 

(Berendonk et al., 2015). The relevance of the presence of ARB and ARGs in food on 

the global impact of ARB in human health is currently unknown, but it is one of the major 

uncertainty factors for the use of TWW and other potential sources of ABs, ARB and 

ARGs for agricultural purposes (Becerra-Castro et al., 2015; Freire-Moran et al., 2011). 

 

The present study intends to investigate the possible influence of agricultural practices 

in the microbiome of plants and fruits grown for human consumption. To this end, we 

selected two currently operative agricultural tomato fields, one indirectly irrigated with 

TWW and a second one devoted to organic farming, irrigated with groundwater. Seven 

ARGs of clinical relevance (sul1, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, mecA, qnrS1, tetM, blaOXA-58), were 

quantified by culture-independent, qPCR methods used in samples from soil, roots, 

leaves and fruits (Berendonk et al., 2015; Bertini et al., 2007; Hembach et al., 2017; 

Tamang et al., 2008; Wielders et al., 2002). In addition, the integrase gene intI1 was 

added to the study as a diagnostic for potentially HGT activity and a marker for 

anthropogenic pollution (Gillings et al., 2015). In parallel, the composition of the bacterial 

communities present in the different samples was analyzed using high throughput 16S 

rDNA sequencing methods. The objective was to assess the effect of using TWW for 

agricultural irrigation on the occurrence and distribution of bacterial communities and of 

ARGs in soil and the edible parts of the plants. 

 

2.2 Materials and Methods 

 

2.1 Site description and sample collection 

 

Tomato crops (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Bodar) were collected in commercially 

operated fields in the delta of the Llobregat River (Catalonia, Spain, Fig. 2.1. The Zone 

1 (Z1) was located in the Littoral Mountains west of Llobregat delta, away from most 

human impact, irrigated with groundwater and/or rainwater, and fertilized with horse 

manure. In contrast, zone Z2, in the Llobregat low valley, receives water from the Infanta 



 

68  

Channel, with a considerable contribution (up to 92%) of TWW from 10 different WWTP 

effluents that discharge into the Rubí Creek. Chemical fertilizers were applied when 

needed. Soil chemical analysis were performed before cultivation and have been 

reporter elsewhere (Margenat et al., 2017; note that Z1 and Z2 correspond to plots P1 

and P3 in the Margenat paper). They show similar level of fertility to grow vegetables (N-

NO3 > 2 mg L
-1; P > 15 mg L-1; K+ > 180 mg L-1), similar eletrical conductivity (2.2–

2.8 dS m-1) and pH (7.6–7.8). Soil texture was sandy loam for both sites (Margenat et al., 

2017). Conversely, the water used for irrigation in both sites did vary in chemical 

properties, as channel water (Z2) presented higher conductivity and ammonium nitrogen 

content than groundwater, as well as higher phosphorous, solid content and nitrates, and 

similar pH (Margenat et al., 2017), Supplementary Table S1). Samples of bulk soil, roots, 

leaves, and tomato fruits, were collected from 4 plants in each plot in September of 2016, 

when fruits reached their commercial size (32 samples in total). 

 

Figure 2.1. Map of the sampling fields. Tomato plants and soil were collected in zone 1 (Z1) and 
zone 2 (Z2). 

 

2.2.2. DNA extraction 

 

Preliminary procedures for DNA extraction were performed for the plant parts as 

described (Bodenhausen et al., 2013; Qvit-Raz et al., 2008), with slight modifications. 



 

69  

Roots were vortexed for 5 s for pre-washing with 20 mL of sterilized phosphate buffered 

saline (PBS) (NaCl 0.138 M; KCl - 0.0027 M); (pH 7.4, at 25 °C), transferred to a new 

50 mL tube with 20 mL of sterilized PBS, and vortexed for 1 min, to remove contaminating 

bacteria from the soil. Tomato fruits were washed in sterilized distilled water. Leaves and 

roots were sterilized by washing in 70% ethanol for 1 min, rinsing with sterilized distilled 

water, washed again for 1 min in ethanol 70%, and rinsed with sterilized distilled water 

twice. To check the efficacy of the sterilization, the water utilized to rinse the samples the 

last time, was plated in LB agar media for three days in an incubator at 28 °C to evidence 

lack of contaminating bacteria. 

 

Preprocessed roots (5 g), leaves (6–12 g), and tomato fruits (one piece, 60–350 g) were 

macerated with mortar and pestle. During leaves maceration, 20 mL of PBS buffer was 

added. Macerated samples were then transferred to 50 mL tubes through a 100 μm mesh 

nylon Cell strainer (Corning® Cell Strainer), centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min, and the 

pellets proceeded for DNA extraction. 

 

DNA from soil samples (250 mg) and from the pellets of the different plant parts was 

extracted using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc.), to a 

final elution volume of 100 μL. The concentration and the quality of the DNA were tested 

using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer 8000 (Thermofisher Scientific, Inc). Extracted 

DNA samples were stored at −20 °C. 

 

2.2.3. Detection and quantification of ARGs copy numbers 

 

Primers for intI1, sul1 (sulfonamide resistant dihydropteroate synthase), tetM (A family 

of proteins known to bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit), qnrS1 (protein family that 

protects DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV), mecA (penicillin binding protein PBP 2a), 

blaTEM and blaCTX-M-32 (class A β- lactamases), blaOXA-58 (class D β-lactamase), and 16S 

rDNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2 (Bradford, 2001; Chen et al., 

2014; Donhofer et al., 2012; Frank et al., 2007; Tamang et al., 2008). Dynamo ColorFlash 

SYBR Green (Thermo Scientific, Inc.) chemistry was used for mecA, tetM, and blaOXA-58 

qPCR quantifications; all the other ARGs were quantified with LightCycler 480 SYBR 

Green I Master (A F. Hoffmann–La Roche AG, Inc). Two thermal cycling conditions were 

employed. For sul1, intI1, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, qnrS1, and 16S rDNA amplification: 95 °C 

for 10 min as activation step, 45 extension cycles (15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at the selected Ta, 

Supplementary Table S2). For tetM, mecA, and blaOXA-58 amplification: 7 min at 95 °C as 

activation step, 40 amplification cycles (10 s at 95 °C, 30 s at the selected Ta, 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/rotating-generator


 

70  

Supplementary Table S2). All qPCR reactions were performed in a Lightcycler 480 II (A 

F. Hoffmann–La Roche AG, Inc). Melting curves were obtained to confirm amplification 

specificity. Reactions were conducted in 20 μL volumes on 96-well plates. Optimal primer 

concentrations were 0.15 μM for tetM, mecA, and blaOXA-58 primers and 0.3 μM for sul1, 

intI1, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, qnrS1, 16S rDNA primers. All qPCR assays were run as technical 

duplicates. A fixed dilution of raw DNA extract was used. The quality criteria used was 

an R2> 0.99, the slope of the standard curve should be between −3.1 and −3.4, the 

accepted efficiency of the reactions was ranging from 90% to 110%. 

 

2.2.4. Data analysis for ARGs and intI1 

 

The analysis of the ARGs profile and abundance was performed in the R environment 

(version 3.4.0;http://www.r-project.org/). Due to the amplification of chloroplastidial and 

mitochondrial DNA, bacterial 16S rDNA copy numbers were calculated by assessing the 

proportion of reads attributed to chloroplasts and mitochondria, using the dada2 

(Callahan et al., 2016) and the phyloseq package in R (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). 

After the sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicons, quality control and taxonomy 

assignment, it was known the number of sequences attributed to bacteria, chloroplasts 

and mitochondria in each sample. The proportion of the bacterial sequences was later 

used as a rule to calculate the proportion of the 16S rDNA copy numbers from the qPCR 

reactions in the samples. Heatmaps and hierarchical clustering were performed using 

the function heatmap2, from the R package gplots (https://CRAN.R-

project.org/package=gplots). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed with 

the function principal, from the package psych (https://cran.r-

project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html). The distribution of genetic elements across 

different sample types and sampling zones was analyzed by the Analysis of Variance 

(ANOVA) plus Tukey's B post-hoc correction for multiple tests, using logarithmic values 

to meet normality requirements (Levene's test) with the multcomp R package (Hothorn 

et al., 2008). Significance levels were set at p ≤ 0.05. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant 

Analysis (PLS-DA) was performed using the function plsda from the R package 

mixOmics (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mixOmics). 

 

2.2.5. 16S rDNA library preparation and sequencing 

 

A pooled library of 16S rDNA amplicons from the 32 samples was prepared from the soil 

and plant DNA samples using 331F- and 518R-primers. PCR protocols were adapted

from (Bernstein et al., 2015), with the preparation involving two PCR steps. The first step 

added overhangs to the 16S rDNA amplicons, using the following thermal cycling 

conditions: 1 min at 98 °C for activation followed by 10 cycles of amplification (30 s at 

94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C for 30 s, 1 min at 72 °C), plus 10 min at 72 °C for completing the 

extension reaction. The second PCR step added the Illumina universal sequence 

barcodes under the following thermal cycling conditions: 98 °C for 1 min followed by 10 

amplification cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 1 min touchdown step from 68 °C to 56 °C, plus a final 

1 min at 72 °C), and the final extension step as above (Bouwmeester et al., 2016). The 

composed, tagged sample was mass sequenced at the Centre for Genomic Regulation 

(Barcelona, Spain) (http://www.crg.eu/), using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (300 bp, 

Multiplex sequencing). Quality control of the sequences was done using FastQC 

(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and TrimGalore! 

(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). Sequences were 

quality trimmed with TrimGalore! for a minimum Q score of 30. The taxonomic 

assignment of OTUs was performed using the dada2 package with SILVA database v128 

in the R environment, fixing a 97% sequence similarity as a threshold. Raw sequences 

were deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) 

under the accession number SRP133154. 

 

2.2.6. Analysis of bacterial communities and relationship with ARGs 

 

The analysis of microbial communities was performed with R environment, with the 

packages phyloseq, VennDiagram (https://cran.r-project.org/package=VennDiagram), 

vegan (https://cran.r-project.org/package=vegan), and mixOmics. OTUs abundances 

were log transformed for analysis. PLS-DAs were used to maximize the separation 

between classes of factors (sample types, sampling zones), and to understand which 

variable OTUs carry group-separating information. Plastid DNA sequences were 

excluded from the analyses. To increase the depth of the sequence analysis, reads from 

the four replicates from each site and sample type were added. Correlations between 

genetic element abundances (in copies per g of sample) and OTU prevalence (relative 

abundances, fraction of total reads per sample) were analyzed using the non-parametric 

Spearman's test plus the false discovery ratio (FDR) correction for multiple tests, also in 

R, and setting p ≤ 0.05 as significance level. The non-parametric test was preferred given 

the different distributions of the two sets of data. OTUs were grouped at the taxonomic 

family level.

2.3. Results 

 

2.3.1. ARGs quantification and distribution 
  

Bacterial 16S rDNA, intI1, blaTEM, and tetM were detected in all samples analyzed, 

whereas blaOXA-58 and mecA were only found in 53% and 38% of samples, respectively 

(Table 2.1). Bacterial 16S sequences, considered as a proxy for bacterial abundance, 

were found at counts from 2.9 × 108 to 8500 copies g-1 of sample, whereas intI1, a 

measure of MGEs, was found at approximately at 1000 times lower levels (2.9 × 105 to 

3 copies g-1 of sample, Table 2.1). Among ARGs, abundance levels varied in several 

orders of magnitude, being blaTEM the most prevalent one (1.2 × 10
7 to 340 copies g-1 of 

sample, Table 2.1). All other ARGs were found at much lower levels in fruits, if not below 

the limit of detection (Table 2.1, Fig. 2.2). The abundance of blaTEM clearly exceeded the 

levels of intI1 by a factor of 100 or even more, whereas the rest of ARGs were found at 

counts generally below intI1 levels. Thus, the data suggests that blaTEM is widespread in 

the bacterial population, and not necessarily linked to MGEs or, at least, not to intI1.

Figure 2.2. Relative abundances of the different genetic elements in all samples. Data are expressed as copies 
of each sequence per g of tissue (log10 values). Fruit, Leaf, Root, and Soil samples are labelled as Fr, Le, Ro, 
and So, respectively and color-coded depending on the zone: pink, cyan, yellow and brown for Z1 and red, 
green, orange, and deep red for Z2. Lowercase letters a to d indicate statistically different groups of data 
(p < 0.05, Tukey HSD test). 

 

The distribution of the different genetic elements among sampling zones and plant parts is 

summarized in Fig. 2.2 Surprisingly, 16S gene abundance values were relatively similar in soil and 

plant parts in both zones, and they differed very little between zones (see letters at the top of the 

graphs, representing statistically different value distributions). In contrast, levels of intI1, tetM, sul1, 

blaTEM, and blaOXA-58 (the latter only for Z2) showed a clear gradient from a maximum in soil samples 

to significantly lower levels in fruits (Fig. 2.2). These results indicate that endophytic bacteria were 

essentially as abundant as soil bacteria, although they presented a considerable lower level of MGEs 

(20–22,000 times less, Fig. 2.2, mean the log scale). ARGs show very different distributions, from 

being more or less uniformly distributed among samples (considering value dispersion), like blaTEM, 

mecA, or qnrS1, to showing significant differences between zones (tetM) and/or between soil and 



 

74  

plant parts (tetM, sul1, blaOXA-58 in Z2, Fig. 2.1). Note that blaCTX-M-32 showed a unique distribution 

pattern, as its abundance in soil was higher in Z1 than in Z2 (Fig. 2.1). 

 

The mutual correlation between genetic element abundances, zones and sample types was further 

analyzed by PCA (Fig. 2.3). The first PCA component, PC1, explaining 39% of the total variance, 

clearly separated sample types (Fig. 2.3 A), whereas the second component PC2 (21% total 

variance) grossly separated samples from Z1 and Z2 (circles and triangles in Fig. 2.3 A). Loading 

plots (arrows and genetic element names in Fig. 2.3) indicate that ARGs and intI1 were associated 

to soil and root samples. Bacterial 16S gene abundance showed a strong contribution only to PC2, 

and did not show any particular association to any defined group of sample types (Fig. 2.2). Fig. 2.2 

B indicates the correlations between the tested genetic elements, showing the strong positive 

correlations between intI1 and the ARGs blaTEM (r = 0.80), tetM (r = 0.84), and sul1 (r = 0.89), and 

much weaker correlations with the rest of ARGs. Note the essentially nil correlation between bacterial 

16S abundance and the prevalence of either intI1 or the different ARGs, except for a rather weak 

correlation with qnrS1, suggesting that these correlations do not simply reflect variations in bacterial 

abundance among the different zones and sample types.

2.3.2. Microbiome Analysis 

 

A total of 4895 OTUs were detected from a total of 7,124,468 readings in 32 samples with a median 

sequencing depth of 230,348.5 reads per sample after quality control (range 70,176 to 300,977). 

One out of three OTUs (1644) were common to Z1 and Z2 zones, whereas the remaining two- thirds 

were almost equally distributed between both sampling zones (Supplementary Fig. S2.1 A). Only 5% 

of OTUs (248 OTUs) were only found in the soil samples, a similar fraction as the number OTUs 

found in all sample types (Supplementary Fig. S2.1 B). Leaves and fruits shared 37.6% of their 

OTUs, whereas only 27% of OTUs found in roots were also found in soils (Supplementary Fig. S2.1 

C–E). As many OTUs showed relatively low number of occurrences in many of the samples, we 

opted to group them at the taxonomic family level for all further analyses. Fig. 2.4  shows the relative 

abundances of the 20 most prevalent OTU families for all samples. Note that only seven families 

(Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Comamonadaceae, 

Enterobacteriaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae) represent >10% of the total reads in at least one 

sample (Fig. 2.3)  

Figure 2.4. Relative abundance of the 20 most prevalent OTUs families. Values represent the fraction of reads 
corresponding to a given family for the total reads obtained from each sample type and zone; plastid sequences 
were excluded from the analysis. Zone and sample types were color-coded, as indicated at the top of the 
graph.

Hierachical clustering of samples based on their relative abundance in OTUs families reveals two 

major clusters of samples, one including roots and soil samples and a second one including leaves 

and fruits, whereas the distinction between zones appeared less clear (Fig. 2.5, dendrogram on the 

left). These data can be interpreted as a colonization of roots by soil bacteria, as well as indicating 

the existence of a common microbiome for the aerial parts of the plants. 

 

Predictive PLS-DA analyses were used to investigate the individual contribution of different bacterial 

families to discriminate between Z1 and Z2 microbiomes, on one side, and between aerial 

(fruits + leaves) and underground bacterial populations (soil + roots), on the other. Both models 

explained >50% of the OTUs abundance variations (Fig. 2.6). The first model (Fig. 2.6 A) shows that 

only four families with high prevalence (Comamonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxellaceae, 

and Pseudomonadaceae), numbers 14, 20, 38, and 52 in the orange area in Fig. 2.6 A, (note the 

relative size of the circles) were associated to underground samples, whereas aerial plant parts 

associated to a large number of less prevalent OTU families (Fig. 2.6 A, small grey circles). In 

contrast, both high and low abundance OTU families contributed to differentiate between Z1 and Z2 

samples in the second model (Fig. 2.6 B). Z1 samples were associated to high proportions of 

Enterobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae (numbers 20 and 23 in Fig. 2.6 B), whereas the largest 

OTU group related to Z2 samples was the Pseudomonadacea family (number 52 in Fig. 2.6 B).

2.3.3. Analysis of the influence of the plant microbiome on ARG loads 

 

The mutual correlations between OTU abundance and ARG prevalence values in plant 

and soil samples is shown in the correlation map in Fig. 2.7  A. Only OTU families with 

at least one significant correlation with at least one ARG or intI1 are represented. 

Hierachical clustering defined a subset of genetic elements (intI1, sul1, and tetM, see 

also Fig. 2.5) with strong positive correlations with a small subset of mostly abundant 

bacterial families (Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, red cells in 

Fig. 2.7 A). Another subset of three ARGs (blaTEM, blaOXA-58, and qnrS1) showed weaker 

positive correlations only with Pseudomonadaceae (Fig. 2.7 A), whereas many bacterial 

families showed negative correlations with the presence of the same genetic elements 

(Fig. 2.7 A, blue cells). Bacterial families showing strong positive correlations with the 

measured genetic elements appeared associated to soil/roots samples in the PLS-DA 

shown in Fig. 2.6 A, whereas essentially all families with negative correlations associated 

to fruit/leaves samples in the same analysis (brown and cyan sectors in the left sidebar 

in Fig. 2.7 A, respectively). Both positive and negatively-correlated bacterial family 

clusters include families associated with Z1 and Z2 in the PLS-DA from Fig. 2.6 B (light 

and dark green sectors in the right sidebar in Fig. 2.7 A, respectively), whereas 

Pseudomonadaceae was the only Z2-associated bacterial family showing strong positive 

correlations with ARGs (Fig. 2.7 A).

Figure 2.7. Correlation between genetic element abundance and microbiome compositions. 
Heatmaps represent Spearman correlation matrices between the abundance of genetic elements 
(represented as copies per bacterial 16S rDNA copy in each sample) and prevalence of OTUs 
families, as relative proportion of the total sequences found in each zone and plant part, for the 
whole dataset (A) or when considering only fruit and leaf samples (B). Red and blue squares 
represent positive and negative correlations, respectively. One, two, or three asterisks indicate p-
values lower than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively (Spearman correlation, False Discovery 
Rate correction). Dendrograms correspond to a Euclidian hierarchical clustering of OTUs and 
genetic elements. Vertical sidebars represent PLS-DA loadings (Fig. 2.6, first component). The 
left sidebar corresponds to the plan part discrimination model (Fig. 2.6 A); cyan and brown sectors 
indicate OTU families associated to aerial parts and to underground samples, respectively. The 
right sidebar corresponds to the zone discrimination model (Fig. 2.6 B); lighter green sectors 
indicate OTUs families strongly associated to Z1, dark green sectors corresponded to OTUs 
families predominantly associated to Z2. 

 
 

A similar correlation analysis using only data from fruits and leaves' samples showed 

quite different correlations between genetic elements and bacterial families (Fig. 2.7 B). 

In this case, a subset of four genetic elements (intI1, blaTEM, blaOXA-58, and sul1) showed 

strong positive correlations with a cluster of nine bacterial families, including again 

Pseudomonadaceae as the most abundant taxon (Fig. 2.7 B). Note that, except for the 

Pseudomonadaceae family, the rest of bacterial families included in this cluster scored 

as “fruit + leaves”-associated taxa in the PLS-DA from Fig. 2.6 A (cyan sectors in the left 

sidebar in Fig. 2.7 B), and almost equally divided between zone Z1 and Z2-associated 

taxa (light and dark green sectors in the right sidebar in Fig. 2.7 B). Conversely, most 

OTU families showing negative correlations with the same genetic elements scored as 

“soil+roots”-associated taxa (brown sectors in the left sidebar in Fig. 2.7 B), again, with 

no clear prevalence for Z1 or Z2-associated taxa. 

 

The rest of ARGs not strongly linked to intI1 showed somewhat weaker correlation with 

different OTU families, except for blaCTX-M-32, which showed a strong correlation with a 

relatively minor family, Aeromonadaceae (Fig. 2.7 B), and weaker, but significant direct 

associations with another cluster of five bacterial families. In this case, most of these 

families were associated to Z1 (light green sectors in in the right sidebar in Fig. 2.7 B). 

The situation was reversed for taxa showing negative correlations with blaCTX-M-32, most 

of them associated to Z2 (dark green sectors in the middle sidebar in Fig. 2.7 B). The 

correlations between tetM loads and specific OTU families were somewhat weaker, with 

positive correlations with taxa associated to Z2 and to plant parts, and negative ones 

with families associated to Z1 and soil (Fig. 2.7 B). The two remaining ARGs (mecA and 

qnrS1) showed no convincing correlation with any OTU taxon (Fig. 2.7 B). Some of the 

significant correlations between genetic elements and the relative abundance of selected 

bacterial families are shown as binary plots in Supplementary Fig. S2.2.

2.4. Discussion 

 

Plant-associated microbiomes are rapidly becoming a major topic of interest for the 

scientific community, due to the recent realization of its complexity, prevalence, and 

fundamental roles for plant physiology, mainly thanks to the implementation of culture-

independent quantitative methods (Berg et al., 2014; Hardoim et al., 2008; Reinhold-

Hurek and Hurek, 2011; Ruppel et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2008). These studies 

demonstrate that endophytic bacteria actively participate in many plant functions, in 

some cases actively promoting plant growth and health (Hardoim et al., 2008).  

 

Our finding that the abundance of bacterial 16S sequences in the different plant parts is 

of the same order of magnitude that the corresponding values in soils (between 104 and 

108 copies per gram of tissue) is consistent with previous estimates using comparable 

methodologies (Ruppel et al., 2006). Bacteria in plants can be associated to three major 

compartments, rhizosphere, endosphere and phyllosphere. Rhizosphere is considered 

as the portion of soil whose microbial community is directly influenced by plant 

metabolism. Endosphere includes inner plant tissues, whereas the phyllosphere is 

composed by microbial cells able to colonize plant surfaces (reviewed in (Andreote et 

al., 2014)). These different habitats are differentially represented in our samples, as root 

samples are likely influenced by the rhizospheric microbiome, whereas leaves and fruits 

include both endospheric and phyllospheric bacteria. We choose not to actively eliminate 

epiphytic bacteria from fruit samples, as these bacteria are likely to remain into the final 

commercial product up to the end consumers. While endophytes are part of the normal 

and healthy inner environment for plants, it is clear that they can include both human 

pathogens and can act as vectors of spreading ARGs and other potentially dangerous 

genetic elements (van Overbeek et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2017). This is particularly 

relevant when crops are in contact with human and animal farm residues, either by 

watering using TWW or by manure fertilization (Becerra-Castro et al., 2015; Ben et al., 

2017; Han et al., 2016; Marti et al., 2013; Piña et al., 2018; Westhoff et al., 2017). We 

found a higher prevalence of intI1 in soil and roots than in aerial parts of plant, with very 

little differences between sampling zones, indicating that their abundance was not 

influenced by the different agricultural practices in Z1 (virtually organic farming irrigated 

with groundwater) and in Z2 (regular farming irrigated with TWW). We also found a close 

correlation between the abundance of intI1 and tetM, sul1, and blaTEM in leaf and fruit 

samples. The association between the presence of sul genes in environmental samples 



 

85 

and human activity has been repeatedly observed (Muziasari et al., 2014; Pruden et al., 

2012), as well as the correlation between intI1, sul1 and tet genes in reclaimed water 

(Gillings et al., 2015). We interpret our data as an indication for a connection between 

intI1 and the presence of multi-resistant bacteria in the bacterial communities in the 

sampled agricultural fields. 

 

Our analysis of the bacterial 16S sequences indicates that microbiomes in the aerial 

plant parts were more complex and enriched in low-abundance OTUs than soil or root 

microbiomes, which showed a clear prevalence of a restricted number of families. 

Although it is difficult to establish a direct correlation with the present data, it is tempting 

to relate the different taxon distribution in these prevalent taxa in soils and roots from 

zones Z1 and Z2 (Enterobacteriacea and Flavobacteriaceae versus 

Pseudomonadaceae, respectively) to the different regimes of fertilization and irrigation 

for both zones (horse manure and ground/rainwater for Z1, chemical fertilizer and TWW 

for Z2). 

 

We observed strong positive and negative correlations between the prevalence of intI1 

and different ARGs in the different samples and the respective abundance of different 

OTUs. Using the whole dataset, positive correlations corresponded to soil-associated 

bacterial families, and they include some of the most abundant ones, like 

Enterobacteriacea and Pseudomonadaceae. In fact, the abundance of 

Pseudomonadaceae appears as a major determinant of the presence of at least four out 

of the eight analyzed genetic elements. We interpret the absence of significant 

correlations with the rest of the genetic elements to their more or less even distribution 

among bacterial families. This is particularly true for blaTEM, the most prevalent ARG 

found in the whole dataset and whose prevalence exceeded that of intI1, for example. 

When a similar analysis was performed only with plant- associated samples (fruits and 

leaves), the picture was rather different. On one side, both soil- and plant-associated 

bacterial families showed direct correlations with at least three sets of genetic elements. 

The most prevalent group, formed by intI1, blaTEM, blaOXA-58, and sul1, correlated to the 

presence of mainly plant-associated families, with the exception of Pseudomonadaceae. 

This suggests that these ARGs may be associated with specific endophytic taxonomic 

groups. Two more ARGs, sul1 and tetM, also showed significant, and unrelated, 

correlations with specific taxa, both soil- and plant-associated ones. Many of these taxa 

belong to the Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria classes reported to harbor plasmids, 

found to be vectors for several ARGs in WW environments (Vaz-Moreira et al., 2014; 



 

86 

Zhang et al., 2011). Resistance to different class of ABs may be potentially encoded in 

the same MGE. For instance, plasmids encompassing different ARGs have been 

detected in environmental samples with anthropogenic impact, namely, marine 

aquaculture (Muziasari et al., 2014; Nonaka et al., 2012). In addition, the association 

between intI1 and sul genes has been repeatedly observed (Hu et al., 2008; Pruden et 

al., 2012), as well as the correlation between intI1, sul1 and tet genes in reclaimed water 

(Gillings et al., 2015). Therefore, the results suggest that at least these ARGs may be 

present in the same MGE in our samples, favoring the presence of multi-resistant 

bacteria. 

 

2.5. Conclusions 

 

Our results show a complex interrelationship between soil and plant microbiomes, ARGs 

prevalence, and farming activities. A subset of ARGs, and particularly blaTEM and sul1, 

seems to be relatively unaffected by the use of TWW for irrigation, whereas tetM, mecA, 

and blaOXA-58 showed higher levels in Zone 2 than in Zone 1. Similar selective effects are 

found when analyzing the soil and plant microbiomes: only a defined subset of taxa 

appear to be affected by agricultural practices, particularly Pseudomonadaceae and 

Enterobacteriaceae in soils. While our data indicate that the microbiome structure and 

ARGs content in edible parts were modulated by the soil microbiome, only 14% of 

detected OTUs were shared by aerial and underground samples. 

 

Soil composition, aeration, and fertilization regime may also influence microbiomes and 

ARG contents. While the results on ARG and microbiome composition represents a 

further support on the role of agricultural practices in ARG dissemination, further 

research using carefully controlled conditions is required to determine the relevance of 

the quality of the irrigation water and of other agricultural practices in the observed 

spread of ARGs worldwide.

Chapter III:  Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in soils 
and crops. A field study in legume plants (Vicia faba L.) grown 
under different watering regimes 

 
 
This chapter is based on the article: 
 
Francisco Cerqueira, Víctor Matamoros, Josep Bayona, Goffe Elsinga, Luc M. Hornstra, 

Benjamin Piña. (2019).  Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in soils and crops. A 

field study in legume plants (Vicia faba L.) grown under different watering regimes. 

Environmental Research, 170, 16-25. 

 

 

Social concern has raised during the last years due to the development of AR hotspots 

in different environmental compartments, including the edible parts of crops. To assess 

the influence of the water quality used for watering, we collected samples from soil, roots, 

leaves and beans from the legume plant V. faba (broad beans) in three agricultural peri-

urban plots (Barcelona, NE Spain), irrigated with either groundwater, river water, or 

reclaimed water. ARGs sul1, tetM, qnrS1, blaCTX-M-32, blaOXA-58, mecA, and blaTEM were 

qPCR, along with 16S rDNA and intI1 sequences, as proxies for bacterial abundance 

and integron prevalence, respectively. Microbiome composition of all samples were 

analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Results show a gradient of bacterial 

species diversity and of ARG prevalence from highly diverse soil samples to microbially-

poor beans and leaves, in which Rhizobiales essentially displaced all other groups, and 

that presented very small loads of ARGs and integron sequences. The data suggest that 

the microbiome and the associated resistome were likely influenced by agricultural 

practices and water quality, and that future irrigation water legal standards should 

consider the specific Physiology of the different crop plants.

3.1. Introduction 

 

AR hotspots occur in essentially all environmental compartments subjected to 

anthropogenic pressure, such as WWTPs, pharmaceutical manufacturing plant effluents, 

and aquaculture facilities (Michael et al., 2013). While the reuse of polluted water from 

these sites represents a number of benefits, and that major advances have been made 

with respect to producing safe treated effluents, there are a number of issues that have 

to be solved before using reclaimed water in a general basis. Currently operating 

WWTPs fail to completely remove ABs, ARBs, and ARGs (Le-Minh et al., 2010; Manaia 

et al., 2018; Michael et al., 2013). Therefore, the use of reclaimed water in agriculture 

may favor the dissemination of ABs, ARB, and ARGs in the environment (Ben et al., 

2017). 

 

The proliferation of ARB and ARGs is frequently associated with MGEs, being a relevant 

example gene cassettes present in integrons (Domingues et al., 2012). Class 1 integrons 

are widely reported in pathogens from clinical settings, carrying gene cassettes 

associated with antibiotic resistance, and can be found in plasmids or associated with 

transposons, allowing their dissemination through HGT (Gillings et al., 2008; 

Labuschagne et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006; Lind et al., 2006; Mendes et al., 2007). 

Integrons have been recently detected in microbial species from many different 

environments, including WW (Tennstedt et al., 2003), river water (Mukherjee and 

Chakraborty, 2006), and soil (Agerso and Sandvang, 2005). This suggests that the 

dissemination of integrons may be a general problem of environmental pollution and 

public health (Stokes et al., 2006). 

 

HGT frequency is determined by two complementary main barriers: Phylogeny and 

Ecology. Considering antibiotic exposure as a source of selection, ecology provides a 

physical barrier, as donor and recipient bacteria have to be in the same niche for HGT to 

occur. Once this physical barrier has been broken, phylogeny determines the HGT 

network of ARGs and other transposable elements, as intra-taxon genetic exchange 

occurs more often than inter-taxon (Y. Hu et al., 2016). Microbial communities in natural 

environments harbor ARB and ARGs, even in unpolluted and/or isolated areas (Allen et 

al., 2010; Bhullar et al., 2012). Selective pressure on these environments, as it may occur 

by the incorporation of antibiotics from different farming practices, may increase the 

abundance of ARB in soil microbiomes (Chen et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hartmann et 

al., 2015; Heuer et al., 2011; Y. Hu et al., 2016). This effect may in turn lead to the 

subsequent increase of antibiotic resistance levels on soils and in harvested vegetables

(Han et al., 2016; Marti et al., 2013; Westhoff et al., 2017), which may ultimately result in 

an impact in human health (Becerra-Castro et al., 2015). The estimate number of deaths 

caused annually by ARB in the United States of America and in the European Union, 

calculated as 23,000 and 25,000, respectively (https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/, 

(Freire-Moran et al., 2011), but the relevance of the presence of ARB and ARGs in food 

in these figures is currently unknown. 

 

In this work we surveyed seven ARGs of environmental and clinical relevance (sul1, 

blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, mecA, qnrS1, tetM, and blaOXA-58) together with the integrase intI1, 

diagnostic for potentially HGT activity and marker of anthropogenic pollution (Berendonk 

et al., 2015; Bertini et al., 2007; Gillings et al., 2015; Hembach et al., 2017; Tamang et 

al., 2008; Wielders et al., 2002). Both integrons and ARGs have been found associated 

to MGEs in crop fields (Berendonk et al., 2015), and in edible vegetables (Hu et al., 2008; 

Nonaka et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015). In a previous study, we found a gradient of 

microbial species and ARB-related genetic elements along the soil-plant-fruit continuum 

in commercial tomato crops grown under different water regimes, and found a correlation 

between the presence of ARGs in fruits and the soil and plant microbiome composition, 

which are, in turn, under the influence of agricultural practices (Cerqueira et al., 2019b). 

Here we present a comparable study using a very popular legume crop, the broad bean 

V. faba, which, contrary to tomatoes, is consumed generally (but not always) cooked, 

once removed from the pod. The study was carried out in three farm fields, two of them 

indirectly irrigated with TWW, and a rural organic farming plot irrigated with groundwater, 

all located at less than 30 km from Barcelona (Spain). Our main goal is generating a 

predictive model allowing the classification of the sampling zones as control or polluted 

areas, incorporating to it as many different types of crops and different water qualities as 

possible, always within the current EU regulation for crop irrigation and soil amendment 

procedures. 

 

3.2. Materials and Methods 

 

3.2.1. Site description 

 

Broad beans crops were collected in agricultural fields in the delta of the Llobregat River 

(Catalonia, Spain, Fig. 3.1). The reference zone (Z1) was located in a field near Cabrera 

de Mar, northeast of the Barcelona metropolitan area, away from most human impact, 

irrigated with groundwater, and fertilized with local pigeon manure. In contrast, zone Z2, 

https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/#_blank


 

95 

in the Llobregat low valley, receives water from the Infanta Channel, which is mainly fed 

by TWW from 10 different WWTP effluents that discharge into the Rubí Creek, 

representing about 92% of the total water flow Z3 was irrigated with river water also 

impacted by WWTPs (see map as Fig. 3.1), but in this case TWW represented less than 

18% of the water flow (Marcé et al., 2012). Z2 and Z3 applied chemical fertilizers when 

needed. Broad beans plants were collected in April of 2017, when they reached their 

commercial size. The samples included bulk soil, roots, leaves, and beans, removed 

from the pod. Plants were collected in a systematic random sampling scheme, in which 

each collection site was divided into five equal sections. One plant (roots, leaves, and 

broad beans) and a soil sample were collected per each sampling site (Z1, Z2, Z3) and 

section (five sections per site), 60 samples in total. Samples were collected into sterile 

plastic containers, and, within few hours, transported on ice to the laboratory, where they 

were processed and total DNA was extracted. 

 

Figure 3.1. Geographic location of the sampling sites. 

 

3.2.2. DNA extraction 

 

Preliminary procedures for DNA extraction were performed as described (Bodenhausen 

et al., 2013; Qvit-Raz et al., 2008) with slight modifications. Broad beans were washed 

in sterilized distilled water. Roots and leaves samples in addition had their surfaces 

sterilized by washing in 70% ethanol for 1 min, rinsing with sterilized distilled water for 



 

96 

1 min, washed again in ethanol 70%, and finally rinsed with sterilized distilled water twice. 

Samples from the water used to the last rinse were plated in LB agar media for three 

days in an incubator at 28 °C to evidence lack of contaminating bacteria. Leaves, roots, 

and broad beans seeds were macerated with mortar and pestle, adding 20 mL of PBS in 

the case of leaves, and transferred to 50 mL tubes, through a 100 µm nylon Cell strainer 

(Corning® Cell Strainer). The samples were centrifuged in an Eppendorff Centrifuge 

5804 R (Eppendorf, AG) at 4500 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were discarded, and 

the pellets (about 250 mg) processed for DNA extraction using the Qiagen DNeasy 

PowerSoil kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), to a final elution volume of 100 μL. The 

concentration and the quality of the DNA were tested using a NanoDrop 

Spectrophotometer 8000 (Thermofisher Scientific, Inc, Waltham, MA). Extracted DNA 

samples were stored at − 20 °C until further use. 

 

3.2.3. Detection and quantification of ARGs copy numbers 

 

Primers for intI1, sul1, tetM, qnrS1, mecA, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, blaOXA-58, and bacterial 16S 

rDNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S3.1 (Bradford, 2001; Chen et al., 

2014; Donhofer et al., 2012; Frank et al., 2007; Mugnaioli et al., 2006; Tamang et al., 

2008). Dynamo ColorFlash SYBR Green (Thermofisher Scientific, Inc.) chemistry was 

used for mecA, and blaOXA-58 qPCR quantification; all the other ARGs were quantified 

with SYBR green (A F. Hoffmann–La Roche AG, Inc, Switzerland) in a Lightcycler 480 (A 

F. Hoffmann–La Roche AG, Inc). Thermal cycling conditions differed for both 

technologies: 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and Ta for 1 min for the first 

one, and 95 °C for 7 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s and Ta for 30 s for the second one. 

All qPCR reactions were performed in a Lightcycler 480 II (A F. Hoffmann–LaRoche AG, 

Inc). Melting curves were obtained to confirm amplification specificity. Optimized primer 

concentrations were 0.15 μM for tetM, mecA, and blaOXA-58 primers, and 0.3 μM for sul1, 

intI1, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, qnrS1, and 16S rDNA primers; qPCR reactions were performed 

by duplicates, using a fixed dilution of raw DNA extract. The quality criteria used was an 

R2 > 0.99 and an accepted efficiency of reactions from 90% to 110%. 

 

3.2.4. Standards and normalization methods 

 

Four plasmid vectors were used as standards for absolute quantification of qPCR 

amplicons. For 16S rDNA gene, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, sul1, qnrS1, intI1, purified DNA 



 

97 

samples from pNORM1 plasmid (Gat et al., 2017), were used as quantification standards 

(Supplementary Table S3.1). For tetM, blaOXA-58 and mecA, purified DNA samples from 

three different pUC19 plasmids were used as standards (Laht et al., 2014; 

Szczepanowski et al., 2009; Tamminen et al., 2011). (Supplementary Table ST3.1). 

Standard curves (Ct per log copy number) for quantification of all genes were obtained 

for each run, using 10-fold serial dilutions of the corresponding standards. Gene copy 

number of standards was determined via the plasmid/genomic DNA concentration using 

the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer 8000, applying the DNA copy number and the Dilution 

Calculator algorithm (https://www.thermofisher.com/us). Three technical replicates were 

run for the standard curves; complete reaction mixes plus nuclease free water, but no 

template, were used as negative control qPCR reactions. ARG concentration in samples 

was calculated using the standard curve equation and the measured Ct value. The 

quality control of raw Ct values for standard curve and unknown samples was performed 

before the analysis. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was defined as the lowest point on 

the linear part of the standard curve: 100 gene copies per reaction for ARGs and intI1 

and 1000 gene copies per reaction for 16S rDNA. Copy numbers of all ARGs and intI1 

were normalized to gram of sample (gene copies g-1). 

 

3.2.5. Data analysis for ARGs and intI1 

 

The analysis of the ARGs profile and abundance was performed in the R environment 

(version 3.4.0; http://www.r-project.org/). The ARGs quantified by qPCR were normalized 

by gram of sample and log transformed. PCA was performed with the function principal, 

from the package psych (https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/psych/index.html). 

One-way and two-way ANOVA tests, Tukey’B post-hoc analysis, Pearson's correlations, 

and fdr (false discovery ratio) correction for multiple tests were also performed with the 

psych package. Due to the amplification of chloroplastidial and mitochondrial DNA, 

bacterial 16S rDNA copy numbers were calculated by assessing the proportion of reads 

attributed to chloroplasts and mitochondria after sequencing the corresponding 16s 

rDNA amplicons using dada2 (Callahan et al., 2016, p. 2) and phyloseq packages in R 

(McMurdie and Holmes, 2013).

3.2.6. 16S rDNA library preparation and sequencing 

 

We prepared of a pooled library of 16S rDNA amplicons from 60 soil and broad beans 

samples’ DNA, using primers 331F-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT and 518R-

ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG (Supplementary Table S3.1). Illumina Nextera XT Index Kit 

v2 - Index 1 (i7) and Nextera XT Index Kit v2 - Index 2 (i5) adapters were used to tag the 

samples. A two-step PCR protocol was used to prepare samples. The first step added 

overhangs to the 16 s rDNA amplicons, using the following thermal cycling conditions: 

98 °C for 1 min, 8 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The 

second PCR step added the Illumina Nextera XT adapters under the following thermal 

cycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 8 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C 

for 30 s. The composed, tagged sample was mass sequenced at the KWR Watercycle 

Research Institute (Nieuwegein, Netherlands) (https://www.kwrwater.nl/), with high-

throughput sequencing, using an Illumina MiSeq. Quality control of the sequences was 

done using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). 

Illumina Nextera adapters were removed and the sequences were quality trimmed for a 

minimum Phred quality score (Q ≥ 30) with Trim Galore! 

(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). R environment was 

used for all the downstream analysis of the sequences, specifically, the dada2 package. 

Sequences shorter than 160 bp were discarded. The sequences were dereplicated and 

PCR chimeras were checked and filtered out. The taxonomic assignment of OTUs was 

done with SILVA database v128 for dada2 package. Sequences were assigned to OTUs 

based on a 97% similarity. The sequences classified as chloroplasts and mitochondria 

were removed. Raw sequences were deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive 

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under the accession number SRP151778. 

 

3.2.7. Analysis of microbiomes 

 

The analysis of microbial communities was performed with R environment (version 

3.4.0), with the packages phyloseq, vegan (https://cran.rproject.org/package=vegan), 

VennDiagram (https://cran.rproject.org/package=VennDiagram), caret (https://cran.r-

project.org/package=caret), and mixOmics (https://cran.r-

project.org/package=mixOmics). OTUs abundances were log transformed for β-diversity 

analysis.

Microbiomes variation between samples were visualized by a NMDS using Weighted-

UniFrac dissimilarity (Lozupone et al., 2007), with the functions ordinate of the Phyloseq 

package. The function adonis from Vegan package to measure effect size and 

significances on β-diversity. The betadisper function was utilized to test multivariate 

homogeneity of group variances. Taxa with a prevalence lower than 3% were excluded 

from the β-diversity analyses, in order to study the “core” microbiomes. 

 

Differences in OTU distribution between reference and TWW-impacted sampling zones 

were explored using the supervised machine learning classification technique Random 

Forest (Breiman, 2001). The data was partitioned in train and test set (70% and 30%, 

respectively) randomly splits it according the grouping classes. Absolute abundance 

values were centered and scaled. Accuracy was the metric chosen for model evaluation. 

For re-sampling a 5-fold cross validation repeated 3 times was chosen. The model was 

fitted over different tuning parameters, using the function train. Variable importance was 

measured by the Median Accuracy Decrease. The model created with the training data 

was utilized to predict the sampling fields on the test data according the OTUs 

abundances. A confusion matrix was created to evaluate the predictions. 

 

3.3. Results 

 

3.3.1. ARG abundance and distribution 

 

Bacterial 16S rDNA and blaTEM DNA sequences were detected in all samples analyzed. 

Whereas intI1, a marker for anthropogenic pollution, was found in 43% of the samples 

(Table 3.1). Bacterial 16S sequences, considered as a proxy for bacterial abundance, 

were found at counts from 140 to more than 5 × 107 copies g-1 of sample. The integron 

intI1 sequence was found at approximately 70 times lower levels even at its maximum 

amounts, at around 7.5 × 105 copies g-1 of sample (Table 3.1). Among ARGs, abundance 

levels varied in several orders of magnitude, being blaTEM the most abundant one by far, 

with counts ranging from 30 to 4 × 105 copies g-1 of sample (Table 3.1). All other studied 

ARGs were found at much lower levels or below the limit of detection (Table 3.1); mecA 

levels were below the limit of quantification in all samples (not shown). Despite having a 

prevalence of only 43%, the maximum counts of intI1 surpasses the levels of the rest of 

ARGs in samples where it was present, except for blaTEM. Thus, the data suggest that at 

least blaTEM is widespread in the bacterial population, and not necessarily linked to MGEs 

or, at least, not to intI1 (Table 3.1). 



 

100 

The distribution of genetic element abundances in the different sample types and zones 

was further investigated by two-way ANOVA ("Zone" times "Sample type", Table 3.1). 

The analysis shows a very strong influence of sample type (soil vs. root endophytes vs. 

leaves vs. beans) for all genetic elements, and for bacterial 16S abundance, whereas 

the factor "Zone" was only relevant for the most prevalent ARGs (blaTEM, sul1, qnrS1) 

and intI1 (Table 3.1). The interaction between the two factors was non-significant or very 

weak in all cases (Table 3.1). These different distribution patterns are shown in Fig. 3.2, 

which includes results from a one-way ANOVA/Tukey's B post hoc test across the 

different zones. Note the decrease in bacterial abundances from soils (106–108 copies g-

1 of sample) to roots and leaves (104–106 copies/g of sample) and to beans (104–105 

copies g-1 of sample), as well as the essentially lack of intI1 and ARG sequences in beans 

and leaves (except for some Z1 samples). In fact, blaTEM was the only ARG present in 

beans and leaves at least moderate levels (some 100 copies g-1 of sample). This genetic 

element showed, in addition, a defined distribution by zones, being more prevalent in 

samples from Z3 than in those from Z1 or Z2. This differential distribution was observed 

for all sample types, from soils to beans, suggesting that it the soil determined the final 

loads in blaTEM in the plant (Fig. 3.2). A similar pattern was observed for qnrS1, although 

the levels in bean samples in this case were too low for any meaningful statistical 

analysis (Fig. 3.2). Finally, intI1 was more abundant in soil and root samples from Z1 

than from Z2 or Z3, and too scarce in leaves and beans for statistical analyses (Fig. 3.2). 

ARGs tetM and blaOXA-58 were only found in soil samples and at low abundances in all 

cases (100 copies g-1 of sample or less, Fig. 3.2).

3.3.2. Microbiome analysis 

 

A total of 839 OTUs were annotated from a total of 3,114,367 readings, in 60 samples 

with a median sequencing depth of 57,617 (range 1,883 to 89,098) reads per sample 

after quality control. The presence of chloroplastidial and mitochondrial sequences was 

only marginal in most soil samples, but became predominant in roots, leaves and 

particularly beans samples, in which the presence of actual bacterial sequences was 

only marginal, and even absent in some leaves' samples and in most beans' samples 

(Supplementary Fig. 3.2). In fact, none of the Zone 3 beans' samples showed significant 

numbers of bacterial reads (not shown). The distribution of OTUs among the different 

samples, taxonomically grouped at the order level, is shown in the graph in Fig. 3.3. The 

graph shows a rich bacterial diversity in soil samples, whereas plant samples showed a 

clear prevalence of Rhizobiales' sequences, which started at root endophyte 

microbiomes to become clearly predominant in leaves' and beans' microbiomes (red 

sectors in Fig 3.3 note that there was no data for Z3 beans). Therefore, we concluded 

that Rhizobiales essentially displaced most of the other bacterial groups in the 

endophytic microbiome, occasionally mixed with other groups (Micrococcales in leaves 



 

103 

from Z2, Enterobacteriales in leaves from Z3, and several minor groups in beans from 

Zone 1, Fig. 3.3).

than 0.1% of the total abundance were included. The left vertical side bar indicates sample types, as brown, orange, light green and dark green represent soil, root 
endophytes, leaves and beans, respectively. The left-most bar graph shows the total number of reads included (plastid sequences were excluded), in logarithmic 
annotation. Colors indicate sampling zones, coded as in Fig. 3.1. Cell colors in red indicates the lowest values (absence of the sequences, transformed to 0.1 to allow 
log transformation) and white the highest one.



 

105 

Variations among the different soil and endophytic microbiomes were analyzed by β-

diversity and Random Forest classification analyses. The NDMS plot in Fig. 3.4 A 

(stress=0.06), based on Weighted UniFrac dissimilarity index, revealed a much higher 

dissimilarity for the OTUs from soil and roots (brown and orange symbols in Fig. 3.4A 

than for those from leaves and beans (light and dark green symbols). The contribution 

of the sampling zone on data dispersion was tested by the adonis algorithm, which 

detected significant differences in soil microbiome composition between sampling zones, 

but not for roots' or leaves' microbiomes (Table 3.2). We interpret these results as the 

demonstration that both sampling zones and sample types determine the microbiome 

composition, and that the geographical effect was only significant for soils. Fig. 3.4B 

shows the different distributions of eight representative orders among soil samples from 

the different sampling zones; the complete results from the ANOVA+Tukey's B analyses 

are shown in the Supplementary Table S3.2.

To explore the effects of agricultural practices (including irrigation water) on the 

microbiome we build a Random Forest classification model in which all samples from Z1 

(irrigated with groundwater) were confronted with all samples from Z2 and Z3 (both 

irrigated with TWW-fed effluents) combined. The Random Forest classifier validated the 

model, correctly grouping the different samples with an accuracy of 88.9% 

(Supplementary Table S3.3). The random forest model also assigned a variable 

importance score to each OTU by estimating the Mean Decrease in Accuracy. The 

highest scores (i.e., the highest importance for classification) corresponded to OTUs 

classified in the orders Sphingomonadales, followed by Rhizobiales, 

Proprionibacteriales, Pseudomonadales, Caulobacterales and Enterobacteriales (See 

Supplementary Fig. S3.2). We thus concluded that the prevalence of these orders in the 

microbiomes was significantly different in Z1 than in Z2 and Z3, although the exact driver 

or drivers behind these differences could not be determined at present.

3.3.3. Correlations between microbiome composition and ARGs abundance 
 

 

The correlations between OTU abundance (relative abundances at the order level) and 

genetic element prevalence was analyzed for all studied samples (Fig. 3.5). Only 16 

orders showed significant correlation (Pearson's correlation, fdr correction) with at least 

one genetic element. Conversely, only intI1, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32 and sul1 prevalences 

correlated with the relative abundance of one or more bacterial orders, plus the total 

amount of bacterial 16S rDNA gene (Fig. 3.5). All observed correlations were positive, 

except for the order Rhizobiales, whose relative abundance showed negative 

correlations with all five genetic elements (Fig 3.5). Complete results from the analysis 

is shown in Supplementary Table S3.4; Fig. 3.5 shows some of the most significant 

correlations, with added information about sampling zone and sample type.

3.4. Discussion 
 
 
The study of plant-associated microbiomes is gaining a lot of interest in the scientific 

community for two apparently disparate reasons. First, recent studies using of culture-

independent quantitative methods demonstrated the amazing complexity of plant 

microbiomes, as well as their complex interaction with many physiological functions of 

the plant (Andreote et al., 2014; Berg et al., 2014; Hardoim et al., 2008; Reinhold-Hurek 

and Hurek, 2011; Ruppel et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2008). Secondly, there is the suspicion 

that plant may become contaminated with toxicants or potentially pathogenic bacteria or 

bacterial genetic elements and thus become a risk for consumers, particularly linked to 

the reuse of WW for irrigations (Becerra-Castro et al., 2015; Ben et al., 2017; Han et al., 

2016; Marti et al., 2013; Piña et al., 2018; van Overbeek et al., 2014; Westhoff et al., 

2017; Zhu et al., 2017). 

 

Our results showed that the bacterial abundance in both roots and leaves (and, 

presumably, in most parts of V. faba plants) is around 1–10 % of the levels found in soils, 

a figure that is consistent with previous estimations using comparable methodologies for 

Brassica oleacea (Ruppel et al., 2006). These levels drop another 10-fold, at least, in 

beans. In addition, and with the exception of blaTEM, most of the studied genetic elements 

(intI1, ARGs) were only found in significant amounts in soil and root endophytes. These 

low values in intI1 and ARGs appear to correlate with the predominance of Rhizobiales 

in all plant compartments, likely a specific feature of legume plants. In fact, we have data 

from non-leguminous cultivars showing a radically different distribution of both 

endophytes and antibiotic resistance-related genetic elements (Cerqueira et al., 2019b). 

 

We found a higher prevalence of intI1 in soil and roots than in the aerial parts of plant, 

with significant differences between sampling zones. For example, intI1 was completely 

absent from beans' samples and showed very low representation in leaves, which 

nevertheless contained low, but significant levels of blaTEM or, in the latter, qnrS1 

sequences. These results are in line with the fact that the presence of integrase genes, 

like intI1, have been associated to a higher potential for dissemination of antibiotic 

resistance in both clinical samples and different environmental compartments 

(Domingues et al., 2012). Therefore, our results may suggest that the consumption of 

beans represents a low human health risk in terms of exposition to antibiotic resistance 

gens. Furthermore, intI1 was found at 5–10 fold higher levels in the roots and soils from 

the field irrigated with groundwater (Z1) compared to those irrigated with river water 

impacted by TWW (Z2, Z3). While this may reflect the influence of agricultural practices

(manure fertilization in the field irrigated with groundwater) in the abundance of ARGs 

and related genetic elements, as previously suggested (Cerqueira et al., 2019b; Piña et 

al., 2018). It is interesting to remark that Z1 was irrigated with groundwater, so the results 

indicated that other factors, both geographic and operational (manure application), may 

be at least equally important for the interpretation of intI1 abundance. 

 

In addition to intI1, only blaTEM and qnrS1 abundances showed clear differences between 

sampling zones. In the case of qnrS1, this variability reflects its virtual absence in Z1 

samples, whereas blaTEM showed a very consistent distribution pattern for all sample 

parts, in which the highest prevalence corresponded to Z3 samples. The abundance of 

blaTEM was similar for all plant parts, around 100–1000 copies per g of sample, and 

clearly higher than the levels on intI1 in most cases. Then, the results suggest that the 

endophytic blaTEM appears to be independent from the presence of integrons, at least to 

intI1. They also are at variance with the commonly assumed link between the presence 

of intI1 and the presence of anthropogenic-driven abundance of ARGs. The high 

abundance of blaTEM in Z3 is consistent with the observation that this ARG is prevalent in 

sediments impacted by WWTPs (O’Flaherty and Cummins, 2017). Z3 is the only 

sampling site 92% irrigated with TWW, in comparison with the 18% of TWW for Z2 and 

essentially nil for Z1. 

 

Different recent studies showed the influence of using TWW, or water with strong TWW 

contribution, in soil and roots' microbiome from non-legume plants, like L. esculentum or 

L. sativa (Cerqueira et al., 2019b; Zolti et al., 2019). Our results showing that only a small 

part of the OTUs present appeared as responsible for differentiating between fields with 

different irrigation regimes, may be due to the characteristics of the plant host, as 

previously suggested (Lundberg et al., 2012; Ofek et al., 2014; Ofek-Lalzar et al., 2014). 

In our case, it is particularly remarkable the prevalence of Rhizobiales species (mainly, 

Rhizobium spp.) in plant parts' microbiome, up to 100% of bacterial sequences from 

many leaves' and beans' samples. The presence of Rhizobiales in roots from legume 

plants is expected, as Rhizobium is known to colonize legume roots as a symbiont, 

where it fixes nitrogen in specific structures called nodules (Ferguson et al., 2019). 

However, as nitrogen fixation in legumes does not occur outside roots' nodules, their 

presence (and even predominance) in aerial parts is somewhat surprising. A previous 

study (Zgadzaj et al., 2016) found that the enrichment of symbiosis-linked root bacteria 

imposes distinctive rhizosphere, root, and nodule bacterial communities, affects the soil 

microbiome. Our results are consistent with this study, suggesting that this influence 

extends to the microbiome of surrounding soil, with relatively high levels of Rhizobiales, 



 

111 

and that it propagates to the rest of the plant, outside the nodule-root system, and 

eventually becoming the predominant, if not unique, endobacterial group. The role of this 

presence, that may be assimilated to commensalism, in plant physiology it is unclear. 

Despite nitrogen fixation cannot occur outside the root nodules, as a rule, bacteria of 

Rhizobium genus may have other functions that benefit the host plants, such as 

phosphate solubilization or phytohormone synthesis from absicic acid to auxins, among 

others (Alori et al., 2017; Ferguson and Mathesius, 2014). Our data suggests that the 

prevalence of Rhizobacteria associates to a very low level both of other bacterial types 

and of ARGs, which may have relevant meaning for both plant (as it may well allow the 

plant to fend off potentially pathogenic bacteria) and for consumer health. In fact, the 

extremely low levels of ARGs and of non-Rhizobial bacterial groups in beans, in contrast 

with the corresponding high levels in soils, suggests that the requirements for water 

quality may be lower for legume crops than for than other cultivars in terms of microbial 

food safety. TWW irrigation is currently limited for certain crops in different countries, like 

lettuces and other leafy food products in Cyprus (Kalavrouziotis et al., 2015). Whereas 

the main rationale for these limitations is the way they are consumed (i.e., raw versus 

cooked), our results suggest that the Physiology of the crop plant should be considered 

to set water standard qualities for irrigation of different edible crops (Freire-Moran et al., 

2011; Marcé et al., 2012).

Chapter IV: Antibiotic Resistance Gene distribution in 
agricultural fields and crops. A soil-to-food analysis 

 
 
This chapter is based on the paper:  
 
Francisco Cerqueira, Víctor Matamoros, Josep Bayona, Thomas U. Berendonk, Goffe 
Elsinga, Luc M. Hornstra, Benjamin Piña. (2019). Antibiotic Resistant Gene distribution 
in agricultural fields and crops. A soil-to-food analysis.  Environmental Research, 177, 
108608.  
 
 

Despite the social concern about the generalization of antibiotic resistance hotspots 

worldwide, very little is known about the contribution of different potential sources to the 

global risk. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the distribution of ARGs in soil, 

rhizospheric soil, roots, leaves and beans in tomato, lettuce and broad beans crops (165 

samples in total), grown in nine commercial plots distributed in four geographical zones 

in the vicinity of Barcelona (North East Spain). We also analyzed five soil samples from 

a nearby forest, with no record of agricultural activities. DNA samples were analyzed for 

their content in the ARGs sul1, tetM, qnrS1, blaCTX-M-32, blaOXA-58, mecA, and blaTEM, plus 

the integron intI1, using qPCR methods. In addition, soil microbiomes from the different 

plots were analyzed by amplicon-targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our data show 

a decreasing gradient of ARG loads from soil to fruits and beans, the latter showing only 

from 0.1 to 0.01% of the abundance values in soil. The type of crop was the main 

determinant for both ARG distribution and microbiome composition among the different 

plots, with minor contributions of geographic location and irrigation water source. We 

propose that soil amendment and/or fertilization, more than irrigation water, are the main 

drivers of ARG loads on the edible parts of the crop, and that they should therefore be 

specifically controlled.

4.1 Introduction 

 
 
Environmental contamination with ABs, ARBs, and ARGs is becoming a global health 

concern (Berendonk et al., 2015) ⁠, largely due to human activities (Chen et al., 2016; Han 

et al., 2016; Y. Hu et al., 2016; Koch et al., 2017). In agricultural fields the impact may 

come from the wide utilization of chemical fertilizers, or animal manure on soils (Liu et 

al., 2017), as well as from water used for irrigation (Han et al., 2016). According to the 

last UN Global Environmental Outlook, "Human illnesses and deaths due to antibiotic- 

and antimicrobial-resistant infections are increasing rapidly and are projected to become 

a main cause of death worldwide by 2050" (UNO, 2019). The same report classified ARB 

and ARGs as main pollutants for water sources, and call for the application of effective 

policies for its control in water bodies worldwide (UNO, 2019). For this reason, it is of 

maximal importance to evaluate the loads on ARB and ARGs in water supplies and to 

derive workable risk analyses from their measured prevalence and capacity to 

incorporate into the human food chain. 

 

Soil has been regarded as a rich source of ABs and ARGs, deriving from both natural 

and anthropogenic processes. Anthropogenic pressure may come from ABs used in 

healthcare or livestock that are discharged into the aquatic environment via WWTPs. 

ABs, like other organic pollutants, are only partially removed by current WWTP 

technologies (Hartmann et al., 2015; Le-Minh et al., 2010; Michael et al., 2013) ⁠. In 

addition, WWTPs have been pointed out as potential hotspots for ARBs and ARGs 

selection and for their release into the environment (Manaia et al., 2018; Pärnänen et al., 

2019).  

 

Soil amendment with animal manure is another potential source of ABs, ARBs, and 

ARGs in soil, as ABs are overused to treat animal diseases and promote growth (Martin 

et al., 2015). Applications of manure have been shown to increase the abundance of 

ARBs and ARGs in soil (Chen et al., 2016; McKinney et al., 2018; Udikovic-Kolic et al., 

2014; Xiong et al., 2015). In addition, most ABs are excreted by treated animals in active 

or activable forms (Heuer et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2012; Negreanu et al., 2012), making the 

manure a major source of ABs that can provide a selective advantage for resistant 

bacteria. Moreover, vegetables can uptake pollutants (including ABs), the concentration 

of which may be enhanced by the addition of manure or other biosolids (Christou et al., 

2019; Kumar et al., 2005; Sabourin et al., 2012). As it happens for all CECs, the capability 

AB for uptake depends on several biotic and abiotic factors, and varies among the 



 

120 

different types of crop. Fruit vegetables and cereal crops showed a lower ability for 

uptake of CECs, compared to leafy and root vegetables. Therefore, consumption of 

vegetables represents a way of exposure of bacteria carrying ARGs and pathogens 

(Berger et al., 2010; van Hoek et al., 2015). 

 

The presence of ABs in the soil may exert selective pressure over soil microbiomes for 

long periods, eventually altering their composition (Heuer et al., 2011; Kümmerer, 2009; 

Pan and Chu, 2016; Segura et al., 2009; Xiong et al., 2015). The selective pressure on 

ARB in the soil occurs at sub-inhibitory concentrations of ABs (Andersson and Hughes, 

2011), and it promotes the transfer of genes among bacteria, the so-called HGT 

(Berendonk et al., 2015)⁠. Conversely, reversion of AB resistance may occur slowly or not 

happen at all, due to compensatory mutations, low (or no) fitness cost of AB resistance 

mutations, and/or co-selection between resistance markers, among other factors 

(Andersson and Hughes, 2011). 

 

The capacity of alteration of soil microbial communities and ARG loads is not exclusive 

of organic fertilizers. Nitrogen or phosphorous chemical fertilizers may alter soil microbial 

communities by changing soil properties, among other mechanisms (Fierer et al., 2012; 

Li et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2015) ⁠. The observed effects of this type of 

fertilization in the soil resistome might be indirect, as ARG content is dependent on the 

microbiome composition (Forsberg et al., 2014). For example, Proteobacteria, 

Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, which are known to increase their prevalence in 

inorganically fertilized soils (Fierer et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015), show high HGT rates 

and therefore they may contribute to the spread of ARGs in the environment (Gibson et 

al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016). In addition, Proteobacteria usually carry broad-host range 

plasmids that promote HGT in agricultural fields (Heuer et al., 2011), whereas 

Actinobacteria appears to be one of the major sources of soil-borne ARGs (D’Costa et 

al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2017). 

 

In this and previous works, we found evidence than ARGs can reach edible parts of 

commercial crops, and that their presence and concentrations depends upon farming 

practices (Cerqueira et al., 2019a, 2019b; Manaia et al., 2018). In this work, we quantified 

their loads in the different compartments (soil, rhizospheric soil, roots, leaves, and fruits) 

of the soil-plant continuum for three different crops in different plots and geographic areas 

in the surroundings of Barcelona. These plots differ on their irrigation water sources, from 

essentially clean wells to reclaimed water, as well as on agricultural practices, from 

relatively artisanal to semi-industrial ones. We also analyzed soil samples from a nearby 



 

121 

forest, with no record of agricultural activities. We investigated the influence of all these 

different factors for the spread of seven ARGs of clinical relevance (sul1, blaTEM, blaCTX-

M-32, mecA, qnrS1, tetM, blaOXA-58), and of the integrase gene intI1, considered as a proxy 

for anthropogenic impact (Gillings et al., 2015), in soils and in plants, including their 

edible parts. We also checked the composition of the soil microbiomes, to analyze its 

correlation with ARG composition. The final objective is to evaluate the impact of the 

different agricultural practices for the risk associated to the presence of ARG in 

foodstuffs, identifying the leading factors determining their loads in the different crops. 

 

4.2. Materials and methods 

 
4.2.1. Site description and sample collection 
 
 
Lettuces (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Batavia), tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) and 

broad beans (Vicia faba L.) crops were collected in fields in the delta of the Llobregat 

River (Catalonia, Spain, Fig. 1). Plots in Z1 (lettuces and tomatoes) were located in the 

littoral mountains west of Llobregat Delta, irrigated with groundwater and/or rainwater, 

and fertilized with horse manure. Zones Z2 (lettuces and broad beans), Z3 (all three 

crops), and Z4 (broad beans) were located in the Llobregat low valley, and they were 

irrigated with water from irrigation channels, and chemically fertilized when needed. 

Previous studies reported that these channels showed significant contributions of 

Barcelona metropolitan area. This plot was irrigated with groundwater, and fertilized with 

local pigeon manure. Forest samples were collected in an area close to Z1, away from 

most anthropogenic impacts, and with no records of agricultural activities (See map in 

Fig.1). General quality parameters of the irrigation waters were measured (conductivity, 

NH4
+–N, nitrates, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, and pH), with the exception 

of Z5 (see supplementary table ST1). NH4
+–N, NO3-N were measured with Hach Lange, 

and Total Phosphorus cell tests (LCK 03, 304, 339, and 349) on a spectrophotometer 

(Hach Lange DR 1900 Portable Spectrophotometer). Measurements of water pH and 

conductivity were taken using Hach Lange sensors (Margenat et al., 2017). Lettuces 

were planted in Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4, while broad beans were planted in three zones (Z2, 

Z3, and Z5), and tomatoes were planted in two zones (Z1, and Z3). The vegetables were 

harvested when they reached their commercial size, in a systematic random sampling 

scheme, with the fields being divided in equal parts, according the number of samples 

collected in each field (Margenat et al., 2019). Lettuces were collected in May-June of 

2016 (3 plants, 12 samples per field, 36 samples in total), tomato sampling campaign 

took place in September 2016 (4 plants, 20 samples per field, 40 samples in total), and 



 

122 

broad beans plants were collected in March 2017 (5 plants, 25 samples per field, 75 

samples in total). Roots, leaves from all crops, tomato’s fruits, and beans were separated 

in the field and placed into sterile plastic containers. Bulk soil samples were collected 

near each plant, at a depth of 10 cm. Within few hours, samples were transported on ice 

to the laboratory, where they were processed and total DNA was extracted. 

Figure 4.1. Map of the sampling fields. Upper case letters indicate the type of crops sampled in 

each zone: BB, broad beans, LE, Lettuce, TO, tomato. 

 

4.2.2. DNA extraction and analyses 
 
 
DNA extraction of tomato fruits and broad beans samples were performed as described 

previously (Cerqueira et al., 2019a; Cerqueira et al., 2019b), with slight modifications 

(Bodenhausen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017). Rhizospheric soil from all roots’ crops 

was extracted as described (Bodenhausen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017), with slight 

modifications. Roots were vortexed for 5s for pre-washing with 20 mL of sterilized 

phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.138 M NaCl, 0.0027 M KCl, pH 7.4), transferred to a 

new 50 mL tube with 20 mL of sterilized PBS, and vortexed for 1 min, to extract the 

rhizospheric soil. The samples were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min, and the pellets 

proceeded for DNA extraction. DNA extraction of soil, roots and lettuce leaves was 

performed as described (Cerqueira et al., 2019a; Cerqueira et al., 2019b), with slight 

modifications. After removing the rhizospheric soil, leaves were washed in sterilized 

distilled water. To check the efficacy of the roots sterilization, the water utilized for the 



 

123 

last rinse was plated in LB agar media for three days in an incubator at 28 °C to evidence 

lack of contaminating bacteria. Pre-processed roots and lettuce leaves were macerated 

with mortar and pestle, upon addition of 20 mL of PBS buffer. Macerated samples were 

then transferred to 50 mL tubes through a 100 μm mesh nylon Cell strainer (Corning ® 

Cell Strainer). Both macerated leaves and roots were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min, 

and the pellets proceeded for DNA extraction. DNA from soil samples (250 mg) and from 

the pellets of the different plant parts was extracted using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA 

isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc.), to a final elution volume of 100 μL. The 

concentration and the quality of the DNA were tested using a NanoDrop 

Spectrophotometer 8000 (Thermofisher Scientific, Inc). Extracted DNA samples were 

stored at -20 °C. 

 

4.2.3. Quantification of ARGs and intI1 sequences by qPCR 

 

The ARGs and intI1 from lettuce samples were quantified by qPCR as previously 

described (Cerqueira et al., 2019a).The ARGs quantified by qPCR were normalized by 

gram of sample. 

 

4.2.4. 16S rDNA library preparation and sequencing 

 

The protocols used for 16S rDNA library preparation and sequencing of the tomatoes 

and broad beans campaigns were described previously (Cerqueira et al., 2019a, 2019b). 

The pooled library of 16S rDNA amplicons from the soil and lettuce samples was 

prepared as described (Cerqueira et al., 2019b). Raw sequences from lettuces field 

campaign were deposited at the NCBI BioProject archive 

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/) under the accession number PRJNA516199. 

 

4.2.5. Statistical analyses 

 

Statistical tests were performed in the R environment (version 3.4.2; http://www.r-

project.org/). PCAs were performed using the principal function from the psych R 

package (https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/psych/index.html), were one-way 

ANOVA and performed using the function heatmap2, from the gplots R package 

(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gplots). Soil microbiomes' β-diversity analysis 

was performed with R environment (version 3.4.2), with the packages phyloseq 

(McMurdie and Holmes, 2013) and vegan (https://cran.rproject.org/package=vegan). 

http://www.r-project.org/
http://www.r-project.org/


 

124 

The OTUs were pre-processed, by removing chloroplastidial and mitochondrial reads. 

OTU counts were log10 transformed before a NMDS with the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity 

index (Bray and Curtis, 1957). Effects of crop type and sampling field in soil microbiomes 

composition were analyzed using the adonis test from the vegan R package. Correlations 

between bacteria composition and AB resistance were analyzed by Spearman’s 

correlations between OTUs counts grouped at the order level and genetic elements 

(ARGs and intI1) in gene copies g-1. The false positive discovery rate (FDR) correction 

was set at p<0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), using the psych R package. 

 

4.3. Results 

 

4.3.1. ARG abundance and distribution 

 

ARG sequences were detected in all samples. The most prevalent gene was blaTEM, 

which was detected in all analyzed samples, whereas sul1 and intI1 were detected in 

85% and 78% of cases, respectively. On the contrary, blaOXA-58 and mecA were found 

only sporadically in 18% and 8% of the samples, respectively. The different 

compartments showed similar prevalence for all genes, except for fruits and beans (Table 

4.1). 

 

Table 4.1. Prevalence of different genetic elements along the soil-plant continuum 

 

 

Note that these two categories refer to a single species (tomatoes and broad beans, 

respectively), whereas the figures for rest of compartments include data from all crops. 

Despite the similar prevalence of the analyzed genes in the different compartments, their 



 

125 

relative concentrations differed in several orders of magnitude. The highest ARG and 

intI1 loads generally corresponded to soil samples, whereas the lowest values were 

found in leaves, beans and fruits (Fig. 4.2). This trend was more evident for the more 

prevalent genes, whereas low-prevalence ARGs showed more stochastic distributions 

(Fig. 4.2).  

 

The distribution of ARG and intI1 gene across plots and plant parts is displayed in the 

heatmap in Figure 4.3. Hierarchical clustering of samples defined three main clusters of 

samples. Cluster A includes samples with the lowest loads in ARGs or intI1, represented 

by orange and red sectors in the heatmap. Grey cells correspond to values below LOD 

(no PCR product obtained).  This cluster includes all samples from the broad beans plant 

(beans, leaves, and roots), and leaves and fruits from tomato samples (see the upper 

and middle column bars at the bottom of the heatmap). In contrast, cluster B, which 

corresponds to samples with the highest ARG and intI1 loads (yellow sectors in the 

heatmap), includes most soil and rhizospheric soil samples from all three crops. Finally, 

cluster C, showing intermediate ARG and intI1 loads, includes essentially all samples 

from lettuce plots, except soils, and the remaining tomato and broad beans samples, 

mostly from roots, soil and rhizospheric soil (see column bar colors at the bottom of the 

heatmap, upper and middle bars.

128 

4.3.2. Analysis of geographical and plot distribution of ARG loads 
 
 
Soil ARG abundance values showed variations of several orders of magnitude (Fig. 4.4 

A). The three most prevalent sequences (intI1, blaTEM , and sul1, see Table 4.1) were 

found at their highest values in all four lettuce plots, whereas their values were 

significantly lower in broad beans' plots (Fig. 4.4 A, statistical analysis in Supplementary 

Table S4.3). The pattern was much more complex for the less-prevalent genes. Values 

for qnrS1 abundance showed a similar trend as blaTEM, whereas mecA and blaOXA-58 

appeared only sporadically, limited to one and three plots, respectively (Fig. 4.4 A). With 

almost no exception, the forest soil sample showed the lowest levels for all ARG and 

intI1, including the absence of the three minor ARGs, tetM, blaOXA-58, and mecA (Fig. 4.4). 

The correlations between the different soil samples can be observed in the PCA in Figure 

4.4 B. The dual loadings'/scores' plot shows the clustering of samples by the type of 

culture, more than by geographic zone, as well as the very similar distribution of intI1 

and sul1 on one side, and blaOXA-58 and mecA on the other (Fig. 4.4 B). It also shows the 

similarity of soil samples from broad beans' plots with the forest soil, and the tight 

clustering of all samples from lettuce plots, irrespectively their geographic location. The 

clustering of samples by the type of crop was also observed when ARG and intI1 

abundance in plant parts (including rhizospheric soil) were analyzed by PCA (Fig. 4.4 C). 

In this case, the different score values reflected the gradient of ARG and intI1 loads from 

rhizospheric soil to fruit and beans (see the color codes in the figure), but the samples 

clustered in a very similar way as the soil samples. In both cases, PC (principal 

component) 1 reflected the loads of the most prevalent ARG and intI1, whereas PC2 

separated samples with different loads of the minor ARGs (note the opposite sense of 

PC2 in the two plots in Figures 4.4 B and C). tetM abundances in rhizospheric soils, roots 

and leaves can be explained almost solely (more than 50% explained variance) by the 

corresponding abundances in the soils of the respective plots (Supplementary Figure 

S4.1, Table 4.2). The correlations were weaker, although still significant, for sul1, blaOXA-

58, and mecA, and essentially non-significant for qnrS1 and blaCTX-M-32 (Supplementary 

Figure S4.1). The corresponding graphs are shown in Figure 5 B. Note that the 

correlations combine values from all crops for all plots and zones.

4.3.3. Soil microbiome β-diversity and ARG distribution 
 
 
Statistics of the three sequencing runs included in this paper (35 samples in total) are 

shown in the Supplementary Table S4.2. PERMANOVA analysis showed that the 

distribution of OTUs is soil microbiomes were strongly influenced by the type of crop, 

whereas the effect of the geographical origin was not significant (Table 4.3). This result 

can be visualized in the NMDS ordination plot in Figure 5, based on the Bray-Curtis 

dissimilarity, which groups by crop (shadowed polygons in Fig. 4.5) and not by 

geographic origin. Therefore, the analysis of soil microbiome composition indicates its 

strong dependence on the type of vegetable and a weak or nil influence from the 

geographical region. The correlation between microbiome composition and ARGs 

abundance in soil samples was tested by correlation analyses (Fig. 4.6). There were 

strong correlations between the abundance of the most prevalent genetic elements in 

soil samples (intI1, blaTEM, sul1, and qnrS1) and the relative proportion of specific 

phylogenetic groups (Figure 6, note that microbiome data is grouped at the taxonomic 

order levels, and only order with a total number of counts above the global mean were 

considered). It is particularly relevant the apparent link between intI1 and sul1 abundance 

and the prevalence of Pseudomonadales and Enterobacteriales in the soil microbiome 

(Fig. 4.6). It is also interesting the correlation between the abundance of tetM and the 

prevalence of the relatively rare group of Burkholderiales (Fig. 4.6, the barplot on the left 

indicates the total numbers of reads for each taxonomic order). These three orders 

include known human and animal pathogens, like Pseudomonas spp., Salmonella spp, 

Shigella spp. or Burkholdelia cepacia (Mahenthiralingam and Vandamme, 2005). Some 

relevant correlations between ARG abundances and taxon prevalence are shown in 

Supplementary Figure S4.2.

4.4. Discussion 

 
Our data shows a consistent trend on the distribution of the most abundant ARGs 

throughout the soil-plant continuum. ARG loads decreased steadily from the soil to the 

fruit, resulting in a 100- to 1000-fold dilution for most studied ARGs. The data also show 

that the concentration and composition of plant edible parts was strongly dependent on 

the soil ARGs. In our samples, the type of crop appeared as the most important factor to 

predict the ARG loads in crops' edible parts, superseding the geographical distribution 

or the quality of the water used for irrigation. A similar conclusion was reached in a 

parallel study analyzing pollutant content in a very similar set of samples of lettuce, 

tomato, cauliflower, and beans from the same geographical areas studied here 

(Margenat et al., 2019, 2017). We found similar loads of sul1, blaTEM, and intI1 copies in 

equivalent compartments for samples from all plots, including the forest soil. These 

sequences may be therefore regarded as belonging to the core resistome, present in 

essentially all analyzed soils (and therefore, all plants) of our experimental zone, 

including forest soils that have not been cultivated in at least a century. In contrast, less-

abundant ARGs, like tetM, mecA, and blaOXA-58 were only detected in particular plots. We 

consider the presence of these less-frequent ARGs as indicators of anthropogenic 

water/soil pollution, and, therefore, they should be monitored in future quality standards 

regulations for reclaimed water to be used for agricultural purposes. 

 

We are unsure about which parameters determine differences in ARG and intI1 loads 

between plots in very close geographical proximity and, likely, using the same irrigation 

water. Our previous results showed different microbiome compositions influenced the 

profile and abundance of the ARGs present, and, therefore, they shape the soil resistome 

(Cerqueira et al., 2019a, 2019b; Forsberg et al., 2014). Geography and spatial distance 

have been found to be less important shaping soil microbiomes than other local 

conditions, like pH, moisture, organic carbon, nitrogen availability, and even the type of 

crop (Burns et al., 2015; Fierer, 2017). These parameters can be modulated by 

agricultural practices (Chen et al., 2016; Fierer et al., 2012; Forsberg et al., 2014). For 

example, studies on long-term applications of chemical fertilizers showed relevant an 

increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in the soil 

microbiome (Zhou et al., 2015). These two Phyla have been linked to high HGT activity 

and ARG presence in soils, respectively (Gibson et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2017). In 

comparison, organic fertilization seems to have a stronger impact in soil ARGs loads, as 

they may increase the load of ARGs in soil and vegetables (Rahube et al., 2016) or cause 

the appearance of unique ARGs that are not present in vegetables grown in non-



 

134 

amended soil (Marti et al., 2013). Use fertilizers of fecal origin may represent an 

additional risk, as they are particularly enriched in ARBs and pathogen associated 

bacteria, like Clostridium spp., among others (Scott et al., 2018). This increase on ARGs 

and other relevant sequences in manure- or sewage-amended soil is apparently 

permanent, as it remains significant. 

 

Compared to organic and fecal-related amendments, the impact in soil and plant 

microbiomes of the use of TWW appears to be milder or negligible (Christou et al., 2017a; 

Gatica and Cytryn, 2013), even after long, multi-decade periods of wastewater irrigation 

(Jechalke et al., 2014). Our results agree with these studies, which also show a weak or 

no influence of the quality of the water used for irrigation, from clean groundwater wells 

to heavily TWW-impacted channels, in the abundance of ARGs in plants and soils. 

Unfortunately, our experimental setup, which uses real commercial plots and crops 

intended for public consumption, does not allow a precise tracking of the practices 

(amendment, fertilization, irrigation, treatments) for each plot. However, it is likely that 

similar crops are treated in similar ways, at least between relatively close areas with 

similar weather and agricultural traditions. In any case, it is clear that the nature of the 

edible plant part does have an influence of the final loads on ARG and intI1 that 

eventually reach the consumer. Lettuces tend to show higher ARG loads than tomatoes 

or beans, if only because the edible part is a leaf, rather than a fruit or a bean. On the 

other side, beans typically show low ARG and intI1 loads, as the colonization of the plant 

and of the surrounding soil by Rhizobiales appeared to limit ARG loadings in the plant 

(Cerqueira et al., 2019a). Therefore, regulations for limiting the presence of ARGs in 

irrigation waters (and likely, amendments and fertilizers) should vary according the 

characteristics of each crop. A similar conclusion was reached when considering 

pollution of reuse waters for irrigation, although in this case the capacity of evapo-

transpiration appeared to be one of the most critical parameters (Christou et al., 2019; 

Piña et al., 2018).  

 

Taken together, our results underscore the need for regulating the presence of ARGs in 

agricultural soils, as they appear as the major drivers of the load of ARGs that ultimately 

will reach the human food chain. The fact that we found a similar correlation between 

soil and plant ARGs in different crops intended for human consumption suggest that this 

may be a general feature, not only limited to our particular case. Another aspect arguing 

for this control is the presence of core resistomes, AB resistance elements that have 

been incorporated into the soil (and, consequently, into the plant) microbiome and that, 

therefore cannot be easily counter selected or eliminated from the food chain. Therefore, 



 

135 

all regulatory efforts should be focused in avoiding new resistance elements to become 

prevalent (i.e., part of the core microbiome) and therefore essentially unavoidable in the 

human and animal food chain. Even from our limited ARG subset, we found at least three 

of them related to resistance to tetracyclines, methicillin, or carbapenems. Finally, our 

results suggest that the quality of water used for irrigation, at least within the standards 

set in our area of study, has a limited influence in the total soil (and plant) resistome. 

Instead, we propose the use of biosolids for soil amendment and/or fertilization as likely 

the major determinant of the presence of ARGs and ARB in crops, a hypothesis that is 

supported by the existing bibliography (Marti et al., 2013; Rahube et al., 2016) and that 

should be taken into account in further regulations on the use of these agricultural 

practice

Chapter V: General Discussion 

 
 
The soil is the habitat for thousands of different bacteria, with up to 1010 bacteria and 

5x104 species per gram of soil (Raynaud and Nunan, 2014). It may also be a hotspot for 

HGT and AB resistance development and spread (Hu et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017). 

Agricultural soils are extremely impacted due to anthropogenic pressure, stimulating 

higher rates of HGT and AB resistance through exposure to chemical and/or biotic 

stressors, including ARBs and ARGs, compared to undisturbed soils.  

 

Pollutants reach soils as a consequence of different agricultural practices, like using  WW 

for irrigation or  amendment of soils with manure, biosolids, or chemical fertilization 

(Berthrong et al., 2014; Manaia et al., 2018; Marti et al., 2013; Michael et al., 2013; Rizzo 

et al., 2013; Sabourin et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015). While WW reuse is a popular 

method in recent years, it generates the problem of the possible contamination of soils 

and produce by ARBs and ARGs, a potential risk that has not been fully characterized 

yet.  

 

WWTPs are probable hotspots for AB resistance dissemination, since they do not 

remove completly AB, ARBs and ARGs (Manaia et al., 2018; Michael et al., 2013; Rizzo 

et al., 2013). Though, the characterization of WTTPs as an AB resistance hotspot is still 

under debate in the scientific community. The microbiomes present at each stage of the 

treatments is different and adapted to the local conditions. Nevertheless, the recipient 

river’s microbiomes are affected by the incoming WWTPs, and consequently the 

resistomes. They ressemble a mixture of the raw wastewater sources, recycled activated 

sludge, and upstream river (Quintela-Baluja, 2019). WWTPs have a stable core 

resistome, with less than 10 % of the ARGs shared with other environments (Munck et 

al., 2015). Therefore, the HGT potential is possibly lower than previously tought. In any 

case, WTTPs are a reservoir of a wide range of ARGs.  

 

The problem even increases when animal waste is used as amendment, as ABs are 

excreted in active or activable forms, therefore increasing ARBs and ARGs levels in WW 

from WWTPs (Heuer et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2012; Negreanu et al., 2012; Manaia et al., 

2018). AB resistance selection also occurs among gastrointestinal bacteria, which are 

also excreted in manure used for soil amendment (Chen et al., 2016; McKinney et al., 

2018; Udikovic-Kolic et al., 2014). Subsequently, applications of manure have been 

shown to increase the abundance of ARBs and ARGs in soil (Marti et al., 2013; McKinney 



 

142 

et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018; Udikovic-Kolic et al., 2014), and to impact the resident  

soil  microbiomes (Udikovic-Kolic et al., 2014). 

 

Development of AR hotspots in different environmental settings is a matter of growing 

social and scientific concern. Nevertheless, studies considering the fate of the ARGs 

along the soil-plant continuum and the risk of accumulation in the crops’ edible parts may 

pose to humans are still limited. Furthermore, most of the current studies conducted in 

real fields only reported effects on single compartment types. There are only a handful 

of mesocosms studies approaching the ARGs distribution over several compartments 

(Chen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2017), studying both epyphitic and 

endophytic bacteria. In the Mediterranean Basin, research on this subject has been 

mostly done in countries with frequent droughts (Israel and Cyprus) and encompassed 

the effect of TWW irrigation on ABs, microbiomes and/or ARG load in downstream 

environments (Christou et al., 2017b; Gatica et al., 2016; Gatica and Cytryn, 2013; 

Goldstein et al., 2014; Malchi et al., 2014; Marano et al., 2019; Negreanu et al., 2012).  

 

Studies on AB resistance can be performed using culture-dependent methods allowing 

enumeration of known pathogens, as well as the effects of ABs or other chemical 

compounds in their frequency and properties. However, most existent bacteria are not 

culturable, and this applies to around 99% of environmental bacteria (Amann et al., 

1995). Therefore, determination of MIC with culturable bacteria are not really 

representative of the soil microbiomes and, subsequently, the environmental AB 

concentrations able to trigger selective pressure on real soil populations cannot be 

assessed. These bacterial communities can only be studied through DNA high-

throughput sequencing techniques and bioinformatic approaches. These are the 

methods of reference when studying the effects of stressors, including ABs, on 

environmental bacteria.  

 
This Thesis evaluates microbiome modulation, ARG translocation and their co-

occurrence with anthropogenic markers  in different types of crops under different 

agricultural practices (Gillings et al., 2015). The presence of ARGs and intI1 and their 

association with bacteria within the soil-plant-continuum was analyzed in four farm plots 

located in the peri-urban area of Barcelona (NE Spain), plus two rural farm plots far away 

from the peri-urban area, and a forest soil site, considered as a pristine area (Fig. 4.1). 

These studies are presented in the Thesis as three chapters referring to ARGs, intI1, and 

microbiomes.  

 



 

143 

Chapter II and Chapter III show the analyses of the L. esculentum and V. faba crops, 

respectively. Analysis of β-diversity of L. esculentum bacterial communities showed no 

dissimilarities among the different plots (adonis test p>0.05) in any sample type. 

Nevertheless, PLS-DA analyses revealed that the taxa at the Family level was affected 

by agricultural practices, showing that certain bacterial families discriminate the plots by 

the agricultural practices applied on them. Namely, abundant families of the 

Proteobacteria Phylum (Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobactereaceae, 

Flavobactereaceae). Pseudomonadaceae were associated with soil and roots from peri-

urban fields, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae were more abundant 

rural fields. Rhizobiaceae family also contributed to the differentiation among the two 

categories of fields. Previous studies showed that Proteobacteria tend to increase in 

fertilized soils (Fierer et al., 2012; Ndayegamiye and Côté, 1989; Udikovic-Kolic et al., 

2014; Zhou et al., 2015) or in those irrigated with TWW (Broszat et al., 2014). In addition, 

our results showed that most of the ARGs and intI1 were only found in significant 

amounts in soil and root endophytes, with the exception of blaTEM. Samples from the peri-

urban field showed significantly higher abundance of tetM, blaOXA-58, and mecA, the latter 

not being detected in samples from the rural site. Pseudomonadaceae was the only 

bacterial family associated to periurban fields and showing strong positive correlations 

with ARGs in soil and roots. In addition, its abundance also correlated positively to intl1, 

blaTEM, blaOXA-58, and sul1 in fruits. 

 

Chapter III shows the effect of the agricultural practices in the ARG and bacterial profiles 

in V. faba fields. In this case, from the most prevalent ARGs, as blaTEM, sul1, qnrS1, only 

blaTEM showed a higher abundance in the edible parts from vegetables from the peri-

urban fields. In regard to bacteria profiles, taxa at the order level were used to make a 

Random Forest classification model, which was able to predict samples’ origin with an 

accuracy of 88.9% (Supplementary Table S3.2). Orders Rhizobiales, Pseudomonadales, 

Enterobacteriales, and Burkholderiales (Supplementary Fig. S3.1) were among the most 

important bacteria for the classification. All of them belong to the Proteobacteria Phylum, 

known to have species potentiality pathogenic (Mahenthiralingam and Vandamme, 2005; 

Rizzatti et al., 2017). One of the most important taxons to differentiate the rural from the 

peri-urban plots was the Rhizobiales order (Supplementary Fig. S3.2).  

 

Characteristically, V. faba crops showed fairly uniform microbiomes independently on the 

plant tissue and geographic location, despite that soil microbiome composition differed 

between sampling fields (Table 3.2). Rhizobiales were significantly more abundant in 



 

144 

rural than in peri-urban sites, whereas Enterobacteriales and Burkholderiales showed 

the opposite distribution (Fig. 3.4). Rhizobiales contributed to the soil microbiomes β-

diversity dissimilarity between soils, and their distribution suggest that their 

predominance limits the colonization of the roots by other bacteria. It may prevent or 

impair the translocation of ARGs from soils to the palt parts, as the prevalence of 

Rhizobiales correlated negatively with blaTEM, sul1, blaCTX-M-32, and intI1.  This result is 

consistent with a previous study, which found that the enrichment of Rhizobiales may 

lead to a  distinctive soil microbiome  (Zgadzaj et al., 2016). Nonetheless, different phyla 

may harbor ARGs, as the resistome compostion is associated to the microbiome 

composition. Therefore, different ARGs and integrons, may be harbored by different 

bacterial lineages in soil (Forsberg et al., 2014), as Phylogeny is a barrier for HGT and 

certain ARGs  are transferred preferentially among certain taxa (Y. Hu et al., 2016). 

Therefore, as Rhizobiales were negatively correlated, they possibly did not carry blaTEM, 

sul1, blaCTX-M-32, and intI1, which were associated with other bacteria.  

 

The impact of agricultural practices in Chapter II and III at the soil level was quantitatively 

different.  Unlike tomato plots, in V. faba fields showed a shift in the soil microbiomes by 

β-diversity analysis, depending on the agricultural regime. The ARGs distribution 

between L. esculentum and V. faba differed as well, being less abundant in V. faba 

samples, in which mecA was below LOQ in all of the samples. In addition, V. faba 

neighboring plots (Chapter III Z2 and Z3, Fig. 3.1) with similar irrigation and amendment 

had different soil ARGs profiles; blaTEM was significantly higher in Z2 and tetM and blaOXA-

58 were present there as well.  

 

Data from three sampling campaigns (L. sativa, V. faba, L. esculentum) and pristine soil 

(as background) was processed and analyzed in Chapter IV, as well as soil from a forest 

with no agricultural use over the last century. The use of a “background” soil permitted to 

inquire if the ARGs profiles were in certain aspects non-concordant. In Chapter II 

significant differences were detected between fields in the low prevalent ARGs, whereas 

in in Chapter III differences were detected in the most prevalent ones. The selected 

ARGs were researched to inquire which would be part of a “core” resistome in the soils, 

and the ones associated with anthropogenic pressure.  Therefore, data integration from 

all sampling campaigns allowed a better insight of the environment state (ARGs and 

microbiomes), and mitigate any possible batch-effects.  

 

The abundance of ARGs in the collected soil samples (Fig. 4.2 A) revealed that forest 



 

145 

samples had the lowest levels for all ARG and intI1, whereas mecA, blaOXA-58, and tetM 

were below LOQ. PCA analyses provided information of the distribution of the ARGs in 

the soils, identifying three main groups, corresponding to lettuces, broad beans and 

tomatoes plots. The forest soils were very similar in terms of ARG content to the broad 

beans plots (Fig 4.2 B). However, the analysis did not differentiate sampling fields by 

their geographical origin or agricultural practices (rural vs peri-urban). Despite the 

gradient of ARGs and intI1, with a decreasing abundance from rhizospheric soil to fruit 

and beans, plant samples clustered in a very similar way as the soil samples, revealing 

that ARGs potential uptake in plant tissues also varied between crop types (Fig. 4.2 C).  

ARG abundances varied several orders of magnitude between plots and crop types. Four 

genes were found abundantly in most soils, including in the forest soil, blaTEM (≥10
4 copies 

g-1 sample), sul1 (≥103 copies g-1 sample), qnrS1 (mostly ≥103 copies g-1 sample), and 

intI1 (≥103 copies g-1 sample). 

 

The type of crop and the soil microbiome composition appeared as the two most 

important factors to predict the ARG loads in crops edible parts. Microbiome composition 

and ARGs were deeply intertwined in all compartments. The positive correlation of intI1 

and sul1 and Pseudomonadales and Enterobacteriales in the soil microbiome was a 

confirmation of the results obtained in Chapters II and III. The data suggest that certain 

bacterial taxa, including pathogen associated bacteria, which originate in the soil, tend 

to be associated with ARGs and intI1 as an anthropogenic pollution proxy (Gillings et al., 

2015, 2008). The differences in soil microbiomes’ composition were significant (β-

diversity). Plant-soil feedback mechanisms are known to exist, and the effect of the 

plants’ genotype/crops (Chaparro et al., 2014; Ofek et al., 2014; Zolti et al., 2019) and 

the distance to roots dictates their influence in soil microbiomes (Reinhold-Hurek et al., 

2015). Consequently, the feed-back mechanism also impacts the endophyte bacteria. 

Agricultural practices may disturb this equilibrium, shifting compositions of microbiomes 

and ARGs, as discussed in Chapter IV. ABs uptake from the soil also varies according 

the vegetable (Ahmed et al., 2015; Christou et al., 2019; Tadić et al., 2019), possibly 

impacting endophytes and ARGs presence in crops. This uptake is likely to be higher in 

leafy vegetables, such as lettuces, than in tomatoes or broad beans crops, due to several 

factors including higher evapotranspiration rate, and net irrigation requirements (Christou 

et al., 2019). Previous studies conducted in the same geographical area showed 

potential of uptake of chemical contaminants varied according the vegetable tested 

(Margenat et al., 2019, 2017).  

 

Nonetheless, prevalent ARGs, as blaTEM, sul1, qnrS1, appeared as part of the soil core 



 

146 

resistome, as they were present even in pristine soil (forest). The statistical models 

performed on each crop revealed Enterobacteriales and Pseudomonadales (abundant 

in both environmental and clinical settings) showed different relative abundances 

between rural and peri-urban fields. They appeared positively associated to intI1, blaTEM, 

sul1, suggesting a link between anthropogenic pollution and the spread of potential multi-

resistant pathogens, which are possible reservoirs of the core resistome. The resistance 

to at least to β-lactams and tetracyclines is a matter of concern, as they represent two of 

the most widely used classes of ABs in the clinical settings (Gibson et al., 2015). 

Therefore, there is a risk of transfer to consumers, despite that soil and human 

associated microbiomes are widely different, and that they carry different ARGs (Gibson 

et al., 2015), as those ARGs are a part of the mobile resistome (Y. Hu et al., 2016). 

Despite the ecological barrier,  and that HGT rates are relatively low between  bacteria 

from different environments (Smillie et al., 2011), the rate of HGT increases as the 16S 

rDNA distance decreases, even if bacteria are from different origins. For example, 

Burkholderiales,  known to be pathogen associated bacteria (Mahenthiralingam and 

Vandamme, 2005), showed positive correlation with tetM, whose abundance in plant 

tissues can be mostly explained by their abundance in soil. This may represent a likely 

path for transmission of tetracycline resistance from soil to food.  

 

Culture-independent methods such as qPCR, cannot discriminate between intracellular 

or extracellular DNA (eDNA), though progresses have recently been made (Nagler et al., 

2018b). Therefore, part of DNA quantified in our assay might possibly be extracellular. 

eDNA adsorption to the soil matrix is primarily influenced by soil characteristics such as 

concentration of humic substances, ions, and soil pH (Levy-Booth et al., 2007),  which 

may be altered by agricultural practices. Soil acidification caused by chemical fertilization 

(Goulding, 2016; Qiao et al., 2018) promotes adsorption of eDNA into soil particles and 

therefore its stability and persistence. eDNA  also stimulates the occurrence and 

stabilization of biofilms (Mulcahy et al., 2008; Nagler et al., 2018a), which by themselves 

promote HGT. In any case, our study does not allow any estimation of the relevance of 

eDNA abundance in our results, although it is likely that intra- and extracellular DNA 

should shown a similar qualitative composition, as one originates from the other.  

 

AB resistance is ancient and natural occurring phenomenon (D’Costa et al., 2006; 2011), 

widespread in the environment, even in undisturbed soils. In Antartic soils, multi-drug 

efflux pumps and β-lactam resistance mechanism were present (Van Goethem et al., 

2018). Therefore, measures to fight the dissemination of AB resistance in the 

environment should be focused on other ARGs that are not integrated yet in the core 

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8786-y).%20Therefore


 

147 

resistomes, such as tetM, mecA and blaOXA-58. Their presence can be used as indicator 

of anthropogenic water and soil pollution, and therefore should be monitored in future 

quality standards regulations for reclaimed water to be used for agricultural purposes. 

The natural ecological barriers (soil and roots) coupled with optimal administration of 

reclaimed wastewater policies, significantly impair the effect of the irrigation water in 

ARGs spread in downstream environments and their translocation to plant edible parts. 

Very likely, soil amendment has a much higher impact than the irrigation water, directly 

or indirectly, affecting soil properties and, consequently, the respective microbiomes, and 

the plant-soil feedback (Reinhold-Hurek et al., 2015). 

 

Several studies reported WW irrigation have non-significant or limited effect on ARGs 

abundance and prevalence, and on soil microbiomes even after long, multi-decade 

periods of usage (Christou et al., 2019; Gatica and Cytryn, 2013; Jechalke et al., 2015). 

The results in this Thesis point to a similar limited effect of WW on the ARGs loads and 

ARBs presence in the soil and crops, in nearby fields, with similar irrigation regimes. Soil 

amendment was probably sufficient to significantly impact on the crop’s ARGs even if 

this effect was indirect, by shifting the soil local properties, and consequently affecting 

soil microbiomes and resistomes. The ABs arriving in the receiving soils via manure or 

TWW, may last up to thousands of days, such as fluoroquinolones (Cycoń et al., 2019; 

Walters et al., 2010). ABs exposure may cause a continuous selective pressure over soil 

microbiomes for long periods (Kümmerer, 2009; Pan and Chu, 2016; Segura et al., 

2009). Also, may significantly alter the soil processes, e.g. nitrification and/or 

denitrification rates (Toth et al., 2011). Sulfonamides may block iron reduction in soil for 

extended periods (Toth et al., 2011). Therefore, even low concentrations may change the 

activities and the process of microbiomes in the soil, and affect their diversity as well due 

the complex relations in the microbiomes, as changes in functional groups may affect 

others groups (Wagg et al., 2014; Zolti et al., 2019). 

 

The plant-soil feedback-mechanism can be altered as well. The magnitude of the effects 

varies according to the crops ABs uptake capabilities (Christou et al., 2019), as showed 

by the ARGs loads present (decreasing order) in L. sativa, L. esculetum, and V. faba 

samples. Therefore, guidelines for agricultural practices either irrigation water or soil 

amendment should take in consideration the type of crop. “Everything is everywhere: but 

the environment selects” (Becking, 1934, 1931), an unifying concept in Microbial Ecology 

is a good summary of the results. Legislative efforts have to be directed to prevent the 

agricultural environment from selectively favouring the growth and spread of ARBs and 

ARGs that could ultimately colonize the human microbiomes.

The Hypothesis validation generated for this Thesis are described in this chapter. 

 

Hypothesis I: Agricultural practices impact ARGs distribution along the soil-plant-

continuum  

 

This hypothesis is validated. The soil is a reservoir of ARGs. The results provided in the 

Thesis indicate that the levels of ARGs in soils were significantly affected by the 

agricultural practices. As soils act as ARG reservoirs, the ARG soil profile determines the 

ARGs that can be translocated into the plants. 

 

Hypothesis II:  Agricultural practices cause a shift in the bacterial communities along 

the soil-plant continuum 

 

This Hypothesis is validated. Different clades of Proteobacteria, including 

Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, and Burkholderiales, known to be potential multi-

resistant pathogens, were abundant in soils and their relative abundance in the fields 

was afected by agricultural practices. More importantly, Pseudomonales were also 

present in the edible parts. The results suggest a strong influence of the type of crop in 

the soil microbiome, as well as the mutual correlation between soil and endophytic 

microbiomes.

Chapter VI: Conclusions 
 
 
The main conclusions from the Thesis are described below.  

 
 

1. Abundant Proteobacteria families could discriminate between rural and periurban 

L. esculetum fields. This shows that bacteria that are pathogen associated 

bacteria may be more or less abundant in soil and vegetables due to different 

agricultural practices. 

2. Pathogen associated bacteria with potential for multi-resistance phenotypes were 

detected in the L. esculetum fruits. Pseudomonadaceae was detected in 

tomatoes fruits from the peri-urban field.  

3. The L. esculetum peri-urban field was characterized by the presence of less- 

prevalent ARGs, whereas differences between V. faba plots were driven by the 

most prevalent ARGs (blaTEM, qnrS1) and intI1. The only differences detected in 

the beans refered to blaTEM levels. 

4. The abundance of Proteobacteria (pathogen associated bacteria) was indicative 

of the field type (rural vs peri-urban), with a high degree of accuracy in V. faba 

fields. 

5. Rhizobiales were the main dominant endobacteria from the roots to the edible 

parts of V. faba plants. The results suggest that Rhizobiales are occupying a 

niche, making more difficult for ARBs to colonize the plants. They appear to impair 

the translocation of ARGs into the plant and edible parts, independently of the 

soil ARGs and intI1 abundances. 

6. The abundances of ARGs decreased from the soil to the edible parts, 

independently of the crop type. Despite the similar trends of distribution along the 

soil-plant-continuum, the absolute values varied by several fold among crop 

types. 

7. Three sampling campaigns revealed that the soil microbiomes β-diversity is 

significantly different, grouped by the type of crop. The soil microbiomes 

composition depended on the crop rather than on the farming practices or 

location (peri-urban and rural agriculture). 

8. The plants ARGs were strongly dependent on soil ARGs abundance and profile. 

ARGs composition and even the entire resistome composition was dependent on 



 

151 

the bacterial community composition. The microbiome is affected by the soil 

properties and vegetable, which are modulated by agricultural practices. 

9. All soils, including the forest soil, presented blaTEM, sul1 and qnrS1. This suggests 

that these ARGs are incorporated into the local soil resistomes. Therefore, low 

prevalent genes from clinical origin should be targeted, as they are not 

incorporated in the soil/crops core microbiomes and resistomes, and they can be 

used as markers for anthropogenic pressure/pollution. 

10. Pseudomonales and Enterobacteriales abundances have potential as a 

descriptor of the agricultural fields status. On a global level, those taxa tend to be 

positively associated with intI1, blaTEM, and sul1, revealing a link between 

anthropogenic pollution and potential multi-resistant pathogens.  

11. The Thesis results show the focus of regulation should be on soil amendment 

practices, vegetables physiology, rather than only focusing in the irrigation water 

quality.
