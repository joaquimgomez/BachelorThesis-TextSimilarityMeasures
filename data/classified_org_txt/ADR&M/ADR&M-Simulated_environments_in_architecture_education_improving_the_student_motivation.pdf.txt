Abstract The increasing graphic quality and ease of use of the current generation of videogame technology compels
educators to rethink how architecture students learn. This paper presents the results of an educational
experience with architecture students that explored the suitability of virtual environments as an educational
tool. Students explored the simulated environment of an architectural proposal and filled a survey asking
whether the experience had made them reason about some fundamental qualities of space. The results
revealed that the virtual environment was capable of making students reflect on the functional, formal or
material qualities of architectural spaces, suggesting a new education avenue using gamification or serious
games strategies.

1 Introduction

In the field of architecture, the suitability of the designs (buildings or urban environ‐
ments) must be assessed before they are built, in a process that can span years. Repre‐
sentation technologies are used throughout the architectural design process to bring ideas
into reality, allowing communication between designers, clients, contractors and collab‐
orators [1]. Architecture students must learn to be proficient in these representation
technologies throughout their studies, and must reach the point where drawing and
representation blend together, and drawing becomes thinking [2]. Therefore, it is para‐
mount that students become skillful in multiple representation technologies, and that
they are capable of incorporating the latest technologies into their design process in order
to better communicate their proposals, and to facilitate the critical reasoning on the
spaces they conceive.

The project presented in this article consists of an investigation at the intersection
between computer sciences, the education of future architects and multimedia engineers,
and the urban policies in future cities [3, 4]. One of the most innovative aspects is the
incorporation of game strategies in a virtual and collaborative urban environment, aimed
at improving the initial proposal. This approach incorporates the architecture students
into the project in an active way, clearly enhancing their spatial and urban competences.

2 Literature Review

2.1 Games and Architectural Representation

Games are created by designers/teams of developers, and are consumed by players [5].
They are purchased, used, and eventually cast away like most other consumable goods
[6]. The difference between games and other entertainment products (such as books,
music, movies and plays) is that their consumption is relatively unpredictable. The string
of events that occur during gameplay and the outcome of those events are unknown at
the time the product is finished [7].

The gamification in classes helps to improve the connection between the material
and the student. It offers the opportunity to reflect on a topic in depth and allows positive
changes in behavior [8]. In this approach, learning through gaming is achieved by
aligning the game mechanics with Bloom’s taxonomy of learning [9], allowing learning
to be classified into three domains [10]:

• Cognitive, which is taught in traditional education and implies understanding and
synthesis of knowledge.

• Affective (involving emotions), which reflects the attitude toward a situation.
• Psychomotor (the physical), which is activated by requiring a union of mental and

physical activity.

To encourage the use of games in learning beyond simulations and puzzles, it is
essential to develop a better understanding of the tasks, activities, skills and operations
that different game types can offer, and examine how these might correspond to the
desired learning outcomes [11].

Using game engines for representation is beginning to gain traction in the architec‐
tural field, which until recently had been a stronghold of 3D rendering, generally
producing static images and occasionally videos (as a succession of 3D renderings with
scripted camera movements). With the game industry improvements in real-time hard‐
ware-assisted 3D rendering, the quality provided by game engines is quickly
approaching the levels of realism of traditional offline rendering engines, while
providing additional features, at a fraction of the cost.

Furthermore, real-time rendering offers one benefit that no other technology can
provide: immersion, which allows the user to freely navigate the environment and
interact with some of its elements (e.g. doors, lighting, avatars); this sense of presence
can be enhanced when using positional audio cues and/or virtual reality (VR) head-
mounted displays.

2.2 Videogames in Education

Historically, in civil and building engineering education, visualization and under‐
standing of 3D space was typically accomplished via the classical view (physical models
and drawings), in front of 3D models and using virtual specifications. This approach is
changing due to a generational change and the continuous improvement and develop‐
ment of technology. The new systems based on VR/AR (Virtual and Augmented
Reality), Geo-Referencing, and learning gamification will gradually reduce the control
imposed on the designed tasks and scheduled presentations.

The current generations of students are “digital natives” [12], and Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) are an integral part of their life. Smartphone and
computer use among Spanish digital natives is very high, as well as digital communi‐
cations, with over 95% of Spaniards under 35 using the Internet for personal reasons
[13]. Digital natives enjoy playing videogames, and as a result spend less time
consuming other audiovisual content [14]. Although players have different preferences
[15], the use of game mechanics in non-game situations, or “gamification” [16] can be
a powerful educational tool [17], stimulating motivation [18] through engaging elements
of game-playing, although some authors [19] attribute the observed benefits not to game
mechanics themselves, but to framing.

Gamification should not be confused with “serious games” [20], which use simula‐
tions [21] to provide a realistic context for training purposes. While gamification and
serious games apply to game-playing in general, they are both frequently discussed in
the context of videogames or videogame technology.

3 The Project: ArchGAME4CITY

The project and initial case study presented are framed within a university environment.
The main hypothesis is based on demonstrating that the implementation of virtual
gamification strategies in the urban design field generate an improvement in the student’s
spatial comprehension and motivation, not only for the contents, but also for the use of
virtual technology.

This paper discusses an educational experience developed in an elective course in
the Barcelona School of Architecture, introducing new technologies to architecture
students: photo scanning, augmented reality (AR) on mobile devices, 3D printing and
real-time rendering using videogame technology. In this course, the use of the game
development platform Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) was introduced for the first time, being
selected because of its cost (free for architectural visualization), graphics quality and
ease of use of its node-based scripting.

The authors wanted to explore the suitability of videogame technology in architec‐
tural education, following their experiences using AR in formal education in the archi‐
tecture degree [22], and on informal learning in public participation processes [23]. This
course introduced different emerging technologies in the field of architecture represen‐
tation. The section about real-time rendering discussed in this paper was distributed into
9 sessions following the sections about photo scanning and augmented reality, and
before the section on 3D printing.

The surveys were conducted electronically using Google Forms, which allowed the
students to fill them easily using any internet-connected device with a web browser at
any time, an important advantage because their studies did not leave them much free
time to devote to responding anonymous non-compulsory surveys. The pre-course
survey was filled by 6 participants (23%) and the post-course survey by 10 (38%) and
their responses were automatically collected into a Google Drive spreadsheet for later
analysis. The surveys were visually divided into blocks of related questions according
to their theme (questions specific to architecture, the development of the course, the
example demo, motivation after the course, participant profile and satisfaction with the
Unreal Engine platform). Each block had between 2 and 5 questions.

The pre-course survey questions focused on the example executable used in the first
session of the course, and the post-course survey on the development of the course. Both
surveys were in Spanish language. The majority of the responses used a Likert scale
[24], either diverging between two opposite poles (positive, neutral and negative), or
ordered sequentially. The possible responses were presented in a grid, with the shared
scale ordered from low (left) to high (right) on the vertical columns and each aspect of
the question in a different row. The order of the rows was automatically randomized in
each survey to eliminate response order biases.

4 Results

The demo students played during the introductory class focused on visual aspects related
to architecture visualization instead of gameplay: there were no competitive elements
or any possibility to be harmed; the avatar walked instead of running, and materials and
lighting were realistic instead of stylized. The virtual environment recreated a lot besides
the building where they studied (Fig. 1).

environment with the renovation proposal (right).

The objectives of this demo were twofold:

• Showcase the features of the game engine applied to realistic architectural visuali‐
zation, in order to encourage students to learn to use the tool after seeing its advan‐
tages.

• Explore the possibilities of using virtual environments as an educational tool in
architectural education to reason about the qualities of architectural spaces.

Students were asked about the perceived usefulness of 9 different architectural
representation techniques, ranging from the more traditional to the most widely used in
their studies (Fig. 2).

To explore the suitability of virtual environments as educational tools to promote
critical reasoning among architecture students, the participants were asked whether their
experience navigating the simulation had made them reflect on several fundamental
qualities of architectural design.

The results showed that, in most of the key aspects they were asked about, the inter‐
active first person virtual experience of the environment had a positive influence on their
appreciation of the qualities of the simulated space (Fig. 3 Capacity of virtual environ‐
ments to promote critical reasoning on fundamental architectural education aspects).

However, a small number of participants did not report any advantage in some of
the aspects (brown segments in the graph), a fact that will be researched in further
investigations.

In the post-course survey, two questions were designed to indirectly measure student
motivation at the end of the course, asking their interest in developing their newly
acquired skills and to apply them professionally (Fig. 4 Interest in further developing
skills acquired in the course, specific skills (above) and professionally (below).

When asked about their interest in continuing their education on basic skills intro‐
duced in the course (Fig. 4), they manifested very high interest in developing texturing and
modeling, while their interest in programming was more lukewarm, with only about half
of them being highly interested. Their response was in line with the results of the ques‐
tions about what aspects should emphasized in the next edition of the course, where
texturing and modeling were highly rated, while interactivity and programming were not.
Apparently, while the participants clearly manifested a high interest in the creative
aspects of the technology, in the more technical skills appeared to two profiles: one very
interested in the programming side of the technology and another one not interested at all.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

The main objective of the course was to introduce architecture students to videogame
engines as an emerging technology in the field of architectural visualization, taking
advantage of the availability of affordable (zero or low-cost) solutions that offer very
high quality results and –considering their complexity–, relatively friendly user
interfaces.

The surveys showed that the students were very interested in the technology before
taking the course, and remained interested when they finished, a remarkable fact consid‐
ering that the course was demanding in its difficulty and required a considerable time
dedication. This motivation can be explained from a practical point of view because
videogame technology has the potential to replace the current non-real-time rendering

solutions with a cheaper alternative, providing immediate feedback when placing 3D
elements, defining materials or lighting the scene, while offering extra features like the
capacity of navigating and interacting with the virtual environment, and other features
like VR which will soon be supported on mobile platforms.

In addition to validating videogame technology as a representation technique, a
secondary objective of the experience was to explore the suitability of virtual environ‐
ments as a tool to promote critical thinking in architecture students.

The survey conducted after exploring the virtual environment showed promising
results, supporting the hypothesis that virtual environments are capable of making
students reflect about the functional, formal or material qualities of architectural spaces.
These findings open a new avenue of educational research using serious games, where
students could virtually experience different cultural and historical contexts, or be placed
in a specific space, but with different roles (e.g. wheelchair-using person, child) or
situations (e.g. crowded spaces, day/night cycle, weather and seasonal changes). These
virtual environments should complement, and not replace, other means architectural
education, such as traveling or open discussion of ideas. Furthermore, tracking the
behavior in these virtual environments could be a valuable architectural research tool to
conduct controlled experiments.

Tracking individual persons in public spaces is challenging; although it is possible
to accurately track their movement using RFID or other technologies [25], it is techni‐
cally difficult, and it raises privacy concerns when gathering data in public spaces. In
areas such as economics, synthetic experiments are performed to model real situations,
even though in some cases participants do not understand the rules fully [26].

The next phase of the development will include the capacity of tracking (with their
consent) the users’ behavior in virtual space (position and gaze along time), which will
allow the application to be used as a research tool [27] to conduct controlled experiments.
Also, we will implement a mixed method approach to improve the assessment method‐
ology. This model is based on a pragmatic paradigm that contemplates the possibility
of combining quantitative and qualitative methods to achieve complementary results
[28]. The quantitative approach will be based on ISO 9241-11, previously used in other
educational cases [4, 29], which provides usability assessment guidelines of efficiency
and user satisfaction. The qualitative approach will be post-visit interviews with a repre‐
sentative sample of the students involved in the project, who will share their experience
with the appliance of this new technology into the visit. For this final stage, Bipolar
Laddering Assessment (BLA) will be used, a technique also previously validated in
other educational experiments [30].
