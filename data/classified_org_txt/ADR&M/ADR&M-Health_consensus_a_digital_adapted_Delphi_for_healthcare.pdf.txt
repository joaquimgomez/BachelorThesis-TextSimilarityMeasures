ABSTRACT

New tools are needed to facilitate the involvement of health professionals in healthcare participative 
processes, partially because a relevant segment of healthcare knowledge and decision-making is 
capillary distributed among them. A collaborative design strategy has been applied to the creation 
of an Internet tool to produce digitally adapted Delphi for healthcare purposes. During the period 
2012-16 the prototype of the tool has been gradually improved through its application to 18 real 
cases. It is proposed the model Health Consensus as a digitally adapted Delphi supported by the 
various capabilities of Internet. The authors agree that Health Consensus is a useful and expandable 
tool for participative processes. The Internet provides several opportunities to overcome many of the 
limitations of conventional Delphi, as well as improving the final studies with new functionalities.

INTRoDUCTIoN

Rand Corporation developed the Delphi method as a forecasting system based on the aggregation 
of expert opinions and roundtable discussions. 84 years passed between the publication of the Jury 
Theorem (Condorcet, 1875) and the first formal implementation of consensus among experts (Helmer 
and Rescher, 1959). Condorcet stated that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not 
to make a correct decision, the probability that the vote of the group is the correct decision increases 
with the number of members of the group. This simple principle was applied by RAND researchers 
to forecast the impact of technology on warfare. Commissioned by the US Air Force, RAND created 
during the 50’s the Delphi method. In the Delphi method, a group of experts anonymously reply to 
questionnaires and then receive feedback in the form of a statistical representation of participant’s 
response. The process may be repeated several times with the intention of reducing the range of 
responses and arrive at something closer to expert consensus.

Although some authors consider this methodology to be in a developmental stage (Day & Bobeva, 
2004), nowadays Delphi is recognised as a useful tool to build consensus by using questionnaires to 
collect data from panels of selected subjects (Dalkey & Helmer, 1963) and is widely accepted as a 
“scientifically and practically proven” research technique (von der Grach, 2012). The method is often

employed in the absence of precise analytical techniques for gathering subjective judgments through 
group consensus (Linstone, 1978). Researchers and practitioners have successfully applied Delphi 
to forecasting, planning and needs assessment both in the public and the private sector. In a nutshell, 
Delphi enables groups of people to share understanding and knowledge. A group of participating 
individuals will reach a more informed answer than a single person’s opinion to questions that have 
no alternative scientific answer.

Complexity rich domains like healthcare are ideally fitted for Delphi applications. In healthcare, 
there is an endless number of problems where solutions may be affordable, if the unevenly distributed 
knowledge and experience of healthcare professionals and patients, is tapped. Following the original 
use of Delphi in social sciences, the method has been widely used in healthcare research as an effective 
way to gain and measure group consensus (Holey, Feeley, & Dixon, 2007) and there is no doubt that 
it is an important method for achieving consensus on issues where is a lack of evidence (Keeney, 
Hasson, Mcckenna, & Kenna, 2006).

However, there are many situations where face-to-face meetings between all participants, that 
Delphi requires, is not possible due to time, space and cost constraints. Digital technologies may 
eventually overcome some of these limitations.

Since the first technology enabled Delphi back in the early seventies, digital methods have 
dramatically evolved. Delphi Conferencing was the first experience of using computers to assist 
in the method roll-out (Turoff, 1972). Along with the evolution and development of digital and 
communication technologies, several initiatives of what could be considered a digitally adapted 
Delphi have been reported in the literature, as networking, real time processing and social media 
boost innovation and new research opportunities to Delphi (Day & Bobeva, 2004) (Linstone and 
Turoff, 2002).

Looking ahead, information and communication technologies developments will continue 
increasing analytic capabilities by connecting relevant data to existing knowledge. Groups of people 
will be able to share information and connect in such a way that many of our current accepted 
paradigms will require a reformulation. Real time contextual analysis, large networks of experts 
and computational social science advances may lead to the development of a diversity of digitally 
enhanced Delphi methods (Lazer, 2009).

Finally, collaborative design is becoming an efficient approach to develop innovative products and 
services based on the systematic collaboration of agents and stakeholders. Computing operating systems, 
digital scanners or urbanisation of cities are just some of the many examples where the innovation 
process is conducted collectively by large groups or experts and/or crowds. Again, information and 
communication technologies leverage the collaborative process of design and innovation.

Applying the Delphi principles to confine consensus in different healthcare innovation 
domains, the authors developed a digital adapted version called Health Consensus. A user-centred 
and collaborative design strategy was followed, throughout 18 healthcare applications where users’ 
behaviour was observed and their feedback listened, to gradually improve the tool.

The aim of this paper is to contribute from the experience grounded in the application of Health 
Consensus to 18 real cases. The paper is organised in two sections outlined in Figure 1. The first 
section covers a literature review on adapted Delphi while the second section describes the process of 
Health Consensus gradual design and construction during the 18 cases. Finally, the impact of digital 
technologies in Delphi is discussed, and conclusions and future research directions are presented.

DeLPHI AS A PRoTo MeTHoDoLoGy

This section presents a review of the literature of Delphi models to end up with a synthesis of the 
opportunities that digital innovation might bring to this kind of participative processes.

The Delphi method is defined as a process for structuring the communication of a group of 
experts acting together, to deal with a problem and it is considered an excellent way to collect and

29

synthesize opinions (Gordon T., 1994). Initially conceived for forecasting, it has spread onto decision 
making, assessment or planning (Shelton & Creghan, 2015), facilitating the communication among 
experts and capturing tacit knowledge in an efficient way. Although the method admits a range of 
designs to systematically collect and contextualise the contributions of experts, all designs share a 
common set of features:

• It is an iterative communication process managed by a project moderator or facilitator;
• Experts get feedback during the different rounds of participation;
• There is a conclusion in the form of statement and its degree of agreement among experts;
• All participant experts are usually considered as equals and anonymous.

Delphi is a useful method in many healthcare areas, as its future is perceived as highly innovative. 
Closer collaborations between stakeholder groups, facilitated by Delphi methods, will be critical for 
quality improvement (Haluza & Jungwirth, 2016).

Dissection of Delphi
Nowack, Endrikat, & Guenther (2011) proposed a coding scheme for Delphi-based scenario studies 
that can be applied to the design of any Delphi application. Their taxonomy has been adapted for this 
work and Table 1 summarizes in categories and subcategories the elements involved in the design 
of a Delphi study.

Modification of Delphi
A modified Delphi process is like a classical approach as rounds, experts and similar objectives 
configure it, but with some changes in relation with the classical model. A modification might 
consist in the introduction of simple elements as pre-round work with literature reviews or 
interviews with experts on the topic. Modifications might also consist in more sophisticated 
arrangements that researchers require for adapting the method to suit their studies (Keeney, 
Hasson, Mcckenna, & Kenna, 2006).

Many researchers support that modified Delphi processes offers a system to achieve relevant 
and valid outcomes (Skulmoski, Hartman, & Krahn, 2007). Despite Nowack, Endrikat & Guenther’s 
classification in three types (classical Delphi, Delphi study and Delphi technique), Delphi has become 
so diverse that it’s hard to reach a closed definition of modified Delphi.

Through modifications, the response rate can be increased, consensus time reduced or accuracy 
of the results improved. In some cases, the quantification of responses has been applied (Ambrosiadou 
& Goulis, 1999). There’s an ongoing debate whether modifications of the Delphi system can be

allowed in a generally strict environment as the scientific one. In some cases, the modifications are 
meaningful and contribute to a better understanding of the technique, while in others they are random 
and arbitrary, thus undermining its quality and credibility. Thus, the versatility of Delphi is both its 
power and its fallibility (Gupta & Clarke, 1996).

A logical conclusion is that Delphi may be considered a seminal methodology adapted and 
modified systematically to meet requirements of researchers in specific areas and situations. Table 
2 compiles a set of relevant modified Delphi versions.

A diversity of criticisms counterbalances Delphi’s fertility. Some drawbacks are related to the 
content definition and results such as the lack of clarity in the selection of the consensus criteria 
and the discrepancies in the definition of what is consensus stressed by the heterogeneity of 
variables to ponder (Meijering, Kampen, & Tobi, 2013). Other reproaches point to a so called expert 
profile, such as the disparity in knowledge related to the parts of the construct under consensus, 
the variability of commitment during the participation results in concerns about the consistency 
and validity of the answers, the type and degree of feedback and the difficulty of reception control. 
(Bolger & Wright, 2011).

DIGITIZATIoN oF DeLPHI

Digital technologies allow a substantial improvement in the execution of a classical or minor modified 
Delphi study without significantly altering the essence of the method. Online questionnaires overcome 
time and space constraints of face-to-face meetings and accelerate the analysis of results. In all these 
cases technology facilitates the operative of the process but might not have a relevant effect on the 
design criteria of the Delphi studies. However, these technologies offer new opportunities when they 
are combined considering their new dimensions:

• Time elasticity: Time constraints and limitations shrink because of a free combination of 
synchronous and asynchronous processes that allows many alternatives to schedule participation, 
feedback and iteration;

• Online participants: Number of participants is unrestricted and the limits are based on the 
potential contribution of participants and their commitment with the participative process. Online 
participation may consist on any combination considering synchronous/asynchronous and face-
to-face/distance communication;

• Cloud data: The geographical distribution and the mobility of participants is only limited by 
their real-time access to the internet cloud. The computation of data allows creating automatic 
logical processes to interact with participants;

• Digital innovation: Innovation based in digital technologies is continuous and open. The implication 
of diverse stakeholders, particularly users, in the evolution of the digital world is essential.

Case-example of a Digitized Real Time Delphi
The example is based on the application of the Health Consensus model as a Delphi self-assessment 
tool, concerning the degree of participation in the organisation. The relevance and the degree of 
participation of employees in decision making or knowledge discovery in the organisation is something 
that might be the result of a consensus among all the people involved in the organization.

The capture in Figure 2 shows the precise moment when someone has participated. The data at 
the right appears once the user has voted. So, first vote is blind and is recorded, then changing vote 
is allowed. In some cases, consensus is reached (question 1) and in others is not (question 2). The 
vote may change because of arguments expressed by participants during a meeting, or as a personal 
reflection of the participant.

Time elasticity
Real time calculation of results opens new opportunities for the iteration and feedback. In a Real 
Time Delphi, the use of the Internet, or network computing, allows instant feedback after an expert 
placed input. Such proficient people can “respond, comment, or argue immediately, which allows 
direct feedback and almost infinite iterations” (Nowack, Endrikat, & Guenther, 2011). In fact, the 
core innovation of real time Delphi studies is the instant and automatic calculation and delivery of 
results (Monguet, 2010).

As it has been observed in other areas, the technology-enabled performance of adapted Delphi may 
affect traditional consensus criteria and opens opportunities to improve the efficiency by shortening 
execution times (Gordon & Pease, 2006). Due to the increasing number of design possibilities when 
setting up a real-time Delphi application, a key question will be how to ensure a systematic approach 
to conduct a Delphi study. There are guidelines for the management of a classical Delphi, but there 
is a lack of design recommendations for digital Delphi to ensure validity and trustworthiness.

online Participants
Virtual space nearly allows an unlimited number of participants. Unleashing panel sizes may mean 
to move from the logic of experts to the wisdom of crowds. (Surowiecki, 2005). Furthermore, the 
proliferation and popularity of social networks help in the process of recruitment of participants and 
dissemination of results. “The more the better” or “quality versus quantity” are vividly open debates 
about the optimal number of participants and the marginal contribution once consensus has been 
reached. In some way, larger participations may cause reiteration.

Cloud Data
Central storage of information in the cloud and “mobile increased access” proved to be a productive 
combination in terms of convenience for user participation and innovation options for designers.

A digitally augmented Delphi implies a different data management approach. Data is now dynamic 
and results can be processed on the fly to inform participants about the current state of the question.

Digital Innovation
A digital environment is intrinsically connected with the concept of openness. Any digital design 
has the property of being continuously improved by the interaction of end-users and designers or 
even end-users as designers.

Collaborative Processes in Design
Collaboration has been extensively used as a strategy to find solutions in society and industry. 
Methodologies such as focus groups or structured interviews with customers to explore market 
preferences and needs have been widely applied. On the other hand, and due in part to the evolution 
of collaboration platforms, organisations and companies are increasing their sensibility and awareness 
about the relevance of listening and capturing the knowledge of customers and users. This is especially 
important for any initiative of a product or service that depends on the use of information technologies.

Design is increasingly perceived as a social process that involves the participation of 
multiple agents with multiple, and often conflicting, needs, knowledge and goals (Alexiou, 
2009). Although designing new products and services in the industrial age has always been 
a collective process, the term collaborative design has become increasingly popular within 
other communities. However, in the process of defining collaborative design there is a lack 
of delineation between recurring key terms like teamwork, co-design, participatory design, 
cooperation and so forth (Wang & Oygur, 2009).

A small number of user opinions may be very relevant in designing new products and services, 
so collective design activities that allow, explicitly or implicitly, that participants actively support 
their thoughts and design ideas can deliver a thoughtful help to designers.

Conscious or unconscious mass collaboration is behind newest solutions for web‐related tasks 
and has been recognized to be an effective tool for corporate R&D departments (Merrick, Gu, Niazi, 
& Shafi, 2011).

The management of collaborative processes needs a framework for understanding what type of 
collective intelligence is possible, desirable and affordable and under what conditions. At a minimum, 
it is necessary to consider among others: loss of control, diversity versus expertise, engagement or 
policing (Bonabeau, 2009). By understanding such important issues many companies have successfully 
implemented Decisions 2.0 applications for a variety of purposes, including research and development, 
market research, customer service and knowledge management.

The design and development of online collective intelligence solutions are evolutionary and 
grounded with lots of trial and error processes in combining knowledge, design, technology, 
management and social interaction. Social networks proliferation and its use in professional or 
academic environments have increased the culture of participating and the sense of belonging 
(Monguet, Trejo, Bassolas, Martí, & Martí, 2014).

Despite the growing importance of collective intelligence, little is known about the design 
processes that leads to effective social innovation (Paulini, Murty, & Maher, 2012). Some of the 
mechanisms that produce successful community solutions inputs are:

• Structuring design as a hybrid process, which combines online communities for design 
development and appointed expertise;

• Providing distinct roles for users to assume manageable tasks for them to perform and clarifying 
task requirements;

• Supporting social communication to strengthen the impact of ideas, with focus on the social 
processes of ideation and evaluation.

Health Consensus Prototyping
During the period 2012 – 2016 the authors, playing the role of design-technology team, carried out 
a series of 18 consensus cases in the healthcare area. The agents listed in Table 3 participated in the 
creation process of Health Consensus. The prototype creation process was explicit for all the teams 
leading the diverse Delphi studies, although not all of them adopted the same degree of commitment 
with the creative attempts.

The development of Health Consensus can be considered a design project requiring the work of 
teams of professionals coordinating their varied expertise. Collaborative design has different dimensions 
that must be considered simultaneously (Alexiou, 2009). In Table 4 there is a preliminary reflection 
about the influence of this dimensions in the development of the Health Consensus prototypes.

Along with the development of the diverse cases, new opportunities arose in the form of requests 
from the leading groups as well as from designers. Thus, the Health Consensus prototype improved 
gradually with new functionalities only if they were viable and accepted by participants. Table 5 
summarises the evolution of the prototype and the main features that were gradually added to the 
base version.

Social

Collaboration is mainly a 
social process. Values are the 
result of interactions between 
individuals that give rise to 
different kinds of conflicts.

Clinicians and researchers from leading teams constantly 
asked for more functionalities. It was the design-technology 
team responsibility to assess the viability and priority of 
demands. 
The user centred design strategy was based on piloting and 
testing the applications with short groups of people. Large 
groups were used to ascertain the level of satisfaction.

Knowledge

Knowledge is distributed 
through the members of 
groups, especially tacit 
knowledge. The value is then 
associated with knowledge 
sharing.

The relative value of functionalities in the prototype was 
not an explicit knowledge of the leading teams. A relevant 
task of the technology-design team consisted in fulfilling the 
requirements of the leading team.

Creativity

Creating something new 
is a process that combines 
collective and individual 
behaviors of communication.

The management of ideas provided by all participants, 
including final users, was one of the main concerns of the 
design-technology team. Formal and informal interviews with 
users were carried on for the 18 cases.

Description and Characteristics of the 18 Applications
The researchers were not free to decide by themselves the exact model to be applied in each case, as 
all of them were real commissions from healthcare institutions and industry. All the cases share the 
technical tool used and the training given to the leading group about consensus design and possibilities. 
So, for each application, customers made the final decision about style and design details. Professionals 
integrating all the leading groups had significant experience in research. Table 6 presents the 18 cases 
produced with Health Consensus during the period 2012-2016 in chronological order.

• Process can be anonymous;
• Items refer to the number of concepts to agree;
• Questions the total number of questions users had to respond.

All applications had alpha and beta versions usually with larger dimensions.
All cases except the number 7 had similar dimensions in terms of users, so in Table 8 data are 

presented except the case.

DISCUSSIoN

Because of the experience gained with this research the impact of Internet on the current concerns 
about the Delphi method can be widely discussed.

The matter of strictness and validity in the application of Delphi method is a main concern inside 
the research community (Shelton & Creghan, 2015) (von der Grach, 2012) (Skulmoski, Hartman, & 
Krahn, 2007). Issues include the definition of problems, structure of panels, methods of feedback and 
measurement of outcomes (Cantrill, Sibbald, & Buetow, 1996). So, although accepted as a research 
method, some aspects of Delphi remain still open to discussion. As it has been commented before, 
Delphi’s malleability forces a constant validity review.

Standards for consensus in Delphi research have never been rigorously established (V.W. Mitchell, 
1991), and the monitoring team must define criteria for each Delphi process individually, this may 
be part of the reason of weakness in methodology in this kind of research (von der Grach, 2012).

There is evidence that Delphi predictions are quite accurate (Parente & Anderson-Parente, 2011) 
but are difficult to perform well. A great deal of attention must be given to the choice of participants; the 
questionnaires must be meticulously prepared and tested to avoid ambiguity. Multi-round studies require 
a great deal of time; inevitably, some participants will drop out during the process (Gordon T., 1994).

Table 9 summarises the discussions about concerns and/or risks of the Delphi that can find a 
way of improvement through the application of digital strategies. It might be argued that Internet 
could eventually stress some of the current difficulties, but these drawbacks can be traded-off with 
a range of advantages.

CoNCLUSIoN

Since the 60’s the consensus among experts as a research method has adopted numerous variants 
and has gained followers, especially in the field of health. The number of researchers who 
apply methodologies inspired by the Delphi model has increased continuously over the past 
years. Delphi method remains nowadays active and open to new modification, particularly the 
digitisation has considerably increased the potential for improvement, so Delphi can be really 
considered a seminal methodology.

Category Concerns Internet Potential Impact

Function

Benefits of Delphi that may come along with 
the research main purpose. For example, being 
a learning instrument or carrying on creativity 
strategies. (Gupta & Clarke, 1996)

Reinforce the value of the Delphi process 
by saving, processing and sharing 
any information produced during the 
communicative process.

Presentation of 
information

The selection, quality and format of scientific 
information (Black, Murphy, Lamping, McKee, 
& Sande, 1999).

Use of animations, video or other resources to 
present the content.

Communication 
process

The efficient structuring of a group 
communication process (von der Grach, 2012).

Facilitate a general vision of the whole 
process and the ability to guide the users 
through the Delphi process.

Time

A weakness of the Delphi method is the time that 
it takes. “A single round can easily require three 
weeks; a three-round Delphi is at least a three- to 
four-month” (Gordon T., 1994)

The time to design and discuss the process 
may be even longer as design possibilities 
increases. Nevertheless, execution may be 
reduced to one day.

Balanced process
Ensuring equitable participation. Participants 
with extreme opinions may work harder than 
others (Gordon T., 1994).

The analysis of the data provided by any 
group of digital participants allows discerning 
if asymmetries in the participation process 
affect the results of the research.

Number of 
participants

The size of a “small” Delphi sample has not been 
unequivocally established (Akins, Tolson, & 
Cole, 2005) and quite often convenient samples 
have been chosen upon availability of experts and 
resources (Akins, Tolson, & Cole, 2005) ranging 
from 10 to more than 1.000.

Sample size of a Delphi is not a statistically-
bound decision and good results can be 
obtained by a comparatively small group 
of correctly selected experts. Nevertheless, 
Internet allows to overcome restrictions in 
dimension of groups of participants.

Quality of 
participants

Experts are multi-faceted and there are 
difficulties in defining and justifying their 
selection. Researchers have difficulties in 
conceptualising their expertise and current 
literature fails to defend the pros and cons of a 
panel selection (Baker, Lovell, & Harris, 2006). 
The direct self-weighting of the expertise of 
participants have disadvantages (Gordon T., 
1994).

Profiles data provided by participants allow 
analysing among others: 
- Homogenous/heterogeneous degree 
of groups of participants and quotes of 
stakeholders. 
- Inclusion-exclusion criteria. 
- Assessment of theoretical and practical 
preparation.

Panel composition

The point of view of panellists may be different 
if this is from inside or outside the organisation, 
patient or professional. (Förster & von der 
Gracht, 2014)

Different stakeholders may be treated 
differently depending on the vision they have.

Anonymity

It is considered that anonymity eliminates the 
effect of dominant individuals and facilitates free 
change of opinion when others cannot see. So, 
main argument for anonymity is to avoid negative 
impacts of group communication processes 
(Nowack, Endrikat, & Guenther, 2011).

Internet offers the possibility of establishing 
and ensuring a degree of anonymity. 
Participants may be completely anonymous 
or in the other extreme in a face-to-face 
meeting it is possible to publically share 
extreme opinions. In some cases, it could be 
interesting to promote discussions among 
professionals. 
Real time digital management of data allows 
to maintain anonymity and at the same time 
show the aggregated opinions of participants 
by profiles.

A digital adapted Delphi method based on Internet facilitates the effective involvement of 
participants in knowledge sharing and decision-making. The experience presented in this research, 
in the development of Health Consensus, shows that the collaborative design strategy applied, has 
proved to be useful in the creation and improvement of the system. This design strategy might continue 
being useful in the future as digital innovation is accelerated.

Across the eighteen cases reported, Health Consensus has become a useful tool for the creation 
of knowledge and decisions making throughout participative processes in a variety of healthcare 
domains. The cloud-based nature of the model, provides several opportunities to overcome many of the 
limitations of conventional Delphi as well as improving the Delphi method with new functionalities. 
However, many features might be still added to the system to increase usefulness, effectiveness and 
efficiency. This opens a wide horizon of future research and innovation particularly in the domain 
of balancing expertise and crowd intelligence.

The analysis and the management of data created during the application of digital Delphi is a 
promising field of innovation. Real time statistics will be a key source for the collective intelligence 
development of participants.

The application of information technologies multiplies Delphi possibilities. Internet and mobile 
devices allow introducing innovations and variations in the method to adapt it to many different needs. 
Online Delphi known as Real Time Delphi has a lot of future in a wide variety fields as research, 
knowledge management, decision making, prioritization or even the organizational learning.

Dimension of 
questionnaires

Generally, it is necessary to sacrifice questions 
and rounds to guarantee panel participation and 
continuity (Landeta, 2006)

Although dimension of Delphi is limited by 
time constraints of participants, segmentation 
of workload and increase of participants may 
help to overcome limitations.

Interpretation of 
questionnaires

Assuming all the participants understand and 
interpret the questions or item of discussion in 
the same way (Black, Murphy, Lamping, McKee, 
& Sande, 1999).

Pilots are fundamental to ensure that 
everything works as intended during the 
design phase, and internet assisted Delphi 
facilitates testing.

Feedback
Consensus may occur because of pressure 
brought on participants who have extreme 
opinions (Rowe G. et al., 1991).

Feedback may be regulated following specific 
rules, and the participative process can be 
made more transparent, by publishing the 
registration data.

Stability of 
participation

It may be necessary to test stability between 
successive Delphi rounds before the analysis of 
the level or type of consensus (Dajani, Sincoff, & 
Talley, 1979).

The analysis of data in real time may alert 
about eventual problems with stability or 
inconsistency of the questions or participants.

Strictness
The stricter the criteria, harder it is to achieve 
consensus among the expert panel. (von der 
Grach, 2012)

Strictness could be regulated in different 
ways depending on the kind of content and 
participants.
