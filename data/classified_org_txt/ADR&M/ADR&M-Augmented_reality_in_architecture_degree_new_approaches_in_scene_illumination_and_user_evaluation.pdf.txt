Abstract- In this paper we report our experience in designing, 
developing and evaluating new didactic methods, in order to help 
students to improve their spatial and graphical skills. Specifically, 
in this educational research investigation, the goal is to evaluate 
the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in architecture, urbanism, to 
build construction and interior design of undergraduate, and to 
master students learning processes. We have used mobile phones, 
laptops, as well as low cost AR applications.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The main objective of this study is to assess the degree of 

satisfaction and integration of students using new visual 
technologies associated with mobile devices in the process of 
architectural design. To evaluate our objectives, we reviewed 
the state of the art related to the use of surveys to describe the 
user profile and to evaluate their satisfaction using new 
technologies, and the application of new technologies in the 
educational framework, as well as the degree of 
implementation of a specific technology such AR in 
heterogeneous frameworks and professional training. 

II. STATE OF THE ART 

A. Advanced Technology in Teaching Experiences 
The emergence of new communications technologies in all 

areas of society has created a new situation in the specific 
framework of the education and how we can integrate these 
technologies into the dynamic role of teaching. The constantly 
development of these digital technologies allows new models 
of information and requires user's skills improvement to 
manage all type of data in digital environments. These types of 
skills are often referred as “digital literacy” [1, 2]. As described 
[3], we can find a detailed description of the main skills 
ranging from cognitive to motor, sociological, and emotional. 
Some tasks required in this framework include the interaction 
with different displays and user interfaces, using digital 
reproductions or hyper-textual navigation to obtain a better 
mastering and experience with computer programs and 
navigation [4]. 

We can begin to find solutions implemented in pre-
university education that relate to higher education, especially 
in areas where the use of visual information is very important 
such as in the frameworks of multimedia, design, 
communication, or architecture and in any other area of higher 
education [5]. Some examples are the use of whiteboards, 
interactive books, social media and other eLearning resources 
[6], and more advanced systems in the visualization of 3D 
models, buildings and spaces in the architecture education, as 
interactive models, spatial analysis or new 3D mobile 
interactions [7] using AR, one technology with a great 
development in the last years [8].   

The introduction of more user-friendly technology (such as 
mobile phones, tablet, social networks, etc.), in the learning 
process is an educational strategy that removes the traditional 
and bored lectures. With these new methodologies the teacher 
achieves greater motivation in the monitoring of contents, a 
new interface to share educational material that allows a work 
timeless and adaptation to the professional technologies by the 
students.  

B. Designing User Test 
A basic topic in the experimentation and research of 

scientific hypotheses based on the user's response lies in the 
adequate design and use of different “test of user” or “survey of 
profile” that allows the extraction of data to study. 

A common mistake is to simplify these studies to the 
concept of “usability”. We could understand it as the interaction 
of a physical or virtual device with a user and his basic human 
capabilities [9]. Therefore, we can state the difficulty in 
establishing proper ways and adapt the study to test, measure, 
evaluate and compare measurable results that depend on the 
user experience. These processes require defining methods, 
metrics, processes and tools to measure how to fit each 
experiment [10]. 

In the teaching framework, the type of test to use is usually 
the main objective to determine usability of new learning 
processes of the training project. This approach means that the 
type of questions should be directed to the teaching

methodology and not the project itself, since the project 
evaluation is carried out with specific questionnaires related to 
it. In this way, by depending on the training method and the 
results, it will be possible to question the initial assumptions and 
review a more effective implementation of how teaching 
methods can incorporate new technologies favorably. 

In the survey design, to model the response of implementing 
new technologies in university teaching resources, there are 
prominent surveys, based on user profile, which focuses on the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the course, and on the level of 
satisfaction and student preferences. [11]. 

The most common parameters that we must consider in 
evaluating a new approach in teaching technology are the 
degree of knowledge of new technologies, the use made of 
social networks, computer known applications, and knowledge 
of the theoretical content of the course under the program. In 
our case we have focused on the application of augmented 
reality to improve teaching, the work is documented in all 
applications and modes of implementation. [12, 13, 14, 15]. 

C. Augmented Reality (AR)  
The creators [16] define AR as a virtual reality variation, 

where the user can see the real world with virtual objects, mixed 
or superimposed. In contrast to virtual reality, AR does not 
replace the real environment, but uses it as a background to be 
registered. The final result is a dynamic image of a 3D virtual 
model superimposed to a real time video of the environment. 
This scene is shown to the user in a computer screen or other 
devices, as projectors, digital board, special glasses, or in a 3G 
cell phone. This sensitive experience is essential for the rising of 
this technology. The main problem in architecture and building 
construction is to solve virtual objects and real images 
integration. Overlap must be accurate and at the right scale, in 
order to achieve its hypothetical situation and size matching in 
real scene. 

This technology, recently commercialized, covers different 
areas. If we focus our specific fields of study, we would 
emphasize the book edition applications, where trackers are 
added to show additional information, the best example is 
Magicbook [17]. In the field of the education, specific 
applications for maths and geometry have been studied [18, 19]. 
In architecture the use of AR is anecdotic; the precedents in this 
field are the indoor studies [20, 21].  

At Tinmith project, outdoors works have been also done. 
Other semi-immersive proposals which incorporate AR over 
screens in the study of urban projects are projects as Arthur 
[22], the Luminous Table [23] or the Sketchand+Benchworks 
[24], where different data entry devices are combined in a 
virtual theatre. More recently [25, 26], different tests on 
building renovation have been realized. In the urban planning, 
we may mention [27] and in the infrastructure of the 
construction enginery [28]. In the architecture teaching stand 
out [29, 30, 31, 32] devoted to objects design and to other more 
general teaching applications. There are some baseline surveys 
about the utility of these technologies on professional 
architecture companies [33] which had shown a big interest for 
it. 

 In our opinion, the quantum leap and dissemination of this 
technology is due to the fact that it is accessible from mobile 
phones thanks to the libraries ARToolkitPlus [34]. Mobile Ar 
software applications appear continuously, we may stand out 
MARA from Nokia or Layar, the first application of generalist 

use available both for iPhone and Android Os based phones. In 
2010, appears Junaio, the first markerless open-use application. 
It works with multimedia content (videos, renders, 3D models) 
registration is based on real environment images recognition, 
instead of preset patterns. Moreover, low cost AR plug-in for 
programs as Google SketchUp are generalising the use of this 
technology, but mostly indoors.  

D. Scene Illumination 
The problem of virtual models illumination and how it can 

be integrated into the scene has been also widely discussed. In 
the first approaches to RA, the virtual object was simply 
overlapped in the real environment. Major advances in 
technology focused on the correct calibration and registration of 
objects, studying the possible effects of occlusion and spatial 
coherence of objects, regardless of any other adaptation of the 
object in the scene. In other words, once the object was included 
in the scene, it was an artificial object, unable to adapt to the 
changes in environmental light. That kind of configurations 
lacked realism, and consistency of the scene was based only on 
geometrical aspects. 

The sensation of realism in the scene is obtained primarily 
through visual interactivity. While it is true that as more senses 
involved, a greater sense of realism is achieved, a realistic 
immersion system should be able to create a complete visual 
simulation or as close as possible to it.  

The current level of development of the technology required 
is still insufficient to achieve correct results in mobile devices. 
Most of the applications currently available, the realism of the 
images is sacrificed on behalf of interactivity in “real time”, to 
increase system operability, or ease of management, and not to 
the realism of sensory experience. We believe that a non-
integrated virtual object in the scene may invalidate any 
judgment that could be done on it, resulting implausible, 
unlikely and unattractive. 

The first research approach about how to incorporate 
lighting conditions in virtual objects appeared in the early 
1990's, [35, 36, 37, 38] but is in the last 10 years, when the 
international community has made an effort to provide 
automated solutions to calculate objects illumination from its 
environment [39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. And some systems have been 
designed recently to estimate lighting conditions and apply 
changes to virtual objects. They are able to cast and receive 
shadows dynamically and consistently [44].  

Some author’s approaches [45] identify three lighting 
techniques in order to improve the scene quality: common 
illumination, which are methods that provide some level of 
mixing, as the addition of shadows projected from real objects 
into virtual objects, and shadows casted by virtual objects on 
real ones.  

This is the approach that the teaching experience is based 
on. Although these techniques do not allow any modification of 
current lighting conditions of the scene we need to take into 
account for example the “relighting action”, which aims to 
incorporate dynamically into the scene new lighting effects such 
as shadows, intensity changes, new lights addition, indirect 
lighting effects, etc. Also we can find other actions as the 
“reverse light” or inverse illumination, which contains methods 
that attempt to recover the photometric properties of all objects 
in the scene. These methods estimate values of BRDF 
(Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function), as well as the 
type and position of the light sources in the real scene. The

information obtained can be used both for common illumination 
and relighting techniques.  

III. STUDY DESIGN 
Based on the theoretical study, we designed two tests, with 

the first focusing on evaluating the technological and social 
profile of the student and the second one designed to assess the 
implementation of AR technology in architectural education. 
The simplified models of the test (which had additional 
questions and specific thematic scope and implementation), we 
can see them in the next two tables:

IV. CASE STUDY 1: USING AR IN THE CLASSROOM  
We assume that students, digital natives, are common users 

of ICT, feel attracted to them, they can quickly learn how to use 
them in an intuitive way, and improve their use in a self-taught 
way. But most of the times they are not adequately trained about 
it. We try to exploit their attraction in order to study how these 
technologies and its implementation, with the use of new 
teaching methodologies, have an impact on their three-
dimensional visualization and free manipulation of architecture 
forms. At the same time, we want to find out if this issue can 
help to improve their performance in spatial comprehension 
processes and their graphical representation skills, from as early 
as the start of their academic years.  

In this sense, and as a teaching research project which 
involved large groups of students in regular courses, the 
solution adopted was to study how AR was integrated in 

different subjects depending on its specific contents. We use 
laptops or school notebooks, and with them 3D models have 
been generated and visualized on site, always using educational 
software like Gimp, SketchUP, Autocad, 3Ds Max, and 
exporting them using plug-in or AR free applications, such as 
Build-Ar or Mr Planet, Ar-media Inglobe Technologies or 
Junaio in order to be viewed through a web camera connected to 
a computer, or using 3G standard mobile devices Android or 
iOs based. 

A. Methodology 
For the development of every course it is necessary to create 

some didactic contents adapted to the subject and to the 
specificity of the proposed tests. We worked in coordination 
with the responsible for the subject who was in charge of the 
virtual construction exercises. In many cases it was necessary to 
carry out a brief training and to make some specific user 
manuals for 3D software or 3D modeling. 

The experiment was conducted using the personal laptops of 
the students using the integrated webcam and additional ones 
(Logitech C200). This configuration allows seeing indoor RA 
models RA using 20x20 cm. Markers. The virtual models were 
generated by Google SketchUp (each student had a free license 
for this programme) and then, were exported to AR using the 
free plug-in Ar-media Inglobe technologies whose duration of 
30 seconds allows basic adjustments. Alternatively, the teacher 
exports an AR model using the professional application 
ArExporter 2.0, so that students can see it for an unlimited time 
using the free viewer ArPlayer 2.0, once received by wifi or 
USB pen drive. (e.g. Fig. 1). 

 
Fig. 1 Images of teaching experience in the classroom (left) and interior spaces 

of the school 

The group size was 21 students to ensure it was a significant 
population sample. Similar number of students participated in 
other study cases. Using a specific questionnaire (see previous 
chapter), every student is asked about his performance 
assessment, about the amount of hours he or she has dedicated 
to the RA daily, and to consider if the educational resources 
have been appropriate to the complexity of the exercise.  

As we have referenced, we use SEEQ based questionnaires 
as an instrument of evaluation and auto evaluation by students 
(Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality [46]. In a similar 
way Applications usability and used hardware will be evaluated.  
We take user concepts parameterization from ISO norm 9241-
11 using a specific survey form, that will depend on the 
resources and computer technology used in every course. 

Students were required to “complete”, somehow, the real 
space where they work every day with virtual information,

B. Results and Discussion  
Over 85% of students were able to complete the exercise. 

All of them designed their virtual proposals, and were able to 
view them on the desktop using flat patterns. That activity 
helped the students to improve their competitions and skills on 
graphical computer science, beyond current knowledge of 
traditional technologies. AR technology allows them to view 
their proposals blended with real space, which would not 
otherwise have been possible. They get familiarized with the 
use of markers as elements to interact with three-dimensional 
digital content and the technology helped them to increase 
understanding of their proposals, and to share some ideas. 

In relation to students personal training and the prior 
knowledge level of the technology, it should be noted that the 
most often used applications were “Email” and “internet 
browsers” followed by office applications, CAD and photo 
editors. Less knowledge resulted in LINUX and AR systems. 
(Scale: 0 = none, 3 advanced). Therefore, despite the prior 
ignorance of AR technology, it was rated very positively at the 
end of the course. (e.g. Fig. 3). 

 
Fig. 3 Results average table about the prior knowledge of the technology 

Related to the opinion, teaching content, and material of the 
course, it should be noted that it was very high rated. Material 
representativeness, number of exercises in accordance with the 
objectives was optimal. The final average rating was more than 
4.00 out of 5 points (e.g. Fig. 4). The worst rated question was 
referred to the possibility of learning such content 
independently.

And related to augmented reality technology and software 
used, 100% of the students found them useful in the field of 
architecture and building construction, despite having no prior 
knowledge of it. (e.g. Fig. 5). 

 

Fig. 5 Percentage responses related to augmented reality technology and 
software used 

The overall assessment of the course was 4.18 points out of 
5. This gives an idea of the degree of satisfaction achieved. 

In a correlation analysis between the course global opinion 
and the other variables, a high correlation (0.69) was detected 
with: the representativeness of the exercises and the quality of 
the presentation. So these variables are crucial to the success of 
this teaching experience. Not being so correlated with the fact 
of being able to solve the exercises independently or with the 
number of exercises proposed. The strongest correlation (0.86), 
however, was in the use of appropriate software, and this is, 
therefore, the most important variable to be considered in future 
work. 

V. CASE STUDY 2: SCENE ILLUMINATION  

A. Methodology 
In this case, exercise was divided into two phases. In the 

first one, the fundamentals of technology, such as rendering, 
occlusion, tracking and register systems, were taught. We 
showed examples of most widely used applications 
implemented in different areas, so that, the student was aware of 
the possibilities that the use of the technology offered. 

Since we were working on indoor representation, we paid 
special attention to one of the weaknesses in the scenes of 
augmented reality, lighting immersion. Because most of the 
times, the virtual model lacks realism and is not integrated 
sufficiently into the scene to be credible. The problem lies in 
lighting conditions differences from real environment and 
virtual objects superimposed. This problem takes on special 
significance indoors, to visualize interior design proposals, 
because a non-integrated scene may seem unlikely and 
unattractive (see Fig. 6).

To solve this problem, students were trained to create 
textures and incorporate light conditions from surroundings, and 
also to cast shadows from virtual objects on real environment. 
They should create a virtual object identical to the real one. This 
object had, as a texture map, the image of virtual object casted 
shadow, simulating the environment light conditions, and 
should be transparent where it is was not projected (e.g. Fig. 7). 

 
Fig. 7 Texture maps to cast shadows in real space. On model basis, a lightmap 
is assigned as the main texture, and its inverse image is assigned as an opacity 

map to acquire transparency. So black pixels remained transparent, leaving 
visible only the cast shadow area 

We assumed that the knowledge of virtual objects modeling 
was acquired during their training as engineers or architects in 
previous courses related to computer graphics tools to represent 
and manipulate images and virtual models. 

In the second phase, students were required to create an AR 
scene in which we should take into account the ambient light 
conditions. Each student chose a random school space, and 
modeled their proposals, previously tested in the classroom, 
with different levels or layers to show in. Once we solved and 
discussed each specific case, modeling problems inherent in this 
technology as registration, texturing, lighting and occlusion, we 
proceeded to register (positioning) the model in its real location 
(classroom, school interior space.) 

That exercise allowed students to familiarize with the 
software provided and with flat patterns as suitable elements to 
interact with three-dimensional digital contents. Also it helped 
to verify feasibility of AR technology since proposals became 
more understandable, once virtual information was overlapped 
on real space. We tested occluders, environmental elements that 
were not visible in the scene but allowed to hide parts of the 
virtual model, to make the scene more believable. 

B. Results and Discussion 
Indoor AR technology implementation to visualize 

architectural proposals, as explained above, gave very different 
results because of the creative freedom of students and their 
different backgrounds. 90% of students were able to finish the 
exercise. They designed and modelled their proposals, and 
visualized their scenes on the desktop using flat patterns. 
Most of the students opted to design furniture pieces that 
incorporated in place (see Fig. 8). 

As we mentioned before, we evaluated user’s assessment 
based on three points: 

                  
Fig. 8 Consecutive steps showing virtual objects integrated in the scene 

• Effectiveness, defined as the user’s ability to complete 
tasks during the course, in relation to the “accuracy and 
integrity” that it had been made.  

• Efficiency, on the assigned resources, they asked 
questions related to the expenditure of time and effort for 
solving the proposed exercise. 

• Satisfaction, understood as subjective reactions of users 
about the course. 

The average of the responses related to the effectiveness, 
efficiency and satisfaction of the course were very similar, 
ranging from 3.59 to 3.73, out of  5 (see Fig. 9). 

 
Fig. 9 Final average rating 

In relation to student’s personal training and the prior know-
ledge level of the technology, results were similar to Case 1.  

Related to the opinion, teaching content, and material of the 
course, it was very high rated again. Material representativeness 
and the number of exercises in accordance with the objectives 
were optimal. The final average rating was more than 3.62 out 
of 5 points, which was lower than similar courses (case 1) 
probably due to the short time to carry out the exercise, and its 
difficulty. The question about the degree of satisfaction of the 
course in relation to the purpose for which it was designed 
(lighting integration tools in AR, to improve graphical 
representation) was of 3.86 points. And the possibility of 
learning such content independently was the lowest rated again. 
(2,57). 

And related to augmented reality technology and software 
used, 90% of the students found them useful in the field of 
architecture and building construction, despite having no prior 
knowledge of it.  

Finally it should be noted that lighting immersion, casting 
and receiving shadows from real environment, to make the 
scene more realistic, was the question with the highest score 
(4.29).

In this case, the overall assessment of the course was 3.67 
points out of 5. As we said, this course was lower rated than the 
first one, but we should have in mind that in the first case 
students create freedom models, in random spaces, and they not 
should integrate lighting, so the exercise was easier than second 
one. 

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION 
Regarding the project in its educational aspect, we have 

shown that using ICT, students with no prior specific training to 
AR, but motivated by these technologies, get substantial 
improvements in academic their performance and spatial 
awareness capabilities in a short time with a high degree of 
acceptance by them. We used for that a comprehensive 
educational strategy which combines the visualization and 
modelling 3D, incorporating agile and with a high level of 
usability digital graphics tools. We tested these strategies in two 
cases of study, supplemented with two different educational 
groups. In both we've got very remarkable improvement in 
performance.  

As we understand, in learning processes, the most important 
are the concepts to study and to represent in each case, so that 
the rendering technology helps, enhances and facilitates the idea 
discussion, and even allows a rapid assessment and review of 
projects. We don´t try to generate realistic images or final nice 
presentations, but working models, prototypes faster and easier 
to manipulate.  

In the immediate future we´ll repeat the experiments on 
larger groups samples, preparing more control groups at 
different levels of future architects, planners and building 
engineers, in order to obtain more reliable data and to obtain 
global conclusions.  

Related to questionnaires and students global opinion we 
should notice that it was highly correlated with exercises 
representativeness and with the quality of teacher’s 
presentation. So these variables are crucial to the success of 
these learning experiences. The fact of being able to solve the 
exercises independently or the number of exercises proposed on 
the course is not as important as we though at the beginning of 
the cases. Even more, the use of appropriate software could be 
the most important variable to be considered in future work. 
Finally, variables related to prior knowledge of technology and 
to the use of different software and operating systems did not 
correlate significantly with the course global opinion.  

Finally, in relation to the type of exercises, no teaching 
experiences have been found, and it focused mainly on lighting 
simulation in virtual models textures to make the scene more 
believable. 

In the experiment described, however, the image is often 
unrecognized in less favorable light conditions. And the scene is 
often inconsistent. That suggests that these systems are very 
sensitive to light conditions changes, and may become useless. 
The fact that indoor light conditions used to be under control 
could help to set the scene correctly.
