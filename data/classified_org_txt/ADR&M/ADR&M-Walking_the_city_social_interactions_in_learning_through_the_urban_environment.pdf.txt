The inclusion and the updating of the anthropological and urban studies carried out by Kevin Lynch and Jane
Jacobs in the sixties has facilitated the project Walking the City, which aims to promote the active perception
and the profound assimilation of urban experiences in the field of teaching urbanism. The city is perceived
through critical eyes, dynamic explanations and on-site debates to discover the added value of urban environ-
ments that usually remains hidden.

This research and teaching project has been developed since 2004, and year after year it has generated a
broad background enriched by contributions from a great number of social agents, who have consolidated it as
a singular academic experience in the Barcelona School of Architecture. Walking the City intends to develop
new forms of understanding the city and its elements by incorporating interactions with social agents and pro-
fessionals who have defined and are part of it. In short, its principal aim focuses on integrating the knowledge
about Barcelona, moving the learning process from the classroom to the real urban space.

The project analyses the interaction between the adjacent culture in Barcelona and the culture which students
provide from their knowledge and previous urban experience they have gained in their hometowns. Barcelona
appears as an urban laboratory analysed from three different perspectives: the morphological, related with
urban form, architectural design and open spaces; the social, produced by the anthropological observation car-
ried out by agents who belong to the social system of the city; and finally the cultural, analysed from student’s
pluralistic perspectives.

The methodology to conduct the project concentrates on three innovative bases in the field of teaching urban-
ism. The first basis is the guided routes around diverse urban areas of Barcelona, the second is the interpreta-
tion of urban experiences using graphic reports and the third is the introduction of ICT systems, which allow
debates on the virtual platforms created as an essential tool for the project.
