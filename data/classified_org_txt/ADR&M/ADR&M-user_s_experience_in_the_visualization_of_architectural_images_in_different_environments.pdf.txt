Abstract 
 
The visualization of images, both photographic and infographic, 
is a process that depends on a series of features that define the 
user (user profile: age, sex, culture or experience, etc.), the 
visual message (type of image, resolution, content, quality, etc.), 
and the display (size, resolution, type of screen immersive or 
not, etc.). When we can determine how the tree features relate, 
the communicative messages based on visual aspects will be 
more efficient for both the user and the technological output. 
 
The main objective of the research work presented in this paper 
is to determine whether differences in the visualization 
(immersive or not) of specific types of images (real and virtual) 
related to the architecture framework, differ depending on the 
gender of the user. The reflection of the existence of such 
differences in the future will allow us to define the 
characteristics of the image and the medium, and maximize the 
emotional communication of architectural ideas, depending on 
the type of user.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 
In recent years, the new immersive techniques of visualization 
have led to the control of big volumes of increasingly complex 
multimedia information, therefore facilitating its analysis, 
interpretation, and manipulation [1, 31]. 
 
The visualization of architectonic projects has gone through a 
fast evolution in the last 20 years, due to 2D and 3D CAD-CAM 
technologies. The use of traditional photography and models 
has not been done away with as aesthetic resources used to 
check the space and shapes. But, increasingly, aside from these 
high-quality models, the use of infographic techniques has 
allowed the generation of images and animation, that let the 
professional or the architect, study details, change textures or 
illumination in a faster, more interactive, and comfortable way.   
 
This work includes a multidisciplinary approach that aims to 
study the emotional response (affinity and activation) of a user 
according to the technique features of an image (color or black 
and white, and level of compression) and its display where it is 
visualized (immersive or not and the distance of visualization), 

in order to obtain some first approaches to the generation of 
images with correct parameters that will optimize the way the 
user visualize the architecture project. 
 

2. IMAGE PERCEPTION AND VISUALIZATION 
 
The generalized use of the digital image has been very popular 
during the last few years, especially on the Internet, where there 
are many image banks where users share millions of pictures 
every day, including Flicker, Getty Images, Fotosearch, and 
many more like them. This development has caused the constant 
study of new methods and applications to resolve the inclusion 
of descriptive parameters in the image, also known as metadata 
[17]. Most of the preferred methods [8,16,36] base their efforts 
in extracting automatically the descriptors that define the image 
from an objective point of view. That is, by describing the 
elements that compose the image [4, 12, 23, 33]. There are very 
few works that reflect the ideas or concepts unique to the user 
[18] and that personalize the result according to the user. 
 
For our study, we have used a system similar to Flicker: the 
image is stored externally in the database, but remains linked to 
all valuations that users do when they visualize it. Our 
iconographic system allows an easy navigation by the user, 
regardless of the display, and allows us an easy analysis of the 
data stored in the image. 
 
Image perception 
In a psychological area, we used works that would allow us to 
evaluate the differences of perception by the user [28], as well 
as measure the type and amount of emotions that the image 
provokes in the viewer [19]. We can find cultural differences as 
to how the user assigns different descriptors [26]. The 
interpretation of the colors, for instance, can have a direct 
influence on the emotions that the visual message generates in 
the viewer [38], and for this reason we believe that it is very 
important to find the best way to store them (the emotions). 

Paul Ekman, a professor in psychology at San Francisco 
University and one of the major recognised experts in this 
subject, has demonstrated that, by studying the facial 
expressions, these emotions are universal [10]. Simply put, they 
can be studied [9]:  
 

• By the use of a scale “pleasant-unpleasant” 
• By the use of a scale “active-passive” 



• By studying cultural and social differences, as 
emotional reactions are learned in a specific 
environment 

Centered in the field of psychology and neuropsychology, the 
main study of how the user reacts in front of an image is the 
IAPS (International Affective Picture System [30]), revised and 
replied in several studies to check out its validity within diverse 
cultural frameworks [3]. In the case of the original IAPS 
system, the emotions are grouped into three variables: “valence” 
or level of happiness; “activation” or level of excitement (also 
called arousal), and “dominance” or level of control sensation. 
This system is defined as an effective method to check out 
abnormal behavior and emotional dysfunction in several types 
of users [18, 20]. 
 
Colour and Quality 
The perception of color, as any other sense, is subordinated to 
subjective analysis criteria. Color depends on personal 
preferences, its relationship with other colors and shapes in the 
line of sight (contrast, expansion, received lighting, harmony 
with environment), the perceiver’s state of health, state of mind, 
and other factors.  We should mention that some experts cite the 
Hypothesis of Linguistic Relativism (HRL), which states that 
language can affect the chromatic perception in some aspects, as 
different languages divide the spectrum received by the user in a 
different way [34]. 
 
Psychology and experimentation with colors and photographic 
image have confirmed the emotional influence that colors have 
on a user [2, 6, 19, 22, 29, 37, 38], including the differences  
between men and women and their cultural environment [24, 
25]. On the other hand, we can find the quality perceived by the 
user. Nowadays, the study of quality perception in the image 
has generated great interest because of the benefits to business, 
and that has caused an increase in the research of this field [24, 
35]. 
 
However, it is very difficult to define the concept of quality and 
measure it in an image. To start, it depends on the physiological 
aspects of each user [6], which gets more difficult when 
subjective aspects, such as society or culture of the user [32], 
are considered. The work of Peter Engeldrum [11], describes a 
systematic method called Image Quality Circle, IQC, which 
orders the main elements that define the image quality. Among 
these elements, we can find technological variables, physical 
parameters of an image, and finally, the human determining 
factors of the perception process that generates the rate of an 
image quality. The interconnection of these variables allows the 
creation of a “psychometric scale” based on the user 
appreciations, taking into account the different cultural 
variables. In order to work with users with the purpose of 
defining some scales of quality perception[24], it is necessary to 
define different stages:     
 

• Psychophysical study to quantify the scales of 
perception. That is to say, the empiric study of models 
of human visual response, in which different concepts 
such as color, special and temporal sight, and different 
iterations, which lead to the final result, are related.   

• Modeling of visualization to cover all stimuli. 
• Iteration for verification. 

Whereas we can study and understand the relationship between 
the different elements by which we can value the quality of an 
image perceived, we will get closer to being able to define all 

features that an image must have so that the exercise of a user’s 
visualization is satisfactory and could be adapted to all 
requirements [27]. The assertion is based on the work described 
in this paper.   
 
Immersive visualization 
We can state that human vision is naturally immersive, as it 
places the individual in a specific environment. When we 
visualize a static image, this can be shown either in non-
immersive display (TV, computer, mobile phone screens, etc.) 
or in immersive display (either projected in 2D showing the 
image in Head-Mounted Display (HMD), or in 3D in virtual 
reality display such as Binocular Omni-Oriented Monitors, 
ImmersaDesk, CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment 
[7]). 
 
The user’s immersion allows the increase of peripheral vision, 
by increasing the communicative capacity of the environment 
and message, since the user is mentally absorbed by the 
environment [5]. But we need to know if this ability of the 
immersive display is affected by the characteristics of the image 
and the gender of the user. This is the initial hypothesis that we 
intend to explore in the following chapters.  
 

3. INTERACTION RESULTS 
 
Methodology 
We have generated a new web application of easy-use 
classification for both expert and non-expert users. It is also, 
easy to learn, allowing image indexing from the personal 
valuation of users, so that we can extract any user-related 
information from any device with an Internet connection. To 
achieve it, we have developed a system based on Open Source 
technology [13]. 
 

 
Figure 1.- Screenshot Test Webpage 

To generate an empiric approach in the visualization phase of 
architectural images, incorporating concepts, methodologies, 
and measurement techniques that are well established in media 
psychology and user-centered studies, we have divided our 
work into three phases: 
 
• Phase 1: Replication and valuation of the IAPS model and 

the on-line test system of the project.[14]. 
• Phase 2: Implementation of a model combining original 

images of the IAPS and images modified in color and 
compression [15]. 

• Phase 3: Implementation of a model combining images of 
the second phase (such as “control images”) and original 



images related to architecture (infographic, 
phototypesetting, and real images of projects). 
Architectural images have been presented both as originals 
and as the same type of compression and color-
modification as the images of stage 2.  

 
Study Phase: Number 3, evaluation of architecture image 
and immersive environment 
This test has been carried out in two environments: the first one 
(not immersive) with a computer screen (12 women, A:27,7 - 
SD:7,2 and 22 men, Av:28,86 - SD:7,01). 
 

 
Figure 2.- Users realizing test on Computer Screen 

The second one was with an immersive screen (Head Mounted 
Display, HMD) in our laboratory (6 women, A:25,83 - SD:6,36 
and 8 men, Av:27,25, SD:6,45).  
 

 

Figure 3.- Users realizing test on HMD 

The typology of users who carried out test number three was: 
teachers, students, and professionals of the architecture 
framework: and other users who are unrelated to the field. We 
took into consideration the resolution of the screen, 
visualization distance and image size, information that we will 
later use to study in depth the importance that the above 
mentioned parameters have in the visualization action. The 
value of the estimated error for this phase was 1.6% on the total 
sample of 2.980 valid punctuations, bearing in mind the 
response time of the user, and the variables that have remained 
without validating every image. 
 
Main Results 
The first experiment carried out was to observe the quality 
perceived by users in the specific case of images with a high 
compression level (JPG2000 black and white photographic 
images with a compression level of 95% equivalent to a bit rate 
of 0.05, according to the procedure of the previous phases).  
 
The results show us a clear difference in the visualization 
between male and female as we can see in the following figure: 
 

 
Figure 4. Quality Perceive (6 JPG2000 images in B&W High 
Compression) by gender in three environments: 1: HMD, 2: 

Computer Screen, 3: Projector Screen 

The quality perceived by women is higher viewing a large 
display with standard quality (reaffirming the initial study of the 

phase 2), while on close-up displays (computer screen and 
HMD) the average of perceived quality of the same images is 
lower. The behavior of women corresponds more closely to the 
expected model: When the image is visualized at a very short 
distance, pixels and the possible errors of compression are more 
easily perceived and the quality perceived decreased.  

The male behavior is an interesting case study. This group 
perceives the image with more quality in the screen (HMD) 
with minus resolution (HMD: 800x600, projector: 1024x768, 
computer: 1280x1024) with results very close to the projector 
screen. The visualization on a computer screen is where they 
perceive pixel details and compression errors more clearly, 
resulting in lower marks in comparison with the other 
environments. Also, we can observe (reaffirming previous 
results) that the quality perceived is directly related to the 
happiness and nervousness levels of the users (valence and 
arousal levels in the IAPS System): 

 

Figure 5. Arousal Average (6 JPG2000 images in B&W High 
Compression) by gender in three environments: 1: HMD, 2: 

Computer Screen, 3: Projector Screen 

In the previous figure we can see that for both men and women, 
a higher perceived quality leads to a decrease in the level of 
nervousness of the user, which results in greater empathy with 
the displayed image. 
 
The second study was focused on the evaluation of computer-
generated architectural images (also known as infographic 
images). We studied two environments (computer screen and 
HMD) with four types of images: JPG color original, color 
images compressed in JPG2000 with 80% and 95% rates, and 
finally uncompressed images in JPG, but in black and white. 
 
As predicted, the perceived quality decreases according to the 
level of compression (Figure 6). Further significant observations 
include the reduction of the quality perceived in the case of 
uncompressed B&W images (computer screen average:5,67-
SD:0,24; HMD average:4,99-SD:0,26) compared to the same 
images in color (CS_Av:6,28-SD:0,34; HMD_Av:6,18-
SD:0,48) and that the above mentioned decrease is more 
accentuated in HMD visualization (23,97 %) than with the 
computer screen (10,67 %). 
 

 

Figure 6. Quality perceived at infographic images. 1: Color without 
compression, 2: Color with 80% compression, 3: Color with 95% 

compression, 4: B&W without compression 



If we look at emotional behavior according to gender of users 
we obtain the following results: 
 

 

Figure 7. Valence and Arousal at infographic images. 1: Color 
without compression, 2: Color with 80% compression, 3: Color with 

95% compression, 4: B&W without compression 

As we can see, the behavior of the valence is similar to the 
quality perceived (which reaffirms their direct relation). 
Moreover, there is a clear emotional difference based on the 
display of visualization and that is corroborated when the 
information of the arousal is studied. 

The visualization in an immersive environment reduces the loss 
(more than 8%) of the valence (Av:4,61-SD:0,78) with regard to 
computer screen visualization (Av:4,27-SD:0,41), which 
maintains a direct relation with the perceived quality. 

Computer screen arousal follows the graphs of valence and 
quality, so we can affirm that there is a direct relationship 
between them, whereas in the case of immersive visualization 
we might conclude that the loss of quality observed generates a 
major excitement with a high decrease of the valence. 

4. CONCLUSION 
 
In architectural project visualization, and with images in 
general, we can distinguish the behavior of the users according 
to gender. Women perceive images with a better quality in not 
immersive and common environments (visualization in 
projector screen), while men value the perceived quality more 
highly in immersive environments (HMD). These data support 
the conclusion that the generation of images for a particular 
customer and for a particular display must take into account 
such variables for a streamlined communications experience. 
 
A direct relation exists between the perceived quality and the 
emotional evaluation of the image by the user. While the user 
does not perceive a quality loss, values the image with a high 
valence (in an independent way to the semantic category in the 
one that circumscribes the image), the perception of the errors 
of compression reduces the "affinity" with the image and 
increases the activation of the user (especially for the women). 
This behavior is more notable in immersive environment in 
comparison with classic visualization situations. 
 
The visualization of black and white images of architectural 
projects generates lower values than color images of equal 
resolution and quality of compression, generating in turn a 
decreased emotional response with respect to the project in 
color. 
 
The compression of infografic images must be much more 
restrictive than for photographic images, since at equal levels of 
compression (from JPG to JPG2000 to 80%), both the 
evaluation of the quality and the valence is lower when 
compared to photographic images. This observation, not only 
supports the values but, according to the typology of the image, 
it increases them. This situation is due to the fact that the image 
generated by computer “lacks realistic imperfections” which 

correspond to the real image, being more sensitive to the errors 
produced by the "pixelation" or the compression. Although it 
could use an extended future study.
