The cities in which we live are changing rapidly, presenting the scenery to debate future visions of trans-
formative designs and its impact on the city. In order to take advantage of the changes and opportunities
offered by the inclusion of digital technologies, an accommodation of the digital transformation into the
visualization of Urbanism is required. It is a challenge for organizations and society to question the status
quo and experiment often. The discussion about the increasing integration of digital technologies in urban
spaces involves a number of questions relating to the complex processes of transformation that impact
cities, like economic, social, political, and environmental. The main goal of the paper is to present the
use of Digital Transformation in processes of urban design through technological innovation in which
the diverse forms of active citizenship operate from below as agents of innovation, inclusion and social
development. The results showed that it is possible to empower Digital Transformation – as for example
the use Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) systems in collaborative urban design – to improve public
motivation, implication, and satisfaction in urban decision-making processes.

1. Introduction

In Urbanism there are four significant themes: (1) is for and
about people; (2) the value and significance of ‘place’; (3) operates
in the ‘real’ world, with its field of opportunity constrained and
bounded by economic (market) and political (regulatory) forces;
and (4) the importance of design as a process [1]. It is about con-
structing a scenario for urban evolution, imagining the conditions
of transformation andproposing a process capable of incorporating
new experiences into the human–environment relationship. Us-
ing technological innovation have an effect on the mode through

which social movements and the diverse forms of active citizen-
ship operate from below as agents of innovation, inclusion and
social development [2].

In the last decade, there have been various initiatives con-
ducted by researchers aswell as all type of organizations to explore
methods and technologies to foster the public participation in the
design and implementation processes of social projects. One of the
strategies, increasingly used, has been the implementation of these
projects through new digital media. However, the use of new tools
has not generated a digital transformation (DT) as was expected,
among other things because of the novelty of the proposals, or
even because of the use of technologies that are not commonly
used by users [3]. This lack of success in technologically innovative
proposals is due in part to an insufficiency ofmotivation on the part
of the user, which, together with a lack of experience in the use of
tools, condemns the proposals for transforming organizations into
innocuous efforts. For this reason, technological innovations must

be accompanied by a methodological innovation, which above
all, generates greater motivation on the part of organizations and
users. In this sense, it is increasingly common to find proposals that
base their initial efforts on methods such as gamification, to adapt
content and technologies to the needs and requirements of users.

Taking advantage of technology from the visual simulation and
virtual reality, provide a delivery system for organizations to get
closer to final users. Virtual reality has rapidly become one of
the most exciting new computer technologies — exercising a
strong hold on the popular imagination, attracting hundreds of
researchers, and spawning a booming industry [4]. Working on
the spatial transformation virtually is a supporting dimension of
the overall process of a structural change. We are in the need of
new collaborative design processes, adapted to the new social,
technological, and spatial context in which we live.

This article describes the role and use of technological innova-
tions in DT involving the social re-appropriation of urban spaces
and contribute to social inclusion in the city of Barcelona. It is
focused on studying the motivation, engagement, and overall ex-
perience of the participants with the technology. For this purpose,
we have designed a mixed evaluation method (using quantitative
and qualitative data), which allows us to identify the positive and
negative aspects in a more objective way. The general objectives
(or research questions) of this paper is to approach the following
topics:

• Combiningmodelwith real-scale proposals usingAugmented
and Virtual Reality in open spaces makes, is it possible to
define a new space-participation model, guided, on the local
scale, by single citizens, and by a local community.

• It is inferred that these initiatives could facilitate public de-
cisions through the social re-evaluation of spaces, real and
virtual, in order to respond to unsatisfied needs.

• Organizations can be able to incorporate informal data ob-
tained from citizens, urban and architecture professionals,
students, and consequently, designs can be executed with a
suitable design, adapted to space and combining the func-
tionality, needs, and interests of all of them.

The Section 2 of this article, analyzes the framework related to
the way Urbanism is practiced to see later on how technologies
are incorporated. Section 3, includes the explanation of citizenship
participation in the inclusion of digital technologies inside of an
organization and exemplified the use of digital transformation in
Urbanism through new ways of Urbanism. Section 4, presents the
project. Section 5, discusses the data obtained from the mixed
assessment, leading to the conclusions and future work of the
study, which are discussed in Section 6.

2. A new challenge for Urbanism

Urbanism theoretical maturity was reached in the twentieth
century from a combination of different disciplines that merged
to rethink the city. It was a time when specialists in the field
started to study more about the problems of our cities adopting
new methods of research and analysis, emphasizing more in the
scientific phase than the artistic one. ‘‘This may be due to a natural
reaction against past practice when city planningwas based on the
superficial city beautiful approach, which ignored the roots of the
problems and attempted only window- dressing effects’’. – Jose
Luis Sert [5]. Urbanismdeveloped as a newscience; concernedwith
the structure of the city, its process of growth and decay [5]. The
physical, social and cultural changes that we are experimenting
force the contemporary urbanist to a practice open to the processes
of socially responsible participation and the conscious interaction
of the culture that live- in each place.

InUrbanismcurrent technology-driven implementations,while
being an important step is important to understand that the main
actors are the people and the human dimension of cities. For
this, the conception of a participatory innovation system in which
citizens and communities interact with public authorities and
knowledge developers is key. This collaborative interaction leads
to a co-designed user-centered innovation models of governance.
The urban transformation inwhich citizens are themain ‘‘drivers of
change’’ through their empowerment andmotivation ensures that
the major city challenges can be addressed, including sustainable
behavior transformations [3].

To merge the main actors of the cities with the spatial forms
and processes it is understood to be necessary to adapt to the new
social, technological, and spatial context in which we live. Tech-
nologies, methodologies and tools for these urban processes are
various. Even processes that are now a common instrument, like
the computer, have opened a newworld to the Urbanism, through
new forms, new perspectives and new ways of analyzing data.
Psychosocial and post-occupational studies, new communication
media and ways of collecting data and technology that can detect
social, economic and environmental patterns of the urban spaces,
is supporting the discipline and bringing another dimension to the
practice. Also in the visualization aspects, the approach of Visual-
ization and understanding of 3D, which typically accomplished via
the classical view is changing due to a generational change and the
continuous improvement and development of technology [6].

Present and future changes that are leading to the necessity of a
faster utilization of a DT strategy, can be brought by several causes
like users’ behavior and expectations, new economic realities, so-
cietal changes and emerging digital technologies [7]. For this, DT
has the capability to renovate a sector’s activities, processes, com-
petencies, and models to force the changes and opportunities of
a mix of digital technologies and their accelerating impact across
society in a strategic and prioritized way, with present and future
changes in mind. Sectors that are involved in tackling societal
challenges such as urban deterioration and unpractical city spaces,
can take advantage of one or more of the existing and emerging
technologies. Using technological innovation have an effect on the
mode through which social moves and the diverse forms of active
citizenship operate from below as agents of innovation, inclusion
and social development [2].

Combining the innovative technologies to reach citizen partic-
ipation in decision-making about the construction of the city is an
essential condition for urban ecological regeneration. The act of
‘‘urbanizing’’ a project through DT requires a vision for what parts
of the process need to be transformed. In face of the enormous
amount of urban data that is needed to develop a proposal, the
field of Urbanism is yet to incorporatemany sources of information
into their workflow. Whether it is in the way students are trained
and professionals work and collaborate, the way processes are
executed, or in the way, it relates to the users, digital technology
provides a meaningful opportunity. Regardless of the enormous
amount of urban data to incorporate, representation technologies
bring ideas into reality, allowing communication between design-
ers, clients, contractors and collaborators [8]. This is the same as
for the professionals in the field and organizations should commit
to incorporate these technologies.

3. Social in DT

Currently, the ways we communicate have been changing and
adapting to newdevices and applications thatmostly involve char-
acteristics such as mobility, interaction and interconnection. [9]
describe the opportunities offered by these emerging technologies
as ‘‘creating a new kind of reality, one in which physical and
digital environments, media and interactions are woven together

throughout our daily lives’’. Informal data related to a public space
that analyze semantic, temporal and spatial patterns, aspects gen-
erally overlooked in traditional approaches, improve the process
of urban designing andmanagement in order to relate the projects
to the main needs of the citizenship. Through DT, organizations
should be able to incorporate informal data obtained from the
space, to develop more sustainable projects and products adapted
to more users and/or users with different profiles or disabilities.
The need to incorporate an informal approach to projects used by
the public is essential. For this, the use of the gamification of a
real space generates a virtual space and an urban environment of
simulation in which it is possible to make dynamic experiments of
participation and generation of ideas, uses or changes that improve
that space [10].

Gamification has been put forward as a tool to support the
process of civic participation that leads to sustainable civic en-
gagement through a process of collective reflection [11]. This tool
citizen enables citizens to observe their environment and reflect
collectively on spatial issues in their daily environment. There are
references to the use of gamification in urban planning processes
linked to other citizen participation such as the ‘‘Blockholm’’ -
Stockholm, 2014-, a game based on Minecraft promoted by the
Swedish Center for Architecture and Design of Stockholm that has
invited 100,000 users, technicians and experts in urban design and
citizens to participate. Other examples are the ‘‘Play the City’’, from
the Play the City Foundation implemented throughout 2012 in
different cities of Holland, Belgium, Turkey and South Africa and
which was based on a Word of Warcraft type game, or the use
of the ‘‘SimCity’’ game in its different versions in urban planning
workshops, highlighting the case of Cape Town in 2013.

They are basic proposals for zoning, for general uses at the
level of an entire urbanization, or for large-scale digital work.
In the significant case of Blockholm, informal teaching model is
applied since it is the citizen who generates a series of opinions
or suggestions for change that reaches the students externally
since the whole process is outside the academic scope. The same
happens in the cases of SimCity or Play the City, where part of the
results revert to contents of informal use in the student’s training
but are more focused on specific practices of professional projects.
In this sense, this experience is the closest to our approach, given
that we have defined challenges to be solved by users and that
generate complementary informationprior to the generation of the
project, knowing the type of participants, their opinionsmodifying
the scenario and it can be interpreted as the support or rejection of
a proposal.

Using new technologies, as for example VR and AR, we can
work with defined urban proposals rehearsing various strategies
of action in an interactive way and collaboratively evaluate pub-
lic spaces. It is important to take into account how the VR is a
technology, that applied correctly, can be a tool to involve society
and democratize decision making in complex projects, like urban
ones. Taking into account that the basis of the VR is to create an
immersive experience and allow the user to interact with objects.

4. Case study

The urban project we work on, promoted by the Barcelona City
Council, aims to create a large public space that prioritizes the peo-
ple of the Eixample Esquerra District instead of the vehicles (Figs. 1
and 2). They want to generate spaces that are designed tomeet the
needs of the users: spacious, pleasant spaces full of vegetationwith
dynamic uses and according to the needs at all times. According
to their criteria and collaboratively, configuring elements such as
spaces for children’s games, urban gardens, vegetation, lighting,
recreational and cultural activities, among others. They stated the
following conditioners:

• Address the street primarily to pedestrians
• Prevent spaces for stay and neighborhood coexistence
• Increase the low vegetation while maintaining the alignment

of trees typical of the Eixample
• Increase the surface of rainwater catchment on the terrain
• Establish criteria for the location of furniture and services

(garbage bins, cargo download, bar terraces. . . )

For this, we created a virtual reality game in which through inter-
active elements, the participants shaped the urban public space.
We exposed to the public to use ‘‘wearables’’ technologies such
as RV glasses and RA in Tablets to know how virtual reality can
help us to participate in a city-planning restructuring project in
our city, such as the Superilles (super squares) in Barcelona (Fig. 3).
The testing of this technology includes both, quantitative and
qualitative techniques,with the variable of a gamified proposal and
the use of visual technologies, aspects that brings innovation, and
immediacy. The focus of this testing is to study the motivation,
engagement, and overall experience of the participants with the
technology, more than the effectiveness of the approach, as the
whole urban design process has not been completed, and still
ongoing.

The objective is to bring all citizens the technology of virtual
reality so that they can participate in the definition of the uses
of the public spaces of the city of Barcelona such as the Urban
Mobility Plan Superiors (PMU) 20132018, and help to build the
city that we all want in a participative way. At the end Barcelona
City Council (organization interested) wants to create a space that
prioritizes the people, designed tomeet the needs of the users, then
is the people who have to collaborate to achieve this goal. This
methodology brings the participants as an active element of the
project, able to preview the space, propose changes and be part of
what later on will be a livable space.

The virtual reality allowed participants to see in an immersive
way the changes and actions that happen in the environment in
real time (Fig. 4), for example, in the calculation of specific lighting
in a space to show a very dynamic and realistic result. Some
participants’ proposals, inserted into the simulated environment,
have the capacity to be in constant interaction by moving and
rotating actions. The procedure that the participants followedwas:

1. The explanation of the project was exposed and so the
description of the experiment, the technology and the way
they would take part in the project;

2. The way to use the tool was to explain, for example, how
to use the controls, how to move on the space, how to grab
objects, how to move and rotate the objects, how to choose
them from a catalog and how to see the cost of each object;

3. The controls and the helmet are given to the participant to
start the using the tool, get immersed in the virtual world
and start to get familiar with the navigation system;

4. The participant is exposed to a pre-built environment, with
all the existing buildings already in the site, and they get to
see the catalog with all the options of objects;

5. Participants have already identified their necessities. In our
case, taking into account the limited timeof the test,wehave
proposed one challenge: to create a summer cinema in the
street, choosing objects that are organized in categorieswith
a limited budget;

6. Participants start to interact in the space, moving to the
specific place they want to propose a use and grab the
objects they want, drop then in site and move and rotate
them to the exact position they want;

7. When participants are choosing the objects they get to see
the price of each object.

An interesting feature of this tool is that participants get to see
what they are proposing in real time. Objects throw shadows, the
participant get to choose if the environment is seen in daytime or
nighttime and see in real time the lighting being put on any section
of the street and how it is affected by the color, intensity or type of
light being used, they get to see a real-time map while they are
moving through the space to see their situation within the city and
have a visible pointer that select the objects and select the options

in the menu (Fig. 5). This method allows the participant to see in
a very immersive way the changes and actions that happen in the
environment in real time. The rendering engine, Unreal Engine 4,
allows the calculation of these features in a space to show a very
dynamic and realistic result.

The behavior of a user of a new system or proposal provides
information crucial for the success of its final implementation.
In the experimentation and scientific research, if we work with

many samples (a minimum of 30–50 samples), we can manage
collected data quantitatively and the results can be studied and
compared in order to find statistical differences. With fewer users
(less than 10), however, the qualitative approach has proven to be
equally valid with the ability to obtain a detailed explanation of
the variables of the study [12]. In this frontier, a hybrid approach
to experimental methodology has emerged: the mixed-methods
research approach. We can define the mixed method research as
the natural complement to traditional qualitative and quantitative
research [13,14]. This model is based on a pragmatic paradigm
that contemplates the possibility of combining quantitative and
qualitative methods to achieve complementary results.

5. Results: data and discussion

To collect data, we conducted two experiments: In phase 1,
experimentation was carried out in the framework of the Fair
Research in Direct 2018 (with the data discussed in Section 5.1)
and in phase 2 (Section 5.2), we replied the same experiment in
the framework of the Architecture School of La Salle, Ramon Llull
University. The purpose of this separation was to be able to com-
pare the results by the user’s profile and identify the assessments,
perceptions and needs according to this.

5.1. Phase 1

For the quantitative approach, we delivered the participants
questionnaires after using the virtual, the augmented or both pro-
posals (which is based on previous experiments done in architec-
ture educational framework, [6,15]). In the first block, we obtained
personal information (age and sex) which pointed out: 46 women
under 18 years old (mean age of 15.52 years with a standard

deviation (SD) of 1.17), 70 men under 18 years old (mean age of
15.18, with a SD of 1.28), 6 women over 18 years old (mean age
of 25.83, with a SD of 9.41), and 13 men over 18 years old (mean
age of 23.40, with a SD of 9.09), for a total of 135 participants.
In the second block, we design a Likert scale where participants
evaluate the answer from 1 to 5 their level of agreement with
the statement exposed. The participants were consulted using 13
statements about different aspects: seven related to IntrinsicMoti-
vation Inventory (IMI#), three questions focused on the social view
of the citizens (Soc-Urb#), and the lasts three questions related
architecture framework and digital skills (Dig-Sk#):

• IMI1: I like and have fun using virtual environments
• IMI2: I understand the space better with 3D visual systems

rather than with plans and models
• IMI3: Using virtual and gamified systems requires less effort

to understand
• IMI4: The use of interactive systems generates less stress than

traditional systems
• IMI5: By knowing the new visual systems, will change my

way of working in the future
• IMI6: Games and interaction are useful for my future and can

benefit me
• IMI7: These systems help me to interact with other users/

friends/colleagues
• Soc-Urb1: These systems facilitate decision making in urban

projects
• Soc-Urb2: The RA/RV systems allow the design and

re-evaluation of urban spaces
• Soc-Urb3: They allow to identify possible unsatisfied social

needs

urban spaces.

• Dig-Sk1: With the information obtained from the users, the
students can incorporate the data to optimally modify their
projects and proposals

• Dig-Sk2: The opinion of the final users helps and should serve
to improve the training /competences of the student

• Dig-Sk3: These systems help to improve the digital skills in a
complex representation of students

Focused on the theme of the Project (based on the design and
virtual interaction of new proposals for the use of urban space and
the adaptation to the space of both proposals and users), the data
collection made in this article is significant as identifies a series of
variables to pay attention in the process of system development.
The 95% of users had never used an interactive VR system, and the
remaining 5% had only used it for basic visual exercises. This data is
interesting because, in previous studies (CINAIC), the absence of a
previous use had been reflected with a reduced initial motivation,
with an IMI of 3.0, which increased significantly once the system
was used, reaching 3.9, taking into account that the sample was
composed of architecture students.

By graphically analyzing the average obtained responses related
to technologies used and perceptions/motivations, we observed
similar behaviors in the four groupswith highmotivation, butwith
three levels below 4, with a margin of improvement IMI4 (3.64),
IMI5(3.82), IMI7(3.74) (Fig. 6).

In the present study, with users outside the architectural field,
the IMI average stood at 4.03, without significant differences at a
global level neither by age nor by gender. This result is encouraging
since it allows us to affirm that with the adequate training and
practice time students can increase their degree of motivation in
the use of interactive RV systems, and therefore a better prepara-
tion for the transversal use of them. Regarding the variables as-
sociated with the social/urban uses (identified with the questions
marked as Soc-Urb#), and the improvement of digital skills in the
students (identified as Dig-Sk# questions), the overall balance is
satisfactory, all indicators are equal or above 4 (Fig. 7).

These results demonstrate a highly positive assessment by
users regarding the issues designed. The average of the questions
related to the utility of the system for the decision-making and
re-planning of urban uses (Soc-Urb questions), have an average of
4.24/5. Higher is the result (4.34/5) related to the perception that
these systems are an educational help to improve the digital and
spatial competences of the students.

We have also analyzed and compared the responses by gender.
To estimate the probability that the groups were significantly
similar, we used Student’s t-test with the null hypothesis (H0)
of no differences in mean scores between the groups. Statistical
significance (two-tailed) is 0.077, which exceeds the threshold of
0.05, which means that there is a very low probability (minus that
5%), that the groups are different in their general assessment of
all variables studied. The null hypothesis, which states that there

Skills of the students.

Fig. 8. IMI results by gender.

are no significant differences between groups (male and female), is
accepted, but in a detailedway, we find some statically differences.
The most relevant are:

• IMI-4 ‘‘The use of interactive systems generates less stress than
traditional systems’’ detects significant differences between
genders. Using the same comparative system as in the pre-
vious comparison, and with the null hypothesis (H0) that
therewere no differences inmean scores between the groups,
we found that the statistical significance (two-tailed) was
0.0001, below the standard threshold of significance of 0.05.
This result indicates that there was a significant difference
in the responses between young female (with an average of
3.38, and SD of 0.92), and males (average of 3.73 and SD of
1.03), as occurs with adult sample (with a female average of
2.83 and SD of 0.16, in front of male average of 4.30 and SD of
1.06), and we can see grouped in Fig. 8.

• IMI-7 ‘‘These systems help me to interact with other users/
friends/colleagues’’, detects again a significant difference (two-
tailed, 0.004) between boys (average of 3.52, SD of 1.41), and
girls (average of 2.92, SD of 0.91), being again better perceived
by the boys. A difference that does is not endorsed in adults
as in the previous case (significant difference of 0.401).

These results related to motivation and how VR generates a dif-
ferentiated level of stress by gender, an aspect that in the literature
is defined as Dominance [16], has been previously referenced at
various levels [17–19]. Some of these studies [20–22], position this
behavior due to a habitual difference in the use of technological and
virtual systems depending on the users, theirmotivations and their
‘‘game’’ preference, an aspect to take into account for the possible
future configurations of the Project.

gender.

• Regarding the variables associated with the social/urban uses
(identified with the questions marked as Soc-Urb#), and the im-
provement of digital skills in the students (identified as Dig-Sk#
questions) represented in Fig. 9, we have found only one significant
difference in the SocUrb-3 ‘‘They are allowed to identify possible
unsatisfied social needs’’ (0.040), with clearly higher values for adult
men (4.46 with SD of 0.76), than women (3.66 with SD of 0.66).

Analyzing the responses by age (Fig. 10). Focused on the IMI
results, the statistical analysis revealed that:

• IMI-3 ‘‘Using virtual and gamified systems requires less effort
to understand’’, reflects a significantly higher value (0.044)
between adults (4.42, SD of 0.81), and young people (4.02, DS
of 0.79).

• IMI-7 ‘‘These systems help me to interact with other users/
friends/colleagues’’, again, indicates a significant difference by
age, with a higher score for adults (4.10, SD: 1.21), compared
to the kids (3.43, SD: 1.41).

These differences show how VR systems allow an easy under-
standing of space and are perceived as systems that can enhance
collaboration among users. This feature is clearly highlighted by
older users, and that may potentially need systems and support
aids for complex activities in digital environments, due to their lack
of experience [23].

Analyzing the results of the social/urban uses and digital skills
questions (Fig. 11), the main differences are:

• Soc-1 ‘‘These systems facilitate decision making in urban
projects’’ reflects a significantly higher value (0.0025) be-
tween adults (4.57, SD of 0.25), and young people (4.12, DS
of 0.65).

Fig. 11. Social/urban uses and improvement of digital skills using VR results by age.

• Soc-2 ‘‘The RA/RV systems allow the design and re-evaluation
of urban spaces’’, again, shows a significantly higher value
(0.0021) between adults (4.63, SD of 0.24), and young people
(4.17, DS of 0.77).

On the other hand, the results of the social use variables show
a clear differentiation between the needs and uses perceived by
young people in these systems, and the ‘‘serious game’’ approach
perceived by adults.

Based on the results obtained through the completed quan-
titative surveys, and in line with previous studies with mixed
approaches, we completed a series of Bipolar Laddering inter-
views [24], to specifically identify relevant aspects, both positive
and negative, of the experience that can explain the results ob-
tained in the quantitative phase [25,26]. The BLAmethodworks on
positive and negative poles to define the strengths andweaknesses
of a product. Conducting a BLA consists of three steps: Induction
of the elements, marking of elements, and element definition. The
questions ‘‘Why is it a positive/negative element?’’ and ‘‘Why this
score?’’ are asked. The answer must include a specific explanation
of the exact characteristics that make the mentioned element a
strength or weakness of the product.

In this type of analysis, the Positive/Negative Common (PC/NC)
elements are the most representative because they are the most
cited (Table 1). Depending on the reference rate and its average
obtained value, we can identify the most relevant elements. From
the analysis of the qualitative interviews through the Bipolar Lad-
dering the results are:

In Table 2, we can observe the comments identified by only
one user (particular elements), and finally, in Table 3, we have
grouped the main solutions and points of improvement. All these
solutions were divided according to whether they were cited for
more than one person (common improvements with its mention
index), or only by one person (particular improvements identified
by the user).

The analysis of the qualitative approach revealed that amajority
of the participants experienced good sensations of reality and
quality with the designed space (1PC) and its elements (5PC), with
its movements (2PC), and with the designed interactions (3PC).
In general, it could be defined as an enjoyable system (4PC). At
the opposite extreme, the learning process (1NC) and the first
moments are not as natural as expected. This is related to the
understanding of the workspace (potential need for a map and
the limits of work, 5NC), usability issues such as menu location or
program jumps (2NC & 3NC), and the classic effects of dizziness
associatedwith VR [27]. These negative aspects are directly related
to the quantitative variable of lower valuation (IMI-4). In line
with previous studies that show the relationship between negative
emotional behaviors with visual aspects of new technologies, such
as lack of quality, visualization distance, etc. [28].

After this testing, the results clearly identified that the aspects
to be improved in the proposal are (see common aspects of Table 3)
the improvement of the interaction with space and objects, the
quality of the graphics and the reality of the objects. All of them
are aspects that can be directly linked to the variables of social
and urban use Soc-Urb1 and Soc-Urb2, variables with significant
differences in their broken down study.

Undoubtedly, it is demonstrated that this mixed approach al-
lowed us to more precisely identify the positive and negative ele-
ments of a workingmodel. We depend on the participants to show
where it is necessary to strengthen the experience to improve the
results in future iterations of the method. It was validated that
the younger participants, born into a ‘‘digital age’’ and defined as
Digital Natives, adapted better to a high density of technological
content in the educational environment.

5.2. Phase 2

However, after collecting the results and conclusions we no-
ticed the limited variation of participants, in terms of age, having a
majority of participants were under 18 years old, but particularly
with a profile not related to the urban and architecture field. To
consider the opinions and feedback of a more diverse population
in terms of age and including participants that are trained or with
experience in the conceptualization of urban planning, and the
technological uses of digital applications, we made a second test,
place at Architecture School of La Salle, Ramon Llull University.
These participants had the same procedure to do the test than the
first group that was tested in the Museum Cosmo Caixa Barcelona,

spaces (CTII).

on the Research Fair in Direct. In this second group, the samplewas
Architecture students and faculty (identified as CTII – Computer
Tools II): 15 women over 18 years old (mean age of 24.80 years
with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.26), 14 men over 18 years old
(mean age of 25, with a SD of 2.29), for a total of 29 participants.

In the second group (CTII), the IMI average stood at 3.64 (Ta-
ble 4), without significant differences at a global level neither
by age nor by gender. This lower result is related at first to the
utility/complexity perceived by the system, based on the quali-
tative comments collected and not treated within this article. In
summary, participants perceive a very powerful environment but
with a long and complicated learning, without it being clear the
immediate utility in the architectural and urban project process.

Table 7
Comparison of Social/urban uses and improvement of digital skills using VR results.

Regarding the variables associated with the social/urban uses
(identified with the questions marked as Soc-Urb#), and the im-
provement of digital skills in the students (identified as Dig-Sk#
questions) we found also lower levels in the group of CTII in front
of the RFD sample. The average of the variables Soc-Urb# for the
sample of the RFD is placed in a 4.27 with respect to the 3.73
of CTII, similar levels as for the variables Dig_Sk # (4.37 vs. 3.88
respectively) (Table 5).

We compared the responses of the two groups, RFD, and CTII,
(Tables 6 and 7, using the Student’s t-test for assessing the differ-
ences, and based on the null hypothesis (H0) of no differences in
mean scores between the groups.

Based on the results (Statistical significance obtained below the
threshold of 0.05, which allows to affirm a guaranteed difference
of at least 95%), we can affirm that there is a clearly differentiated
behavior according to the profile of the users of the system. Re-
garding the variables associated with the IMI test, we have found
statistical differences in the variables # 1, # 2, # 4 & # 7, but in the
case of variables associated with the social/urban uses (identified
with the questions marked as Soc-Urb #), and the improvement of

digital skills in the students (identified as Dig-Sk # questions), we
have found statically differences in all variables. In Table 8 we can
observe the results of the comparison between samples using the
t-Student (based on different variances of the samples).

The clearly lower averages of the users related to the architec-
tural educational environment canbe attributed to factors such as a
lack of initial motivation in systems that have not been previously
used and over which they have not been trained. Also, can be a
perception of lack of utility in their needs of the professional ac-
tivity to which they add the perception according to these systems
are agents closest to leisure or external uses of the architectural
professional field.

On the other hand, and at a user level, systems such as AR or
VR are technologies that we could curiously say are closer and
less specific than more common tools as CAD (Computer Assisted
Design) and BIM (Building InformationModeling) systems, that are
the main technological tools used for modeling the architectural
space, due to its fast learning curve, its high degree of imple-
mentation in subjects like workshop/projects/urban planning, and
its constant use. This type of interactive technologies and with a
certain gamified component is found increasingly common in all
types of environments, ranging from early educational phases to
all kinds of applications at play, tourism, culture, etc. Undoubtedly,
this aspect is what most general users perceive as part of the
potential of the tools evaluated and that is demonstrated in the
high result of them.

6. Conclusions and future work

It is clear that the integration of DT as a tool in the process of
the urban design generated positive feedback. Themain innovation
of this case study is the design of a practical system to recognize
the informal data generated by the citizenship, and how by using a
mixed method we can extract important data that can contribute
to the government of Barcelona related to Urbanism. For this, it
was validated, through the results that the implementation of a
method can be used as a method for organizations to incorporate
the opinion of the end-user and help to execute a suitable design,
adapted to space and combining the functionality and interests of
citizens. Furthermore, one of the purposes of this type of research
is to show that city challenges can be more effectively addressed
at the scale of neighborhood and to provide an example and expe-
rience that demonstrate with the participation of the people who
live, work, and play in that space and shifts the emphasis from top-
down concept to a human-centric problem-solving.

From this study is verified that the use of Digital Transformation
in processes of urban design and citizenship, through innovative
concepts and practical methodologies, such as AR/VR systems im-
prove public motivation, implication, and satisfaction in urban
decision-making processes. Participants were receptive and aware
to adapt to this new paradigm using advanced visualization meth-
ods. From the results, we identify that it is a fun tool to use, that
these systems help to improve the digital skills in complex repre-
sentations and that they should allow the design and re-evaluation
of urban spaces. This aspect reflects the usefulness of the method,
the potential use in organizations and with stakeholders, and that
it is possible to define a new space-participationmodel, guided, on
the local scale, by single citizens, and by a local community. The
end to show how to facilitate participatory design, the motivation,
engagement, and overall experience of the participants with the
technology, more than the effectiveness of the approach, as the
whole urban design process has not been completed, and still
ongoing.

However, an aspect to be re-evaluated is the fact that the par-
ticipants gave lower point to the affirmation that this tool allows
to identify possible unsatisfied social needs and to the affirmation

that the use of interactive systems generates less stress than tra-
ditional systems. For this, it would be important to improve the
interaction with space and objects, the quality of the graphics and
the reality of the objects. Our future experiments will be related
with the study of the correlation between the interaction of the
user and the visualization method and the way they can manage it
to serve as a tool to satisfy their needs. In addition, we will focus
our future proposals to integrate of Digital Transformation in the
urban design through innovative concepts and practical method-
ologies to improve public motivation, implication, and satisfaction
in urban decision-making processes.
