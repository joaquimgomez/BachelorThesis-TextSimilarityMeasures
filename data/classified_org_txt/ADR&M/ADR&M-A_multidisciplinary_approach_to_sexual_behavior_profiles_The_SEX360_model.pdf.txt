Abstract The diversity of sexual behaviors is driven by multiple determinants,
including physiological, cultural, educational, and sociological factors. However, the

definition of sexual behavior profiles has been barely addressed from a compre-

hensive point of view. We aimed to develop a multidisciplinary questionnaire for

defining individual sexual behavior profiles. The questionnaire was developed by a

panel of experts with research experience in the fields of urology, gynecology,

psychology, anthropology, and sexology. The list of items was defined in a focus

group session and was based on four categories—family-oriented, loving, recre-

ational, and functional—resulting from the combination of two axes: traditional

Delphi dynamics was used to assign a weight to each question and a bias to the

corresponding responses. The final questionnaire included 50 items considered rel-

evant for describing sexual profiles; the final questionnaire was named SEX360. Of

the 50 items included in SEX360, 14 were considered essential for computing the

final score; 9 of them were associated with 2 categories, 4 of them with 4 categories,

and 1 of them with 3. Nine items referred to the category ‘‘family-oriented’’, 10 to

‘‘loving’’, 8 to ‘‘recreational’’, and 9 to ‘‘functional’’. The weights assigned to each

question ranged from 3.00 to 4.33, and the centers of gravity ranged from 1 to 4. The

questionnaire proposed shows the existence of a vast diversity of sexual behavior

profiles and may serve as a tool for sexual behavior research.

Introduction

The modern conception of sexology and sexual behavior began in the early 1970s

with the scientific approach to sexual disorders proposed by Masters and Johnson

(Masters and Masters 1980; Johnson et al. 1994; Masters et al. 1995). In their book

Human Sexual Inadequacy, Masters and Johnson suggested various sexual profiles

and behavior patterns based on studies recruiting prostitutes as the primary source of

information for sexual behaviors. This early definition marked the onset of a period

in which the approach to sexual behavior and sexual dysfunctions was mainly

psychological. More than one decade after the work carried out by Masters and

Johnson, the development of echo-Doppler flowmetry and neurophysiological

procedures helped explain many sexual disorders physiologically, launching a new

stage labeled by some authors as ‘‘medical reductionism’’ (Jannini et al. 2010). This

new conception of sexuality and sexual disorders was enhanced by the emergence of

pharmacological treatments for the management of major sexual dysfunctions such

as erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation and hypoactive sexual desire disorder

(Hatzimouratidis et al. 2010; Waldinger 2015; Robinson et al. 2016). Still, clinical

trials investigating the efficacy of treatments for sexual dysfunctions report

remarkable contributions of the psychological domain in sexual disorders (McCabe

1997; Trudel et al. 1997; Leiblum et al. 2007; Hayes et al. 2008; Mathers et al.

2009; Andersson et al. 2011; Melnik et al. 2012; Akasheh et al. 2014; Boddi et al.

2015).

From a clinical point of view, there is currently a broad consensus on the fact that

sexual disorders may be psychogenic, organic, or both (Montorsi et al. 2010).

However, the study of sexual behavior requires the inclusion of other dimensions

beyond the psychological and physiological domains. An example of this is the

changes in sexual behavior and attitudes observed during the emergence of sexually

transmitted diseases in the 1990s, which indicated that cultural, social, and

educational domains have a strong influence on sexuality (Tuzin 1991; Ku et al.

E. Garcı́a-Cruz et al.

123



1998). In fact, the AIDS outbreak motivated the incursion of anthropology in the

scientific arena of sexual research and brought about an alternative approach based

on the result of an interaction of cultural ideas and psychobiological impulses

(Tuzin 1991). However, to date, there are few examples of comprehensive sexual

research involving all areas of knowledge concerned with sexuality (e.g. medicine,

anthropology, psychology, sociology, etc.), and it seems that each area is rather

attached to its own paradigm. The little receptivity to other areas of knowledge is

particularly noticeable in the clinical environment, where sexual health is very often

seen as the mere absence of sexual disorders, rather than the fulfillment of autonomy

and wellbeing in sexuality (Hawkes 2014). At this point, we believe that the study of

sexuality should transcend the clinical framework based on the psychological-

organic binomial and move forward to a comprehensive definition of sexual profiles

which considers the multiple dimensions of sexuality. The aim of this work was to

present a first attempt at the definition of sexual profiles based on a self-

administered questionnaire conceived by a panel of experts in the fields of urology,

gynecology, psychology, anthropology, and sexology.

Methods

Due to the limited literature on the definition of sexual profiles, we based our work

entirely on the background experience of a panel of six experts with extensive

research experience in the fields of urology, gynecology, psychology, anthropology,

and sexology. The consensus process was structured into three meetings and

approached through either focus group sessions or real-time Delphi dynamics

combined with open discussions. In the real-time Delphi methodology, each expert

provides a response to a given question anonymously. An external facilitator

presents a summary of all responses—or a measure of central tendency and

dispersion, for quantitative responses—and the result is openly discussed. Experts

can modify their responses and discuss the new result again until a pre-set condition

for consensus is reached. In our case, the Delphi methodology was used to agree on

quantitative data; hence, consensus was deemed reached when the resulting median

had an interquartile range (i.e. percentiles 25 and 75) of 1 or less in a 6-point scale.

The first meeting, which took place on June 2016, addressed the list of items to

be included in the questionnaire. To this end, experts were asked to provide at least

ten questions—along with the corresponding suggested answers—that they

considered relevant to define a sexual profile. To facilitate the understanding of

the model, categories were established according to two axes: traditional versus

non-traditional and sexual benefit versus extra-sexual benefit. The following four

categories resulted from these two axes: family-oriented (i.e. traditional and extra-

sexual benefit), loving (i.e. traditional and sexual benefit), recreational (i.e. non-

traditional and sexual benefit), and functional (i.e. non-traditional and extra-sexual

benefit). For homogeneity, all incremental responses were tailored to a 6-point

Likert scale. The list of items was openly discussed in a focus group moderated by

the facilitator, who assisted experts in eliminating redundancy and ruling out

questions with little influence on profile definition.

The purpose of the second meeting was to assign a weight to each question and to

estimate a bias of the responses by using a real-time Delphi methodology for

consensus (Monguet et al. 2016). First, experts were asked to assign a global weight

to each question by anonymously suggesting a score from 1 (little influence on the

model) to 6 (great influence on the model) to each question. The experts could then

see the median score and who of them were out of the interquartile range. The

reasons for each score were discussed openly and the experts had the opportunity to

revise their choice in subsequent rounds. Figure 1 shows the interface used during

the real-time Delphi process.

In addition to weighting each question in the general model, the experts assigned

an estimated bias to the answers. The rationale for this bias was that the strength of

each score on the 6-point Likert scale when approaching the respondent to a

particular category was unlikely to be homogeneous (e.g. taking a given question,

scoring 1 may make a great contribution to approaching the respondent to love and

family categories, whereas scoring 6 may make a small contribution to approaching

him/her to recreational and functional categories). Following a real-time Delphi

methodology, the experts shifted the center of gravity of each 6-point scale by

assigning a bias ranging from 1 (score 1 has maximum influence and score 6 has no

influence) to 5 (score 1 has no influence and score 6 has maximum influence); bias 3

was assigned when responses were well-balanced and, therefore, all scores had the

same influence on each profile. The resulting bias was translated to a factor to be

applied to the score (Fig. 2).

The agreed questionnaire was introduced in Google form, and the weights and

biases were used to create the algorithm for calculating the final model

automatically from users’ responses. The questionnaire link was sent to all experts,

who tested the form during 3 weeks. During the last meeting, the overall

performance of the questionnaire was discussed and a few adjustments were made.

For the design of the final questionnaire, an introductory explanation was added, as

well as a statement regarding the anonymous nature of responses and compliance

with the local data protection law (LOPD 15/1999).

Results

In the first focus session, the experts provided 118 questions they considered

relevant for the definition of sexual profiles. After removing redundancy and ruling

out questions with little influence on the final profile, a list of 50 questions was

agreed on (supplementary Table 1). To facilitate administration of the question-

naire, items were grouped into four domains: childhood/education, sexuality,

personality, and sexual behavior. The experts agreed that the minimum information

needed to define sexual profiles could be summarized into 14 questions, which were

selected in a way that the four categories were well-balanced. However, the

remaining 36 items were kept in the final questionnaire despite being unnecessary

for the final score as they were considered potentially useful for future research as

well as for implementing further versions of the model. The resulting model was

named SEX360. Table 1 shows the 14 questions used to define sexual profiles,

along with the categories they are related to and the weight and bias assigned to

questions and responses, respectively.

Twelve of 14 questions were well-balanced in terms of the number of categories

favored by each extreme of the scale. Only questions 2 and 4 were non-symmetrical:

question 2 had 1 and 2 categories favored by lower and higher scores, respectively,

and question 4 had 0 and 2 categories favored by lower and higher scores,

respectively. Regarding the total number of categories involved in each question,

on a center of gravity for each question (orange triangle), which was then used to estimate the bias of
each response (table below). In the example shown in the figure, the experts assigned a center of gravity
of 2.5; according to the table, the bias assigned to scores (responses) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were 2.5, 2.3, 2.1,
1.9, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively

64% (9 questions) involved 2 categories, 29% (4 questions) involved 4 categories,

and 7% (1 question) involved 3 categories. The various categories were also fairly

balanced in the overall questionnaire: ‘‘family-oriented’’ was involved in 9

questions, ‘‘loving’’ was involved in 10 questions, ‘‘recreational’’ was involved in

8 questions, and ‘‘functional’’ was involved in 9 questions. The weights assigned to

each question ranged from 3.00 to 4.33, and the centers of gravity ranged from 1 to

4.

The scores of each question, computed according to the weight and bias

assigned, lead to a column chart which shows the level of influence of each

category on the user’s sexual profile. The level of influence of each category

ranges from 0–40. The result is presented along with a definition of each

category (Fig. 3).

Considering this was a first attempt at the assessment of sexual profiles, experts

agreed to add a sub-form to assess the perceived reliability of results. All questions

in this sub-form are rated on a 6-point Likert scale and ask about three items: (1) to

what extent the user understands the meaning of the four categories, (2) to what

extent the user thinks this model might explain sexual behavior—albeit in a very

succinct way, and (3) to what extent the user identifies with the result. Users are

invited to participate in this sub-form upon completion of the main questionnaire

and they are presented with the results, irrespective of their decision to respond to

the sub-form or not.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multidisciplinary conception of a

questionnaire for describing and classifying the various sexual profiles underlying

sexual behavior and attitudes. Since the works published by Masters and Johnson,

various authors have addressed the classification and description of sexual profiles.

In addition to a few studies on specific populations (Gwee et al. 2002; Williams and

Weinberg 2003; Namiki et al. 2011), Gilbert and Gamache provided a questionnaire

to assess sexual profiles in the overall population (Gilbert and Gamache 1984).

Their ‘‘Sexual Opinion Survey’’ was based on the axis erotophobia-erotophilia and

therefore contained questions regarding affinities towards different sexual practices.

However, in line with the approach proposed by Popovic (2006), we understand

psychosexual diversity as an evolving concept that may be influenced by many

factors, including social context, upbringing or educational experience, historical-

socio-cultural determinants, and the needs or concerns of the sexual partner. In this

regard, a panel of experts including not only sexologists but also experts in the fields

of urology, gynecology, psychology, anthropology, and sexology helped build a

questionnaire encompassing most of the influencing factors described by Popovic

et al.

The multidisciplinary nature of the panel of experts had the potential risk of

hampering the consensus process as each area of expertise was likely to have a

particular view of sexuality and even to use a slightly different language when

referring to sexual terms. For this reason, we thought the participation of an external

facilitator was a key condition for reaching a qualified consensus in a reasonable

time. The facilitator conducted the process by following two different approaches:

focus group sessions and a real-time Delphi method. The Delphi method is based on

the principle that collective decision-making in medicine and scientific research is

more accurate when the group of individuals is structured and coordinated (Rowe

and Wright 2001; Green et al. 2007). Unlike other forecasting methods, in which the

entire process is conducted openly, the Delphi method allows each expert to provide

a response anonymously. Participants can review their own conclusions at any

moment, which results in an evolving process continuously influenced by the

opinions of the other experts. In our experience, this dynamics resulted in an agreed

model which satisfied all experts, even after a few weeks testing the questionnaire

and independently exploring its strengths and limitations.

The sexual model proposed is based on two axes: traditional versus non-

traditional, and sexual benefit versus extra-sexual benefit. In addition to encom-

passing the various psycho-social and cultural determinants, these two axes were

intended to fit with the various types of rewards that may motivate sexual attitude.

Unlike other species, sexual activity in humans is not only driven by a reproductive

or loving reward, but also by a recreational reward or even the willingness to obtain

a benefit not related to sex, love or reproduction. In this regard, the sexual profiles

resulting from these two axes (i.e. family-oriented, loving, recreational, and

functional) encompass not only the cultural and educational perception of sex but

also the various types of sexual reward observed in humans.

Ourmodel is a preliminary attempt at the definition of sexual profiles. It is important

not to lose sight of the fact that the internal validity of the proposed model lies entirely

in the professional experience of the panel of experts.Moreover, although the SEX360

model aims to serve ultimately to describe sexual profiles worldwide, for this first

approach, all experts were based in the same country as we considered this might lead

to greater in-group consistency. Country-dependent cultural constraints shall be

addressed in future versions of the questionnaire. Another issue to be considered in the

future is the assessment of physical aspects of sexual health. Although the 50-item

questionnaire addresses the presence of sex-relatedmedical conditions such as erectile

dysfunction or loss of sexual desire, we decided not to include this aspect in the list of

items used to establish the sexual profile. The subjective perception of sex-related

conditions may be of interest for future investigations. However, the assessment of

these conditions was out of the scope of our questionnaire, and we deemed that the

inclusion of an incomplete assessment of sexual health problems might introduce a

biased input in the definition of the sexual profile. Taking advantage of the features of

Internet-based questionnaires, future editions of the SEX360 questionnaire might

include links to self-administered questionnaires to assess sex-related conditions at

user’s discretion. Of course, the advantages and disadvantages of this improvement

must be carefully weighed.

In summary, despite the significant limitations of our work, we believe that a

multidisciplinary approach to human sexual profiles was a necessary first step

towards the definition and understanding of various sexual attitudes. The potential

uses of this model involve both research and clinical practice. The environment of

research in sexual behavior might find in this model a suitable way to stratify study

samples by considering different profiles separately. Also, as the questionnaire was

designed to be administered anonymously through any online resource, it may

provide large datasets on population sexuality. From a clinical point of view, our

model might provide healthcare professionals (including, but not limited to,

urologists, sexologists, and psychologists) with an easy-to-use tool to target patients,

which may help professionals tailor their advice to each profile. Ultimately, we hope

that in the future, the widespread administration of this questionnaire may help both

healthcare professionals and patients understand sexuality better and normalize the

existence of a vast diversity of sexual behaviors. For this to be accomplished,

however, the SEX360 model needs to be reviewed by the scientific community and

validated by administration in a real-life setting.
