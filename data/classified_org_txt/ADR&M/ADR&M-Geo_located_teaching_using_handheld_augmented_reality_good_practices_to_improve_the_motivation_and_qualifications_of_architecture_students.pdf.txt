Abstract This work aims to evaluate the implementation

of an augmented reality tool in the framework of archi-

tecture and building engineering education. It is based on a

Geographical Positioning System to register virtual infor-

mation on real space. Layar platform, for mobile devices,

was used to visualize 3D models, which are linked to vir-

tual information channels through a database and geo-

located in their real position. The basis of this proposal is

students’ innate affinity with friendly digital devices such

as smart phones or tablets. Educational content visualiza-

tion in real environments was found to help students to

evaluate and share their own-generated architectural pro-

posals and improve their spatial skills. The suggested

method aims to improve access to 3D multimedia content

on mobile devices and adapt it to all types of users and

content. In addition, a usability analysis was carried out to

demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this tech-

nology in educational settings.

1 Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) technology consists of overlap-

ping virtual information in real space. A framework in

which this technology could potentially be put to interest-

ing use is the representation and management of the terri-

tory, because real scenes could be ‘‘completed’’ with

virtual information. This method would facilitate a greater

awareness and better understanding of the environment,

especially if used in the educational area. In the field of

architecture, for instance, AR makes possible the visuali-

zation of new building proposals and impact assessment on

their planned site. To do that, a Geographic Information

System (GIS) is needed to provide, manage, and filter

public queries with different levels of accuracy and up-

gradeable information. In short, it is necessary to link a 3D

model to a database that contains all the necessary infor-

mation associated to it. This process was the first aim of

this work [1].

The introduction of new learning methods using col-

laborative technologies, which help people involved in a

common task to achieve goals, offers new opportunities to

provide educational multimedia content. In the present

case, AR is used to enhance a shared physical workspace

and to create a common interface for three-dimensional

computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). Further-

more, new representation systems and management tools

are becoming better known and easier to use, though this

use does not involve a successful and correct implemen-

tation, suited to the educational needs of students.

The interest of educators in using new technologies in

the teaching process presupposes a greater engagement and

motivation on the part of students to understand content [2–

4], leading to improve academic results [5]. To achieve

these objectives, the methods proposed need to be designed

and evaluated by teachers and students almost simulta-

neously, since during their implementation they usually do

not take into account concepts such as ‘‘Design for All’’ or

‘‘Universal Access’’ that allow to adapt the content to a

broader range of environments and users. The evaluation of

a methodology focused on the training of architects and

planners is the second objective of this investigation.

This proposal involves methodological changes that

include information management through GIS, visualization

using AR to enhance face-to-face and remote collaboration,

and the interaction of many types of mobile devices, using

free applications that support all these features, in this case,

Layar� by SPRXmobile� (an application initially designed
for tourism information). This platform was used because of

its compatibility with all mobile operating systems and

because the registration of virtual information is based on the

use of Geographical Positioning System (GPS), which is

accurate enough for outdoor environments.

The teaching experiences needed to validate the previ-

ous premises occur in Master’s level subjects. They involve

the application of information technologies (IT) to the

analysis and territorial representation, where 3D GIS sys-

tems, 3D modeling, and urban virtual reality are combined.

The proposed approach is based on the use of smartphones

to incorporate virtual models generated by the students in

an existing AR platform to view them on-site, through their

own mobile devices.

The authors tried to promote new learning strategies for

sharing, collaborating and transmitting information to other

participants. In addition, this collaborative experience sought to

make students aware of the importance of user/citizen opinions

in the design phase of an architectural project. In this way,

promoting students’ participation could help achieve a wider

consensus regarding a more accessible and adapted design.

To address the process scientifically, a case focused on

large-scale urban projects was developed, in particular on

the Barcelona Knowledge Campus (BKC), a joint project

between the University of Barcelona (UB) and the Poly-

technic University of Catalonia (UPC).

Section 2 includes an overview of IT in education and AR

technology to view 3D models on-site. It also discusses the

use of mobile and geo-learning methods to promote universal

access and design for all. The methodology and main features

of the experience are described in Sect. 3. Section 4 includes

the research results, which are discussed in the final Sect. 5.

2 Background

2.1 IT in education

The incorporation of IT in today’s society has involved new

forms of interaction, from communication to entertainment.

However, carrying out new learning experiences using IT is

not an easy process, and one that is not always successful. In

fact, several previous studies have documented the problems

and failures in processes of IT implementation in education

[6–8]. For these reasons, it is easy to find a wide variety of

recent research focused on discovering and implementing

‘‘good teaching practices’’ [9, 10]. Under this category, one

may find complex and heterogeneous means (which in many

cases are not transferable from one domain to another) of

designing content, teaching methodologies, and efficient

uses of technological elements [11, 12], in order to achieve

successful experiences that improve the curriculum.

To incorporate an IT-based methodology into a specific

teaching environment, some recommendations must be

considered to avoid student rejection (so-called ‘‘good

educational practices’’ that are primarily focused on virtual

rooms, e-learning, and semipresent teaching [13, 14]).

From these features of specific practices, three points can

be extrapolated, as indicated by the following minor

objectives:

• Promotion of professor–student relationships, allowing
for a more effective feedback process

• Contribution to better task realization by heterogeneous
learning methods that meet high expectations

• Applying teaching/learning methods based on teaching
innovation and new IT technologies

The authors believe that these new concepts could help

to generate a new type of student, much more dynamic and

capable of participating more extensively in the educa-

tional process (one who could for example be called a ‘‘3.0

Student,’’ similar to the evolution of Web 2.0–3.0). At this

level, AR or Geo-location technologies, in conjunction

with the widespread popularity of mobile devices and their

recent advances, open new prospects in mobile learning

(ML), a specific field of e-learning (EL) [15].

Due to this approach, it is now possible to design

teaching activities in which a student’s comments about a

particular site are reflected in written form and automati-

cally shared online, becoming part of the new information

that other users and students can view and discuss. At this

moment, a 3.0 student is situated using the 3.0 Web, a new

interactive model of student and education that can gen-

erate extra motivation from the students because of the use

of their own devices in real environments [16].

2.2 3D virtual and geo-located visualization using AR

In architecture and building engineering education, the

visual component is one of the most relevant aspects for

students, as it is important for students to be able to

interpret information visually [5, 17]. Spatial information is

represented in a number of ways, ranging from traditional

methods that include printed plans and physical models to

modern methods that include digitally presented plans and

tridimensional models, which allow a greater level of detail

and the ability to navigate and actualize potential changes

instantaneously. These different visualization methods

allow both students and professionals to work collabora-

tively and communicate their ideas about the space and the

project more efficiently [18].

The emergence of web-based 3D globe viewers with

elevations, satellite and aerial images, maps and 3D fea-

tures, such as Google Earth� or Virtual Earth�, has pro-
moted the exchange and visualization of geo-referenced 3D

models in a natural way. Despite their shortcomings, these

visualization tools have achieved greater success than tra-

ditional 3D globe viewers based on VRML and X3D [19].

Moreover, the use of an AR urban planning system to

allow consultation through mobile devices, as intended in

the trial performed in the context of this work has been

reported recently [20, 21]. Other authors [22] investigated

the use of smartphones as a tool for public participation in

urban planning projects, but research addressing these

issues is still poorly documented.

Regarding the link between graphical information and its

databases updating ‘‘on-site,’’ several proposals related to

urban and architectural areas can be included, without delving

into their educational benefits [23–26]. Furthermore, other

proposals discussed the proper integration of spatial data from

different sources [27], and most are based on information

mapping and use conventional GIS [28]. However, none of

these address their use with AR techniques, i.e., superposing

the generated model on its planned real site. They are limited

to the generation of a virtual model from photographs or laser

scanner techniques in order to incorporate these images or

geo-referenced 3D models to an associated database.

Finally, it was possible to find a few examples of the use of

urban planning systems that use AR to allow consultation

through mobile devices, as intended in the exercise presented

[20, 22, 29, 30]. Most of these deal with the use of smart

phones as a tool for public participation in urban planning

projects, though not from an educational standpoint.

To conclude, it can be argued that there is a lack of

documented research in educational environments that

addresses the problem of urban design by using AR on

mobile devices to geo-reference, consult, and evaluate ‘‘on-

site’’ architectural proposals. The incorporation of this

aspect gives this research an innovative component.

2.3 Mobile and geo-learning methods in user

engagement to improve design for all and universal

access

Currently, one of the most important aspects when con-

ducting any type of project is to make it usable, accessible,

and understandable by the greatest possible number of

users. In the area of architectural education, this effort

should be twofold: on one side, the training method should

satisfy these parameters [31], and on the other, students

should be aware of them and make universally accessible

designs.

Moreover, online education methods have undergone a

radical change in the last two decades. They have evolved

from closed systems, where the student could only down-

load static content, to new methods that advocate interac-

tion not only between students but also between students

and faculty members as well as other users. For these

reasons, teachers need to be aware of the students’

changing needs.

In order to generate useful recommendations in the

Universal Design for Learning (UDL), various projects and

discussion forums can be found that have defined the types

of educational projects, users, and needs they may have for

new teaching methods [32, 33]. According to the following

three UDL principles, each area of the curriculum, educa-

tional project, or real project should provide multiple,

varied, and flexible options for representation, expression,

and engagement:

• Provide multiple means of representation
• Provide multiple means of action and expression
• Provide multiple means of engagement.

The experience described in this paper is intended to

achieve these goals and create an experience that fits the

general parameters of Universal Access [34]: new methods

of representation that can more clearly express architec-

tural designs through a more motivating strategy (mobile

devices were used because they are usually easily acces-

sible to students, teachers and to the general user)’ as well

as to clarify the context awareness and content adaptation.

In this paper, the context is referred to as contextual

information that students can use to evaluate an architec-

tural project using geo-information.

In order to create a useful system adaptable to most

users, with or without experience, it is necessary to eval-

uate the interaction in this new type of mobile learning

[35]. For this reason, system usability (AR technology and

course opinion) was evaluated. Quality usability indicators

were created to control the relationship between the stu-

dent’s learning process and other variables related to the

usability of the designed method. Such assessments are not

strictly necessary; however, as shown in previous studies

[36], they allow to identify both the motivation of the

student with the selected technologies and the role of

mobile technologies in higher education and professional

industry.

Previous studies have discussed the use of 3D visuali-

zation in general [37], and specifically AR, for the

visualization of architectural designs. This technology

helps to adapt them to the environment, avoiding problems

of scaling, lighting, and texturing [38–40]. In addition,

through these technologies, any user, even outside of the

professional sector, can obtain more enjoyable access to

virtual information [41].

3 Background

3.1 Teaching context

The experiment was carried out with students of Archi-

tecture and Planning, during the academic year 2011–2012,

in an elective course called ‘‘ICT applied to Spatial Ana-

lysis,’’ which is taught in the Research Master in Land

Management and Valuation at UPC, Barcelona-Tech. As

mentioned, the researchers worked at BKC (Barcelona

Knowledge Campus, see Fig. 1), a project sponsored by the

University of Barcelona (UB) and the Polytechnic Uni-

versity of Catalonia (UPC). The project involves academic,

research, business, and social entities to provide a frame-

work for strategic collaboration, in order to become a

scientific and technological environment of reference in

Europe.

Today, the campus includes 227 Ha. Floor area is more

than 515,000 sq., and the campus hosts 16 schools,

including faculties and colleges, 90 university departments,

more than 15 libraries, 2 science and technology parks, and

various specialized support centers and management units

(Fig. 2). The urban proposal aims to improve the rela-

tionship between the campus and the city. It tries to create

learning, cultural, social and sporting environments that

can improve mobility between the existing parts of the

campus.

The total duration of the course was 60 h. Currently, this

method is being replicated in the 2012–2013 Master’s

course in Processes and Graphical Expression in Archi-

tectural Urban Projection, in the Center of Arts, Architec-

ture and Design (CUAAD, Universidad de Guadalajara,

Mexico.

3.2 Procedure and geo-location configuration

The first step of the process is based on documents and

‘‘planimetric’’ images provided by the project’s managers.

Each student had to have a mobile device equipped with a

camera, GPS and 3G connection, and was required to

download the free browser Layar Viewer�. To visualize
the final models, a Geo-location-based AR application that

uses GPS, compass, and other sensors in the student’s

mobile phone was used to provide a ‘‘heads-up’’ display of

various geo-located points-of-interest (POI’s). In the pres-

ent case, these were students’ architectural proposals situ-

ated on the campus.

Students worked with free solutions of SketchUp� and
3dsMax� to create volumetric models and texture designs,
using real building materials. They were divided into three

different groups, A, B, and C: A for existing buildings, and

B and C for new projects named B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and

C3 (Fig. 1).

Each B and C group modeled three proposals with the

information provided, exported in *.Obj format (standard

format used by AR applications to view 3D models) into

the LayerModelConverter� (LMC), which generates a
specific file compatible with Layar Viewer. In addition,

UTM coordinates should be recorded to be associated with

the model in the database. In order to avoid problems, at

this point, students should control the export path, check

the units, activate the texture maps, and change all YZ

coordinates. As a result reference, UTM coordinates and an

angle (for example, in the proposed new student dormitory:

41.388010, 2.114627, a = 40) are received. These data
were introduced into the database joined to the file in *.

L3D format.

Previously, an information channel was generated by

teachers, as developers, in the Layar public platform. The

channel was published using BKC basic information and

was configured to allow the use of filters. Comprehensive

filters settings helped users to find POIs that were easy and

interesting, and to separate proposals by groups (A, B, C).

The database and PHP file were hosted in a public server

with PHP, MySQL, Java, and support.

As a final step, the students installed the Layar� RA
browser on their mobile devices. Once installed, they were

required to find the particular channel created, which was

located within the category of ‘‘geo-layers of architecture

and buildings’’.Fig. 1 BKC. Coding and location of the projects studied

Once channel content was downloaded, and every

group of students evaluated the models of the other groups

‘‘on-site’’. The queries were sent to the server host, which

returned the selected POI. They are shown in the screen

superimposed on the real image captured by the camera.

As one approaches or focuses on the virtual model, a label

at the bottom of the screen appears with the model ref-

erence information and distance from the user. By click-

ing this label, students can access the ‘‘iweb’’

questionnaire where they can respond and make com-

ments about the appearance, impact and the scale of the

building (Fig. 3).

3.3 Usability parameters definition

Usability is related to the development of interactions with

products that are easy to learn, effective, and user friendly.

Additionally, usability addresses the subjective perception

of whether a system is able to meet all the needs and

requirements of users, customers, or managers.

As mentioned, in order to demonstrate the feasibility

and effectiveness of this technology in educational settings,

on-site questionnaires were designed based on ISO

9241-11, which provides usability guidelines as follows:

effectiveness, defined as the user’s ability to complete tasks

during the course, in relation to ‘‘accuracy and integrity’’;

efficiency of the assigned resources in respect of the

expenditure of time and effort for solving the proposed

exercise; and satisfaction, understood as the subjective

reactions of users regarding the course.

3.4 Test design

During the ‘‘on-site’’ evaluation process, questionnaires

associated with own-generated student’s geo-referenced

3D models were designed. They were only available when

users were close to those virtual models. The basic

objective of the questionnaire focused on assessing the

degree of adaptation of geo-referenced models in their

Fig. 4 Model visualization ‘‘on-site’’ and related questionnaire

planned locations, the quality of the models, and items

generated by working groups. Furthermore, questions were

asked to obtain the students’ technological profile and

degree of satisfaction (the full sample test can be seen in

[42]). Two different questionnaires were designed. In the

first, students were asked about the use of AR technology

and system usability assessment in the case of existing

buildings, according to a standardized methodology for

these experiments.

In the second, students evaluated and reviewed all

information linked to new buildings (Fig. 1), as project

plans, memory, or project rendered views, which provided

additional insights. In addition, students were required to

choose the best viewpoint from which to appreciate the

integration of the new project with the existing building

(Fig. 4).

In both cases, personal responses were sent directly to

the teacher who received and analyzed the information.

3.5 Model generation of the case of study

As already mentioned, one of the objectives of this type of

experience is to familiarize students with the use of new

tools for architectural representation using their environ-

ment and known nearby devices.

With previous knowledge of CAD/BIM (Computer

Assisted Design/Building Information Modeling) and

thanks to the information provided on the site (planning

regulations, etc.), students were expected to be able to

complete the steps described in Sect. 3.2. Lighting simu-

lation, mapping, and texturing techniques were used to give

3D models a realistic look. Once the models were exported

to *.obj format, position information in real coordinates

(Fig. 5) through the LayarModelConverter (LMC) appli-

cation was to be obtained.

4 Results

The course was completed (100 % of proposed tasks) by a

total of 11 students. In total, six campus buildings were

modeled (see Fig. 6).

As expected, students were able to follow all steps

described in the previous sections to visualize their pro-

posals on the intended location using their devices. While

model registration using GPS was inaccurate, as expected,

the use of semitransparent texture mapping, and model

visualization at a distance, allowed for a scene generation

accurate enough to represent the proposals and allow their

urban impact evaluation ‘‘on-site.’’

4.1 Main results of the BKC study case

The average scores of the responses, related to the main

usability guidelines (effectiveness, efficiency and satisfac-

tion), were very similar, ranging from 3.31 to 3.46 out of 5

(Fig. 7).

The overall assessment was rated at 4.27 points out of 5,

which confirms the feasibility of using this technology in

educational environments. Effectiveness average was 3.27

out of 5, and Efficiency and Satisfaction were 3.44 and 3.75

respectively.

However, independently, the response interpretation is

complex. To provide a clearer interpretation and allow the

information to be presented in a brief and concise manner,

there is a need to group these responses. Consequently, it is

necessary to construct composite indicators, which in the

present case were: knowledge level, previous training,

effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

These indicators do not provide a full explanation of the

latent variable (usability), but allow to obtain ‘‘quality’’

indicators from each student. They cannot be measured in

units, but allow comparisons between students of different

courses and to form correlations with other indicators, such

as academic performance. In addition, they represent a

useful approach to usability study and help draw conclu-

sions objectively.

For this Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through

SPSS, V11 software was used. Once major components and

contribution rates were estimated, each of the students was

assessed according to an index derived from a general

expression that weights the scores for each principal com-

ponent to the square root of the variance [43] as follows

(expression to construct usability’s compound indicators):

p
is the square root of the ‘‘eigenvalue’’ for

that component, ensuring that the components with higher

explained variance have a greater weight in the index

construction.

Table 1 shows the results obtained from five students,

comparing questionnaire response averages with the

usability index and each component.

Table 1 shows that Student 2 obtained the highest

usability and highest average scores in his responses. Stu-

dent 5, in contrast, had the worst average scores in his

responses and thus the worst usability index. Hence, it

appears that there is a direct relationship between the

‘‘response’’ means and the ‘‘usability index’’ assigned to

each student. These findings confirm the consistency of the

indicator construction.

Finally, to identify the most significant variables related

to the overall course opinion, the students’ final assessment

was correlated with main variables (Table 2).

High correlations were detected correlating the repre-

sentativeness of the exercise (W_exercises = 0.92) and

material presentation (W_material = 0.80). These vari-

ables appear crucial to the success of this type of teaching

assessment. However, variables related to being able to

solve the exercises independently (W_learn_indep = 0.34)

or previous knowledge of AR technology

(AR_App = -0.11) did not correlate significantly with the

students’ global opinion of the course.

5 Results

As can be seen, the variable prior knowledge of augmented

reality applications (Ar_app) and the variable indicating

the fact of being able to learn these contents without tea-

cher (W_learn_indep) are not correlated at all (0.34), or

even in a slightly negative way (-0,11), with the students’

final assessment of the course. There is also a slight posi-

tive correlation (0.24) in the variable concerning the

number of exercises in relation to the hours of dedication

(W_num_exercises). It is evident that an overload of work

affects the students’ opinion of the course negatively. The

low correlation, however, indicates that this fact is not

greatly relevant.

Significant correlations were detected (close to 0.70)

with the variables that address the purpose, material,

content and software used. These four variables appear to

affect the opinion of enrolled students similarly. Finally,

the highest correlation (0.92) is for the question of the

representativeness of the proposed exercise (W_exercises).

It seems that the choice of exercise, and its suitability in

relation to the content taught, greatly influences the stu-

dents’ global opinion.

Related to usability indicator construction, there is a

direct relationship between the ‘‘response’’ means and the

usability index assigned to each student. However, the

methodology used ensures that the components with higher

explained variance have a greater weight in the index

construction, so it can be used to correlate with other

indicators, such as academic performance. In addition, the

consistency of the indicator construction represents a use-

ful approach to study usability and helps draw conclusions

objectively.

6 Conclusions

In relation to the technology used, responses confirm that

performance improvement of mobile (handheld) devices

has made them useful tools for using AR technology in the

field of architecture and building. The features of these

devices have traditionally been inadequate in this area,

where greater computational capabilities are needed

(complex and accurate models rendering, or several options

and scenes simultaneous analysis). Students felt that this

technology could be useful for both their training and their

future as professionals.

In relation to usability, results obtained from effective-

ness, efficiency, and satisfaction indicators show that the

low degree of immersion provided by these devices

(monitor–based), as well as limited interaction with the

small size of their screens, seems to be enough to guarantee

the feasibility of these kinds of experiences.

Furthermore, the methodology used, based on a low-cost

system that performs a study case, can be extrapolated to

other research areas. However, in order to provide uni-

versal access to these new technologies in educational

environments, a usability analysis should always be

incorporated. It would help to ensure acceptable levels of

availability, affordability, and satisfaction of the technol-

ogy used. In addition, some points should be considered:

• Most of the students do not have previous knowledge of
software used—in this case, GIS systems, modeling

programs, and CAD applications. They should learn it

during the course, and most of the time they do not feel

able to learn the content autonomously (without an

instructor). These constrains, however, do not clearly

correlate with the final assessment of the course.

• Exercise representativeness is crucial for the success of
this type of experience. This key variable obtained the

best score and had the highest correlation with the

positive assessment of the course.

• Credible integration of the model in the scene (through
immersion light and the use of occluded techniques) is

the best qualified variable, so it should be considered

essential in later AR courses.

Finally, some difficulty in learning and an excessive

number of exercises in relation to scheduled work hours

was found. This fact does not preclude the overall positive

evaluation of the experience, though it must be taken into

account to ensure a successful experience. For future work,

correlations between usability indicators and students’

academic performance must be carried out.
