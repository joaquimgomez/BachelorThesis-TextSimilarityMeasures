Abstract A mixed-methods study evaluating the moti-

vation and satisfaction of Architecture degree students

using interactive visualization methods is presented in this

paper. New technology implementations in the teaching

field have been largely extended to all types of levels and

educational frameworks. However, these innovations

require approval validation and evaluation by the final

users, the students. In this paper, the advantages and dis-

advantages of applying mixed evaluation technology are

discussed in a case study of the use of interactive and

collaborative tools for the visualization of 3D architec-

tonical models. The main objective was to evaluate

Architecture and Building Science students’ the motivation

to use and satisfaction with this type of technology and to

obtain adequate feedback that allows for the optimization

of this type of experiment in future iterations.

Augmented reality � Teaching innovation � Motivation �
Satisfaction

1 Introduction

The current paper is based on three main pillars. The first

pillar focuses on teaching innovations within the university

framework that cultivate higher motivation and satisfaction

in students. The second pillar concerns how to implement

such an innovation; the paper proposes the utilization of

determinate tools of the so-called information technologies

(IT), so that students, as ‘‘digital natives’’, will be more

comfortable in the learning experience [1]. Finally, the

study employs a mixed analysis method to concretely

obtain the most relevant aspects of the experience that

should be improved both in future interactions and in any

new technological implementations within a teaching

framework [2].

While the three pillars mentioned above are not inno-

vations themselves, their integration into an experiment

gives them a clearly innovative character, and there are few

similar examples today [3, 4]. In addition, the design of the

study focuses on the university level, specifically Archi-

tecture studies and the complementary areas of Building

Engineering (the name of the degree is currently under

revision, as Sciences and Building Technologies is the

degree accepted at the governmental level) and Design,

where spatial comprehension is very important and IT

(information technologies) elements are very helpful. Thus,

this work is both novel and justified.

Today, the incorporation of technology into classrooms

is a fact [5], though one cannot affirm that using technol-

ogy will lead to an increase in the motivation, satisfaction,

or academic achievement of students [6]. As will be shown

in Sect. 3, technology must be incorporated into teaching in

a controlled manner; there are some risks that need to be

controlled before one can improve not only the curriculum

but also student skills and knowledge. Academic fields are

reticent about incorporating technologies associated with

leisure (such as mobile devices). With technology, the

professor must be trained and capable of providing full-

time support to students: He or she must be capable of

offering a good and precise explanation of the practice and

methodology, must correctly select the applications, and

must provide clear final objectives. Previous studies

describe ‘‘critical mistakes’’ in the implementation of

educational technology—mistakes that can generate nega-

tive perceptions among the students and which need to be

avoided [7–10].

The need of and justification for incorporating IT into

the educational process are particularly relevant, and they

are described in the main roles of the European Higher

Education Area (EHEA), which runs the university studies

of member countries, including Spain, where this project

was undertaken [11].

It is common to find studies focused on all teaching

types and levels that evaluate the incorporation of tech-

nology and technological elements into teaching; the most

common examples are the use of computers in the class-

room and the use of digital content for online training [12,

13]. Usually, teachers design educational experiments

based on the technology that is available at their college or

that is accessible to their students, assuming (based on their

experience) that the use of new IT will be possible and

beneficial to students.

However, it must be emphasized that the above-men-

tioned quantitative studies have small sample sizes (quan-

titative studies are focused on defined variables, which are

better described with a large sample and a large number of

respondents), and they lack clear questions to identify the

degree of information that two or more variables could

provide (descriptive, predictive, or casual questions that

differentiates research problems.). These studies are typical

examples of studies that generate incomplete data [14, 15],

lack detail, and are missing variables because of the initial

design flaws.

This lack of accuracy is due to the teachers’ inadequate

preselection of questions; these questions focus on evalu-

ating objectives, without taking into account previous sta-

tistical assumptions, sample size, inappropriate treatment of

the data, and the possible types of errors that could modify

or influence the students’ answers [16]. The possibility of

biased results provides a starting point, previously used in

related academic fields [17], allowing to approach the

experiment with a mixed methodology and benefit from

different data analysis methods. Using complementary

qualitative research, it is possible to obtain new variables to

study in future iterations and more detail for the quantitative

data. Meanwhile, thanks to the quantitative data, it is pos-

sible to minimize the primary problems of the qualitative

research: subjectivity and no generalization [18].

Another factor that has limited studies in some teaching

areas is tradition, while in fields such as medicine, eth-

nography, sociology, and economics, it would not be cor-

rect to present data without properly defining the sample.

In other educational frameworks (such as law, engineering,

or artistic education, which includes architecture), studies

relying on user feedback are less common, either because

of the study methodology, the assumption that user feed-

back is of little utility, or the lack of time for collecting

such information.

For all these reasons, and because Spanish universities

are currently facing a deep social crisis in which the

number of university students in Spain and in other coun-

tries where higher education is costly is in decline, it is

necessary to motivate students more. The goal is to opti-

mize students’ understanding of academic subjects and the

way in which they are taught. The use of ‘‘friendly tech-

nology’’ that is successfully adapted to the specific needs of

each subject must help students better adapt to education at

the university level and to the new sociocultural context in

which IT has a massive presence.

In this paper, a mixed-methods study evaluating the

motivation, satisfaction, and academic performance of

degree students is presented. The methodology is both

quantitative (through a structured test) and qualitative

(using the bipolar laddering (BLA) [19]), and it is based on

the use of augmented reality (AR) to present, visualize, and

discuss an architecture project realized using CAD tools

(computer-assisted design). Whether this type of exercise

can help students understand and improve their 3D skills

will be evaluated. As a starting point, students will work on

their assignment and compare two ways of doing so: the

traditional system that uses printed plans and conceptual

mock-ups and the method of using 3D interactive model

visualizations on mobile devices with different generation

techniques.

The working hypothesis to be confirmed is whether

students who invest less time in the assignment will obtain

better academic results because they are more motivated

and satisfied than they are under the classic working sys-

tem, taking into consideration that today, the architectonic

teaching field is based almost 100 % on digital drawings

and photomontages of 2D and 3D images. The secondary

objective was to ascertain through a mixed-methods ana-

lysis of quantitative and qualitative data the most positive

and negative aspects of the experience, with the aim of

adapting the implementation method in future iterations

and for other subjects.

Section 3 of this paper includes an overview of aca-

demic performance using AR and discusses how this type

of technology can improve students’ 3D spatial skills. The

main features of quantitative, qualitative, mixed research,

and the user experience (UX) concepts applied in the

educational framework are described in Sect. 4. In addition,

the study methodology is described. Section 5 includes the

research results, which are discussed in Sect. 6.

2 Mobile technology, education, and their relationship

with universal access and design for all

Simplifying the description of our society, one would affirm

that there are two primary frameworks: real and virtual. In

the real field, the architect is the principal character who

models human spaces together with several others profes-

sionals: civil engineers, factory designers, plant engineers,

structural engineers, etc. In recent years, the designs and

projects in the field of architecture have reflected an evolu-

tion towardmore sustainable construction adapted for people

and their environments. This shift has increased the pre-

liminary studies of the characteristics and requirements of

sustainable architecture projects and designs. For these rea-

sons, all studies are usually conducted in two parts: the

project itself (infrastructure, security, etc.) and the user

(typology, access, special needs for disabilities, etc.).

In the virtual framework, uncounted resources have been

dedicated over the last several decades to improve and

generate new models and methods for accessing content

(rules and recommendations), thereby adapting those con-

tents to all types of users and devices [20]. These efforts

are dynamic and constantly changing, especially consid-

ering the constant technological revolution that continu-

ously transforms these devices and their capabilities.

Substantial effort is being made to adapt the content on

mobile devices because their popularization and the pro-

gressive lowering of their cost have given them a signifi-

cant presence in society. In particular, aspects such as

security [21], and adaptation and communication with

users of advanced age [22], or with disabilities [23], are

perhaps the most developed work within Design or Mul-

timedia studies. These aspects are the main disciplines in

the effort to generate applications that are accessible to all

types of users, with customizable and usable interaction

adapted to the basic navigation rules [20].

In the architectural context, the core of the work pre-

sented here, many efforts are made to improve the methods

for visualizing, exposing, and discussing architectural

projects, especially in 3D [24]. The classic methods based

on printed plans and physical models are expensive and

poorly adapted to changes in the characteristics of users.

For instance, performing a plane requires suitable space

and expensive equipment, in the same way that a physical

model requires materials and a slow production system,

making this method expensive and generally not suitable

for people with disabilities. A printed plan that requires

different system units or any other modification generates a

slow workflow and creates clear difficulties when adapting

to a fast-changing society.

For the previously mentioned reasons, digital workflows

have improved the described problems, and university

students (digital natives) are often able to achieve better

methods than many experienced professionals who are

unable to use the new technologies. The visualization and

discussion of an architectural project in 3D using mobile

devices generate a faster workflow, allow students to adapt

their design to the real scale of construction, and allow

them to easily modify and customize the project for little or

no cost.

Previous studies have discussed the use of 3D visuali-

zation in general [25], and specifically AR, for the visu-

alization of architectural design to adapt designs to the

environment, avoiding problems of scaling, lighting, and

texturing [26–29]. In addition, through these technologies,

a user outside of the professional sector can obtain more

enjoyable access to all types of information, such as tourist

applications [30].

Complementing the current developments, and espe-

cially useful in the field of accessibility and Design for All,

are geo-referenced applications. These applications utilize

the user’s position, obtained through their personal mobile

device, to provide extended information that is customized

for all services [23]. In the design of any project, the

architect must be aware of its accessibility once built. The

project should be accessible and adaptable for the users in

their digital formats, enabling any user interaction [31].

Using the geo-referenced capability of these devices, sys-

tems with audio description and AR, all types of users

(experts/non-experts, with/without disabilities, local, and

foreigner) could feasibly to obtain extended information

from any architectural project, both at the user level (author,

year, main topics, etc.) and an advanced level (materials,

type of construction, layers, electrical installations, etc.).

To conclude this section, it is reaffirmed that the ideo-

logical basis of the project is to evaluate how the student

adapts to the use and design of the various visualization

methods that are accessible to any user: in person using 2D

printed layouts, virtually by posting interactive models on

the Internet, or, finally, using AR visualization for a

combined interaction. To the students from the first course,

the importance of generating universally accessible content

is introduced, allowing them to train their skills so that in

the future, they can create more accessible designs for all

types of users and environments.

3 IT in education. 3D models and AR visualization

The incorporation of IT in today’s society has shaped new

forms of interaction at all levels, from communication to

entertainment to training. However, carrying out new

learning experiences using IT is not an easy process that is

always successful. In fact, it is easy to find previous studies

that have documented the problems and failures in pro-

cesses of implementing IT in education [32–34].

The main problems in executing IT in education

(usually using computers in the classroom or using online

content) include the lack of computers, poor connectivity,

long training periods and hefty investments required by

certain tools, the belief that IT is just for leisure and

entertainment, and the lack of support from both the

institution and the government [33, 35, 36]. For these

reasons, it is easy to find all kinds of recent research

focused on discovering and implementing ‘‘good teaching

practices’’ [37, 38]. Under this nomenclature, complex

and heterogeneous ways can be found (which in many

cases are not reusable from one domain to another) of

designing content, teaching methodologies, and efficient

uses of technological elements [39, 40], in order to ensure

successful experiences (that generate improved curricula)

that motivate and satisfy students.

In the following, some of the main models and meth-

odologies that define ‘‘good teaching practices’’ in using

technology will be reviewed so that the proposed method

can be adapted to these recommendations.

3.1 Good education practices in using IT

IT is a set of tools and applications that allow the incor-

poration and strengthening of new educational strategies,

many of which have been defined in new teaching frame-

works during the last two decades [5, 41]. The interest,

need, and urgency to implement new technologies in

education and in universities in particular are relatively

new [39].

However, technological innovation, which is intended to

improve the student learning process (with studies that link

the use of IT with improved academic performance [36]),

must be capable of providing support to address difficulties

for students while using and interacting with technological

elements.

To incorporate an IT-based methodology into a specific

teaching environment, some recommendations for avoiding

student rejection must be considered (so-called good edu-

cational practices that are primarily focused on virtual

rooms, e-learning, and semi-present teaching [42, 43]).

From the specific characteristics that shape these practices,

four points can be extrapolated, as indicated by the fol-

lowing principal objectives:

• Promotion of professor–student relationships, allowing
for a more effective feedback process

• Dynamic development among students, which is made
possible by collaborative techniques

• Contribution to better task realization by heterogeneous
learning methods, meeting high expectations

• Applying teaching/learning methods based on teaching
innovation and new IT technologies.

These new concepts generate a new type of student, who

is much more dynamic and capable of having a more

participatory role in the educational process (who could be

called a ‘‘3.0 Student,’’ similar to the evolution of Web 2.0

to 3.0). In accordance with Massy and Zemsky [44], any

methodology that promotes the inclusion of IT in teaching

must have the following objectives:

• Personal production help: applications that allow both
the professors and students to carry out tasks faster and

more efficiently (e.g., calculation sheets or text proces-

sers, draw programs);

• Content improvement: the use of tools that allow for the
notification and modification of content rapidly and

efficiently (e.g., e-mail, digital content, video, multi-

media resources) without changing the basic teaching

method;

• Paradigm change: At this level, the teacher reconfigures
the teaching activity and learning activities to utilize

the new incorporated technologies.

Examples of educational methodologies that have

implemented the first two objectives are common, though it

is difficult to find examples that incorporate the third

objective and the practices where the third objective is

implemented. Most of the solutions involve basic tools and

derive applications of an Internet connection [45].

The technological pedagogical content knowledge

model (TPACK [46]) is probably already used by many

teachers unconsciously. TPACK (which extends Shulman’s

idea of pedagogical content knowledge [47]) describes how

an activity that requires technology must be integrated

adequately into the classroom by connecting three knowl-

edge fields: curricular, pedagogical, and technological (see

Fig. 1):

The model is based on a current teaching context

characterized by a high degree of complexity and great

dynamism, making necessary the integration of multiple

knowledge components [48]:

• The curriculum, which can be understood as the theme
or content selected for technological implementation,

including the objectives to be achieved and the possible

necessity of prior knowledge;

• The pedagogy, which includes the activities and their
delivery, the teacher’s and students’ roles, and the

evaluation system;

123

• The technical component, including the training nec-
essary for using the technological resources, the

selection criteria for the technological devices, and

the proposed uses for the technology.

If in the process of designing an educational experience,

appropriate individual aspects of the main areas are

included, one may be closer to redefining and integrating

any type of technology into teaching activities, moving

away from classic approaches that have been used in cur-

rent and past technology integration efforts [49]:

• Software-focused initiatives
• Demonstrations of sample resources, lessons, and

projects

• Technology-based educational reform efforts
• Structured/standardized professional development

workshops or courses

• Technology-focused teacher education courses

These approaches tend to initiate and organize their

efforts according to the educational technologies being

used (and preferred by the teacher or the institution) rather

than the students’ learning needs, which is exactly the

opposite of the desired approach in which the user is a

central element of the experience, due to the user’s tech-

nological profile, motivation for experiencing new peda-

gogical methods, and evaluation of both the quantitative

and qualitative aspects of the experience. This approach

provides primordial data about new models of technolog-

ical implementation in the teaching field.

3.2 3D virtual visualization using AR

In architecture and building education, the visual compo-

nent is one of the most relevant aspects for students; hence,

it is important for students to be able to interpret infor-

mation visually [41, 50]. Spatial information is represented

in a number of ways, ranging from traditional methods that

include printed plans and physical models to modern

methods that include digital printed plans and tridimen-

sional models, which allow a greater level of detail and the

ability to navigate and actualize potential changes instan-

taneously. These different visualization methods allow

both students and professionals to work collaboratively and

communicate their ideas about the space and the project

more efficiently [51].

Both CAD and BIM (building information modeling)

have positioned the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and

Construction) sector as one of the main consumers of 3D

technology for the management, design, and display of any

item related to the architectural project. However, these

technologies have not been extended to other devices,

particularly in the case of mobile technologies. For

example, companies such as Autodesk
�
(San Rafael, CA,

USA), one of the largest software manufacturers for

architecture, already had solutions for both 2D and 3D

visualizations in mobile environments in the mid-1990s

(OnSite
�
); however, the lack of appropriate devices and

connections considerably impeded the use of these tech-

nologies. The excessive size of files along with the lack of

affordable, high-performing mobile devices kept the

ubiquitous CAD/BIM models far from classrooms and

even from some professional sectors.

In the last decade, with the emergence of smartphones

and tablets with the latest generation of processors, the

reduced cost of devices and services, the increase in con-

nection speeds, and, in particular, the popularization of Wi-

Fi networks, there has been a real possibility of providing

quality anywhere. It is during this period that concepts such

as QR-Code (Quick Response Code, created by the Japa-

nese company Denso Wave, in 1994) and AR, both of

which involve the use of a camera as well as an informatics

processor, were popularized, while the first references to

this kind of technology date from much earlier (the term

‘‘augmented reality’’ has been attributed to Tom Caudell, a

former Boeing researcher in 1990, but the most clear and

formal work is found in [52]).

Currently, in Spain, 43 % of users that connect to the

Internet do so from a smartphone (210 % more than in

2011). Spain is the European country with the highest

usage of this type of mobile phones (63.2 % of mobile

phone users have smartphones; the United Kingdom is

second with 62.3 % of users; and France third with 51.4 %)

[53]. The navigation functions that smartphones offer, as

well as their high performance in visual content exchange

between users, have positioned them as indispensable

devices both professionally and socially, especially among

young people and pre-college and university students (as

the current study’s data will show almost 100 % of users in

classrooms classroom have smartphones, opening the

possibility of implementing educational experiences on

these device, as the proposed one in this paper).

However, as is typical with almost all technologies,

adapting content tends to affect interaction and usability on

the one hand and appreciation of the utility of the tech-

nology on the other, which can in turn lead to loss of

motivation and satisfaction with the experience. The ele-

vated number of applications and formats makes it difficult

to work with a single line of products or manufacturers [54]

and renders it necessary to exchange files between different

lines of products and formats. Using different applications

directly impacts the methodological design of any educa-

tional experiment, because it is necessary to plan for more

time in order to explain the applications, reducing time for

other topics directly related to the predefined agenda.

For example, currently in Spain, Autodesk
�
applications

such as AutoCAD
�
, 3DS

�
, and Revit Architecture

�
are the

CAD/BIM products most frequently used by both profes-

sional architects and architecture students. For RA, Jua-

nio
�
, Layar

�
, and Augment

�
, compatible with iOS and

Android, are probably the most-used free applications. A

problem arises when one needs to convert CAD/BIM

models to the RA display system because the formats are

not compatible; new intermediate applications such as

Google Sketchup� (paid versions) allow the generation of
compatible models between all of the working solutions.

Previous studies that evaluated the use of IT in teaching

activities related to architecture/construction was focused

on the use of whiteboards, interactive books, social media,

and other resources related to the visualization of 3D

models, buildings, and spaces in architecture education [55,

56]. More recently, immersive technologies have been used

in virtual and AR worlds, and their usefulness has been

assessed by a number of international projects [57–60].

These experiences demonstrated the vast potential of this

technology; however, in education, AR might be considered

a new tool, and further studies are necessary, with particular

focus on the user experience and learning process [41].

4 Mixed-methods research and UX in an educational

framework

4.1 Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods

Quantitative and qualitative approaches have historically

been the main methods of scientific research. Currently, a

hybrid approach to experimental methodology has emerged

that takes a more holistic view of methodological prob-

lems: the mixed-methods research approach. This model is

based on a pragmatic paradigm that contemplates the

possibility of combining quantitative and qualitative

methods to achieve complementary results. The value of

research lays not so much in the epistemology of the

method but in its effectiveness [61].

On the one hand, quantitative research focuses on ana-

lyzing the degree of association between quantified vari-

ables, as promulgated by logical positivism; therefore, this

method requires induction to understand the results of the

investigation. Because this paradigm considers that phe-

nomena can be reduced to empirical indicators that repre-

sent reality, quantitative methods are considered objective

[62, 63].

On the other hand, qualitative research focuses on

detecting and processing intentions. Unlike quantitative

methods, qualitative methods require deduction to interpret

results. The qualitative approach is subjective, as it is

assumed that reality is multifaceted and not reducible to a

universal indicator [64].

Qualitative methods have been traditionally linked to

the social sciences because of their association with human

factors, although the mixed approach proposes integration

of quantitative and qualitative approaches with the goal of

facilitating the interpretation of experimental results. This

combination of quantitative and qualitative experimental

designs leads to a wider variety of results when dealing

with human factors that include both numerical results and

the basis for these results. The possibility to work with both

types of information simultaneously in a single study is a

great advantage to a research team: Multidimensional

outcomes make it much easier to propose solutions and

further research steps in a given field of study.

4.2 UX techniques for pedagogical purposes

User research techniques have been historically related to

the HCI field. The user approach in this discipline is mainly

focused on the study of behavioral goals in work settings.

In consequence, the task became the pivotal point of user-

centered analysis and evaluation techniques (e.g., usability

testing [65]). Facing the mechanical vision of HCI user’s

research, Don Norman [66] popularized the term User

Experience to include the feelings and meaningful aspects

of user interaction with machines and services. Since then,

many studies have enriched this trend working on concepts

and new branches of User Experience as design and

emotion, [67], ‘‘Funology’’ [68], ‘‘Hedonomics’’ [69], or

most recently ‘‘Gamification’’ [70].

The current methods in UX do not necessarily include

the end user to participate in the creative process of the

product. Most of them are guides of imagination exercises

to be more emphatic with the user in concrete scenarios as

cognitive walkthroughs [71], or user persons [72]. On the

other hand, there are also qualitative methods far from

usability standards which allow obtaining subjective

information from users themselves, such as contextual

design [73] or diary methods [74].

4.3 Methodological proposal: case study: 3D-AR

building visualization for architecture students

Research into users, contexts, and cultures has increasingly

taken place in product development cycles. Yet, this is

structured by the objectivist assumption that users are not

creative and do not know what they want [75]. The

methodological approach of this work let the end users, in

this case students of first course of ‘‘Architecture’’ and

‘‘Building Sciences and Technologies’’ degrees of La Salle

Campus Barcelona, Ramon Llull University, participate in

the definition of the final product, in this case a pedagogical

proposal, through methods that allowed them to be creative

during the design process.

The empirical vision of user research does not involve

the intended user in the conceptual design process. Few

user research methods come from experimental psychology

and ethnography and are focused on the observation and

analysis of user behavior. In this project, the intention was

to combine qualitative and quantitative methods in a mixed

methodology to analyze the complex area of individual

user experiences by not only observing their behavior but

also defining the causes of it.

Through qualitative methods, the goal was to explore

users’ desires, needs, and goals when learning about

informatics tools that they would use to present 3D projects

in their future work. The methods that were applied in this

work are a combination of objective methods based on

empirical models and subjective data-gathering techniques

inspired by constructivist psychology interviewing

techniques.

Thus, the active participation of end users can be a

reliable guide for creating a proposal to enhance creativity

in each end user’s field. Turning to Fig. 2, one can observe

the methodological process that was followed.

This project is methodologically based on the ‘‘user

research’’ that has been applied to the field of UX. Mixed

methods have been regularly applied in this discipline to

achieve pragmatic results in the assessment and improve-

ment of the relationship between subjects and students and

RA technologies for architecture. UX techniques are

geared toward the design of products and services, which is

an unorthodox way to consider the user–product relation-

ship. In this particular case, the student is considered to be

the user and the new method is considered to be the product

or service. In this way, the experience is framed as the

implementation of a series of tasks that allow for the

application of techniques for obtaining and systematizing

data to assess student experiences and identify product

improvements.

This study seeks to come closer to depicting the mental

model of a student, or the cognitive scenario in which the

elements are represented as part of the environment, tasks,

and principles that govern its operation and relations [76].

The student, at the end of the experience, will be able to

implement new methods for sharing information using

ubiquitous systems such as smart devices, which will

become increasingly widespread in future professional

work [77, 78].

According to Norman [79], there is always a differ-

ence between the mental model of the user and the

mental model of the designer in defining the handling

and characteristics of the object or service being

designed. This divergence causes deficiencies that

always lead to an upset or under-utilization on the part

of the user. For this reason, the developer must under-

stand the mental model of the users or potential users.

Investigating this divergence between the experience of

the students and intentions of the designer makes it

possible to evaluate the impact of including RA tools in

the experience and to identify points of improvement for

future iterations.

The project was modeled by the CAD/BIM Group of the

Architecture Department of La Salle, Ramon Llull Uni-

versity. The study was performed during the 2012–2013

academic year with students in their first year of an

Architecture and Building Engineering degree. The

experimental framework was completed in the course

‘‘Informatics Tools I’’ a six-ECTS-credit course that is

taught semi-annually.

The course consists of 4 h of lectures, spread over two

weekly sessions of 2 h each, and an additional 3 h of

practical sessions. The students also have weekly 1-h per-

sonal tutorials to address their doubts and solve practical

problems.

The basic objective of the course was to provide stu-

dents with basic skills in architectural interpretation and

reproduction in both 2D and 3D. The secondary objectives

were to enable students to print 2D and 3D reproductions,

as well as to explore methods of interactive visualization,

primarily through the publication of personal blogs and the

display of models with RA at the end of the course. A total

of 48 students participated in the study (18 females and

30 males, mean age = 19.54 years, standard deviation

(SD) = 2.15).

As shown in the proposed work scheme, there is a

constant interaction between the student and the professor

throughout the process. Of particular relevance is the

feedback process based on data provided by the students,

which will lead to active modification of the methodology

for future iterations of the process.

At the same time, to achieve the most optimal integra-

tion of the student, the course starts at a basic level to allow

the representation of any type of architectural project,

based on the requirements of architectural analysis and the

fundamentals of the projects required during the first

2 years of the degree program.

During the first phase, the methodological proposal

focuses on new techniques for enabling the publication and

interactive visualization of 3D models. The success of the

exercises in the second phase will define the success of the

proposal. In addition, an increase in student spatial abilities

and motivation to use such techniques will be evaluated.

Finally, because this class is taught on a yearly basis,

and in the 2011–2012 academic year, the authors began

designing the teaching experience based on multiple uses

of visualization tools [80], certain questions have already

been asked, which will help to compare the evolution of the

student profile in the past two academic years.

4.4 Experimental design

The first step of the process was the selection of the

architectural project to carry out. Usually, the projects

chosen for the experiment were preselected by the aca-

demic coordinators and the university studies’ board of

directors. The projects are generally local projects that

allow for a better approach and knowledge of each case by

the student: public buildings or projects designed by

architects that are part of the university professorship.

In the academic year of reference (2012–2013), ‘‘Casa

B-10’’ (1996–2001) by the architect Jaume Bach and ‘‘Casa

A-M’’ (1999–2001) by the architect Elena Mateu were

selected. These projects present diverse information that is

available in books or present in monographs in the uni-

versity library, with additional information from online

sources, which allows the realization of all types of exer-

cises proposed.

In general, the exercise consisted of making an exposi-

tion to represent a group of the developed project layouts

and had to include the graphic content (Fig. 3). The doc-

uments and information had to be made available to the

exposition visitor through 2D codes and AR techniques on

mobile devices. Format and layout orders were established

to include text, images, and graphs to represent the course

exercises.

Students were required to incorporate the following

elements into their final 3D presentations:

• QR code linking to the personal blog of the student
where they have published advances and pre-deliveries

in both 2D and 3D

• QR code linking to the 3D model so that it can be
downloaded to the mobile device for augmented

viewing

• Spontaneous markings generated by the student that
overlap with the 3D model previously downloaded

• Rendered images of the project as well as information
about it or the architect.

Conceptually, all of the requirements were designed

based on the premise that students can use free options. If

students were required to use the most compatible formats,

the exercise would have been more complicated. Reaching

this point, it should be noted that with the increasing

number of applications, viewers, and systems that facilitate

digital design, it is difficult to find one general solution

among different professional sectors [54].

This working ambiguity is easily observed depending on

the geographic area, with different preferred programs

depending on the country and region and even according to

the university or labor task within the same geographic

area. In the Spanish architectural educational context, the

products developed by Autodesk (San Rafael, CA, USA), a

software leader related to CAD and BIM technologies that

has free licenses for 3 years of the best known and most

commonly used software in drawing and modeling in 2D

and 3D, including AutoCAD�, 3DMax�, Maya�, and
Revit�, are the foundations of architectural work today.

With regard to the visualization framework, the working

systems and available programs for any format or device

are innumerable. However, attention should be focused on

the most common formats because of their frequent use and

standardization.

With Autodesk products, 3D model generation is pos-

sible directly from programs in DWFx or OBJ format (one

of the most widely accepted formats of AR applications),

though this option is not available in all of their products.

DWFx format, which is owned by Autodesk, allows for

visualization and interaction on computer and mobile

devices by installing Autodesk Design Review� or Auto-
CAD WS, which evolved to Autodesk360�. This format
allows one to work on all types of models both locally and

on the Internet, which is now known as ‘‘the cloud.’’ The

DWFx format is the functional equivalent to PDF3D [81]

and provides a free solution, although it is not common to

find presentations in Spanish teaching architecture frame-

work that use this format [41].

However, if export is made using the OBJ format,

accepted by applications typically used in the Spanish AR

framework as Juanio
�

(Metaio Inc., Munich, Germany),

Layar
�

(Amsterdam, Holland), and Augment
�

(Paris,

France), which are compatible with IOS and Android and

are free or low-cost solutions, a problem arises in the

process of exporting the CAD/BIM models to the AR

display system. It thus becomes necessary to import the

CAD model with Google Sketchup� (Google, Inc.,
Mountain View, CA, USA), a visualization and presenta-

tion tool for all types of 3D models. This solution provides

free student and professional licenses, allowing common

CAD/BIM formats, such as DWG, DXF, OBJ, and 3DS,

and raster image formats, such as JPG, GIF, and BMP, to

be imported.

Because there was not enough time to provide students

with a detailed explanation of how to perform the import,

the teachers were required to implement this step. The

students were thus required to submit their 3D models in

CAD, and the teachers were responsible for generating an

OBJ file with simple materials for students to mark it up

during their presentation. If the student subsequently

decided to improve the 3D model or change the OBJ

model, it was his/her responsibility to generate the new

model for the AR system visualization.

5 Results

As stated previously, to evaluate the degree of adaptation

to and satisfaction with the proposed method, as well as the

advantages of working with a mixed system of data col-

lection, students were invited to voluntarily participate in

the study.

Of the 79 students enrolled in the first course of

‘‘Informatics Tools I’’, 20 students had a final rating of NP

(Not Present), i.e., they did not attended the classes or

exams and were excluded from the study. Of the remaining

59 students, 48 took the two quantitative tests (81.35 % of

the students who followed the course and 60.75 % of the

students enrolled, taking into account NP students). For this

evaluation, ISO 9241-11, which provides several usability

guidelines to define effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfac-

tion, was used. The tests were designed with two primary

objectives: to obtain the technological profile of the student

in terms of his/her use and habits surrounding mobile and

Internet technologies and to obtain an overall assessment of

the work.

To assess the academic level achieved after imple-

menting the proposed project, the results of this course

were compared to those from the previous academic year,

in which a traditional methodology was used in the 2D and

3D design phases. To design the pretest or technological

profile test, and the posttest or usage/satisfaction test, a

structured test was used within the university’s Intranet

Moodle system. All of the questions were scored on a five-

point Likert scale (1 = never or strongly disagree,

5 = always or strongly agree). The model used was based

on previous projects [41].

For the qualitative study (using BLA), a balanced

sample of 10 students (5 men and 5 women) who agreed to

participate was randomly selected. In the following sec-

tions, the data collected are reviewed before discussing the

results and their implications.

5.1 User profile and motivation: quantitative study 1

The first test, as shown in Fig. 2, was given once the first

phase of the class ended, at a time when the students

already knew the main characteristics of an architectural

project. This phase had duration of about 2 months, which

allowed for the students to gain a basic understanding of

the subject at hand as well as of the basic concepts in

Artistic Architectural Drawing, Technical Drawing, Con-

struction, Architectural Mathematics, and Physics classes.

The objective of the test was threefold: to assess the

technological profile of the student according to where and

how he or she uses technology, to obtain a feedback on the

theoretical/practical process in the 2D phase, and to char-

acterize students’ perception and knowledge of RA

technology.

The results obtained should allow for a first approxi-

mation of whether the student is ready to use mobile

technology and ubiquitous Internet connections for the

publication of and interaction with architectural content.

Additionally, student perceptions of the system used in the

2D process and the potentiality of RA will be compared

with the second test to get a clear indication of the evo-

lution of student perceptions of, motivation toward, and

satisfaction with the proposed methods.

The first dataset (Fig. 4) shows almost unanimous use of

laptops and smartphones. In-depth comparative analyses of

the responses to the same questions in the previous year

(2011–2012 academic year, in the same subject and with

the same profile of students, with a total of 78 students:

39 females and 39 males, mean age = 19.40 years,

SD = 3.39) affirm that there is a growing commonality in

the way that students communicate/work/study/interact

with digital devices.

The comparative data show how the increased use of

laptops and smartphones, which integrate technologies

such as playing MP3s/MP4s and digital cameras, caused a

sharp drop in the use of certain devices, especially desktop

computers and basic mobile phones.

Conceptually, such high levels of mobile device usage,

close to 100 % in the current course (Fig. 4), indicate that

students are better prepared to work with systems and

procedures online, which must be confirmed by additional

questions in this round and at the end of the experiment.

Other data extracted from this first study show that about

84 % of students use computers for informational or social

purposes, and this figure raises to 90 % for the study tasks.

These figures are lower for mobile devices, although

interesting trends can be observed: Currently, 64.6 % of

students use mobile devices to search for information (an

increase of almost 20 points over the previous year), about

77 % used for them for social purposes, while the pro-

portion of students who use them for work and study is

lower (an average of 30 %, still far below the 90 % usage

of computers for these tasks).

The increased use of mobile devices and the decline of

desktop devices are reflected directly by changes in con-

nection locations: There has been an increase in the use of

public Wi-Fi (from 17.9 to 39.6 % of students) and a

decrease in connecting to the Internet on computers within

the university (from 92.3 to 85.4 % of students) or at home

(from 97.4 to 93.1 % of students).

In conclusion, addressing the first objective of this

phase, it is found that the students in the sample observed

are strong technology consumers, especially mobile tech-

nology, and frequently use all types of Internet services (as

shown in Fig. 5), which favors the implementation new

teaching methods that involve the use of technologies that

are currently available to and accepted by students.

The next objective of this phase was to assess the degree

of student satisfaction with the theoretical/practical meth-

ods used in the 2D representation. To address this objec-

tive, a set of three questions were constructed and

evaluated on a Likert scale (ranging from 1: strongly dis-

agree to 5: totally agree); the results are shown in Fig. 6.

The results show that 63.5 % of the students had a good

degree of motivation to enact the proposed method (ratings

of 4 or 5) and only 12.5 % of the students responded

negatively (ratings of 2 or 1). Regarding the practical

system used, 72.9 % of students gave ‘‘highly satisfactory’’

responses, and an even higher proportion (81.3 %) was

satisfied with the usefulness of the content developed.

While these data offered a highly positive valuation of the

traditional method implemented in the 2D phase, it was not

until the completion of the course that the results could be

verified, by comparing students’ perceptions of the two

systems proposed.

Finally, in this first test, before specifically discussing

the subject, questions were asked about three aspects

related to the RA technology: the perceived degree of

difficulty of use, the degree of usefulness in working with

three-dimensional models, and the perceived usefulness of

the technology to architectural studies.

As shown in Fig. 7, initially, students did not know how

to assess the degree of difficulty in the use of such a

technology, as was expected, and 97.9 % of the responses

fell into the middle category (neutral or both slightly

positive and negative). However, the students perceived the

usefulness of AR technology in both 3D representations

and in future architectural work, evaluating it with positive

values ranging between 62.5 and 58.4 %, respectively,

although there were still high rates of indecision (neutral

responses: 35.4 and 39.6 %, respectively) while waiting for

the practical experience of the second phase.

In conclusion, the study was carried out with a group of

students that was uniform by gender, though not by origin.

A total of 34 % of the group was foreign students, which

could lead to a differentiation in basic education or prior

knowledge. However, the results of the test profile reflect

fairly homogeneous knowledge and technology use. Note

that three persons in the group were hearing impaired; this

profile level difference was not denoted with respect to the

remainder of the class in terms of the technology use.

5.2 Usability test: quantitative study 2

The second test was realized after the second phase of the

course, prior to the review and publication of the final

marks, in accordance with the methodology shown in

Fig. 2. At this point in the course, the end of the first half of

the first academic year around the end of January, the

students have already completed Construction I, Physics,

and Mathematics, in addition to the basic concepts in

Drawing and Descriptive Geometry.

The objective of this second test was threefold: to

compare the efficiency of the two methods by comparing

perceptions of the 2D system before and after having

worked with methods for 3D viewing, to understand the

perceptions students on the use of the technologies for 3D

viewing (in particular, the AR), and to assess the degree of

usability in general of the content, structure, and method-

ology of the technology. By focusing on the objectives

mentioned above, the first analysis evaluated the traditional

methodology (used in the 2D phase) based on student

perspectives from the first test and from the same questions

in the 3D phase.

Figure 8 shows a comparison of the pretest data (see

Fig. 6) with responses to the same questions after the

course was finished. The perceived utility of the 2D method

was initially positive (agree or strongly agree) for 81.3 %

of the sample, but only 32.4 % thought so at the second

assessment. Neutral valuation increased from 16.7 to

47.1 %, and the slightly negative rating increased from 2.1

to 20.6 %.

As will be discussed later, the motivation behind this

sudden change was explained in the private comments of

students by the perception that it is easier to get the 2D

architectural drawing from a 3D model than it is to do so in

reverse, which expedites the procurement of quality printed

layouts.

This trend was repeated in the responses to the next

question, which examined the practical method used in 2D:

Positive evaluations were reduced from 72.9 to 44.1 %,

neutral evaluations increased from 25 to 35.3 %, and

negative evaluations increased from 2.1 to 20.6 %. How-

ever, due to either the innate difficulty of working in 3D or

the lack of working time reported by the students,

responses to the question of motivation for using the 2D

method did not vary greatly, perhaps due to the concen-

tration of neutral responses (increasing from 25 to 41.2 %)

and with the predominance of positive assessments (which

only declined from 62.5 to 53 %).

Finally, when the students were asked about their

motivation to practice the method, a decrease in negative

values (from 12.5 to 5.9 %) was found, as well as greater

concentration of neutral responses (from 25 to 41.2 %)

with a slight decline in positive values.

The second objective of this phase focused on student

perceptions of the use and usefulness of AR as a system for

presenting architectural projects by comparing the system

proposed with the method used in the 2D phase.

Figure 9 compares the results obtained before and after

the exercise on how the students perceived the AR system.

To analyze the utility of AR, it is necessary to differ-

entiate between the proposed experiment and overall per-

ceptions. While in the first case, the values changed only

minimally (positive ratings fell by 8.4 %, thus increasing

negative ratings by 9.7 %), when usefulness was evaluated

at a more global level, perceived usefulness drastically

reduced by 33.1 %, a margin that is shared among the

neutral responses, which increased by 17.5 %, and the

negative responses, which increased by 15.5 %.

The possible reasons for these results and their rela-

tionship with the usual contents of architectural projects are

described later in this paper. However, it can be affirmed

that the reduction of utility observed has a direct rela-

tionship with the difficulty perceived by the students in the

use of this technology, with an increase of 29.8 % (from

10.4 to 41.2 %) in students who felt that AR technology

was difficult to implement or use.

Figure 10 shows the results of the comparison between

the 2D and 3D methods used as well as the comparison

between using the 3D visualization and a blog about AR

techniques.

Based on the analysis of the latest data, the majority of

students did not favor one method over another, giving a

neutral rating to all questions. However, there was a

slightly more positive perception of the 3D method versus

the 2D method, both regarding ease of use (where 35.2 %

of ratings were positive vs. 26.4 % that were negative) and

perceived usefulness (29.4 vs. 14.7 %), as well as in gen-

eral (26.5 vs. 20.6 %). In terms of the viewing methods

used in the 3D phase, students mostly flocked to the DWFx

format embedded in their personal blogs before working

with AR (32.4 vs. 14.7 %), probably because this method is

much more direct and simple.

Figure 11 shows the perceptions of the students toward

various specific elements of the experience, focusing on the

degree of perceived usability. Again, the percentage of

neutral answers is the largest, but the high positive

assessment of almost all aspects, and in particular the

documentation and structure of the exercise and the

improvement provided by AR in the presentation of the

architectural 3D models, can be emphasized. The only

elements with low rates of positive responses, as already

found in previous studies [62], are the definition of the final

3D models (23.5 %) and the stability of the display

(20.6 %).

5.3 Final qualitative study: BLA implementation

Qualitative methods are commonly employed in usability

studies and, inspired by experimental psychology and the

hypothetical-deductive paradigm, employ samples of users

who are relatively limited. Nevertheless, the Socratic par-

adigm from postmodern psychology is also applicable and

useful in these usability studies because it targets details

related to the UX with high reliability and uncovers subtle

information about the product or technology studied [19].

This migration from the hypothetical-deductive para-

digm to the Socratic paradigm was inspired by the para-

digm shift in clinical psychology away from constructivism

and toward other postmodern schools of psychotherapy.

This psychological model defends the subjective treatment

of the user, unlike the objective hypothetical-deductive

model [83].

Starting from the Socratic paradigm basis, the BLA

system (Bipolar Laddering) has been designed. BLA

method could be defined as a psychological exploration

technique, which points out the key factors of user expe-

rience. The main goal of this system was to ascertain which

concrete characteristic of the product entails users’ frus-

tration, confidence, or gratitude (between many others).

The BLA method works on positive and negative poles

to define the strengths and weaknesses of the product. Once

the element is obtained, the laddering technique is going to

be applied to define the relevant details of the product. The

object of a laddering interview was to uncover how product

attributes, usage consequences, and personal values are

linked in a person’s mind. The characteristics obtained

through laddering application will define what specific

factors make consider an element as strength or as a

weakness. BLA performing consists in three steps:

1. Elicitation of the elements: The implementation of the

test starts from a blank template for the positive

elements (strengths) and another exactly the same for

the negative elements (weaknesses). The interviewer

(in this case an academic tutor) will ask the users (the

student) to mention what aspects of the subject and

experiment they like best or help them in their tasks.

The elements mentioned need to be summarized in one

word or short sentence. This first step may be open or

limited, i.e., positing a number of aspects without

limits or reducing them to a specific number, as in the

present case where every student was asked to indicate

three positive aspects and three negative ones;

2. Marking of elements: Once the list of positive and

negative elements is completed, the interviewer will

ask the user to mark each one from 0 (lowest possible

level of satisfaction) to 10 (maximum level of

satisfaction);

3. Elements definition: Once the elements have been

assessed, the qualitative phase starts. The interviewer

reads out the elements of both lists to the user and asks

for a justification of each one of the elements

performing laddering technique. Why is it a positive

element? Why this mark? The answer must be a

specific explanation of the exact characteristics that

make the mentioned element a strength or weakness of

the product.

Once the element has been defined, the interviewer asks

to the user for a solution of the problem he just describes in

the case of negative elements or an improvement in the

case of positive elements. Figure 12 shows an example of

the BLA test used:

From the results obtained, the next step was to polarize

the elements based on two criteria:

1. Positive (Px)/Negative (Nx): The student must differ-

entiate the elements perceived as strong points of the

experience that helped them to improve the type of

work proposed as useful, satisfactory, or simply

functional aesthetic (see Table 1), in front of the

negative aspects that did not facilitate work or simply

need to be modified to be satisfactory or useful (see

Table 2);

2. Common Elements (xC)/Particular (xP): Finally, the

positive and negative elements that were repeated in

the students’ answers (common elements) and the

responses that were only given by one of the

students (particular elements) were separated

according to the coding scheme shown in Tables 1

and 2.

The common elements that were mentioned at a higher

rate are the most important aspects to use, improve, or

modify (according to their positive or negative sign). The

particular elements, due to their citation by only a single

user, may be ruled out or treated in later stages of

development.

The individual values obtained for both indicators,

positive and negative, are shown in the following Tables 3

and 4. Once the features mentioned by the students were

identified and given values, the third step defined by the

BLA initiated the qualitative stage in which the students

described and provided solutions or improvements to each

of their contributions in the format of an open interview.

Table 5 shows the main improvements or changes that

the students proposed for both positive and negative ele-

ments. Only the ‘‘common’’ aspects, which were men-

tioned by at least 2 of the students, have been included.

At this point, before discussing the results, it is inter-

esting to identify the most relevant items obtained from the

BLA, by high rates of citation, high scores, or a

combination of both. Because work is carried out following

an open-ended method, some of the above elements were

not at the focus of the study (i.e., the evaluation of new

visual techniques in the teaching field). Thus, only the

elements closest to the motive of the study are highlighted.

Concerning positive remarks, the organization of the

subject (MI: 60 %, Av: 8.33), the usefulness of the knowl-

edge acquired (MI: 40 %, Av: 9.75), and the novelty and

appeal of the AR methods over the traditional 2D methods

(MI: 40 %, Av: 8.25) can be highlighted. In short, the

enhancements to the methods for presenting architectural

projects should not be modified in the redesign process.

In terms of the main negative comments, students

clearly identified a lack of time or an excess of content for

practical realization especially in 3D (MI: 70 %, Av: 3.86),

problems with the applications used and their stability (MI:

50 %, Av: 3.60), as well as greater detail or more infor-

mation per use, and the working procedures for the use of

of the applications. Technically, these would be the main

aspects to modify in future iterations of the proposed

method. Table 5 shows the features with the highest rates

of mention in proposals for improvements (between 40 and

80 % of the students mentioned them).

In summary, two key issues have been identified: the

lack of time in implementing the practices and the need for

supporting documentation that would allow giving more

information to the students about the processes involved

with AR, and the way to solve problems in the imple-

mentation of the exercises. This last aspect may encompass

the need to increase the amount of time for explanation and

practice of the exercises related to the use of the blog and

the AR. Thus, a determining factor in the perception of the

student of the proposed methodology was the lack of time.

It was recurrently found that there was insufficient time for

completion of all the proposals submitted, although the

students positively valued, and were not in favor of

their usefulness in the medium and long term.

6 Discussion

From a quantitative point of view, a diachronic or longi-

tudinal research has been conducted, which usually lends

itself to studying the relationship between independent

variables (structure of the course, implemented technolo-

gies, methods, etc.) and a dependent variable, which in the

present case would be academic performance. The sample

that was used defines this research as ‘‘quasi-experimen-

tal’’, given that it was not possible to randomly establish

working groups, and the groups were selected according to

the academic year in which they studied. A great limitation

of this model is the difficulty of assessing whether the

changes observed were due to the intervention itself or to

other factors not controlled for. In cases in which work is

carried out with fixed groups, statistical theories strongly

discourage using analysis of covariance (typical when one

can have groups of control systems and random sampling).

The solution is to work with the correlation of results,

because of identical variables in the pre- and posttests,

making it possible to analyze the change in scores [84].

The appropriate statistical analysis will depend on the

grouping of the subjects (equalized or by blocks) and the

samples to compare: Usually, ‘‘Student’s t test’’ or the

‘‘factorial analysis of variance’’ is applied to related sam-

ples. These analyses always require additional ones, and

the relationship of the quantitative data with the data

obtained from the qualitative study conducted using the

BLA method will be assessed, providing an innovative

character to the experiment.

Having defined the starting point for the analysis of the

data obtained, and turning back to the initial test or profile

test, one can affirm that students who currently take

architecture classes in the authors’ faculty mostly use

mobile devices of latest generation, also called smart-

phones, for all kinds of activities (see Figs. 4, 5). The

results show a growing use of devices such as smartphones

and tablets as opposed to desktop computers (which were

more common in the last 5 years). This high implantation

rate positively predisposes students to using these devices

in an educational way, increasing their motivation to

understand course content, thereby improving their aca-

demic performance. This hypothesis is confirmed when

students’ academic results in the authors’ class from the

past 5 years are analyzed.

As shown in Fig. 13, the implementation of the EHEA,

which in the case of the class studied mean the temporary

reduction of a year-long class to a semester-long class and

the loss of 50 % of classroom hours, marks a clear decline

in the final grades for both 2D and 3D projects. Analyzing

the structure and contents of previous courses, the possible

causes for this decline are multifold: the lack of foresight

and adaptation of the amount of content and its difficulty

according to the new temporary plan, especially during the

first year of implementing the EHEA. In the 2010–2011

academic year, the students needed a greater number of

hours dedicated to some topics designed for annual testing

(in previous years) and could not learn them in a much

more short and intensive way. Giving students less time to

assimilate theoretical concepts led to a sharp decrease in

the quality of the student projects. This course provided

instruction on both 2D and 3D systems and followed the

same structure as past courses, which included a constant

review process of the projects that the final grade was

based on, and scores in the phase 3D were always higher

than those in the 2D phase.

In the second year of the EHEA (2011–2012), the fac-

ulty made changes to adapt the subject to the new situation

and, in particular, adapted the type of practices (reducing

the complexity of the model) and explored new methods

for working (reducing the printed deliverables and

searching for digital outputs to minimize the time com-

mitment [60]). The new proposal succeeded in boosting

academic outcomes, especially for the 2D project, without

having an entire year to do so. For comparison, we have

using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a threshold

of 0.05, getting significant differences between the quali-

fications of the courses 2011–2012 and 2008–2009:

F = 9.05, p = 0.002.

With the proposed method implemented in the academic

year 2012–2013, it was concluded that there is no statis-

tically significant differences (F = 3.276, p = 0.075),

between 2008–2009 (with a mean of 5.45, one can consider

this year as a previous indicator, because of in pre-EHEA

period, all 2D practice results are between 5.25–5.78) and

2012–2013 (M = 5.24), as the statistical significance (two-

tailed) is 0.075, which exceeds the threshold of 0.05.

These results indicate that the adaptation of the content

and processes designed for the 2D phase led to results

comparable to the average academic results that were

historically found in this subject. However, this positive

outcome should be questioned, because student perfor-

mance did not increase (general purpose of the EHEA), and

student perceptions of and motivation for the 2D work

suffered ostensibly once this method was compared to the

3D method (as mentioned previously in evaluating the

results of Fig. 8).

Although this interpretation is extracted from little

quantitative data that are very generic, the mixed approach

used allows to corroborate the quantitative data with the

qualitative data collected using the BLA (shown in

Tables 1, 2, 5). Although the structure of the course was

highly valued, the excess content regarding the time and

the appeal of the 3D method with respect to the traditional

2D method make it necessary to modify this first phase, as

the students desired increased explanation and develop-

ment time and some aspects of the course were incom-

patible with the credit system proposed by the EHEA and

implemented by the university.

If the results of the 3D projects are analyzed, which

were added to the technological innovation described in

this paper, and are compared with those of the previous

courses, one notices a significant improvement during the

post-EHEA period (F = 3.48, p = 0.05) and results equal

to those of the pre-EHEA period, during which there were

no significant differences between courses (F = 0.30,

p = 0.57).

This improved academic performance can be attributed

in part to the course curriculum, the methodology of

visualization with AR, and the utility and enhancement that

it provided in working in 3D, all of which resulted in

positive data obtained from the BLA. However, there are a

number of negative aspects (Table 2) and solutions pro-

posed (Table 5) by students that have a direct impact on the

3D phase, including the lack of time for practical realiza-

tion and for explaining RA and the techniques for render-

ing in 3D, as well as a lack of stability of the applications

and models in RA. Comparing the academic results with all

of the negative aspects and improvements that were cited in

the BLA and those that can be drawn from the quantitative

data (Figs. 9, 10, 11), it is clear that the students appreci-

ated and were highly motivated to work in 3D, as this is a

very useful architectural method; nevertheless, they

observed that it is a difficult domain that is further com-

plicated when working with advanced models, which

requires greater time for projects and explanations.

In evaluating RA as a working tool, RA was deeply

appreciated both in the quantitative stage (Figs. 9, 10) and

in the qualitative stage (Table 1), although the students

questioned the usefulness and stability of the system when

their projects or models were more complicated. In such

cases, working with online systems such as that provided

by the DWFx is valuable because they render the learning

process fast and stable and allow for more user-friendly

interaction (Fig. 10). The BLA method has shown that it is

necessary to increase the time for the RA explanation and

project, as the perception of the students is that this extra

time would help them to improve the stability as well as the

final quality of the work.

7 Conclusions

The mixed method used has demonstrated its usefulness as

a dynamic system for capturing information related to

students’ experiences with technological elements in

education.

Although mixed methods are common in UX and HCI,

in technological teaching and, more specifically, in the

architecture teaching framework, quantitative methods are

commonly used. Using a mixed system expands the innate

limitation of qualitative methods, which involve the users’

emotional subjective responses. Qualitative methods are

not just a problem, but a step forward; in addition to

identifying new work variables, qualitative methods enable

to obtain additional information from the quantitative

variables that would otherwise have not been achievable.

The main drawback of the mixed method described is the

need to design quantitative surveys with questions adapted

to the possible answers to the qualitative methods. Other-

wise, it is possible to obtain differentiated data between the

two types of studies and analyses, and would thus be

impossible or very difficult to relate them later.

The main advantages demonstrated focused on the

identification of aspects related to the design process, and

the data were much more specific than those that would

have been obtained through quantitative methods only,

which is usually the focus of experiments on general

questions. In the case presented, data were obtained that

demonstrate how the implementation of the EHEA collided

heads-on with learning methods that were based on the

practical experiences of the users. By including in the total

number of credits for the course the hours that students

dedicated to personal work, the hours available for aca-

demic work declined (with respect to what was previously

the case), confirming the need to add back the required

time for learning, practicing, and assimilating the concepts

that subjects taught for only a semester lack. Reduced time

leads to teaching overload or the simplification of the

material, which both negatively affect student motivation.

Focusing on the main objective of the study, student

motivation and satisfaction with the proposed system were

evaluated, obtaining qualitative feedback for the main

items that, according to the students, should be imple-

mented in using RA as a common tool for visualization of

and interaction with 3D models in architecture education. It

has been demonstrated how the proposal method not only

improves academic performance but also generates a high

degree of motivation and satisfaction among students,

which leads to a greater involvement in the subject matter

and its contents, as described in the Sect. 6.

The initial hypothesis set in the Sect. 1 was premised on

the concept that with a minor investment of time and the

use of visual mobile devices, students could obtain better

results through having more motivating and satisfying

experiences; this hypothesis has been confirmed in part.

Although it has been demonstrated that the use of mobile

technologies and visual systems of the latest generation is

more motivating for students, they do not reduce the

investment of time because they required more hours of

explanation, practice, and debugging to create the final

projects. However, neither the lack of time nor the need to

invest more to achieve the objectives of the course is a

variable that adversely affects the experience; they actually

confirm the motivational nature of the experience and are

aspects to target for improvement in future iterations.

For future directions of work, two possibilities have

been clearly identified: the adaptation of content to people

with disabilities and a study of the emotional user response

to content displayed according to their profile and the

technology used. While the rules of accessibility and

usability are clear and commonly implemented in Web

browsing, in mobile technology, different interfaces and

developers with isolated applications that need manual

configuration to adapt to the users’ profile are found. This

aspect, perhaps unrelated to the basic content of an archi-

tecture degree, is being made available to the Faculty

within Multimedia Studies, such as under the research line

defined as ‘‘tele-assistance’’.

For example, and as a suggestion from one of the deaf

students who conducted the experiment, it would be

interesting to label information or include textual infor-

mation in the virtual elements to provide more information

on the model. In a similar way for blind people, the

example could include audio items that are activated when

the device recognizes the proximity (through GPS) to the

QR mark; the device could then narrate the relevant

information from the model. Currently, and in collabora-

tion with the Graphic Expression Department of the

Architecture Faculty of the Polytechnic University of

Catalonia, projects are underway for an urban display

focusing on the inclusion of textual elements and audio for

people with disabilities.

The second line of development would be to study the

emotional behavior of users according to their typology

and the content. In this regard, previous experiments

conducted by the authors’ team could be the foundation of

this work [85–87].These experiences are based on known

emotional assessment models used in such wide-ranging

areas, such as psychology, neuropsychology, and sociology

[88, 89].
