Abstract 
This work presents a novel systematic approach for the construction of domain 
ontologies. The suggested approach uses a semi-automatic construction methodology. 
For this study, parent-child concept pairs are taken from a previous work. Novel 
contributions include building and completing branches, introducing new relations, and 
resolving inconsistencies and contradictions. For the process systems engineering (PSE) 
domain the ISA88 Standard is chosen as a promising starting point for automatic text 
processing. Finally, this work concludes with a discussion of the ISA88 Standard based 
on the conclusions that can be obtained from the application of this semi-automatic 
construction methodology.

1. Introduction 
There has been a growing interest in the field of PSE for using ontologies as knowledge 
models (Muñoz, 2011), intelligent data analysis of databases (Roda and Musulin, 2014), 
intelligent software applications (Morbach et al., 2010) and many other applications, each 
one using different ontology models. The use of a general domain PSE ontology based 
on already existing and accepted standards would not only facilitate the development of 
these and other applications, but also their integration and coordination. Departing from 
the parent-child concept pairs resulting from a previous work (Farreres et al., 2014), this 
work describes the systematic procedures used to refine the relationships to be modelled 
in the core of the ontology. Particularly, an ontology can be defined as "an explicit 
specification of a conceptualization" (Gruber, 1993). In the field of Computer 
Engineering, large ontologies for common knowledge have been developed together with 
tools based on internet databases, reference books and many documents from the Internet 



2  C. Dombayci et al. 

(Vivaldi and Rodríguez, 2002). This is expected to lead to semi-automatic procedures to 
help experts to develop domain ontologies, although a great effort is still required to filter 
the noise obtained from extensive indiscriminate searches.  
 
In parallel, expert teams have devoted a commendable effort to produce standards. Using 
language analysis tools, and in order to combine efforts for creating domain ontologies, 
the texts defining standards seem very well suited to be taken as a source to synthesize 
manual and automatic approaches in the most efficient way. Thus, the aim of this work is 
to investigate the semi-automatic development of domain ontologies in general, and to 
validate the hypothesis that a document defining a standard is an efficient starting point 
from which the ontology may be later extended and enriched. 
 
The ISA88 Standard for batch control is a document that is assumed suitable for creating 
a domain ontology because it is a technical document clearly defining models and 
terminology, including the explanation of processes, data structures and language 
guidelines. The assumption is that intelligent selection of texts will reduce noise and allow 
fast and straight identification of concepts and relations. 
 
In a previous work (Farreres et al., 2014), the ISA88 document was processed using a 
number of tools, and a set of concept pairs were extracted and manually revised. Each 
pair was a proposed relation, either between a parent concept and its children, or between 
a concept and its parts. This study is a continuation of such preliminary work for building 
a domain ontology. This building process is explained in a systematic way describing the 
suggested methodology and the quality of the resulting ontology is assessed. 

2. Methodology  
Common strategies for identifying concepts for a domain ontology manage concepts from 
the most specific ones to the most general ones (also reverse) or from the most important 
concepts to the most specific and most general ones (López, 1999 and Corcho et al. 2003). 
Conversely, this work identifies the concepts from a technical standard that is considered 
the basis for the domain. As a result, the proposed construction methodology is 
significantly different from the other strategies, and the ontology is built from these 
identified concepts by using a semi-automatic construction methodology. The following 
sections present a brief description of the steps of the methodology.  
 
2.1. Phase-1: Building branches by composing parent-child concept pairs 
A core ontology is built using parent-child concept pairs from Farreres et al. (2014). In 
the case of ISA88 Standard 266 concepts are added with 188 ‘is a’ relations. The ontology 
is enriched with the meronymy (‘partOf’) relations and 81 doubtful cases are left apart.  
 
2.2. Phase-2: Doubtful cases, introducing ‘partOf‘ relationship and information from the 
figures in the standard  
First, doubtful parent-child concept pairs (e.g. concepts with ‘and’ and ‘or’) are identified 
and solved manually. Next, graphical information is extracted by a human expert and the 
newly detected relations and concepts are introduced to further enrich the ontology. The 
ISA88 Standard contains figures that cannot be processed via automatic pattern matching 
owing to the fact that figures cannot be processed by the computers. This is revealed as a

Automatic Construction Approach  3 

difficulty for the automation of the process and it is solved manually processing the 
standard by a human expert. 
 
2.3. Phase-3: Adding commonsense and ontology pruning 
Until Phase-3 knowledge introduced in the ontology was all from the text and graphics 
of the supporting Standard. However, this may include neither commonsense nor the 
knowledge shared within a domain that must not be conveyed in a text because of its 
obviousness. After Phase-1 and Phase-2, conceptual gaps occur as consequence of the 
lack of explicit commonsense knowledge in the text.  
 
Some simple and straightforward cases of commonsense knowledge are then addressed 
using a set of pre-established rules for introducing implicit information that can be 
understood without any explanation. A particular case is identified and solved following 
the rules 1 and 2. Thus, the UnitRecipe concept, composed of two nouns (1), would be 
moved as a child of Recipe; and RegulatoryControl, composed of an adjective and a noun 
(2), would be moved as a child of Control. 141 concepts were refined in this way and 
additional ‘is a’ relations are added to the ontology.  

Noun A+ Noun B
    'is a'    
�⎯⎯⎯⎯�   Noun B (1) 

Adjective A+ Noun C
    'is a'    
�⎯⎯⎯⎯�   Noun C                (2) 

Another particular case led to the creation of additional ‘partOf’ relations. Container, 
Combination, and similar concepts are often extracted as parent concepts from ‘is a’ 
relations. However, these concepts indicate the aggregation of further concepts. In this 
case the actual relation that correctly represents the model is not an ‘is a’ relation, but a 
‘partOf’ relation. In the case of the ISA88 based PSE ontology, 20 concepts were refined 
concluding with adding 34 new ‘partOf’ relations and 22 new concepts.  
 
Another case of commonsense rule will lead to the identification (Zhu et al., 2009) and 
elimination of redundant relations already presented by other relations. 

3. Example of methodology (GeneralRecipe segment) 
Figure 1 shows the ‘is-a’ segment originating in GeneralRecipe after Phase-1 and Phase-
2. It is next used as an example to discuss the methodology steps detailed as follows:  
 
i). Container, Collection and Combination concepts: Figure 1 shows GeneralRecipe as a 

subconcept of Container. As explained in Section 2.3, Container is better modelled by 
a ‘partOf’ relation. Figure 2 shows the new added ‘partOf’ relations.

Figure 2. GeneralRecipe segment after Phase-3 (Only ‘is a’ and ‘partOf’ relations related with 
GeneralRecipe segment are represented, in case of clarity) 

 
ii). Introducing commonsense knowledge: In addition, concepts given by compound 

nouns need reviewing (Section 2.3). For instance, it is apparent that the 
EnterpriseWideRecipe concept should be moved as a child concept of Recipe as shown 
in Figure 3a as before. Figure 3b shows the result.  

 
iii). Removing redundant relations: Since there are two ways to reach Recipe from 

GeneralRecipe, the relation between GeneralRecipe and Recipe can be removed. This 
redundant relation is shown in Figure 3b. 

 
Finally, Figure 2 shows the final diagram after implementing the proposed methodology. 

4. Quality measure results 
The direct pattern matching of the raw text after Phase-1 and Phase-2 results in a flat 
ontology (Figure 4a), lacking commonsense. Although there are no standard metrics for 
the quality of ontologies, some topological information have been used for measuring. 
One topological aspect taken into account is the width and depth of the ontology. Figure 
4b shows a partial snapshot of the ontology after Phase-2 and Phase-3. It is clear that the 
first ontology is flat while the second one is deeper and tree-like, which has been 
considered as a sign of quality and improvement. 
 
Additionally, Figure 5 shows the differences in the number of concepts per level after 
each Phase. Phase 1 generates an ontology that has most of its concepts at depth 2. After 
Phase-2 the number of concepts increases but there are few concepts below depth 2. After 
adding commonsense, the distribution is more reasonable, with a spread number of 
concepts between level 1 and 4, and a significant queue arriving to depth 6.

Finally, the improvement obtained by using a text defining a standard (regarding the 
reduction of noise) is an assumption that can be hardly validated in a quantitative and 
systematic way. However, the use of another text could provide an illustrative reference. 
Towards this end, the same methodology was used to process a play of Shakespeare 
(1611) and nothing was produced: no pattern for the ‘is a’ or the ‘part of’ rules is found 
in the text. 

5. Conclusions and future research 
This paper proposes a semi-automatic methodology for building ontologies, presents 
most of the concepts of batch control in PSE by using the ISA88 Standard, and introduces 
commonsense knowledge to the ontology. The use of technical standards for building 
domain ontologies has been assumed. Another significant outcome raised in this study is 
the human expert introduction to the automatic ontology construction. An additional 
interesting result is that other relations (‘input’ and ‘output’) have been detected in 
addition to the ‘is a’ and ‘partOf’ relations for the enrichment process of ontology.

Moreover, the ISA88 Standard consistency could be assessed from the point of view and 
formalisms of ontology development, and conclusions and guidelines for producing 
technical standards have been obtained. This includes ambiguous figures, undefined 
concepts, extended use of synonymy, and use of adjectives in the document which have 
been identified as problems, not only for the implication of automatic processes, but also 
for human readers. This contributes an analysis and suggestions for developing technical 
standards. On the other hand, the ISA88 Standard should be considered as a first case 
study for a research line, and the learning outcomes from this work are expected to be of 
practical interest to further ontology developments from other documents (e.g. ISA95).  
 
Further work in this research line includes the enrichment of the ontology by extending 
the present semi-automatic development of domain ontologies for PSE using other 
technical documents and automatically searching the Internet to get implicit knowledge. 
The outcome of this systematic procedure could afterwards be compared to already 
existing ontologies of the same domain developed manually (Muñoz et al., 2011). Using 
some similarity metrics in order to validate their completeness. Hence, relevant feedback 
could be retrieved in order to further improve the systematic approach presented. 
Furthermore, the findings of this study provide information for developing the 
methodology as well as improving quality of resulting ontology from ISA88 Standard.
