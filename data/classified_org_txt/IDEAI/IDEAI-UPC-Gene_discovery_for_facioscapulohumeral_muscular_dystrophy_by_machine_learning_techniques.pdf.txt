Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disorder 
that shows a preference for the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles. FSHD 
affects about one in 20-400,000 people, and no effective therapeutic strategies are 
known to halt disease progression or reverse muscle weakness or atrophy. Many 
genes may be incorrectly regulated in affected muscle tissue, but the mechanisms 
responsible for the progressive muscle weakness remain largely unknown.
Although machine learning (ML) has made significant inroads in biomedical disci-
plines such as cancer research, no reports have yet addressed FSHD analysis 
using ML techniques. This study explores a specific FSHD data set from a ML 
perspective. We report results showing a very promising small group of genes 
that clearly separates FSHD samples from healthy samples. In addition to 
numerical prediction figures, we show data visualizations and biological evidence 
illustrating the potential usefulness of these results.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has made sig-
nificant inroads in the fields of bioinformatics and bio-
medicine; see, for example, Schölkopf et al. (2004).
Specifically, in cancer research a variety of ML algo-
rithms have been developed for tumor prediction by asso-
ciating gene expression patterns with clinical outcomes 
for patients with tumors (Lukas et al., 2004). The major-
ity of this research has focused on building accurate clas-
sification models from reduced sets of features. Some of 
the analyses also aimed to gain an understanding of the 
differences between normal and malignant cells and to 
identify genes that are differentially regulated during 
cancer development.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an 
autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder that shows 
a preference for the facial, shoulder and upper arm mus-
cles, and is the third most common inherited muscular 
dystrophy (Flanigan, 2004; Tawil, 2008). Its incidence 
varies with geographic location and probably within dif-

ferent racial groups, recent estimates being one in about 
400,000 to one in 20,000 (MDC, 2012). Patients usually 
become symptomatic in their twenties or later (Tawil and 
Maarel, 2006). The most common FSHD symptoms are 
progressive weakening of muscles and atrophy of the face, 
shoulder, upper arm and shoulder girdle, and lower 
limbs. These are usually accompanied by an inability to 
flex the foot upward, foot weakness, and an onset of right/
left asymmetry (Tawil et al., 1998; Maarel et al., 2007).
FSHD is considered a relatively benign dystrophy, despite 
the fact that around 20% of patients are eventually con-
fined to a wheelchair (Tawil and Maarel, 2006), and an 
estimated 1% ultimately require breathing assistance 
(Wahl, 2007). Although no effective therapeutic strate-
gies are known to either halt progression or reverse mus-
cle weakness (or atrophy) (Rose and Tawil, 2004), a 
number of actions can provide symptomatic and func-
tional improvement in many patients; the use of assistive 
devices such as braces, standing frames or walkers, and 
physical therapies such as exercises in water, helped by 
psychological support and speech therapy, may help to 
alleviate especially difficult life conditions.

It is believed that FSHD is caused by deletion of a sub-
set of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat units in the subtelom-
ere of chromosome 4q (Maarel et al., 2011), but this

modification needs to occur on a specific chromosomal 
background to cause FSHD. More than 95% of patients 
with clinical FSHD have an associated D4Z4 deletion on 
the 4q35 chromosome (Wahl, 2007). However, a small 
number of kindreds with typical FSHD do not display this 
deletion. Recent advances involve the DUX4 gene, a ret-
rogene sequence within D4Z4 that encodes a double 
homeodomain protein whose exact function is not 
known. FSHD is the first example of a human disease 
associated with the inefficient repression of a retrogene in 
a macrosatellite repeat array (Maarel et al., 2011).
Although the mechanisms responsible for progressive 
muscle weakness remain unknown, the study of this gene 
may offer a therapeutic route (Maarel et al., 2011).

The simultaneous monitoring of expression levels for 
thousands of genes may allow the study of the effects of 
certain treatments, diseases and developmental stages on 
gene expression. In particular, microarray-based gene 
expression analysis based on statistical or ML methods 
can be used to identify differentially expressed genes 
(which act as features, to use ML terminology) by compar-
ing expression in affected and healthy cells or tissues. A 
gene expression data set typically consists of dozens of 
observations and up to tens of thousands of genes. Pre-
dictive model construction and validation in this situation 
is difficult and prone to yield unreliable readings. As a 
result, dimensionality reduction and in particular feature 
subset selection (FSS) techniques may be very useful, as 
a way to reduce the problem complexity and facilitate 
expert medical diagnosis. In a practical medical context, 
the interpretability of the obtained solutions is also of 
paramount importance, limiting the applicability of meth-
ods such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which 
involves weighted combinations of many genes instead of 
individual genes. Moreover, data visualization in a low-
dimensional representation space may become extremely 
important, as it helps doctors to gain insights into this 
medical area. Such contributions are scarce for the case 
of FSHD-associated gene expression data, probably due to 
a relative research bias toward more common diseases.
This scenario is aggravated by the absence of publicly 
available scientific data, outside purely medical domains, 
although the situation is slowly changing. In contrast, 
there is now a vast body of available microarray gene 
expression data sets focused on cancer diseases.

The development of simple predictive models that can 
distinguish between healthy and FSHD samples with 
minimal error recognition rate is thus a clear research 
goal. This study explores a specific FSHD data set from 
a ML perspective. First, a dimensionality reduction 
stage is carried out. A feature selection algorithm is 
used as the main engine to select genes promoting the 
highest possible classification capacity to distinguish 
between healthy and FSHD samples. The combination 
of feature selection and classification aims at obtaining 

simple models (in terms of low numbers of genes) capable 
of good generalization. A prior selection stage is carried 
out, using a well-known statistical test, to filter out genes 
with negligible discrimination ability. To avoid selection 
biases, the full selection process is embedded into an 
outer Monte Carlo validation process.

We report experimental results supporting the practi-
cal advantage of combining robust feature selection and 
classification in the analyzed FSHD data set. The 
described method was able to unveil a consistent small 
group of genes that yields high mean test set accuracies.
The practical utility of these results is reinforced by low-
dimensional visualizations and supported by current bio-
logical evidence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data set The database used in this study was obtained 
from the EMBL-EBI repository of the European 
Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, 2014). Specifically, 
Experiment E-GEOD-3307 uses the Affymetrix GeneChip 
Human Genome HG-133A and HG-U133B designs to ana-
lyze a group of muscle diseases for comparative gene 
expression profiling purposes. A total of 121 muscle 
samples of 11 muscle pathologies (plus several healthy 
samples) constitute the data: acute quadriplegic myopa-
thy, juvenile dermatomyositis, amyotrophic lateral sclero-
sis, spastic paraplegia, fascioscapulohumeral muscular 
dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Becker 
muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cal-
pain 3, dysferlin, and the FKRP using U133A and U133B 
array design. These are diseases with an extremely low 
incidence rate in the general population. Facioscapu-
lohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD, HG-133A ver-
sion), the targeted group in this work, consists of 14 
people showing FSHD (hereafter referred to as FSHD 
samples or cases) and 18 people not showing FSHD 
(healthy cases), described by p = 22,283 genes or features.

Feature selection algorithm The first action taken 
was to filter out those genes that do not possess a mini-
mum discriminative capacity. In particular, we use 
Welch’s t-test (Pan, 2002) computed as follows:

where the j subscript runs through all genes G = {g1, . . . ,
gp};  and  denote sample mean and variance of a gene, 
and N is the sample size; the symbols + and − indicate 
positive (healthy) and negative (FSHD) cases, 
respectively. For each gj, a large and positive (resp. neg-
ative) tj score indicates high expression in favor of the pos-
itive (resp. negative) class. Hence, absolute values |tj|

are considered and sorted in descending order to identify 
the top k genes; k = 100 in our study.

A simple yet very effective forward-backward FSS algo-
rithm is then fed with the k genes previously selected.
This algorithm follows the wrapper idea, i.e., the feature 
selection algorithm uses a learner as a subroutine in the 
search for good subsets (John et al., 1994). In this gen-
eral setting, when features are added to or removed from 
the current subset, the algorithm resorts to some perfor-
mance measure; for example, in classification problems, it 
may be the resampled recognition rate.

Wrappers are often criticized because they are compu-
tationally very expensive (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003).
Moreover, feature selection is badly affected by small 
sample sizes, producing overly optimistic results and 
introducing an excess of variance in the readings. This 
is aggravated in the presence of very sophisticated search 
algorithms (Reunanen, 2003). On the other hand, 
greedy search strategies seem to be particularly compu-
tationally advantageous and may alleviate the problem of 
overfitting (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003). Nevertheless, 
traditional pure forward selection and backward elimina-
tion search algorithms are ill-advised in that they cannot 
rectify their decisions and may ultimately deliver poor 
solutions in terms of both quality and size.

Therefore, a forward-backward search is developed, 
looking for an improvement in performance of the chosen 
performance measure. The algorithm is presented as 
Algorithm 1. Given a performance measure L to be 
maximized (in this case, the resampled performance eval-
uation of a classifier), the algorithm searches the space of 
subsets by adding/removing features in an interleaved 
hill-climbing fashion. Specifically, in every iteration of 
the outer loop, one feature is added to the current best 
solution BEST, as long as this step improves on current 
performance Lcur. A variable number of feature removal 
steps is then carried out as long as the same condition of 
improved performance is met, a scheme oriented to favor 
solutions with low numbers of features. The outer iter-
ation also ends when no further improvement is observed.
The strategy generalizes pure forward or pure backward 
search, and bears some resemblance to floating search 
methods (Pudil et al., 1994); however, it has a far lower 
computational cost given that discarded features are not 
considered again for another inclusion round. Note also 
that, unlike floating methods, current subset performance 
is not compared specifically against the best performance 
achieved for the same size of the current subset. It 
should be mentioned that the algorithm itself needs no 
parameter specification, although the chosen performance 
measure L may.

Among the possible choices for two-class classifiers, we 
selected the linear discriminant classifier and the linear 
support vector machine. These methods are attractive 
because they are fast, because their limited complexity 

may be a solid guard against overfitting the data, and 
because they need no parameter tuning (except the cost 
in the SVM; see section 2.4). Moreover, the number of 
coefficients they estimate does not grow with dimension, 
which is very important in high-dimensional situations 
like the present one. Finally, their linear character 
allows the use of the obtained weights as a measure of the 
importance of the respective genes.

Linear discriminant analysis Linear discriminant 
analysis or LDC (Duda et al., 2001) is a widely used para-
metric method which assumes that the class distributions 
are multivariate Gaussians. In LDC, all c classes are 
assumed to have the same covariance matrix. The QDC

quadratic version does not make such an assumption; 
however, the number of parameters to be estimated from 
the data available for each class is much higher, entailing 
lower statistical significance. In both methods, classifi-
cation is achieved by assigning an example to that class 
ωk for which the posterior probability P (ωk|x) is greater 
or, equivalently, for which ln {P (wk)p(x|wk)} is greater.
In LDC, we assume that all class-conditional distribu-
tions p(x|wk) have the same covariance matrix Σ, to 
obtain a linear discriminant function dk (·) for class wk 
expressed as:

In practice, only an i.i.d. data sample S is available.
When means, covariances and priors for every class are 
not available, maximum-likelihood estimates on S can be 
used, although in this case the Bayesian optimality prop-
erties are no longer valid. Letting Sk ⊂ S be the subset 
of observations known to belong to class wk, unbiased esti-
mates for the class priors and vector means  can be 
obtained in the usual way, whereas a pooled covariance 
matrix is used (Ripley, 1996):

Linear support vector machines The support vector 
machine (SVM) is a machine learning method solidly 
based on statistical learning theory (Vapnik, 1998). Intu-
itively, given a set of examples labeled into one of two 
classes, the linear SVM finds their optimal linear separa-
tion: this is the hyperplane that maximizes the minimum 
orthogonal distance to a point of either class (this distance 
is called the margin of the separation).

Consider an i.i.d. data sample S = {x1, . . . , xN } of train-
ing patterns (in p dimensions), labeled in c = 2 classes w1, 
w2 by z1, . . . , zN , with zi = +1 if xi ∈ w1 and zi = −1 if xi ∈                       
w2. The optimal separating hyperplane can be found as 
the solution of the 1-norm quadratic programming (QP) 
problem:

The solution to this optimization problem corresponds 
to the saddle point of its associated Lagrangian:

where α i, μi ≥ 0 for i = 1, ..., N , and C is called the cost 
or complexity parameter, which allows the end-user to 
control the trade-off between margin size and 
error. Once this QP problem is solved, the solution vec-
tor w* can be expressed as a linear expansion over the 
support vectors:

(2)

the support vectors being those xi ∈ S for which  > 0.

Experimental setup As mentioned above, the perfor-
mance measure L to be maximized in Algorithm 1 is the 
accuracy rate of a classifier. Due to the low number of 
observations and the resampling, ties among the perfor-
mance measure can happen easily. How these ties are 
broken is non-trivial and should be addressed specifically 
and explicitly (Zhou and Mao, 2006). In the literature, 
univariate methods such as entropy-based measures (Bell 
and Wang, 2000; Furlanello et al., 2003), the Fisher F-test 
or some other statistical test may have been preferred for 
their simplicity (Liu and Motoda, 1998; Liu et al., 2002).
Instead, a multivariate feature ranking method seems 
more adequate to measure the relevance of a group of tied 
genes. In this work, tie-breaking strategies are devel-
oped taking advantage of the used performance function 
L in the main selection process. Specifically, for LDC the 
Fisher discriminant ratio Fs, included in Algorithm 2, 
can be computed by projecting the data using only the 
current subset BEST plus a tied gene gj onto Fisher’s lin-
ear discriminant1 and then computing the optimal sepa-
rability Fisher ratio in the projected space (Duda et al., 
2001; Sotoca et al., 2005) as:

where Gj = BEST ∪ {gj} and SW , m stand for the mean and 
within-class scatter matrix of the data using the genes in 
Gj only. It can be verified that Fs(Gj ) is maximized when 
w = S−1(m+ − m−) (Fukunaga, 1990). Among the tied 
genes gj , the one maximizing Fs(Gj ) will be selected; this 
tie-breaking procedure is incorporated into the main FSS 
algorithm and used every time an evaluation of the per-
formance measure may incur one or more ties (lines 2, 7 
and 17 in Algorithm 1).

For the SVM, the tie-breaking method is given by the 
weight vector of the optimal separability maximum- mar-
gin solution as given by eq. (2) (Hamel, 2009). Indeed,

the numbers (w*)2 in eq. (2) have been used as a surrogate 
for the relevance of the j-th gene since the pioneering 
work of Guyon et al. (2002). Notice, however, that our 
approach is different in that predictive performance is the 
main criterion for optimization; only in case of ties is the 
magnitude of the SVM weight vector being used. This is 
because the relation between this magnitude and final 
performance is indirect. Two linear SVMs are used, one 
with C = 1 and another with C = 20 (see section 2.4).

Model assessment and selection Feature selection 
can often be considered part of model selection and 
become an important step, especially when the number of 
features clearly surpasses the number of observations.
Performing model selection in the joint space of features 
and parameters in this situation can be a delicate task 
that entails a very high risk of overfitting. Many 
authors often perform variable selection only once using 
part or all of the available data, i.e., through a training 
set, delivering a final subset. By definition, a feature 
selection process must invariably render more than one 
subset, as a consequence of the random partitions in the 
validation process, among other factors. How to derive a 
single solution from a group of solutions (i.e., subsets) is 
a poorly addressed computational problem. Stability 
analysis for the outcome of feature selection is an incipi-
ent field, and there is no consensus yet on how to derive 
a single solution (Kalousis et al., 2007).

To avoid selection biases, the full selection process is 
embedded into an outer Monte Carlo resampling loop, in 
which the data set is repeatedly split into training and 
test sets, presented in Algorithm 3. The modeling pro-
cess (both FSS and classification) is performed in each 
training part; the best model is then evaluated in the cor-
responding test parts, leading to a more robust estimation 
(Boulesteix, 2007).

A further advantage is the obtained support for those 
genes which consistently appear in selected subsets in 
every outer run. In this paper the splitting proportion 
was P = 2/3 and the process was repeated B = 100 times; 
note that the FBGS method refers to Algorithm 1.

Comparison to other methods The proposed method 
is compared to a filter strategy, using Welch’s t-test as sug-
gested in Pan (2002), and to a well-known information-

theoretic method, the minimum redundancy-maximum 
relevance (mRmR) criterion (Ding and Peng, 2005). For 
the former, eq. (1) is used to select the top ten genes. The 
mRmR measure defines both relevance and redundancy 
of genes using mutual information. Let G be a subset of 
features (e.g., genes) to be evaluated. The ‘minimum-
redundancy’ condition is given by:

(3)

where gi and gj represent two genes. This expression 
tries to select all genes that are not correlated with each 
other, eliminating unnecessary genes whose information 
could be explained by others. On the other hand, to mea-
sure the discriminative power of genes with respect to the 
class variable C (‘maximum-relevance’), the following 
expression is used:

(4)

Genes (features) are incrementally selected in order to 
optimize both (3) and (4) at the same time; in particular, 
given a set of already selected genes Gk, one needs to 
select g ∈ G ¥ Gk as

(5)

These two methods are executed in the same conditions 
as Algorithm 1 with respect to the resampling partitions 
and the three classifiers used.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

distribution of the top consistently selected genes in the

cant fraction of the final subsets: for example, using LDC, 
the HOXC10 gene belongs to 35% of the selections. Table 
1 summarizes these findings and gives details of the 
genes.

Tables 2, 3 and 4 show test set accuracy distributional 
statistics for the three FSS methods. Focusing first on 
the results achieved by the proposed method (Algorithm 
1) in Table 2, it is seen that, on average, the three classi-
fiers perform similarly: around 91% mean accuracy and 
92% median accuracy. However, in the case of the two 
SVMs, the standard errors are nearly four times smaller, 
indicating a greater stability and confidence around their 
means. Note also that in all cases the distributions have 
a slightly negative skew, since the medians are larger 
than the means.

The corresponding results using Welch’s t-test are 

shown in Table 3. On average, and for all three classifi-
ers, performance is 2% worse, both in mean and median, 
and the standard errors are much larger, showing a more 
unstable result. The results using the mRmR criterion 
are shown in Table 4. Although the overall results are, 
as one would expect, better than those using a univariate 
test, they are still worse than those obtained by the FBGS

method, in terms of both average prediction error and sta-
bility.

To better compare average performances, we perform a 
ROC analysis, a technique widely applied in many fields 
of medical research and clinical practice. A ROC curve 
displays the relationship between the proportion of true 
positives (‘sensitivity’) and false positives (‘1-specificity’) 

classifications, resulting from each possible decision 
threshold in a two-class classification task (Parodi et al., 
2003). Figure 2 depicts the ROC curves for all three 
methods overlayed. It is seen that the curve correspond-
ing to the four genes model shows better sensitivities 
(only marginally, but consistently) for all possible false 
positive rates. The AUC values are as follows: four 
genes model (AUC = 0.9583), Welch’s ten genes (AUC = 
0.9444), and mRmR (AUC = 0.9405).

ized gene expression levels of the top four genes (see

Table 1). The symbols + and − indicate positive (healthy) 
and negative (FSHD) cases, respectively. The CKAP4 
and FEZ2 genes clearly show an up-regulation in most of 
the FSHD cases, while LHB and HOXC10 show a clear 
down-regulation in expression. It is also seen that, con-
sidering only these four genes, two well-defined clusters 
or branches of cases are identified. Remarkably, this 
result matches the class labels of the data set.

Scatter plots of the top four genes are given in Fig. 

4. The most frequently selected genes define well-sepa-
rated clusters of FSHD and healthy samples. In order to 
have a graphical representation of the four genes 
together, we use a visualization method based on the 
decomposition of the scatter matrix with the property of 
maximizing the separation between the projections of 
data. Being a linear method, it is easier to use in real 
scenarios that might require an intuitive representation 
of results (Lisboa et al., 2008). The result of such visu-

alization is illustrated in Fig. 5. This scatter plot is the 
two-dimensional projection of the two classes onto the 
first two eigenvectors of the scatter matrix as coordinate 
system, using as data the top four genes only.

Biological evidence In this section, two kinds of 
knowledge about the selected group of four genes are com-
piled and reported. First, scientific findings in the liter-
ature about the genes and their primary functions in 
cellular processes are summarized; due to space reasons, 
this is an abbreviated compendium of information found 
in major specialized sites. Next, protein-protein associa-
tion networks (PPANs) are rendered by means of the 
STRING (search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/
proteins) database and software (Mering et al., 2005; 
Szklarczyk et al., 2011).

HOXC10. HOXC10 (homeobox C10) is one of several 
homeobox HOXC genes located in a cluster on chromo-
some 12, encoding a highly conserved family of transcrip-
tion factors playing an important role in morphogenesis 
in all multicellular organisms. The protein level is con-
trolled during cell differentiation and proliferation, which 
may indicate that this protein has a role in origin activa-
tion (Gene, HOXC10, 2015). Isolating HOXC10 using a 
yeast one-hybrid system, Gabellini et al. (2003) concluded 
that HOXC10 is a homeoprotein with the potential to 
influence mitotic progression, which might provide a link 
between developmental regulation and cell cycle control.

CKAP4. CKAP4 is cytoskeleton-associated protein 
4. The role of p63 (CKAP4) in binding of surfactant pro-
tein-A (SP-A) to type II pneumocytes has been assessed 
(Bates et al., 2008). Also, Rufini et al. (2011) propose a 
biological role of p63-GM1 interaction in regulation of p63 
during epidermal differentiation.

FEZ2. The function of FEZ2 (fasciculation and elonga-
tion protein zeta 2 (zygin II)) remains unknown; however, 
using the yeast two-hybrid system, Alborghetti et al. 

(2011) found that FEZ2 interacts with up to 59 other 
proteins. Most importantly, Maturana et al. (2010) 
found that FEZ1, a FEZ2 homolog, is associated with neu-
ronal development, neuropathologies and viral infection.

LHB. The LHB (luteinizing hormone beta polypeptide) 
gene is a member of the glycoprotein hormone beta chain 
family and encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hor-
mone (LH) (Gene, LHB, 2015). Luteinizing hormones 
play an essential role in normal pubertal development 
and reproductive function in humans (Themmen and 
Huhtaniemi, 2000).

Protein-protein association networks The STRING 
platform integrates known functional associations 
between proteins, either by direct physical binding or by 
participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular 
process. The associations are obtained from statistical 
analysis of co-occurrence in documents, physical interac-
tion databases and curated biological pathway databases.
These are then calibrated against previous knowledge, 
using the manually curated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway maps (Kanehisa et al., 
2014).

To this end, STRING uses two strategies: the first 
(‘COG–mode’) is based on externally provided orthology 
assignments and transfers interactions in an all-or-
nothing fashion, while the second (‘protein mode’) uses 
quantitative sequence similarity searches and often dis-
tributes a given interaction partly among various pairs of 
target organism proteins (Mering et al., 2005). A final 
combined score S between proteins pairs is then com-
puted between any two proteins. This score is often 
higher than the individual sub-scores, expressing larger 
confidence when an association is supported by several 
types of evidence. It is calculated under the (tenable) 
assumption of independence for the different sources 
(Mering et al., 2005):

(6)

There exist several examples about the use of PPANs 
generated by STRING software for the exploration of spe-
cific biological conditions. Bhutani et al. (2015) investi-
gated the structural and dynamic features of two enzymes 
encoded by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using molecular 
3D modeling to simulate the interactions. The STRING 
software was used as a tool to confirm the results. Other 
statistical tools were used in the analysis, such as Clus-
tering and PCA, the latter to reveal atomic motion fluc-
tuations in both enzymes.

Olsen et al. (2014) examined tumor antigens as poten-
tial biomarkers for breast cancer using genomics and pro-
teomics data. Normal vs. invasive ductal carcinomas 
tissue samples were analyzed via the Spearman’s rank

correlation measure in order to extract expression levels 
of genes. A group of 30 genes (potential biomarkers), 
atypically expressed at the protein level, were found, 28 
of them being analyzed a posteriori using the STRING 
software, a methodology reminiscent of the one proposed 
in the present paper. Díaz-Beltran et al. (2013) con-
ducted a comparative analysis of several neurological dis-
eases to describe multi-disorder subcomponents of autism 
spectrum disorders. The STRING software was used to 
generate gene networks of each member of autism sibling 
groups in order to find genetic overlaps. The next four 
paragraphs summarize the main findings about the bio-
logical role of the principal protein partners of the 
selected genes’ products according to the scored partners 
as suggested by the STRING software.

HOXC10. Figures 6 (top left) and 7 show the scored 
functional partners and the PPAN for HOXC10, respec-
tively. The top four are TBX4, TBX5, CDC27 and TBX6.
It is believed that these TBX (T-box) gene products are 
transcription factors involved in the regulation of key 

developmental processes; moreover, CDC27 may be 
involved in controlling the timing of mitosis (Gene, CDC27, 
2015). Among the other partners, DUX4L6 may be 
involved with transcriptional regulation for mesoderm dif-
ferentiation and TBX2 very likely plays a role in extremity 
pattern formation. It is notable that the DUX4L6 protein 
appears in this interaction network, because it is already 
known to be related to FSHD (Gene, DUX4L6, 2015).

CKAP4. Two CKAP4 partners, the PLAT and ZDHHC2 
proteins, are strongly related according to STRING (Figs. 
6 (top right) and 8). The most prominent is PLAT, a 
plasminogen activator of tissue that converts plasmino-
gen to plasmin zymogen by hydrolysis, playing an impor-
tant role in remodeling and tissue degradation in cell 
migration (Gene, PLAT, 2015). ZDHHC2 has been pro-
posed as a putative tumor/metastasis suppressor and its 
expression level is decreased in human cancers (Yan et 
al., 2013).

FEZ2. Figures 6 (bottom left) and 9 show the FEZ2 pro-
tein-protein partners, CRIM1 and LZTS1 being the top 

Fig. 6. Computed functional partners and scores for the top four genes’ products (see text for a description).

two. The former may play a role in CNS development 
through interaction with growth factors involved in motor 
neuron differentiation and survival, and possibly in cap-
illary formation and maintenance during angiogenesis; it 
also modulates BMP activity by affecting its processing 
and delivery to the cell surface (Gene, CRIM1, 2015).
The latter (LZTS1) may play a tumor-suppressing role in 
some types of cancer (Onken et al., 2008; Lovat et al., 
2014; Wei et al., 2015).

LHB. This protein shows a strong PPAN association 
with at least six partners (Figs. 6 (bottom right) and 
10). CGA belongs to the four human glycoprotein group, 
together with the luteinizing, follicle-stimulating and thy-
roid-stimulating hormones (GeneCards, 2012). LHCGR 
acts as a receptor for both luteinizing hormone and 
choriogonadotropin. Disorders of male secondary sexual 
character development, including familiar male preco-
cious puberty, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Leydig 
cell adenoma with precocious puberty, and male pseudo-
hermaphroditism with Leydig cell hypoplasia are disor-
ders associated with this gene (Gene, LHCGR, 2015).
POMC stimulates suprarenal glands to liberate cortisol; 
CYP17A1 participates in sexual development during fetal 
life and puberty, and SRD5A2 performs a decisive role at 
sexual differentiation. SRD5A3 transforms testosterone 
to 5–α–dihydrotestosterone; INHBE is an inhibine 
involved in the regulation of a variety of functions such

as gonadal hormone secretion, germinal cell development 
and maturity, erythroid differentiation, insulin secretion, 
nervous cell survival, embryonic axial development or 
bone growth, depending on its subunit composition.
Finally, NUPR1 is a nuclear regulator protein for tran-
scription, promoting cellular growth in a way that helps 
tissues to counter a variety of injuries (Vesper et al., 2006; 

Winters and Moore, 2011).

CONCLUSIONS

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a very rare 
genetic muscle disorder affecting the muscles of the face, 
shoulder blades and upper arms. The genes responsible 
for the disease have not yet been identified; hence, no 
effective therapeutic strategies to suppress or even dimin-
ish their activity are currently possible. It is very likely 
that aberrant gene expression underlies FSHD, and 
therefore the pool of genes that should be looked at ought 
to be widened (Wahl, 2007). To identify possible causal 
gene expression for FSHD, this work uses machine learn-
ing (ML), which is not commonly addressed in health 
informatics.

A specific FSHD data set comprising samples of both 
healthy and FSHD patients has been analyzed with stan-
dard ML methods. There is no precedent in the litera-
ture for addressing this disease with these techniques.
The fact that the FSHD data analyzed in this study are 
scarce and of high dimensionality makes computer-based 
automated classification a difficult undertaking. Most 
importantly, this high dimensionality precludes a 
straightforward interpretation of the obtained results, 
limiting their usability in a practical medical setting. In 
this vein, computational methods should represent low-
complexity and interpretable solutions amenable to fur-
ther analysis by experts. We have thus selected LDC

and two linear SVMs as the target classifiers, embedded 
into a repeated resampling process. A simple feature 
selection strategy coupled with solid criteria for tie-break-
ing among competing genes has yielded gene subsets that 
constitute promising potential biomarkers. Classifica-
tion models trained and tested using these genes offer 
acceptable recognition rates, well above 90% accuracy.
The analysis has revealed the existence of a group of four 
genes that yield a neat discrimination between healthy 
and FSHD samples. This conclusion is supported both 
numerically (mean prediction errors) and graphically 
(dendrogram and low-dimensional projections). The 
reported results should be given careful medical evalua-
tion, because they point in specific directions, but do not 
by themselves entail a medical solution to the disease, a 
situation common to all statistical and ML solutions.
However, when predictive models use very low numbers 
of relevant genes, these genes are likely to be associated 
with the disease, and can be used as a starting point for 
further dedicated study from a biological point of view.

A major goal of exploratory studies of this kind should 
be to gain some understanding of how the variables 
selected by the model fit in relation to prior knowledge 
from the medical domain. The unveiling of triggering 
mechanisms of rare diseases entails the exploration of 
proteins, derived from specific genes, and their partners.
From a functional perspective, this partnership means a 
direct physical binding association or an indirect interac-
tion such as participation in the same metabolic pathway 
or cellular process. Information about the construction 
of these associations is widespread through several 
resources and information technologies. In this paper, 
STRING software was used to generate potentially useful 
information about genes highlighted as promising for 
FSHD by machine learning techniques. The supplied 
PPAN networks of association may then constitute a 
basis for exploring interactions between the FSHD region 
on chromosome 4q and others, as suggested elsewhere 
(Wahl, 2007).
