Abstract. A profiling methodology is introduced for automatic interpretation of
clusters in this paper. This methodology contributes to the characterization of the
resulting classes from a clustering process. Our research aims to find a concordance
between the proposed methodology and the experts’ description of these classes.
In this work the resulting classes from a clustering of a general population sam-
ple based on their diet and physical activity habits are interpreted and compared
with the experts’ description of these classes by using the Class Panel Graphs.
As a novelty, we import techniques from the multivariate analysis into the cluster
interpretation process.

Keywords. Clustering, Post-processing, Interpretation, Cluster Profiling

Introduction

Nowadays, it is known that there is a relationship between nutrients and health but it is
still unknown how this relationship is. In order to study this relationship, several nutri-
tional studies have been performed.

Data included in such studies come from surveys and medical tests. In most of cases
an important number of characteristics are measured. The classical approach is to con-
sider only numerical attributes but this approach is not powerful enough to clearly find
the factors associated to diet.

In this work a methodology including a strong component in cluster interpretation
is proposed and applied to pattern discovery on diet and physical activity habits of a
general population sample. Profiling methodology can contribute to identify standard
nutritional patterns in general population. State of the Art shows an open problem to
get clear interpretation of the discovered patterns that can be really useful in the later
decision making processes (guidelines establishment, dietary recommendations, etc).

How to show the data mining results is an important part in real applications and
specially, when results must be transferred by experts from different disciplines. Thus, a
good characterization and interpretation of the clusters is very important.

In this work, clustering techniques are used to find profiles on diet and physical ac-
tivity habits, and Class Panel Graphs are used to support the interpreting process fol-
lowed by the experts. They are proposed in [1].

Going one step further the performance of several statistical tests is analyzed to
see the degree of concordance with the experts’ observations in order to find objective
procedures to reproduce human interpretations automatically.

The structure of the paper is the following: related work is explained in the next
section. Then, the proposed methodology is explained in section 2. This procedure is
applied over 3 classes resulted from a previous clustering and compared with experts’
description in section 3. Finally, the conclusions of this work are collected in section 4.

1. Related Work

Cluster interpretation has an important role for presenting the results to the experts. The
interpretation of clusters is also found in literature as Cluster Profiling [2].

Assuming that the process identifies different clusters, one could expect that at least
one of the attributes used for the clustering will behave differently in one cluster giving
the distinctive characteristics of the cluster. Therefore, a comparative analysis between
the attributes used in the clustering can be conducted, which provides new insights into
the complexity of the cluster description.

The cluster interpretation is commonly made by examining the cluster centroids,
which are the attribute’ average values of all objects in a certain cluster. In [2] it is stated
that clusters are distinguishable only if certain attributes exhibit significantly different
means in some clusters, at least from a data perspective. This significance can be assessed
by comparing the clusters with independent t-tests samples or ANOVA.

In [3] the attributes involved into the clustering are ranked with logWorth. This index
is based on p-values which are usually assessed with the χ2-Independence Test.

Efforts in cluster interpretation also go in visualizing the conditional distribution of
attributes through the resulting clusters. In [4] displays the cluster means for the stan-
dardized attributes for every group. Besides, Class Panels Graphs are introduced in [5]
as a graphical representation in the form of panel, containing attributes in the columns
and classes in the rows. Conditional distributions of the attributes against the classes
are shown per column. This visualization is interesting to identify specific behaviors of
some attributes in a certain class and thus to understand better the meaning of the classes
[6]. Class Panel Graphs had been successfully used to present the results to the experts
to support a class-conceptualization process, and to assess the profiles associated to the
classes.

In the field of multivariate analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to
find a reduced set of principal components catching the relevant information contained
in the data set. In this field it is common to interpret the principal components to elicit
latent attributes implicitly measured in the data set. Contribution of original attribute to
the principal components is used for this purpose and this is measured by using the an-
gles of the attributes projected over the factorial space, which are directly linked to the
correlation between attributes and principal components. Additionally, [7] introduce a
statistical test (Test-Value) that provides objective criteria to identify the main contribut-
ing attributes to a certain principal component. They are based on the comparison of



means/percentages within the classes with respect to the global sample indicator. Al-
though Test-Value comes from the multivariate analysis field, we think it can help in the
interpretation of clusters as it will be shown along this work.

In this field, we have not found many research works in the literature. Methods or
tools to obtain or help the cluster interpretation seems to be a problem not yet solved.

2. Methodology

The main idea is to find a connection or concordance between the interpretation that a
technician/expert makes by reading Class Panel Graphs and a set of statistical tests ex-
pected to show significances in the same attributes and classes as experts used in inter-
pretation.

After a clustering process, the result is a partition that defines the different clusters
or classes of the individuals. This resulting partition can be used as a new categorical
attribute and therefore, this attribute can be compared against other attributes using sta-
tistical tests. Among all attributes, the active attributes are those used to construct the
clusters and the illustrative ones are those who have not been used to the construction of
these clusters but can participate in the interpretation process to enrich cluster descrip-
tion. In this work, the following tests are assessed to relate them with the experts based
interpretation obtained from direct reading of the Class Panel Graphs:
1. Kruskal-Wallis test for both active and illustrative numerical attributes. Given a nu-
merical attribute X and the partition C, the statistics for the test is given by:

(n−1) ∑
P
c=1 nc(r̄c− r̄)

2

∑
P
c=1 ∑

nc
j=1(rc j− r̄)2

∼ χ2n−1

(1)

where, n is the total number of observations, P is the
number of groups of C, nc is the number of obser-
vations in group c, rc j is the rank of observations j

from group c. r̄c =
∑

nc
j=1 rc j
nc

is the mean of the ranks
assigned to a group c and r̄ = 12 (n+1) is the average
of all the rc j .

Decision rule: Given a risk α ∈ [0,1], p value < α → X and C have some association.
2. χ2-Independence test for both active and illustrative qualitative attributes. Given two
categorical attributes (X & C), the statistic for the test is given by:

CX

∑
x=1

CC

∑
c=1

(nxc− nxncn )
2

nxnc
n

∼ χ2(CX−1)(CC−1)
(2)

where, CX is the number of categories of X , CC is the
number of categories of C, n is the number of obser-
vations, nx is the number of observations with the xth
category of X , nc is the number of observations with
the cth category of C and nxc is the observed number
of observations with the xth category of X and the cth
category of C.

Decision rule: Given a risk α ∈ [0,1], p value < α → X and C have some association.
Generally, the non-significant attributes would not be required for class description.

However, in the application it will be seen how in some cases Kruskal-Wallis and χ2-
Independence test are not sensitive enough, sometimes for a high asymmetry, or too small
classes or other causes. For this reason, a second test is performed: Test-Value, which is
a new strategy in cluster interpretation process.
3. Test-Value for those attributes non-significant in previous tests. Test-Value finds the
relevant numerical attributes for each class by comparing the global mean with the mean



within the class. Similarly, for qualitative attributes, compares the global proportion of
one category with the proportion of this category within the class. Thus, this test allows
finding relevant attributes per each class. To characterize a class with numeric attributes
X , Test-Value is computed by the following statistics:

x̄c− X̄√
(1− ncn )

s2
nc

∼ tnc−1 (3)
where, X̄ is the mean of attribute X , x̄c is the mean of
X within the class c, n is the number of objects in the
total sample, nc is the number of objects in class c and
s is the standard deviation of X .

Similarly, to characterize a category of a qualitative attribute the following statistic is
computed:

nsc
nc
− nsn√

(1− ncn )
ns
n (1−

ns
n )

nc

∼ Z (4)

where, n is the number of objects in the sample, ns is
the number of objects in the sample with the category
s, nc is the number of objects of class c and nsc is the
number of objects in class c with the category s.

In addition, these tests are solved using critical points (critical point < |value|).
Thus, if a significant value is negative then the mean or proportion of the class is lower
than the global one, and if it is positive, it is higher.

This Test-Value test has been finally used for all attributes because it is a good in-
dicator of how the classes behave in the analyzed attribute whereas χ2-Independent test
and Kruskal-Wallis test only assess the global significance of an attribute without giving
precise information on which change(s) is the one having different values (that can be
higher or lower than the other classes). The purpose of using this test is twofold: first,
to address the lack of sensitivity that can have the previous tests for non-significant at-
tributes and second, to add information about the behaviour of the significant attributes.

Summarizing, Test-Value is used to see how the attributes distinguish every single
class from the general trend of the attribute. As previously indicated, this test comes
from multivariate statistical techniques and we introduce it in the clustering interpretation
process for the first time in this work.

3. Experiments and Results

The data used in this work come from a real sample of 90 persons from general popu-
lation in Catalonia participating in a nutritional study. Among other information, habits
have been registered through a diet and physical activity questionnaire.

The subject profiles depending on their diet and physical activity habits before the
nutritional study are searched.

The diet habits are described through 14 categorical attributes; these attributes have
two categories to answer if the person consumes more than certain quantity of certain
food “per day” or “per week” depending on the type of food.

The physical activity is described through 10 numerical attributes; from these at-
tributes, 4 attributes were included in the analysis because the rest contains redundant
information. The level of physical activity is asked as the calories spent ”per week”.



A clustering process was applied over these 18 attributes of diet and physical activ-
ity habits to identify subjects profiles. The data set contains a mixture of categorical and
numerical attributes.A hierarchical clustering with the Wards’ Method [8] and Gower’s
metric [9] have been used to build the clusters. The resulting dendrogram was cut in 3
classes, according to the Calinsky-Harabasz index [10]. This partition has been inter-
preted and validated by technicians/experts by using the Class Panel Graphs [11] as a
support interpretation tool. Tables 6 & 7 show the resulting Class Panel Graphs of the
data against the resulting classes and the resulting interpretation is given below.

Reference experts’ interpretation:
H1 is a group that eats more vegetables but less fresh fruit. Comparing with other

groups, they consume a lower quantity of red meat, less legumes and commercial
bakery. In addition, this group eats more fish than H2. Their exercise is low in
general, but some does from light to hard physical activity.

H2 contains some persons that consume less oil per day. Comparing with other
groups, their consumption of red meat is higher and they use slightly more butter
and takes more gas drinks. They eat less fish and nuts than other groups. This
group is the one which practices less physical activity.

H3 is a group that eats more fresh fruit than other groups. They eat few portions
of red meat and use less butter. This group eats some fish and consumes more
commercial bakery and nuts than the rest of groups. This group practices slightly
more physical activity with a significant proportion of persons doing moderate
physical activity.

In the following, the performance of several statistical tests is assessed to see how
they can recognize the relevant class-characteristics observed by the experts over the
Class Panel Graphs.

Table 1 shows the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test (KW) for numerical attributes
and χ2-Independence test (χ2) for qualitative attributes against the classes. Given a risk
level α , the attributes are considered significant when p value < α . In this work α = 0.1
has been used. Significant attributes are marked with (*) in the table.

These tests can identify the attributes that register important changes among classes.
Significance means that the attributes have a notable different behaviour in at least one
class. Table 3 shows the degree of concordance between attributes used by experts in
their description against significance assessed by statistical test and it can be found a



good approach. However, the drawback of these tests is that given a significant attribute,
the test result itself does not provide details on which class/es is/are behaving differently
than the others. For instance, the attribute fruit is selected as significant, but the test
do not gives indications on which classes contain people consuming more or less fruit.
Multiple comparison techniques are required to assess these issues. This is an expensive
method because a combinatorial number of tests must be performed for every significant
attribute.

As said in section 2, the Test-Value is imported from the multivariate analysis field
to go one step further in the interpretation of classes. For each attribute the Test-Value
of every class is shown in Table ??. It can be seen that most of the attributes which are
not significant for general tests (Kruskal-Wallis and χ2-Independent test) are also not
significant. Only two cases show significance with Test-Value which were not detected
as significant by the general tests: first, the attribute gasDrinks is significant for class H2
and secondly, legume is significant for the class H1.

Expert’ description of class H1 contains references to attributes: vegetables, fresh
fruit, red meat, legumes and commercial bakery. From those, all except legumes where
identified by general χ2- Independence test, but Legumes is also retrieved when Test-
Value is used. In fact, the Class Panel Graph shows a smaller proportion of people eat-
ing frequent legumes than the other classes and experts agree that this attribute has to
be included in the description. Similarly, the Class Panel Graph show a higher propor-
tion of frequent gasDrinks intake for class H2, which was not identified by general χ2-
Independence test but appears as significant with Test-Value.

Table 4 shows better degree of concordance between expert’s criteria.
Table 5 shows a summary of the significant attributes for both global test and Test-

Value. In column ”KW/χ2”, significance is marked with ”*”. Significance in Test-Value
is marked with ”+” when class shows significantly higher values than the average or with
”-” when it shows significantly lower values than the average. From this table 5, it is



possible to observe that all significant attributes for Kruskal-Wallis or χ2-Independence
tests are also significant for at least one Test-Value. Thus, it seems that Test-Value tests are
more expressive than the global tests and in no-cases the global test is significant when
the Test-Value are non-significant. For this reason we intend to test in future application
if this is a general property and Test-Value can be directly used for interpretation and
global tests can be directly skipped.

From the whole description provided by the experts only in one case Test-Value are
not sensitive enough, from the Class Panel Graph H1 is consuming much less redMeat
than H2 but the test is not detecting this fact. Further analysis is required to clarify if
these cases can also be detected with other testing procedures.

4. Conclusions and Future Work

In this work clustering techniques have been used to find profiles in dietary and physi-
cal activity habits of a real sample from a general population in Catalonia. Class Panel
Graphs have been used to interpret the profiles emerging from clustering. With the aim
of contributing to a more efficient interpretation process that can be objectified and auto-
mated in the future.

However from the whole description provided by the experts only in one case Test-
Value are not sensitive enough. From the Class Panel Graph, H1 is consuming much less
redMeat than H2 but the test is not detecting this fact. Further analysis is required to
clarify if these cases can also be detected with other testing procedures.

Statistical tests are introduced as a post-processing of clustering results to retrieve
from clusters the relevant attributes found by the experts.



We have tested how the statistical tests can assist or help the interpretation of the
classes. As a first step classical global tests like χ2-Independence test and Kruskal-Wallis
test were used to identify relevant attributes for the clustering. However, some attributes
retained as important by experts are not assessed as significant by those global tests.
Test-Value has been imported from PCA field and used in the context of clustering, and
it seems to be more sensitive than global tests by approaching better the experts’ inter-
pretation. They are also more expressive and give more precise information on which
attribute behaves differently in which class with clear indication about the sense if this
difference shows higher or lower values than average.

However, it seems that Test-Value is more expressive than the global tests and in
no-cases the global tests are significant when the Test-Value is non-significant. For this
reason, we intend to test in future application if this is a general property and Test-Value
can be directly used for interpretation and global tests can be directly skipped.
