Abstract

Here we study polysemy as a potential learning bias in vocabu-
lary learning in children. We employ a massive set of transcriptions
of conversations between children and adults in English, to analyze
the evolution of mean polysemy in the words produced by children
whose ages range between 10 and 60 months.

Our results show that mean polysemy in children increases over
time in two phases, i.e. a fast growth till the 31st month followed by
a slower tendency towards adult speech. In contrast, no dependency
with time is found in adults. This suggests that children have a pref-
erence for non-polysemous words in their early stages of vocabulary
acquisition. Our hypothesis is twofold: (a) polysemy is a standalone
bias or (b) polysemy is a side-effect of other biases. Interestingly,
the bias for low polysemy described above weakens when controlling
for syntactic category (noun, verb, adjective or adverb). The pattern
of the evolution of polysemy suggests that both hypotheses may ap-
ply to some extent, and that (b) would originate from a combination
of the well-known preference for nouns and the lower polysemy of
nouns with respect to other syntactic categories.

Introduction

Children are exposed to millions of words tokens through an accumulation
of small interactions grounded in context, immersed in a sea of words that they
learn early after their birth [31]. During this process, some words are learned first
instead of others. Many biases have been hypothesized in the literature in order
to explain why some words are learned earlier [32]. For instance, a preference for
(a) basic taxonomic level, i.e. less generic words [27, 39], (b) syntactic category,
e.g. children learn first nouns and later verbs [12, 13], (c) contextual distinctive-
ness in space, time or linguistic environment [31], (d) frequent words [15], (e)
neighbourhood density, i.e. number of words that sound similar to a given word
[37, 38], (f) in-degree of the word in free association norms [19, 18] or (g) mutual
information when associating a new word to a meaning [11].

The interest in vocabulary learning biases goes beyond child language re-
search: it has been hypothesized that early stages of language have left traces of
simple forms of language [3, 22], child language being one example. On the one
hand, word learning biases in children suggest constraints that human language
faced at its very origin [32]. On the other hand, the factors by which these learn-
ing biases are overridden suggest processes by which communication systems
achieve higher linguistic complexity [32].

Children’s language development follows a predictable sequence that tradi-
tionally has led linguists and psychologists to establish some phases, or stages, in
the process of language acquisition [4], with well-known critical periods [23]. At
present, we cannot determine exactly the timing of these critical periods for each



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 2

individual but many studies suggest the existence of a critical period for syntactic
learning approximately between 18 and 36 months of age preceded by a critical
period for the phonemic level prior to 12 months [23, 40].

Here we explore the existence of a key and polyhedral bias of language
acquisition: word polysemy. Polysemy is the capacity of a word to have mul-
tiple meanings (or more than one related sense) and tends to increase as word
frequency increases [43, 29, 8, 17]. Recently, the structure of polysemy has been
proposed to be a consequence of how children approach the task of building a
lexicon with a set of expectations about how words can be used flexibly from
early-developing cognitive biases [35].

We analyze the variation in mean polysemy in children over time with the
help of a massive database that contains the transcriptions of conversations be-
tween children and adults (CHILDES Database). The period of time analyzed
(child age) runs from 10 to 60 months. We use two measures of polysemy: the
total number of meanings of a word according to the WordNet lexical database,
and the number of WordNet meanings of a word that have appeared in an anno-
tated corpus (the SemCor corpus). For further details, see Section Materials and
Section Methods.

We will show that mean polysemy in children presents a pattern which is
significantly different from that of adults. The mean polysemy in adults remains
stable during all the analyzed timespan, whereas that of children starts with a
low value, and increases rapidly to almost converge with the mean polysemy of
adults.

We consider two possible scenarios to explain these results. The potential
preference for non-polysemous words may be:

• a standalone bias. This hypothesis would be consistent with the lower
uncertainty for those words with respect to their meaning, a factor that may re-
duce the cognitive cost of learning them as the cost for the listener would be
smaller [44].

• a side-effect of another bias, for instance, an initial preference for nouns.
Interestingly, we will show that the temporal pattern of polysemy in chil-

dren weakens when controlling for syntactic category. In order to understand the
relationship between polysemy and syntactic category, we have performed two
different analyses, that put together, shed light on the hypotheses above. First,
we have analyzed the variation in the proportion of four major syntactic cate-
gories (noun, verb, adverb and adjective) over the same time period in children
and adults. Our results show, again, that children and adults behave differently:
initially, children tend to choose a larger proportion of nouns and fewer verbs
but by 30 – 33 months these proportions approximate those of adults, which have
remained practically constant when speaking to children of different ages. These
results agree with previous studies on preference by category (see [32] for a re-
view). Second, we have also analyzed the mean polysemy of verbs and nouns,
and the results show that the mean polysemy of nouns is significantly lower than
that of verbs. These two findings suggest that the tendency of polysemy to in-
crease over time may be mirroring, to some extent, a preference for syntactic cat-
egory, in particular children’s preference for nouns [15]. However, the fact that



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 3

the preference for low polysemy words does not disappear completely when con-
trolling for syntactic category, suggests that a standalone bias for low polysemy
cannot be discounted.

Results

Evolution of the Polysemy over Time

We estimate the polysemy of a speaker, e.g., a child, from a continuous
speech sample, which can be seen as a sequence of N word tokens, t1, ..., ti, ...tN .
The mean polysemy of a sample is defined as the mean of the number of mean-
ings of the i-th token according to its part-of-speech i.e. nouns, adjectives, ad-
verbs and verbs (in these samples, only content words are considered). Samples
were obtained from transcripts of recording sessions from the CHILDES database
[24] of speech between children and adults (see Section Materials for further de-
tails).

From this generic definition, we derive two concrete measures of mean pol-
ysemy, depending on how the number of different meanings is calculated for
every token:

• WordNet polysemy, this is the number of synsets (WordNet meanings)
of the word according to the WordNet lexical database.

• SemCor polysemy, this is the number of different WordNet synsets asso-
ciated to a token in the SemCor corpus.

These two measures of polysemy allow one to capture two extremes: the
full potential number of synsets of a word (WordNet polysemy) and the actual
number of synsets that are used in a corpus (SemCor polysemy), the latter being
a more conservative measure of word polysemy motivated by the fact that the
number of synsets of a word overestimates, in general, the number of synsets that
are known to an average speaker of English or the number of synsets to which a
child is exposed.

We analyze the dependency between mean polysemy and time using data
from children involved in longitudinal studies. Besides the children role, three
adult roles were considered as controls: mothers, fathers and investigators (see
Section Methods for further details).

In order to check whether the results are a simple effect of the increase of
the production of speech in children as they grow up, we have selected the first
n tokens (where n = 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 250) for each conversation. n is the
length of the conversation. If a sample does not contain, at least, n tokens, the entire
transcript is discarded. Our method of word selection implies that an increase in
the length of the conversation tends to reduce the number of conversations that
can be included in the analysis. However, a length of 50 tokens yields results
that resemble, qualitatively, the results that are obtained with other lengths of
conversation. Thus, we take a length of 50 tokens as a canonical length.

For every individual speaker we compute the mean polysemy (according to
both WordNet and SemCor polysemies) at each point in time, which is defined
as the age of the individual (in months) in that recording session. Therefore,
we have a collection of pairs ¡time, mean WordNet polysemy¿ and a collection of



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 4

pairs ¡time, mean SemCor polysemy¿ for each individual. We study the evolution
of mean polysemy over time from two perspectives:

• a qualitative analysis: we average the mean polysemy value for all the
individuals that have the same role.

• a quantitative analysis: for each role, we count the number of individ-
uals that show significant (positive or negative) or non-significant correlations
between mean polysemy and age.

The results of the qualitative analysis of the WordNet polysemy are shown
in the left-hand side of Figure 1 and those of SemCor polysemy are shown in
the left-hand side of Figure 2. In both cases, we observe a two-phase (fast-slow)
growth of the mean polysemy, delimited by a breakpoint. In adults, there is no
clear positive nor negative tendency. The breakpoint for mean WordNet poly-
semy is located at 31.6±0.1 months, and for mean SemCor polysemy, at 31.4±0.1
months. We note that this breakpoint is computed on the average curve for all
children (see Subsection Breakpoint Calculation for details on how the breakpoint
is calculated).

The results of the quantitative analysis of the WordNet polysemy can be
seen in the right-hand side of Figure 1, and the raw data in Table 1 (All cate-
gories row). These results confirm those of the qualitative analysis: almost half
of the children (51.8%) show a significant positive correlation (S+), whereas most
adults (91.1% of the mothers, 85.7% of fathers and 86.7% of investigators) show a
non-significant tendency. Notice that that the number of significant positive cor-
relations for children is, significantly high (↑), and the number of non-significant
correlations is significantly low (↓), both according to a binomial test (see Subsec-
tion Binomial tests for further details).

The results of the quantitative analysis of the SemCor polysemy can be seen
in the right-hand side picture of Figure 2, and the raw data in Table 2. In this case,
we can see that the trend is the same as in the case of WordNet polysemy. We can
also see that a remarkably high number of correlations between mean polysemy
and time, are positive and significant in children (51.8%) whereas an overwhelm-
ing majority of these correlations are non-significant in all adult categories (85.7%
for mothers, 92.9% for fathers and 93.3% for investigators). Finally, we note that
the average values for mean polysemy differ depending on the source: an average
polysemy of about 6 synsets is found in adults when the source of the polysemy
is the SemCor corpus, compared to an approximate average of about 10 synsets
when the source is the WordNet database (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).

We have also considered the possibility that these results were a conse-
quence of the dominance of a single morpho-syntactic category over the whole
set of tokens. Therefore, we have controlled for category (part-of-speech): we
have checked whether the observed pattern also holds for individual categories.

We have taken the same amount of tokens from each recording session but
selecting only tokens belonging to one of the four target syntactic categories:
nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Tokens that were not in the target cate-
gory in their context of use, were discarded. This implied that, if a session did
not contain the required number of tokens of the same category, it was discarded.

The results of the qualitative analysis of separate syntactic categories for the

mean WordNet polysemy can be found in Figure 3, and the quantitative analy-
ses are shown in Figure 3 and Table 1. Comparing these results with those in
Figure 1, the tendency for mean polysemy to increase in children seems to blur,
since most children show a non-significant correlation between mean polysemy
and time when single syntactic categories are taken alone. Only nouns (8.9%)
and adverbs (10.7%) exhibit a relevant number of significant positive correlations
(C+), which are in fact significantly high according to a binomial test. However,
these percentages contrast with the percentage of 51.8% when all categories were
considered together.

A similar tendency is observed when we analyze the mean SemCor poly-
semy controlled by category. The qualitative results can be found in Figure 4, and
the quantitative results are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2. Again, the tendency
for mean polysemy to increase in children is not as clear as when all categories
were taken together. However, in this case, it is found that in all categories, the

percentages of positive significant correlations (C+) in children are significantly
high according to a binomial test (8.9% for nouns, 10.7% for verbs, 13% for ad-
jectives 8.9% and for adverbs), but, as in the previous case, they are far from the
results in Figure 2 (51.8%).

As for adults, the results in both cases show no relevant tendency, this is,
in all cases the non-significant correlations form the majority. This is exactly the
same result that was observed when results were not segmented by syntactic
category.

Therefore, the trend that we observed in the first part of our analyses dissi-
pates when syntactic categories are considered separately, but does not disappear
completely. To try and explain this finding, we have studied the evolution of the
use of these categories over time, as well as the relationship between both vari-
ables.

Interaction between polysemy and syntactic category

We have analyzed the evolution of the syntactic categories over time using
the same methodology as in the previous section. In this case, the variable that is



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 10

being analyzed is the percentage of word tokens of a target category over time.
The results of the qualitative analysis (Figure 5) show that the percentage

of nouns decreases over time in children: it starts at 80%, drops to 40% and then,
stabilizes. Verbs exhibit an opposite tendency in children: they start at 10% and
increase their contribution to 40%, and finally they stabilize. In fact, both nouns
and verbs seem to stabilize approximately by the same time point. The break-
point for the percentage of nouns used is located at 30.0 ± 0.1 months and the
breakpoint for the percentage of verbs used is located at 33.0 ± 0.1 months (see
Subsection Breakpoint Calculation).

These results are consistent with a well-known phenomenon: children tend
to learn nouns first and then verbs [32]. As for the remaining categories (ad-
jectives and adverbs), Figure 5 suggests that they remain stable over time. As
looks can be deceiving, stronger conclusions must be explored with the help of
the quantitative analysis.

According to Figure 6, 42.9% of children show a significant negative corre-
lation between the mean percentage of nouns and time, and 60.7% show a signif-
icant positive correlation between the mean percentage of verbs and time, which
confirms our observation of the qualitative results. As for adults, they mostly
show non-significant correlations in all syntactic categories.

for the percentage of nouns in children is 30.0±0.1 months and for the percentage
of verbs in children is 33.0± 0.1 months.

Notice that the mean percentage of nouns and verbs stabilize, in children,
by an age ranging between 30 and 33 months, that matches the time interval in
which children stabilize their mean WordNet and SemCor polysemy (31 months).
This suggests that polysemy and syntactic category could be correlated somehow.

percentage of correlations for this role. The number of conversations used to cal-
culate the correlations for every role appears between parentheses in the legend.
Length of the conversations: 50 tokens.

The analysis of the abundance of each category suggest that the overall ten-
dency of polysemy to increase could be, at least to some extent, a side-effect of
an initial preference for syntactic categories that have low polysemy. For this
reason, we calculate the mean polysemy of the tokens of each syntactic category
separately, regardless of time. We focus on verbs and nouns, as the other two
categories that we have considered (adjectives and adverbs) do not show any rel-
evant tendency, and they represent only a small percentage (less than 20%) of the
total of the yielded tokens.

Table 3 shows the mean polysemy of the words (tokens) that have been pro-
duced for each syntactic category depending on the role of the speaker. In all
roles, verbs have a significantly higher mean polysemy than nouns (a Fisher ran-
domization test gives a p-value < 10−5 in all cases; see Subsection Fisher method
of randomization for further details about the test).

To sum up, our analysis above shows that children exhibit the following
behavior:

1. Approximately between the 30th and 33rd month a breakpoint separates
two stages: one of quick maturation followed by another of gradual convergence
to adult linguistic behavior. The breakpoints are located at the 31st month for
Wordnet and Semcor polysemies, at the 30th month for the percentage of nouns,
and at the 33rd month for the percentage of verbs.

2. Up to the breakpoint, their mean WordNet and SemCor polysemy as well
as their mean percentage of verbs increase while their mean percentage of nouns



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 12

decreases.
3. From the breakpoint onwards, the mean WordNet and SemCor polysemy

as well as the mean percentage of verbs and nouns stabilize and tend to converge
on those of adults.
Beyond children, our analysis shows that

1. Verbs have a significantly higher mean polysemy than nouns in all roles.
2. With respect to children, adults show a rather stable language production

in all analyses over time.
In the next section, we explore the implications of these facts for the origin

of the tendency of mean polysemy to increase over time.

Discussion

In this article we have investigated the polysemy of words as a new po-
tential bias of vocabulary learning. We have shown that the mean polysemy of
words increases over time for children, but this effect is not observed in adults.
Our finding in children is non-trivial because it is missing in adults interacting
with children and thus cannot be attributed to Child Directed Speech [34, 25].

Our finding is also unexpected when considered in the light of principles
of language acquisition and facts from quantitative linguistics: the general bias



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 13

for high frequency [16] and Zipf’s law of meaning distribution, i.e. a positive
correlation between frequency and polysemy that concerns both adult and child
language [17]. The polysemy effect cannot be explained by a frequency bias in a
straightforward fashion since it would imply that children use more polysemous
words first, which would contradict our findings presented here. However, our
findings could be predicted by the law of meaning distribution and the bias for
low frequency that is found across all words but not within specific lexical cate-
gories [15].

A critical observation is that the polysemy effect weakens dramatically (but
does not disappear completely) when controlling for syntactic category (see Fig-
ure 3 and 4). Therefore, we investigated the role that specific categories could
have in the polysemy effect. When not focusing on a specific category, the effect
could be explained through a combination of three facts:

• Children decrease their proportion of nouns while they increase the pro-
portion of verbs over time (recall Figure 5 and also [32]).

• The mean polysemy of verbs is significantly higher than that of nouns
(recall Table 3).

• Nouns and verbs cover the majority of tokens that are produced (recall
Figure 5 and Table 3).

Therefore, we suggest two possible explanations, not necessarily mutually
exclusive, for the increase in word polysemy over time in children:

1. Standalone bias. Children have a preference for less polysemous words,
this is, less ambiguous words. This is supported by Zipf’s view of polysemy as
a cost for the listener [44]. Further support comes from models of Zipf’s law that
define the listener’s effort as the entropy of the meanings of a word, which can
be regarded as a distributional measure of polysemy [20].

2. Side-effect of other biases. When children learn a language, they begin
using more nouns than words from other categories, and, then, they increase the
percentage of verbs that they use in their conversations over time. Since the mean
polysemy of verbs is significantly higher than that of nouns, the mean polysemy
increases because the proportion of verbs increases.

On the one hand, the explanation of a side-effect bias is supported by the
fact that the positive correlation between mean polysemy and time weakens after
controlling for category. In particular, S+ (the number of speakers with a signifi-
cant positive correlation between mean polysemy and time) is only significantly
high for nouns in a minority of children after controlling for category according
to WordNet polysemy (Table 1). On the other hand, the hypothesis of a stan-
dalone bias is supported by the different results seen for SemCor polysemy: S+
reduces substantially after controlling for category but is still significantly high
for all syntactic categories according to SemCor polysemy (Table 2). Therefore,
both explanations could be valid to a certain extent. In fact, an important ques-
tion for future research is whether one explanation could be subsumed by the
other. Indeed, the standalone bias could provide a more parsimonious explana-
tion: if children prefer less polysemous words in general they will prefer nouns
because they are less polysemous. However, we may not be able to reduce all
preferences for nouns to polysemy because many nouns are also attractive for



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 14

their imageability [26]. Besides, we cannot exclude the possibility that the two
explanations above are implications of a different deeper explanation that has
escaped us.

Above we have suggested that the bias for low polysemy could weaken
within specific categories as a results of it being a side-effect of a preference for
nouns. Another reason for the weakening could be a competition with frequency
bias, that is stronger within specific categories [15, 18] and is in conflict with the
low polysemy bias because the law of meaning distribution predicts that words
of low polysemy should have low frequency. Finally, another reason could be
that the stand alone bias applies to only certain speakers. This raises the broader
question of whether our findings and arguments are valid for all kinds of learners.
Interestingly, learners of a second language show an initial tendency for Word-
Net polysemy to increase over time [7]. This is consistent with our results with
L1 learners: as we have shown, children start learning words that are less polyse-
mous, according to two different measures of polysemy (WordNet and SemCor).
This suggests that preference for low polysemy is a bias in the vocabulary acqui-
sition process that affects both L1 and L2 learners similarly. An analogous sug-
gestion was made for the bias by which novel words with many similar sounding
words are learned more quickly [36].

The breakpoint by the age of 30-33 months in the evolution of polysemy and
the percentage of syntactic categories in children coincides in the time-line with
the end of the critical period, by the same age, which is traditionally assigned to
syntactic development [23, 40, 30], and the production of closed-class words [15].
We believe that the relationship between the stabilization of mean polysemy of
children and milestones in the evolution of child language should be the subject
of future research.

Conclusions

We have studied the evolution of the polysemy in children, and have put
forward polysemy as a learning bias in their vocabulary acquisition. Our main
conclusions are:

1. There is a non-trival pattern in the evolution of polysemy over time. Chil-
dren increase their mean polysemy in two phases: an initial phase with a
fast growth of polysemy and a second phase with a slower growth of poly-
semy. In contrast, adults do not show this tendency.

2. This non trivial pattern weakens when the analysis is segmented by syntac-
tic category.

3. Children show a tendency to learn nouns first and then verbs, which is con-
sistent with previous research [15, 13, 12].

4. Verbs have a significantly higher mean polysemy than nouns in all roles:
children and adults.

5. The last two facts could explain the pattern of the evolution of polysemy
over time to some extent.



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 15

6. That role of a standalone bias for low polysemy cannot be discounted.

7. Our findings and [8] suggest that L1 and L2 learners resemble each other in
their dominant biases on polysemy: a preference for low polysemy words
prevails in both kinds of learners.

A deeper understanding of why the bias for low polysemy weakens within
specific categories and how it interacts with frequency is a challenge for future
research. Also, the relationship between the senses that a speaker really knows
about a word and its potential number of synsets should be investigated in detail.

Materials

CHILDES database

The longitudinal studies of child language development were taken from
the CHILDES database [24]. The majority of corpora within this database are
transcripts of conversational interactions among children and adults which occur
at a given point in time, which are referred to as recording sessions throughout
this paper.

The longitudinal studies of child language development from the CHILDES
database [24] that were analyzed are the same as in [2] for English language:
60 target children. In this article we only analyze content words (nouns, verbs,
adjectives and adverbs).

All the corpora of the CHILDES database are freely available at http://
childes.psy.cmu.edu/data (accessed 17 December 2012).

Lexical database WordNet

The polysemy of a word in English was obtained by querying the lexical
database WordNet [28, 10].

WordNet can be seen as a set of synsets and relationships among them. A
synset is the representation of an abstract meaning and is defined as a set of words
having (at least) the meaning that the synset stands for. As an example in Word-
Net, the word book is related (among others) with the synset that represents a
written work or composition that has been published, with the synset that represents
a written version of a play or other dramatic composition; used in preparing for a perfor-
mance or the synset that represents to arrange for and reserve (something for someone
else) in advance. Each pair word-synset contains, as well, the information that cor-
responds to a syntactic category related to those two elements. For instance, the
pair book and the synset a written work or composition that has been published are
related to the category noun, whereas the pair book and synset to arrange for and
reserve (something for someone else) in advance are related to the category verb.

WordNet has 155,287 lemmas and 117,659 synsets (see http://wordnet.
princeton.edu/wordnet/man/wnstats.7WN.html), and contains only
four main syntactic categories: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Words with
other syntactic categories are not present in this database (for instance, the article
the or the preposition for).

WordNet is freely available for download at http://wordnet.
princeton.edu/wordnet/download/. We use WordNet version 3.0, that it
is included in the NLTK platform (Natural Language Toolkit) version 2.0 freely
available at http://www.nltk.org.

SemCor corpus

The Semantic Concordance Package (SemCor) is a corpus composed of 352
texts which are a subset of the English Brown Corpus. All words in the cor-
pus were syntactically tagged using Brill’s part of speech tagger. The semantical
tagging was done manually, mapping all content words to their corresponding
synsets in WordNet.

SemCor contains 676, 546 tokens, 234, 136 of which are sense-tagged. This
yields 23, 341 different tagged lemmas that represent only content words.

We processed SemCor to count the number of differents WordNet meanings
that every pair ¡lemma, syntactic category¿ has in this corpus. All this informa-
tion was saved to be used in the processing of the recording sessions.

Table 4 shows the percentage of CHILDES lemmas that are present in Sem-
Cor corpus. The coverage of SemCor (proportion of SemCor lemmas that appear
in WordNet) for verbs, adjectives and adverbs is above 75%, for nouns it is lower,
between 53,61% and 59,32%.

Methods

TreeTagger

TreeTagger [33] was used to determine the syntactic category and the lemma
of word tokens from transcripts of speech. Essentially, this tool annotates text
with part-of-speech (POS) and lemma information (canonical form). That tool
was chosen because it supports many languages, English among others, which
could facilitate the extension of our studies to other languages as well in the fu-
ture.

As an example of the performance of Treetagger, let us consider the word
book in the sentence He gave the book to his sister. TreeTagger tags book in this
sentence as noun and yields, as well, a lemma or canonical form for that word
(in this case, the lemma of book would be book, and the lemma of gave would be
give).

In English, the POS tags that refer to the main categories are:
• Adjectives: JJ, JJR and JJS.
• Adverbs: RB, RBR and RBS.
• Nouns: NN and NNS.
• Verbs: MD, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ, VD, VDD, VDG, VDN, VDP, VDZ, VH,

VHD, VHG, VHN, VHP, VHZ, VV, VVD, VVG, VVN, VVP and VVZ .

Processing data

For each recording session, we processed the list with all tokens of the tran-
script in the same order that have been produced by a certain speaker. For each
of these tokens, we proceeded as follows:

1. Tagging. Each token in this list was assigned a morpho-syntactic category
tag and a lemma by TreeTagger. Therefore, this list contained now triples ¡token,
syntactic category, lemma¿.

2. Discard unprocessable tokens. We discarded from the previous list those
triples whose tokens have non-ascii chars or are CHILDES special tags (”@”,
”xxx”, ”xx”, ”yyy”, ”yy”, ”www”).

3. Proper noun recognition. We recognized the proper nouns from a list of
proper nouns. Any triple whose token appeared in this list was tagged as proper
noun. This list was compiled with information extracted from different sources
and can be downloaded at http://tinyurl.com/polysemy-ne-txt.

4. Category filtering. From the resulting list in the previous step, we only
selected those triples whose morpho-syntactic category corresponds to a content
word.

5. Polysemy calculation. We used two methods to calculate the polysemy for

http://tinyurl.com/polysemy-ne-txt


THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 18

every ¡token, syntactic category, lemma¿ of the list computed in the previous step:

• WordNet query. WordNet was queried to obtain the number of
synsets related to each triple ¡token, syntactic category, lemma¿ from
the previous list. We first queried WordNet the pair ¡token, syntactic
category¿. If this pair was not found, we queried again WordNet the
pair ¡lemma, syntactic category¿. If this pair was not found, this to-
ken was discarded and not considered for calculations of the WordNet
polysemy.
• SemCor query. The file with the processed information of SemCor

was queried to obtain the number of synsets related to each triple ¡to-
ken, syntactic category, lemma¿ from the previous list. We queried the
pair ¡lemma, syntactic category¿. If this pair was not found, this to-
ken was discarded and not considered for calculations of the SemCor
polysemy.

For instance, in the former example where the token book was tagged to be
a noun, we would only select the 11 synsets yielded by WordNet for the noun
category. If there were no synsets related to ¡book, noun¿ this token would be
discarded.

We also performed some extra controls:
1. A control by conversation length: from the remaining lists that

have passed the previous filters, we selected the first n tokens (where n =
50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 250) for each session. If the sample did not have at least n
tokens then the entire transcript was discarded.

2. A control by morpho-syntactic category: from the remaining list, we
only considered those tokens that belong to a specific morpho-syntactic category:
noun, adjective, verb or adverb. In the study of the specific morpho-syntactic cat-
egory we also controlled for length of conversations: we took the first n tokens
after applying the morpho-syntactic category filter (tokens that do not belong to
the target syntactic category are discarded). As before, if the sample did not have,
at least, n tokens, then, the entire transcript was discarded.

Finally, notice that all the processing steps above imply that the analysis that
is not restricted to a specific morpho-syntactic category defines the polysemy of a
token according to the morpho-syntactic category of the triple. It does not define
the polysemy aggregating the polysemy for all content categories somehow (e.g.,
by summing the polysemy of the token for all content categories). The reason for
our choice is to run the raw analysis in as similar a way as possible to that carried
out when controlling for morphosyntactic category.

Mathematical Computations

The association between mean polysemy and age was measured with a
Spearman rank correlation, ρS(X, Y ), which is a measure of monotonic depen-
dency between a pair of variables [5]. Although the traditional Pearson corre-
lation has been used to investigate the relationship between polysemy and time
in L2 learners [8], Spearman rank correlation has the advantage of being able to
capture non-linear dependencies; the traditional Pearson correlation is simply a



THE POLYSEMY OF THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN LEARN 19

measure of linear dependency [14, 9].
To determine whether a correlation was significant or not, a two-sided cor-

relation test with a significance level of α = 0.05 was used (a correlation is signif-
icant if the p-value does not exceed α).

The smoothing of the plots in Figures 1, 3 and 5 was performed with
the non parametric smoother method lowess implementated in Python in
the library statsmodels (see http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/
devel/generated/statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess.
lowess.html) with parameters frac = 1./3, it = 0.

All participants with less than m∗ time points were excluded from the anal-
yses. m∗ is the minimum number of points that are needed for significance by a
two-sided correlation test between two vectors X and Y . m∗ is the smallest value
of m satisfying the condition [21]

2/(m!) ≤ α, (1)

where α is the significance level. With α = 0.05 then m∗ = 5.

Fisher method of randomization

To assess whether verbs have a higher mean polysemy than another cate-
gory for a given role, we performed a Fisher randomization test [5]. The statistic
used is the absolute value of the difference between the mean polysemy of the
verb tokens and the mean polysemy of the tokens of the other category. The test
checks whether the absolute difference is significantly high. The p-value of the
test was determined by means of a Monte Carlo procedure over 105 randomiza-
tions.

Binomial tests

The ↑ and ↓ arrows in Tables 1 and 2 indicate if a certain number is signifi-
cantly high or significantly low. These arrows were determined with the help of
binomial tests [6, 2]. Suppose that N is the number of individuals with at least m∗

points of time and α is the significance level of that test. Under the null hypothe-
sis,

• C+ and C− follow a binomial distribution with parameters N and 1/2.
• S− and S+ follow approximately a binomial distribution with parameters

N and α/2.
• S? follows approximately a binomial distribution with parameters N and

1− a.

Breakpoint Calculation

A breakpoint in the relationship between time and another variable (e.g.,
mean polysemy) was computed using the R package strucchange [42, 41] assum-
ing that the curves contain a single breakpoint (setting the parameter breaks to
1). This R package implements the algorithm described by [1] for simultaneous
estimation of multiple breakpoints, but in our case we are just looking for one
breakpoint. The breakpoint is the value of the predictor (children’s age or time

in our case) where the error is minimized in a double linear regression fit. In all
cases, we get breakpoints with an error of ±0.1 months according to a confidence
level of 95%.
