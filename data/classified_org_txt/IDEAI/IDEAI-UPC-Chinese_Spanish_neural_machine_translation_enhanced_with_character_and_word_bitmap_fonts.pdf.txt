Abstract Recently, machine translation systems based on neural networks have rea-
ched state-of-the-art results for some pairs of languages (e.g. German-English). In
this paper, we are investigating the performance of neural machine translation in
Chinese-Spanish, which is a challenging language pair.

Given that the meaning of a Chinese word can be related to its graphical repre-
sentation, this work aims to enhance neural machine translation by using as input a
combination of: words or characters and their corresponding bitmap fonts. The fact
of performing the interpretation of every word or character as a bitmap font gener-
ates more informed vectorial representations. Best results are obtained when using
words plus their bitmap fonts obtaining an improvement (over a competitive neural
MT baseline system) of almost 6 BLEU, 5 METEOR points and ranked coherently
better in the human evaluation.

1 Introduction

Chinese-Spanish are two of the most spoken languages in the world with around 955
million native Chinese speakers and 405 million native Spanish speakers 1. We can
imagine that building accurate machine translation (MT) systems in particular for
this pair of languages would have a high impact at the economic and social level.
Although research in MT focuses on achieving algorithms independent of languages
which could apply to any pair of languages, there are features from each language
that are interesting to investigate.

This work is supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economı́a y Competitividad and European Regional
Development Fund, through the postdoctoral senior grant Ramón y Cajal and the contract TEC2015-
69266-P (MINECO/FEDER, UE).

The main contribution of this paper consists on the enhancement of Chinese-
Spanish MT by introducing bitmap fonts. One Chinese word can consist of either
one single character or a sequence of characters. But in either case, the meaning
of a word can be related to its character(s) [Liu et al., 2016]. For example, “ 汽车”
(automobile), ” 卡车” (truck), ” 摩托车” (motocycle) are all kinds of “ 车”(vehicle).

In this paper, we take advantage of this graphical information to feed the MT
system. Although standard statistical MT systems (like hierarchical [Chiang, 2007]
or phrase-based [Koehn et al., 2003]) may be capable of offering multimodal frame-
works [Hitschler et al., 2016], neural MT [Cho et al., 2014a] provides a flexible pipeline
to incorporate different format sources of information. We propose to use bitmap
fonts to initialize the embeddings used in the neural MT system. This initialization
allows to start the embeddings training with a more informative space representation
where similar words (in terms of semantics) are closer to each other.

Our research extends the first neural MT publication on this language pair [Aldón et al., 2016,
Aldón, 2016]. The current paper adds further theoretical and founded motivational
details on the approach, new experiments in a large corpus and further analysis of the
results (including a comparison with a standard phrase-based system and a human
evaluation).

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the related work
in Chinese-Spanish MT and in neural MT. Section 3 briefly reports the baseline neural
MT system. Section 4 explains motivation and details about integrating information
of bitmap fonts in neural MT. Section 5 details the experimental framework by show-
ing corpus statistics and reporting preprocessing techniques. Section 6 and 7 discuss
the automatic and human evaluation results, respectively. Both evaluations show sig-
nificant improvements when using bitmap fonts. Finally, section 8 explains the main
conclusions together with some further work.

2 Related work

In this section, we review work that has been done in MT for Chinese-Spanish and,
also, previous work in neural MT.

2.1 Chinese-Spanish MT

Surprisingly, there are few works in Chinese-Spanish MT despite being two of the
most spoken languages in the world as mentioned in the introduction. Initial works,
[Banchs et al., 2006], face Chinese-Spanish challenge through several pivot techniques
using English. Later, in 2008, there were two tasks organised by the popular IWSLT
evaluation campaign2 (International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation) be-
tween these two languages [Paul, 2008]. The first task was based on a direct trans-
lation for Chinese-Spanish. This second task provided corpus in Chinese-English
and English-Spanish and asked participants to provide Chinese-Spanish translation

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 3

through pivot techniques. The second task obtained better results than direct transla-
tion because of the larger corpus provided.

[Costa-jussà et al., 2012] show a comparison between two types of standard piv-
ots (pseudo corpus and cascade) using English and the direct system. These results
show that the pivot and direct techniques do not differ much in their results (for the
same amount of corpus), but that the technical pivot cascade is slightly better than the
pseudo corpus.

Differently from previous approaches, which were all statistical MT systems,
[Costa-jussà and Centelles, 2016] presents the first rule-based MT system for Chi-
nese to Spanish. Authors describe a hybrid method for constructing this system tak-
ing advantage of available resources such as parallel corpora that are used to extract
dictionaries and lexical and structural transfer rules.

Additionally, to all this research, there are products as Google3 and Bing4 transla-
tors, and a less popular one like the Chispa Android application and web service5, that
can be useful to tourists or traveling between countries, which use these languages
[Centelles et al., 2014].

2.2 Neural MT

Early research on this neural MT can be found on works like [Forcada and Ñeco, 1997,
Castaño and Casacuberta, 1997], which were mainly limited by the computational
power and short data by means of a Recursive Auto-Associative Memory. Recently,
proposed neural MT models used the above explained architecture of encoder-decoders
[Sutskever et al., 2014,Cho et al., 2014b,Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013]. This ar-
chitecture allows for encoding the source text into a fixed-length vector and decod-
ing this fixed-length vector into the target text. To address the long sentence issues,
i.e. mainly caused by encoding the input sentence into a single fixed-lentgh vec-
tor, [Bahdanau et al., 2015] encode the input sentence into a sequence of vectors
and choose a subset of these vectors dynamically when decoding. This frees the
neural translation model from having to keep all source sentence information, re-
gardless of its length, into a fixed-length vector, and to deal better with long sen-
tences. This is the baseline system that we are considering in this work, and which
will be briefly described in Section 3. Works in neural MT have hugely increased in
the last two years. Some research directions are: using character-aware architectures
[Costa-jussà and Fonollosa, 2016,Luong and Manning, 2016], going towards a mul-
tilingual system [Firat et al., 2017], or even using multimodal translation [Elliott et al., 2015].

As mentioned and as far as we are concerned, this paper is the first work for
Chinese-Spanish in neural MT, which extends [Aldón et al., 2016] by providing a
justified motivation for this work, giving a more detailed theoretical description of
the approach, experimenting with a larger corpus and providing further results anal-
ysis (adding a comparison with the standard phrase-based system and a human eval-
uation).

3 Neural MT description

Neural MT uses a neural network approach to compute the conditional probability of
the target sentence given the source sentence [Cho et al., 2014b,Bahdanau et al., 2015].
The approach used in this work [Bahdanau et al., 2015] follows the encoder-decoder
architecture.

First, the encoder reads the source sentence s = (s1, ..sI) and encodes it into a
sequence of hidden states h = (h1, ..hI). Then, the decoder generates a correspond-
ing translation t = t1, ..., tJ based on the encoded sequence of hidden states h. Both
encoder and decoder are jointly trained to maximize the conditional log-probability
of the correct translation.

This baseline autoencoder architecture is improved with a attention-based mech-
anism [Bahdanau et al., 2015,Luong et al., 2015], in which the encoder uses a bi-
directional gated recurrent unit (GRU). This GRU allows for a better performance
with long sentences. The decoder also becomes a GRU and each word tj is predicted
based on a recurrent hidden state, the previously predicted word tj−1, and a context
vector. This context vector is obtained from the weighted sum of the annotations hk,
which in turn, is computed through an alignment model αjk (a feedforward neural
network).

4 Integration of Bitmap Fonts

Fig. 1 Integration of Bitmap Fonts

As mentioned in the introduction, Chinese characters have meaning by them-
selves and similar Chinese words (with one of multiple Chinese characters) can have
similar meaning. In fact, each Chinese character is composed of one or more radicals,



Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 5

which contain the semantic radical (carries the meaning) and the phonetic radical (in-
dicates the pronunciation). Chinese characters with the same semantic radicals have
related meanings. In this work, we do decompose words into characters or logograms,
but not into radicals, which is left for further work.

We enhance the system from previous section 3 to use word bitmap fonts. Like
this, we add further information to the neural MT system. Given that the baseline
representations of word vectors (embeddings) are random (gaussian), we propose to
use bitmap fonts to initialize the embeddings used in the neural MT system. This
initialization starts the embeddings training not randomly but with similar words (in
terms of semantics) closer to each other.

The integration is done in four steps, which are described as follows and depicted
in Figure 1:

Step 1 This step consists of segmenting Chinese words into Chinese characters. This
step is only done when using Chinese characters as minimal unit, but it is not neces-
sary in case of using Chinese words.

Step 2 We extract a dictionary from the corpus of Chinese words (or characters),
which is ordered from high frequency words to low.

Step 3 For each word in the Chinese dictionary extracted from our corpus, we repre-
sent Chinese words (or characters) by means of 2-dimensional bitmap which reflects
the shape of the written words (or characters). Like this, we are converting Chinese
words (or characters) to bitmap fonts. Then we can get the vector of bits representing
the bitmap fonts obtained from each word (or character).

Step 4 The new bitmap font vector becomes the initialization of the embeddings
used in the encoder. In this way, we are providing more information to the system.
See the integration of this new encoding in the system in step 4 from Figure 1, note
that the figure is showing a simplified scheme of the neural network system pro-
posed by [Bahdanau et al., 2015] which is mainly based on a encoder-decoder with
the attention-based mechanism. For further simplification, the Figure does not show
the attention-based mechanism.

5 Experimental Framework

In this section, we describe the data used for experimentation together with the cor-
responding preprocessing. In addition, we detail the neural MT parameters chosen.

5.1 Data and Preprocessing

One of the main contributions of this work is using the neural MT approach for the
Chinese-Spanish language pair. In the last years, there has appeared more and more
resources for this language pair available in [Ziemski et al., 2016a] or from TAUS

corporation6. Therefore, differently from previous works on this pair of languages,
we can test our approach in a large set.

The large training corpus is composed of the UN corpus, the TAUS corpus, the
Bible corpus [Chew et al., 2006] and the BTEC (Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus)
[Takezawa, 2006]. The TAUS corpus is around 2,890,000 sentences, the Bible corpus
about 30,000 sentences and the BTEC corpus about 20,000 sentences.

Corpus statistics are shown in Table 1. Statistics for Chinese are shown both with
word and character segmentations. In the case of word segmentation, the size of the
vocabulary is similar to the target vocabulary, while in the case of using Chinese
characters, we have a much lower vocabulary. Development is taken from UN corpus.
We use two different test sets corresponding to two different corpus: UN and BTEC.

Corpus preprocessing consisted in tokenization, filtering empty sentences and
longer than 50 words, Chinese segmentation by means of the ZhSeg [Dyer, 2016],
Spanish lowercasing, filtering pairs of sentences with more than 10% of non-Chinese
characters in the Chinese side and more than 10% of non-Spanish characters in the
Spanish side.

5.2 System Parameters

The neural MT system was built using the software available in github7. We used
the following settings. Regarding vocabulary limitation, we used a vocabulary size
of 90,000 in Spanish and in Chinese when using words, and we reduced the Chinese
vocabulary to 38,000 when using characters. We replaced out-of-vocabulary words
(UNKs) using the standard methodology [Jean et al., 2015]: we used the word-to-
word translation model learned with ’fast-align’ [Dyer et al., 2013] or, if not avail-
able, the aligned source word (given the different alphabets we only used the source
word when it was not a Chinese word or character).

Fig. 2 Example of Generation of Bitmap.

Networks have an embedding of 510 when using words and of 529 when using
characters. These embeddings are inspired on previous work [Bahdanau et al., 2015]
and adapted to sizes from bitmap fonts: 10 × 51 in the case of words (rectangular
bitmap font) and 23 × 23 in the case of characters (square bitmap font). Other sizes
(larger and smaller) from bitmap fonts were experimented with worse results than
previous sizes. Embeddings are kept the same for both corpus sizes. To transform
each element from the dictionary into a bitmap font, we installed a special package,
which is used by the python library cairo, see Figure 2 for an example. Note that the
generation of bitmaps is hybrid, meaning that when there is no bitmap font available
(i.e. it happens for special symbols), we use a random vector. At the end, we use
random vectors for less than 5% of the words.

Additionally, we have built a standard phrase-based MT system to contrast results.
The phrase-based MT system has been build using standard Moses [Koehn et al., 2007]
trained using default parameters, which include: grow-diag-final word alignment sym-
metrization, lexicalized reordering, relative frequencies (conditional and posterior
probabilities) with phrase discounting, lexical weights, phrase bonus, accepting phrases
up to length 10, 5-gram language model with kneser-ney smoothing, word bonus and
MERT optimisation.

6 Automatic Evaluation

Table 2 shows the results in terms of BLEU [Papineni et al., 2002] and METEOR
[Lavie and Denkowski, 2009]. Results show that using bitmap fonts as initialization
is much better than using a random initialization, since much more information is

provided to the neural system. The improvement holds for both when using single
Chinese characters as minimal translation units or using Chinese words.

Words +Bitmap 27.48 46.48 12.13 29.62
Phrase-based 40.14 56.98 24.44 40.63

The improvement is large for both character bitmap fonts: +2.6 BLEU points, for
the UN test, and +3.4 BLEU points for the BTEC test set; and word bitmap fonts:
almost +5.7 BLEU points for both test sets). In any case, it is observed that it is
better to use words than characters as translation units. METEOR results are always
coherent with BLEU results.

Although, results for this particular dataset and language pair do not reach the
phrase-based MT system, the goal of the paper is to show that the integration of
bitmap fonts enhances the neural MT system. Our approach is helping neural MT
towards achieving state-of-the-art results confirming its promising results 8.

7 Human Evaluation and Translation Output Analysis

We compared using human evaluation the two best systems on the large dataset and
only for the UN test corpus: the baseline system with words as minimal translation
units (21.79 BLEU) and the same system with the bitmap fonts initialization (27.48
BLEU).

Figure 3 shows the framework on which we did the human evaluation. We asked
four independent evaluators to compare 97 random sentences from the test set men-
tioning which translation output was better. Ties were allowed.

Results for each of the four evaluators are shown on Table 3. Note that all eval-
uators ranked the enhanced system with bitmap fonts as better. In average, almost
51% of the times the system with the bitmap fonts integrated was better than the
baseline, 17% of the times was equal, and only 32% of the time it was worst. In
order to confirm the quality of the performed human evaluation, we computed the
inter-annotation agreement using Fleiss Kappa [Fleiss, 1971] and resulted into 0.21,
which is considered fair agreement.

We did some manual analysis to see what kind of errors the integration of bitmap
fonts solved in the translation. Table 4 shows some examples of the kind of improve-
ments that the neural MT system with the new initialization is capable of. Examples

show how it improves the adequacy and fluency of the translations in general. Ex-
ample 1 and 5 show that when using bitmap fonts initialization there are less content
words/information missing in the translation and, as a consequence, the translation
tends to be more fluent. Example 2 and 4 show a more adequate translation of source
words. Example 3, in addition to chosing a more adequate verb (apruebe), it also
shows less repetition of translated words, which is a tendency of the neural MT sys-
tem.

8 Conclusions

This paper shows first experiments in using the neural MT approach for the Chinese-
Spanish language pair. Basically, taking advantage of the graphical representation of
the Chinese alphabet, we use bitmap fonts of the Chinese words (either words them-
selves or characters) to initialize the neural MT system. Our technique represents
Chinese minimal translation units (words or characters) by means of 2-dimensional
bitmap which reflects the shape of the written word. Like this, we are converting Chi-
nese units into bitmap fonts. Then we get the vector of bits representing the bitmap

fonts. This information improves the standard initialization of the word vectors (em-
beddings).

This extension to the standard neural MT system presented by [Bahdanau et al., 2015]
shows almost 6 point BLEU improvement. Human evaluation shows that our system
is in average 51% better than the baseline, 17% equal to it and only 31% worse than
it.

As further work, we plan to use only the semantic radical of the logogram to ini-
tialize embeddings; use the character-based neural MT system [Luong and Manning, 2016,
Costa-jussà and Fonollosa, 2016] and use larger datasets, recently published [Ziemski et al., 2016b].
