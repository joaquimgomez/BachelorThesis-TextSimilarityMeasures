ABSTRACT

The concept mapping methodology aims to respond to the non trivial task of conceptualising abstract

thoughts by means of a focus group composed by experts from the studied domain. The approach

defines a set of general steps that allow experts to lead the generation of ideas, group the ideas in

a conceptual map of interrelated concepts using clustering multidimensional scaling and clustering

techniques, analysing the quality of the conceptual maps and deciding on a final interpretation. In this

sense, this final decision is not trivial because clustering techniques provide a set of potentially con-

ceptual maps so experts must select the one that fits best according to their opinion. For this reason, we

present the global index of consensus as an indicator for filtering the most suitable clustering solutions

using qualitative reasoning. It promotes the consensus of experts opinions and ensures objectivity in

the final interpretation. The index outperforms three of the most well-known clustering validation in-

dexes in a case study focused on the meaning of excellence in hospitality industry. This work presents

the global index of consensus as an indicator for filtering the most suitable clustering solutions using

qualitative reasoning that promotes the consensus of experts’ opinions, which is one of the key aspects

in the concept mapping methodology. The index outperforms three of the most well-known clustering

validation indexes in a case study focused on the meaning of excellence in hospitality.

1. Introduction

The concept mapping methodology aims to respond the chal-

lenge of guiding a group of experts in the objective representa-

tion of thoughts, ideas or abstract concepts based on promot-

ing their agreement regarding what they consider more relevant

in consensus (Trochim, 1989; Bigné et al., 2002). Thus, this

method is used to offer clarity and develop a model or specify

a conceptual framework and it has been successfully applied

in education, social research and management science fields to

create conceptual frameworks based on specific aspects (Nabitz

et al., 2001). The methodology defines a set of general steps us-

ing qualitative and quantitative data to determine a conceptual

map of interrelated concepts (Rosas and Camphausen, 2007).

Giving a specific topic study through a set question, a focus

group composed of experts in this domain generate ideas re-

lated to this topic using brainstorming. Next, the focus group

have to group and weight the ideas in categories based on their

point of view. This information is converted into knowledge

using data mining techniques (Witten and Frank, 2011), which

are applied to identify shared patterns between the opinion of

the experts using multidimensional scaling and clustering tech-

niques. It is important to highlight that clustering techniques

often return more than one possible solution where each one

represents a clustering configuration that groups elements in a

specific way. Therefore, the last step is to validate and select

the most suitable clustering configuration based on the criteria

of the group of experts. Although one of the main benefits of

this approach is its flexibility and adaptability, the amount of

data that has to be analysed may hinder the tasks of experts be-

cause the selection of the best clustering configuration is non

trivial and they have to review all the results following the sub-



2

jective premise ”does it make sense to you?” Trochim (1989),

which may compromise the objectivity of the approach.

This paper presents the global index of consensus (GIc) to

help experts in selecting the most suitable clustering configura-

tion based on two of the main premises of the concept mapping

methodology: objectivity and consensus. Thus, the knowledge

discovery process is drastically improved because experts have

to focus only in useful configurations characterised for contain-

ing ideas in which the experts agree are similar and with the

same relevance. This index is based on qualitative reasoning

techniques and the concept of entropy (Shannon, 1948). Quali-

tative reasoning is a sub area of artificial intelligence that seeks

to understand and explain human beings’ non numerical evalua-

tions and it also permits to handle with non numerical data pre-

serving the principle of relevance, i.e., each variable can be val-

ued with the level of precision required (Travé-Massuyès et al.,

2004, 2005). Finally, GIc is successfully evaluated and com-

pared with respect to other approaches for tackling one of the

challenges of the tourism sector: ’what are the main factors that

lead to excellence in hospitality?’

This article is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the

concept mapping methodology and how quantitative validation

index can be used for selecting the most suitable patterns. Sec-

tion 3 proposes the global index of consensus and describes its

bases. Section 4 applies the concept mapping methodology for

discovering the meaning of excellence in hospitality, and it also

show how this index outperforms the results provided by some

of the most well-known quantitative index. Finally, section 5

ends with the conclusions and further work.

2. Framework

This section summarises the concept mapping methodology

and some of the most well-known validation indexes used for

the selection of the most suitable clustering solution.

2.1. Concept Mapping methodology

Concept mapping was developed by Trochim (1989) to re-

spond to the conceptualisation needs based on the objectifica-

tion of opinions and ideas from a group of experts. It uses a

methodology which incorporates statistical techniques, such as

multidimensional scaling and cluster analyses, and its applica-

tions is based on six main steps as indicated in Figure. 1: prepa-

ration, generation of statements, structuring statements, repre-

sentation of statements, interpretation of maps and utilisation of

maps.

1. Preparation. The aim of the preparation step is twofold.
On one hand, clarify the construct for research. On the

other, choose the focus group members who will partici-

pate in the process. For the best results, the group should

contain up of 8-15 participants who are as diverse as possi-

ble in order to have different points of view reflected (Har-

rison and Klein, 2007).

2. Generation of Statements. Upon finishing the first step,
the participants are invited to offer their ideas regarding on

the main topic at hand using a brainstorming session. The

development of this phase usually counts on the collabo-

ration of an expert team specialised in group dynamics in

order to obtain the best results possible (Bigné et al., 2002;

Calvo et al., 2006).

3. Structuring of Statements. The purpose of this step con-
sists in determining how the different statements raised

in the previous process are related. For this, the partici-

pants are asked to, firstly, evaluate each of the statements

mentioned during the brainstorming session and, secondly,

each member had to group the different statements accord-

ing to their own criteria. For the first part, the focus group

members are asked to rate the list of statements using a

Likert scale from 1 to 5 (Bigné et al., 2002) according

to the degree of adjustment of the statement towards the

concept set out. For the second part, participants have to

group the list items according to their own criteria and a

label that represents the main concept of each group they

considered. Once the participants have rated the items and

grouped them, a similarity matrix S rxr for each of the par-
ticipants is created where r represents the total number of
statements generated during the brainstorming session. In

each intersection, a ’1’ was introduced if a person in the

group had put both items in the same group; otherwise,

a ’0’ was introduced. Next, each individual’s matrix is

added to create a general grouping matrix as shown in Fig-

ure 1. In the central diagonal there is the total number of

participants, and the number of each intersection shows

the number of people who put both corresponding state-

ments in the same group independently of their meaning

or the criteria used (Calvo et al., 2006).

4. Representation of Statements. Two statistical techniques
are applied to objectify the results obtained during the pre-

vious phase. The data gathered in the grouping matrix in

the previous step is processed using a multidimensional

scaling (MDS) technique as agreed by Borg and Groenen

(1997) to project the original r dimensional space into a
two dimensional space where each dot represents an state-

ment. The closer together two dots are, the greater the

number of people is who feel that these statements were in

the same group. Once the map is constructed, a clustering

algorithm (Jain, 2010) is applied using the same distance

coordinates as those obtained by theMDS (Borg and Groe-

nen, 1997). Clustering algorithms are able to group data

from different points of view, and their suitability mainly

depends on the application domain. Thus, the elements

in a cluster are similar among them and different from the

elements of other clusters and it provides the experts a pos-

sible classification or categorisation of the elements.
One of the main challenges that experts have to tackle

when they apply clustering techniques is the selection of

the most suitable cluster solution as these techniques usu-

ally offer more than one possible solution, and there is no

exact method to determine the definitive number of clus-

ters as stated by Hair et al. (2006). Thus, the expert needs

to evaluate the different configurations generated by the

approach in order to select the most suitable representa-

tion of the statements.
For this reason, the usage of a cluster validation index has

Fig. 1. The concept mapping process is split into 6 steps: (1) A set of experts are selected for finding out the meaning of a specific concept; (2) A list of
r ideas is generated through a Brainstorming process; (3) Ideas are evaluated by the experts and this information is used to build a matrix MTr×r; (4) A
multi dimensional scaling and a clustering technique are applied over the matrix to project the information in a 2D space. The result is a set of r-1 possible
cluster configurations; (5) Experts analyse all the configurations and they label each one of the clusters based on their items; (5) Experts agree on selecting
the best concept representation based on the subset of concepts identified (6).

become crucial to facilitate the data analysis in order to

score or sort the possible solutions based on indicators

(also called validation index) that promotes the separabil-

ity and/or the compactness of the clusters (Garcia-Piquer

et al., 2012, 2014). These indicators allow experts to re-

duce the range of potentially valid solutions because they

are based only on quantitative values without taking into

account information related to the problem, which limits

their capabilities. In this sense, the definition of a specific

index based on the domain characteristics is the best way

to help experts to select the most suitable solution (Corral

et al., 2011). This is exactly what we do in this article by

means of the GIc, which allows experts to rank the clus-

tering solutions based on what experts agree.

5. Interpretation of Maps. After the statements had been
mapped via the cluster analysis, a name is given to repre-

sent the key statements in each group as shown in Figure

1. To carry out this step, interviews are held with experts

in the field to evaluate the content of each group. The par-

ticipating experts analyse the obtained results so that the

global result corresponds to reality (Trochim, 1989).

6. Utilisation of maps. Lastly, the maps are used as a graphic
representation of the experts’ opinion regarding the con-

cept under study (Bigné et al., 2002).

One of the biggest benefits of this methodology is its flex-

ibility and capability for being applied to any kind of domain

because it defines a framework that can be easily adapted to fit

the problem that has to be faced. In contrast, this flexibility be-

comes a challenge because there is no one single way of doing

things and this may hamper analysis. A clear example occurs in

step 4 where the application of the clustering technique offers a

set of potentially valid configurations. In that case, the selection

of the configuration will set the difference between the success

or failure and that is where the expert can be aided to select the

most suitable configuration using the key element: consensus.

2.2. Looking for the most suitable patterns
The use of unsupervised learning approaches such as cluster-

ing algorithms is an essential step in almost any data analysis

problem. However, two independent steps are needed before

hand: analysts have to select (1) the clustering approach and

(2) select the most appropriate solution from the whole set of

possible solutions.

There is not a single criteria to classify the clustering algo-

rithms, so they can be classified according to many criteria (Gan

et al., 2000; Witten and Frank, 2011; Duda et al., 2000): (1) the

search strategy to find the clusters (center-based, graph-based,

model-based, search-based, density-based and subspace clus-

tering), (2) the relationships between the clusters (partitional

and hierarchical), (3) the instances distribution into the clusters

(hard clustering or fuzzy clustering), and (4) the optimisation



4

of the clusters (conventional clustering, ensemble clustering, or

multiobjective clustering). For this reason, it is important to

select the algorithm according to the data typology and the fea-

tures of the application domain (Jain, 2010).

On the other hand, clustering techniques usually offer more

than one possible cluster solution because they are not able to

automatically identify the optimal number of groups to discover

or the results are conditioned by some initial parameters that

need to be tuned among other reasons (Garcia-Piquer, 2012).

These facts often hinders the data analysis step because experts

must evaluate all the different solutions generated by the al-

gorithm, which is highly time consuming and quite arbitrary

because the selection will depend on the subjectivity of the ex-

pert due to the fact that all of them are potentially valid. For this

reason, the application of evaluation functions for automatically

scoring the clustering solutions has become the key for helping

experts to select the best (Gurrutxaga et al., 2011). These eval-

uation functions define metrics that measure the cluster quality

by using the same features included in the data set. Therefore,

the challenge is define what quality means as the following sub-

sections describe.

2.2.1. Deviation and Connectivity

The simplest evaluation metric for measuring the quality of

a cluster solution is to evaluate how close the elements of each

cluster are and how separated the clusters between them are.

Consequently, the smaller their values the better is the solution.

This is exactly what Deviation and Connectivity measures do

respectively (Handl and Knowles, 2007; Hruschka et al., 2009;

Gurrutxaga et al., 2011).

The Deviation (Dev) measures the compactness of the clus-
ters. It is computed as the overall summed distances between

data items and their corresponding cluster centre as Equation 1

shows, where C is the clustering obtained, Ci is the set of in-
stances belonging to cluster i, νi is the centroid of cluster i, and
d(x, νi) is the Euclidean distance between the element x and νi.

The Connectivity (Conn) refers to the cluster connectedness.
It takes into account the degree to which data points that are

close in the feature space have been placed in the same cluster

as Equation 2 shows, where r is the number of examples in the
training data set, C is the clustering obtained, nn(x, i) returns
the ith nearest element of x using the Euclidean distance and �
is the amount of nearest elements taken into account. Note that,

for each instance i, the metric computes a weighted sum of the
� nearest neighbours that belong to a different cluster from that
of i (the weight is decreased according to how far instances i
and j are).

Although the information provided by the Deviation and the

Connectivity allows to obtain insights from the cluster solution

analysed, this information is not enough to select the best con-

figuration. Thus, it is necessary to define more powerful indi-

cators to evaluate the clustering solutions.

2.2.2. Cluster validation index
Cluster validation index (Halkidi et al., 2001) is an objec-

tive function that evaluates the clustering results. Validation

techniques can be based on comparing clusters to the origi-

nal classes of the problem if classes are known (supervised

approach), or by validating clusters according to their quality

based on the compacting and separation between them when

classes are unknown (unsupervised approach).

Regarding the characteristics of the clustering technique used

in the concept mapping (partitional and hard clustering), there

are three possible clustering validation approaches (Halkidi

et al., 2002; Legány et al., 2006). The reader is referred

to (Theodoridis and Koutroumbas, 2008) for hierarchical and

fuzzy clustering algorithms. The first one is called external cri-

teria and the idea is to evaluate a clustering result comparing it

with a structure of the data set obtained without applying any

clustering algorithm. The second approach is called internal cri-

teria and the objective is to evaluate a clustering result compar-

ing it with only quantities and features inherent to the data set.

The third approach is called relative criteria and it is based on

comparing a clustering result with other results obtained from

the application of the same clustering algorithm with different

parameter values, or of other clustering algorithms. The clus-

ter validation methods based on external or internal criteria are

based on statistical hypothesis testing, and their major draw-

back is their high computational cost. Moreover, these two ap-

proaches measure the degree to which a data set confirms an



5

a-priori specified scheme that can be inherent to the data set or

an intuitive structure of the data. On the other hand, relative cri-

teria methods find the hypothetical best clustering scheme from

several clustering results obtained with different parameters or

clustering algorithms without using statistical tests, so they are

less computationally expensive. Therefore, this last approach

is what we really need for our purposes because we want to

compare the performance of several configuration in an unsu-

pervised process.

The Davies-Bouldin index (Davies and Bouldin, 1979) (see

Eq. 3), the Dunn index (Dunn, 1974) (see Eq. 4) and the Silhou-

ette index (Rousseeuw, 1987) (see Eq. 5) are three of the most

well known validation strategies. The range of the first two in-

dexes is [0,+∞] and [−1, 1] for the last one. Silhouette and
Dunn indexes have to be maximised, and Davies-Bouldin index

has to be minimised. In the three equations C is the clustering
obtained; k is the number of clusters; Ci is the set of instances
belonging to cluster i; |Ci| is the number of elements in Ci; νi is
the centroid of Ci; d(x, y) is the Euclidean distance between x
and y elements; nn(x, i) returns the ith nearest element of x ac-
cording to d(x, y); and � is the amount of nearest elements taken
into account. The main difference of these three indexes is the

calculation of the quality of the shape of each cluster. Davies-

Bouldin index evaluates the clusters taking into account if they

are scattered, calculating the distance between the instances of

each cluster and their respective centroid. Dunn index evalu-

ates the clusters calculating if they are compact, penalising the

clusters with a long diameter. Silhouette index calculates the

tightness of the clusters, taking into account the distance be-

tween the instances of each cluster.

3. Methodological approach

The approach proposed in this paper helps the experts to eval-

uate in the step 4 the different configurations generated in the

previous steps, and to select de optimal clustering solution, as

described in Subsection 2.1. To this end, the proposed method-

ology aims to identify and emphasise the clusters and the ideas

in which the experts agree that are the most important ones.

This is done in two phases. First a degree of consensus of clus-

ters is defined to measure the agreement among the members

of the focus group with respect to each cluster. Second a recur-

rence index of each idea, highlighting the ideas that are more in

consensus, is used as a weight coefficient to define a global in-

dex of consensus of configurations in order to promote the ideas

in which experts agree. This methodology relies on the use of

qualitative labels belonging to a qualitative absolute order-of-

magnitude model. This allows dealing with the focus group

members evaluations to improve Concept Mapping processes

through the new global index.

3.1. Qualitative reasoning
The one-dimensional absolute order-of-magnitude model

(Travé-Massuyès et al., 2004, 2005) works with a finite num-

ber of qualitative labels corresponding to an ordinal scale of

measurement. The number of labels chosen to describe a real

problem is not fixed, but depends on the characteristics of each

represented variable.

Let us consider an ordered finite set of basic labels S∗ =
{B1, . . . , Bn}, being n the number of labels chosen each one
of them corresponding to a linguistic term, in such a way that

B1 < · · · < Bn.

Example 1. To illustrate the expression of a set of ordered lin-
guistic evaluations, an example of the basic labels for n = 5 is
given by: B1 = “not important at all” < B2 = “of little impor-
tance” < B3 = “important” < B4 = “very important” < B5 =
“extremely important”.

The complete universe of description for the order-of-

magnitude space is the set S = S∗ ∪ {[Bi, Bj] |Bi, Bj ∈ S∗, i <
j}, where the label [Bi, Bj] with i < j is defined as the set
{Bi, Bi+1, . . . , Bj}, with the convention [Bi, Bi] = {Bi} = Bi.

Consistent with Example 1, the linguistic evaluation

“very or extremely important” can be represented by the non-

basic qualitative label [“very important”, “extremely impor-

tant”], i.e., [B4, B5]. The label “unknown” is represented by
[“not important at all”, “extremely important”], i.e., [B1, B5].

The order in the set of basic labels S∗ induces a partial order
≤ in S defined as: [Bi, Bj] ≤ [Br, Bs]⇐⇒ Bi ≤ Br and Bj ≤ Bs.
This relation is trivially an order relation in S, but a partial

order, since there are pairs of non-comparable labels. For in-

stance, in Example 1, the relation [Bi, Bj] ≤ [Br, Bs] expresses
that [Bi, Bj] is “less or equal important than” [Br, Bs].
There is another partial order relation ≤P in S “to be more

precise than”, given by [Bi, Bj] ≤P [Br, Bs] iff [Bi, Bj] ⊂
[Br, Bs], i.e. r ≤ i and j ≤ s. The less precise label is
? = [B1, Bn]. This structure permits working with all differ-
ent levels of precision from the basic labels to the ? label (see

Figure 2).

Two different binary operations are defined in the complete

universe of description S, called the connex union and the in-

tersection, introduced in a more general context as the mix and

the common operations in Roselló et al. (2010).

Definition 1. Given two qualitative labels [Bi1 , Bj1 ],
[Bi2 , Bj2 ] ∈ S, their connex union is the qualitative label
[Bi1 , Bj1 ]  [Bi2 , Bj2 ] = [Bmin(i1,i2), Bmax( j1, j2)].

Fig. 2. The complete universe of description S (Roselló et al. (2010)).



6

Definition 2. Given two qualitative labels [Bi1 , Bj1 ],
[Bi2 , Bj2 ] ∈ S, such that [Bi1 , Bj1 ] ∩ [Bi2 , Bj2 ] � ∅,
their intersection is the qualitative label [Bi1 , Bj1 ] ∩ [Bi2 , Bj2 ] =
[Bmax(i1,i2), Bmin( j1, j2)].

Following Example 1, the connex union of B1 and [B3, B4]
is B1  [B3, B4] = [B1, B4], and their intersection is empty. In
the case of the pair of labels [B1, B3] and [B3, B4] their connex
union is [B1, B3]  [B3, B4] = [B1, B4] and their intersection is
[B1, B3] ∩ [B3, B4] = B3.

3.2. Entropy and Consensus

A definition of a consensus index, able to synthesise the focus

group members’ evaluations, is used in the proposed method-

ology. The consensus index involves the notion of entropy of

a qualitative label defined in S, inspired in Shannon entropy

concept in information theory (Shannon, 1948). This notion re-

quires a normalised measure on the set S, i.e., a measure such

that μ(Bi) > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n and
∑

Bi∈S∗ μ(Bi) = 1. Then:
μ([Bi, Bj]) =

∑ j
k=i μ(Bk), μ([Bi, Bj]) ≤ 1 for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n},

and μ([B1, Bn]) = 1.
In the context of qualitative absolute order-of-magnitude

models, the concepts of information of a label and entropy of a

qualitative description were introduced in Roselló et al. (2010).

Following Roselló et al. (2010), in this paper we define the en-

tropy of a qualitative label by a positive continuous real function

of the measure of this label as follows:

Definition 3. The entropy of a qualitative label Q ∈ S is de-
fined as:

H(Q) = ln
1

μ(Q)
,

where μ is the measure considered in S.

Note that for all Q ∈ S, if Q �? then μ(Q) ∈ (0, 1) and,
consequently, H(Q) > 0. Moreover, H decreases with respect to
≤P: Q ≤P Q′ ⇒ Q ⊂ Q′ ⇒ μ(Q) ≤ μ(Q′) ⇒ ln 1μ(Q) ≥ ln 1μ(Q′) .
In addition, H(?) = ln 1 = 0.

The definition of the degree of consensus of a set of qualita-

tive labels is as follows:

Definition 4. Given m qualitative labels Q1, · · · , Qm ∈ S, such
that ∩mj=1Qj � ∅, their degree of consensus is:

Dc(Q1, · · · , Qm) =
H(mj=1Qj)
H(∩mj=1Qj))

=
ln(μ(mj=1Qj))
ln(μ(∩mj=1Qj))

In the case that ∩mj=1Qj = ∅, their degree of consensus is
Dc(Q1, · · · , Qm) = 0.
Example 2. Let us consider the concept C = “Customer Ori-
ented” and a focus group of 3 members E = {e1, e2, e3}. Let us
assume that the opinions of the three members with respect toC
are represented by three qualitative labels defined as: Q1(C) =
[B4, B5], Q2(C) = B4, Q3(C) = [B3, B5] using the linguistic
evaluations corresponding to basic labels B1, . . . , B5 given in
Example 1. Finally, let us define μ(Bi) = 1/5, i = 1, . . . , 5.

Then, since 3k=1(Qi(C)) = [B4, B5]B4[B3, B5] = [B3, B5]
and ∩3k=1(Qi(C)) = [B4, B5] ∩ B4 ∩ [B3, B5] = B4, the degree of
consensus is:

Dc(Q1, Q2, Q3) =
H(3k=1(Qi(C)))
H(∩3k=1(Qi(C))))

=
H([B3, B5])

H(B4)
=

=
ln 3/5

ln 1/5
= 0.32

3.3. The Proposed Global Index of Consensus

The structure of qualitative absolute order-of-magnitude

models allows us to deal with the focus group members’ eval-

uations of ideas and concepts in a concept mapping process.

To this end, we work in a one-dimensional absolute order-of-

magnitude model with n basic labels corresponding to the n
ordered responses of the Likert scale used by the members of

the focus group.

In the following, let us consider a focus group consisting of

m members, that after a brainstorming process have generated
and evaluated a set of r different ideas. For each member of the
focus group j, with 1 ≤ j ≤ m, and for each idea X, the opinion
of member j with respect to X is an element of S∗, which is
denoted by Vj(X).
Note that the concept mapping method provides r − 1 dif-

ferent cluster solutions. Each cluster solution provides exactly

k clusters or groups, being 1 ≤ k < r. For instance, on the
one hand, the cluster solution with 2 clusters groups r − 1 ideas
in one cluster and the remaining most discordant idea alone in

the other cluster. On the other hand, the cluster solution with

r − 1 clusters, groups the most similar two ideas in a cluster
meanwhile the remaining r − 2 ideas are each one in a different
cluster.

From now on, for each 1 ≤ k < r, clusters belonging to
the configuration with k groups will be denoted by Cki , with
1 ≤ i ≤ k.

Definition 5. Fixed a configuration with k clusters, let j, with
1 ≤ j ≤ m, be a member of the focus group, let Cki , 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
be a cluster, and let {Xi

1
, . . . , Xisi } be the set of ideas in cluster

Cki . The opinion of member j with respect to C
k
i is defined as:

Qj(C
k
i ) = Vj(X

i
1)  · · ·  Vj(Xisi ).

Note that Qj(Cki ) belongs to the complete universe of de-
scription for the order-of-magnitude space. In the case that

Vj(Xi1) = · · · = Vj(Xisi ), Qj(Cki ) is a basic label, otherwise
Qj(Cki ) is a non-basic label.
Intuitively speaking, Qj(Cki ) is the result of mixing the eval-

uations of member j of all ideas in cluster Cki in a new one that
includes all of them.

The entropy H and the degree of consensus Dc introduced
in Subsection 3.2 allows us to define a measure of consensus

among the members of the focus group with respect to each

cluster:

Definition 6. Fixed a configuration with k clusters, let Cki , 1 ≤
i ≤ k, be a cluster, and let Qj(Cki ) be the opinion of member
j with respect to Cki , 1 ≤ j ≤ m. The degree of consensus of
cluster Cki is

Dc(Cki ) =

⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
H(
⊔m

j=1 Qj(C
k
i ))

H(
⋂m

j=1 Qj(C
k
i ))

, if
⋂m

j=1 Qj(C
k
i ) � ∅

0, otherwise.

In order to reflect if a configuration has any cluster with

nonzero degree of consensus, we define:

Definition 7. Fixed a configuration with k clusters,

N(k) =

⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩
1, if ∃Cki such that Dc(Cki ) � 0
0, otherwise.

The above definition allows us to introduce a recurrence in-

dex of an idea. The index is defined via these numbers N(k),
k=1 to r-1 and the characteristic functions of clusters. The re-
currence index of an idea takes into account the expert’s per-

ception of the relevance of the idea, which is extracted from the

evaluations of the focus group members.

Definition 8. Let X be an idea, The recurrence index of X is:

RI(X) =

∑r−1
k=1

∑k
i=1 1Cki

(X)∑r−1
k=1 N(k)

where 1Cki
is the characteristic function that indicates member-

ship of an element in Cki .

In this way, RI(X) provides a normalisation of the number of
times the idea X is in consensus among all the configurations.

To be able to select the most suitable cluster solution as

an improvement of a concept mapping process, we propose a

global index of consensus of each configuration, to measure the

cluster solutions quality. The global index of consensus of a

configuration is constructed as a weighted sum of the degrees

of consensus of clusters in the configuration. Each weight cap-

tures the importance of the corresponding cluster by consider-

ing the addition of the recurrence index of ideas belonging to

it.

Definition 9. The global index of consensus of a configuration
with k clusters is

GIc(k) =
k∑
i=1

w(Cki ) · Dc(Cki ),

where w(Cki ) =
∑

X∈Cki RI(X), i.e. the addition of the recurrence
index of ideas in cluster Cki .

4. Case study: What are the main factor that describe ex-
cellence in hospitality?

This section tackles the challenge of analysing the meaning

of the excellence in hospitality by means of the application of

the concept mapping methodology. First, excellence in hospi-

tality is introduced. Next, the application of the first four steps

for the statement generation is described. Thus, the selection of

the most suitable clustering configuration is analysed by means

of the application of quantitative and qualitative index. Finally,

experts label and assess the discovered concept through the last

two steps.

4.1. Excellence in hospitality
There is an increasing concern over the term and meaning of

hospitality as well as a search among academics to identify a

globally understood an accepted conceptual term that defines

this concept. Slattery et al. Slattery et al. (2002) refers to

Lashley et al. (2000) who posit that the understanding of hospi-

tality has been impaired by an industrial myopia and propose

to improve the understanding by; reflecting insights into the

study of hospitality that encompass the commercial provision

of hospitality and the hospitality industry, yet at the same time

it is recognised that hospitality needs to be explored in a pri-

vate domestic setting and studies the concept of hospitality as

a social phenomenon involving relationships between people.

Along similar lines of thought, Wood and Brotherton (Wood

and Brotherton, 2008) affirm the statement that the conceptual

development for the hospitality concept is limited, and the aca-

demic literature that does exist is scattered. This current issue

and underlying challenge to find the meaning of hospitality can

be rooted by the essence of the discipline. The hospitality sector

has always been a professional one and from a commercial and

management point of view it has evolved into more areas where

an interaction between a host and a guest takes place. Even

though a holistic approach to the term hospitality is increasingly

accepted, it is still important to define the key aspects that define

such discipline not only for academic purposes but also to help

develop better suited professionals (Vila et al., 2012). Hospital-

ity has always been about relationships. The word itself means

friendliness to strangers. Hemmington (2007) suggests that by

exploring and defining hospitality as an experience, new per-

spectives emerge that have important implications for hospital-

ity in commercial contexts. These implications take hospitality

beyond services management to a place where hospitableness, a

sense of theatre and generosity are central. Hemmington advo-

cates that hospitality businesses must focus on the guest expe-

rience and stage memorable experiences that stimulate all five

senses. By achieving this, hospitality organisations that are able

to capture this sense of theatre and generosity will gain compet-

itive advantage by providing their guests with experiences that

are personal, memorable and add value to their lives. Linking

this concept to the values in the hospitality concept, (Harkison

et al., 2011) posit that hospitality, because of its connection to

values and ways of thinking is not an art, a science, or a busi-

ness, but a philosophy. It further proposes that those motivated

by a desire to serve are strongly and deeply attracted to work

in commercial hospitality where they can express themselves



8

and find meaning through their work. In those places where

there is an interaction between hosts and guests, loyalty is the

critical factor for a sustainable business. To achieve loyalty

in hospitality, an attitude and philosophy towards excellence is

necessary. Business excellence is important in creating sustain-

able and continuous quality improvement of business processes,

that may bring strong financial performance, high customer de-

mand, goal achievement, successful employee recruitment and

admission, desired product and service outcome, and outstand-

ing staff (Kanji, 2002).

4.2. Generation of the possible maps
The steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the concept mapping methodol-

ogy were done in the following way for creating all the set of

potentially groups of concepts.

1. Preparation. A focus group composed by 11 experts rep-
resenting the hospitality industry in Barcelona was held

in January 2014. All participants were senior managers

with more than 10 years of relevant experience in in-

ternational companies. It is important to highlight that

Barcelona is the 10th-most-visited city in the world and

the third most visited in Europe after London and Paris,

with 8 million tourists every year since 2012 (Bremmer,

2011). Barcelona is a internationally renowned tourist des-

tination with numerous recreational areas, historical mon-

uments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites,

many good-quality hotels, and developed tourist infras-

tructure. The participants were asked to answer the ques-

tion: From your point of view, what are the main factors

that describe excellence in hospitality?

2. Generation of Statements. A list of 100 ideas were gen-
erated following the brainstorming session leaded by an

expert in group dynamics (see Table 1 in the supplemen-

tary material).

3. Structuring of Statements. The aggregation matrix was
built by means of the addition of the matrix of each fo-

cus group member. Each individual’s matrix represents

the evaluation of ideas from 1 to 5 and how the ideas are

related among them.

4. Representation of Statements. The multidimensional
scaling (in accordance with the Alscal Method) was ap-

plied to project the information in two dimensions. Next,

a clustering method (according to the Ward Method) was

executed to generate the potentially statement representa-

tions that were from only 1 cluster (k=1) since 99 clusters
(k=99).

4.3. Selection of the most suitability map representation
Steps 5 and 6 are focused on labelling and analysing the cor-

rectness of the most suitable clustering configuration from all

the r potentially configurations discovered in the step 4 and,
consequently, this decision will condition the results. We anal-

yse this selection from three different perspectives using: (1)

Quantitative indexes, (2) The proposed global index of consen-

sus and (3) Combining the mentioned quantitative indexes and

the consensus concept, using the degree of consensus (Dc) in-
troduced in Definition 6.

Figure 3 shows the results of applying the Davis-Bouldin,

Dunn and Silhouette indexes described in Subsection 2.2.2

which are only based on the cluster geometric data without tak-

ing into account additional knowledge from the domain. The

figure shows that Davis-Bouldin and Dunn indexes obtain the

best results when the k is higher. In contrast, Silhoutte index
promote the solutions with fewer clusters. Therefore, all index

are promoting extreme solutions that will hinder the task of ex-

perts because the concept has to be defined using few clusters

with almost all ideas or many clusters with one or two ideas.

For this reason, quantitative indexes are not enough for guid-

ing the selection process. If the expert is looking for concepts

that should represent the consensus between the different focus

group members, why do not introduce this domain characteris-

tic into the problem?

The application of the global index of consensus requires

three steps: (1) Preprocess the 99 clustering configurations in

order to remove the clusters and elements without consensus

(Definition 4); (2) Calculate the recurrence index (Definition

8) as Figure 5 shows; (3) Apply the global index of consensus

(Definition 9) over the preprocessed clustering configurations

as Subsection 3.3 describes. Figure 4 shows the global index

of consensus and the impact of applying the consensus concept

over the clusters and their elements into the 99 configurations.

For each one of the configurations, the clusters (and their items)

without consensus are removed because they represent informa-

tion that introduces noise and uncertainty. As seen, the number

of clusters and elements is drastically reduced because this pre-

processing operation promotes the ideas in which experts agree.

Thus, the configuration k=20 is selected as the best because it
has the highest global index of consensus and the highest num-

ber of clusters and elements in consensus.

Finally, Figure 6 shows the application of the Davis-Bouldin,

Dunn and Silhouette indexes described in Subsection 2.2.2 over

the 99 preprocessed configurations. The most significant ef-

fect that can be observed from the application of that consensus

concept is that the linearity of the scoring is broken because

some empty configurations are rejected, which is reducing the

original scope of configurations. Nevertheless, each index pro-

motes different configurations as it happened before and k=85
is selected as the best cluster configuration based on the three

indexes because it is the intersection between them.

4.4. Analysis and assessment of the discovered concept

The best configurations selected for the global index of con-

sensus and for the combination of the consensus concept with

the quantitative indexes were presented to the experts in order to

label the clusters and assess its meaning regarding to the initial

question. After the analysis of both configurations, the experts

agreed that the configuration selected using the quantitative in-

dexes was too small for extracting any conclusion because it

had only two clusters and seven ideas in consensus. In con-

trast, the configuration provided by the proposed global index

of consensus allowed them to label the resulting clusters as:

• Innovation, quality, successful service performance and
technology assistance ideas represent Service Quality. An

Fig. 4. The graphic shows the global index of consensus and how many
clusters (and how many items) have a degree of consensus different from
zero for each one of the 99 configurations. This approach highlights the
most relevant and useful data, which are the ones with consensus. Thus, the
global index of consensus is a qualitative index that promotes the selection
of configurations based on the elements with highest degree of consensus.

the 99 preprocessed configurations generated in the step 4. The preprocess
consists in removing the clusters (and its elements) with degree of consen-
sus equal to zero. The value of index is 0 for those configurations that are
too small and it is not possible to compute the index values.

excellent hospitality means to deliver an innovative and

excellent service to the customer.

• To acknowledge the customer upon arrival, To address



10

to the customer in his/her language, tailor-made service,

speak the customer in his or her language and to iden-

tify the customer by his or her name represents Customer
Oriented. Description: An excellent hospitality means to
have a company, which understands and fulfils customer

needs and expectations.

• To surprise continuously, exceeding the customers expec-
tations, feel at home and positive prescription represents

Loyalty. An excellent hospitality means to create a long-
lasting relationship with the customer by exceeding his or

her expectations and making the customer feel special.

• Passion for the employee, change management, discipline,
an appropriate employee selection, to train the employees

to understand the customers needs and to share the quality

results with the employees represents Human Resource
management. An excellent hospitality is delivered by ex-
cellent people at the firm, so an excellent human resource

management is the key to achieve it.

• 5 senses setting, an intense, sustainable and eco-friendly
experiences, to adapt to new trends and to shift from ser-

vice delivery to experience creation represents Creating
an experience. An excellent hospitality means providing
memorable experiences rather than a plain service.

Finally, we also reviewed the worst scenarios to figure out

why they scored with a low value. In this sense, experts anal-

ysed the configurations k=2, 3 and 11 selected by the Silhoutte,
Dunn and Davies-Bouldin respectively and their conclusion

was that they were not useful. In fact, Figure 4 shows that the

consensus for these configurations is 0.

5. Conclusion and further work

One the biggest challenges when applying the concept map-

ping methodology is to decide the suitability or the relevance

of a configuration. In this work a new method that substantially

improves the clustering determination in this methodology has

been proposed. A global index of consensus is defined based

on the objectivity and the consensus, which are two of the main

premises of the concept mapping methodology. The proposed

global index helps experts to select the most suitable cluster-

ing configuration improving the knowledge discovery process,

since experts have to focus only on useful configurations. In

that sense, the global index helps experts to identify the config-

urations containing concepts and ideas in which experts agree

for being the most important ones. The global index presented

in this paper is based on qualitative reasoning techniques and

permits extract valuable and useful information from experts,

which is crucial to select the most suitable configuration.

The proposed methodology has been applied to analyse the

meaning of excellence in hospitality in a case study framed in

the Barcelona hospitality industry in January 2014. The case

study experimental results proved that this method achieves

much better results compared with current state-of-the-art ap-

proaches, based only on quantitative data.

From a theoretical point of view, future work includes the

adaptation of the proposed global index to other unsupervised

clustering methodologies to determine the most suitable config-

uration. On the other hand, understanding what excellence in

hospitality means from a cross-cultural perspective should be

very interesting because the mobility in this century is a key

element in tourism.
