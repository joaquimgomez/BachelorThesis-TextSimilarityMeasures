Background
Therapeutic robots that work to diagnose, rehabilitate, and assist in surgery, are all 
designed to motivate and assist patients with psychological conditions. Robo-ther-
apy consists of the interaction between patients and robotic creatures in order to help 
patients build a positive attitude towards fighting a disease [1].

Since pet robots are mainly considered in this study, focus is spent on robots that 
can be categorized with similar therapeutic effects as in animal-assisted therapy [2]. 

Abstract 
Background: This PATRICIA research project is about using pet robots to reduce pain 
and anxiety in hospitalized children. The study began 2 years ago and it is believed that 
the advances made in this project are significant. Patients, parents, nurses, psycholo‑
gists, and engineers have adopted the Pleo robot, a baby dinosaur robotic pet, which 
works in different ways to assist children during hospitalization.

Methods: Focus is spent on creating a wireless communication system with the Pleo 
in order to help the coordinator, who conducts therapy with the child, monitor, under‑
stand, and control Pleo’s behavior at any moment. This article reports how this techno‑
logical function is being developed and tested.

Results: Wireless communication between the Pleo and an Android device is 
achieved. The developed Android app allows the user to obtain any state of the robot 
without stopping its interaction with the patient. Moreover, information is sent to a 
cloud, so that robot moods, states and interactions can be shared among different 
robots.

Conclusions: Pleo attachment was successful for more than 1 month, working with 
children in therapy, which makes the investment capable of positive therapeutic 
possibilities. This technical improvement in the Pleo addresses two key issues in social 
robotics: needing an enhanced response to maintain the attention and engagement of 
the child, and using the system as a platform to collect the states of the child’s progress 
for clinical purposes.

Unfortunately with animal-assisted therapy, these animals are not readily available. Con-
cerns towards dog bites, allergies, or diseases have led to high restriction or removal of 
this type of therapy in hospitals and nursing homes. Other issues include the need of a 
trained professional at all times around these animals, and sessions that are restricted to 
a schedule. Robotic therapy has emerged to combat these issues.

The Program Child Life was started in 2004 at Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (HSJD), in 
Barcelona, Spain, with the purpose of designing pioneering techniques to improve a 
child’s experience by reducing pain and anxiety during hospitalization [3]. In 2010, 
more than 200 children and teenagers along with their families have participated in this 
program.

The PATRICIA project [4] is based on the use of social robots with the same goal. 
HSJD has teamed up with the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and La Salle 
Universitat Ramon Llull (La Salle URL) to collaborate as technological partners. This is 
an innovative interdisciplinary project addressed to improve the quality of life of hos-
pitalized children that may face many challenges. Therapeutic robots act as a robotic 
companion that can stand alongside a person coping with a psychologically demand-
ing situation. The work behind this therapy is not an easy endeavor. Companies such as 
Fujitsu, Innvo Labs, and PARO Robots have been working on this for decades and it is 
only in the last 5 years that they have gained studies with positive results.

A huggable Teddy Bear is being developed by Fujitsu as a therapeutic companion for 
hospitals and nursing homes to be used in health care, education, and social commu-
nication applications [6]. It uses a dozen sensors to recognize facial expressions and 
movements from a patient with a camera located on its nose. It is intended to record the 
patient’s emotional state and react accordingly using a range of 300 shared actions.

PARO is a baby seal shaped robot designed by Takanori Shibata in Japan in 1993, but 
was not commercialized until 2004 [5]. It is equipped with five kinds of sensors: tem-
perature, touch, light, audio and position sensors. Additionally Paro is able to learn a 
person’s behavior. This pet offers similar benefits as animal assisted therapy, and is used 
to treat people with Alzheimer’s and other related disabilities.

ROMIBO is an open source coded therapeutic robot [7] specially designed to the 
research and treatment of autism in children. It uses wireless communication in order to 
be remotely controlled.

Finally, the Pleo, our chosen platform, is a robot that imitates a Camarasaurus dino-
saur. It exhibits an appealing expressiveness and consists of an array of different behavior 
and moods. Pleo has been tested in several research studies [4, 8–10] that have been 
focused on the effect of pet robots in long-term interactions with children. Other inter-
esting research with this robotic platform is robot ethics [11], which plays an important 
role in robot-therapy.

Robot autonomy

Four degrees of Pleo’s autonomy can be deployed when interacting with a child:

  • Full autonomous behaviour according to implicit, opaque to users, internal states: 
Pleo always acts according to its own criteria. The problem is that in this modality, 



Page 189 of 196Larriba et al. BioMed Eng OnLine 2016, 15(Suppl 1):S72

Pleo’s behaviour is not totally predictable by the user at any time but may be inferred, 
anticipated or understood by the user according to a previous interaction.

  • Full autonomous behaviour according to observable internal states: The conductor of 
the interaction between a patient and Pleo can watch Pleo’s internal states through 
a graphical interface that externalizes or makes Pleo’s internal states transparent in 
order to facilitate management of an interaction.

  • External control of Pleo’s states: The coordinator is allowed to modify or control the 
robot by changing its internal states and allowing the robotic platform perform its 
correlative activity.

  • External control of Pleo’s behaviour: Allows for fully tele-operated control of move-
ments and actions of Pleo. It always requires the presence of the coordinator.

It has been found that the best choice for testing Pleo in a hospital is located in the sec-
ond and the third levels, thus this will be the approach in this research.

Methods
Pleo’s platform is capable of helping children at HSJD and their families improve their 
treatment. This research group presents a new generation of health care robots—com-
bining cloud robotics and artificial intelligence—to provide children with an effective 
and individualized assistance to their therapy [12].

The goal is to supply each patient with a personal Pleo that uses this cloud multi-agent 
system to perceive, collect and share the status on a child. Using artificial intelligence, 
the behaviour of every patient’s robot can be modified. Finally, since this information is 
in the cloud, the system can explore the most effective actions to carry out to improve its 
own patient’s experience.

Until now, it is not possible to modify the software system of Pleo since the software 
is not open sourced. However, it does allow users to modify some values or commit to 
some precise actions. For example, it is able to notify people about how hungry it is, how 
happy is it, and do various tasks such as ask a person to go out on a walk, or perform a 
trick such as giving a user its paw for a handshake.

Hardware communication with the robot is not as easy as in previous Pleo commercial 
versions. In order to obtain data in “real time” Pleo was connected to an external power 
source while performing communications between its USB connector and a remote 
computer. It is possible to get values from Pleo’s sensors in real time using this system 
setup. It is also possible to connect via bluetooth to a UART port [12] to bridge Pleo 
and a Raspberry Pi. Other processing platforms like Intel Galileo or Edison, and wire-
less communications like ZigBee or WiFi can also be implemented depending on power, 
processing, and privacy needs. The Raspberry Pi module can access the Internet via a 
Wi-Fi dongle to upload data to the cloud.

There were two problems in this communication setup: firstly there was a lack of phys-
ical space to work with since the original battery of Pleo was employed with compacting 
wires and left the bluetooth module visible. Secondly, new Pleo robots are not equipped 
with this UART connector, so they could be exclusively tested in old versions.

Cloud‑based Pleo robot

In order to expand Pleo’s connectivity it was transformed into a cloud client that mini-
mized the impact on the hardware that already existed. The implementation is done by 
not changing the pre-programmed bio-inspired (Fig. 1) behaviour, doing zero modifica-
tions on the embodiment, and keeping a good trade-off between data transfer and power 
consumption between the robot and the cloud.

Figure 2 shows a cloud architecture that allows human users and artificial intelligent 
agents to stimulate the pet robot by modifying its internal states. It depicts a conceptual 
overview of the overall project where the three key elements are the cloud, the robot 
companion, and the therapy done by the Pleo robot.

The three stimulation elements in this cloud robotics design that can modify Pleo’s 
internal states through the cloud are [13]:

  • The artificial intelligent agent—Is aimed at learning which decision parameters and 
descriptors are relevant. This element is currently under development, so it is out of 
the scope of this work.

  • The interface—Induces customized behaviour to the Pleo by changing its parameters. 
This element has been currently developed as an Android app along with physical 
modifications for wireless communication.

  • The VLEO, a tangible user interface—Combines a virtual avatar with augmented real-
ity, to reproduce the Pleo robot. It interacts with other pet robots on the cloud. This 
element is under development and early results are introduced in this text.

VLEO: the virtual social character that interacts with Pleo

VLEO is a smart avatar. What makes VLEO unique is that it is a virtual character that 
interacts with both humans and Pleo robots. It is proven that tangible devices increase 
the quality of interactions compared to those interactions with virtual agents. A down 
side is that physical agents are constrained by their size and shape as well as their envi-
ronment. By combining a virtual agent and a physical robot it is possible to increase 
the complexity of an interaction through narratives and virtual worlds. Our early tests 
involve children from 8 to 12 years old (11 boys and 4 girls) [13]. Observations suggested 
that virtual social robots could improve engagement and enjoyment during a child’s play 
time. 83.3 % preferred to play with VLEO and the Pleo and 16.7 % preferred only Pleo.

VLEO’s controller is a cube. Each face of the cube represents a Pleo’s state change. By 
turning the cube children can modify the states of Pleo. The cube’s faces have a pattern 
that is read by the camera of a tablet, and the tablet is connected to the cloud server 
where the game engine (Unity) enables a graphic rendering of a virtual Pleo. The visual 
tracking of the cube is done by using Vuforia Unity Extension, and the magnitude of 
the state change is controlled by the angle of the cube. Pleo’s connectivity to the server 
is done through a local processor (computer or Raspberry Pi) using the battery system 
with bluetooth.

Externalizing Pleo’s moods and states through bluetooth

Unfortunately, earlier workshops run by a psychologist and a pediatric group with chil-
dren from the HSJD hospital have been performed without communication systems. 
When the Pleo had a bad mood or acted in a non-normal way there was no manner 
to know exactly what was happening. Pediatric groups could only correct the situation 
based on their personal knowledge.

The objectives pursued in this work (an extension of the work developed in [14]) are 
presented as the following:

  • Provide an extension for Pleo that can be mounted in any Pleo for bluetooth com-
munication.

  • Give the coordinator the ability to control Pleo in order to make a specific action due 
to a situation. An Android application was chosen to run this platform since its open 
source software makes it convenient to use and easy to make changes.

  • Prove a bluetooth-battery package that fits inside the battery hole in order to assem-
ble the module in one package.

Results
Hardware

The proposed solution for the hardware challenge, shown in Fig. 3, is to switch Pleo’s 
battery for a battery-bluetooth package. Distinguishable components are listed below.

  • PCB: Its main function is to act as the conductive element between the batteries and 
the springs that feed the robot. Based on the base of the battery, it must fix the 4 pins 
that establish contact to the bluetooth output of Pleo.

  • Connector pogo pins: Catch the signal that Pleo sends to be processed in the blue-
tooth module.

  • Bluetooth module: Receives the data signal from the robot and sends it to the con-
nected device. The JY-MCU and HC-05 are two of the cheapest Bluetooth serial port 
modules in the market, but their provided voltage is not enough. A more sophisti-
cated module is needed, such as the RN-41 microchip.

  • Battery pack: Pleos battery requites a 7.4 V, a charge of 2800 mAh, 20.72 Wh power 
and can withstand a max temperature of 60 °C.

A 3D printed case was made for the elements of this assembly.

Interface

The interface must be as simple and comfortable for the user as possible. Connecting to 
the Pleo robot must be user friendly, bluetooth must turn ‘on’ when the app is launched 
and a button should be present to search Pleo’s signal and establish communication. A 
first sketch of the main menu is shown in Fig. 4. It presents a list of different Pleo states, 
allows the user to modify the emotional status of Pleo, and allows the user to ask for 
their value. If needed, it is possible to add more buttons for Pleo actions, in order to 
respond with a specific action when the situation requires it.

Development of the solution

Connection via terminal

Pleo USB connection does not support Win 64 bits, so a virtual image for XP 32 bits was 
implemented. The easiest way to connect to the Pleo is via PuTTY and USB connection.

Bluetooth assembly

One of hardest challenges in this work is the challenge involved in building a Bluetooth 
assembly. On the rear face of the battery inside the hole it is impossible to insert a ver-
nier caliper for measuring purpose. Moreover the rear is a little wider than the external 
perimeter of the hole.

To solve the problem of obtaining the correct pin positions, a thin sheet of transparent 
plastic was cut, introduced inside the hole and marked with a fine-tipped pen. The plas-
tic was then extracted, measured with the vernier caliper and drawn with a CAD tool. 
Once the layout was drawn, the next step was to build the PCB. Finally, a 10 × 1 female 
header was welded to connect the RN-41 without welding directly to the module that 
could damage it.

Power issues

When the PCB is set inside the Pleo, batteries power the robot, but after pressing its 
button to turn it on, the robot does not move. It was believed that both batteries were 
not enough to power the robot and the Bluetooth module, so a button cell of 3.3 V was 
used to power the RN-41, without taking up too much space. After these changes Pleo’s 
awoke, sent some data to the screen of the terminal, but soon afterwards it powered 
back off; canceling communication.

It seemed like a power failure, hence the minimum tension and intensity to make the 
robot work was measured. There it was discovered that the minimum power to supply to 
Pleo RB is 7.4 V (equivalent to 3A). Placing the robot in sleep mode was done to reduce 
its power values a little bit. This explains why the same battery that Pleo carries provides 
more than 8.4 V when it is completely full. Another discovery was that the Pleo robot, 
unlike USB wired communication, does not allow bluetooth communication if the robot 
is not running.

Android app

Figure 5 shows how the interface looks like. The first scene is a presentation to intro-
duce the user. Here the application turns ‘on’ the Bluetooth of the smartphone or device 
where the app is installed. In the next scene there is a button that user must push once 

Fig. 4 First sketch of the interface. First sketch of the Android application



Page 194 of 196Larriba et al. BioMed Eng OnLine 2016, 15(Suppl 1):S72

the module RN-41 is powered in order to pair it with the device. Then the app searches 
the corresponding MAC direction. In the case that it does not find it, it will display an 
error message. On the other hand, if the communication is established the app redi-
rects the user to the third scene (command window), where the user sends and receives 
data from Pleo. When Pleo is switched on, unlike USB communication, the robot starts 
sending data on the initialization of the source. Hence, the application developed can-
not receive Pleo’s states values or send any motion command until initial conditions has 
been received and processed.

Conclusions
Wireless communication between Pleo and an Android device is achieved. With the 
Android app developed the user is able to obtain any state of the robot without stopping 
its interaction with the patient. It also contains a revisable text box to allow the user to 
send orders to the robot from a list of allowed actions.

Communication with the robot with the bluetooth module to the output has been suc-
cessful. As newest Pleo’s versions have no UART port connection, upcoming works with 
Pleo may now look to a solution based on what has been explained in this work. Bottom 
connections are insured to work properly and can be used in further research.

During test trials, it has been made evident that using a couple of 3.7 V cells is not 
enough to make Pleo run due to these values being too close to the operating limit. 
Using a third cell is needed to make the Pleo robot move.

Moreover, the developed Android app can be installed in many devices and its inter-
face is easily understandable for users.

After many hours working with Pleo, several observations can be expressed about it, 
which three have been highlighted and described below:

  • Pleo is not a robust platform. It is common with Pleo that it may during some days 
not turn on. If Pleo survives for more than 1 month without these boot up issues it 
should be considered economical since it is affordable.

  • Pleo is unable to react to a child’s laugh or cry. This is a very important issue because 
it leads to a child losing interest, and is known that the progress of the therapy is 
directly proportional to the motivation of the patient. If Pleo does not seem to care 
for the child, the child will not care of Pleo and the therapy could fail.

  • In the future it is desired for the cloud to be able to collect the states of these chil-
dren.

One of the first milestones of this project, the Bluetooth communication with Pleo, 
has been achieved completely. Using the PCB with the extensible pins it is possible sup-
ply. Bluetooth communication to any Pleo, even those without UART connection. The 
second milestone, which is to modify Pleo’s states from an Android device, has also been 
successfully achieved. This has helped the coordinator understand and control the robot 
through a user friendly app. The third milestone, which was to assemble a bluetooth and 
battery package has not been fully completed. Pleo works using 3 AA cells and fits to the 
designed package in this work. This setup was not completely developed, since a 3D cage 
was built for two AA cells. It should be easy to build a newer more compatible assembly.

Pleo is a commercial closed platform, thus alternative platforms should be considered 
in the near future. In this sense, two technical research lines are opened. The first one 
involves consideration to commercial platforms and design of a pilot robotic platform 
to be certified for commercial use. The second involves working with the possibility to 
certify the employed device as a medical device for therapeutic purposes.
