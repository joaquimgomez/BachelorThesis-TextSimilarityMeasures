This study assesses the influence of the forecast horizon on the forecasting
performance of several machine learning techniques. We compare the fo recast
accuracy of Support Vector Regression (SVR) to Neural Network (NN) mo -
dels, using a linear model as a benchmark. We focus on international tourism
demand to all seventeen regions of Spain. The SVR with a Gaussian radial
basis function kernel outperforms the rest of the models for the longest fore-
cast horizons. We also find that machine learning methods improve their
forecasting accuracy with respect to linear models as forecast horizons in-
crease. This results shows the suitability of SVR for medium and long term
forecasting.

Keywords: forecasting, tourism demand, Spain, support vector regres-
sion, neural networks, machine learning.

T
he increasing weight of the tourism industry in the gross domestic product of
most countries regardless of economic fluctuations explains the growing in-
terest in the sector from economic circles. Spain is one of the world’s most
important destinations after China, France and the United States. The coun-
try received close to 65 million tourist arrivals in 2014. The Canary Islands,

and were the regions that recorded a greater increase in the number of visitors, with
rates above 10%. The steady growth of tourism demand in highlights the importance
of correctly anticipating the number of arrivals for the tourism industry.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have attracted increasing at-
tention for time series prediction [Hastie et al. (2009)]. ML is a field from Artificial
Intelligence (AI), and has been central to pattern recognition. ML is based on the de-
sign of algorithms to infer structures from a given set of data. ML allows to deal with
different problems, such as classification, clustering, and regression. Empirically, it
has been proved that rough sets algorithms and fuzzy time series models are par-
ticularly indicated for short-term forecasting with limited data [Peng et al. (2014)],
while Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are prefer-
able for longer term predictions.

The SVM technique was first developed for classification and pattern recognition
(Burges, 1988). Xu et al. (2009) use SVMs to improve tourist expenditure classifica-
tion for visitors to Hong Kong, and Li and Sun (2012) use a SVM-based firm failure
prediction model to anticipate the failure of firms in the Chinese tourism industry.

The initial idea has been extended to regression by using the support vectors for
local approximation, allowing for non-linear regression estimation in the form of
Support Vector Regression (SVR). SVR has been widely used for forecasting pur-
poses in finance [Tay and Cao (2002); Kim (2003); Cao (2003); Pai and Lin (2005);
Huang et al. (2005); Chen et al. (2006)] and other fields [Pai and Hong (2007); Guo
et al. (2008); Hong (2011) and Zhang et al. (2012)].

Nevertheless, very few attempts have been made for tourism demand forecast-
ing [Chen and Wang (2007); Hong et al. (2011); Wu et al. (2012) and Akin (2015)].
All these studies focus on one-step ahead forecasts at the national level. In this re-
search, we design an experiment to evaluate the forecasting performance of several
ML techniques by means of an iterated multi-step ahead forecasting comparison at
the regional level.

The main aim of this study is to analyze how the accuracy of SVR and NN pre-
dictions is influenced by the forecast horizon under consideration. In order to do so
we focus on international tourism demand to all seventeen regions of. We use six dif-
ferent forecast horizons and several SVR and NN models, and a linear model as a base-
line. This thorough comparison allows us to shed some light on the suitability of the
SVR technique to forecast seasonal time series and tourism demand in particular.

The study proceeds as follows. First, we review the literature on tourism demand
forecasting with ML techniques. In the next section the different forecasting methods
are described. The data set and the experimental settings are given in the following
section. Then, results of the out-of-sample forecasting competition are discussed. Fi-
nally, the last section provides a summary of the implications and potential lines for
future research.

1. LITERATURE REVIEW

A growing body of literature has focused on tourism demand forecasting, but
most research efforts apply either casual econometric models [Cortés-Jiménez and
Blake (2011); Page et al. (2012) and Li et al. (2013)] or time series models [Chu
(2009); Assaf et al. (2011); Gounopoulos et al. (2012) and Gunter and Önder (2015)].
See Song and Li (2008), Kim and Schwartz (2013), and Peng et al. (2014) for a thor-
ough review of tourism demand forecasting studies. These studies note that the per-

Revista de Economía Aplicada

formance of the forecasting models varies according to different factors, such as the
frequency of the data, the country of origin, the destination, and the length of the fore-
cast horizons. This lack of consensus regarding the most accurate model to forecast
tourism demand, has led us to focus the study on data-driven approaches based on ML.

The need for more accurate forecasts has led to an increasing use of ML tech-
niques to obtain more refined predictions of tourist arrivals at the destination level.
Goh et al. (2008) apply a rough sets approach to forecast U.S. and U.K. tourism de-
mand for Hong Kong. Yu and Schwartz (2006) and Tsaur and Kuo (2011) use fuzzy
time series models in predicting tourism demand in Taiwan. Wu et al. (2012) note
that SVM-based modelling is more indicated to deal with tourism data characteris-
tics. The authors compare the forecasting accuracy of different ML techniques
(SVM and Gaussian process regression models) to and ARMA model using monthly
tourist arrivals to Hong Kong from thirteen countries of origin from 1985 to 2008,
and obtain the most accurate predictions with ML models.

The SVM technique was originally introduced as a classification method fol-
lowing the idea of using a subset of the training samples, known as support vectors
to represent the class boundaries in the classification problem (Cristianini and
Shawe-Taylor, 2000). The use of these support vectors is related to the solution of
an optimization problem that maximizes a margin between classes after a transfor-
mation of the data. The optimization problem yields a solution based on the samples
aligned along the border between classes.

SVMs are first applied to tourism demand forecasting by Pai and Hong (2005)
and Hong (2006), who use a SVM models to forecast tourist arrivals to Barbados,
obtaining better forecasting results that with NNs. Velásquez et al. (2010) also ob-
tain better forecasts with SVMs than with MLP and ARIMA models for different
time series, including monthly totals of international airline passengers.

The original idea behind the SVM mechanism has recently been extended to re-
gression analysis. The introduction of the Vapnik’s insensitive loss function, together
with the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) for parameter selection, have recently led
to increased use of SVRs. Chen and Wang (2007) incorporate a GA in a SVR and
compare it to Back Propagation NN and ARIMA models to predict tourist arrivals
to China, using quarterly data from 1985 to 2001, and finding evidence in favor of
SVRs. Hong et al. (2011) compare a SVR with a hybrid chaotic algorithm to fore-
cast annual tourist arrivals to Barbados, and also obtain more accurate forecasts than
with ARIMA models.

Akin (2015) compares the forecasting results of SVR to that of SARIMA and
NN models to predict international monthly tourist arrivals to Turkey in 2011. By
means of a novel approach to model selection based on decision trees, the author
finds that SVR outperforms NNs in all cases but SARIMA models only when the
slope feature is more prominent.

The most widely used feed-forward NN topology in tourism demand forecast-
ing is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) [Claveria and Torra (2014); Teixeira and Fer-
nandes (2014); Molinet et al. (2015) and Hassani et al. (2015)]. A special class of
multi-layer feed-forward architecture with two layers of processing is the radial ba-
sis function (RBF) network. The first study to implement a RBF NN for forecast-
ing tourism demand is that of Kon and Turner (2005), who use a RBF network model

to forecast arrivals to Singapore. Cang (2014) generates predictions of UK inbound
tourist arrivals and combines them in non-linear models. Çuhadar, et al. (2014) com-
pare the forecasting performance of RBF and MLP NNs. Claveria et al. (2015a) find
that RBF networks provide better forecasting results than the MLP and Elman ar-
chitectures. Molinet et al. (2015) propose using different periodicities as input vari-
ables in NN models for tourism demand forecasting. The authors obtain more pre-
cise forecasts for longer horizons than with ARIMA models.

While most of the previous forecasting comparisons focus on one-step ahead
predictions at the national level, in this study the forecasting performance of three
SVR models is compared to that of two NN models by means of an iterated multi-
step ahead forecasting comparison. We assess the forecasting accuracy of the mod-
els for different forecast horizons at a regional level. In a recent study, Lehmann and
Wohlrabe (2015) address some of the issues related to regional forecasting.

There have been several studies on tourism in Spain at regional level [Aguiló
et al. (2005); Bardolet and Sheldon (2008); Santana-Jiménez and Hernández (2011);
Andrades-Caldito et al. (2013) and Sarrión-Gavilán et al. (2015)], but only a few re-
garding tourism demand forecasting. This research mostly focuses on two regions:
the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.

Regarding tourism demand forecasting to the Balearic Islands, Álvarez-Díaz and
Rosselló-Nadal (2010) forecast British tourist arrivals using meteorological variables,
Rosselló-Nadal (2001) predicts turning points in arrivals, Garín-Muñoz and Mon-
tero-Marín (2007) use a dynamic model with panel data, and Medeiros et al. (2008)
develop a NN-GARCH model. With respect to the Canary Islands, Hernández-López
and Cáceres-Hernández (2007) use a GA with a transition matrix to forecast tourists’
characteristics, Gil-Alana et al. (2008) models international monthly arrivals using
different time-series approaches.

The first attempt to use ML techniques for tourism demand forecasting in Spain
is that of Palmer et al. (2006), who design a MLP neural network to forecast tourism
expenditure in the Balearic Islands. The authors use quarterly data from 1986 to 2000,
and find that MLP NN provide more accurate forecasts when data have been de-
trended and deseasonalized. This result coincides with that of Claveria et al. (2016),
who analyse the effects of data pre-processing on the forecasting performance of NN
models and find that the predictive accuracy of the models improves with seasonal
adjusted data. In line with previous research by Pattie and Snyder (1996) and Burger
et al. (2001), Palmer et al. (2006) also find that NNs are especially suitable for long-
term forecasting, as long as data is pre-processed.

In a recent study, Claveria et al. (2015b) design a multiple-input multiple-out-
put NN framework to generate predictions for all visitor markets to a destination si-
multaneously. By using monthly data of tourist arrivals to Catalonia from 2001 to
2012, the authors generate forecasts for one, three and six months ahead with three
different NN topologies and find that RBF NNs outperform the rest of the models.

2. FORECASTING MODELS

The main contribution of this study to the previous literature on tourism demand
forecasting is the evaluation of the performance of several ML techniques by means
of an iterated multi-step ahead forecasting comparison. As most previous research
focuses on one-step ahead predictions, in this study we design an experiment to as-
sess how the forecast accuracy of the models is influenced by the forecast horizon
under consideration. As ML techniques do not need to pre-process the data, we are
able to compare the forecasting performance of three SVR models and two NN
topologies using seasonal raw data.

2.1. Support Vector Regression
The SVR mechanism proposed by Drucker et al. (1997) can be regarded as an

extension of SVMs to construct data-driven and non-linear regressions. The origi-
nal SVM algorithm was developed by Vapnik (1995) and Cortes and Vapnik (1995).
The idea behind the technique of SVR is to define an approximation of the regres-
sion function within a ‘tube’ of radius ε such that its output is as near as possible to
the desired output dt:

ωϕ( ) ( )= +f x x bt t [1]
where xi is the input vector; ω is a weight vector; b is a constant.

The parameters of the model are estimated by solving a convex optimization
problem that uses as cost function the ε – insensitive loss function Lε:

The hyperparameter ε determines the allowed margin for the regression. The hy-
perparameter C determines the number of noisy samples that overlap with the tube
that contains the regression function, and therefore can be considered as a regular-
ization parameter. As a result, high values of this parameter do not allow for sudden
changes in the slope of the regressed function. The selection of the hyperparameters
ε and C is done by means of cross-validation.

To solve [3], we can introduce two Lagrange multipliers and a kernel function
K (xi, xt) in the decision function. In this study we use three different kernels:

– Linear kernel (L-SVR) ( ) = +K x y a x y a, *1 2 [4]
– Polynomial kernel (P-SVR) ( ) ( )= +K x y a x y a, * h1 2 [5]
– Gaussian RBF kernel (G-SVR) δ( )( ) ( )= −⎡⎣⎢ ⎤⎦⎥K x y x y, exp 1

[6]



Where a1 and a2 are constants, h is the degree of the polynomial kernel, and δ2
is the bandwidth of the Gaussian RBF kernel. For a comprehensive introduction to
SVR see Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor (2000).

Note that the nonlinearities on the kernels do not define the shape of the non-
linearities given by the regression function. The nonlinearities of the kernel function
can be regarded as a similarity measure between the sample points and the support
vectors (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000). Therefore, the role of the kernel is to
determine the set of support vectors along the margin that contribute to the final value.
The final output consists of a linear combination of the values of the mapping us-
ing the kernel function of the test sample with each support vector:

where N – sv is the number of support vectors of the model, ωi is the i-th element
of weight vector ω, and K (xi, xt) is the kernel function that yields a similarity index
of the input vector xi and the i-th support vector.

2.2. Neural Networks
Neural networks emulate the processing of human neurological system to

identify related spatial and temporal patterns from historical data. A complete sum-
mary on the use of NNs with forecasting purposes can be found in Zhang et al.
(1998). In this study we use two different NN architectures: the RBF and the MLP.

The RBF model can be specified as:

hidden layer, which ranges from 5 to 30, increasing for longer forecast horizons.

non-linear function of the neurons in the hidden layer. The number of neurons is es-
timated by cross-validation. A complete summary on the implementation of NNs can
be found in Haykin (2008).



3. DATA AND METHODOLOGY

Data on international tourist arrivals to at a regional level are provided by the
Spanish Statistical Office (National Statistics Institute – INE – www.ine.es). Data in-
clude the monthly number of foreign tourists arriving to each region (Autonomous
Community) over the time period 1999:01 to 2014:03. As the main aim of this study
is to assess the forecasting performance of ML techniques for different forecast hori-
zons when using seasonal raw data, we use the level of the series, without any pre-
processing on the original data.

In Table 1 we present the number of international tourist arrivals and the fre-
quency distribution of international tourist arrivals in 2013 by region. The main three
destinations (Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Andalusia) account for more than
half (59%) of the total number of tourist arrivals to Spain. The first six destinations
account for almost 90% of the total number of tourist arrivals, which corroborates
that tourism demand is highly concentrated in very few regions.

In Figure 1 we map the frequency distribution of international tourist arrivals
to Spain by region. The first six destinations are marked in grey. We can see that all
these regions, with the exception of Madrid, are located in coastal areas of the
Mediterranean, showing the asymmetric concentration of tourism.



Table 2 presents a descriptive analysis of the data. The Balearic Islands and Cata -
lonia are the two regions with the highest peaks. While the Balearic Islands is the
region with the highest dispersion in the arrival of tourists, the Canary Islands pre-
sent the lowest coefficient of variation (CV), also known as relative standard devi-
ation, which is a dimensionless measure of dispersion obtained as the ratio of the
standard deviation to the mean and expressed as a percentage. This result may in part
be explained by weather conditions, as in the the climate is mild and temperatures
remain virtually constant throughout the year.

The performance of the different models is assessed by means of an iterated
multi-step ahead forecasting comparison. In order to be able to characterize correctly
the performance of the ML methods, and to adjust the hyperparameters and the struc-
ture of the models, the database is divided into three subsets:

– Training – From 1999:01 to 2006:12
– Validation – From 2007:01 to 2011:12
– Test – From 2012:01 to 2014:01
In applying ARMA models, only two subsets are used: the in-sample (from

1999:01 to 2011:12) and the out-of-sample periods (from 2012:01 to 2014:01). Ini-
tially, the first 52% monthly observations are selected as the training set, the next 33%
as the validation set, and the last 15% as the test set. Note that the different sets do
not overlap in time.

ARRIVALS TO SPAIN BY REGION (1999-2013)

The validation set is used to adjust the different parameters of the ML models.
In the case of NNs, the validation set is used to determine the optimal stopping time
for the training, and the topology of the network. In the case of SVR models, the val-
idation set is used for selecting the hyperparameters. The test set is used to estimate
the performance of forecasting models on unseen data (Bishop, 1995; Ripley, 1996).

After the first step, the partition between train and test sets is done sequentially:
as the prediction advances, forecasts are successively incorporated to the training
database, leaving the validation set fixed. Therefore, for each forecast, the size of the
test set decreases by one period, while the size of the training set increases by one
period. In each iteration, models are retrained, and both the optimal structure and the
parameters are obtained from the validation set.

The forecasting accuracy of a SVR model depends in good measure on the value
of the hyperparameters. Therefore, given the size of the sample, we do an exhaustive
enumeration of all possible combinations to estimate the value of the hyperparameters,
using as a selection criterion the performance on the validation set at each step.

Regarding the NN models, once the topology of the models is specified, the es-
timation of the weights of the networks can be done by means of different algorithms.
To avoid the possibility that the search for the optimum value of the parameters fin-
ishes in a local minimum, we use a multi-starting technique that initializes the NNs
several times for different initial random values, trains the network and chooses the
one with the best result on a validation database. All models are implemented using
the ‘Scikit-learn’ Python module, which is an open source library that integrates a
wide range of state-of-the-art ML algorithms (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

The forecasting performance of the different models is assessed for different
time horizons (1, 3, 6 and 12 months) by computing several accuracy measures. First,
we obtain the Relative Mean Absolute Percentage Error (rMAPE) statistic for all re-
gions (Table 3). The rMAPE ponders the MAPE of the model under evaluation
against the MAPE of the benchmark model. We use an ARMA model as a baseline.

We find that the lowest rMAPE values are obtained for longer forecast horizons,
except for NN models (Figure 2). This result indicates that SVR models improve their
forecasting performance with respect to ARMA models as forecast horizons increase.
With the exception of the Canary Islands and Madrid, which are the only two regions
that do not present a seasonal pattern, in most regions NN models outperform lin-
ear models for two, three and six-step ahead forecasts, while SVR models for three,
six and twelve-step ahead predictions (Figure 2).

In Figure 3 we map the different regions regarding the average rMAPE. We
compare the mean rMAPE values of SVR models to those of NN models, regard-
less of the forecast horizon. The highest values are obtained in the Basque Country,
Madrid, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands. At the other end, Aragon,
Castilla-La Mancha and La Rioja present the lowest average rMAPE values, indi-
cating the regions where, on average, ML models show the best forecasting perfor-
mance with respect to ARMA models.

Note: The rMAPE ponders the MAPE of the model under evaluation against the MAPE of the
benchmark model. We use an ARMA model as a baseline. Best model for each region in bold.



To attain a more comprehensive forecasting evaluation, we compute the PLAE
statistic proposed by Claveria et al. (2015b). The PLAE gives the proportion of out-
of-sample periods with lower absolute forecast errors than a benchmark model
(Table 4). The PLAE is a dimensionless measure based on the CJ statistic for mar-
ket efficiency (Cowles and Jones, 1937):

where A refers to the forecasting model under evaluation and B stands for the

In Table 4 we can observe a similar pattern to the one obtained with the rMAPE.
Results show that the G-SVR is the method that outperforms the ARMA model in
more cases. Special mention should be made of the Canary Islands and the Com-
munity of Madrid, where in most cases no ML method outperforms the ARMA.

Note: The PLAE ratio measures the proportion of out-of-sample periods with lower absolute errors
than the baseline model (ARMA model). Values below 0.5 indicate that the baseline model dis-
plays a higher number of lower absolute forecast errors than the model under evaluation for the
out-of-sample period.



To test whether the reduction in MAPE is statistically significant between the best
three models, in Table 5 we present the results of the Diebold-Mariano (DM) statis-
tic of predictive accuracy (Diebold and Mariano, 1995). The null hypothesis of the
test is that the difference between the two competing series is non-significant. A neg-
ative sign of the statistic implies that the second model has bigger forecasting errors.

Note: Diebold-Mariano test statistic with NW estimator. Null hypothesis: the difference between
the two competing series is non-significant. A negative sign of the statistic implies that the second
model (P-SVR, MLP NN) has bigger forecasting errors. The 5% level critical value is 2.028. Sig-
nificant values in bold.

When comparing the forecast accuracy of the G-SVR against that of the other
two models that yielded the lowest MAPE values, we find that the G-SVR shows a
significant improvement over the P-SVR in most regions, but the improvements over
the MLP NN are not significant.

These results confirm previous research by Hong (2006) and Chen and Wang
(2007), who obtain better forecasting results with SVM-based models than with NNs
for tourist arrivals to Barbados and China respectively. Velásquez et al. (2010) also
obtain better predictions with SVMs than with MLP NNs. Notwithstanding, we find
that the improvements in terms of MAPE of SVR models with respect to MLP net-
works are not statistically significant.



Finally in Table 6 we present a summary of the MAPE values. The results show
that while linear models are preferable for short-term forecasting, ML techniques are
more suitable for long-term prediction. From three-month ahead on, both SVR and NN
models outperform ARMA models. In this experiment all ML techniques have been
specified so as to use only one temporal lag for concatenation, as opposed to linear
models which were set to select the optimal number of AR and MA terms by means
of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The implementation of a model criterion
to identify the best suited specification regarding the number of lags in ML methods
would allow to perform equivalent forecasting comparisons to linear models.

To summarize, the overall forecasting performance of all methods improves for
longer forecast horizons. Regarding the different techniques we obtain slightly bet-
ter predictions with SVR models than with NNs. Nevertheless, not all SVRs show
the same performance. The SVR with a Gaussian RBF kernel outperforms the rest
of the models, especially for mid and long-term forecasts. This result is indicative
that the data is clustered along the margins that surround the regression function in



the SVR model. The fact that the data is clustered instead of spread in the input space,
also explains the lower performance of the polynomial kernel.

As Gaussian RBF kernels are the most prevalent choice for SVR-based fore-
casting (Smola and Schölkopf, 1998), and are also easy to implement, our results sug-
gest the potential of this SVR model for tourism demand forecasting. These findings
also highlight the importance of properly selecting the kind of kernel function
when using SVR models with forecasting purposes.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

As more accurate predictions become essential for effective policy planning, new
forecasting methods provide room for improvement. Artificial intelligence methods
based on machine learning such as Support Vector Regressions and Artificial Neural
Networks have attracted increasing interest to refine the predictions in the tourism
industry. SVR and NN are flexible techniques that admit a wide array of models. The
main purpose of this study is to assess the forecasting performance of Support Vec-
tor Regression for tourism demand prediction and seasonal forecasting. With this aim
we assess the influence on the prediction accuracy of the different techniques as fore-
cast horizons increase.

Three different SVR models based on different kernel functions and two alter-
native NN architectures have been used to generate predictions of international tou -
rism demand to all seventeen regions of Spain. By means of several forecast accu-
racy measures, the different ML techniques have been evaluated with respect to a
linear model used as a baseline. The forecasting out-of-sample comparison shows
that the SVR with a Gaussian RBF kernel outperforms the rest of the models in most
cases. The statistically significant improvement in terms of forecast accuracy with
respect to other SVR models illustrates the importance of not overlooking the pa-
rameter and kernel function selection for SVR modeling.

Another interesting finding is that ML methods improve their forecasting per-
formance with respect to linear stochastic models as forecast horizons increase. While
NN models show the best performance for intermediate forecast horizons, SVR mod-
els tend to yield the best predictions for the longer time horizons. This result sug-
gests that the optimal forecasting methodology depends on the time horizon of the
predictions. In this sense future research should focus on developing a model se-
lection criterion dependent on different forecast horizons.

This research contributes to the economic literature and to the tourism indus-
try by shedding some light on the most appropriate SVR model to predict seasonal
time series and tourism demand. A question that requires to be examined in further
detail is the implementation of model selection criteria for ML techniques that would
allow to refine AI-based predictions. The comparison of SVR to alternative ML tech-
niques such as Gaussian process regression is also left for future research.

RESUMEN
El presente estudio evalúa la influencia de los horizontes predictivos sobre
la precisión de las predicciones obtenidas mediante técnicas de inteligencia
artificial basadas en aprendizaje automático. Para ello se compara la capa-
cidad predictiva de diferentes modelos de Regresión de Soporte Vectorial
(RSV) y de Redes Neuronales (RNA) con un modelo lineal utilizado como
referencia. El análisis se centra en la demanda de turismo extranjero en Es-
paña a nivel regional. La RSV entrenada con un kernel de función de base
radial gaussiana supera al resto de modelos para las predicciones a más largo
plazo. También se encuentra que los métodos de aprendizaje automático me-
joran su capacidad predictiva con respecto a los modelos lineales a medida
que aumenta el horizonte de predicción. Este resultado pone de manifiesto
la idoneidad de la RSV para la predicción a medio y largo plazo.

Palabras clave: predicción, demanda turística, España, regresión de soporte
vectorial, redes neuronales artificiales, técnicas de aprendizaje automático.
