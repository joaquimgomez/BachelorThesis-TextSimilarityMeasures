Abstract: Background. Falling is a major clinical problem in elderly people, demanding effective
solutions. At present, the only effective intervention is motor training of balance and strength.
Executive function-based training (EFt) might be effective at preventing falls according to evidence
showing a relationship between executive functions and gait abnormalities. The aim was to assess
the effectiveness of a motor and a cognitive treatment developed within the EU co-funded project
I-DONT-FALL. Methods. In a sample of 481 elderly people at risk of falls recruited in this multicenter
randomised controlled trial, the effectiveness of a motor treatment (pure motor or mixed with EFt) of
24 one-hour sessions delivered through an i-Walker with a non-motor treatment (pure EFt or control

condition) was evaluated. Similarly, a 24 one-hour session cognitive treatment (pure EFt or mixed
with motor training), delivered through a touch-screen computer was compared with a non-cognitive
treatment (pure motor or control condition). Results. Motor treatment, particularly when mixed
with EFt, reduced significantly fear of falling (F(1,478) = 6.786, p = 0.009) although to a limited
extent (ES −0.25) restricted to the period after intervention. Conclusions. This study suggests the
effectiveness of motor treatment empowered by EFt in reducing fear of falling.

1. Introduction

Falling is a major clinical problem in elderly people aged 65 and over, affecting 30%–40% of those
living in the community and 50% living in nursing homes. Falls may lead to negative consequences
such as immobilization and injuries and these consequences reduce mobility, independence, quality
of life and life span [1,2]. They also increase the fear of falling, which is related to the risk of falls [3].
Fear of falling is experienced by elderly people after a fall [4] but also by those who have never fallen [5]
and this might explain the observed higher percentage of older adults reporting fear of falling than
those reporting falls in the previous 3 months [6]. However, fear of falling is related to the production
of an inappropriately cautious gait [7] and this might in turn cause falls that result in spiraling risk of
falls, fear of falling, and functional decline [3].

During the last twenty years studies on falls have substantially increased. However,
the pathophysiology is still not clear and this might be due to the multifactorial etiology of falls [7].
A fall is ‘an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower
level’ [8]; cause is only clear in 15% of cases (e.g., secondary to syncope, related to a neurological
disease, vestibular deficit, muscular weaknesses, an impairment of the afferents systems such as vision
or hearing loss, etc.) [9]. All the other conditions are identified as ‘idiopathic fallers’, i.e., subjects
who fall without any overt cause [10]. History of previous falls, abnormalities of gait or balance [11]
and a reactive stepping behavior in response to forward loss of balance [12] are risk factors for falls.
However, other factors such as cognitive and behavioral impairments might be other indicators of risk
of falls [7,13].

The impairment of executive functions and attention impairs postural control. Addressing the
latter can be a strategy, per se, to prevent falls because it might be sufficiently flexibly to adapt to the
changing environment [7]. For this purpose, dual task protocols, in which the subjects are asked to
simultaneously perform a motor and a cognitive task, proved the reciprocal influence between motion
and cognition [14] and its failure is a strong predictor of falls [15]. In fact, postural sway increases
when the subject executes a cognitive task [16,17] demonstrating that attention is required to control
posture. The relationship between motor and cognitive abilities plays an important role in falls of
elderly people since age decreases sensory information and increases the demand for greater attention
in postural control [18]. In fact, the reduction of attention and executive functions seems to be a primary
cause in idiopathic fallers [19] and appears to be an important risk factor for falls [20] in subjects with
a non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), based primarily on executive functions.

Concerning prevention strategies for the risk of falls, at present motor training of balance and
strength appears to be the only intervention program that reduces both the number of fallers and the
number of falls in community dwellers [21]. In particular, providing intensive balance exercise seems
to be effective in reducing falls [22]. Physical training also has an indirect effect on falls prevention
through a positive effect on cognitive abilities [23–26]. Other beneficial approaches are: the home
hazards modification, especially in high-risk groups; drugs adjustment and some surgical interventions
such as cataract and pacemaker implantation [21]. Recent evidence also supports the beneficial effect
of cognitive training on falls reduction [27]. In particular, training to enhance attention and executive

function produce improvements of gait [28] and in the elderly the combination of motor and cognitive
training using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) generates improvement of physical
functioning [28,29]. All these results encourage future research since the heterogeneity of the previous
studies does not allow being conclusive in this regard.

The present randomised controlled trial (RCT) is part of the multicenter and international
I-DONT-FALL (IDF) project co-funded by the European Union, offering an integrated system for fall
risk prevention and detection. Participants were randomised into a single cognitive or motor training,
a combined training and an active control condition, all of them lasting for 24 one-hour sessions
(twice-a-week) and were tested before and after the training period and then after a follow-up period
using standardised scales assessing mobility, cognitive abilities, behavior and functional aptitudes.

The primary aim of this study was to test the impact of these different training types on fall
risk in elderly people at risk of fall. Consequently, this required testing the hypothesis that motor
and mixed training would: (1) reduce the fear of falling; (2) increase balance and gait abilities.
The secondary outcome was to examine the impact of these different training approaches on the
cognitive, behavioral and functional domains. This meant that a test of the hypothesis that cognitive
and mixed training would: (1) increase cognitive abilities; (2) improve behavior (mood and anxiety);
(3) increase functional abilities.

2. Experimental Section

2.1. Methods

2.1.1. Study Design and Randomisation

This was a multicentre, stratified, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group study conducted in
Italy, Greece, Spain and Serbia. For allocation of participants a concealed [30] computer-generated
blocked (blocks size: 6) randomisation [31] was used. It was stratified by pilot sites in two steps: firstly,
subjects were randomised between the presence/absence of motor training and then between the
presence/absence of cognitive training. This resulted in 4 different arms: only motor training (MT),
only cognitive training (CT), mixed motor and cognitive (MixT), active control (AC) and those not
receiving either cognitive or motor training. A central randomisation service of an independent pilot
site sent the allocation of each participant via Internet to the investigators responsible for recruitment.
After being randomised between the different arms of the study, each participant underwent a complete
multidimensional evaluation (mobility, cognitive, behavioural and functional) at baseline at month zero
(M0), after 3 months during which subjects underwent 24 one-hour sessions of treatment twice-a-week
(M3) and after a follow-up period of 3 months (M6) (see Figure 1). Expert clinicians for each pilot
site, different from those responsible for enrolment and blind about the allocation of the participant,
conducted the assessments.

2.1.2. Subjects

The study comprised 496 enrolled subjects of which 481 were included in the final analyses.
All participants were enrolled in seven centres that included hospitals or local municipality centres in
Italy, Greece, Spain and Serbia. They all underwent a clinical screening that included the collection of
medical history, history of previous falls and the administration of the Tinetti Performance Oriented
Mobility Assessment (POMA) [32] and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [33]. Eligible
participants were elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) with a formal education of at least 5 years who met the
inclusion eligibility criteria for risk of fall according to previous studies [34–36] (total POMA score ≤ 20
and/or at least one fall in the previous year). Exclusion criteria were: the presence of major cognitive
(MMSE ≥ 20) disturbances, history of behavioral, psychiatric and/or systemic disturbances and/or
receiving any rehabilitative treatment. From the initial sample, 73 participants (14.7%) dropped-out
before the end of the training period and 15 subjects did not complete the follow-up evaluation

(Figure 1). In the final analyses 481 participants were included (i.e., all the enrolled patients with
the exception of the 15 subjects that did not executed the baseline (M0) assessment). All participants
provided their written informed consent approved by the local Ethics Committee of each pilot site.

participants provided their written informed consent approved by the local Ethics Committee of 
each pilot site.

follow-up (M6). Abbreviations: MT: motor treatment; MixT: mixed treatment; CT: cognitive 
treatment; AC: active control. 

2.1.3. Trainings and Active Control Condition 

All the treatment forms were administered through 24 one-hour sessions twice-a-week. They 
occurred in an inpatient setting or at a participant’s home. The intervention developed in this study 
comprised both motor and cognitive exercises and these were administered accordingly using the 
abovementioned randomization. Those participants randomised into MT underwent pure motor 
training, consisting in a set of warm-up procedures (i.e., stretching and squat) followed by exercises 
dedicated for half of the time of each session to balance and half to gait. These were administered 
through an i-Walker [37], an assistive technology device developed with the aim to support users 
with mobility disturbances by compensating unbalanced muscle force and lack of muscle force on 
climbs and descents. Balance training consisted of exercises lifting up heels or tiptoes, 
lateral/forward shifting, holding and flexion/extension exercises. Gait exercises involved moving the 
i-walker forward and backward with several variants. All exercises were augmented in difficulty by 
increasing speed, repetition, changing holding position or with one handed use of i-walker handles 
(see Appendix (Table A1 and Table A2) for a description of each balance and gait exercise). 
Participants randomised into CT underwent a set of exercises mainly focused on executive functions 
and attention (2/3 of the time of each training session). These were provided by trained cognitive 
therapists in an individual or group setting (up to three participants per session) administered 
through a computerized touch-screen platform (either in a table or in an all-in-one desktop

They occurred in an inpatient setting or at a participant’s home. The intervention developed in this

group setting (up to three participants per session) administered through a computerized touch-screen
platform (either in a table or in an all-in-one desktop computer) developed within a project called
SOCIABLE [38] co-funded by the European Union [39]. Each exercise provided three increasing levels
of difficulty adjusted by the therapists accordingly to the subject’s capability (i.e., each exercise was set
at a higher level of difficulty after two consecutive correct sessions). In particular, executive function
exercises consisted of working memory, planning, and abstraction tasks (e.g., ordering at restaurant
following some rules, solving tasks on similarities, differences and analogies, sorting pictures guessing
a covered criterion), whereas attention exercises consisted of selective and sustained attention tasks
(e.g., paying attention to a target item among distractors). Exercises of other main cognitive functions
(i.e., declarative memory, orientation, constructional praxis, language and abstract reasoning) were
executed during the remaining 1/3 of the time of each training session. MixT comprised both of
the abovementioned treatments resulting in 30 min of CT and 30 min of MT per session. Finally,
AC consisted of entering data into the same platform used during the CT. Data consisted of words,
names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, personal codes, names of towns, bank codes,
and non-words. This activity involved only automatic cognitive processes (i.e., reading and writing),
and not higher order cognitive functions [40].

2.2. Outcomes

The primary outcome of this study was the assessment of the impact of different training on risk
of falls measured with standardized scales assessing:

Mobility: Evaluation of balance and gait with Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment
(POMA) [32] for balance (POMA-B) and gait (POMA-G) and the fear of falling through Falls Efficacy
Scale—International (FES-I) [41].

The secondary outcome of this study was the assessment of the impact of different trainings on
cognitive, behavioral and functional aptitudes. These were measured with standardized tests and
scales assessing:

Cognition: Evaluation of executive functions and attention with Trail Making Test (TMT) [42],
phonological fluency test (PF) [43] and of verbal and visuo-spatial memory with Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test (RAVLT) [44] and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test (ROCF) [45].

Behavior: Evaluation of mood with Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [46] and anxiety with
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory—Y (STAI-Y), both State and Trait scale [47].

Daily functioning: Evaluation of daily functioning with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
scale (IADL) [48] and Barthel Index (BI) [49].

2.3. Sample Size

The sample size was based on a previous intervention study [50] assessing the effect of balance
training on fear of falling with FES-I. It was estimated that the minimum total sample size would be
447 (based on a = 0.05, power = 0.80, four groups) [51]. This compares favorably with the total sample
size of 481.

2.4. Statistical Analysis

In the final analyses, only the participants that did not complete the baseline assessment were
excluded. The multiple imputation technique for analyzing incomplete data sets to generate the dataset
to perform the analyses was adopted. This was the average (pooled dataset) of five imputed datasets
generated with SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

To assess possible differences at baseline (M0) between the samples receiving different treatments,
for each outcome and demographic variable two one-way ANOVAs were performed comparing motor
vs. non-motor condition and cognitive vs. non-cognitive condition (Table 1).

To test the experimental hypotheses, for each outcome measure assumed as a dependent
variable, a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the kind of treatment



Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 19 6 of 14

(motor vs. non-motor and cognitive vs. non-cognitive) and time (M0 vs. M3, i.e., pre vs. post
treatment) as main factors and their interaction. Motor condition comprised both MT and MixT,
whereas non-motor comprised CT and AC. Cognitive condition comprised both CT and MixT, whereas
non-cognitive comprised MT and AC. For each outcome measure, possible follow-up effects were
also evaluated by assessing the interaction between the kind of treatment and all of the time points
(M0, M3 and M6). To correct for multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni method was applied assuming
that within each domain, variables would be more or less dependent on each other and the significant
threshold was fixed at p < 0.0125. Post-hoc comparisons were executed for significant interactions
with two paired t-tests comparing time (M0 vs. M3 and M3 vs. M6) separately for each different
treatment (MT, CT, MixT, AC). The Bonferroni method was used to correct the post-hoc comparisons
and the significant threshold of p < 0.0125 was fixed. Cohen d’ effect sizes were calculated dividing the
post-pre training difference by the pooled standard deviation. According to Cohen [52] effect sizes
around 0.20 are considered small, around 0.50 medium and around 0.80 large.

3. Results

3.1. Baseline

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics of demographic variables and the study outcomes at baseline.
Only a significant difference in the distribution between females and males emerged comparing motor
vs. non-motor training and this factor entered the ANOVAs analyses as covariate of no interest for the
motor vs. non-motor training comparison.

3.3. Mobility

The motor treatment significantly reduced the fear of falling, measured with the FES-I scale,
as showed by the significant interaction between time (M0 vs. M3) and treatment (motor vs. non-motor)
that was significant at follow-up (see Figure 2, Tables 2 and 3). Post-hoc investigations revealed that the
MixT showed the largest effect followed by the MT, which did not last after the end of the treatment.
CT and AC showed no significant effects. All kinds of intervention increased balance and gait, without
any significant interactions among them but showed a significant main effect of time.

The different lines indicate the four different kinds of treatment: mixed (MixT), motor (MT),

4. Discussion  

The effectiveness of motor treatments on fall prevention is widely confirmed by several studies 
[22,53]. Particularly, motor treatments training balance and strength [22,53,54] are promising in 
preventing falls, as an impairment of these domains is recognized to play a pivotal role in increasing 
the risk of falls [55]. However, a recent systematic review by Kearney and colleagues [56] highlights 
the link between executive dysfunctions and gait abnormalities in older adults although its nature is 
still unclear. For this reason, a training focused on executive functions might exert some positive 
effects on mobility and vice versa. A particular important intervention outcome is the umbrella term 
for a complex pattern of problems called ‘fear of falling’ that includes fear, anxiety, loss of 
confidence and self-efficacy, avoidance behavior, social isolation that all contribute to increase 
frailty. It must be noted that fear of falling is found in elderly who fall but also in those who have 
never fallen [4,5,54]. 

The present study investigated the separate and conjoint effect of a balance/gait motor training 
and an executive function cognitive training on mobility, cognitive, behavior and functional 
outcomes in a large sample of elderly at risk of falls. Results confirm two findings already present in 
literature [57,58]. The motor training significantly reduced the fear of falling with a tendency to 
reduce the correlated anxiety. On the other hand, the cognitive training significantly improved 
cognitive abilities, in particular episodic memory. To clarify, two memory tests, based on the recall 
process, were used that also require executive functions to be performed [59]. The most suggestive 
result comes from the comparison between the single and the conjoint training showing that, for 
mobility and slightly also for cognitive variables, the mixed training showed stronger effects than 
the single ones. Although recent studies showed that cognitive approaches can also reduce the fear

3.4. Cognition

The cognitive treatment significantly increased verbal memory (a trend was present for
visuo-spatial memory) as showed by a significant interaction at follow-up (see Figure 2, Tables 2
and 3) between time (M0, M3 and M6) and treatment (cognitive vs. non-cognitive). Interestingly,
post-hoc investigations revealed that the MixT showed a slightly higher effect size than the CT and
that also the MT showed a significant positive effect. All kinds of intervention improved similarly
executive functions without any significant interactions among them and showing a significant main
effect of time.

3.5. Behavior and Functional Abilities

We did not obtain any significant interactions for GDS but only a main effect of time showing
a similar reduction of depressive symptoms among the different treatments. Anxiety showed a trend
toward a significant interaction in the trait STAI-Y between time (M0 vs. M3) and treatment (motor vs.
non-motor) showing a greater reduction of trait anxiety after the motor vs. non-motor training.

4. Discussion

The effectiveness of motor treatments on fall prevention is widely confirmed by several
studies [22,53]. Particularly, motor treatments training balance and strength [22,53,54] are promising
in preventing falls, as an impairment of these domains is recognized to play a pivotal role in increasing
the risk of falls [55]. However, a recent systematic review by Kearney and colleagues [56] highlights
the link between executive dysfunctions and gait abnormalities in older adults although its nature
is still unclear. For this reason, a training focused on executive functions might exert some positive
effects on mobility and vice versa. A particular important intervention outcome is the umbrella term
for a complex pattern of problems called ‘fear of falling’ that includes fear, anxiety, loss of confidence
and self-efficacy, avoidance behavior, social isolation that all contribute to increase frailty. It must be
noted that fear of falling is found in elderly who fall but also in those who have never fallen [4,5,54].

The present study investigated the separate and conjoint effect of a balance/gait motor training
and an executive function cognitive training on mobility, cognitive, behavior and functional outcomes
in a large sample of elderly at risk of falls. Results confirm two findings already present in
literature [57,58]. The motor training significantly reduced the fear of falling with a tendency to reduce
the correlated anxiety. On the other hand, the cognitive training significantly improved cognitive
abilities, in particular episodic memory. To clarify, two memory tests, based on the recall process, were
used that also require executive functions to be performed [59]. The most suggestive result comes from
the comparison between the single and the conjoint training showing that, for mobility and slightly
also for cognitive variables, the mixed training showed stronger effects than the single ones. Although
recent studies showed that cognitive approaches can also reduce the fear of falling [60], the results



Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 19 9 of 14

suggest that training patients conjointly on mobility and cognitive abilities produces better results
than substantial training on exercises only involving one aspect. This might be the result of a more
stimulating training in term of motivation or that the conjoint motor and cognitive stimulation might
involve different mechanisms in the brain that produce better results.

However, our results are far to be conclusive. In fact, accordingly to recent Cochrane reviews
assessing the effects of exercise interventions for reducing fear of falling in elderly people [61,62],
our intervention reduced fear of falling to a limited extent (ES −0.25) and the effect was restricted to
the period immediately after the end of the intervention. Nevertheless, although our effect represents
only a small difference [52], there is still not a clear consensus on the definition of minimal clinically
important difference for fear of falling measures. Taking into consideration this specific research
context, all previous studies included in the Cochrane reviews [61,62] that implied as outcome the FES
used the original 10-item [63–66]. They reported heterogeneous ESs (small, medium, very large) as well
as different FES baseline scores and, by consequence, populations with different fear of falling levels.
Interestingly, a recent study [67] implied the FES-I to assess the effectiveness of a two-year exercise
programme of progressive balance retraining in elderly women at risk of falls. Authors reported that
fear of falling increased during the study but less in the intervention group (about 2 points during
the first year) than in the control one (about 7 points during the first year). Although our effects were
small in magnitude, it is so far not clear the clinical value to take into consideration for their correct
interpretation [68] and this deserve further investigations.

The present study did not show any strong behavioral and functional effects after any treatments.
This might be due to the low impact of these deficits in the population that was recruited for this study
and a full significant effect might emerge in more severely impaired populations.

Finally, a quite unspecific improvement, in most outcomes as shown by the significant effect of
time in the employed measures, was observed. Although this might be a confound for the statistical
analyses, it also constitutes a positive result suggesting that the simple activity of taking care of
elderly people at risk of falls might exert some positive effects on their mobility and cognitive abilities.
However, this consideration deserves some further studies.

5. Conclusions

Consistently with data previously reported in literature, this study shows the effectiveness,
although to a limited extent to the period immediately after the end of the intervention, on fear
of falling of motor training focused on gait and balance exercises. It also shows the effectiveness
of cognitive training focused mainly on executive function exercises on cognitive outcomes and it
suggests that a combination of motor and cognitive treatment tends to maximize all these effects,
thus confirming the strength of the link between the domains of gait and balance performance and
executive functions. However, the underlying mechanism of this effect is still unclear and the lack of
clear clinical values in this research context makes the interpretation of the magnitude of the effects of
the treatment difficult. For these reasons, further studies are needed to clarify these issues.
