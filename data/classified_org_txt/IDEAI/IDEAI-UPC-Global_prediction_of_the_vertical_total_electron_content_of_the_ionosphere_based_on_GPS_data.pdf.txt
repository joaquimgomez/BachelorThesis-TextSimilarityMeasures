[1] Although vertical total electron content (VTEC) forecasting is still an open subject of
research, the use of predictions of the ionospheric state at a scale of several days is an area
of increased interest. A global VTEC forecast product for two days ahead, which is
based exclusively on actual Global Positioning System (GPS) data, has been developed in
the frame of the International Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Service (IGS)
Ionospheric Working Group (IGS Iono‐WG). The UPC ionospheric VTEC prediction
model is based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), which is widely used in image
compression (for instance, in JPEG format). Additionally, a linear regression module is
used to forecast the time evolution of each of the DCT coefficients. The use of the
DCT coefficients is justified because they represent global features of the whole two‐
dimensional VTEC map/image. Also, one can therefore introduce prior information
affecting the VTEC, for instance, smoothness or the distribution of relevant features in
different directions. For this purpose, the use of a long time series of final/rapid UPC
VTEC maps is required. Currently, the UPC Predicted product is being automatically
generated in test mode and is made available through the main IGS server for public
access. This product is also used to generate two days ahead preliminary combined IGS
Predicted product. Finally, the results presented in this work suggest that the two days
ahead UPC Predicted product could become an official IGS product in the near future.

1. Introduction

[2] Few decades ago, the satellite navigation dual‐frequency
Global Positioning System (GPS) became very popular for
ionospheric sounding. This system offered an unprecedented
combination of accuracy, temporal and spatial resolution,
and availability (low cost). Among other achievements, this
led to important progress in fields such as ionospheric
tomography (see review by Bust and Mitchell [2008]), which
has enabled to enhance precise Global Navigation Satellite
Systems (GNSS) navigation [Hernández‐Pajares et al., 2000]
and generate reliable global vertical total electron content
(VTEC) maps in a continuous operational way in the context
of the International Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS) Service (IGS [Dow et al., 2009; Hernández‐Pajares
et al., 2009]). This manuscript focuses on the improvement of
the GNSS application for operational monitoring of the iono-

spheric electron content. A summary of a new approach used
to predict global VTEC maps from GPS data in a very
demanding operational scenario is presented. Developing
short‐term ionospheric predictions can be of great importance
for certain scientific and technological applications. For
instance, there is a great interest from the European Space
Agency (ESA) in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
(SMOS [Sivestrin et al., 2001]) mission to retrieve iono-
spheric products provided by the IGS Iono‐WG, including
global VTEC predictions for two days ahead [Krankowski
and Hernández‐Pajares, 2008]. Currently, predictions are
being used by the authors as background model to generate
preliminary real‐time global VTEC maps (see details in the
work ofOrús et al. [2010]). Among many other applications,
this could be used to achieve sub‐meter accuracies for mass‐
market single‐frequency receivers. This would improve the
quality of current GNSS applications, such as in automobiles,
road mapping, location‐based advertising, personal naviga-
tion or logistics.
[3] In the past and recent years, methods for ionospheric

forecasting have been developed to predict ionospheric
parameters such as the critical frequency of the F2 layer
( f0F2), the maximum usable frequency at a distance of
3000 km of the F2‐layer (M(3000)F2) or the TEC itself.

These methods are based on neural networks [Cander et al.,
1998; Francis et al., 2000; Tulunay et al., 2006], auto‐
correlation and auto‐covariance procedures [Muhtarov and
Kutiev, 1999; Dick et al., 1999; Stanislawska and Zbyszynski,
2001], linear regression [Muhtarov et al., 2001; Krankowski
et al., 2005], among others.
[4] In terms of global VTEC forecasting using GNSS, the

first IGS Associate Analysis Center (IAAC) to generate its
own ionospheric predicted product was the Center for Orbit
Determination in Europe (CODE). Their model, which is
based on the extrapolation of the Spherical Harmonics coef-
ficients, is explained in detail by Schaer [1999]. Their one and
two days ahead VTEC maps (named C1PG and C2PG,
respectively) have been released for public access for years
via the FTP server of the Astronomical Institute of the Uni-
versity of Bern (AIUB; http://www.aiub.unibe.ch). More
recently, the ESA’s Space Operations Centre (ESA‐ESOC)
and the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) have created
their own two days ahead forecast product in the frame of the
IGS Iono‐WG (named E2PG and U2PG, respectively) to
fulfill the requests of the SMOSmission. These products have
been released for public access through the FTP site of the
Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS; ftp://
cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) since September, 2009. Furthermore,
preliminary combined IGS Predicted products for one day
and two days ahead have also been generated by ESA‐ESOC
since the end of December, 2009. These products are pro-
duced by combining up to the three individual preliminary
VTEC predicted products and are designated as I1PG and
I2PG for one day and two days ahead forecast, respectively.
[5] The first part of the article is devoted to explain the

UPC prediction approach in more detail. Afterwards, a sec-
tion is included on how the performance analysis is carried
out. And finally, before the conclusions, the results for two
days ahead forecast are presented for three periods (in 2004,
2006 and 2011) and validated against UPC Final IGS pro-
ducts (designated asUPCG) and JASON external data. A first
performance comparison is also included between UPC and
the other preliminary IGS forecast products.

2. Technical Description

[6] A model for short‐term VTEC predictions was
developed by the authors to generate a two days ahead
forecast product in the frame of the IGS Iono‐WG and to
fulfill the demanding SMOS mission requirements. In brief,
the forecast model is based on applying linear regression to

a temporal window of VTEC maps in the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT [Ahmed et al., 1974; Oppenheim and
Schafer, 2010]) domain. Figure 1 shows a simplified dia-
gram with the main steps that are required to compute the
UPC Predicted product.
[7] The UPC Final/Rapid IGS products are the input data

for the prediction model. These products are encapsulated in
IONosphere map EXchange format (IONEX [see Schaer
et al., 1998]) and contain 13 global VTEC maps at a tem-
poral resolution of two hours, from 00 UT of the corre-
sponding day to 00 UT of the following day. Each VTEC
map is a two‐dimensional map with spatial grid points
every 2.5°/5° in the latitude/longitude range assuming a thin
shell layer model of the ionosphere at a height of 450 km.
Thus, the map contains MxN = 5112 independent VTEC
samples, where M = 71, the number of grid points in the
latitudinal/vertical direction (the number of rows), and
N = 72, the number of grid points in the local‐time/horizontal
direction (the number of columns). From now on, the VTEC
value at rowm and column nwill be referred to as Vm,n. Since
the DCT is used as an image processing tool, the standard
nomenclature in image processing has been followed.
Therefore, the latitude/ordinate direction is also denoted as
vertical direction and the local‐time/abscissa direction as
horizontal direction.
[8] In daily computations, the last seven consecutive UPC

Final IGS products (UPCG) are used as the input dataset for
the model (first row in Figure 1). If any of these products is
not available or is not generated, the corresponding UPC
Rapid IGS product (UPRG) is retrieved instead. Note that
UPC Rapid IGS products are generated with a one‐day
latency while the UPC Final IGS products are internally
generated with a five‐ to six‐day latency. This is an accept-
able procedure because discrepancies between both the UPC
Final and Rapid IGS products are approximately 5–7%, as
stated by Hernández‐Pajares et al. [2009]. For the predic-
tion on day T, the input dataset includes the UPC products
from day T − 8 to T − 2 (being T − 1 the day before day T).
[9] Regardless, because 00 UT VTEC maps are calculated

twice for adjacent products, a total of U = 85 input VTEC
maps are considered (one map every two hours for seven
days, taking into account the fact that 00 UT maps are not
accounted for twice; U = 12*7 + 1). The U length was tested
for values between 13 and 481 (1 to 40 daily UPC IGS pro-
ducts as input dataset) for three independent weeks (in 2004,
2010 and 2011 with or without disturbed ionospheric con-
ditions, respectively) giving a consistent optimum value of

seven. As the performance curve is convex, the cutoff at
481 is justified because of the monotonous decrease in per-
formance and because the degradation is so severe when U
tends to 481 that higher values were not considered.
[10] The preprocessing step in Figure 1 includes the

transformation of the input data to a sun‐fixed reference
frame (local time and latitude). Afterwards, each VTEC map
is represented by a set of parameters of a generative model in
the frequency domain, in this case the two‐dimensional
DCT. The basis functions of the DCT represent the latitude,
longitude and crossed latitude/longitude spatial frequency
components of the original VTEC map. In other words, the
DCT provides information on the vertical, horizontal and
diagonal patterns of the input VTEC grid image. The output
values of the DCT of a given map are referred to as DCT
coefficients, following the notation Cp,q, where p and q cor-
respond to the vertical and horizontal discrete frequencies,
respectively. Thus, the DCT coefficient C0,0 is related to the
continuous component (i.e., themeanVTECvalue of themap),
and the DCT coefficients correspond to higher frequency
components as the p and q indices increase.
[11] Note that the DCT allows physical properties of the

VTEC to be modeled. Specifically, this includes the smooth
spatial evolution of the VTEC (i.e., the fact that the absolute
value of high frequency components is smaller than that of
low frequency components) and the fact that energy is more
concentrated along each frequency axis. Therefore, the original
VTEC map in the spatial domain can be generated with a
subset of the DCT coefficients without significantly degrading
the quality. In this work, a triangular subset considering
2556 DCT basis functions was selected to reduce the noise
produced by high frequency coefficients and to smooth the
spatial variation of the VTEC. Thus, the index of the vertical
discrete frequencies p ranges between 0 and P − 1 = 70, and
the index of the horizontal discrete frequencies q ranges
between 0 and Q − p = 71 − p. In equation (1), the mathe-
matical means of computing the DCT coefficients of a given
map represented by the VTEC values Vm,n is shown.

[12] It is important to note that the future values of each
DCT coefficient, rather than the raw spatial VTEC values,
are predicted. The predicted DCT coefficients can then be
used to reconstruct the predicted VTEC map by applying the
Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT; see diagram in
Figure 1) and a post‐processing, where the change in the
kind of coordinates is applied. This approach is more robust,
as the evolution of the VTEC for a specific grid point may
not be correlated with its previous values, but may be highly
correlated with the time and spatial evolution of the physical
processes affecting the whole VTEC map. In fact, the trans-
formation implies that the spatial information of the whole
map/image is implicit in each DCT coefficient.
[13] The relationship between past and future values of

each DCT coefficient is obtained by linear regression. The
input vectors xp,q in the diagram in Figure 1 are built with

the last U = 85 values of each DCT coefficient and include a
constant term to model the offset. Additional terms could
have been included with information such as the 10.7 cm
Solar Flux, the Sunspot number, the Kp geomagnetic index
or the ionospheric parameter Global Electron Content (GEC
[Afraimovich et al., 2006]). However, the impact of these
parameters on prediction performance is currently under
investigation. On the other hand, the corresponding linear
regression coefficients are computed via a training process
and are named wp,q. The model yields a high number of
parameters and the inputs could be collinear. As a result, ridge
regression is used, which is a modification of the linear
regression where a regularization term l · I has been added
to the covariance matrix [Hastie et al., 2001], where l is a
scalar below one and I is the identity matrix.
[14] In this work, the following training process is executed

each day (second row in Figure 1) taking approximately
45 min of computer processing in a standard PC under Linux.
First, the training data obtained from 366 days of UPC Final
IGS products are transformed to a sun‐fixed reference frame.
For the prediction for day T, the training dataset includes
the UPC IGS products from day T − 9 − 365 to T − 9. Sec-
ondly, all VTEC maps are converted into the DCT frequency
domain and one‐dimensional one‐year time series are gen-
erated for each DCT coefficient. A sliding window moving
one VTEC map per step determines the number of training
subsets of length U = 85 VTEC maps. Afterwards, the
coefficients wp,q are computed as shown in Algorithm 1.
These regression coefficients model the relationship between
the training subsets and their corresponding reference values
r p,q (known “predictions”). These reference values are
obtained from the VTEC map that isDtmaps ahead from the
last input VTEC map. Thus, t is the integer temporal index
for each input VTEC map. Note that the linear regression
coefficients are calculated independently for each DCT
coefficient and for each of the VTEC maps to be predicted.
[15] The training process has to be configured in 13

independent ways because the predicted product includes
13 VTEC maps as it is encapsulated in IONEX format. Thus,
the regression coefficients are calculated considering that
the distance Dt between the last VTEC map in each training
subset and the reference can be 12 to 24 maps ahead. Note
that for the two days ahead forecast on day T, the prediction
model is executed using input products until day T − 2 (see
the third paragraph in this section 2). Nevertheless, the last
input VTECmap is the one at 00 UT on day T − 1. Therefore,
the prediction for 00 UT on day T is 12 maps ahead and the
prediction for 00 UT on day T + 1 is 24 maps ahead.

[17] Finally, each predicted value is computed by per-
forming a dot product between the coefficients wp,q and the
sequence of DCT coefficients (input vector xp,q), as can be

[18] The resulting UPC Predicted product is automatically
generated on a daily basis and is designated as U2PG, which
is compatible with the IONEX naming convention. Note
that the predicted product for day T uses information until
day T − 2 and it is computed and made publicly available on
day T − 1 before midday (following SMOS mission request).

3. Results

3.1. Test Data

[19] As mentioned before, the final, rapid and preliminary
predicted IGS products for the different IAACs and their
combined products were used as test data. And an alternative
approach, termed the “frozen” or time‐invariant ionosphere
method in which no prediction model is applied, was also
considered for comparative purposes. In this last case, the
prediction relies directly on the raw VTEC values provided
by the Final/Rapid IGS product produced two days before.
The Rapid product for T − 2, which is made available at
CDDIS on day T − 1, is directly considered as the Time‐
invariant ionosphere product for day T (no prediction being
applied; ionosphere is considered frozen for two days). Note
that this internal product is designated as UPR2. Also, Time‐
invariant products for CODE, ESA, JPL and IGS are generated
internally (namedCOR2,ESR2, JPR2 and IGR2, respectively).
In cases where Rapid IGS products are not generated, the
corresponding Final IGS products are used instead (for
instance, the Time‐invariant product for UPC would be des-
ignated UPC2).

3.2. Reference Data

[20] As mentioned before, the UPC post‐processed maps
corresponding to the UPC Final IGS product (UPCG) are
used as reference data. Additionally, the combined Final and
Rapid IGS products (IGSG and IGRG, respectively), are taken
into account since they provide the most accurate ionospheric
VTEC values at a global scale when using GNSS data. The
suitability and reliability of the above mentioned products in
representing ionospheric VTEC have been demonstrated in
previous years [Hernández‐Pajares et al., 2009]. In this way,
IGS products are widely used in the scientific community.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that combined Final and
Rapid IGS products are not totally independent because UPC
Final and Rapid products are used to generate these products.
Note that the combined VTEC maps have a better perfor-

mance than the individual products because systematic errors
are partially filtered thanks to the combination process [see
Orús et al., 2007].
[21] Additionally, an external source of global VTEC

measurements is recorded with the dual‐frequency altimeter
instrument on board the JASON spacecraft, which was
launched on December 7, 2001. The VTEC observables
provided by these altimetry data can fill data coverage gaps
over the oceans between latitudes of 66°N and 66°S (this
restriction is given through the inclination of the JASON
orbit), where no permanent GNSS receivers can be placed. In
this way, JASON provides independent reference data that
can be used to evaluate the performance of GNSS‐derived
VTEC maps over the oceans except in the polar regions.
[22] JASON data have been used to validate Final IGS

products [Hernández‐Pajares et al., 2009]. In this respect, two
considerations have to be taken into account. First, JASON
VTEC measurements are very accurate but are affected by an
offset with respect to the IGS products [Azpilicueta and
Brunini, 2008; Hernández‐Pajares, 2004]. In this regard, it
should be noted that the GPS constellation orbits the earth
at an altitude of ffi 20200 km. Therefore, GPS VTEC
observations for receiver‐satellite pairs include the plasma-
spheric contribution, in contrast to the case of JASON that
orbits at an altitude of ffi 1300 km. Second, this is a pessi-
mistic scenario because JASON direct measurements are
compared with interpolated values at the same exact location
derived from the nearby grid points of the VTEC map being
validated. And it is likely that even the VTEC at these grid
points had to be interpolated from insufficient real data due to
the lack of permanent GNSS stations over the oceans.
[23] As a final remark, JASON VTEC data are made

publicly available from year 2003 through the FTP site of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration‐Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (NASA‐JPL) Physical Oceanography
Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC; http://podaac.
jpl.nasa.gov).

3.3. Performance Tests

[24] As a first validation of the results, the UPC Predicted
product is compared to the UPC Final IGS product, which
includes the most accurate post‐processed VTEC data that
UPC provides. As mentioned before, a long time series of
UPC IGS products is used as input dataset for the training
process. Therefore, the model is specifically designed to
predict the UPC Final VTEC values as accurately as possible
(Figure 2).
[25] Table 1 shows the bias, standard deviation, root mean

square (RMS) and the minimum and maximum values of the
differences between the predicted UPC VTEC maps and the
UPC Final IGS VTEC maps for the periods being investi-
gated. Its main purpose is to determine whether there is an
offset or a deviation that is systematically affecting all of the
values of the VTEC maps. Histograms on a semi‐logarithmic
scale are also provided (Figures 4 and 5) as they reflect the
behavior of the model at the tails of the data distribution,
which correspond to the areas with the worst prediction per-
formance (i.e., details of the extreme values are emphasized
and an idea of how likely they are is given).
[26] As a second validation, a test against theVTEC records

provided by the JASON altimeter instrument is used to verify
that the predicted product is consistent with an external

GARCÍA‐RIGO ET AL.: GLOBAL PREDICTION OF IONOSPHERIC VTEC RS0D25RS0D25

VTEC data source. The purpose of this test is to show that the
prediction performs well in modeling the real VTEC and not
only the VTEC of the corresponding UPC Final IGS product.
This test is also sensitive to the quality of the input data used
in the prediction model.
[27] In this case, Table 2 shows the bias, standard deviation,

RMS, the minimum and maximum values, and the number
of comparisons of the differences between the UPC Final/
Predicted/Time‐invariant products and the JASON VTEC
determinations. Furthermore, plots of the bias and standard
deviation in terms of the geomagnetic latitude are provided
(Figures 6 and 7) to quantify and show where the prediction
systematically over‐ or underestimates VTEC. When mul-
tiple test products are considered, these plots allow for easier
comparisons than with two‐dimensional bias or standard
deviation maps (see Figure 3). In this case, a whole map
would have to be included for each product rather than
including only one graph for the maps to compare. Last but
not least, these plots can be useful for determining whether
the peaks of the ionospheric anomaly have been correctly
determined. For instance, this can be of great interest to
identify whether the prediction model is providing exces-
sively smoothed predicted VTEC values.
[28] Finally, a comparison between the preliminary IGS

predicted products and the JASON VTEC values is per-

formed for the different IAACs. This test is of interest to
performance comparisons between the UPC Predicted
product and the predicted products produced by the other
IAACs (not to comparisons between prediction methods). It
is also useful to first evaluate the two days ahead combined
IGS Predicted product (I2PG).
[29] For this purpose, boxplots of the differences between

the predicted products and JASONVTEC values are depicted
(Figure 8). The boxplots allow the distribution of the results
to be summarized for the different prediction methods in a
simplified and compact way by observing the quartiles (see
labels on the rightmost boxplot in Figure 8) as well as the
smallest and largest daily standard deviation observations.
Remember that the lower quartile (designated as Q1) is the
threshold for the lowest 25% values in the range of results,
Q2 corresponds to the median and Q3 is used to indicate the
highest 25% of data. Note that, in this work, the boxplots
were computed following the Tukey method [Hoaglin et al.,
1983].

3.4. Selected Periods

[30] One month of data has been analyzed for each of the
years from 2004 to 2006, as well as 115 days in 2010. In this
way, representative datasets have been selected to cover
conditions of both low and high solar and geomagnetic
activity. Although data from the maximum activity period of
the 23rd Solar Cycle has not been considered, the effects
derived from certain solar flares and geomagnetic storms are
present during all the three selected periods. Nevertheless, it
should be stated that the correct predictability of impulsive
events is not the current concern of the UPC prediction
model and can be the subject of further research.
[31] In 2004, the month of August was analyzed, i.e., from

day of year 214 to 244. This period corresponds to medium
solar cycle conditions. Nevertheless, the geomagnetic activity
was strong at the end of the month due to a solar storm and
two X‐class flares were recorded by the Geostationary Oper-
ational Environmental Satellite (GOES [Hill et al., 2005])
on days 226 and 231. In fact, the Kp index ranged from 0 to
7 with a mean value of approximately 1.76 and its maximum
value at 00–03 UT on day 244. At that time, the IGS did not
provide Rapid products so the Time‐invariant product has
been generated using the corresponding UPC Final IGS
products (UPC2).
[32] A second period is selected (December, 2006) for the

minimum solar cycle conditions. In this case, the Kp index
ranged from 0 to 8.3 with a mean value of 2.25 and its
maximum value at 00–03 UT at day 349. In addition, a
geomagnetic storm occurred on day 348, and three X‐class
flares were recorded by GOES on days 340, 347 and 348.

Also in this case, Time‐invariant VTEC maps are generated
using UPC Final IGS products.
[33] The period in 2010 covers 115 days from day of year

184 to 355. Here, performance comparisons could be made
with the other IAACs predicted products for the exact same
period. During this time interval, a geomagnetic storm
happened on days 215–216, but no powerful X‐class solar
flares were recorded by GOES. The Kp index ranged from
0 to 6.7, with a mean value of 1.24 and its maximum at
00–03 UT on day 216.
[34] Note that the selected days in 2010 are not consecu-

tive, as days for which rapid/predicted/time‐invariant pro-
ducts of each IAAC center and the combined IGS products
were not available were discarded. Additionally, days where
there were a low number of JASON observations (in this
work, less than 10,000 observations) were also discarded.

Furthermore, it is also required that the combined IGS Pre-
dicted product for two days ahead (I2PG) was generated
using the three individual predicted products from CODE,
ESA and UPC. In this regard, the first day in which all three
products were combined was day of year 184 in 2010. Taking
these factors into account, a total of 115 days were selected
between days 184 and 355 in 2010.

3.5. Test Against UPC Final IGS Product

[35] In Table 1, the differences between the UPC Predicted/
Time‐invariant products (the test data) and the UPCFinal IGS
product (the reference data) are compared for the three
selected periods. The bias, standard deviation, RMS and
minimum and maximum values are included expressed in
TEC units or TECUs (1 TECU is equivalent to 1016 el/m2), as
well as the number of comparisons.

Figure 4. Histogram on a semi‐logarithmic scale of the differences between UPC predicted/Time‐invariant
VTEC values and the UPC Final IGS VTEC values (U2PG versusUPCG andUPC2 versusUPCG, respec-
tively) for the periods from days (a) 214–244, 2004 and (b) 335–365, 2006.

[36] In this table, the UPC prediction model systematically
provides better results than the Time‐invariant product in a
solar‐fixed reference frame. In fact, the RMS of the differ-
ences between the UPC Time‐invariant product and the UPC
Final IGS product (UPR2/UPC2 versus UPCG) is 10.92%,
18.50% and 16% worse than the RMS of the differences for
UPC Predicted product (for 2004, 2006 and 2010 periods,
respectively). Regarding the bias over all grid points in each
interval, a systematic under‐ or overestimation cannot be
confirmed. The UPC prediction model tends to overestimate
VTEC in the 2004 interval while it underestimates VTEC in
the 2010 interval.
[37] It is also interesting to look at the histograms of the

above mentioned comparisons. In Figures 4 and 5, the his-
tograms of the differences between the UPC Predicted/
Time‐invariant products and the UPC Final IGS products
(U2PG versus UPCG and UPR2/UPC2 versus UPCG,
respectively) are plotted. For the selected periods, the results
for the UPC Predicted product show lower residual values
than for the UPC Time‐invariant ionosphere. Both the
negative and positive tails of the distributions finish at lower
values for the UPC Predicted product (see also Table 1). A
significant improvement is obtained looking at the relative
differences between the maximum values of the UPC Pre-
dicted product and the Time‐invariant product. The Time‐
invariant maximum values are 48.35 %, 122.31 % and
49.77 % higher than the Predicted ones (in 2004, 2006 and
2010 periods, respectively), while the minimum values also
experience higher values but in a lower proportion.
[38] These results are caused by the disturbed conditions

affecting the three selected periods. Although such effects
cannot be predicted, the UPC Predicted product is more
robust against them than the Time‐invariant product. This is
because the disturbed VTEC values are directly used to
generate the Time‐invariant product two days afterwards
(for T + 2). In contrast, the UPC Predicted product is gen-

erated taking into account a set of seven VTEC files as input
dataset so that the impact two days afterwards is lower (see
section 2).
[39] The histograms in 2004 interval (Figure 4a) show an

important asymmetry affecting the negative values (under-
estimation of VTEC). This is due to the increase in VTEC
related to the storm that occurred at the end of August, 2004,
which is not predicted. The histograms in 2006 interval
(Figure 4b) show that the UPC Predicted product histogram
(U2PG versus UPCG) is asymmetrical with a higher number
of samples on the negative side due to the underestimation
of VTEC for the disturbed period on day 348. On the other
hand, the Time‐invariant histogram (UPC2 versus UPCG)
is symmetrical because the underestimation on day 348 is
compensated by the corresponding overestimation on day
350 (as the UPCTime‐invariant product is generated from the
disturbed UPC Final IGS product). Finally, for the 115 days
in 2010 (Figure 5), the histograms show a sudden decrease in
the positive tail related to the days not taken into account
(remember that the selected daysmay not be consecutive) that
are close to the most disturbed days in the period being
considered.

3.6. Test Against JASON Data

[40] For the external validation with JASON, bias, standard
deviation, RMS and the number of comparisons are shown in
Table 2. In this table, the combined Final IGS product and
the UPC Final IGS product against the JASON VTEC values
are shown as reference (IGSG versus JASON and UPCG
versus JASON, respectively). The standard deviation, which
is not affected by the JASON offset (see section 3.2), and
RMS results obtained in cases where the UPC prediction
model is applied are systematically better than for the time‐
invariant ionosphere approach.
[41] On the one hand, the standard deviation results of

the differences between UPC Predicted products and the

Figure 5. Histogram of the differences between the UPC predicted/Time‐invariant VTEC values and the
UPC Final IGS VTEC values (U2PG versus UPCG and UPR2 versus UPCG, respectively) on a semi‐
logarithmic scale, shown for the 115 day period from days 184–355, 2010.

JASON reference data (U2PG versus JASON) are 27.39%,
33.09% and 27.97% worse than that of UPC Final IGS
product (UPCG versus JASON) for the 2004, 2006 and
2010 periods, respectively. On the other hand, the standard
deviation results for the UPC Time‐invariant products
(UPR2/UPC2 versus JASON) are 32.48%, 49.64% and
38.31% worse than that of the UPC Final IGS product
(UPCG versus JASON) for the three periods. In this way,
the percentage of improvement, which is the decrease in
the variability with respect to JASON, is 5.09 %, 16.55 %
and 10.34 % for the three periods. Apart from that, the bias
results show that all IGS VTEC values are underestimated
with respect to the JASON ones. This is compatible with
the offset affecting JASON (see section 3.2).

3.6.1. Latitudinal Behavior
[42] The dependence of model performance on the geo-

magnetic latitude is studied for the different IAACs as well
as for the IGS combination for the period in 2010. The
latitudinal behavior of the VTEC predictions can be ana-
lyzed; for example, this can be accomplished by plotting the
bias and standard deviation values in multiple geomagnetic
latitude bins (of two degrees in this work) when comparing
these values with external JASON data.
[43] In Figure 6a, the bias of the differences between the

predicted products and the JASON data is depicted. In it, the
plasmaspheric component of the VTEC clearly affects GNSS
measures at low latitudes and thus produces the typical
(inverted) U shape in terms of the latitude [Aragón‐Angel,

Figure 6. (a) Bias) and (b) standard deviation of the differences between the IGS, CODE, ESA and UPC
two days ahead predicted products and the JASON data (I2PG versus JASON, C2PG versus JASON,
E2PG versus JASON and U2PG versus JASON; dotted lines). The assessed values were in two degrees
geomagnetic latitude bins for the 115 day period from days 184–355, 2010. The differences between the
combined Final IGS product and JASON data are also included as reference (IGSG versus JASON; con-
tinuous line).

2010]. Note that the bias of the differences between UPC
Predicted product and JASON data (U2PG versus JASON)
experiences a decrease in the equatorial region centered at
−6 degrees. This VTEC underestimation is also present in
the bias of the differences obtained from the UPC Rapid
IGS products (UPRG versus JASON; not plotted). In this
regard, note that UPC Rapid IGS products are used as the
input dataset for the UPC prediction model to generate the
UPC predicted VTEC maps (see section 2). This issue will
have to be further investigated in the future.
[44] In Figure 6b, the standard deviation of the differences

are plotted showing a clear correlation with the effect of the
Appleton‐Hartree equatorial anomaly. In particular, higher
standard deviation values are obtained when modeling the
anomaly in the Southern Hemisphere.

[45] First of all, the behavior of the differences between
the combined IGS Predicted product and the JASON data
(I2PG versus JASON) is quite similar to the differences
between the combined IGS Final product and the JASON
data (IGSG versus JASON; used as a point of reference).
This shows the importance of the combination process as the
performance of the combined IGS Predicted product is
better than the individual predicted products. Additionally,
the UPC Predicted product shows a good overall standard
deviation performance compared to the results obtained
from CODE and ESA Predicted products. Nevertheless,
VTEC is still underestimated when modeling the Southern
Hemisphere peak. This feature seems to be related to the
decrease in the bias that can be seen in Figure 6a.
[46] In Figure 7a, the standard deviation in terms of the

latitude band is shown for the differences between UPC

products and the JASON data. (a) IGSG/I2PG/IGR2 versus JASON. (b) UPCG/U2PG/UPR2 versus
JASON. The assessed values were in two degrees geomagnetic latitude bins for the 115 day period from
days 184–355, 2010.

Final/Predicted/Time‐invariant product and the JASON data
(UPCG/U2PG/UPR2 versus JASON). The UPC Predicted
product systematically yields better results than for the
UPC Time‐invariant ionosphere. In Figure 7b, the combined
IGS Predicted product (I2PG versus JASON) behavior is
shown and yields to slightly better results than for the IGS
Time‐invariant ionosphere.
3.6.2. Boxplots
[47] The boxplot is a parametric representation that sum-

marizes graphically the important statistics of a sample. This
allows to grasp the important features of the distribution (for
a more detailed description of this tool, see the last para-
graph in section 3.3). Figure 8 shows the boxplots for the

GNSS VTEC map sources under consideration, i.e., IGS as
well as the IAACs providing predicted products, against
JASON data. For each of these products, three types of data
are plotted for comparison: the IGS and IAACs official Rapid
products (on the left hand side for each case; indicated with a
dotted green line), the preliminary predicted products (in the
center; a continuous red line) and the Time‐invariant products
(on the right; a dotted blue line). Note that the rapid products
are being used rather than the final ones to show the vari-
ability of the most recent VTEC maps used to generate the
predictions (at least in the UPC case).
[48] The results show that there is a strong dependence

on the performance of the corresponding rapid products.

time‐invariant test data and the JASON reference data for the 115 day period from days 184–355,

boxplots for each test source on the x‐axis. Test data include CODE, ESA, UPC, JPL and combined IGS
rapid products, preliminary predicted products, and time‐invariant products (generated internally), if
available.

Applying a prediction model leads to better results than does
the use of the time‐invariant ionosphere for all of the indi-
vidual products that are taken into account. In addition,
applying a prediction model generates an increase in the
data dispersion which is, in general, lower than the disper-
sion observed in the time‐invariant ionosphere VTEC maps.
[49] In the case of the differences between the UPC Pre-

dicted product and JASON reference data (U2PG versus
JASON), the obtained standard deviation is lower than that
observed for the other IAACs for the analyzed dataset of
115 days in 2010. Note that the standard deviation values
for the differences between UPC Predicted product and
JASON (U2PG versus JASON) and the differences obtained
from a CODE Predicted product for two days ahead forecast
(C2PG versus JASON) are clearly better than that observed
for the corresponding time‐invariant VTEC values (i.e.,
UPR2 versus JASON and COR2 versus JASON). It should
also be noted that the standard deviation boxplot displays a
slightly lower median (Q2 quartile) for the UPC Predicted
product than for the combined IGS Predicted product.
Regarding the bias boxplots, which are depicted in Figure 8a,
the differences for the UPC Predicted product (U2PG versus
JASON) and the ESA Predicted product (E2PG versus
JASON) indicate a similar performance compared to the cor-
responding Time‐invariant products (UPR2 versus JASON
and ESR2 versus JASON). In the case of the CODE Predicted
products, the bias results show a larger dispersion but a lower
median.
[50] Regarding the combined forecast product, the differ-

ences between the combined IGS Predicted product and the
JASON data (I2PG versus JASON) indicate a slightly better
performance compared to the corresponding Time‐invariant
product (IGR2 versus JASON) based on the standard devia-
tion values. However, the bias results are worse, as can be
seen in Figure 8a. This is of great importance because it
indicates that using IGS Time‐invariant prediction (IGR2)
may lead to better results than considering the combined
IGS Predicted product. This could be related to the
weighting scheme that has been applied during the combi-
nation process [see Orús et al., 2007]. For the period under
consideration, this may be related to the bias performance of
the JPL products as there is no predicted product provided by
JPL. Note that the JPL Rapid IGS product (JPRG) and the
Time‐invariant product (JPR2) have also been added for
reference. In this regard, it seems that the future availability of
a JPL predicted product could further improve the combined
product.

4. Conclusions and Further Steps

[51] The use of representative datasets has demonstrated
that the UPC prediction model works well, particularly
when results are compared with those obtained by other
IAACs. This study shows that applying a prediction model
leads to better results than the use of time‐invariant iono-
sphere for two days ahead predictions. These conclusions
can be extended to the prediction models of CODE and ESA
as well. Nevertheless, the predicted products still have the
potential for further improvements to achieve better results.
The results obtained here suggest that the inclusion of a
potential future predicted product from JPL could be of
great importance. In this way, the accuracy of the combined

IGS predicted product could be increased significantly. In
addition, it might be possible to apply a prediction model
directly to the IGS final/rapid products, although this may
deviate from the philosophy of IGS of combining several
independent products.
[52] We would like to emphasize the fact that this first

UPC Predicted product has been automatically generated and
uploaded to the IGS main server since September 2009
without major problems. In this context, another improve-
ment for the near future is to make the generation of the
predicted UPC VTEC maps more robust against corrupted
files in the input dataset of the model. Such files would
penalize the performance of the predicted VTEC products if
undetected.
[53] Currently, the prediction of TEC disturbances induced

by geomagnetic storms, solar flares and other impulsive
events is not yet accounted for in the UPC prediction model
design. Nevertheless, the handling of these phenomena
should be a key priority in future. In this regard, tests feeding
the UPC predictionmodel with physical information including
indexes of solar/geomagnetic activity, such as Kp and Solar
Flux, are currently being conducted. Also in this context, a
detector of solar flares facing the earth that may be used to
input additional physical information into the prediction
model has been developed by the authors [see García‐Rigo
et al., 2008, 2006]. Apart from that, further improvement
could be obtained by using a geomagnetic grid rather than a
geographic one or by using a subset of the regression coef-
ficients (for instance, they could be determined by feature
selection [Hastie et al., 2001]).
[54] Another key point in assessing UPC prediction model

performance should be its comparison with Klobuchar,
NeQuick and the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI),
among other models [see, e.g., Klobuchar, 1986; Nava
et al., 2008; Bilitza, 2001].
[55] Last but not least, the future multifrequency/

multiconstellation GNSS scenario, as well as the deployment
of more permanent GNSS stations distributed worldwide
within the IGS framework, will enable the generation of
improved UPC Final/Rapid VTEC maps. Consequently,
better predicted products could be released in case these
products are used as input data for the prediction models, as
is the case of the UPC prediction model.
