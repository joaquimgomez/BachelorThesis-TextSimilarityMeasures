Abstract: Biosensors are small analytical devices incorporating a biological recognition element
and a physico-chemical transducer to convert a biological signal into an electrical reading.
Nowadays, their technological appeal resides in their fast performance, high sensitivity and
continuous measuring capabilities; however, a full understanding is still under research. This paper
aims to contribute to this growing field of biotechnology, with a focus on Glucose-Oxidase
Biosensor (GOB) modeling through statistical learning methods from a regression perspective.
We model the amperometric response of a GOB with dependent variables under different
conditions, such as temperature, benzoquinone, pH and glucose concentrations, by means of several
machine learning algorithms. Since the sensitivity of a GOB response is strongly related to these
dependent variables, their interactions should be optimized to maximize the output signal, for
which a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing are used. We report a model that shows a good
generalization error and is consistent with the optimization.

1. Introduction

An electrochemical biosensor (see Figure 1) is an analytical device, which contains a biological
recognition element in direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transducer, to obtain a measurable
analytically-useful electrical signal by coupling biochemical and electrochemical events [1]. A number
of variables affect the response of an electrochemical biosensor and therefore the biosensor
analytical performance, including electrode variables (material, area and geometry), electrical variables
(voltage, current, charge, impedance), electrolyte variables (bulk concentration, pH, solvent),
reaction variables (kinetic and thermodynamic parameters) and external variables (temperature,
pressure and time) [2]. Taking into account that the electrochemical biosensor response results from
the overall interactions among dependent variables, statistical modeling is an efficient tool to predict,
describe and optimize the electrochemical biosensor response and its analytical characteristics.

Most of the mathematical approaches have aimed at modeling the sensor response as a function
of the kinetic behavior of the electrochemical biosensors. For example, Blaedel et al. [3] developed
the first noteworthy model describing quantitatively the kinetic behavior of simple idealized

enzyme sensors. It was applied to the treatment of the potentiometric response of urease electrodes.
Using digital simulation, Mell and Maloy [4] modeled the steady-state current response of the
amperometric stationary enzyme electrodes. Nevertheless, the lack of exactly defined boundary
conditions to describe the mass transport restrains its application. Taking advantage of the well-known
diffusion behavior of the rotating disk electrode, Shu and Wilson [5] demonstrated that the steady-state
current response of the resultant amperometric enzyme sensor is in accordance, under mass transport
limiting conditions at low substrate concentrations, with the Levich equation for the rotating disk
electrodes [6]. Under catalysis-controlled conditions, the transfer function of the biosensor complies
with the Michaelis-Menten equation [7].

Figure 1. Electrochemical biosensor: the analyte is recognized by the bioreceptor followed by detection
by the transducer, producing a measurable electric signal.

Other techniques include methods to model the biosensor response by the analytical solution
of partial differential equations, applicable to simple biocatalytic processes, as well as digital
modeling using complex biocatalytical conversions, multi-part transducers’ geometry, and biocatalytic
membrane structure; these are extensively reviewed by Baronas et al. [8] and Bartlett et al. [9].
More recently, Rangelova et al. [10] and Alonso et al. [11] demonstrated the potential of the
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach to electrochemical biosensor response modeling.
Another promising method for analyzing overlapped signals, which cannot be calibrated and modeled
by linear expressions, seems to be that of Support Vector Machines (SVM), displaying in general
comparable to or better performance than ANNs and other statistical models [12].

The principle of the operation of the first-, second- and third-generation electrochemical biosensors
for glucose determination, as well as their analytical performances, advantages and drawbacks are
comprehensively described in the literature; see, e.g., [13–17]. The second generation amperometric
GOB is well suited for blood glucose determination, since the oxygen dependence and the interference
of the other components of the biological fluids are avoided. The challenges ahead rely on the
development of biosensors with improved characteristics and optimized response for continuous
glucose monitoring and point-of-care testing to better control and manage diabetes mellitus [13–15,18].

In this work, statistical Machine Learning (ML) regression models were chosen and applied
as powerful techniques for estimating the current response of an amperometric second-generation
glucose-oxidase biosensor (GOB), using p-benzoquinone as the electron-transfer mediator. Its function
is based on the following enzymatic and electrochemical reactions:

β-D-Glucose + GODox −−→ D-Gluconic acid + GODred
GODred + 2Mox −−→ GODox + 2Mred

2Mred −−→ 2Mox + 2e−

where GODred and GODox are the reduced and oxidized forms of the enzyme glucose-oxidase and Mred
and Mox are the reduced and oxidized forms of the mediator. The analytical signal is the current of
Mred oxidation, which is proportional to the glucose concentration.

2. ML Models for Regression

Let Y denote the response (or target) variable and f (x1, x2, . . . , xp) the underlying p-variate
function that represents the interaction between the predictors. The statistical Machine Learning (ML)
perspective substitutes the f function by predefined algorithms with configurable parameters,
leaving aside the task to establish complex mathematical relationships. The field offers a wide spectrum
of regression models, which can be cast in some specific areas:

• Parametric linear models attempt to find a function defined by:

f̂ (x) = β0 +
p

∑
j=1

xjβj (1)

where the objective is to find the β coefficients (or parameters) by means of some optimization criterion.
• Parametric non-linear regression finds a function that is a non-linear combination of the model

parameters. For example, for p = 1:

f̂ (x) = β0 + β1x
2 + β2x

3 + β3 sin(β4x) (2)

• Semi-parametric regression, in which the predictor does not follow a predetermined form or
definition; for example, a regression tree.

In the following sections, the chosen statistical regression models, intended to model the biosensor
response in terms of some input variables, will be explained.

2.1. Partial Least Squares

Partial Least Squares (PLS) is considered a dimension reduction method, which identifies a new
set of features Z1, . . . , Zm that are linear combinations of the original, then fits a linear model through
least squares by using the m new features [19]. Let X be the inputs or predictors and Ŷ the prediction;
X and Ŷ are decomposed into the following matrices:

X = TP′ and Ŷ = TBC′ (3)

where T is the score matrix; P, C are the loadings (or weights) of X, Y, respectively; and B is a
diagonal matrix. These new latent variables are sorted according to the amount of variance of Ŷ that
they explain, very much as in principal component analysis. Rewriting now Ŷ as a regression model:

Ŷ = TBC′ = XBPLS (4)

with
BPLS = (P

′)†BC′ (5)

where (P′)† is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of P′.

2.2. Artificial Neural Networks

ANN are inspired by the biological mechanism of brain and constitute an inspiration to develop
mathematical representations of the information processing by neurons. They consist of processing
units (nodes) interconnected through a certain topology; see Figure 2. The most widespread
architecture is the feed-forward configuration, which assembles a linear combination of m fixed
non-linear basis functions with parameters φ(·; vj) of the form:

f̂ (x) = g

∑
j=1

(6)

where g is a suitable non-linear activation function (e.g., a sigmoid), or the identity in the case of
regression, and w is the vector of linear weights; the vj are the non-linear weight vectors, and b∗ is the
bias or offset. The basis functions typically have the form:

φ(x; vj) = g

(
p

∑
k=1

vjkxk + bj

)
(7)

Figure 2. A simple graphical representation of a neural network.

Besides its formal definition, a neural network involves also the optimization procedure: once the
output has been computed, the error, i.e., the difference between the predicted value and the observed
value, is back-propagated. These error signals are then used to adjust the weights by a number of
strategies; in this paper, we use a Levenberg-Marquardt method.

2.3. Support Vector Machines

The Support Vector Machine for Regression (SVMR) has become a popular tool for the modeling
of non-linear regression tasks [20]. The SVMR is a nonlinear kernel-based method, which attempts
to estimate a regression hyperplane f̂ with a small risk in a high-dimensional feature space.
Unlike the classical least-squares solution for linear fitting, SVMR tries to minimize the ε-insensitive
loss function. This imposes a linear penalty when the value of the estimate f̂ (x) with respect to the
corresponding observed y is off-target by ε or more, as | · |ε = max{0, | · | − ε}, usually leading to
sparser representations, entailing both algorithmic and representational advantages [21].

Let H be a real RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space) with kernel κ. The input data are
transformed with a feature map Φ : X → H, to obtain the new dataset {(Φ(xi), yi)}Ni=1, where X is
the input space. In an SVMR, the aim is to find a function f̂ : 〈Φ(x), w〉H + b, for some w ∈ H and
b ∈ R, which is as flat as possible and deviates a maximum of ε from the given target values yi, for all
i = 1, . . . , N.

The usual formulation of the optimization problem is as the dual of the convex quadratic program:

for i = 1, . . . , N. To solve Equation (8), one considers the dual problem derived by the Lagrangian:

3. Experimental Work

3.1. Biosensor Data

The GOB used incorporates a p-benzoquinone-mediated amperometric graphite electrode
with covalently-linked glucose-oxidase. The mediator is responsible for the electronic transfer
between the enzyme and the electrode surface. Additionally, the following reagents were used:
glucose-oxidase (E.C. 1.1.3.4. from Aspergillus, 1000 U/mg), N-cyclohexyl-N’-[2-(methylmorpholino)ethyl]
carbodiimide-4-toluenesulfonate (Merk) and glucose. Amperometric data acquisition was achieved
using a Radelkis OH-105 polarograph. The amperometric or electrical response was analyzed under
different conditions of the glucose (in mmol/L), pH, temperature (in degrees Celsius) and concentration
of the mediator, the p-benzoquinone (in mmol/L). Measured values for these input variables are
described in Table 1.

The resulting data file consists of 320 rows (observations) and five columns: four predictive
variables and a continuous target variable, which corresponds to the biosensor amperometric response,
measured in mA. The predictive variables (glucose, p-benzoquinone, temperature and pH) are available
for all combinations of input values in Table 1. All of the variables (except the GOB response) are
standardized to zero mean, unit standard deviation. Finally, the data file is shuffled to avoid predefined
ordering biases.

3.2. Experimental Settings

The dataset was randomly partitioned into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). The training
phase was conducted by 30 × 10 cross-validation (30 times of 10-fold cv). The true generalization
capacity was assessed by evaluating the trained models in the test set. The performance measure used
was the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE):

where ei are the residuals and hii the leverage of observation xi. Three regression algorithms were
used in the biosensor response prediction, the Partial Least Squares algorithm (PLS), a Support Vector
Machine for Regression with Linear (SVMR-Lin) and Radial Basis Function (SVMR-RBF) kernels and
an ANN for regression with the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation method. Optimal parameters
were selected by grid search as follows: the SVMR complexity parameter ε and the RBF smoothing
parameter γ were varied logarithmically in 2−6 . . . 26 and 10−1.5 . . . 101.5, respectively; for the ANN,
the number of hidden layers was fixed to four neurons.

3.3. Hardware and Software

The models and experiments were coded in the MATLAB R© language, Version 2012a, and run
on an Ubuntu Linux server, v. 11.10, with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5620 @2.40 GHz and eight
cores. The SVMR-RBF libraries were embedded into the MATLAB environment using the LIBSVM
MATLAB R© Support Vector Machine Toolbox [22].

4. Results and Discussion

Two groups of experiments were performed, by training and testing the learning algorithms
with and without applying the natural log to the target variable. Table 2 shows the cross-validation
NRMSE for each learner, before log and log data, resp. It is clearly seen that the linear models, PLS and
the linear SVM, are outperformed by the non-linear models, the ANN and the SVMR-RBF, the latter
being the best model overall, although the difference of two models is not statistically significant:
a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing the results, in the log data, shows that the null hypothesis that
the difference between the cross-validation NRMSE medians is zero cannot be rejected at the 95% level
(p-value = 0.125). The test R2 regression coefficients are also shown. For completeness, we also display
the full test prediction plots for all models; see Figure 3.

Figure 4 details the predicted vs. observed target values for the SVMR-RBF and the ANN.
Despite most of the signal being very satisfactorily predicted, some of the points present divergences
w.r.t. the observed target values; specifically, very high peaks are in general underestimated.

To explore this phenomenon, Figure 5 shows particular sections of the target value by displaying
the observed and predicted values in the test set. The charts are formed by fixing the value of
the benzoquinone to 0.2 for different glucose values, and by fixing the value of the glucose to
four for different benzoquinone values. The X-Y axes are the temperature and pH variables, and
the vertical axis shows the target value (biosensor response). The slight differences pointed out
(for high-valued outputs) can be seen in Columns 3–4 of Figure 5.

4.1. Artificial Neural Network Model

Letting X = (X1, X2, X3, X4) represent the glucose, p-benzoquinone, temperature and pH and
Y the biosensor response, the mathematical model found by the ANN, seen graphically in Figure 6,
is assembled as (refer to the description in Section 2.2):

where m = 4 and the basis functions use the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function as g; the vector w of

5. Optimization of Experimental Conditions

The experimental results show very low prediction errors for GOB modeling through statistical
learning methods from a regression perspective. Such models would be effective in case there is an
interest in embedding them as a sub-system of other analytical processes.

These models are black boxes, in that they can be viewed solely in terms of their inputs and output,
without any knowledge of the internal workings. However, a more in-depth theoretical modeling
of the biosensor response would enable a better understanding about the importance of the factors
affecting its analytical performance in terms of dynamic linear concentration range, sensitivity and the
limit of detection, among others. Moreover, it would facilitate its optimization in a given matrix. Some
current efforts are directed toward sensitivity improvement and lowering of the limit of detection by
maximization of the biosensor response.

The sensitivity and linear concentration range of steady-state calibration curves are determined
by plotting the steady-state responses (in our case, the GOB response), possibly corrected for a blank
signal, vs. the analyte concentration (the glucose). The sensitivity is the slope of the calibration curve
and is used for the evaluation of biosensor capabilities: a more sensitive device responds to smaller
amounts or weaker signals. Thus, there is a need for analytical procedures for sensitivity maximization,
i.e., the finding of input values that yield a maximum biosensor response. Since this is seen to strongly
depend on the input variables, p-benzoquinone concentration, pH and temperature (see Figure 7),
the aim of the analyses in this section was to determine the impact and optimum values of these
individual input variables plus the glucose on the GOB response.

Figure 7. Biosensor sensitivity: dependence on the input variables, p-benzoquinone concentration,
pH and temperature.

In this vein, the two developed regression models—the ANN and the SVMR-RBF—are excellent
predictive models (aimed at generalization), but are not amendable to be optimized, in the sense
of assessing the best input values to get the maximum output. Instead, polynomial optimization
(of limited degree) is a more feasible task: once the coefficients are found, the polynomial can be
optimized by a number of methods. The idea can be summarized in the following procedure:

1. Approximate a third-degree polynomial model by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation.



Sensors 2016, 16, 1483 11 of 13

2. Maximize the polynomial as a function of the input variables.
3. Use these values to find the best output or biosensor response.

As in Section 4, letting X = (X1, X2, X3, X4) represent the glucose, p-benzoquinone, temperature
and pH and Y the biosensor response, a third order polynomial was assembled as follows:

In order to maximize p, two well-known optimization algorithms were used: a genetic algorithm
and simulated annealing, briefly described next. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a method for solving
optimization problems based on natural selection, mimicking biological evolution by borrowing
ideas from the dynamics of natural populations. It works under the assumption that the strongest
individuals will prevail through time and, hence, their best features. Given a population, the algorithm
iteratively selects individuals that represent the best characteristics of the population, as measured
by a certain fitness function. These individuals are taken as a seed to produce the next generation by
the use of genetic operators (crossover and mutation). At each step, the current population seeks to
enhance the fitness function, eventually evolving to an optimal solution [23].

Simulated Annealing (SA) is a stochastic technique inspired by statistical mechanics for finding
near globally optimum solutions to large (combinatorial) optimization problems. The algorithm works
by assuming that some part of the current solution, i.e., the input variables assigned with some real
value within their respective range, belongs to a potentially better one, and thus, this part should be
retained by exploring neighbors of the current solution; SA has the ability to jump from valley to valley
and to escape or simply avoid sub-optimal solutions [24].

Table 3. Optimum values for the predictors found by a GA, SA and evaluation of the ANN and
SVMR-RBF responses on these values. Biosensor output is in mA.

Table 3 shows the results of this optimization process; it also shows the ANN and SVMR-RBF
response when evaluated in the same solution, as a reference. Both the GA and SA show very
similar values for the polynomial model, the small difference being attributable to rounding, which
are achieved at the same readings for the inputs, a possible indication that a true maximum has
been reached. Upon evaluation of the ANN and SVMR-RBF on these values, the results are again
remarkably similar, a fact suggesting that the predictive models are essentially correct.

6. Conclusions and Future Work

Several statistical machine learning methods have been used to model the amperometric response
of a GOB. The reported experimental results show a promising very low prediction error of the
biosensor output by using artificial neural networks and support vector machines for regression. It has
also been shown that the relationship between the available predictors (temperature, benzoquinone,
pH and glucose concentration) and the response corresponds to a non-linear behavior. In biosensor
response analysis, there is sometimes a need to find the optimum predictor values, namely those
that yield a maximum response. It has been shown that a particular combination of the available
predictors is able to deliver a maximized value for the predictive models. We thus recommend the
learned SVMR-RBF model (with parameters C = 16, γ = 5.6569 and ε = 0.95) as a solid predictor of
the amperometric response.

Glucose monitoring by means of a GOB can constitute a valuable ally to diabetic patients.
GOBs are solid candidates for fast, reliable and inexpensive monitoring, in order to avoid serious
collateral chronic complications; however, their design is still under development, in order to improve
both their predictive accuracy and stability upon changing conditions. In a biosensor design scenario,
mathematical modeling is a highly promising tool, given that it facilitates computational simulations,
avoiding destructive testing, as long as time and resources permit. In this sense, the experimental
proposal and conditions offered in this paper could be applied for other scenarios in the wide spectrum
of bio-sensing technology.

Future work will include the fine-tuning of the small divergences found in the prediction of
peaks. One possible direction could be to model the signal as a wave, where it could be natural to use
nonparametric or local regression models, such as splines or wavelets [25].
