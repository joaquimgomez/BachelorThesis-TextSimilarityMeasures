Abstract  
 

In this study a new approach to quantify qualitative survey data about the direction of change is 

presented. We propose a data-driven procedure based on evolutionary computation that avoids 

making any assumption about agents’ expectations. The research focuses on experts’ 

expectations about the state of the economy from the World Economic Survey in twenty eight 

countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The proposed 

method is used to transform qualitative responses into estimates of economic growth. In a first 

experiment, we combine agents’ expectations about the future to construct a leading indicator of 

economic activity. In a second experiment, agents’ judgements about the present are combined 

to generate a coincident indicator. Then, we use index tracking to derive the optimal 

combination of weights for both indicators that best replicates the evolution of economic 

activity in each country. Finally, we compute several accuracy measures to assess the 

performance of these estimates in tracking economic growth. The different results across 

countries have led us to use multidimensional scaling analysis in order to group all economies in 

four clusters according to their performance. We obtain the best results for Belgium, Norway, 

Austria, Lithuania, Japan and the United Kingdom.

1 Introduction 

 

Economic expectations about future economic conditions are a key feature in 

macroeconomic models. Qualitative survey data on the direction of change are one of the 

main sources of agents’ expectations. Tendency surveys ask respondents whether they 

expect a wide range of variables to rise, to fall, or to remain unchanged. Survey-based 

expectations present two main advantages over experimental expectations. Apart from 

being based on the knowledge of the respondents operating in the market, they are 

available ahead of the publication of quantitative official data, which makes them very 

useful for prediction. Additionally, survey data provide detailed information about 

different economic variables, ranging from capital expenditures and private consumption 

to exports and imports. This feature makes survey expectations especially indicated for 

the design of synthetic indicators. 

One of the main drawbacks of survey-based expectations is their qualitative nature. 

With the aim of overcoming this limitation, numerous quantification methods have been 

proposed in the literature (Nardo, 2003; Driver and Urga, 2004; Pesaran and Weale, 2006; 

Vermeulen, 2014). This line of research centered in the conversion of qualitative 

responses about the expected direction of change into a quantitative measures has evolved 

in parallel with the application of new econometric techniques. 

Recent developments in empirical modelling allow to generate mathematical models 

from a given dataset. Empirical modelling has two main advantages over conventional 

approaches. On the one hand, it is especially suitable for finding patterns in large data 

sets, where little or no information is known about the system. On the other hand, 

empirical modelling allows to simultaneously evolve both the structure and the 

parameters of the model. 

In a recent study, Lahiri and Zhao (2015) examine the quality of quantified 

expectations by comparing them to quantitative realizations at the firm-level, obtaining 

significant improvements when relaxing the assumptions of quantification methods of 

qualitative survey data, particularly during periods of uncertainty, with high levels of 

disagreement between respondents. 

These findings have led us to look for a data-driven assumption-free approach to 

transform survey measures of agents’ expectations into quantitative estimates. We aim to 

break new ground in the quantification of survey responses on the direction of change by 



3 

 

presenting a new method based on the implementation of recent developments in 

evolutionary computation to qualitative survey data. 

The CESIfo Institute for Economic Research elaborates World Economic Survey 

(WES), which polls experts in 123 countries about economic trends (Kudymowa et al., 

2013). We use twelve survey variables from the WES in twenty eight countries of the 

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to generate 

quantitative estimates of economic growth. In a first step, we combine and transform 

agents’ expectations about the future state of the economy. We repeat the experiment for 

agents’ judgements about the present state of the economy. As a result, we derive a 

leading indicator and a coincident indicator of economic activity. In a second step, we 

apply index tracking, which is a procedure used for portfolio management, to calculate 

the optimal relative weights of both indicators that best replicates the evolution of the 

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in each country. 

With the aim of examining the leading properties of these estimates of economic 

growth, we compute several accuracy measures to assess their predictive content and to 

evaluate their cyclical properties in terms of the level of synchronization with the 

quantitative variable of reference. Finally, by means of a dimensionality reduction 

technique, we synthesize all the information provided by these performance measures and 

the characteristics of the data into two factors that allow us to cluster all economies into 

four groups. 

The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section reviews the existing literature. 

In Section 3 we present the methodological approach and describe the experiment. 

Empirical results are provided in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5. 

 

 

2 Literature review 

 

2.1 Quantification of qualitative survey data 

 

The first attempt to quantify survey expectations is that of Anderson (1951, 1952), who 

proposed the balance statistic as a measure of the evolution of the quantitative variable it 

refers to. Aggregating individual replies as percentages of the respondents in each 

category, and assuming that the expected percentage change in a variable remains 

constant over time for all agents, the balance statistic is obtained as the subtraction 

between the percentage of agents reporting an increase and the percentage reporting a 



4 

 

decrease. Based on these premises, Pesaran (1984, 1985) developed this framework to 

allow for an asymmetrical relationship between individual changes and the evolution of 

the quantitative variable of reference. Using the relationship between actual values and 

respondents’ perceptions of the past as yardstick for the quantification of expectations 

about the future, the author proposed the regression approach. 

By making positive and negative individual changes dependent on past values of the 

quantitative variable of reference, Smith and McAleer (1995) proposed a non-linear 

dynamic regression model to quantify survey responses that can be regarded as an 

extension of the regression approach. A drawback of the regression approach to quantify 

survey responses is that there is no empirical evidence that agents judge past values in the 

same way as they formulate expectations about the future (Nardo, 2003). As a result, the 

regression approach is restricted to expectations of variables over which agents have 

direct control, be it prices or production. The development of this approach has also been 

conditioned by the procurement of a rationale for the application, which can only be 

obtained by means of the analysis of individual data. For an an appraisal of individual 

firm data on expectations see Zimmermann (1997). 

Theil (1952) designed a theoretical framework to generate quantitative estimates from 

the balance statistic proposed by Anderson (1951). Based on the assumption that 

respondents report a variable to go up (or down) if the mean of their subjective probability 

distribution lies above (or below) a certain level, the author defined the indifference 

threshold, also known as the difference limen. This threshold was conceived as an interval 

around zero within which respondents perceive there are no significant changes in the 

variable, and respond that the variable remains unchanged. Let ity  indicate the percentage 

change of variable itY  for agent i  from time 1t  to time t , and tR  and tF , denote the 

aggregate percentage of respondents at time 1t  expecting a variable to rise or fall at 

time t  respectively. If eity  is the unobservable expectation that agent i  has over the 

change of variable itY , the indifference interval can be defined as  itit ba , , where ita  and 

itb  are the lower and upper limits of the indifference threshold for agent i  regarding time 

t . Assuming that response bounds are symmetric and fixed both across respondents and 

over time (  itit ba , ti,  ), and that agents base their answer according to an 

independent subjective probability distribution that has the same form across respondents, 

the author generated quantitative estimates of tŷ . 



5 

 

Knöbl (1974) and Carlson and Parkin (1975) further developed the probability 

approach proposed by Theil (1952). As estimates of tŷ  are conditional on a particular 

value for the imperceptibility parameter  , and a specific form for the aggregate density 

function, Carlson and Parkin (1975) assumed that the individual density functions were 

normally distributed, and estimated   by assuming that over the sample-period tŷ  is an 

unbiased estimate of ty . Consequently, the role of   is to scale the aggregate 

expectations ety  such that the average value of ty  equals 
e
ty . Thus, using the evolution 

of the observed variable as a yardstick qualitative responses can be transformed into 

quantitative estimates. 

Fishe and Lahiri (1981), Batchelor (1982), Visco (1984), and Foster and Gregory 

(1987) used alternative distributions. There is inconclusive evidence on the type of 

probability distribution aggregate average expectations come from. While Carlson (1975), 

Batchelor (1981), Batchelor and Dua (1987), Foster and Gregory (1987) and Lahiri and 

Teigland (1987) reject the hypothesis of normality, Dasgupta and Lahiri (1992), 

Balcombe (1996), Berk (1999) and Mitchell (2002) find evidence that normal 

distributions provide as accurate expectations as other non-normal distributions. 

Another line of research has focused on refining the probability approach by relaxing 

the assumptions symmetry and constancy of the indifference bounds. Several strategies 

have been proposed in the literature in order to introduce dynamic imperceptibility 

parameters in the probability approach. Bennet (1984), Batchelor (1986), Kariya (1990), 

and Berk (1999) made the threshold dependent on time-varying quantitative variables. 

Batchelor and Orr (1988) imposed the unbiasedness condition over predefined subperiods. 

Mitchell et al. (2007) generalized the Carlson-Parkin procedure to generate cross-

sectional and time-varying proxies of the variance. 

Using a time-varying parameter model (Cooley and Prescott, 1976) together with the 

Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960) for parameter estimation, Seitz (1988) was able to 

simultaneously introduce asymmetric and time-varying indifference thresholds. The 

author assumed that the imperceptibility parameters were subject to permanent and 

temporary shocks. Claveria et al. (2007) extended this framework by using a state-space 

representation that allowed for asymmetric and dynamic response thresholds generated 

by a first-order Markov process. 

Further improvements of quantification procedures have been developed at the micro 

level, either by means of experimental expectations generated by Monte Carlo 

simulations, or by comparing the individual responses with firm-by-firm realisations. 



6 

 

Regarding the former option, Common (1985) generated simulated expectations to test 

the rational expectations hypothesis. Nardo and Cabeza-Gutés (1999) designed a 

simulation experiment to assess the performance of the different quantification methods. 

By means of simulation-based expectations, Löffler (1999) and Terai (2009) estimated 

the measurement error introduced by the probabilistic method. Additionally, Löffler 

(1999) proposed a refinement of the Carlson-Parkin method. Claveria (2010) used 

computer-generated expectations to assess the forecasting performance of different 

quantification methods, and presented a variation of the balance statistic that took into 

account the proportion of respondents reporting that the variable remains unchanged. 

Using firm-level survey responses, Mitchell et al. (2002) developed a procedure to 

quantify individual categorical expectations based on the assumption that responses are 

triggered by a latent continuous random variable as it crosses time-varying thresholds, 

and found evidence against time invariant thresholds. By introducing the “conditional 

absolute null” property, based on the empirical finding that the median of realized 

quantitative values corresponding to the “no change” category is zero, Müller (2010) 

proposed a variant of the Carlson-Parkin method with asymmetric and time invariant 

thresholds, which allows to solve the zero response problem that occurs when all 

respondents fall into one of the extreme responses (an increase or a decrease). 

The variation of the indifference thresholds across individuals can only be tested by 

means of the analysis of individual expectations. Using a matched sample of qualitative 

and quantitative individual stock market forecasts, Breitung and Schmeling (2013) 

corroborated the importance of introducing asymmetric and dynamic indifference 

parameters, but found that individual heterogeneity across respondents plays a minor role 

in forecast accuracy. On the other hand, Lahiri and Zhao (2015) have recently found 

strong evidence against the threshold constancy, symmetry, homogeneity, and overall 

unbiasedness assumptions of the probability method. The authors have generalized the 

Carlson-Parkin framework by means of a hierarchical ordered probit model. Based on a 

matched sample of households, they have found that when the unbiasedness assumption 

is replaced by a time-varying calibration, the resulting quantified series is found to better 

track the quantitative benchmark. 

 

2.2 Evolutionary computation 

 

Evolutionary computation is a subfield of artificial intelligence that is increasingly being 

applied in economics in the context of expensive optimization. Evolutionary computation 



7 

 

is based on the implementation of algorithms that adopt Darwinian principles of the 

theory of natural selection to automated problem solving. These algorithms are known as 

evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Evolutionary programming was introduced by Fogel et al. 

(1966). The most popular type of EA is the genetic algorithm (GA), which was initially 

proposed by Holland (1975). Cramer (1985) developed a generalization of GAs known 

as genetic programming (GP). GP is a soft-computing search technique that allows the 

model structure to vary during the evolution, which makes it particularly indicated for 

non-linear and empirical modelling. See Poli et al. (2010) for a review of the state of the 

art in GP. 

Chen and Kuo (2002) classified the literature on the application of evolutionary 

computation to economics and finance. Most evolutionary computing in economics has 

been implemented in finance (Goldberg, 1989). On the one hand, with respect to GAs, 

Acosta-González and Fernández (2014) used a GA to predict the financial failure of firms, 

and Acosta-González et al. (2012) to explain the 2008 financial crisis. Lawrenz and 

Westerhoff (2003) modelled exchange rates with a GA. Maschek (2010) evaluated the 

performance of the self-adaptation mechanism in GAs for the convergence to the rational 

expectations equilibrium. Thinyane and Millin (2011) applied GAs to optimize the signals 

generated by technical trading tools. Vasilakis et al. (2013) presented a GP-based 

technique to predict returns in the trading of the euro/dollar exchange rate. Wei (2013) 

used an adaptive expectation GA to optimize a fuzzy model to forecast stock price trends 

in Taiwan. For a review of the applications of GAs for financial forecasting see Drake 

and Marks (2002). 

On the other hand, regarding GP, Álvarez-Díaz and Álvarez (2005) applied GP to 

predict exchange rates. Chen et al. (2008) analysed the performance of GP to financial 

trading. Kaboudan (2000), Larkin and Ryan (2008), and Wilson and Banzhaf (2009) used 

GP for stock price forecasting. Yu et al. (2004) implemented a GP approach to model 

short-term capital flows. 

Applications of GP in macroeconomics have been very limited. The first application 

of GP is that of Koza (1992), who used GP to reassess the exchange equation relating the 

price level, gross national product, money supply, and the velocity of money. Chen et al. 

(2010) applied GP in a vector error correction model for macroeconomic forecasting. 

Duda and Szydło (2011) developed economic forecasting models by means of gene 

expression programming (GEP), which can be regarded as a version of GP (Ferreria, 

2011). 



8 

 

Koza (1992) developed GP to find the best single computer program to implement 

symbolic regression (SR). SR can be regarded as a new approach to empirical modelling. 

Given a predetermined set of operations and functions, SR searches appropriate models 

from the space of all possible mathematical expressions that best fit the data. Zelinka 

(2005) introduced analytical programming in order to synthesize suitable solutions in SR. 

Due to its versatility, SR is being increasingly used in different areas: from industrial data 

analysis (Vladislavleva et al., 2010) and the experimental design of manufacturing 

systems (Can and Heavey, 2011), to signal processing (Yao and Lin, 2009) and other 

various applications (Barmpalexis et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2006; Ceperic et al., 2014; 

Sarradj and Geyer, 2014; Wu et al., 2008). 

There have been very few applications in macroeconomics. Claveria et al. (2016) 

implemented SR via GP to derive a set of building blocks used with forecasting purposes. 

Kľúčik (2012) applied SR to estimate total exports and imports to Slovakia. Kotanchek 

et al. (2010) used SR via GP for GDP forecasting. By means of SR, Kronberger et al. 

(2011) identified interactions between economic indicators in order to estimate the 

evolution of prices in the US. Yang et al. (2015) used SR for production forecasting of 

crude oil. Recently, Peng et al. (2014) have proposed an improved GEP algorithm 

especially suitable for dealing with SR problems. 

 

 

3 Data and methods 

 

3.1 Data 

 

This study matches two sources of information for twenty eight countries of the OECD: 

Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 

France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, the 

Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, 

Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). On the one hand, we use 

quantitative official statistics about the evolution of economic activity. Specifically, the 

year-on-year growth rates of quarterly GDP data from the OECD 

(https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart). The sample period goes 

from the third quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2014.  On the other hand, we use 

qualitative survey data reflecting agents’ expectations about the future, and their 

judgements about the present economic situation. 

https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart


9 

 

We focus on the main survey variables from the the WES, which assesses worldwide 

economic trends by polling professionals and experts on current economic developments 

in their respective countries (Kudymowa et al., 2013). Białowolski (2016) notes that 

professional respondents are characterized by significantly lower biases in responding to 

survey questions than consumers. Franses et al. (2011) also find evidence in favor of 

experts’ forecasts when compared with pure model forecasts. See Henzel and 

Wollmershäuser (2005), Stangl (2007), and Hutson et al. (2014) for an appraisal of the 

WES. 

Respondents are asked about the economic situation in three different forms: their 

expectation by the end of the next six months (variables 7X  to 12X ), their present 

judgement (variables 1X  to 3X ), and their assessment compared to the same time last 

year (variables 4X  to 6X ). The economic situation is assessed with respect of three 

items: the overall economy (variables 1X , 4X  and 7X ), capital expenditures (variables 

2X , 5X  and 8X ), and private consumption (variables 3X , 6X  and 9X ). Respondents 

are also asked about their expectations about the volume of exports ( 10X ), of imports 

( 11X ), and the balance of trade ( 12X ). All twelve variables are presented in Table 1.

In order to present the survey results, the Ifo uses a grading procedure which is 

conceptually equal to calculating balances: positive replies are assigned a grade of nine; 

indifferent replies, of five; and negative replies, of one. Country results are weighted 

according its share of exports and imports in total world trade (CESifo World Economic 

Survey, 2016). The Ifo also constructs an aggregate indicator obtained as the arithmetic 

mean of assessments of the general economic situation and the expectations for the 

economic situation in the next six months: the Economic Climate Indicator (ECI). The 

ECI tends to correlate closely with the actual business-cycle trend measured in annual 

growth rates of real GDP (Claveria et al., 2016; Garnitz et al., 2015).

3.2 Methods 

 

SR is based the search of relationships between a given set of variables. The major 

difference in relation to conventional regression analysis resides in the fact that while the 

former is based on a certain model specification, SR does not rely on a specific a priori 

determined model structure. The only assumption made in SR is that the response surface 

can be described by an algebraic expression. 

GP can be regarded as an extension of GAs in which the solutions are expressed in 

the form of computer programs. The main difference between them is in the 

representation of the structure: while GP codes potential solutions by means tree-

structured, variable length representations, GAs use fixed length binary string 

representations. GP’s more general representation scheme allows the model structure to 

vary during the evolution. This feature is particularly suitable in the current study, where 

the functional relationship between the set of survey variables is arbitrary and unknown. 

Consequently, we use GP to solve the SR experiment, and to transform qualitative 

survey data into quantitative estimates of economic activity, formalizing the interactions 

between a wide range of survey-based indicators. The implementation of GP for SR was 

based on the following sequence of steps: 

First – The creation of an initial population. We determined a population size of 3 

million individuals. 

Second – Determination of a fitness function. In order to evaluate the fitness of each 

member of the population we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 

Third – Determination of a strategy for the selection of parents for replacement. In 

order to guarantee the diversity in the population we use the tournament method. 

Fourth – Determination of the probability of a new generation and application of 

genetic operators to the parents. The main genetic operations are reproduction (copy), 

crossover (recombination of randomly chosen parts of parents), and mutation (random 

alteration of a part of a parent). We select a 0.1 mutation probability to prevent trapping 

into local optima. 

Fifth – Determination of constants. With the aim of avoiding the search path to deviate 

from the optimum we include the automatic generation of constants provided by the 

algorithm, which are optimized after a number of generations according to their 

correlation relative to the functional form. 



11 

 

Sixth – Determination of a stopping criterion. We set a maximum number of 150 

generations as the termination criterion. Steps three and four are repeated until a new 

generation is created. If no individual in the population has a required minimal fitness, or 

the stopping criterion is fulfilled, everything is repeated using the new generation as the 

population. As a result, the fitness of the population is ever increasing. 

The search process is characterized by a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. 

To limit the complexity of the resulting expressions, the set of functions is restricted to 

some elementary functions. We use the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms Package 

(DEAP) framework implemented in Python (Fortin et al., 2012; Gong et al., 2015). 

By matching qualitative survey indicators from the WES to quantitative official data 

in two successive SR experiments, we are able to derive two analytical expressions: one 

linking agents’ expectations about the future (variables 7X  to 12X ) to economic growth, 

and another one combining agents’ judgements about the present (variables 1X  to 6X ). 

 

 

4 Results 

 

First, we present the output of the two SR experiments undertaken. On the one hand, 

expression (1), which combines agents’ expectations about the future, and can therefore 

be regarded as a leading indicator of economic activity ( ity ,1ˆ ). On the other hand, 

expression (2), which combines agents’ judgements about the present state of the 

economy, and can be seen as a coincident indicator ( ity ,2ˆ ):

Where the sub index i  refers to each specific country at time t . In Fig. 1 we 

graphically compare the evolution of the two SR-generated indicators to that of the GDP. 

We can observe that while ity ,2ˆ  is closely correlated to the oscillations of GDP in all 

countries, ity ,1ˆ  shows a worse performance, especially since the 2008 financial crisis. 

Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014) found that the 2008 financial crisis period had led 

to a decrease in expectational errors in transition economies. Claveria et al. (2016) 

obtained a similar result for ten Eastern European countries.

In a second step, we derive estimates of economic growth by combining the 

information of both indicators. We use a procedure of constrained optimization known as 

index tracking, which is used in finance in order to replicate the performance of stock 

indexes (Karlow, 2012; Kwiatkowski, 1992; Rudd, 1980). Index tracking consists on the 

minimization of a tracking error, defined as the expected squared deviation of return from 



15 

 

that of the index, with the aim of obtaining the proportion of capital to be invested in each 

asset. Based on this premise, we use a generalized reduced gradient algorithm to minimize 

the summation of squared forecast errors. We impose two restrictions in the optimization 

process with respect to the value of the weights. First, the sum of both weights must equal 

one. Second, the non-negativity restriction, so that the weights must be equal or larger 

than zero. As a result, we obtain the optimal weights of both the leading and the coincident 

indicator for each country (Table 2).

While the obtained relative weight of the coincident indicator is higher than that of 

the leading indicator, we observe numerous differences across countries. In Greece, 

Hungary, Latvia, Romania, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia, the algorithm yields a null 

weight to the leading indicator constructed with agents’ expectations about the future. 

This result contrasts with that of Lacová and Král (2015), who found that in Slovakia 

companies are slightly more forward-looking than backward-looking. On the other 

extreme, in countries such as Norway and Japan, future expectations outweigh 

judgements about the present. This result brings up the question of whether survey-based 

indicators shall equally weight the information regarding the expectations about the future 

and the judgements about the present in all countries. 

In the literature there is no consensus on the information content of survey 

expectations. Breitung and Schmeling (2013) compared quantified stock market 



16 

 

expectations with quantitative forecasts, and found that there was a weak correlation 

between them. Lacová and Král (2015) found that quantified survey expectations in 

Slovakia systematically failed to capture changes in consumer price index. Jonsson and 

Österholm (2011, 2012), Lui et al. (2011a,b) and Maag (2009) reached similar 

conclusions. On the other hand, there is ample evidence that survey expectations provide 

useful information for economic modelling (Altug and Çakmakli, 2016; Batchelor and 

Dua, 1992, 1998; Dees and Brinca, 2013; Girardi, 2014; Hansson et al., 2005; Jean-

Baptiste, 2012; Klein and Özmucur, 2010; Leduc and Sill, 2013; Lemmens et al., 2005; 

Müller, 2009; Qiao et al., 2009; Schmeling and Schrimpf, 2011). 

In order to evaluate the performance of the resulting estimates in monitoring 

economic activity, we compute several measures of forecast accuracy: the the mean 

absolute error (MAE) and the RMSE to assess the predictive content in terms of forecast 

accuracy, the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) to compare the forecasting performance 

to a benchmark model, and the Concordance Index (CI) proposed by Harding and Pagan 

(2002) to evaluate the cyclical properties in terms of the level of synchronization with the 

quantitative benchmark variable. 

In Table 3 we present the MAE and the RMSE. We observe differences across 

countries. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, and Lithuania present the lowest MAE 

and RMSE values. On the other extreme, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and Poland are 

the economies where we obtain the least accurate predictions.

Next, we complement the assessment of the estimates by comparing them to those 

obtained with a benchmark model. With this aim, we compute the mean absolute scaled 

error (MASE) proposed by Hyndman and Koehler (2006). The idea behind the MASE is 

to scale the errors by the mean absolute errors obtained with a benchmark model. The 

MASE statistic presents several advantages over other forecast accuracy measures, as it 

is independent of the scale of the data, and it does not suffer from some of the problems 

presented by other relative measures of forecast accuracy (Hyndman and Koehler, 2006). 

An additional advantage is its easy interpretation, as values less than one indicate that the 

average prediction computed with the benchmark model is worse than the estimates 

obtained with the proposed method. If we denote te  as the forecast error, the MASE can 

be obtained as the mean of the absolute value of the scaled error

Given that official data are published with a delay of more than a quarter with respect 

to survey data, we use two-step ahead naïve forecasts as a benchmark. In Table 4 we 

present the MASE results. In Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Japan, Latvia, 

Lithuania, Norway, the Slovak Republic and the UK, the estimates of GDP obtained with 

the proposed method outperform those of the benchmark model.

In Fig. 2 we compare the obtained forecast results to the standard deviation of the 

year-on-year growth rates of GDP. There seems to be no relation between neither the 

MAE or the MASE results and the the variability of economic activity. While Estonia and 

Latvia are the countries that present the highest levels of dispersion, the forecast errors 

are low, and the opposite holds for Croatia and Poland.

As there is evidence that the trend in the Ifo’s ECI correlates closely with the actual 

business-cycle trend measured in annual growth rates of real GDP (CESifo World 

Economic Survey, 2016), next we evaluate the cyclical properties of the proposed SR-

generated estimates. We compare it with the ECI in terms of the level of synchronization. 

To that end, we use the Concordance Index (CI) proposed by Harding and Pagan (2002):

Where T  is the number of observations, ty  refers to the percentage growth rate of GDP 

and tx  to the variable under analysis. S  is a binary variable that takes value one if the 

series is in expansion, and zero otherwise. As the C index developed by Harrell et al. 

(1996), the CI is expressed as the proportion of sample periods in which the two series 

are in the same phase of the cycle. Thus, the CI allows us to assess the proposed indicator 

in terms of regime shifts.

Notes: CI stands for concordance index (Harding and Pagan, 2002). A one value indicates that the cycles of the variables 

under comparison are in the same phase one hundred percent of times. 

 

Results in Table 5 show that in most cases there are no major differences in CI values 

between both proxies. While in countries like Belgium, Finland, Hungary, the 

Netherlands, and Spain, the ECI shows a lower level of synchronization, the opposite 

holds for Japan and Norway.

To synthesize all the information provided by the above performance measures and 

the characteristics of the data, we finally compute two factors that allow us to cluster all 

economies into four groups. By transforming the original set of correlated performance 

measures into a smaller and more understandable set of uncorrelated factors, we aim to 

summarize the results of the present study. We make use of multidimensional scaling 

(MDS) analysis to generate a two-dimensional perceptual map in which we position all 

twenty eight economies according to their coordinates regarding the two factors. MDS is 

a multivariate analytical procedure also known as Principal Coordinates Analysis 

(Torgerson, 1952, 1958). For a detailed description of this technique see Hair et al. (2009) 

and Jolliffe (2002). MDS allows to visualize the level of similarity of individual cases of 

a dataset. In our case, the proximity between the different countries in the perceptual map 

indicates how similar they are in terms of the performance of survey-based measures of 

economic expectations. 

First, we rank all twenty-eight countries in decreasing order according to their 

performance experienced over the sample period for each of the following measures: the 

weight of the leading indicator (
ity ,1ˆ

 ), the summation of squared forecast errors (SSE), 

the MAE, the RMSE, the MASE, the CI, and the standard deviation of GDP growth (
ty

 ) 

in each country. Second, we assign a numerical value to each country corresponding to 

its position. We use the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix to generate a screeplot (Fig. 

3) in order to identify the last component that accounts for a considerable amount of 

variance in the data, and therefore determine the number of dimensions. As we can see, 

the elbow is located at the third component, where there is a noticeable difference in 

slopes, indicating that the optimal number of dimensions is two. 

 

Fig. 3 Screeplot 

 



21 

 

 

After deciding on the number of components, we reduce the information of all 

rankings into two dimensions, which can be regarded as two synthetic indicators that 

maintain the original ordinal structures. We obtain a Kruskal stress value of 0.012, which 

indicates the amount of distortion in distances to tolerate. Stress values range from zero 

to one, where zero denotes a perfect representation of the input data in two dimensions. 

The two-dimensional scatterplot that represent the coordinates of the first two dimensions 

for each country is presented in Fig. 4. 

 

Fig. 4 MDS Perceptual Map 

 

 

 

The perceptual map is divided in four quadrants. In the top right quadrant, we find the 

countries with the highest scores in the two dimensions: Belgium, Norway, Austria, 

Lithuania, Japan and the UK. In this group of economies, the evolution of GDP displays 

a stable pattern, and expectations show a good forecasting performance. On the other 

extreme, in the lower left quadrant, we find the economies with the lowest scores in both 

dimensions: Ireland, Hungary, Slovenia, Poland, Italy, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, 

which is very close to Spain, Portugal and Germany in top left quadrant. Croatia is 

grouped apart, obtaining the lowest score in the first dimension, as opposed to Bulgaria, 

Estonia and Latvia, which are the economies with the highest scores in the first dimension. 



22 

 

According to Lee (1994), the differences between the actual values of a variable and 

quantified expectations may arise from three different sources: the measurement or 

conversion error due to the use of quantification methods to approximate unobservable 

expectations; the expectational error due to the agents’ limited ability to predict the 

movements of the actual variable; and the sampling errors. The groupings in Fig. 4 are 

indicative of different values regarding these three sources of error. 

Finally, by means of an analysis of the variance (ANOVA) we test whether significant 

differences exist between the mean of each item across the four groups (Table 6). With 

the exception of the ranking regarding the CI, we find significant differences across 

clusters with respect to the mean of each of the performance measures used in the MDS 

analysis. These results suggest that the quantification of survey measures of expectations 

could be improved by adapting quantification procedures for countries with similar 

characteristics.

5 Conclusion 

 

This paper proposes an empirical approach to transform qualitative survey responses 

on the direction of change into quantitative estimates of economic activity by means of 

symbolic regression via genetic programming. We used survey-based agents’ 

expectations about the economic situation from the World Economic Survey in twenty-

eight countries of the OECD to derive a leading indicator, which consists of an optimal 



23 

 

combination of survey variables that best tracks the evolution of the economic activity. 

We repeated the experiment using agents’ perceptions about the present economic 

situation to obtain a coincident indicator. 

We then combined the information from the leading and the coincident indicator by 

means of index tracking, which is a procedure to find the optimal relative weights of both 

indicators. By doing so, we generated quantitative proxies of economic activity. To assess 

the forecasting performance of the generated estimates, we computed several stylized 

facts and compared them to a benchmark model and to the Economic Climate Index 

constructed by the IFO. The heterogeneity of the results across countries led us to 

synthesize the information provided by all the forecast accuracy measures by means of a 

dimensionality reduction technique that allows us to cluster all economies according to 

their performance. 

We obtained significant differences between mean values of each cluster, which 

indicates that the forecasting performance of survey-based expectations could be 

improved by designing ad-hoc quantification procedures for countries with similar 

characteristics. 

Due to the novelty of the proposed approach, there are still several limitations to be 

addressed. Given that we used a data-driven method, the obtained quantitative estimates 

lack any theoretical background. Extending the analysis to other questionnaires would 

allow us to examine to what extent the obtained functional forms are extensive to different 

survey data. Another issue left for further research is assessing the effect of GDP updates 

on the results. Finally, there is the question of whether the implementation of alternative 

evolutionary algorithms could improve the forecast accuracy of empirically-generated 

quantitative estimates of expectations.
