Abstract: Setting: The infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis gives a delayed immune response, 
measured by the tuberculine skin test. We present a new technique for evaluation based on automatic 
detection and measurement of skin infrared emission. 
Design: 21 subjects (57.0±17.8 yr), (7/14, M/F) with suspected tuberculosis contact were examined 
with an IR thermal camera, 48 hours after skin injection. 
Results:  In 15 subjects, IR analysis was positive for tuberculine test. Mean temperature of injection 
area was higher, around 1 ºC, for the positive group (36.0± 0.3 ºC positive group; 35.2±1.7 ºC negative 
group, p<0.001, Non parametric U Mann-Whitney Test). 
Conclusion: IR may represent an improved estimation of tuberculosis infection, given that it does not 
depend on reader variability and measures the increase of heat irradiation produced by the allergic 
tuberculine response.

INTRODUCTION 52 

 According to the World Health Organization, two billion people are infected 53 

with the tuberculosis (TB) bacilli
1
. It is estimated that every year eight million new 54 

cases appear. TB is a contagious disease not totally under control with great differences 55 

between rich and poor countries
2
. The diagnosis of TB is based on the interpretation of 56 

a skin immunologic reaction. The infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis gives a 57 

delayed immune response, measured by the tuberculin skin test (TST)
3
. This consists of 58 

the intradermal injection of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and 59 

measurement of the resulting reaction. The induration size, measured in millimeters, 60 

indicates if the test result is negative or positive. Palpation and pen methods have been 61 

typically applied to measure the PPD reaction, but the measurement depends on the 62 

subjective interpretation of the reaction area
4,5

. New technologies are currently being 63 

developed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the TB diagnosis
6
. 64 

 In this study, we present a new technique for the evaluation of the tuberculine 65 

reaction based on the automatic detection and measurement of infrared (IR) emission of 66 

inflammatory effects produced by tuberculine immune response. IR thermal imaging is 67 

a noninvasive technique for monitoring temperatures and is widely applied in 68 

medicine
7,8

. The IR radiation increases due to inflammatory processes, such as that in 69 

the tuberculine reaction.  An increased IR radiation is most likely caused by elevated 70 

blood flow, metabolic activity, and inflammatory reactions
9
. Therefore IR thermal 71 

imaging can be used to measure the rise in temperature due to an inflammatory process, 72 

which causes the increase of the blood flow with vascular dilatation, blood proteins and 73 

cellular extravasations
10

 .PPD inflammatory response is characterized by edema, 74 

leukocyte lymphocyte-mononuclear infiltration, and erythrocyte extravasation in the 75 

dermis and epidermis
11

. Our hypothesis in the present work was that intradermal 76

inflammatory PPD reaction produced an increase in the temperature of the injected area, 77 

which could be measured by IR thermal imaging, and the features extracted from the 78 

resulting IR images after applying digital image processing techniques, helped to 79 

improve the reliability in the TB diagnosis. 80

MATERIAL AND METHODS 82 

Ethics Statement  83 

 The study was conducted in the Respiratory Function Laboratory at HUGTIP, 84 

from February- September 2014, and approved by the hospital’s Human Research and 85 

Ethics Committee. All participants came from pulmonology dept to discard tuberculosis 86 

contact and gave written informed consent, following the World Medical Association’s 87 

Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human 88 

Subjects. 89 

Mantoux tuberculin skin test 90 

The Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) was performed in all subjects by 91 

intradermal injection of 0.1 ml of tuberculine purified protein derivative (PPD) 92 

(Tuberculina PPD Evans 2 UT/0.1 ml, UCB Pharma S.A., Madrid, Spain) in the anterior 93 

forearm. First, the reading of the Mantoux TST was manually performed 48 hours 94 

following the skin injection
3
 by inspection, palpation, and measurement of the 95 

induration. An induration size greater than 0.5 cm was considered to be a positive TST 96 

result. A technician with more than 20 years experience in TST lecture has made all 97 

TST test
12

. 98 

IR thermal imaging 99 

The size of the induration was also measured by IR thermal imaging. Subjects 100 

remained in the laboratory room for at least 15 minutes to achieve thermal equilibrium. 101 

Temperature, humidity and air circulation were all controlled. Laboratory temperature 102 

was maintained between 23 ± 1 ºC, and humidity was around 50%. Subjects were 103 

requested not to consume hot drinks or food for at least an hour before image session, 104 

nor use any skin preparations such as creams or talcum powder. Emissivity of the skin 105

was assumed at a value of 0.98 ± 0.01. There was no ceiling air filter. The lighting in 106 

the laboratory was maintained at wavelengths longer than 1 micron. 107 

 The IR thermal images were obtained from the anterior surface of the forearm of 108 

each subject, using a TiR32 Fluke Camera (2009 Fluke Corporation USA; 320x240 109 

Focal plane array; 0.01 Cº Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference; 8-14 µm spectral 110 

range). The IR thermal camera was installed on a tripod with a fluke compact photo-111 

movie. The distance between the camera focus and the forearm was 40 cm. The forearm 112 

was placed on a black foam cushion over a wooden table, with the anterior surface 113 

facing the camera focus. To have a reference distance, we placed a 24 mm diameter 114 

coin below the area to be measured. The detection of that reference object allowed us to 115 

convert pixels to millimeters (Figure 1). The image acquisition and storage were made 116 

with the SmartView® software. Each image was exported in JPG format. Moreover, the 117 

temperature measurements were transferred to a text file. 118 

IR image processing 119 

 The IR image processing was performed using Matlab 2014b and following the 120 

scheme shown in Figure 2. Each text file containing the temperature data of an IR image 121 

was imported in a 2D numerical array (temp). As IR images had different temperature 122 

ranges, each temp array was scaled, as in (1), in order to have values between 0 and 1, 123 

thus obtaining the gray scale image temp_n (Figure 3-a). 124 

        
         

         
 (1) 125 

Tmin and Tmax are the minimum and the maximum temperatures in temp 126 

respectively. After obtaining the gray scale image temp_n, we detected the reference 127 

object of known size that was present in the image in order to obtain the conversion 128

factor from pixels to millimeters. For that purpose, we first applied the Canny edge 129 

detector to the normalized image temp_n (Figure 3-b). Then, since the reference object 130 

was a circle, we used the circular Hough transform to detect its position and match its 131 

edge (note that the Hough transform can be adapted to detect specific shapes in an 132 

image)
13

. As the radius in millimeters of the reference object was known, we were able 133 

to calculate the conversion factor to express measured lengths in millimeters (Figure 3-134 

c). 135 

The temperature in the forearm area was much higher than the temperature 136 

outside the forearm area (air). Therefore, the values of all pixels in the forearm area 137 

were in the upper range of the scaled temp_n image. In order to clarify the differences 138 

between the internal pixels of the forearm area, we applied an intensity transformation 139 

to temp_n. All pixels below 0.5 were set at 0, whereas pixels in the range 0.5-1 were 140 

expanded to the range 0-1, thus obtaining the temp_e image (Figure 3-d). The difference 141 

between the PPD reaction area and the rest of the forearm was more noticeable in 142 

temp_e than in temp_n. 143 

The segmentation algorithm searched two different regions: region 1 (PPD 144 

reaction area) and region 2 (erythema). A region growing method was used for the 145 

image segmentation. Assuming that the PPD reaction area (region 1) was near the 146 

image center, the first seed pixel was the pixel with the maximum temperature (PTmax) 147 

inside a centered rectangle area. A binarization was applied to the image temp_e. Pixels 148 

of the surface of the forearm were retained (set at 1) and pixels outside the forearm (air) 149 

were rejected (set at 0), thus obtaining the temp_b binary image (Figure 3-e). Then, a 150 

5x5 cm square, which was centered at PTmax, was selected as the analysis area mask. 151

Having found the first seed point and defined the analysis area, the region 152 

growing algorithm was applied to temp_e by means of the following iterative procedure 153 

until convergence to a fixed point was reached. At each iteration, new sub-regions 1 and 154 

2 were grown from a new seed point, by adding in neighboring pixels according to each 155 

sub-region membership criterion. First, sub-region 1 was grown by adding in 156 

neighboring pixels that met the criterion in (2). 157 

                                                      (2) 158 

The parameter reg_mean1 was the mean value of all pixels included in the whole 159 

region 1, temp_e(i,j) was the intensity value of a neighboring pixel, S1(i,j) was the 160 

membership criterion of a neighboring pixel, Th1 was the threshold used to either 161 

include or not a neighboring pixel in sub-region 1, and A was the scale factor of Th1 to 162 

define the lower limit of S1(i,j). When there were not neighboring pixels meeting the 163 

criterion defined in (2), a new criterion, as defined in (3), was used to add in 164 

neighboring pixels to sub-region 2. 165 

                                                   (3) 166 

The parameter reg_mean2 was the mean value of all pixels included in the whole 167 

region 2, temp_e(i,j) was the intensity value of a neighboring pixel, S2(i,j) was the 168 

membership criterion of a neighboring pixel, and Th2 was the threshold used to either 169 

include or not a neighboring pixel in sub-region 2. When no neighboring pixels met the 170 

criterion defined in (3), a new seed point was selected and a new iteration started. Each 171 

new seed point had to meet the criterion defined in (2) and be at a maximum distance of 172 

15mm from the sub-region 1 obtained in the first iteration. 173

After the region growing process finished, when no new seed points existed, 174 

regions 1 and 2 were formed by a set of sub-regions 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 3-f). 175 

The maximum length of both region 1 and region 2 were calculated as the sum of the 176 

maximum length of their corresponding sub-regions (Figures 3-g and 3-h). The 177 

background area was calculated by removing the pixels belonging to either region 1 or 178 

region 2 from the analysis area mask. Then, the area (mm
2
), the minimum, the 179 

maximum, the mean, and the standard deviation temperatures (ºC) were calculated 180 

either for region 1, region 2, and the background. 181 

Finally, the region 2 was merged with the background if the following criterion 182 

was met: 183 

 tmean2-tstd2-tmean3-tstd3<=0.3 (4) 184 

where tmeank and tstdk (k = 2,3) were the mean and standard deviation 185 

temperatures of region 2 and background, respectively. Furthermore, region 1 was 186 

merged with region 2 and the background if criterion defined in (4) and the following 187 

criteria were met: 188 

 tmean1-tstd1-tmean23-tstd23<=0.25 (5) 189 

 tmean1-tstd1-tmean2-tstd2<=0.3 or tmean2-tmean3>=0 (6) 190 

where tmeank and tstdk (k = 1, 23, 2, or 3) were the mean and standard deviation 191 

temperatures of region 1, region 2+background, region 2, and background, respectively. 192 

In those cases, only a background area was obtained as the final result of the image 193 

segmentation. Therefore, no reaction area was found and the test was negative. A 194 

negative/ positive segmentation indicated an IR negative/ positive result respectively. 195 

Also, for an expert in IR imaging that made all lectures of patient IR image, the non 196

classified as a negative result.  198 

Statistics results were made by means of SPSS soft. Parametric and non 199 

parametric tests were applied to observe the differences between groups. A Bland-200 

Altman plot and the Kappa Statistic were also applied to see the inter-observer variation.  201

RESULTS 202 
 203 
 Table 1 expresses the anthropometric characteristics of 21 subjects (7/14 M/F) 204 

suspected of tuberculosis contact. Mean age was 57(17.9) years. Six had a positive PPD 205 

lecture (more than 5 mm of papule). In 15 subjects IR analysis was positive for 206 

tuberculine test.  207 

  Positive reaction of the IR visual examination was identified as one or more 208 

central geometric images with circular, elliptic or with more irregular contours, easy to 209 

differentiate from the rest of the IR surface (Figure 1). A higher temperature of this area 210 

appeared with a more intense color respect to the neighboring (blue to red colour scale). 211 

In subjects with a negative PPD test these characteristics were not evident in the IR 212 

image. Only one subject with negative PPD reaction presented a IR positive 213 

characteristic image.  214 

 215 
Table 2 depicts IR parameters for the two groups of subjects: Group 1 with a 216 

positive IR image (15 subjects) and Group 2 with negative IR reaction (6 subjects). 217 

Mean, min, and maximum temperatures were higher for group 1 than group 2.  218 

Differences for mean temperature were around 1 ºC between both groups.  These 219 

parameters were higher in area 1 than area 2 for group 1 and there were not significant 220 

differences from group 2. Differences for group 1 were around 0.5 ºC between area 1 221 

and area 2. 222 

 Regression coefficient between diameter of area 1 measured by exploration and 223 

IR analysis was R=0.8, R
2
=0.64, constant =6.13, coefficient beta=0.8.p<0.001. for all 224 

subjects with a positive PPD (14). Mean difference of diameter measured by PPD 225 

examination and IR analysis was around 1.4 mm ( -12.6 to 5.5 ). 226

 A Bland-Altman plot compares two assay methods. It plots the difference 227 

between the two measurements on the Y axis, and the average of the two 228 

measurements on the X axis (figure 4). Differences between diameter of induration 229 

measured by exploration of PPD and IR image analysis of area 1 were into the 95% 230 

limits of agreement (mean bias plus or minus 1.96 times its SD). The bias is computed 231 

as the value determined by one method minus the value determined by the other 232 

method. Bias was 1.4. and SD of Bias was 5.25. 95% limits of agreement were from -233 

8.9 to 11.7. 234 

 Inter-observer variation was measured by The Kappa Statistic, between 235 

exploratory lecture of PPD and IR image analysis (Table 3). The agreement was 0.89 236 

(almost perfect 0.81-0.99. Kappa Index). 237 

 238 
 DISCUSSION 239 

 The authors studied the skin tuberculine reaction in 21 tuberculosis contacts by 240 

infrared emission image analysis and compared it with classical tuberculine examination. 241 

Fourteen subjects with a tuberculin reaction size more than 5 mm had an IR positive 242 

image reaction. Six subjects with negative tuberculin test had also a negative IR image.  243 

One contact with a negative tuberculin test had a positive IR image.  The diameter of 244 

the IR reaction was higher than the diameter measured by skin examination.  245 

 Infrared imaging has been extensity applied in medicine since the 1960’s. 246 

Detection of peripheral vascular disorders and breast cancer are some 247 

examples
7,14,15,16,17

. In areas affected by a inflammation process characterized by 248 

arteriolar capilar and venula dilatation with inflammatory infiltrate there is an increase 249 

in an increasing of eat
10

. IR is able to detect skin temperature differences as low as 0.1 250

The current measurement of tuberculine reaction is the subjective measure of 253 

skin induration by tact. However, the reading of induration could be a potential error 254 

source
5
. Margins of the induration are difficult to find independently of technique 255 

(ballpoint-pen, palpation)
4
. On the other hand, it could be a subcutaneous inflammation 256 

due to the tuberculine reaction but not evident by palpation as a false negative result or 257 

doubtful lecture
4
. In this case, skin IR emission could be more sensible that a simple 258 

examination. Histopathologic pattern of human intracutaneous tuberculine reaction was 259 

described by Kuramoto
23

 and more recently by Haholu
11

 .These reactions take place in 260 

the epidermis and dermis. These cellular infiltrations with an extensive vascular 261 

component (vasodilatation, edema exudation) are responsible for an increase in the heat 262 

generation   on the injection place that can be measured by IR camera
10

. Changes from 263 

0.2 to 2 ºC have been demonstrated in inflammatory dermatologic processes
20,24,25

. 264 

  We observed a significant difference in the mean temperature between the 265 

central segmented IR area and window hand area at around 1 Cº. This temperature was 266 

above that measured in healthy subjects
8
. In addition, the difference between the central 267 

and surrounding area temperatures was significant, around 0.5 Cº.  A higher production 268 

of heat indicates different inflammatory events in the same way that the small 269 

indurations tact is different from the skin eritema area.  Infection with M tuberculosis 270 

causes a cell-mediated immune response leading to sensibilized T lymphocyte
26

. 271 

Intradermal injection of PPD evokes a delayed hyper sensibility response mediated by 272 

sensitized T cells that produces a skin induration
23

. Erithema multiform and spongiotic 273 

dermatitis are more related with PPD score based on the induration area. The most 274

frequent, basal spongiotic dermatitis, is characterized by edematous changes in the 275 

epidermis and mononuclear exocitosys. In addition, the erythema multiform type has an 276 

important component of edema with erythrocyte extravasations. In consequence we 277 

believe that marked edema as a consequence of a prolonged vasodilatation with cellular 278 

extravasations are responsible for increased temperature in the central area. This fact is 279 

shown by an increase of irradiated heat as observed in other inflammatory diseases
10

. 280 

 One important finding of the current work was that one subject with a negative 281 

PPD   had a positive reaction to the IR analysis. The possibility that PPD shows false 282 

negatives has been previously reported
27

. An immune compromised state (HIV infection) 283 

or inmunologic-suppression and booster phenomenon may lead to false negative 284 

results
27

. Methodological technical causes such as sub-dermic, superficial injection with 285 

an easy rupture of the vesicle, as well as a subjective interpretation caused by inter-286 

reader variability could constitute other causes of false negative results
5
. In fact, there is 287 

a 10% rate of false negative PPD’s in hospitalized patients, increasing to 50% in cases 288 

of disseminate tuberculosis
26

.In consequence, IR could substantially improve the 289 

sensibility in these cases.  We are not able to add any new data regarding false positive 290 

cases, which is an intrinsic problem of the tuberculine reaction. IR only provides 291 

information about local skin inflammatory reactions regardless of the kind of 292 

inflammation or germ-causing disease. New immune based tests such as interferon-ƴ  293 

release assay or POC technologies could increase the sensibility and specificity of 294 

tuberculosis diagnostic
6
.  295 

 Several issues related to methodology of the present paper must be addressed. 296 

First, the reduced group of patients has not permitted us to draw general conclusions, 297 

but in the present work a positive IR reaction was observed in all TST manual lecture 298

except in one and also negative IR  reaction was observed in all negative  TST test. In 299 

conclusion, although it needs a larger sample to extract definitive conclusion, we thing 300 

that these results induce to perform a multicentre study that will permit the definitive 301 

generalization of present procedure. On the other hand, infrared reading was made 302 

following the guidelines for standardization in Medical Thermography
17

. We think that 303 

this procedure could applied with no restrictive conditions that will permit to use more 304 

simple elements as an IR mobile-camera in different spaces for its general use. 305 

Worth to mention that our previous work
28

 revealed that thermal imaging 306 

provides complementary information to visual imaging, from an information theory 307 

point of view. 308 

  309 

Conclusion 310 

  IR may represent an improved estimation of tuberculosis infection, given that, 311 

IR lecture does not depend on reader variability and only measures the  increase of  heat 312 

irradiation produced by the allergic tuberculin response, which is the IR physical 313 

principle that  could be objectively  measured. 314

FIGURE 1-IR images in a positive PPD test.  433 

 Figure 1-1 is the photograph of the injection tuberculine area. We can observe a 434 

higher IR intensity in the area of tuberculine injection (Figures 1-1, 1-3).    Figure 1-2 is 435 

a superposition of IR and  colour photographic image. To have a reference distance, we 436 

placed a  24 mm diameter coin below the area to be measured 437 

 438 

FIGURE 2 – Flowchart of the IR image processing algorithm.  439 

 First, image temp was scaled, thus obtaining image temp_n. Then, the reference 440 

object was detected (center and radius), which allowed us to calculate the conversion 441 

factor from pixels to millimeters. Next, an intensity transformation was applied to 442 

temp_n, thus obtaining image temp_e. A region growing segmentation algorithm was 443 

applied to temp_e in order to obtain region 1, region 2, and the background. Finally, 444 

some parameters are calculated for each region and these parameters were used to 445 

decide if some region were merged or not. 446

 A Bland-Altman plot compares two assay methods. It plots the difference 458 

between the two measurements on the Y axis, and the average of the two measurements 459 

on the X axis. In this case the two measures are:  the diameter measured by manual  460 

exploration of  the PPD papula and the diameter of  area 1 measured by IR image 461 

analysis. The 95% limits of agreement are shown as two dotted lines.  462
