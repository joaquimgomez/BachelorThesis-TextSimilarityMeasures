Sensorimotor Contingencies for Cognitive Robotics

Abstract—The sensorimotor approach to cognition states, that1
the key to bring semantics to the world of a robot, requires2
making the robot learn the relation between the actions that the3
robot performs and the change it experiences in its sensed data4
because of those actions. Those relations are called sensorimotor5
contingencies (SMCs). This special issue presents a variety of6
recent developments in SMCs with a particular focus on cognitive7
robotics applications.8

Index Terms—Cognitive architectures, cognitive robotics,9
multimodal perception, sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs).10

I. SCOPE OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE11

THE SENSORIMOTOR approach to cognition breaks12 completely the classic sense-plan-act pipe that rules most13
of today’s autonomous robots, by mixing sensation with14
action, aiming to bridge the gap between symbolic data and15
semantics for robots 1). Sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs)16
are defined as the relations learned by the robot between the17
actions that the robot performs and the change it experiences18
in its sensed data because of those actions. The goal of bring-19
ing SMCs to robotics is to build robots with a more robust20
behavior in real environments 2), 3).21

In order to have robots outside of controlled environment,22
we need robots that understand their own environments 4), and23
it looks like a way to achieve this is by making the robot build24
by itself the SMCs that are common to every environment.25
Having robots that can generate such laws, will allow them to26
understand the world they are immersed, and make them by27
hence, more robust in real environments 5).28

We selected these papers for this special issue to provide a29
broad view of the subject, and particularly promoted papers30
with practical embodied implementations that raise the current31
challenges in the field.32

Among all the submissions what we observe is the agree-33
ment in considering the importance of multi-modal perception.34
The papers in this Special Issue use different combinations of35
proprioceptive sensors with visual cues and tactile sensors. We36
note that three of them rely on tactile information.37

Lot of efforts have been made to understand the mech-38
anism of perception, obviously linked to robot actions 6).39
Unfortunately, we realize that there is a very basic use of40
the robot capabilities, and the explored actions are still very41
simple. We envisage that the community will start soon to42
use more complex actions and take full advantage of the great43
robotic platforms we currently have available in research.44

II. CONTRIBUTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE 45

The special issue is composed of five papers. The most the- 46
oretical of the selected works is presented by Lanillos et al. 47
in the paper entitled Yielding Self-Perception in Robots 48
Through Sensorimotor Contingencies, where authors address 49
the problem of self-perception, including a novel model for 50
self-detection, which does not need to track or store the body 51
parts. Self-perception, taken as the understanding of the sen- 52
sory consequences of performing an action, can improve the 53
capabilities of the robot to interact in unknown environments. 54
They propose that the concept of usability can be emerged 55
this way. As perception they use artificial skin and visual cues, 56
and the output is the discovery of the potential usable objects. 57
For that purpose, an experiment is designed for discovering 58
usable objects in the scene based on the taping or pushing 59
setup proposed lately in [item 7) in the Appendix]. 60

A different approach of this same idea, along with its imple- 61
mentation in a real robot, is presented by Zambelli and Demiris 62
in their paper Online Multimodal Ensemble Learning Using 63
Self-Learnt Sensorimotor Contingencies. Authors introduce a 64
learning architecture where knowledge emerges from robot 65
interactions and multimodal sensory system. The method pro- 66
duces predictors able to relate motor commands to perceptions 67
of the robot sensory system. Notably, it does not require prior 68
information about the kinematic or dynamic models of the 69
robot. Hence, the proposed framework, initially developed 70
using an iCub humanoid robot 8) and a piano keyboard, can 71
be applied to different robotic platforms. 72

The manuscript by Giakos et al. entitled Perception of 73
Object Features During Robotic Sensorimotor Development 74
tackles the problem of perception, and proposes a mechanism 75
to think in a stable representation of the world inspired in 76
infant learning. The system is based on observing how the 77
gaze control impacts on the perception of the objects, and 78
provide an interesting insight on the emergence of features 79
that can lead to object recognition. Experiments give a full 80
demonstration of a longitudinal development of both senso- 81
rimotor development and early object perception on an iCub 82
humanoid robot. 83

The paper by Marcel et al. entitled Building a Sensorimotor 84
Representation of a Naive Agent’s Tactile Space tackles the 85
problem of the discovery of the inherent structure of the 86
interaction with the robot body. This work is focused on 87
the extension of the approach in [item 9) in the Appendix] 88
to the building of an internal representation of an agent body, 89
in the vein of Frolov’s previous work. Authors present a 90
method to build a perception of the environment, and provide 91
a formalization of the so-called “sensorimotor invariants.” The 92
method is shown to be valid also to consider motion planning. 93

2 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS

The work by Arriola-Rios and Wyatt entitled A Multi-Modal94
Model for Prediction and Classification of Object Deformation95
During Robotic Manipulation introduces a method to learn96
deformation models from robot interaction. Manipulation of97
3-D deformable objects is a challenging task 10); in this paper98
authors propose a method to predict the forces and behavior99
after the contact, and at the same time classify the material.100
Compared to other works with simple use-cases, here authors101
can deal this challenging task because some knowledge is102
parameterized in the system, and the SMC is used to learn103
some of the parameters, demonstrating that SMC approaches104
are useful also as partial learners.105
