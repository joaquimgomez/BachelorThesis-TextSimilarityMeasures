ABSTRACT

Objective To develop and evaluate the performance
of a novel method for predicting neonatal respiratory
morbidity based on quantitative analysis of the fetal lung
by ultrasound.

Methods More than 13 000 non-clinical images and 900
fetal lung images were used to develop a computerized
method based on texture analysis and machine learn-
ing algorithms, trained to predict neonatal respiratory
morbidity risk on fetal lung ultrasound images. The
method, termed ‘quantitative ultrasound fetal lung matu-
rity analysis’ (quantusFLM), was then validated blindly
in 144 neonates, delivered at 28 + 0 to 39 + 0 weeks’
gestation. Lung ultrasound images in DICOM for-
mat were obtained within 48 h of delivery and the
ability of the software to predict neonatal respiratory
morbidity, defined as either respiratory distress syn-
drome or transient tachypnea of the newborn, was
determined.

Results Mean (SD) gestational age at delivery was 36 + 1
(3 + 3) weeks. Among the 144 neonates, there were 29
(20.1%) cases of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Quan-
titative texture analysis predicted neonatal respiratory
morbidity with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predic-
tive value and negative predictive value of 86.2%, 87.0%,
62.5% and 96.2%, respectively.

Conclusions Quantitative ultrasound fetal lung maturity
analysis predicted neonatal respiratory morbidity with
an accuracy comparable to that of current tests using
amniotic fluid. Copyright  2014 ISUOG. Published by

INTRODUCTION

Neonatal respiratory morbidity, defined as respiratory
distress syndrome or transient tachypnea of the newborn,
is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity associated
with prematurity1,2. Neonatal respiratory morbidity is
not restricted to very preterm births and remains high
among late-preterm and early-term infants born before
39 weeks’ gestation3–5. Fetal lung maturity (FLM)
is determined mainly by pulmonary surfactant and it
can only be assessed with laboratory tests on amniotic
fluid6–10. The need for amniocentesis has resulted in
a decline in the use of this information clinically. The
non-invasive prediction of FLM by fetal lung ultrasound
images has been attempted for a quarter of a century by
means of gray-level measurements, lung tissue motion
and relative features of lung-to-placenta or -liver images,
among others11–16. These studies revealed a good
correlation with respiratory morbidity, but the diagnostic
accuracy was inadequate for clinical use.

Over the years, powerful quantitative techniques for
ultrasound image analysis have been developed thanks
to improvements in computer capacity and image
resolution17. Specifically, texture analysis approaches are
computerized methods that can analyze medical images
and identify subtle changes in the aspect, or texture,
that are invisible to the human eye18. These textural
patterns can then be used to train algorithms to predict
clinical information. Recent studies have demonstrated
that texture analysis of fetal lung ultrasound images is
able to identify patterns of features that correlate strongly
with gestational age19, or with the results of FLM tests
on amniotic fluid20. These studies provided a proof of
concept of the potential of texture-based methods, but

common problems of other quantitative imaging methods
remained, such as the lack of robustness of blind testing
due to variable acquisition conditions. To date, the ability
of texture analysis of fetal lung ultrasound images to
predict blindly the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity
has not been demonstrated.

To address these limitations, we have developed a new
method termed ‘quantitative ultrasound fetal lung matu-
rity analysis’ (quantusFLM), which combines various
image texture extractors and machine learning algo-
rithms. In this study, we describe the basic principles of
this novel method and the results of a validation study to
predict blindly the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity.

METHODS

A novel quantitative ultrasound fetal lung maturity
analysis was planned to offer automatic assessment of the
risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity using an ultrasound
image of the axial section of the fetal thorax at the level
of the four-chamber view of the fetal heart. quantusFLM
was designed specifically to be composed of two modules,
a texture feature extractor and a classifier. The latter uses
information from the extracted features to assess the risk
of respiratory morbidity (Figure 1). The performance of
the algorithm was then validated using blind samples in
order to evaluate its potential for use in clinical practice.

The first aim was to develop a textural feature extractor
module that showed the highest robustness when tested
using images acquired under different conditions. This
module is used to compact all the information contained
in an image (or a region of an image) to a few features that
contain relevant information. For a given application, a
feature extractor module obtains the relevant information
of an image. In this way, it can represent the information
conveyed by the pixels of an image by a much more
compact, application-dependent set of values. Features
should be invariant to clinical acquisition conditions such
as changes in lighting, shadows, rotation or resolution due

to lack of accessibility and control over the fetal position
during the image acquisition procedure. The region of
interest (ROI) for the analysis is the region corresponding
to fetal lung tissue, which is delimited manually by the
operator. Hence, the feature extractor module must be
invariant to the shape and size of the ROI.

Different existing methods for image texture extraction
based on wavelets, co-occurrence matrix, histogram
gradients, binary patterns, scale and rotation-invariant
features methods and standard first- and second-order
statistical measures were evaluated21–26. Our previously
reported method for feature extraction, AQUA27, was
also tested in these series of experiments, but was
discarded after the first round of experiments owing
to poor robustness with respect to image variability.
For each different extractor method, the process may
be considered to be robust when the same or similar
features are obtained for the same image acquired under
different conditions. Robustness is demonstrated within
a certain range, since certain acquisition parameters can
be controlled to some degree (for instance, minimum
ROI size or shadows). Moreover, to ensure the feasibility
of quantusFLM, the method should not require an area
bigger than 400 pixels to extract robust features.

OUTEX28 and PHOTEX29 databases, composed
of texture images acquired using different controlled
parameters such as illumination, spatial resolution and
rotation angles, were used for this purpose. A total of
13 171 images were used for illumination and rotation
experiments and 11 178 were used for resolution ones.
Each of these images was divided automatically into 25
non-overlapping equal-sized images and into 30 overlap-
ping different-sized regions to test the robustness with
respect to the ROI. Affinity and measures such as corre-
lation, city block, Chebyshev or Euclidean distance, were
used to evaluate the performance of the methods tested.

A newly developed feature extractor was then further
refined and tuned up using real fetal lung ultrasound scans.
The images used were a set of 957 samples obtained in a

previous study19. Using real lung images was critical for
determining the final combination of textural features in
a manner that maximizes the robustness of the extracted
features under those variations that occur in fetal lung
ultrasound acquisition in clinical practice. Over 7 billion
computerized experiments were performed to construct
the quantusFLM feature extractor module, which com-
bines the features that have been shown to be invariant
to geometric and photometric transformations (under the
range of conditions commonly used for acquisition).

The classification algorithm must combine the features
obtained with the first module to predict the occurrence
of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Different supervised
machine learning methods, including regression models,
classification trees and neural networks, were trained
to combine the appropriate subset of features in order to
identify those images that contain the relevant information
needed to classify fetuses as having a high or low risk
of respiratory morbidity30–34. The final quantusFLM
classification algorithm is a sequence of various machine
learning steps that combines the textural features selected
(previously obtained with the extractor module) with
clinical data (gestational age) to generate the estimate.
The parameters of this model were estimated and
tuned up using 390 fetal lung ultrasound images that
were obtained prospectively from a cohort of women
with singleton pregnancies at between 24 + 6 weeks’
and 41 + 6 weeks’ gestation. The cases that were used
for training the algorithm had not been used in any
previous study. Lung ultrasound scans were obtained
within 48 h of delivery, and the occurrence of neonatal
respiratory morbidity was recorded. Ethical board review
approval was obtained (ID 2013/8892) and informed
consent was given in all cases, both for constructing
the algorithm and for validating it. The final algorithm
combined hundreds of textural features associated with
the occurrence of neonatal morbidity. The theoretical
diagnostic performance achieved was: accuracy, 87%
(95% CI, 82–90%); sensitivity, 91% (95% CI, 77–98%);
specificity, 86% (95% CI, 82–90%); positive predictive
value, 47% (95% CI, 35–59%); and negative predictive
value, 98% (95% CI, 96–99%).

Validation of the algorithm was carried out at the
Maternal–Fetal Medicine Department at Hospital Clinic
Barcelona. The validation group consisted of new cases,
recruited prospectively for the purposes of this study
until the sample size fixed for the validation (n = 150),
according to the study design, had been reached. In
this validation study, the population included singleton
pregnancies with gestational ages between 28 + 0 and
39 + 0 weeks. Validation samples were not used for the
generation of the algorithm or in other previous studies.

Pregnant women who were scheduled for delivery,
or at risk of delivery, within 48 h were considered
eligible. This included patients scheduled for elective
delivery or Cesarean section, or patients with pregnancy
complications including threatened preterm labor, rupture
of membranes or various pregnancy complications,
mainly pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.

Multiple pregnancies, and those with fetal structural or
chromosomal anomalies, were considered non-eligible.
In all pregnancies, gestational age was calculated based
on the crown–rump length at first-trimester ultrasound
examination. At enrollment, an ultrasound scan of the
fetal lungs was obtained but only patients actually
delivering within 48 h were finally included in the
study. Maternal baseline features and neonatal outcomes
were recorded prospectively. As already mentioned,
neonatal respiratory morbidity was defined as respiratory
distress syndrome or transient tachypnea of the newborn.
Respiratory distress syndrome was defined as respiratory
symptoms (e.g. grunting, flaring, tachypnea, retractions)
or a need for supplemental oxygen, together with
compatible chest radiography findings and admission to
the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory support.
Transient tachypnea of the newborn was determined by
chest radiography and clinical diagnosis established by
the clinician in charge3.

Ultrasound images were obtained by clinicians using a
pre-established acquisition protocol at the day assessment
unit of the department. An axial section of the fetal
thorax at the level of the four-chamber view of the fetal
heart was acquired (Figure 2). Images were obtained
with either Siemens Sonoline Antares (Siemens Medical
Systems, Malvern, PA, USA) or Voluson 730/830 Pro
(GE Healthcare Ultrasound, Milwaukee, WI, USA)
ultrasound equipment, with 3–7.5-MHz curved linear
transducers. For purposes of validation, the preset used to
perform the ultrasound scan did not contain any type
of post-processing options, such as image smoothing
options, nor any Doppler measurements, calipers or
pointers. The use of tissue harmonic imaging, and
adjustment of image settings such as gain, frequency
and time-gain compensation, were at the discretion of
the physician performing the ultrasound scan. Images
were collected digitally in the original Digital Imaging
and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format and
stored for offline analysis.

lung, proximal to the transducer.

All DICOM images were inspected for quality control
by two members of the research team (A.P-M. and E.B-C.).
Images were discarded if the lung area contained calipers
or obvious acoustic shadows created by bony structures.
Images that passed the quality criteria were processed
by clinicians (T.C. and M.P.) using specific software
that enabled the delineation of the ROIs for analysis.
Delineation aimed to include the largest possible area of
the fetal lung proximal to the transducer (Figure 3). Care
was taken to delineate only lung tissue, avoiding the heart,
great vessels and surrounding areas. In order to ensure the
robustness of the analysis, the software did not accept an
ROI containing fewer than 400 pixels. The same software
was used to perform the automatic analysis. Neonatal
outcomes were collected (J.P.P.) and data analysis was
performed by one member of the research team (J.C.R.)
who had not participated in the other steps of the study.

The sample size for the study was arbitrarily established
at 150 subjects, since it was estimated that this would
allow the inclusion of 25–35 cases of neonatal respiratory
morbidity. Descriptive statistics were performed with
R language (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria)35.

RESULTS

A total of 150 ultrasound images, obtained from different
pregnancies, were analyzed in this study. After analysis
of the images for quality criteria, six (4.0%) images
were excluded, leaving a total of 144 images for further

DISCUSSION

This study provides evidence that quantitative texture
analysis of lung ultrasound images predicts neonatal
respiratory morbidity with similar accuracy to that of
current tests using amniotic fluid.

Previous studies exploring quantitative assessment of
fetal lung ultrasound to predict FLM used a variety of
techniques. Prakash et al.12 compared ratios of fetal lung
to liver image feature values, with reported accuracies
ranging from 73% to 96%. La Torre et al.15 correlated
accurately several patterns of fetal breathing movements
with fetal lung maturity tests. Tekesin et al.13 evaluated

the mean gray value of fetal lungs, showing a changing
pattern with fetal lung development. However, no
significant differences were observed beyond 32 weeks’
gestation. Later, Serizawa and Maeda14 tried to predict
fetal lung immaturity by comparison of the ultrasonic gray
level histogram width (GLHW) of the fetal lung and liver
in 22 fetuses with respiratory distress syndrome and in 25
controls. In that study, GLHW combined with gestational
age identified differences associated with the occurrence
of respiratory distress syndrome, with a theoretical
sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 72%. In general,
previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between
quantitative image analysis and FLM, but either the
diagnostic accuracy was low or results were not validated
blindly, preventing the implementation of quantitative
image analysis to predict FLM in clinical practice.

To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting
blind validation of quantitative imaging analysis software
designed specifically to predict neonatal respiratory mor-
bidity. One difference between this study and previous
ones is that the software was constructed using a large
number of theoretical and real images in order to address
the main difficulties of quantitative analysis in practice.
The first difficulty is the variability in image acquisition,
which may create false associations in small sample-size
studies. The texture extractor used here works with
textural features selected after millions of computer tests,
which are highly correlated with the ultrasound texture
of the fetal lung, and are highly robust to changes in
the angle of insonation and to the adjustments of image
settings occurring in the real practice of fetal ultrasound.
In these respects, this approach represents a huge step
forward and a completely new approach in relation to
our previously reported methodology, AQUA27. While
AQUA was a useful method for demonstrating proof
of principle, as a texture extractor it had important
limitations in terms of robustness, which were addressed
by the newly developed feature extractors of quantus-
FLM. The second challenge of quantitative analysis
is automation. Thus, once robust textures have been
selected, automated classifiers are required, which entails
very large databases of real cases to avoid spurious

associations in the selected textural features. Again, quan-
tusFLM represents a completely new approach, since it
incorporates highly robust machine learning classification
algorithms that have been trained extensively and that
allowed a fully automated performance and immediate
clinical use.

The performance of the proposed algorithm is compa-
rable with that reported for tests that are currently used
on amniotic fluid36–40. Thus, the average reported sen-
sitivity and specificity of the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio
were 74% (range, 48–96%) and 98% (range, 81–100%),
respectively. Lamellar body count has a reported sensitiv-
ity and specificity of 86% (range, 71–100%) and 86%
(range, 60–100%); the phosphatidylglycerol test has a
sensitivity and specificity of 91% (range, 86–94%) and
72% (range, 67–79%); and the surfactant/albumin ratio
has a sensitivity and specificity of 90% (range, 83–96%)
and 76% (range, 64–88%), respectively. The average
sample size used in these studies was 167 (range, 28–301),
which is similar to that in this study.

The results of this study open the possibility of using
non-invasive approaches for the prenatal prediction of
FLM. Despite improvements in clinical practice such
as administration of prenatal corticoids and postnatal
surfactant, respiratory morbidity remains a leading cause
of neonatal morbidity and mortality in those delivered
late preterm (34 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation) and even
in early term (37 + 0 to 38 + 6 weeks) gestations3,41.
It is clear that, for some indications, delivery should
occur regardless of FLM results. However, there is
an open debate about the value of FLM testing in
the decision-making process for relative indications or
borderline clinical situations in which late-preterm or
early-term delivery may seem a reasonable option but
delivery could be postponed if fetal lung immaturity was
assessed2,42–44. In fact, recent data show that approx-
imately 1 in 15 neonates were delivered late-preterm
after induction or Cesarean delivery with no recorded
indication45,46. Determining FLM without the need
for an invasive technique might have a tremendous
impact on the clinical management of such cases. Aside
from economic implications, avoiding the need for
amniocentesis would be associated with less discomfort
and fewer related complications for the patient, and
controversies about indications for FLM assessment
could be approached from a different perspective.

This study has some limitations that should be
acknowledged. It used a single-center cohort, and
image acquisition and delineation were performed by
highly-trained personnel in a clinical research setting. In
this study, only 4.0% images were excluded, but we
acknowledge that this number could be higher with a
larger number of operators and settings. However, we
believe that the rate of failed acquisitions would be low
with minimal training, since the axial sections used are the
standard of practice for any healthcare provider trained in
fetal ultrasonography. The sample size in this study was
similar to those of clinical studies that validated amniotic
fluid tests, but it prevented the evaluation of performance

within narrow gestational-age ranges. We acknowledge
that a larger sample size should be used to obtain this
information. A multicenter international study to validate
the results reported here is now underway.

In summary, this study provides evidence that
software specifically developed for the purpose, based
on quantitative texture analysis of fetal lung ultrasound
images, predicts neonatal respiratory morbidity. The
performance obtained was similar to that reported for
commercial FLM tests using amniotic fluid. These results
should be confirmed in larger multicenter studies.
