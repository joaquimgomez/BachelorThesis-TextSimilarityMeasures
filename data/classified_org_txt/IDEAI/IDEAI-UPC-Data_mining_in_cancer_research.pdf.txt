I. Introduction
dvances in cancer medicine have 
traditionally come from detailed 

understanding of biological pro-

cesses, later translated into therapeutic 

interventions, whose effectiveness is 

established by rigorous analysis of 

clinical trials. Over the last 

two decades the increasing 

throughput of data from 

microarray screening, spec-

tral imaging and longitudinal 

studies are turning the under-

standing of cancer pathology 

into as much a data-based as 

a biologically and clinically 

driven science, with potential to impact 

more strongly on evidence-based deci-

sion support moving towards personal-

ized medicine [1].

This article is not intended as a 

 comprehensive survey of data mining 

applications in cancer. Rather, it provides 

starting points for further, more targeted, 

literature searches, by embarking on a 

guided tour of computational intelli-

gence applications in cancer medicine, 

structured in increasing order of the 

physical scales of biological processes, as 

outlined in Table 1. 

II. Robust Clustering and 
Data Visualization
Over the last decade, cancer has become 

a data-intensive area of research, with 

accelerating developments in data- 

acquisition technologies and specific 

methodologies, for example, next-generation 

sequencing for monitoring genetic 

changes in tumor cells as they progress 

from normal to invasive [2]. 

The first step in unrav-

elling these  processes is 

the study of co-occur-

rences, leading to the 

identification of disease 

sub-types. This already has 

profound implications for the 

clinical management of patients, 

impacting on one of the most 

funda mental precepts of cancer med-

icine – the histological characterisation 

of malignancies. Currently this is over-

whelmingly done by measuring the dif-

ferentiation between cancerous cells and 

the original normal cells from which 

they have evolved, marking them as well 

to poorly differentiated, meaning that the 

changes are linked with good to poor 

prognosis. Yet it is becoming apparent that 

the metabolism of cells is a key factor in 

uncontrolled cell proliferation, with a 

potentially greater influence on disease 

progression than cell differentiation alone.

Clustering is the first line analysis 

methodology to mine data bases for use-

ful research hypotheses to take onto fur-

ther, more directed, study [3], [4]. From 

a mathematical perspective the objects of 

study, be they genes, patients, mode of 

action drugs or disease sub-types, are 

points in a multi-dimensional space 

where similarity is defined, typically 

trough a measure of the distance between 

object pairs. The main classes of cluster-

ing approaches used in data mining for 

cancer are partitional, creating a simple 

partition of the data, or hierarchical, which 

create a tree-structured hierarchy of the 

data. Partitional approaches form a very

heterogeneous class, including techniques 

based on Global Optimization, Vector 

Quantization, Kernel functions, Fuzzy 

sets, and Graph theory [5]. Hierarchical 

approaches can be agglomerative or divisive 

and are often used as for first-line clus-

tering of high-throughput data. How-

ever, high- dimensional data spaces are 

by nature ultra-metric, each data point 

appearing to be at the centre of a hollow 

sphere, in contrast with the usual intui-

tive picture in low dimensions [6]. This 

effect needs to be taken into account 

especially with agglomerative methods 

to avoid early stage errors that can arise, 

resulting in sub-optimal solutions com-

pared with partition algorithms. A third 

main class of algorithms is biclustering 

that is to say clustering of both objects 

and features within a single model [7]. 

The range of clustering techniques illus-

trates the complexity of the problem. 

The fundamental concept underlying 

the definition of clusters, “similarity”, is 

complex in itself because of its ambigui-

ty. This difficulty is compounded when 

the most relevant features are not known 

a priori, yet the choice of different fea-

tures usually produces different solutions. 

An open research question is feature selec-

tion operating with unsupervised train-

ing. This will normally involve 

parametric modeling and the application 

of Bayesian methods to derive the dis-

criminative features which best separate 

between the clusters [8]. 

 In addition to such intrinsic complex-

ity, purely algorithmic issues may give 

rise to different solutions for the same 

data set, even for the same algorithm. 

This raises the possibility that cluster sta-

bilization methods including global stabil-

ity assessments [10], [11] and consensus 

clustering [12], [13] methods may miss the 

real complexity of the problem. 

An alternative approach to clustering 

assessment shifts the focus from the 

search of the best solution to the search 

of a set of equally plausible, though 

 different, solutions [14]. Recently, meta-

clustering [15] (see fig 1) has been pro-

posed as a clustering assessment tool. It is 

the process of clustering the solutions i.e., 

the cluster partitions themselves, general-

izing the concept of global  stability to 

local stability (see Fig. 1), that is, the sta-

bility of a solution with respect to a 

homogenous subset of the candidates.

The cluster composition then needs 

to be explored in detail, for which den-

drograms provide a useful representation, 

usually through sequential univariate 

splitting of the data space. However, the 

interpretation of geometrical relationships 

in the data is often best derived from 

direct spatial representations. The most 

commonly used methods for data visual-

ization are Multi Dimensional Scaling, 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

and Self-Organizing Maps [16], [17]. 

Linear methods are particularly inter-

esting since they enable axes projections 

to be overlaid on the data. An efficient 

methodology for cluster-based linear 

visualization is to use a decomposition of 

the covariance matrix which explicitly 

takes into account cluster membership. 

This is the natural tailoring of PCA to the 

case where the data are partitioned into 

labelled cohorts – an example from breast 

cancer proteomics is shown in Fig. 2 [18].

III. Pathway Modeling
The study of the cell functions is mod-

elled from experimental data sets which 

are both complex and dynamical [19], 

[20]. This has spawned the field of Sys-

tems Biology to understand and describe 

how molecular components interact to 

manifest the phenotypic behaviour 

which is the target of disease interven-

tion [21], illustrated in Fig. 3. In the sys-

tems biology literature there are two 

main classes of approaches:

Inverse problems, which involves  ❏

mining data from many perturbation 

experiments to identify a compatible 

structure of the signaling pathway.

Direct problems, to forecast and simu- ❏

late the forward evolution of dynami-

cal systems, using differential equations.

Several methods make the assump-

tion that the expression level of a given 

gene can be considered as a random 

variable and the mutual relationships 

between them can be derived by statisti-

cal dependencies. The resulting system is 

embedded in a probabilistic Graphical 

Model [22] described for example by a 

Bayesian Network [23], a Factor Graph 

[24], a Gaussian Graphical Model [25] 

or a Mutual Information derived Influ-

ence Network [26].

 cancer detection, diagnosis and grading, 

and to monitor response to therapy by 

measuring tumor size and detecting re-

growth. Having started out as mainly 

anatomical measurement for anomaly 

detection as an indicator of malignancy, 

for instance using ultrasound and Mag-

netic Resonance Imaging (MRI), can-

cer imaging has developed into multiple 

modalities of physiological imaging 

including spectroscopy, with Magnetic 

Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and 

spatially localized Chemical Shift Imag-

es (CSI), with Positron-Emission 

Tomography (PET) and Single-Photon 

emission CT (SPECT) clinically widely 

used to measure glucose metabolism 

and therefore find regions with excep-

tionally high energetic rates, which are 

characteristic of tumor growth. An 

accessible review of machine learning 

applications to detection and diagnosis 

of disease may be found in [27].

A recent development is the use of 

specific functional imaging for tumor 

delineation, that is to say, to measure 

the contour during surgical planning 

and to identify tumor striations that 

may not be apparent clinically even 

during re-section. Initial efforts in this 

direction applied blind signal separation 

to single-voxel spectra to separate infil-

trating tumor mass compared with 

necrotic tissue [28]. However, tumors 

are not homogeneous, often mixing 

different types of tissue and sometimes 

with different grades of malignancy. 

One way to resolve this mixture is to 

segment the tumor composition, which 

is called nosological imaging, of which 

examples of diagnostic applications in 

brain are reported in [29], [30]. A relat-

ed and very important clinical area is 

follow-up imaging to determine tumor 

progression and to differentiate recur-

rent tumor growth from treatment-in-

duced tissue changes [31], [32].

V. Prognostic Outcome
Outcome modeling usually refers to 

the analysis of patterns of mortality and 

recurrence in longitudinal cohort stud-

ies, where a specific groups of patients 

followed-up for up to 20 years, record-

ing the occurrence of events of interest 

which may be cancer specific mortality, 

overall mortality or local and distal 

recurrence. The value of these studies is 

closely linked to the design of the fol-

low-up process, highlighting the need 

to involve biostatistical expertise from 

the very earliest stages in study design.

It is required to model the likeli-

hood of the event of interest, condi-

tional on the event not taking place at 

the start of the time interval and taking 

into account the loss of patients to fol-

low-up for reasons other than the event 

of interest, termed censorship. 

The application in medical statistics of 

linear-in-the-parameters models to non-

linear effects in outcome data generally 

involves discretising the data space to gen-

erate piecewise linear approximations to 

the desired response surfaces. However, 

this heuristic approach can have important 

consequences in cancer research, making 

it difficult to mine the hazard function for 

insights into the dynamics of metastatic 

spread [33] and inducing a categorisation 

of the histological grade of the tumor, 

which can give rise to important sub-

jective effects that impact on the choice 

of therapy given to the patient [34]. 

Neural network models fit non-lin-

ear, time dependent estimates of the 

hazard function, without the need to 

make proportionality assumptions or to 

discretize the state-space [35], [36] and 

their accuracy has been established by 

multi-centre, double-blind, evaluation 

[37] and this framework has recently 

been extended for estimating the joint 

model for more than one risk, e.g. local 

and distal recurrence [38].

mining in cancer but open questions 

remain before we can fully exploit the 

potential of molecular biology, to inte-

grate this into routine imaging and 

other non-invasive measurements for 

screening and early diagnosis, also to 

deliver consistency in laboratory mea-

surements especially in histopathology, 

and to more accurately model the bal-

ance between benefit and risk of thera-

py for niche groups of patients, down 

to the level of the individual. 

New data mining methods need to 

be developed to handle high-dimen-

sionality and large data volumes, to more 

efficiently model the dynamics of deep 

molecular pathways with high levels of 

noise and small experimental sample 

sizes, and also to robustly estimate haz-

ard functions with censored data with 

multiple competing risks. Analytical 

models need also to be integrated with 

clinical expert knowledge and processes, 

potentially by mapping into Boolean 

 filters [39].

The road ahead is long and bumpy. 

This article is provided as a sign-post to 

the nature of the key methodological 

and application challenges in this grow-

ing and exciting field.
