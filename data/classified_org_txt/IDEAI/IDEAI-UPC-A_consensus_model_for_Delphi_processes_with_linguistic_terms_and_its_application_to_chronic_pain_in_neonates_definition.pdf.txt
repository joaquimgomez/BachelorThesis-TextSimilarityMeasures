Abstract

Preprint submitted to Elsevier September 1, 2015



This paper proposes a new model of consensus based on linguistic terms to be
implemented in Delphi processes. The model of consensus involves qualitative
reasoning techniques and is based on the concept of entropy. The proposed model
has the ability to reach consensus automatically without the need for either a mod-
erator or a final interaction among panelists. In addition, it permits panelists to
answer with different levels of precision depending on their knowledge on each
question. The model defined has been used to establish the relevant features for
the definition of a type of chronic disease. A real-case application conducted in the
Department of Neonatology of Máxima Medical Center in The Netherlands is pre-
sented. This application considers the opinions of stakeholders of neonate health-
care in order to reach a final consensual definition of chronic pain in neonates.

1. Introduction

Delphi technique is a well-known group decision-making method involving
a structured interaction among a panel of experts or stakeholders, which anony-
mously tries to reach consensus on the significant features of a certain topic [25].
Since its introduction in the 1960s, it has been used to attain convergence of ex-
pert opinion in a variety of fields of knowledge such as program planning, needs
assessment, policy determination and resource utilization [11, 19, 22, 35].

The Delphi method has proved to have some functional advantages over other
consensus-building methods, such as brainstorming, dialectical inquiry and nom-
inal group [14, 22, 24, 25, 35]. The moderator in these group decision-making
techniques conducts the group communication and consensus processes through
several rounds. However handling uncertainty and linguistic terms in group as-
sessments is one of the main problems of this type of methods.

To handle the uncertainty and linguistic information inherent to human con-
sensus processes, many group decision-making techniques have been developed
and are available in the academic literature [2, 7, 13, 14, 16, 17]. In [18] a review
of consensus models in a fuzzy environment can be found. There is, nowadays, a
wide range of areas of application for these methods, from managerial to medical
or engineering [6, 8, 10, 30]. In particular, some fuzzy Delphi approaches have
been proposed to deal with uncertainty and linguistic information [9, 12, 27]. Al-
though, through these approaches, participants use a set of ordered linguistic la-
bels, they are unable to use different levels of precision in their assessments. In

addition, these fuzzy Delphi approaches share with original Delphi technique the
absence of a definition of a degree of consensus. These have been considered as
significant drawbacks by Delphi technique users.

The new approach to the Delphi method developed in this paper, not only
includes the use of linguistic information, with different levels of precision, but
also computes a degree of consensus in each round of the Delphi process. It
permits each participant to utilize linguistic terms that reflect more adequately the
level of uncertainty intrinsic to his evaluation, and to be dynamically aware of
their agreement in each round.

To this end, the new Delphi approach is based on qualitative reasoning tech-
niques [34]. Participants’ assessments through linguistic terms are considered
qualitative labels in an absolute order-of-magnitude qualitative space [31]. Differ-
ent levels of precision are used to reflect the distinctions required by evaluators’
reasoning processes. Techniques based on order-of-magnitude qualitative reason-
ing have provided theoretical models that permit operating in conditions of insuf-
ficient or non-numerical data [34]. One of the advantages of qualitative reasoning
is its ability to tackle problems in such a way that the principle of relevance is
preserved, i.e., each variable involved in a real problem is valued with the level of
precision required.

The paper comprises six sections. Section 2 introduces the main features of
Delphi processes. The theoretical framework for this new approach is then pre-
sented in Section 3. In Section 4 the new approach for Delphi processes, based on
a group consensus measure with linguistic terms is explained. A real case exam-
ple in the health-care sector is presented in Section 5 to show the performance of
this new approach. Finally, the main conclusions and lines of future research are
discussed in Section 6.

2. Delphi Processes: Overview and Key Points

Dalkey and Helmer and the Rand Corporation developed the Delphi technique
in 1963 [11]. This technique is usually used for determining the set of possi-
ble alternatives, finding implicit assumptions conducting to different judgements,
exploring new solutions for a specific problem, or reaching consensus about a
specific topic from a panel of experts or stakeholders.

A Delphi process is generally designed through 3 to 4 rounds of questions.
In the first round, in order to gather panelists’ opinions, open-ended questions
are used. The results of this first round are classified into statements which are
then valued by the panelists in a second round. In the consecutive rounds the

3



panelists are showed the values of the total panel and are asked to re-assess their
own values in the light of the group’s opinion. Frequently, this type of iteration
leads to a consensus on the group of significant statements.

The main weaknesses or limitations on the Delphi method are the absence
of a definition of a degree of consensus, the difficulty of dealing with the uncer-
tainty involved in panelists’ opinions, and the way in which some opinions are
suppressed during the consensus process.

Several fuzzy Delphi approaches have been developed in the literature to solve
these issues. The application of fuzzy theory to the Delphi method by means of
linguistic variables was initially introduced in [27]. A fuzzy Delphi method con-
sidering pessimistic, moderate and optimistic assessments of experts via triangular
fuzzy numbers was introduced in [23]. Using triangular fuzzy numbers to model
the experts’ judgments, in [21] consensus is reached in only one round thanks
to the implementation of the max-min fuzzy Delphi method and a new Delphi
method via fuzzy integration. After reviewing the previous fuzzy Delphi works,
a new approach using fuzzy statistics is proposed in [9]. An application of fuzzy
Delphi Method to obtain the critical factors of the regenerative technologies by
using fuzzy AHP to find the importance degree of each factor is introduced in
[20]. A web based consensus support system for group decision making problems
and incomplete preferences was introduced in [2]. The method is similar to Del-
phi technique but it does not rely on the use of questionnaires and the moderator
tasks can be replaced. An extension of the recent literature and an implementa-
tion of fuzzy Delphi for the adjustment of statistical forecast can be found in [12].
This study presents a fuzzy Delphi adjustment process to improve accuracy and
introduced an empirical study to illustrate its performance.

A new approach for Delphi processes is proposed in this paper. It is based
on a definition of a degree of consensus that can be used when experts’ answers
(as from round 2) are given with linguistic terms. Linguistic terms are handled
by means of order-of-magnitude qualitative reasoning techniques. [31, 32] offer
a detailed application of these methods to group decision-making and consensual
processes.

3. Order-of-Magnitude Reasoning Framework

In this section, we briefly review the basic concepts of the qualitative absolute
order-of-magnitude model which will be used in the next sections [1, 31, 34]. This
paper relies on the use of linguistic terms based on this model. This allows the
imprecision involved in panelists’ opinions in Delphi processes to be managed.

The qualitative absolute order-of-magnitude model of granularity n consid-
ers a finite set of basic qualitative labels, S∗n = {B1, . . . , Bn}, which is totally
ordered: B1 < . . . < Bn [1, 31].

In general, each basic qualitative label corresponds to a linguistic term, for
instance for n = 5: B1 = “Strongly disagree” < B2 = “Disagree” < B3 =
“Neither agree nor disagree” < B4 = “Agree” < B5 = “Strongly agree”.

The complete universe of description for the absolute order-of-magnitude space
with granularity n, is the set Sn:

Sn = S∗n ∪ {[Bi, Bj] |Bi, Bj ∈ S
∗
n, i < j},

where the non-basic label [Bi, Bj] with i < j is defined as the set {Bi, Bi+1, . . . , Bj},
whereas [Bi, Bi] = Bi [1, 31].

Following with the above-mentioned set of n = 5 linguistic terms, the non-
basic label [B1, B2] represents the linguistic term [“Strongly disagree”, “Dis-
agree”]. The linguistic term “Unknown” is represented by [“Strongly disagree”,
“Strongly agree”], i.e., [B1, B5]. This least precise qualitative label is denoted by
the symbol ?, i.e., in Sn, [B1, Bn] ≡ ?.

This structure permits working with all different levels of precision from the
basic labels B1, . . . , Bn to the ? label (see Figure 1).

In addition, we also review the concept of extended measure in Sn and the
connex union and intersection operations introduced in [31]:

A normalized measure µ is considered in the set of basic qualitative labels,
µ : S∗n → [0, 1] such that

∑
Bi∈S∗n

µ(Bi) = 1. This measure is directly extended to
Sn by defining µ([Bi, Bj]) =

∑j
k=i µ(Bk).

In order to define the degree of consensus among a set of panelists’ opin-
ions, the connex union and the intersection between qualitative labels are also

5



considered [31]. Given two qualitative labels [Bi1 , Bj1 ], [Bi2 , Bj2 ] ∈ Sn, their
connex union is the label [Bi1 , Bj1 ] ⊔ [Bi2 , Bj2 ] = [Bmin(i1,i2), Bmax(j1,j2)]. When
[Bi1 , Bj1 ] ∩ [Bi2 , Bj2 ] ̸= ∅, their intersection is the qualitative label
[Bi1 , Bj1 ] ∩ [Bi2 , Bj2 ] = [Bmax(i1,i2), Bmin(j1,j2)].

Finally, an iterative relaxation process is initiated in order to reach a non-
empty intersection among the set of qualitative labels when this intersection is
initially empty (see a detailed explanation in [31]). The iterative relaxation process
is done by means of a dive function ϕ which makes an immersion in a space with
a greater granularity (with more levels of precision).

Considering Sn with basic labels S∗n = {B1, . . . , Bn} as the initial space with
granularity n, and a space Sn+1 with granularity n + 1, with basic labels S∗n+1 =
{B′1, . . . , B′n+1}, the dive function ([31]) is the map:

ϕ : Sn → Sn+1,
such that, ϕ(Bi) = [B′i, B

′
i+1] for any basic label Bi ∈ Sn, and, ϕ([Bi, Bj]) =∪j

k=i ϕ0(Bk) = [B
′
i, B

′
j+1] for any non-basic label.

This relaxation process is performed iteratively as many times as necessary in
order to get a non-empty intersection. When this process is iterated over time, in
each iteration a new measure µ′ is computed. For instance, in the first iteration the
new measure µ′ can be obtained applying the next formulas for the basic labels:

µ′(B′1) =
1

2
µ(B1),

µ′(B′i) =
1

2
(µ(Bi−1) + µ(Bi)), i = 2, . . . , n

µ′(B′n+1) =
1

2
µ(Bn),

and the following for non-basic labels:

µ′([B′i, B
′
j+1]) =

j∑
k=i

µ′(B′k),∀i, j = 1, · · · , n.

In the next section, computations in Examples 1 and 3 illustrate this iterative
relaxation process and the computation of the new measure µ′.

4. A New Approach for Delphi Processes

The new approach for Delphi processes involves the measure of consensus
among panelists with respect to each statement in several rounds. For this reason,

6



a degree of consensus is defined to order the statements in view of the opinions
given by a panel of participants through a Delphi survey. Panelists opinions are
expressed using a set of linguistic terms with various levels of precision as intro-
duced in Section 3.

4.1. Measuring Consensus among Panelists
Let us consider a panel of m stakeholders and a set of statements Λ to be

assessed from the second round on of the Delphi process. The new approach
of Delphi processes proposed in this paper involves the notion of entropy of a
qualitative label, defined in Sn, as a measure of the information provided by the
qualitative labels in Sn, inspired from the Shannon entropy concept in information
theory.

Definition 1. The entropy of a qualitative label Q ∈ Sn is defined as:

H(Q) = − log2(µ(Q)),

where µ is the considered normalized measure in the set of basic qualitative labels.

Note that Definition 1 is obtained by considering a restriction of the entropy
definition introduced in [31]. In this paper, we consider the entropy of each quali-
tative label in Sn, instead of considering the entropy of a qualitative description of
a set over Sn. The reason is that, in the proposed approach for Delphi processes,
the concept of entropy of each qualitative label in Sn is needed to define the degree
of consensus among panelists with respect to each statement.

Once the notion of entropy of a qualitative label has been defined, the defini-
tion of the degree of consensus of the set of panelists with respect to a statement
a ∈ Λ is introduced as a quotient of entropies as follows:

Definition 2. Given m qualitative labels Q1, · · · , Qm ∈ Sn, associated to the
assessments of m panelists for a given statement a, such that ∩mj=1Qj ̸= ∅, the
degree of consensus with respect to a is:

κ(Q1, · · · , Qm) =
H(⊔mj=1Qj)
H(∩mj=1Qj))

=
log2(µ(⊔mj=1Qj))
log2(µ(∩mj=1Qj))

If the intersection of all the Qj is empty then the iterative relaxation process
mentioned in Section 3 is performed in order to reach a non-empty intersection.

7



Note that in the case that panelists only use basic qualitative labels, the con-
dition ∩mj=1Qj ̸= ∅ is only fulfilled when all the panelists’ opinions are the same
and then the degree of consensus is 1; otherwise, a lower degree of consensus is
obtained.

Next example illustrates how the the diving function and the updating measure
together with the proposed degree of consensus are computed.

Example 1. Let us consider the statement a = “Almost continuous pain longer
than few hours” and a set of three panelists E = {e1, e2, e3} consisting of a
nurse e1, a doctor e2 and a mother e3. Let us assume that the assessments of
the three panelists with respect to a are represented by three qualitative labels
defined as: Q1(a) = [B1, B2], Q2(a) = B3, Q3(a) = B2 using the meaning of
basic labels B1, . . . , B5 given at the beginning of Section 3. Finally, let us define
µ(Bi) = 1/5, i = 1, . . . , 5.

Note that there is not consensus among the panelists’ assessments because
Q1(a) ∩ Q2(a) ∩ Q3(a) = [B1, B2] ∩ B3 ∩ B2 = ∅. For this reason, the dive
function must be applied once, obtaining a non-empty intersection: ϕ(Q1(a)) ∩
ϕ(Q2(a)) ∩ ϕ(Q3(a)) = [B′1, B′3] ∩ [B′3, B′4] ∩ [B′2, B′3] = B′3 ̸= ∅ and a new
measure µ′ in S∗6 given by:

µ′(B′1) =
1

2
µ(B1) =

1

;

µ′(B′i) =

(µ(Bi−1) + µ(Bi)) =

5
, i = 2, . . . , 5;

µ′(B′6) =

2
µ(Bn) =

.

Then, since ⊔3k=1ϕ(Qi(a)) = [B
′
1, B

′
3] ⊔ [B′3, B′4] ⊔ [B′2, B′3] = [B′1, B′4] and

∩3k=1ϕ(Qi(a)) = [B
′
1, B

′
3] ∩ [B′3, B′4] ∩ [B′2, B′3] = B′3 the degree of consensus is:

κ(Q1, Q2, Q3) =
H(⊔3k=1ϕ(Qi(a)))
H(∩3k=1ϕ(Qi(a))))

=
H([B′1, B

′
4])

H(B′3)
=

=
log2 7/10

log2 1/5
= 0.22

This value of κ(Q1, Q2, Q3) suggests a low level of consensus among pan-
elists, consistent with intuition. Next examples present results when different
statements and initial panelists’ assessments are considered.

8



Example 2. Analogously to Example 1, let us consider now the statement b =
“The pain often cannot be associated with a specific etiology but might well from a
combination of things” and assume that the assessments of the three panelists with
respect to b are represented by: Q1(b) = [B1, B2], Q2(b) = [B1, B2], Q3(b) =
B2 using the same meaning of basic labels B1, . . . , B5 given at the beginning of
Section 3. and the same measure µ as in the above example.

In this case there is consensus among the panelists’ assessments because
Q1(b)∩Q2(b)∩Q3(b) = B2. Then, since ⊔3k=1(Qi(b)) = [B1, B2] and ∩

3
k=1(Qi(b)) =

B2 the degree of consensus is:

κ(Q1, Q2, Q3) =
H(⊔3k=1(Qi(b)))
H(∩3k=1(Qi(b))))

=
H([B1, B2])

H(B2)
=

=
log2 2/5

log2 1/5
= 0.57.

This value of κ(Q1, Q2, Q3) suggests a greater level of consensus among pan-
elists, consistent with intuition. Finally, let us consider the extreme case in which
two panelists’s opinions are “strongly disagree” and “strongly agree”.

Example 3. Let us consider now the statement c = “Daily continuous or inter-
mittent episodes of painful sensations in the newborn” and assume that the as-
sessments of the three panelists with respect to c are represented by: Q1(c) =
B1, Q2(c) = B1, Q3(c) = B5 using the same meaning of basic labels and the
same measure as above. Obviously, there is not consensus among the panelists’
assessments and the dive function must be applied four times in order to obtain a
non-empty intersection: (ϕ4 ◦ ϕ3 ◦ ϕ2 ◦ ϕ1)(Q1(c))∩ (ϕ4 ◦ ϕ3 ◦ ϕ2 ◦ ϕ1)(Q2(c))∩
(ϕ4 ◦ ϕ3 ◦ ϕ2 ◦ ϕ1)(Q3(c)) = [B′′′′1 , B′′′′5 ] ∩ [B′′′′1 , B′′′′5 ] ∩ [B′′′′5 , B′′′′9 ] = B′′′′5 . Then,
since ⊔3k=1ϕ

(4)(Qi(c)) = [B
′′′′
1 , B

′′′′
9 ] = ? and ∩3k=1ϕ

(4)(Qi(c)) = B
′′′′
5 , computing

the their values through the updating measure µ′′′′ the degree of consensus is:

κ(Q1, Q2, Q3) =
H([B′′′′1 , B

′′′′
9 ])

H(B′′′′5 )
=

=
log2 1

log2 16/80
= 0.

9



In this extreme case in which two panelists’ opinions are “strongly disagree”
and “strongly agree”, the degree of consensus is 0. When the connex union of
the initial panelists opinions is the qualitative label ?, the degree of consensus
will be 0. For this reason, in real cases applications, outliers will be removed for
statements in which panelists extremely disagree.

4.2. The Proposed Approach for Delphi Processes
The new approach for Delphi processes, enables the handling of imprecise

information given by evaluators. The proposed approach is based on the degree of
consensus introduced in the previous subsection. The degree of consensus allows
the ranking and selection of statements. As a result, it has the capacity to obtain
consensus automatically without the need for an interaction between participants.

Analyzing the results obtained in Examples 1, 2 and 3 in the previous sub-
section, it can be seen that qualitative labels with different levels of precision are
simultaneously handled to compute the degree of consensus presented. A compar-
ison of the results obtained using the degree of consensus proposed in this paper
in Examples 1, 2 and 3 together with the classic statistical parameters that would
be used in classic Delphi is presented in Table 1.

Table 1: Results Examples 1 and 2

Panelists Degree of Mean Standard
Assessments Consensus Deviation

κ µ SD

Q1 Q2 Q3
Ex1 (a) [B1, B2] B3 B2 0.22 2.17 0.62
Ex2 (b) [B1, B2] [B1, B2] B2 0.57 1.67 0.24
Ex3 (c) B1 B1 B5 0 2.33 1.89

In addition, the comparison of the outputs produced by the proposed degree of
consensus with the classic statistical parameters shows that the new measurement
is more consistent with human intuition on consensus. Note that even in the cases
where the panelists’ opinions have initially no intersection, we are able to com-
pute a measure of consensus. The proposed methodology takes into account the
necessary effort that would be needed to reach consensus.

Let us consider the new approach for a Delphi process consisting of three
rounds. A scheme for the proposed approach is shown in Figure 2, where the

differences between the proposed approach and the classic Delphi are shadowed.
First, note that the qualitative absolute order-of-magnitude model presented in

Section 3 is used in the interaction with the panelists in rounds 2 and 3. When
panelists answer the corresponding questionnaires, they can assess statements us-
ing linguistic terms with different levels of precision. In addition, the measure of
consensus presented in Subsection 4.1 is applied in the way the degree of consen-
sus is computed after rounds 2 and 3, and in the final selection of statements. The
proposed consensus scheme allows us to detect statements for which most partic-
ipants are in consensus, and then, to rank them accordingly to their importance.

5. A Real Case Application to Chronic Pain in Neonates Definition

Nowadays there is a lack of an adequate definition of chronic pain in the
newborn period. Research has shown that pain in the newborn period has con-
sequences later in life, such as altered behavior, increased pain sensitivity and

11



decreased function of the immune system [4, 15, 28]. To date neonatal pain re-
search has mainly focused on acute and procedural pain. Only little is known
about other types of pain that are common in the adult, for instance prolonged
or chronic pain. Although a small number of studies suggest that chronic pain
does exist in the newborn [3, 5, 26], there is no consensus on the definition, eti-
ology is unknown and there are no specific diagnostic determinants. An adequate
definition of chronic pain in the newborn period, stating the significant features
consensuated by stakeholders of neonate health-care, would enable to design the
appropriate treatment.

This section focusses on the definition of chronic pain in neonates. An anal-
ysis of the opinions given by doctors, nurses and other stakeholders is conducted
by implementing the proposed new approach for Delphi processes in order to se-
lect the specific diagnostic determinants for the definition of chronic pain in the
newborn period.

A web-based, three round Delphi survey was performed to provide a defini-
tion, the etiology and the specific diagnostic determinants of chronic pain in the
newborn. The survey, considering the three mentioned aspects, was carried out by
the Department of Neonatology of the Máxima Medical Center, Eindhoven Area
in The Netherlands. An international panel of experts in the field of neonatology
and neonatal pain was invited to participate: health-care providers (doctors and
nursers) and parents. The introduced methodology was applied to find a consen-
sus among panelists with respect to the definition of chronic pain in the newborn
considering the panelists’ responses. A definition of chronic pain in neonates was
obtained by using the proposed model. This real case example shows the potential
and benefits of the presented methodology.

5.1. Data description
In the first round, participants (n = 189) answered the open-ended question

define chronic pain in own words. The answers were classified and summarized
into 114 statements, which were valued by the participants (n = 189) on a 5-point
Likert scale. In the second round the remaining participants (n = 72) were asked
to reflect on a selection of 25 statements with a mode or median ≥ 4 or mean
≥ 3.75. These threshold values were used to provide the opportunity to easily
reach consensus in the following round. In the third and last round the remaining
participants (n = 33) were provided with the values of the total panel responses
and their individual response and were asked to re-assess their own values in the
light of the group’s opinion. Table 2 shows participants’ regions of origin and
participants’ profiles respectively.

5.2. Experimental results
A comparison between the results of the classic Delphi methodology and the

new approach presented in this paper has been conducted taking into account the
assessments given by participants in the third round about the selected 25 state-
ments. It should be noted that using the classic Delphi methodology those state-
ments with mode, mean and median ≥ 4 simultaneously were selected, resulting
in 12 statements. On the other hand, the approach presented in this paper was ap-
plied to select the most consensual statements among the obtained 25 statements.
The iterative relaxation process explained in Section 4 was applied resulting in 7
statements, in which the participants reached a degree of consensus over 0.20 (see
Table 3).

Note that, in Table 3, numbers in bold correspond to those statements selected
either by the classic method or the new approach. In addition, shaded rows indi-
cate the 5 statements selected by both methods.

The coincidences and divergences between results of both methods over all
the 25 statements are shown in Table 4. The new approach proposed in this paper
agreed with classic Delphi in 68% of the statements: 20% of the statements were
selected by both methods, whereas 48% were not. Two statements were selected
using the new method whereas they were not selected by classic Delphi. These
two statements suggest to incorporate a time variable in the definition of chronic
pain. However, using classic Delphi method, no time variable was selected. On
the other hand, seven statements among those selected by classic Delphi were
not selected by the new approach. These seven statements express more than one
concept each and, according to health-care providers, this could be quite confusing
for the panelists. This confusion is captured by the proposed approach. In the

Chronic pain depletes stress hormones and 4 4 4.1 0.92 0.09

Treatment should be based on signs 4 4 4.1 0.61 0.37

It can be anywhere in the body depending 4 4 4.07 0.74 0.09
on the reason for the pain.

This pain often cannot be associated with 4 4 4.07 0.37 0.98
a specific etiology but might well be
from a combination of things.

Pain that is ongoing, no longer proximate 4 4 4.03 0.69 0.09

A painful event may also alter perception 4 4 4.03 0.72 0.37
causing events that normally would be tolerate
to be perceived as painful, leading to a
chronic (longer duration) pain response.

Poorly controlled acute pain may lead to 4 4 4.01 0.85 0.09
hyperalgesia, altered pain perception, and possibly
a predilection to chronic pain states.

group of statements that were selected by both methods, in general, those with
high mean values and post hoc calculated small standard deviation show a high
level of agreement (degree of consensus) using the new method.

In this example, stakeholders were forced to value statements using a 5-point
Likert scale predefined values when they might have wanted to rate them less
precisely. This is why, even if we could have dealt with that imprecision with the
proposed methodology, we applied it assuming that all the estimations were given
by basic labels.

6. Conclusions

The method proposed in this paper, based on a measure of consensus, offers
a technique to synthesize a group of stakeholders’ opinions through a Delphi sur-

vey. Participants use a set of linguistic labels associated to an order-of-magnitude
model to express their evaluations. With this method the group is able to reach
consensus automatically without needing neither a moderator nor any interaction
between the participants. Moreover, this approach does not need prior normaliza-
tion to handle imprecise information given by the experts.

There are three main advantages to this approach. First, the different degrees
of strictness of the experts’ opinions are taken into account. Second, there is
no need to compute an average value of ordinal data. And third, this method
accommodates “unknown values” by using the label “?” defined in the absolute
order-of-magnitude qualitative model.

The proposed method has been used to reach a consensus on the definition of
chronic pain in neonates. In addition, a comparison of the results obtained with
a statistical study has been performed. The result is a 60% congruence between
traditional statistics and this new approach.

Three main lines of future research are being considered. First, from a theoret-
ical perspective, the introduction of machine learning techniques will be explored.
This will allow us to update information and landmarks for the selection of state-
ments in each round. Second, a web-based software device for Delphi processes,
based on the concepts introduced in this paper is being developed. It will be capa-
ble to collect and synthesize opinions expressed with different levels of precision
simultaneously. Third, in regard to the real case study presented in this paper, the
nature of the 40% difference between both methods will be analyzed and cut-off
points will be validated.

To conclude, let us remark that the theory introduced in this paper has a wide
domain of potential application in knowledge management, including consumer
ratings in marketing research and evaluation or accreditation processes in human
resources studies.
