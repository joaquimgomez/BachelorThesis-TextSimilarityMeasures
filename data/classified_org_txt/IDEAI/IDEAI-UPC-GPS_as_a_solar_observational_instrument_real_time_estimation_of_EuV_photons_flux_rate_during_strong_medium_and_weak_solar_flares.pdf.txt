X - 2 TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT

Abstract. In this manuscript, the authors show how the Global Navi-4

gation Satellite Systems, GNSS (exemplified in the Global Positioning Sys-5

tem, GPS), can be efficiently used for a very different purpose from that for6

which it was designed; as an accurate Solar observational tool, already op-7

erational from the open global GPS measurements available in real-time, and8

with some advantages regarding dedicated instruments onboard spacecraft.9

The very high correlation of the solar Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) photon10

flux rate in the 26-34 mm spectral band, obtained from the SEM instrument11

onboard the SOHO spacecraft during Solar flares, is shown with the GNSS12

Solar Flare Activity Indicator (GSFLAI). The GSFLAI is defined as the gra-13

dient of the ionospheric vertical total electron content (VTEC) rate versus14

the cosine of the Solar zenith angle in the day hemisphere (which filters out15

non-Solar over-ionization), and it is measured from data collected by a global16

network of dual frequency GPS receivers (giving in this way continuous cov-17

erage). GSFLAI for 60 X class flares, 320 M class flares and 300 C class flares,18

occurred since 2001, were directly compared with the EUV Solar flux rate19

data to show existing correlations. It was found that the GSFLAI and EUV20

flux rate present the same linear relationship for all classes of flares, not only21

the strong and medium intensity ones, X and M-class, as in previous works,22

but also for the weakest C-class Solar flares, which is a remarkable result.23

1. Introduction

The scope of space geodesy technique applications is in continuous growth, in particular24

for measuring, in different and better ways, parameters of the Sun (see for instance Soja et25

al. [2014]). This is the context of the research and the results presented in this paper; the26

utilization of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems as an instrument of Solar observation27

by indirectly measuring the Solar EUV flux rate from the sudden over-ionization of the28

overall Earth ionosphere during Solar Flares.29

Indeed, Solar flares are sudden flashes of brightness in the Solar atmosphere associated to30

energetic charged particle emission (primarily high energy protons) and electromagnetic31

(EM) radiation emission across the whole electromagnetic spectrum (primarily X rays32

and EUV rays). Solar flares generally originate in active regions, expanses of intense33

Solar magnetic field, and are often accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs, see34

Yashiro and Gopalswamy [2008]). X-rays and EUV rays emitted during Solar flares can35

affect the Earth’s ionosphere by producing photo electrons. These photo electrons are36

only produced in the daylight ionosphere and their enhancement can be approximated by37

the Chapman model (see Mendillo et al. [1974]). This enhancement in electron number38

results in increased reflection, refraction and diffraction of EM waves passing through39

the ionosphere, and hence can affect satellite communications. Solar flares also have an40

indirect adverse effect on the lifetime of satellites in the Earth’s orbit. X-rays, along with41

EUV radiation, heat up the earth’s outer atmosphere, causing it to expand. This, in turn,42

increases the drag acting on these Earth orbiting satellites, thus reducing their lifetime43

in orbit. Since EUV bands are optically thick in the Solar atmosphere, flares originating44

X - 4 TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT

closer to the center of the Solar disk are more geo-effective than those closer to the limb45

(Qian et al. [2010]). Sometimes, after the arrival of a Solar flare radiation, associated46

nearly-relativistic electrons can also arrive, typically several minutes after the onset of the47

EM signature of the Solar flare (Simnett et al. [1974] and Fig. 6 in Hernández-Pajares et48

al. [2012]), which may affect the readings of direct sensors such as the SOHO SEM. But49

since these electrons enter the Earth’s atmosphere through the polar caps, the associated50

increase in ionization in the atmosphere does not follow the expected flare overionization51

dependence of the Solar zenith angle, and then it can be filtered-out.52

Dual Frequency GPS satellites have become an excellent tool for ionosphere monitoring53

today. The total number of permanent GPS receivers around the globe, whose data is54

provided by the International GNSS Service (IGS, see Dow et al. [2009]), is currently more55

than 300, giving high spatial and temporal resolution to measure the electron content in56

the ionosphere. In the following sections we will show how Solar flares can be monitored57

using GPS data and how the high geo-effectiveness of Solar EUV radiation allows for the58

determination of its flux rate by measuring the ionospheric response to Solar flares. A59

previous study by Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012] on this subject mainly focused, and60

demonstrated the approach, for X class flares. Recently, this GNSS-ionospheric proxy of61

the Solar EUV flux rate has been used to characterize the main statistical properties of62

Solar flares (Monte-Moreno and Hernández-Pajares [2014]). The present paper covers M63

and C class flares along with X class flares, showing that the same approach is also valid64

for mid and low intensity Solar flares.65

The organization of the manuscript is as follows: Section 2 explains the GSFLAI, an66

approach introduced in Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012] to detect and characterize Solar67

TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT X - 5

flares. Section 3 explains how dual frequency GPS data can be used to calculate total68

electron content. In sections 4 and 5, information regarding input GPS data and reference69

EUV data is given. Section 6 discusses Solar flare events and results. This paper is70

concluded in Section 7.71

2. The GNSS Solar flare activity indicator (GSFLAI)

During a Solar flare event, the ionospheric electron density increases very rapidly. There-72

fore the assumption that the change in electron density is only due to the ionization process73

and not resulting from loss due to recombination processes or physical migration is valid.74

Indeed, it can be seen that the rate of production of ion-electron pairs at some level of the75

atmosphere (typically in equilibrium at any given time with the losses by recombination)76

is proportional at any given time to the intensity of the ionizing radiation (see for instance77

Eq. 1.19 in page 15 of Hunsucker & Hargreaves [2002]). It is then straightforward to78

derive that, under a sudden increase of Solar radiation (where transport phenomena can79

typically be neglected), an increase in the rate of production of ion-electron pairs will80

occur, with the associated sudden generation of extra free electrons. This is exactly what81

is observed for the main Solar flares (in Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012]), and for low82

intensity flares (as we are going to show in this manuscript). Then the rate of VTEC83

V̇ , for a given Solar zenith angle χ, is related to the Solar flux rate İ by the following84

equation:85

V̇ = η′ · C(χ) · İ (1)86

where η′ stands for geo-effectiveness of the considered spectral range.87

It has been shown that C(χ) can be reasonably approximated by cosχ for all values of χ88

X - 6 TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT

(Hernandez-Pajares et al. 2012). Since the ionization process takes place a few hundred89

kilometers above Earth’s surface, enhanced ionization for χ > 90 degrees can be expected90

due to the Solar irradiance at such height. On plotting V̇ against cosχ for different Solar91

flare events, enhanced ionization is clearly visible for cosχ > −0.2. Thus when V̇ is92

plotted against cosχ for cosχ = −0.2 to 1, a straight line is observed described by the93

equation:94

V̇ = a1 cosχ+ a2 (2)95

The independent term, a2, is expected due to enhanced ionization for χ > 90 deg. In96

this paper, GSFLAI is considered as the slope of this line, i.e. a1, and it is adjusted as97

a single parameter to enhance the estimation (assuming over-ionization for cosχ > −0.2,98

corresponding approximately to the ionospheric effective height). From Eq. 1 and 2, it is99

clear that with this definition, the GSFLAI is linearly related to the Solar flux rate İ with100

a certain slope and an intercept whose magnitude is directly related to the over-ionization101

at cosχ = 0, i.e. a2.102

3. VTEC from GPS data

TEC is the total number of electrons between two points along a cylinder of cross-section103

one meter squared. Slant TEC(STEC) can be defined as the total number of electrons104

between a satellite and a receiver along a 1 m2 cylinder, i.e. the corresponding integral of105

the electron density Ne:106

S =
∫ rs
rr

Ne · dl (3)107

where rs and rr represent the transmitting satellite and receiver positions, respectively.108

Vertical TEC (VTEC) then corresponds to the STEC when the satellite-zenith angle is109

zero.110

Ionospheric observations are generally derived from dual-frequency GPS phase measure-111

ments (L1 and L2) in terms of the ”Ionospheric combination of carrier phases” LI . It112

provides a direct but ambiguous measurement of STEC, S, with a nominal error of 0.02113

TECU, where 1 TECU = 1016m−2 (see for instance Hernández-Pajares et al. [2011]). LI114

can be expressed in terms of S as:115

LI ≡ L1 − L2 = α.S + wI +BI (4)116

where α = 1.05× 10−17 m3 , wI is due to the wind up effect which is easily corrected for117

permanent stations and BI is the ambiguity term, which cancels out when considering118

the rate of LI (taking into account the fact that no cycle slips have occurred).119

Vertical TEC is estimated from STEC by assuming a simple 2D ionospheric model i.e.120

the ionospheric electron content is considered to be situated at 450 km above the Earth´s121

surface. Nevertheless, this is not a relevant parameter in this problem due to the predom-122

inant data available at high elevations (where the assumed mapping is very accurate),123

the elevation mask used (15 degrees) and the overall fitting and outlier removal processes124

(performed at every epoch) versus the cosine of the Solar-zenith angle for filtering out of125

extreme cases. The VTEC rate can be written as126

Therefore, from Eq. 2 and 5 taking into account Eq. 1, our targeted magnitude for, the132

Solar flux rate İ, can be computed.133

4. Input Data

The input global GPS data are acquired from the IGS association, a voluntary fed-134

eration that provides open access to high quality GNSS data and products. It pro-135

vides data from more than 300 dual frequency GPS receivers distributed worldwide and136

which are capable of ionospheric monitoring with high spatial resolution (see Hernández-137

Pajares et al. [2009]). The time series of GNSS measurements captured at a sam-138

pling period of 30 seconds were used in this paper. These time series are available at139

ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gps/data/daily/. In general, 4 to 8 values of140

STEC can be computed from a single receiver, corresponding to different line of sight di-141

rections for several GPS satellites in view, covering in this way most of the values of Solar142

zenith angle χ. Presently, it is running in real-time, with a latency of 30 seconds, and143

since 2012 has been used in the context of the ESA MONITOR and MONITOR-2 projects144

(see Beniguel et al. [2012] and Hernández-Pajares et al. [2015] respectively), supported145

also by the RTIGS project (see Caissy et al. [2012]).146

5. Reference Data

GSFLAI calculations obtained from global GPS network data were compared with EUV147

measurements taken done by Solar EUVMonitor (SEM) on-board Solar andHeliospheric148

Observatory (SOHO, see Judge et al. [1998]) to obtain a relation between GSFLAI and149

EUV flux rate. EUV Solar flux data provided in the range 26-34 nm were used in this150

study. This choice was motivated by the fact that this range is dominant in the total151

TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT X - 9

EM emissions by active regions, and also the high absorption of this range at Earth’s152

ionosphere, mostly by atomic oxygen (dominant species and source of ionization up to153

500 km). Also, the classification of Solar flares into X, M and C class flares was performed154

based on the X-Ray intensity data provided by the X-Ray Sensor (XRS) instrument on-155

board Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES, Garcia [1994]).156

6. Solar Flare Events and Results

To study the validity of GSFLAI as a potential Solar flare detector (complementing157

the Sunlit Ionospheric Sudden TEC Enhancement Detector, SISTED; see Garćıa-Rigo158

[2012]) and a proxy for the EUV flux rate, 60 X class flares, 320 M class flare and 300159

C class flares that occurred between January 2001 and March 2014 were chosen. These160

flares were selected from the pool of total flares which were clearly picked-up by the SEM161

sensor on-board SOHO:162

1. GSFLAI was computed for all the X and M class flares from Jan 2001 to March 2014.163

Because a large number of C class flares occurred during this period, we only considered164

C class flares that occurred on same days as X or M class flares. This prevented us from165

downloading any extra data while maintaining the sample unbiased.166

2. Some of these flares were not picked up by the SEM, most probably because they167

originated close to the Solar limb (but they were picked up by the GOES X-Ray sensor168

as the X-Ray band is transparent in the Solar atmosphere). Because of the large number169

of total flares in our sample, we devised an automatic method to reject those flares from170

the study which were not picked up by the SEM. The method was to compare the epochs171

at which the GSFLAI and EUV flux rate achieved their maximas after the onset of the172

X - 10 TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT

flare. If both epochs were within 50 seconds of each other, then the flare concerned was173

considered fit for study.174

Section 6.1 discusses the validity of the GSFLAI method for the detection of various175

intensities of Solar flares. Also, the correlation of the GSFLAI with the EUV flux rate176

is shown for representative flares of different intensities. In section 6.2, the GSFLAI is177

directly compared with the EUV flux rate for all the Solar flares studied in this paper,178

to show that a linear relationship exists between the GSFLAI and EUV flux rate and to179

compute their linear relationship equation.180

6.1. Representative GSFLAI examples

To demonstrate how the GSFLAI is computed during a Solar flare and to aid visualiza-181

tion, one plot for each Solar flare intensity class (X, M and C) are shown in Fig. 1. Some182

outliers have been removed from the data, mainly due to local ionospheric perturbations183

and carrier phase measurement errors which do not follow the expected dependence with184

Solar zenith angle. It is clearly visible that the rate of change of VTEC (V̇ ) shows a185

linear relation to cosχ, where cosχ ranges from −0.2 to 1.0. After removing the outliers186

by rejecting the points having an error greater than twice the standard deviation, in a first187

least squares linear fitting, a final straight line is fitted through the data at each epoch188

(e.g. each 30 seconds, or each second). The GSFLAI is defined as the slope of this line. It189

is clear from the figure that the ionization effect is maximum for X class flares, followed by190

M and C class flares, respectively. But it will be later shown that this might not always be191

the case. Also, as mentioned earlier, the occasional nearly-relativistic electrons associated192

with certain Solar flares enter the Earth’s atmosphere through the polar caps. Since the193

increase in atmospheric ionization due to these electrons is not a function of the Solar194

D R A F T November 6, 2015, 4:51pm D R A F T



TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT X - 11

zenith angle, the GSFLAI is not affected by them (Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012]).195

Also, the time evolution of the GSFLAI and EUV flux rate will be shown together to196

demonstrate the correlation between the two types of data. The top panel of Fig. 2197

shows the time evolution of the GSFLAI and the EUV flux rate for an X class Solar flare198

classified as X6.2 according to GOES X-Ray flux data. It can be seen that they are well199

correlated. There are two points to note here:200

1. The EUV measurements by SEM-SOHO are lagging behind the GSFLAI measure-201

ments by 20-30 seconds. This lag, which is corrected for, is coincident with the one202

found by Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012] working at 1 Hz, and it is smaller than the time203

resolution of the GPS data used in this study (30 seconds).204

2. After a peak in the GSFLAI and EUV flux rate, the GSFLAI is not able to follow205

the EUV rate (GSFLAI decreases slowly), likely due to the slow recombination rate of206

the ionosphere compared to its sudden ionization rate.207

Furthermore, the typical correlation between GSFLAI and EUV flux rate is shown for M208

and C class flares in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 2, respectively. An M3.5 flare209

that occurred on 30 November 2001 and a C5.3 flare that occurred on July 22 2004 are210

chosen for this. A very good correlation can be seen in both cases. An important thing to211

observe is that the GSFLAI (and EUV flux rate) presents a higher peak in the case of the212

(weeker) C5.3 flare. This result stems from the fact that flare classification is made on the213

basis of the X-Ray flux, which is relatively transparent to the Solar atmosphere, in contrast214

to the EUV rays. Therefore a lot of EUV radiation is absorbed in the Solar atmosphere215

if the source of the Solar flare is farther from the Solar disk center. This is true in this216

case as the source of the C5.3 flare was located closer to the Solar disk center (N04E10)217

D R A F T November 6, 2015, 4:51pm D R A F T



X - 12 TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT

when compared to the source of the M3.5 flare (S07E54). Indeed, the location of the218

flare in the Solar disc is important for the ionospheric response to the flare. The influence219

of the flare’s location has already been studied and discussed in Hernández-Pajares et220

al. [2012] in which the excellent correlation between the direct EUV Solar flux rate and221

ionospheric over-ionization (measured at a global scale by many GPS receivers) was not222

observed when the X-band Solar flux rate was considered. In this way, by considering a223

simple model (dependence on the cosine of the Solar flare angular distance to the Solar224

disc center) for the EUV flux extinction in the Solar atmosphere (which does not affect225

the X-band radiation, as it is well known), both kind of measurements were in agreement,226

as is shown in Fig. 9 of Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012].227

Similar to the relationship between the GSFLAI and the SOHO-EUV flux rate, we find228

a good correlation between the GSFLAI and GOES-EUVI irradiance rate (see Fig. 3).229

At the moment, the GOES EUV irradiance data is only available at the cadence of 1230

minute from ftp://satdat.ngdc.noaa.gov/sem/goes/data/new avg. Future231

work can focus on extending the study of the relationship between GSFLAI and the232

GOES-EUVI irradiance rate.233

Nevertheless, it can be seen that, in the case of low and mid geo-effectiveness Solar234

flares, the amount of noise could masks the shape of the underlying function between235

the cosine of χ and the GSFLAI index. Although the method used in this work allows236

for the rejection of the outliers, and therefore allows finding of the correct slope, which is237

consistent with the hypothesis of the model as shown in Eq. 1, it does not allow for the fact238

that there might be other dependencies that are not captured by the model. In particular,239

by trying another method (one-dimensional median filter -Pratt [1979]- plus a zero phase240

D R A F T November 6, 2015, 4:51pm D R A F T



TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT X - 13

low pass filter designed by means of the Kaiser window -Hamming [1989]-) we have found241

that for weak and mid-intensity flares, the underlying dependency consistently manifests242

some consistent nonlinear dependencies (low-frequency oscillations along the regression243

line, see Fig. 4), which deserves investigation in further work.244

6.2. Relationship between GSFLAI and direct EUV flux rate measurements

Direct comparison of the GSFLAI and the SOHO/SEM Solar EUV flux rate is shown245

in Fig. 5 for strong, mid and weak Solar flares. An almost linear relationship is observed,246

which is in full agreement with Eq. 1. Table 1 summarizes the linear relationships obtained247

on linear fitting of the data (fifth and seventh columns on one hand, and sixth and eigth248

columns on the other hand -filtered in the last case to points with maximum ionization249

increase per flare-). It was observed that the slope of these fittings (0.18, 0.13 and 0.11250

TECU/109/cm2/s for X, M and C class Solar flares with correlation factors 0.83, 0.63251

and 0.46, respectively) are in agreement, but with some initial differences for each class.252

Indeed, the slope is slightly greater for strong Solar flares and slightly lower for weak Solar253

flares. This effect is attributed to two reasons:254

1. Points considered immediately after a peak in GSFLAI are not so well correlated with255

the EUV flux rate, likely due to the slower recombination rate. This effect is predominant256

in higher intensity flares so that they show a slightly greater slope of GSFLAI vs EUV257

flux rate.258

2. The measurement/modelling of noise in lower intensity flares tends to decrease the259

slope of the GSFLAI vs EUV flux rate graph.260

To check the validity of the above explanations, we plotted only those points corre-261

sponding to the highest GSFLAI for each given flare and which had an EUV flux rate262

D R A F T November 6, 2015, 4:51pm D R A F T



X - 14 TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT

(in units photons · 109/cm2/s2) greater than 0.00751. Points satisfying this criteria are263

plotted in Fig. 6 along with their regression line. This resulted in the selection of only264

those points that corresponded to maximum ionization, rather than recombination and265

were less affected by measurement/modelling noise. Fitting a straight line to these points266

gave almost identical results (slopes of 0.152-0.159 TECU/109/cm2/s) for all intensities267

of flare. These results are summarized in Table 1 (columns 4 and 6). We also observe in268

the same table, that the correlation factor of the GSFLAI vs EUV flux rate data increases269

very significantly after restricting our selection of data points as mentioned above (up270

to 0.94, 0.70 and 0.94 for X, M and C classes, respectively). This result confirms that271

other sources of ionospheric activity such as that of Medium Scale TIDs (see for example272

Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012b]), geomagnetic storms or scintillation, are mostly filtered273

out in our model. This is due to the fitting requirement at each epoch such that the274

VTEC rate measurements should be dependent on the Solar-zenith angle computed in275

the ionospheric pierce point (IPP) in the ionospheric thin shell, χ (see Eq. 2), either for276

the weakest C-class flares.277

Also as explained in Section 2, we observe that, as expected, the intercept is greater for278

those flares that cause more ionization at cosχ = 0, which is generally in the decreasing279

order of X, M and C class flares.280

7. Conclusions

Through this paper, it is demonstrated how GNSS (by means of the GNSS Solar Flare281

Activity Indicator, GSFLAI) can become an efficient Solar observational instrument in282

the characterization of all of kinds of geo-effective Solar flares with remarkable accuracy283

(which can be better than that of direct EUV flux detectors on board spacecraft2). Indeed,284

D R A F T November 6, 2015, 4:51pm D R A F T



TALWINDER ET. AL: GPS AS A SOLAR OBSERVATIONAL INSTRUMENT X - 15

an extensive study of X, M and C class flares occurred between January 2001 and March285

2014 confirmed the use of GSFLAI as a proxy for EUV flux rate direct measurements286

(taken from the SOHO Solar probe instrument) during such strong, mid and even weak287

Solar flares, in a very consistent way. Such confirmation has been extended by first time to288

a second Solar probe providing direct EUV measurements; the GOES-EUVI data. In this289

way, global real-time networks of GNSS receivers (such as the one supporting the above290

mentioned MONITOR project) are already becoming Solar sensors. This role extends291

the previous usage of GNSS data to detect and characterize Solar flares (an example is292

the Sunlit Ionosphere Sudden TEC Enhancement Detector, SISTED, see section 7.4 in293

Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012]).294

distance to the Solar disc center is corrected, as was shown in Hernández-Pajares et al. [2012] (Fig. 9 and associated

comments).
