Abstract. In this study we present a geometric approach to proxy economic uncertainty. We design a 
positional indicator of disagreement among survey-based agents’ expectations about the state of the 

economy. Previous dispersion-based uncertainty indicators derived from business and consumer 

surveys exclusively make use of the two extreme pieces of information: the percentage of respondents 

expecting a variable to rise and to fall. With the aim of also incorporating the information coming 

from the share of respondents expecting a variable to remain constant, we propose a geometrical 

framework and use a barycentric coordinate system to generate a measure of disagreement, referred to 

as a discrepancy indicator. We assess its performance both empirically and experimentally by 

comparing it to the standard deviation of the share of positive and negative responses. When applied in 

sixteen European countries, we find that both time-varying metrics co-evolve in most countries for 

expectations about the country’s overall economic situation in the present, but not in the future. 

Additionally, we obtain their simulated sampling distributions and we find that the proposed indicator 

gravitates uniformly towards the three vertices of the simplex representing the three answering 

categories, as opposed to the standard deviation, which tends to overestimate the level of uncertainty 

as a result of ignoring the no-change responses. Consequently, we find evidence that the information 

coming from agents expecting a variable to remain constant has an effect on the measurement of 

disagreement.

1. Introduction 

 

The arrival of the 2008 financial crisis has triggered a body of research dedicated to 

analyse the impact of uncertainty on the economy (Ajmi et al., 2015; Arslan et al., 2015; 

Atalla et al., 2016; Balcilar et al., 2017; Binder, 2017; Binding and Dibiasi, 2017; Bloom, 

2014; Caggiano et al., 2014; Chua et al., 2011; Dovern, 2015; Fernández-Villaverde et 

al., 2015; Hartmann et al., 2017; Henzel and Rengel, 2017; Karnizova and Khan, 2015; 

Mitchell et al., 2007; Mokinski et al., 2015; Perić and Sorić, 2017; Sorić and Lolić, 2017). 

Since economic uncertainty is not directly observable, several strategies have been 

proposed to measure it. 

A first approach focuses on tracking the magnitude of forecast errors of 

macroeconomic variables (Glass and Fritsche, 2014; Jurado et al., 2015). This approach 

is based on the assumption that in times of high uncertainty forecast errors are expected 

to rise, but its ex-post nature has led researchers to develop alternative approaches to 

measure economic uncertainty. 

A second approach is based on the assumption that notions about the future evolution 

of the economy are likely to be more disperse in times of high uncertainty. This premise 

allows to develop dispersion-based indicators. These measures can either be based on 

stock market volatility (Basu and Bundick, 2012; Bekaert et al., 2013; Bloom, 2009), or 

on agents’ economic expectations (Glass and Hartmann, 2016; Lahiri and Sheng, 2010; 

Mankiw et al., 2004; Mokinski et al., 2015). 

Direct measures of expectations can only be derived from surveys. Tendency surveys 

ask respondents whether they expect a variable to rise, fall or remain unchanged. By using 

agents’ expectations coming from economic tendency surveys, Bachman et al. (2013) 

proposed a set of uncertainty indicators based on the dispersion of respondents’ 

expectations about the future in Germany and the United States (US). Girardi and Reuter 

(2017) have recently presented three new dispersion-based uncertainty indicators derived 

from business and consumer surveys for the Euro Area (EA). 

All these dispersion-based indicators of disagreement among respondents elicit the 

information exclusively form the respondents expecting a variable to rise and to fall, 

leaving out the the responses from agents expecting no-change. This omission has led us 

to devise an approach that allows to derive a time-varying disagreement metric that 

incorporates the information coming from all three answering categories.

With this aim, we present a geometric setup to construct a positional indicator of 

disagreement that can be interpreted as the percentage of discrepancy among responses. 

We focus on agents’ expectations about the country’s situation regarding the overall 

economy both at present and by the end of the next six months. We compare the 

performance of the proposed measure of displacement to the standard deviation of the 

share of positive and negative responses, which has been used by Bachman et al. (2013) 

as a proxy for economic uncertainty. The analysis is carried out in sixteen European 

countries, focusing on the period prior to the start of the 2008 financial crisis, which 

provides a natural backdrop for the experiment. Finally, we simulate the sampling 

distribution of both indicators to further assess their performance. 

The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section introduces the data. In 

Section 3 we present the methodological approach. Empirical results are provided in 

Section 4. Finally, concluding remarks and future lines of research are drawn in Section 

5. 

 

2. Survey data on expectations 

 

Uncertainty is unobservable. Economic uncertainty can be defined as the situation in 

which economic agents are not able to anticipate future events or estimate the likelihood 

of their occurrence (Knight, 1921). Since the advent of the 2008 financial crisis, there has 

been a renewed interest in the measurement of economic uncertainty. Baker et al. (2016) 

designed the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index, which is based on three 

components: a media index of economic uncertainty, the number of federal expiring tax 

code provisions and a disagreement measure based on the responses from the Surveys of 

Professional Forecasters. 

While the development of machine learning techniques increasingly facilitates the 

generation of ad-hoc media indexes of frequencies of keyword combinations related to 

uncertainty that avoid the pre-labelling of the data (Azqueta-Gavaldón, 2017), this 

approach still entails a non-negligible degree of subjectivity (Girardi and Reuter, 2017). 

As a result, based on the assumption that the dispersion of expectations increases during 

periods of high uncertainty, one of the most common approaches to proxy economic 

uncertainty is to use measures of disagreement among survey expectations (Giordani and 

Söderlind 2003; Glass and Hartmann, 2016; Lahiri and Sheng, 2010; Mokinski et al., 

2015; Rich and Tracy 2010; Zarnowitz and Lambros 1987).

Economic expectations are not directly observable, and therefore are elicited through 

survey data. Recent research has shown that the data provided by business and consumer 

tendency surveys is particularly useful in order to derive uncertainty measures based on 

the dispersion of expectations (Bachmann et al., 2013; Mokinski et al., 2015). Bachmann 

et al. (2013) found that during times of high uncertainty respondents tend to give more 

heterogeneous answers to the questions focused on relevant economic variables. As a 

result, the authors approximated uncertainty by the degree of disagreement among 

economic forecasters by means of three alternative proxies. In a recent research, Girardi 

and Reuter (2017) have proposed three new dispersion-based uncertainty indicators 

derived from economic tendency surveys. 

These measures are based on the responses that fall into the two extreme answering 

categories, that is, the respondents expecting a variable to increase and the ones expecting 

it to decrease. In this study, we want to evaluate the effect of incorporating the information 

coming from the respondents expecting a variable to remain constant. 

With this aim we use raw data from the World Economic Survey (WES) carried out 

quarterly by the Ifo Institute for Economic Research since 1981. The WES assesses 

worldwide economic trends by polling more than 1000 professionals and experts 

worldwide on current economic developments in their respective countries. The WES 

only provides three answering options: “good/better/higher” for a positive assessment, 

“satisfactory/about the same/no change” for a neutral assessment, and “bad/worse/lower” 

for a negative assessment. The survey does not provide a “do not know” option as other 

surveys such as the joint harmonised EU consumer survey conducted by the European 

Commission. Białowolski (2016) notes that professional respondents show lower biases 

in responding to survey questions than consumers, who tend to show a negative response 

pattern. For a detailed analysis of WES data see Garnitz (2017) and Hutson et al. (2014). 

We focus on the question about the country’s situation in terms of its overall economy, 

both present and future. We use the shares of respondents expecting a variable to go up, 

to go down or to remain unchanged during the period ranging from 2005:Q2 to 2008:Q4. 

This time frame allows us to capture the evolution of expectations prior to a significant 

impending shock in sixteen European countries countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, 

France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, 

Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom).

In Fig. 1 we compare the evolution of no-change expectations (percentage 

respondents expecting their country’s economic situation to remain constant) to the year-

on-year GDP growth rates. We use quarterly GDP data from the OECD 

(https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart). Overall, it can be seen that 

in most countries the proportion of no-change responses remains low and fairly constant 

up until 2007, when it significantly rises as the economic activity starts to fall. As a result, 

it seems that the share of no-change responses behaves counter-cyclically, suddenly 

increasing during periods of high uncertainty.

In Table 1 we present the summary statistics for the proportion of no-change 

responses. Results corroborate the counter-cyclical behaviour observed in Fig. 1. In most 

countries we obtain a negative and significant correlation between the evolution of no-

change responses and GDP growth. This inverse relation has led us to devise a geometric 

approach to derive a time-varying uncertainty proxy based on disagreement among 

respondents that allows incorporating the information coming from all three answering 

categories. Geometry has previously been used to determine the likelihood of 

disagreement among election outcomes (Saari, 2008), but never before in this context. 

 

3. Methodology 

 

In this section we present a geometric approach to derive a dispersion-based measure of 

positional disagreement. The proposed framework allows to capture the proportion of 

discrepancy among survey respondents in any given period by means of spatial vectors. 

Tendency surveys are addressed to economic agents in order to elicit subjective measures 

of their expectations about the state of the economy. Respondents are asked about the 

expected direction of change of a wide range of variables (inflation, consumption, etc.). 

In this study we focus on the expectations about the country’s situation in terms of its 

overall economy, both at present and by end of the next six months. 

Survey results are available about one quarter ahead of the publication of quantitative 

official data and are usually presented as balances, 𝐵𝑡 , which consist on the subtraction 

between the weighted percentage of respondents expecting a variable to go up (𝑅𝑡) and 

to go down (𝐹𝑡), where 𝑡 = 1, … , 𝑛. Nevertheless, survey results can be aggregated in a 

three dimensional vector denoted as 𝑉𝑡: 

 

 
tttt

F,E,RV    (1) 

 

where 𝐸𝑡 refers to the proportion of respondents expecting the variable to remain constant. 

The variance of the balance could be defined as: 

 
2

tttt
BFRD    (2) 

 

Theil (1955) defined expression (2) as the disconformity coefficient, due to the fact 

that the value of 𝐷𝑡  would reach the minimum value zero when all the responses are 

concentrated in either one of the two categories. The maximum disconformity, 



8 

 

corresponding to a value of one, would take place, if and only if, 𝑅𝑡  and 𝐹𝑡  each 

accumulates half of the responses. Expression (2) implicitly neglects the variate 𝐸𝑡. As a 

result, the ‘no-change’ proportion is not directly incorporated into the disagreement 

metric. Claveria (2010) proposed a nonlinear variation of the balance statistic that 

accounted for this percentage of respondents:

where 𝑊𝐵𝑡  refers to the weighted balance, as it weights 𝐵𝑡  by the proportion of 

respondents expecting a variable to rise or fall in order to discriminate between two equal 

values of 𝐵𝑡 obtained for different values of 𝐸𝑡. This potential scenario is illustrated in 

Table 2, in which we show how the same value of the balance can be obtained for different 

combinations of 𝑅𝑡 and 𝐹𝑡.

Note: R refers to the share of “improvement” responses, E to the share of neutral responses, F to 

the share of “deterioration” responses, and B refers to the balance statistic. 
 

Bachmann et al. (2013) used an economic uncertainty proxy denoted as 𝐷𝐼𝑆𝑃𝑡 that 

can be defined as the square root of 𝐷 at time t: 

 
2

tttt
BFRDISP    (4) 

 

The authors applied this measure to the forward-looking survey question related to 

the expectations of domestic production activities in Germany at the micro level. Girardi 

et al. (2017) developed an aggregate variation of expression (4) in order to compute the 

cross-sectional standard deviation of the share of positive and negative responses for all 

forward-looking survey questions, and then standardised the question-specific measures 

and rescaled the average dispersion.  

With the aim of incorporating the information coming from the respondents expecting 

no-change in the variable, we develop a methodological framework that allows to 

construct a measure of disagreement that conveys a geometrical interpretation. The 

proposed metric presents two inherent advantages. On the one hand, it allows to capture 



9 

 

the trajectories of the three states. On the other hand, it has a self-explanatory 

interpretation, as it provides the proportion of disagreement among respondents.  

In order to explicitly incorporate the three components of the surveys (𝑅𝑡, 𝐸𝑡 , 𝐹𝑡), we 

assume that no-change responses can proxy either one of the extreme options. Note that 

the fraction of answers falling into the ‘no-change’ category is conveying the information 

about the confidence on the other two categories. Kahneman (2011) noted that when faced 

with a difficult question, respondents often choose an easier one instead. See Białowolski 

(2015) for an in-depth analysis of the concept of confidence in tendency surveys. 

As the sum of the proportions adds to a constant, a natural representation of the 

answers will be as a point on a simplex (Coxeter, 1969). A simplex could be defined as 

the smallest convex set containing the given vertices. We will use a two-dimensional 

simplex, which corresponds to a triangle. The interior of this simplex encompasses all 

possible combinations of proportions between the three answering categories. 

The equilateral triangle 𝑆 can be defined by its three vertices {x, y, z} (see left panel 

of Fig. 2). A simplex in ℝ3  can be defined as 𝑎1𝑥 + 𝑎2𝑦 + 𝑎3𝑧  , such that  𝑎1 + 𝑎2 +

𝑎3 = 1  and 𝑎1, 𝑎2, 𝑎3  ≥ 0, where 𝑎1, 𝑎2 and 𝑎3 stand for the three proportions defined 

in (1). These proportions can be regarded as the barycentric coordinates of a point with 

respect to 𝑆. Therefore, each point inside 𝑆 has a unique convex combination of the three 

vertices determined by the set of aggregated survey results. 

The barycentric coordinate system allows us to compute the vertical distance of a 

point in the simplex to the nearest edge, as it can be seen in the right panel of Fig. 2. As 

there are two degrees of freedom, any set of barycentric coordinates and their 

corresponding basis vectors can be used to define the location of any point within 𝑆.

Once we have defined the location of the point within the simplex, we formalise a 

measure of consensus. We aim to define a measure that summarises the notion that if the 

coordinate on the simplex is near a vertex, there is a general agreement in the survey about 

that particular result. Conversely, if the coordinate is near the barycentre, which is the 

point of equal barycentric coordinates, one would expect little agreement on the opinions 

among the respondents. Thus, the center of the simplex indicates the point of maximum 

discrepancy among respondents. We can then compute a metric of consensus as a ratio 

on the simplex as follows: 

 

Concentration = 
Distance of Observation Point to Barycentre

Distance of Vertex to Barycentre
 (5) 

 

Given that all vertices are at the same distance to the barycentre, this ratio gives the 

relative weight of the distance of each point in time to the center of the triangle. We can 

then formalise concentration for period 𝑡 as 𝐶𝑡 as:

Consequently, the proposed geometry-based disagreement measure, which will be 

referred to as a discrepancy indicator, can be defined as the opposite of consensus:

4. Empirical results 

 

In this section we apply the methodology presented in the previous section to sixteen 

European countries. First, we project survey answers in the simplex for each period of the 

sample (2005:Q2-2008:Q4). As an example, in Fig. 3 we show the projections for the last 

three quarters of the sample prior to the crisis, both for the expectations about the current 

situation and the situation expected by the end of the next six months in Germany. As it 

can be seen, each projected point in the simplex corresponds to the barycentric 

coordinates determined by a specific combination of aggregated proportions of each of 

the three answering categories for any given period.

determined by the set of aggregated shares for each response category in that period. 

 

Second, by means of the barycentric coordinates of each point we compute 𝐺𝑡. To 

assess the performance of this metric of positional discrepancy we compare it to the 

uncertainty proxy proposed by Bachmann et al. (2013) defined in (4). Both indicators are 

bounded between zero and one. A one value indicates maximum disagreement, while zero 

maximum consensus. Additionally, we compute the expectational forecast errors by 

transforming survey indicators of the WES into quantitative estimates of economic 

growth using the coincident and the leading conversion indicators suggested by Claveria 

et al. (2017). Expectational errors can be regarded as the difference between actual values 

of a variable and quantified expectations arising from the limited ability of agents to 

predict the movements of the actual variable (Lee, 1994).

In Table 3 we present the mean and the standard deviation displayed by both 

dispersion-based disagreement measures. The fact that the proposed positional metric 

takes into account the share of no-change responses leads to lower mean values of 

disagreement in all countries. In Fig. 4 we can see that 𝐺𝑡 and the disagreement indicator 

proposed by Bachmann et al. (2013) applied to the expectations of the country’s overall 

economic situation co-evolve for the present, but not so much for the future (Fig. 5).  

With the aim of further assessing the performance of both indicators, we sample the 

simplex defined in Section 3. We generate a uniform set of points in the unit cube, and 

then normalise each point such that the sum of the coordinates is equal to one. This 

procedure is equivalent to projecting the distribution onto a plane in order to sample the 

simplex of both metrics of disagreement among respondents. 

In Fig. 6 we depict the overlapped non-normalised histograms of both statistics. While 

both distributions are similar and negatively skewed, the positional discrepancy indicator 

proposed in this study shows a fatter tail, suggesting a higher level of granularity. In Table 

4 we present the summary statistics of both simulated distributions. We complement them 

with the boxplots (Fig. 7), which represent the distribution through their quartiles without 

making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution. The interquartile range 

(IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion obtained as the difference between upper and 

lower quartiles, Q3−Q1. 

As shown in Fig. 7, the distribution of the discrepancy indicator encompasses a much 

wider range of the scale, and the distribution of scores is more uniform. The IQR in Table 

4 differs between both distributions, being significantly larger for 𝐺𝑡 . This result is 

indicative of a higher level of granularity for the median values of the distribution of the 

discrepancy indicator in comparison to Bachmann et al.’s (2013) disagreement indicator. 

In Fig. 8 we project the barycentric coordinates of the simulated points in the simplex 

for both indicators. We complement the graphs with a comparative histogram 

representing the percentage of area in each decile. The higher granularity of the indicator 

proposed in this article is manifested by the fact that the areas for each level of scores is 

more uniform, which also can be seen in the decile distribution. We can see that the 

proposed geometric indicator of discrepancy behaves uniformly in all three directions, 

while the disconformity indicator shows a wider area in which gives a maximum value 

of disagreement. This result is caused by not taking into account the share of no-change 

responses.

5. Concluding remarks 

 

This paper presents a geometrical framework to proxy economic uncertainty by means of 

a survey-based measure of disagreement among respondents. The fact that tendency 

surveys ask agents whether they expect a particular variable to increase, decrease or 

remain unchanged, has lead us to design an indicator that takes into account all three 

magnitudes. Previous dispersion-based uncertainty indicators derived from business and 

consumer surveys exclusively make use of the two extreme pieces of information, that is, 

the responses expecting a variable to rise and to fall. 

Our main aim was to incorporate the share of respondents expecting a variable to 

remain constant. With this objective, we project survey responses onto a simplex that 

takes the form of an equilateral triangle, and by means of spatial vectors we derive a 

measure of displacement that incorporates all three pieces of information. 

To assess the performance of the proposed measure of positional discrepancy we 

compare it, both empirically and experimentally, to the standard deviation of the share of 

positive and negative responses, which has been used by Bachman et al. (2013) as a 

measure of disagreement. First, we compute both measures for sixteen European 

countries, finding that they co-evolve during the sample period in most countries, 

especially for the expectations about the country’s current economic situation. 

Second, we generate the simulated sampling distributions of both the proposed 

geometric indicator of discrepancy and the disagreement measure used as a benchmark. 

In spite of the fact that both distributions are negatively skewed and similar, we find that 

the distribution of the proposed positional indicator of discrepancy shows a fatter tail, 

suggesting a higher level of granularity for the intermediate values, which is confirmed 

by a higher value of the interquartile range.  

By projecting the barycentric coordinates of the simulated points onto the simplex, 

we observe that the proposed discrepancy indicator gravitates uniformly towards the three 

vertices of the triangle, defined by the three answering categories. Conversely, the 

disagreement measure used as a benchmark tends to overestimate the level of uncertainty 

as a result of ignoring the no-change share of responses. Arguably, it seems that the 

information coming from agents expecting a variable to remain constant has an effect on 

the measurement of disagreement among survey respondents.

In spite of the novelty of the approach, the metric presented in the paper is not without 

limitations. The proposed geometrically-based discrepancy indicator is a measure of 

disagreement among survey respondents, and as such has to be considered a proxy of 

uncertainty, which is a latent variable. As noted by Girardi et al. (2017), the evolvement 

of survey-based disagreement indicators does not only reflect changes in underlying 

uncertainty levels, but also in heterogeneity among agents’ expectations. An issue left for 

further research is extending the construction of the indicator on the basis of responses to 

additional variables. Another line of future research is the analysis of the impact of the 

proposed uncertainty metric on economic activity.
