Abstract 

 

Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) methods include various collections of mathematical 

techniques related to decision support systems in non-deterministic environments to support 

such applications as facility management, disaster management and urban planning. This 

paper applies MCDA approaches based on qualitative reasoning techniques with linguistic 

labels assessment. The aim of this method is ranking multi-attribute alternatives in group 

decision-making with qualitative labels. Finally this method is applied to a case of urban 

planning in selection of the less energy consumption project in a geographical area in 

Catalonia.

1. Introduction 

Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) approaches under uncertainty and fuzzy systems are 

accepted as suitable techniques to deal with conflicting problems and in particular in energy 

analysis and planning. The sustainable energy planning include different variables, as the 

decision making is directly related to the management of different type of information with 

different aspects such as technological, environmental, economic and social. MCDA 

methods include various collections of mathematical techniques related to decision support 

systems in non-deterministic environments to support such applications as facility 

management, disaster management and urban planning. (Doukas et al., 2007; Figueira et 

al., 2005; Roy and Słowiński, 2013; Słowiński and Teghem, 1990; Wang et al., 2009). 

Urban energy systems present multiple identities with multiple criteria, which are subject to 

non-equivalent descriptions and the relevant aspects cannot be captured using a single 

perspective. For example in the case of buildings, an architect would describe the criteria in 

terms of volumes, shapes, materials and orientation. By contrast, sociologist would look at 

the people living in the building, and describe it according to demographic, cultural and 

socio-economic characteristics. Different persons with different backgrounds would focus 

on different aspects of the building according to what they consider relevant for the 

analysis. In order to deal with this issue, this study introduces the qualitative MCDA by 

using linguistic description applied to the SEMANCO (Semantic tools for carbon reduction 

in urban planning) project to assess the energy performance of urban plans and projects and 

to compare them against the baseline and against each other. In these cases, it is often 

difficult to obtain exact numerical values for criteria and indicators. In order to overcome 

this shortage, qualitative reasoning techniques integrated with MCDA, are capable of 

representing uncertainty, emulating skilled humans, and handling vague situations. 

Frequently, this uncertainty is captured by using linguistic terms or fuzzy numbers to 

evaluate the set of criteria or indicators (Dubois et al., 2003; Madrazo et al., 2014a). Agell 

et al. (2012) proposes a qualitative reasoning technique to overcome uncertainty in human 

judgments that involve vague information. In a decisional process, assessment and selection 

of alternatives derive from complex hierarchical comparisons among them, which are often 

based on conflict criteria. This method can be used as a systematic tool for sustainability 

assessment. Several studies on energy planning have been developed to help energy 

planners and policy makers to design strategies for energy system models (Beccali et al., 

2003; Gamboa and Munda, 2007; Kaya and Kahraman, 2011; Liu, 2007; Pohekar and 

Ramachandran, 2004; Polatidis et al., 2006; Tsoutsos et al., 2009). 

The aim of this paper is to analyze qualitative MCDA approaches with the distance 

function aggregations applied to urban energy systems. This paper considers the qualitative 

approach with linguistic labels for ranking multi-attribute alternatives in group decision-

making. This method is applied to the real case study of the SEMANCO project to provide 

an appropriate energy information framework. 

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes some relevant MCDA methods 

applied to energy planning and review different policy frames for energy management. 

Section 3 introduces a specific MCDA method where qualitative alternatives’ descriptions 

are considered. In Section 4, SEMANCO integrated platform application is presented in 

order to assess the energy performance and CO2 emissions of projected urban plans at city 

level. Finally, the last section highlights some conclusions and future research directions.

2. Related works and theoretical framework 

Since the 1950s and 1960s, when foundations of modern multi-criteria decision-making 

methods have been laid, many researches devoted their time to development of new multi-

criteria decision-making models and techniques. In the past decades, research and 

development in the field have accelerated to continue growing exponentially. However, the 

methodological choices and framework for assessment of decisions are still under 

discussion. The general purposes of MCDA are describing trade-offs among different 

objectives and structuring decision process, defining and selecting alternatives, criteria and 

weights and finally evaluating the results to make decisions. Most of MCDA approaches 

which can handle both quantitative and qualitative criteria, share the common 

characteristics of conflict among criteria and difficulties in design or selection of 

alternatives (Pohekar and Ramachandran, 2004; Wang et al., 2009). 

A large number of multi-criteria techniques have been developed to deal with problems 

with different objectives such as choice, ranking and sorting or classification problems. 

There are several methods base on priority, outranking, distance or mixed methods which 

can be applied to these problems. A decision-maker is required to choose relevant method 

in each problem. In the case of energy problems, multi-criteria methods should be simple to 

promise transparency, consider the intensity of preferences and be partially. These features 

are difficult to gather in one specific method simultaneously. In energy planning issue, the 

group of studies address to the significant potential of MCDA techniques in the urban 

energy systems or direct relevance to the use of energy in cities which can be found in 

(Blondeau et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2008; Dutta and Husain, 2009; Hsieh et al., 2004; 

Keirstead et al., 2012; Medineckiene et al., 2014; Mosadeghi et al., 2015; Qin et al., 2008; 

Wang et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2002; Zavadskas and Antuchevičiene, 2004; Zavadskas 

and Antucheviciene, 2006). 

Among all categorization in MCDA, reference point and outranking methods are widely 

used in the case of ranking problems (Beccali et al., 2003; Loken, 2007). The study of 

ranking process is considered as a interest issue by computer science and artificial 

intelligence in the field of decision making, learning and reasoning (Belton and Stewart, 

2002; Zadeh, 2001). In this case, one of the active subfield of research in artificial 

intelligence is Qualitative Reasoning (QR) which tries to understand and explain human 

beings’ ability to reason without having exact information. The main objective of QR is to 

develop systems that permit operating in conditions of insufficient or without numerical 

data. Most of the selection elements cannot be given precisely and the evaluation data of 

the suitability of alternatives for subjective criteria are usually expressed in linguistic terms 

by the decision-makers preferences. There exist many different representation formats that 

can be used in each model, i.e., preference orderings, utility values, multiplicative 

preference relations and fuzzy preference relations among others. 

Qualitative reasoning is able to reason at a qualitative or symbolic level directly in terms of 

orders-of-magnitude. To represent non-trivial domain knowledge, the patterns or 

alternatives to be ranked are characterized by a set of features, which are evaluated by each 

actor through linguistic labels corresponding to ordinal values. 

Order-of-magnitude models are among the essential theoretical tools available for 

qualitative reasoning about real systems. They aim to capture order-of-magnitude 

commonsense inferences, as used by human beings in the real world. A general qualitative 

algebra structure was defined on the absolute order-of-magnitude model, providing a

mathematical foundation unifying sign algebra and interval algebra through a continuum of 

qualitative structures built from the roughest to the finest partition of the real line. 

Specifically, the one-dimensional absolute order-of-magnitude model works with a finite 

number of qualitative labels corresponding to an ordinal scale of measurement (Travé-

Massuyès et al., 2005). 

Techniques based on order-of-magnitude qualitative reasoning have provided theoretical 

models that can obtain results from non-numeric variables. The main advantage of this 

method is the capability to deal with problems in such a way that the principle of relevance 

is preserved, that is, each variable is valued with the level of precision required. Other 

advantage is that it tackles the problem of integrating the representation of existing 

uncertainty within the group (Forbus, 1984). In the following section we are going to 

introduce the algorithm description of the method in this framework. 

 

3. A Multi-Criteria Decision Aid method 

Agell et al. introduced in 2012 a qualitative approach for ranking alternatives motivated by 

the Reference Point Method which ranks the alternatives by using a distance function 

defined on the absolute order-of-magnitude qualitative space. This technique uses 

qualitative assessments of alternatives and minimizes the distance between them and a 

certain target point that models the best performance for each criterion considered. It deals 

with the problem in such a way that the principle of relevance is preserved. Depends on the 

features of each variable, the number of labels chosen to describe a real problem is not 

fixed. 

In this method, the absolute order-of-magnitude qualitative space is used for the process of 

moving from the ordinal scale of the original data set to a cardinal scale by codifying the 

labels using location function. The space of k-dimensional vectors of labels, being k the 

product of the number of experts (m) by the number of criteria (r), allows the representation 

of alternatives from linguistic evaluations of experts by basic or non-basic labels with 

different granularity (Fig. 1). The basic labels, corresponding to linguistic terms, are 

defined by a discretization given by a set a1, …, n of real numbers as landmarks,            

Bi = [ai, ai+1] (where i= 1, …, n). The non-basic labels describing different levels of 

precision, are defined as [Bi, Bj] = [ai, ai+1] (where i= 1, …, n).

A location function introduced as an element in 2 is defined by the addition of measures 
of basic label to its right and to its left (Formula 1): 

     , 1 ,i jl B B i n j        (1) 

This function codifies each alternative via a 2-k dimensional vector of integer numbers. The 

vector (Bn, …, Bn) is considered as a reference label to compute distances. The location 

function is applied to each component of the k-dimensional vector of labels representing an 

alternative. As a result, each alternative is codified via a vector in 2k. In order to rank the 
alternatives, the Euclidean distance of each alternative to this reference vector with respect 

to different criteria is computed. Finally alternatives are ranked according to their minimum 

distance to the reference label (Formula 2):

The following section presents one of the challenging applications and domains in which 

the method presented has been used in the urban energy planning area. 

 

4. SEMANCO Integrated Platform Application 

Energy is a significant factor for economic development of countries. As economy 

advances and human society requires more energy, the problem of reducing CO2 emissions 

in cities has given rise to a serious contradiction among energy supply, environment 

protection and economic development. It is necessary to change the energy structure, 

integrating new models and modifying the way we use energy such as improving the 

energy efficiency of buildings by means of an urban energy system model. 
The building sector has significant impacts on communities. At the same time, it is the 

sector with the highest cost and environmental saving potentials provided effective 

strategies are implemented.  

Buildings are responsible for 33% of worldwide energy-related GHG emissions; also it has 

been identified as a sector where huge savings can be made. For example, of the 40% of 

energy consumed by buildings in the European Union (EU), estimates reveal that the 

implementation of energy-efficiency measures could lead to cost-saving of around 28% 

(Ekins and Lees, 2008). Therefore, the built environment is arguably a sector that can play 

an important role in mitigating climate change impacts, reducing energy use and natural 

resources (Abanda et al., 2013; Robert and Kummert, 2012). 

So, it is not a mistake that in small and big cities sustainability practitioners focus their 

attention on improving building performance.  

In the SEMANCO project, semantic technologies have been used to create models of urban 

energy systems able to assess the energy performance of an urban area to make informed 

decisions about how to reduce CO2 emissions in cities. The goal of the SEMANCO 

research project is to create a comprehensive framework in which semantic energy 

information brings the data sources at different scales from different domains. 

This integration of data from multiple sources with different tools is handled by a Semantic 

Energy Information Framework (SEIF), a key technological component developed in the 

project (Madrazo et al., 2014a). This framework is the connection between the different 

data sources and the tools which use the semantically modeled data (Fig. 3). 

In the integrated platform, the experts’ knowledge is captured through the use case 

methodology, as well as the links to the external data sources which are available via the 

SEIF. This combination of knowledge and information constitutes the base for creating 

energy models for a specific urban area. 

Ontology can be used to create shared vocabularies which help experts from different fields 

to establish relationships between certain objects of an urban energy system according to 

their knowledge and experience (Gruber, 1992). It can serve to promote communication 

between the semantically modeled data and the various software applications used by 

experts. This ontology has been applied to three case studies in the SEMANCO project, 

first at the building scale and later on at the urban level. 

Different scenarios located in Copenhagen (Denmark), Manresa (Spain) and the Newcastle 

(United Kingdom) will enable defining the scope of the research and outlining the 

specifications for the tools needed by stakeholders in different domains (Fig. 4). Use cases 

defined by means of these templates are a foundation in the ontology building process.

The platform shown in Fig. 5 has been designed to support services for different user 

groups. Real energy and different information such as socio-economic information can be 

obtained before and after implementation of some actions. The description of building 

typologies will consider the energy carriers used and final use within the building in 

building and neighborhood levels. 

Experts can represent the existing conditions of the urban system (descriptive model), 

analyze the future evolution of the system (predictive model), explore different scenarios 

for future development (exploratory model) and propose improvement plans and evaluate 

projects to improve the performance of the urban energy system (planning model) using 

multi-criteria decision aid tools (Madrazo et al., 2014b). 

The MCDA tool compares alternatives in order to decide which improvements might be 

most suitable by generating a new plan. Figure 6 shows that each plan has a set of project 

attached to consider the effect of different interventions for example window improvement,

heating system improvement, roof isolation and adding renewable thermal energy supply. 

The user can switch back to the plan interface and use the multi-criteria tool developed to 

compare the interventions contained within each project. This helps them decide which 

project they would prefer to enact in practice.

In order to illustrate the use of the MCDA tool within the SEMANCO integrated platform, 

Let us consider a case where a plan has been created to refit the set of buildings and three 

projects proposing different ways of doing this have been created. The basic results from 

these can be seen in the following section. 

 

5. Results 

In this section, the results provided by qualitative MCDA applied to SEMANCO platform 

are presented. Indicators are crucial components in the overall assessment of progress 

towards sustainable development. In this study, the indicators shown in Table 2 are 

considered according to the calculation methods and input indeeds. On the other hand, two 

qualitative criteria which are ease of implementation and social acceptability are also 

considered to use the advantage of expert`s assessment by means of qualitative MCDA 

approach. 

According to the given relative importance via experts, different possible improvement 

types (such as solar PV, heat pumps and extra insulation) for each of these indicators are 

defined as Project A, Project B and Project C beside the baseline (current plan), which is 

denoted by the plan’s name Policy change, is also considered in the analysis (Fig. 7). The 

calculated baseline will be a reference to assess the effectiveness of the improvement plans 

developed for the last round of demonstration scenarios. 

The steps of the qualitative MCDA algorithm, mentioned in Section 3, are executed. To this 

end, the highest score of each criterion are respectively considered as the reference label of 

the qualitative space. Table 3 shows these qualitative labels together with their locations, 

obtained directly from Equation 1.

The first step of this algorithm is assigning qualitative labels to the quantitative scores to 

simplify the computation in the process of ranking. The qualitative MCDA approach 

considered in this example uses different basic qualitative labels with different granularity 

for each criterion which corresponds to several intervals whose length is defined via the 

distance of minimum and maximum scores (see Table 4). Then, the Euclidean distance of 

each alternative from two reference labels is calculated by means of Formula 2. Finally, 

these values are combined to give a single ranking for each improvement type. The 

intention is not that the output from this tool should be followed in an absolute manner but 

rather that it should serve to aid decision makers by clarifying their intentions. Table 5 

shows the values of the distance of each alternative to the reference labels. According to the 

minimum distance values, the following ranking is presented: Project C > Project B > 

Baseline > Project A.

On the basis of the current plan, Project C is better in all indicators except social 

acceptability which has a minimum importance among other indicators. In the comparison 

of best options, project C is a winner in quantitative indicators and project B in qualitative 

ones. So, being the weights of qualitative indicators more important can cause a ranking 

reversal between these two options. 

The method uses for ranking these projects, does not require the handling of the previous 

discretization or definition of landmarks to define initial qualitative terms because the 

calculations are performed directly with the labels so the computations are very fast and 

easy. Table 6 shows the features of qualitative MCDA method.

Additionally, the qualitative MCDA method can address different levels of precision, from 

the basic labels, which represent the most precise ones to the least precise label which can 

be used to represent unknown values. So, it is possible to guarantee transparency and the 

intensity of preferences is considered.  

 

6. Conclusion and future work 

The proposed qualitative MCDA approaches are applied to the urban energy system to help 

policy makers and users in choosing appropriate decisions.  

Energy consumption in cities has attracted significant research in recent years. Integrated 

platforms, as the one considered in this paper, provide an appropriate information 

framework for energy planners. The case study analyzed by SEMANCO project provides 

access to semantically modeled energy-related data. This access is crucial for the cities 

decision makers to analyze and reduce carbon emission in their cities.

The study of qualitative MCDA approach using linguistic description for preference 

aggregations modeling in energy planning has been performed. To do so, the qualitative 

approach with linguistic labels introduced by Agell et al. (2012) for ranking multi-attribute 

alternatives in group decision making is considered. In the paper it is shown that the 

qualitative method gives the experts the ability of dealing with uncertainty, establishes an 

appropriate evaluation framework for group decision-making and allows considering the 

intensity of preferences in decision aid. However, it has been pointed out that the feature of 

compensation is a shortage of this method in problems where the disadvantage of one 

indicator cannot be compensated by the advantage of another. As future research, the role 

of the weights of indicators will be studied. In addition, a real case study will be performed 

in the city of Manresa in Catalonia, considering data gathered in SEMANCO project.
