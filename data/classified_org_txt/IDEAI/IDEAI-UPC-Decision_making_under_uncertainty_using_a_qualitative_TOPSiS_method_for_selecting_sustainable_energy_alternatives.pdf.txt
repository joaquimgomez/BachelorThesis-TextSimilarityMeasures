Abstract		
 
Multi-criteria decision-making methods support decision makers in all stages of the decision-making process by 
providing useful data. However, criteria are not always certain as uncertainty is a feature of the real world. Multi-
criteria decision-making methods under uncertainty and fuzzy systems are accepted as suitable techniques in 
conflicting problems that cannot be represented by numerical values, in particular in energy analysis and planning. 
In this paper, a modified TOPSIS method for multi-criteria group decision-making with qualitative linguistic labels 
is proposed. This method addresses uncertainty considering different levels of precision. Each decision maker's 
judgment on the performance of alternatives with respect to each criterion is expressed by qualitative linguistic 
labels. The new method takes into account linguistic data provided by the decision makers without any previous 
aggregation. Decision maker judgments are incorporated into the proposed method to generate a complete ranking 
of alternatives. An application in energy planning is presented as an illustrative case example in which energy policy 
alternatives are ranked. Seven energy alternatives under nine criteria were evaluated according to the opinion of 
three environmental and energy experts. The weights of the criteria are determined by fuzzy AHP, and the 
alternatives are ranked using qualitative TOPSIS. The proposed approach is compared with a modified fuzzy 
TOPSIS method, showing the advantages of the proposed approach when dealing with linguistic assessments to 
model uncertainty and imprecision. Although the new approach requires less cognitive effort to decision makers, it 
yields similar results.

2 Qualitative TOPSIS for selecting energy alternatives  

Introduction	
Since social and economic development is affected by the appropriate energy planning, evaluating sustainable 

energy alternatives when determining valid energy policies is essential. However, assessing and selecting the most 
suitable and sustainable types of energy in a geographical area is a complex problem. For governments and 
businesses, important decisions include whether to establish energy systems in a given place and deciding which 
energy source, or combination of sources, is the best option when considering potentially conflicting criteria 
including environmental, technical and economic aspects (Baños et al., 2011; Karimi et al., 2011). These criteria in 
energy problems involve different qualitative and quantitative variables and require specific techniques to aggregate 
and summarize assessments made in such complex situations. 

Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches, introduced in the early 1970s, are powerful tools used for 
evaluating problems and addressing the process of making decisions with multiple criteria. MCDM involves 
structuring decision processes, defining and selecting alternatives, determining criteria formulations and weights, 
applying value judgments and evaluating the results to make decisions in design, or selecting alternatives with 
respect to multiple conflicting criteria (Carlsson and Fullér 1996; Yilmaz and Dağdeviren 2011). Moreover, MCDM 
techniques have a strong decision support focus and interact with other disciplines such as intelligent systems 
dealing with uncertainty. Some of the currently used MCDM methods, in which the present study can be included, 
support decision makers in all stages of the decision-making process by providing useful data to assess criteria with 
uncertain values (Kara and Onut 2010). 

The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), developed by Hwang and 
Yoon (1981), is one of the most well-known distance-based approaches for such decision making. TOPSIS ranks the 
alternatives with respect to their geometric distance from the positive and negative ideal solutions. This approach is 
categorized as one of the MCDM methods in which value judgments of criteria are expressed through crisp values. 
However, in real situations when analyzing and quantifying different types of variables from different spheres, it is 
generally found that the information is imprecise and lacks crispness due to inaccurate estimates of values from 
decision maker judgments (Herrera et al., 2008, Parreiras et al., 2010). Thus, in real situations, where the 
information is imprecise, the alternatives can be better assessed by means of fuzzy sets or linguistic variables 
(Herrera et al., 2008; Ashtiani et al., 2009). In particular, in the case of MCDM under uncertainty, fuzzy systems 
have been proven to provide very suitable techniques for a remarkable range of real-world problems and, in 
particular, in energy planning. This is because these processes have many sources of uncertainty, long time frames, 
intensive investments, multiple decision makers and many conflicting criteria (Liu, 2007; Tuzkaya et al., 2009). 

When artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used in the development or assessment of alternatives, the 
resulting systems are referred to as intelligent decision support systems. These techniques attempt to understand and 
explain the skill of human beings in reasoning without precise knowledge (Doumpos and Grigoroudis, 2013). 
Qualitative reasoning (QR) techniques and fuzzy systems, which are considered subfields of research in AI, offer 
systematic tools for criteria assessment. Frequently, this uncertainty is captured by using linguistic terms or fuzzy 
numbers to evaluate the set of criteria or indicators. In different studies, fuzzy MCDM approaches have been 
developed to help energy planners and policy makers. In fact, fuzzy and qualitative reasoning techniques are capable 
of representing uncertainty, emulating skilled humans, and handling vague situations (Dubois and Prade, 1980; 
Tuzkaya et al., 2009). Application of the fuzzy set theory, established by Zadeh (1965), plays an important role in 
overcoming uncertainties. Qualitative absolute order-of-magnitude models were introduced into the qualitative 
reasoning field with the aim of using a linguistic approach to work with different levels of precision (Travé-
Massuyès et al. 2005).  

This paper contributes to the MCDM literature, and especially to the models able to support uncertainty in 
decision making, by developing a new methodology to support decision making in complex areas like energy 
problems. The method offers decision makers the possibility to work with qualitative scales in their assessments. 
Moreover, different levels of precision for different experts based on their certain or uncertain knowledge helps to 
keep all the information of their assessments instead of allowing some information to be ignored. For example, if 
decision makers do not have enough knowledge about one criterion, they can indicate a range between "Very poor- 
Medium" instead of an exact assessment. Even if decision makers don’t have any idea of the value for a specific 
attribute, they can use the label “I don’t know”, modeled by "Very poor-Very good". In this direction, the main 
contribution of this paper is a qualitative modified TOPSIS method, which is introduced and applied for selecting  
sustainable energy alternatives in a case-example. This new method handles uncertainty and imprecision by means 
of such linguistic labels. Its main advantage is that, on the one hand, experts can make mistakes if they are forced to 
make more precise judgments than the available information allows. On the other hand, a substantial loss of

information may happen if the experts are forced to make less precise judgments. By allowing flexibility as to 
precision, this method is able to capture the inherent ambiguity existing in human reasoning. 

The proposed method is based on qualitative reasoning techniques for ranking  multi-criteria alternatives in 
group decision making with linguistic labels with different levels of precision. It is inspired by a previous ranking 
method introduced by Agell et al. (2012). The presented method is compared with another MCDM approach based 
on a modiffed fuzzy TOPSIS method developed by Chen (2000). This comparison is performed using an example 
based on data provided by Kaya and Kahraman (2011).

Energy is a crucial factor for the economic development of nations. As economies and human society advances, 
more energy is required. The increasing scarcity of fossil fuel energy and its pollution of the environment have given 
rise to serious contradictions among the competing priorities of energy provision, environmental protection, and 
economic development. Since the importance of renewable energies has increased, a crucial decision for 
governments and businesses is deciding the best choice of energy source policies for investment (Polatidis et al., 
2006). 

The assessment and selection of the most suitable types of energy in a geographical area is a complex problem 
involving technical, economic, environmental, political and social criteria. In addition, energy planning problems 
usually involve multiple decision makers. These problems require the use of MCDM to evaluate environmental 
sustainability. Because of their differences, each country must prepare its own energy policies based on geographical 
and environmental factors to address sustainability issues. It is necessary to change the energy structure, integrating 
new sources and modifying the way we use fossil fuel, because of its damage to the environment. For this reason, 
several planning strategies have been utilized in different countries.  

Many studies have applied MCDM methods as a useful tool in energy planning (Tzeng et al., 1992; 
Georgopoulou et al., 1998; Pohekar and Ramachandran, 2004; Loken, 2007; Tsoutsos et al., 2009; Kahraman et al., 
2010; Moghaddam et al., 2011; Yeh and Huang, 2014). For instance, in a study by Tsoutsos et al.(2009), a set of 
energy alternatives were determined for different sources of energy on the island of Crete in Greece. The study 
constitutes an exploratory analysis for regional energy planning in creating classifications of sustainable energy 
alternatives. Pohekar and Ramachandran (2004) reviewed different published papers on MCDM and considered 
their applications in the renewable energy area. Another review of the various types of renewable energy models 
such as solar, wind, biomass and bio-energy is conducted by Jebaraj and Iniyan (2006). Wang et al. (2009) 
conducted a literature review on MCDM methods used for the selection of energy and their applications to energy 
issues. The review identifies four main criteria categories for the evaluation of energy sources and site selection 
problems: technical, economic, environmental and social.   

Table 1 shows the most important MCDM methods used for assessing energy policy and management: AHP; 
PROMETHEE; ELECTRE; and TOPSIS (Pohekar and Ramachandran, 2004). For example, Beccali et al.(1998) 
introduced a methodological tool able to organize the large set of variables of several specific assessments that help 
the decision maker in a complex problem. The authors used the ELECTRE methods to decide upon involving the 
use or non-use of fuzzy set concepts on the Italian island of Sardinia for renewable energy diffusion strategy 
planning. The case study explored the advantages and drawbacks of each ELECTRE methodology. In 2003, Beccali 
et al. used ELECTRE III to select the most suitable innovative technologies in the energy sector. Three decision 
scenarios were posited, each representing a coherent set of actions, and different fuzzification strategies were 
analyzed. In the study of Boran et al. (2012), intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS was introduced to evaluate renewable 
energy technologies for electricity generation in Turkey.

The use of criteria and indicators is a common way to describe and monitor complex systems and provide 

information for decision makers. Four main criteria from a sustainability point of view are accepted by experts in the 
literature review on the application of the MCDM techniques in energy planning: technological; environmental; 
economic; and social (Begic and Afgan, 2007; Doukas et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008, 2009). Table 2 shows the 
most important ‘criteria’ and ‘indicators’ used in recent MCDM studies conducted on energy issues. Each indicator 
is assigned to a specific criterion, and the corresponding study citations are included.

In this study, from among the indicators in Table 2 the most frequently used indicators in the literature have been 

considered: efficiency; exergy (rational efficiency); investment cost; operation and maintenance cost; NOX emission; 
CO2 emission; land use; social acceptability; and job creation. 

To evaluate different sources of energy with respect to these indicators, TOPSIS is one of the best known 
reference level models in the energy area. TOPSIS was developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) and is based on an 
aggregating function of the evaluation scores of experts; it determines the best alternative by calculating the 
distances from the positive and negative ideal solutions. The basic idea is that the preferred alternative should have 
the shortest distance from the ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution (Opricovic and 
Tzeng, 2004; Hwang and Yoon, 2005). Behzadian et al.(2012) studied various literature reviews in sustainable 
energy policy, energy planning, and suitable indicators for assessing energy using the TOPSIS methodology. 

 Using linguistic variables  and TOPSIS approach, which takes values from a set of linguistic terms, was reported 
in some studies. for the evaluation of energy policy options (Doukas et al., 2010; Kahraman et al., 2010). Doukas et 
al.(2010) presented an extension of a numerical multi-criteria TOPSIS method for processing linguistic information 
in the form of 2-tuple fuzzy numbers. He shows how energy  policy objectives for sustainable development and 
renewable energy sources options are assessed using linguistic variables. Kaya and Kahraman (2011) applied the 
modified fuzzy TOPSIS, which takes an evaluated fuzzy decision matrix as input to the selection of the best energy 
alternative.  

Linguistic variables enable experts to express their preferences as a major issue to be faced for making a 
decision. Most of the selection parameters cannot be given precisely, and decision makers usually express the 
evaluation data of the suitability of the alternatives for various subjective criteria, and the weights of the criteria, in 
linguistic terms (Belton and Stewart, 2002; Wang et al., 2009). There are many different representation formats that 
can be used in each model, such as preference orderings, utility values, multiplicative preference relations, fuzzy 
preference relations and so on. Every representation format has its own advantages and disadvantages, such as 
precision or ease of use and understanding. The use of fuzzy sets theory has achieved very good results for modeling 
qualitative information. Such modeling can be treated as a mechanism that mimics the human inference process with 
fuzzy information. It is a tool with the ability to compute with words the qualitative human thought process in the 
analysis of complex systems and decisions. Therefore, fuzzy logic is appropriate for unstructured decision making 
(Zadeh, 1975). 



6 Qualitative TOPSIS for selecting energy alternatives  

QR is another sub-area of artificial intelligence that attempts to understand and explain the ability to reason 
without having exact information. The main objective of QR is to develop systems that enable operation in 
conditions of insufficient or no numerical data (Forbus 1984; Travé-Massuyès et al. 2005). QR also addresses 
problems in such a way that the principle of relevance is preserved, that is, each variable is valued with the level of 
precision required. In group decision evaluation processes, it is not unusual for a situation to arise in which different 
levels of precision have to be used simultaneously depending on the information available to each expert. QR 
tackles the problem of integrating the representation of existing uncertainty within the group (Agell et al., 2012).  

Linguistic approaches have been widely used in MCDM methods in several fields such as power generation for 
tri-generation systems (Nieto-Morote et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2008), life cycle impact 
assessment (Kara and Onut 2010; Cherubini and Strømman 2011), and urban planning (Chang et al., 2008; Kowkabi 
et al., 2013; Mosadeghi et al., 2015), among others. In energy planning, different aspects of environmental 
assessments have been considered in various studies, and examples include: developing local energy sources to rank 
energy alternatives (Goumas and Lygerou, 2000), evaluating water resources (Dai et al., 2010), assessing renewable 
energy alternatives (Doukas et al., 2007; Kahraman et al., 2010; San Cristobal,  2011) and finding optimal locations 
for energy projects (Aras et al., 2004; San Cristóbal 2012; Yeh and Huang 2014). Doukas et al.(2007) present a 
MCDM approach with linguistic variables to assist policy makers in formulating sustainabe technologies in a Greek 
energy system. Furthermore, different applications of fuzzy MCDM methods in energy planning can be found in 
Kahraman (2008). 

Materials	and	methods		
A mathematical formulation is developed that contributes to decision analysis in the context of multi-criteria and 

group decision making for ranking problems. The method used in the study of Agell et al. for ranking alternatives, 
based on comparing distances against a single optimal reference point, has been modiffed in the method proposed in 
this paper to capture the idea of the TOPSIS approach according to the best and worst reference points. To do so, the 
proposed method of  TOPSIS, namely "Qualitative TOPSIS" (Q-TOPSIS) is defined after some preliminaries are 
introduced. 

Preliminaries	

Absolute	qualitative	order‐of‐magnitude	models		

The absolute order-of-magnitude (AOM) models are constructed via a partition of an interval in  which defines 
the set of basic labels. The partition is defined by a set of real landmarks. A general algebraic structure called 
qualitative algebra is defined; it provides a mathematical structure that combines sign algebra and interval algebra. 
This structure has been extensively studied by Travé-Massuyès et al. (2005). 

Definition 1 Let ,  be a real interval and , … , 	 a set of real landmarks, with	 ⋯ 	 . The 
basic labels are defined by 	 , , 1, … , . 
 
 Each basic label Bi corresponds to a linguistic term. In a generic sense, if r < s, then Br < Bs, meaning that 
Bs is strictly prefered to Br, such as "extremely bad" < "very bad". 

Definition 2 The non-basic labels describing different levels of precision are defined as ,  , 	 where 
, 1, … , , and  . The label  , 	corresponds to the concept ‘between Bi  and Bj’. 

 
In 2012, Agell et al. introduced a qualitative approach for ranking alternatives described qualitatively that was 
inspired by the reference point method. This approach ranks a set of alternatives A ,… , A   by using a distance 
function. This technique uses qualitative linguistic assessments of alternatives and minimizes the distance between 
them and a certain target point that models the best performance for each criterion considered. The approach 
considers that each alternative is defined by a set of r criteria, and each criterion is evaluated by the judgments of a 



7 Qualitative TOPSIS for selecting energy alternatives  

team of m experts. These evaluations are given by means of a set of qualitative labels with different levels of 
precision belonging to a certain order-of-magnitude space , 	|		 , 1, … , 1, , considering 

, 	 . 
In this way, each alternative 		 	, 1, … , , is represented by a k-dimensional vector of labels in ,		 ↔
,… , , … , , … , ,	 k being the product of the number of criteria and the number of experts:  k = r·m. 

Distances between linguistic k-dimensional vectors of basic and non-basic labels are computed by using the location 
function in n, which enables one to move from an ordinal scale to a cardinal scale and is defined as follows. 

Definition 3 The location function definition in  is the function :	 → 	  such that: 
 

, ∑ , ∑        (1) 
 
where  is any measure defined over the set of basic labels, for instance,   , ) = . 

 In other words, the location function of a qualitative label [Bi,Bj] is defined as a pair of real numbers whose 
components are, respectively, the opposite of the addition of the measures of the basic labels to its left and the 
addition of the measures of the basic labels to its right. 

By applying a function l to each component of the k-dimensional vector of labels, each alternative  is codified 
via a 2k-dimensional vector of real numbers: , … , 	 , … , , … , . 

AHP	Method	to	compute	weights	

Special attention has been paid to the definition of the criteria weights for aggregation functions in the MCDM 
literature. Weights given to different criteria are particularly important to obtain the overall preferential value of the 
alternatives (Choo et al., 1999). Based on aggregation procedures of MCDM models, the criteria weights can be 
used in different ways. Weights can be defined as trade-off or importance coefficients. In MCDM methods based on 
distance functions, weights are obtained by trade-off among criteria such as pair-wise comparison. In particular, in 
this study, the well-known Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to obtain weights of criteria to evaluate 
energy alternatives. 

AHP was developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the late 80s (Saaty, 1980; 1990). It evaluates the importance of each 
criterion in relation to the others in a hierarchical manner. The AHP method is based on structure of the model, 
comparative judgment of criteria and synthesis of the priorities (Karimi et al., 2011). In the first step, a complex 
problem is broken into a hierarchy with goal as an objective, criteria and sub-criteria at levels and sub-levels like a 
family tree. The second step begins with prioritiziation procedure in order to determine the relative importance of 
the criteria within each level. The evaluation of the hierarchy is based on pairwise comparison to assess the DM 
preferences from the second level to lowest one (Amiri 2010). At the last step, the relative weights for each matrix 
have been found and normalized. The AHP is considered a single synthesizing criterion approach (Ishizaka and 
Nemery 2013). 

This process can be performed with both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In addition, to deal with the 
uncertainty involved in some complex problems, a fuzzy approach of AHP method, where linguistic variables are 
used to represent the  experts` opinion, was developed (Laarhoven and Pedrycz, 1983). The fuzzy AHP considers 
the fuzziness and vagueness of  the decision makers (Kuo et al., 2015; Russo and Camanho, 2015). In general, 
experts use linguistic terms, which are translated into fuzzy evaluation scores and weights are finally expressed via 
triangle fuzzy numbers. 

The	proposed	Q‐TOPSIS	method	

The TOPSIS method proposed in this paper, called "Q-TOPSIS", can process information represented by qualitative 
terms in the absolute order-of-magnitude model that was introduced in Subsection Absolute qualitative order-of-
magnitude models.  

Let us consider a set of alternatives A ,… , A , each one defined by a set of r criteria, with each criterion 
assessed by a team of m experts. These assessments are given by means of a set of qualitative labels with different 
levels of precision belonging to a certain order-of-magnitude space n. Therefore, each alternative 	 	, 1, … ,  is 



8 Qualitative TOPSIS for selecting energy alternatives  

represented by a k-dimensional vector of labels, k being the product of the number of criteria and the number of 
experts, thus k = r·m: 

		 ↔ ,… , , … , , … , , ∈ , 1,… , , 1,… , , 1,… , 	 

We consider the qualitative positive reference label (QPRL) as the k-dimensional vector ∗ , … , ,	and 
the qualitative negative reference label (QNRL) as the k-dimensional vector , … , , which are considered 
as reference labels to compute distances. Their location function values are in: 

∗ 	 ∑ , 0, … , ∑ , 0        (2) 

		 0	, ∑ , … , 0	, ∑        (3) 
     

Both the Euclidean weighted distances of each alternative location , 1, … , , to A∗ and A  locations are 
then calculated, thus , ∗  and , , by applying Eq. 4 to the vectors 
, 	 , ∗   and , 	 ,  respectively: 

 

d X, Y ∑ w ∑ 	X –Y 	       (4) 

 
where wi is the weight corresponding to the i-th indicator, and , , 1,… ,2 , 1,… , , are respectively the 
components of  and . Finally, the qualitative closeness coefficient of each alternative is obtained by Eq. 5, and the 
alternatives are ranked according to the decreasing order of  values. 
 

QCC ∗ ,						i 1,2… , l.        (5) 

 

where ∗ and 	are respectively the distance between the alternative location  and the QPRL location ∗  
and the QNRL location		 . The ranking of alternatives can be determined according to the pre-order defined by 
the values of , and the closer to ∗ and further from 	  the alternative , the greater the value of . In 
such a case, common in TOPSIS methodology, the alternative  with the maximum  is chosen as the best 
option. 

Results	and	discussion		

A	case‐example	application	of	Q‐TOPSIS	for	selecting	sustainable	energy	

alternatives	

To demonstrate the potential of this methodology, an application for selecting sustainable energy alternatives is 
presented. A case-example, based on data provided in a paper by Kaya and Kahraman (2011), is used to illustrate 
the introduced approach. This case-example enables us to show the main advantages of the Q-TOPSIS method with 
respect to the existing methods, i.e., classic TOPSIS and fuzzy TOPSIS. Specifically, the ability of the proposed 
method to capture the uncertainty inherent in human reasoning, and by allowing experts to use ‘different levels of 
precision’ in their assessments. Although this is not specific for energy issues, and it may applicable in general for 
selecting the best from a set of alternatives, its suitability for selecting sustainable energy alternatives is clearly 
shown. Using linguistic labels with different levels of precision for expert assessment is crucial when some experts 
do not have enough knowledge about some aspect. 

 



9 Qualitative TOPSIS for selecting energy alternatives  

Alternatives, criteria, and indicators for sustainability assessment 

Seven alternatives were examined in the current paper: conventional , nuclear , solar , wind , 
hydraulic , biomass  and combined heat and power (CHP) . Nine indicators, with reference to the most 
frequently used technical, economic, environmental, and social criteria in evaluating energy options, were selected 
to assess the given alternatives. Note that in this study in order to compare results with Kaya & Kahraman (2011), 
the same indictaors have been selected and other important indicators, such as environmental and health risk, and 
enviromental emissions such as CO, SO2 and SPM, were not considered. For this reason, the Q-TOPSIS method is 
performed on the basis of these nine indicators, as weighted by a group of three experts.  

The considered indicators according to each criterion are: efficiency (I1) and exergy (rational efficiency) 
(I2) as technological indicators; investment cost (I3) and operation and maintenance cost (I4) as economic indicators; 
NOX emission (I5), CO2 emission (I6), and land use (I7) as environmental indicators; and social acceptability (I8) and 
job creation (I9) as social indicators. 
 The considered indicators’ weights are: 0.09; 0.1; 0.1; 0.11; 0.13; 
0.15; 0.11; 0.09; and 0.12	using fuzzy AHP method. It is assumed that all the criteria are benefit 
criteria. For instance, if energy source is evaluated as “very good” in terms of “CO2 emission”, this means that the 
CO2 emission level for energy option is “very low”. 

Results	

Once the criteria evaluation is determined and the indicators, weights, and alternatives are specified, the Q-TOPSIS 
algorithm steps are executed. The Q-TOPSIS approach considered in this example uses seven basic qualitative 
labels. Table 3 shows these qualitative labels together with their locations, considering the measure  over the set of 
basic labels μ 1, for all 1,… ,7.

Each expert assesses each alternative by means of nine qualitative labels (one for each indicator). Therefore, 
each alternative A is represented by a 27-dimensional vector of qualitative labels.

Comparing	Q‐TOPSIS	with	modified	fuzzy	TOPSIS	

Q-TOPSIS is compared with the modified fuzzy TOPSIS methodology in two different aspects. In the first 
subsection, we compare theoretically the two methodologies; and in the second subsection we compare the results 
obtained in Subsection A case-example application of Q-TOPSIS for selecting sustainable energy alternatives with 
the results obtained in Kaya and Kahraman (2011) using the modified fuzzy TOPSIS developed by Chen (2000). 
The main reasons for comparing the proposed method with modified fuzzy TOPSIS are that both methods are 
TOPSIS methods, and both capture uncertainty through linguistic labels. Therefore, as modified fuzzy TOPSIS 
method in some theoretical points is close to Q-TOPSIS, it has been selected for this comparison in order to show 
the new contribution of our method. 

Methods	comparison	



12 Qualitative TOPSIS for selecting energy alternatives  

The modified fuzzy TOPSIS developed by Chen (2000) that takes an evaluated fuzzy decision matrix as input is a 
popular tool to analyze the ideal alternative. This MCDM technique determines the best alternative by calculating 
the distances from the fuzzy positive and fuzzy negative ideal solutions according to an aggregation of the expert 
fuzzy evaluation scores. In modified fuzzy TOPSIS, linguistic preferences are converted to fuzzy triangle numbers 
( , , ). Table 6 shows the main differences between Q-TOPSIS and the modified fuzzy TOPSIS methodology. 
The differences noted in Table 6 represent four significant improvements over modified Fuzzy TOPSIS. 

Table 6: Differences between the two methods 
 

Differences Q-TOPSIS Fuzzy TOPSIS 

Scale Qualitative labels Fuzzy triangle numbers 

Granularity Multi-granularity Fixed granularity 

Aggregation step Without prior aggregation Weighted mean 

Normalization Without prior normalization Normalization 

 
 
Generally speaking, both methods use linguistic variables, but in different ways: Q-TOPSIS in the form of 

qualitative labels with different levels of precision and fuzzy TOPSIS by means of linguistic labels corresponding to 
triangle fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, the final aggregation process of both methods finds the distance between each 
alternative and the best and worst solutions. However, there are some differences between these two methods. 
Firstly, the Q-TOPSIS method does not require any previous discretization or definition of landmarks for defining 
initial qualitative terms because the calculations are performed directly with the labels through the location 
functions. In contrast, in the modified fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy labels are defined by means of cut-points that have to be 
set before any aggregate triangle fuzzy numbers. Secondly, the Q-TOPSIS method can address different levels of 
precision, from the most precise and basic labels to the least precise label [B1, Bn], which can be used to represent 
unknown values. In this way, experts are not forced to make more precise judgments than they are capable of; as 
mentioned earlier, sometimes decision makers can make mistakes if they are required to make more precise 
judgments than the available information allows. Finally, the Q-TOPSIS methodology computations do not need to 
use an aggregation of expert assessments or a prior normalization. The former involves a loss of information, and 
the latter concentrates expert assessments into a given range, which causes reduced differences. However, as can be 
seen in the next subsection, the results obtained by applying both methodologies are similar. 

Results	comparison	and	sensitivity	analysis	

Modified fuzzy TOPSIS has been applied to the data summarized in Subsection A case-example application of Q-
TOPSIS for selecting sustainable energy alternatives. Three experts evaluated the seven energy alternatives 
(conventional, nuclear, solar, wind, hydraulic, biomass and combined heat and power (CHP)) with respect to each 
one of the nine technical, economic, environmental, and social indicators using linguistic terms defined by the 
triangle fuzzy numbers given in Table 7.

For the particular scenario ( 0.09; 0.1; 0.1; 0.11; 0.13; 0.15; 0.11; 
0.09; and 0.12), the modified fuzzy TOPSIS provided the following alternatives ranking: wind > 

biomass > solar > CHP > hydraulic > nuclear > conventional energy. Both algorithms were implemented using the 
same data, and wind energy was found to be the best alternative among other energy technologies on both studies 
for this particular scenario. Although both MCDM linguistic approaches process uncertainty in different ways, their 
results produce the similar rankings. 

In addition, a sensitivity analysis that considered the four other scenarios, changing the weights considered for 
each criterion (Table 8), was carried out to analyze the results when applying both approaches. It is a crucial issue in 
any multi-criteria method to determine if the final ranking is dependent and sensitive to the estimates of the criteria 
weights.

15 Qualitative TOPSIS for selecting energy alternatives  

Allowing	experts	to	use	different	levels	of	precision	

To highlight the ability of the method presented to capture the inherent uncertainty existing in human reasoning, we 
present a simulated extension of the previous Scenario 1 where experts are allowed to use different levels of 
precision in their assessments. In general, costs, social acceptability and job creation are usually the criteria 
involving more uncertainty, meaning that their results and predictions can present greater differences. For this 
reason, we consider that Expert 1 expresses uncertain judgments when assessing criteria (C3, C4, C8 and C9) in 
Scenario 1. Table 10 presents the previous values considered for Expert 1 assessments with respect to these four 
criteria, whose locations were presented in Table 4, along with the new assessments allowing different levels of 
precision.

Considering these new assessments of Expert 1, the final order of ranking is the same as the previous one: wind > 
biomass > solar > CHP > nuclear > hydraulic > conventional energy (see Table 9). Note that the modified fuzzy-
TOPSIS method is not able to deal with these types of assessments; therefore these results can only be computed 
using the method proposed in this paper.  

This example clearly shows the originality and the contribution of the proposed method because, although it 
allows experts to express their uncertainty through imprecise assessments, it yields the same final ranking; thus, the 
same results can be obtained with less information. In addition, this reinforces the idea that the proposed method is 
more adaptable to real situations and requires less cognitive effort on the part of the experts. However, obviously, if 
the assessments are more imprecise, the obtained ranking can be different, as can be seen in the situation presented 
in Table 11.

The ranking based on these new assessments is wind > solar > biomass > CHP > hydraulic > nuclear > conventional 
energy. In the new order the respective places of solar/biomass and hydra./nuclear are switched.  

Conclusion	
When considering environmental, technical, economic and social aspects, it is crucial to analyze and quantify 

different types of variables involving imprecision. These factors, especially social ones, are not always precise, as 
imprecisions and uncertainties are features of the real world. Therefore, in order to provide useful data from experts’ 
assessments, a new MCDM method to support decision makers in all stages of the decision-making process with 
uncertain values is presented. This imprecision is captured by using linguistic variables involving qualitative labels 
with different levels of precision. This approach, based on order-of-magnitude QR, provides a model that can obtain 
results from non-numeric variables.  

The main contribution of this paper is the qualitative TOPSIS method, which is introduced and applied in an 
energy case study. Sustainable energy planning problems require critical decisions in a variety of dynamic 
complexities with respect to conflicting environmental, economic, social and technical criteria. This method takes 
into account intensity of preferences and gives experts the capability to assess alternatives under uncertainty by 
expressing their judgments using linguistic variables involving qualitative labels. As an advantage of this method, 
the use of qualitative labels with different levels of precision is essential to obtaining user-friendly systems to be 
used by energy planners for evaluation processes. This method is able to capture the existing ambiguity inherent in 
human reasoning and addresses the problem in such a way that the principle of relevance is preserved: Each variable 
is valued with the level of precision required.  
 In this paper, the proposed Q-TOPSIS method is compared with the modified fuzzy TOPSIS method, 
which uses another type of linguistic variables. The modified fuzzy TOPSIS approach utilizes fuzzy linguistic 
variables for evaluating alternatives. For further research, the proposed Q-TOPSIS method will be applied to real 
data to determine the most appropriate sustainable energy alternative in a specific geographical area. Moreover, 
regarding the application for selecting sustainable energy alternatives, the theoretical framework can be deeply 
extended to include more indicators such as waste management, other environmental pollutions (SO2, GHG, CO 
emissions and SPM), public health and environmental risk and the impact of possible accidents, which are crucial in 
energy studies. Other parameters such as internal rate of return and payback period are important economic 
parameters for investment on any energy sources that will be considered in future applications.
