Short title: Supraspinal regulation of dorsal horn neuronal synchronization  11 

Key Points  12 

The state of central sensitization induced by the intradermic injection of capsaicin 13 

leads to structured (non-random) changes in functional connectivity between dorsal 14 

horn neuronal populations distributed along the spinal lumbar segments in 15 

anesthetized cats.  16 

 The capsaicin-induced changes in neuronal connectivity and the concurrent 17 

increase in secondary hyperalgesia are transiently reverted by the systemic 18 

administration of small doses of lidocaine, a clinically effective procedure to 19 

treat neuropathic pain.  20 

 The effects of both capsaicin and lidocaine are greatly attenuated in 21 

spinalized preparations, showing that supraspinal influences play a 22 

significant role in the shaping of nociceptive-induced changes in dorsal horn 23 

functional neuronal connectivity. 24 

 We conclude that changes on functional connectivity between segmental 25 

populations of dorsal horn neurones induced by capsaicin and lidocaine 26 

result from a cooperative adaptive interaction between supraspinal and 27 

spinal neuronal networks, a process that may have a relevant role in the 28 

pathogenesis of chronic pain and analgesia.  29

Abstract  32 

Despite the profuse information on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved 33 

in the central sensitization produced by intense nociceptive stimulation, the 34 

changes in the patterns of functional connectivity between spinal neurones 35 

associated with the development of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia remain 36 

largely unknown. Here we show that the state of central sensitization produced by 37 

the intradermal injection of capsaicin is associated with structured transformations 38 

in neuronal synchronization that lead to an enduring reorganization of the 39 

functional connectivity within a segmentally distributed ensemble of dorsal horn 40 

neurones. These changes are transiently reverted by the systemic administration 41 

of small doses of lidocaine, a clinically effective procedure to treat neuropathic 42 

pain. Lidocaine also reduces the capsaicin-induced facilitation of the spinal 43 

responses evoked by weak mechanical stimulation of the skin in the region of 44 

secondary but not in the region of primary hyperalgesia. The effects of both 45 

intradermic capsaicin and systemic lidocaine on the segmental correlation and 46 

coherence between ongoing cord dorsum potentials and on the responses evoked 47 

by tactile stimulation in the region of secondary hyperalgesia are greatly attenuated 48 

in spinalized preparations, showing that supraspinal influences are involved in the 49 

reorganization of the nociceptive-induced structured patterns of dorsal horn 50 

neuronal connectivity. We conclude that the structured reorganization of the 51 

functional connectivity between the dorsal horn neurones induced by capsaicin 52 

nociceptive stimulation results from cooperative interactions between supraspinal 53 

and spinal networks, a process that may have a relevant role in the shaping of the 54 

spinal state in the pathogenesis of chronic pain and analgesia.  55

Introduction  63 

Acute nerve damage or neuropathic and/or neurogenic inflammatory 64 

processes usually result in long lasting plastic changes in the nervous system such 65 

as central sensitization and reorganization of nociceptive pathways (Woolf 1983; 66 

Cook et al., 1987; Kaas, 1991; Wall et al., 2002). The process of spinal 67 

sensitization is an important component of the pain experience. It includes an 68 

enhancement of the functional status of neurones and circuits in nociceptive 69 

pathways that result in a state of facilitation, potentiation or amplification, leading to 70 

the perception of ongoing pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia (Woolf 2007; 71 

Latremoliere & Woolf, 2009; Basbaum et al., 2009).  72 

Studies in animal models have indicated that the inflammatory nociception 73 

induced by intradermic application of capsaicin leads to a prolonged state of 74 

central sensitization involving a fast reorganization of the cutaneous receptive 75 

fields of neurones in the cuneate nucleus (Pettit & Schwark, 1996). In anesthetized 76 

rats, capsaicin injected in the perioral region was also found to increase the 77 

ongoing firing of thalamo-cortical neurones and rapidly reorganize the whisker 78 

neuronal representations in both the thalamus and cortex (Katz et al., 1999). Other 79 

studies have revealed that these changes are also associated with alterations in 80 

the functional connectivity between dorsal horn neurones in the spinal cord. Thus, 81 

according to Eblen-Zajjur & Sandkühler (1996), most pairs of laminae III-V 82 

neurones with overlapping receptive fields showed increased correlated discharges 83 

during nociceptive stimulation and it has been suggested that these changes 84 

represent a stimulus-induced plasticity involving alterations in the strength and/or 85 

time of neuronal synchronization and rarely activation of new connections (see also 86 

Schaible et al., 1987; Biella et al., 1997; Galhardo et al., 2000;).  87 

At peripheral level, the activation of C fibres by painful stimuli leads not only 88 

to the sensitization but also to long term potentiation at their central synapses 89 

referred to as secondary hyperalgesia that is reversed by brief application of a high 90 

opioid dose (Sandkuhler 2007, 2009; Sotgiu et al., 2009). Since this procedure also 91 



4 
 

reverses hyperalgesia in behaving animals, it has been suggested that opioids not 92 

only temporarily dampen pain, but may also erase a spinal memory trace of pain 93 

(Drdla-Schutting et al., 2012). Mechanical hyperalgesia may be associated with a 94 

phenomenon similar to memory reconsolidation, a process by which memories are 95 

rendered labile after reactivation and became susceptible to erasure (Bonin & De 96 

Koninck, 2014).  97 

Despite the increasing information on the cellular and molecular mechanisms 98 

involved in the long lasting effects of acute nociceptive stimulation, there is limited 99 

information pertaining the concurrent modifications of the patterns of functional 100 

connectivity between dorsal horn neurones. Most studies have been addressed to 101 

the analysis of the changes in synchronization between pairs of neurones usually 102 

located within the same spinal segment (see Eblen-Zajjur & Sandkühler, 1996; 103 

Biella et al., 1997; Galhardo et al., 2002; Roza et al., 2016) and few have 104 

examined the reorganization of the functional connectivity between dorsal horn 105 

neuronal populations located in different spinal segments, particularly during 106 

nociceptive stimulation associated with the development of central sensitization 107 

and its modulation by supraspinal influences (see Chávez et al., 2012; Chen et al., 108 

2015; Martin et al., 2015).  109 

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the ongoing cord dorsum 110 

potentials (CDPs) recorded in the lumbosacral segments of the anesthetized cat 111 

are generated by the synchronous activity of a longitudinally distributed network of 112 

interconnected local and intersegmental sets of dorsal horn neurones (Manjarrez et 113 

al., 2000, 2003 and Chávez et al., 2012). A key finding was that depending on the 114 

level of neuronal synchronization, this ensemble could acquire specific 115 

configurations of neuronal connectivity, some leading to the preferential activation 116 

of the pathways mediating Ib non-reciprocal postsynaptic inhibition and others to 117 

the activation of the pathways mediating primary afferent depolarization and 118 

presynaptic inhibition (Contreras-Hernández et al., 2015). 119 

Based on these observations we assumed that the analysis of the changes 120 

produced by nociceptive stimulation on the correlation and coherence between the 121 



5 
 

ongoing CDPs and intraspinal field potentials (IFPs) would be an appropriate mean 122 

to reveal relevant features of the supraspinal modulation of the patterns of 123 

functional connectivity between populations of dorsal horn neurones in different 124 

spinal segments associated with the development of both secondary hyperalgesia 125 

and allodynia, and to provide some insight on the mechanisms of action of clinically 126 

effective analgesic procedures (Mao & Chen, 2000; Fields, 2004; Challapalli et al., 127 

2005; Endo et al., 2008; Sotgiu et al., 2009). 128 

The present study was undertaken to examine in the anesthetized cat a) the 129 

effects of nociceptive neurogenic inflammatory input induced by the acute 130 

intradermic injection of capsaicin on the segmental distribution of correlation and 131 

coherence between the populations of dorsal horn neurones involved in the 132 

generation of the ongoing CDPs and IFPs, b) the extent to which these effects 133 

were modified by procedures clinically effective in the treatment of neuropathic 134 

pain such as the systemic injection of small clinically effective doses of lidocaine 135 

(Dirks et al., 2000; Tremont-Lukats, et al., 2006; Gordon & Schroeder, 2008) and c) 136 

the contribution of supraspinal influences on the capsaicin and lidocaine-induced 137 

effects on the functional connectivity between dorsal horn neurones and the 138 

possible relation of these changes with the development of mechanical allodynia 139 

and secondary hyperalgesia (see Urban & Gebhart, 1999; Abaei et al., 2016).  140 

Some of these observations have been published in abstract form (Rudomin 141 

et al., 2012; Contreras-Hernández et al., 2013).  142 

 143 

Materials and Methods 144 

Ethical Approval  145 

Cats were bred and housed under veterinarian supervision at the Institutional 146 

Animal Care unit (SAGARPA permission AUT-B-C-0114-007). They were kept in 147 

individual comfortable cages and had access to food and water ad libitum. All 148 

experiments were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee for Animal 149 

Research (Protocol no. 126-03) and comply with the ethical policies and 150 

regulations of The Journal of Physiology, including the animal ethics checklist  (see 151 



6 
 

Grundy, 2015). The Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National 152 

Research Council, 2010) was followed in all cases.  153 

General procedures 154 

Preparation: The experiments were performed in 9 adult cats of either sex 155 

weighting between 2.5 and 3.5 Kg. The animals were initially anesthetized with 156 

pentobarbitone sodium (40 mg/kg i.p.). The carotid artery, radial vein, trachea and 157 

urinary bladder were cannulated. Additional doses of pentobarbitone sodium (5 158 

mg/kg/hr) were given intravenously to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia, 159 

tested by assessing that withdrawal reflexes were absent, that the pupils were 160 

constricted and that systolic arterial blood pressure was between 100 and 120 mm 161 

Hg. 162 

The lumbo-sacral and low thoracic spinal segments were exposed by 163 

laminectomy and opening of the dura mater. After the main surgical procedures, 164 

the animals were transferred to a stereotaxic metal frame allowing immobilization 165 

of the head and spinal cord and pools were made with the skin flaps that were filled 166 

with paraffin oil to prevent desiccation of the exposed tissues. The temperature 167 

was maintained between 36 and 37°C by means of radiant heat.  168 

Subsequently, the animals were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (0.1 169 

mg/kg) and artificially ventilated. The tidal volume was adjusted to maintain 4% of 170 

CO2 concentration in the expired air. During paralysis, adequacy of anaesthesia 171 

was ensured with supplementary doses of anesthetic (2 mg/kg in an hour) and by 172 

repeatedly assessing that the pupils remained constricted and that heart rate and 173 

blood pressure were not changed following a noxious stimulus (paw pinch). 174 

Recording and stimulation: CDPs were recorded by means of 8-12 silver ball 175 

electrodes placed on the surface of the L4-L7 segments on both sides of the spinal 176 

cord. To reduce cross-talk contributed by the indifferent electrode, differential 177 

recordings were made between the potentials recorded at each site against an 178 

equal number of electrodes, each inserted in the adjacent paravertebral muscles 179 

(see Malliani et al., 1965; Chávez et al., 2012; Obien et al., 2015).  180 



7 
 

In several experiments, in addition to the CDPs, we recorded the intraspinal 181 

field potentials (IFPs) with a pair of glass micropipettes filled with 2M NaCl (1-2 182 

MΩ) that were inserted in the left side of the L6 segment with a rostro-caudal 183 

separation of 1 mm and positioned at two different depths within the dorsal horn, 184 

one superficial (500-800 µm) and another deeper (1600-1800 µm). Their final 185 

position was verified histologically (see below). Ongoing and evoked CDPs and 186 

IFPs were recorded with separate preamplifiers (band pass filters 0.3 Hz to 1 KHz), 187 

visualized on-line and digitally stored for further analysis with software written in 188 

MatLab (MathWorks) and LabView version 14 (National Instruments). 189 

Spinalization: When effects of a spinal section were investigated, one of the 190 

exposed thoracic segments (usually T4-T6) was bathed with chilled ringer for about 191 

10 minutes, sprayed with liquid nitrogen until it was completely frozen and 192 

sectioned to ensure complete and permanent interruption of supraspinal 193 

influences.  194 

Mechanical stimulation of the skin: In several experiments we recorded the 195 

CDPs produced by mechanical stimulation of the skin by means of an air puff 196 

delivered by a Picospritzer (Intracel LTD) through two glass tubes (1 mm diameter) 197 

placed close to but without touching the skin on the left hindlimb. One of the tubes 198 

was placed near the site of capsaicin injection into the footpad and the other 35-40 199 

mm centrally in the region of secondary hyperalgesia. The air puffs generated by 200 

the Picospritzer with pulses lasting 5-10 ms produced a change in pressure 201 

equivalent to 1g exerted by a von Frey hair leading to a tactile non-painful 202 

sensation when tested on ourselves.  203 

Intradermic injection of capsaicin: As described by Rudomin & Hernández 204 

(2008), 30 µl of 1% solution of capsaicin diluted in 10% Tween 80 and 90% saline, 205 

(around 7.5 µg/kg) were injected in the plantar cushion of the left hindlimb. To 206 

avoid desensitization, capsaicin was injected only once (Sakurada et al., 1992). In 207 

our experience the effects of capsaicin started around 10-20 min and attained 208 

maximum values between 100 and 180 min after the injection and persisted up to 4 209 



8 
 

hours. The injection of capsaicin produced a clear inflammatory response around 210 

the injection site (see Rudomin and Hernández, 2008). 211 

Systemic injection of lidocaine: Lidocaine is a local anesthetic with short half-life 212 

(about 17 minutes) when systemically administered. In this series of experiments a 213 

solution of Lidocaine (5 mg/kg diluted in 6 cc of isotonic saline) was slowly injected 214 

(20-30 min) through a catheter inserted in the right femoral vein. An equivalent 215 

dose of systemic lidocaine has been used to treat neuropathic pain and to 216 

supplement general anesthesia (see Wallace et al., 1997; Gordon & Schroeder, 217 

2008;).  218 

Histology: At the end of the experiment the animal was euthanized with a 219 

pentobarbital overdose and perfused with 10% formalin. The spinal cord was 220 

removed for fixation and dehydration leaving the recording micropipettes in place. 221 

Subsequently, the spinal segments containing the micropipettes were placed in a 222 

solution of methyl salicylate for clearing and subsequently cut transversally to verify 223 

the position of the micropipettes. The tracks of the microelectrodes were drawn 224 

with a lucid camera (Wall & Werman, 1976). 225 

Data processing 226 

Coefficients of correlation: As in previous work (Chávez et al., 2012), the 227 

changes in correlation between the CDPs simultaneously recorded from different 228 

lumbo-sacral spinal segments were estimated by means of the Pearson correlation 229 

coefficient (), as follows  230 

𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋, 𝑌) =
∑ (𝑥𝑖 − �̅�)(𝑦𝑖 − �̅�)

𝑛
𝑖=1

√∑ (𝑥𝑖 − �̅�)
2𝑛

𝑖=1 ∑ (𝑦𝑖 − �̅�)
2𝑛

𝑖=1

 

where X={xi} and Y={yi} are two voltage-time series corresponding to the 231 

continuous records of paired sets of CDPs and/or IFPs (lasting 5-10 min).  232 

Power spectra and Coherence Function: To analyze the changes in the 233 

frequency components of the CDPs and of the IFPs we calculated the power 234 

spectra of the potentials recorded in individual spinal segments as well as the 235 



9 
 

frequency-dependence correlation (coherence function) between different paired 236 

sets of potentials.  237 

The coherence function () was calculated using the equations provided by the 238 

LabView v 14 tool kit as follows:  239 

γ2(f) =
(Magnitude of the Average SAB(f)) 

2 

(Average SAA(f))(Average SBB(f)) 
 

where SAB is the cross power spectrum, SAA is the power spectrum of A, and 240 

SBB is the power spectrum of B. This equation yields a coherence factor with a 241 

value between zero and one versus frequency.  242 

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA): This analysis was implemented in R 243 

software (R development, Core team, 2016) and used in some cases to compare 244 

changes in the slope (Ps) of the best linear fits of the correlation coefficients 245 

between paired sets of CDPs generated in the L4-L7 spinal segments. Ps values 246 

below 0.05 were considered as significant (see McDonald, 2014).  247 

Randomness test: The randomness of each of the correlograms obtained 248 

during the different experimental conditions (Control, Capsaicin, Lidocaine and 249 

Spinalization) was examined by using the standard runs-test for randomness 250 

(Gibbons, 1996). Briefly, for a given correlogram we calculated the difference 251 

between each of the correlation values relative to the median value of the 252 

correlogram in order to obtain a sequence of binary relations (bigger than, less 253 

than). Same values were discarded. This test assumes sequentially ordered 254 

values. The binary relationship sequence patterns were analyzed to explore if they 255 

occurred by chance in a random arrangement (null hypothesis) by considering the 256 

number of runs-distribution. P-values below 0.05 were considered as significant.  257 

We found that in the present set of experiments all correlograms showed a non-258 

random significance below 0.005. This implies that the segmental patterns of 259 

correlation between ongoing CDPs during the control state as well as during the 260 

different experimental conditions are the expression of non-random states of 261 



10 
 

functional connectivity between the neuronal ensembles involved in the generation 262 

of the CDPs.  263 

Similitude tests: Tests of similarity between the histograms of the coefficients of 264 

correlation obtained from the whole set of all the combinations of the paired sets of 265 

CDPs or IFPs obtained from 5-10 min recordings (correlograms) were made to 266 

compare the effects exerted by the different experimental procedures. To this end 267 

we calculated the root mean-square significance (RMSS) between pairs of 268 

correlograms. Briefly, given two correlograms X={xi} and Y={yi}, where xi and yiare 269 

the values on the i-th bin, corresponding to the correlation value between all the 270 

combinations of paired sets of CDPs. Significance between pairs of bins is defined 271 

as: 𝑆𝑖 =
�̂�𝑖−𝑘�̂�𝑖

√𝜎2̂𝑥𝑖+𝑘𝜎
2̂

𝑦𝑖

 , where  𝑘 = 𝑁1 𝑁2⁄ , �̂�𝑖, 𝜎
2̂

𝑥𝑖 and �̂�𝑖, 𝜎
2̂

𝑦𝑖 are the expected and 272 

variance values of the i-ith bin and N1, N2 are the volumes of the correlograms (i.e. 273 

the sum of all their elements).  274 

The RMSS values are calculated as follows:   𝑅𝑀𝑆𝑆 = √
∑ (𝑆𝑖−�̂�)

2𝑀
𝑖=1

𝑀
 275 

   where �̂� is the mean value of 𝑆𝑖. RMSS≈0 indicates the same correlograms, 276 

RMSS≈1 indicates that the correlograms are different, but they come from the 277 

same parent population and RMSS>>1 indicates that correlograms are completely 278 

different.  279 

The advantage of this test respect other tests is that allows the analysis of 280 

gradual changes in the shape of the correlograms produced by different 281 

procedures along the same experiment instead of forcing edge threshold levels to 282 

assess similitude. We consider this feature as an advantage because in our 283 

experience, changes induced by capsaicin or lidocaine develop gradually and 284 

rather slowly. See Bityukov et al., (2013) for further details. 285 

Results  286 

Systemic lidocaine transiently reverses the action of capsaicin on the 287 

correlation between ongoing CDPs and IFPs.  288 



11 
 

These observations were undertaken to examine the effects of the intradermic 289 

injection of capsaicin on the segmental correlation between the ongoing CDPs as 290 

well as of the correlation of the IFPs with the CDPs and their modification by the 291 

systemic administration of lidocaine and spinalization.  292 

Fig. 1A-F shows the effects of the injection of capsaicin into the left plantar paw, 293 

of the systemic administration of lidocaine and of spinalization on the ongoing 294 

potentials recorded in the left and right sides of the L5 and L6 segments with 4 out 295 

of the 12 ball electrodes placed on the cord dorsum, as well as on the intraspinal 296 

field potentials recorded in the superficial (S-IFPs) and deeper layers (D-IFPs)  with 297 

two micropipettes introduced in the left side of the L6 segment  (see insert in Fig. 298 

1A). 299 

It may be seen that by one hour after the injection of capsaicin, the CDPs as 300 

well as the IFPs showed in addition to the relative brief potentials some slow 301 

synchronized activity (Fig. 1B). The injection of lidocaine (5 mg/kg administered 302 

systemically over 30 min) transiently reduced the slow synchronized potentials 303 

leaving brief CDPs and IFPs that resembled those recorded before the injection of 304 

capsaicin (Fig. 1C). Thereafter, when most of the lidocaine effects were over, the 305 

slow synchronized activity was resumed (Fig. 1D), suggesting a long lasting central 306 

effect induced by capsaicin (see Rudomin & Hernández 2008).  307 

At this stage, a high spinalization (T4) removed the slow synchronized 308 

potentials and increased the frequency of the brief CDPs and IFPs (Fig. 1E). After 309 

spinalization, a second injection of lidocaine had minor effects on these potentials 310 

(Fig. 1F; see below).  311 

Fig. 1G displays the time course of the changes produced by capsaicin, 312 

lidocaine and spinalization on the segmental correlation between the different 313 

combinations of paired sets of CDPs recorded with the whole set of 12 electrodes 314 

(66 in this case). The coefficients of correlation between the paired sets of CDPs 315 

obtained from a 10 min control recording period (Control 0) were arranged in 316 

descending order, displayed vertically and colored according to their magnitude 317 

(see scale). The coefficients obtained from subsequent 10 min non-overlapping 318 



12 
 

recordings were displayed keeping the same order that of the Control 0 319 

coefficients. It may be seen that after the intradermic injection of capsaicin, the 320 

correlation between the paired sets of CDPs was briefly reduced and then began to 321 

increase and became rather high by 70-90 min. At this time the injected footpad 322 

was clearly inflamed (see Rudomin & Hernández, 2008).  323 

The systemic injection of lidocaine (Lidocaine 1 in Fig. 1G) transiently reduced 324 

the capsaicin-induced increase in correlation between the CDPs. This effect was 325 

already detectable during the first 10 min after lidocaine administration and 326 

became largest 20 to 30 min later. By 40-50 min after lidocaine, the correlation 327 

between the CDPs increased again and went above the pre-lidocaine levels. At 328 

that time, spinalization at T4 abruptly reduced the correlation between the ongoing 329 

CDPs that was further reduced, albeit slightly, by a second injection of lidocaine 330 

(Lidocaine 2).  331 

Similar changes have been observed on the correlation of the S-IFPs and D-332 

IFPs with the CDPs (Figure 1H-I). It thus seems that the changes in correlation 333 

between paired sets of CDPs reflect the changes in correlation between the spinal 334 

neuronal networks detected by the intraspinal recordings (see below).  335 

Segmental distribution of the changes in correlation  336 

Correlation between paired sets of CDPs: We have assumed previously that the 337 

magnitude of the coefficients of correlation displayed by the paired sets of CDPs 338 

recorded from different segments reflects the strength of the functional connectivity 339 

between the neuronal ensembles receiving inputs from different parts of the 340 

hindlimb (Chávez et al., 2012). 341 

To disclose the spatial (segmental) changes induced by capsaicin, lidocaine 342 

and spinalization on the correlation between the CDPs, the coefficients obtained 343 

from all the combinations of the paired sets of CDPs during a 10 min control 344 

recording period (Control 0) were plotted as horizontal bars, displayed in 345 

descending order (correlograms) and separated in 5 ranges according to their 346 

magnitude, each with a different color (see Fig. 2A). Thereafter, the segmental 347 



13 
 

location of the paired sets of CDPs in each range was indicated in a spinal cord 348 

diagram with the corresponding colored lines joining the recording sites (Fig. 2 A1-349 

A4).  350 

It may be seen in Fig. 2A1 that the highest control coefficients of correlation 351 

were displayed by paired sets of CDPs recorded from adjacent sites (black lines), 352 

while the coefficients in lower ranges (red to green lines) were displayed by paired 353 

sets of CDPs located in more distant segments in the same and in opposite sides 354 

of the spinal cord (Fig. 2 A2-A4). This distribution is consistent with the proposal of 355 

a longitudinally bilaterally distributed set of interconnected neuronal populations 356 

(Chávez et al., 2012; Contreras-Hernández et al., 2015). 357 

Quite interestingly, 70-80 min after the injection of capsaicin there was a 358 

significant increase in the correlation between the crossed CDPs generated in 359 

nearby segments (Fig. 2B1) and a concurrent reduction in the correlation between 360 

the more distant sets of CDPs (Fig. 2 B2 and B3). 10-20 min after the systemic 361 

injection of lidocaine, the effect of capsaicin on the correlation between the CDPs 362 

was reversed (Fig. 2  C1 -C4), and their segmental distribution resembled the 363 

control distribution as assessed by their relatively low RMSS (0.31).  364 

The effect of lidocaine was over by 80-90 min after the injection (Fig. 2 D1-D4) 365 

and the spatial distribution of the correlation between the CDPs again resembled 366 

that induced by capsaicin before the administration of this local anesthetic (RMSS= 367 

0.39). Spinalization also reduced the correlation, particularly that displayed by the 368 

crossed sets of CDPs (Fig. 2 E1-E4). The subsequent injection of lidocaine (20-30 369 

min) had a small effect on the magnitude (RMSS=0.29) and segmental distribution 370 

of the correlation (Fig. 2 F1-F4). 371 

Correlation between IFPs and CDPs: We expanded our observations on the 372 

correlated activity between the paired sets of CDPs to study the concurrent 373 

changes induced by capsaicin, lidocaine and spinalization on the correlation 374 

between the superficial and deep IFPs and the CDPs.  375 



14 
 

Under control conditions (Fig. 3A) the S-IFPs showed a weak correlation with 376 

the CDPs that was highest in segment L6cL. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3G, the 377 

D-IFPs not only showed a higher correlation with the CDPs generated in L6cL (site 378 

of electrode insertion) but were also correlated with the CDPs generated in 379 

neighboring segments, including those in the opposite (right) side. 380 

As described for the CDPs, 70-80 min after the injection of capsaicin the 381 

correlation between both IFPs and CDPs was also increased in both sides of the 382 

spinal cord. It was particularly stronger between the D-IFPs (recorded in laminae 383 

III-V) and the CDPs (Fig. 3B and H). A similar early (10 min) and late (80-90 min) 384 

effect of lidocaine occurred on the correlation patterns between the S-IFPs and the 385 

D-IFPs with the CDPs (Fig. 3C,D and Fig. 3I,J). They now resembled the control 386 

and capsaicin-induced patterns, respectively (see the RMSS values in figure).  387 

Spinalization reduced the correlation between the IFPs and CDPs, but was still 388 

larger between the D-IFPs and the CDPs recorded in the left side (Fig. 3E and K). 389 

The effects on the correlation obtained 20-30 min after a second injection of 390 

lidocaine were rather small (RMSS= 0.23 and 0.27; Fig. 3F, L). 391 

Altogether the above set of observations indicates that the effects of capsaicin 392 

and lidocaine on the correlation between the ongoing CDPs and between them and 393 

the IFPs are exerted not only on the temporal but also on the spatial (segmental) 394 

domain and that supraspinal influences contribute to the generation and 395 

modulation of the observed patterns of segmental connectivity between the 396 

populations of dorsal horn neurones in both sides of the spinal cord.  397 

Differential action of capsaicin on the neuronal ensembles generating the 398 

CDPs  399 

When plotting the control coefficients against the correlation coefficients obtained 400 

under different experimental procedures a different kind of information emerged 401 

that was not evident by just observing the changes in the correlograms.  402 



15 
 

Fig. 4A shows that the coefficients of correlation between the paired sets of 403 

CDPs obtained 0-10 min after the injection of capsaicin were still similar to the 404 

control 0 coefficients. However, by 40-50 min (Fig. 4B), these coefficients became 405 

separated in two distinct clusters and remained so for 20 min more (Fig. 4C), 406 

suggesting a relatively stable configuration of neuronal connectivity as assessed by 407 

the RMSS of 0.20 and the ANCOVA Ps values.  408 

The two cluster arrangement induced by capsaicin was temporarily reverted by 409 

the systemic administration of lidocaine giving rise to a single cluster that remained 410 

practically unchanged for half an hour (RMSS=0.15 and Ps>0.05; Fig. 4D and E). 411 

Again, as the effect of lidocaine faded, the coefficients of correlation became 412 

assembled in two separate clusters that remained stable during half an hour 413 

(RMSS=0.30 and Ps >0.05; Fig. 4F and G). After spinalization they merged into a 414 

single cluster (Fig. 4H). A second injection of lidocaine reduced, albeit slightly, the 415 

correlation between the CDPs that still remained grouped into a single cluster 416 

(RMSS= 0.29; Fig. 4I).  417 

Quite interestingly, we found that capsaicin also separated in two clusters the 418 

coefficients of correlation between the IFPs and the CDPs, that were reverted to a 419 

single cluster after lidocaine, as well as after spinalization performed once the 420 

action of lidocaine was over (Fig. 4J-R).  421 

The two cluster arrangement induced by capsaicin was a rather unexpected 422 

finding and led to the question on its possible functional meaning. It clearly 423 

suggests a differential action on the neuronal ensembles involved in the generation 424 

of the CDPs and IFPs. To this end it seemed important to determine, in the first 425 

place, if there were any differences in the segmental location of the paired sets of 426 

potentials included in each of the two clusters. In this regard the data depicted in 427 

Fig. 3A-D provide part of the required information. They show that the major 428 

increase in correlation was displayed by the S-IFPs and D-IFPs versus the CDPs 429 

recorded in the caudal region of the L6 and rostral region of the L7 segments in 430 

both sides (L6cL, L6cR, L7rL, L7rR). These coefficients of correlation would 431 

contribute to the C2 cluster, Fig. 4C. The coefficients of correlation of the S-IFPs 432 



16 
 

and D-IFPs with the CDPs generated in the other, more distant segments (L6rL, 433 

L6rR, L5cL L5rL) would contribute to the C1 cluster. It should be noted that the 434 

L6cL and L7rL segments receive most of the nociceptive inputs generated by the 435 

injection of capsaicin (see Rudomin and Hernández 2008). Additional features of 436 

the capsaicin-induced separation of the coefficients of correlation in two clusters 437 

and their reversal by lidocaine are examined in the Discussion. 438 

Consistency of effects of capsaicin and lidocaine in other preparations. 439 

The data depicted in Figs. 1-4 were obtained from the same experiment. It thus 440 

seemed necessary to examine the effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the 441 

segmental correlation between paired sets of CDPs in other preparations with 442 

intact neuroaxis. Fig. 5 summarizes the changes in correlation produced by 443 

capsaicin and lidocaine observed in other 3 experiments and Fig. 11 provides data 444 

from another experiment. As expected, the control correlograms were different in 445 

each experiment probably because of differences in the initial state of the 446 

preparation (e.g., anesthetic level). Yet, the overall effects of capsaicin and 447 

lidocaine were similar to those observed in the experiment of Figures 1-4. Namely, 448 

the intradermal injection of capsaicin produced a structured increase in the 449 

correlation between the paired sets of CDPs and this effect was transiently 450 

reversed following the systemic injection of lidocaine. The changes in the 451 

correlograms produced by the different procedures were validated with the 452 

similarity tests described above (see Figures).  453 

In the experiment of Fig. 5A, we asked the question on the extent to which 454 

lidocaine would be able to revert the effects of capsaicin injected several hours 455 

before, at a time when according to Bonin and De Koninck (2014) there would be 456 

already a memory consolidation of the effects produced by the nociceptive 457 

stimulus. We found that the capsaicin-induced increase in correlation persisted for 458 

at least 4 hours and that at that time the systemic injection of lidocaine reduced 459 

very effectively the correlation between the CDPs for about 30 min and was 460 

practically over by 90 min.  461 



17 
 

In the experiment of Fig. 5B, the control coefficients of correlation between the 462 

CDPs were relatively high, but even so, after capsaicin there was a significant 463 

increase in the correlation, mostly between the least correlated sets of paired 464 

CDPs. This effect was transiently reverted 20 min after the administration of 465 

lidocaine. At this stage spinalization had rather mild effects on the correlation. Yet 466 

the configuration of the coefficients of correlation resembled that attained during 467 

capsaicin (RMSS=0.22).  468 

The experiment of Fig. 5C is interesting because the control coefficients of 469 

correlation already showed a mild separation in two clusters. Capsaicin increased 470 

the correlation in the cluster comprising the weakly correlated CDPs, practically 471 

without affecting the other cluster. This effect was also temporarily reverted by 472 

lidocaine.  473 

Changes in power spectra and coherence  474 

Analysis of the changes in power spectra and coherence of neuronal activity 475 

during motor and cognitive processes, as well as during chronic pain, have 476 

provided relevant clues on the frequency dependence of the network activity in a 477 

variety of brain structures (see Kocsis & Vertes, 1992; Davis et al., 1998; Sarnthein 478 

et al., 2003; Leblanc et al., 2014). This raised the question on the extent to which 479 

the nociceptive-induced changes in correlation between CDPs and IFPs described 480 

in the previous section were also associated with changes in power spectra and 481 

coherence of the CDPs. 482 

 Power Spectra: Fig. 6A displays the power spectra of the CDPs recorded from 483 

the caudal region in both sides of the L6 segment (L6cL, black traces and L6cR, 484 

blue traces) in the same experiment as that of Figs.1-4. It may be seen that 10-20 485 

min after capsaicin (Fig. 6B) there was a clear increase in the power spectra of the 486 

CDPs in the low frequency range (1.5-4.5 Hz). This effect became largest by 80-90 487 

min after the injection and was stronger on the CDPs recorded in the left (injected 488 

side) than in the right side of the spinal cord (Fig. 6C). As shown by the normalized 489 

traces in Fig. 6H, at that time capsaicin reduced the high frequency components of 490 

the power spectra. 491 



18 
 

10 to 20 minutes after the systemic administration of lidocaine, the amplitude of 492 

the power spectra was reduced and nearly recovered its pre-capsaicin values 493 

(Figs. 6D; see also normalized traces in Fig. 6I). This effect was short lasting and 494 

was over by one hour after the injection (Fig. 6E). At that time the frequency 495 

components of the power spectra were rather similar to those displayed during 496 

capsaicin (Fig. 6J). Spinalization reduced the lower frequency and increased the 497 

higher frequency components of the power spectra (Fig. 6F and 6K). A second 498 

injection of lidocaine had practically no effect on the power spectra throughout the 499 

whole frequency range (Fig. 6G and L).  500 

The changes in power spectra produced by capsaicin and lidocaine were not 501 

restricted to one segment but comprised the whole lumbar segments in both sides 502 

of the spinal cord as illustrated in Fig. 6M-Q. Soon after the injection of capsaicin 503 

(Fig. 6N) there was a clear increase in the power spectra in the left side of the 504 

spinal cord (injection site), particularly in the rostral and caudal regions of the L6 505 

segment. Later on, the increase in the power spectra expanded bilaterally and 506 

included the more rostral spinal segments, but even then was somewhat larger in 507 

the left than in the right side (Fig. 6O; see also Fig. 6E). The capsaicin-induced 508 

increase of the power spectra was very effectively counteracted by the systemic 509 

injection of lidocaine. This effect started around 10-20 min after the injection (Fig. 510 

6P) and was over about one hour later (Fig. 6Q). Spinalization reduced the 511 

magnitude and segmental spread of the power spectra, particularly in the low 512 

frequency range, while at the same time increased the high frequency components 513 

(Fig. 6R). This effect was temporarily and mildly reverted by a second injection of 514 

lidocaine (Fig. 6S).  515 

Coherence: Although the most significant effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on 516 

the power spectra of the CDPs occur in the low frequency range, they still provide 517 

limited information pertaining the frequency domains that underlie the overall 518 

changes in correlation described in the previous sections. Therefore, we examined 519 

the changes produced by capsaicin, lidocaine and spinalization on the frequency 520 

dependence of correlation. That is, on the coherence between CDPs.  521 



19 
 

Figure 6T to W discloses the effect of capsaicin and lidocaine on the coherence 522 

between the ongoing CDPs in four different frequency ranges (1.5-2.5, 3.5-4.5, 9-523 

10 and 17.5-18.5 Hz). These frequencies correspond to the rising phase, peak and 524 

the falling phase of the power spectra (see red arrows and gray bars in Fig. 6A). 525 

Capsaicin increased the coherence, mostly in the low and intermediate frequency 526 

range (i.e., 1.5-2.5, 3.5-4.5 Hz and 9.0-10 Hz, Fig. 6T-V) and had clearly smaller 527 

effect at higher frequencies (above 17.5 Hz, Fig.6W). 528 

As it was found for the overall correlations depicted in Fig. 1G, the systemic 529 

injection of lidocaine temporarily counteracted the effects of capsaicin on 530 

coherence in all the frequency ranges. Spinalization also reduced the coherence, 531 

particularly in the low range of frequencies (1.5-4.5 Hz). The second dose of 532 

lidocaine appeared to have a small effect, if any, on the low frequency components 533 

of the coherence, despite the clear reduction in the power spectra (see below).  534 

In summary, analysis of effects of capsaicin on the power spectra of the CDPs 535 

recorded in each segment further indicates that the activity generated in the rostral 536 

and caudal regions of the left L6 segment is particularly affected. Coherence 537 

measurements show in addition that the stronger effects of capsaicin on correlation 538 

occur in the low frequency range, just when the power spectra attain their maximal 539 

amplitude. Similar effects were seen in the other 3 experiments included in Fig. 5 540 

(not illustrated). The consequences of the effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on 541 

both power spectra and coherence for nociceptive responses will be further 542 

considered in the Discussion  543 

Effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on acute spinalized preparations 544 

Effects on correlation between paired sets of CDPs: There is a wealth of 545 

evidence pertaining the modulation of spinal neuronal activity exerted by 546 

supraspinal pathways in response to intense and prolonged nociceptive stimulation 547 

(Porreca et al., 2002; Vanegas & Schaible 2004; Heinricher et al., 2009; Brink et 548 

al., 2012).  549 



20 
 

As we have shown in the previous sections, the increased correlation between 550 

CDPs seen once the action of lidocaine was over became largely attenuated by an 551 

acute high spinal transection (see Fig. 1). This finding already indicated that the 552 

maintenance of the effects induced by capsaicin on the correlation between the 553 

CDPs was under supraspinal control. Yet, it raised the question on whether 554 

supraspinal influences were also required for the establishment of the effects of 555 

capsaicin and lidocaine, and whether this process could be prevented by previous 556 

spinalization. Such possibility might be anticipated from the findings of Urban & 557 

Gebhart (1999), who showed that spinal cord transection prevented the 558 

development of secondary, but not of primary mechanical and/or thermal 559 

hyperalgesia induced by topical mustard oil application, carrageenan inflammation 560 

or nerve section. 561 

The raw recordings displayed in Fig. 7A and B show that spinalization reduced 562 

the slow synchronized CDPs and increased the frequency of the brief potentials 563 

recorded in the L5 and L6 segments. In contrast with what has been observed in 564 

the preparations with intact neuraxis, capsaicin applied after spinalization slightly 565 

increased the frequency of the fast components of the CDPs (Fig. 7C; see also Fig. 566 

10A), an effect that was transiently reduced by lidocaine (Fig. 7D and E). 567 

Fig. 7F shows that before spinalization the control coefficients of correlation of 568 

the paired sets of CDPs had a rather stable configuration that was changed after 569 

spinalization to another, also stable configuration. Following the intradermal 570 

injection of capsaicin there was a small reduction in the correlation, but later on, 571 

the distribution of the coefficients of correlation resembled that displayed before 572 

capsaicin and appeared to be slightly affected by the subsequent administration of 573 

lidocaine. Equivalent behavior was seen for the correlation between the IFPs (both 574 

superficial and deep) and the CDPs (Fig. 7G-H). In other words, after spinalization, 575 

neither capsaicin nor lidocaine appeared to induce major changes on the patterns 576 

of correlation between the ongoing CDPs and IFPs. 577 

Segmental distribution of the correlation 578 



21 
 

The data depicted in Figure 8A-E show that in contrast with what has been 579 

observed in the preparation with intact neuroaxis, capsaicin and lidocaine had 580 

minor effects on the spatial (segmental) distribution of the correlation between the 581 

spontaneous CDPs when tested after spinalization. This was particularly clear for 582 

the CDPs recorded from neighboring pairs exhibiting the highest coefficients of 583 

correlation (above 0.8; Fig. 8B1-E1), but was also seen on pairs with coefficients in 584 

the 0.6-0.8 range (Fig. 8B2-E2) as well as in the lower ranges (see panels B3-E3,  585 

B4-E4 and B5-E5). It should be noted that the effects of spinalization were 586 

particularly notorious for the sets of crossed CDPs whose correlation was reduced 587 

by this procedure (compare Fig. 8A2 with Fig 8B2), a finding  that suggests that 588 

crossed connectivity between dorsal horn neuronal populations is particularly 589 

affected by supraspinal influences.  590 

Plotting the coefficients of correlation obtained during a given procedure against 591 

the control coefficients showed very clearly that spinalization led to the separation 592 

of the coefficients in two distinct clusters (Fig. 8F and G) resembling the effect of 593 

capsaicin observed in some experiments with intact neuroaxis (see Fig. 4). 594 

However in this case the effect of capsaicin and lidocaine on both clusters was 595 

rather mild (Fig. 8H-J), as it could be assessed by the relatively small changes in 596 

the slope of best linear fits of the coefficients (Ps>0.05). Yet, the RMSS values 597 

between the corresponding correlograms were of 0.4, 0.41 and 0.56, respectively, 598 

suggesting a modest resemblance between them.  599 

Effects of capsaicin and lidocaine in other experiments  600 

In addition to the experiment described above we examined the effects of 601 

capsaicin and lidocaine applied after acute spinalization in three additional 602 

experiments (two in Fig. 9 and one in Fig. 12). In general the results obtained 603 

agreed with those described for the experiment illustrated in Figs. 7-8. Namely, in 604 

the spinal preparation, capsaicin as well as lidocaine had rather weak effects on 605 

the intrasegmental correlation between the ongoing CDPs.  606 

The experiment depicted in Fig. 9A is interesting because the control 607 

coefficients of correlation were rather high for all paired sets of CDPs. 608 



22 
 

Nevertheless, 30 min after spinalization there was an overall reduction in the 609 

correlation that was barely affected 20-60 min after capsaicin. The systemic 610 

injection of lidocaine (10-55 min) increased the variance of the coefficients, but 611 

even so the overall changes were not significantly different from those attained 612 

before the administration of this local anesthetic, as it could be verified by the 613 

coefficients of similarity (see Figure). As shown in the lower set of graphs, after 614 

spinalization the slopes of the best linear fits of the coefficients also remained 615 

essentially the same after capsaicin and lidocaine (Ps> 0.05).  616 

Fig. 9B shows data from another experiment where spinalization also reduced 617 

the correlation between the CDPs and the subsequent effects of capsaicin and 618 

lidocaine were rather small. Quite interestingly, as indicated by the low coefficients 619 

of similarity, the capsaicin-induced correlograms were barely affected 20, 40 and 620 

55 min after the systemic injection of lidocaine (RMSS= 0.24, 0.18 and 0.20, 621 

respectively). This, together with the finding that all the best linear fits had a 622 

Ps>0.05 suggests further that after spinalization the neuronal populations 623 

generating the CDPs had rather stable structured patterns of connectivity that were 624 

barely affected by capsaicin and lidocaine. 625 

Changes in power spectra and coherence in previously spinalized 626 

preparations 627 

Power spectra: The relatively small effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the 628 

correlation between the CDPs observed in the spinal preparations displayed in 629 

Figs. 7 and 8 prompted us to examine the effects on their power spectra. 630 

Spinalization reduced the power spectra in the low frequency range to about 631 

one third of control while at the same time slightly increased the high frequency 632 

components (Fig. 10A, B). In contrast with what has been observed in the 633 

preparation with intact neuraxis (Fig. 6A-C), after spinalization capsaicin produced 634 

a relatively small increase in the power spectra of the CDPs recorded in the L6rL 635 

segment, basically without affecting the power spectra of the CDPs recorded in the 636 



23 
 

right side (Fig. 10C), while lidocaine slightly and transiently reduced the power 637 

spectra of the CDPs recorded in both sides (Fig. 10D-F).  638 

Figures 10G-L illustrate the segmental distribution of the power spectra of the 639 

CDPs after spinalization, capsaicin and lidocaine. They show that spinalization 640 

reduced the magnitude of the power spectra in the low frequency range and at the 641 

same time increased the spatial (segmental) spread of the power spectra in the 642 

higher frequencies, particularly in the left side (Fig. 10H), suggesting that 643 

descending influences play a relevant role in the shaping (and spatial focusing) of 644 

the segmental distribution of neuronal connectivity. It should be noted that the 645 

effects of capsaicin were relatively small (Fig. 10I) and included networks located 646 

farther away from the primary projections of the capsaicin-activated afferents. This 647 

effect was partly reversed by lidocaine, but never as it did in the preparation with 648 

intact neuroaxis (Fig. 10J-L).  649 

Coherence: The largest changes in coherence produced by spinalization were 650 

observed in the low frequency range (2.5-5.0 Hz; Fig. 10M and N), but even within 651 

that range the changes produced by capsaicin and lidocaine were rather small. In 652 

the 9.5-10.5 Hz range capsaicin appeared to slightly reduce the correlation (Fig. 653 

10O) and had almost no effects in the higher ranges (18.0-19.0 Hz; Fig. 10P). 654 

Similar results were observed for the correlation and coherence of the S-IFPs and 655 

D-IFPs with the CDPs recorded in this experiment (not illustrated).  656 

Altogether this set of observations indicates that after acute spinalization the 657 

action of capsaicin and lidocaine on the spinal networks was relatively weak in 658 

comparison with that observed in preparations with intact neuroaxis. These 659 

findings indicate that supraspinal influences are required not only for the 660 

maintenance of the effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the correlation between 661 

the CDPs, but also for their establishment. 662 

Effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the responses evoked by mechanical 663 

stimulation of the skin  664 



24 
 

Preparations with intact neuroaxis: One of the questions that emerged from the 665 

analysis of the effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the correlation between paired 666 

sets of ongoing CDPs is the extent to which these changes had any relation with 667 

the development of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by intense and 668 

prolonged nociceptive stimulation. To this end, we examined in preparations with 669 

intact neuroaxis the effects of the intradermic injection of capsaicin and of the 670 

subsequent systemic administration of lidocaine on the spinal responses evoked 671 

by light mechanical stimulation of the skin delivered close and distant to the site of  672 

capsaicin injection (sites showing primary and secondary hyperalgesia; see Treede 673 

et al.,1992; Burstein et al., 2010; Sang et al., 1996) and how these changes were 674 

related to alterations in the patterns of segmental correlation between the ongoing 675 

CDPs.  676 

In these experiments the recordings of the ongoing CDPs were briefly 677 

interrupted to stimulate the skin by means of a pair of small glass tubes connected 678 

to a device that was able to provide mechanical stimulation by delivering air puffs 679 

of controlled duration and intensity and resumed after these tests were completed 680 

(see Methods).  681 

Figure 11A depicts the CDPs evoked in the rostral and caudal regions of the left 682 

L5 and L6 segments by mechanical stimulation of the skin with an air puff applied 683 

close to the capsaicin injection site. That is, on the region of primary hyperalgesia 684 

(Site 1). The intradermic injection of capsaicin increased both the amplitude and 685 

area of the CDPs evoked by mechanical stimulation of the skin at this site. This 686 

effect was already evident 20 min after the injection of capsaicin and became 687 

largest 75 min after the injection. At that time the amplitude of the evoked 688 

responses was increased between 128 and 148% (see 2
nd

 column in Fig. 11A).  689 

40 min after the injection of lidocaine the responses recorded in the L6 as well 690 

as in the rostral region of the L5 segment were further increased (144-163%), in 691 

contrast with the responses recorded in the L5cL that were slightly reduced (from 692 

147 to 134%; 3
rd

 column in Fig. 11A). Later on (60-85 min) the evoked responses 693 



25 
 

remained facilitated (fourth and fifth columns), suggesting a prolonged effect of 694 

capsaicin that was not reversed by lidocaine.  695 

The effect of capsaicin and lidocaine on the segmental distribution of the CDPs 696 

produced by mechanical stimulation of the region of secondary hyperalgesia (Site 697 

2) are illustrated in Fig. 11B. The control responses produced by the mechanical 698 

stimulus were clearly smaller than those produced by stimulation in the primary 699 

zone (see calibration bar), but even so, those recorded in the L5 segments and in 700 

the rostral region of L6 segment (L6rL) were clearly increased 75 min after the 701 

injection of capsaicin (between 109-154%; see 2
nd

 column in Fig. 11B).  702 

In contrast with the lack of effects of lidocaine on the capsaicin-facilitated 703 

responses produced by stimulation at site 1, 40 min after the injection of lidocaine, 704 

the amplitude of the responses recorded in the rostral and caudal region of the L5 705 

segment and in the rostral region of the L6 segment was reduced and went below 706 

the control amplitudes (99, 78 and 82% respectively; 3
rd

 column in Fig. 11B). By 707 

60- 85 min the effects of lidocaine were over (4
th

 and 5
th

 columns in Fig. 11B).  708 

The capsaicin-induced separation of the coefficients of correlation between the 709 

CDPs in two distinct clusters coincided in time with the increase of the CDPs 710 

evoked by mechanical stimulation of the skin, both at sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 11C, D, G 711 

and H). An unexpected and quite interesting finding was that the lidocaine-induced 712 

merging of the coefficients in one cluster (Fig. 11E, I) occurred during the reversion 713 

of the capsaicin-induced facilitation of the CDPs evoked by mechanical stimulation 714 

at site 2. Furthermore, the subsequent increase in the mechanically evoked 715 

responses observed after the lidocaine effects were over, again coincided with the 716 

separation of the coefficients in two clusters (Fig. 11F, J) suggesting a persistent 717 

action of capsaicin. 718 

Effects in previously spinalized preparations: The observations described in 719 

Figs. 7-10 already indicated that in previously spinalized preparations capsaicin 720 

and lidocaine had rather small effects on the correlation between the ongoing 721 

CDPs. It thus seemed important to examine the effects of these procedures on the 722 

responses evoked after spinalization by mechanical stimulation of the skin. 723 



26 
 

The first column in Fig. 12A shows the responses recorded in several spinal 724 

segments following a mechanical stimulus applied rather close to the site of the 725 

injection of capsaicin in the footpad (Site 1). The largest responses were generated 726 

in the caudal region of the left L6 segment (L6cL) and in the rostral part of the L7 727 

segment (not illustrated). After spinalization the responses recorded in L6cL 728 

following tactile stimulation were facilitated to 116% relative to control and 729 

remained about the same in the other segments (2
nd

 column in Fig. 12A). 65 min 730 

after the intradermic injection of capsaicin in the already spinalized preparation, the 731 

amplitude of the evoked responses recorded in all segments was clearly smaller 732 

(from 58 to 77% relative to the amplitude of the responses recorded after 733 

spinalization; see 3
rd

 column Fig. 12A) and increased again after lidocaine (4
th
 and 734 

5
th

 columns in Fig. 12A).  735 

After spinalization, the responses produced in segments L5 and L6 by 736 

mechanical stimulation applied to the region of secondary hyperalgesia (Site 2) 737 

showed relatively small changes when tested 65 min after capsaicin except in 738 

segment L5cL that were reduced to 83% (compare 2nd and 3rd columns in Fig. 739 

12B). The subsequent injection of lidocaine slightly reduced the responses evoked 740 

in the L5 segment and had a rather small effect on the responses evoked in the L6 741 

segment (4
th

 and 5
th

 columns in Fig. 12B). 742 

As in Fig. 8G, spinalization separated the coefficients of correlation in two 743 

clusters (Fig. 12C, D, H and I). 70-75 min after capsaicin there was a clear 744 

reduction in the correlation of the paired set of CDPs included in cluster C2, 745 

practically without affecting the correlation between the CDPs included in cluster 746 

C1 (Fig. 12 E and J). The slopes of the best fits of the C1 and C2 clusters obtained 747 

after capsaicin remained basically the same 15-20 min and 40-45 min after 748 

lidocaine (Ps>0.05; Fig. 12F,G,K,L), even though the correlograms obtained after 749 

capsaicin (Fig. 12E) and Lidocaine 15-20min (Fig. 12F) were somewhat different 750 

(RMSS=0.74). 751 

In summary, these observations indicate that the effects of capsaicin and 752 

lidocaine on the segmental correlation between paired sets of ongoing CDPs as 753 



27 
 

well as on the CDPs evoked by mechanical stimulation of the skin in the region of 754 

secondary hyperalgesia are relatively small when these tests are performed in 755 

preparations previously devoid of supraspinal influences.  756 

Discussion  757 

The present observations have shown a) that the intradermic injection of 758 

capsaicin in the left hind paw increases the coefficients of correlation between the 759 

ongoing cord dorsum potentials simultaneously recorded from different lumbar 760 

spinal segments as well as their correlation with the superficial and deep 761 

intraspinal field potentials, b) the effects of capsaicin on these correlations are 762 

transiently counteracted by the systemic administration of a small dose of 763 

lidocaine, c) the effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the correlation between 764 

CDPs as well as on the cord dorsum responses evoked by mechanical stimulation 765 

of the skin in the region of secondary hyperalgesia are greatly attenuated when 766 

tested in previously spinalized preparations. 767 

Altogether the present findings are taken as an indication that capsaicin 768 

induces a structured, non-random (see Methods) supraspinally mediated 769 

reorganization of the functional connectivity between the spinal neuronal networks 770 

involved in the generation of the ongoing CDPs that is transiently reversed by 771 

lidocaine. Similar increases in correlation between CDPs as those exerted by 772 

capsaicin and lidocaine have been observed with skin lesions produced by 773 

localized burning (unpublished observations).  774 

The action of Capsaicin and lidocaine on neuronal correlation  775 

The intradermic injection of capsaicin induces inflammatory nociception through 776 

the activation of the VR1 receptors in the A∂ and C fibres innervating the affected 777 

skin areas and increases their synaptic effectiveness (Hui et al., 2003) as well as 778 

mechanical hyperalgesia in humans (Wallace et al., 1997; Holthusen et al., 2000). 779 

The timing of the long lasting increase in correlation and coherence between cord 780 

dorsum potentials induced by intradermal capsaicin suggests that this effect is not 781 

related to the initial short lasting activation of C-fiber nociceptors that follows the 782 



28 
 

intradermic injection (Wall & Woolf, 1984; Cook et al., 1987), but to enduring 783 

central influences, since the maximum effects of capsaicin are seen about 90 784 

minutes after the intradermic injection, while the capsaicin-induced increase in the 785 

C fiber activity lasts less than 60 minutes and is followed by inhibition (Galhardo et 786 

al., 2002). Moreover, after the central effect of capsaicin has been established, 787 

local anesthesia of the inflamed paw produced no substantial changes on the 788 

capsaicin-induced changes in correlation between CDPs (unpublished 789 

observations).  790 

The slight reduction in correlation observed during the first 10 minutes after the 791 

injection of capsaicin shown in Fig. 1G could be due to a short-lasting capsaicin 792 

induced inhibition of the synaptic actions of the nociceptive afferents in the dorsal 793 

horn (Yanga et al., 1999). It is also possible that the desynchronized barrage of 794 

sensory input produced by this nociceptive stimulus temporarily counteracts the 795 

correlation between CDPs (see Inbar et al., 1979).  796 

Pertaining the effect of lidocaine, Puig & Sorkin (1996) showed that the effects 797 

of systemic injection of lidocaine were not related to blockade of impulse 798 

conduction in low threshold tactile afferents, although they could silence the A∂ and 799 

C fibres already activated by the nociceptive stimulus. These findings agree with 800 

our observation that the systemic administration of a low dose of lidocaine had no 801 

anesthetic effect on the peripheral and intraspinal terminals of low threshold 802 

afferents since it did not depress the cord dorsum responses produced by 803 

mechanical stimulation of the skin at the site of the primary hyperalgesia produced 804 

by the injection of capsaicin (Fig. 11A). 805 

Alternatively, lidocaine could have a direct effect on the capsaicin-activated 806 

nociceptive afferents as well as on the spinal neurones affected by capsaicin. It 807 

could also act as an anesthetic onto the supraspinal networks and reduce their 808 

influence on the spinal neuronal activity in response to the nociceptive stimuli. 809 

Although these possibilities are not mutually exclusive, a relevant supraspinal 810 

action is supported by the finding that the capsaicin-induced increase in the 811 

correlation between the spinal networks and its temporal reversal by lidocaine are 812 



29 
 

minimal when capsaicin and lidocaine are administered in previously spinalized 813 

preparations (Figs.7-10 and Fig. 12; for review see Urban & Gebhart 1999). 814 

We suggest that the intradermic injection of capsaicin activates ascending 815 

nociceptive pathways (most likely via the lateral spinothalamic pathway) that trigger 816 

supraspinally mediated changes. The state of central sensitization induced by the 817 

nociceptive stimulus would be transiently curtailed by lidocaine acting most likely 818 

on supraspinal neurones in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) which is a relay of 819 

ascending and descending nociceptive pathways, as well as in the ventromedial 820 

medulla (RVM) and raphe nuclei, among others (see Willis, 1985; Jones & 821 

Gebhart, 1987; Zhuo & Gebhart, 1997; Urban & Gebhart, 1999; Fields 2000; 822 

Millan, 2002; Suzuki and Dickenson, 2005).  823 

Nociceptive-induced coupling between supraspinal and spinal activity?  824 

There is a wealth of information showing that many central structures display 825 

delta and theta waves during nociception both in animal models (Miletic & Coffield, 826 

1989; Kocsis & Vertes, 1992; Leblanc et al., 2014) and in humans under different 827 

neurological conditions as well as during neuropathic pain (Sarnthein & 828 

Jeanmonod, 2008). Our data indicate that in the preparations with intact neuroaxis 829 

the capsaicin-induced increase in coherence between spinal neuronal activity also 830 

occurs within this range, that is also the range of activity observed in spinalized 831 

preparations, even before the injection of capsaicin.  832 

It is tempting to suggest that spinal and supraspinal oscillations at similar 833 

frequency rates provide the temporal structure that allows them to enter in 834 

resonance (Fries, 2005), a feature of relevance for the shaping of the nociceptive 835 

message (Katz et al., 1999; Averbeck & Lee., 2004; Shyu & Vogt, 2009) and for 836 

pain perception (Burstein et al., 2010).  837 

Supraspinal control of allodynia and secondary hyperalgesia 838 

Our observations indicate that during the state of central sensitization induced 839 

by capsaicin there is a significant increase in the correlated activity of superficial 840 

and deep IFPs with the CDPs (Fig. 3). This effect occurs on both sides of the 841 



30 
 

spinal cord, is larger between the deep IFPs (laminae III-V) and CDPs than 842 

between the superficial IFPs (laminae I and II) and CDPs at the segmental level of 843 

entrance of nociceptive information in the ipsilateral (left) side, and gradually 844 

expands in a rostral and caudal direction on both sides of the cord.  845 

This fits very well with the observations of Schoffnegger et al., (2008) who 846 

showed that allodynia (pain elicited by innocuous stimuli), is associated with a 847 

synaptically mediated spread of excitation from deep intraspinal areas of 848 

termination of A fibers (laminae III-V) to the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I and 849 

II; see also Willis & Coggeshall, 2004), and partly explains the finding of Levine et 850 

al., (1985) who showed in rats that capsaicin injected in one hindlimb induced 851 

hyperalgesia and edema on both ipsi and contrateral hindlimbs, possibly through a 852 

supraspinal neural action. 853 

These findings, together with the observation that the capsaicin-induced 854 

increase in the amplitude of the CDPs produced by mechanical stimulation of the 855 

skin in the region of secondary hyperalgesia occurred in association with a state of 856 

increased correlation between CDPs, while the reduction of the capsaicin-induced 857 

facilitation of the evoked potentials that followed the administration of lidocaine 858 

happened during the state of decreased correlation between CDPs ( Fig. 11), are 859 

compatible with a causal relation between the changes in correlation of the CDP-860 

generating neuronal ensembles and the changes in the responses produced by 861 

mechanical stimulation of the skin. An additional argument supporting this proposal 862 

is that both require the connection of the spinal neuronal networks with supraspinal 863 

structures (Fig. 12).  864 

Some functional implications  865 

The present set of observations suggests that the changes in functional 866 

connectivity between spinal neurones produced by acute nociceptive stimulation 867 

are the expression of the dynamic response of a system in conditions of criticality 868 

in which descending control is able to shift the neuronal networks to a different 869 

functional state. That is, of a self-organized system in a critical state where minor 870 



31 
 

disturbances in neuronal synchronization may lead to events way out of balance 871 

(Bak, 1997; Parker & Srivastava, 2013; Haimovici et al., 2013, Hesse & Gross, 872 

2014; Massobrio et al., 2015).  873 

The tempering of this state by systemic lidocaine correlates well with clinical 874 

observations in humans and provides further evidence that descending supraspinal 875 

influences operating on the spinal cord are part of the process of central 876 

sensitization which persists once it has been established (pain memory?; see 877 

Vera-Portocarrero et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2002; Bee & Dickenson 2007, 2008). 878 

One important question that remains to be addressed is how the observed 879 

effects of capsaicin and lidocaine are brought about. Are the capsaicin induced 880 

changes product of the activation of a limited repertoire of structured configurations 881 

of tightly coupled sets of neurones (modules?) (see Song et al., 2005; d'Avella & 882 

Bizzi, 2005) or else, are these configurations produced by graded changes in 883 

neuronal connectivity within the same distributed ensemble, as suggested by the 884 

observations of Contreras-Hernández et al., (2015). 885 

Structured changes in synchronization between dorsal horn neurones appear to 886 

be an effective way to address information flow to specific neuronal networks (see 887 

also Abarbanel et al., 1996; Jiao, 2006; Womelsdorf et al., 2007). In fact, the 888 

recruitment of presynaptic inhibitory pathways during high levels of spontaneous 889 

dorsal horn neuronal synchronization described by Contreras-Hernández et al., 890 

(2015), could play a relevant role in the addressing of sensory information during 891 

secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by nociceptive stimulation (see 892 

Cervero et al., 2003). 893 

The present study provides important evidence regarding the overall changes in 894 

neuronal correlation during nociceptive stimulation but rather limited information on 895 

the concurrent changes in the connectivity of specific, functionally identified 896 

neuronal populations. Based on the assumption that the spontaneous CDPs are 897 

produced by the synchronous activation of specific populations of dorsal horn 898 

neurones (Manjarrez et al., 2000, 2003; Chávez et al., 2012), one possible 899 

approach to this problem would be to examine the changes induced by nociceptive 900

32 
 

stimulation on the different types of spontaneous CDPs and relate them to a 901 

specific function as it was recently done by Contreras-Hernández et al. (2015).  902 

To this end, we developed a machine learning procedure for the automatic 903 

selection of the ongoing CDPs according to their shape and amplitude (Martín et 904 

al., 2015). With this method the CDPs recorded in a particular experiment during 905 

different procedures could be reliably separated in different classes. We found that 906 

the classes comprising the smallest CDPs had higher probabilities of occurrence 907 

than those including the largest CDPs. We also found that capsaicin had a dual 908 

action on the CDPs. Namely, it reduced the probabilities of occurrence of some of 909 

the small CDP classes while at the same time increased the probabilities of 910 

occurrence of most of the largest CDP classes. These changes led to a different 911 

non-random configuration of the whole set of CDPs that was fully and temporarily 912 

reversed by lidocaine (Rudomin et al., 2012). These differential effects of capsaicin 913 

on the CDPs could also contribute to the assemblage of the coefficients of 914 

correlation in two distinct clusters (Figs. 3 and 4). The finding that spinalization also 915 

separates the coefficients in two classes (Fig. 8G) further suggests that the single 916 

cluster arrangement depends, to a great extent, on supraspinal influences that are 917 

disrupted by capsaicin.  918 

To fully appreciate the functional implications of the supraspinal modulation of 919 

the effects of capsaicin on the different classes of CDPs it is necessary to examine 920 

the association of each class with a specific function (e.g. with the generation of 921 

DRPs and presynaptic inhibition), as well as their correlation with the activity of 922 

individual, functionally identified neurones (see Contreras-Hernández et al., 2015). 923 

A detailed characterization of the genetic identity of the neurones contributing to 924 

the different classes of CDPs could also contribute to this endeavor (see Zagoraiou 925 

et al., 2009; Goulding 2009; Fink et al., 2014). 926 

A final point: Changes in the ongoing cord dorsum activity have been 927 

occasionally used to evaluate disorders in patients with peripheral nerve, root and 928 

spinal cord damage (Ertekin et al., 1983), to monitor changes in spinal cord activity 929 

during microsurgical sectioning of dorsal roots for pain, spasticity and hyperactive 930 

bladder (Sindou et al., 1994) and also to predict harmful spinal cord ischemia 931 



33 
 

during repair of thoracic or thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms (Stuhmeier et al., 932 

1993). We believe that information obtained from the changes in correlation 933 

between ongoing CDPs may provide useful indicators of the functional states of the 934 

spinal cord in humans under diverse normal and pathological situations.  935

Figure Legends 1225 

Figure 1.- Systemic lidocaine reverses the capsaicin-induced increase in 1226 

correlation between ongoing spinal cord activity. A-F, CDPs recorded from the 1227 

L5 caudal and the L6 rostral segments in both sides and IFPs recorded at two 1228 

different depths in the L6cL segment before and after capsaicin, lidocaine and 1229 

spinalization, as indicated. Negativity is upward for CDPs and downward for the 1230 

IFPs. The histological section on the left shows the intraspinal location of the IFP 1231 

recording sites. G, changes produced by capsaicin, lidocaine and spinalization on 1232 

the correlation between the paired sets of CDPs recorded with the ensemble of 12 1233 

electrodes placed along the L4-L7 segments on both sides of the spinal cord. The 1234 

whole set of coefficients of correlation obtained during the 10 min Control 0 1235 

recording period is displayed in descending order as a vertical column. The 1236 

coefficients of correlation obtained from 10 min non-overlapping recordings made 1237 

at subsequent times are displayed keeping the same order as the Control 0 1238 

coefficients. Colors show magnitude of correlation (see scale). Arrows show time of 1239 

capsaicin and lidocaine injections and of spinalization. H-I, equivalent displays of 1240 

the coefficients of correlation of the S-IFPs and D-IFPs with the CDPs recorded 1241 

from different segments, as indicated. See text for further explanations. 1242 

 1243 

Figure 2.- The patterns of segmental correlation between CDPs are disrupted 1244 

after the intradermic injection of capsaicin and temporarily restored by 1245 

systemic lidocaine. A, horizontal display of the coefficients of correlation obtained 1246 

from all the combinations between paired sets of the CDPs recorded during the 1247 

control period ordered according to their magnitude and separated in 4 different 1248 

ranges as shown by colors. A1-A4, spinal cord diagrams showing the segmental 1249 

location of the paired sets of CDPs used to calculate the coefficients of correlation 1250 

in each range. Lines indicate segmental location of CDP recording sites. B-B4, 1251 

correlograms and segmental distribution of coefficients obtained from recordings 1252 

made 70-80 min after the injection of capsaicin. Note in panel B1 increased 1253 

correlation between CDPs recorded from neighboring segments. C-C4, the effects 1254 



44 
 

of capsaicin are reversed 10-20 min after the systemic injection of lidocaine. D-D4, 1255 

restoration of the effects of capsaicin 80-90 min after the injection of lidocaine. E-1256 

E4, spinalization removes the post-lidocaine increase in correlation. F-F4, after a 1257 

second injection of lidocaine the segmental distribution of the coefficients of 1258 

correlation resembles the configuration attained 10-20 min after the first 1259 

administration of lidocaine. The coefficients of similarity (RMSS) between 1260 

correlograms generated under different experimental conditions are indicated by 1261 

the brackets. Red numbers denote correlograms with highest similarity. Same 1262 

experiment as that of Fig. 1. Further explanations in text.  1263 

 1264 

Figure 3.- Differential effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the correlation of 1265 

superficial and deep intraspinal fields with the CDPs recorded from different 1266 

segments. The graphs with the horizontal bars display the coefficients of 1267 

correlation arranged in descending order. The segmental distribution of these 1268 

coefficients is shown in the right. In both graphs the colors indicate the magnitude 1269 

of the correlation (see scale). Separate plots were made for the correlations of the 1270 

S-IFPs and D-IFPs with the CDPs as indicated. Location of intraspinal electrodes is 1271 

shown in Fig. 1. The brackets show the RMSS values between different pairs of 1272 

correlograms. Numbers in red indicate denote the lowest RMSS values, suggesting 1273 

similar distributions. Same experiment as that of Fig.1 and 2. See text for further 1274 

explanations. 1275 

 1276 

Figure 4.- The differential effects of capsaicin on the functional connectivity 1277 

between dorsal horn neurones are transiently reversed by lidocaine and 1278 

suppressed by spinalization. Panels A-I show the graphs obtained by plotting 1279 

the control coefficients of correlation between paired sets of CDPs (Control 0, 1280 

abscissae) versus the coefficients obtained at different times before and during the 1281 

action of capsaicin (A-C), after lidocaine (D-G), after spinalization (H) and after a 1282 

second administration of lidocaine (I). Note that after capsaicin the coefficients of 1283 

correlation were separated in two distinct clusters that persisted without substantial 1284 



45 
 

changes until the injection of lidocaine transiently reverted the effects of capsaicin 1285 

giving rise to a single cluster. After spinalization the post-lidocaine two-cluster 1286 

arrangement of the coefficients changed to a single cluster. The RMSS similarity 1287 

coefficients between the different correlograms as well as the ANCOVA p values 1288 

for the C1 and C2 components are included in the figure. J-R, effects of capsaicin, 1289 

lidocaine and spinalization on the correlation of the S-IFPS and D-IFPs with the 1290 

CDPs. Data obtained from the same experiment as that of Fig. 1-3. See text for 1291 

further details. 1292 

 1293 

Figure 5.- Consistency of effects on correlation between CDPs produced by 1294 

capsaicin and lidocaine in preparations with intact neuraxis. A, B and C, data 1295 

from 3 different experiments showing correlograms and graphs relating control 1296 

coefficients of correlation versus effects produced by capsaicin and lidocaine as 1297 

indicated. Note that despite the differences in the control correlograms in the three 1298 

experiments, capsaicin increased the correlation between CDPs and lidocaine 1299 

transiently reversed the effects of capsaicin. RSMM coefficients of similarity 1300 

between different correlograms are indicated in the figure. Bars at the bottom show 1301 

timing of the different procedures. See text for further details.  1302 

 1303 

Figure 6.- Systemic lidocaine transiently reverses the capsaicin-induced 1304 

increase in power spectra and coherence between CDPs. A-C, power spectra 1305 

of the CDPs recorded from segments L6cL (black traces) and L6cR (blue traces) 1306 

before, 10-20 min and 80-90 min after the intradermic injection of capsaicin. D, E 1307 

power spectra obtained from recordings made 10-20 min and 80-90 min after the 1308 

systemic administration of lidocaine. F, 10-20 min after spinalization. G, second 1309 

dose of lidocaine injected 60-70 min after spinalization. H-L, superposed traces of 1310 

the normalized spectra of the L6cL CDPs allow comparison of the changes in the 1311 

different frequency components produced by capsaicin, lidocaine and spinalization, 1312 

as indicated (see colors). M-S, segmental distribution of the changes in power 1313 

spectra produced by capsaicin, lidocaine and spinalization. Graphs show 1314 



46 
 

frequency of power spectra versus segmental location of the recording sites. 1315 

Frequency changes in left (L) and right (R) sides are plotted separately as mirror 1316 

images (see abscissa). The colors indicate the magnitude of the power spectra in 1317 

logarithmic scale (see calibration). Note the expansion of the capsaicin-induced 1318 

spectral increase towards the more rostral segments and the transient suppression 1319 

of this effect by lidocaine. T-W, changes in coherence between CDPs produced by 1320 

the different experimental procedures in four frequency ranges as indicated (see 1321 

red arrows and gray bars in control spectra displayed in A). Note that the capsaicin 1322 

increase in coherence is largest in the low frequency range (1.5-4.5Hz). Same 1323 

experiment as that of Figs.1 and 2. Further explanations in text.  1324

Figure 7.- Supraspinal dependence of the effects of capsaicin and lidocaine 1326 

on the correlation between ongoing CDPs and IFPs. Same format as that of 1327 

Figure 1. A-E, raw recordings of the CDPs and IFPs obtained after spinalization, 1328 

capsaicin and lidocaine, as indicated. F, vertical display of the coefficients of 1329 

correlation obtained from sets of 5 min continuous recordings displayed taking as 1330 

reference the distribution of the Control 0 coefficients. G-H, correlation of S-IFPs 1331 

and D-IFPs with CDPs. Insert shows spinal location of IFP recording sites. See text 1332 

for further explanations.  1333 

 1334 

Figure 8.- The effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on the segmental 1335 

distribution of the correlation between the CDPs are subjected to a 1336 

supraspinal control. A-E, same format as that of Fig. 2. The effects of the 1337 

different procedures are indicated in each panel. Note that after spinalization the 1338 

segmental distribution of the coefficients of correlation was not significantly 1339 

changed by capsaicin and lidocaine. The RMSS values between different 1340 

correlograms are indicated. F-J graphs obtained by plotting the control coefficients 1341 

of correlation between CDPs (Control 0, abscissae) versus the coefficients 1342 

obtained at different times as indicated. Ps was >0.05 for both C1 and C2 in Spinal 1343

10-15 min vs Cap 65-70 min, Cap 65-70 min vs Lido 15-20 min and Lido 15-20 min 1344 

vs Lido 55-60 min. See text for further explanations. 1345 

Figure 9.- Changes in correlation produced by capsaicin and lidocaine in 1346 

previously spinalized preparations. A and B data from 2 different experiments 1347 

showing correlograms and graphs relating control coefficients of correlation versus 1348 

changes induced by different procedures as indicated. Same format as that of Fig. 1349 

5. Note that after spinalization, capsaicin and lidocaine had rather small effects on 1350 

the correlation between CDPs. RMSS values between different correlograms, best 1351 

linear fits and Ps values are indicated in the figures. Bars at the bottom show 1352 

timing of the different procedures. See text for further details. 1353 

 1354 

Figure 10.- Spinalization greatly attenuates the effects of capsaicin and 1355 

lidocaine on the power spectra and coherence between CDPs seen in 1356 

preparations with intact neuroaxis. Same format as that of Fig. 6. A-F, changes 1357 

in the power spectra of CDPs recorded from segments L6rL (black traces) and 1358 

L6rR (blue traces) during several experimental procedures, as indicated. G-L, 1359 

graphs showing frequency versus segmental location of the changes in power 1360 

spectra produced by spinalization, capsaicin and lidocaine. Note that after 1361 

spinalization, capsaicin slightly increases the power spectra in the low frequency 1362 

range and that this effect was mildly reduced by lidocaine, particularly in the right 1363 

side. Recordings of L7rR were not available. M-P, changes in coherence between 1364 

CDPs produced by the different experimental procedures in four frequency ranges 1365 

as indicated. Note that lidocaine has a rather weak action on the capsaicin 1366 

changes induced after spinalization, particularly for frequencies above 9.5 Hz. 1367

Figure 11.- Systemic lidocaine transiently reverses the facilitation of the 1370 

spinal responses evoked by mechanical stimulation in the region of 1371 

secondary hyperalgesia as well as the capsaicin-induced disruption of 1372 

correlation between CDPs. A, CDPs produced by mechanical stimulation of the 1373 



48 
 

skin with an air puff applied close to the site of capsaicin injection (Site 1). B, same 1374 

as A, following mechanical stimulation farther away from the capsaicin-injection 1375 

site (35 mm), within the region of secondary hyperalgesia (Site 2). The numbers 1376 

indicate percentage changes in peak amplitude of the mechanically evoked 1377 

responses relative to the amplitude of the control responses. C-F changes in the 1378 

coefficients of correlation between paired sets of CDPs produced by capsaicin and 1379 

lidocaine at the indicated times. Numbers show the RMSS values between pairs of 1380 

correlograms obtained at different times after capsaicin and lidocaine, as indicated. 1381 

G-J, plots of the control 0 coefficients (abscissae) against the correlation 1382 

coefficients obtained under the different experimental procedures (ordinates). The 1383 

graphs H and J show that the separation between the two clusters observed 60-70 1384 

min after capsaicin was transiently reduced 30-40 min after lidocaine. At that time 1385 

the correlogram resembled the control one (RMSS value 0.34). 50-60 min after 1386 

lidocaine the coefficients were again distributed in two similar clusters resembling 1387 

those displayed 60-70 min after capsaicin (Ps> 0.05 for both C1 and C2). Bar at 1388 

the bottom shows timing of the different procedures. See text for further details. 1389 

 1390 

Fig. 12.- After acute spinalization the effects of capsaicin and lidocaine on 1391 

the responses produced by mechanical stimulation of the skin as well as on 1392 

the correlation between CDPs are strongly attenuated. Same format as Fig. 11. 1393 

A, Effects of spinalization, capsaicin and lidocaine on the CDPs recorded in the 1394 

rostral and caudal regions of the L5 and L6 segments following tactile stimulation 1395 

of the skin close to the site of capsaicin injection (Site 1, primary hyperalgesia). B, 1396 

effects on CDPs evoked by mechanical stimulation away from the capsaicin-1397 

injection site (35 mm), within the region of secondary hyperalgesia (Site 2). The 1398 

numbers indicate percentage changes in peak amplitude of the mechanically 1399 

evoked responses relative to the amplitude of the responses produced after 1400 

spinalization. C-G changes in the coefficients of correlation between CDPs 1401 

produced by capsaicin and lidocaine at the indicated times. RMSS values between 1402 

correlograms are shown. H-L, plots of the control 0 coefficients (abscissae) against 1403 



49 
 

the correlation coefficients obtained under different experimental procedures 1404 

(ordinates). Note that spinalization separated  the coefficients in two clusters. 1405 

Capsaicin slightly reduced the correlation between the paired sets of CDPs 1406 

grouped in cluster C2, practically without affecting the correlation between CDPs in 1407 

cluster C1. Lines show best linear fits. Ps ><0.05 for C12 and C2 and Ps>0.05 for 1408 

C1 in Spinal 30-35 min vs Cap 70-75 min, . Ps >0.05 for C1 and C2  in Cap 70-75 1409 

min vs Lido 15-20 min and Lido 15-20 min vs Lido 40-45 min. Bar at the bottom 1410 

shows timing of the different procedures. See text for further explanations. 1411
