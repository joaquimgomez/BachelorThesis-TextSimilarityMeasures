Agents’ perceptions on the state of the economy can be affected during economic crises. 

Tendency surveys are the main source of agents’ expectations. The main objective of this study 

is to assess the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on agents’ expectations. With this aim we 

evaluate the capacity of survey-based expectations to anticipate economic growth in the United 

States, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. We propose a symbolic regression (SR) via 

genetic programming (GP) approach to derive mathematical functional forms that link survey-

based expectations to GDP growth. By combining the main SR-generated indicators, we generate 

estimates of the evolution of GDP. Finally, we analyse the effect of the crisis on the formation of 

expectations, and we find an improvement in the capacity of agents’ expectations to anticipate 

economic growth after the crisis in all countries except Germany.

I. Introduction 

 

Economic expectations are central in macro-economic time series modelling. 

Tendency surveys provide detailed information about agents’ expectations, but the 

qualitative nature of agents’ responses has led to quantify survey results. Numerous 

methods to transform responses about the expected direction of change into a quantitative 

measure of agents’ expectations have been proposed in the literature. See Lahiri and Zhao 

(2015) and Nardo (2003) for an appraisal of the different quantification methods. The 

theoretical framework for quantifying survey expectations is based on the assumption that 

respondents report a variable to go up if the mean of their subjective probability 

distribution lies above a threshold level, also known as indifference interval (Theil, 1952). 

Carlson and Parkin (1975) developed this probability approach by using a normal 

distribution. Mitchell (2002) and Balcombe (1996) found evidence that normal 

distributions provided as accurate expectations as other stable distributions. 

Several refinements of the probabilistic approach have been proposed in order to 

reduce the measurement error introduced by restrictive assumptions (Breitung and 

Schmeling, 2013; Mitchell et al., 2007; Löffler, 1999; Berk, 1999; Smith and McAleer, 

1995; Pesaran, 1987; Batchelor, 1986). By comparing the individual responses with firm-

by-firm realizations, Müller (2010) developed a variant of the Carlson-Parkin method 

with asymmetric and time invariant thresholds. In a recent study, Lahiri and Zhao (2015) 

linked quantified expectations to quantitative realizations at the firm-level and obtained 

a significant improvement in accuracy by allowing for cross-sectional heterogeneity and 

asymmetric and time-varying thresholds, especially during periods of uncertainty with 

high levels of disagreement between respondents. 

This result has led us to analyse the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on agents’ 

expectations. The relationship between changes in expectations and economic variables 

has been widely investigated (Martinsen et al., 2014; Ghonghadze and Lux, 2012; 

Schmeling and Schrimpf, 2011; Franses et al., 2011; Graff, 2010; Klein and Özmucur, 

2010; Claveria et al., 2007), but never before by means of symbolic regression (SR). SR 

can be regarded as an empirical modelling approach, particularly indicated to find the 

most fitting algebraic expression in large data sets, especially when the model structure 

is unknown or changes over time.

By combining a SR approach with genetic programming (GP), we are able to quantify 

survey-based expectations and generate estimates of GDP growth. There are different 

strategies for finding a solution in SR. Koza (1992) proposed applying GP to implement 

SR in order to empirically assess the exchange equation. In spite of its versatility, GP 

applications in economics are still few (Álvarez-Díaz and Álvarez, 2005; Acosta-

González et al., 2012). 

With the aim of analysing the effect of the economic shock on the formation of agents’ 

expectations in the United States (US), Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK), 

we evaluate the capacity of the SR-generated estimations of GDP to anticipate economic 

growth, prior, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis. The empirical results show that 

the capacity of agents’ expectations to anticipate economic growth improved after the 

crisis in all four economies. 

 

II. Experimental setup 

 

The experiment consists on designing a SR modelling strategy to find optimal 

combinations of survey expectations to estimate the year-on-year growth of the GDP. 

We link twelve survey indicators from the CESIfo World Economic Survey (WES) 

(Table 1) to year-on-year growth rates of quarterly GDP data from the OECD. The 

sample period goes from the second quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2014. See 

Hutson et al. (2014) and Claveria et al. (2016) for an appraisal of the CESIfo’s WES.

By means of SR we derive building blocks defined as simple combinations of 

survey variables. From the expressions returned by the GP algorithm for 28 countries of 

the OECD, we combine the most fitted empirical functions to generate a SR-indicator

that is used to forecast economic growth in the US, Japan, Germany and the UK. In 

Table 2 we present a detailed description of the parameters of the experiment. 

Regarding the termination criterion, we set a maximum number of 150 generations. We 

use the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms Package (DEAP) framework implemented 

in Python.

III. Results 

 

The empirical analysis is divided in two parts. First, we graphically compare the 

evolution of the proposed SR-generated indicator, which can be regarded as a proxy for 

economic growth, to that of the Economic Climate Index (ECI) and the GDP (Fig. 1). 

The ECI is an aggregate indicator obtained as the arithmetic mean of the assessments 

about the general economic situation and the expectations for the economic situation in 

the next six months (CESifo World Economic Survey, 2011). 

Fig. 1 shows that the proposed SR-generated indicator and the ECI show a similar 

pattern of evolution, closely correlated to the oscillations of GDP. Girardi (2014), Jean-

Baptiste (2012), and Qiao et al. (2009) find evidence that survey expectations provide 

useful information for forecasting purposes. The main difference between both indicators 

resides in the scale. This is especially evident during the 2008 financial crisis, when the 

quantified expectations’ downward reaction is of greater magnitude than that of the ECI.

To analyse whether the 2008 financial crisis has had an influence on the forecast 

accuracy of survey-based measures of economic expectations, we evaluate the 

forecasting performance of the SR-generated estimates of GDP, differentiating between 

the pre-crisis sub-period (2000-2007), the crisis (2008-2010), and the post-crisis sub-

period. We compute the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) proposed by Hyndman and 

Koehler (2006), which scales the errors by the MAE obtained with a random walk. As 

official data are published with a delay of more than a quarter with respect to survey 

data, we use two-step ahead naïve forecasts as a benchmark. Results of this comparison 

are presented in Table 3. 

The results in Table 3 show that the forecast accuracy of survey-based expectations 

significantly improved during the crisis. Agents’ expectations have been more accurate 

in the post-crisis years than in the pre-crisis years in all countries except Germany. Japan 

is the only country where agents’ expectations are always more accurate than the 

predictions obtained with the benchmark model. These results are in line with those of 

Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014), who found that the 2008 financial crisis period 

had led to a decrease in expectational errors in transition economies.

IV. Conclusion 

 

This paper proposes a data-driven approach to derive quantitative estimates of GDP 

from qualitative survey responses about the state of the economy by means of SR via GP. 

With the aim of analysing the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on agents’ expectations, 

we assess the capacity of SR-generated expectations to anticipate future economic growth, 

prior, during, and after the financial crisis, finding that the crisis period has led to an 

improvement in the forecasting performance of agents’ expectations in all countries 

except Germany.
