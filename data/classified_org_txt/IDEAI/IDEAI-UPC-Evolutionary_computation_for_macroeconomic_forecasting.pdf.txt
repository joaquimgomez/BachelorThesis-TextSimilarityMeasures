Abstract 
 

The main objective of this study is twofold. First, we propose an empirical modelling 

approach based on genetic programming to forecast economic growth by means of survey 

data on expectations. We use evolutionary algorithms to estimate a symbolic regression 

that links survey-based expectations to a quantitative variable used as a yardstick, 

deriving mathematical functional forms that approximate the target variable. The set of 

empirically-generated proxies of economic growth are used as building blocks to forecast 

the evolution of GDP. Second, we use these estimates of GDP to assess the impact of the 

2008 financial crisis on the accuracy of agents' expectations about the evolution of the 

economic activity in four Scandinavian economies. While we find an improvement in the 

capacity of agents' to anticipate economic growth after the crisis, predictive accuracy 

worsens in relation to the period prior to the crisis. The most accurate GDP forecasts are 

obtained for Sweden.

1 Introduction 

 

Evolutionary computation is being increasingly applied in economics. The main idea 

behind evolutionary computation is the implementation of algorithms that adopt 

principles of the theory of natural selection to problem solving (Fogel 2006). These 

algorithms are known as evolutionary algorithms (EAs). One of the most implemented 

EAs in optimization problems is the genetic algorithm (GA) developed by Holland 

(1975). Cramer (1985) proposed a generalization of GAs known as genetic programming 

(GP), in which the solutions are expressed in the form of computer programs. Whereas 

GAs codes potential solutions by means of fixed length binary string representations, GP 

uses tree-structured, variable length representations suitable for non-linear modelling. 

This more general representation scheme allows the model structure to vary during the 

evolution. As a result, GP is particularly indicated for empirical modelling. 

Empirical modelling consists on developing mathematical models from experimental 

data, which implies finding both the structure and the parameters of the model 

simultaneously. Koza (1992) developed a novel approach to empirical modelling based 

on symbolic regression (SR) via GP. SR can be regarded as a modelling technique used 

to construct regression models (such as linear regression, radial basis functions, support 

vector machines, kriging, etc.) by searching the space of mathematical expressions that 

best fit a given dataset. In this search there is usually a trade-off between accuracy and 

simplicity. Koza (1992) used GP to find the best single computer program that solves a 

given SR problem. This approach is especially useful to find patterns in large data sets, 

where little or no information is known about the system. 

In this study we implement SR via GP to find the relationship between a wide range 

of expectational variables and economic growth. We use survey data on expectations from 

the World Economic Survey (WES) carried out by the CESIfo Institute for Economic 

Research. By combining a SR approach with GP, we derive mathematical functional 

forms that can be regarded as the optimal combinations of survey variables that best fit 

the actual evolution of the economic activity. We use these computationally-generated 

expressions as building blocks to forecast year-on-year growth rates of GDP. 

Expectations about the state of the economy are key in economic modelling. One of 

the most common ways for agents to reveal their expectations is through tendency 

surveys. Business and consumer tendency surveys ask agents whether they expect a 



 3 

variable to rise, to remain constant, or to fall. The relationship between quantitative data 

and respondents’ expectations was first formalised by Anderson (1952) and Theil (1952), 

who regressed the actual average percentage change of an aggregate variable on the 

percentage of respondents expecting a variable to rise and to fall. The theoretical 

framework for quantifying these percentages was initially based on the existence of an 

interval around zero within which respondents perceive there are no significant changes 

in the variable. Thus, respondents would answer that they expect a certain variable to go 

up (or down) to the extent that the mean of their subjective probability distribution lied 

beyond a threshold level. These thresholds could therefore be regarded as the limits of an 

indifference or imperceptibility interval. Carlson and Parkin (1975) developed this 

approach by using a normal distribution, and by assuming unbiasedness over the sample 

period to estimate the difference limen. This approach was latter extended by Pesaran 

(1984, 1985), who allowed the model for an asymmetrical relationship between the actual 

average percentage change and the agents’ changes in periods of growth. 

By matching individual responses with realisations, several authors have further 

explored this relationship at the micro level (Białowolski 2016; Breitung and Schmeling 

2013; Lahiri and Zhao 2015; Lui et al. 2011a, 2011b; Mitchell et al. 2002, 2005a, 2005b; 

Mokinski et al. 2015; Müller 2010; Zimmermann 1997). Müller (2010) proposed a variant 

of the Carlson-Parkin method with asymmetric and time invariant thresholds. Breitung 

and Schmeling (2013) found that the introduction of asymmetric and time-varying 

thresholds was key in order to improve the forecast accuracy of quantified survey 

expectations, while the individual heterogeneity across forecasters seemed to play only a 

minor role. Using household-level data from the University of Michigan, Lahiri and Zhao 

(2015) found strong evidence against the threshold constancy, symmetry, homogeneity, 

and overall unbiasedness assumptions of the Carlos-Parkin method. 

Experimental expectations generated by Monte Carlo simulations have also been used 

to delve into the relationship between individual expectations and their quantitative 

equivalent. Common (1985) generated simulated expectations to test the rational 

expectations hypothesis. Simulation experiments have also been used to assess the 

forecasting performance of different quantification methods of survey expectations. By 

means of individual computer-generated expectations, Claveria (2010) compared the 

forecasting performance of the main quantification methods, while Löffler (1999) and 

Terai (2009) estimated the measurement error introduced by the Carlson-Parkin method. 



 4 

The link between survey expectations and quantitative data at the aggregate level has 

been widely investigated (Abberger 2007; Batchelor and Dua 1998, 1992; Bergström 

1995; Berk 1999; Bovi 2013; Bruestle and Crain 2015, Bruno 2014; Claveria et al. 2007; 

Dees and Brinca 2013; Driver and Urga 2004; Graff 2010; Hansson et al. 2005; Jean-

Baptiste 2012; Kauppi et al. 1996; Leduc and Sill 2013; Lee 1994; Mittnik and Zadrozny 

2005; Nardo 2003; Nolte and Pohlmeier 2007; Pesaran and Weale 2006; Qiao et al. 2009, 

Rahiala and Teräsvirta 1993; Robinzonov et al. 2012; Smith and McAleer 1995; Sorić et 

al. 2013; Wilms et al. 2016). Klein and Özmucur (2010) analysed the role of survey 

expectations in 26 European countries, and found that they improved the forecasting 

performance of autoregressive time series models. 

Schmeling and Schrimpf (2011) found that survey-based measures of expected 

inflation were significant predictors of future aggregate stock returns in France, Germany, 

Italy, the UK, the US and Japan, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Using survey 

expectations of 12 European countries, Ghonghadze and Lux (2012) obtained a superior 

out-of-sample forecasting performance with a canonical opinion dynamics model than 

with univariate time series models. Jonsson and Österholm (2012) analysed the inflation 

expectations formation process in Sweden using survey expectations, obtaining a poor 

forecasting performance that could be partly attributable to a mismeasurement of 

expectations. However, Österholm (2014) found that survey-based expectations 

improved the out-of-sample forecasting performance of GDP growth predictions in 

Sweden. 

Martinsen et al. (2014) constructed factor models based on disaggregate survey data 

to forecast inflation, unemployment and GDP in Norway. The authors obtained the most 

accurate results for GDP growth. Girardi (2014) found that survey expectations contained 

relevant information about business cycle developments in the Euro Area (EA), especially 

around periods of extreme cyclical swings. Guizzardi and Stacchini (2015) showed that 

the inclusion of business survey indicators in time series models increased the forecasting 

accuracy of the baseline models. In a recent study, Altug and Çakmakli (2016) generated 

inflation forecasts by combining data on survey expectations with the inflation target set 

by central banks, finding the former to increase the predictive power of the models. 

Similarly, Lehmann and Wohlrabe (2017) found that consumers’ unemployment 

expectations were a good indicator of employment growth in Germany.

These studies use a wide range of econometric techniques, but none of them assesses 

the relationship between both official quantitative data and qualitative survey 

expectations by means of evolutionary methods. This research aims to break new ground 

by linking survey data and economic growth by means of evolutionary computation. We 

design a SR experiment in order to find the optimal combinations of survey expectations 

that best fit the actual evolution of year-on-year growth rates of GDP. Lahiri and Zhao 

(2015) found a significant improvement in agents’ expectations accuracy during periods 

of uncertainty. This finding has also led us to assess the impact of the 2008 financial crisis 

on agents’ ability to forecast the evolution of economic activity. Hence, we use the 

estimates of GDP in four Scandinavian economies and compare them to a baseline model 

by means of the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) proposed by Hyndman and Koehler 

(2006). 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 presents our proposed 

methodological approach and the experimental set up. In Sect. 3 we present the empirical 

results. Finally, Sect. 4 provides some concluding remarks. 

 

 

2 Methodology 

 

GP is a soft computing search technique for problem-solving. GP’s tree-structured 

programs are evolved by means of genetic operators for model approximation. In this 

study we design a SR experiment in order to derive a set of functional forms that link 

survey expectations to economic growth. This data-driven regression approach assumes 

no a priori model. Using EAs that apply Darwinian principles that imitate aspects of 

biological evolution, such as the principle of survival and reproduction of the fittest, an 

initial population of computer programs are bred through generations to find a set of 

analytical functions that best fit the data. 

Koza (1992) developed GP for implementing SR. In his seminal paper, Koza (1995) 

applied GP to assess the non-linear “exchange equation”, finding the empirical 

relationships between the price level, and gross national product, money supply, and the 

velocity of money. The versatility of this empirical modelling approach has attracted 

researchers from different areas (Álvarez-Díaz et al. 2009; Barmpalexis et al. 2011; Cai 

et al. 2006; Can and Heavey 2011; Ceperic et al. 2014; Sarradj and Geyer 2014; Wu et 

al. 2008; Yao and Lin 2009). 



 6 

Nevertheless, most of the applications of evolutionary computing to economics have 

been in finance (Goldberg 1989). Regarding GP, Álvarez-Díaz and Álvarez (2005) used 

GP to forecast exchange rates of the yen and the pound to the US dollar. Larkin and Ryan 

(2008) applied GP to nowcast stock prices using ordinal news sentiment data generated 

in real time by classifying financial news into positive, negative and neutral. The authors 

found that GP effectively predicted large intraday price jumps on the Standard & Poor 

500 return index (S&P 500) up to an hour before they occurred without using current 

market prices information. Based upon its performance in eight stock markets and eight 

foreign exchange markets during three consecutive test periods, Chen et al. (2008) 

thoroughly analysed the application of GP to financial trading, shedding some light on 

how GP performance could be connected to the trending and cyclical properties of 

financial data. Wilson and Banzhaf (2009) compared a developmental co-evolutionary 

GP approach to standard linear GP for interday stock prices prediction. Vasilakis et al. 

(2013) presented a GP-based technique to predict returns in the trading of the euro/dollar 

exchange rate based on historical data and assessed its forecasting performance relative 

to four different approaches, obtaining the highest trading performance with the proposed 

method. 

Regarding GAs, Acosta-González et al. (2012) used a GA to select the best 

econometric model for explaining the 2008 financial crisis, and found that the main 

determinant was the percentage of bank claims on private sector over deposits in the year 

2006. By means of a computational search methodology based on GAs, Acosta-González 

and Fernández-Rodríguez (2014) selected the optimal financial ratios employed in a logit 

model to forecast bankruptcy in the Spanish building industry using annual public 

accounting information. Huang et al. (2015) presented a novel methodology for pairs 

trading using GAs. Sheta et al. (2015) modelled the S&P 500 using multi-gene SR. Multi-

gene SR is a special variation of the classic GP algorithms where each symbolic model is 

represented by a number of GP trees weighted by a linear combination. The method was 

used to evolve linear combinations of non-linear functions of 27 input variables, obtaining 

robust results when tracking the S&P 500 index in a weekly basis. Ramos-Herrera and 

Acosta-González (2017) evaluated the factors explaining exchange rate stability in 17 

economies of the European Union (EU) making use of GAs. Among the higher impact 

factors, the authors found that variables measuring competiveness, including agents’ 

expectations, clearly stood out due to their repeated presence in the different models. For 

a review of the applications of GAs for financial forecasting see Drake and Marks (2002). 



 7 

Applications of evolutionary computation in economics are more recent. See Chen 

and Kuo (2002) for a classification of the literature on the application of evolutionary 

computation to economics and finance. Chen et al. (2010) introduced GP in a vector error 

correction model for macroeconomic forecasting. By means of SR via Pareto GP, 

Kotanchek et al. (2010) provided some insight into GDP forecasting. Duda and Szydło 

(2011) applied an improved version of GP known as gene expression programming (GEP) 

(Ferreria 2011) to develop a set of economic forecasting models. Kronberger et al. (2011) 

used SR to identify variable interactions between 33 economic indicators in order to 

estimate the evolution of prices in the US. Kľúčik (2012) used SR via GP in the estimation 

of total exports and imports to Slovakia. Krömer et al. (2013) presented an an application 

of GP to the evolution of fuzzy rules based on the concept of extended Boolean queries. 

In their approach, fuzzy rules are used as symbolic classifiers learned from data and used 

to label data records and to predict the value of an output variable. The authors used GP 

to find fuzzy rules labelling faulty products in a steel processing plant. Yang et al. (2015) 

used a data-driven approach based on SR to predict oil production in the US, using data 

from the 48 lower states since 1859. 

By means of GAs, Acosta-González et al. (2014) selected the best econometric model 

for explaining the determinants of the size of the shadow economy using data from 38 

economies. The authors found that the main determinants of the shadow economy were: 

taxes on capital gains of individuals, corporate taxes on income, profits and capital gains, 

domestic credit, bank secrecy, ethnic fractionalization, urban population, globalization, 

corruption and the socialist legal origin of country. Kapetanios et al. (2016) assessed the 

forecasting performance of GAs and two other heuristic optimisation algorithms 

(simulated annealing and the 3MC  algorithm) to forecast quarterly GDP growth and 

monthly inflation in the EA based on a large set of 195 monthly indicators. The authors 

found that variable selection based on heuristic optimisation of information criteria often 

outperformed variable reduction methods (principal components, partial least squares, 

and Bayesian shrinkage regression). See Milutinović et al. (2015, 2017) and Petković 

(2015) for alternative heuristic optimisation strategies. 

In a recent study, Marković et al. (2017) made use of ten science and technology 

factors as inputs for GDP growth prediction in 28 EU countries. The authors compared 

the predictive accuracy of GP and other soft computing methods to that of extreme 

learning machines (ELMs) (Huang et al. 2006), and obtained the highest accuracy with 



 8 

ELMs were initially proposed as learning algorithms for single-hidden layer feedforward 

neural networks characterised by fast training time. 

Among recent developments in evolutionary computation, Zelinka (2005) introduced 

analytical programming, and showed its ability to synthesize suitable solutions 

(programs) in SR. Maschek (2010) developed a two-level learning (or self-adaptation) 

mechanism and evaluated how it affected an economic application of GAs. Vladislavleva 

et al. (2010) evaluated different ways of improving SR by incorporating weights into the 

fitness function. Waltman et al. (2011) examined to what extent the use of binary 

encoding strategies influence the results produced by GAs. Peng et al. (2014) proposed 

an improved GEP algorithm especially suitable for dealing with SR problems. Gandomi 

and Roke (2015) compared the forecasting performance of ANN models to that of GEP 

techniques. See Dabhi and Chaudhary (2015) and Poli et al. (2010) for a review of the 

main issues related to GP. 

GP allows to find patterns in large data sets. This feature is particularly suitable where 

little or no information is known about the system. As opposed to evolutionary 

programming (Fogel 1966), in which the structure of the program to be evolved remains 

fixed, GP simultaneously evolves the structure and the parameters of the models. We use 

GP to formalize the interactions between survey variables that best fit the evolution of 

economic activity. As there is an arbitrary functional relationship between the set of 

survey variables (Table 1), we link them to the actual percentage growth rate of GDP by 

means of a SR model: 

 

 ititititititititititititit xxxxxxxxxxxxfy 12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1  (1) 

 

where itit xx 12,,1   are the different survey variables, and ity  is a scalar referring to the 

year-on-year growth rate of quarterly GDP for country i  at time t . We divide the set of 

survey variables into three types: judgements about the present economic situation

 ititit xxx 3,2,1 , perceptions about the present economic situation compared to last year 

 ititit xxx 6,5,4 , and expectations for the next six months about the economic situation 

 ititit xxx 9,8,7  and the foreign trade volume  ititit xxx 12,11,10 . See Table 1.

By means of GP we evolve the symbolic mathematical expressions, until a stopping 

criterion is reached, be it a predetermined value of the fitness function or a given number 

of generations. We want to note that there is a trade-off between fitness and complexity. 

To deal with the growth in the complexity of the SR function we introduced a term that 

penalized the functions that exceeded a given number of terms. In this study we have 

chosen a maximum number of 150 generations as as stopping criterion. In Table 2 we 

summarize the steps for implementing GP. 

 

Table 2. GP implementation – Steps 

1. Creation of an initial population of programs 1,000 

2. Evaluation of fitness for each program Root mean square error (RMSE) 

3. Selection of a reproduction strategy Tournament method (size 3) 

4. Application of genetic operators Mutation probability 0.1 

5. Determination of constants Automatically generated 

6. Creation of a new population Max. generations 150 

 

(1) First, to start the process an initial population of 1000 programs was created. 

(2) Then , for each member of the population, an error metric was calculated. We used 

the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a fitness function. 

(3) From the existing strategies for the selection of parents for replacement, which are 

the programs used to create offspring programs, we used the tournament method so as to 

guarantee diversity in the population. This method is based on the selection of the fittest 

individual in each tournament among a group of individuals chosen at random from the 



 10 

population. One of the main advantages over other alternative methods is that the 

selection pressure can be easily adjusted and it is code-efficient. 

(4) Then, genetic operators (crossover and mutation) are applied to the parents 

selected on the basis of the fitness function. Crossover consists on the recombination of 

randomly chosen parts of parents, while mutation on randomly altering a part of a parent.  

(5) We included the automatic generation of constants provided by the GA. This set 

of constants is optimised after a number of generations to avoid the search path to deviate 

from the optimum. 

(6) As the process evolves, the fitness of the population increases as steps three and 

four are repeated until the creation of a new population in each generation once a required 

minimal fitness has been achieved. In this experiment we have chosen a maximum 

number of 150 generations as a stopping criterion. 

The output of this process is a set with the best individual functions from all 

generations. In this study we have used the open source Distributed Evolutionary 

Algorithms Package (DEAP) framework implemented in Python (Fortin et al. 2012; Gong 

et al. 2015). 

 

 

3 Results 

 

In this section we present the results of the experiment. The SR has been estimated using 

survey data from the CESIfo WES for 28 countries of the OECD, and GDP data retrieved 

from the OECD web (https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart). The 

sample period goes from the second quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2014. The WES 

is carried out by the CESIfo Institute for Economic Research. The questionnaire asks 

respondents whether they expect their country’s general economic situation to get better, 

worse, or to remain unchanged. Qualitative responses are transformed by means of a 

grading procedure consisting in giving a rank of 9 to positive replies, of 5 to indifferent 

replies, and of 1 to negative replies (CESifo World Economic Survey, 2011). Survey 

results are published as aggregated data by country, weighting the results according to the 

country’s share of trade worldwide. See Henzel and Wollmershäuser (2005), Stangl 

(2007, 2008), and Hutson et al. (2014) for a detailed analysis of WES data. 

https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart

Using as a criterion the correlation coefficients between the elements of the 

population and the dependent value, we have selected a set of building blocks (Table 3) 

for the top 20 functions returned by the GP algorithm.

The building blocks in Table 3 are then introduced as regressors of GDP growth so as 

to obtain the coefficients used to generate the optimal linear combination to track the 

evolution of economic growth. In order to assess the GP-generated forecasts of GDP, we 

first compare the evolution of the obtained estimations of economic growth to that of the 

Economic Climate Index (ECI) constructed by the Ifo. The ECI is an aggregate indicator 

obtained as the arithmetic mean of assessments of the general economic situation and the 

expectations for the economic situation in the next six months. The trend in the ECI tends 

to correlate closely with the actual business-cycle trend measured in annual growth rates 

of real GDP (Garnitz et al. 2015). In Table 4 we present a descriptive analysis of the ECI 

for the four Scandinavian economies analysed in this study.

Fig. 1 compares the evolution of the GP-generated forecasts and the ECI, which show 

a similar pattern of evolution. The main difference resides in the scale, especially during 

the 2008 financial crisis, when the ECI downward reaction is of lesser magnitude. 

In Fig. 2 we compare the evolution of the GP forecasts to that the year-on-year growth 

rates of GDP. We can observe that GR-based estimates seem to correlate closely with the 

actual oscillations of GDP. In all four economies agents’ expectations seem to advance 

turning points, especially regarding the 2008 financial crisis. The severity of the crisis 

varies across countries, being Sweden, and especially Finland, the economies showing 

the highest percentages of decrease in the activity. At the opposite end, Norway shows 

the lowest decline in terms of GDP growth, being the only country in which the GR-

generated forecasts from agents’ expectations overestimate the extent of the crisis. 

After the graphical analysis, we evaluate the forecasting performance of the quantified 

expectations by comparing them to a benchmark model in order to compute the MASE. 

This measure of forecast accuracy was developed by Hyndman and Koehler (2006), who 

proposed scaling the forecast errors by the in-sample mean absolute error (MAE) obtained 

with a random walk. As official data are published with a delay of more than a quarter 

with respect to survey data, we use two-step ahead naïve forecasts as a baseline. The 

MASE statistic presents several advantages over other forecast accuracy measures. First, 

it is independent of the scale of the data. Second, it does not suffer from some of the 

problems presented by other relative measures of forecast accuracy such as the relative 

MAE. Finally, it is easy to interpret: values larger than one are indicative that the GP-

based forecasts are worse than the average prediction computed in-sample with the 

baseline model. 

If we denote the forecast error obtained by means of GP as 
ttt YYe ˆ , the scale error 

is defined as:

Hence, the MASE is obtained as the mean of tq ,  tqmeanMASE  . 

With the aim of assessing the potential influence of the 2008 financial crisis on the 

forecasting accuracy of GP-generated estimates of GDP, we re-compute the MASE 

differentiating between the pre-crisis subperiod (2000-2007), the crisis (2007-2010), and 

the post-crisis subperiod (Table 5).

The results in Table 5 show that forecast accuracy of the estimates of GDP 

significantly worsened during the crisis in all countries. Agents’ expectations are more 

accurate in the post-crisis than in the pre-crisis years in all four economies. These results 

are in line with those of Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014), who found that the 2008 

financial crisis period led to a decrease in expectational errors in transition economies. 

Similarly, Girardi (2014) found that survey expectations contained relevant information 

about business cycle developments in the EA, especially around periods of extreme 

cyclical swings. Vermeulen (2014) found that Carlson–Parkin type indices outperformed 

the balance indices during periods with higher output volatilities. In a recent study, Lahiri 

and Zhao (2015) also found a significant improvement in agents’ expectations accuracy 

during periods of uncertainty marked by high levels of disagreement between 

respondents. By contrast, using survey expectations for Croatia, Erjavec et al. (2015) 

found that consumers' bias regarding inflation diminished in times of lower price 

volatility. 

 

 

4 Concluding remarks and future work 

 

Evolutionary computation is increasingly being used for economic applications. In this 

study we implement GP to find the most fitted mathematical functional forms linking 

survey expectations to economic growth. By linearly combining the output of this GP-

generated set of models, we estimate the evolution of GDP in Scandinavian economies. 

The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of survey expectations for economic 

forecasting and circumvents the issue of quantifying qualitative expectations on the 

direction of change. Thus, this data-driven method for modelling survey-based agents’

expectations avoids making assumptions about the subjective probability distribution of 

respondents. 

SR via GP allows selecting the fittest models of interaction between agents' 

expectations and the official quantitative series they refer to. As a result, the evolution of 

the GP-generated forecasts correlates closely with the actual oscillations of the economic 

activity and with other official economic indicators such as the ECI. This result suggests 

that this empirical approach to model survey expectations on the direction of change may 

provide gains in forecast accuracy. 

We have also analysed the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the accuracy of 

agents’ expectations by assessing the capacity of GP-generated estimates of GDP to 

anticipate future economic growth. We have found that the crisis period has led to a 

deterioration in the forecasting performance of agents’ expectations in Scandinavian 

economies. 

Despite the versatility of the proposed GP approach for modelling survey-based 

expectations to estimate economic growth, some aspects have been left for further 

research. We have not evaluated to what extent the forecasting performance of GP 

predictions could have been improved by increasing the maximum number of 

generations. There is also the question of whether the implementation of improved 

adaptive algorithms, such as Ferreira’s gene expression programming or Zelinka’s 

analytical programming, may improve the forecasting performance of computationally 

generated economic forecasts. Finally, another issue left for future research is the use of 

GP-based expectations to assess empirically observed economic relationships such as the 

Phillips curve, or to test the rational expectations hypothesis.
