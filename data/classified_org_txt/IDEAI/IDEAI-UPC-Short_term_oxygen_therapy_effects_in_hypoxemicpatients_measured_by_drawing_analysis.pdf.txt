Abstract 

Background: Chronic hypoxemia has deleterious effects on psychomotor function that can 

affect daily life. There are no clear results regarding short term therapy with low 

concentrations of O2 in hypoxemic patients. We seek to demonstrate, by measuring the 

characteristics of drawing, these effects on psychomotor function of hypoxemic patients 

treated with O2 . 

Methods: Eight patients (7/1 M/F, age 69.5(9.9) yrs, mean (SD) with hypoxemia (Pa O2 

62.2(6.9)mmHg) performed two drawings of pictures. Tests were performed before and after 

30 min breathing with O2.  

Results:  Stroke velocity increased after O2 for the house drawing (i.e. velocity 27.6(5.5) mm/s 

basal,  30.9(7.1) mm/s with O2 ,mean(SD), p<0.025, Wilcoxon test). The drawing time 'down' or 

fraction time the pen is touching the paper during the drawing phase decreased (i.e. time 

down 20.7(6.6) s basal , 17.4(6.3) s with O2 , p<0.017, Wilcoxon test).  

Conclusions:  This study shows that in patients with chronic hypoxemia, a short period of 

oxygen therapy produces changes in psychomotor  function that can be measured by means of 

drawing analysis.

BACKGROUND 

Chronic hypoxemia has deleterious effects in neuro-psychological and muscle function, 

with consequences in absent mindedness, perception, and realization of  motor tasks [1]. 

These cognitive and motor function consequences can affect both daily life and relationships 

with surroundings. The underlying causes of cognitive and motor effects due to chronic 

hypoxia are a state of chronic systemic inflammation accompanied by oxidative stress directly 

affecting  the neurons, with an increase in neurotransmitters. We posit that oxygen therapy 

would increase the concentration of oxygen at the brain, which should improve the 

physiological state of the areas related to cognition. 

There are no clear results regarding the effect of low concentrations of O2 on   

cognitive state in hypoxemic patients. Some studies did not report any effects and others 

described positive ones [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Pretto et al showed that acute oxygen therapy did not  

improve cognitive and driving performance in chronic hypoxemic pulmonary obstructive 

disease  patients (COPD) [6]. Conversely, regular use of supplemental oxygen therapy 

decreased the risk for cognitive impairment in patients with COPD [1]. It is probable that the 

difference among these results is due to the fact that tests are not completely sensitive to O2 

changes, or are dependent on disease severity [7]. There is however unanimity regarding  their 

effect on the improvement of life expectancy or on variables such as the 6 minute walking test, 

red cell number or arterial lung pressures [8,9,10] . On the other hand, hypoxemic COPD seems 

to have a cognitive impairment profile different from that of normal and demented subjects, 

with verbal memory and praxic/executive function being the most affected, as shown by 

Antonelli et al [7,1]. The aim of this study was to propose a method that can be done in the 

patient’s home, does not require specialized health technical support and reflects  the fine 

motor brain control [11].

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Eight patients (7/1 M/F), who had hypoxemia more than five years participated in the 

drawing task study. All had completed primary education and were in a stable condition. All 

studies were performed by the same physician. The study was conducted in the Respiratory 

Function Laboratory at Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital (HUGTIP), and approved by the 

Human Research and Ethics Committee of the hospital. All participants gave written informed 

consent as required by the Institutional Review Board, following the World Medical 

Association’s Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human 

Subjects.  

Participants were without any diagnosis of writer’s cramp. The exclusion criteria were:  

current smoking habit, high caffeine consumption, hand tremor, neurologic, rheumatic or 

endocrine diseases and history of drug or alcohol abuse, as well as central nervous system or 

psychiatric disorders. Neurology and psychiatric disorders were discharged by respective 

departments.  

At baseline, lung function was measured by spirometry (Hyp’Air Compact, Medisoft). 

Measurements were obtained in accordance with the established guidelines and results 

compared to normative data [12,13].. Arterial radial gasometry was measured by means of a 

Gen Premier 3000 analyzer (MedWrench. Bedford Massachusetts. USA) at basal and after 30 

min. with O2 at 3 l/min by nasal plugs. 

 

Drawing analysis was made using a digitizing tablet with an ink pen (Wacom Co, 

Intuos4,US). All drawing tasks were performed on A4 size liner paper attached to the tablet 

surface. The drawing tasks reflected perceptual-motor complex functions and cognitive 

aspects that appear when copying a new figure never seen before. A total of 2 exercises were 



 6 

carried out, repeating them three times before and after 30 minutes with nasal O2 at 3 l/min, 

continuing with O2 administration during the second part of the test. A complete test session 

took two and a half hours, and was performed between 09:00 - 11:30 AM.  Researchers asked 

patients to perform drawing tasks: two pictures (a house, a clock). A thirty second interval was 

given between the single trials.  

 

The digitizing tablet acquires 200 samples per second, including the spatial coordinates 

(x,y), the pressure, altitude and azimuth [14]. The digitizer provides accurate measurement 

when the pen is touching the tablet and when it is lifted 6 mm above the digitizer [15].  

 

The analyzed parameters were: pressure, mean velocity, acceleration, time down, time 

up, entropy, first and second derivatives of pressure and entropy.  Mean speed was calculated 

as positional coordinate x and y derivatives, with respect to time according to:   

  

Where x and y are the spatial coordinates of object drawing. 

Time down is the time when the pen rests touches on the tablet and time up is the 

time with the pen off the tablet. 

Mean pressure was measured towards the writing surface in continuous non-scaled 

units from 0-2047 [16]. 

 Entropy H(X) was calculated considering that the random variable X consists of several 

events, which occur with probability p(x) and can be calculated according to the equation [17]: 



 7 

    

In the present study, entropy was calculated for the first and second derivative of 

pressure. Entropy measures the information contained in a signal. Thus, entropy of pressure is 

the information content of the pressure profile executed by the drawer and is measured in bit 

units, after applying log2. 

Statistical analysis: 

Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, 95% of confidence interval, intra-

subject coefficient of variation), were used to describe the variables. Non parametric tests for 

paired data were applied (Wilcoxon matched pair test and Friedman ANOVA). For comparisons, 

a probability less than 0.05 was considered as significant.

RESULTS 

 

Table 1 shows anthropometric, demographic and spirometric characteristics of 

hypoxemic patients. Mean age was 69.5(9.9) yrs, mean height was 164.1 (8.11) cm, and mean 

body max index (BMI) 24.9(4.1) kg/m2. All patients were ex-smokers with a mean of 30 

packs/year, except for the woman who never smoked. All patients had a moderate-severe 

airway obstruction except for the female who was affected by an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 

and patient three who had undergone a thoracoplasty. Patient eight had also undergone a left 

pneumonectomy for non small cell lung cancer. Spirometric parameters showed an obstructive 

airway disease characteristic of  COPD except for patient 3. COPD, idiopatic pulmonary fibrosis 

and thoracoplasty are chronic respiratory diseases. These patients developed periodic controls 

in the consult of pulmonary department and it is usually to practice spirometric and 

gasometric tests as a  clinical control measure.  

Arterial blood gases are expressed in Table 2.  After 30 minutes breathing O2 with nasal 

plugs ,there was a mean increment of  arterial PaO2  of 31.9 mmHg and 1.2 mmHg of  Pa CO2.  

 Tables 3 and 4 show the results of Kinematic parameters measured by two picture 

tests: the house and the clock. Velocity and acceleration for the house picture increased with 

O2 . There were no significant changes of these parameters for the clock picture test. Hand 

pressures for house and clock did not significantly change with O2. Entropy for first and second 

derivatives of pressure increased with O2 therapy in both picture tests.   Time down decreased 

with O2 with respect to basal values for the house test, while time down and time up 

decreased for the clock test.  



 9 

 An ANOVA non-parametric Friedman test was applied to determine if there was a 

learning factor between the basal tree test of basal registered. Neither drawing showed 

significant differences for these variables, except for time down of clock picture (p<0.03).

DISCUSSION 

In this work we studied the short term effects of oxygen-therapy in the psychomotor 

state of a group of patients with chronic hypoxemia by means of drawing analysis. Kinematic 

parameters such as velocity, acceleration and drawing time improved after 30 minutes of 

nasal O2.  

 Krop HD et al was the first to observe the effect of 24 hr treatment O2 in COPD with 

hypoxemia. After 1 month the patients improved motor and perceptive functions, as well as  

memory functions. Cognitive flexibility, motor operations and an increase of grip force are 

some of the changes that take place after treatment [4,18].  In other studies that used brief 

periods of O2 (20 minutes/6h), the authors did not find significant cognitive changes or motor 

driving performance improvement [19,6]. These studies indicate than the effect of O2 has 

been demonstrated in the half and long term, but not in the short term.  In our study, time 

down, or pen time spent on the tablet and time up, or time with the pen off the tablet, 

decreased during the drawing of clock and house pictures. Pictures are prolonged visu-

spacial tasks that need more time to develop. The shorter drawing time is an indirect 

measurement of decreased necessity for planning  drawing tasks, and consequently  more 

efficient drawing. 

 We did not observe changes in drawing pressure after inhalation of O2 with respect to 

basal in complex tasks, as is the case of picture drawings. We believe that a decrease in hand 

drawing time and kinematic variables without changes in hand pressure could be an indirect 

manifestation of an improving efficiency of hand drawing as a consequence of O2 inhalation. 

While the hand pressure is the same, the entropy which measures the complexity of the 

drawn picture  increases, indicating  that  subjects develop tasks with more precision using 

the same energy.

 We sought to explain the causes of improvement in psychomotor function after a short 

oxygen therapy in hypoxemic patients. Chronic hypoxemia involves motor skills, perceptual 

learning and problem solving, and along with memory are some of the altered functions [20]. 

These functions can improve, as occurs in patients with severe OSAS (Obstructive Sleep 

Apnea Syndrome) subjected to night hypoxia that present cognitive alterations in learning, 

memory and diurnal somnolence [21]. In these patients, treatment with oral appliance or 

CPAP improves these cognitive functions, suggesting a partial reversibility [22,23] . On the 

other hand, the alteration of writing can be reversible, as in the case of micrography, which 

appears after a stroke when it affects the basal ganglia, and disappears in several weeks. 

Parkinson’s, a disease characterized by bradykinesia, tremor, rigid muscle and postural 

imbalance, when treated with Levodopa, produces an improvement of the coordination, 

velocity and writing acceleration [24]. In consequence, other causes that affect writing and 

drawing, such as cellular neural hypoxia, could be partially reversible when we treat the 

hypoxemia. These changes can be apparent when examining kinematic variables of writing as 

in our case, where velocity and acceleration drawing decreased with O2 [25]. For example, 

substances such as caffeine improve the fluency of handwriting movements and also increase 

maximum velocity and maximum positive and negative accelerations [26,3,27]. Other 

substances like nicotine can enhance psychomotor performance of motor tasks to a 

significant degree [28]. 

In consequence, it seems logical to conclude that a short O2 administration in 

hypoxemic patients could improve the cortical motor function areas.  These areas are 

constituted by: primary motor area (area-4) that controls  writing pressure, the 

supplementary motor area (SMA, area-5) responsible for writing planned movement, and the 

pre-motor area (area-6) which acts as a visual guide, regulating  time and  distance. In 



 12 

addition, the prefrontal area, fundamental in decision taking, is activated when the subject 

pays attention during the realization of visual and emotional cognitive complex tasks [29]. 

This area is broadly connected with temporal and inferior parietal cortex, specialized 

respectively in visual information (shape, size and color) and space localization. Left parietal 

area recalls graphic images of letters [29]. This area is affected in chronic hypoxia and is 

related to a reduction of acetyl choline transferase in the same way as the hippocampus and 

cerebellum, which are the most sensitive areas to hypoxia [30,31]. Basal gangly is 

fundamental in the brain control of fine movement. The damage of direct and indirect 

striate-palide ways leads to disordered writing and hippocampus that are related with striate  

and affected by chronic hypoxia [31,32]. The cerebellum, also affected during the chronic 

hypoxia, provides the position at the beginning of initiation of hand movements, essential to 

calculate the time that is needed to execute hand movement. An additional function that can 

be affected by hypoxia is the hand movement coordination, when comparing the current 

movement with the movement desired when writing. All these areas try to achieve a more 

efficient movement in complex tasks, as is the case of drawing pictures. 

Several issues related to methodology of the present paper must be addressed. First, 

the reduced group of patients has not permitted us to draw general conclusions. These 

patients had different respiratory diseases, including COPD in most cases.  Second, a high 

inter-subject variability in kinematic parameters could produce statistical biased results. 

Moreover, our study compared theses parameters in the same subject in two situations with 

and without external O2. To decrease the possible effect of intra-subject variability, tests 

were repeated three times before and during O2 administration, and the mean of three 

attempts to compare results was used.  We do not discard the likely existence of the learning 

factor. Repeating picture drawings could improve the drawing precision and in consequence 

produce changes   in the kinematic variables, but we only found basal significant changes in 

the time down of the clock picture. For that, we believe that the majority of kinematic 



 13 

variable changes were not caused by the learning effect. Furthermore, we did not carry out a 

third test for cleaned O2 for two reasons:  not knowing how long O2 cognitive effects last, and 

also taking into account that the procedure time could be excessively prolonged for patients. 

Four, in some patients O2 inhalation increased PaCO2 levels. Although this could be the cause 

of some drawing results, principally in drawing pressures, these changes occurred in all 

patients regardless of PaCO2. We did not include a healthy control group and compare it with 

hypoxemic patients, with limitations in performing two arterial punctures in healthy subjects 

being the reason.  We believe it to be unethical to provide therapy for those not requiring it. 

It seems probable that an excess of oxygen in healthy people will increase oxidation, aging, 

etc. 

Conclusion 

 In patients with chronic hypoxemia, a short period of oxygen therapy produces 

changes in psychomotor status that can be measured by means of drawing analysis. Changes 

in kinematic parameters demonstrated an improvement in drawing efficiency for complex 

tasks.  Drawing analysis could constitute a method to measure the psychomotor status in 

chronic respiratory patients treated with different therapies.
