Abstract

Background: There is a scarce number of studies on the cost of agitation and containment interventions and their
results are still inconclusive. We aimed to calculate the economic consequences of agitation events in an in-patient
psychiatric facility providing care for an urban catchment area.

Methods: A mixed approach combining secondary analysis of clinical databases, surveys and expert knowledge
was used to model the 2013 direct costs of agitation and containment events for adult inpatients with mental
disorders in an area of 640,572 adult inhabitants in South Barcelona (Spain). To calculate costs, a seven-step
methodology with novel definition of agitation was used along with a staff survey, a database of containment
events, and data on aggressive incidents. A micro-costing analysis of specific containment interventions was used
to estimate both prevalence and direct costs from the healthcare provider perspective, by means of a mixed
approach with a probabilistic model evaluated on real data. Due to the complex interaction of the multivariate
covariances, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to have empirical bounds of variability.

Results: During 2013, 918 patients were admitted to the Acute Inpatient Unit. Of these, 52.8% were men, with a
mean age of 44.6 years (SD = 15.5), 74.4% were compulsory admissions, 40.1% were diagnosed with schizophrenia
or non-affective psychosis, with a mean length of stay of 24.6 days (SD = 16.9). The annual estimate of total
agitation events was 508. The cost of containment interventions ranges from 282€ at the lowest level of agitation
to 822€ when verbal containment plus seclusion and restraint have to be used. The annual total cost of agitation
was 280,535€, representing 6.87% of the total costs of acute hospitalisation in the local area.

Conclusions: Agitation events are frequent and costly. Strategies to reduce their number and severity should be
implemented to reduce costs to the Health System and alleviate patient suffering.

Background
In spite of their overall impact on mental health care, we
know very little about the typology and the costs of agi-
tated behaviours and containment in acute mental health
care. Current estimates of the prevalence of agitation in
psychiatric inpatients oscillate between 10.5% [1] and 52%

[2], even though most of the studies only take aggression
into account [1, 3, 4] and no other agitated behaviours.
A recent systematic review concluded that agitation in

psychiatric wards is associated with longer length of stay,
higher readmission rates and increased medication con-
sumption [5]. In addition, containment measures have
also been shown to have a negative impact on patients
[6] and staff. Flood et al. [7] studied the economic con-
sequences of agitated behaviours and related contain-
ment interventions or coercive measures. The authors
used key staff interviews to estimate the resources that

were typically used to deal with incidents arising from
conflict and containment. Using a bottom-up approach,
they estimated that the annual cost of agitated behav-
iours was £72.6 million and 106 million for containment
intervention in the United Kingdom in 2005. More re-
cently, containment costs have been estimated in Spain
based on the standard time spent by health professionals
on containment measures according to one regional
guideline on containment measures and 7 hospital pro-
tocols on the same issue [8]. This top-down framing
analysis estimated the direct costs of psychiatric agita-
tion at 27 million € in Spain in 2014.
A series of factors may explain the existing dearth of

information on this topic. First, there is a lack of inter-
national consensus on the taxonomy and staging of agi-
tation. The listing of agitated behaviours varies across
studies, types of disorders and assessment instruments,
making this an area of research prone to information
bias. As an example, Flood et al. considered costs result-
ing from behaviours treated leniently such as smoking in
non-permitted areas or refusing to eat, drink, wash or
go to bed; alcohol abuse or drug abuse; attempts to ab-
scond or absconding, and other non-severe agitation
events [7]. Second, there is high variability in the infor-
mation on agitated behaviours reported by users, profes-
sionals and other carers [9]. Third, there is also
significant variability in clinical practice across settings
and countries [10, 11], as well as in the methods and
sources of information for registering activities and pro-
fessional time in hospital settings [12]. Frick et al. identi-
fied 10 distinct information sources for clinical activities
used in micro-costing studies, including: 1) administra-
tive databases at single facilities, 2) insurer administra-
tive data, 3) forms applied across multiple settings, 4) an
expert panel, 5) surveys or interviews conducted with
one or more types of providers; 6) review of patient
charts, 7) direct observation, 8) personal digital assistants,
9) programme operation logs, and 10) diary data [12].
In addition, we know very little about the costs of ac-

tivities performed by professionals in hospital wards in
local catchment areas. A description of the contacts with
staff in acute wards was recently reported in South
London [13]. This study found a strikingly low number
of contacts with highly qualified clinical staff during hos-
pitalisation (40% of the inpatients did not report any
contact with nurses). Even though the information was
based on patient reports and almost 40% of the patients
refused to participate in the study, this project highlights
the need for more research on care activities and inter-
ventions during hospitalisation in acute wards. Further-
more, there is no consensus on the typology of
containment interventions and not all containment in-
terventions are adequately registered. The EUNOMIA
project in Europe identified three major types of

containment interventions: restraint, seclusion, and
forced medication [10]. However, there are other con-
tainment interventions or measures that are very rele-
vant in agitation, such as verbal or psychological
containment [14]; and not all ad-hoc prescription of psy-
chotropic medication for agitation is forced. For in-
stance, the ad-hoc administration of anxiolytics or
sedatives may be voluntary, particularly in moderate agi-
tation states. Finally, containment and restraint measures
may be registered in separate databases and not coded
in the official listing of health interventions. As an ex-
ample, containment interventions are not included in the
preliminary version of the International Classification of
Health Interventions (ICHI) [15].
The scarce number of studies on the cost of agitation

and containment interventions and the inconclusive na-
ture of their results underline the need for new repre-
sentative studies of a catchment area for policy makers
and clinicians. The aim of this study is to estimate the
annual direct cost of agitation in adult psychiatric in-
patient care in a mental health catchment area of a pub-
lic Health Care System.

Methods
Design
An integrative cross-design synthesis bottom-up ap-
proach combining secondary analysis of local health da-
tabases (hospital records), surveys and expert knowledge
was used to model the annual direct costs of agitation
and containment for adult inpatients with mental disor-
ders in 2013 in a local catchment urban area [16]. In this
study, a micro-costing analysis of specific activities/
interventions related to containment of agitation was
performed from the healthcare provider perspective.
A conservative approach was followed and just the
direct costs of containment were taken into account
in the calculation.

Catchment area
The study was conducted at Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de
Déu (PSSJD) hospital, which is a large non-profit organisa-
tion providing mental health care to the adult population
in Catalonia (Spain). Spain offers universal access to public
health care organised by catchment areas. The catchment
areas are defined by care levels including primary care,
mental health specialised care, and acute hospital care
[17]. Additionally, sub-acute and chronic residential care
is provided in broader areas. Therefore, hospital admis-
sions with agitation episodes are representative of these
incidents in the reference catchment area.
In 2013, PSSJD delivered acute hospital care for a

population around 640,572 adult inhabitants distributed
across eight community mental health areas in the South
Barcelona health district (Castelldefels, Cornellà, El Prat,

Serrano-Blanco et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:212 Page 2 of 11



Esplugues, Garraf, Gavà, Poble Sec and Sants). The con-
text analysis and standard description of the care system
in this local area were described in the Atlas of Mental
Health in Catalonia (Spain) [18]. The acute inpatient
psychiatric unit at PSSJD has three wards with 69 beds.
The inpatient unit workforce comprises 8 psychiatrists,
17 nurses, 2 psychologists and 2 social workers. Six
nurses and three nursing assistants are present at the
acute unit during working hours. Care during non-
business hours is provided by one nurse and four nurs-
ing assistants plus a psychiatrist who is present at the
emergency service.
Apart from the standard quality and safety standards

applicable in Catalonia, a specific strategy to improve
health interventions in agitation and to minimise seclu-
sion and restraint in inpatient and emergency care was
started in PSSJD in 2009. It included a containment
protocol, regular clinical sessions, specific training of
clinical staff to incorporate de-escalation techniques and
an additional diary of containment interventions (DCI).

Sample characteristics
The study was carried out among adults admitted to the
three psychiatric acute wards in the local area. We used
patients’ electronic clinical records to obtain information
on social and demographic variables (age, gender, place
of birth) and clinical variables such as date of hospital
admission, compulsory admission, readmission in the
same reference year, discharge date, and main ICD-9
Chapter V diagnosis at discharge. In the reference year,
83.33% of the patients were admitted from the emer-
gency room and the other 16.67% were programmed ad-
missions from the eight community mental health
centres. In 2013, 235 (25.60%) patients were admitted
voluntarily, and 683 (74.40%) were non-voluntary
admissions.

Sources of information
Six distinct information sources were used to estimate
the total direct costs of agitation events in this study:
1) An expert panel consisting of two nominal groups
of professionals (psychiatrists and nurses) with wide
experience of acute care and containment: Group A
(10 psychiatrists) and Group B (7 nurses) [14]; 2) a
survey and individual interviews conducted with the
25 staff members (psychiatrists and nurses); 3) the
electronic medical record; 4) the ARDI: the annual
register of declared incidents (a formal declaration
form for the PSSJD Quality and Safety department);
5) a manual review of the clinical charts; and 6) the
DCI: daily, the nursing team registered the number of
agitated patients in seclusion and/or restraint (DCI
does not record the number of events of agitation per
patient during the same day).

Procedure
We followed a multistep process to obtain the cost of
agitation in hospital care in this local area (Additional
file 1 for detailed description of the methods).

Step 1: Development of a preliminary taxonomy of
agitation and containment interventions
This step included reaching consensus on the oper-
ational definition of agitation, listing of agitated behav-
iours in adult acute mental health care, types of
agitation states and clinical staging [14]. The clinical
states of agitation introduced in Rubio-Valera et al. are
considered. They are described as a continuum from a
mild initial state (anxiety and irritability), to moderate
(sub-agitation or moderate agitation without aggressive-
ness) and, finally, a severe state of agitation with aggres-
siveness and/or violence to objects, or aggressiveness
and/or violence to people.
In addition, the levels of containment interventions

according to care intensity were also described [14]. In
this work, an additional conceptual frame defining the
main intervention packages is introduced. A socio-
constructivist approach was followed to obtain a prag-
matic typology [19] of agitation following the results
produced by the two independent nominal groups
(psychiatrists and nurses). The states of agitation consid-
ered are Agitation with anxiety and irritability (AAI),
Moderate agitation (MA), Agitation with aggression
against objects (AAO) and agitation with aggression
against persons (AAP).
These states of agitation can appear isolated or not

along time. In this study, two separate time-related prag-
matic categories of agitation and containment were iden-
tified: “agitation event” (agitation associated with a
containment measure with a period of at least two hours
to another agitation event), and “agitation episode” (all
agitation events related to containment measures in the
same day).
For every state of agitation presented by the patient,

three levels of intervention according to containment in-
tensity were defined: 1) Verbal or psychological contain-
ment, 2) Seclusion or social/environmental restraint, and
3) Physical restraint. Two additional qualifiers were pro-
vided: a) ad-hoc medication (no medication, voluntary
and forced medication); and b) type of surveillance re-
quired (intermittent or continuous).
Levels of intervention are combined in intervention

packages or intervention lines: the first line approach is
verbal or psychological containment (L1), used on every
agitated patient. If the first line approach is not effective,
the second line approach (L2), adds seclusion or social/
environmental restraint to the first line and if it is also
ineffective, a third line approach (L3), including physical
restraint, could be used to end the event. Surveillance

Serrano-Blanco et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:212 Page 3 of 11



(intermittent or continuous) is performed by nursing
staff in all cases. Ad-hoc pharmacological treatment
could also be offered at any level if it is prescribed by a
psychiatrist. Thus, three lines of intervention are consid-
ered: L1: verbal containment (VC) and surveillance (S),
L2: VC + seclusion (SC) + S, and L3: VC + SC + restraint
(R) + S; all intervention types could be delivered with
ad-hoc medication when needed.

Step 2: Getting information about containment measures
and aggressions from hospital records
Daily, nursing staff records the number of patients who
need seclusion and/or restraint as a treatment for agi-
tated behaviours (i.e., number of agitation episodes
treated with seclusion or restraint). This DCI provides a
lower bound for the real number of seclusions and/or
restraints per year, since in the same episode a patient
might require more than one seclusion or restraint ac-
cording to the number of single events contained in the
episode.
By convention, when a patient is registered as secluded

in the DCI, it means that it went no further and restraint
was not applied. This means that the number of seclu-
sions and restraints registered correspond to mutually
exclusive situations. Thus, finding “seclusion” in the DCI
means in fact that intervention line 2 has been applied
to the patient, whereas finding “restraint” means applica-
tion of intervention line 3.
On the other hand, the hospital maintains an annual

register of declared incidents (ARDI, a declaration form
for the Quality and Safety Department of the parent
Health Maintenance Organisation, PSSJD) which, among
other data, registers the number of aggressions towards
staff, other patients or self-harm. The Quality and Safety
department analyses aggressions against staff and ex-
tracts specific figures indicating the interventions ap-
plied in each case, reported in the annual register of
aggressions against staff. From this information (assum-
ing that the probabilities of using the different interven-
tion approaches do not change when the aggression is
against staff or against another patient), the probabilities
of solving an aggression against persons with an inter-
vention approach of each type can be derived by using
basic probability properties, like conditional probability
law. These probabilities can later be used to estimate the
number of events for the different states of agitation and
the resources devoted to them in the various scenarios.

Step 3: Getting information from involved professionals
Computing costs will basically require information about
the number of events of each type occurred and the re-
sources used to solve each. A survey of 25 clinical ex-
perts and face-to-face meetings with a reduced number
of experts (core working group) was used to obtain

information about the health care resources used in each
type of agitation state. Seventeen nurses and eight psy-
chiatrists responsible for organising, prescribing and per-
forming containment activities were asked to provide
details on the use of certain interventions when dealing
with a particular agitation event: preparation required,
staff involved, materials for each intervention provided,
proportion of patients for which ad-hoc medication is
needed, and time required for the different activities. For
each parameter, the mean percentage from all profes-
sionals interviewed was used as an estimate of the corre-
sponding probability of applying an intervention
measure to a certain state of agitation.
The core working group was formed by two clinical

experts: the Clinical Head of the Inpatient Unit and the
nursing supervisor from the same unit. Both developed
the containment protocol at PSSJD, and the latter is
teacher of containment courses for all new psychiatric
nursing staff working at PSSJD.

Step 4: Computing the number of agitation events
Taking into account the information provided by hospital
databases (step 2), the survey described in step 3, and
some basic properties of probability laws (Conditional
probability law, Total probability law) we were able to
build a complex equation system (see annex for technical
details) that allowed to calculate the number of events of
each type of agitation solved with an intervention line (L1,
L2 or L3).

Step 5: Computing unit costs per agitation type and
intervention line
The cost of one agitation event of a certain type that
was solved with a certain intervention line is obtained by
adding the unit cost of all containment measures in-
cluded in the intervention line for that type of agitation.
It is important here to remark that the containment
measures have different costs depending on the agitation
state of the patient (this means that verbal containment
require more time in an aggression against objects that
in a moderate agitation and so far). The PSSJD analytic
accounting system was used to calculate the cost per mi-
nute of various staff members (psychiatrists [2.97 €/min
in face-to-face interventions], nurses [1.26 €/min in
face-to-face interventions]) in the reference year. For
each type of professional, the costs of the set of inter-
vention activities delivered to the patient to the conclu-
sion of the agitation event is counted, including
prescription or administration of pharmacological treat-
ment and surveillance.

Step 6: Calculating the total cost of agitation
In previous step, the cost of applying a certain interven-
tion line to treat one event of a certain agitation state is

Serrano-Blanco et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:212 Page 4 of 11



obtained. In step 4, the number of events of each agita-
tion state treated with each intervention line is com-
puted. Calculating the total cost of agitation for the
hospital involves summing the costs of all agitation types
per intervention line, by weighting each cost by the
number of events occurred. This is, in fact, combining
data from steps 4 and 5 to obtain the final costs of each
agitation type and intervention line leads to the final
evaluation of the total yearly costs of agitation.

Step 7: Sensitivity analysis
Since the analytical computation of the variance of the
costs is extremely complex in this context, a sensitivity
analysis is performed to evaluate the variability of the es-
timated costs with respect of the hypothesis of the
model. In fact, the modelization of costs presented be-
fore, establishes only two hypotheses:

� The figures given in the DCI are the lower limit of
the real number of restraints and seclusions,
provided that in a single episode, several events
might occur.

� The number of aggressions against persons (staff or
other patients) is a percentage of the total number
of agitation events in the hospital.

The sensitivity analyses consists in recomputing all
costs by introducing changes in two parameters asso-
ciated to these hypothesis: the percentage of agita-
tions that include aggressiveness and/or violence to
people (p) and the number of events included in a
single agitation episode (q). A simulation has been
run by moving p and q in a grid where p moves from
0 to 1 in steps of 0.00125 and q moves from 1 to 5
in steps of 0.1. For each pair (p,q), a total number of
events and cost was obtained, generating a response
surface that permit evaluation of the impact of p and
q on number of events and costs of each type of agi-
tation and intervention line.
The costs computed for every pair (p,q) provide a ref-

erence distribution of the costs, that theoretically ap-
proaches the real costs, and they were used to estimate
expectation and variance of the cost, so empirical
bounds of variability can be provided.

Results
During 2013, 808 patients were admitted to the PSSJD
Acute Inpatient Unit generating a total of 918 admis-
sions. Patients’ main social and demographic characteris-
tics are presented in Table 1.
The total number of admissions attended at PSSJD

Acute Inpatient Units was 918, with a total 22,550 of
patient-bed-days. The median length of stay was
21.79 days (mean 24.56 days, SD = 16.88, minimum

1 day, maximum 129 days), with 28.31% of the dis-
charges after 30 days.
In 2013, the DCI registered 245 restraints and 155 se-

clusion episodes.
ARDI showed 63 aggressions against persons, of which

24 were physical aggressions against professionals. It also
listed the interventions by line: 2 only required verbal con-
tainment (intervention approach L1); 15 required verbal
containment plus seclusion (intervention approach L2);

and 7 required verbal containment plus seclusion and re-
straint (intervention approach L3).
Table 2 was obtained from the survey and ARDI data.
The number of events in 2013 per agitation state and

intervention line required to solve the event is shown in
Table 3. Assuming that total aggressions towards per-
sons represents 12.4% of the total number of agitation
events occurring in the hospital, it means that the lower
limit of the estimated total agitation events in hospital is
508 agitation events (352 associated with aggression). Of
these, 104 were anxiety and irritability events; 52 events
of moderate agitation without aggressiveness, 289 events
of aggressiveness and/or violence to objects and 63
events of aggressiveness and/or violence to people.
Table 4 shows the unitary cost per single event of agi-

tation state and intervention line applied until the agita-
tion event has been effectively solved. Every intervention
line (L1, L2, L3) includes the cost of all containment
measures used (verbal containment, seclusion, restraint,
surveillance), ad-hoc medication by nursing staff and
psychiatrists, according to what was detailed in Step 5 of
methodology. The lowest unit cost per action delivered
in each containment strategy was 90.82€ related to ver-
bal containment in aggressiveness and/or violence to
people while the highest unit cost was related to
AGGRESSIVENESS AND/OR VIOLENCE TO OBJECTS
when restraint is applied after verbal containment and se-
clusion was not enough to solve the episode (288.18€)
(Table 4).
The total direct costs for each agitation state and

intervention type are shown in Table 5, with the lowest
related to moderate agitation without aggressiveness
(20,088.12€) and the highest related to aggressiveness
and/or violence to objects (181,095.85€). The estimated
total annual cost of agitation was 280,535.00 € for in-
patient care in the local catchment area.

Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis evaluating the impact of the as-
sumptions made in the model presented below was con-
ducted, according to the procedure explained in the 7th
step of the methodology (Table 6).
As a first result, the space of feasible solutions

moves with p in [0.042, 0.12630] and q between 1
and 2.45, as out of this region, some of the cells
counting the number of events become negative,
which makes no sense. This means that aggression
against persons takes place in between 4.2% and
12.6% of total agitation events at the hospital, and
that no more than 3 agitation events occur in the
same agitation episode.
The number of agitation events ranges from 499 to

1482 but more than 50% of the simulations reported
fewer than 855 events per year in the hospital (as pre-
dicted by the lower limits used in the above computa-
tions, the 508 total events found are near the minimum,
corresponding to a situation where an episode involves a
single event).
The average total costs of agitation observed were

500,400€ (SD = 166,216.60€), ranging between 278,500€
(corresponding to the case where a single event occurs
in each episode and the number of aggressions against
persons are 12.63% of the total number of agitations)
and 832,900€ (when three events are involved in each
episode and aggressions against persons are 0.42% of the
total number of agitations). As expected, computations
were performed assuming that the number of restraints
and the number of seclusions are as registered in the
DCI, i.e., costs are near the minimum expected, when an
agitation episode involves a single restraint or a single
seclusion.
Presentation of these results in a graph can be seen in

Figure S1 (Additional file 1).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that estimates
the annual direct cost of agitation and its containment
strategies with respect to acute psychiatric inpatients fol-
lowing a cross-design synthesis approach in a local
catchment area. The methodology in this study was pre-
viously used to calculate the costs of depression and bor-
derline personality disorders [16, 20]. We used staff
interview information but also data sourced from other
databases (clinical and managerial). Summarising, the
total annual direct health care costs of psychiatric treat-
ment for agitated inpatients in an area of 640,572 adult
inhabitants rises to 280,535.00 €. These agitation costs
represent 6.87% of the total costs of acute hospitalisation
in the local catchment area.
As far as we know, only two studies provide informa-

tion on the costs of agitation and containment interven-
tions in psychiatric inpatients [7, 8]. Flood et al. reported
the costs in England using, in a bottom-up approach,
data extracted from interviews with clinical staff at 128
wards in England. These results were later extrapolated
to the country level (59.99 million inhabitants at the
time the study was conducted). In England, the total
costs of conflict and containment in adult acute psychi-
atric inpatient wards were £72,588,694 for conflict and
£106,157,997 for all containment strategies. They stated
that the most expensive conflict behaviour to manage
was verbal abuse at a total cost of £10.5 million. Differ-
ences between Flood’s results and ours may have several
explanations. First, unit costs for each case of conflict
behaviour were higher than ours. Second, the prevalence

of agitation events could differ between England and
Spain due to inpatient factors such as gender, age, type
of admission (voluntary or involuntary), diagnostics, and
other socioeconomic characteristics [21]. Third, English
acute inpatient wards and ours may not have the same
health structure and procedures for dealing with agita-
tion events [22]. Fourth, Flood et al. included in their
agitation event definition several negative behaviours
such as smoking in non-permitted areas, refusing to eat,
to wash, to get up, or to see staff, that we have not con-
sidered as agitation events. Finally, they also included
absconding and its administrative consequences, refus-
ing regular or PRN meds. We did not include these be-
haviours as agitation events as they could be managed as
part of the normal functioning of the psychiatrists’ or
nursing staff ’s clinical work.
Garrido et al. determined the direct medical costs at-

tributable to psychiatric mechanical restraint in agitation
episodes related to patients suffering from schizophrenia
or bipolar disorder in Spain. Three sources of informa-
tion were consulted in their top-down approach: eight
published protocols on restraint techniques in Spain; re-
gional unit costs of health care services; and national epi-
demiological data on the prevalence of schizophrenia and
bipolar disorders. They estimated that the direct costs of
a restraint episode ranged from 513 to 1160€ (4–12 h per
episode duration, respectively). Total annual costs of psy-
chiatric mechanical restraint were estimated at 27 million
€ in 2014, considering a duration of 4 h per episode. Al-
though our cost per episode of mechanical restraint is
lower than that obtained by Garrido et al., we found that

before mechanical restraint is applied, other conten-
tion techniques were implemented, and these costs
should be taken into account when the cost of agita-
tion and containment is calculated. Other differences
between the Garrido et al. study and ours could be
highlighted, such as the use of a top-down approach
that could overestimate costs and only including agi-
tation episodes related to two mental disorders while
we included all agitation episodes regardless of cause.
They also included the costs of emergency services
while we did not and that could lead us to underesti-
mate our costs.
Regarding contention measures, we found that for

those used in AAI, costs ranged from 282 to 392€ per
episode due to the length of time and staff required, for
moderate agitation without aggressiveness costs were
327 to 431€, for aggressiveness and/or violence to ob-
jects costs were 422 to 789€, and for aggressiveness and/
or violence to people costs ranged from 398 to 822€.
Costs associated with aggressiveness and/or violence to
objects were higher than those for aggressiveness and/or
violence to people due to the greater time required to
apply verbal containment and seclusion. Although
mechanical restraint was more expensive in aggressive-
ness and/or violence to people, this difference did not
cancel out the previous one. This is related to which
type of intervention can solve the episode, and how
many interventions are needed. These results highlight
the need for effective low intensity interventions such as
verbal containment to prevent severe agitation states
that not only cost more but are also associated with
worse patient and staff experiences. In our experience,
verbal containment is a vital tool, and de-escalation
techniques could help clinicians to prevent aggres-
sions [23]. However, verbal containment may require

administration of ad-hoc medication, and various options
are available. These include oral, inhaled or intramuscu-
lar antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines [24]. Again,
de-escalation techniques suggest that patients should
participate in the choice of psychopharmacological treat-
ment. In our experience, this is highly relevant. Including
voluntarily ad-hoc medication could help to end an agita-
tion episode without seclusion or restraint, and that
could help to save costs. In line with this, non-invasive
medication with rapid onset such as inhaled loxapine has
been reported as an effective intervention [25]. In some
events, verbal containment is not enough to solve the
episode, and seclusion is necessary. In the opinion of
the experts consulted in this study, seclusion could be
offered to the patient and accepted voluntarily. Again,
if patients accept, seclusion could help them to regain
control and could be experienced as a helpful inter-
vention, not as a forced containment measure. But it
has to be as short as possible, and less than three
hours to prevent self-harm [26]. Ad-hoc medication
could be used, as in verbal containment. The last
step, and only when verbal containment and seclusion
has failed, is mechanical restraint. Again, in our ex-
perience, this has to be as short as possible, and al-
ways with ad-hoc medication to help regain control
and return to the ward.
This step care approach could also be improved when

risk evaluation is routinely implemented [27, 28] and
preventive strategies are employed during the initial days
of the inpatient stay. These include effective measures
such as specific staff training in de-escalation techniques,
increasing voluntary and/or non-urgent admissions, archi-
tectural design of psychiatric wards, strategies to improve
patient-staff relationship, and/or pharmacological inter-
ventions [29, 30].

Limitations
The results of our study should be taken with caution.
First, the preliminary typology of agitation and contain-
ment interventions [14] has not been used by other hos-
pitals or health districts. As stated before, the list of
problem behaviours related to agitation identified in this
project differs from the listings used in other studies [7];
and the containment or coercive measures identified,
which include verbal containment and ad-hoc medica-
tion not limited to forced drug administration, differ
from those established by other groups which were lim-
ited to seclusion, constraint and forced medication [11].
In any case, the preliminary taxonomy of agitation states
was developed following a qualitative approach and is in
line with several containment protocols available in
Spain [8].
Second, this study is limited to a health district in a

metropolitan area in South Barcelona. Therefore our
local findings cannot be generalised to the macro level.
Furthermore, a specific strategy to improve practice in
the management of agitation was implemented in the
area and specifically in our hospital since 2009. This de-
creases the generalizability the results and representa-
tiveness of the catchment area further and limits
comparisons with other health areas. The extrapolation
of our estimates to Catalonia is solely intended for the
framing of scientific knowledge in an area of research
where very little evidence is currently available [31]. It is
noteworthy that the service availability, placement cap-
acity and workforce capacity of the local mental health
system in the catchment area were mapped before all
other catchment areas in Catalonia and this information
is publicly available [18]; as well as the spatial analysis of
administrative prevalence of mental disorders [32] and
the relative efficiency of the small mental health areas in
this metropolitan area [33]. The longitudinal data on ser-
vice availability, placement capacity, workforce capacity,
the geographical analysis and the relative efficiency ana-
lysis of its urban mental health system make metropol-
itan Barcelona a unique case for evidence-informed
mental health care and improve the framework for the
analysis of specific issues in health care, such as local
hospital costs of agitation.
Third, there are significant disparities in the informa-

tion provided by different sources and information gaps
with regard to the number of agitation events. To over-
come these problems, we used six different sources of
information out of the ten described by Frick [12] in
micro-costing studies and triangulated the information
to estimate the hospital/administrative prevalence of the
various agitation states and their associated containment
strategies.
Fourth, we followed a conservative approach, taking

only the base-line costs of agitation and containment

into consideration and limiting our cost analysis to the
activities directly linked to agitation events and their
containment interventions. We provide average esti-
mates of time consumed by every intervention but not
the actual time spent on their provision in every event.
We have included this tentative source of error in the
sensitivity analysis. On the other hand, we have not in-
cluded other hospital costs related to agitation such as
the cost of ad-hoc medication, laboratory testing, use of
other services by persons who suffer an aggression, in-
direct costs related to loss of productivity of the
personnel who suffer an aggression, legal costs related to
aggression events, etc. It is important to note that agi-
tated patients use higher doses of medication and a
greater number of psychotropic drugs during their ad-
mission [34]. As stated by Compton [35], agitated pa-
tients also have an increased length of stay of 1.45 days
(IC95% 1.21–1.73). Aggression can also increase the like-
lihood of readmission although these results are still
controversial [36]. We have not included the long-term
costs of inpatients with agitation episodes versus those
patients who did not experience them.
This study uses a novel typology of agitation states

and related containment interventions and applies it to
the secondary analysis of a hospital administrative data
set together with several other sources of information,
including expert knowledge, to provide estimates and as-
sumptions and to model the direct costs of agitation
under conditions of uncertainty. This is a “framing of
scientific knowledge” (FSK) study where prior expert
knowledge and/or a literature review play a relevant role
in cost calculation and modelling [31]. This type of study
should be clearly differentiated from actual evidence-
based studies (cost-of-illness analysis based on accurate
information on prevalence, and activities and interven-
tions performed in representative samples in identified
catchment areas using highly reliable databases).
Estimate-based studies should be performed when there
is a lack of information or when there are significant
levels of uncertainty in the information available.

Conclusion
Agitation is common and distinct interventions can be
delivered to minimise its consequences. Verbal contain-
ment and rapid onset ad-hoc medication are the first
steps to prevent severe agitations and costly interven-
tions such as seclusion and/or restraint. In spite of the
extant difficulties in the analysis of the costs of agitation
events in hospital settings, our study highlights the rele-
vance of this component of direct hospital costs that
may account for over 6% of the acute hospitalisation
costs of mental disorders. Studies at regional or national
macro-level on the costs of agitation are urgently
needed. The information provided here should be

contextualised within a broader area of research that en-
compasses the description, comparison and micro-
costing of activities for mental health patients in acute
hospital settings.
