Abstract

Background: Patients affected by mild stroke benefit more from physiological overground walking training than
walking-like training performed in place using specific devices. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of
overground robotic walking training performed with the servo-assistive robotic rollator (i-Walker) on walking, balance,
gait stability and falls in a community setting in patients with mild subacute stroke.

Methods: Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to two different groups that received the same therapy in two
daily 40-min sessions 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Twenty sessions of standard therapy were performed by both groups.
In the other 20 sessions the subjects enrolled in the i-Walker-Group (iWG) performed with the i-Walker and the
Control-Group patients (CG) performed the same amount of conventional walking oriented therapy. Clinical and
instrumented gait assessments were made pre- and post-treatment. The follow-up observation consisted of recording
the number of fallers in the community setting after 6 months.

Results: Treatment effectiveness was higher in the iWG group in terms of balance improvement (Tinetti: 68.4 ± 27.6 %
vs. 48.1 ± 33.9 %, p = 0.033) and 10-m and 6-min timed walking tests (significant interaction between group and time:
F(1,40) = 14.252, p = 0.001; and F(1,40) = 7.883, p = 0.008, respectively). When measured, latero-lateral upper body
accelerations were reduced in iWG (F = 4.727, p = 0.036), suggesting increased gait stability, which was supported
by a reduced number of falls at home.

Conclusions: A robotic servo-assisted i-Walker improved walking performance and balance in patients affected
by mild/moderate stroke, leading to increased gait stability and reduced falls in the community.

Trial registration: This study was registered on anzctr.org.au (July 1, 2015; ACTRN12615000681550).

Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of severe disability in
the Western world [1]. One crucial goal in rehabilitating
patients affected by stroke is to restore mobility so that
patients can regain independent living and walking [2].
Up to 88 % of people affected by stroke experience

hemiparesis with gait and balance disorders that persist
even in the chronic phase [3, 4].
Most individuals who have suffered a stroke have asym-

metric posture with resultant balance and gait dysfunc-
tion. Consequently, their performance of the activities of
daily living is reduced [5] and they have an increased risk
of experiencing one or more falls [6]. In particular, balance
deficits in patients affected by stroke result from reduced
postural control [7] and less coordinated responses to
both self-induced and external balance perturbations [6].
Thus, restoring autonomous gait and recovering balance

are challenges in the rehabilitation of patients with stroke
[8]. Interventions aimed at overcoming gait and balance
deficits should increase patients’ independence in the ac-
tivities of daily living and help prevent falls.
Repetitive task-specific exercise programs have been

shown to be effective in reducing balance disorders and re-
storing gait [9]. Technology could improve these programs
and facilitate plasticity- related recovery by increasing sen-
sory feedback and supporting the motor system [10]. Much
of the current evidence supports body weight-supported
technological devices, either walking overground or on a
treadmill, to encourage upright postural control, normal
arm swing and optimal dynamic balance [11–13]. However,
contrasting results regarding robotic-assisted therapy have
recently been reported concerning their potential benefits
in balance and walking recovery in post-stroke patients
[14]. These contrasting results might be due to the differ-
ent severity of patients. Indeed, more severe stroke patients
might benefit more from robotic therapy due to their diffi-
culty in performing overground walking training [15, 16].
Conversely, less severely affected patients, who are able to
walk with little assistance, might benefit more from balance
and walking training on the floor with less constriction and
more physiological sensory motor feedback, i.e., in a chal-
lenging condition and in a context closer to that of daily
living. This hypothesis was supported by results of a large
randomized trial (LEAPS Study) in patients with stroke in
whom home exercises with a physiotherapist were more
effective in increasing balance and reducing falls than elec-
tromechanical locomotor training [17, 18]. In neurologic-
ally impaired populations overground walking training can
be performed using a walker to improve stability and in-
crease walking capacity. This simple, beneficial and eco-
nomic device may not be used appropriately to maximize
function due to severity of motor deficits that are strongly
asymmetric. In these patients a hemi-walker or quad cane
may be needed depending on the balance impairment [19].
Further, using assistive devices in the acute and sub-acute
stages of rehabilition following stroke is not supported in
the literature because these compensatory strategies might
limit neuroplasticity [20].
In this study, we set out to combine the promising ad-

vances in assistive technology [21] with physiological
training aimed at improving mobility and balance. To
accomplish this, we used a robotic device with embed-
ded intelligence, i.e., the i-Walker. The objective of this
device is to promote upright control and walking in
people with mild/moderate stroke. Furthermore, it can be
used either for training or as an assistive device. Other
advantages are related to the fact that the i-Walker is not
expensive or cumbersome and can easily be maneuvered
by an individual. The i-Walker has almost the same dimen-
sions as the rollator. It is, in fact, a robotic rollator (walker
with 4 wheels) that integrates sensors and actuators able to

provide asymmetrical assistance as needed during walking.
It uses a standard rollator frame modified for this purpose.
Actuators are two hub motors integrated in the rear wheels
and are used for braking or helping the user. Sensors are
arranged in the frame to detect forces, tilt and movement.
An integrated battery supplies power. Finally, a network of
distributed micro controllers drives the system and records
and provides information to the therapists. The i-Walker
passively detects the force imposed by the user on the han-
dles through its sensors; thus, it is possible to determine
and adjust the amount of help each motor should be giving
to the side with a deficit [22].
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate changes

in walking performance (i.e. gait velocity and gait capacity)
using the i-Walker with respect to conventional walking-
oriented therapy. The secondary aim was to study how
i-Walker training affects balance, stability of walking
and the incidence of falls in the community.

Methods
Participants
We considered for inclusion in this study consecutive
inpatients who had recently suffered strokes and had
been admitted to two different Neurorehabilitation Units
of Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS during their first three
weeks of hospitalization in the period between March
2012 and December 2013. The independent Ethical Board
of the Santa Lucia Foundation approved the study proto-
col (CE/AG4-PROG.101-135) and written informed con-
sent was obtained from each patient and/or a relative.
Inclusion criteria were: hemiparesis caused by a first-

ever unilateral stroke, subacute phase (<90 days from
stroke), age between 18 and 80 years, ability to perform
assisted walking training on the parallel bar (Functional
Ambulation Classification [23], FAC ≥ 2), presence of some
degree of muscular activity in each shoulder/elbow/hand
(Medical Research Council scale [24] MRC ≥ 3). Exclusion
criteria included: concomitant chronic disabling path-
ologies, severe spasticity (defined as score ≥4 for arm
or leg on the modified Ashworth Scale [25]), moderate/
severe cognitive decline (Mini-Mental State Estimation
[26], MMSE score < 24) and presence of severe hemispa-
tial neglect as evaluated by a neuropsychologist (i.e., pa-
tients needing rehabilitation for neglect were excluded).

Intervention
The trial was designed as a prospective randomized
controlled trial based on CONSORT guidelines. After
randomization, which was carried out using a random
computer-generated list, patients were consecutively
assigned to one of the two groups. Allocation was con-
cealed from both patients and physiotherapists; only a
non-clinical experimenter who was not involved in the
treatments had access to the randomized lists. All

patients received two daily 40-min sessions of therapy,
5 days a week for 4 weeks, in a one-one mode. The
control group (CG) performed 40 sessions of conven-
tional walking-oriented therapy. The first daily session
(i.e., 20 sessions, 40 min per session, 5 times a week for
4 weeks) consisted of overground training for ambula-
tion exercises on the parallel bars for control and
movement of the lower limb load, exercises for control
of the trunk and pelvis and walking exercises of in-
creasing difficulty on the ground. Help provided by the
therapists and aids (i.e. canes, tripods or walkers) was
allowed. The therapists decided which was the least re-
strictive assistive device and used it for gait training.
The second daily therapy session was focused on exer-
cises for hand recovery, tone control and improvement
of global ability.
The i-Walker group performed one daily conventional

walking training using a servo-assistive robotic walker
supervised by a physiotherapist (20 sessions, 40 min per
session), 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Similar to the con-
trol group, the patients’ second daily session of therapy
was focused on exercises for hand recovery, tone control
and improvement of global ability.

Assessment
The evaluations were made in three steps: (T0) pre-
treatment, corresponding to the time when the patient
began the walking training using the parallel bars (control
group) or with the i-Walker (experimental group); (T1)
post-treatment, corresponding to the end of the 4-week
walking training period; (T2) follow-up, corresponding to
the 6 months after T1 during which the number of falls
that occurred in the community was self-reported. All
subjects had the baseline ability of being able to walk in
inside the parallel bars. Once subjects had this ability, they
were included in the research protocol. In accordance
with the Prevention of Falls Network Europe, a fall was
defined as an unexpected event in which the subject
comes to rest on the ground, floor or his/her centre of
mass comes to a lower level [27].
A blinded assessor evaluated training efficacy out-

comes at T0 and T1. The primary outcome measure was
walking capacity measured by the Six-Minute Walk Test
(6MWT), [28] self-selected walking speed with the Ten
Meter Walk Test (10MWT) [29]. Secondary outcomes
included balance and gait assessment made using Tinet-
ti’s Scale [30], spasticity assessed with a modified version
of the Ashworth scale (sum of the six districts regarding
upper and lower limbs), global ability measured with the
Barthel Index (BI), [31] and global impairment assessed
with the Canadian Neurological scale.
Other secondary outcomes were measured using in-

strumented assessment of upright gait stability.

Upright gait stability has been defined as the capacity
to minimize upper body oscillations and absorb jerks,
bumps, shakes and fluctuations despite broad and fast
movements of the lower limbs during locomotion [32].
Hence, upright gait is stable when upper body accelera-
tions are minimized and smoothed. Accelerations were
measured while patients walked a short distance [33] in-
side or outside parallel bars. They were asked to stand
on a line marked on the floor and walk straight for 4 m
at a self-selected speed until they arrived at another line
on the floor. Tests were performed inside parallel bars
(with patients being able to touch the bars) or outside
them, i.e. during normal overground walking under the
strict supervision of the therapist (a light touch was
allowed). During the test, patients wore an elastic belt
that contained a wearable triaxial accelerometer placed
at the level of the L2/L3 spinous process and fixed with
an elastic band (FreeSense®, Sensorize s.r.l., Rome; sam-
pling frequency = 100 Hz, weight = 93 g) to measure ac-
celerations along the three body axes (antero-posterior,
AP; latero-lateral, LL; and cranio-caudal, CC). The accel-
erometric signals were analysed after their mean value
subtraction and after low-pass filtering at 20Hz, and
their root mean square (RMS) was computed. RMS is a
measure of acceleration dispersion (which coincides with
the standard deviation because of signal mean subtraction)
that provides information about upright gait instability. As
the RMS of acceleration is strictly dependent on walking
speed, we normalized the values of RMS-AP and RMS-LL
with respect to those of RMS-CC by using the inverse of
their percentage ratio as the indicator of stability, in ac-
cordance with previous studies of patients with stroke [33]
or other pathologies [34].

i-Walker
In Spain the i-Walker is registered as medical electrical
equipment (reg. number 477/13/EC). The i-Walker
was semi-industrial prototypes produced at Universitat
Politècnica de Catalunya, with partial UE funding and
purchased by the pilots. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the i-
Walker is a robotic rollator that integrates sensors and
actuators [35]. It uses a standard 4-wheeled Rollator
AD100 walker frame sized 500 mm (W) × 600 mm
(L) × 850 mm (H) modified for this purpose. Actuators
are two hub motors, 100 mm in diameter, that are in-
tegrated in the rear wheels and are used for braking or
helping the user. The device also has two modified han-
dlebars with brake handles and force measurement, 32
strain gauges mounted in 8 bridges to measure handlebar
forces and normal wheel forces, sensors arranged in the
frame to detect forces, tilt and movement and an inte-
grated battery that supplies power. The i-Walker detects
the force imposed by the user on the handles through its
sensors, so it is possible to determine and adjust the

amount of help that each motor should be giving to the
side with a deficit. The i-Walker provides no pulling
force, but only assists in pushing the device forward:
the i-Walker applies appropriate compensatory force
through its motors only when pushing forces are de-
tected through the handles. The amount of support
provided by the i-Walker is modifiable to allow thera-
pists to adjust support to maximize patients’ participa-
tion in walking.
The following services are provided by the i-Walker:

(i) active motor assistance to compensate for lack of
muscle force on climbs; (ii) active brake assistance to
compensate for lack of muscle force on descents; (iii)
active differential assistance to compensate for asym-
metric muscle force; (iv) recording of sensor measure-
ments and actuator activities for later evaluation.
In this study we focussed on point (iii), i.e. active

differential assistance to compensate for asymmetric
muscle force. During training the amount of assistance
(i.e. braking force in each hand) was reduced by the
team following this principle: (i) assistance as needed,
(ii) progressive assistance reduction, (iii) safety con-
cerns, (iv) patients’ ability to drive the device and (v)
affected leg and arm increase in spasticity.

Statistical analysis
As clinical scores are ordinal measures, they were treated
with non-parametric statistics using the Wilcoxon signed
ranks test for within group analyses and the Mann-
Whitney u-test for between group analyses. The sample
was selected in accordance with the criteria of previous
studies that analysed the use of robotic devices in walking
training [15, 36] and with a Phase 2, stage III motor inter-
vention [37]. Furthermore, improvements with respect to
the baseline were analysed in addition to the raw data.
Effectiveness of the intervention was computed for clinical
scale scores as the percentage of improvement made with
respect to the maximum achievable improvement, i.e.
(final score – initial score)/(maximum clinical scale
score – initial score) * 100 [38–41]. Percentage values
were treated as continuous measures and hence man-
aged with parametric statistics.
As instrumented timed walking tests and accelerometer

data were continuous measures, they were treated with
parametric statistics using mixed-model repeated measure
analysis of variance (RM-Anova) and Bonferroni correction
was applied for post-hoc analyses. For these variables, per-
centage improvement was evaluated as: (final measure –
initial measure)/initial measure * 100. For the 10MWT we
also computed the minimal clinical importance difference
(MCID) [42]. The odds ratio (OR) and relevant 95 % confi-
dence interval (CI95 %) were computed to determine how
many subjects achieved the MCID and to assess exposure
to the risk of falling in the two groups of patients. The stat-
istical significance of ORs was tested with the chi-squared
test. SPSS 17.0 was used for statistical analysis. The thresh-
old of significance was set at 0.05 for all tests.

Results
Between March 2012 and December 2013, 44 out of 160
screened patients were enrolled in the study; they were ran-
domly assigned to groups and evaluated. Two patients, one
in the iWG and one in the CG were dropped, as shown in
Fig. 2 (consort study flow chart). Demographic and clinical
characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1. The
two groups were not significantly different in terms of
demographic and clinical characteristics at T0, confirming
the similar deficits of the two groups at baseline.

Walking performance
An analysis of variance on performances at 10MWT
showed that both groups improved, but the iWG showed
a greater main within subject effect of time than the CG:
F(1,40) = 37.763, p < 0.001; significant interaction between
group and time: F(1,40) = 14.252, p = 0.001; main effect of
group: F(1,40) = 0.451, p = 0.506). In fact, the percentage
reduction of the time spent to complete the 10mWT was
44.8 ± 16.3 % in i-WG and 17.7 ± 13.2 % in CG (p < 0.001).

Analogously, also the distance walked during the 6MWT
significantly improved in both groups, but more in the i-
WG (main effect: F(1,40) = 72.087, p < 0.001; interaction:
F(1,40) = 7.883, p = 0.008; main group effect: F(1,40) =
0.360, p = 0.552). In fact, the percentage improvement

was 109.2 ± 121.6 % in the i-WG and 32.6 ± 30.5 % in
the CG (p = 0.007) (see Fig. 3).

the baseline in the 10MWT distance and who reached a
minimal clinically important difference (MCID), defined

as ≥0.16 m/s. was 13 in the i-WG and 5 in the CG
(OR = 6.31, IC95 % = 1.63–24.50, p = 0.0057).

Clinical assessment
In both groups all clinical scale scores significantly im-
proved from T0 to T1 (p < 0.05) with the exception of
the Ashworth score at ankle level in the CG (p = 0.157)
and the Ashworth score at hip level, which did not change
in either the i-WG (p = 0.180) or the CG (p = 0.317). Due
to the high variability among subjects, no differences were
found at T1 in terms of raw clinical scores. However,
when these scores were normalized using effectiveness
for reducing inter-individual variability, many signifi-
cant changes emerged. The parameter effectiveness of
the Tinetti-score was significantly higher in the i-WG
(68.4 ± 27.6 %) with respect to the CG (48.1 ± 33.9 %,
p = 0.033).
Effectiveness computed on the other clinical scores

was close to the statistically significant threshold for the
BI score (i-WG vs. CG: p = 0.076) but far from this
threshold for the other scores (see Fig. 3).

Upright trunk stability measured by accelerometers
The RM-Anova performed on the data of the normalized
trunk accelerations showed significant main effects of con-
dition and time (i.e., walking inside or outside parallel bars,
F = 11.483, p = 0.002; pre-post rehabilitation, F = 26.542,
p < 0.001). The main effect of group was not statistically
significant (F = 2.438, p = 0.127). The most interesting
result was the significant effect of the interaction among
all factors considered: condition*time*axis*group (F =
4.727, p = 0.036). Figure 3 graphically shows the latter
result with post-hoc analyses; the threshold of signifi-
cance was corrected at 0.006 (according to Bonferroni).
For the i-WG but not the CG significant reductions of
upper body acceleration were found along the latero-
lateral axis during overground walking outside the parallel
bars and along the antero-posterior and latero-lateral axes
for walking inside the parallel bars (see Fig. 3).

Record of falls
During the 6 months after discharge, 4 patients in the i-
WG and 9 in the CG reported at least one fall, resulting

in an odds ratio of OR = 0.36 (IC95 % = 0.09–1.44). This
means that the risk of falling was more than halved in the
i-WG with respect to the CG. However, this difference
was not significantly different between the two groups
(p = 0.143). An association was also found between sub-
jects who experienced a fall during the six months be-
tween T1 and T2 and trunk acceleration assessed at T1:
higher normalized trunk accelerations during overground
walking at discharge were found in patients who fell after
discharge (repeated measures ANOVA: F(1,34) = 5.072,
p = 0.031). These accelerations were also different between
the two groups (F(1,34) = 4.392, p = 0.044) for body axes
(F(1,34) = 12.048, p = 0.001); furthermore, a slightly signifi-
cant interaction was found between group and fallers/non-
fallers (F(1,34) = 4.208; p = 0.048), as these accelerations
were higher in the i-WG fallers.

Discussion
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of walking
training performed with the i-Walker robotic device on
walking performances of patients in the subacute phase
following mild/moderate stroke. We found that the use
of the i-Walker resulted in increased walking speed and
walking capacity. This speed increment exceeded the
MCID in about half of the patients enrolled in the i-
WG, a significantly higher number than those in the CG
who exceeded this threshold.
Furthermore, after practice the patients trained with

the i-Walker had increased trunk stability associated
with reduced upright gait instabilities, in turn associated
with their real number of falls in the community. The
increment in speed for both short and long distances
was probably achieved because the i-Walker allows sub-
jects to walk in a more ecological way than walking
training performed between parallel bars, and in a more
symmetrical manner than walking using a quadripode.
One mechanism that might underlie the observed

improvement of balance competencies (assessed using
Tinetti scores and trunk accelerations) might be plas-
ticity dependent recovery [43], which was boosted by
intensive task-oriented walking training performed
overground and with correct sensory-motor feedback.
The i-Walker allows individuals to interact in an eco-

logical environment in a clinical setting and potentially

at home and in the community. This is different from
therapy using robotics or parallel bars where people are
forced to use them in a clinical setting. Involvement of the
cognitive system allows integrating a top-down approach
with the more conventional bottom-up one during walking,
in line with recent findings on walking recovery [44].
Thus, the i-Walker could be an effective option for pa-

tients who are unable to engage in a training protocol
performed on the floor without the continuous help of a
physiotherapist for support and balance. At the same time,
a body-weight-supported system coupled with an end-
effector/ exoskeleton system or treadmill can be helpful
for most severely affected patients but is too constrictive
for less affected patients because it alters sensory-motor
feedback/feedforward signals and thus balance plasticity
dependent recovery. This hypothesis is reinforced by the
finding that the afferent inputs, which are crucial for pos-
tural stability in patients with stroke, are altered in walking-
like training such as footplate/treadmill training [45].
From another point of view, conventional walking train-

ing with parallel bars or a cane might reinforce asymmet-
rical posture in a crucial phase of recovery. In fact, it has
recently been suggested that spatial asymmetries and motor
asymmetries should be treated as the same phenomena by
avoiding gestures that reinforce asymmetry [46].
Patients with hemiplegia due to stroke are more prone

to falling because of sensory and motor deficit problems
and a lack of rapid posture adjustment, which is essen-
tial for dynamically stabilized standing. Gait stability is a
fundamental parameter that should be measured and
trained in patients with stroke, because it is more linked
to falls than other walking parameters such as walking
velocity and walking inter-limb coordination [47]. Hence,
another important finding of our study is the reduction of
trunk accelerations related to instabilities in subjects per-
forming i-Walker-assisted overground training. Although
the number of fallers in the i-Walker group was half that
in the control group, the difference between the two
groups was not statistically different. This was probably
because of the few falls that actually occurred, which was
to be expected in a sample of 42 subjects. However, at the
end of the i-Walker training several indicators of upright
gait instability (parameters found to be significantly lower
in fallers) were significantly reduced. In fact, this was to be
expected because dynamic balance deficits are linked
to a high risk of falling [48] and alteration of latero-
lateral weight shifting is one of the most common
causes of falls [49]. Subjects who were trained with i-
Walker were found to have fewer balance difficulties,
especially in the latero-lateral axis, during overground
walking (as shown by the statistically significant inter-
action among condition*time*axis*group). As to antero-
posterior instabilities, they were reduced in i-WG but
only during walking within bars.

This study makes an important contribution to the
field of neuromotor recovery and the findings reported
here can be translated into rehabilitation practice be-
cause of the conjunction between a well-known device,
i.e., the i-Walker and the advanced technology that
allowed us to use it with positive results in mild/moder-
ate haemiparetic subjects.
It should be noted that only patients in the i-Walker

group showed a decrease in ankle spasticity. It is well
known that exercise that promotes orthostatic balance
and amount of mobilization has a positive effect on re-
ducing muscle tone after central nervous system dam-
age; by contrast, immobilization or little mobilization
leads to an increase in spasticity and contractures [50].
Before concluding, we must mention some limitations

of our study. The two main limitations were that the
study was registered only after the end of data collection
and that the follow-up assessment was limited to records
concerning falls and no clinical or instrumental tool was
used to assess balance and walking capabilities. Further,
the number of falls was self-reported by patients; there-
fore, it is conceivable that subjects under-reported the
incidence of falls. Another limitation of our study is that
it is unclear whether the improvements obtained using
the i-Walker could also have been achieved by the con-
trol group if their training had been performed in more
variable contexts. In any case, this would have been very
difficult to obtain because it would have involved greater
effort on the part of the physiotherapist (or the interven-
tion of more than one therapist) and could have led to
safety problems related to patients’ falling (or fear of
falling). Furthermore, future research should evaluate
the effect of the i-Walker in a larger sample and should
include a follow-up group. Finally, it would be useful to
explore the usefulness of the i-Walker as an assistive
device for use in the home.

Conclusions
In conclusion, in this study the i-Walker was found to
be more effective than conventional therapy in improving
walking abilities and upright gait stability in patients with
mild/moderate deficits due to subacute stroke.
