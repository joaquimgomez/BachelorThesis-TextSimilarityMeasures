Abstract Performance measurement is a key issue when
a company is designing new strategies to improve resource
allocation. This paper offers a new methodology inspired
by classic importance–performance analysis (IPA) that pro-
vides a global index of importance versus performance for
firms. This index compares two rankings of the same set of
features regarding importance and performance, taking into
account underperforming features. The marginal contribu-
tion of each feature to the proposed global index defines a
set of iso-curves that represents an improvement in the IPA
diagram. The defined index, together with the new version
of the diagram, will enable the assessment of a firm’s overall
performance and, therefore, enhance decision making in the
allocation of resources. The proposed methodology has been
applied to a Taiwanese multi-format retailer and managerial

1 Introduction

Importance–performance analysis (IPA) is considered a
major area of research in management sciences (Bacon
2003). Firm features are ranked regarding either their impor-
tance or their performance. In general, differences between
importance and performance rankings of features are con-
sidered when assessing a firm’s resource allocation. Initial
approaches in the late 1970s were based on simple and
intuitive graphic techniques (Martilla and James 1977).
Since then, various methodologies have been developed for
managerial applications. Specifically, studies in marketing
(Fornell et al. 1996; Park et al. 2008), knowledge manage-
ment and information systems (Ainin andHisham2008;Kale
and Karaman 2011), operations (Gunasekaran et al. 2004),
human resources (Eskildsen and Kristensen 2006) and edu-
cation (ONeill and Palmer 2004) have recently contributed to
the scientific development of IPA. Some current methodolo-
gies involve a quantitative approach that leads to a numerical
analysis of values obtained from the importance and perfor-
mance measurements (Globerson 1985).

Ranking systems are commonly used in performance
analysis and are considered a main research topic in eco-
nomics and business when broadly applied to decision-
making problems. Many methodologies can be found in the
literature to address ranking problems (Butler et al. 2001;
Hochbaum and Levin 2006). In some of them, different rank-
ings from the same set of features are compared by means of

correlation indexes such as Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rho
correlation coefficients (Glover et al. 2011; Lapata 2006).

We present in this paper a new similarity index to com-
pare two importance and performance rankings of the same
set of features. The proposed index is based on induced
ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operators (Yager and
Filev 1999). Rankings are considered as ordered lists of a
given set of features or alternatives, and differences between
lists are considered to define the index of similarity. This
index, when applied to a firm’s features rankings for both
importance and performance, enables a firm’s global per-
formance to be assessed. There are two main differences
between our index and existing indexes such as Kendall’s
tau and Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients. On the one
hand, the asymmetry of the features treatment, i.e., it just
takes into account underperforming features and, on the sec-
ond hand, the specific relation between the weights and the
importance, i.e., themore important an underperforming fea-
ture, the greater its weight is considered in the similarity
index.

In addition, a new IPA diagram, based on the proposed
similarity index is presented to select featureswhere resource
allocation is necessary. The “Concentrate Here” region of
the new IPA diagram is contained in the corresponding
“diagonally-based” region introduced by Abalo et al. (2007),
and is defined via the iso-curves obtained when considering
themarginal contribution of the features to the proposed sim-
ilarity index.

An application of the presented methodology to the retail
sector has been conducted. The starting point of our applica-
tion is a set of 44 features used in the retail sector that were
selected by expert managers as the main performance vari-
ables. Thereafter, a survey of 84 senior managers of a major
chain store in Taiwan was undertaken. The survey evaluated
the importance and the performance of these features using
a Likert scale. The similarity index is applied to compare
the two rankings of this set of features. Whilst the proposed
similarity index could have broader applications, the specific
application in this paper throws light on company resource
allocation (Deng 2007).

The paper is organized as follows. The following section
presents the state-of-the-art on IPA. Section 3 introduces the
new index of similarity between rankings and states its prop-
erties. Section 4 presents the real-case application from the
retail sector.

A discussion comparing the differences between per-
ceived importance and perceived actual performance enables
us to suggest managerial applications for improving resource
allocation. Section 5 contains conclusions and suggestions
for further research in this area. In addition, two appendixes
are included in the paper. AppendixA introduces the absolute
order-of-magnitude qualitative model and Appendix B pro-
poses a ranking method based on this model.

2 Literature review on importance–performance
analysis

Several approaches for analyzing importance and perfor-
mance to improve resource allocation have emerged in the
literature. In this section, the state of the art in IPA is pre-
sented.

The classical IPAwas first proposed byMartilla and James
(1977) with the objective of evaluating consumer acceptance
of a marketing program. As the authors emphasized in their
first paper: “It is a low-cost, easily-understood technique that
can yield important insights into which aspect of the mar-
keting mix a firm should devote more attention, as well as
identify areas that may be consuming too many resources”
(Martilla and James 1977). Over the years, IPA has been
applied in various fields, importance and performance have
been measured in very different ways by many authors, and
many approaches and improvements of this technique have
been published (Bacon 2003; Deng 2007; Ennew et al. 1993;
Eskildsen and Kristensen 2006; Liu et al. 2011).

The traditional IPA methodology basically consists of
representing ratings of importance and performance for
several features on a two-dimensional chart. The resulting
importance–performance grid is divided into four quadrants.
To interpret the results, Martilla and James (1977) give a
name to each quadrant to help managers determine the high-
est and lowest priorities for improvement, as shown in Fig. 1.

Inferring priorities from the IPA diagram can be done in
various ways, such as the scale-centered quadrant model; the
data-centered quadrant model; or the diagonal model. The
advantages and disadvantages of each approach are reviewed
in Bacon (2003). In the quadrant models, the priorities for
improving the features are inferred from the quadrant where
each feature is located. In the diagonal model, a diagonal line
or lines separate regions and points above the line may repre-
sent high priorities for improvement. Some researchers add
the examination of the difference between importance and

performance to the grid, known in the literature as “gap analy-
sis”. Other authors (Abalo et al. 2007) use a partition that
combines the quadrant and diagonal-based schemes, enlarg-
ing the top left quadrant as shown in Fig. 2.

Amajor difficulty facing IPA is themeasurement of impor-
tance and performance. Direct and indirect measures are
foundwhen analyzing different IPA applications (Abalo et al.
2007; Danaher andMattsson 1994;Wittink and Bayer 1994).
Direct measures for both importance and performance can be
obtained by asking managers to rank the different attributes;
or alternatively, using Likert scales.

Interest in performancemeasurement has strongly increased
over the last 20 years (Taticchi et al. 2010).

Effectiveness and efficiency, according to Neely et al.’s
(2005) definitions, have become increasingly important and
measurement has been made a key point for enhancing busi-
ness performance (Sharmaet al. 2005). It is relevant to remark
that the approach has evolved from being financial based to
non-financial based (Motta et al. 2006).

The performance measures should capture the essence of
organizational performance (Chen 2002; Gunasekaran et al.
2004). Nevertheless, if the number is too large, the decision-
making and control processes may become more difficult
(Globerson 1985). In contrast, any single performance mea-
sure will present a myopic view that will prevent managers
improving overall resource allocation.

Even when the appropriate features have been well identi-
fied, it remains necessary to find the best method to measure
both the performance and importance of these features.Many
authors have tried to find a measure to compare these para-
meters. In practice, these measures can be obtained using
simple comparisons of means, or advanced statistical analy-
sis. Both approaches can be useful in some situations, but
both present aggregation problems or are too complex to be
operational. An example of an alternative measure can be
found in Ennew et al. (1993), where an index to provide a
measure of overall satisfaction in service quality is given. In
that case, the authors propose an attainment index designed

to reflect the extent to which there is a mismatch (con-
firmation/disconfirmation) between what customers require
(importance in our case) and the quality of what they receive
(performance in our case).

The aim of this paper is to develop a global index that
is simple to use, both in calculating and interpreting the
relationship between the importance of the attributes that
describe the firm and their perceived performance.

3 An index for comparing importance
and performance

Several authors have conducted various analytical measures
to individually compare the gap between performance and
importance in the features that describe a firm. Neverthe-
less, there are few contributions that globally capture the
overall disparity between importance and performance. As
said in Ennew et al. (1993), simple comparison of means
at one extreme, and detailed statistical analysis at the other
extreme, both offer useful insights but present different types
of difficulties: aggregation problems with the comparison of
means, and operational problems with techniques such as
factor analysis and regression. In Ennew et al. (1993), a set
of indexes that measure expectations, perceptions, and over-
all satisfaction are presented. Nevertheless, this kind of index
only takes into account an analysis feature by feature instead
of holistically.

As rankings are generated for both importance and perfor-
mancewhenmeasuring the same set of features, the definition
of a suitable indicator of their differences is a relevant issue.
A comparison of rankings may be undertaken with different
techniques, but most techniques do not take into account the
relative importance of the ranked items, and only consider
their relative ranked position. The index considered in this
paper, based on IOWA operator’s concept (Chiclana et al.
2007; Yager and Filev 1999), enables importance and per-
formance rankings to be compared more sensitively. IOWA
operators were introduced in Yager and Filev (1999) as an
extension of ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators
(Yager 1988, 2008).

On the other hand, IOWA operators consider two related
variables: first, the order inducing variable, and second, the
argument variable. The argument variable values are aggre-
gated using a set of weights based on the order of the values
of the first variable.

Definition 1 An IOWAoperator of dimensionn is amapping
Φ : (R × R)n → R such that (Yager and Filev 1999):

Φ((u1, x1), . . . , (un, xn)) =
n∑

i=1
wi xσ(i),



J. M. Sayeras et al.

where σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n} is a permutation such
that uσ(i) ≥ uσ(i+1), ∀i = 1, . . . , n − 1, and wi are a set of
weights such that wi ∈ [0, 1] and

∑n
i=1 wi = 1.

Both OWA and IOWA operators have been deeply studied
and applied in multi-criteria and group decision-making lit-
erature (Chiclana et al. 2007). In addition, several extensions
of the above-mentioned operators have been introduced in
other studies to deal with situations where fuzzy or linguistic
variables are considered in decision-making processes (Her-
rera and Herrera-Viedma 1997; Herrera-Viedma et al. 2006).

The following definitions consider differences between
performance and importance in features ordered from the
most important to the least. The global index proposed in this
paper is a convenient weighted mean of these differences;
i.e., an IOWA operator with importance as order inducing
variable and these differences as argument variable.

Let n be the number of features considered to describe a
firm and Ii and Pi be the importance and performance posi-
tions in the rankings of the i th feature, respectively. Ii and Pi
are numbers from 1 to n such that the feature corresponding
to Ii = 1 is the most important and the feature corresponding
to Pj = 1 is the best performed.

Note that fromnowon, the features are considered ordered
with respect to their importance position in the ranking, i.e.,
the (i)th feature is the feature with importance position in
the ranking I(i) = i , and so I(1) = 1, . . . , I(n) = n.

Definition 2 The importance–performance vector of a firm
F is the vector:

IPR(F) = ((1, P1), . . . , (n, Pn))

whose components are the pairs of ranking values of its fea-
tures with respect to importance and performance, ordered
according to their importance in the ranking.

The n components of the IPR(F) vector of a firm F can be
represented as points in the IPA diagram, each point (x, y)
corresponding to one of the n considered features. To include
all these n points in the classical IPA diagram, the reverse
positions in the ranking with respect to performance and
importance, centered in

(
n+1
2 ,

)
, have to be computed,

i.e., x = n+12 − Pi and y = n+12 − i .

Example 1 To illustrate the representationof the importance–
performance vector of a firm on the IPA diagram, let us
consider a case with n = 7 features and two firms F1 and
F2. Let

IPR(F1) = ((1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 3))
IPR(F2) = ((1, 3), (2, 7), (3, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 4), (7, 2))

be the importance–performance vectors of F1 and F2. The
representation on the IPA diagram of IPR(F1) and IPR(F2)
is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.

Note that the ranking values (i, Pi ) of the considered fea-
tures with respect to importance and performance can be
obtained via any ranking method. Appendix B proposes a
ranking method based on the absolute order-of-magnitude
qualitative model resumed in Appendix A.

From now on, let us denote by IPR∗ the importance–
performance vector of the ideal best performed firm, i.e.,
IPR∗ = ((1, 1), . . . , (i, i), . . . , (n, n)) and IPR∗ the
importance–performance vector of a firm in the opposite sit-
uation, i.e., IPR∗ = ((1, n), . . . , (i, n − i + 1), . . . , (n, 1)).

To focus on the features in which resources must be allo-
cated, and from the importance–performance vector of a
firm IPR(F) = ((1, P1), . . . , (n, Pn)), the next definition
introduces a newvector that takes into account only underper-
forming features, i.e., those features where their performance
position in the ranking is worse than their importance posi-
tion in the ranking.



A measure of perceived performance to assess…

Definition 3 Let IPR(F) = ((1, P1), . . . , (n, Pn)) be the
importance–performance vector of a firm F . The non-
negative performance–importance differences vector of the
firm is the n-dimensional vector DV(F) = (X1, . . . , Xn),
where Xi = max(Pi − i, 0), for all i = 1, . . . , n.

Note that for any firm F , the components of DV(F), are
Xi ≥ 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n and nonzero components corre-
spond to underperforming features.

In the two cases described above, corresponding to
the ideal best performed firm and its opposite situation,
the associated non-negative performance–importance differ-
ences vectors are, respectively,

DV∗ = (0, . . . , 0) and
DV∗ = (n − 1, . . . ,max(n − 2i + 1, 0), . . . , 0).

Based on the usual partial order in Rn , the next definition
establishes a preference relation between differences vec-
tors introduced in Definition 3 and, therefore, between the
importance–performance status of firms.

Definition 4 Let DV(F1) = (X11, . . . , X1n) and DV(F2) =
(X21, . . . , X

2
n) be two differences vectors, then DV(F

1) is
preferred to DV(F2), DV(F1) � DV(F2), whenDV(F1) ≤
DV(F2) with the usual order in Rn , i.e., X1i ≤ X2i for all
i = 1, . . . , n.

In this way, DV(F1) is preferred to DV(F2) when F1

performs better than F2 for all underperforming features.
Differences vectors introduced in Definition 3 enable us to
define an index via an IOWA operator that preserves this
preference relation:

Definition 5 Let DV(F) = (X1, . . . , Xn) be the differences
vector of a firm, the Global importance–performance Index
(G) of the firm is:

G(X1, . . . , Xn) =
n∑

i=1
wi Xi

where weights are computed using Borda–Kendall method
(Kendall 1948), i.e., wi = 2(n−i+1)n(n+1) for all i = 1, . . . , n.

Note that wi ∈ [0, 1] for all i = 1, . . . , n and
∑n

i=1 wi =
1. Theseweights express the ratio between the reverse impor-
tance position in the ranking n − Ii − 1 = n − i − 1 of the
i th feature and

∑n
i=1 i . Indeed, the weights decrease from

2n
n(n+1) to

2
n(n+1) . In this way, features with greater impor-

tance have greater weights in the weighted mean defining
the G(X1, . . . , Xn) of a given firm.

Note that G(X1, . . . , Xn) is an IOWA operator with
importance as order inducing variable and the non-negative
performance–importance differences as argument variable.

In the following proposition, some properties of G(X1,
. . . , Xn) are provided.

Proposition 1 G(X1, . . . , Xn) satisfies the following prop-
erties:

1. G(X1, . . . , Xn) ≥ 0.
2. G(X1, . . . , Xn) = 0 if and only if Pi = i for all i =

1, . . . , n, i.e., (X1, . . . , Xn) = (0, . . . , 0) = DV∗.
3. If n is even G(DV∗) = 5n−212 , and if n is odd G(DV∗) =

(n−1)(5n+3)
12n .

4. G(X1, . . . , Xn) preserves the � relation.

Proof 1. Considering that X j ≥ 0, w j ≥ 0 and
∑k

j=1
w j = 1, we obtain: w j X j ≥ 0, therefore, G(X1, . . .,
Xn) ≥ 0.

2. Let us prove [G(X1, . . . , Xn) = 0 ⇒ (Pi = i ∀i =
1, . . . , n)]: G(X1, . . . , Xn) = 0 ⇒ (Xi = 0 ∀i) ⇒
(Pi ≤ i ∀i) ⇒ (Pi − i ≤ 0 ∀i). If j exists such that
Pj < j , then Pj − j < 0which leads to

∑n
i=1(Pi −i) < 0

and which contradicts the fact that
∑n

i=1 Pi =
∑n

i=1 i .
The proof of ⇐ is straightforward.

3. In the case n is even: the components of the vector of non-
negative performance–importance differences are Xi =
n−2i+1, i = 1, . . . , n

2
, and Xi = 0, i =

n

2
+1, . . . , n.

Therefore,

G(DV∗) =
∑

Pi ≥i

2(n − i + 1)
n(n + 1) (Pi − i)

= 2
n(n + 1)

n/2∑

i=1
(n − i + 1)(n − 2i + 1),

which leads, after a straightforward calculation, to:
G(DV∗) = 5n−212 .
In the case n odd: the components of the vector of non-
negative performance–importance differences are Xi =
n − 2i + 1, i = 1, . . . , n−12 , and Xi = 0, i = n−12 +
1, . . . , n. Therefore,

G(DV∗) =
∑

Pi ≥i

2(n − i + 1)
n(n + 1) (Pi − i)

= 2
n(n + 1)

(n−1)/2∑

i=1
(n − i + 1)(n − 2i + 1),

which leads, after a straightforward calculation, to:
G(DV∗) = (n−1)(5n+3)12n .

4. The proof is straightforward. ��
Example 2 Continuing with Example 1, the differences’
vectors and the global importance–performance indexes cor-
responding to firms F1 and F2 are, respectively,

DV(F1) = (4, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0), G(DV(F1)) = 1.357;
DV(F2) = (2, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0), G(DV(F2) = 2.214,

which leads us to infer that firm F1 performs better than firm
F2 (see Proposition 1, Property 4).

Note that in this case, the maximum possible value for the
global index would be G(DV∗) = 2.714. Table 1 shows the
marginal contribution of each feature, as given in Definition
5, to the G index, i.e., the product wi Xi , being i = 1, . . . , 7
for both firms.

Although the most important feature of F1 has a bad per-
formance,most of the non-negative performance–importance
differences are smaller for IPR(F1) than for IPR(F2).

The following proposition establishes an intuitive prop-
erty for the G index, relating it with the partition of the IPA
diagram in Abalo et al. (2007) (see Fig. 2) and determining
relevant importance–performance situations.

Proposition 2 The features that contribute to theG index are
all features above the principal diagonal of the IPA diagram,
i.e., those classified as “Concentrate Here” in the partition
of the IPA diagram in Abalo et al. (2007).

Proof The proof is straightforward, because only features
above thediagonal I = P providenon-negative performance–
importance differences. ��

The following proposition determines the level curves
(iso-curves) of themarginal contribution of the features to the
G index in the IPA diagram, giving decision makers precise
information about where to concentrate resources to improve
performance.

Fig. 5 Level curves of the marginal contribution of the features to the
G index

Proposition 3 The level curves of the marginal contribution
of a feature to the G index in the IPA diagram are:

n + 1 + 2y
n(n + 1) (y − x) = k,

for any k ∈ R+ (see Fig. 5).

Proof Let us consider, as in Figs. 3 and 4 representation,

x = n + 1

− Pi and y =

− i . From Definition 5, the
level curves’ equations of the marginal contribution of the
i th feature to the G index are:
2(n − i + 1)

n(n + 1) (Pi − i) = k,

for all features with non-negative performance–importance
difference (otherwise, the features do not contribute to the G
index). By substituting Pi and i by their expressions in terms
of x and y, respectively, we obtain:

which is equivalent to:

2n − (n + 1 − 2y) + 2)
n(n + 1) (y − x) = k.

Finally,

n + 1 + 2y
n(n + 1) (y − x) = k.

��
Figure 5 shows the level curves of the marginal contribu-

tion of the underperforming features to the G index over the
IPA diagram partition in Abalo et al. (2007). Features in the
same level curve are those with the same degree of underper-
formance, i.e., for each k, the corresponding level curve con-
tains features “with degree of under-performance k”. In Fig.
5, level curves corresponding to k = 0.05, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1
and 1.2 are represented.

This representation clearly improves the approach in
Abalo et al. (2007) to determine the target features for
resource allocation. The “Concentrate Here” zone of the dia-
gram can be dynamically selected depending on the available
resources and the admitted level of underperformance.

Example 3 Continuing with Examples 1 and 2, Figs. 6 and
7 include the features that are contributing to the G index in
each of the two firms together with the level curves of the
marginal contribution discussed in Proposition 3.

Figures 6 and 7 show that the marginal contribution of
features in the case of firm F2 are bigger than those corre-
sponding to F1. The level curves in Figs. 6 and 7 highlight
the features where resources must be allocated as a priority
in each firm.

Two are the main differences between the G index and
other well-known correlation coefficients defined to compare
rankings. On the one hand, the G index takes into account
only underperforming features. On the other hand, since the
G index is defined through an IOWA operator applied to the

Fig. 6 IPR(F1) in the IPA diagram

Fig. 7 IPR(F2) in the IPA diagram

non-negative performance–importance differences of a firm,
not all the features contribute to it in the same way. The more
underperforming and the more important a feature is, the
greater its contribution to the G index.

Let us highlight the advantages and disadvantages of our
proposal in comparison with other existing IPA approaches.
The IPA framework has been widely accepted due to its
simplicity of calculations and intuitive graphical represen-
tation. From a computational point of view, the proposed
methodology represents an improvement since the marginal
contribution of each feature to the G index is determined.
Thesemarginal contributions provide information about how
the current performance of a firm can be improved by giv-
ing decision makers information about where to concentrate
resources. From a graphical point of view, the innovative
contribution of the proposed approach is that features can be
drawn in a new diagram with the level curves of the marginal
contribution of each feature to the G index, so managers can
easily identify those underperformed features that require
immediate action.

As a limitation of the proposed methodology, we can note
that the G index compares the importance and performance
of features just within a particular company. While, in a
situation of limited information about competitors, it pro-
vides managers a framework to work with and to explore
the strengths and weaknesses of the company; nevertheless,
the proposed methodology including the G index could be
improvedby addingmeasures of features’ performancebased
on comparisons of products and services of either competing
companies or the sector. In this direction, some extensions of
IPA are reviewed in Kim and Oh (2001). In particular, some
approaches modify the original IPA by considering three or
more dimensions, being competitors’ performance one of
them. These studies consider, instead of the four quadrants
in the original IPA grid, either eight octants or even more dif-

ferent outcomes’ areas. However, adding dimensions in the
IPA grid implies loosing simplicity of attribute display and
data interpretation.

In Table 2, an analysis and comparison are given of the
main features of some of the existing IPA extensions and
the method presented. The three considered characteristics
to compare them are: the graphical approach considered, the
dimensions of the IPAdiagram, andfinally the use of an index
or indicator measuring global performance.

In general, in decision-making aid systems, one should
note that there is no single method which outperforms all
other methods in all aspects. However, the simplicity in user
interaction is, indeed, one of the main values that share most
of the IPAmethods, and it is closely related to the grid dimen-
sionality.

4 A real-case application to the retail sector

In this section, an application of the proposedmethodology to
assess importance–performance in a Taiwan retail company
is presented, after a brief introduction to the performance
evaluation framework for the retail sector.

4.1 Evaluating performance in the retail sector

In recent years, the role of knowledge within strategic man-
agement has become the subject of substantial advances in
research (Braz et al. 2011; Chini 2004; Gherardi 2009; Non-
aka andTeece 2001; Teece 2000).Nevertheless,most of these
studies relate to aspects of the transfer of knowledge rather
than the application of knowledge in the evaluation of per-
formance.

Despite the relative paucity of research in a retail context,
the use of expert knowledge by managers is an important
factor at a micro-level in the success of retailers and at the
macro-level for sectorial re-structuring. Managers bring to
bear their individual expert knowledge to solve problems at
operational and strategic levels in the retail firm. The knowl-
edge they hold and apply dependsmainly on their perceptions
of the levels of current performance and the levels of impor-

tance of specific features. An issue that arises, deriving from
this view of the diversity of knowledge held by retail man-
agers, is how to synthesize the individual perceptions of
managers in ways that can be useful in strategic manage-
ment. Thus, aggregating managerial opinions on the relative
performance of some specific features and analyzing the con-
tribution of these different features to the overall performance
of the retailer are considered crucial.

In this research context, these individual and differing
perceptions of the relevance of the various resources can
be gathered through qualitative data collection. Given that
managers will view differently the relative importance of
the various features, a method to compare the opinions of
managers and synthesize these qualitatively framed opinions
would be useful.

In the next subsections, we conduct a full experiment
that first includes the selection of relevant performance-
related variables. Second, we present a survey of senior
managers that measures their perceptions of the importance
and performance of the selected variables, based on the order-
of-magnitude qualitative model as included in Appendix A.
Thirdly, the rankingmethoddetailed inAppendixB is applied
to obtain rankings of the selected variables, aggregating
expert opinions with respect to importance and performance,
respectively. Finally, the global index G, together with the
iso-curves of the feature contribution to the index introduced
in Sect. 3, is used to summarize the differences in these
rankings and identify features to which resources should be
allocated.

4.2 Design of the empirical study and data collection

Astudy involving seniormanagers as expertswas undertaken
in a major chain store organization. President Chain Store
Corporation is a multinational retailer based on Taiwan that
operates a multi-format strategy through a range of organi-
zational structures. It is the largest retailer in Taiwan. Using
literature surveys and 25 in-depth interviews with a cross
section of retailer stake-holders, 170 performance-related
variables relevant to retailing were identified. From this list,
after rationalization and classification in terms of the nature

of the resource, 44 features or variables related to resources
used in retailing were selected as the main performance vari-
ables. The selectionwas undertaken by reference to the views

of interviewees and research literature on resource-based
theories of the firm. Seven resource areas were established
within these 44 features, as shown in Table 3.



J. M. Sayeras et al.

A survey was then undertaken with managers in the
Taiwan head office. Data were collected from 84 senior man-
agers across all the managerial functions. Managers were
divided into five main groups depending on broad functional
area: marketing (15); operations and store operations (17);
accounting, finance and audit (24); R&D and information
systems (14); and other (e.g., human resources, law) (14).

Managers were asked to use their expertise to assess each
of the 44 variables in terms of their perceived importance to
the performance of the firm. An ordinal scale of 1–4was used
as: (1) extremely important; (2) very important; (3) moder-
ately important; (4) not very important; with (5) as “don’t
know”. The managers were asked to repeat the exercise in
terms of the perceived performance of the firm based on the
same variables, with the scale being: (1) extremely good (or
extremely strong); (2) very good (or very strong); (3) moder-
ately good (or moderately strong); (4) not very good (or not
very strong); with (5) again used as “don’t know”.

4.3 Data analysis and results

This subsection is devoted to analyzing and comparing the
evaluations of importance and performance of the 44 fea-
tures in Table 3. Using the ranking methodology described
in Appendix B, the features were ranked with respect to their
importance and with respect to their performance from the
responses from all 84 experts.

In this case, the non-negative performance–importance
differences vector of the firm is the 44-dimensional vector:

DV(F) = (10, 12, 1, 4, 10, 13, 13, 0, 3, 16,
0, 0, 10, 27, 14, 0, 0, 12, 3, 0, 6, 11, 1, 0, 0, 10, 16,

0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0).

Then, weights are computed using Borda–Kendall law,
obtainingwi = 45−i990 for all i = 1, . . . , 44.With these values,
the G index introduced in Sect. 3 to compare rankings with
respect to importance and performance is computed and pro-
duces a global importance–performance index G(DV(F)) =
6.329. Taking into account that the ideal best performing
firm has G(DV∗) = 0 and the firm in the opposite situ-
ation has G(DV∗) = 18.167, as proven in Proposition 1,
there is, therefore, a significant divergence between the two
considered rankings (corresponding to about one third of
the range of variation, precisely a 34.8 %). This fact shows
that there is room for resource allocation improvement. Note
that, similar conclusions can be obtained when we compute
other well-known correlation coefficients, such as Kendall’s
tau or Spearman’s rho, for the same pairs of importance–

performance rankings. In these two cases, we obtain 0.378
and 0.506, respectively.

The comparison of the two rankings given by our method-
ology and shown in Fig. 8 also points out the directions for
this improvement. The added value of our contribution to
the comparison of both rankings is the combination of the G
index and the level curves of the marginal contribution of the
features to this index. In Fig. 8, an example of the level curve
corresponding to k = 0.3 is depicted (see Proposition 3).

As detailed in Proposition 2, among the 44 features
selected, the 24 features that plot above the principal diago-
nal are those that contribute to the G value of the firm. These
are aspects of the firm that are perceived by managers as
underperforming and coincide with aspects in the “Concen-
trate Here” region defined in Abalo et al. (2007). Similarly,
Fig. 8 shows the region labeled as “Concentrate Here” in
the Martilla’s classical IPA diagram, which contains seven
features.

In addition, in this paper, as explained in Sect. 3, we pro-
pose a step forward in understanding which features may
be improved. Beyond the IPA diagram, we suggest concen-
trating resources in those features that contribute most to
the G value of the firm. In Fig. 8, these features have been
visualized over the dotted line for the case k = 0.3. This
line is the iso-curve of the marginal contribution of the fea-
tures to the G index in the IPA diagram corresponding to
k = 0.3 (see Proposition 3). Visually, most of the contri-
bution to the G index can be seen as focusing on a limited
number of features. These ten extreme values are listed in
Table 4.

Most are directly or indirectly associatedwithfirmgrowth.
Six out of the ten relate directly to organizational resources,
three relate to physical, human, and relational resources,
respectively, and the final one relates to external factors. Note
that in this case, the value k = 0.3 has been used; however,
depending on the available resources, different values of k
could be considered.

4.4 Discussion and managerial implications

Hansen and Bush (1999) pointed out that IPA is a simple and
effective technique that can assist in identifying improvement
priorities. IPA has been applied as an effective means of eval-
uating a firm’s competitive position in themarket, identifying
improvement opportunities, and guiding strategic planning
efforts. However, typically, managers must work with lim-
ited resources in competitive business environments. For this
reason, the proposed method, able to decide how to best allo-
cate scarce resources to maximize importance–performance,
is very helpful.

The results of the empirical testing of the methodology
show how to identify areas of perceived underperformance
of the firm. In our real case, 44 features related to resources
used in retailing were selected as main performance vari-
ables. Managers in the President Chain Store Corporation
then evaluated the perceived importance and the perceived
performance of the firm for these 44 features. From these
evaluations, the features were ranked with respect to these
two concepts using the ranking methodology described in
Appendix B. The proposed G index is computed, and the
iso-curves of the marginal contribution of the features to the
G index enabled recognition of the perceived underperform-
ing features of the firm. The methodology used, by taking
into account the qualitative perceptions held by managers,
provides a useful tool for decision making for the retailer.

Considering the iso-curve of the marginal contribution to
the G index as corresponding to a contribution of k = 0.3,
ten features appeared as being underperforming in that firm;
thus, they can potentially be improved. This level of con-
tribution (k = 0.3) corresponds, as a percentage, to 4.7 %
of the G index. As we can see in Table 2, the “staff train-
ing” feature, which belongs to the human resources area, is
perceived as the most underperforming feature, contributing
more than 13 % (0.13351 = 0.845/6.329) to the G index.
There are seven features whose contribution to the G index

varies between 6.4 and 9 %, with two features contributing
about 5.1 % each. The remaining underperforming features,
below the considered iso-curve, contribute <4.7 % each to
the G.

As stated, when modifying the value of k, a differ-
ent number of features for focus would be obtained. The
strength of the methodology proposed is its adaptable nature,
which helps managers to improve the efficiency of the firm.
Therefore, the G index could be considered as a valuable
decision-support tool to better allocate resources within the
firm.

5 Conclusions and future research

This paper contributes to improving IPA by providing a
new measure that captures the overall relationship between
importance and performance. This measure is obtained by
considering the relevant features that describe a firm and
so enable a firm’s managers to improve decision-making in
resource allocation. The developed methodology, together
with a new version of the classical IPA diagram, enables
managers to assess a firm’s overall performance and detect
features where resources should be allocated. The pre-
sented global importance–performance index (G), inspired
by OWA operators, is a weighted sum of the non-negative
performance–importance differences, where weights depend
on the importance of the feature.

Moreover, the G index also leads to an enhancement
of the IPA diagonal-based scheme with a new representa-
tion: Contribution-to-G iso-curves. These level curves show
a more accurate picture of the most-needed-investment fea-
tures, and determine a new “Concentrate Here” zone in the
classical IPA diagram. A real-case application in the retail
sector has been used to show that the presented methodology
can lead to a more accurate IPA of a firm’s situation. The
real-case application gives us an example of how G could



J. M. Sayeras et al.

benefit managerial decision-making processes in resource
allocation.

As future work, a marginal sensitivity analysis of the G
index incorporating changes in resource allocation would be
a major future contribution for decision-making processes.
It could be of interest in a more advanced study of G proper-
ties to determine the upper-boundary of the index for relative
comparisons of company performances. Additional analy-
sis that separately considers the functional area of managers
could be performed to infer how the area of expertise influ-
ences perceptions and modifies the G index.

Appendix A: The qualitative absolute
order-of-magnitude model

Qualitative reasoning techniques, specifically order-of-
magnitude models, are considered an appropriate mathemat-
ical framework to represent expert opinions or preferences
through a hierarchical model with linguistic labels (Andrés
et al. 2010; Soto 2011; Herrera et al. 2008).

The one-dimensional absolute order-of-magnitude quali-
tative model (Agell et al. 2012; Travé-Massuyès and Dague
2003) works with a finite number of qualitative labels cor-
responding to an ordinal scale of measurement. The number
of labels chosen to describe a real problem is not fixed, but
depends on the characteristics of each represented variable.

Let us consider an ordered finite set of basic labels S∗m =
{B1, . . . , Bm}, which is totally ordered as a chain: B1 <
· · · < Bm , each basic label corresponding to a linguistic
term, for instance, “very bad” < “bad” < “acceptable” <
“good”< “very good”. The complete universe of description
for the order-of-magnitude space OM(m), with granularity
m, is the set Sm = S∗m ∪ {[Bi , B j ] |Bi , B j ∈ S∗m, i < j},
where the labels [Bi , B j ] with i < j are defined [Bi , B j ] =
{Bi , Bi+1, . . . , B j } and named non-basic labels (see Fig. 9).

Fig. 9 The complete universe of description Sm

The order considered in the set of basic labels S∗m induces
a partial order ≤ in Sm defined as:

[Bi , B j ] ≤ [Br , Bs] ⇐⇒
(
Bi ≤ Br and B j ≤ Bs

)
, (1)

considering the convention [Bi , Bi ] = Bi .
This relation is trivially an order relation in Sm , but a par-

tial order, since there are pairs of non-comparable labels.
Moreover, as Fig. 9 shows, there is another partial order rela-
tion in Sm “to be more precise than”; given two qualitative
labels X1 and X2 in Sm , we say that X1 is more precise
than X2 if X1 � X2. The least precise label (most abstract
description) is ? = [B1, Bm] and basic labels are the most
precise labels.

Appendix B: A ranking method using qualitative
linguistic descriptions

In the proposed rankingmethod, each feature is characterized
by the judgments of k evaluators, and each evaluator makes
his/her judgements by means of qualitative labels belong-
ing to an order-of-magnitude space Smh with granularity mh
for h = 1, . . . , k. The evaluations are then synthesized by
means of the distance to a reference k-dimensional vector
of labels. This reference k-dimensional label is given by
the supreme of the sets of evaluations of each feature. The
distances between evaluations and their supreme give the
ranking of features directly. In this way, the process consid-
ered for ranking features assessed by k expert evaluators can
be split in the following four steps:

1. Representing features as k-dimensional vectors of labels.
2. Defining a distance d between k-dimensional vectors of

labels.
3. Building a reference k-dimensional vector of labelsXsup.
4. Obtaining the ranking of the features from the values

d(X, Xsup).

The subsections below describe each of the above steps.

B.1. Feature representation as k-dimensional vectors of
labels

Features are represented by a k-dimensional vectors of labels
belonging to the set X, which is defined as:

X = Sm1 × · · · × Smk =
{
X = (X1, . . . , Xk)|Xi ∈ Smh

∀h = 1, . . . , k} . (2)

For every component, monotonicity is assumed, i.e., Xh ≤
X ′h indicates that the evaluation made by the evaluator h
corresponding to the feature X ′ is better or equal to the one



A measure of perceived performance to assess…

corresponding to X . The order relation defined in each Smh
is extended to the Cartesian product X:

X = (X1, . . . , Xk) ≤ X′ = (X ′1, . . . , X ′k) ⇐⇒ Xh ≤ X ′h
∀h = 1, . . . , k. (3)

This order relation inX is partial, since there are pairs of non-
comparable k-dimensional vectors of labels. And X < X′,
that is to say, X ≤ X′ and X �= X′, means that feature X is
preferred to feature X′ by all the evaluators.

B.2. A distance between k-dimensional vectors of labels

A method for computing distances between k-dimensional
vectors of labels is presented in Agell et al. (2012) via a
codification of the labels in each Smh given by a location
function. The location function codifies each element Xh =
[Bi , B j ] in Smh by a pair of integers (l1(Xh), l2(Xh)), where
l1(Xh) is the opposite of the number of basic elements in Smh
that are “between” B1 and Bi , that is, l1(Xh) = −(i − 1),
and l2(Xh) is the number of basic elements in Smh that are
“between” B j and Bmh , i.e., l2(Xh) = mh − j .

The extension of the location function to the set X of k-
dimensional vectors of labels is defined in the followingway:

L(X) = L(X1, . . . , Xk)
= (l1(X1), l2(X1), . . . , l1(Xk), l2(Xk)). (4)

A distance d between labels X, X′ in X is then defined via
a weighted Euclidian distance in R2k between their codifica-
tions:

d(X, X′)

=
√√√√

k∑

h=1
wh[((l1(Xh) − l1(X ′h))2 + (l2(Xh) − l2(X ′h))2].

(5)

where wi are considered to be the weights assigned to the k
evaluators and

∑k
h=1 wh = 1. This function inherits all the

properties of the weighted Euclidian distance in R2k .

B.3. Building a reference k-dimensional vector of labels

The reference k-dimensional vector of labels considered in
this ranking method is the supreme with respect to the order
relation ≤ of the set of feature representations.

Let {X1, . . . , Xn} ⊂ X be the set of n features represen-
tations to be ranked, then the supreme of the set Xsup, i.e.,
the minimum label in X which satisfies Xr ≤ Xsup, r =
1, . . . , n, is computed as follows:

Given Xr = (Xr1, . . . , Xrk), with Xrh = [Brih , Brjh ] for all
h = 1, . . . , k, and for all r = 1, . . . , n, then,
Xsup = sup{X1, . . . , Xn} = (X̃1, . . . , X̃k),

where:

X̃h = [max{B1ih , . . . , Bnih },max{B1jh , . . . , Bnjh }]. (6)

B.4. Obtaining the features ranking from the values
d(X,Xsup)

Let d be the distance defined inX in Formula (5) andXsup the
reference label defined in Formula (6). Then, the following
binary relation in X:

X � X′ ⇐⇒ d(X′, Xsup) ≤ d(X, Xsup) (7)

is a pre-order, i.e., it is reflexive and transitive. This pre-order
relation induces an equivalence relation ≡ in X by means of:

X ≡ X′ ⇐⇒ [X � X′ , X′ � X]
⇐⇒ d(X′, Xsup) = d(X, Xsup). (8)

In the quotient set X/≡, the following relation between
equivalence classes is:

class (X) � class (X′)
⇐⇒ X � X′ ⇐⇒ d(X′, Xsup) ≤ d(X, Xsup)

(9)

is an order relation. It is trivially a total order.
In this way, a set of features X1, . . . , Xn can be ordered

as a chain with respect to their proximity to the supreme:
class (Xi1) � · · · � class (Xin ).

If each class (Xi j ), j = 1, . . . n, contains only a feature
representation Xi j , the process is finished and we obtain the
ranking Xi1 � · · · � Xin . If there is some class (Xi j ) with
more than one feature representation, then the same ranking
process is applied to the set of the feature representations
belonging to class (Xi j ), and continued until an iteration of
the process gives the same ranking as the previous iteration.
The final ranking Xm1 � · · · � Xmn is then obtained.
