A semantic tagger aiming to detect relevant entities in Arabic medical documents and tagging them with
their appropriate semantic class is presented. The system takes profit of a Multilingual Framework cov-
ering four languages (Arabic, English, French, and Spanish), in a way that resources available for each lan-
guage can be used to improve the results of the others, this is specially important for less resourced
languages as Arabic. The approach has been evaluated against Wikipedia pages of the four languages
belonging to the medical domain. The core of the system is the definition of a base tagset consisting of
the three most represented classes in SNOMED-CT taxonomy and the learning of a binary classifier for
each semantic category in the tagset and each language, using a distant learning approach over three
widely used knowledge resources, namely Wikipedia, Dbpedia, and SNOMED-CT.

1. Introduction and motivation

Semantic Tagging, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that
has attracted recently the interest of many NLP researchers, can
be defined as the task of assigning to some linguistic units occur-
ring within a document a unique semantic tag chosen from a pre-
defined tagset.

There is a wide agreement on approaching some NLP tasks and
applications at the semantic level, but there is also agreement on
considering that the current state of the technology does not allow
a full accurate semantic parsing of text of an unrestricted domain.
So, most systems restrict themselves to partial semantic interpre-
tation, at lexical level (Semantic Tagging), or clause level (Semantic
Role Labelling). Semantic Tagging is, so, a crucial task, per se, or as a
necessary component of Semantic Interpretation Systems.

After this introduction, the organization of the article is as fol-
lows: In Section 2 we sketch the most basics characteristics as well
as the state of the art of the Semantic Tagging approaches. Section 3
presents the methodology followed. The experimental framework
is described in Section 4. Results are shown and discussed in Sec-
tion 5. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and further work
proposals.

2. Related work

Semantic Tagging is a difficult task whose key elements are the
following:

(i) the genre of the document to be processed. The terminology
used in documents belonging to different domains differs
heavily, but even within a specific domain, terminology,
general wording and sub-languages present very different
characteristics. Consider, for instance, within the medical
domain, genres like scientific literature, drug description
outlets, medical report discharges, clinical proofs results,
social media comments about diseases, and drugs and their
efficiency. The characteristics of the wording used in these
genres are highly diverse. We focus in this article on WP
pages, and the evaluation is made on this kind of document.

(ii) the linguistic units to be tagged. There are two commonly fol-
lowed approaches. Those that tag the entities occurring in
the text and those that tag the mentions of these entities.
Frequently, entities are represented by co-reference chains

of mentions. Consider the following example: ‘‘Asthma is
thought to be caused by. . . Its diagnosis is usually based on
. . . The disease is clinically classified . . .”. In these sentences
there is an entity (asthma) referred three times, and, thus,
forms a co-reference chain of three mentions. In our work,
units to be tagged are terminological string found in WP.
So, the linguistic units are phrases filtered by termhood con-
ditions, i.e. only POS sequences corresponding to valid terms
are allowed. These sequences are language dependent and
correspond to basic (non recursive) noun phrases headed
by a noun.

(iii) the tagset. Frequently the tagset is really a set of categories
with no explicit relations between them. A crucial point is
its granularity (or size). The spectrum of tagset sizes is
immense. Fine-grained tagsets can consist of thousands (as
is the case of WordNet synsets) or even millions (as is the
case of WP pages) of tags. Coarse-grained tagsets contains
only a few tags. In our case, we have used a tagset consisting
of only three tags. Details of the selection are given in
Section 3.2.

Regarding the resources used for the task, curated resources
(terminologies, lexica, ontologies, etc.), such as Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9, ICD-10),1 Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH).2 nomenclature of drugs and their brands
in DrugBank3 and Gray ’s Anatomy,4 etc, are available and are widely
used for this task. However, using these resources is not straightfor-
ward. Some of the terms allow multiple variations5 (not all of them
are collected in the resources) while others (specially the most fre-
quent) are highly ambiguous.6 Besides, recognizing and classifying
the mentions in documents is highly challenging.

An important source of information for tasks similar to ours are
the proceedings of the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, asser-
tions, and relations in clinical text (Uzuner et al., 2010). Within this
contest, Yeganova et al. (2012) uses two rather simple statistical
approaches obtaining good results. Halgrim et al. (2011) and
Uzuner et al. (2010) apply a cascade of classifiers for extracting
medication information from discharge summaries. Our previous
work, Vivaldi and Rodríguez (2015), is similar to that presented
here but limited to English. Another source of information is the
DDI Extraction 2013 (task 9 of Semeval-2013, Segura-Bedmar
et al., 2014). Focusing on a narrower domain, Drug-Drug interac-
tion, the shared task included two challenges: (i) Recognition and
Classification of Pharmacological substances, and (ii) Extraction
and classification of Drug-Drug interactions. The former is clearly
a case of Semantic Tagging, in this case reduced to looking for men-
tions of drugs within biomedical texts, but with a finer granularity
of the tagset, It included drug, brand, group (group of drug names)
and drug-n (active substances not yet approved for human use).

Regarding the techniques involved, many approaches have been
proposed for dealing with Semantic Tagging, such as rule-based
methods and supervised Machine Learning (ML). A common limita-
tion is the dependence on a narrow domain/genre/tagset/language
making its adaptation to other settings highly difficult (and costly).
We faced the adaptation issue by:

2 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh.
3 http://www.drugbank.ca/.
4 http://www.bartleby.com/107/.
5 See for example the English sets [‘‘abdomen”, ‘‘venter”, ‘‘stomach”, ‘‘belly”],

[‘‘fever”, ‘‘pyrexia”, ‘‘febris”] or the set of acronyms [‘‘ADE”, ‘‘ADR”, ‘‘DAR”] all sharing
the meaning of ”adverse drug reaction” but using different wordings.

6 Acronyms is a major source of ambiguity as for example: ‘‘MI” in English can be a
synonym of ‘‘myocardical infartion”, ‘‘mitral insufficiency” or ‘‘mental Illness” while
in Spanish it may refer to ‘‘metabolic index”, ‘‘mesenteric ischemia” or ‘‘menstruation
induction”.
� Using a multilingual setting in which the process in one lan-
guage can help the process in other (usually less resourced)
languages.

� Using a set of wide-coverage domain-free resources for learning
and using a low cost learning method, distant learning. Specifi-
cally we include as resources: SNOMED-CT,7 that is restricted
to the medical domain, and two widely used domain-
independent encyclopaedical ones: WP pages (including data
obtained from Infoboxes) and categories, and DBP.8

Related to Semantic Tagging, the first faced problem and the one
that has attracted more attention is Word Sense Disambiguation. In
Agirre and Edmonds (2006) and Navigli (2009) we can find two
excellent surveys on this issue. A more recent survey, covering
many Semantic Tagging techniques and comparing them, can be
found in Gerber et al. (2011). A unified framework including Word
Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking is presented in Moro et al.
(2014). Wikifiers9 proceed mostly in two steps: candidate detection
and classification/ranking. See Roth et al. (2014) for a recent, excel-
lent and comprehensive analysis. Closely related to wikification is
the task of Entity Linking. This task has got an explosive development
starting with the Entity Linking challenge within the TAC KBP frame-
work,10 from 2010. Overviews of the contests are the main sources of
information: Ji et al. (2010), Ji et al. (2011), James Mayfield and
Artiles (2012), and Mayfield et al. (2013).

English is, by far, the most supported language for biomedical
resources. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) https://www.
nlm.nih.gov/ maintains the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS)11 that groups an important set of resources to facilitate com-
puter systems to ‘‘understand” the meaning of the language of bio-
medicine and health. Only a small fraction of such resources are
available for languages other than English. A relevant aspect of infor-
mation extraction in medicine is the recognition and identification of
biomedical entities (like disease, genes, proteins . . .). Several named
entity recognition (NER) techniques have been proposed to recog-
nize such entities based on their morphosyntactical pattern and con-
text. NER can be used to recognize previously known names and also
new names, but cannot be directly used to relate these names to
specific biomedical entities found in external databases. For this
identification task, a dictionary approach is necessary. A problem
is that existing dictionaries often are incomplete and different vari-
ations may be found in the literature; therefore it is necessary to
minimize this issue as much as possible. Regarding Arabic NER, a
good reference is Benajiba et al. (2010). There are a number of tools
that take profit of the UMLS resources. Some of the more relevant are
Metamap (Aronson and Lang, 2010) and Whatizit (Rebholz-
Schuhmann et al., 2008). Cotik et al. (2015) uses RadLex to detect
concepts in radiology reports written in Spanish.
3. Methodology

3.1. Outline

This paper, as most of the systems showed in Section 2 proposes
a ML solution to a tagging task. Therefore, it requires two main
steps: training and annotation (see Fig. 1). The main drawback of
this type of solutions is the dependency on annotated documents,
which usually are hard to obtain. Our main target in this research is

13 See Vivaldi and Rodríguez (2010) for details about the way of obtaining such

to train a classifier minimizing the impact of this issue and keeping
good results.

For such a purpose we use as learning examples -within the dis-
tant learning paradigm- a set of seed words obtained with a mini-
mal human supervision. As mentioned in Section 1, we use
domain-independent Knowledge Sources as WP, and DBP. The rea-
sons for this choice are: (i) they provide good interlingual linking
and (ii) although domain-independent, they provide a nice cover-
age of the medical domain, including links to codified datasets.
Besides, we include SNOMED-CT because of (i) its rich coverage of
a high variety of medical entities and (ii) a well-founded taxonomic
class organization.

The overall architecture of our system is shown in Fig. 1.
The process of Semantic Tagging is carried out by a module

shown in the bottom of the figure. The process consists of the per-
formance of a set of binary classifiers (one for each class in the tag-
set and for each language) followed by meta-classifiers (one for
each language) that combines the results of the binary classifiers.

The training of the binary classifiers is performed using a distant
learning approach from the three Knowledge Sources.

For English all the processes are easier because of the direct
availability of all the Knowledge Sources. For other languages the
process is more complex due to the limitation of Knowledge Sources
(some languages, specially Arabic, lack some of the resources or
have smaller coverage). In such cases, We performed cross-
lingual mappings. The results of different learning processes
clearly depend on the size and quality of the training material.

Besides the initial assignment of seed terms corresponding to
WP categories to SNOMED-CT classes no manual intervention was
needed. It is worth noting that, only seed terms that have associ-
ated WP pages are considered. The results, so, are sets of WP pages
to be used for learning the classifiers.

Fig. 2 depicts an overall view of the learning components
(occurring in the top of Fig. 1). As can be seen, the system proceeds
in three steps: (i) building the base tagset and the set of relevant
WP categories, this process is further detailed in Sections 3.2 and
3.3, (ii) selecting the seedterms for learning, expanded in Fig. 3
and explained in detail in Section 3.4, and (iii) Learning the binary
classifiers and the metaclassifiers. The classification component of
the system (bottom of Fig. 1) is expanded in Fig. 4.

3.2. Selection of the tagset

Our tagset consists of the three most populated categories from
the 19 top categories in the class structure of SNOMED-CT. In the
rest of the article we refer to these categories as BP (Body Part),
DRUG, and DISEASE. We have used SNOMED-CT for English
(although there exist, too, a partial version for Spanish and a pro-
prietary version for French). Using BioPortal SPARQL endpoint12

we have extracted the top categories, and from them the set of terms
12 http://sparql.bioontology.org/.
under each one. For all the languages we have collected the set of
translations (using DBP) and we have filtered out the terms not exist-
ing in the corresponding WP (as page or as category). We have
selected for our experiments the three categories having a higher
coverage considering all the languages.

3.3. Defining the initial set of relevant WP categories

Although our distant learning approach for obtaining additional
training material is based on three Knowledge Sources, (WP, DBP,
and SNOMED-CT) using, when needed, their interlingual capabili-
ties, a previous step, limited to the English WP has to be carried
out and its results are used for processing the other Knowledge
Source.

Following the approach described in Vivaldi and Rodríguez
(2010), that automatically extracts scored lists of terms from both
WP pages titles and WP categories titles, we got the set of the most
reliableWP categories.13 This resulted on a set of 239 WP categories.
We manually assigned to such categories a unique SNOMED-CT class.
Let us denote Catswp:enclass Cats

wp:en
BP ;Cats

wp:en
DRUG ; and Cats

wp:en
DISEASE

these sets.

We take profit of the graph structure of WP. WP consists basically of
two graphs, the page graph and the category graph. In the former the
nodes are WP pages while in the later the nodes are WP categories.
Edges consist of WP links. We consider three types of links: page-
category (categories to which one page belongs), category-page
(pages corresponding to a given category) and category-category
(super and sub categories of a given one). We compute the score
of a page from the scores of the categories it belongs to, and the score
of a category from the scores of the pages belonging to it). In this
way, using an iterative procedure, good pages reinforce their cate-
gories and good categories their pages.

3.4. Obtaining the seed terms for each tag and language

To obtain the seed terms needed for learning the classifiers, we
proceed in four ways, using our three Knowledge Sources (see He
et al. (2011) and Yeganova et al. (2012) for analysis of these and
other resources used for similar purposes). The process is shown
in Fig. 3. The following Knowledge Sources have been used:

� WP, although being a general purpose resource, it densely cov-
ers the medical domain. English WP contains terminological
units from multiple medical thesauri and ontologies, as pointed
out above. The current full coverage of the four WP used in our
research are14: 5,093,100 pages for the English WP, 410,657
pages for the Arabic WP, 1,730,505 pages for the French WP,
and 1,198,094 pages for the Spanish WP.
categories from WP resources. The system provides terms corresponding to both WP
pages and categories, but we use here only the later.

� DBP is one of the central linked data dataset in Linked Open
Data (LOD). It currently contains more than 3.5 million things,
and 1 billion RDF (Resource Description Framework) triples
with a nice coverage of the medical domain. Unfortunately
there is not DBP for Arabic and, so, for this language instances
from this source have to be collected indirectly (through the
existence of Arabic labels, i.e. labels consisting of a string suf-
fixed with @ar, attached to DBP resources in the available DBPs).

� SNOMED-CT, with more than 350,000 concepts, 950,000 English
descriptions (concept names) and 1,300,000 relationships is the
largest single vocabulary ever integrated into UMLS.15 The basic
SNOMED-CT source, and the only used in our work, is in English.

Our system is based on Vivaldi and Rodríguez (2010) and
Vivaldi and Rodríguez (2015) extending the later reference, that
was restricted to English, for working in a multilingual setting.
15 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/.
Our aim is to collect medical terminologies for the semantic classes
and languages involved. The process is as follows:

1. As said in Section 3.3, for each semantic class a set Catswp:enclass of
relevant categories of English WP has been collected.

2. From each of these Catswp:enclass sets we obtain the set of WP pages
and we remove the pages corresponding to more than one set.
We refer to these sets as Pageswp:enclass (Pages

wp:en
BP ; Pages

wp:en
DRUG , and

Pageswp:enDISEASE). These three sets are our first collection of domain
terms.

3. From each of the three Pageswp:enclass collections we collect all the
WP infoboxes and infobox slots.16 We manually selected the
structured information. The most popular way of composing and including this kind
of information is using predefined templates attached to some categories. These
structures are named infoboxes and their items infobox slots. For instance, the disease
infobox contains slots for ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, MeSH entries, UMLS CUI, etc.

pairs hinfobox, sloti: specific for the corresponding class. We then
collected all the pages owning any of these pairs, resulting on the

second collection of domain terms, Pagesinfobox:enclass .
4. The third collection of domain terms was obtained from

SNOMED-CT. We selected the set of terms under the three top
classes of SNOMED-CT class structure, Clinical Finding/Disorder,
Body_structure, and Pharmaceutical/biological product that can
be mapped into our own classes. From the set retrieved from
SNOMED-CT only the terms existing in WP have been collected,
resulting in Pagessn:enclass .

17

5. The last source of classified medical terms (and the most pro-
ductive) is DBP. For accessing DBP data we used the DBpedia
Sparql endpoint18 that allows an easy way of building the queries
and an efficient way of accessing the data. Using as seed terms
the members of Pageswp:enclass we collected the most useful predicates
(balancing their coverage and specificity) and obtained the set of
subjects in the rdf triples involving such predicates. In this way

we collected our fourth set of medical terms, Pagesdbp:enclass . See
Vivaldi and Rodríguez (2015) for details of this process.

6. We then get the union of the four datasets procured in previous

steps. We have, so, the three sets Pagesall:enclass . For each page we
computed a purity score, i.e. a score ranging in [0,1] measuring
the confidence of the page belonging to its corresponding
SNOMED-CT class. Specifically we define a purity measure of a
page as the inverse of the number of semantic tags to which
their categories belong. So, as in our work we use three seman-
tic tags, the purity ranges from 1/3 to 1. If all the WP categories
are mapped to a unique semantic tag the purity is 1.

7. From the sets Pagesall:enclass and the use of English DBpedia labels we
obtained the corresponding translated terms, if existing, to Ara-

bic, French, and Spanish, Pagesall:arclass ; Pages
all:fr
class, and Pages

all:sp
class .

8. Using the English DBP, French DBP, and Spanish DBP labels, we
enriched the corresponding sets in the other languages, includ-
ing Arabic. The way of enriching a set of terms for a target lan-
guage comes from the presence in a DBP resource for another
17 It is worth noting that although terms coming from SNOMED-CT not existing in
WP are filtered out, some of the remaining terms could be new (not detected
previously by the other methods) because the way of selection is different.
18 http://dbpedia.org/sparql.
source language of a label for the target. As there is no DBP
for Arabic, this language cannot contribute to enriching the
others but only takes profit of the other languages’ enrichment.

9. We iterate the two last steps until no more terms are found. The
final figures for the four languages and three semantic classes
can be found in Table 1.

Not all the methods for selecting the seedwords perform
equally for the different semantic tags and languages. It is worth
noting that more than a half of the seedwords used for learning
have been selected by the DBP source. For instance, for Arabic
and for the tag BP about 60% of the seedterms (1077) come from
DBP (657 against 420). As the seedwords sizes for Arabic are smal-
ler, not using DBP seeds can result on small datasets (taking into
account, too, that some of the WP pages are filtered out, and that
only pages with purity 1 are used). So although probably for Eng-
lish we have enough training material without using DBP, for the
other languages, specially for Arabic, DBP data have to be used.
3.5. Learning the classifiers

Following Huang and Riloff (2010), for each semantic class and
language we generate training instances by automatically labelling
each mention of a seed term with its designated semantic class.
The core idea of our approach is that for each seed term t of a class
tag, all the mentions of t in its WP page can be considered positive
examples for learning the class tag. For each mention we create
feature vectors for the classifiers, the seeds themselves are hidden
and only contextual features are used to represent each training
instance. Proceeding in this way the classifier is forced to general-
ize with limited overfitting.

We created a suite of binary contextual classifiers, one for each
semantic class and language. The classifiers are learned using, as in
Huang and Riloff (2010), SVM models using Weka toolkit (Hall
et al., 2009). Each classifier makes a scored decision as to whether
a term belongs or not to its semantic class. Examples for learning
correspond to the mentions of the seed terms in the corresponding
WP pages. Let x1; x2; . . . ; xn be the seed terms for the semantic class
tag. For each xi we obtain its WP page and we extract all the men-
tions of seed terms occurring in the page. Positive examples corre-
spond to mentions of seed terms corresponding to semantic class

tag while negative examples correspond to seed terms from other
semantic classes. Frequently, a positive example occurs within the
text of the page but often many other positive and negative exam-
ples occur as well. We have analyzed the average distribution of
positive and negative terms for all the languages and semantic
tags. The results are depicted in Table 2. As can be seen, for most
languages and classes the number of examples (positive and nega-
tive) for training is high and well balanced. Features are simply
words occurring in the local context of mentions.

The corpus of each semantic class and language is divided into
training and test sections. For processing the full corpus we use a
linguistic processor to identify content words in each sentence
and create feature vectors that represent each constituent in the
sentence. For each example, the feature vector captures a context
window of n words to its left and right19 without surpassing sen-
tence limits. The linguistic processing includes sentence splitting,
tokenizing, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition. For English,
French, and Spanish Freeling toolbox20 (Padró et al., 2012) has been
used to perform this task. For Arabic we have used Madamira21

(Pasha et al., 2014).
For evaluation we usedWP categories - SNOMED-CT classesman-

ually annotated mappings as gold standard as explained in Sec-
tion 3.3. We considered for each semantic class tag a gold
standard set including all the WP pages with purity 1, i.e. those
pages unambiguously mapped to tag. The accuracy of the corre-
sponding classifier is measured against this gold standard set.

We proceed with the sets of seed terms (one set for each
semantic class and language) collected as described in Section 3.4,

i.e. Pageswp:ltag , for tag 2 fBP;DRUG;DISEASEg and l 2 far; en; fr; eng.
Some of the WP pages corresponding to the selected terms are
removed due to: (i) having less than 100 words, (ii) difficulties in
extracting useful plain text (pages consisting mainly of itemized
lists, formulas, links, and so) and (iii) having purity lower than 1.

The whole set of seed terms for every category tag (see Table 1)
was split in two sections: training and test. Each section has been
limited to 500 WP pages. The whole set of training documents was
used, regardless the origin of its members, although, obviously,
most of the mentions of a seed term occur within the documents
associated to its origin. For learning a binary classifier for a seman-
tic class tag, all the mentions of all the seed terms of tag within all
the training documents are triggers for a positive example while all
the mentions of all the seed terms of tag’, for tag – tag0 , are trig-
gers of negative examples. Following Huang and Riloff (2010), each

example is represented as a n-dimension binary vector where
dimensions correspond to lemmas of content words occurring in
the context of each trigger. Contexts correspond to windows (lim-
ited to size 3) of words surrounding the mentions without surpass-
ing sentence limits.
4. Experimental framework

We have applied the method described here to the three
semantic categories and four languages. Let l be the language and

tag the semantic category. For each seed term tag in Pageswp:ltag we
obtain its corresponding WP page and, after cleaning, POS tagging,
and sentence segmenting, we extracted all the mentions (compli-
ant with termhood condition). For each mention the vector of fea-
tures is built and the three learned binary classifiers corresponding
to l are applied to it. If none of the classifiers classifies the instance
as belonging to the corresponding semantic class no answer is
returned. If only one of the classifiers classifies positively the
instance, the corresponding class is returned. Otherwise a combi-
nation step has to be carried out. For combining the results of
the binary classifiers two methods have been implemented:

� Best Result. This method returns the class of the best scored
individual result of the binary classifiers.

� Meta-classifier. A SVM multiclass classifier is trained using as
features the results of the basic binary classifiers together with
the context data already used in the basic classifiers. The result-
ing class is returned.
5. Results

Table 3 depicts the global results obtained for English when
applying both combination methods for the three knowledge
sources extracted.22 As it can be seen, using the meta-classifier
slightly outperforms the best score method. Using DB as source of
seed words consistently outperforms the other sources. For the other
languages we have used for learning the union of the seedwords
coming from all the resources.

The global results are presented in Table 4. As can be observed,
there is a severe drop in accuracy for languages other than English.
The reasons could be due to:
22 Reported values are an average over the results for each SNOMED-CT class. Actual
values, for the case of SNOMED-CT only seed terms, range among 73.0–94.8
(precision) and 67.1–93.6 (recall).

� The differences in size of the training material as shown in
Table 1.

� The differences in WP coverage pointed out is Section 3.4.
� The degradation of data quality resulting from the cross-lingual
mappings that never can be considered error free.

� The differences in accuracy of the linguistic processors for the
different languages involved.

It is worth noting that Arabic results slightly outperforms Span-
ish ones despite the lower size of the training material andWP cov-
erage. This is due to the excellent performance of Arabic classifier
for DISEASE class probably due to the quality of these annotations
in WP medical pages.

It is difficult to compare our results with other state-of-the-art
systems performing the same task because of the lack of gold stan-
dard datasets and the differences on used tagsets and languages. To
our knowledge, WP pages have not been used previously as gold
standard for this task. A shallow comparison could be carried out
for English with the Concept Extraction task of the 2010 i2b2/VA
challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text,
Uzuner et al. (2010) and with the DDI Extraction 2013 (task 9 of
Semeval-2013, Segura-Bedmar et al. (2014), both sketched in Sec-
tion 2. This informal comparison is just for seeing whether our
results can be placed within the state-of-the-art ranges for similar
tasks. In the case of 2010 i2b2/VA the results of the three best
scored systems range from 0.78 to 0.85. Our results (0.94) clearly
outperform these ones. In the case of DDI for entity tagging, the fig-
ures of the three best scored systems range from.51 to 0.83 for
DrugBank data and from 0.37 to 0.56 for Medline data, closer to
our genre. In this case the comparison should be performed with
our results on DRUG classifier (0.71). Once again our results seem
to outperform the ones obtained in this contest. Although to be
fair, and lacking a direct comparison, we simply can say that our
results can be considered state-of-the-art. For French also a shal-
low comparison could be made with the CLEF eHealth201523 con-
test, task 1b (Clinical Named Entity Recognition) (Neveol et al.,
2015). In this case the results range from 0.70 to 0.76 while ours
were of 0.75. To be fair we should point out that the task in this case
was clearly more challenging than our (it consisted on 10 UMLS cat-
egories detection and classification task). Unfortunately no way of
evaluation even shallow can be made for Arabic and Spanish (the
results of Cotik et al. (2015) are not comparable since the task is
slightly different).

6. Conclusions and further work

We have presented a system that automatically detects and
tags medical terms that correspond to WP pages found in WP
pages. The tagset used, consisting of three categories, is derived
from SNOMED-CT taxonomy. The system has been applied to four
languages including Arabic. The results, although not directly com-
parable with other approaches, seem to reach at least state-of-the-
art accuracy (compared with best systems in related contests). A
relevant benefit of this approach is that the effort for obtaining
positive/negative examples for training has been reduced to a
minimum.

Some of the tools used in this experimentation are for general
purpose. Their performance may not be appropriate for some med-
ical terms (ex. 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol or 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropyl
xanthine, among others) due to the intrinsic complexity of such
terms and the difficulty in processing such terms with standard
NLP tools. We plan to introduce some improvement in our tools
or use already existing/available specialized tools, such as Meta-
map (Aronson and Lang, 2010).

Several lines of research will be followed in the next future.

� The main limitation of our system is that training and testing
data of the ML algorithm is only based on WP pages. The use
of data provided by the Concept Extraction task of the 2010
i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clin-
ical text will be considered for training and test sets. Our aim is
to build a system robust enough to be applied to more challeng-
ing genres, as Electronic Health Reports.

� As our results are based on three knowledge sources, an obvious
way of possible improvement is the combination and/or the
specialization of the resources for learning more accurate clas-
sifiers. Specially extending the capabilities of DBP seems to be
a good research direction.

� Using a finer grained tagset and including more challenging cat-
egories (as symptoms, clinical findings, procedures, impair-
ments, . . .).

� Moving from semantic tagging of medical entities to semantic
tagging of relations between such entities is a highly exciting
objective, in the line of recent challenges in the medical domain
(and beyond).
