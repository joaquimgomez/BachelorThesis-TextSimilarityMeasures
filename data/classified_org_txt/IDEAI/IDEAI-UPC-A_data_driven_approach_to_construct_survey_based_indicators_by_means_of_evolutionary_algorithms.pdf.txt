1 Introduction 

 

Tendency surveys ask agents about whether they expect a variable to rise, to fall, or to 

remain unchanged. Individual answers are aggregated as percentages of the respondents 

in each category. The qualitative nature of survey results has led to quantify agents’ 

responses by means of survey indicators. The most used indicator to present survey results 

is the balance statistic. Anderson (1951, 1952) defined the balance statistic as the 

difference between the percentage of agents reporting an increase and the percentage 

reporting a decrease. As the balance statistic does not take into account the percentage of 

respondents expecting a variable to remain unchanged, Claveria (2010) proposed a 

variation of the balance statistic that accounts for the percentage of respondents reporting 

a “no change”, and therefore allows discriminating between two equal values of the 

balance statistic depending on the percentage of respondents expecting a variable to 

remain constant. By matching firm-level responses and outcomes, Müller (2010) found 

that the median of the “no change” category was equal to zero. Abberger (2007) used 

probit analysis to estimate a quantitative threshold for employment expectations that 

allows to differentiate between a decrease and an increase in actual employment. Van den 

Berg et al. (2006) discussed implications for standard methods to deal with non-response 

bias. 

The balance statistic has been widely used to test economic hypothesis (Girardi 2014; 

Jean-Baptiste 2012, Zárate et al. 2012; Schmeling and Schrimpf 2011; Jonsson and 

Österholm 2011, 2012; Paloviita 2006; Pesaran and Weale 2006; Lemmens et al. 2005 

2008; Pehkonen 1992; Ivaldi 1992; Batchelor and Dua 1992; Ilmakunnas 1989; Pesaran 

1984, 1985, 1987). Balances have also been used as explanatory variables in economic 

models (Altug and Çakmakli 2016; Guizzardi and Stacchini 2015; Martinsen et al. 2014; 

Ghonghadze and Lux 2012; Robinzonov et al. 2012; Lui et al. 2011a, 2011b; Schmeling 

and Schrimpf 2011; Franses et al. 2011; Klein and Özmucur 2010; Graff 2010; Claveria 

et al. 2007; Abberger 2007; Mitchell et al. 2005a; Hansson et al. 2005; Mittnik and 

Zadrozny 2005; Batchelor and Dua 1998; Kauppi et al. 1996; Parigi and Schlitzer 1995; 

Bergström 1995; Rahiala and Teräsvirta 1993; Biart and Praet 1987). 

The balance statistic can be regarded as a qualitative measure of the average changes 

expected in a variable. As a result, numerous methods to transform balances into 

quantitative indicators have been proposed in the literature. Based on the assumption that

respondents report a variable to go up (or down) if the mean of their subjective probability 

distribution lies above (or below) a threshold level, Theil (1952) proposed the probability 

approach. This threshold is known as the indifference interval. Carlson and Parkin (1975) 

applied the method by using a normal distribution together with symmetric and constant 

threshold parameters across respondents and over time. Extensions of this framework are 

mainly focused on reducing the measurement error introduced by incorrect assumptions 

(Lahiri and Zhao 2015; Breitung and Schmeling 2013; Mitchell et al. 2002; Löffler 1999; 

Berk 1999; Smith and McAleer 1995; Dasgupta and Lahiri 1992; Kariya 1990; Batchelor 

and Orr 1988; Seitz, 1987; Pesaran 1984; Batchelor 1982, 1986; Toyoda 1979). By means 

of Monte Carlo simulations, Terai (2009) and Löffler (1999) estimated the measurement 

error introduced by the probabilistic method. See Vermeulen (2014), Driver and Urga 

(2004), and Nardo (2003) for a review of the different quantification methods. 

Matching firm-level responses to quantitative realizations, several authors have also 

developed extensions of the probability approach. In a recent study, Lahiri and Zhao 

(2015) have proposed a generalization of the probability approach that allows time-

varying and heterogeneous thresholds. Müller (2010) developed a variant of the 

probability method assuming asymmetric and time invariant thresholds based on the 

“conditional absolute null” empirical property that the median of realized quantitative 

values corresponding to the “no change” category is zero. The main advantage of this 

procedure is that it solved the zero response problem. Also based on firm-level responses, 

Mitchell et al. (2002) developed a survey-based indicator. For an appraisal of individual 

firm data on expectations see Zimmermann (1997). 

Agents’ responses are also used to construct composite indicators based on survey 

results. Examples are the Consumer Confidence Indicator (Białowolski 2015; Gelper et 

al. 2007), and the Economic Sentiment Indicator (Gelper and Christophe 2010) 

constructed by the European Commission (European Economy, 2014) by aggregating the 

sectoral indicators (Frale et al. 2010; Taylor and McNabb 2007). Re-scaling individual 

replies by means of a grading procedure, the Ifo Institute for Economic Research 

elaborate the Economic Climate Index (ECI) (CESifo World Economic Survey, 2011), 

which is an aggregate indicator obtained as the arithmetic mean of two questions from 

the World Economic Survey (WES). Camacho and Perez-Quiros (2010) used the Ifo 

Business Climate Index (IBCI) and the ESI to forecast economic growth in the Euro-area. 

Robinzonov et al. (2012) used the IBCI and other aggregate indicators from surveys as 

exogenous variable for industrial production forecasting. 



 3 

There are many studies analysing the relationship between survey data and 

macroeconomic variables (Mokinski et al. 2015; Dees and Brinca 2013; Leduc and Sill 

2013; Lui et al. 2011a, 2011b; Zanin 2010; Gelper and Croux 2007, 2010; Claveria et al. 

2007; Abberger 2007; Nolte and Pohlmeier 2007; Cotsomitis and Kwan 2006; Mitchell 

et al. 2005a, 2005b), but this is the first study to link both sources of information by means 

of symbolic regression (SR) to derive a leading economic indicator. As far as we know, 

this is the first attempt at designing an empirically generated SR-based indicator. We use 

genetic programming (GP) to infer building blocks that relate the answers of the surveys 

to the actual evolution of GDP. This data-driven approach allows to identify the optimal 

combinations of a wide range of survey variables that best fits the evolution of GDP. 

In this study we aim to break new ground by presenting a novel method to design 

data-driven composite indicators. We use quarterly survey data from the WES to 

construct an economic indicator to track the evolution of GDP. The dataset is composed 

of twelve survey variables for twenty-eight countries of the OECD. The proposed 

methodology is based on evolutionary computation and SR. Through Darwinian 

competition, the algorithm derives a set of mathematical functional forms that 

approximate a predefined target variable. These models of interaction between variables 

can be regarded as the set of the fittest empirically-generated indicators, which are in turn 

used as building blocks to construct a survey-based economic indicator. 

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the data and our 

methodological approach. In Section 3 we present the empirical results. Finally, 

conclusions are given in Section 4. 

 

 

2 Data and Methods 

 

In this study we link agent’s expectations from the WES in 28 countries of the OECD to 

year-on-year growth rates of real GDP for the period comprised between the second 

quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2014. The WES assesses worldwide economic 

trends by polling professionals and experts on current economic developments in their 

respective countries (Kudymowa et al. 2013). Białowolski (2016) points out that 

professional respondents are characterized by significantly lower biases in responding to 

survey questions than consumers, who are prone to a negative response pattern.

Respondents are asked to express their present judgement, their assessment compared 

to the same time last year, and their expectation by the end of the next six months with 

respect to a wide range of variables (capital expenditures, private consumption, foreign 

trade, inflation, interest rates, share prices, etc.). 

The Ifo uses a grading procedure consisting in assigning a grade of nine to positive 

replies, of five to indifferent replies, and of one to negative replies. This procedure is 

conceptually equal to calculating balances. Aggregation is based on country 

classifications, so that the country results are weighted according its share of exports and 

imports in total world trade (CESifo World Economic Survey, 2011). Henzel and 

Wollmershäuser (2005), Stangl (2007, 2008) and Hutson et al. (2014) provide a detailed 

analysis of WES data. 

In this study we use the Ifo statistic with respect to twelve variables: 

 The judgement about the present economic situation regarding:  

o the overall economy ( 1x ) 

o capital expenditures ( 2x ) 

o private consumption ( 3x ). 

 The assessment of the economic situation compared to the same time last year 

regarding: 

o the overall economy ( 4x ) 

o capital expenditures ( 5x ) 

o private consumption ( 6x ) 

 The expected economic situation by the end of the next six months regarding: 

o the overall economy ( 7x ) 

o capital expenditures ( 8x ) 

o private consumption ( 9x ) 

o exports ( 10x ) 

o imports ( 11x ) 

o balance of trade ( 12x ) 

The ECI is an aggregate indicator obtained as the arithmetic mean of assessments of 

the general economic situation and the expectations for the economic situation in the next 

six months. The ECI tends to correlate closely with the actual business-cycle trend 

measured in annual growth rates of real GDP (Garnitz et al., 2015). In Table 1 we present 

a descriptive analysis of the ECI for the ten European economies evaluated in this study.

The analysis conducted in this study links WES variables to GDP data retrieved 

from the OECD web (https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart). We 

use year-on-year growth rates of quarterly GDP as a yardstick in order to derive 

functional forms that can be regarded as proxies of economic growth. The model does 

not consider dynamics, and the goal is not prediction. The main objective of this 

research is to present a data-driven approach to design a composite survey-based 

indicator. The proposed procedure allows us to identify a set of optimal combinations of 

a wide range of survey variables to track the evolution of GDP. 

As there is an arbitrary functional relationship between the set of survey variables, we 

link them to the actual percentage growth rate of GDP by means of a SR model: 

 ititititititititititititit xxxxxxxxxxxxfy 12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1  

where 
itit xx 12,,1   are the WES variables as published by the Ifo, and ity  is a scalar 

referring to the year-on-year growth rate of quarterly GDP for country i  at time t . 

SR is an empirical modelling approach that does not rely on a specific a priori 

determined model structure. SR finds the optimal combination of variables from a space 

of all algebraic expressions defined by a set of given operations and functions. Koza 

(1992) was the first to apply GP in the solution of SR problems. GP was developed by 

Cramer (1985), and can be regarded as an extension of genetic algorithms (GAs). GP 

belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which were introduced by Holland 

(1975). See Zelinka (2015), Fogel (2006), and Goldberg (1989) for applications and a 

comprehensive overview. 

https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart


 6 

Due to its flexibility, empirical modelling with SR is starting to be applied in 

economics. Kotanchek et al. (2010) used SR to detect outliers and identify models in large 

public datasets. Álvarez-Díaz and Álvarez (2005) made use of GP to generate predictions 

of exchange rates. Kronberger et al. (2011) used SR to estimate US inflation based on the 

identified variable interactions in a large dataset of economic indicators. Kľúčik (2012) 

combined SR with GP in the estimation of foreign trade to Slovakia. Acosta-González et 

al. (2012) apply GP to select the best econometric model for explaining the severity of 

the 2008 crisis. Yang et al. (2015) used SR to forecast oil production. 

In this study we propose a method to construct survey-based indicators making use 

of a SR-based approach. By means of GP we infer a set of building blocks that relate the 

answers of the respondents to the evolution of GDP. The set of predetermined primitive 

functions limits the possible types of derived functional relationships. To simplify the 

analysis, we restricted the number of primitive functions on the survey variables to the 

mean, the maximum, the minimum, the ratio, and the logarithm. This set of functions 

are applied to the WES variables as they are published by the Ifo. 

To control for the growth in complexity of the SR functions, we introduced a term 

that penalized the functions with a complexity in the cost function. We penalized the 

absolute number of terms on the expression. The penalization term can either be on the 

number of terms or on the depth of the syntactic trees. Empirically, we found that the 

restriction on the depth of the syntactic trees excluded reasonable solutions in which the 

concatenation of different functions had sense, so we decided to penalize the absolute 

number of terms on the expression. The penalization for expressions with more than 20 

terms was linear with the number of terms, with a slope that was determined 

heuristically as an increase of 10% in the error for each additional term. This procedure 

allowed us to obtain two or three levels of nested expressions. 

As in one run of the GP algorithm the returned functions in the last generation tend 

to be highly correlated with each other, the selection process was undertaken in several 

independent runs of the simulation. On the one hand, components which had no 

economic sense were rejected. On the other hand, using as a criterion the correlation 

coefficients between the elements of the population and the dependent variable, we 

selected the components present in the top elements of the estimated populations of five 

different runs. Finally, we linearly combined these building blocks to generate an 

indicator of economic growth. See Dabhi and Chaudhary (2015) for an overview of GP 

issues.

The implementation of GP for SR can be summarized in the following steps: 

1. Creation of an initial population.- We determined a population size of 1000 

programs. 

2. Evaluation of fitness.- For each member of the population, an error metric is 

calculated. We used the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a fitness function. 

3. Selection for reproduction.- From the existing strategies for the selection of parents 

for replacement, we used the tournament method so as to guarantee diversity in the 

population. 

4. Application of genetic operators.- The main genetic operations are reproduction 

(copy), crossover (recombination of randomly chosen parts of parents), and 

mutation (randomly altering a part of a parent). Once the probability of a new 

generation (reproduction and mutation probabilities) is determined, operators are 

applied to the parents selected on the basis of the fitness function. We have selected 

a 0.1 probability. 

5. Determination of constants.- GP can be complemented with an optimization of the 

set of constants after a number of generations to avoid the search path to deviate 

from the optimum, given by the best possible correlation relative to both functional 

form and the constants. We included the automatic generation of constants provided 

by the GA. 

6. Creation of a new population.- Steps three and four are repeated until a new 

generation is built. If no individual in the population has a required minimal fitness, 

or any other stopping criterion is fulfilled, everything is repeated from the second 

step onwards using the new generation as the population. Consequently, the fitness 

of the population is ever increasing. We have chosen a maximum number of 150 

generations as as stopping criterion. 

In this study we have used the open source Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms 

Package (DEAP) framework implemented in Python (Fortin et al. 2012; Gong et al. 

2015).

These expressions, which can be regarded as proxies of economic growth, are linearly 

combined to construct a composite economic indicator. As we have used the same model 

for all countries, we compare the performance of the proposed indicator in ten European 

economies: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, 

Portugal and Spain. 

In Fig. 1 we compare the evolution of the proposed SR-based indicator to that of the 

scaled CESIfo’s ECI and the year-on-year growth rates of GDP in the ten European 

economies analysed. Both indicators show a similar pattern of evolution. Nevertheless, 

we want to note that the the ECI is not tuned to fit the evolution of GDP. Regarding the 

differences across the analysed economies, we observe that in Belgium and Spain the 

survey-based indicator seems to lead turning points, especially with respect to the 2008 

financial crisis. Part of this pattern could be attributed to the fact that official quantitative 

information on GDP is usually available with a delay with respect to survey information, 

and this effect was not accounted for. In the other eight countries, the co-movements 

between both series seem to be contemporary. As a rule, the proposed indicator seems to 

correlate closely with the actual oscillations of GDP.

 10 

Next, we evaluate the performance of the proposed indicator to track the evolution of 

GDP. We use the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) statistic proposed by Hyndman 

and Koehler (2006), which scales the errors by the in-sample MAE obtained with a 

random walk. As survey data refer to expectations, and are available ahead of the 

publication of quantitative official data, we use two-step ahead naïve forecasts as a 

benchmark. The MASE is an accuracy measure independent of the scale of the data 

(Hyndman and Koehler 2006). Another advantage of the MASE is that it is easy to 

interpret: values larger than one are indicative that the survey-based indicator is 

outperformed by the average prediction computed in-sample with the benchmark model.

Notes: * MASE stands for the Mean Absolute Scaled Error. In this study we propose scaling the errors 

by the in-sample MAE obtained with the Naïve method for two-step ahead forecasts (as official data are 

published with a delay of more than a quarter with respect to survey data). Values larger than one (in bold) 

indicate worse predictions than the average forecast computed in-sample with the Naïve method. 

 

In Table 3 we observe differences in the performance of the proposed indicator across 

countries. Greece and Spain are the only economies in which the naïve model used as a 

benchmark outperforms the proposed indicator. Greece is the country that presents the 

highest standard errors. 



 11 

 Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014) found that the crisis influenced the 

forecasting performance of survey-based measures. Hence, in order to assess the effect of 

the financial crisis on the accuracy of the proposed indicator, we re-compute the MASE 

differentiating between the pre-crisis subperiod (2000-2006), the crisis (2007-2010), and 

the post-crisis subperiod. When we divide the sample period in three subperiods, we 

observe a deterioration in the predictive performance of of survey-based measures of 

economic growth. The only two exceptions are Spain and Ireland, where there has been 

an improvement with respect to the pre-crisis period. During the crisis, standard errors 

are higher in all economies, being Ireland the country displaying the highest values, while 

Austria the one with the most accurate estimates with respect to the benchmark. 

These results are in line with those of Białowolski (2015), who evaluated the 

consumer confidence indicator in Poland, and found that consistency of responses 

decreased in periods with more changes in the economic environment. The author 

proposed an alternative set of survey variables to calculate both indicators but did not find 

significant improvements in forecast accuracy. 

However, our results contrasts with those obtained for Central and Eastern European 

economies by Claveria et al. (2016) and Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014). Claveria 

et al. (2016) found an improvement in the capacity of agents’ expectations in ten Central 

and Eastern European countries to anticipate economic growth after the crisis. Similarly, 

Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014) analysed twenty European countries, 

differentiating between advanced and transition economies, and found evidence that the 

2008 financial crisis period led to a decrease in expectational errors in transition 

economies. Kauppi et al. (1996) found that the importance of business survey information 

increased during recession periods, as they obtained a significant improvement in 

prediction accuracy after taking account of relevant business survey information during 

Finland’s great depression. 

 

 

4 Conclusions 

 

Survey data on expectations is increasingly used to assess the current state of the 

economy. Survey expectations are based on the knowledge of the respondents operating 

in the market and provide detailed information about a wide range of variables. Many 

methods have been proposed to aggregate survey variables, nevertheless there is no

consensus on the most appropriated method. In this paper we present a data-driven 

approach to generate a survey-based indicator. This empirical method for aggregating 

expectational variables presents several advantages. On the one hand, the proposed 

indicator is assumption-free. On the other hand, this approach is especially suited for 

working with large data sets. 

By means of symbolic regression via genetic programming we derive a set of 

functional forms, or building blocks, that link survey expectations of the World Economic 

Survey and economic growth. By linearly combining these expressions, we construct an 

economic indicator to track the evolution of GDP growth. When comparing the evolution 

of the proposed survey-based indicator to an aggregate economic indicator constructed 

from the same data source, we find that they both show a similar pattern of evolution. 

Finally, we assess the forecasting performance of the proposed indicator to trace year-on-

year growth rates of GDP, and we find that in eight out of ten European economies, the 

proposed indicator outperforms the benchmark. 

Due to the novelty of this approach, there are still several limitations to be addressed. 

As we use a data-driven method, the obtained indicator lacks any theoretical background. 

The implemented algorithm searches the most relevant variables to be included and 

determines how to combine them according to a prefixed criteria. By extending the 

analysis to other questionnaires, we could examine to what extent the obtained functional 

forms are extensive to different survey data. Another issue left for further research is 

testing whether the updates of GDP may have an effect on the results from a nowcasting 

perspective. Another question to be considered in further research is whether the 

implementation of alternative evolutionary algorithms may improve the forecasting 

accuracy of symbolic regression-based indicators.
