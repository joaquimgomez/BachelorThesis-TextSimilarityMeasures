Abstract This paper considers the problem of finding suitable sites for wind farms in a region7
of Catalonia (Spain). The evaluation criteria are structured into a hierarchy that identifies several8
intermediate sub-goals dealing with different points of view. Therefore, the recent ELECTRE-III-H9
hierarchical multi-criteria analysis method is proposed as a good solution to help decision-makers.10
This method establishes an order among the set of possible sites for the wind farms for each sub-11
goal. ELECTRE-III-H aggregates these orders into an overall order using different parameters. The12
procedure is based on the construction and exploitation of a pairwise outranking relation, following13
the principles of concordance (i.e. majority rule) and discordance (i.e. respect for the minority14
opinions). This paper makes two main contributions. First, it contributes to the ELECTRE-III-15
H method by studying its mathematical properties for the construction of outranking relations.16
Second, the case study is solved and its results show that we can effectively represent and manage17
the overall influence of the various criteria on the global result at different levels of the hierarchy.18
The paper compares different scenarios with strict, normal, and optimistic preference, indifference19
and veto thresholds. Results show that the best site differs for technical, economic, environmental,20
and social intermediate criteria. Therefore, the best overall solution changes depending on the21
preference and veto thresholds fixed at the intermediate level of the hierarchy.22

1 Introduction25

In the last decade, integrating new energy sources and modifying the use of fossil fuels has become26
essential for changing the energy supply system. Energy production involves several long-term27
practices with environmental impacts and is one of the causes of global warming and climate28
change. Climate change is occurring even faster than expected, and a 50% reduction in CO229
emissions by 2050 may be insufficient to prevent dangerous climate change (IEA, 2013). To confront30
this damage to the environment, several planning strategies have been utilized to accomplish31

the Kyoto protocol. There is a consensus that because of the limitations of fossil fuel supply,32
as well as the environmental deterioration arising from its use, other sources of energy should be33
considered (European Commission, 2010; Evans et al., 2009; Carrera and Mack, 2010; Jing et al.,34
2012; Streimikiene et al., 2012).35

Renewable energy sources, such as wind, are one of the most important and strategic solutions36
for future energy production. Wind energy is a crucial field in the quest for renewable energy given37
its increasingly positive impact on sustainability. Apart from being a major source of renewable38
energy, wind farms are quick and easy to build, produce no emissions, and make few resource de-39
mands (Georgopoulou et al., 1998; Radics and Bartholy, 2008). This combination of virtues makes40
wind energy one of the most promising tools for confronting global warming. Studies are currently41
focusing on improving wind turbines and the impact of wind farm siting (Lee et al., 2009). This42
type of analysis is important for investment in this sector. For investment to take place, various43
stakeholders participate in the decision about renewable projects, giving their different points of44
view. In particular, socio-economic actors (stakeholders) such as town councils, platforms, associ-45
ations and neighbors should be also included in the process to discuss the pros and cons of various46
projects, and construct new alternatives to the current arrangements. Thus, the assessment and47
selection of the best site in a given area must take into account several sustainability issues, involv-48
ing technical, economic, environmental, and social criteria. Applying well-founded mathematical49
methods may aid decision-makers in the energy area to find the most appropriate solutions.50

This paper considers the problem of finding suitable sites for wind farms in a region of Catalo-51
nia (Spain), in terms of a hierarchy of criteria. This case study, which was the part of the Spanish52
research project detailed in Gamboa and Munda (2007), analyzes seven projects with different lo-53
cations for the construction of wind turbines. Given public concern about the impact of this wind54
farm, the options considered were based on combining information from participatory processes,55
interviews, and a review of the projects in the regions of Urgell and La Conca de Barberà. Con-56
sidering the multiple conflicting factors involved in the decision process to find the best wind park57
location, a tool to better analyze each of these sub-problems is proposed in this paper.58

In the literature, the decision analysis methods used in this type of problems consider all59
the criteria at the same level. The models then search for a consensus of those criteria using a60
mathematical model that can aggregate the performance value of the options for each criterion into61
an overall performance, which is used to obtain a final ranking of the options (Afgan and Carvalho,62
2002; Aras et al., 2004; Papadopoulos and Karagiannidis, 2008; Wang et al., 2009; Wimmler et al.,63
2015), or to establish a ranking between the options (Goletsis et al., 2003; Afsordegan et al.,64
2016a,b). In this paper, we propose a different approach to help decision-makers find the best65
location for a wind farm. Due to the diverse nature of the indicators that must be considered, we66
propose organizing the set of criteria following a hierarchical structure. The root node corresponds67
to the overall goal (global evaluation of all criteria), and the intermediate criteria represent sub-68
goals focused on a certain aspect of the problem (e.g. environmental concerns, social concerns,69
technical issues, etc.). Finally, the lowest level of elementary criteria corresponds to the basic70
indicators available of each sub-goal.71

There are only a few decision aiding methods that analyze at different levels of generality,72
providing partial results at each intermediate node of the hierarchy. In this paper, the ELECTRE-73
III-H method proposed recently in Del Vasto-Terrientes et al. (2015b) is studied. ELECTRE-III-H74
is able to construct a partial pre-order at different levels of a hierarchy of criteria. With this tool,75
the decision-maker may establish the overall suitability and preference relations between different76
sites in relation to several sub-parts of the problem. The most sustainable solution in different77
scenarios is sought using a hierarchy with an elementary level (including indicators), intermediate78
level (including criteria), and finally, a goal level.79

The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of the hierarchical ELECTRE-80
III-H method for decision problems with a hierarchy of criteria with respect to the classical flat81
approach, where all criteria are aggregated simultaneously. Several applications have a natural82
hierarchical structure but are later solved with the classic approach, such as the case of evaluating83
wind farm locations. Working with a hierarchical structure facilitates a more detailed analysis84
of the various dimensions of the problem, which may correspond to different needs for different85
stakeholders (e.g. authorities, environmental protection agencies, or even local residents). To do86
so, a first contribution is made with the characterization of the outranking relation for each of the87

possible binary relations found in partial-preorder: preference, indifference and incomparability.88
Then, the consistency between the binary relations obtained for different criteria and the calculated89
outranking relation is shown. Finally, the study of the mathematical properties of ELECTRE-III-H90
taking into account the usual conditions considered in social choice methods is given.91

The second contribution is the transformation of the model used in a case study performed by92
Gamboa and Munda (2007) by using a hierarchical approach. Using the aforementioned ELECTRE-93
II-H, a complete study of various scenarios is performed, comparing the results in different situa-94
tions representing diverse points of view. This study shows how each sub-goal may influence the95
global result using the hierarchical outranking method. The effectiveness of the hierarchical ap-96
proach is presented with a robustness analysis of the solutions obtained at different levels. Finally,97
the proposed solution is a choice of location that moves the windmills away from the villages (whose98
inhabitants oppose the windfarms).99

The paper is organized in 6 sections. After this introduction, Section 2 and 3 present the100
ELECTRE-III-H method and the study of its properties. Section 4 explains the problem of assessing101
wind farm locations, presenting the set of criteria and their hierarchical organization. Also the case102
study in Catalonia is introduced. Section 5 shows the different analysis done on this case study,103
using several scenarios with different configuration at the different levels of the hierarchy. Results104
are compared and discussed. Finally, section 6 summarizes the main conclusions and proposes some105
future lines of work.106

2 Preliminaries: The ELECTRE-III-H Method107

ELECTRE-III-H is a multi-criteria decision-making method proposed in Del Vasto-Terrientes et al.108
(2015b) that allows the decomposition of the decision problem into smaller sub-problems of interest109
in a hierarchy of criteria, imitating the hierarchical decomposition procedure for decision making110
that humans do. This hierarchy permits the arranging of criteria into different levels of generality111
in a tree-like structure, suitable when the decision-maker is not only interested in analysing overall112
suitability but also preference relations between alternatives (e.g., wind farm sites) regarding to113
more specific sub-criteria that refer to some particular aspects of the problem. ELECTRE-III-H114
has been successfully applied in different fields, such as Website management (Del Vasto-Terrientes115
et al, 2015a) and environmental sciences (Del Vasto-Terrientes L. et al., 2016).116

ELECTRE-III-H distinguishes the following 3 types of criteria in a hierarchy:117

– Root criterion: Unique criterion defined at the top of the hierarchy, representing the global or118
most general goal.119

– Elementary criteria: Set composed of the most specific criteria, found at the bottom level of the120
hierarchy. They correspond to concrete the indicators used by the decision-maker to directly121
evaluate the alternatives.122

– Intermediate criteria: Set of criteria defined between the root and elementary criteria, repre-123
senting sub-goals at different levels of generality (the number of layers of intermediate criteria124
is not limited).125

Note that in our approach all elementary and intermediate criteria are considered pseudo-126
criteria, with two threshold functions to represent uncertainty on the preference establishment:127
named indifference threshold qj(.) and preference threshold pj(.) (Colson and Bruyn, 1989). In128
addition, a third threshold to give veto power is used vj(.). Hereinafter, the set G denotes the set129
of all intermediate and elementary criteria.130

The ELECTRE-III-H method follows the classical outranking ELECTRE procedure at all sub-131
sets of related criteria (Roy, 1996), which entails two steps: (1) The construction of outranking132
relations and (2) exploitation of these relations by distillation, resulting in a partial pre-order. The133
outranking relation S is built taking into account the set G. Let A be the set of alternatives. Given134
an ordered pair of alternatives (a, b) ∈ A×A, alternative a outranks alternative b if a outperforms135
b on enough criteria of sufficient importance, and a is not outperformed by b with a significantly136
inferior performance on any single criterion. The outranking relation aSb is constructed on the137
basis of two tests:138

– Concordance test: The relation aSb must be supported by a sufficient majority of criteria,139



4 Arayeh Afsordegan et al.

– Discordance test: None of the criteria should strongly be against the assertion aSb. Otherwise,140
the relation aSb does not hold.141

The credibility ρ(a, b) of the outranking is determined by comparing a and b and obtaining a142
partial concordance index cj and a partial discordance index dj for each criterion gj in set G.143

From the elementary indicators ELECTRE-III-H generates a preference structure of alter-144
natives in the form of partial pre-orders. These partial pre-orders can be used to compare the145
suitability of the alternatives at the different intermediate layers. The partial pre-order depends146
on how well they perform on the particular subsets of criteria and how important each criterion147
is to the decision-maker. Following bottom-up procedure, ELECTRE-III-H builds an order struc-148
ture at each non-elementary criteria. For instance, following Figure 1, classic ELECTRE-III is149
applied at elementary criteria for each subset of criteria {g1.1.1, g1.1.2, g1.1.3}, {g1.2.1.1, g1.2.1.2}, and150
{g1.2.2.1, g1.2.2.2}, resulting in the first partial pre-orders at their direct parents. Next, a partial151
pre-order at g1.2 is computed from the partial pre-orders obtained for g1.2.1 and g1.2.2, and so on152
up to the root.153

Fig. 1: The ELECTRE-III-H process

To aggregate the information obtained from partial pre-orders, ELECTRE-III-H proposes the154
calculation of partial concordance and discordance indices of the alternatives based on:155

– Binary relations. For each partial pre-order Oj , four possible binary relations for a pair (a, b)156
exist: Preference (aPb), Inverse Preference (aP−b), Indifference (aIb), and Incomparability157
(aRb).158

– Rank Order Value Γj(a). It counts the number of alternatives belonging to A that are preferred159
to alternative a for the partial pre-order Oj .160

Following the example presented in Figure 1, let us consider the partial pre-order generated161
in O1.1 and presented in Figure 2. Based on the binary relations existing in the partial pre-order162
O1.1, a preference relation matrix can be built as shown in Table 1. The last column shows the163
Rank Order Value of each alternative.164

Three thresholds, based on either the performance values of the elementary criteria, or the rank165
order values of the intermediate criteria, are used to calculate the partial concordance and partial166
discordance indices:167

– Indifference threshold (qj): below which the decision-maker is indifferent to the evaluation of168
alternative a and alternative b on criterion gj .169

– Preference threshold (pj): above which the decision-maker shows a clear strict preference in170
favor of alternative a over b on criterion gj .171

– Veto threshold (vj): where a discordant difference larger than the veto in favor of b with respect172
to alternative a will require to negate the outranking relation aSb.173

At the bottom level, these thresholds are based on the performance values of the alternatives174
on the elementary indicators. At the upper levels, these thresholds are defined with respect to the175
rank order value of the alternatives in the partial pre-orders.176

For each pair of alternatives (a, b), the binary relations φ ∈ {P, I, P−, R} connect them in Oj177
on the j − th criterion. Considering this, partial concordance and discordance indices from partial178
pre-orders are calculated on the basis of the relation φ between a and b as follows: 1179

– When aPb or aIb (preference or indifference): Both relations support the assertion aSb. There-180
fore, the partial concordance index is set to its maximum value while the partial discordance181
index to its minimum.182

cj(aPb) and cj(aIb) = 1 (1)

dj(aPb) and dj(aIb) = 0 (2)

1 For the sake of simplicity, in the rest of the paper, a notation based on the preference relation between a and b
will be used, such that cj(a, b) = cj(aφb) and dj(a, b) = dj(aφb).

– When aP−b (inverse preference): The assertion aSb is not supported by the inverse preference183
relation. However, as the intermediate criteria are considered pseudo-criteria, some tolerance184
degree may be defined by the decision-maker.185

– When aRb (incomparability): A preference relation between the alternatives evaluated is im-186
possible to be defined. Thus, we consider the equiprobability of aRb to turn into aPb, aP−b187
and aIb. As the two first cases support aSb while the third does not, we assume a partial188
concordance index base value kc=2/3 and a partial discordance index base value kd=1/3. Also,189
a variable α has been introduced to define the maximum degree of change of the base values190
kc and kd.191

An overall concordance c(a, b) is calculated as a weighted average of the partial concordances.193
Next, the calculation of the credibility degree ρ(a, b) of the outranking relation is done by including194
the criteria gj ∈ J , being J = {gj |dj(a, b) > c(a, b)}, which is the set of criteria that have a195
discordance value greater than the overall concordance.196

The exploitation of the credibility values is known as Distillation. It is an iterative algorithm197
that selects at each step a subset of alternatives, taking into account the credibility values of198
the outranking relation previously calculated, ρ(aSb). This procedure yields to two complete pre-199
orders O ↓ and O ↑, called descending and ascending distillation chain respectively. These two200
complete pre-orders are intersected to generate a final partial pre-order. Although the result of the201
exploitation is a partial pre-order, to facilitate the interpretation or the management of large sets202
of data it is also possible to build a complete ranking of the alternatives from the partial pre-order203
at each of the non-elementary nodes of the hierarchy, by generating a complete pre-order from the204
partial pre-order (Del Vasto-Terrientes et al., 2015b).205

ELECTRE-III-H is a decision aiding method that has two important features:206

– A veto threshold that permits to establish the maximum loss allowed when comparing two207
alternatives on some indicators. Thus, when a criterion strongly disagrees with the assertion208
aSb, independently of its relative weight with regard to the rest of the criteria, no improvement209
of the performance of a over b nor deterioration of b over a in other criteria can compensate210
this veto effect. In that way, we can avoid the compensative effect of other operators, such as211
weighted average or AHP.212

– The management of imprecision and uncertainty by means of the use of discrimination thresh-213
olds, which allows taking into account the imperfect nature of the determination of evaluations214
of the indicators.215



Finding the Most Sustainable Wind Farm Sites with a Hierarchical Outranking Decision Aiding Method 7

The main difference to other ELECTRE methods is that ELECTRE-III-H uses these thresholds216
both at the elementary level and the intermediate level. When aggregating partial pre-orders (in217
upper levels of the hierarchy) the thresholds are defined in terms of rank order values. Thus,218
depending on the number of alternatives the final decision-maker can define the number of rank219
order positions that should be considered indifferent. It is also important that veto is only applied220
in relation to their brothers (i.e. the other criteria with the same parent ancestor). This is a221
remarkable difference with respect to the use of methods that do not consider sub-groups.222

3 Characterization and properties of the outranking relation in ELECTRE-III-H223

This section studies some mathematical properties of the ELECTRE-III-H method in depth in224
order to build a valued binary outranking relation S : A × A from a set of partial pre-orders.225
These partial pre-orders are generated during the decomposed hierarchical analysis of the decision226
problem when following the tree of criteria defined by the decision maker. Thus, this operation is227
the core of the ELECTRE-III-H method presented in Del Vasto-Terrientes et al. (2015b).228

Previous works have introduced a common framework and characterization for constructing229
outranking relations (Bouyssou et al., 1997; Greco et al., 2001; Pirlot, 1997), or concordance and230
discordance measures (Bouyssou and Pirlot, 2009; Dubois et al., 2003) in the classic approach.231

Hereinafter, partial pre-orders are the result of applying the ELECTRE-III-H method for the232
intermediate criteria, but the same properties are fulfilled if the partial pre-order is obtained from233
any other procedure, or even if directly given by the decision-maker.234

Before the analysis of the properties of the ELECTRE-III-H method, a study of the four235
possible binary relations and their contribution to the assertion of the outranking relation aSb236
under different conditions is made in Section 3.1.237

Let D ⊆ G be a set of intermediate criteria on G that are the direct descendants of a given238
gi, where D = {gi.1, gi.2, ..., gi.x}. Let us assume that each element gi.j ∈ D is associated to a239
weight wj that indicates its relative importance with respect to the rest of the descendants of gi,240
to preference thresholds (qj(a), pj(a), and vj(a)), and has a partial pre-order Oj containing the241
binary preference structure of the alternatives in set A. For each pair of alternatives (a, b), the242
binary relations φj ∈ {P, I, P−, R} connect them in Oj . Let us denote as ρD(a, b) the credibility243
index of the outranking relation aSb in the set of criteria D. We denote aSb = true if ρD(a, b) > 0.244

3.1 Characterization of aSb in terms of P , I, P− and R245

In this section, we study the fulfilment of the outranking relation S under different preference246
relations observed on the partial pre-orders that are aggregated. The conditions for holding aSb247
(i.e., ρD(a, b) > 0) are given in terms of rank order values and indifference, and preference and248
veto thresholds.249

3.1.1 Preference and indifference relations, P and I250

Proposition 1 Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A, aSb if ∀j, aφjb where φj={P ∨ I}.251

Proof The relations P and I fully support the outranking relation S. For all the partial pre-orders252
Oj , if aPb or aIb, we have253

∀j, cj(aφjb) = 1 and dj(aφjb) = 0,254
255

so that:256
257

∀j, dj(a, b) < c(a, b), being c(a, b)=1.258
259

This results in ρD(a, b) = 1.260

3.1.2 Inverse preference relation P−261

Proposition 2 Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A and Oj the partial pre-order of gi.j ∈ D, ¬(aSb)262
if ∀j, there is a relation aP−j b and Γj(a)− Γj(b) ≥ pj(a).263

Proof Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A and Oj the partial pre-order of gi.j ∈ D, for the case of a264
binary relation aP−j b in which the difference order value of a and b is greater than or equal to265

pj(a), the right to veto is activated so that dj(aP
−
j b) > 0 and cj(aP

−
j b) = 0. Then,266

267

dj(a, b) > c(a, b) = 0, resulting in ρD(a, b) = 0.268
269

Under this condition, a may not outrank b overall when b performs better on all the criteria in270
D.271

Proposition 3 Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A and Oj the partial pre-order of gi.j ∈ D, aSb if272
∀j, aP−j b and Γj(a)− Γj(b) < pj(a).273

Proof Let alternatives a, b ∈ A and Oj be the partial pre-order of gi.j ∈ D, for all the pairs of274
binary relations aP−j b and all the differences of the order value a and b is less than pj(a), then:275

276

∀j, cj(aP−j b) > 0 and dj(aP
−
j b) = 0.277

278

So that,279
280

∀j, dj(a, b) < c(a, b) ∈ (0, 1], resulting in ρD(a, b) > 0.281

3.1.3 Incomparability relation R282

The incomparability relation gives no clear support to the outranking aSb, resulting in fuzzy283
outranking relations with credibility in (0, 1). Taking into account that the values of partial con-284
cordance and discordance indices are respectively in the range of [kc − α, kc + α] and [kd − α,285
kd + α], these indices do not fully agree or reject the relation aSb.286

We analyze the conditions where aSb holds for incomparability relations. We assume that287
λ ≥ kc − α⇒ aSb. As a reminder, the partial concordance has been defined as:288

cj(a, b) = k
c +

(Γj(b)− Γj(a)− qj(b))× α
(pj(b)− qj(b)) + (n− 2)

Proposition 4 Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A, aSb if ∀j, aRjb and Γj(b) - Γj(a) - qj(b)=0.289

Proof Having alternatives a, b ∈ A, if the binary relation aRjb holds and Γj(b) - Γj(a) - qj(b) = 0290
for all Oj in D, we have291
∀j, cj(aRjb) = kc = 23 and dj(aRjb) = 0.292

293

Then,294
295

c(a, b) = kc and ∀j, dj(a, b) < c(a, b), resulting in ρD(a, b) = kc.296

Proposition 5 Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A, ρD(a, b) ∈ (kc, kc + α] if ∀j, aRjb and Γj(a) −297
Γj(b) ≤ qj(b).298

Proof Having alternatives a, b ∈ A, if the binary relation aRjb holds and Γj(b) - Γj(a) > qj(b) for299
all Oj in D, the numerator of the concordance indices expression is always positive, increasing the300
base value kc, such that:301

302

∀j, kc ≥ cj(aRjb) > 23 and dj(aRjb) = 0.303
304

Then,305
306

∀j, dj(a, b) < c(a, b), resulting in ρD(a, b) ∈ (kc, kc + α].307

Proposition 6 Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A, ρD(a, b) ∈ [kc − α, kc) if ∀j, aRjb and pj(b) ≥308
Γj(a) - Γj(b) > qj(b).309

Proof Having alternatives a, b ∈ A, if the binary relation aRjb holds and Γj(b) - Γj(a) > qj(b)310
and Γj(a)− Γj(b) < pj(b) for all Oj in D, the numerator of the concordance indices expression is311
always negative, decreasing the base value kc, such that:312

313

∀j, kc − α ≤ cj(aRjb) < 23 and dj(aRjb) = 0.314
315

Then,316
317

∀j, dj(a, b) < c(a, b), resulting in ρD(a, b) ∈ (kc, kc + α].318

When analysing the case below, let us remember that the value of the discordance index is
given by the following equation:

dj(a, b) = k
d +

(Γj(b)− Γj(a)− qj(b))× α
(pj(b)− qj(b)) + (n− 2)

Proposition 7 Given two alternatives a, b ∈ A, ¬(aSb) if ∀j, aRjb and Γj(a) - Γj(b) > pj(b).319

Proof Having alternatives a, b ∈ A, if the binary relation aRjb holds and Γj(a) - Γj(b) > pj(b) for320
all Oj , the difference between the rank order value of alternative a with respect to b is larger than321
the permitted threshold pj(b), making an opposition to the outranking relation aSb. Thus, we have:322

323

∀j, cj(aRjb) = 0 and dj(aRjb) = [kd − α, kd + α],324
325

then ∀j, dj(a, b) > c(a, b), resulting in ρD(a, b) = 0.326

3.2 Properties of ELECTRE-III-H327

This section provides the main properties of the construction of the outranking relation for partial328
pre-orders in the ELECTRE-III-H method. The properties studied are the usual conditions imposed329
on social choice procedures and aggregation operators.330

– Neutrality with respect to criteria: The credibility of aSb does not depend on the order331
of consideration of the criteria. For any permutation D′ = σ(D):332

333

ρD(a, b) = ρD′ (a, b), so that aS
′b ⇒ aSb334

Proof This property is fulfilled by ρD(a, b) because the product and addition operators are335
commutative.336

– Monotonicity: If aSb and Γ (a) improves or Γ (b) deteriorates in Oj , then aSb remains. The337
outranking relation aSb is preserved based on the improvement or deterioration of the rank338
order value of alternatives a and b, respectively.339

Proof Considering alternatives a and b, if aSb, the following cases may occur:340

– If aPjb and a improves or b deteriorates, then the relation between them is still aPjb,341
therefore aSb holds as cj(a, b) = 1,342

– If aIjb and a improves or b deteriorates, then aIjb turns into aPjb and aSb holds as cj(a, b) =343
1,344

– If aP−j b and a improves or b deteriorates, then the following cases may occur:345

• If aP−j b turns into aPjb or aIjb, then cj(a, b) = 1 and aSb holds,346
• If aP−j b remains, the difference Γj(a) − Γj(b) gets smaller, so that according to Eq. 5347

and Eq. 6, cj(a, b) increases or dj(a, b) decreases respectively.348
– If aRjb and a improves and b deteriorates then the following cases may occur:349



10 Arayeh Afsordegan et al.

• If aRjb turns into aPjb or aIjb, then aSb holds as cj(a, b) = 1,350
• If aRjb remains but a improves and b deteriorates with respect to other alternatives in351
Oj , the difference Γj(a)−Γj(b) shrinks, so that according to Eq. ?? and Eq. ??, cj(a, b)352
increases or dj(a, b) decreases respectively.353

– Pareto principle: Alternative a does not outrank alternative b if b is strictly better than a on354
all criteria. This property is also known as Pareto efficiency or unanimity. As the Γ (·) function355
measures the performance of an alternative in a partial pre-order (i.e., its rank order value),356
we can write this property as follows:357

∀j, Γj(b) < Γj(a)− pj(a), then ¬(aSb)358

Proof By construction, in any partial pre-order, if ∀j, Γj(b) ≤ Γj(a) − pj(a), only discordant359
indices dj(a, b) > 0 are calculated, thus refuting aSb.360

– Independence of irrelevant alternatives: The relation aSb relies on the rank order values361
calculated from the preference relation matrix M. The addition/deletion of an alternative in362
the set A, or even the modification of the performance of another alternative in A, results in363
the modification of the preference relation matrix M. Then, the independence property of the364
relation aSb may not be fulfilled.365

366

A′=A ∪ {k}, then aSb does not imply aS′b.367
368

Proof Let us consider A = {a, b, c} where Γj(b) < Γj(c) < Γj(a) and A′ = {a, b, c, k} where369
Γj(b) < Γj(k) < Γj(c) < Γj(a).370
Let be β = Γj(a) − Γj(b) = 1 in Oj and β′ = β + 1 in O′j . If qj , pj(a) = 0, vj(a) = 2, being371
β′ = vj(a) > β, then aSb and ¬(aS′b).372

The non-fulfilment of the property of “independence of irrelevant alternatives” leads to the373
problem known as “rank reversal” or “rank invariance principle”. It is a phenomenon that occurs374
when in a decision process a ranking O is obtained from a set of alternatives A and the addi-375
tion/deletion/modification of alternative(s) generates a ranking O′, which reverses the rank order376
of several pairs of alternatives previously obtained in O. For example, let us suppose that alterna-377
tives a and b are ranked 1st and 2nd respectively in O, and then adding a non-optimal alternative378
z results in a new ranking O′ in which b and a are ranked 1st and 2nd respectively. The issue of379
rank reversals lies at the heart of many debates in MCDA field (Figueira and Roy, 2009; Saaty and380
Sagir, 2009; Wang and Triantaphyllou, 2008; Wang and Luo, 2009). This phenomenon has been381
studied and analyzed for ELECTRE methods in Wang and Triantaphyllou (2008).382

Detractors of rank reversal claim the existence of a pre-existing truth that must not be changed383
under the same conditions (f.i., weights, and thresholds), as in the case of utility-based decision384
making. However, other authors such as Figueira and Roy (2009) state that the very nature of real-385
world problems and the fact such problems are frequently modelled using poor data (i.e., ordinal386
scales), makes finding the “real” ranking a rather utopian quest. Several authors have indicated that387
in practice rank reversal phenomena occur frequently and is not necessarily bad (Saaty and Vargas,388
1984; Vargas, 1994; Roy, 1972). In Roy (1972), an example illustrating that such phenomena can389
be interpreted quite naturally is presented and suggests that forcing the independence property390
may be unrealistic in many real-world case studies.391

The main reason for the rank reversal is that when adding, deleting, or modifying an alternative392
in A, the credibility matrix changes. As the classic ELECTRE-III method does not fulfil the prop-393
erty of independence with respect to irrelevant actions, the comparison between two alternatives394
is conditioned by the remaining alternatives. If for example, one of the remaining alternatives is395
modified, then the exploitation procedure is applied to a different credibility matrix, which may396
naturally result in a different recommendation.397

The same happens in the hierarchical version ELECTRE-III-H because the calculation of the398
relation aSb from partial pre-orders does not fulfil the independence of irrelevant alternatives.399
As the rank order value of the alternatives is related to changes of the rank order value of the400
remaining alternatives, any change from a lower level will affect the preference relation matrix M401



Finding the Most Sustainable Wind Farm Sites with a Hierarchical Outranking Decision Aiding Method 11

from which the partial concordance and discordance indices are calculated, possibly leading to a402
different order of the alternatives.403

This section has presented two important analyses of the ELECTRE-III-H method. First, the404
consistency between the preference relations found in the partial pre-order and the outranking405
relation constructed upon them. Second, we prove the fulfilment of neutrality, monotonicity, and406
the Pareto principle by the outranking relation. Finally, a discussion about the independence of407
irrelevant alternatives on the construction of the outranking index and its effect in rank reversals408
in the exploitation has been given. This last issue highlights the importance of setting alternatives409
to be compared from the beginning, with the participation of the stakeholders and decision-maker.410

4 Problem statement411

Wind power is an important renewable energy source with positive social and economic benefits.412
In addition, the technology is deemed to be revolutionary and has been selected as the main power413
source for Europe’s 2020 goals to attain 20% renewable energy in their energy mix (European414
Commission, 2013). It has recorded a consistent growth of global installed wind generation capacity415
by more than 20% a year, in the last 10 years of the world (Torres Sibille et al., 2009). The416
implementation of wind-parks is inserted in the Catalonia Energy Plan for the year 2010 to analyze417
the current consumption of renewable energy and the potential production for the year 2010, to418
develop a model to evaluate projects in an economic and technical way, and finally to state the419
goals of energy production from renewable energy sources.420

The rapid development in wind energy technology has led to consider it a suitable alternative421
to conventional energy systems. It is argued that wind energy is one of the most promising tools422
for confronting global warming, being a powerful source of renewable energy with rapid and simple423
installation, lack of emissions and low water consumption (Yeh and Huang, 2014). Despite invest-424
ment in this renewable energy has the potential to improve the economic development, especially425
in rural places as well as public residences, and this energy is more environmentally friendly than426
conventional energy, it also implies some negative impacts on a local scale. Wind farms have a427
strong influence on their local environment such as additional noise or the poor integration of tur-428
bines into the landscape. These issues are directly tangible and important assets for local people,429
which will not be easily accepted by them. Consequently, the most appropriate site for wind farms430
must not harm property values of those who live there.431

Wind farm location is a problem that involves multiple and conflicting criteria related to the432
several opinions and interests. To find the best wind farm location, the relevant economic, social,433
technical and environmental perspectives must be all taken into account during the decision-making434
process (Wolsink, 2010; Lee et al., 2009; Enzensberger et al., 2002). Different studies proposed dif-435
ferent key factors and indicators involved in wind farm selection regarding stakeholder preferences436
and location of wind farms. In this section, a real case from the study of Gamboa and Munda437
(2007) for the analysis of the location of a wind farm in Catalonia is considered. This case study438
was performed in the counties of Urgell and Conca de Barberá (Fig. 3). The evaluation criteria439
and the scores presented in the following subsections come from the Spanish research project by440
UAB/ICTA2 based on the technical translation of the needs, preferences, and desires of the social441
actors.442

In this problem, different stakeholders had different expectations and conflicting requirements443
with each others. Some municipalities and some citizens were in favor of constructing wind farm444
plants according to two preliminary projects as a good opportunity to increase their income and to445
improve social services and some others were against it. The main social and economic stakeholders446
participating in this project are detailed in Table 2.447

4.1 Study of the alternatives448

Two mountain areas were considered: Coma Bertran (CB) and Serra del Tallat (ST) projects.449
Initially, the three preliminary wind farm site alternatives were considered based only on the450

technical and economical indicators: CB-Pre, ST-Pre and CBST-Pre. After some discussion among451
the stakeholders, only CB-Pre was left for evaluation. Later on, other indicators were also added452
in the study: technical feasibility, wind availability, visual impact of the original proposals and453
economic viability of the alternatives. Based on these new indicators, three new projects (CB, ST,454
CBST) were proposed; where CBST is the combination of the Coma Beltran and Serra del Tallat455
projects. Considering social acceptance and the anxiety some people had about the visual impact456
of the wind farms, two modified projects L and R were added in the study. These projects take into457
account the reduction of visual impact of the original proposals. A map of the zone that includes458
all the possible sites is shown in Fig. 4.459

The possibility of not constructing a wind park (NP) is also included in this study, as it was460
considered of interest, which is the Business as Usual (BaU) situation. This means maintaining the461
current situation. The rational behind this alternative is that choosing an alternative with different462
criteria would be riskier. Once the alternatives were defined, a resume of the main features was463
discussed with several actors to evaluate their feasibility and the degree of acceptance. Table 3 lists464
the proposed site alternatives together with their basic description. More details about this set of465
possible locations and the main features of the parks are given in Table 4. Fig. 5 shows the specific466
locations of wind mills for each alternative.467

4.2 Hierarchy of criteria468

Four different dimensions of the problem have been considered in the analysis of the best wind farm469
location: economic, technical, social and environmental. The economic and technical criteria were470
initially considered in the decision process. However, to satisfy all actors involved in this project471
(such as local people), environmental and social perspectives were included.472

Taking into account these four perspectives, alternatives are finally evaluated on the basis of nine473
indicators, which were defined by combining information from participatory processes, interviews474
and a review of the projects at regional scale (detailed in Gamboa and Munda (2007)). The set475
of criteria is given in Table 5. A positive direction of the criteria means that a greater value of476
the criterion score is preferred to a smaller one, while criteria with negative direction means the477
opposite, i.e., a smaller value is preferred over a greater one.478

Social and ecological criteria: Social issues affect the permission process for project approval479
and include public acceptance and visual impact. The attitude of people towards wind farm location480
is different from place to place. In some countries, a lot of developers have been forced to invest on481
offshore projects because people do not want to see wind turbines near their towns. While it could482
make economic sense to site a wind farm near an urban centre, the social impact would prevent such483
proximity. People tend to consider both visual and noise impact as main factors in fuelling social484
resistance to wind farm development. Activists who oppose wind farm developments have coined485
slogans like NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard), and BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere486
Near Anything) in their campaigns (PennWel, 2012). In fact, on the global scale everyone agrees487
that GHG should be reduced, but on the local scale many people are not willing to suffer the488
disadvantages.489

Technical Installed capacity (C9) MW +

Economic and technical criteria: Economic factors do not only affect the locations of the490
wind farms but also the sizes of the farms themselves. The economic and technical criteria include491
site accessibility, proximity to the grid, availability of installation equipment, income and taxes492
and installed capacity. All these indicators have been considered in this study. The best option is493
to locate wind farm as close to an existing grid as possible. It is also necessary that the grid can494
handle the capacity you plan to generate. If not, the wind farm developer or transmission company495
has to extend it. Wind farms can only be located in areas with good wind regimes, these are496
sometimes remote or isolated areas, thus the grid improvements turn out to be expensive. Another497
issue that technically affects generating wind power is installed capacity. The size of a wind farm498
or the amount of power that can be generated is determined by the capacity that can be installed.499

Since these criteria represent four well differentiated needs related to different actors, we propose500
to construct a decision model that is able to take into consideration these four dimensions. In this501
direction, we have defined a hierarchy with two different levels of criteria. At the elementary level502
(the lowest), the nine indicators are taken into account. The intermediate level consists of four503
criteria: technical, economic, environmental and social. This hierarchical structure of the criteria504
is shown in Fig. 6, where the intermediate criteria may be understood as intermediate sub-goals,505
while the root node will be output of the analysis that integrates all the four sub-goals. Notice506
that there is only one indicator in the group of technical issues (installed capacity), thus, in this507
case this elementary criterion is connected directly to the root node.508

Fig. 6: Hierarchical structure for the wind farm location problem

In the next section, we explain how the ELECTRE-III-H method can be used for the assessment509
of the suitability of several wind farm locations. This method is especially indicated for this problem510
because it is able to provide an order structure for each of the sub-goals (economic, social and511
ecologic) in addition to the global one. With this information the final decision-maker will be able512
to deeply analyze all the different factors that are important in this problem in order to find the513
best location.514

5 Results and robustness analysis515

In this section, the use of ELECTRE-III-H method in the wind farm case study is explained to516
show how this method is appropriate for this problem. The performance matrix for the elementary517
criteria is presented in Table 6 (Gamboa and Munda, 2007). The indifference threshold, shown in518
the same table, was defined according to the experts’ knowledge.519

In order to apply ELECTRE-III-H, several parameters have to be fixed for each criterion, both520
at the elementary and intermediate levels. Note that the stakeholders were involved in the choice521
of the criteria and assessment of the alternatives during the decision-making process. Nevertheless,522
although the application that we present in this paper is based on this data, they have not been523
able to actively participate in this later hierarchical analysis. Instead, the research team defined524
different configurations of weights and thresholds from the base case in order to obtain solutions525
from the various perspectives of the stakeholders. In this section, we first present a comparison526
between classic ELECTRE-III and ELECTRE-III-H results in a base scenario, and then we make527
an analysis of how the variation of these parameters influences the order among the different sites.528

First, we define a base scenario. Weights will be equal for the intermediate and elementary levels,529
and so no priority is defined for them. At the elementary level, the indifference thresholds given530
in Table 6 are used, the preference is set equal to indifference pj(a) = qj(a) and we work without531
veto on all criteria. With this base configuration, a comparison between classic ELECTRE-III and532
ELECTRE-III-H is performed. To this end, let us consider the problem without the hierarchy of533
criteria, such that all criteria are aggregated at the same level as in the classic ELECTRE-III534
method. The partial pre-order obtained by the classic ELECTRE-III method is shown in Fig. 7.535

Fig. 7: classic ELECTRE-III Base Scenario Result

We can observe that alternative R is not comparable to alternatives ST and CBST. With this536
classic approach, we cannot find a clear best alternative for the decision problem. Notice also that537
NP is not comparable to many options. This large number of incomparabilities is probably due538
to the fact that we are merging information from very different indicators, referring to different539



Finding the Most Sustainable Wind Farm Sites with a Hierarchical Outranking Decision Aiding Method 17

parts of the problem (i.e. jobs, income, noise, etc.). In this approach, all criteria vote in favor of “a540
outranks b” or abstain (no discordance is applied as a veto is avoided), hence it is easier to have541
a draw on the number of votes. Moreover, the decision-maker cannot know which dimensions are542
more favorable to each alternative. Consequently, as we have already proposed before, we will now543
solve the problem using the ELECTRE-III-H method based on the hierarchical structure of the544
criteria already presented in Fig. 6.545

We set qj(a)=0, pj(a) = 0 at the intermediate level, and again we avoid veto on all intermediate546
criteria. With this configuration the ELECTRE-III-H method will exclusively base the result on547
the majority voting opinion. The rankings obtained at the intermediate criteria are:548

– Economic: CBST > ST > L > R > CB-Pre > CB > NP,549
– Ecological: NP > R > L=ST > CB-Pre=CBST > CB,550
– Social: R=CB-Pre > NP=ST=CBST > CB=L,551
– Technical: CBST > ST > R=L > CB=CB-Pre > NP.552

At the root node, these four rankings (i.e. the corresponding partial pre-orders) are merged553
with ELECTRE-III-H, and the overall ranking obtained with this base scenario is shown in Fig. 8.554

Fig. 8: ELECTRE-III-H Base Scenario Result

Now, we can find more preference relations among the options than in the first classic non-555
hierarchical approach. With the hierarchical treatment of the criteria, alternative R is considered556
as the best option for wind farm location because of its moderate performance on all criteria.557
Compared to other alternatives such as CBST (even though CBST has very good economic and558
technical criteria because of the weak performance on the ecological criteria) it is considered worse559
and is placed in second position in the ranking. This can be evaluated thanks to the partial560
results obtained by the hierarchical method, as shown later for each intermediate criteria in Fig. 9.561
Moreover, using ELECTRE-III-H (see. Fig. 9) and following the performance matrix (Table 6), we562
can conclude that the incomparability between alternative R with respect to alternatives ST and563
CBST may be because of the poor economic performance of R and installed capacity criteria and564
its better performance on the ecological and social criteria.565

In order to fully show the power of ELECTRE-III-H, in the rest of this section other sce-566
narios will be considered, to study the impact of the different parameters at the elementary and567
intermediate levels.568

Due to the uncertainty of the predictions, three scenarios (base, tolerant and strict) have been569
defined. The difference is in the degree of veto at the elementary and intermediate levels (see570
Table 7). The base scenario is defined without veto at the intermediate and elementary levels,571
which are denoted by BI and BE. The second scenario introduces a low degree of veto at the572
elementary level (TE), and considers two possibilities at the intermediate level: tolerant veto (TI1)573
and no veto (TI2). The last scenario is more strict with veto at both levels with the same structure574
mentioned in tolerant scenario in SI1, SI2 and SE. These scenarios are analyzed in subsection 5.1.575
Notice that in this initial study, the indifference and preference thresholds at the intermediate level576



18 Arayeh Afsordegan et al.

are set to 0, due to the reduced number of alternatives (i.e. giving a maximum of 6 in the rank577
order value). Other thresholds will be considered in section 5.2.578

5.1 Testing different preference thresholds at the elementary level579

In the first analysis, using the constant thresholds of the intermediate level qj(a)=pj(a) = 0, we580
set qj(a) at the elementary level as defined in Table 8. Then, we compare the results obtained at581
the intermediate level, in order to understand the effect of changing the preference threshold values582
on the elementary indicators. We consider two situations: pj(a) = qj(a) and pj(a) = 2qj(a) (see583
Table 8).584

We first analyze the rankings obtained at the three intermediate criteria (see Fig. 9). In order585
to compare the results, we have assigned each alternative a rank position following the relations in586
the partial pre-order (being 1 the top of the ranking, the best option). We can see that CBST is587
the winner according to the economic criteria, NP is the winner according to the ecological criteria588
and CB-Pre is the winner according to the social criteria always. We can also see that the ranking589
is quite stable for the economic criteria when changing the p threshold, as well as for the three590
scenarios (basic BE, tolerant TE and strict SE). This shows that the economic issues define a clear591
order among the sites. For the ecological criteria, the ranking is also quite stable in all cases. On592
the contrary, the social criteria show more variation in the positions, as well as many ties (which593
may be due to indifference or incomparability). Note that some overlaps occur between the lines594
of Fig. 9.595

Fig. 9: Hierarchical rankings at the elementary level

We then obtained the global ranking at the root node by aggregating those three rankings596
together with the technical criterion (C9). The results are shown in Fig 10. Let us remember that597
the initial ranking obtained in a base scenario had R in the first position R > ST = CBST > L =598
NP > CB-Pre > CB and this corresponds to the left-most ranking in this figure. When increasing599
the preference (second analysis on the right part of the figure), the base global ranking is: R >600
CBST > ST > NP = L = CB-Pre > CB. It can be observed that for stricter parameters, CBST601
becomes the best alternative available because it has a good performance in economic criterion602
as well as in terms of installed capacity. For non-stricter parameters, alternative R is generally603
included as the best alternative when applying no veto (BE) and tolerant scenarios. This indicates604
that the use of the veto threshold at the intermediate level plays an important role in the final605
result.606

5.2 Testing different preference thresholds at the intermediate level607

In this section, an analysis on the sensitivity to the preference threshold at the intermediate level is608
presented. A new setting is defined for a more tolerant framework by changing the pj(a) threshold,609
from 0 to 1, at all the three intermediate criteria. At the elementary criteria we take the second610
case presented in the previous section, with the indifference threshold values given in Table 8 and611
pj(a) = 2qj(a).612



20 Arayeh Afsordegan et al.

In this case, for tolerant scenarios (i.e., TE, TI1 and TE, TI2), we can observe that alternative613
CBST attains worse positions in the ranking when compared to R and ST alternatives when p = 1614
(see Fig. 11). In fact, this is the least stable alternative. We also see differences in the position615
when comparing the results with p = 0 (left) with p = 1 (right), which indicates that the preference616
threshold at the intermediate levels also has a noticeable influence on the final result. The positions617
in the strict cases (comparing SI1, SI2) are the same for most of the alternatives, and CBST is618
still considered the best option.619

Fig. 11: Global rankings with more preference threshold at the intermediate level

We will now more closely study the influence of the parameters at the intermediate level. We620
will consider p = 2q and the fixed TE scenario at the elementary level. The partial pre-orders621
of the alternatives obtained at the three intermediate criteria are shown in Fig. 12. In this case,622
the social criteria pre-order shows more incomparabilities between alternatives because of their623
different scores. For example, CB is incomparable with NP, ST, and CBST. According to social624
issues, project L has the worst position, although it is not so bad on the economic or even the625
ecological criteria. We can see that R is always in good positions, including third, second, and626
first position in different rankings. This shows that R is the most stable alternative among the627
best overall options (including CBST and ST). However, we must take into account that for the628
installed capacity criterion, alternatives CBST, ST, and L perform better.629

Fig. 12: Partial pre-orders at the intermediate level (TE, p = 2q)

We will now demonstrate how the ELECTRE-III-H methodology constructs a global partial630
pre-order from the pre-orders depicted in Fig. 12, plus the technical elementary criterion. First,631
threshold parameters for the intermediate criteria have to be set. Four cases have been defined632
in Table 9 using various preference, indifference, and veto thresholds in terms of the number of633
alternatives (m − 1 = 6). Notice that we increase the thresholds from Case 1 to Case 4, being634
increasingly tolerant each time. However, the thresholds for “installed capacity” are fixed in the635
base configuration.636

The results obtained for these cases from lower to higher q and p thresholds are displayed in637
Fig. 13. We observe that in Case 1 we have more indifference and incomparability relations among638
the alternatives. Considering Case 1, we can observe three alternatives ranked first, including ST,639
CBST and R; with R being incomparable with respect to CBST and ST. However, in Case 2640
ST is positioned second in the ranking, while CBST and R remain first and incomparable. This641
incomparability is due to the good performance of CBST for the economic and installed capacity642
criteria, while R has an excellent performance for the ecological and social criteria. By increasing643
qi(a) and pi(a) thresholds in Cases 3 and 4, we exaggerate the uncertainty and decrease the role644
of the discordance, and so the alternatives become more difficult to be differentiate in terms of645
preference. The decision about the order is left in hands of the installed capacity criterion (which646
is not modified in the tests). In fact, in Case 4, the ranking is directly given by the performance647
of the alternatives for the installed capacity criterion.648

5.3 Giving different power to the intermediate criteria by means of veto and weights649

In the previous section we studied the neutral case in which all the sub-goals had the same influence650
in the final result, because all of them had the same weight, which represents the same voting power,651
and also the same threshold values. This section analyzes how the decision-maker can change the652
decision model in order to give more power to one of the three main intermediate criteria: economic,653
ecological and social.654

First, we will keep the same weight for all these criteria and will change the veto power, which655
is the right of opposition to the opinion of the other criteria. Afterwards, we will give more weight656
to one of the criteria instead of veto power, in order to check if the voting power given by weights657
provides the same result.658

For the first test, three configuration scenarios of threshold values in the intermediate criteria659
are considered, including the “Strict veto for economic concern”, “Strict veto for ecological concern”660
and “Strict veto for social concern”. These scenarios are presented in Table 10. Note that when661
the preference and veto thresholds are increased, we are decreasing the strength of opposition to662
the assertion aSb. Thus, only one of the criteria is strict in each scenario. At the elementary level,663
we set p = 2q and we will consider the TE and SE scenarios defined as before.664

Table 10: Strict veto of each criteria at the intermediate level

Scenarios Criteria qj(a) pj(a) vj(a)
Economic strict scenario

Economic 0 0 1
Social 0 2 6
Ecological 0 2 6

Ecological strict scenario
Economic 0 2 6
Social 0 2 6
Ecological 0 0 1

Social strict scenario
Economic 0 2 6
Social 0 0 1
Ecological 0 2 6

Results in Fig. 14 show that the rankings are generally stable. Strict veto on the economic665
criteria ranked CBST and R as the best options. CBST is the best alternative based on economic666
factors, but because of its poor performance on the rest of the criteria, R is tied in first position. In667



Finding the Most Sustainable Wind Farm Sites with a Hierarchical Outranking Decision Aiding Method 23

general, R performs well in all the scenarios considered, except when there is strict veto in social668
criterion and strict setting in elementary criteria as well (SE). In fact, R is the best alternative as669
the ecological indicators are the best (excluding alternative NP) and it also performs well for the670
economic and social criteria.671

A similar situation can be found when using more veto power for social concerns - where CB-Pre672
ranked second when strict elementary parameters (SE) were applied. CBST also becomes the first673
alternative in the ranking, rather than R, because the base scenario and SE alternatives CBST674
and R are both ranked second, while for the TE alternative, CBST is ranked fourth and R is first675
(see Fig. 9).676

Fig. 14: Global rankings with different veto power on the intermediate criteria

As explained before, to complete this analysis another test by increasing the weights of the677
criteria instead of using more strict veto has been considered. This may correspond to a situation678
where one of the dimensions of the problem needs to play a more important role in the final679
decision. In this test, the results of using different importance coefficient at the intermediate level680
demonstrates that weights also have an influence in the global rankings. To make this test, we have681
given five times more weight to one criterion than the others. The thresholds are now set to be the682
same as the base case (BE) and pj(a) = 2qj(a).683

The partial pre-orders obtained at global level are presented in Fig. 15. They can be compared684
to the partial pre-orders obtained using strict veto on one the same criterion, which are displayed685
in Fig. 16. When comparing this analysis with the one incorporating the strict veto for each686
criteria, we can observe that they do not have a similar effect on final rankings. For instance, using687
more weight for the social criteria drastically changes the outcomes of the method compared to688
veto power. Using more weight, we obtained three alternatives tied in second place (CB-Pre, ST,689
and CBST) including the incomparability of CB-Pre and ST, while veto power increases clearly690
establish an order, i.e. CBST > ST > CB-Pre. We can also see differences in the economic and691
ecological criteria. Comparing the results obtained by increasing the weights and using strict veto692
shows that these two parameters play different roles in the decision analysis procedure. On the693
one hand, weights change the majority value when measuring concordance (establishing a trade-off694
with the rest of the criteria). On the other hand, veto acts in a different step of the procedure, in695
the discordance stage, in a way that completely neutralizes the rest of the criteria.696

After performing all these tests, we find that the best and the worst options can be changed697
depending on the different configurations of parameters. Yet, in general, it is clear that Project698
R (which moves the windmills away from the villages) is the alternative recommended by the699
ELECTRE-III-H method. The reason is, alternative R does not have the extremely good or ex-700
tremely bad values for any criterion, but it is not vetoed in any of the cases. By contrast, the worst701
project found in the different tests is CB (Coma Bertran), which proposes putting the windmills702
between two villages. These results also demonstrate the advantages of a hierarchical approach dur-703
ing the decision making process. In comparison with the result obtained by Gamboa and Munda704
(2007), CBST was the best and NP was the worst alternatives in their study. Their results are705
shown with a best ranking, however in this study, the parameters have been defined to illustrate706
that different results reflect different settings. For instance, NP is not always the worst option707
regarding ecological aspects.708

6 Conclusions709

Energy planning problems are suited to the use of MCDA for evaluating environmental sustain-710
ability. These complex problems usually involve multiple conflicting criteria and multiple decision-711
makers (Tsoutsos et al., 2009; Karvetski et al., 2011). The process for deciding the location of the712



Finding the Most Sustainable Wind Farm Sites with a Hierarchical Outranking Decision Aiding Method 25

wind turbines is one of these complex real-world problems. It involves different social actors with713
their own concerns and priorities.714

In this paper, we propose a model of evaluation to find a suitable location for a wind farm715
that considers a hierarchy of the criteria organized according to four main dimensions: economic,716
technological, social and environmental. The paper shows that the ELECTRE-III-H method is717
appropriate for finding a solution, because it can integrate the information following a hierarchical718
structure. The main reason is that this method enables modeling the main points of view as interme-719
diate sub-goals. It is then possible to obtain preference orders from among the options at different720
levels of the hierarchy and study how each sub-goal influences the global result. ELECTRE-III-H721
provides useful information that enables a comparison of the different sub-goals, which is impossi-722
ble under a non-hierarchical analysis such as the one conducted with the classical ELECTRE-III723
method. This hierarchical ELECTRE method has been proposed recently in the literature Del724
Vasto-Terrientes et al. (2015b). In this paper we have analyzed its mathematical properties and725
made a characterization of its behavior, showing that it is consistent with the information of the726
partial pre-orders aggregated at each step.727

In the rest of the paper, a case study in a region of Catalonia has been considered. We have728
seen that in a classic analysis with a flat structure of the criteria, ELECTRE-III cannot establish729
preference relations among the different options. In contrast, when using a hierarchical analysis730
with ELECTRE-III-H, the best solution found places for the windmills away from the population.731
This option is best in most of the scenarios with various discrimination and veto thresholds,732
as well as with different weighting policies. However, the remaining options change the position733
when parameters are modified. This indicates that it is important to spend time in defining the734
appropriate values for these parameters, in order to fine-tune and construct a model that represents735
the needs of decision-makers. However, the paper is not intended to give a solution to this particular736
case study, but to show the effectiveness of this hierarchical approach instead of the classic approach737
(in one level) and to demonstrate how this method is a good fit for these set of problems. The738
parameters have been defined to illustrate that different results appear according to different739
settings, but we do not establish which is the best. In addition, this paper is also focused on740
demonstrating how a decision problem analysis varies depending on the priorities of the decision-741
maker when modeled using hierarchies of the criteria. For instance, we obtain a general/overall742
result, as well as partial results (f.i., economical or ecological) that may help the decision-maker in743
the analysis of parameters, weights, etc.744

Furthermore, the decision-maker can also establish the best sites when only a subgroup of the745
criteria is considered. In this case study, using only the economic benefits of constructing the wind746
farm, the best option is the CBST combination (installing numerous windmills in Coma Bertran747
and Serra del Tallat). For the ecological indicators (i.e. deforestation, CO2, and noise avoidance) the748
best project is ST (Serra del Tallat). When only social concerns are considered, the best option is749
CB-Pre (preliminary project in Coma Bertran, placing the windmills between the villages of Senan750
and Montblanquet). It can be seen that it is impossible to simultaneously optimize all criteria.751

The compromise solution found in this study is Project R, which proposes a reduced number752
of windmills away from Senan and Montblanquet. The paper also shows that the importance of753
one criterion for the final decision can be given with a large weighting, or with a strict veto power.754
However, each case has a different influence on the model and final decision.755

Two main directions will be considered for future work. Firstly, and from a theoretical point756
of view, an automatic system for finding the values of parameters that best reflects significant757
changes in preferences can be developed. Secondly, the application of ELECTRE-III-H to other758
real problems in selecting renewable energy alternatives is being considered.759
