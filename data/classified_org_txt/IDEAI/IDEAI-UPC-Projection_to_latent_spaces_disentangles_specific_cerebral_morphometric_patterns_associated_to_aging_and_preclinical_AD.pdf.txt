the presence of ApoE4 positive status were adjusted for the com-
parison. Results: Compared with non-diabetes group, executive
function(Trail Making Test B) is significant impaired in both the
diabetes group and pre-diabetes group. Delayed memory(Rey
Auditory Verbal Learning Test) is significantly impaired in the
diabetes group. There was significant difference between the three
groups in the total left hippocampal volume(F¼3.257, P¼0.046)
and the left hippocampal tail volume(F¼4.623, P¼0.014).There
was a significant correlation between the A1c and the volume of
the left hippocampal tail(R¼-0.334, P¼0.009), bilateral sub-
iculum(RL¼-0.291, P¼0.024; RR¼-0.271, P¼0.036) and bilateral
molecular layer(RL¼-0.307, P¼0.017; RR¼-0.283, P¼0.028) af-
ter adjusting for covariants. Conclusions: These results support
the view that for diabetes, the left posterior hippocampus, espe-
cially the hippocampal tail, may be an earlier affected region
and then the atrophy process gradually spread to other hippocam-
pal subfileds, causing the executive function loss. More clinical
attention should be paid in adults with pre-diabetes status for the
earlier cognitive impairment prevention.

Background:Hippocampus subfield volume loss is linked with
ageing and Alzheimer’s Disease process. However, less is
known for younger adults suffering from vascular risk fac-
tors(VRFs) in preclinical dementia and CVD stage. The
aim of study is to investigate the effect of total VRFs on hip-
pocampus subfield volume change and clinical cognition
impairment. Methods:The total burden of VRFs in non-dementia
and CVD free middle-aged subjects was assessed by Framing-
ham Cardiovasular risk factor scale and then grouped into low-
risk(<10%), medium-risk(10%-20%) and high-risk(>20%)
group. A battery of cognitive tests was used to assess various do-
mains of cognitive function. Volumetric analysis was performed
using 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE image. Freesurfer 6.0 was used
for hippocampus parcellation. Hippocampal subfield volumes
were adjusted by intracranial volume. Cognitive tests were trans-
formed to Z-scores. Partial Correlation and Linear Regression
Model were used, with age, gender, education years, ApoE4 pos-
itive status as covariants. Results:After excluding 2 badly seg-
mentated subjects, 91 (aged 57.8965.04) were included in this
study. Total Framingham score was significant in the left pre-
subiculum(Beta¼-.284,p¼.033).When specifically looking into
the gender, men tended to suffer hippocampus subfield loss in
CA1(Beta¼.399,p¼.048),and fissure(Beta¼.432,p¼.027).low-
risk group is significantly better than high-risk group in working
memory(p¼.016) and better than medium-risk group in visual
attention ability (TrailMakingB)(p¼.042) after Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparison. Conclusions: Presubiculum
was significantly impaired with the accumulation of VRFs.
Working memory and visual attention were two affected cogni-
tive domains in our younger cohort. Vascular cognitive impair-
ment may suffer another pathology process but still share some
common features with Alzheimer’s Disease in preclinical stage.

Background: Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a mathematical tech-
nique that relates two sets of observable variables by means of a
few latent explanatory factors. The aim of this study was to use
PLS to discover the associations between CSF biomarkers and
structural brain imaging in preclinical AD and to disentangle their
specific contribution from confounding demographic factors.
Methods:Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI-T13D) was acquired
from a subset of the ADNI cohort comprising 321 asymptomatic
subjects (185 controls, 136 preclinical) for which CSF biomarkers
was made publicly available. Each image was preprocessed using
FreeSurfer to derive cortical thickness and grey matter volumes
in the cortical regions of the Desikan-Killiany parcellation as
response variables, and age, education, number of APOE4 alleles
and CSF biomarkers as predictors. PLS was used to find the latent
space that best describes the variation of predictors, responses and
their covariance. The latent space dimension (L) was chosen as a
compromise between the total variance explained and the cross-
validated total r-squared coefficient. Results: Predictors accounted
for a lower amount of variance for cortical thickness vs. gray matter
volume, resulting in a lower dimensional latent space in the former
(L¼3 and L¼5). Latent variables showed significant correlation
with age and CSF biomarkers, especially with tau measures. Fig-
ures 1 and 2 illustrate, respectively, latent processes related to
cortical thickness and grey matter volume by coloring brain struc-
tures according to their importance. Patterns related to preclinical
AD show a combination of cortical shrinkage and expansion.
Age-related latent variables show global cortical reduction and at-
rophy. Conclusions: PLS was able to disentangle the cerebral
morphometric patterns associated to preclinical AD stages from
other demographic factors. Results with both cortical thickness
and volumetric data present significant overlap, thus showing the
robustness of this approach. Interestingly, volumetric data showed
more significant correlations with CSF Abeta than cortical
thickness.

Background:Brain perfusion SPECT (BPS) for qualitative iden-
tification of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) deficit was
limitedly available in Bangladesh while the clinicians in major
institutes of Bangladesh have been mostly using the mini mental
state examination (MMSE) as a tool for screening of cognitive
impairment. Application of easy Z score imaging system (eZIS)
on BPS images for quantitative evaluation of rCBF has been
introduced in Bangladesh in 2017. This study attempted to
explore association of MMSE scoring and Z score in patients
with clinical likelihood of having Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Methods:Patients with clinical likelihood of having AD on basis
of MMSE score who underwent BPS using Tc-99m ethyl cys-
teinate dimer (ECD) from February to December 2017 were
included in this study. eZIS version 3 (Mastuda et al.) was
applied to BPS image DICOM data to quantify rCBF. Patients
were divided into two groups on basis of MMSE score (group
A, mild stage of AD ¼ 20-26 and group B, moderate stage of
AD ¼ 10-19). Results:BPS was performed on 34 patients (M/
F ¼ 26/8) with clinically suspected AD with mean age of
61.2610.4 years (41-90) and mean duration since clinical onset
of 10.364.7 months (6-24). Mean MMSE and mean Z scores
were 22.961.11 and 1.0160.35 in group A (n ¼ 18) while
17.5660.96 and 2.6260.53 in group B (n ¼ 16). There was
negative correlation between MMSE and eZIS score; r ¼ -
0.69 in group A (p ¼ 0.002); r ¼ - 0.58 in group B (p ¼
0.019) and r ¼ - 0.93 overall (p ¼ 0.000). Conclusions:Quanti-
fication rCBF with eZIS score was correlated with clinical
MMSE scoring in patients with clinical likelihood of having
AD. We propose use of eZIS as an objective adjunct to
MMSE for clinicians in major institutes of Bangladesh to aid
initiation of appropriate pharmacotherapy in patients with sus-
pected AD.

Background: The most common cause of dementia is Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD) which pathologic process appears as
measurable changes in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and im-
aging biomarkers even a quarter of a century before clinical
symptoms. The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness
of CSF biomarkers, inter alia Ab42, tau and p-tau, and imaging
biomarkers, such as volumetric atrophy, in detecting the dis-
ease in the subclinical phase. Methods:Our study consisted of
191 subjects (94 men) with mean age of 65.7 years (range 42-
84) that were selected in neurological examinations, including
both CSF biomarkers and MRI examinations, conducted be-
tween years 2004-2011 in Kuopio University Hospital. Results:
In our cohort 55 subjects were diagnosed with AD after baseline
(20 subjects before the age of 65). Forty-nine subjects had a
completely deviant CSF profile, and of these subjects 29 had
AD (59.2 %). All AD patients had decreased CSF Ab42
concentration. Furthermore, there was considerable difference
