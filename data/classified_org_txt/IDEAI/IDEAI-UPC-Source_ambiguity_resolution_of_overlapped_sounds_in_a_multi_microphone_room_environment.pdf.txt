Source ambiguity resolution of overlapped sounds
in a multi-microphone room environment
Rupayan Chakraborty*, Climent Nadeu and Taras Butko
Abstract

When several acoustic sources are simultaneously active in a meeting room scenario, and both the position of the
sources and the identity of the time-overlapped sound classes have been estimated, the problem of assigning each
source position to one of the sound classes still remains. This problem is found in the real-time system implemented in
our smart-room, where it is assumed that up to two acoustic events may overlap in time and the source positions
are relatively well separated in space. The position assignment system proposed in this work is based on fusion of
model-based log-likelihood ratios obtained after carrying out several different partial source separations in parallel.
To perform the separation, frequency-invariant null-steering beamformers, which can work with a small number of
microphones, are used. The experimental results using all the six microphone arrays deployed in the room show a
high assignment rate in our particular scenario.

1. Introduction
Sound is a rich source of information. For that reason,
machine audition [1] plays an important role in many
applications. In particular, for meeting room scenarios,
knowledge of the identity of possibly simultaneous sounds
that take place in a room at a given time and their position
in space is relevant to automatically describe social and
human activities [2-5], to increase the robustness of
speech processing systems operating in the room [6],
to assist video conferencing [7], etc.
Acoustic event detection (AED) systems try to determine

the identity of an occurring sound and the time interval
when it is produced [2-4]. Acoustic source localization
(ASL) systems estimate its position in space [5,8-11]. Both
tasks become much more challenging when there exists
sound simultaneity, i.e., several sounds overlapping in time
and in a given room. For example, after the CLEAR'07
international evaluations [12], where AED was carried out
with meeting room seminars, it became clear that time
overlapping of acoustic events (AEs) was a major source
of detection errors [13].

In the concrete scenario used for the experiments, a
typical meeting room acoustic scene is considered,
where only a person is speaking at a given time and
other non-speech sounds may happen simultaneously
with the speaker's voice. Therefore, we have to deal with
the problem of detecting and localizing an acoustic
event that may be temporally overlapped with speech.
The detection of overlapping events may be tackled with
different approaches, either at the signal level, at the
model level, or at the decision level. In [13-15], a
model-based approach was adopted for detection of
events in that meeting room scenario with two sources,
one of which is always speech and the other one is an
acoustic event from a list of 11 predefined events. Thus,
besides the mono-event acoustic models, additional
acoustic models were considered for each AE overlapped
with speech, so the number of models was doubled (22 in
that case). That approach is used in the current real-time
system implemented in the smart-room of Universitat
Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), which includes both AED
and ASL [14].
In that model-based approach, a permutation problem

exists. In fact, the AED system gives the hypothesized
identities of the overlapped sounds, but does not associ-
ate each of them to one of the available source positions

that are provided by the ASL system. The same problem
may be encountered by using other AED approaches, for
instance, if a blind source separation technique is used
prior to the detection of each of the separated events.
To solve that source ambiguity problem, a position as-
signment (PA) system that performs a one-to-one cor-
respondence between the set of source positions and
the set of class labels is presented in this paper.
The proposed PA system, a preliminary version of

which was presented in [15,16], consists of three stages:
beamforming-based signal separation, model-based like-
lihood calculations, and fusion of log-likelihood ratios
over the set of beamformers. Frequency-invariant null-
steering beamformers are designed for the small micro-
phone arrays existing in the smart-room. In addition,
the likelihoods coming from both a speech model and
an acoustic event model are combined in order to
improve the system accuracy. The work presented in
this paper is an extension and improvement of the work
reported in [15,16]. On the contrary, to that previous
published work, in the PA system reported here, all the six
microphone arrays available in the room are employed
in the experiments. For taking the decision, the scores
obtained from each array are combined using either a
product of likelihood ratios or a fuzzy integral-based
fusion technique [17-19]. Experiments are carried out
for the scenario described above and with a set of signals
collected in the smart-room. The observed PA accuracy is
larger than 95%.
The acoustic scenario is presented in Section 2 to-

gether with the signal database used for experimenta-
tion. The position assignment system is described in
Section 3. Experiments are reported in Section 4, along
with some practical issues about the system implemen-
tation and the used metrics. Conclusions are presented
in Section 5.

2. Acoustic scenario and database
Figure 1 shows the smart-room of the UPC, with the
position of its six T-shaped four-microphone arrays on
the walls. The linear arrays of three microphones are
used in the experiments. The total number of considered
acoustic event classes is 12, including speech, as shown
in Table 1. In the working scenario, it is assumed that
speech is always produced at one side of the room (either
left or right), and the other AEs are produced at the other
side.
For the offline design of the system, whose real-time

version is later implemented in the room, a database
is needed. It was recorded using a spatial distribution
of the AE sources and the speech source, as depicted
in Figure 1. The position of the speaker was rather
stable, but the other AEs were produced within broad
areas of the room layout. There are eight recorded
sessions (S01 to S08) of isolated AEs, where six dif-
ferent persons had participated and performed each
AE several times. Note that, though in a real meeting
room scenario the speaker may be placed at either
the left or the right side of the room, in the database
its position is fixed. This will not constrain the usefulness
of the results, because the system will not make use of that
knowledge.
As in [14], we have used for training, development,

and testing up to eight sessions of audio data with iso-
lated acoustic events. Each session was recorded with all
the six T-shaped microphone arrays (24 microphones).
The overlapped signals of the database were generated
adding those AE signals recorded in the room with a
speech signal, also recorded in the room for a single
speaker from all the 24 microphones. To do that, for
each AE instance, a segment with the same length was
extracted from the speech signal starting from a random
position and added to the AE signal. The mean power of
speech was made equivalent to the mean power of the
overlapping AE. That addition of signals produces an
increment of the background noise level, since it is
included twice in the overlapped signals; however, going
from isolated to overlapped signals, the SNR reduction
is slight: from 18.7 to 17.5 dB. The average duration of
the events is 500 ms, and the reverberation time of the
room is around 450 ms. Signals were recorded at
44.1 kHz sampling frequency and further converted to
16 kHz.

3. Source position assignment
The block diagram of the whole system that performs
position assignment from the outputs of the acoustic
event detection and localization systems is depicted in
Figure 2. The model-based AED system outputs either
one or two AE hypothesis. On the other hand, in the
online implementation at the UPC's smart-room, the
ASL system provides either one or two source positions.
Hence, there are four different possibilities for mapping
the one/two detected events into the one/two detected
positions. As can easily be noticed, there exists an ambi-
guity in three out of those four possibilities. This work is
focused on the most general case, where two events are
detected, i.e., E (one of the 11 possible AEs) and ‘sp,’ and
also two source positions: P1 and P2. Hence, the position
assignment (PA) block actually is a binary classifier that
assigns E to either P1 or P2.
If the problem of assigning the two events to the two

positions is solved, the other two cases with ambiguity
can also be solved using the same approach. In this
section, the aim is to design a system that can be de-
ployed in real time in the room to resolve that ambiguity
in the correspondence between detected AEs and acoustic
source positions.

3.1. The AED and ASL subsystems
The two-source AED system included in Figure 2,
which was developed in previous work [13], employs a
model-based approach with one microphone. All ac-
cepted sound combinations are modeled, i.e., the AED
system has a model for each class whether it is an iso-
lated event or a combination of events. This approach
does not require a prior separation of the two overlapped
signals, but requires a number of models that may be too
large. In our particular meeting room scenario, however,
the approach is feasible because 11 AEs are considered,
which may be overlapped only with one class, speech,
so only 22 models are required [14,15]. The ASL sys-
tem, also developed in previous works [14], is based on
the steered response power with phase transform
(SRP-PHAT) algorithm, which uses 24 microphones
available in the room.

3.2. The position assignment system
The scheme of the PA system, which is shown in Figure 3
for one array, has at its front-end two null-steering
beamformers (NSBs), which work in parallel. The main
beam of each NSB is steered towards the desired source
and a null is placed in the direction of the interfering
source, so each NSB will nullify a different source signal.
Thus, the contribution of one of the simultaneous sounds
to the beamformer output is expected to be lower than its
contribution to the beamformer input. Indeed, beamform-
ing is based on the prior knowledge of the direction of
the desired source and the interferent source, which can
be provided by an ASL system. Thus, each NSB requires
two inputs: (1) the multi-microphone signal and (2) the
position coordinates or direction of arrival (DOA) of the
sources.
Each of the beamformers is followed by feature ex-

traction (FE) and likelihood computation (LC). In this
work, hidden Markov model and Gaussian mixture
model (HMM-GMM) are employed, for both acoustic
events and speech. Given the AE class E, the model for
E and the model for speech (sp) are needed for the like-
lihood computations. Finally, a decision block makes
the assignment based on the computed log-likelihoods.

3.3. Null-steering beamforming
Null-steering beamforming is one of the earliest, but po-
tentially very useful beamforming techniques. It belongs
to a class of very popular and widely used beamforming
techniques called multiple side lobe cancellers (MSC)
[20-22]. NSB adapts the sensor array pattern by steering
the main beam towards the desired source and placing
nulls in the direction of the interfering sources [23]. The

solution for the weight matrix in this type of beamfor-
mer is achieved by setting to unity the desired response
at the direction of the target sound and setting it to
zeros at the direction of the interfering sources. In our
particular scenario, only one interfering source has to be
nulled, so only two microphone signals are required to
get a solution for the weight matrix. However, as in each
T-shaped array of the room, there are three linearly
spaced microphones; all three of them will be used in
the experiments.
Given the broadband characteristics of the audio sig-

nals, to determine the beamformer coefficients, a tech-
nique called frequency-invariant beamforming (FIB) is
used [24-27]. The method, proposed in [25] and [26], uses
a numerical approach to construct an optimal frequency-
invariant response for an arbitrary array configuration
with a very small number of microphones, and it is cap-
able of nulling several interfering sources simultaneously.
As depicted in Figure 4, the FIB method first decouples
the spatial selectivity from the frequency selectivity by
replacing the set of real sensors by a set of virtual ones,
which are frequency invariant. Then, the same array
coefficients can be used for all frequencies.
Figure 3 Position assignment system for a single array.
An alternative frequency-dependent approach was
explored for a single array in our previous works [15,16],
using either a time domain implementation or a frequency
domain implementation. However, in spite of carrying out
a careful frequency tuning, the obtained PA accuracy was
just slightly higher than the one from the FIB-based
system for the time domain implementation [16]. On the
other hand, the alternative FIB technique does not require
frequency tuning, and thus, it is less dependent on the
concrete scenario. For those reasons, FIB was chosen in
the work reported here.

3.4. Single-array classification stage
As shown in Figure 3, the classification stage of the PA
system with a single array consists of feature extraction,
followed by log-likelihood calculation and a binary deci-
sion block. Features are extracted from the audio signals
with a frame length of 30 ms and a frame shift of 20 ms.
As features, frequency-filtered log filter-bank energies
(FF-LFBEs), which were developed for speech recog-
nition, are used [28]. These features are uncorrelated,
similarly to the conventional MFCC features, but unlike
the latter, the FF-LFBE features keep the frequency

localization property of the LFBEs. In the experiments,
a 32-dimension feature vector (16 FF-LFBEs and their
first temporal derivatives) is used. As shown in the
scheme of Figure 3, there is a set of two likelihood
calculators for each parallel channel, one of them to
calculate the model based log-likelihood for the AE
label (E), provided by the AED system, and the other to
calculate it for speech. As in [14], here also hidden
Markov models (HMMs) are employed, where Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) are used to calculate the
emission probabilities [29]. Thirty-two Gaussian com-
ponents with diagonal covariance matrices are used
per model. There is one left-to-right HMM with three
emitting states for each AE and speech. Eleven HMMs
are trained with isolated events using the Baum-Welch
algorithm [29]. The HTK toolkit is used for training and
testing this HMM-GMM system [30].
To make the mapping between source positions

and event identities, the decision block uses the four
log-likelihood scores computed from the HMM-GMM
models. Those four scores, which are indicated in Figure 3
as LLi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are grouped in two log-likelihood
ratios LLR1 and LLR2, one for each beamformer path, and
the following single-array score S is computed:

S ¼ LLR1 þ LLR2 ¼ LL1−LL2ð Þ þ LL3−LL4ð Þ ð1Þ

If S is positive, the AE E is associated to the position
P2, and if S is negative, it is associated to P1. Let us
illustrate it with a particular case. Assume that P1 truly
corresponds to speech and P2 to the acoustic event E.
When using the AE model, it is expected to get com-
paratively higher log-likelihood from the output of
NSB1 (LL1) than from the output of NSB2 (LL4). For
the clean speech model, it is expected to get compara-
tively higher log-likelihood from the output of NSB2
(LL3) than from the output of NSB1 (LL2). If that is the
case, the decision is taken that speech is at P1 and E is
at P2, which is the correct decision. Note that with this
type of combination, the decision block gives equal im-
portance to all the four likelihood calculator outputs.
In order to get the most from the available information,

in the current scheme, unlike in [15], the classification
stage includes a speech model besides the AE model.
Indeed, the system could also work with only either the
speech model-based classifier or the AE model-based
classifier. To study the contribution of each one of the
models, all those options have been tested, and the
results are reported in Section 4. For the decision, if
only either the AE or the speech-based classifier is used,
just either LL1-LL4 or LL3-LL2, respectively, is needed.

3.5. Multi-array fusion
As it is mentioned earlier, all the six three-microphone
linear arrays deployed in the room are used in the position
assignment system. For taking the assignment decision,
the six sets of scores LLR1 and LLR2, computed as indi-
cated in Equation 1, are combined either with a uniformly
weighted average [31] of the 12 values or by fuzzy
integral-based fusion [19]. In the following, the latter
technique is presented.

3.5.1. FI-based optimized fusion
The scores at the output of the classification stage can be
linearly combined by using an optimal fusion approach
that assigns an individual weight to each of them. However,
a more sophisticated weighting technique that considers
all subsets of information sources: the fuzzy integral (FI)
approach, is considered in this work [19].
Let us denote by hi, i = 1, 2,…, N, the set of output

scores (LLR1 and LLR2) of the N/2 single-array systems.
Assuming that the sequence hi, i = 1, 2,…, N, is ordered in
such a way that h1 ≤… ≤ hN, the Choquet fuzzy integral
can be computed as

MFI μ;hð Þ ¼
XN

i¼1 μ i;…;Nð Þ−μ iþ 1;…;Nð Þ½ �hi ð2Þ

where μ(N + 1) = 0. The value μ(Q) can be viewed as a
weight related to a subset Q of the set Z of N informa-
tion sources. It is called the fuzzy measure, and if Q
and T are subsets of Z, it has to meet the following
conditions:
Boundary: μ φð Þ ¼ 0; μ Zð Þ ¼ 1
Monotonicity: Q⊆T ⇒ μ Qð Þ ≤ μ Tð Þ



Chakraborty et al. EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing 2014, 2014:18 Page 6 of 8
http://asmp.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/18
In this work, a supervised gradient-based training
algorithm for learning the fuzzy measures from the
training data with cross-validation is used [18,19].
4. Experimental work
The PA experiments are done under the assumption that
there is always an AE overlapped with speech. It is assumed
that the identity of the AE event is known, to avoid the
propagation of the AED errors to the PA system. Add-
itionally, it is assumed that the approximate position in
the room of the AE source and the speaker are known.
Thus, the PA system only has to make a binary decision
(the AE is from position P1 or position P2), which will
be either correct or incorrect.
To design and evaluate the performance of the system,

the position assignment rate (PAR) metric for a given
AE class is defined as the quotient between the number
of correct decisions and the total number of occurrences
of that class in the testing database. Then, the PAR will
be averaged over the classes to have the final evaluation
measure. For reference, a second metric is also consid-
ered, called Diff_LL, which is the value of the S score
from Equation 1 provided that the assignment is correct
(LL1-LL4 for the AE-based system, or LL3-LL2 for the
speech-based one, or S when both the AE model and
the speech model are used). Actually, that score can be
considered as an estimate of the degree of source sep-
aration carried out by the beamformers when a correct
assignment is made.
In the PA system from Figure 3, there exist two FIB-

based NSBs at the front end. The design of the beam-
formers for each particular AE sample requires the
DOA angles corresponding to the target and the null, i.e.,
the DOAs from the source positions P1 and P2. Two
different options regarding the approximate positions
of the acoustic events from which the DOAs are extracted
have been considered. First, the same approximate DOA

for the whole set of acoustic events for each array has
been considered. It is obtained as a DOA average over the
AE source positions, which are known from visual inspec-
tion during recording. In this case, a beam pattern with a
broader main lobe (as shown in the right side of Figure 5)
to approximately encompass all the positions of the acous-
tic events has been designed. And, in the second option,
the position of the event estimated by an ASL system
based on the SRP-PHAT technique has been used. There-
fore, in that case, the beam steers to the direction of the
specific event position. It is worth to mention here that
the AE source positions are estimated using a one-source
ASL system instead of a two-source one, in order to avoid
more propagation of errors from the ASL system to the
PA system. Regarding the speech source position, the
speaker's position specified during recording has been
used for all experiments.
4.1. Results and discussion
To assess the performance of the PA system depicted in
Figure 3, several experiments have been conducted. The
testing results are obtained with all the eight recording
sessions (S01 to S08), using a leave-one-out criterion,
and averaging over all the testing dataset. In all the FI-
based fusions, a 5-fold cross-validation on the training
data to stop the training process and avoid over-fitting is
used. To check the performance of the PA system when
either only the AE model or only the speech model is
used, the experiments for the array T6 is performed, using
visually inspected positions for AEs and a broad beam.
The results are shown in Table 2. It is worth mentioning
that the AE source positions and the speech source
position are physically rather well separated from the
viewpoint of the array T6.
It can be observed, from the results in Table 2, that

the combination of the two models with the S score,
which averages the scores LLR1 and LLR2, improves the
wards the AEs in the case of a wide beam encompassing the DOAs of

performance of the system with respect to the use of
only one type of model. The improvement is much more
noticeable using the FI-based fusion of the two scores.
Notice also that the AE model-based system works
much better than the speech model-based one. In fact,
the former uses a more specific model, because the
speech model is obtained from the whole set of speech
sounds. In that table, the Diff_LL score is also shown.
Notice that, in general, it is well correlated with the PAR
one. However, there is a large difference between the
values of Diff_LL for the AE-based case and the LL com-
bination case, in contrast with the very small difference
there is in terms of PAR. It means that the use of both
models allows achieving a much stronger confidence on
the PA decision when it is correct.
Table 3 shows the PAR scores when all six microphone

arrays are employed, either alone or in combination.
The results are given for the two types of DOA settings
mentioned above. Also, two types of intra-array combi-
nations are considered, as in Table 2 (second column of
Table 3): the average of LLR scores given by Equation 1
and the FI-based fusion. The testing results are obtained
with all the eight recording sessions (S01 to S08), using
a leave-one-out criterion, averaging over all the testing
dataset, and tabulated with the population standard
deviations.
In the first columns of Table 3, we have the PAR (in

%) with the standard deviations when each one of the
arrays is used alone. Notice that the PAR scores of the
upper half of the array numbers (T4, T5, and T6) are
higher than the ones of the lower half. It could be
expected, since for those arrays the angle between the
acoustic event positions and the speech source position
is larger than that for the other arrays (T1, T2, and T3).
Note from the two last columns in Table 3 that the

accuracy obtained from either the average of LLR scores
or the FI-based fusion of the whole set of arrays is

higher than the accuracy obtained from any of the single
arrays. Comparing both types of fusion, the FI one
shows a noticeable better performance for both DOA
setting cases, arriving to a PA error of only 4.3%.
The use of intra-array FI-based fusion improves the

PAR scores with respect to using a uniformly weighted
average of LLR scores, especially for the upper half ar-
rays. Therefore, though by employing the FI approach
there is the cost of having to learn the fuzzy measures
from data, it may be a good choice when the quality of
the signal separation is not too low, like it presumably
happens with the upper half arrays
Regarding the type of DOA setting, the ASL-estimated

AE position-based system works always better than the
one that uses an average DOA based on visual inspec-
tion (i.e., a broad-beam nulling angle). That could be
expected, since the beam pattern is specific of each
event occurrence, whereas the broad beam encompasses
all the angles of the AE source positions. While the
latter design simplifies the overall system, as it does not
require a precise source position and may avoid an
additional external ASL block, it is specific of the given
scenario, so it has to be redesigned when the scenario
changes.

5. Conclusions
An attempt is made in this paper to resolve the source
identification ambiguity that appears when an acoustic
event, which overlaps with speech, is detected. A position
assignment system has been proposed and tested. It
firstly consists of a set of frequency-invariant null-steering
beamformers that carry out different partial signal separa-
tions for each microphone array. The beamformers are
followed by model-based likelihood calculations, using
both the acoustic event model and the speech model, to
obtain two likelihood ratios, whose combination gives a
final score per array. Using the fuzzy integral for that
intra-array combination and also for the fusion of the six
array scores, the best assignment error is obtained, which
is smaller than 5%. It is worth noticing that, though the
position assignment system has been developed for the
problem encountered in the current scenario, its scheme
can be extended to more than two sources and to different
types of sound overlap combinations. Future work will be
devoted to that.
