Speaker diarization of broadcast news in
Albayzin 2010 evaluation campaign
Martin Zelenák*, Henrik Schulz and Javier Hernando

Abstract

In this article, we present the evaluation results for the task of speaker diarization of broadcast news, which was part of
the Albayzin 2010 evaluation campaign of language and speech technologies. The evaluation data consists of a
subset of the Catalan broadcast news database recorded from the 3/24 TV channel. The description of five submitted
systems from five different research labs is given, marking the common as well as the distinctive system features. The
diarization performance is analyzed in the context of the diarization error rate, the number of detected speakers and
also the acoustic background conditions. An effort is also made to put the achieved results in relation to the particular
system design features.

Keywords: Speaker diarization, Evaluation, Broadcast news

Introduction
Speaker diarization has attracted the interest of the sci-
entific community already since several years. Given an
audio recording, the goal is to answer the question: “Who
spoke when?” In general, no kind of a priori speaker infor-
mation is provided. In a broader sense, diarization also
categorizes audio data according to music, background
or channel conditions. Over the years, most research
effort was focused on speaker diarization in broadcast
news domain, but recently there has been also a strong
interest in lecture and conference meeting domain. This
technology offers a strong application potential in many
areas, in particular for transcription, indexing, search-
ing, and retrieval of audiovisual information. Further-
more, diarization can contribute to increased robustness
of other human language technologies like automatic
speech recognition (ASR) by unsupervised adaptation of
speech models to particular speakers. Speaker diarization
task consists of two main steps. First is the segmenta-
tion of a conversation, involving multiple speakers, into
speaker-homogeneous chunks. Second step aims to group
together all the segments that correspond to the same
speaker. The first part of the process is also referred to

as speaker-change detection and the second is known as
clustering.

A lot of diverse approaches to the speaker diariza-
tion task can be found in the literature, but in general,
there are two predominant strategies. The step-by-step
strategy deals with the main steps successively [1-3]. A
limitation of this method is that it is not only difficult
to correct the errors made in the segmentation later on,
but these errors degrade the performance of the subse-
quent clustering step. An alternative approach, referred
to as integrated strategy, is to optimize the segmenta-
tion and clustering jointly [4,5]. Both steps are performed
simultaneously in an iterative procedure which uses, for
instance, a set of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) or
an ergodic hidden Markov model (HMM). The drawback
of this approach is the need to estimate these models
using very short segments, even though the speaker mod-
els get refined along the process. Mixed strategies are
also proposed, where classical step-by-step segmentation
and clustering are first applied, and then the segment
boundaries and clusters are refined jointly [6-8]. Fusion of
both techniques can be found in [9]. The most popular
strategies comprise Bayesian-information-criterion-based
(BIC) segmentation [1] and agglomerative bottom-up
clustering. With bottom-up clustering the optimal num-
ber of speaker clusters is determined by subsequent merg-
ing of a high number of clusters in an iterative process
until a stopping criterion is met.

Objective evaluations became a valuable part of
research and development in the field of spoken language
processing. The comparison of performance of different
approaches (systems) to a specific task helps setting new
trends and stimulates the progress in a particular line of
research. The Albayzin 2010 is the third in the series of
evaluation campaigns (2006, 2008) organized by RTTHa
and held under the FALA 2010 workshop [10]. Largely
inspired by the NIST Rich Transcription evaluations [11],
the Albayzin 2010 campaign focuses among others on the
task of speaker diarization of broadcast news.

In this article, we present as the co-organizers of
Albayzin 2010 responsible for speaker diarization section
an overview of the evaluation and report the results
achieved by five submitted speaker diarization systems.
The evaluation was performed on Catalan broadcast news
data. Although the presented systems have several fea-
tures in common, such as the use of mel frequency cep-
stral coefficients (MFCCs) or agglomerative clustering,
there are also many differences among them, e.g., online-
optimized processing (for live audio input), speaker factor
analysis [12], dot-scoring similarity [13], or acoustic fin-
gerprinting [14]. Based on the observed results, we try to
outline promising investigation directions.

Broadcast news is a challenging domain, because such
shows contain an unpredictable number of different
speakers speaking for a very variable amount of time
and speakers sometimes talk simultaneously. However,
overlapping speech issue was not very significant in this
case (reference annotations show only 0.19 % of overlap-
ping speech). Broadcast news data often contain a large
amount of music and commercial breaks.

This article is organized as follows. Scoring metric
and database used for the evaluation are explained in
Section ‘Speaker diarization evaluation’. The participants
are listed in Section ‘Evaluation participants’ together with
brief descriptions of their systems. The diarization results
are reported in Section ‘Evaluation results and system
comparison’ together with a discussion about the systems
in the context of the achieved results. Conclusions follow
in Section ‘Conclusions’.

Speaker diarization evaluation
Task and scoring
The organized evaluation campaign aims at evaluating the
performance of automatic algorithms for speaker diariza-
tion, which can be also characterized as the “Who spoke
when?” task. The participants could submit more than
one system output, but only the primary hypothesis was
considered here.

The minimum silence duration separating two utter-
ances was set to 0.5 s like in NIST RT ’04 [11], since
pauses smaller than this value were not considered to

be segmentation breaks in a speaker’s speech (it is also
complementary to the scoring collar discussed later).

The diarization error rateb (DER) defined by NIST [11]
is the primary metric. The audio file is divided into con-
tiguous segments demarcated by all reference and system
speaker change points so that the set of compared speak-
ers in one segment does not change. Then, the metric is
defined as follows:

DER =
∑

∀s dur(s) ·
(
max(Nref (s), Nsys(s)) − Ncorr(s)

)

∑
∀s dur(s) · Nref (s)

,

(1)

where dur(s) is the duration of a particular segment s,
Nref (s) is the number of reference speakers speaking in s,
Nsys(s) is the number of system speakers in s and Ncorr(s)
is the number of matching reference and system speak-
ers who are speaking in s. DER represents the ratio of
incorrectly attributed speech time The DER can be bro-
ken down into speaker errors (SPKE), which accounts for
miss-attributed speaker segments, false alarms (FA), and
missed speech errors (MS). The latter two account for
non-speech labeled as speech and vice versa.

Since there is no a priori relation between the sys-
tem and reference speaker clusters, an optimum one-to-
one mapping of reference speaker IDs to system output
speaker IDs is computed separately for each audio file.

A scoring “forgiveness collar” of 0.25 s around each ref-
erence segment boundary is used. This accounts for both
the inconsistent annotation of segment times by humans
and the uncertainty when does speech begin for word-
initial stop consonants.

Database
The specificity of the Albayzin 2010 campaign compared
to other existing evaluation campaigns is that it focuses
on Iberian languages (i.e., Castilian, Catalan, Basque, Gali-
cian, Portuguese). In this way, it is additional to NIST
evaluations [11] concerned with English, Arabic and Chi-
nese languages, or the ESTER evaluation [15] dealing with
French. Broadcast news is one of the main domains of
speaker diarization since it offers a strong application
potential, especially in the context of improving the read-
ability of automatic transcriptions. Performing evaluation
on these data is also a good complement to evaluations
on telephone conversations and meeting recordings. The
used database contains broadcast news channel record-
ings, i.e., announcements, reports, interviews, discus-
sions, and short statements recorded from Catalan 3/24
TV channel throughout the program.

Its original video recordings were supplied by a sta-
tionary digital video broadcasting (DVB-T) receiver. Their
original audio tracks were extracted being available at

32 kHz sample rate, 16 bit resolution, but were down-
sampled to 16 kHz sample rate. The annotated record-
ings comprise a total duration of 88 hours, but for the
Albayzin 2010 speaker diarization evaluation a subset of 8
recordings totaling approximately 30 hours was selected.
Although TV3 is primarily a Catalan television channel,
the recorded broadcasts contain a proportion of roughly
8.5 % of Spanish speech segments.

Catalan language, mainly spoken in Catalonia, exhibits
substantial dialectical differences and is divided into an
eastern and western group. The eastern dialect includes
northern Catalan (French Catalonia), central Catalan (the
eastern part of Catalonia), and Balearic. The western
dialect includes north-western Catalan and Valencian
(south-west Catalonia) [16]. Presumably, the majority of
recorded Catalan speakers features the central Catalan
dialect.

A first manual annotation pass segmented the record-
ings with respect to background sounds, channel condi-
tions, and speakers as well as speaking modes.

Table 1 shows the speaker distribution. Since segments
of overlapping speakers did not receive a gender tag, they
form also a subset of the “unknown” gender account. The
gender conditioned distribution indicates a clear imbal-
ance in favor of male speech data. The number of speakers
per recording ranges from 30 to 250 with some speakers
appearing in several recordings (newscaster, journalists).
However, the majority of speakers are related only to a
particular news and account to only a short duration.

The total durations of audio segments of specific condi-
tions are given in Table 2. Besides, there are a few condi-
tions featuring an overlap of all noted background sounds,
but only with minor duration and are therefore omitted.
Few segments are indicated to originate from telephone
speech. The recorded speech within these segments can
be considered band-limited to frequencies from 300 Hz to
3.4 kHz. The channel “undefined” refers to segments that
cannot be explicitly assigned to one of the other defined
channels.

A second manual annotation pass provided literal tran-
scriptions and acoustic events of segments that feature
planned and spontaneous speech, but no long term back-
ground noises. The non-speech acoustic events were
furthermore tagged with time stamps indicating their
beginning and end.

The number of segments are in parenthesis.

Because of the fact that silences were not manually
annotated, the transcriptions were extended by passing
the signal through the hierarchical audio segmentation
described in [17]. This involved a simple low-energy
silence detector to estimate regions with non-speech
(silence). Furthermore, to avoid too short segments, a
smoothing constraining the minimal non-speech duration
to 0.5 s was applied.

Evaluation participants
Six teams from five research labs submitted their systems
to the Albayzin 2010 speaker diarization evaluation. The
list of participants is given in Table 3.

After submitting evaluation results one of the teams dis-
covered that in half of the recording sessions their system
was reading corrupt audio input. Therefore, their eval-
uation results cannot be considered representative and
only five systems are presented in this article. The origi-
nal description of the speaker diarization evaluation can
be found in [18], where the systems are related to their
corresponding research labs explicitly.

All teams except AhoLab also participated in another
category of the Albayzin 2010 evaluation, in the audio
segmentation section, where five acoustic classes were
defined to segment the audio data [19]. The classes were
as follows: music, clean speech, speech with music, speech

with noise, and other (e.g., noise, silence). Since audio seg-
mentation normally constitutes a part of speaker diariza-
tion systems, we are referring in latter system descriptions
to these five acoustic classes.

System 1
The algorithmic concept of System 1 [18] facilitates an
online execution, i.e., the complete process is performed
in a single iteration. The parameterization of the sig-
nal involves static MFCCs with first and second-order
derivatives, although for the detection of speaker turns
the derivatives are not considered. An initial speech activ-
ity detection (SAD) employs a Viterbi segmentation [20]
of the parameterized audio signal and distinguishes five
acoustic classes (music, clean speech, speech with music,
speech with noise, and other). Each class is modeled with
a GMM.

Subsequently, the speaker change detection employs a
growing window approach [21] and the Bayesian infor-
mation criterion (BIC) to measure the dissimilarity of
two adjacent windows. The BIC metric estimates if win-
dowed audio data is better modeled with two distributions
or with only a single one. A change point is detected
at positions where the BIC value exceeds a zero thresh-
old. Even though the growing window scheme has higher
computational cost, the authors of System 1 report its
better performance compared to fixed-size sliding win-
dow approach and implemented a number of adjustments
in order to decrease the computational load (skipping
improbable places, window length limit). At this stage of
the process, only static MFCC features with no deriva-
tives are used. The speaker change detection of this sys-
tem relies only on voiced audio data. During the system
development it was observed that by discarding unvoiced
frames it is possible to reduce the diarization error by up
to 12 % [18].

During the online clustering algorithm, every time a
speaker change is detected, the BIC value of the recent
speech segment against all known clusters is computed.
If the lowest BIC value falls below a certain threshold the
segment is assigned to the given cluster. Otherwise, a new
cluster is created. The threshold is estimated in the same
fashion as in [21]. The theoretically suboptimal online
algorithm can in practice benefit from the fact that it is
prone to combine adjacent segments rather than segments
far apart and consecutive segments are likely to come from
the same speaker.

System 2
System 2 [18] incorporates audio segmentation prior
to the diarization to determine speaker turns and dis-
card non-speech segments like silence and music. Signal
parametrization uses a set of 16 MFCCs, 8 other features
(energy, zero-crossing rate, spectral centroid, spectral

roll-off, maximum normalized correlation coefficient and
its frequency, harmonicity measure, spectral flux), and
their derivatives. Audio segmentation is based on a hybrid
multi-layer perceptron/hidden Markov model decoder
and discriminates between five acoustic classes defined for
the audio segmentation task.

In order to classify speakers the algorithm uses a simple
Viterbi decoder. It begins with training a universal back-
ground model (UBM) with speech data of the entire audio
file. Subsequently, the decoder determining the most likely
mixture sequence detects (with high mixture transition
penalization) the speaker turns. Homogeneous segments
with speech of only one speaker are usually decoded dur-
ing the most of the segment time with the same Gaussian
mixture.

Two passes of verification are then applied to the labeled
speaker segments to test whether every pair of segments is
homogeneous or not. The first pass involves an audio fin-
gerprint system [22] and the other is based on BIC. If two
segments are classified as similar, then the corresponding
speaker labels are equated.

Audio fingerprinting [14] refers to a condensed repre-
sentation of an audio signal that can be used to identify
an audio sample or quickly locate similar items in audio
streams. A binary representation of spectral patterns com-
puted by the convolution of spectrogram with a mask
is used [22]. This technique is convenient to discover
repeated segments. Labels are determined according to a
majority voting scheme in order to deal with classification
inconsistencies in repeated segments.

System 3
System 3 [18] employs recent improvements in speaker
segmentation of two-speaker telephone conversations
using eigenvoice modeling [23] and the traditional
agglomerative hierarchical clustering [1,24], similarly to
the speaker segmentation technique proposed in [12].

The eigenvoice-based speaker segmentation in this sys-
tem was originally designed for two-speaker telephone
conversations [25], thus it works with a given number of
speakers. Therefore, after separating the speech frames,
every recording is split into 5 min slices and every slice is
processed individually. The segmentation system is forced
to find 10 speakers in every slice.

The parameterization of the signal consists of the
extraction of 18 static MFCCs. Every speaker GMM is
adapted from a background model using the eigenvoice
approach [23]. Given a sequence of feature vectors, 20
speaker factors are estimated for every frame over a 100-
frame window and then transformed with the within-class
covariance normalization (WCCN) [26] in order to com-
pensate for the intra-session variability. Afterwards, a
10-Gaussian GMM is estimated to model the stream of



Zelenák et al. EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing 2012, 2012:19 Page 5 of 9
http://asmp.eurasipjournals.com/content/2012/1/19

speaker factors (as in [12]), where each Gaussian will be
assigned to a single speaker.

Once there are 10 clusters for every 5 min slice, clus-
tering over the whole recording is performed to merge
those clusters belonging to the same speakers. For this
purpose, BIC is considered as both a clustering metric and
a stopping criterion. Clusters are modeled with a single
full-covariance Gaussian function using MFCCs.

System 4
System 4 [18] consists of three decoupled elements:
speech/non-speech segmentation, acoustic change detec-
tion, and clustering of speech segments. As far as signal
parameterization is concerned, all of them rely on 13
static MFCC features. However, for clustering the static
MFCCs are additionally augmented with their first and
second-order derivatives.

Speech/non-speech segmentation makes use of an
ergodic continuous HMM with 5 states (one per acous-
tic class mentioned earlier). In order to detect speaker
change points, speech segments were further segmented
by means of a conventional metric-based approach [3]
evaluating the likelihood of the acoustic change in the
center of a sliding window using normalized Cross-BIC
(XBIC) metric [27]. The authors of the system state
that with this approach, besides many additional acoustic
changes, almost all the speaker changes were detected.

The clustering employs linear dot-scoring, a fast and
simple technique for scoring test segments against tar-
get models which employs the first-order Taylor-series
approximation to the GMM log-likelihood. For each
speech segment a GMM was MAP-adapted from a
universal background model, and zero- and first-order
sufficient statistics are computed. The similarity between
different segments is then estimated with TZ-normalized
[28] dot scores. Finally, an agglomerative clustering algo-
rithm is used until no pair of clusters exceeds a similarity
threshold.

System 5
The front-end parameterization of the speaker diarization
System 5 [18] involves the extraction of 19 static MFCCs
with their derivatives, followed by cepstral mean normal-
ization (CMN), RASTA filtering [29], and feature warping
[30]. All speech segments from training data are used
to train a UBM. Given this UBM, sufficient statistics are
extracted for every segment labeled by a preceding audio
segmentation step. The next steps involve a factor anal-
ysis to model the total variability subspace resulting in
so-called iVectors [31] and a linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) transformation of the iVectors [32] computed over
1 s windows. The LDA technique discriminates between
speakers and was also estimated from the training data.

The MFCC feature stream is divided into 90 s audio
slices with certain overlap. Computed LDA-projected
iVectors in each slice are clustered based on their cosine
distance with a constrained maximum allowed distance
between an iVector and a cluster centroid. Cluster cen-
troids, the mean of iVectors in each cluster, represent
candidate speakers. Candidate speaker models are accu-
mulated over all the slices in the test session together with
the frequency of appearance of their clusters.

Speakers presumably appear in several slices, thus a sec-
ondary clustering merges the initial centroids, obtaining
an enhanced set of candidate speakers. A prior probabil-
ity is assigned to each of the candidate speakers according
to its presence in the entire session. Likelihoods for each
candidate speakers are estimated in a second pass over
the iVector stream using the cosine distance and the prior
probability of each candidate speaker. Finally, the output
diarization labels are obtained by a Viterbi decoding of
so-calculated speaker scores.

Evaluation results and system comparison
In this section, the performances of the five systems
are presented and analyzed from different perspectives.
Firstly, we review the main evaluation metric (DER) and
discuss the distributions of its three components (misses,
false alarms, speaker errors.) In the following, the perfor-
mance for individual test sessions and also for different
background conditions is presented. Next, the number of
detected speakers by the systems is analyzed. Finally, we
highlight the main outcomes of this performance evalua-
tion.

Diarization performance
The DER results for five submitted systems in Albayzin
2010 are given in Table 4, where it is clear that the most
successful system was the System 1 with 30.4 % DER. Fur-
thermore, a decomposition considering missed-speech
detection, false alarms, and false speaker labeling is also
depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 indicates incorrect assigned speaker labels as
the most significant proportion of the DER. The challenge
seems to be the fact that many speakers speak only short

segments of time, while a speaker may feature different
background conditions.

The speaker error achieved by the first system is very
remarkable, since all the clustering happens in only a sin-
gle iteration. Furthermore, System 1 relies on the most
popular approaches of the state-of-the-art diarization sys-
tems. Even though it is not possible to directly derive
a conclusion from this result, the strategy to discard
unvoiced frames in speaker change detection may have
been the crucial factor of the best performance. The SAD
of System 1 was tuned for hypothesizing more misses than
insertions (false alarm). The SAD performance is reflected
by the amount of MS and FA errors.

The balanced SAD of System 4 and robust techniques
applied for speaker segmentation resulted in the second
best DER according to Table 4. The factor analysis tech-
nique used in speaker segmentation of System 3 proved to
be well-suited for this task. The overall DER and speaker
error rate in particular were very similar for Systems 3
and 4.

The factor analysis approach was also employed in Sys-
tem 5, which achieved the lowest speaker error with
Viterbi decoding of iVector-stream scores over candidate
clusters. It remains an open question, how the score nor-
malization according to cluster appearance probability
impacts the error rates.

System 2, with its hybrid ANN/HMM approach, dis-
plays the lowest error accounting to speech/non-speech
detection, but it cannot benefit from this advantage in the
overall performance. It is unclear what was the major rea-
son for the higher overall DER score. It may have been the
very simple initial speaker change detection, or the finger-
printing technique, which was observed to study well for
audio segmentation [19], is not so appropriate for clus-
tering speaker segments. Eventually, using the same set of

acoustic features (and their derivatives) in all three stages
of the process may not have been the optimal choice.

Session variability
A more detailed analysis of the DER for each testing
session shows (see Figure 2) that the performance of
the systems was rather stable. In practice, a relatively
high variability across different recordings, despite hav-
ing comparable characteristics, is nothing unusual with
diarization [33]. The DER standard deviation over the
eight test recordings for each system lies between 4.6 and
8.0 % DER. All systems were operating well (with respect
to their average performance) in the test session 23. The
absolutely lowest error of 21.6 % DER was achieved by
the System 4 on session 19. It seems that the biggest dif-
ficulties for the majority of evaluated systems posed the
session 22, probably also due to a rather high (but not
the highest) number of involved speakers. The session
DER and the number of speakers are only very vaguely
correlated, though.

Acoustic background conditions
The speech signal can be divided according to acous-
tic background conditions into three categories: clean
speech, speech over noise, and speech over music. A par-
ticular difficulty of the diarization task is due to the nature
of broadcast news data, which may exhibit different back-
ground conditions for one and the same speaker. It makes
it very challenging for the clustering algorithm to put
such speaker segments with different background condi-
tions into the same cluster. The proportions of the dura-
tions of the background conditions (music, noise, silence),
including both speech and non-speech segments, reflect
how these three classes roughly contribute to the overall
diarization error. Clean-speech, speech-over-noise, and

speech-over-music segments are influencing the DER by
36, 46, and 18 %, respectively. Looking at the individual
DER performances (evaluating each speech class indepen-
dently), given in Figure 3, it is not surprising that the DERs
of clean speech are usually the lowest.

Number of speakers
The operation of the systems in terms of detected speaker
count is shown in Figure 4. Here, the Systems 5 and 4
exhibit the highest number of true detected speakers, but
at the same time suffer from even higher counts of false
speakers. The System 1, for instance, though detecting less
correct speakers, maintains a significantly lower number
of false speakers. Similar observation applies also for the
operation of System 3.

The possible reason for the high number of false
speakers of System 4 could be the substantial initial
over-segmentation (reported in Section ‘System 4’) in a

combination with a too strictly defined merging thresh-
old of the dot-scoring similarity. Nevertheless, since the
overall DER is not much different from System 1 or 3, the
affected speaker segments were probably very short.

In the case of System 5, the probable cause of the
high number of falsely detected speakers lies in the sub-
stantial false alarm rate (FA error, see Table 4) of the
speech/non-speech detection rather than clustering algo-
rithm, because speaker error rate (SPKE) is very good
compared with other systems.

Summarizing points
The analysis of speaker diarization results and the charac-
teristics of the submitted systems revealed several obser-
vations which can be summarized as follows:

• The use of only voiced frames for performing speaker
segmentation, which was implemented in one of the

systems, seems a very interesting step in context of
the very good speaker error result of that particular
system.

• The speaker factor analysis technique which received
attention in the field of speaker verification was
successfully adopted in two presented diarization
systems. Both of them delivered competitive results
compared to the best system.

• Almost all systems rely exclusively on MFCC features
(13–19 coefficients), for clustering also their
derivatives can be used.

• BIC maintains as the most popular and effective
cluster merging metric and/or clustering stopping
criterion. It can be accompanied with other
segmentation passes applying other metrics, but in all
the cases the BIC is present at some point. The
growing window strategy provides better results than
a fixed-size sliding window (the winner system also
relied on growing window), but the computational
cost is normally also larger.

• All the systems used the conventional bottom-up
agglomerative clustering approach. Even though it
can sometimes suffer from merging instability or
stopping criteria difficulties, it is usually robust and is
also the most popular in other state-of-the-art
systems. Some systems do not manage to estimate
very well the approximate number of speakers,
probably due to a too high initial over-segmentation.
However, the durations of the segments for the
majority of falsely introduced speakers amount to
only very short times, and hence the speaker error
rate is not increased substantially.

Conclusions
The Albayzin 2010 speaker diarization evaluation results
were presented for five of the six teams from four Spanish

(EHU, UVigo, UZ, UAM) and one Portuguese (UC) uni-
versity. The system which obtained the best result was also
designed to run online and relies on modified growing-
window BIC-based speaker-change detection and on a
BIC-based clustering algorithm.

The design of the presented systems confirmed the
popularity of cepstral features, BIC metric (or its modifi-
cation) and agglomerative bottom-up clustering approach
for the diarization task. The evaluation results also
showed the effectiveness the factor analysis approach
adopted from speaker recognition.

The evaluation data turned out to be relatively challeng-
ing, since the DER results in other comparable evalua-
tions, e.g., the NIST RT’04 evaluation [34] or the ESTER
evaluation on French broadcast news [15], were consider-
ably lower than in this case. The high number of speakers
in Catalan TV 3/24 broadcast news corpus was perhaps
also the reason why no system managed to determine the
correct speaker count in neither recording.
