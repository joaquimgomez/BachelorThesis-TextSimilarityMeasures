igure 1. T-maps of the longitudinal Jacobian determinant differences be-

een (i) normal controls and preclinical AD groups (top) and (ii) normal

ontrols and AD groups (bottom). Colormap indicates volume contractions

lue) and expansions (red). Apparent volume increments can be observed

ostly in periventricular regions, likely resulting in the expansion of the

SF.

biomarker severity from CON to AD, with SCD showing a small,
but significant difference from CON in the EC and HPC. Results:
Qualitatively, morphometry results showed a gradient of changes
from CON to AD in the EC and HPC (Figure 1), especially for
the left EC and right HPC, but with SCD not significantly different
from CON. Furthermore, compared to CON, SCD had significant
lower right lingual surface (p¼.021), left posterior cingulate thick-
ness (p¼.026), right rostral anterior cingulate thickness (p¼.012),
left supramarginal surface (p¼.019) and volume (p¼.039), howev-
er none of those differences resisted FDR correction. Grading re-
sults (Figure 2) were similar to morphometry, with a gradient of
changes from CON to AD, especially for the left EC and right
HPC, but no significant difference between SCD and CON. Conclu-
sions:Based on these results, baseline morphometric measures and
TPMDgrading scores for EC and HPC do not capture the difference
related to the cognitive complaint between SCD and CON. Longi-
tudinal follow-up is required to determine their positive predictive
values for AD pathology.

igure 2. Distribution of jacobian determinant values for each population

roup (i) normal controls, (ii) preclinical subjects, (iii) MCI/AD, according

brain region of Interest (ROIs). Average over significant voxels for each

cobian determinant is provided. Positive values indicate volume expan-

ions and negative values indicate contractions. Units of volume change

re arbitrary but consistent throughout the ROIs.
Background:In the last decade, magnetic resonance imaging has un-
veiled specific AD alterations at different stages of the AD patho-
physiologic continuum that conform what has been established as
the AD signature. To which extent MRI can detect structural
changes at the preclinical asymptomatic stage of AD -the preclini-
cal AD signature- is still an area open for exploration. Methods:
Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI-T13D) data
was acquired from a subset of the ADNI cohort comprising 817
subjects (174 controls, 125 preclinical, 518 MCI/Dementia due to
AD, at baseline) for which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker
data is publicly available. For each subject, volumetric changes
in brain structure between two consecutive acquisition timepoints
(average time interval of 2 years) were defined by calculating jaco-
bian determinants using the SPM longitudinal Voxel-Based
Morphometry pipeline. Statistical analysis was performed to iden-
tify brain regions with significantly different changes between five
progressive groups: (1) Normal controls, (2) Normal control sub-
jects that convert to amyloid positive, (3) Preclinical subjects, (4)
Preclinical subjects that become symptomatic, (5) Symptomatic
(MCI and AD) subjects. Results: We define the preclinical AD
signature as statistically significant structural brain changes be-
tween normal controls vs. preclinical subjects (group 1 vs 3). We
found certain brain regions that show early subtle atrophy (e.g.
Middle Temporal). Other regions show volume increments (e.g.
Hippocampus) whereas they display longitudinal atrophy in symp-
tomatic stages (Figure 1), probably resulting in expansion of CSF.
Thus, the characterized preclinical AD signature presents regions
that overlap with the well-established AD signature (e.g. Precu-
neus), and others that do not (e.g. Caudate). We will also describe
changes that are specific for groups (2) and (4). Conclusions:Our
work supports the idea that there are brain volumetric changes spe-
cific to preclinical AD subjects and defines the preclinical AD

signature based on longitudinal data. While some regions show a
pattern of atrophy that overlaps with the AD signature, other spe-
cific regions exhibit changes that are unique to this early asymp-
tomatic AD stage. Promising applications of these jacobian
determinant features may, in the future, be used for subject classi-
fication.
