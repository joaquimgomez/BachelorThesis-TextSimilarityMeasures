Quantification of Survey Expectations by means of Symbolic 
Regression via Genetic Programming to Estimate Economic 

Growth in Central and Eastern European Economies 
 

 
Abstract. Tendency surveys are the main source of agents’ expectations. The main aim of this study is 
twofold. First, we propose a new method to quantify survey-based expectations by means of symbolic 
regression (SR) via genetic programming. Second, we combine the main SR-generated indicators to 
estimate the evolution of GDP, obtaining the best results in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Finally, 
we assess the impact of the 2008 financial crisis, finding an improvement in the capacity of agents’ 
expectations in most Central and Eastern European economies to anticipate economic growth after the 
crisis.

1. Introduction 
 

Agents’ expectations about the state of the economy play a major role in economic 
time series modelling. Business and consumer surveys provide detailed information 
about agents’ expectations. Survey-based expectations present several advantages over 
experimental expectations. First, they are based on the knowledge of the respondents 
operating in the market. Second, they are available ahead of the publication of 
quantitative official data. Third, they provide detailed information about a wide range of 
variables. Tendency surveys ask respondents whether they expect a certain variable to 
increase, to remain constant or to decrease. Survey results are published as aggregated 
data. The individual replies can be aggregated as percentages of the respondents in each 
category, or re-scaled by means of a grading procedure. In both cases, the qualitative 
nature of survey results has led to quantify agents’ responses making use of survey 
indicators. 

The most commonly used indicator to present survey results is the balance statistic. 
By assuming that the expected percentage change in a variable remains constant over 
time for all agents, Anderson (1951) defined the balance statistic as the subtraction 
between the percentage of agents reporting an increase and the percentage of those 
reporting a decrease. As the balance statistic does not take into account the percentage 
of respondents expecting a variable to remain constant, Claveria (2010) proposed a 
variation of the balance statistic that accounts for this percentage of respondents by 
weighting it by the proportion of respondents expecting a variable to rise or fall. The 
weighted balance allows discriminating between two equal values of the balance 
statistic depending on the percentage of respondents expecting a variable to remain 
constant. By matching individual responses with firm-by-firm outcomes, Müller (2010) 
finds evidence that the median of the “no change” category is equal to zero. Visco 
(1984) and Papadia (1983) calculate balances for surveys with more than three 
answering categories. 

The balance statistic has been widely used in applied economics, both as the 
regressors in quantitative forecasts models (Guizzardi and Stacchini, 2015; Martinsen et 
al., 2014; Ghonghadze and Lux, 2012; Robinzonov, 2012; Lui et al., 2011a,b;

Kauppi et al., 1996; Parigi and Schlitzer, 1995; Bergström, 1995; Rahiala and 
Teräsvirta, 1993; Biart and Praet, 1987), and also to test economic hypothesis (Girardi, 
2014; Jean-Baptiste, 2012, Zárate et al., 2012; Schmeling and Schrimpf, 2011; Jonsson 
and Österholm, 2011, 2012; Paloviita, 2006; Pesaran and Weale, 2006; Lemmens et al., 
2005, 2008; Pehkonen, 1992; Ivaldi, 1992; Batchelor and Dua, 1992; Ilmakunnas, 1989; 
Pesaran, 1987, 1985, 1984). 

The balance statistic can be regarded as a qualitative measure of the average 
changes expected in the variable. As a result, numerous methods to transform balances 
into a quantitative measure of agents’ expectations have been proposed in the literature. 
The output of these quantification procedures is a proxy of unobservable expectations, 
and therefore they inevitably entail a measurement error (Lee, 1994).  

The first approach for quantifying survey expectations proposed by Theil (1952) is 
based on the assumption that respondents report a variable to go up or down if the mean 
of their subjective probability distribution lies above or below a threshold level or 
indifference interval. This method is known as the probability approach. Carlson and 
Parkin (1975) suggested using a normal distribution together with symmetric and 
constant threshold parameters, both across respondents and over time. The proposed 
extensions of the Carlson-Parkin framework are mainly focused on relaxing some of its 
assumptions. See Lahiri and Zhao (2015), Vermeulen (2014), Pesaran and Weale 
(2006), Driver and Urga (2004), and Nardo (2003) for an appraisal of the different 
quantification methods. 

This study presents a novel method to quantify survey data on expectations based on 
evolutionary computation and symbolic regression (SR). A SR-based approach allows 
to identify non-linear dependencies between expectations about different economic 
variables in large datasets. We estimate the SR model by means of genetic programming 
(GP), which through Darwinian competition selects the fittest models of interaction 
between agents' expectations. The main objective of this research is to propose a 
method to empirically model agents’ expectations so as to generate predictions of the 
evolution of the economy. With this aim, we make use of survey data from the World 
Economic Survey (WES) carried out by the CESIfo Institute for Economic Research in 
co-operation with the International Chamber of Commerce. 

The relationship between changes in expectations and economic growth has been 
widely investigated (Mokinski et al., 2015; Dees at al., 2013; Leduc and Sill, 2013; Lui,

Mitchell and Weale, 2011a,b; Zanin, 2010; Claveria et al., 2007; Abberger, 2007; Nolte 
and Pohlmeier, 2007; Mitchell et al., 2005a,b), but never before by means of SR. By 
combining a SR approach with GP, we are able to identify the optimal combinations of 
a wide range of survey variables that best fits the actual evolution of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) in a set of countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD). 

SR is an empirical modelling approach especially suitable when the model structure 
is unknown or changes over time. While conventional regression analysis is based on a 
certain model specification that optimizes the coefficients in the model, SR does not 
rely on a specific a priori determined model structure. SR can optimize the model 
structure and the coefficients simultaneously. SR finds an appropriate model from a 
space of all possible expressions defined by a set of given operations and functions. The 
only assumption made in SR is that the response surface can be described by an 
algebraic expression. The application of GP (Koza, 1992) in SR has allowed to apply 
empirical modelling in a wide range of applications.  

GP can be considered as an extension of genetic algorithms (GAs) based on 
variable-length trees instead of fixed-sized individuals. GP belongs to the class of 
evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which were introduced by Holland (1975) and fostered 
by evolutionary programming (Fogel et al., 1966). Zelinka (2015) provides an overview 
of EAs. See Fogel (2006) and Goldberg (1989) for applications and a comprehensive 
overview.  

Empirical modelling via SR with GP is increasingly attracting interest from different 
areas due to its wide applicability (Cai et al., 2006; Yao and Lin, 2009, Vladislavleva et 
al., 2010; Can and Heavey, 2011; Barmpalexis et al., 2011; Ceperic et al., 2014; Sarradj 
and Geyer, 2014). Nevertheless, the applications in economics are still few. Kotanchek 
et al. (2010) identify models between large public datasets and GDP per capita. 
Kronberger et al. (2011) use SR to identify variable interactions in a large dataset of 
economic indicators to estimate US inflation. Kľúčik (2012) uses GP in the estimation 
of total exports and imports to Slovakia via SR. Wei (2013) proposes a hybrid model to 
forecast the stock index in Taiwan. Yang et al. (2015) propose a data-driven approach 
that uses SR to forecast oil production. 

We aim to break new ground by implementing SR via GP in modelling agents’ 
expectations. This approach allows us to quantify survey expectations and generate 
estimates of GDP growth.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the 
quantification of survey expectations. Section 3 presents our methodological approach. 
In Section 4 an overview of the experiment is given. Section 5 describes the data. In 
Section 6 we present the empirical results. Finally, a brief summary together with the 
conclusions are given in Section 7. 
 
2. Literature review on the quantification of survey-based expectations 
 

Business and consumer surveys, also known as tendency surveys, are characterized 
by asking agents about whether they expect a variable to rise, to fall, or to remain 
unchanged. The qualitative nature of agents’ responses has led to quantify survey 
indicators. Anderson (1952) was the first to formalise the relationship between actual 
changes in a variable and respondents’ expectations by regressing the actual average 
percentage change of an aggregate variable tY , on the percentage of respondents 
expecting a variable to rise and fall, denoted by tR  and tF  respectively. This regression 
approach was latter extended by Pesaran (1984) by allowing the model for an 
asymmetrical relationship between the actual average percentage change of an 
aggregate variable ty  and the change for agent i ( ity ) in periods of growth. 

The most common approach for quantifying survey expectations is assuming that 
respondents report a variable to go up or down if the mean of their subjective 
probability distribution lies above or below a threshold level (indifference interval). 
This theoretical framework was proposed by Theil (1952), and denoted as the 
probability approach. Carlson and Parkin (1975) developed the method by using a 
normal distribution. Several authors have used alternative distributions (Batchelor, 
1982; Visco, 1984; Foster and Gregory, 1987). Mitchell (2002), Berk (1999), Balcombe 
(1996) and Fishe and Lahiri (1981) have found evidence that normal distributions 
provide as accurate expectations as other stable distributions. The Carlson-Parkin 
method assumed a constant and symmetric indifference interval across respondents and 
over time.  

Pesaran (1987), Bennett (1984), Batchelor (1981, 1982), and Defris and Williams 
(1979) noted some of the restrictions of the Carlson-Parkin framework. Abberger (2007) 
uses probit analysis to estimate a quantitative threshold for employment expectations 
that allows to differentiate between a decrease and an increase in actual employment. 



 6

Several refinements of the probabilistic approach have been proposed in order to reduce 
the measurement error introduced by restrictive assumptions (Lahiri and Zhao, 2015; 
Breitung and Schmeling, 2013; Łyziak, 2013; Müller, 2010; Mitchell, Mouraditis and 
Weale, 2007; Claveria et al., 2003, 2006; Mitchell, Smith and Weale, 2002, 2005; 
Löffler, 1999; Berk, 1999; Smith and McAleer, 1995; Dasgupta and Lahiri, 1992; 
Kariya, 1990; Batchelor and Orr, 1988; Seitz, 1988; Batchelor, 1986; Toyoda, 1979). 

By making the threshold dependent on time-varying quantitative variables, 
Batchelor (1986), and Berk (1999) developed a variant of the Carlson-Parkin procedure. 
Seitz (1988) used Cooley and Prescott’s (1976) time-varying parameter (TVP) model, in 
which the parameter vector was subject to permanent and temporary shocks. Claveria et 
al (2006) presented a more general model based on a state-space representation that 
allows for asymmetric and dynamic response thresholds generated by a first-order 
Markov process. 

A certain amount of literature has focused on individual expectations. Mitchell, 
Smith and Weale (2002) developed an indicator based on firm-level responses. By 
comparing the individual responses with firm-by-firm realisations, Müller (2010) 
develops a variant of the Carlson-Parkin method with asymmetric and time invariant 
thresholds. The author introduces the “conditional absolute null” property, which is 
based on the empirical finding that the median of realized quantitative values 
corresponding to the “no change” category is zero. The main advantage of this new 
procedure is that it solves the zero response problem and that provides variance 
estimates closer to the sample variances. As opposed to the results obtained by Lui et al. 
(2011a), Müller (2009) finds that business expectations provide useful information. For 
an an appraisal of individual firm data on expectations see Zimmermann (1997). 

Recent studies for Central and Eastern countries are those of Sorić, Škrabić, and 
Čižmešija (2013) who assess the predictive properties of the composite indicators of the 
business and consumer surveys of the European Commission for the EU. The authors 
compare the forecasting performance of old EU members states vs. the new  members 
states by means of panel vector autoregressive models, finding no significant 
differences in both groups. These results somehow contrast to those obtained by Łyziak 
and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014) who in a using a panel data analysis find that the weight 
of future inflation in the formation of expectations in transition economies was smaller, 
which could in part be attributed to the higher volatility inflation rates in those 
countries. 



 7

In a recent study, Lahiri and Zhao (2015) propose a generalization of the Carlson-
Parkin method that allows time-varying and heterogeneous thresholds. The authors 
examine the quality of quantified expectations by comparing them to quantitative 
realizations at the firm-level, finding that allowing for cross-sectional heterogeneity and 
asymmetric and time-varying thresholds significant improvements are obtained, 
particularly during periods of uncertainty, with high levels of disagreement between 
respondents. 

As stated by Lee (1994), the differences between the actual values of a variable and 
quantified expectations may arise from three different sources: measurement or 
conversion error due to the use of quantification methods, expectational error due to the 
agents’ limited ability to predict the movements of the actual variable, and sampling 
errors. Since survey-based expectations are approximations of unobservable 
expectations, they inevitably entail a measurement error. 

Monte Carlo simulations allow to distinguish between these three sources of error. 
Nevertheless, there have been few attempts in the literature to compare quantification 
methods in a simulation context. Common (1985) and Nardo and Cabeza-Gutés (1999) 
analyse different quantification methods focusing on rational expectation testing rather 
than on their forecasting ability. Nardo (2003) and Claveria et al. (2006) assess the 
forecasting performance of different quantification methods in simulation experiments. 
By means of simulation-based expectations, Terai (2009) and Löffler (1999) estimate 
the measurement error introduced by the probabilistic method. 
 
3. Methodology – Symbolic regression via evolutionary computation 
 
3.1. Symbolic Regression 
 

SR attempts to find relationships biding together variables of a given dataset. It is a 
regression method where no model is assumed beforehand. The solution is based on 
discrete optimization, searching for the most fitting algebraic expression to the data (in 
the space of all possible expressions). Koza (1992) proposed the application of GP to 
implement SR. There are different strategies for solving a SR. GP is the most common 
approach due to its versatility. SR is particularly indicated when there is little 
information available about the process under consideration. 



 8

The wide applicability of this approach is attracting researchers from different areas 
(Sarradj and Geyer, 2014; Ceperic, Bako and Baric, 2014; Barmpalexis et al., 2011; 
Wu, Chou and Su, 2008; Cai et al., 2006;). SR plays an increasingly important role in 
many engineering applications, such as signal processing (Yao and Lin, 2009), 
industrial data analysis (Vladislavleva et al., 2010), and experimental design of 
manufacturing systems (Can and Heavey, 2011). 

The first application of SR via GP in economics is that of Koza (1992), who uses 
hierarchical genetic algorithms to analyse the non-linear “exchange equation” relating 
the price level, gross national product, money supply, and velocity of money. The 
author finds the relationship between quarterly values of the price level in the US (from 
1959 to 1988) and the three other elements of the equation. Since then, there have been 
only a few applications to economics. Álvarez-Díaz and Álvarez (2005) make use of GP 
to generate predictions of exchange rates of the yen and the pound to the US dollar. 

Kotanchek et al. (2010) detect outliers and identify models in large public datasets. 
The authors use SR via Pareto GP to identify records which are systematically under-or 
over-predicted by diverse ensembles of (thousands of) global non-linear symbolic 
regression models. Both approaches applied to the CountryData produce insights into 
outlier vs. prototypes division among world countries and about driving economic 
properties predicting gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.  

Kronberger et al. (2011) use SR to identify variable interactions in a large dataset of 
economic indicators to estimate US CPI inflation. Kľúčik (2012) uses GP in the 
estimation of foreign trade (total exports and imports to Slovakia) via SR. Acosta-
González et al. (2012) apply GP to select the best econometric model for explaining the 
severity of the 2008 crisis. 

More recently, Wei (2013) proposes a hybrid model that uses an adaptive 
expectation GA to optimize an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) 
to forecast stock price trends (the stock index in Taiwan). Yang et al. (2015) propose a 
data-driven approach that uses SR to forecast oil production. Hao et al. (2015) develop a 
GA-based learning approach to analyse survey data related to customer satisfaction with 
online travel agencies websites. Chen et al. (2015) also use an adaptive GA (AGA) to 
hybridize a SVR model. The authors find that the proposed AGA seasonal SVR 
outperforms AGA-SVR and BPNN models to forecast holiday daily tourist flows to a 
site in China (Mountain Huangshan).

3.2. Genetic Programming 
 
GP belongs to the broader class of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). EAs can be 

classified in genetic algorithms (GAs) (Holland, 1975) and GP (Cramer, 1985). While 
basic GAs use the fixed length binary string representation to code potential solutions of 
a problem, not allowing the model structure to vary during the evolution, GP uses a 
more general representation scheme, using tree-structured, variable length 
representations suitable to nonlinear modelling. A recent economic application of GAs 
is that of Acosta-González and Fernández (2014), who use a GA to forecast the 
financial failure of firms. 

GP can be considered as an extension of GAs. GP was introduced by Cramer 
(1985). The works of Koza (1992, 1995) enabled to apply them to other areas such as 
AI and machine learning. Koza (1992) first proposed the use of GP to find a regression 
tree defining analytical functions that best fit the data. The author suggest that finding 
the functional form of the models that best fits observed empirical data (instead of 
selecting the model a priori as in conventional modelling) can be regarded as searching 
for the computer program which produces the desired output for given inputs (that best 
fits the observed data). The author proposes finding the best single computer program 
(the solution to the problem) by applying a Darwinian competition based on the 
principle of survival and reproduction of the fittest. 

GP is an evolutionary method that imitates aspects of biological evolution to find a 
computer program that solves a given problem through gradual evolutionary changes 
(Koza, 1992). In GP, populations of computer programs are bred using Darwinian 
competition and genetic operations. The competition is based on the principle of 
survival and reproduction of the fittest. By means of genetic operators (crossover and 
mutation) the structure is evolved and optimized for making it more appropriate for 
model approximation. Computer programs are mated so as to create potentially more fit 
new offspring programs. The best single individual program produced by this process 
after many generations may be a satisfactory solution to the problem. Dabhi and 
Chaudhary (2015) and O’Neil et al. (2010) review the main issues related to GP. 

New improved versions of GP have been proposed in the literature. Ferreria (2001) 
introduced gene expression programming (GEP). Peng et al. (2014) propose an 
improved gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm especially suitable for dealing 
with SR problems. GEP is developed by Ferreira (2001). Zelinka (2005) introduces 



 10 

analytical programming, and shows its ability to synthesize suitable solutions 
(programs) in SR. Gandomi and Roke (2015) compare the forecasting performance of 
ANN models to that of GEP techniques. Poli et al. (2010) review the state of the art in 
GP. 

This approach is particularly indicated to find patterns in large data sets, where little 
or no information is known about the system. GP is capable to evolve the structure of 
the models in combination with the parameters of the model. In our case, the use of GP 
is justified by the fact that if there is an arbitrary functional relationship between a large 
data set of variables, which are ordinal variables from surveys, and a macroeconomic 
objective measure, which is the GDP. This way, we are able to find the “fittest” 
combinations of surveys variables that are more adequate to track the evolution of the 
economy. 
 
4. Experimental setup 

 
In this study we present a new quantification procedure of economic expectations in 

the form of survey indicators, such as the balance or the CESIfo indicators. This new 
method is based on SR via GP. This flexible approach finds optimal combinations of 
responses or survey variables that describe a quantitative variable used as a yardstick, in 
our case the year-on-year growth of the GDP. In the present study we use agent’s 
expectations from the CESIfo WES and GDP data retrieved from the OECD web 
(https://data.oecd.org/gdp/quarterly-gdp.htm#indicator-chart). 

The main objective of the experiment is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to 
quantify agents’ expectations expressed in the form of survey indicators by means of SR 
approach. Given the functional expression, we obtain building blocks, which can be 
regarded as parts of the formula, and that are defined as simple combinations of input 
variables by means of basic functions. We have extracted building blocks for the top 20 
functions returned by the GP algorithm for 28 countries of the OECD, focusing the 
analysis on ten Central and Eastern European economies, for which we combine the 
most fitted empirical models to generate forecasts of economic growth. 

The application of GP requires is based on the following steps:  
1. The selection of the independent variables. In our case the 12 variables of the WES 

presented on Table 1. 



 11 

2. The set of functions to be used. We have restricted the experiment to the mean, the 
maximum, the minimum, the ratio, and the logarithm. 

3. The definition of a fitness measure that reflects to what extent the individual 
function reproduces the data used for the regression. As an error metric we have 
applied the root mean squared error (RMSE). 

4. The setting of the parameters that control the run, and deciding what termination 
criterion to be used. We have chosen a population of 1000, and have limited the 
maximum number of generations to 150. 
As a result, the best individual functions from all generations are selected. In this 

study we have implemented a fully configurable simple EA set up using the open source 
Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms Package (DEAP) framework implemented in 
Python. 
 
5. Data 
 

The WES is carried out quarterly by the CESIfo Institute for Economic Research. 
The survey questionnaire focuses on qualitative information. Respondents are asked to 
assess their country’s general situation and expectations regarding important economic 
indicators (overall economy, foreign trade, inflation, interest rates, share prices, etc.). 
The individual replies are combined for each country without weighting. The grading 
procedure consists in giving a grade of 9 to positive replies, a grade of 5 to indifferent 
replies, and a grade of 1 to negative replies. The survey results are published as 
aggregated data. The aggregation procedure is based on country classifications. Within 
each country group or region, the country results are weighted according to the share of 
the specific country’s exports and imports in total world trade (CESifo World Economic 
Survey, 2011). For a detailed analysis of WES data see Henzel and Wollmershäuser 
(2005), Stangl (2007, 2008) and Hutson et al. (2014). Table 1 shows all the variables 
used in this study. We conduct the experiment from the second quarter of 2000 to the 
first quarter of 2014.

The Economic Climate Index (ECI) is an aggregate indicator obtained as the 
arithmetic mean of assessments of the general economic situation and the expectations 
for the economic situation in the next six months. As a rule, the trend in the Ifo ECI 
correlates closely with the actual business-cycle trend measured in annual growth rates 
of real GDP. Franses et al. (2011) compare experts forecasts with pure model forecasts. 
Robinzonov et al. (2012) use the Ifo Business Climate and other aggregate indicators 
from surveys as exogenous variable for industrial production forecasting. In Table 2 we 
present a descriptive analysis of the ECI for the ten Central and Eastern European 
economies evaluated in this study: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic.

6. Results 
 

In this section we present the results of how all these survey variables interact to 
approximate the evolution of the GDP in ten Central and Eastern European countries. 
First, we visually compare the evolution of the proposed SR-generated indicator to that 
of the ECI (Fig. 1) and the GDP (Fig. 2). Second, we analyse the forecasting 
performance of the quantified expectations in ten Central and Eastern European 
countries by comparing them to a naïve model used as a benchmark to compute the 
mean absolute scaled error (MASE). Results of this comparison are presented in Table 
3.

On Fig. 1 we can see that the proposed SR-generated indicator and the CESIfo ECI 

both show a similar pattern of evolution. The main difference resides in the scale. This 
is especially evident during the 2008 financial crisis, when the quantified expectations’ 
downward reaction is of greater magnitude. With the aim of assessing the ability of the 
proposed proxy of agents’ expectations to approximate GDP growth, in Fig. 2 we 
compare the evolution of the quantified expectations via SR to the evolution of the year-
on-year growth rates of GDP in the ten Central and Eastern European economies 
analysed.  

Regarding the differences across the analysed economies, while in most countries 
agents’ expectations seem to advance turning points, especially regarding the 2008 
financial crisis, in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia and the Slovak Republic the opposite 
holds. As a rule, SR-quantified expectations seem to correlate closely with the actual 
oscillations of GDP. These results are in line with those of Lahiri and Zhao (2015), who 
note the potential gains in forecast accuracy of quantified expectations under more 
relaxed assumptions. 

In Table 3 we compare the forecast accuracy of the quantified expectations used as a 
proxy for GDP growth between the different economies using the naïve method as a 
benchmark. In order to do so we use the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) proposed 
by Hyndman and Koehler (2006). This measure of forecast accuracy scales the errors by 
the in-sample MAE obtained with a random walk. As official data are published with a 
delay of more than a quarter with respect to survey data, we use two-step ahead naïve 
forecasts as a benchmark. This measure is independent of the scale of the data, and it 
does not suffer from some of the problems presented by other relative measures of 
forecast accuracy such as the relative MAE (Hyndman and Koehler, 2006).  

Additionally, this statistic is easy to interpret: values larger than one are indicative 
that the quantified agents’ expectations are worse than the average forecast computed 
in-sample with the benchmark model. SR-quantified expectations show the best 
forecasting performance in the Czech Republic and Hungary, where SR-based estimates 
outperform the naïve model used as a benchmark. 

Given that the 2008 financial crisis influenced the forecasting accuracy of survey-
based measures of economic expectations (Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak, 2014), we 
re-compute the MASE differentiating between the pre-crisis sub-period (2000-2007), 
the crisis (2007-2010), and the post-crisis sub-period (Table 4).

The results in Table 4 show that forecast accuracy of survey-based expectations 

significantly worsened during the crisis in all countries except the Czech Republic. 
Agents’ expectations were more accurate in the post-crisis years than in the pre-crisis 
years in all countries except in Lithuania and Poland. These results are in line with those 
of Łyziak and Mackiewicz-Łyziak (2014), who also found that the 2008 financial crisis 
period has led to a decrease in expectational errors in transition economies. In the last 
sub-period, SR-quantified expectations outperform the naïve model in six out of the ten 
countries. At the opposite end, in Croatia and Lithuania, agents’ expectations quantified 
by means of SR via GP are less able to anticipate the year-on-year growth rates of GDP. 
This result could be explained in part by the high dispersion observed in the ECI 
(Lithuania presents the highest rang, and Croatia the second highest variation 
coefficient). Additionally, in the case of Lithuania, mean square errors values were very 
high, indicating that forecast errors are highly concentrated in a few periods.

7. Summary and conclusions 
 

Economic expectations have become essential to assess the current state of the 
economy. Survey expectations are a primary source of agents’ economic expectations. 
However, qualitative expectations are usually quantified in order to forecast 
macroeconomic aggregates or to test economic hypothesis. In this study we propose an 
empirical approach to the quantification of qualitative survey responses. This data-
driven method of modelling survey-based agents’ expectations avoids making 
assumptions about the subjective probability distribution of respondents. 

With this aim, we use symbolic regression via genetic programming to derive a set of 
mathematical functional forms that link survey expectations of the World Economic 
Survey and economic growth. By linearly combining these expressions, we generate 
estimates of GP growth in ten Central and Eastern European economies. Finally, we 
analyse the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on agents’ expectations, by assessing the 
capacity of survey-based expectations to anticipate future economic growth, finding that 
the crisis period has led to an improvement in the forecasting performance of agents’ 
expectations in Central and Eastern European economies. 

We find that the SR-quantified expectations correlate closely with the actual 
oscillations of the economic activity and with the CESIfo Economic Climate Index. 
This result shows that this assumption-free approach to quantify survey expectations on 
the direction of change may provide gains in forecast accuracy. Since empirical 
modelling with symbolic regression via genetic programming allows selecting the fittest 
models of interaction between agents' expectations and the official quantitative series 
they refer to, this approach may prove very useful both for researchers and practitioners. 

Despite the usefulness of the proposed framework for forecasting and for quantifying 
survey-based expectations, this study is not without limitations. One aspect that has not 
been addressed is the use of this approach to search for the optimal proxy indicator of 
the quantitative variable used as a yardstick. Another issue left for future research is the 
use of this new set of quantified expectations to test economic hypothesis, which would 
provide new insight into the formation of expectations or the behaviour of the Phillips 
curve.

Extending the analysis to the rest of the countries of the World Economic Survey 
would allow to analyse differences across countries worldwide. It would also be of 
interest to replicate the experiment using micro data. A comparison with other 
questionnaires would allow to analyse whether the obtained functional forms are 
extensive to different survey data. Another question to be considered in further research 
is whether the implementation of alternative evolutionary algorithms may improve the 
forecasting performance of symbolic regression-based quantified expectations.
