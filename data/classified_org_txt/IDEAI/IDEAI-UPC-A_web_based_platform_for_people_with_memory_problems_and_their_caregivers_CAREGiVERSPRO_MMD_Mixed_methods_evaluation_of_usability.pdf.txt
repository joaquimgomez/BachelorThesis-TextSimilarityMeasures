Abstract

Background: The increasing number of people with dementia (PwD) drives research exploring Web-based support interventions
to provide effective care for larger populations. In this concept, a Web-based platform (CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD, 620911) was
designed to (1) improve the quality of life for PwD, (2) reduce caregiver burden, (3) reduce the financial costs for care, and (4)
reduce administration time for health and social care professionals.
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability and usefulness of CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD platform for
PwD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), informal caregivers, and health and social care professionals with respect to a wider
strategy followed by the project to enhance the user-centered approach. A secondary aim of the study was to collect
recommendations to improve the platform before the future pilot study.
Methods: A mixed methods design was employed for recruiting PwD or MCI (N=24), informal caregivers (N=24), and
professionals (N=10). Participants were asked to rate their satisfaction, the perceived usefulness, and ease of use of each function
of the platform. Qualitative questions about the improvement of the platform were asked when participants provided low scores
for a function. Testing occurred at baseline and 1 week after participants used the platform. The dropout rate from baseline to the
follow-up was approximately 10% (6/58).
Results: After 1 week of platform use, the system was useful for 90% (20.75/23) of the caregivers and for 89% (5.36/6) of the
professionals. When users responded to more than 1 question per platform function, the mean of satisfied users per function was
calculated. These user groups also provided positive evaluations for the ease of use (caregivers: 82%, 18.75/23; professionals:
97%, 5.82/6) and their satisfaction with the platform (caregivers: 79%, 18.08/23; professionals: 73%, 4.36/6). Ratings from PwD

were lower than the other groups for usefulness (57%, 13/23), ease of use (41%, 9.4/23), and overall satisfaction (47%, 11/23)
with the platform (P<.05). Qualitative comments related to both improvements for functionality and the platform interface.
Conclusions: Although caregivers and professionals were overall satisfied with the platform, further adaptations were
recommended by PwD. This reiterates the importance of the involvement of end users in the development of Web-based
interventions. Recommendations from users in this paper apply for the interface and functionality of a wider range of Web-based
support interventions.

Introduction

Background
The increasing number of people with dementia (PwD) and its
progressive nature has led researchers to explore tools to provide
support to larger numbers of PwD and their caregivers. A range
of Web-based support interventions have been designed and
evaluated including websites providing material and training
for caregivers [1,2] and Web-based portals to enable
communication with health care professionals [3]. Other
Web-based support interventions combine educational material,
communication with health care professionals, and monitoring
of PwD well-being through Web-based questionnaires [4].

To aid the development of successful Web-based support
interventions, researchers utilize user-centered designs to refine
devices and technology to meet the needs of the targeted
population [5]. A continuous and iterative involvement of users
(eg, through focus groups or interviews) is widely seen vital in
the design of technological solutions [6]. Usability in this context
is measured as the user-friendliness (eg, ease to learn) and
perceived usefulness in addressing users’ needs [7].

In a recent study, a Web-based portal (the Digital Alzheimer
Center; DAC) was developed in Netherlands for PwD and
caregivers [8]. DAC provides information on dementia,
promotes peer support and communication, and enables
communication with health professionals. The usefulness and
usability of the DAC was assessed through evaluation from
PwD and caregivers. Both the participant groups found DAC
useful. Involving users in the development and evaluation of
Web-based support interventions enables researchers to
understand their unmet needs and increase user autonomy [9].
Other projects developing technological devices for PwD and
caregivers have also taken into account the perceived usability
from the perspective of end users. In the Skills Training and
Reskilling (STAR) project [3], a Web-based training portal was
developed to offer learning opportunities to caregivers, as well
as peer support and contact with care professionals. Informal
caregivers, volunteers in dementia care, and professional
caregivers rated the STAR Web-based portal as useful and
user-friendly. In the Rosetta project [10], 3 previously developed
tools were merged, the COGKNOW Day Navigator [11], the
Emerge system [12], and the Unattended Autonomous

Surveillance system. This platform is offered through a touch
screen and provides reminders for activities, a phone dialing
system with pictures, a radio button, activity support for
performing everyday tasks (eg, preparing coffee), and safety
warnings (eg, the door is open). The platform also offers
monitoring and emergency function with sensors monitoring
daily activities, as well as automatic detection of emergencies.
Data from PwD, informal caregivers, professionals, and
dementia experts were collected to rank the usefulness of the
Rosetta functions and to collect information about improving
the system.

Aims and Objectives
This study aims to explore the usability and user-friendliness
of the CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD platform [13] through
evaluations performed by PwD or mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), informal caregivers, and health and social care
professionals. The CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD platform targets
the dyad of PwD or MCI and their informal caregivers, alongside
their health and social care professionals. The platform is being
developed based on a user-centered approach identifying (1)
the characteristics of PwD and caregivers affecting their ability
to use Web-based tools and (2) the user requirements for the
platform functionality. The platform is being piloted at 4 centers
in Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. One innovation
of the CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD platform is that it integrates
many features that have previously been tested individually,
namely: (1) peer-to-peer social contacts through circles of
friends, (2) forums or cafes for open discussions, (3) practical
information about dementia and local resources, (4) open
monitoring of user well-being through Web-based questionnaires
and activity measures through interactions with the platform,
and (5) guided personalized educational material about living
with dementia or MCI and caregiving. The platform integrates
a gamification engine designed to increase user engagement.
Behind the platform, a machine learning engine will attempt to
present the features of the platform to users to maximize the
benefit. The aim of the platform is to improve the quality of life
for PwD or MCI and reduce caregiver stress. Secondary aims
are to delay institutionalization for PwD, reduce care costs, and
reduce administration time and costs for professionals. The
functions available in the early version of the platform in the
usability test are presented in Table 1.

The aim of this study was to test the usability of the early version
of the platform (usefulness, ease of use, user satisfaction) for
PwD or MCI, primary caregivers and professionals. A secondary
aim was to generate recommendations from users that could be
utilized to further improve the platform.

Methods

Design
The study employed a mixed methods design and included the
collection of both quantitative and qualitative data. This is in
line with the previous studies that have employed a combination
of qualitative and quantitative methods to measure the usability
of Web-based support interventions. In the COGKNOW project
[7], data for the user-friendliness, the usefulness, and the
effectiveness of the intervention were collected though
qualitative interviews and questionnaires. In a similar way, the
researchers in the DAC project [8] collected usability data
through observation, a Web-based survey, and semistructured
interviews. The mixed methods designs combine the benefits
from both quantitative and qualitative approaches and increase
the validity of results [14]. This is because the mixed method
designs capture the understanding of participants for a topic or
a concept through closed, quantitative questions and provide a
deeper understanding for the responses of participants through
open, qualitative questions. Data for mixed methods designs
can be collected through a questionnaire including both closed
and open questions [15,16]. Therefore, the participants in this
study completed questionnaires with both closed questions about
the perceived ease of use, usefulness and their satisfaction with
each function of the platform, and with open questions in the

event that participants were not satisfied with one or more of
the platform functions.

Following a convergent parallel design [14], the researchers in
this study collected quantitative and qualitative data
simultaneously and then merged both types of data to interpret
the results. Examples of platform functions are presented in
Figures 1 and 2. Ethical approval for CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD
project is obtained from the Ethics committee of the Faculty of
Health and Social Care (United Kingdom), the Comitato Etico
Regionale delle Marche (Italy), the Centre Hospitalier
Universitaire de Rouen (France), the Comité de Protection des
Personnes (France), the Fundació Universitària del Bages
(Spain), and the Comité de Ética de Investigación Clínica
Fundació Unió (Spain).

Participants and Recruitment
Users were recruited in Ancona (Italy), Hull (United Kingdom),
Manresa (Spain), and Rouen (France) from local health and
social care providers and community support groups. Inclusion
criteria for PwD or MCI (N=24) were (1) to have a self-reported
diagnosis of dementia or MCI, (2) to be at least 50 years old,
and (3) to have an informal primary caregiver who agreed to
participate too. All PwD or MCI were retired from work. For
primary caregivers (N=24) and professionals (N=10), the
inclusion criteria required them to be older than 18 years and
have adequate language skills in the country of testing, and for
the caregivers to be an informal, unpaid carer supporting PwD
or MCI. A total of 12 caregivers were employed on a full-time
basis in addition to their caregiving responsibilities. Another
12 caregivers were retired from work. Demographic
characteristics are presented in Table 2.

Materials
All testing material was developed initially in English and
subsequently translated by the researchers of the project into
the other languages (French, Italian, and Spanish). These
materials included printed information sheets for participants,
consent forms, demographic sheets, usability questionnaires for
each user group (PwD/MCI, informal caregivers, health and
social care professionals), and a short user guide for the
platform.

A usability questionnaire was developed for each user group
based on the different platform functions designed for each
group. The questionnaires for PwD and caregivers consisted of
30 items, and the questionnaire for professionals included 15
items. The questionnaires were developed based on usability
questions from the previous research [3,7] and from questions
emerging from the previous stages of the project. Thus, the
questionnaires included questions about the ease of use and
usefulness of each platform function, as well as about user
satisfaction. They were designed to be administered by
researchers. The questionnaires also included questions about
the willingness of users to use the platform in the future and to
recommend it to others. Responses were recorded on a 5-point
Likert scale from 0 to 4 indicating strong disagreement to strong
agreement. When users provided a neutral or negative score (2
or less on the Likert scale), they were asked by researchers to
provide further information and suggestions for the improvement
of the platform function.

Procedure
Once users consented to participate in the study, researchers
created individual accounts and demonstrated the platform.
During the demonstration of each platform function, users were
verbally asked to rate the ease of use, usefulness, and their
satisfaction with the platform. When users provided a neutral
or negative response to the quantitative questions, they were
immediately asked to provide qualitative feedback about this
function. This method was used to avoid confusion, that is, by
asking feedback for all platform functions together. Scores were
collected by researchers through the usability questionnaires at
baseline and the 1-week follow-up to measure the usability of
the platform before and after users had access to it for 1 week.
Participants were tested at the Rouen University Hospital
(France), at the Sant Andreu Hospital of the Sociosanitari
Foundation of Manresa (Spain), at the Centro Diurno Anziani
Licio Visintini (Italy), or at their own environment (United

Kingdom). Technical support was available via phone or home
visits.

Data Analyses
Demographics were analyzed with descriptive statistics.
Quantitative data from the questionnaires were analyzed with
nonparametric tests to show differences in the perceived
usefulness and usability of the platform between baseline and
follow-up testing, and differences between the user groups.

Data from qualitative questions were analyzed with thematic
analysis [17]. PZ, EW, CW, and RD read and reread the
interview transcripts and identified the emerging themes. The
themes were discussed until consensus was reached and are
presented in the Results section. Qualitative data aim to support
the quantitative findings and to provide a deeper understanding
of the quantitative responses from participants. Therefore,
quantitative and qualitative data are merged for interpretation
in the Discussion section [14].

Results

For analysis, the mean and percentages of users within each
group, who agreed with the statements supporting the platform
functions (responding 3 or 4 on the Likert scales), are presented
in Table 3. When users were asked more than 1 question per
platform function, the mean of satisfied users was calculated.
Of all users, 6 users (1 PwD, 1 informal caregiver, 4
professionals) participated only at baseline testing and were
excluded from further analysis.

At baseline, the platform was considered useful by the majority
of PwD (65%, 15.5/24), informal caregivers (87%, 21/24), and
professionals (85%, 8.45/10). Satisfaction rates were also
positive from most of PwD (58%, 13.92/24), caregivers (83%,
20/24), and professionals (65%, 6.45/10). Ease of use scores
did not follow the same pattern, with 48% (11.58/24) for PwD
finding the platform easy to use. In contrast, 85% (20/24) of
caregivers and 84% (8.36/10) of professionals appreciated the
ease of use of the platform.

Scores from the follow-up indicated that the perceived
usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction with the platform
increased for professionals after using the platform for 1 week.
The ease of use and user satisfaction declined for PwD and
caregivers, as well as in perceived usefulness for PwD.

Usability Scores at Baseline and Follow-Up Visits
To enable comparisons between the usability scores at baseline
and after 1 week of platform use, the means and standard
deviations of usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction for all
platform functions were calculated for each user group (Table
4).

Mann-Whitney U tests did not confirm significant differences
between baseline and follow-up usability scores for PwD,
caregivers, or professionals.

Tables 3 and 4 reveal a discrepancy between the baseline and
follow-up scores for PwD. Although usefulness means are
increased for PwD at the follow-up compared with the baseline
(Table 4), fewer PwD find the platform useful (Table 3).

Usability Scores Across the Three User Groups
Kruskal-Wallis H tests revealed significant differences at
baseline between PwD, caregivers, and professionals in
usefulness (H(2)=12.1, P=.01), ease of use (H(2)=14.4, P<.001),
and satisfaction (H(2)=12.1, P=.01). Post hoc tests showed these
differences to be between PwD and carers in usefulness

(P<.001), ease of use (P<.001), and satisfaction (P<.001).
Differences were also found between PwD and professionals
in the ease of use (P=.02).

The results from the follow-up data also revealed significant
differences between the user groups in usefulness (H(2) =16.6,
P<.001), ease of use (H(2)=18.5, P<.001), and satisfaction
(H(2)=12.0, P=.01). These differences were found between
PwD and carers in usefulness (P<.001), ease of use (P<.001),
and satisfaction (P<.001). Differences were also found between
PwD and professionals in usefulness (P=.01), ease of use
(P<.001), and satisfaction (P=.045).

Improvement: Overall Feedback and Guidance for
Technology Projects

Interface
PwD and caregivers preferred bigger color contrasts and font
sizes, as well as images and icons rather than text menus.
Emoticons were used in the platform to like or not-like
messages, but both PwD and caregivers found this confusing.

Additional Functions
PwD suggested including cognitive training games in the
platform to train their memory. Caregivers wanted an easy way
to send instant messages to health and social care professionals.

Language Used
Caregivers commented on the language used on the platform.
They felt that terms such as “dementia” should be avoided in
favor of memory problems.

Privacy
All users were concerned with the privacy of information that
PwD and caregivers insert in the platform. They suggested using
short explanations in each page of the platform to remind users
who will see each piece of information.

Feedback per Platform Function

Home
The major social-network function of the platform allows users
to publish messages to circles of friends and to reply to
messages. At baseline there was wide acceptance that these
functions would be useful and had been implemented in a way
that made them easy. For caregivers and professionals, this
perception either remained the same or was reinforced by use
of the platform. However, PwD were less convinced and this
did not increase with experience (Tables 5 and 6). PwD found
it difficult to find previous published messages and pictures.

My Network
The My Network feature allows users to establish their circle
of friends with whom they can share information and posts.
This process involves the sending and possible acceptance of
an invitation. PwD rated this feature lower than the other user
groups, especially for the ease of use. Caregivers would prefer
to receive notifications about invitation requests to the PwD
they care for. Caregivers suggested that no notification was
better than a reject notification, if an invitation was not accepted,
to avoid upsetting users. They also suggested they would like
to be able to find new contacts through common interests such
as hobbies. Professionals required more information about PwD
and the ability to download a file containing all the uploaded
information and the responses to questionnaires by PwD.

My Profile
PwD provided the lowest usability scores and satisfaction rates
among the 3 user groups for updating personal information.
PwD and caregivers were concerned about privacy settings and
who had access to the information they uploaded.

My Agenda
Caregivers and professionals rated higher, than PwD, the
usability of the agenda function for noting appointments and
events. All user groups reported that they would like to control
who can see their own appointments. PwD and caregivers also

suggested that the upcoming appointments should be presented
in a chronological order (with the closest appointment on the
top of the page). PwD also suggested having options for
selecting which appointments are displayed, for example,
appointments could be selected to be displayed on a monthly,
weekly, or daily basis.

Invitations
The majority of caregivers and professionals appreciated
reviewing invitations from other users. PwD would prefer a
standout notification, such as a notification in red color.
Caregivers would prefer to be able to click on notifications to
read them, as well as to show notifications in the home page to
alert them for a request.

Café (Forum)
The forum was rated lower by PwD than by other user groups.
The majority of PwD expressed their concerns about a possible
inappropriate use and the need for the forum to be monitored
by administrators. PwD and caregivers also suggested that they
needed information about who can see information in the forums
and the need to keep the individual forums for PwD, caregivers,
and professionals separate. However, in contrast, professionals
suggested that their user group should have access to all forums.

My Health
This platform function for uploading health and medical
information for PwD and caregivers appears as Manage users
to professionals and was the least appreciated of all the
functions. Professionals reported that important information
about PwD, including their cognitive level, is missing (see
Create User Profiles and Manage Users). PwD underlined the
need to include only user-friendly questionnaires with general
questions, such as generic questions about their mood. PwD
and caregivers requested a record of scores from completed
questionnaires. Caregivers were concerned about who can see
their information.

Local Resources
The majority of people in all user groups expressed overall
satisfaction with the information provided about local resources.
This platform function was the most appreciated function by
PwD and caregivers. PwD and caregivers suggested a comment
box under each local resource to leave feedback for other users
should be available. Caregivers suggested that users should be
able to upload new local resources.

Create User Profiles and Manage Users
Scores from professionals indicated their satisfaction with
creating profiles for users, while they gave a lower rating for
the platform function for monitoring PwD and caregivers.
Professionals suggested that scores for PwD cognitive ability
should be provided. They also suggested a “user summary” to
be generated for them, including information about the health
and current emotional well-being of PwD and caregivers.

Discussion

Principal Findings
This study explored the usability of the current version of the
CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD platform through ratings and
feedback provided from PwD or MCI, primary caregivers, and
health and social care professionals. The results revealed
significant differences in the usability scores of the 3 user
groups, with caregivers and professionals rating the platform
more useful and easy to use than PwD. Differences in scores
between baseline and 1 week after using the platform were not
statistically significant. However, although the mean of
perceived usefulness of the platform for PwD was increased in
the follow-up testing, the number of users finding the platform
useful was decreased. Analysis of the individual functions of
the platform showed that the 3 user groups held different
opinions of the usability of the platform functions. Professionals
considered the function to connect with users in the platform
for peer support a necessary function and providing information
about themselves as professionals to be less useful. PwD and
caregivers considered the information for local resources to be
the most important function of the platform for them and the
peer support forum to be the least important. PwD appreciated
some functions of the platform, such as the social networking
service, and showed their interest to communicate with others;
however, their scores for the ease of use of these functions
underline their inexperience with technology. Suggestions for
further platform functions for PwD and MCI concern games
for cognitive training and instant communication with health
and social care professionals through the platform. Professionals
suggested including important health information about PwD
and caregivers that is currently missing. These findings show
that priorities differ between the 3 user groups and thus,
platforms for each user group should be designed to fit the needs
of each particular group. Findings from this study can be used
for the development of future Web-based interventions, as well
as for the further development of CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD
platform.

Developing Web-Based Interventions Based on User
Characteristics
PwD evaluated the platform as less useful and easy to use than
caregivers and professionals. This difference may reflect the
age difference between the mean ages of the user groups since
PwD were 20 to 40 years older than caregivers and
professionals. This finding is in line with the literature [18],
where older adults needed more time than young adults to
perform tasks using touch screens. The decline of cognitive
functioning for PwD and MCI may be another explanation for
the low usability scores. Literature suggests that PwD prefer
less cluttered webpages, with less information per page,
requiring less cognitive effort than other user groups [8].

Another possible explanation of the variability in the evaluation
of the 3 groups concerns their experience with technology. The
majority of PwD reported no previous knowledge of accessing
the Web. Evidence suggest that older adults are keen to use
technology devices when they are trained to use them [19],
when they are aware of the benefits [20], when technology

enables their communication with other people, and when they
have previous experience with computers at work [21].

The discrepancies between the usability scores of the 3 user
groups can also be explained by the different needs of these
groups. The lower scores of PwD indicate the need to adapt the
interface and functionality of the platform to meet their needs,
such as to simplify the interface for this group. The need to
adjust the interface according to personal preferences is in line
with the previous research [10] as individual preferences vary.

Guidance for Technology Projects
Qualitative results from this study may act as a guide for
developing future Web-based support interventions for PwD or
MCI and their caregivers.

Interface
The need of PwD and caregivers for less busy pages in the
platform, more images, larger font size and color contrasts, and
fewer colors on each page shows the importance of platform
adaptation and adjustment for each user group. The technology
design for older people needs to be adjusted to their motor,
sensory, and cognitive abilities, including their visual and
auditory capacity [6] because age-related impairments are likely
to affect older adults’ engagement with computer systems [18].

Content and Functionality
PwD and caregivers were concerned about the privacy of the
platform. They requested explanations about who has access to
their information and underlined the importance of monitoring
the platform for an inappropriate use.

The variability in the importance of each platform function
between the user groups, such as PwD finding Web-based
questionnaires not useful but professionals needing more
questionnaires, suggests that the dyads of PwD and caregivers
have different needs and interests than those which may be
anticipated by professionals and developers. This finding
underlines the importance of involving end users in the
development of Web-based support interventions to meet their
needs [9].

The main limitation of this study was the lack of privacy and
security arrangements in the early version of the platform. Future
projects should consider the suggestions provided by PwD and
caregivers in this study when developing technological
interventions. Simpler interventions can be developed for PwD
with uncluttered interfaces and an appropriate number of
functionalities so that end users will engage with the
interventions. Privacy issues about sharing information on
Internet can be addressed with short statements explaining who
can see this information while implementing in the platform all
the regulations related with data protection and privacy at the
European and national levels. Future research on
technology-based platforms can also collect data about the usage
of the platform. In a similar way, data for the number of visits
per platform page could show the preferences of users.

Conclusions
Involving end users in the development of Web-based support
interventions is necessary to understand their needs and

preferences. The discrepancies in the evaluations from PwD,
caregivers, and professionals highlighted that these needs and
preferences vary in each group. The different preferences have
been identified both in respect of the interface and the content
of the platform. The feedback collected through this study will

not only inform the development of CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD
platform but also provide valuable suggestions for the
development of Web-based support interventions for PwD and
caregivers.
