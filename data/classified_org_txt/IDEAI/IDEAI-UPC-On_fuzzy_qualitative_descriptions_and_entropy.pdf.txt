Abstract

This paper models the assessments of a group of experts when evaluat-
ing different magnitudes, features or objects by using linguistic descriptions.
A new general representation of linguistic descriptions is provided by uni-
fying ordinal and fuzzy perspectives. Fuzzy-qualitative labels are proposed
as a generalization of the concept of qualitative labels over a well-ordered
set. A lattice structure is established in the set of fuzzy-qualitative labels
to enable the introduction of fuzzy-qualitative descriptions as L-fuzzy sets.
A theorem is given that characterizes finite fuzzy partitions using fuzzy-
qualitative labels, the cores and supports of which are qualitative labels.
This theorem leads to a mathematical justification for commonly-used fuzzy
partitions of real intervals via trapezoidal fuzzy sets. The information of a
fuzzy-qualitative label is defined using a measure of specificity, in order to
introduce the entropy of fuzzy-qualitative descriptions.

1. Introduction

One of the current challenges in knowledge representation and knowledge-
based systems for decision making is the use of qualitative descriptions of
variable values. This becomes necessary when numerical measurements of
variables are unavailable, or when they are not convenient. In these cases,
linguistic descriptions are used to represent uncertainty, as well as different
levels of precision [5, 6, 10, 16, 21]. These types of systems have been used
widely in engineering, as well as in biological, medical, economic, and social
science applications, and recent examples can be found in [12, 19].

Two main areas of linguistic information representation can be found in
the literature [18]. Some approaches use fuzzy representations of linguis-
tic descriptions [16, 17]. On the other hand, some approaches use ordinal
models and do not make an effective use of membership functions, being
based either on 2-tuple modeling [5, 10] or on order-of-magnitude qualita-
tive models [20, 25, 26]. Methodologies involving different levels of precision
during linguistic modeling can be found in both main areas. In the case
of fuzzy approaches, they usually rely on a hierarchy defined from a fuzzy
partition of a real interval by means of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy num-
bers [6, 16, 17]. Approaches based on 2-tuple modeling consider a linguistic
hierarchy to deal with different levels of precision [5, 10]. Approaches based
on absolute order-of-magnitude qualitative models use different levels of pre-
cision or abstraction in linguistic modeling by means of qualitative labels
that in some cases correspond to sub-intervals coming from a partition of a
real interval [25, 26]. Furthermore, the concept of entropy was formalized

to measure the amount of information both in fuzzy and in ordinal research
areas [1, 20].

On the other hand, there are situations where uncertainty applies, not
only to the lack of numerical knowledge of the values of a variable, but also
to the selection of the linguistic terms describing such values [13, 24]. To
manage these situations, new fuzzy models were developed. For example,
type-2 fuzzy sets were introduced as fuzzy sets whose membership grades
are themselves fuzzy sets [9, 11, 13, 14], and other fuzzy models, such as
discrete interval type-2 fuzzy sets and hesitant fuzzy sets, consider a set of
possible values when defining the membership of an element [9, 21, 24, 28].
In addition, entropy has been studied in several fuzzy set theory extensions in
recent literature, for instance, in hesitant, intuitionistic, type-2 and interval
valued fuzzy sets [7, 23, 27, 30].

This paper presents a mathematical contribution to the area of decision
making. It models the assessments of a group of experts when evaluating
different magnitudes, features or objects by using linguistic descriptions. In
addition, it proposes a measure of the amount of information delivered by the
different experts in these group decision-making processes. A new general
representation of linguistic descriptions is provided by unifying ordinal and
fuzzy perspectives.

Fuzzy-qualitative labels are introduced as fuzzy sets over a set S, whose
elements can be associated with linguistic terms, by extending the model
proposed in [20]. The set of fuzzy-qualitative labels is structured as a lattice,
which enables us to introduce fuzzy-qualitative descriptions as L-fuzzy sets
[3, 15]. Moreover, fuzzy-qualitative descriptions are an extension of type-
2 fuzzy sets, replacing in the secondary domain the unit interval with the
set S [9, 13]. Fuzzy-qualitative descriptions can also be considered as fuzzy
random variables interpreted under the ontic model [2, 4]. We formally intro-
duce the concept of entropy of a fuzzy-qualitative description Q of a set Λ as
the entropy associated with the probability measure induced by Q based on
a measure on the power set P(Λ). The concept of entropy is then formalized
by means of a Lebesgue integral and a measure of specificity [30]. In the
discrete case, where Q has a finite range, this integral becomes a weighted
average of the information of the labels, which corresponds to the Shannon
self-information entropy of a discrete random variable. This concept allows
the measurement of the amount of information given by a fuzzy-qualitative
description and a comparison of expert assessments in group decision making
[22]. In addition, a theorem is given that characterizes the finite fuzzy par-

titions of a well-ordered set using fuzzy-qualitative labels, leading to a full
mathematical justification for the commonly used fuzzy partitions of real
intervals via trapezoidal fuzzy numbers [16, 17].

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the
concept and structure of the set L of fuzzy-qualitative labels are introduced.
Section 3 provides a characterization of the fuzzy partitions of a well-ordered
set under certain conditions. The fuzzy-qualitative descriptions of a set Λ
and the concepts of information and entropy are defined in Section 4. Finally,
our conclusions and future research directions are presented in Section 5.

2. Fuzzy-qualitative labels over a well-ordered set S
In this section, the concept of fuzzy-qualitative labels over a well-ordered

set S is presented. This enables us to introduce fuzzy sets into order-of-
magnitude qualitative reasoning [25]. Firstly, we provide a brief summary of
some necessary concepts related to crisp qualitative labels introduced in [20].

2.1. Qualitative labels over a well-ordered set [20]

Given a well-ordered set (S,≤), its singletons {a}, a ∈ S, are considered
to be basic qualitative labels (or basic labels) over S. The qualitative labels (or
labels) over S are the intervals [a, b) = {x ∈ S | a ≤ x < b}, for all a, b ∈ S
with a < b, together with the intervals [a,→) = {x ∈ S | a ≤ x}, for all
a ∈ S. In particular, the entire set S = [p,→), where p is the least element
of S, is a label, and the basic labels are labels: {a} = [a, s(a)), where s(a)
is the successor of a, except in the case in which a is the last element of S,
if it exists, and then {a} = [a,→). In general, the label S is denoted by the
symbol ?, which is referred to as the unknown label.

The set L∗ of all the qualitative labels over S is named the order-of-
magnitude space over S:

L
∗ = {[a, b) | a, b ∈ S, a < b} ∪ {[a,→) | a ∈ S}.

Note that L∗ ⊆ P(S), where P(S) is the power set of S.
The set L = L∗ ∪ {∅} is named the extended set L ⊆ P(S) of qualitative

labels over S, and (L,�,∩) is a lattice, with the mix operation � and the set
intersection ∩.

2.2. Fuzzy-qualitative labels

This subsection presents a formal generalization of the order-of-magnitude
space L∗ over a well-ordered set S to a fuzzy framework. Fuzzy qualitative
labels are defined as fuzzy sets with core qualitative labels, as follows.

Definition 1. A fuzzy-qualitative label over S is a fuzzy set A ∈ F(S) =
[0, 1]S such that Core(A) ∈ L∗.

In this manner, Core(A) = [a, b) or Core(A) = [a,→), for some a, b ∈
S, a < b. In other words, the fuzzy-qualitative labels are the fuzzy sets on
S for which the set of elements that belong to them with membership value
equal to 1 is a qualitative label of L∗.

Let us recall the definition of a fuzzy singleton as a fuzzy set whose
membership function assigns membership equal to 1 to only one element,
and membership 0 to the rest of the elements of the universe. In this way,
fuzzy singletons are fuzzy-qualitative labels, but it would make no sense to
call them basic fuzzy-qualitative labels because their unions do not generate
the entire set of fuzzy-qualitative labels.

Definition 2. The set L∗ ⊆ F(S) of all the fuzzy-qualitative labels over S
is called the fuzzy order-of-magnitude space over S:

L∗ = {A ∈ F(S) | Core(A) ∈ L∗}.

Proposition 1 L∗ ⊆ L∗.

Proof. The proof is straightforward.

The next definition extends L∗ to include the fuzzy empty set ∅. This
will enable the definition of a lattice L from the set L∗, which will be used
in Section 4 to introduce the L-fuzzy sets.

Definition 3. The extended set L ⊆ F(S) of fuzzy-qualitative labels over S
is:

L = L∗ ∪ {∅}.

Hence, the fuzzy-qualitative labels of L are the elements of L∗ = L − {∅}.
In addition, from Proposition 1, it holds that L ⊆ L.

Table 1: Fuzzy sets associated with the candidate’s assessments

S = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} with a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 < a5
A1 /∈ L∗ A2 ∈ L∗

A1 = {1/a1, 0.5/a2, 1/a4} A2 = {0.2/a2, 1/a3, 1/a4, 0.3/a5}

Example A 1. Let us consider a candidate who applies for a job position
in a company, where the fuzzy sets A1, A2 ∈ F(S) given in Table 1 are two
different assessments of the candidate’s curriculum vitae.

OnlyA2 is a fuzzy-qualitative label because the cores ofA1, A2 are {a1, a4} /∈
L
∗, {a3, a4} = [a3, a5) ∈ L∗, respectively. If the singletons {ai} ∈ L∗ (or the

fuzzy singletons {1/ai} ∈ L∗), i = 1, . . . , 5 represent the terms very slightly
convincing, slightly convincing, average, quite convincing, very convincing,
respectively, then the fuzzy-qualitative label A2 could represent the term
moderately convincing.

Example B 1. Let S = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}, with ai < aj if i < j, where ai
are real intervals of the temperature in a room as degrees Celsius (see Table
2).

Table 2: Discretization associated with S

a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6
Temperature [0, 7) [7, 14) [14, 21) [21, 28) [28, 35) [35, 42]

An example with two fuzzy-qualitative labels A1, A2 is given in Table 3,
where two possible linguistic terms are associated.

Table 3: Fuzzy-qualitative labels

A1 = {1/a1, 0.6/a2, 0.1/a3} cold
A2 = {0.8/a2, 1/a3, 0.3/a4} warm

The examples provided above show that the elements of the set S can
have a representation in the real line or not. In Example A 1, the elements ai

6



of the set S have no mathematical semantics. On the contrary, in Example
B 1, the elements ai are intervals of the real line.

Remark 1. It is frequent the finite case where S = {a1, . . . , an}, with ai <
aj if i < j, and each ai is an interval of the real line R:

S = {a1 = [b1, b2), a2 = [b2, b3), . . . , an−1 = [bn−1, bn), an = [bn, bn+1]},

where b1 < b2 < · · · < bn < bn+1 gives a partition of the real interval
[b1, bn+1] ⊂ R.

Since R is not a well-ordered set, whenever we require that the reference
set is R or an interval of R, a discretization in n subintervals will be necessary
to apply the formal methodology presented in this study. The elements of
S are then the subintervals of the discretization. In practice, when working
with fuzzy sets over a real interval, usually a discretization of the interval is
implicitly considered. The granularity n associated with the discretization is
determined by the precision required in each real problem.

2.3. Structure of L and L∗
In this subsection we introduce two operations on the extended set L of

fuzzy-qualitative labels: the mix, �, and the common, �, in order to obtain
a lattice structure in L. This lattice structure enables us to introduce fuzzy-
qualitative descriptions as L-fuzzy sets in Section 4.

Although the standard union ∪ is not an operation in L, because the
standard union of two fuzzy-qualitative labels is a fuzzy-qualitative label if
and only if its core belongs to L∗, the axioms of the definition of the union in
F(S) are used to introduce the definition of the mix operation � (the same
symbol as that used in [20]).

Definition 4. Given A1, A2 ∈ L, the mix A1 � A2 of A1 and A2 is defined
as:

1. A1 � A2 ∈ L;
2. A1 ⊆ A1 �A2, A2 ⊆ A1 � A2;
3. A1 ⊆ A′, A2 ⊆ A′, A′ ∈ L ⇒ A1 � A2 ⊆ A′.

In this manner, A1 � A2 is the least element of L (based on the inclusion
relation ⊆ in the set F(S)) that contains A1 and A2.

7



The uniqueness of A1 � A2 is deduced immediately from the axioms.
Regarding the existence of the element A1 � A2, ∅ � A = A ∀A ∈ L, and if
A1, A2 ∈ L∗, the following fuzzy set, defined for any a ∈ S:

(A1 � A2)(a) =
{
1 if a ∈ Core(A1) � Core(A2);
max{A1(a), A2(a)} = (A1 ∪ A2)(a) otherwise,

satisfies the three conditions of Definition 4.
In addition, from Definition 4, it is clear that Core(A1�A2) = Core(A1)�

Core(A2) and the operation � in L, when restricted to the classical qualita-
tive labels of L, coincides with the mix � in L. Indeed, if A1, A2 ∈ L, it is
sufficient to note that:

(A1 �A2)(a) =
{
1 if a ∈ Core(A1) � Core(A2) = Core(A1 �A2),
0 otherwise.

Remark 2. In general, for all A1, A2 ∈ L, it holds that A1 ∪A2 ⊆ A1 �A2.
A sufficient condition for the equality is Core(A1)∩Core(A2) �= ∅ because, in
this case, we have Core(A1)�Core(A2) = Core(A1)∪Core(A2) = Core(A1∪
A2). However, this is not a necessary condition because, for example, in L
we have [a, b) ∪ [b, c) = [a, c) = [a, b) � [b, c) but [a, b) ∩ [b, c) = ∅. It can be
easily seen that a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality is that
either Core(A1)∩Core(A2) �= ∅ or these cores are of the form [a, b), [b, c) or
[a, b), [b,→).

The standard intersection ∩ is not an operation in L. A counterexample is
obtained by considering a1, a2 ∈ S and the elements {1/a1, 0.5/a2}, {1/a2} ∈
L since {1/a1, 0.5/a2} ∩ {1/a2} = {0.5/a2} and {0.5/a2} /∈ L, because
Core({0.5/a2}) = ∅ /∈ L∗. Similarly, as mentioned above, the axioms of
the definition of the intersection in F(S) are used to introduce the definition
of the common operation.

Definition 5. Given A1, A2 ∈ L, the common A1 � A2 of A1 and A2 is
defined as:

1. A1 � A2 ∈ L;
2. A1 � A2 ⊆ A1, A1 �A2 ⊆ A2;
3. A′ ⊆ A1, A′ ⊆ A2, A′ ∈ L ⇒ A′ ⊆ A1 �A2.

8



In this manner, A1�A2 is the greatest element of L (based on the inclusion
relation ⊆ in the set F(S)) that is contained in both A1 and A2.

The uniqueness of A1 � A2 is deduced immediately from the axioms.
Regarding the existence of A1 � A2, if A1, A2 ∈ L, the following fuzzy set:

A1 � A2 =
{
A1 ∩A2 if Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2) �= ∅,
∅ otherwise,

satisfies the three conditions of Definition 5. Indeed, for the case Core(A1)∩
Core(A2) �= ∅, it holds that Core(A1 ∩ A2) = Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2) ∈ L∗,
thus A1�A2 = A1∩A2 ∈ L and the intersection satisfies 1, 2, 3. For the case
Core(A1)∩Core(A2) = ∅, any A′ ∈ L contained in both A1, A2 will have an
empty core, so A′ = ∅.

In addition, given that Core(A1 ∩ A2) = Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2), from
Definition 5 we deduce that Core(A1 �A2) = Core(A1)∩Core(A2). On the
other hand, the operation � in L, when restricted to L, coincides with the
common ∩ in L. Indeed, let A1, A2 ∈ L, if Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2) �= ∅, then
A1 � A2 = A1 ∩ A2, and if Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2) = ∅, then A1 � A2 = ∅ =
Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2) = A1 ∩A2.
Remark 3. In general, for all A1, A2 ∈ L, it holds that A1 �A2 ⊆ A1 ∩A2.
It can be easily seen that a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality
is that either Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2) �= ∅ or Support(A1) ∩ Support(A2) = ∅.
Example A 2. Following Example A 1, and given the fuzzy assessments
in Table 4, the mix and the common of both assessments are A2 � A3 =
{0.5/a2, 1/a3, 1/a4, 0.3/a5} ∈ L∗, and A2 �A3 = {0.2/a2, 1/a3, 0.3/a4} ∈ L∗.

Table 4: Fuzzy sets associated with the candidate assessments

S = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}
A2 = {0.2/a2, 1/a3, 1/a4, 0.3/a5} A3 = {0.5/a2, 1/a3, 0.3/a4}

The following theorem establishes the algebraic structure of the extended
set L with the mix and common operations.
Theorem 1 (L,�,�) is a lattice.

9



Proof. The two operations � and � are idempotent, commutative, and
satisfy the absorption law. They are associative due to their definitions:
fuzzy sets A1 � (A2 � A3) and (A1 � A2) � A3 are both the least element of
L that contains A1, A2, A3; A1 � (A2 � A3) and (A1 � A2) � A3 are both the
greatest element of L contained in A1, A2, A3.

The lattice (L,�,�) is generally not distributive because it is not in L
[20].

The partial order � induced in the lattice L by the two operations �, �
is the inverse subset inclusion ⊇ in F(S). In effect:

A1 � A2 ⇔ A1 �A2 = A1 ⇔ A1 � A2 = A2 ⇔ A1 ⊇ A2,
the last equivalence due to the definition of A1 � A2. Note that A1 � A2 �
A1, A2 � A1 � A2 for any A1, A2 ∈ L.
The least element in the poset (L,�) is the set 0L = S because, for all A ∈ L,
A(a) ≤ 1 = S(a) for all a ∈ S. In the following, this is denoted by the
symbol ? (as in L), which is referred to as the “unknown” fuzzy-qualitative
label. The greatest element is 1L = ∅ because ∅ ⊆ A for all A ∈ L, and it is
not a fuzzy-qualitative label, ∅ /∈ L∗.

The set L∗ = L − {∅} = L − {1L}, with the operation � and the partial
order �, is a meet-semilattice, i.e., a poset where the infimum exists for
every pair of elements. In this semilattice, the fuzzy singletons {1/a}, with
a ∈ S, are maximal elements because [A ∈ L∗, {1/a} � A] ⇒ A = {1/a},
and they are the only ones (that can be easily seen). The smallest element
is 0L∗ = 0L =?, and if the set S has at least two elements, then it is obvious
that there is no greatest element.

3. Fuzzy partitions of S using fuzzy-qualitative labels
Let us suppose that the diverse states of a variable are associated with

linguistic terms, which are themselves associated with crisp qualitative labels
E1, . . . , Ek ∈ L∗, that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, i.e.,
such that {E1, . . . , Ek} is a crisp partition of S. Thus, Ei ∩ Ej = ∅ if i �= j,
i.e., two linguistic terms cannot be associated with the same state of the
variable, and the “unknown” label ? is S = E1∪· · ·∪Ek, i.e., label ? represents
a linguistic term that can be associated with all the states of the variable.
The generalization of crisp partitions in the case of fuzzy-qualitative labels
corresponds to fuzzy partitions of the set S, as in Ruspini’s approach.

10



This section provides a characterization of fuzzy partitions {A1, . . . , Ak}
of the set S, being A1, . . . , Ak ∈ L∗, such that their supports are qualitative
labels that belong to L∗. This restriction Support(Ai) ∈ L∗ for all i =
1, . . . , k, (the supports of the fuzzy-qualitative labels Ai have to be intervals
[a, b), or [a →) of S,) is imposed to reflect the conditions of mutual exclusivity
and collective exhaustivity.

The next definitions establish the framework where these fuzzy partitions
of S are characterized.
Definition 6. L∗s = {A ∈ L∗ | Support(A) ∈ L∗} = {A ∈ F(S) | Core(A) ∈
L
∗ and Support(A) ∈ L∗}.
To obtain a new lattice structure, as done in Subsection 2.3, the following

extension is considered:

Definition 7. Ls = L∗s ∪ {∅}.
Proposition 2 (Ls,�,�) is a sublattice of (L,�,�).
Proof. Let A1, A2 ∈ Ls. If A1 or A2 are ∅, then A1 � A2, A1 � A2 ∈ Ls.
Suppose, then, that A1, A2 ∈ L∗s.

1. Let us prove that Support(A1 � A2) = Support(A1) � Support(A2),
which implies that A1 � A2 ∈ Ls because � is an operation in L.
Indeed, by definition 4, it holds directly that:
Support(A1 � A2) = (Core(A1) � Core(A2)) ∪ Support(A1 ∪ A2) =
(Core(A1) � Core(A2)) ∪ (Support(A1) ∪ Support(A2)).
On the other hand,
Support(A1)�Support(A2) = (Core(A1)�Core(A2))∪Support(A1)∪
Support(A2), because Support(A1) and Support(A2) are intervals of
L
∗ that contain Core(A1) and Core(A2), respectively.

2. It remains to be seen that A1 �A2 ∈ Ls.
Indeed, if Core(A1) ∩ Core(A2) = ∅, then A1 �A2 = ∅ ∈ Ls.
If Core(A1)∩Core(A2) �= ∅, then it holds directly by definition 5 that:
Support(A1 � A2) = Support(A1 ∩ A2) = Support(A1) ∩ Support(A2),
and therefore A1 � A2 ∈ Ls because ∩ is an operation in L.

The following lemma characterizes the crisp partitions of the set S using
qualitative labels that belong to L∗.

11



Lemma 1 Given E1, . . . , Ek ∈ L∗, k ≥ 2, {E1, . . . , Ek} is a partition of the
set S = [p,→) if and only if they can be sorted in a manner such that:
E1 = [p, a2), E2 = [a2, a3), . . . , Ek−1 = [ak−1, ak), Ek = [ak,→), for some
a2, a3, . . . , ak ∈ S with p < a2 < a3 < · · · < ak (see Figure 1).

Proof. The proof is straightforward.

Figure 1: Crisp partition of S using the labels of L.

The next theorem generalizes Lemma 1 and gives two characterizations
of the fuzzy partitions of the set S, in the sense of Ruspini’s approach, by
using the fuzzy-qualitative labels of L∗s.

Theorem 2 Let us consider a finite set of fuzzy-qualitative labels A1, . . . , Ak ∈
L∗s, k ≥ 2. The following three conditions are equivalent:

(a) {A1, . . . , Ak} is a fuzzy partition of the set S = [p,→), i.e.,
∑k

i=1Ai(a) =
1 ∀a ∈ S.

(b) The following conditions are satisfied:

1. Core(A1), Core(A2), . . . , Core(Ak) are pairwise disjoint.

2. These cores can be sorted in such a manner that (see Figure 2):

(i) For all i = 1, . . . , k−1, Ai(a)+Ai+1(a) = 1 ∀a ∈
(
Core(Ai)�

Core(Ai+1)
)
−
(
Core(Ai) ∪ Core(Ai+1)

)
,

(ii) Core(A1) = [p, b1), Core(Ak) = [ak,→), for some b1, ak ∈ S,
with p < b1 ≤ ak.

(c) Labels A1, . . . , Ak can be sorted so that the standard fuzzy complement
of each is the standard union of the mix of the previous labels and the
mix of the subsequent labels:
Aci = (A1 � . . . �Ai−1) ∪ (Ai+1 � . . . � Ak) ∀i = 2, . . . , k − 1,

and Ac1 = A2 � . . . �Ak, Ack = A1 � . . . � Ak−1.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b)
Let A1, . . . , Ak ∈ L∗s such that {A1, . . . , Ak} is a fuzzy partition of the set S.

a ∈ Core(Ai) ⇒ Ai(a) = 1 ⇒ Aj(a) = 0 ∀j �= i ⇒ a /∈ Support(Aj)

cause Core(Aj) ⊆ Support(Aj) ∀j.

2. Thus, according to Lemma 1, the cores can be sorted in such a manner
that:
Core(A1) = [a1, b1), Core(A2) = [a2, b2), . . . , Core(Ak−1) = [ak−1, bk−1),
Core(Ak) = [ak, bk) (or [ak,→)), for some a1, . . . , ak ∈ S, b1, . . . , bk ∈ S
(or b1, . . . , bk−1 ∈ S in the second case), with p ≤ a1 < b1 ≤ a2 < b2 ≤
a3 < b3 ≤ · · · ≤ ak−1 < bk−1 ≤ ak < bk (or p ≤ a1 < b1 ≤ · · · < bk−1 ≤
ak in the second case).

(i) Let i ∈ {1, . . . , k−1}. Since Core(A1), . . . , Core(Ak) are pairwise
disjoint and the fact that Support(Aj) ∈ L∗ ∀j (and therefore con-
nected), in the interval [bi, ai+1) (if it is non-empty) only the fuzzy
sets Ai, Ai+1 can have positive degrees of membership. Hence, the
hypothesis

∑k
j=1Aj(a) = 1 ∀a ∈ S implies Ai(a) + Ai+1(a) =

1 ∀a ∈ [bi, ai+1). This interval can be written as [bi, ai+1) =(
Core(Ai) � Core(Ai+1)

)
−
(
Core(Ai) ∪ Core(Ai+1)

)
.

In addition, note that for the case Core(Ai) � Core(Ai+1) =
Core(Ai) ∪ Core(Ai+1), i.e., [bi, ai+1) = ∅, the statement (i) is
evidently true.

(ii) First: 1 =
∑k

i=1Ai(a) = A1(a) ∀a ∈ [p, a1), because the sup-
ports of A2, . . . , Ak are in L

∗; so p = a1 and Core(A1) = [p, b1).
Analogously, 1 =

∑k
i=1Ai(a) = Ak(a) ∀a ∈ [ak,→), because the

supports of A1, . . . , Ak−1 are in L∗; so Core(Ak) = [ak,→).

13



Note that conditions 1, 2 lead to 0 < Ai(a) < 1 and 0 < Ai+1(a) < 1,
for any i = 1, . . . , k − 1 and for any a ∈ [bi, ai+1) �= ∅. Thus, we can state
that: Support(A1) = [p, a2), Support(A2) = [b1, a3), . . . , Support(Ak−1) =
[bk−2, ak) and Support(Ak) = [bk−1,→) (see Figure 2).
(b) ⇒ (c)
It is simple to check that, in each of the intervals: [p, b1), [b1, a2), [a2, b2),
[b2, a3),. . . , [ak−1, bk−1),[bk−1, ak), [ak,→), the fuzzy sets A1, . . . , Ak satisfy
the conditions of (c) (see Figure 2). For instance, in the case a ∈ [bi−1, ai),
i = 2, . . . , k, it holds that:(

(A1 � . . . �Ai−1) ∪ (Ai+1 � . . . � Ak)
)
(a) =

max{(A1 � . . . � Ai−1)(a), (Ai+1 � . . . �Ak)(a)} =
max{Ai−1(a), 0} = Ai−1(a) = 1− Ai(c) = Aci(a).

(c) ⇒ (a)
We will prove (c) ⇒ (a) through some part of (b), because it is difficult to
go directly from (c) to (a) without using the explicit description of the fuzzy
sets in (b).
First, the assumptions of (c) lead to Core(Ai) ∩ Support(Aj) = ∅ if i �= j.
Indeed, on the one hand, if i = 2, . . . , k − 1, it holds that:
Ai(a) = 1 ⇒

{
(A1 � . . . � Ai−1)(a) = 0 and (Ai+1 � . . . � Ak)(a) = 0

}
⇒ Aj(a) = 0 ∀j �= i given that the mix contains its members.
So, Core(Ai) ∩ Support(Aj) = ∅ if j �= i. Analogously, with respect to
A1 and Ak: Core(A1) ∩ Support(Aj) = ∅ ∀j = 2, . . . , k and Core(Ak) ∩
Support(Aj) = ∅ ∀j = 1, . . . , k − 1. The same reasoning as that found in
items 1 and 2 of the proof (a) ⇒ (b) leads to: Core(A1) = [a1, b1), Core(A2) =
[a2, b2), . . . , Core(Ak−1) = [ak−1, bk−1), Core(Ak) = [ak, bk) (or [ak,→)).
On the other hand, Ac1 = A2� . . .�Ak and the fact that Support(Aj) ∈ L∗ ∀j
readily imply that Core(A1) = [p, b1), and the same applies to Core(Ak) =
[ak,→) from Ack = A1 � . . . � Ak−1. In addition, given that Support(Aj) ∈
L
∗ ∀j, in the interval [bi, ai+1) (if it is non-empty), for i = 1, . . . , k − 1, only

the fuzzy sets Ai, Ai+1 can have positive degrees of membership.
Now, it only remains to check that

∑k
i=1Ai(a) = 1 ∀a ∈ S in each of

the intervals [p, b1), [b1, a2), [a2, b2), [b2, a3), . . . , [ak−1, bk−1), [bk−1, ak), [ak,→),
which follows in a straightforward manner from the assumptions of (c).
This concludes the proof of the theorem.

14



Remark 4. Note that condition Support(Aj) ∈ L∗ ∀j is necessary for The-
orem 2 to be true. A counterexample where Support(Aj) /∈ L∗ for some j
and a fuzzy partition of S does not satisfy condition (c) of Theorem 2 is
as follows: S = {a1, a2, a3, a4}, A1 = {1/a1, 13/a4}, A2 = {1/a2, 13/a4}, A3 =
{1/a3, 13/a4}.

The following corollary provides a third characterization of the fuzzy par-
titions of S using fuzzy-qualitative labels A1, . . . , Ak ∈ L∗s:

Corollary 1 The following statement is also equivalent to conditions (a), (b),
(c) in Theorem 2:

Labels A1, . . . , Ak can be sorted so that:
(Ai�Aj)c = (A0�. . .�Ai−1)∪(Aj+1�. . .�Ak+1) = (A0�Ai−1)∪(Aj+1�Ak+1),
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k, assuming that A0 = Ak+1 = ∅.

Proof. The proof is straightforward (see Figure 2).

Remark 5. Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 provide three characterizations of
fuzzy partitions, in the sense of Ruspini’s approach, by means of fuzzy qual-
itative labels in L∗s.

When supposing a suitable discretization of an interval of R as explained
in Remark 1, the fuzzy-qualitative labels in L∗s can be considered trapezoidal
fuzzy sets over the given interval. Regarding this perspective, Theorem 2 can
be reformulated in the case of fuzzy partitions of a real interval by means of
trapezoidal fuzzy sets placed as in Figure 2, which are the most commonly-
used partitions in the literature of fuzzy sets:

Theorem 3 Finite fuzzy partitions, in the sense of Ruspini, of a real interval
by means of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are characterized as in Theorem 2 and
Corollary 1.

Proof. If the set S = [p,→) is replaced by [p, b) ⊆ R o [p,+∞) ⊆ R, and
all the intervals [ai, bj) are considered as real intervals, it is straightforward
to check that all steps of the proof are valid.

Since L∗ ⊂ L∗s, Theorem 2 is applicable to crisp qualitative labels, but
there are some differences between the crisp and fuzzy cases, which are pre-
sented in Table 5.
Indeed, it is clear that fuzzy partitions satisfy Ai � Aj = ∅ if i �= j and
S = A1� . . .�Ak (see Figure 2), but these two conditions do not characterize
fuzzy partitions because the converse is not true. A counterexample is given
by: k = 2, S = {a1, a2, a3}, A1 = {1/a1, 0.5/a2}, A2 = {1/a3}. It holds that
A1�A2 = ∅ and S = A1�A2, but {A1, A2} is not a fuzzy partition of S since
A1(a2) + A2(a2) = 0.5 �= 1. Note that condition (c) of Theorem 2 cannot
be replaced by Aci =

⋃
j �=iAj ∀i = 1, . . . , k, which is highlighted in the next

example.

Example A 3. Following Examples A 1 and A 2, let us consider now that
the linguistic terms {very slightly convincing, slightly convincing, average,
quite convincing, very convincing} represent at the same time a crisp par-
tition {E1, . . . , Ek} and a fuzzy partition {A1, . . . , Ak} of a well-ordered set
S. Table 6 shows the differences in the complement of a label between both
cases. In the case of fuzzy partitions, the complement of a fuzzy-qualitative
label cannot be expressed using only the fuzzy union ∪, and requires the
operation �.

Finally, note that, although in the previous example a fuzzy partition
of S was associated with a set of linguistic terms, a set of linguistic terms
does not always correspond to a fuzzy partition of a well-ordered set S.
For example, the terms very slightly convincing, convincing, very convincing
could correspond to the fuzzy-qualitative labels A1, A4�A5, A5, respectively,
and they fulfill neither the condition of being mutually exclusive nor the
condition of being collectively exhaustive.

4. Fuzzy-qualitative descriptions and entropy

Let us consider a decision-making problem where experts use a set of
order-of-magnitude linguistic terms S = {E1, . . . , Ek} to describe a fea-
ture. Experts are supposed to give their assessments by using qualitative
labels of type [Ei, Ei+h] = {Ei, . . . , Ei+h}, i.e., expert assessments may cor-
respond to some consecutive linguistic terms. However, it is not unreal-
istic that experts may wish (or may be required to) tune a little more
by using degrees of membership in [0, 1] for each linguistic term. That
is to say, expert assessments can move from labels of type [Ei, Ei+h] =
{0/E1, . . . , 0/Ei−1, 1/Ei, . . . , 1/Ei+h, 0/Ei+h+1, . . . , 0/Ek} to labels of type
{d1/E1, . . . , di−1/Ei−1, 1/Ei, . . . , 1/Ei+h, di+h+1/Ei+h+1, . . . , dk/Ek}, with
dj ∈ [0, 1), which corresponds to a fuzzy-qualitative label, i.e., a fuzzy set
over S with core [Ei, Ei+h], as defined in Section 2. The following subsections
provide the mathematical structure for this type of assessment process.

4.1. Fuzzy-qualitative descriptions of a set

The L-fuzzy sets on Λ assign a fuzzy-qualitative label from the extended
set L to each element of a set Λ, whose elements are to be assessed:

Definition 8. The set Q of L-fuzzy sets on Λ is:

Q = LΛ = {Q | Q : Λ → L}.

17



The set Λ can be interpreted as a set of magnitudes, features, or ob-
jects. For example, Λ = {T (t) | t ∈ [t0, t1]} where T (t) is the room temper-
ature at a given instant t in the period of time [t0, t1]. Another example is
Λ = {λ1, . . . , λm}, where λ1, . . . , λm are the merits to be considered by an
evaluator in a recruitment process or the projects that need to be rated based
on their quality.

The label Q(λ) describes fuzzy-qualitatively the element λ ∈ Λ, for some
λ ∈ Λ, when Q(λ) is a fuzzy-qualitative label of L i.e., Q(λ) ∈ L∗ = L−{∅}.
Every Q ∈ LΛ such that Q(λ) is a fuzzy-qualitative label for all λ ∈ Λ may
be interpreted as an expert who assigns a fuzzy-qualitative label in L∗ to
each element of Λ.

Definition 9. A fuzzy-qualitative description of the set Λ by L is an L-fuzzy
set on Λ such that for all λ ∈ Λ, Q(λ) ∈ L∗.
Definition 10. The set of fuzzy-qualitative descriptions of Λ by L is:

Q∗ = {Q ∈ Q | Q(Λ) ⊆ L∗}.
Remark 6. Let us highlight two interpretations of fuzzy-qualitative descrip-
tions of a set Λ.

On the one hand, from Definition 9, fuzzy-qualitative descriptions are ele-

ments of
(
[0, 1]S

)Λ
. A type-2 fuzzy set over Λ is an element in

(
[0, 1][0,1]

)Λ
[9,

13]. Therefore, fuzzy-qualitative descriptions can be considered a general-
ized type of type-2 fuzzy sets, i.e., fuzzy sets whose membership grades are
themselves fuzzy sets over S.

Moreover, Q = LΛ ⊆ ([0, 1]S)Λ = [0, 1]Λ×S . Thus, any L-fuzzy set on Λ
is actually an ordinary fuzzy set on Λ×S. In this sense, a fuzzy-qualitative
description of the set Λ by L is a fuzzy set Q on Λ × S such that for all
λ ∈ Λ, there exists an interval [a, b) or [a,→) in S such that Q(λ, x) = 1, for
all x that belong to this interval.

4.2. Structure of Q and Q∗

The set Q of L-fuzzy sets on Λ inherits the operations � and � from the
lattice L (the same symbols are used), where the operations are extended in
a pointwise manner.

Definition 11. The mix operation Q�Q′ and the common operation Q�Q′
are defined as follows for all λ ∈ Λ:

(Q �Q′)(λ) = Q(λ) �Q′(λ) and (Q �Q′)(λ) = Q(λ) �Q′(λ).

18



As described in [20], for the case of Q,Q′ ∈ Q∗, the operation � mixes
the two fuzzy-qualitative descriptions in a new fuzzy-qualitative description,
including both opinions regarding each element of Λ. In this manner, Q�Q′
assigns to each element of Λ the fuzzy set whose core corresponds to the
connected union of both cores and the maximum of the membership function
values is considered outside. The operation � takes that which is common
between the two fuzzy-qualitative descriptions in the case where the cores
are not disjoint. In this manner, when the cores of Q(λ) and Q′(λ) are not
disjoint, Q�Q′ assigns to λ the fuzzy set for which the membership function
is the minimum of both membership functions.

The algebraic structure of L is transferred to the set of L-fuzzy sets on a
specified set. Thus, based on Theorem 1, we obtain the following:

Theorem 4 (Q,�,�) is a lattice.

Proof. Idempotence, commutativity, associativity, and absorption all hold
for Q because of the pointwise extension from L.

In general, the lattice (Q,�,�) is not distributive because (L,�,�) is not
distributive.

The partial order � (the same symbol as that used for L) induced by the
two operations � and � in Q is the pointwise extension of the order � in L:
Q � Q′ ⇔ Q � Q′ = Q ⇔ Q � Q′ = Q′ ⇔ Q(λ) � Q′(λ) = Q′(λ) ∀λ ∈ Λ ⇔
Q′(λ) ⊆ Q(λ) ∀λ ∈ Λ ⇔ Q(λ) � Q′(λ) ∀λ ∈ Λ.

Moreover, it holds that Q�Q′ � Q,Q′ � Q�Q′ for any fuzzy-qualitative
descriptions Q,Q′ in Q. In addition, the least element 0Q of the poset (Q,�)
is the fuzzy-qualitative description that maps every λ ∈ Λ to 0L =? ∈ L,
and the greatest element 1Q is the L-fuzzy set that maps every λ ∈ Λ to the
greatest element 1L = ∅ ∈ L.

Given any Q,Q′ ∈ Q∗, it holds that Q � Q′ ∈ Q∗: for any λ ∈ Λ,
Q(λ), Q′(λ) ∈ L∗ ⇒ Q(λ) � Q′(λ) ∈ L∗. Hence, Q∗ is a meet-semilattice
with the operation � and partial order �. In this semilattice, the least
element is clearly 0Q∗ = 0Q.

Proposition 3 If the set S has at least two elements, then there is no great-
est element in (Q∗,�).

19



Proof. Suppose that Q′ ∈ Q∗ is the greatest element of Q∗. We have:
Q � Q′ ∀Q ∈ Q∗ ⇒ Q(λ) � Q′(λ) ∀Q ∈ Q∗ ∀λ ∈ Λ ⇒ Q′(λ) ⊆ Q(λ) ∀Q ∈
Q∗ ∀λ ∈ Λ. In particular, this implies that Q′(λ), for every λ ∈ Λ, is con-
tained in all the fuzzy singletons {1/a}, a ∈ S. Since S has at least two
elements, we deduce immediately that Q′(λ)(a) = 0 ∀a ∈ S. This leads to
Q′(λ) = ∅ ∀λ ∈ Λ, which is absurd since Q′ ∈ Q∗.

We present two examples of fuzzy-qualitative descriptions of a set Λ, one
where Λ is finite and the other where Λ is infinite.

Example A 4. Following Examples A 1, A 2 and A 3, let us consider a
candidate who applies for a job in a company. Let us suppose that the
hiring committee is composed of two experts. The experts evaluate the
following features: λ1 = curriculum vitae, λ2 = an interview, and λ3 =
the salary requested by the applicant, which are the elements of the set
Λ = {λ1, λ2, λ3}. Let S = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}, and consider the linguistic
terms associated with the singletons {1/a1}, {1/a2}, {1/a3}, {1/a4}, {1/a5},
respectively: very slightly convincing, slightly convincing, average, quite con-
vincing, very convincing.
The experts use the following labels:

A1 = {1/a1, 0.7/a2, 0.3/a3}, B1 = {1/a1, 0.5/a2}
A2 = {0.5/a1, 1/a2, 1/a3}, B2 = {0.3/a1, 1/a2, 0.6/a3}
A3 = {0.1/a2, 0, 7/a3, 1/a4}, B3 = {0, 7/a3, 1/a4, 0, 7/a5}
A4 = {0.5/a3, 1/a4, 1/a5}, B4 = {0.3/a3, 0.7/a4, 1/a5}

Table 7 summarizes the evaluation process, as well as the mix and the com-
mon of the two fuzzy-qualitative descriptions.

Table 7: Fuzzy-qualitative descriptions that correspond to the expert assessments

Q1 �Q2 A4 � B1 A3 � B3 A2 � B2
∅ {0.7/a3, 1/a4} {0.3/a1, 1/a2, 0.6/a3}

20



Example B 2. Following Example B 1, now let us suppose that during a
60-minute period an evaluator provides qualitative descriptions of the tem-
perature in a room to adjust a heat pump using fuzzy-qualitative labels of
L, with S = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}, where ai are the real intervals of the tem-
perature (degrees Celsius) in Table 2.

Let us consider the fuzzy-qualitative labels A1, A2, A3 and the correspond-
ing linguistic terms in Table 8.

Table 8: Fuzzy-qualitative labels Example B 2

A1 = {1/a1, 0.6/a2, 0.1/a3} cold
A2 = {0.8/a2, 1/a3, 0.3/a4} warm
A3 = {0.1/a3, 0.5/a4, 1/a5, 1/a6} extremely hot

Let Λ = {T (t) | t ∈ [0, 60]} be the set of temperatures that need to be de-
scribed. An example of a L-fuzzy set on Λ is the fuzzy-qualitative description
Q : Λ → L of Λ given by the evaluator as:

Q(T (t)) =

⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
A1 = {1/a1, 0.6/a2, 0.1/a3}, if t ∈ [0, 15);
A1 � A2 = {1/a1, 1/a2, 1/a3, 0.3/a4}, if t ∈ [15, 30);
A2 = {0.8/a2, 1/a3, 0.3/a4}, if t ∈ [30, 45);
A2 � A3 = {0.8/a2, 1/a3, 1/a4 1/a5, 1/a6}, if t ∈ [45, 60].

4.3. Entropy of a fuzzy-qualitative description

In this subsection, we introduce the entropy of a fuzzy-qualitative de-
scription Q : Λ → L, with Q(Λ) ⊆ L∗, using a measure of specifity Sp :
[0, 1]S → [0, 1] on the set of fuzzy-qualitative labels L∗ and a normalized
additive measure μ : P(Λ) → [0, 1] on the power set P(Λ).

A fuzzy-qualitative description can be considered as a fuzzy random vari-
able, i.e., a mapping defined on a probability space whose values are fuzzy
sets under some measurability conditions, interpreted according to the ontic
model [2, 4]. We define the entropy of a fuzzy-qualitative description Q of a
set Λ as the entropy associated with the probability measure μ◦Q−1 induced
by Q based on the normalized additive measure μ on the power set P(Λ).
The proposed entropy is then formalized based on a Lebesgue integral and a
measure of specificity [30]. In the discrete case, where Q has a finite range,

21



this integral becomes a weighted average of the information of the fuzzy-
qualitative labels used by Q, corresponding to the Shannon self-information
entropy of a discrete random variable. The chosen definition of entropy based
on Shannon requires the ontic versus the epistemic interpretation of fuzzy sets
[2, 4].

4.3.1. Information of a fuzzy-qualitative label

The choice of an additive measure μ to quantify the amount of information
in a crisp qualitative label, I(E) = − logμ(E), led to a formula of the entropy
of a crisp qualitative description that was inspired by the Shannon entropy,
which uses a probability [20]. However, I(E) = − logm(E), with m as a
generic fuzzy measure (monotone measure) or a capacity (normal monotone
measure), that is not necessarily additive [8], could also have been considered.
These types of measures are more generic and useful in cases where, for
example, the measure of the union of two fuzzy sets does not have to be
exactly the sum of the two measures.

In the case of the fuzzy-qualitative labels A ∈ L, we cannot consider
the information I(A) = − logm(A) with m any fuzzy measure because
L ⊆ [0, 1]S does not satisfy the required properties of a measurable space.
Therefore, we must resort to measures on fuzzy sets. In particular, we con-
sider the measures of specificity introduced by Yager [29], which are measures
of the utility of the information contained in a fuzzy set.

In the following, let Sp be a measure of specificity, i.e., Sp : F(S) =
[0, 1]S → [0, 1] a function that satisfies the following three conditions: Sp(A) =
1 if and only if A is a singleton, Sp(∅) = 0, and if A,B are normal sets, with
A ⊆ B, then Sp(A) ≥ Sp(B).

Definition 12. Given a fuzzy-qualitative label A ∈ L∗ ⊆ F(S), the in-
formation of A given by the measure of specificity Sp on L ⊆ F(S) is
I(A) = Sp(A).

Thus, for each fuzzy-qualitative label A, we associate a number I(A) ∈
[0, 1] that is defined using a measure of specificity, which is considered to be
a measure of the amount of information contained in or provided by the label
A.

The next definition introduces the concept of being more precise than in
the set L.

22



Definition 13. Given A1 and A2 in L, we say that A1 is more precise or
equal than A2 if A1 ⊆ A2.

In this manner, A1 being more precise or equal than A2 implies that
Core(A1) ⊆ Core(A2), thus this concept generalizes the same concept in L.
Since fuzzy-qualitative labels are normal fuzzy sets, given any A1, A2 ∈ L∗,
if A1 ⊆ A2, then I(A1) ≥ I(A2), i.e., if the label A1 is more precise than the
label A2, then A1 provides more information than A2.

The fuzzy-qualitative label with the lowest value of the information I(A)
is the “unknown” label ? = S, because for any A ∈ L∗, A ⊆ S =? ⇒
Sp(A) ≥ Sp(?). The greatest value of the information I(A), which is equal
to 1, is provided by the fuzzy singletons {1/a}, with a ∈ S.
4.3.2. Entropy in the continuous case

Below the entropy H(Q) of a fuzzy-qualitative description Q is defined
and interpreted as a measure of the amount of information emitted by Q. The
advantage of defining the entropy of an L-fuzzy set as a Lebesgue integral is
to unify the discrete and continuous cases.

First, we formalize the concept of the entropy of a fuzzy-qualitative de-
scription Q : Λ → L of Λ in the continuous case. Let Sp : [0, 1]S → [0, 1] be
a measure of specificity, and let μ : P(Λ) → [0, 1] be a normalized additive
measure on the power set P(Λ), i.e., a measure on the measurable space
(Λ,P(Λ)) such that μ(Λ) = 1.

The composition function Λ
Q−→ L Sp |L−→ [0, 1] ↪→ [0,+∞] (we denote

this as Sp ◦ Q : Λ → [0,+∞]) is a measurable map with respect to the σ-
algebra P(Λ) and the Borel algebra B([0,+∞]) because the set (Sp◦Q)−1(B)
∀B ∈ B([0,+∞]) is a subset of Λ. This justifies the following:
Definition 14. Given the measure space (Λ,P(Λ), μ) with normalized mea-
sure μ, and the extended set of fuzzy-qualitative labels L over S provided
with a measure of specificity Sp, the entropy of an L-fuzzy set Q ∈ Q∗ is the
Lebesgue integral of the measurable map Sp ◦Q with respect to μ:

H(Q) =

∫
Λ

(Sp ◦Q) dμ. (1)

The function H : Q∗ → [0,+∞] is called the entropy function.
Theorem 5 The entropy function H is an isotone mapping between the
posets (Q∗,�) and ([0, 1],≤).

23



Proof. For any Q ∈ Q∗, we have H(Q) ≤ 1, because Sp(Q(λ)) ≤ 1 ∀λ ∈ Λ
and therefore H(Q) =

∫
Λ

(Sp ◦Q) dμ ≤
∫
Λ

1 dμ = μ(Λ) = 1.

Regarding monotonicity, for any Q,Q′ ∈ Q∗ it holds that:
Q � Q′ ⇒ Q(λ) � Q′(λ) ∀λ ∈ Λ ⇒ Q′(λ) ⊆ Q(λ) ∀λ ∈ Λ, and, since

Q′(λ), Q(λ) are normal fuzzy sets, this implies that Sp(Q(λ)) ≤ Sp(Q′(λ)) ∀λ ∈
Λ. The monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral leads to:

H(Q) =

∫
Λ

(Sp ◦Q) dμ ≤
∫
Λ

(Sp ◦Q′) dμ = H(Q′).

If Q and Q′ are fuzzy-qualitative descriptions of Λ and, for every λ ∈ Λ,
the label Q′(λ) is more precise than the label Q(λ), then, from Theorem 5,
the entropy of Q′ is greater than or equal to that of Q, and Q′ provides at
least as much information as Q.

The entropy of the the constant L-fuzzy sets is given by the following:
Proposition 4 If Q(λ) = A ∀λ ∈ Λ for some A ∈ L∗, then the entropy of
Q is then Sp(A).

Proof. The proof is straightforward.

Proposition 5 The least entropy, which is equal to Sp(?), is provided by the
least element 0Q of the poset (Q

∗,�), which corresponds to the case when all
the elements of Λ are described by the “unknown” label ? The greatest entropy,
which is equal to 1, occurs when all the labels that describe the elements of Λ
are singletons.

Proof. 0Q � Q ∀Q ∈ Q ⇒ H(0Q) ≤ H(Q) ∀Q ∈ Q, and by Proposition 4,
H(0Q) = Sp(?).
On the other hand, if Q(λ) is a singleton for all λ ∈ Λ, then (Sp ◦Q)(λ) = 1
for all λ ∈ Λ and therefore H(Q) =

∫
Λ

(Sp ◦Q) dμ =
∫
Λ

1 dμ = 1.

It is not surprising that the minimum entropy is H(0Q) = Sp(?) since the
least amount of information is provided by a qualitative description of a set
Λ when all the elements of Λ are described by the “unknown” label ?, which
is the least precise label. By contrast, the greatest amount of information is
obtained when all the elements of Λ are described by singletons, which are
the most precise labels.

4.3.3. Entropy in the discrete case

Consider the discrete case Q(Λ) = {A1, . . . , Ar} ⊆ L∗, where only a finite
number of labels A1, . . . , Ar are used to describe the elements of the set
Λ, and let {Λ1 = Q−1({A1}), . . . ,Λr = Q−1({Ar})} be the partition of Λ
induced by Q. In this case, the Lebesgue integral of Formula (1) becomes a
weighted average, which is proven by the following:

Theorem 6 The entropy of the L-fuzzy set Q with the finite range {A1, . . . , Ar}
is given by:

H(Q) =
r∑

i=1

Sp(Ai) · μ(Q−1({Ai})). (2)

Proof. The map Sp ◦Q can be expressed as follows:
Sp ◦Q =

r∑
i=1

Sp(Ai) · 1Λi,
where 1Λi : Λ → {0, 1} is the characteristic function of Λi. Using the linearity
of the Lebesgue integral, the entropy of Q in this case is given by:

H(Q) =

∫
Λ

(Sp◦Q) dμ =
∫
Λ

(
r∑

i=1

Sp(Ai) · 1Λi
)

dμ =

r∑
i=1

Sp(Ai)·
∫
Λ

1Λi dμ =

=
r∑

i=1

Sp(Ai) · μ(Λi) =
r∑

i=1

Sp(Ai) · μ(Q−1({Ai})).

The entropy of a qualitative description Q of a set Λ with a finite range
is expressed in Formula (2) as a weighted average of the information of the
labels used by Q in the description of Λ, where the weights are the measures
of the subsets of the elements of Λ that are described by the same label. In
the discrete case, note that the entropy H(Q) is analogous to the Shannon
self-information entropy of a discrete random variable.

The next example illustrates how the entropy of a fuzzy-qualitative de-
scription is computed. The entropy allows the comparison of expert as-
sessments in group decision-making by means of the amount of information
provided.

Example A 5. Following Examples A 1, A 2, A 3 and A 4, and using the
same data as in Example A 4, let us suppose that the hiring committee want
to weight the three features, λ1 = curriculum vitae, λ2 = interview, and λ3

25



= salary requested, with corresponding weights 3, 1 and 1. We consider the
following normalized measure on Λ: μ({λ1}) = 35 , μ({λ2}) = 15 , μ({λ3}) =
1
5
.
In addition, we consider the linear specificity measure [29] given by Sp(A) =

d1−
∑n

j=2
wjdj, where X is a finite set of cardinality n, A is a fuzzy set of X,

d1 ≥ · · · ≥ dn are the corresponding membership degrees ordered from the
largest to the smallest, and the weights satisfy wi ∈ [0, 1] and

∑n
j=2wj = 1.

In our case, S = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}, Q1(Λ) = {A4, A3, A2}, Q2(Λ) =
{B1, B3, B2}, and we consider wj = 14 for j = 2, . . . , 5. Then:

Sp(A4) = Sp({0.5/a3, 1/a4, 1/a5}) = 1− 141− 140.5 = 0.625.
Sp(A3) = Sp({0.1/a2, 0, 7/a3, 1/a4}) = 1− 140.7− 140.1 = 0.800.
Sp(A2) = Sp({0.5/a1, 1/a2, 1/a3}) = 1− 141− 140.5 = 0.625.
Sp(B1) = Sp({1/a1, 0.5/a2}) = 1− 140.5 = 0.875.
Sp(B3) = Sp({0, 7/a3, 1/a4, 0, 7/a5}) = 1− 140.7− 140.7 = 0.650.
Sp(B2) = Sp({0.3/a1, 1/a2, 0.6/a3}) = 1− 140.6− 140.3 = 0.775.
By applying Formula (2) to the discrete case we compute the entropy of

Q1 and Q2 and compare the amount of information provided by both experts
of the committee:

H(Q1) = Sp(A4) · 35 + Sp(A3) · 15 + Sp(A2) · 15 = 0.660.
H(Q2) = Sp(B1) · 35 + Sp(B3) · 15 + Sp(A2) · 15 = 0.810.

Expert Q2 provides more information than expert Q1 (as expected be-
cause the cores of fuzzy-qualitative labels used by Q2 are more precise than
those used by Q1).

5. Conclusions and future work

This paper provides a new general representation of linguistic descriptions
by unifying qualitative and fuzzy perspectives. Fuzzy-qualitative labels are
defined as fuzzy sets where the core is a qualitative label. These include cases
where the core is either a basic qualitative label or a non-basic label – which
enables us to represent different levels of precision. A lattice structure is
given to the set of fuzzy-qualitative labels. In accordance with Ruspini’s ap-
proach, a theorem that characterizes finite fuzzy partitions of a well-ordered
set S using fuzzy-qualitative labels, where the cores and supports are qual-
itative labels, is proven. The theorem leads to a mathematical justification
for the commonly-used fuzzy partitions of real intervals via trapezoidal (or
triangular) fuzzy sets. A fuzzy-qualitative description of a set is defined as

26



both an L-fuzzy set and an extension of type-2 fuzzy sets by replacing the
secondary domain with a well-ordered set whose elements can be associated
with linguistic terms.

In addition, the information of a fuzzy-qualitative label is defined by
considering a measure of specificity. Finally, the concept of entropy of a
fuzzy-qualitative description of a set is formally introduced using a Lebesgue
integral. The amount of information given by fuzzy-qualitative descriptions is
measured via the proposed entropy. In this way, expert assessments in group
decision-making can be compared by means of the amount of information
provided.

The results of this study highlight two main areas for future research.
Firstly, given the lattice structure of L, a study of possible distances on LΛ
will be conducted. Secondly, based on the entropy introduced in this study,
the development of a consensus model for multi-attribute group decision-
making problems that support incomplete or missing information is being
considered.
