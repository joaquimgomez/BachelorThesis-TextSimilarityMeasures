Abstract

With the aim of better understanding avalanche risk in the Catalan Pyrenees, the present work focuses on the analysis of 

major  (or  destructive)  avalanches.  For  such  purpose  major  avalanche  cartography  was  made  by  an  exhaustive 

photointerpretation of several flights, winter and summer field surveys and inquiries to local population. Major avalanche 

events were used to quantify the magnitude of the episodes during which they occurred, and a Major Avalanche Activity  

Magnitude Index (MAAMI) was developed. This index is based on the number of major avalanches registered and its  

estimated frequency in a given time period, hence it  quantifies the magnitude of a major avalanche episode or winter.  

Furthermore, it permits a comparison of the magnitude between major avalanche episodes in a given mountain range, or 

between mountain ranges, and for a long enough period, it should allow analysis of temporal trends. Major episodes from 

winter 1995/96 to 2013/14 were reconstructed. Their magnitude, frequency and extent were also assessed. During the last  

19 winters, the episodes of January 22-23 and February 6-8 in 1996 were those with highest MAAMI values, followed by 

January 30-31, 2003, January 29, 2006, and January 24-25, 2014. To analyze the whole twentieth century, a simplified  

MAAMI was  defined in  order  to  attain the same purpose with a  less  complete dataset.  With less  accuracy,  the same 

parameters were obtained at winter time resolution throughout the twentieth century. Again, 1995/96 winter had the highest 

MAAMI value followed by 1971/72, 1974/75 and 1937/38 winter seasons. The analysis of the spatial extent of the different  

episodes allowed refining the demarcation of nivological regions, and improving our knowledge about the atmospheric  

patterns that cause major episodes and their climatic interpretation. In some cases, the importance of considering a major  

avalanche episode as the result of a previous preparatory period, followed by a triggering one was revealed.

Major avalanche, major avalanche episode, Pyrenees, magnitude, frequency, hazard, risk.

1 Introduction

At mountain areas that receive frequent large storms, the 10-year and the 100-year avalanche in a particular path may be 

similar in size. In contrast, in some generally low-snowfall areas, the 100-year avalanche may be many times larger than the 

10-year avalanche. The historical record or the damage to vegetation provide good evidence of avalanche potential in the 

heavy-snowfall  locations,  while  the  low-snowfall  locations  require  extensive  applications  of  indirect  techniques  to  

determine the size of the long-return-period event (Mears, 1992).

The Catalan Pyrenees, especially in its southern side present a low and irregular snowfall regime (García et al., 2007). In 

this region, migration of people from mountainous areas to cities during the sixties and seventies of the last century caused a 

major human dispersal and thus difficulty in finding historical memory. These factors make that avalanche risk, due to low 

frequency avalanches,  still presents many unknowns despite being  significant. In any case, either through surveys to the 

Pyrenean population, or through searching in historical archives, nowadays we know that in Catalonia there are at least 11 

villages that have historically been affected by avalanches (Rodés and Miranda, 2009; Avalanche Database of Catalonia, 

BDAC), some of which  almost completely destroyed (Gessa,  1444; Tavascan-Plau, 1604; Àrreu, 1803), and numerous 

isolated  houses, affected  or destroyed.  Furthermore there  are frequent  episodes of lower  intensity affecting  mountain 

infrastructures (e.g.  roads, ski  resorts, power lines) every  winter.  This high frequency activity is what causes victims in 

winter sports (about 1.5 fatalities per average winter in the Pyrenees of Catalonia, Martinez and Oller, 2004).

Knowing how often major episodes occur, their intensity, and their tendency through time, in relation to climate variability,  

are basic questions to better understand hazard and to manage avalanche risk in this mountain range.

Different works have dealt with the characterization of major avalanche episodes in the Pyrenees, from different points of 

view.  Esteban et  al. (2005) relate the avalanche activity to the snowfall  regime and characterize the different synoptic 

circulation patterns that can generate fresh snow depths susceptible to produce avalanches from a set of 15 years. Garcia-

Sellés et al. (2007 and 2009) proposed the study from the analysis of atmospheric circulation associated with the occurrence 

of major avalanches documented through monitoring and surveillance. From episodes identified during the past 40 years, 

they  determined  and  classified  which  are  the  atmospheric configurations that generated them,  and  they  obtained   the 

probability of occurrence for each one of the regions established for the regional avalanche forecasting. Finally, Muntán et

al. (2004 and 2009) identified new events from dendrochronological analysis of tree rings from trees affected by avalanches, 

from which they reconstructed major episodes and determined their triggering atmospheric and snowpack conditions over 

the past 40 years. They also identified probable events up to 100 years ago.

Extensive work has been performed in the French Alps (Eckert et al., 2010b; 2013) and the French Pyrenees (Eckert et al.,  

2007; 2010a; 2013; Eckert, 2009), with observational avalanche data obtained from the EPA (Enquête Permanente sur les 

Avalanches). Avalanche events from around 3900 paths were systematically recorded since the beginning of the 20 th century. 

The main goal of this work was to analyze avalanche activity throughout time and space in order to determine trends or 

changes, and its possible relation with climate change, from the use of advanced statistical procedures. Two periods showing 

different trends were determined during the last 60 years with a change point around 1978 and a retreat of avalanche runouts 

over the last  61 winters  for  high magnitude events,  although the probability  of  a  high magnitude event  has  remained 

constant, suggesting that climate change has recently had little impact on the avalanching rhythm in France.

Studies in other mountain  ranges based on avalanche records as quantifiers of the magnitude of avalanche episodes, do 

establish indexes (e.g. Avalanche Activity Index, AAI) to quantify the daily degree of activity or the degree of activity for a 

greater period of time with variable  accuracy depending on the available data (Schweizer  et  al.,  1998;  Laternser and 

Schneebeli, 2002; Haegeli and McClung, 2003; Eckert et al., 2010a). Others (Germain et al., 2009), used similar indexes to 

quantify avalanche activity identified from dendrochronological analysis. In all these works the methodology and scale of 

work is adapted to the completeness and quality of the database used in each case.

In the present work, we analyzed individual major avalanches to quantify the magnitude and frequency of major avalanche 

episodes in the Catalan Pyrenees. We considered a "major avalanche" (MA) as the avalanche which extent exceeds the reach 

of the usual (frequent) avalanches, causing damage in case there is forest or infrastructures in the vicinity (Schaerer, 1986).  

These avalanches have been described as destructive by Schneebeli et al (1997) and specifically catastrophic when they  

affect villages and cause damage to property (buildings, roads and other infrastructures; Höller, 2009). We observed that 

these avalanches typically have a return period over 10 years. We considered a "major avalanche episode" (MAE) as the  

period in which the release of one or more MA occurs due to snowpack instability generally caused by a severe storm with  

high  snowfalls  accompanied  by  substantial  drifting  snow,  but  also  temperature  variations  causing  snowmelt  and  or 

fluctuations of the freezing level, designated as “avalanche cycle” by other authors (Höller, 2009; Eckert et al., 2011). It can

last from a few hours to several days. It’s relation to climatic factors makes its study highly valuable to improve avalanche 

forecasting (Birkeland et al., 2001; García et al., 2009; Eckert et al., 2011).

We worked with MA because they cause damage and therefore risk, and because this fact allows collecting a complete data  

set of avalanches obtained from a threshold defined by the observed damage, as applied by Fitzharris (1980).

The objectives of this paper are: (i) to reconstruct major avalanche episodes occurred over the Pyrenees of Catalonia during  

the twentieth and early twenty-first century, (ii) to determine their magnitude, (iii) frequency, and (iv) spatial extent.

The rest  of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the main particularities to consider in relation to the 

avalanching process and climatic behavior of the study area. Section 3 describes the data set used for this work and how it  

was treated. Section 4 analyses MAE from time and space point of views considering two temporal periods according to 

data accuracy. Section 5 discusses the obtained results while section 6 summarizes the main outcomes of the work.

2 Study area

The study area comprises the Catalan Pyrenees, or southeastern part of the Pyrenean range (Figure 1), an area of 5000 km2. 

The highest peaks just exceed 3000 m a.s.l.  Where the terrain is prone to avalanche release,  avalanches can trigger  from 

above 1400 m a.s.l., and they can reach elevations as low as 600 m a.s.l. (Oller et al., 2006). In this area, the Cartographic 

and Geological Institute of Catalonia (ICGC) carries out an observation and surveillance survey from which avalanche data 

is added in the Avalanche Database of Catalonia (BDAC, Oller et al., 2005).

The forest, widespread all across the range, plays a key role in the detection of MA. The timberline oscillates between 2100 

and 2500 m a.s.l. (Carreras  et al., 1996).  Above these elevations, the density of trees decreases dramatically to a point 

(treeline) from which only some individuals develop as a bush. Trees act as sensors that record any disturbance or impact 

affecting their growth. The effects remain for years and can be used to map avalanches even after the disappearance of the 

avalanche deposit. Therefore, their mapping can be more systematic than the mapping of avalanches that have not caused 

destruction to forest.  Avalanches that affect human settlements and infrastructures were also considered, but  vulnerable 

elements are distributed irregularly and sometimes they are variable in time, and this fact makes the analysis more complex.

High-frequency avalanches generally occur above the timberline. Currently it is not possible to get a systematic record of 

such avalanches,  as  observations are made mainly from fixed points covering small areas of the territory, or they are

registered selectively in case of accident. They are impossible or very difficult to detect after the thaw if they don’t produce 

any further  evidence. In addition, even low-frequency avalanches releasing and arriving above the timberline are very 

difficult to detect after the thaw. For that reason, these areas, glacial cirques and hanging valleys above 2000 m, were 

considered areas without information, or blind areas (shaded  in green in Figure 1). In these areas it was not possible to 

obtain an exhaustive inventory of major avalanches.

Figure 1. Location of the Catalan Pyrenees. Nivological regions are demarcated by violet boundaries: AR (Aran-Franja nord  

de  la  Pallaresa),  RF (Ribagorçana-Vall  Fosca),  PL (Pallaresa),  PP (Perafita-Puigpedrós),  CM (Vessant  nord  del  Cadí-

Moixeró), PR (Prepirineu), TF (Ter-Freser). Areas susceptible to avalanche activity (shaded in red). Areas without MA 

information (shaded in green). Climate varieties identified by García et al., 2007. 

In 1990 the study area was divided into 8 nivological regions (NR) for operational forecasting (García et al., 1996). In 1994 

these regions were reduced to 7 (Figure 1). This division was based on climate characteristics, snowpack evolution and 

avalanche  activity  (García-Sellés  et  al.,  2007)  for  a  better  characterization  of  the  snow  conditions  and  for  a  better 

communication of the avalanche forecasting bulletin (BPA). Hence, it was the empirical result of 20 years of avalanche 

forecasting. It is not a climatic classification in a strict sense, because at present meteorological data series are not long 

enough to support it (García-Sellés et al., 2007). These regions are Aran-Franja nord de la Pallaresa (AR), Ribagorçana-Vall  

Fosca (RF), Pallaresa (PL), Perafita-Puigpedrós (PP), Vessant nord del Cadí-Moixeró (CM), Prepirineu (PR), Ter-Freser 

(TF). All the regions drain their waters towards the Mediterranean sea with the exception of the western half of AR which  

drains towards the Atlantic ocean.

Three climate varieties were defined (García-Sellés et al., 2007). The north-western part has a humid oceanic climate with  

regular winter precipitation (AR region). The total amount of new snow is about 500-600 cm in winter and the winter  

average temperature is -2.5°C at 2200 m a.s.l.. Towards the south of the western Catalan Pyrenees (RF, PL, PP and CM 

regions), the weather gains continental traits, and winter precipitation decreases. The average new snow depth at 2200 m 

a.s.l. is 250 cm in winter and the average temperature is -1.3°C. The prevailing winds are from the north and northwest, and 

they  are  more  intense  than  in  the  oceanic  domain,  often  with  gusts  over  100  km/h.  In  the  eastern  Pyrenees  the  

Mediterranean influence takes  predominance.  Winter  precipitation increases  though irregularly distributed (PR and TF 

regions) and it is linked to Mediterranean cyclogenesis. The prevailing winds come from north and highest gusts often 

exceed 200 km/h at 2000 m a.s.l. The total amount of new snow at 2200 m a.s.l. is about 350-450 cm and winter average  

temperature is -0.8°C.

García-Sellés et al (2009) identified the atmospheric patterns which generate MAE over the Pyrenees of Catalonia. They 

worked  with  25  episodes  from  1972  to  2007  (35  winters),  obtaining  6  atmospheric  patterns  at  synoptic  scale  at  a 

geopotential height of 500 hPa that cause major avalanche episodes (Table 1). They observed that the most common pattern 

(39% of variance) were north and northwest advections. The 2nd and 3rd patterns, significantly similar to middle and low 

levels (east and southeast advections), occurred with a frequency of 31%. The other patterns have a lower frequency and 

they constitute the remaining 25%. This classification was used in the present work to analyze the selected MAE.

3 Material and methods

3.1 Major avalanche data

We worked with avalanches recorded in the BDAC of the ICGC (Oller et al., 2005). Data were collected over the past 25  

years. Currently the BDAC stores 3052 avalanche observation (AO) records, dated from 1971 to present, and 459 avalanche 

enquiry (AE) registers (called generically avalanche enquiries although they include enquiries –oral- information s. s. and  

also  historical  documentation)  from  the  Middle  Ages  to  1997.  In  the  BDAC,  each  register  is  mapped  and  different  

qualitative and quantitative data are recorded (release date and conditions, morphometrics, flow characteristics, damage).  

AO data  come from the  ICGC observation  network  created  in  1988 (Furdada  et  al.,  1990)  and  AE data  come from 

systematic field surveys performed from 1986 to 2006 to elaborate the Avalanche Paths Map (Oller et  al.,  2006) even 

though nowadays if new findings are made they get recorded likewise.

For  this  study  an  extra  effort  was  done  to  complete  and  improve  the  MA  data  of  the  BDAC.  Specially,  the  

photointerpretation of different flights with complete coverage of the Catalan Pyrenees was reinforced. Moreover, additional 

work was done to prepare data for treatment: (i) selection of major avalanches, (ii) debugging data to avoid mistakes and 

repetitions and (iii) completing the series from field work, inquiries to population and photointerpretation.

Altogether, we used a dataset consisting of 654 major avalanches, 477 of which dated, at least, at winter season resolution, 

and the rest, dated with less accuracy.

Avalanche information was obtained through various sources (Figure 2): (i) event observation, (ii) photointerpretation, (iii) 

historical information and (iv) dendrochronology. Each source contributes in a different manner, these being complementary 

sources (Ancey, 2004; Corona et al., 2012), the joint use of which improves the reconstruction of the registered avalanches. 

An outline of advantages and drawbacks depending on the source is given further below.

Based on the completeness of the series, we defined 3 periods: (i) P1, with very sporadic records prior to the twentieth  

century obtained from historical documents largely. Usually they are isolated events that affect localities. The oldest events 

are dated to the fifteenth century. The length of the runout of most of these avalanches has not been repeated since then. The 

MA register has not have enough continuity to be used in the time analysis, but the runout distance of these avalanches have 

interest as a reference distance in relation to the length of other avalanches, all in the same avalanche path, as in  the 

corresponding NR. (ii) P2, which covers the twentieth century, until winter 1994/95. Mostly, the record was obtained from

inquiries to the local population, but also from dendrochronological analyses (Muntán et al., 2004 and 2009). The dataset is  

incomplete but probably the most important events were recorded. P3 (iii), from winter 1995/96 to the present, the record of 

MA can be considered systematic and complete. Avalanches were mapped from the observation of phenomena and evidence 

on the vegetation and infrastructures.

Although there are records since the 15th century (P1) in the dataset, we worked with P2 and P3 data as it was considered 

that the series were reasonably complete with respect to the episodes of greater magnitude (Figure 2).

 

Figure 2. Decadal distribution of MA (Major Avalanches) recorded, and source of the data in P2 and P3 periods. Date of 

winter has the format Y1Y1Y1Y1Y2Y2, where Y1Y1Y1Y1 is the year in which the winter season starts, and Y2Y2 identifies the 

consecutive year.

3.1.1 Event observation

Events can be mapped from direct observation of their effects during winter or from effects on vegetation or infrastructures  

once winter is over. We call terrain mapping the group of methods used to map avalanches through their effects. In MAE, 

during winter,  the large number of fallen avalanches requires a good mapping strategy, because the lapse of time before 

avalanche deposits disappear might be short or weather conditions can be adverse to carry out the task. So, when possible, 

helicopter flights were done just after the MAE in order to obtain an overview of the extent of the episode and the released 

avalanches and to take photos. This previous work allowed a prioritization for subsequent mapping in the field of the most

important avalanches; while the remaining avalanches were mapped from the pictures taken from the air. The mapping of 

the avalanche in the field increased the accuracy of the observations made from the air.

All this procedure was possible, on the one hand, if there were appropriate  flying conditions (visibility and good  wind 

conditions) and good accessibility over land to the avalanche sites, and, on the other hand, if subsequent snowfalls, drifted 

snow accumulations or high temperatures, had not altered the deposit conservation, hindering its identification. Orthoimages 

and topographic base 1:5000 were used as reference maps, as well as GPS, allowing to georeference all field observations 

accurately up to reaching metric resolution. For smaller magnitude MAE, the work was done exclusively over land.

Temporal accuracy of the data is often at episode resolution (daily or almost daily). Normally, although we have no accurate 

temporal  information  of  all  avalanches  recorded,  episodes  can  be  reconstructed  from  the  analysis  of  the  avalanche  

characteristics and their spatial distribution. Spatial resolution is variable. If the cartography was made from an oblique  

photo, and not many references (trees, rocks, forms) could be identified on the landscape, the error could be up to 100 m.  

Besides, if there were good references, the error could be reduced to around 10 m. If the cartography was done in the field 

by using a high precision GPS, error was less than 10 m. However, for events involving very dry and non cohesive snow,  

with a powder part, the furthest point of the runout is sometimes impossible to locate because of the low definition of the 

deposit (Eckert et al., 2010a).

Summer field work after avalanche occurrence was always necessary, even though the avalanche had been mapped in 

winter. When the avalanche was destructive, especially to forest, it was mapped during summer from the damage to trees. In 

addition, conditions for accessing to the site are better and there is not the haste of the winter inspection. Evidence may be 

diverse, but mapping mostly relies on the external signs that avalanches have left on vegetation.

In addition, it is possible to map the boundaries of the affected area several years after if there is dead wood. Tree remains 

can last around 10 years at least before they disappear by decay (Elena Muntán, personal observations). The degradation 

rate of dead wood depends on moisture, temperature and species. As a general rule, humidity and average temperature is  

lower as we ascend in the Pyrenees and thus, tree wood debris lasts longer at high altitudes.  In situ stumps of resinous 

conifers can last appreciably longer. These are, however, the limits of the avalanche destruction,  and it is not possible to 

clearly distinguish the damage caused by the dense part of the avalanche from the powder part , if a mixed avalanche took 

place. Only when the avalanche occurred the winter before the field inspection, it  was still possible to see the scattered 

twigs carried by the powder part and map the limits of the area. At this stage, mapping from evidence provided information

exclusively from the track and the runout of the avalanche path. When using a high resolution GPS the georeferenciation 

accuracy can be very good (10 to 1 m), but if evidences are not clear, the identification of the limits of the avalanche can be  

more imprecise.

3.1.2 Photointerpretation

The analysis of aerial photographs guaranteed the completeness of the MA cartography, given its geographical extent and 

precision. Photointerpretation was used to search for evidences of MA not detected from event observation, to complement 

the information obtained from other sources. By comparing aerial photographs before and after the episodes, not only the 

avalanches that had destroyed the forest could be mapped, but also the extent of the devastated forest could be quantified. In 

addition, by this method, it was possible to examine the whole of the affected territory quickly and economically. The first 

available flight covering the Catalan Pyrenees in a digital format is the “American flight” performed from 1956 to 1957. 

The second digital flight covering this region was done 33 years later (1990), but the frequency of new flights has increased 

up to present, with flights from the Cartographic and Geological Institute of Catalonia (ICGC) almost every year. This fact 

allows a very detailed monitoring of recent activity.

The temporal accuracy of data depends on the frequency of the successive flights. In any case, the current resolution is, at  

best, the winter season. However, depending on the distribution and characteristics of MAE occurrence during the time  

window without ortoimages, some events can be dated at episode resolution. This resolution decreases very fast as we go 

back in time because the spacing between flights increases rapidly. The combined use of the other information sources  

improves the dating of the observed events.  The spatial  resolution depends on the images resolution,  which has  been  

improved from the first flights available (scale 1:33.000), to the recent flights (mainly 1:5.000), then obtaining a metric  

resolution when mapping. For dense flow avalanches, with a well defined deposit, the accuracy can be metric using recent  

aerial images. In the case of avalanches with a powder part, the precision is lower, obtaining a boundary corresponding to 

the extent of the avalanche with destructive capacity. Photointerpretation should always be supported by field observation in 

order to get a better accuracy.

3.1.3 Historical information

A basic source of historical information is the survey to people living in the affected areas, preferably the elderly, which 

allows obtaining  information of a longer time period.  This technique revealed the occurrence of avalanches during the

twentieth century, mainly.  Enquiry data is not continuous and systematic, and the information provided by respondents is 

often inaccurate, and in  some cases wrong (Ancey, 2006).  However, sometimes this information can be refined  by other 

sources. In any case, this information has improved significantly the knowledge of avalanche activity during the twentieth 

century (P2 period).

Temporal accuracy of recounted avalanches is often very imprecise. Only 23% of the registered events were dated to winter 

season resolution. The spatial accuracy is very variable also; it  is generally possible to know the place affected by the 

avalanche, but not its actual limits.

Search in historical archives and documents directly or indirectly provided evidence of the occurrence of avalanches. This 

technique allowed us to find events before the twentieth century. It  is  a  very time-consuming and specialized method 

because it requires the review of a large amount of documentation to find little information. But whatever data found is 

important because normally, if the avalanche was recorded, it is because it caused damage.

By contrast to other sources, the exact date of the event occurrence is often found in historical records, being the time  

resolution, daily. The spatial accuracy is very variable, because usually information describes where the damage was, but it  

is hard to know the actual reach of the avalanche. In general, the obtained information should be considered as a minimum 

distance in the runout. Even more difficult is to get information of the starting zone.

Note also that historical data are usually biased towards events that have caused damage to structures or loss of life on the  

one hand, and non-existent in areas depopulated on the other (Corona et al., 2012).

3.1.4 Dendrochronology

Dendrochronology provides data about  frequency and extent of  avalanche events from the analysis of tree rings. It  is 

therefore necessary that there is forest in the vicinity of the avalanche path. Samples from trees are collected and analysed 

using prevailing dendrogeomorphological methods such as described by Stoffel (2013). Especially, growth-disturbed trees  

located in the lower track and runout were analysed to find out high-magnitude events reaching the largest distances. In 

every avalanche path, we used reference chronologies (Stokes, 1968) built from undisturbed trees in the nearby forest to 

verify datings. Events can be dated with annual resolution by this technique and the time interval depends on tree age, data 

ranging from the oldest evidence to the present. From a spatial point of view, depending on the sampling effort, a resolution

of the order of 10 m can be obtained. Thus, we included data from dendrochronology in the dataset in the few cases where 

there was enough information related to runout extent (Muntán et al., 2004, 2009).

3.2 Major avalanche data characterization

We worked with data from 654 MA registered in 515 avalanche paths. In Figures 3, 4 and 5 some characteristics of these 

MA are compared with all the avalanche observations (AO) registered in the BDAC. Avalanche observations are mainly 

avalanches that cause winter sports accidents and affect roads, ski resorts, infrastructures, buildings, etc., or occur close to  

them,  they  are  gathered  from fixed  observation  points  and  they  include  artificially  released  avalanches.  They  permit 

comparison of  a  random sample of  avalanches documented since 1971 until today (AO),  with MA,  a selected set  of 

naturally released avalanches that comply with Schaerer definition as explained in previous sections.  It  is necessary to 

clarify the term "random" because if AO are recorded it is because they have caused some disturbance in human activity. 

Although deviations  from random are  expected  because  of  the  existence  of  avalanches  triggered  artificially,  different 

periods of observation depending on the observer or the affected infrastructure, etc., these are not dealt with in this study. 

Here AO data have only been used for comparison with MA data.

As shown in Figure 3,  major avalanches are medium to large size avalanches (sizes 3 and 4 mainly, according to the  

Canadian snow avalanche size classification system, McClung and Schaerer, 2006), with remarkable destructive capacity. 

But small size avalanches can also be considered MA if they caused damage as indicated in figure 3. Clearly MA are  

infrequent avalanches, as can be seen using AO distribution as the reference distribution. Interestingly, proportions among 

MA are similar to those found out by Barbolini and Keylock (2002) for a single avalanche path (Sudavik avalanche path,  

Iceland; classes 3+3.5, 45%, and classes 4+4.5, 50% in their case), when explaining which are the most frequent avalanche 

sizes reaching an extreme runout.

in BDAC since 1971 (BDAC-AO, n = 2054 out of 3052) according to the Canadian snow avalanche size scale (McClung 

and Schaerer, 2006).

Regarding the type of observed dynamics (Figure 4),  major  avalanches are mostly avalanches in which a powder part 

(aerosol) has been observed (purely powder or mixed ones). They are drier and therefore lighter, faster and more powerful 

than regular avalanches, which are mostly wet snow ones.

BDAC since 1971 (BDAC-AO; n=1371 out of 3052).

This behavior is due to the fact that occurrence of the episodes is registered mainly in January, in a very marked peak, 

decreasing logarithmically towards May (figure 5), being January and February the coldest months in the Catalan Pyrenees  

(SMC, UB, ICC, 1997). It explains why MA are mainly dry (57%) and often present a powder part (39%). AO are more 

uniformly and normally distributed, being February the month with the maximum frequency of avalanches recorded.

3.3 Data treatment

We worked with periods P3 (19 winters from 1995/96 to 2013/14) and P2+P3 (113 winters from 1900/01 to 2013/14),  

separately, taking into account the different resolution of the data. The common MA parameters available for both periods, 

useful for the goal of this work were the spatial distribution, the temporal distribution and the runout distance. Runout 

distance and date of occurrence data together with vegetation analysis were after used for frequency/intensity determination.

3.3.1 Common parameters: spatial, temporal distribution and runout distance

All the recorded events were georeferenced according to their X and Y coordinates.

Winter season was considered the time unit to work in P2+P3. This fact forced us to discard many events in P2 that were not 

possible to date at that resolution. However, in P3, most of the events were dated at MAE time resolution.

Runout distance is the most sensitive parameter, because accuracy is variable depending on the source of information. The 

runout  distance considered was determined  from  the  destructive  effects  of  the  avalanche.  This  is  the  only  common 

parameter for both periods, P2 and P3. Actually, what we compared is the minimum extent of the avalanche (Corona et al., 

2012) as explained before. It should be noted that the range of uncertainty is significant, and it must be taken into account in 

the interpretation of results.

The extent of the different events for each avalanche path was mapped on the digital topographic and orthophoto bases 

1:5000 of the ICGC, as shown in the example of Figure 6.

3.3.2 Frequency/Intensity

The  relationship frequency/intensity of  each  event  was  obtained  from the  relative  position of  the  different distances 

measured in the runout zone (Figure 6).  In general it is expected that in a given avalanche path, as  the average intensity 

increases downhill in the runout  zone,  the average frequency decreases  (McClung, 2008).  Thus, intensity is  indirectly 

determined from the observed frequency. This is based on the principle that the farther the reach of the avalanche, the more 

intense it is, and the more rare is the avalanche, the more the probability of being observed decreases (Mears, 1992). The 

parameter used to find out this relationship was the relative runout distance between different events, in relation to the 

frequency of occurrence in each avalanche path.

Figure 6. Example of runout distances reached by different avalanches in a given avalanche path, mapped (left) and plotted  

in a topographic profile (right). HF, MF and LF: high, medium and low frequency avalanche reaches.

The return period is the time interval in which the runout distance is achieved or exceeded in a given point. Frequency is the 

reciprocal of the return period. It is therefore possible, in principle, to map return periods in the runout zone corresponding 

to different distances downhill, for example, 1 year, 10 years, 100 years, corresponding to a mean annual probability of 1, 

0.1 , 0.01.  These distances increase in the runout zone at the same time that the return period increases  (McClung  and 

Schaerer,  2006).  Given  the lack  of data  generally everywhere, avalanche frequency can  be estimated  as an  order  of 

magnitude (Mears,  1992;  Weir,  2002).  Mears (1992) indicated  that  the return  period (T)  describes  a  range  of  time. 

According to the author, given this uncertainty, for an avalanche to which we assign a return period of 10 years based on our 

observations, the return period would be between 3 and 30 years, while a 100-year avalanche would have a T between 30 

and 300 years. In any case, the range  of uncertainty diminishes in relation to the number of events available for each 

avalanche path.

Based on the classification table of mountain hazards by  Weir (2002),  a  classification of the avalanche frequency was 

defined for each avalanche path (Table 2). The error assigned to the frequency is indicated according to Mears (1992).

Table 2. Frequency classes established for the treated avalanches (based on Weir, 2002). Values in parentheses indicate the 

range of uncertainty.

Low (LF) 100 (30-300) 0.01 (0.03-0.003)
Very low (VLF) 300 (>100) <0.003 (<0.01)

To determine the frequency in the runout zone three criteria (absolute and relative) were considered: (i) number of times that 

events with similar runout distances were repeated in relation to the lapse of time between them (absolute), (ii) vegetation 

clues as a reference (absolute), and (iii) space/time relationship between runout distances of avalanches recorded in each 

avalanche path (relative).

Very high frequency avalanches were not considered MA according to the criteria used in this study. There are no cases in 

which these avalanches have affected forest. High frequency avalanches affect forest often, but not always. At least 20% of 

the high frequency avalanches recorded in forested paths, did not affect forest. This means that possibly the record of high 

frequency avalanches is  not complete in P3 (we cannot  guarantee a complete record if  there is  no evidence).  On the 

contrary, we consider that the register of moderate to very low frequency avalanches is almost complete in P3 (figure 7).  

The long time interval between one avalanche and the next allows the forest to recover and, in the following episode, it will 

be affected. The same, but more pronounced, happens with low and very low frequency avalanches.

The number of MA in which the frequency could be determined in P1, P2 and P3 is shown in Figure 7. As it can be 

observed, the older is the period, the lower is the frequency of the registered MA. Time filters high frequency events, which  

are less destructive and therefore less perceived by the inhabitants, and only the most important MA reach us from written  

and oral sources.

In  Figure  8 the  distribution of  the registered  episodes in  P3,  number  of  MA registered per  episode  and its  estimated  

frequency is displayed. The mean is 1.6 MAE per winter, but with a high variability (standard deviation equals 1.6), with  

some winters without MAE and winters with up to 5 MAE. Only 7 winters register more than 10 MA, and the largest  

episodes just exceeded 50 MA (22-23 January and 6-8 February 1996, 30-31 January 2003 and 24-25 January 2014). High

frequency avalanches from 1995/96 episodes were probably underestimated because at that time, the surveillance service 

was at its initial stage and it was less efficient than nowadays.

episodes has the format YYYYMMD1D1D2D2, where D1D1 is the first and D2D2 the last day of the episode. HF, MF, LF: 

high, moderate and low frequency.

In three of the registered MAE (6-8 February 1996; 30-31 January 2003; 24-25 January 2014), urban areas were attained by 

MA. In the first case a hostel was seriously damaged, in the second case a house was totally destroyed and another partially  

damaged, and in the third case, a touristic-apartments building was damaged at functional level. These three episodes are the 

ones which registered most avalanche occurrences. It is important to point out  that all the damaged buildings were built 

after the seventies of the twentieth century in previously uninhabited areas.

The distribution of MA activity per winter and estimated frequencies in P3 (Figure 9) show how the lowest frequencies were 

registered during the first half of this period, being the second half more active owing to the number of major-avalanche 

winters and the frequency of MAE occurrences (Figure 10).

4 Analysis and results

4.1 Analysis of the period P3 (1995/96-2013/14)

4.1.1 Temporal analysis

A primary objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude of the registered MAE. For such a purpose an index was  

conceived, similarly to Schweizer et al (1998) and Haegeli and McClung (2003). In the case of these authors, they applied 

an index on a daily basis (Avalanche Activity Index, AAI), that is to get a value of the daily activity of avalanches. They  

based it on the avalanche size, according to the Canadian avalanche size scale (McClung and Schaerer, 2006). They used the 

sum of all observed avalanches considering a weight according to its size. In our case, since we only worked with MA,  

mostly sizes  3 and  4,  we used the frequency to emphasize the  exceptionality  of  the episode.  Major avalanches were  

classified  in  4 classes  (from 2,  high frequency,  to  5,  very  low frequency) and a weight  inversely  proportional  to  the  

estimated frequency of  each  avalanche was assigned  (0.1,  0.3,  1  and  3).  Like that  we gave  prominence  to  the  lower  

frequency avalanches, the most intense, and at the same time, the small weight of HF MA prevents significant deviations  

caused  by  the  incompleteness  of  this  frequency  class.  The  obtained  parameter  was  called  Major  Avalanche  Activity  

Magnitude Index (MAAMI). The MAAMI quantifies the magnitude of a MA for a period of time. It can be applied to the  

time scale allowed by the data resolution, e. g., episode, month, winter. In P3 we could apply this index at MAE resolution 

following the expression 1.

MA AMIe=[( N HF emax ⁡( N HF e ) ∙0,1)+(
N MF e

max ⁡( N MF e )
∙ 0,3)+(

N LF e

max ⁡(N LF e)
∙ 1)+(

N VLF e

max ⁡(N VLF e )
∙3)]/ 4,4(expression 1)

For each episode (e),  avalanches were grouped according to their frequency and were divided by the maximum value 

registered in the dataset  for  standardization. NHFe is  the number of high frequency MA recorded in an episode  e,  and 

max(NHFe) is the maximum number of recorded high frequency MA in a MAE. The resulting value for each frequency class 

is multiplied by the weight assigned to it. The final value is divided by 4.4, to obtain a result between 0 and 1.

The MAAMIe is  also an exceptionality index of the MAE for  the analyzed period. The resulting values respond to a 

logarithmic scale. Following the same reasoning about the weight assigned to the exceptionality of an avalanche, values 

were classified as shown in table 3.

Table 3. MAAMI values classification.

MAAMI
Classes Numerical value

Low <0.03
Moderate 0.03 – 0.1
High 0.l – 0.3
Very high >0.3

In P3 period (19 winters) the MAAMIe was calculated for the 29 recorded episodes (Figure 11). We obtained high values 

for January and February 1996 episodes, even though January could be considered to be very high. For 30-31 January 2003, 

29 January 2005, 29 January 2006, 18-19 February 2013 and 24-25 January 2014, the MAAMIe values were moderate, and 

for the rest of MAE values were low.

Figure 11. MAAMIe values obtained for P3, and observed avalanche dynamics (light blue: aerosol, dark blue: dense dry, 

orange: dense wet, red: slushflow) per Major Avalanche Episode (MAE). The scale of the ordinate axis is logarithmic. Date  

of episodes has the format YYYYMMD1D1D2D2, where D1D1 is the first and D2D2 the last day of the episode.

For each episode, the extent of the area deforested by avalanches was mapped and measured (Figure 12). This parameter is  

also an indicator of the exceptionality of the episode. We correlated the MAAMIe values with the deforested area values and 

we obtained a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96, which reinforces the validity of the MAAMIe as an indicator of MAE 

magnitude.

(2013/14 MAE deforested areas were not added to the dataset because the mapping process was not finished at the date of  

the publication of this work).

Major avalanche episodes with greatest MAAMIe values correspond to the pattern S/SW (with a high variability) as shown 

in  Figure 13,  and  in  the  second  place,  to  patterns E/SE2  and N/NW with  less  variability.  The MAAMIe decreases 

considerably in CL and even more in  E/SE1 MAE. It is  merely testimonial in  A MAE, since  in these situations major 

avalanches have occurred sporadically.

decreasing order the following months until spring. November and December also registered low MAAMIe values. In those 

episodes in which a powder part was observed, the MAAMIe values were the highest, indicating that these are the most 

intense episodes. In contrast, the more dense and wet the avalanches, the lower the MAAMIe values (Figure 15).

Considering winter season as the temporal unit for the same time period used for episode analysis (P3), we obtained  the 

results shown in figure 16. From the 19 winters in P3 period, MAE were registered in 16 winters , being 1995/96 the most 

important  Major Avalanche Winter  (MAW), with  very high MAAMIw values.  On a second position,  winters 2005/06, 

2002/03, 2013/14, 2012/13 and 2004/05 (in decreasing order), registered moderate values, and the other winters registered 

low MAAMIw values, despite being significative in 2009/10.

Figure 16. MAAMIw values obtained for the period P3. Date of winter has the format Y1Y1Y1Y1Y2Y2, where Y1Y1Y1Y1 is 

the year  in  which the winter  season starts,  and Y2Y2  identifies  the consecutive year.  The scale of  the ordinate axis is 

logarithmic.

Note  that  when working  considering  winter  season  as  the  time period,  the  dataset  is  larger  than  when working  with 

episodes, because we can add data dated at winter time resolution to the dataset . This is due to the inaccuracy of temporal 

data when the avalanche mapping has been done from vegetation clues in summer, in the field, or by photointerpretation.

We applied a logarithmic transformation to the MAAMIw values (log_MAAMIw) in order to obtain those for statistical 

treatment. We obtained a dataset with a good significance with the test of Shapiro-Wilk (p-value 0.32 for a α level 0.05), 

which means that the function fits to a normal distribution. Considering the data set (log_MAAMIw) a normal distribution, 

we obtained the estimated probability values (table 5). They indicate the annual estimated probability of occurrence of a  

log_MAAMIw value lower than a given value. For example, the annual estimated probability of occurrence of a winter with  

a MAAMIw value lower than 0.001 is 40% while the annual estimated probability of registering a winter with a MAAMI w 

lower than 0.3 is 97% (conversely, a MAAMI higher than 0.3 is 3%).

is [1.54x10-4; 1.01x10-2].

As explained in section 3, urban areas were affected in 6-8 February 1996, 30-31 January 2003 and 24-25 January 2014  

episodes, for which moderate to very high MAAMIe values were obtained. According to the results shown in table 5, the 

estimated annual probability of occurrence of a MAAMIw higher than 0.03 (moderate) which could affect urban areas, is 

17%.

4.1.2 Spatial analysis

From the spatial  distribution of  the MA recorded in each MAE, the most  likely affected area was reconstructed.  Our  

reconstruction was based on the criterion that the behavior of air masses is strongly influenced by relief, causing 50 to 70%  

of mountain precipitation in winter (McClung and Schaerer, 2006). Orographic precipitation models include the assumption 

that precipitation is produced at a rate that is directly proportional to the rate at which the air is lifted (vertical component of  

wind velocity) over the mountains. The first mountain struck will usually induce the most precipitation and subsequent  

barriers receive less as the moisture supply in the air mass diminishes (McClung and Schaerer, 2006). This assumption is  

easily confirmed in the distribution of avalanches depending on the direction of the air mass that generated MAE.

In several occasions the occurrence of avalanches downwind from the direction of the air mass was observed. In other cases, 

the orographic lifting generated by the relief caused the triggering of avalanches on different aspects, possibly because the  

air  mass was associated with weaker winds that  did not condition the formation of overaccumulations downwind. On 

numerous occasions, the occurrence of major avalanches was not observed until reaching the highest elevations of the 

mountain range, although the air mass passed through avalanche prone areas but with lower elevations.

Taking these observations into account, we based the delimitation of the spatial extent of the different MAE according to the  

following criteria: (i) when the registered avalanche or avalanches were located in a valley open to the direction of the air  

mass, the whole valley was considered affected unless the extent of the episode could be clearly cut in a part of the valley,  

(ii) if the direction of the air mass was perpendicular to the valley, and last avalanches in the direction of the air mass were  

located upwind, the limit of the episode was mapped along the ridge of the valley, (iii) in the case that avalanches were

registered on the leeward of the ridge, the border of the episode was mapped at the bottom of the valley. An example of how 

we mapped the spatial extent of MAE is shown in Figure 17 for  winter 2002-2003.

Figure 17. Map of the episodes inferred from the registered avalanches. Example from 2002/03 winter. Two episodes were 

reconstructed: 30-31 January (component N/NW) and 27 February (component E/SE1).

These arguments fitted very well for MAE which associated atmospheric pattern was the triggering factor of conditions  

leading to MA occurrence. Instead of this, in some episodes the spatial distribution of the recorded MA showed a typical  

configuration from other patterns. In these cases, the criteria explained in the previous paragraph had to be adapted. For 

instance, the 18-19 February 2013 MAE, classified as E/SE1, showed a typical N/NW pattern affected area (Figure 18),  

meaning that this MAE is the result of a preparation period and a later triggering one. During the first part, the unstable  

conditions are prepared, but it is in the second part that the episode is triggered. In fact, before 18-19 February 2013, two 

N/NW MAE occurred successively (8-11, and 15 February) with low MAAMIe values (few MA were registered). These 

which prepared the conditions for  the following episode,  a E/SE1,  which tipically  affects  the easternmost  PR and TF 

nivological regions, but in this case it affected only AR region, registering moderate MAAMIe values. This fact reinforces 

the idea that the study of MAE from a climatic point of view needs a wider temporal approach, considering previous 

atmospheric conditions (García et al., 2013), and at the same time, it supports the relationship between avalanche activity  

and a cumulative NAO index demonstrated by Keylock (2003).

Figure 18. Map of 18-19 February 2013 episode inferred from the registered avalanches.

In order to better define the nivological regions (NR), the spatial extent of the different MAE was grouped according to their 

associated  atmospheric  patterns,  described  by  García  et  al.,  2009  (previously  shown  in  table  1),  and  frequency  and  

MAAMIe values were represented superimposed (Figures 19 to 25).

The N/NW configuration was the most frequent atmospheric pattern, with 10 recorded episodes. This pattern affects the 

north-western  part  of  the study area more  frequently than  other  parts  (Figure  19,  left). It  is  characterized  by  intense 

snowfalls, strong winds from north and northwest and very active snow drift processes. These episodes affected in a relative 

uniform way the AR region, and their frequency decreased towards the south, in PL and RF regions. The Eastern Pyrenees 

were only affected by one N/NW episode, except for the region TF and PP, the northern ones, which registered two other 

episodes close to their northern boundaries. In general these episodes showed high MAAMIe values (figure 19, right), but 

the sum of all gives a quite homogeneous result for all the regions with the highest values along the southern boundary of 

AR region. In the majority of cases, air masses coming from N and NW are the main drivers for N/NW episodes, but  

although AR region is the most affected, the strong weight of the MAAMIe obtained for the MAE of 6-8 February 1996, 

which origin was at least during the 22-23 January 1996 MAE, a S/SW pattern, gives a MA distribution more typically  

caused by a S/SW than by a N/NW MAE.

Three E/SE1 episodes (Figure 20) were recorded. Two of them affected regions PR and CM with low MAAMIe values. One 

of  these episodes  corresponded to the  slushflows occurrence  in 1997/98 winter  (Furdada et  al.,  1999), an exceptional 

phenomenon since avalanche activity is recorded in the Catalan Pyrenees, which affected a limited area. The third episode 

was registered in 18-19 February 2013 which as explained before, affected only the AR region although the atmospheric 

pattern  associated  to  this  episode  was  characterized  by  a  southeast  maritime  flow at  surface  levels  producing  heavy  

precipitations in regions closest to the Mediterranean Sea. This MAE registered moderate values, the highest for a E/SE1 

MAE.

The E/SE2 atmospheric pattern typically affects eastern and southern regions by worm and very humid Mediterranean flows 

on surface penetrating from east. Only two episodes were registered (Figure 21), but the affected areas do not overlap. The 

first episode affected RF region and the southern part of PL region, while the second one affected almost all the Eastern 

Pyrenees, excepting PP region. MAAMIe values were low for the first episode and moderate for the second. As a whole, the 

spatial extent of this pattern affected the southern part of the Pyrenees.

There  was only one  CL atmospheric  pattern  episode registered  (Figure  22),  specifically  the  one  of  8-9  March 2010, 

characterized by heavy snowfalls and northern strong winds, García et al (2009).  It  affected exclusively TF region with 

low/moderate MAAMIe values.

S/SW episodes,  typically  characterized by south and southwestern wind flows carrying warm and humid air  from the 

Atlantic and even the Mediterranean on lower levels over the Pyrenees, were the second pattern according to their frequency 

(7 MAE registered, Figure 23). They affected all NR but mainly  the RF region and the western part of the PL region. 

Towards the east and the north, frequency decreased, affecting the rest of  NR. In general, the recorded MAAMIe values 

were high for the southern regions (RF, PL, PP, CM, PR, TF), but low when they affected the northern one (AR). In fact, the 

highest  MAAMIe value of the dataset  is reached with the S/SW MAE of 22-23 January 1996, which is the only one  

considered a very high value. This value has an important weight in the results.

Despite the fact that in A episodes the warm air mass can embrace a very large area of the  Pyrenees, it only  caused the 

triggering of avalanches occasionally.  During P3 period, we  identified three episodes (Figure 24), registering the lowest 

MAAMIe values.

Figure 24. Spatial extent of the Major Avalanche Episodes (MAE) generated by A atmospheric pattern. Frequency of MAE 

occurrence (left) and sum of the MAAMIe values of the superimposed events (right). NR: Nivological Regions; ASA: 

Avalanche susceptibility area.

The superimposition of all the P3 MAE (29 episodes, Figure 25) showed a higher frequency in the AR, RF and western PL, 

in western Pyrenees, and TF, PR and CM in eastern Pyrenees. It is important to emphasize that PP region was only affected 

by 2 major episodes and therefore it is the region with the lowest MAE  frequency. This is possibly due to its location, 

sheltered from the air masses that generate MAE, by the surrounding ranges. Instead of this, the southern regions registered 

higher MAAMIe values in comparison with the northern one AR (which drains towards the north), with the exception of its  

eastern arm (which drains towards the south). The highest values were recorded at the eastern arm of the AR region and  

northern RF and PL regions in the western part, and TF, CM and PF regions at the eastern part of the Pyrenees. Again, this 

result is dominated by the very high MAAMIe values from 1995/96 winter, which affected all the southern NR.

According to the spatial distribution of MAE and its corresponding MAAMIe values,  the NR were  redefined to better 

characterize the MAE spatial distribution. The new divisions were called Major Avalanche Nivological Regions (MANR). 

From west to east they  are: GA (Garona),  PN (Nord  Pallaresa), RP (Ribagorçana-Pallaresa oest), PE (Pallaresa est), SN 

(Nord Segre), SL (Segre-Llobregat), TF (Ter-Freser) (Figure 26).

These regions can also be grouped according to  the climatic influence, in Oceanic influence regions, affected mainly by 

N/NW episodes (GA and PN); Continental influence regions, affected mainly by S/SW episodes, but also N/NW (RP, PE 

and SN); and Mediterranean regions, affected by a high variety of atmospheric patterns (up to 5; SL and TF, figure 26).

registered Major Avalanche Episodes (MAE). Frequency of MAE occurrence in P3 is indicated in brackets. Black lines 

indicate main climatic divisions and dashed black lines, secondary divisions.

We divided AR NR into GA (chiefly Val d’Aran valley, western part of AR draining towards the north) and PN (eastern arm  

of the former AR, draining towards the south). The  GA region is affected mainly by N/NW episodes (Table 6) and less 

frequently by S/SW and E/SE1 MAE. The PN region is a transitional MANR, affected by N/NW MAE as GA region, and 

less frequently by a more wider variety of MAE due to its open configuration towards the south. RP MANR is composed by 

the addition of the western part of PL NR to RF NR owing to their similar behavior. PE region is the remaining part of PL 

NR, similar to PN but less active. In regions RP and PE, N/NW episodes occur less frequently than in AR and PN. They are 

both affected also by E/SE2 and S/SW atmospheric patterns, but  the main difference between them is the frequency of 

affectation by S/SW episodes. RP is the region most affected by S/SW episodes, which affect PE region less frequently. GA, 

PN and RP regions register the highest frequency of MAE occurrence. PE region is affected equally by N/NW episodes, and 

by southern component episodes, particularly E/SE2 and S/SW. N/NW episodes with high MAAMIe values are powerful 

enough to cross  regions GA and PN.  Episodes E/SE2 and S/SW can reach the  top of the Noguera Pallaresa valley and 

adjacent valleys (PN region) due to its SW-NE direction, but they can’t cross the French border ridges.  SN is the region 

which presents the least MAE activity. It is  affected only by the two main episodes of 1995/96 winter (S/SW and N/NW

atmospheric patterns), and by one small N/NW MAE registered in 2013/14 winter.  The low activity in this region may be 

due to the fact that it is located downwind of most air masses. Andorra mountains protect it from N/NW episodes and the 

Cadí range in the south protects it from E/SE1 and E/SE2 episodes mainly. SL region presents more frequent activity. This 

region and the TF region are the most varied regions in relation to the diverse origin of the MAE that affect them, mainly by 

southern episodes, but also by the N/NW episode of February 1996. In fact, SL is the only MANR that is affected by MAE 

generated by all described atmospheric patterns. It is logical, since the main orographic barrier oriented East-West (Serra del 

Cadí range), perpendicular to the direction of air masses coming from lower latitudes, dominates this region. Usually the 

main MA activity is observed on the north face of this range. The last region, TF, is affected by almost the same number of 

episodes than SL, but in this case it is not affected by E/SE1 episodes. Specifically, it is affected by 2 N/NW episodes, one 

E/SE2, one CL and one S/SW. It is the only area affected by CL atmospheric pattern.

From a climatological point of view, the occurrence of the several atmospheric patterns leading major avalanches is closely  

linked  to  low  frequency  atmospheric  circulation  patterns  such  as  North  Atlantic  Oscillation  (NAO)  and  Western 

Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO) (García-Sellés et al., 2010). Two patterns are observed: the whole Catalan Pyrenees 

shows a good correlation between major avalanche activity and negative phase of NAO, but the Oceanic domain has the 

particularity of concentrating major avalanche episodes in weak positive phases of NAO (N/NW). Even though for the 

period 1971–2008 NAO index shows a positive trend, there have been major avalanche situations linked to periods of 

highly negative phase of NAO (E/SE1, E/SE2, S/SW) (García-Sellés et al., 2010).

4.2 Analysis of the period P2+P3 (1900/01-2013/14)

4.2.1 Temporal analysis

To characterize episodes recorded during P2+P3 period, we worked at winter season time resolution in order to adapt to P2 

data  limitations. Since the  dataset  was  not  complete,  the  calculation of  the  MAAMI was  simplified  considering the 

minimum frequency obtained from the entire MA registered per winter in each MANR, according to expression 2.

SMAAMI =∑
i=1

N min ( Fwi )
3 ∙ N (expression 2)

This index was called Simplified Major Avalanche Activity Magnitude Index (SMAAMI), where min(Fw) corresponds to 

the lowest frequency of the MA recorded in one winter (w)  for each of the 3 MANR (i stands for these regions). A low 

correlation MAAMIw-SMAAMI forced us to simplify the 7 MANR to 3, according to the main climatic divisions, for 

which the Pearson correlation was 0,75. The weight for the estimated frequencies (again, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 from high to very 

low frequency  MA) was  assigned  in  order  to highlight the  less  probable  episodes. Divisor values correspond  to  the 

maximum value of the frequency (3) and maximum number of climatic regions (N=3) for standardization of the data.

The SMAAMI is a simplification of the MAAMI devised in case of less complete data series. It is based on the assumption  

that  larger destructive avalanches are easier to remember than high frequency avalanches.  Hence,  the result  has to be  

interpreted as an approximation. It highlights the maximum values registered in each region and therefore those episodes  

with low frequency MA and less extensive, against very extensive episodes but with high frequency MA.

In figure 27 the calculated SMAAMI values for P2+P3 are represented. Winter season 1995/96 shows the highest SMAAMI 

value, while the episodes of 1971/72, 1974/75, 1937/38, 2004/05, and 2005/06 show high SMAAMI values (in decreasing 

order), together with 14 other winters bordering the value 0.1. The remaining recorded MAE (25 winters) register moderate 

and low SMAAMI values.

Figure 27. SMAAMI values obtained for P2+P3 period. Date of winter has the format Y1Y1Y1Y1Y2Y2, where Y1Y1Y1Y1 is 

the year in which the winter season starts, and Y2Y2 identifies the consecutive year.

P2+P3 provides a longer time period than P3 but more incomplete. For its analysis we adopted a compromise solution as 

was adopted by Keylock et al. (1999). We classified SMAAMI values into 6 classes in order to compare frequencies (Figure  

28). We considered P3 distribution which better explains how low values are distributed because the exhaustive surveillance 

task guaranties a good high frequency MAW record. On the other hand, we considered that in P2+P3 high SMAAMI values 

were more reliable because instead of being an incomplete data set, highest MAW should be those which would have been 

preserved through oral sources. For this reason, class 5 was assumed to contain the most realistic frequencies for both 

datasets. From this class to the lower ones, the distribution was scaled according to P3 distribution. Of course this is an  

approximation in order to reduce the lack of data in P2 and this weakness has to be taken into account when interpreting the  

results.

The statistical analysis of the resulting dataset provided good significance with the K-S test fitting to a Poisson distribution 

(p-value  0.28  for  a  α level  0.05).  We  obtained  the  probability  values  (table  7).  They  indicate  the  annual  estimated  

probability of occurrence of a SMAAMI value lower than a given value. For example, the annual probability of occurrence  

of a winter with a SMAAMI value lower than 0.03 is 39% while the annual probability of registering a winter with a  

SMAAMI higher than 0.2 is 4%.

Comparing the MAAMIw annual probability estimates (table 5) with those of SMAAMI (table 7), as could be expected, 

according to the different distribution function to which each dataset was fitted, values are significantly different. MAAMIw 

values are more than a 50 % higher for moderate values, decreasing to less than 10% for high values. It clearly indicates that 

although there is  a  high correlation between MAAMIw and SMAAMI,  data shows a different  MAE occurrence.  This 

difference could be due to (i) the incompleteness of the P2 series, and (ii) the short period of P3 series. 

4.2.2 Spatial analysis

Given the lack of information in P2, it was not possible to reach the same level of accuracy for the data set P2+P3. In many  

cases, the period P2 only registers one MA per winter. In this case the value 1 was assigned to the MANR that at least  

recorded a MA per winter. The results (Figure 29) show how for P2+P3, GA is the region where MAW were registered more 

often, followed by RP, PN and TF. Regions PE and SL were affected in a similar way and finally SN was the less affected  

region. This result, although NR are different, is remarkably similar to the one obtained for García-Sellés et al (2007),  

analyzing 1939-2006 period.

5 Discussion

This study provides a better understanding to the characterization of MAE over the Catalan Pyrenees. It was essential to  

have an exhaustive database with a detailed cartographic record of major avalanches. It allowed to reconstruct 29 major 

avalanche episodes from winters 1995/96 to 2013/14 (period P3) considering spatial distribution of MA and the atmospheric 

circulation patterns defined by García et al. (2009). On the one hand, it completes the information provided by these authors 

and on the other hand it incorporates new episodes.  We did not follow, however,  the same criterion to consider major 

avalanches. In the case of García et al. (2009) the criterion followed for considering MA was the size of the avalanche, 

while in the present work, the criterion was based on the destructiveness of the event. This makes the episodes considered 

not match in some cases. 

The Major Avalanche Activity Magnitude Index (MAAMI) allowed quantifying the magnitude of avalanche episodes over 

the Pyrenees of Catalonia for the first time. This is a significant result because it enables quantifying and comparing the 

magnitude of avalanche episodes over a desired or possible time period. The SMAAMI index is a simplified resource when 

not much data are available and allows quantifying the magnitude of MAE at winter season resolution. It is based on the 

identification of the lower frequency MA recorded for each MANR per winter. It allowed us to reconstruct the series of the 

twentieth and early twenty-first centuries (P2+P3 periods), although it is not complete. The results show that the episodes of 

January and February 1996 are still the greatest known in the last 19 winters, and possibly two of the greatest in the last 100 

years. This result is in accordance with that of Muntán et al. (2009), for the last 40 years. Other winters with high SMAAMI 

values were 1971/72, 1974/75, 1937/38, 2004/05 and 2005/06 (in decreasing order). Although for the temporal periods P3  

and P2+P3 we obtained a good correlation, probabilities obtained in both periods were significantly different. This result is  

probably due to the scattered dataset in P2 and the short temporal period in P3, in relation with the climatic variability  

typical of the studied area.

We also could characterize the MAE according to its associated atmospheric pattern in P3. It is important to note that  

southern atmospheric patterns (E/SE1, E/SE2, S/SW and A) are more varied and frequent that northern ones (N/NW, CL). 

The most surprising result was the high values of S/SW episodes. Registered S/SW episodes were the most powerful, while 

N/NW episodes were the most frequent. These results are dominated by 1995/96 episode, very infrequent according to the  

obtained probability, and for that reason results were probably biased. E/SE2 episodes recorded similar magnitude as N/NW 

ones, but they were much less frequent. Regarding the frequency with which the different atmospheric circulation patterns

took place in P3, S/SW was more times observed than in the work of García et al. (2009), although component N/NW is the  

most registered, as was also indicated by these authors. The time window was different and the selection criteria of MAE 

too,  and  these  facts  could  have  had  an  influence  on  the  results.  Further  analysis  should  clarify  the  reason  for  these 

differences. However, the spatial analysis results of this study match well with the results of García-Sellés et al. (2010),  

where major avalanche regions for the Catalan Pyrenees were grouped by applying clustering techniques. Attending to the 

major avalanche activity occurring at the same time (daily scale), regions were grouped in the three climatic domains:  

Oceanic, Continental and Mediterranean. On that study RP region was considered out of the Oceanic domain as the shortest  

proximity distance by Ward method was shown to Continental regions, but at the same time the isolated GA as Oceanic  

domain showed a unique proximity relationship just with RP. That agrees with the fact that in this study, where recent  

winters are taken into account, RP, GA and PN show the first position in major avalanche activity, which could be expected 

from an Oceanic region.

Regarding the risk, MAW which affected buildings reached MAAMIw values equal or higher than moderate. The estimated 

annual probability of occurrence of a MAW higher than moderate is 17%. All the affected buildings were touristic built after 

the seventies of the twentieth century. A better planning policy could avoid these accidents, too frequent under our point of  

view.

The spatial reconstruction of MAE from the registered MA showed, on the one hand, how MA distribution is controlled by  

snowpack-atmospheric evolution, and orography. In general, MA spatial distribution agrees with the low level air movement 

direction of the atmospheric pattern that triggers the MAE, following the valleys and diminishing its power when mountain 

ranges are arranged against its moving direction. Yet in 4 out of 29 MAE, MA distribution showed clear characteristics from 

other patterns. This was the case of 6-8 February 1996, a N/NW pattern with a S/SW configuration, the 19-20 January 2013, 

a  S/SW pattern  with  a  N/NW configuration,  the  18-19  February  2013  (Figure  18),  a  E/SE1  pattern  with  a  N/NW 

configuration, and 5 March 2013, a S/SW pattern with a N/NW configuration. This fact confirms that a MAE can not only  

be characterized by the atmospheric pattern that triggered it, but also by a previous preparatory period which should be  

considered (García-Sellés et al., 2013). This period, variable in time, prepares the conditions that can favour MA activity.  

These situations can also be identified indirectly using a cumulative NAO index (CNI), which exhibits a closer relationship 

to avalanche activity than the standard index (Keylock, 2013; García-Sellés et al., 2010). This preparatory process was not  

considered in the present work when classifying the MAE, only the atmospheric patterns triggering MAE were considered.

The analysis of MAE frequency, distribution and extent has enabled us to define 7 MANR different to the current NR, more  

adjusted to MAE extent, magnitude and frequency. These regions improve the characterization of MAE, but do not replace  

the existing NR, which are also used for high and very high-frequency events (not dealt with in this work), and which were  

defined for the communication of regional avalanche forecasting.

According to the climatic zoning defined by Garcia et al. (2007), in P3, MANR GA and PN would have greater oceanic 

influence. However GA region, 75% of the received episodes were N/NW, namely 12 (21 %). In contrast PN region was 

also affected (around 50%) by episodes S/SW, E/SE1 and E/SE2, adding more episodes to the N/NW ones (11, 20%).  

Eastward frequency decreases, from RP to SN regions, where in this last region the minimum affectation is recorded due to 

its location downwind of most components. This area has only been stricken by the MAE that affected almost all regions.  

Thus, MANR RP (21%), PE (13%) and SN (3 %), are located in the area of continental influence. It is an area with a strong  

gradient, where one of the most frequently affected and the less frequently affected regions (RP and SN) are located. In the 

eastern sector, MAE increase in frequency in SL and TF regions (11% and 9% respectively) due to the Mediterranean  

influence.

The results in P2+P3 also present some significant differences with the results obtained in P3 period (Figures 26 and 29). A 

surprising result, was the homogeneity of MAE frequency registered in GA, RP and PN regions in P3 (around 20% each 

one), taking into account that in P2+P3 it shows a positive deviation towards the GA and TF regions, not observed at P3, 

while the continental climate regions are less frequently affected in P2+P3. Garcia-Sellés et al (2007) obtained similar 

results than in P2+P3  for the period 1939-2006. This imbalance between P3 and P2+P3 periods is also identified when 

comparing the temporal sequence in both time periods. In our opinion  it could be due to three factors: (i)  the deviation 

caused by data obtained  through inquiries in P2, which favours the collection of data from historically denser populated 

areas, (ii) the incompleteness of the P2 series, and (iii) the climate variability typical of this area, which makes atmospheric 

circulation to have different patterns at multiannual resolution, in relation to the relatively short time period analyzed in P3. 

We believe that a longer dataset would allow checking these results.

In spite of the fact that our most complete dataset (P3) covers from 1995-96 to 2013-14, 19 winters, and this is a short time  

interval, some trends can be pointed out which could be linked to the recent climate change. The number of MAE has  

increased in the second half of this period and at the same time, wet MAE, which register high MAAMIe values (figures 10  

and 11) are more frequent. We believe that the time interval is too short for obtaining solid conclusions, but the maintenance

of the MA surveillance, and an effort to complete the MA catalogue in P2 could provide very interesting information in  

relation to possible trends and its connection with climate change, as the results obtained by Eckert et al. (2010a, 2010b,  

2013), or Laternser and Schneebeli (2002).

6 Conclusions

The  work  with  cartographic  information  of  avalanche  data  series  allowed  to  better  quantify  and  characterize  major 

avalanche episodes  in space and time during the last 19 winters and improved the treatment of the avalanche data series of  

the twentieth century in the Pyrenees.

The proposed index, MAAMI (and its simplified version SMAAMI), is intended to categorize the magnitude of major 

avalanche episodes or winters. The time scale depends on the resolution of available data. It was developed to facilitate 

comparing episodes, obtaining frequencies, and if the series are long enough, to find trends on major avalanche activity.  

MAAMI obtained values at major avalanche episode time resolution showed a very high correlation coefficient with its  

corresponding deforested area.

The obtained results confirm 1995/96 winter as the one which recorded the highest MAAMI and SMAAMI values from the 

early twentieth century to the present (P2, from 1900 to 1995, and P3, from 1995 to 2014). It also identified 1937/38, 

1971/72, 1974/75, 2005/06 and 2004/05 as the winters with high SMAAMI values. Regarding the episodes (P3 period), 22-

23 January and 6-8 February 1996 registered the highest MAAMIe values, followed by  30-31 January 2003, 29  January 

2005, 29 January 2006, 18-19 February 2013 and 24-25 January 2014 episodes, with moderate values.

This index is useful for risk analysis in major avalanche events, both in forecasting and in crisis management. It can be used 

to define risk scenarios for civil protection purposes. Urban areas have been affected by avalanches with moderate to very 

high MAAMIe values, all of them by a N/NW atmospheric pattern. A better knowledge of these episodes would improve its 

temporal and spatial forecasting.

By employing this index, the former nivological regions were revised and new regions MANR were defined which better  

characterize major avalanche activity over the Catalan Pyrenees (from west to east: GA, PN, RP, PE, SN, SL and TF).

Among these regions, GA, PN and RP stand out for the highest number of major avalanche episodes, and RP and PN for the  

greatest MAAMIe values registered in P3. It is remarkable to note that region GA, despite being the area with the highest

snow precipitation of the Catalan Pyrenees, registers a similar number of episodes than its neighbouring regions RP and PN. 

Concerning both periods P2 and P3, GA is the region registering the highest number of major avalanche episodes. In the 

future, a larger dataset should be used to check these results.

Regarding period P2 there was a significant number of recorded major avalanches that could not be dated at enough time 

resolution to be dealt with in this paper. In the future, intensive efforts will be required to rebuild this part of the series and 

improve our knowledge. The completion of P2 would give more consistency to the dataset and would allow the use of more 

advanced data analysis methods such as those used by Eckert et al (2010), not applied in this work. We still can get more  

information, especially in the field by using dendrochronology. In the same way, the study of P1 (previous to 1900) should  

help us to better understand the situations that generate the lowest frequency avalanches, only recorded in this period, and  

be prepared for when they happen again.
