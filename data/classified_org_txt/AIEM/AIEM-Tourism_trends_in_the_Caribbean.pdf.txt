Tourism trends 

The purpose in diversifying the touristic offer of a country is mainly to have more visitors 

throughout the year, to get those tourists to come back and to gain international prestige. Also, 

being part of the Sustainable Tourism Zone of the Caribbean (STZC), which aims to take care 

of the ecosystem and promote a balanced development to the coutries, establish that this area is 

a unit of cultural and socioeconomic diversity and biological richness whose 

development depends on sustainable tourism and the principles of integration, cooperation and 

consensus, to facilitate the integrated development of the Greater Caribbean. 

 

Some of the new offers and touristic trends are: 

 

Tobacco and rum tourism.  

 

In La Romana, Dominican Republic, Tobaccos García Company shows visitors how they 

prepare handmade cigars with diverse tour types: Discovery tour, Aficionado Factory tour, 

Private Cigar tour and tasting, Cigar Masters tour and tasting and Cigar tasting basics.

Bonairean Golf Club in Bonaire, it´s a complete natural local environment, which means no 

grass grown fairways, sophisticated greens, but fairways with the spares local vegetation and 

"browns", existing from local soil, instead of greens. The objective is to keep the landscaping as 

natural as possible. 

 

 Sailing and Fishing 

 

The “Antigua Sailing Week” each April welcomes participants from all corners of the globe to 

compete for the chance to win this prestigious Regatta. 

 

Granada has an annual “Spiceisle Billfish Tournament” on a tag and release system just like in 

Cap Cana, Dominican Rpublic with participating boats from Puerto Rico. The two week-ends 

“Grenada Sailing Festival” also calls international attention with keelboats form the UK, USA, 

Europe, and with strong competition from local yachts from Grenada & the Caribbean Region. 

 

In the British Virgin Island sailing is very popular. The “Arriving by Sea” section of the official 

tourism website provides information on Marinas, Yacht Clubs, Ports of Entry, Moorings &

Real State tourism.   

 

Participating in international Real State tourism fairs or property shows, in which they offer 

targeted customers the opportunity to buy and invest in countries such as, Dominican Republic 

and Bonaire. The government gives information and facilities for purchasing a vacation or 

permanent home. Some international real estate agencies offer luxury properties in St. Barts 

Island as well. 

 

Ecotourism. 

 

This is an important new trend in the Caribbean countries; it is related to sustainable tourism 

because it promotes community involvement in tourism development by taking advantage of 

the mountains, rivers, culture and history.  

 

In Antigua & Barbuda there are some legislations regarding sustainable tourism for areas of: 

tourism management capacity; marketing; transportation; environment; linkages and health, 

safety and security.  Also, declaring new areas as nationals parks, like Green Castle Hill, Fort 

Barrington and Half Moon Bay.  

 

The “Antigua Rainforest Canopy Tour” is a unique eco-tour through Antigua's lush rainforest 

where you embark on a journey through the verdant forest, high above the trees. In Belize there 

is a canopy tour as well called “Ziplining” where you can soar above the jungle canopy 

traversing from one platform to another.

Bonaire has created a master plan to control the development of the island without harming its 

natural wonders. Currently Bonaire has a total of 5 Ramsar Sites
1
 on the island. Bonaire has a 

long history of marine preservation, beginning with turtle protection in 1961, prohibition of 

spear fishing in 1971 and protection of coral, dead or alive, in 1975. The island’s strategic goal 

is to become a sustainable destination, having a healthier environment, the plan is to have a 20% 

reduction of dumped waste, and also utilize more energy efficient methods. Bonaire is striving 

to become Carbon Neutral. The goal is to become a tourism destination that is in balance, 

identifying, measuring and reducing gas emissions (GHG), and 100 percent of the remaining

chocolate making in Punta Gorda, Belize. Also an abundance of national parks, private nature 

reserves and botanical gardens offer a range of rainforest activities for the quiet observer to the

Dominica has turned to eco-tourism because it lacks the geography that makes other Caribbean 

destinations atractive by advertising its natural, undeveloped beauty.  Local guides are involved 

in protecting one of the more popular tourist draws: nesting sea turtles. Specially trained local 

guides lead limited tours to the nesting areas so it has no interfere with the nesting process.

In Jamaica the Rural Economic Development Initiative (REDI) project is devolping with aims 

to involve local people in the planning of tourism activities. 

 

Martinique is rapidly emerging for green tourism, thanks especially to its volcanic north and a 

tropical forest that is unique to the region. The Route de la Trace is a genuine botanical circuit 

through the heart of this tropical forest that winds its way up Mount Pelee. Other routes are

(or other religions) in history.

town that led to the first evangelization of America. Also, the “Santuario del Santo Cerro” can 

be visited, in which Christopher Columbus sent to lay the first cross of America. 

  

In Anguilla there is a “Places of Worship” guide, with a list of churches for the predominant 

religious denominations, their address and timetable. 

 

Weddings 

 

The Caribbean has become a great destination for weddings. Its beautiful beaches have provided 

the setting for romantic destination weddings. There is much information available in the 

license procedure and costs, like in Anguilla or Antigua & Barbuda with its “Celebrity 

Destination Wedding” contest. 

 

The bridal registry in Aruba helps the bride’s friends and family select the perfect gift for the 

newlyweds. 

 

In Cayman Islands there is an interactive website called “Caiman Vows” to find a wedding 

style: chic, barefoot, private, elegant and grand, etc. According to the test result, there is a list of 

beaches, hotels and restaurants that matches the style. There are also underwater wedding 

services.

themes such as "Exotic Cave" to "Eco-Chic” weddings. 

 

Meetings 

 

There are many offers for hosting events in a variety of convention centers in the Caribbean.  

 

There are destination management companies that organize events, offering both 

accommodation and meeting facilities range from big to small, with a broad variety of meeting 

and conference facilities.  

 

“Welcome to the perfect blend of business and pleasure.” They state in Bermuda. Also, they 

have an online meeting planning form available. A “Meeting Guide” helps organizers in the 

details of an event. 

 

 
Figure 10 Convention Center. Puerto Rico 

Some other countries with large or small event facilities are: Guyana, Dominican Republic, 

Barbados, Jamaica, Martinique and Puerto Rico. 

 

Others 

 

There is an intent or initiative that within a year or two, nationals and residents of eight (8) 

Southern Caribbean tourist destinations (Grenada, Columbia, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, 

Columbia, and Trinidad and Tobago,) should be able to purchase one ticket and travel to all 

eight destinations. It will also enable them to choose between sailing from port to port aboard a 

cruise ship, fly to the next destination, or use a ferry.  

 

Five artisan villages will be constructed over the next five years in resort towns in Jamaica. The 

villages are envisaged as ‘one stop’ venues for authentic Jamaican food, music, heritage and 

craft, as it is believed the current craft market concept in Jamaica is inadequate toshowcase and 

sell the Jamaican experience to visitors. 

 

Puerto Rico's natural landscapes and picturesque cityscapes have provided the setting for many 

blockbuster Hollywood films and highly acclaimed television shows. Some sites are Arecibo 

Observatory, El Yunque, Palomino Island and Old San Juan. 

 

Conclusion 
 

As we can see, there are different trends in Caribbean tourism, the common intentions are to 

unify and consolidate the zone as a first class holiday destination market, highlighting the 



10 

 

natural resources of each island, protecting the environment and continue to improve services to 

increase growth.  

 

It is clear that each government should create laws and policies that promote these 

objectives and continue to participate in the institutions or organizations that perform 

and promote these changes.
