Abstract  
Architecture has been an essential resouce in retail to keep products in suitable technical conditions, 

provide confort to costumers during the purchase process, and set up a communication bond across 

the attraction process moves to trigger the purchase. The addition of more architecture in 

commercialization of products (stores, supply chains, etc.) has been an inherent fact to historical 

retail development in intensity and extent. However, a glance of the whole retail system in any city 

provide the verification of coexistence and development of many architectural typologies used for 

retailing, formed with dissimilar ammounts of resources (energy, material, information, technology), 

that entail different environmental impacts. 

 

Keywords: urban retail, environmental impact, retail architecture, input-output analysis. 

1. Introduction 

Simultaneously to growth of retail (1), the amount or architectural resources invested in 
product marketing also has rised, due to the increase in number and size of new models of 
shops: already in 2001, Harvard Design School quantified in about 2 billion m2 the total retail 
area around the world (2). Experts say this increase is linked to development of trade activity, 
which has been bent on rise the sales capacity and the range on demand. Mass use of 
production systems, considerable amplification of supply (saleable product units and number 
of references), rivalry and changes in life standards, cause that the amount of architecture 
used in commercialization of products increases gradually. However, in any city, urban retail 
is composed of a range of architectural typologies that require uneven amounts of resources, 
and consequently, involve different environmental impacts.  
 
The aim of this paper is to initiate in the identification of the impact associated to retail 
architecture considering in an environmental approach the resources that compound retail 
typologies (space available, structure, facades, building elements, furniture, energy, 
information), using as case study the city of Barcelona (Spain). Metodology includes a 
qualitative analysis of general issues of urban retail, and a quantitative analysis in which the 
amount of architecture used for retail in study cases is measured. Within the results obtained, 
it should be noted the development of a numeric model to assess the environmental efficiency 
of retail architecture (the relation between the obtained results (sales) and the resources 
employed (real estate investment)). Also, a ranking of retail architectural typologies is 
proposed, based in the simultaneous valuation of location, exploitation of urban pre-
existences and architectural intensity (relation between architectural resources and m2 
available for the development of retail activity).  
2. Achitectural diversity in urban retail: a living parallelism.

In the commercial system of Barcelona, it is posible to identify some peculiarities (fig. 1):

¿Why do exist different architectural formats that operate simultaneously in the same context, 
and even are used for the commercialization of the same product? To understand the 
guidelines that determine diversity of urban retail, it is plausible to compare with biological 
theories that explain the behaviour and the relation between natural species with the 
environment and among them, setting up a parallelism between retail as human system and an 
ecosystem: in ecosystem different organisms strive to survive in apparent balance, such as 
different retail “organisms” in the city attempt to pursuing the transaction (to produce 
commercial exchange to survive).  
 
● Diversity of shapes guarantee the response capacity of the system facing all possible (new 
and unexpected) context requestings (economic, environmental, social). The system could 
lose its response if the multiplicity of architectural formats decreases, that means, its 
complexity as a system. For example, comparing the retail systems of Barcelona and Kaolak 
(Senegal) it can be observed that the Barcelona system is more diverse architecturally tan 
Kaolak’s. However, this is reciprocal with the range of possible context requestings, but it 
would be totally unstable and improbable in Barcelona, because the complexity and diversity 
of its context requestings is considerably bigger (seasons, global products commersialisation, 
health and security regulations, etc). 
 
● Like a biological organism, it could be assured that an architectural typology used in retail 
progress to gain independence facing uncertainty, and improve its capacity of response to 
challenges progressively bigger. Therefore, some tipologies have progressed more tan others. 
Even functionally they are good for sheltering the comercial activity, they don’t have or don’t 
require the same capacity of response facing the same challenge (image 1).  
 
 

 
● In the same city coexist different 
retail architectural typologies, despite 
environmental and socioeconomic 
requirements are the same.  

 
Some of architectural typologies found in 

Barcelona 
 
 
 
 
● Even some “ancient” architectural 
typologies remain in the city 
nowadays, because despite 
socioeconomic evolution still they are 
proficient to commercialize.

● It is posible to find simultaneously the offering of the same product using different achitectural 
typologies, despite the functional requirements are the same for all of them.

● Natural selection is a filter that allows innovations favouring the independence of the 
organism facing context uncertainty. More complexity would guarantee more possibilities of 
survival. However, not in all cases the adaptation capacity of an architectural format for 
retailing is directly proportional to the amount of architectural resources, since this capacity 
depends on the selective pressures produced by any aspect of the environment. Like a natural 
system, complex organisms adapts easier to different variable conditions, but simple solutions 
also survive facing the different selective pressures (image 2).  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

3. The role of achitecture in urban retail.  

 

To understand the environmental impact associated to retail architecture, it is necessary to 
define the role or architecture in the commercialization process, from the identification and of 
different architectural typologies of retail premises (PS) in urban retail system (3). Typologies 
founded in Barcelona have been classified according to location, the use of urban pre-
existences, and the real estate investment (figure 2):   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In every typology it is posible to identify two main categories of functional requirements:

Shelter: minimum technical conditions that architecture should provide to allow the storage 
and exhibition of products and procure suitable conditions to commercial exchange (Table 1): 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Communication: PS increasingly assumes the function of communicación platform between 
manufacturer and buyer. Through space compositional elements (Lighting, colors, materials, 
sounds, etc), PS attracts, persuades, seduces and convinces the buyer with the purpose of 
unleash the emotional process of purchase decision. 
 
Architecture is a fundamental resource to respond to urban requestings (environmental, social, 
functional, regulations), allowing at the same time the development of commercial activity. 
All architectural typologies, regardless the amount of resources employed, should guarantee a 
mínimum of shelter and communication conditions to make possible the commercialization of 
products. Even in typologies with low architectural intensity, pre-existing urban resources are 
used (lighting, streets, paraments) to shelter the commercialization process, always with 
complementary elements to guarantee mínimum conditions. The investment of more 
architectural resources in PS (or a higher level or architectural response) allows to afford a 
more accurated responsiveness facing posible context requiements, satisfying at the same time 
additional needs in the commercialization process like storage and custody of products, 
attractive and suggestive exhibition of products, supplementary services, bigger isochronals, 
etc (image 3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

4. Assessment method. 

4.1 Background 

- Preservation: protection of the product facing external factors that could modify their basic qualities 
(colour, texture, freshness, shape, etc). 
- Storage: stock availability to guarantee the satisfaction of demand fast and efficiently  
- Healthiness: exhibition and storage of products in hygienic conditions. This may vary according to the 
product and the socioeconomic context. 
- Safekeeping: protection against theft.   
 

- Environmental control: environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) to commercialize 
comfortably.  
- Lighting: To guarantee general lighting conditions and to enhance the product.  
- Support: exhibition of products in a correct and suggestive way.  
- Form of sale: to provide the link between client and merchant acording to the form of sale 
(personalized sale, self service, serve-over, etc). 
- Simultanously offer: to benefit the offer of different products in suitable conditions. 
- Security, regulations compliance: to guarantee mínimum conditions of security according to local 
regulations (evacuation, fire, etc).

Efficiency is the ability to obtain the planned objectives with sufficiency in the use of 
available resources. Considering architecture like material “input”, The MIPS method 
(Material Input per Service Unit) (4) enables to quantify the amount of material resources 
used during the life cycle of a product, including the resources needed to obtain the benefits 
of its use (5). P. Sinivuori (6) employed this method to assess two universitary buildings, 
defining that the service unit of a building is the net useful area during a determined period 
of time (S = m2/years). An assessment of the materials invested in every building is done, 
obtaining a MIPS value in Kg resources/ net m2/year (a value linked not only to m2 available, 
but also to useful life of the building). Similar approach is the methodology proposed by 
Albert Cuchí Burgos, P.h.D in the document “Informe MIES: Una aproximació a l’impacte 
ambiental de l’Escola d’Arquitectura del Vallés”(7): the environmental impact of the school 
of architecture is assessed, quantifying its energy cost during construction and useful life 
(energy needed to perform the school activities: lighting, HVAC, services, etc; in CO2/year). 
This energy assessment is divided by m2 and the amount of university credits by year.  
 
4.2 Assessment method proposal. 

Architectural Efficiency (AE), is the relation between a functional unit (turnover, business 
hours, satisfaction of shelter and communication requirements), and the amount of 
architectural resources employed in a PS to obtain those results [1]. The Architectural 
Intensity (AI) is the amount of architectural resources employed in a PS related to a 
functional unit S (m2 available to the development of commercial activity) [2]. 

 

 

 
Considering architecture as a single resource, three units are defined to assess it like an input:    
 
4.2.1 Material: consists of two measurable and noticeable elements:  
A. Surface area: the space available to shelter an activity can be measured in m2. In this case 
is evaluated only the surface of public access, named sales room (SR). This includes the space 
for exhibition and fitting of products, the payment area, information and customer services. 
B. Weight: the space available for commercialization of products and its architectural fence 
are made of elements that weight and are measurable. Considering the useful life of each one 
of these elements (with their simultaneous service to another uses of the building), the 
intensity is determined in Kg/m2/year [3].  
 

 

 

4.2.2 Energy: is used in retail spaces for climate control, to emphasize products, to create 
determined environments through lighting, sounds and images, to use the different appliances 
(payment systems, conservation and measurement, etc).  
 
Through architecture energy flows are canalized. Therefore, the energy consumption of a PS 
is due not only to the fuctional needs of the commersialization process, but also to the 
elements and architectural features in SR. Then energy AI is determined in kWh/m2/year, 
that is the amount of enegy needed for the development of comercial activity in a PS.   

AE = Obtained results (turnover, business hours, etc.) 
            Used resources  (AI: m2, kg/m2year, kWh/m2year, complexity)

4.2.3 Complexity: architecture also is information. In PS architectural resources have an 
arrangement and an order that allow the satisfaction of shelter and communication in a 
specific manner. The level of complexity in a PS is its potential behavior diversity; and retail 
architectural fomats will become more complex to increase their shelter and 
communication capacity. 

 
To identify the complexity level of a PS a valuation scale is settled, considering possible 
shetler and communication requiements. Thus, to every architectural tipology a level of 
complexity is determined considering a predominant functional criterion (shelter or 
communication), which compliance most of the architectural resources are intended.  
 
This methodology has been applied in a sample of architectural typologies of PS detected in a 
working área of 1,00 km2, intended for commercialization of two categories of products: 
bread (easy purchase decision/ usual purchase/low price); and women apparel (careful 
purchase decision/occasionally purchase/moderate price):

to establish the profitability in a PS, through the relation between the resources employed and 
the obtained benefits. To evaluate the retail activity from an environmental scope, it is 
possible to define a similar equation, in terms of the amount of resources used to 
commercialize certain quantity of products, and the obtained results (transactions).   
 
- In terms of architectural resources, it is possible to stablish a method similar to 
inputs/outputs balance, where the amount or architectural resources employed to create 
commercial premises is measured. The viability of setting up this relation is supported with 
the huge architectural diversity of PS identified in the city: this reality proves that the same 
product could be commercialized in the same socioeconomic context using PS with different 
architectural intensities.  
 
- The three measurement units proposed allow an architectural valuation in different 
dimensions: space available, material resources, energy consumption during useful life, 
information. From the Architectural Intensity (AI) it would be possible to outline, like others 
architectural uses (ie offices or educational buildings), some reference values to set up 
boundaries between sufficiency and over-measurement in the use of architectural resources.   
 
- With the suggested method it is posible to assess architecture like a whole resource. 
However, architecture is also the result of a construction process, Then to propose a more 
accurate environmental assessment method, it is necessary to consider also material features 
and the consumption of resources in different construction process.     
 
- Considering that most of the retail premises in the city are located in existing buildings, in 
the environmental assessment of the elements that compound the SR would be a broader 
scope. Therefore, it would be possible to suggest a supplementary assessment method in 
which the most suitable architectural tipology is identified first, from the comparison of AI 
between options; and then to implement a more accurate study where environmental impact 
consequence of use of resources in conceptualization and useful life of PS is identified.

Abstract: Today, there is an obvious lack of sufficient integration of daylight in building 

design. The literature has been reviewed in order to see if knowledge exists to formulate an 

improved daylight design methodology which may be consistently integrated with thermal 

comfort and energy use design. Based on findings in the literature, a proposal is given on how 

daylight calculations and evaluations may be implemented throughout the building design. 

Important features in the proposed design are: early implementation of simulation tools, 

implementation of climate-based daylight modelling, and coupling between simulation tools 

for daylight, thermal comfort and energy use to ensure consistency in the design. The design 

proposal has been tested and the results show that the method might lead to a design with 

satisfying indoor environment and low energy use. Yet, more research is needed to validate 

and to set proper benchmark values for newly proposed climate-based daylight metrics.  

Key words:  daylight metrics, daylight prediction, discomfort glare, integrated design  

Introduction 

It may be a climatic challenge to design buildings with low energy use and high indoor 
environmental performance. Figure 1 illustrates how daylight, thermal comfort and energy 
aspects influence each other in a complex manner. There is a need for an integrated and 
consistent design approach to daylight, thermal comfort and energy use in order to be able to 
fulfil future energy and comfort demands.

At the present time, simulation tools are used, which makes it possible to evaluate both 
thermal comfort and energy use at the same time, yet there is an obvious lack of sufficient 
integration of daylight [1]. Daylight is an essential component within buildings both with its 
architectonic and aesthetic features and with is functional aspects. With regard to the latter, an 
effective daylight design combined with intelligent control for artificial lighting might lead to 
reduction of energy use for lighting and cooling, especially for commercial buildings where 
the occupied period usually coincides with periods of excessive access to daylight. 
Additionally, it is important to remember that daylight has positive health effects [2], and that 
occupants usually prefer daylight as their source of illumination [3]. These last features might 
actually be the most vital arguments for investing time an effort in daylight design. 

However, several surveys conducted among building designers and researchers [4-6] revail 
that far from all conduct daylight analysis during their design. The aim of the present paper is 
to propose how daylight design may be implemented throughout the design of commercial 
buildings as an integrated part of the building design. The literature has been consulted in 
order to see if there is existing knowledge to formulate a three step design methodology for 
integrated daylight design. The following sections present the results from the literature 
review followed by a test of the proposed design methodology.  

Literature review of daylight design 

With respect to an integrated design, criteria for daylight may be used to assess if the daylight 
environment is satisfying, if artificial lighting needs to be added or if there is risk of glare and 
need for activation of solar shading. 

Is the daylight satisfying or do artificial light need to be added? 
The daylight factor (DF) has existed since the beginning of the 20th century [7], it is used as a 
measure for satisfying daylight and  is currently the most commonly used daylight metric 
worldwide [8, 9]. The daylight factor is defined as the ratio between the internal illuminance 
at a point in a room and the unshaded, external horizontal illuminance under a Commission 
Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) overcast sky [9].  

As an isolated measure, the DF does not contribute with much information regarding the real 
daylight level in a room as it only considers the static CIE overcast condition. Under these 
conditions there might e.g. not be need for use of solar shading, which may explain why use 
of solar shading commonly is neglected in daylight design [10]. Yet, it is well known that 
solar shading is indispensable for office workers to control solar gain and glare and its use 
influence daylight supply, thermal comfort and energy use. Further limitations of DF are 
widely discussed elsewhere [9, 11], and one thing seems certain: new climate-based daylight 
metrics (CBDm) should be used in the future as criteria for annual daylight, a selecton of 
CBDm are presented in Table 1.  

The question is then which CBDm to use? UDI and sDA300/50% might be preferable to use 
since they are developed based on occupant preferences in daylight environments. One 
advantage of sDA300/50% is that the annual daylight level in the room can be expressed with 



 

10 

 

one single number and according to the Illuminanting Engineering Society of North America 
(IES), sDA300/50% ≥55 % has to be met in order for a space to be nominally acceptable daylit. 
sDA300/50% has been accepted as daylight metric by the IES as part of an methodology for 
evaluating annual daylight [12]. However, from an integrated design perspective, UDI seems 
to give more interdisciplinary information. The UDI concept is divided into four categories 
[13]; UDI_fell short (UDI-f, 0-100 lux) indicate the time when required illuminance has to be 
maintained by artificial lighting, UDI_supplementary (UDI-s, 100-300 lux) indicate the time 
when artificial lighting needs to be added to the daylight to maintain required illuminance, 
UDI_autonomous (UDI-a, 300-3000 lux) indicate the time when the light level can be 
obtained by daylight alone and UDI exceeded (UDI-e, 3000 lux<) is associated with glare or 
overheating and indicate the time when solar shading might be needed. It might be a 
reasonable assumption that the IES threshold for satisfying daylight area of 55 % can be 
adopted for the UDI-a category as well.

Is there risk of glare? 
Nowadays, extensive use of computers in the working environment has become common. 
Consequently, the line of sight is more horizontal than for reading and handwriting tasks on 
the desk, which makes discomfort glare from windows a more considerable concern [17]. 
Discomfort glare produces discomfort without necessarily influencing visual performance and 
visibility and still there is a lack of knowledge about its underlying process [17].   

At the present time there is no international accepted measure to evaluate the discomfort glare 
from windows and/or solar shadings. However, there are recommendations given in the 
literature [18, 19] towards use of the newly developed metric Daylight Glare Probability 
(DGP) [20]. One major drawback is that it might be very time-consuming to carry out an 
annual DGP analysis. In order to address this problem, Weinold [21] has developed and 
validated two simplified versions of DGP; (1) DGP simplified (DGPs) based on vertical eye 
illuminance and (2) enhanced simplified DGP based on vertical illiminance at eye in 
combination with a simplified image. The validation showed in general good results for the 
enhanced simplified DGP and reasonable results were seen for DGPs when no peak glare 
sources where present. In a design process, a glare analysis might be most suitable for the 
detailed design stage, both because the annual glare analysis is rather time-consuming and 
because glare is direction dependent and should be carried out at probable work stations.

Calculation procedure 
Early implementation of simulation tools are indispensable in order to make annual 
evaluations of horizontal illuminane and glare. Simulation tools based on validated and 
effective calculation engines should be used. Yet, it will be almost impossible at the present 
time to totally avoid the use of rules of thumbs and simple static calculations in the early 
design phase to make the first design proposal. Studies have shown that not all earlier 
published rules of thumb may be trustworthy or suitable for todays building design [11]. It is 
therefore important to use validated methods which yield reasonable results. Reinhart and 
LoVerso [11] have suggested a validated sequence of rule of thumb to come up with the first 
daylight scheme for sidelit rooms. This sequence is based on the DF, with all its limitations, 
and do therefore only consider the diffuse daylight. Further into the design, yet still early 
design phase, it will be necessary to implement use of simulation tools in daylight design in 
order to carry out climate-based modelling and reach a more integrated design approach. 

Design proposal 

Table 4 compresses a preliminary proposal for a daylight design in three levels of detail based 
on findings in the literature. Important features of the proposal are early implementation of 
simulation tools and adoption of climate-based daylight modelling from an early stage, which 
straightens integration with thermal comfort and energy analysis.

building design based on findings in the literature.

Use the validated rule of thumb sequence proposed by Reinhart and LoVerso [11] to draw up the first 
daylight scheem to find minimum required glazing areas; -initial assumtions regarding wall thickness, 
window head height, room width (w), mean surface reflectance (Rmean) and visual light transmittance (τvis) 
of the glazing have to be made. Use an effective simulation tool to check that the glazed areas are 
consistent with annual daylight requirements for UDI-a as well as for thermal comfort and energy use.

Use a climate-based daylight simulation tool to verify the chosen glazed areas and glazing characteristics 
when use of solar shading is accounted for. In case of dynamic solar shading, use a simplified solar 
shading model and utilize UDI-e (3000 lux) as a threshold for activation of solar shading due to glare/ 
overheating. Exchange solar shading, lighting and occupancy profiles between daylight, thermal comfort 
and energy use predictive tools in order to achieve a model consistency for the integrated design.

Test of design proposal 

The design sequence is tested in design of a sidelit cellular office located in Oslo, Norway. It 
is assumed that the wall thickness is 500 mm (U-value= 0.10 W/Km2) and that the glazing is 
placed in the middle of the wall, which gives an obstruction to the sky angle (�) of 
approximately 10˚. Following room dimintions are set; floor to ceiling height = 2.75 m, 
window head height = 2.7 m and room width = 2.75 m. A glazing is selected with the 
characteristics; U-value=0.6 W/Km2, g-value=0.49, direct solar tranmission=0.41 and visual 
light transmission = 0.71. Internal gains and values for heating, cooling and ventilation are set 
according to the Norwegian standard NS3701[22]. Table 3 gives the requirements set for 
indoor environment and energy use and Table 4 shows the results from the different steps of 
the design. Daysim [23]  is utilised for the daylight analysis and IDA ICE [24] is used for the 
thermal and energy analysis.

The initial design proposal satisfy the requirements for daylight, thermal comfort and energy use and is an acceptable design 

to develop further.Influence of consistent solar shading and lightig control will be evaluated in the following design stages.

A simplified model of dynamic solar shading is used in the daylight calculation 

which block all direct sunlight and transmitt 25% of the diffuse daylight.

•••• Cooling demand             3 kWh/m2 year 

The daylight does not satisfy the requireent completely. Yet, the simplified solar shading model might underestimate the 

daylight supply when closed and it will therefore be tested in if a more sofisticated solar shading might increase the area of 

satisfying daylight. If not, glazing characteristics or glazing area should be revised.

It will be tested how a light grey external venetian blind system with a cut-off control strategy will influence the daylight, 

thermal comfort and the energy use. The solar shading is activated if external vertical irradiance>150 W/m

 AND indoor air 

temperature> 24.5˚C OR if vertical illuminance>2000 lux at a sensor placed at the east wall behind the occupant work 

station at a height at 1.2 m. Since a cut-off strategy is used for the solar shading it is expected that peak glare sources will 

not be dominant and annual glare is evaluated according to DGPs.

Discussion and conclusion 

The literature reveals that a significant amount of research is conducted within the field of 
daylight during the last decades. To obtain an integrated design it is essential to use the same 
underlying calculation assumptions of climate data and control strategies for solar shading 
and lighting in thermal comfort, daylight and energy use analysis. Based on findings in the 
literature a proposal is given of how daylight evaluations may be implemented throughout the 
building design. The design proposal has been tested in design of a cellular office located in 
Oslo, Norway and the results shows that the methodology might lead to a design with 
satisfying visual and thermal environment and low energy use. It is expected that use of the 
method might have implications on design of facades and room layout since e.g. problems of 
glare in rooms with large glazed facades or problems with insufficient daylight illuminance in 
the core of deep rooms might be discovered in an early design stage and poorly designed 
proposals might be reconsidered. In order for the proposed design method to be practical 
applicable for building designers, it needs to be implemented in a user-friendly integrated 
simulation tool. Additionally, more studies are needed to confirm the suitability of UDI and 
DGPs/enhaced simplified DGP as a future annual daylight and glare metrics.

Introduction 

The way we live is intimately connected with the way we buy. The supply of goods is linked 
to quality of life and needs a rethinking in order to be able meet the challenges of climate 
change mitigation. An analysis of existing European retail developments and their impact on 
local energy consumption is therefore needed. New procurement measures are necessary in 
order to be able to develop business models for the building and infrastructure industry that 
allows a cost effective transition of our built environment. In a larger research project which 
focuses on shopping centres, aspects regarding “sustainability” will be defined and analyzed 
taking into account buildings as social arenas, venues for experience, their interaction with the 
surrounding infrastructure, and their urban integration or interaction with the local built 
environment. These aspects are often described as “socio-cultural and functional aspects” 
within e.g. building certification schemes and methodologies that address the sustainability 
assessment of buildings. The goal was therefore to define such socio-cultural and functional 
aspects and to derive performance indicators to be analysed with respect to shopping centres. 

Objectives 

In this paper we seek for a definition and analysis of socio-cultural and functional aspects to 
be considered for shopping centres, including:  

(i) definition of typical shopping mall functional patterns  

(ii) analysis of the interactions between the stakeholders,  



 

16 

 

(iii) studying inefficiencies related to the functional pattern,  

(iv) development of key performance indicators for energy efficient interaction in and 
operation of shopping mall. 

Methodology 

A cross methodological approach has been used including questionnaires that were sent to 
owners and managers, tenants and customers of shopping centres in 5 different countries in 
Europe (Eu-28 plus Norway), site visits and interviews. The assessment was done by applying 
the framework for the assessment of environmental, social and economic performance 
(EN15643). 

In order to assess the energy inefficiencies in a systematic and transparent way the 
sustainability criteria and indicators developed in the EU FP7 research project OPEN 
HOUSE1 (“Benchmarking and mainstreaming building sustainability in the EU based on 
transparency and openness (open source and availability) from model to implementation”) 
served as a structural basis. In a next step these sustainability criteria and indicators were 
investigated in terms of relation to energetic aspects. Therefore not only criteria with direct 
energetic context (e.g. energy needed for heating purpose in criteria “2.3 Thermal Comfort”) 
were followed up, but also criteria with indirect energetic context (see Image 1).  

 

Image 1: Process of identifying possible energetic inefficiencies related to different sustainability criteria and 

indicators 

Indirect energetic context can be the case if criteria specifying the use of specific equipment 
that needs energy in a second step (e.g. escalators in the criteria “2.1 Barrier-free

Accessibility”). In addition the term “energy” was not only understood as useable energy (e.g. 
electricity), but also as energy embodied in materials. After this the in literature (DGNB, 
2012), (Grey, 2005), (Homolka, 2012), (Homolka, 2013), (Shhada, 2011), (Striebich, 2011), 
(Warrington, 2001) and by the help of experts identified potential energey inefficiencies were 
classified according to this criteria, set in relation to the place of appearance (e.g. field 
between tenant – landlord) and described into detail. 

Results 

Typical functional pattern can be defined as aspects establishing a framework to understand 
the activities within the shopping centre and its relationship with the surrounding environment 
both on a day to day basis as well as over the various time of the year. The definition of 
functional patterns helps in providing a basis for understanding of general use and the 
shopping centre as a social arena; it is not specifically related to energy efficiency or 
sustainability issues. To achieve a useful definition which may be used in relation to the 
majority of users involved in shopping centres it is suggested here that typical functional 
patterns for four main user groups should be defined. These are:  

• customers 

• tenants 

• managers  

• community 

The stakeholders are influenced differently by the shopping centre: the customers are more 
interested in pleasant place and atmosphere, good shops, services and entertainment; they are 
also interested in comfortable indoor climate. Tenants and owners are more interested in 
reducing overheads and energy consumption. Their interests are more functional because 
management needs and their aim to achieve or improve profit margins. The needs of the four 
stakeholders influence the development, planning, design and location of shopping centres. 
Shopping entails different meanings for different consumer groups. Shoppers include all 
social groups and age ranges (Coleman). The functional patterns entail how to get the 
commodities as fast as possible, as smart and comfortable as possible or make use of 
shopping as a leisure activity. Shopping centres aim to encourage customers to spend more 
time in the shopping centres, and this is done by providing opportunities to do more than just 
shop. This is leading to improved architectural quality, with the creation of common spaces 
which are increasingly large and pleasant, and with introduction of more aesthetic elements 
which are not just about a more efficient business, but are intended to create a pleasant 
atmosphere (Malaspina, 2008). 

Three of the four stakeholder groups were asked and answers are presented in Table 1. It can 
be seen that among the three stakeholders there is a large difference in range of importance 
when looking at inefficiencies in shopping centres. While customers rate the location, the 
wide range of products, the low prices and free car paring as most important, tenants 
answered customer satisfaction, Thermal comfort/indoor quality, worker satisfaction and cost

as most important. Managers of shopping centres rated reduced energy demand, customer 
satisfaction, architectural quality and improved orientation as most important.

Table 1 also indicates the least important items. It shows that customers rated energy 
efficiency, access to battery charging for electric cars, architecture and green building 
certificate least important. Tenants rated Green leases, Entertainment, Acoustic comfort and 
Improved orientation in the centre least important while managers rated Energy efficient 
storage and loading areas, more meeting places, more parking space and acoustic comfort as 
least important. As a result of the previous described method for identifying energetic 
inefficiencies a list was set-up including sustainability criteria of buildings and potential 
energetic inefficiencies related to different stakeholder (see Image 2). 

 

Image 2: Excerpt of the full list of potential energetic inefficiencies 

Common findings of this analysis were that most of the energetic inefficiencies occur due to 
inefficient communication between the stakeholders and the installation of technical 

 

2.4 Indoor Air Quality 
 

Landlord – Tenants/Costumers: 
 

Tenants/costumers needs regarding indoor air quality are often not considered by landlords 
although it is very important for tenants/customers. 
=> Over-/underestimation (e.g. open door policy vs. heating/cooling) and choice of inaccurate 
technical equipment 
=> Ventilation rates are not defined by tenants 
 

Landlord – Municipal Authorities: 
 

Installations in shopping centers according to standards. 
=> ventilation rates according to standards and not regarding local and regional characteristics  
 

Tenants/Costumers – Municipal Authorities: 
 

Tenants /costumers needs are not matching national or local standards and are therefore not 
considered (e.g. standard ventilation rates vs. ventilation rates adapted to CO2 level or number of 
persons).

equipment not attuned to the specific circumstances and needs but to general standard 
technical design, that includes high safety margins due to high uncertainties. As a potential 
solution a integral planning team including all stakeholders could be established in order to 
match design and actual needs. In addition the whole lifecycle of the building should be 
included in the planning in order to avoid shifting problems from production to operation or 
even End-of-Life. 

The development of key performance indicators for energy efficient interaction in and 
operation of shopping malls came to the following elements: 

- Project briefings 

• project's intended approach 

• guidelines which the design and construction teams will seek to implement in design 

• strategies which the design and construction teams will seek to implement in design 

- Integrated Planning 

• Multidisciplinary formation of the planning team 
o A Sustainability Consultant 
o a Construction Manager or General Contractor with at least 3 more integrated 

project team members 
o at least 2 appropriate stakeholders (e.g representative of the owner and future 

users) in at least 3 phases of project design and construction process. 

• Qualification of the Integrated Project Team 
o members in architectural and engineering chambers or other qualified 

chambers or associations 
o demonstrate further education with focus on sustainability. 

• Design Charrette / Preparation of consultation 
o At least 2 full-day (resp. 4 half-day) or more workshops with the integrated 

project team 
o at least 3 appropriate stakeholders PLUS the owner/owner's representative 

• Integrated planning process 
o Meetings with the integrated project team at least twice per month or more 

often 

• Participation of future building users and other relevant stakeholders /Community 
impact consultation  

o Participation, consultative involvement, and a co-determination of the users 
and other relevant stakeholders took place. 

o The public were involved,  informed and consulted, and they could participate 

- Handover & Documentation 

• Handover & Documentation

o Training on operating the building efficiently is given to BOTH technical staff 
(facilities managers) and non-technical end users, covering all environmental 
strategies (lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling) 

o A plain-language, illustrated user manual is compiled, including 
recommendations and information for users to minimize ecological footprint, 
covering all environmental strategies (lighting, ventilation, heating and 
cooling) 

o Detailed instructions for maintenance, inspection, operation, and care are 
compiled and a maintenance and repairs plan was drawn up; these instructions 
are specified for individual target groups (facility manager, etc.) 

• Building Performance Improvement 
o The building has can evidence a reduction in energy and water consumption, 

and waste production over the years. 
o The building has achieved both ISO50001 and ISO14001 
o At least three organisations from the delivery team (architect, consultants, 

builders, subcontractors or client) can demonstrate that feedback from 
monitoring and evaluation has been communicated to their staff 

The following energy related key performance indicators are the most used ones already: 

- MJ Primary Energy Consumption (Operation)/ m²/year (if possible divided into 
heating/cooling/lighting/ etc.) 

- MJ Primary Energy Non-renewable (Operation)/m²/year (if possible divided into 
heating/cooling/lighting/ etc.) 

- average energy efficiency class of the building equipment 

A key to successful application of the proposed key performance indicators is the use during 
the whole design process from project briefing to commissioning and beyond. 

Conclusions 

The evaluation of the questionnaires for customers, tenants and management/owner show 
some contradictory results. Therefore it is very difficult to take these into account concerning 
the aspect of energy inefficiencies.  

Nevertheless the results of the questionnaires indicate a high interest concerning energy 
efficiency both on side of customers and tenants and their willingness to introduce e.g. energy 
efficient heating system, cooling system etc. 

The development of key performance indicators for energy efficient interaction in and 
operation of shopping malls showed elements that need further analysis. A test of the key 
performance indicators in a real building project is planned for next year. This will give more 
information about applicability af the key performance indicators.

All in all, there are some social-cultural and functional aspects that can result in energy 
inefficiencies. Most of these aspects can be improved through good cooperation between 
landlords, tenants/ costumers and municipal authorities. Therefore already in early planning 
stages of refurbishment projects the important pre-studies have to be performed (economic 
studies related to kind of costumers and their expectations, energetic studies, studies regarding 
the infrastructure, etc.). These studies can serve as a basis for design and refurbishment 
decisions. The developed methodology enables an assessment of shopping centres and 
possible refurbishment measures regarding sustainability.

Abstract: This article summarizes the first phase of the environmental assessment of the Convention 

Centre Europe (PEV-G) in Vitoria-Gasteiz (01), as a part of a wider renovation and expansion 

project. The Green Building Council Spain (GBCe) in collaboration with Societat Orgànica (SO) (02) 

proposed a methodology and actions for an ongoing process of environmental improvement for the 

building, analyzing its activities and the behavior of occupants and maintenance team, between 

January 2011 and September 2013. Through different models we have studied the existing building 

and the extension and renovation scenarios using the methodology of a simplified life cycle analysis 

and considering the environmental vectors energy, water, materials and waste. Options for 

improvement have been identified considering passive solutions, active solutions and management of 

the building, thus environmental objective were established. Finally, the requirements of the tender for 

final project and construction have been drafted, as well as an environmental protocol for the not yet 

executed phases. This protocol is valid for other buildings in Vitoria-Gasteiz, the Basque Country and 

all of Spain, to be renovated in the near future. 

Renovation, refurbishment, methodology, LCA, energy efficiency  

1. Project approach 

The PEV-G (Figure 1) will be renovated and extended to reach an operational capacity of 2.5 
times compared to the current. The conference and reunion south wing (on the right of the 
plan) will be refurbished without change of use, the north wing (on the left of the plan) will be 
renovated changing its use from sports into exhibition activities, and a large audience hall will 
be added to the center wing.

The complexity of developing a process of reducing environmental impacts throughout the 
renovation and extension of the building requires to consider how to interact with multiple 
factors: the deadlines set by the city council, the phases determined between them, the 
environmental work to be developed in each of these phases and the stakeholders involved 
before, during and after the process; all has to be integrated into a work plan (Figure 2). 

 
Communication actions aimed at raising awareness of the transformation of the PEV-G in the 
community of Vitoria-Gasteiz, take place throughout the process, particularly on website (04). 

2. Vision and environmental goals 

The renovation and extension of the PEV-G had to define a strategy in order to obtain 
habitability and comfort at a reasonable cost of resources, maximizing the opportunities 
offered by the site, the building configuration, and its materials and several technical 
resources and facilities available. The work that has been carried out determined strategies 
and actions for the renovation, extension and operation that the PEV-G building had to 
implement  in order to minimize its current environmental impacts and achieve the best 
possible standards of environmental quality considering the life cycle, and the energy 
efficiency in the operational phase. For this purpose it is intended to influence both the 
redesign of the building and its operation, as well as the integral management of the congress 
activity. In this regard, it is expected that the future offer of congresses and exhibitions of the 
PEV-G will be different from other regional alternatives because of its low ecological and/or 
carbon footprint (05) performing these operations, according to Vitoria-Gasteiz’s role as 
European Green Capital (06). 
The following main environmental indicators have been used and will be used throughout the 
entire process: the consumption of energy, water and materials and the generation of solid 
waste and CO2 emissions in a life cycle of 50 years, focusing especially in the renovation and 
extension phases and operation, being these the phases with the highest environmental 
impacts over the life cycle of the building (07). Environmental goals to be met along the

process of renovation, extension and building operation objectives have been defined: the 
building must achieve the highest level of the energy certification (RD 235/2013), at least 
70% of the highest level in voluntary certification tools for environmental quality (VERDE-
GBCe Tool and the Sustainable Building Guides IHOBE) and compliance with the 
prescriptive values of energy efficiency standard (PassivHaus, commercial buildings). 
The content and sequence of the environmental work can be summarized as follows: a) 
defining a methodology for environmental renovation and extension of the PEV-G as a 
reference basis for other similar processes in other public and private buildings, b) the 
greening of specifications of the general process, competition and tender as well as drafting 
an environmental manual of building use and maintenance, c) establishing the current level of 
the environmental impact of the PEV-G and defining strategies and improvement actions to 
be applied in the renovation, extension and use, assessing their environmental and economic 
impact, d) determining the level of environmental impact of the building once reopened and 
compare with the objectives. Defining environmental requirements to be met in the planning 
stages, construction and commissioning, e) communication actions throughout the 
environmental consulting f) provide with environmental training the manager of the building, 
its technicians and users, so they can behave appropriately in the operational phase. 

3.  Methodology of analysis, improvement, tracking and certification 

The methodology that would allow a comprehensive assessment of the environmental impact 
of buildings is the life cycle analysis (LCA) (08). However, its application in buildings is rare 
(09), due to its complexity. Addressing these problems and with the intention of creating a 
simplified methodology, but capable of performing a complete and replicable evaluation in 
other projects, a simplified LCA, useful for the assessment of trends of environmental impacts 
- not for highly accurate data – of the PEV-G, was implement. A simplified LCA permits a 
shorter completion time of the analysis’, lower amounts of information to represent the life 
cycle and, eventually, lower economic costs because much of the work can be carried out with 
tools and information sources freely available or at least at a low cost (Figure 3).

Using this simplified LCA, different constructive, HVAC and building management options, 
defined by considering the existing building and the preliminary design, were compared. The 



 

25 

 

work developed can be summarized as: 1) collection and study of building information. Plans, 
building systems, HVAC systems, consumption, use profile, climate, etc., 2) implementation 
of a computerized listing of its environmental impacts (energy, CO2, water, waste, etc..) 
through its modeling, 3) determination of impact reduction options for renovation and use, 
with technical, economic and management assessment, 4) reprocessing computerized listing 
of the impacts of the proposed optimized building and verification of the compliance with 
environmental objectives 5) definition of performance (levels of consumption, emissions, 
etc.., according to comfort and habitability conditions) and prescriptive (minimum quality of 
construction systems and facilities) requirements to comply. Drafting of the environmental 
specifications of the project and construction process. 

4. Existing building evaluation 

Once all available information about the building was collected and analyzed (plans, reports, 
usage statistics, usage profiles are facilities, visits, interviews with technicians, thermographic 
evaluation, etc...) the environmental vectors of energy, water, materials and waste of the 
building were modeled (Figure 5) in order to determine their current levels of impact, 
contrasting them with the regulatory requirements and benchmarks from other similar 
buildings and determining the causes of the greatest impact. 

 Analysis conducted Main problems detected 
Energy 

and CO2 

Annual consumption according to sources 
HVAC and lighting consumption 
Efficiency of plants 
Solar control and natural lighting 
Thermography of envelope 

Insufficient insulation and air-tightness, excess solar radiation through 
skylights, low efficiency and adaptability of HVAC, lack of air energy 
recovery, natural ventilation is not used, lack of comfort, control 
difficulties and building management contracting that discourages 
savings. 

Water Annual consumption of tap water 
Efficiency of plants 
Reusing rainwater 
Reuse of greywater 

Inadequate segregation of consumption, lack of savings mechanisms, 
no greywater nor rainwater is reused and wastewater ends up straight 
to the sewer. 

Materials Impacts of existing construction 
Reusability potentials 
Impacts new construction 

Constructive systems that hinder recycling, high-impact materials in 
some cases and constructive systems that need to be demolished to 
make when modifications have to be carried out 

Waste Generation renovation 
Generation in extension (nc) 

In current practice there is a high waste generation, difficulties in the 
selective separation, reuse and recycling, and a high percentage ends 
up in dumps. 

Figure 5: Evaluation of the existing building, analysis and diagnosis 

In order to link the calculations of the environmental impacts to the operation of the building 
according to the actual real situation (last year) and future (prediction), a model that collects 
usage information and experience of building maintenance and operation was defined. This 
information includes parameters of the operation of spaces, schedules and days of operation, 
intensity and simultaneity in the use of spaces, comfort profiles and any other characteristics 
that could define the performance profiles of PEV-G. This is very important in the evaluation 
of the existing building, but also in the design of the renovation and extension project. 

5. Improvement strategies and quality level to be reached 

Several options for reducing environmental impacts have been analyzed, to be incorporated in 
the proposed renovation and extension of the building. Below (Figure 6), and following the 



 

26 

 

order of the environmental vectors considered, the major opportunities for improvement 
analyzed for the outline project (10), are presented. 

 Analysis conducted Opportunities 

Energy 

and CO2 

HVAC and lighting consumption 
Solar control and natural lighting 
Alternatives for HVAC 

Improving insulation and air-tightness of the envelope, solar control in 
skylights, change to more efficient HVAC and zoning, decreasing comfort 
requirements in areas of short permanence, energy recovery for fresh air, 
installing photovoltaic on the roof and cooling by natural ventilation. 

Water Efficiency of plants 
Reuse of water 
Natural purification 

Savings mechanisms in south wings (renovation) and center (new 
construction), rainwater reuse, recovery of nutrients from wastewater, 
natural purification of greywater and natural discharge of treated water. 

Materials Low impact materials 
Potential for reuse and recycling 

Maximum use of existing construction, renewable and recycled materials in 
renovation (south wing) and new construction (north side), building 
systems with mechanical joints for future reuse and recycling. 

Waste Decrease generation 
Potential for reuse and recycling 

Minimize generation through the selection of constructive systems, 
increased selective separation through construction control, on-site reuse of 
aggregates and recycling of aggregate, metals, wood, plastics, etc… 

Figure 6: Opportunities in environmental renovation and extension 

Once the implementation of improvement opportunities are known, the following steps are to 
determine their economic viability, their practical implementation in the project, their 
influence on the use of the building and the training needed for operators and users. 

6. Objectives of the Project, construction and operation 

The outline design development and final definition of the construction budget can modify 
both the actions of environmental impact reduction as well as their effect on the final 
performance of the building. The legal framework regulating these aspects is the developed 
administrative and technical project and construction tender specifications. These documents, 
with the possible modifications carried out in the future, include the environmental protocol 
for the entire process, the requirements and methodology to be implemented in the 
verification of environmental objectives as well as the building operation analysis model. The 
environmental requirements enable the comparison of the existing building with the situation 
to be achieved once its renovation and extension is fully implemented. These requirements are 
organized both in performance terms, through quantitative verification (Fig. 7) as well as in 
prescriptive and methodological terms, to be implemented to the project and construction.

Also following prescriptive requirements have been proposed: In energy, 30% reduction of 
thermal transmittance in building envelope, increased solar protection, condensation control, 
reduction of air permeability in joints and frames, elimination or reduction of thermal bridges 
and 40% of on-site produced renewable energy (compared to final electricity consumption), 
regardless of regulatory requirements (11). As for HVAC systems, higher efficiency in energy 
production, benefit from the passive criteria developed, free-cooling, flexible comfort 
conditions in some areas, increased distribution efficiency, reducing auxiliary energy 
consumption for pumping and ventilation, increased lighting performance in all power levels 
and regulation according to natural light and contracting a management service depending on 
the final efficiency.  
In water, pressure reducers in the supply, low discharge WC (minimum 2/4 liters) with flow 
interruption, low flow faucets (3-5 l / min) and opening control, dry urinals, mechanical 
separation of the liquid and solid fractions in toilets and greywater natural purification and 
infiltration into the natural soil.  
In materials, both for the renovation and for the extension, using a minimum of 20% recycled 
aggregate in concrete if structural and 100% in non-structural, minimum 90% recycled steel, 
constructive solutions that allow easy disassembly (dry joint) if the materials being joined do 
not have the same level of recyclability. In renovation the constructive solution has to be 
justified by the qualitative comparison of environmental impacts.  
As for urban waste, designing spaces and facilities necessary for selective separation of at 
least the fractions of paper and cardboard, glass, plastic, metal, organic, specials, and other 
large recyclables, and an internal waste management that allows to adopt the external system 
of door to door collection.

7. Conclusions 

The methodology based on a simplified LCA, tools and data freely available and the 
comparison between the baselines (the building itself, regulations, etc..) and the design project 
has allowed to adequately model the building, both in its present definition as well as 
proposed, and to establish environmental objectives and verification processes. It was 
essential to have a team that integrates the municipal officers of urbanism, environment, 
maintenance and building management together with the environmental consultants, with a 
common vision about what is sustainability, how to apply it in building and what actions are 
involved. Environmental impact savings that can be achieved in energy, CO2, water and 
waste, according to current technical and economic possibilities, are between 20% and 80%. 
Preparing a building to operate with low environmental impact is not enough. Also an 
environmental work plan is necessary, from the decision to invest and develop up to the 
building operating, it implies specialists, managers and users, through training and 
information as well as carrying out routine monitoring and improvement. The methodology 
developed in this work, if adjusted to the characteristics of the buildings, climates and usage 
profiles, is applicable to many other cases in the city, the Basque Country and the rest of 
Spain.
