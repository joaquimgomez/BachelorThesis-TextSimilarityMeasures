Abstract [50-200 words: aim, scope and conclusions] 
The article presents the implementation of management measures that have reduced the gas 
consumption for  heating of a university building in Spain by 40%. The measures affect the use of the 
building, e.g., the use of its spaces, and the scheduling of its occupancy. They also affect the 
management of the heating system: a protocol for turning the system on and shutting it off has been 
developed. 
The work is part of a framework for action by the Technical University of Catalonia covering more 
areas and for a longer period of time, in which policies have been designed for managing buildings 
and a number of studies have been developed on the energy consumption of the university’s buildings. 
The article highlights the vision of the research group on the topic, and work methodology proposed. 
The implementation of these measures in the case, which is explained in detail, from November 2006 
until May 2007, has reduced consumption from 113.2 kWh/sqm to 68.7 kWh/sqm a year; thus, the 
hypothesis has been validated. In addition, it was possible to examine methodological details more 
closely. Finally, the relationship between the people involved in the process [the building owners, 
managers and energy users] is a determining factor.

Main Text 

1. Introduction 

Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in Spain have increased by 152% compared to 1990 [1]. 
Energy consumption in buildings (domestic and services) is responsible for around 23% of final 
energy consumption in Spain. Of these, about 8% of the total (35% of consumption attributable to 
buildings) is the non-residential sector, on which there are very few data. 
Although it has been demonstrated that use and management are determining factors in energy 
consumption in buildings [2], these factors are not usually taken into account in policies for energy 
savings and efficiency. Spanish strategic plans focus on new buildings [3, 4] or improvement measures 
for existing buildings to renew their envelope or systems [5, 6], which assume optimum management 
[7]. Furthermore, these improvements require large investments. 
To optimize the management of existing buildings, knowledge of the characteristics of the current 
stock is essential for defining strategies for savings and for the calculation of those savings. In general, 
the descriptions of the surface of the existing stock are only top to bottom [3, 8] or bottom to top [9 - 
11], but there is no evidence from various scales. Also there are few actual consumption data on 
buildings [12]. In the specific case of university buildings, several universities have been monitoring 
consumption, but not all data are openly available [13 - 16]. 
This article addresses the following research questions: 

a) Up to what point can the ideas on optimization of management be applied to existing 
non-residential buildings? How far is the theory from reality? 

b) What are the process’ key points? Is it possible to establish a certain methodology? 
c) Who are the determining players? 

To answer these questions, we have chosen a case study: the buildings of the Technical University of 
Catalonia (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain. The UPC has more than 60 monitored buildings in various 
climatic regions of Catalonia. In addition, the institution has been working for several years on an 
intense policy of sustainability [17, 18] and prior studies have been conducted [19] on the factors that 
determine energy consumption in buildings. In particular, measures have been implemented on the 
campus occupied by the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura del Vallés [Vallés’ School of 
Architecture] (ETSAV). 

2. Institutional context  

The first of the research questions referred to the application of ideas, i.e., the implementation of 
actions or creation of new patterns of behaviour from a theoretical belief. In this case, the theoretical 
root of the need to consume less energy sprouts from the awareness of the planet’s limitations and the 
need to manage resources sustainably. There are also some more pragmatic roots, such as the existence 
of regulations at higher levels (e.g., at the European level) and increased economic costs posed by the 
indiscriminate consumption of energy. These latter reasons are very crucial at the administrative level. 
This section will explain the theoretical and practical engines of the institution under study, the UPC, 
which is relevant to explaining the amount of theoretical and political effort that has been required 
before a case could be applied in practice. 

2.1. Political framework 
After 2 consecutive environmental plans in the periods from 1996-2001 and 2002-2005 [18], UPC 
has approved the UPC Plan for Sustainability in 2015 [20], which is divided into five lines, and one 
of them is Construction, energy and climate change. 
This line created the UPCO2, the programme for reducing GHG emissions from the UPC [21, 22], 
which is part of the challenge Construction, energy and climate change of the UPC Plan for 
sustainability. The following are among the plan’s activities related to energy savings and 
efficiency: 



- At the end of December 2006, a partnership agreement between the Catalan Institute for 
Energy [ICAEN] and the UPC was signed in which the parties undertook to carry out a 
series of measures in relation to savings and energy efficiency, which would be 
implemented in different campuses of the university. This agreement is part of the 
collaboration agreement signed on September 12, 2005 between ICAEN and the 
Institute for Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE) for the definition and 
implementation of the public support activities in the Plan of Action of the Spanish 
Strategy for Energy Saving and Efficiency (E4) [3], in the territory of Catalonia in 
2005. 

- The UPC’s SIRENA project [System of Information on Consumption of Energy 
Resources and Water] [23 - 25].   

2.2. Practical experiences 
Recent experiences carried out within this political framework include:  

- The Process of Application of Environmental Criteria in Architecture (ACA2), 2000 
[26]. 

- Research for the Environmental Excellence of the Baix Llobregat Campus (REAL 
Laboratory), 2001 [27]. 

- Efficiency Plan for the Consumption of Resources (PECR), 2003 [28, 29]. 
- REAL Laboratory 2, 2005. 

In this second laboratory phase, the strategies that have been developed so far in the UPC for 
improving the environmental quality of their buildings are collated and analysed, and diagnoses and 
defining of new objectives are carried out. Having identified the factors that determine consumption of 
energy resources, the tools that enable a detailed analysis are defined: energy demand and system 
performance can be calculated either manually or by using a computer program, depending on the 
level of detail of the analysis and the available data.   
The organisational structure of the UPC was analyzed in regard to decisions and actions related to 
resource management, to make a proposal for an optimal layout diagram for both new buildings and 
existing buildings.  

3. Description of the buildings analysed 
 
A generic description of the characteristics of the UPC’s stock of buildings as a whole is given below. 
As shown in Table 1, the buildings will be described from a management standpoint [surface area, 
climatic region, management, electricity and gas consumption, type of heating and cooling systems 
and type of use]. Other parameters considered to be important could not be included in the general 
description due to the difficulty of collecting such information [U, electrical capacity installed, hours 
of use], but they are in the description of the building studied. The reasons for selecting the specific 
building studied will also be explained. 

3.1. The UPC’s buildings 
The UPC has 96 buildings spread over 10 campuses in a total of 7 municipalities in Catalonia. Their 
total surface area is 404,715.5 sqm. These locations are grouped into a total of 6 meteorological 
stations of the Catalan Institute of Meteorology (Meteocat) [30]. According to the Spanish 
Technical Building Code [CTE], they are in 3 different climatic zones [5], as shown in Figure 1. 
Data are available on the consumption of 64.2% of the buildings, which represent 75.4% of the total 
surface area. As shown in Figure 2, the mean annual electricity consumption of these buildings 
oscillates between 15.1 kWh/sqm and 140.9 kWh/sqm, and the mean annual gas consumption, is 
between 9.0 kWh/sqm and 113.5 kWh/sqm. The gas is mainly used for heating. The time from 
which these data are recorded varies for each building. 
The physical management of the facilities is centralized, so there are three major operators or 
maintainers of the buildings [G1 to G3]; figure 2 shows some differences in ranking between the 
three managers. However, the manager of the unit or centre that the building occupies also has some 
power of decision.  

http://www.sirena-edifici.net/sirena_flex.swf�


Figure 2 also shows that the ETSAV building has high gas consumption. In the comparison of the 
annual CO2 emissions by campus that can be seen in Figure 3, it is only surpassed by the North 
Campus [where there are many air conditioning installations, and which has housed the super-
computer Mare Nostrum since 2005]. Finally, the annual CO2 emissions of that building are higher 
than other buildings of the same type and use [2], as shown in Table 2.  
In addition, a previous study that analyzed the consumption of buildings over the 2002-2003 season, 
had determined that the inefficient management of the building's heating plants increased final 
energy consumption in the building by 30% [2]. Lastly, the centre has a highly motivated 
administrative team that is willing to investigate in order to reduce energy consumption in the 
buildings it occupies. For the above reasons, from now on the management of the heating of the 
ETSAV buildings will be analysed with the aim of optimizing it. 
 

3.2. The Sant Cugat Campus  
 

3.2.1. Description of the building 
The campus is located in Sant Cugat del Valles (elevation: 100m, latitude: 41º 29’ 40” N, longitude: 
2° 2’ 6”W), Barcelona, Spain. The climatic features can be found in Table 3.   
As shown in Figure 4, it consists of 2 buildings (ETSAV and CRITT) that have been built 
progressively, so that the total area has varied from 8,746sqm (up to 1999), 9,267sqm up to 2005 
and 10,130sqm since 2006. 

3.2.2. Description of consumption 
During the period from 1995 to 2005, consumption of gas in the ETSAV building grew steadily by 
approximately 7% annually, with a total increase of 66% within the period. With regard to 
electricity consumption, it grew steadily by around 4% annually, with a total increase of 44% during 
the period.  
The gas-electricity share in total energy consumption []for the period was 70% -30%, but in regard 
to total CO2 emissions the share was 50%-50%. To perform the calculation of emissions, the 
equivalents of 204g CO2/kWh of gas [31] and 501g CO2/kWh electricity were used [32]. 
The mean annual emissions associated with ETSAV energy consumption for the period were 51.3 
kg CO2/sqm, which is above the UPC’s mean annual emissions, which are 40.9 kg CO2/sqm. All of 
the data are shown in table 4. 

4. .Methodology 
 

This study is part of a larger project that primarily aims to assess the weight of each of the factors 
determining the inefficient consumption of energy resources and, once identified and evaluated, to 
identify opportunities for improvement. The factors considered are: 

- Energy demand: the structural characteristics of the building; 
- System performance: inefficient facilities, lack of control or maintenance elements; 
- Use and management: inadequate management and maintenance of facilities, poor utilization 

by users (e.g., leaving windows open when the air conditioning is running). 
The relationship between these reasons is not obvious and is not independent of each other: if the 
maintenance team cannot properly maintain existing facilities, using new technologies, it is possible 
that the same thing could happen. Likewise, by reducing demand (by changing the windows, for 
example) the actions of some irresponsible users continue to minimize savings. In addition, changes in 
the facilities, renewals of air or the thickness of the insulation will change the demand [33]. 
Management has proven to be a determining factor in the examples studied [2], particularly with a 
30% potential for improvement for the ETSAV building. Accordingly, this part of the project 
examines in detail the possibilities of optimizing the management and the applicability of the 
theoretical measures. 
In the first section 4.1, the provenance of all data sets laid out in the article are explained, taking into 
account that attainment of information is already part of the methodology. The second section, 4.2, 
explains the details of the application of the generic analytical methodology of the factors that 
determine energy consumption [28, 33]. Section 4.3 explains the actions that were carried out. Finally, 
the results and conclusions are laid out. 



 
4.1. Sources of information 

4.1.1. Climatological data 
Climatological data can come from two different sources: 
- The Catalan Institute of Meteorology, Meteocat, manages the network of automatic weather 

stations of the Meteorological Service of Catalonia. Table 1 shows the station closest to each 
building. The stations recorded hourly variables.   

- Private meteorological stations installed in the buildings. In the particular case of the ETSAV, 
data were recorded with a Davis station [34] belonging to the ETSAV’s Department of 
Physics and Nuclear Engineering. The observatory is called the ETSAV-DFEN and its 
geographical coordinates are 41° 29’40”N, 2°2’6”E. The station data are read and processed 
using the Energy Weatherlink Software 1.01 program.   
4.1.2. Consumption data 

The consumption data may come from two different sources:  
- Accounting. 
- SIRENA. See section 2.1.b].  

4.1.3. Inside temperatures 
Data for temperatures inside the buildings can come from different sources:  
- Either alcohol or mercury thermometers placed at locations considered representative. In all 

cases, the instruments were placed at a height of approximately 1m above ground and in a 
position similar to that of a worker; proximity to radiators and windows was avoided.  
Reading and recording of temperatures was done manually at 8 and 11 a.m., and 2, 4 and 7 
p.m. each work day. The data were analyzed in comparison to the recommended temperature 
range for winter 17-23 °C [35], as shown in Figure 5.  
This type of monitoring was conducted throughout October, November and December 2006.  

- Testo 435-2 Multi-function instrument, with probes and 0632 1535 IAQ and 0602 0394 T/P. 
The probes were in two classrooms of different sizes as of October 2007. Given their location 
in a crowded locale, they were placed at a height of approximately 2.2m above the ground and 
in a position away from radiators and windows. 

- Data gathering set of Testo-580 with RS232, with Testo 175-H2 temperature and humidity 
logger. This type of monitoring was conducted as of January 2008, replacing the previously 
mentioned mercury thermometers in the same representative spaces.  
4.1.4. Users’ opinions 

It was considered essential to take into account the views of users to verify the characteristics of the 
inside atmosphere, as there were not sufficient measuring tools. The data may come from different 
sources: 

- Personal interviews.  
- Posts in the school’s online forum.  

Online questionnaire on the ETSAV users’ intranet.  
4.1.5. Occupancy 

Occupancy data can come from different sources: 
- Theoretical diurnal profile, with details of student enrolment from the school’s academic 

secretary. To discover the schedules of workers, a face to face survey was conducted in each 
of the spaces of the buildings because there is no official registration. 

- “Off hours” profile with entrance data on people registered by the security guard, from 8 p.m. 
to 8 a.m. on midweek days and 24 hours a day on weekends. 

- People counters. Throughout the months of October to December 2006, two counters were 
installed [36] at two of the three doorways to the ETSAV. Separate data are available for 
entrances and exits. This type of device does not give exact counts, but rather serve to detect 
the amount of movement [33]. As shown in Figure 6, on weekdays people arrive from 8 to 10 
am and leave from noon to 3 pm. In the afternoons, there is only 60% movement; people 
arrive between 2 and 4 pm and leave between 6 and 8 pm. At weekends, they show similar 
patterns, although the amount of movement is only 20% of the usual and entries occur a little 
later in the morning.  
 



4.2. Analysis [first phase] 
After evaluating the consumption of the building (section 3.3.2) and knowing the potential for 
optimizing the management of the heating system [37], it was decided to immediately intervene in the 
building, i.e., implement management actions that would reduce gas consumption as soon as possible.  
To do so, and in accordance with the analysis methodology defined in previous studies [28, 38], some 
aspects had to be considered to be able to implement specific actions on the management of the 
building. 

4.2.1. Analysis of the occupancy profile 
There were theoretical profiles for the ETSAV building occupancy rate from previous studies [29], 
which had also been contrasted with random counts in 2005 [37]. The theoretical profile of the 
occupancy of the different areas of the building during the autumn of 2006 were plotted, taking into 
account the number of students enrolled in each course, and the areas of the building where the 
courses took place. With regard to professors, it was deemed that they spent in the department at least 
the time in which classes took place. Thus, it must be known in advance in which classrooms each 
course provided by the centre will be given and how many enrolments there are. Similarly, we need to 
know the allocation of administrative staff and teaching staff in the offices. Therefore, co-operation by 
the centre’s administration is indispensable.  

4.2.2. Characteristics of the heating system 
In regard to the ETSAV building, the generic information in previous studies [2] on the characteristics 
of the heating system and its components was completed using the details from the original 1991 
blueprints in paper format of the construction project. But the plans did not include the changes that 
took place on the construction phase. There were digitalised plans of the CRITT building with the path 
of the circuit to the boiler room, but the information about the heating vents was incorrect, since the 
changes made to the project were not shown in the documentation or justified in any way.   
Since an integral or comprehensive reading of how the system operated was not possible from the all 
of the information available, on-site checks were made of the facility’s characteristics, the zoning of 
the circuits and the characteristics of the components (boilers, pumps, valves, etc.).  

4.2.3. Customary running of the heating system 
There were two sources of information: the first, because there was no written protocol for managing 
the heating, were direct talks with the head of building maintenance. Up until 2005, the programming 
was done manually, so it was directly contingent upon the working hours of maintenance personnel. 
As of early 2006, there is an automatic scheduler with up to 50 programmes, which regulate only the 
on-off operation of boilers, i.e., the regulation of each of the circuits must still be done manually.  
The second was the online information using the SIRENA tool. Both sources revealed that the system 
was running continuously from the beginning to the end of the heating season, so gas consumption 
was the same during the day as at night and on working days as at weekends [25, 39]. The slight 
variations in consumption corresponded to variations in demand, variations which are minor over the 
weekend, when there are only students and security personnel in the building.  

4.2.4. Climate 
Considering that energy consumption for heating has to maintain a relationship with demand and 
hence with the external climate, we used the concept of degree-days [5]. The degree-day is not directly 
related to consumption, but can give an idea of the trend that climate should have on consumption. In 
an ideal situation for optimal management, the same quantity of gas would be consumed for each 
degree-day.   
As shown in Figure 7, a combined analysis of the management system of heating, occupancy and 
climatic variations was performed [40]. It was observed that there was no relationship between the 
three factors: the building was heated continuously, without taking into account changes in climate or 
occupancy. 

4.2.5. Discovering the response capacity of the building and its systems 
To check the possibilities of modifying the management pattern in the building would have 
repercussions on interior comfort or the thermal stability of the buildings, so we studied the ability of 
the heating system to preheat the building and the capacity of the thermal mass of the building to slow 
the influence of external temperature variations in different indoor spaces. 
The Balanç Energètic tool [41] was used to estimate changes in the internal temperature every hour. 
The results of this analysis were used to define the heating season’s nocturnal off time and to re-



programme the system’s on and off cycles. The ultimate goal was to reduce the consumption needed 
to meet the requirements in the building [39]. This could have been done with another tool, but the one 
we used was useful, simple and quick. 

4.2.6. Conclusions of the first analysis 
Of course, it became evident that a large amount of money could be invested in replacing the system 
with a much more adjustable one, but opportunities for action that could be implemented immediately 
without the need for more financial investment than the dedication of the staff were also identified. It 
should be noted that the assumption that changes in management require no investment is debatable, 
and will be discussed again in the section on conclusions.  
Regarding the management pattern, some simple changes in turning the system on/off could be made 
using just the regulation devices already available. As for the circuits, some manual changes could 
also be made in the periods when the maintenance staff is in the building. Furthermore, the use being 
made of the building’s spaces could be adjusted to the simplified zoning of the system. 
 

4.3. Actions taken 
In general, the heating season in this climatic zone is from October to April. The first months are for 
charging up the building, the central months correspond to the usual heating period, and the final 
months are the end of the heating season. The research was conducted in three phases (see Figure 7): 
the analysis was conducted in the first phase (Section 4.2), the first actions were carried out in the 
second phase, and they were refined in the third phase.  

4.3.1. First actions (second phase) 
As shown in Figure 7, the months of December and January coincide with the end of the first semester 
and holiday periods. The analysis has revealed that, although the building is used much less, the 
consumption is the same.  

a) First, the management of the heating was adapted to the building’s schedule of use: times 
when it was minimally or completely unoccupied were identified and shutdowns in the system 
were programmed without interfering with the operation of the building. In particular, a five-
hour shutdown at night in the operation of heating was established as was a reduction in the 
hours the heat was on at weekends [39]. A management model for specific periods of non-
classroom time in the heating season was also established. To this end, we identified the 
different types of days, which can be seen in Table 5, and a management profile was defined 
for each of them that included routines for turning the heating and lighting on and off. Each 
day of the year was classified according to these types. 

b) Second, we took into account the influence of variations in the external environment (e.g., 
whether it was a sunny day or not) in the programming of the heating taking into account the 
characteristics of the building. That is, the circuits for heating locales with large windows on 
the south facade were manually programmed differently than those with windows on the 
north. Similarly, on warm days the system was turned on for less time than on cold days.  

c) In addition, preferred use areas were identified, so before using a space heated by a new 
circuit, all the spaces belonging to a same heating circuit, which was already turned on, were 
used. Likewise, a work classroom for students to use outside of school hours was set up (until 
then, all of the classrooms were available and heated 24 hours a day), which represented a 
reduction of 70% of the surface to be heated outside the normal timetable (from 8 am to 9 
pm). 

d) Finally, more reasonable temperature values were set. Previously, there were areas where 
temperatures were very high and, on the other hand, there were spaces that were kept at the 
same temperature regardless of whether they were occupied or not, as shown in Figure 5.  

Internal temperatures measured, as well as the opinions of users were used as a system for verifying 
interior conditions, and hence the adequacy of the decisions taken. This made it possible to detect the 
most controversial areas, in which, after a small analysis, other problems were detected, namely: 

- Library: several of the windows did not close properly, so there were large losses at 
workplaces near large windows.  

- Computer Centre (CC): along with the library, it belonged to a heating circuit that fed areas 
with very different uses, so the programming of the circuit was inadequate.  

- Concierge: draughts of air, very large space.  



- CRITT building: large losses from transmission and filtrations [42]. 
That is, as soon as the overheating of the building finished, the weak points were found in the 
architectural, construction and systems design, including the administrative and social weak points. 
The problems encountered with users and maintenance personnel correspond to that described in the 
sources consulted [43]. Users’ problems are primarily due to differences in thermal sensation and lack 
of information on how the heating system operates. The problems found with the staff directly 
involved in the operation are due to lack of time or knowledge of how to operate it correctly [44, 45]. 

4.3.2. Recording of actions (third phase) 
The beginning of the new school semester in February provides an opportunity to regulate the process. 
The results from the first phase were analyzed to further improve the management of the heating 
system. Thus, the management profiles of the heating system proposed in the previous phase were 
adjusted taking into account the occupancy of the building and comments from users.  

a) A model was created for recording and monitoring the heating management profile at regular 
intervals. The model included the following information:  

- Recording of maximum, minimum and mean exterior temperatures  
- Recording of pumping and return temperature of all of the circuits 
- Routines for turning the circuits on and off 
- Observations 
b) New probes were added to measure and record the pumping and return temperature of the 

heating system’s water circuits and the surface temperature of the vents. New environmental 
comfort measurement points were added.  
When monitoring and recording the various parameters, it was possible to verify aspects that 
up to that time had only been theoretical considerations, such as the response of the interior 
temperature to the on and off phases of the heating system, and changes throughout the day 
both for internal temperature as well as occupancy. 

c) Finally, the allocation of classrooms for different subjects was revised, and it was proven that 
there was a connection with the heating circuits that were on. That is, before assigning a 
classroom belonging to a new circuit, the occupancy of the classrooms was completed based 
on the circuits that were already on and, therefore, heated. With the agreement of the 
professors involved and with the school’s administrative team, the classrooms for some 
subjects were changed to enhance, as explained above, the management of heating and 
lighting. 

The results from this second phase are laid out in section 5.  
The investigation is ongoing, and a second analysis is being performed to identify other options for 
action, such as the management of the building envelope, changes in energy systems and 
improvements in the regulation of the heating system.  In addition, the management model of the 
heating system that was created during the 2006-2007 period has been transferred to the ETSAV 
maintenance personnel for the 2007 - 2008 school year as a tool to support decision making in 
managing the heating system. This management model was created for a specific case, but with the 
intention that it is adaptable to the characteristics of other buildings of the UPC. 
 
5. Results 
 
In absolute terms, gas consumption for heating during the period from November 2006 to March 2007 
inclusive has been reduced [46] to 62.7%. As shown in Table 6, gas consumption per unit area was 
reduced to 57.5%. Taking into account climatic variations [39], Figure 8 shows that the consumption 
in the 2006-07 season has not only been reduced to 75.9%, but is also more stable.  
These savings can be attributed to the change in management, because other relevant variables such as 
characteristics of the building envelope, facilities or hours of use of the building have not changed 
significantly from one period to another. 
Although electricity consumption was not the main subject of the study, changes in the use of the 
spaces of the building have involved changes that have affected its lighting. It can be seen in Table 6 
that the electricity consumption per unit area has been reduced to 89.1%. 



Finally, looking at the results in terms of CO2 emissions per unit area, Table 7 shows that total 
emissions have been reduced to 70.4%. As there has been more gas savings, it can be seen in the same 
table that the contribution of consumption of electricity and gas to total emissions has also changed. 
All the annual (from September to June) values are shown in table 4. 
 
6. Conclusions 

 
An example of application [practical, not theoretical] of optimization measures for the management of 
heating systems in a university building at the UPC in Spain has been submitted. An explanation has 
also been given of the long political and theoretical institutional process prior to the intervention.  
The study has helped verify some hypotheses held by the research team as starting points, deeming 
that low consumption of energy is a good indicator both of good design and good management, and 
strictly technical measures do not always solve inefficiency, but must be considered within the context 
of management and designed to be properly managed throughout the lifetime of the building [33]: 

a) As to the applicability, 
- It is possible to define strategies for action along the route of energy efficiency based on 

building management. 
- It is possible to reduce the consumption of energy resources (such as those associated with 

heating in this case) by optimizing the management of the use of a building and its systems. 
Results can be obtained fairly quickly and with little financial investment.  

- In terms of economic investment, if the premise was to act on the management of the building 
and its facilities without regard to actions on the building itself or its systems, the goal then 
becomes the most efficient management (in relation to resources consumed) of the building 
and its facilities, making the most of what there is (regardless of whether improvements can be 
made to the building and its facilities). This route is very attractive from an economic point of 
view because it offers the possibility of minimizing the relationship between money invested 
(because, although lower, there are also investments to be made) and the results obtained. But 
we need to consider what it means to optimize just one of the factors that determine resource 
consumption on the premises. 

- The results of applying the measures to optimize management have strayed very little from the 
theoretical calculations [2] for the same building. It was possible to reduce gas consumption 
for heating by 30%.  

b) In terms of methodology, it is based on the combined analysis of consumption, demand and 
usage. Therefore, access to all necessary information is essential.  
In this case, the management strategy was conducted over a very specific time of year and 
only on the heating system, but the same kind of strategies could be applied to other periods 
and other energy systems of the building, such as lighting or cooling systems. 

c) In regard to the agents,  
- The existence of institutional policy is not enough: after making people aware of the need for 

change, there must be skilled personnel who can translate the theory into practice. The 
absence of a competent intermediate body may impede transmission and, therefore, success. 

- The distribution of responsibilities is not clear: users, those responsible for facilities and 
administrators of the centre are influential at different times and in different ways. 

- Inadequate transmission of information and decision making occurs, so it is important to 
centralize the process so that responses are appropriate.  

- In relation to the adaptation of their response, management staff must be skilled not only in air 
conditioning systems, but also in the factors that influence the feeling of comfort (air 
temperature, relative humidity, radiant temperature and air speed). Attention is usually only 
given to air temperature or user complaints and responses are limited to turning on the heating, 
without analyzing the causes of discomfort.  

The following general conclusions can be written for the Spanish case based on these partial 
conclusions: 

- There should be an administrative unit that would integrate programming of use and systems 
and monitoring of comfort. 



- The management has a social component as important as the technical component, because it 
has to do with changing patterns of behaviour at all levels. 

- Transparency and accessibility to data of the characteristics of buildings and systems, use, and 
finally, energy consumption are essential for management. 

 
Further work 
This study has led to the development of protocols for action so that in the future further action can be 
undertaken in the building without needing a research team behind it. This guide for the management 
of buildings is designed to be applicable not only to the building studied, but the UPC’s entire stock of 
buildings. The experience will soon be presented in another article.
