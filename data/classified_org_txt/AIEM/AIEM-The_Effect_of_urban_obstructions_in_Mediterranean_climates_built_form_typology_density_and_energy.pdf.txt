Abstract 

 

In spite of the ever increasing unsustainable nature of the “conventional” city and its concurrent 

assertion as a human habitat par excellence, it is important to define intervention strategies that 

can improve the “metabolic” operation of built environments. If related to urban morphology, 

these take on more effective potentiality and are a guiding tool for more appropriate, more 

beneficial interventions. In the specific context of the Mediterranean compact city, the 

interaction between density, morphology and energy discussed here is one of the components 

required if not for the complex solution of the problem, then at least for reducing the 

environmental impact of urban models. The results here proposed of a comparative study 

carried out on various fabrics in the city of Barcelona, in search of parametric relations between 

density and energy-environmental behaviour. The said relations, we analyse the effects of 

urban obstructions: the basis of knowledge required for conscious built environment 

transformation, towards more efficient conditions.  

 

 

 

1. Introduction 

 

In the past fifty years the planet has experienced a shift to a cultural model which has produced 

a violent reconfiguration of settlement systems, under the effect of a process of expansion, 

which is claimed as a technological era dogma. A period of rapid and radical changes, yet so 

very young that “corresponding thought does not yet exist” (Sertorio, 2002: 22). Technology, 

spun outside of the domain of activities controlled by man, becomes “the dynamic partner that 

helps to modify the motivations of man himself” (Sertorio, 2002: 24), causing the definitive 

separation from the natural limits of the physiocratic era.

The offspring of this cultural picture would seem to be today’s urbanisation growth, which is 

described by many as The Global Urban Age and is distinguished by two quantitatively 

significant phenomena: constant, exponential population growth in existing cities and the 

simultaneous unstoppable emergence of new ones. The combined effect of these two events 

will mean that three quarters of the global population will be living in cities by 2050 (Figure 1) 

(Kanai and Soya, 2007). As the principal habitat of today human being, these are then widely 

considered to be the main cause of ecosystem destruction and the most significant threat to 

humanity survival (Rogers and Gumuchdjian, 1997). The very nature of contemporary cities 

has, however, illustrated the inadequacy of traditional disciplinary categories in architecture and 

urban planning, developed by modern culture, in analytically describing the structural complexity 

of the phenomena related to the Global Urban Age (Koolhaas, 2000). 

 

However, in spite of their ever increasing unsustainable nature, cities mysteriously continue to 

exist, to operate, to attract an ever increasing number of people, constantly increasing their 

ecological footprint, eating up energy as well as environmental and economic resources. 

Although it is not always possible to fully understand the interactions between the environment 

and the metropolitan setting, it is clear that it is here where a wide margin exists which we can 

work on for greater efficiency.  

 

If new settlement models (developed on the basis of technological innovations produced in 

recent years and directly influenced by growing awareness of energy and the environment) are 

still a small proportion compared to the great mass of the ordinary city, it nevertheless seems

clear that in the contemporary metropolis the fate of the sustainable project is in play (Figure 2). 

Research carried out so far in this field has been able to show that strategies and technologies 

which redefine more appropriate conditions for the metropolitan habitat are possible, yet on the 

other hand this research has lacked strength. It is now inevitable that this is to be integrated in a 

vision that enables us to grasp the complexity of the phenomena, also considering, of course, 

multiple perspectives and scales of reference (Mostafavi and Doherty, 2010).  

 

 

Figure 2. Eco-cities and conventional cities

Nevertheless, how it cannot be ignored, that the sustainable approach to urban phenomena 

appears by its very nature to be many-sided and – in certain ways – even undetermined, which 

creates the suspicion in many that it lacks scientific nature. Research in the field is often 

contradictory, unclear in its disciplinary scope and the results often seem ambiguous. The very 

concept of sustainability is weak and lacks incisiveness, especially in contemporary design 

practice (Maas et al., 2010).  

 

Yet just below the skin of the cities there is an intertwining of deep ties between urban form, 

density and sustainability. The morphology of cities, the significant amount of land that they 

occupy, the energy they consume, the type of transport they adopt and the living model that 

they shape – these are all phenomena that profoundly affect the environment and determine  

the conditions of its social and economic sustainability. Cities are not just a concentration of 

problems (as they present themselves), but they are certainly the place where we need to look 

for the solutions. 

  

We will now focus on by reflecting on the interrelations which link density - in its many aspects 

and declinations - to sustainability. Since the very first emergence of the modern metropolis, the 

growth of density has seemed out-of-step compared to the increase in well-being and the

quality of living; almost as if, beyond a certain point, the minimum conditions for living standards 

in an urban environment start to disappear. Overcrowding, poor solar access and less 

ventilation reduce the level of the quality of living in areas which are densely populated, despite 

the fact that energy, ecology and environmental performances still seem to have consistent 

margins of improvement, even beyond the critical value of density, defined in relation to the 

overall quality of metropolitan living. While the emergence of the first unwanted effects of high 

density has led to the identification of standard parameters - which have become one of the key 

points of urban planning -, the change in energy, ecology and environmental performance still 

awaits analytical study and effective modelling.  

 

 

2. Built form typologies, solar radiation and energy consumption in dense 

contexts  

 

Faced with the extreme complexity of environmental and energy interactions in metropolitan 

contexts, numerous attempts have been made at neutral comprehension supported by 

analytical parameters. Firstly, an attempt was made to overcome the multi-sided nature of the 

concept of density, by giving it objectivity and capacity for morphological description (Rapaport, 

1975; Alexander, 1993; Churchman, 1999; Berghauser and Haupt, 2010). Following this, 

attention was focussed on the different aspects that influence the metabolic efficiency of the 

built form typologies that make up urban systems and on the definition of the concept of 

sustainability in the presence of high density (Isalgue et al., 2007, Ratti et al., 2005, Cheng et 

al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2011, Strømann-Andersen and Sattrup, 2011). 

 

What appears clearly from these studies is the strong influence of the reference climate on the 

direction, the interest and the individual results of the research. The positive effect of the 

variation of a particular parameter (e.g. the density, the size of the urban canyon or the sky view 

factor) can be negative for other climactic conditions. It is certainly true that “in the already built 

cities of northern Europe, urban density is of particular concern, because the high latitudes and 

the associated low solar inclinations mean that the urban geometry affects solar access much 

more here than in other urban centres around the world. Overshadowing is an obvious 

problem.” (Strømann-Andersen and Sattrup, 2011: 2012). Yet if we refer to Mediterranean 

climates - where energy consumption depends on the ever increasing demand for summer 

cooling - dense urban contexts, reducing direct heat gain because of reciprocal obstructions, 

end up being more efficient. 

 

This study seeks to understand the type and extend of the interferences between morphology, 

density, solar radiation and energy consumption in modern-day European cities with a 

Mediterranean climate. The aim is to provide a contribution on what impact a specific urban 

context has on solar access and on the energy pattern of a residential block; to understand 

which of the geometric-analytical parameters is the most suitable in expressing a relationship 

between urban density and energy behaviour; and build a basis of knowledge which is able to 

define a domain of critical values of density, beyond which benefit from solar radiation is 

compromised and an increase in consumption is caused. 

 

Answering this, although in a limited manner, can lead to the definition of a methodology for 

urban intervention that is aware of the interactions between buildings and energy and their

effects. In order to make this type of tool suitable in the early stages of planning, we aimed to 

develop a process that reduces the necessary input data, the calculation stage, and focuses on 

defining qualitative and quantitative features of the built form typology based on solar access 

and consumption.

2.1 Scale of reference 

 

In trying to define the spatial entities that make up the structural core of the urban space, 

Conzen (1960) and Muratori and Maretto (1960) identify three: the street system; the lot pattern; 

and the building configuration. As a scale of reference this study takes those in which the 

above-mentioned entities are central - the block and the fabric. On one hand they are the most 

suitable for describing morphological properties through parameters of density; on the other 

hand they enable us to control the interactions between resources, environment and the 

building, to a scale that has proved to be decisive for defining sustainability strategies. What is 

more, often the decisions to be made in the early project stages on an urban scale have a 

greater impact and resilience on the environmental and energetic behaviour of the building 

compared to the architectural and technological-constructive decisions, which are normally 

more costly (Strømann-Andersen and Sattrup, 2011). Therefore, this knowledge and the relative 

control in terms of environmental efficiency seem appropriate and necessary in order to achieve 

better results which can handle current challenges. 

 

 

2.2 Methodology 

 

In thinking about the search for critical values of density, it was deemed in keeping carrying out 

the comparison on various levels: the description of the physical consistency and the evaluation 

of energy and environmental behaviour. Starting with analysis (using a series of indicators) of 

the density of the real fabrics and then using digital modelling (which reflected the properties

observed) we were able to study the influence on solar radiation access and relative energy 

consumption.

The comparative studies were carried out on a sample of urban fabrics in the city of Barcelona 

(Figure 3), which represent the European compact city with a Mediterranean climate. Physical 

consistency and the relative density of the cases chosen (Table 1) were then examined with 

reference to the indicators used in Spacematrix (Figure 4) (Berghauser and Haupt, 2010).

In this way it is possible to link the quantitative parameters with the built form typology for the 

scale of the block and of the fabric. In the preliminary stage, six cases were identified to try out 

the methodological process and deduce trends and evaluations from the results. In order to 

prevent the formal singularities and spatial inconsistencies of the actual blocks from affecting 

the interpretation of the performance of the distinct morphologies, the cases underwent a 

process of Normalisation and Replication (Zhang et al., 2011). In this way, the urban contexts, 

modelled by tracing out the geometric structure of the actual fabrics, are made up of 

homogeneous blocks (Figure 5). Accepting, therefore, to work with “the arrogance of the media” 

(Berghauser and Haupt, 2010: 100) the effects of the specific features of the single element are 

excluded, which can compromise understanding of actual environmental behaviour and create 

difficulties in the interpretation of results.

The cases selected in Barcelona represent some of the typical urban blocks of the compact 

European city. The area of Barceloneta, near the port, was one of the first urban developments 

beyond the walls of the old town. Designed in 1753 with a unitary plan, it is made up of a fabric 

of long, narrow blocks, completely built-up, and a narrow road network. The basic module of the 

block is made up of square building units, 8.40 metres sideways. During the 19
th
 and 20

th
 

centuries it underwent a process of densification which led to an increase in the average height 

of the buildings from the original two floors to the current four-six. The Eixample represents the 

typical fabric of the high-density, European city in the 19
th
 century, made up of square blocks 

113.3 metres sideways with the typical chaflán on the corners and wide road networks. 

 

The blocks in their present condition are characterised by deep buildings of average height, with 

a considerable covered surface. Mar Bella, however, is one of the contemporary interpretations 

attributed to the urban planning of Ildefons Cerdà. The court is defined by a C-shaped building 

of similar height but lesser depth compared to the cells of the Eixample, and by a low building in 

line which contains a tower of thirteen floors in the corner. It represents, in fact, a typical case of 

contemporary intervention work within the European compact city. Borrell i Soler has a fabric of 

low-density detached buildings, often found in bourgeois residential developments of the 

second half of the 20
th
 century. The Raval is one of the areas in the Ciutat Vella district which 

arose from expansion in the industrial age, outside of the medieval walls. It is a compact, very 

dense fabric made up of irregular blocks. Finally, Gràcia, the historic core with origins dating 

back to the 17
th
 century, has compact edification grouped in courts of medium-low density.

Using the Heliodon 2

 simulator, digital models were studied in terms of solar access. The 

calculation hypotheses underlying the software do not make it possible to determine the exact 

incident radiation, but on the other hand they closely relate it to the geometric properties of the 

objects, making it suitable for comparative studies on the relations between solar radiation, 

density and urban morphology. The performances are initially evaluated in reference to the 

summer season and in two conditions (the obstructed and unobstructed block).

For the façades of each, the solar heat gains (kWh), the solar flux (kWh/m

) and the Sky View 

Factor [SVF] (%) are determined (Figure 6). The heat gains make it possible to examine the 

differences between the two urban situations, whereas the solar flux seems effective for 

comparing the different fabrics, e.g. by observing behaviour according to the floors and the 

orientation.

The energy simulation carried out with Archisun 3.0
3
 software was set up in order to control as 

well as possible the variation of parameters, which play a main role in the study.  

 

Default values were applied to all variables except for those related to urban morphology and its 

behaviour with regard to solar radiation. Geographical location, weather conditions and the 

alternation of typical days were the same for each of the six cases
4
. The thermal parameters of 

the skin and of the internal surfaces, just like the building services specifications, were kept by 

default. 

A set value equal to 25% of the total was given to the vertical, transparent surfaces. Archisun 

3.0 makes it possible, with a graphic interface, to set up a model of the urban context, but in 

practice the tool does not enable you to model it with the precision required to be able to 

characterise them in the various fabrics. This is why in order to distinguish the obstructed case 

from the unobstructed; you need to examine the obstruction of the skin, determined with the 

calculation of the mean SVF for the separate façades with Heliodon 2. 

 

 

2.3 Results and analysis of preliminary study  

 

At this preliminary stage attention was concentrated on the comparison of solar radiation 

conditions in obstructed and unobstructed cases, in reference to the scale of the block and 

relative energy consumption. The results on radiation were compared by making reference to 

the summer period – in which it is presumed that the positive effect of reduction of incident 

radiation from the urban context is clearer – in the two different situations.

criteria of evaluation. The programme looks at the object of study according to the theoretical model of the grey box and 

associates climactic or geographical location to this as well as some basic parameters on the type of use and 

consumption. Available on line: http://www.upc.edu/aie/.

 In the alternation of the four seasons, the software considers average values for each month, taking into account the 

variation in the day-night cycle. It then defines, on a statistical basis and for each season, an alternation of three typical 

days, different for climactic conditions which may be different from the average condition. Here the small climactic 
differences that may exist between the distinct positions are entirely negligible.

©  AÑO 7, núm. 19, JUNIO 2012  | THE EFFECT OF URBAN OBSTRUCTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATES: BUILT 

FORM TYPOLOGY, DENSITY AND ENERGY    

 Michele Morganti, Helena Coch, Carlo Cecere 

First look at Table 1 and Figure 4. If we find interesting the descriptive ability of urban 

morphology with FSI and GSI (which follow the pattern of the other parameters of density), it is 

also equally interesting to relate them to the height-width relationship of the urban canyon 

which, however, diverges. Compare, for instance, the cases [A], [B] and [E], in which with 

comparable values of FSI and GSI do not correspond in the relationship mentioned. The data 

suggests that the geometric properties of the street system, even though influential in 

determining the effect of obstructions, are not enough to understand environmental behaviour, 

as they are unable to describe the morphology of the urban unit beyond the façade. If, however, 

we refer to sky view factor and façade energy gain ratio (FER) we get a description that can be 

related consistently to the building intensity-coverage pair (FSI-GSI). More specifically, the first 

refers just to the geometric properties of the built volume, whereas the second bears in mind the 

orientation, therefore providing information on the solar access. Figure 7 shows the behaviour of 

the study cases and trends deduced. Looking at the two pairs of graphs, we notice how [B] is 

the only one that optimises in each the environmental behaviour, favouring lighting and solar 

radiation. A completely opposite case can be seen in [E] however. It is equally interesting to 

notice the almost direct proportionality FER-SVF, which in a way confirms the validity and the 

inter-changeability of the parameters used.

We will now analyse the effect of obstructions in the different urban contexts (Table 2, Figure 8). 

Comparing the gradients between the obstructed condition and the unobstructed one with the 

GSI values, we see a trend for an inverse proportionality, from which once again it is [B] that 

diverges the most. The fact that the urban area has less effect on solar radiation is to be 

attributed not so much to the orientation of the blocks (which is similar to the other cases) as to

the morphology of the fabric; its largeness means that in summer there is almost undisturbed 

solar access. 

 

These differences seem to flatten out however if we refer to energy consumption for heating 

and cooling in the two conditions (Table 3 Figure 9). Despite the fact that the increase in winter 

consumption represents a greater percentage than the percentage of the reduction in summer, 

the final energy balance take an advantage in favour of actual urban systems (i.e. with 

obstructions) with gains ranging from 6.6% and 11.1%. In addition to the reduction of the 

gradient between different built form typologies, relations with density parameters appear less 

evident at first sight. If more detailed research seems necessary to understand these 

interactions rationally, it now seems evident that, in terms of consumption, the European 

compact city has a margin where we can work to reduce inefficiency. The positive effect of 

obstructions on the energy balance opens up the field to possible transformation work through 

densification (or thinning depending on the climates), which if controlled using a methodology of 

this type favours control and improvement of the environmental and energy performance of 

urban fabrics.

2.4 Limitations and future developments  

 

The study is a preliminary stage in the development of an appropriate methodology and the 

investigation of possible results. The process has shown that, even though we need to broaden 

the reference case survey and develop the investigation method, potential in its application can 

be seen in the preliminary project stages, as a control tool for modifications on metropolitan 

systems and as an element that strategically directs the types of intervention according to the 

urban morphologies. It must be said however that an advancement of knowledge in this sector 

is one of the components that constitutes reaching the complex state of balance for urban 

contexts which falls under the name of sustainability. That same condition which we tend to 

today, which can be found in natural systems, for which the minimum entropy is produced 

(Sertorio, 2000: 7). 

 

In order not to distort the results reached so far, certain considerations are necessary. It is 

important to remember that the simulation carried out with Heliodon 2 provides radiation values 

that are not real (even though they are reliable as proportional to a large extent) and therefore 

suitable only for comparative studies. Another significant aspect concerns the evaluation of

consumption and heat characteristics of the skin. In Archisun 3.0 the effects of the obstructions 

were considered by modifying the parameter only on the transparent parts. The software, based 

on the fact that the thermal effect of solar radiation on the opaque surfaces can be let it out on 

the global thermal balance, neglects the possible effects of the obstructions on these. 

 

Faced with the unsustainable nature of the conventional city and the contemporary assertion 

that it is a habitat par excellence, it is important to define intervention strategies that improve the 

metabolic functioning of built-up environments. If connected to the urban morphology, these 

gain more effective potentiality and are a guiding tool for more appropriate, more beneficial 

interventions. The interaction between density, morphology and energy shown here, is one of 

the components required if not for the complex solution of the problem then at least for the 

reduction of the environmental impact of urban models, which today has become urgent and 

unavoidable.
