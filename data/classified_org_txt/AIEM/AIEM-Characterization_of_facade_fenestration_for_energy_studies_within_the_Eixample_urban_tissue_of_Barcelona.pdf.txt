Abstract

District heating networks are commonly addressed in the literature as one of the most effective solutions for decreasing the 
greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. These systems require high investments which are returned through the heat
sales. Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease, 
prolonging the investment return period. 
The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand – outdoor temperature function for heat demand 
forecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665 
buildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district 
renovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were 
compared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors.
The results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications
(the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation 
scenarios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered). 
The value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the 
decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and 
renovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the 
coupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and 
improve the accuracy of heat demand estimations.

research activity on urban contexts is being encouraged, even with the emergence of new research fields such as Urban 
Physics [1]. Due to the complexity of urban environments, though, these studies are in need of simplified urban models, 
where the compromise between simplicity and accuracy poses some of the main questions [2].  

Despite the astonishing progresses in computer-modeling tools and data acquisition techniques during the past 
decades, some aspects of urban modelling are still challenging. One of them would be the availability of extensive 
urban models at the suitable level of detail [3] for the purpose of the study. Other would be the representativeness of 
models reproducing existing environments, not only from a geometrical point of view, but also from a semantic one.  
In this sense, the modelling of building envelopes on an urban scale would be a significant example of these current 
limitations. 

 Building envelope acts as a filter between indoor and outdoor environments, where windows constitute especially 
sensitive spots to the energy exchanges taking place through the building skin. The importance of fenestration in 
buildings from an energy approach has been intensively addressed in literature based on the proportion of window 
surface to the opaque one (either façade or floor areas) [4]–[6]. However, these works consider fenestration ratios 
either as a prefixed input data or as a variable for theoretical studies, with scarce references to representative existing 
values in real built-up contexts [7].  

The amount of glazed surface in an urban context is the result of multiple factors such as climate, solar orientation, 
aesthetics, historical tradition, technical aspects, urban regulations, economical restrictions, use of the building, etc. 
Consequently, as fenestration indexes differ to a wide range in the same urban tissue, the modelling of façades in urban 
studies tends to become a time-consuming task. 

The aim of this paper is to explore the possibility of characterizing the degree of fenestration of a certain city 
through the study of a limited sample of buildings. To this end, two objectives are defined in the present work. Firstly, 
providing guiding values of window-to-wall ratio (WWR) for the sample discussing its representativeness regarding 
the whole tissue. Second, assessing the role of two variables with regard to openings size: the date of construction and 
the façade orientation.

2. Method  

Once the study sample has been selected, a three-step process is carried out in order to draw conclusions regarding 
the size of façade openings. First, a multi-approach data collection procedure is conducted over the selected urban 
sample. On one hand, the outward appearance of buildings is graphically documented combining ground (Google 
Street view, on-site images) and airborne imagery (Google Earth Pro). On the other, spatial (size, shape, orientation) 
and non-spatial information (date of construction of the building) is gathered through cadastral surveys. 

Second, a data processing is undertaken over the information collected in the previous step. This process is built 
upon the manual drawing of building elevations. These elevation drawings, besides providing a qualitative view of 
openings layout, are the working basis to quantify the area of openings and opaque surfaces. The data processing is 
then completed with the development of a specific database that includes the area of opaque/glazed surfaces, 
orientation and date of construction for each façade facet of the buildings within the sample.  

Third, based on the database information, fenestration indexes for each façade facet are calculated and assessed in 
terms of average and dispersion indicators. For this study, the window-to-wall ratio (WWR) has been selected as the 
evaluation parameter. WWR is a dimensionless indicator calculated as the quotient of opening area and the total wall 
area where those openings are placed. WWR calculations in this work have no taken into account the ground level in 
order to avoid the possible deviation introduced by commercial window shops and pedestrian/car access.

Finally, conclusions on the WWR dataset are drawn from twofold perspective. On one hand, the degree of 
fenestration for a certain urban tissue is characterized by providing WWR guiding values and heterogeneity indicators. 
On the other, we assess possible patterns of correspondence between WWR values and the two variables under 
analysis: date of construction and orientation. 

3. Case study 

The Eixample tissue of Barcelona (Spain) is considered a representative case study to be analyzed. The original 
project was conceived by the engineer Idelfons Cerdà in response to the unhealthy conditions of Barcelona during the 
first half of the 19th century. However, its urban consolidation was stretched out in time as a progressive filling process 
of a basic mesh in contrast to the typical oil slick growth. First, the basic grid was built upon urbanization works and 
sanitation system (blocks of 113x113m and 20-meter-width streets). After, the plot distribution was carried out over 
the basic urban units. Finally, buildings were built up spread over time, until the pre-existing urban skeleton was 
completely filled. As a result of this layered consolidation, buildings from different architectonic periods coexist in 
relative small urban areas. This fact, together with the characteristic geometry of the tissue, makes this area a 
suggestive case study to address the link between façade design, orientation and age of construction.  

3.1. Description of the study area 

The study area selected for the present work, bounded by Marina, Napols, Provença and Industria streets, belongs 
to the Eixample Dreta district. Among the nine urban blocks comprised within this area, five of them have been 
selected for further analysis (Figure 1). On the whole, the study sample consisted of 125 buildings, built between 1900 
and 2013. For this work, only the exterior façades of the blocks have been analyzed, bringing the overall total of 
48.044 m2 of façade surface distributed in eight orientations (NE, NW, SE, SW, N, S, E, W).

3.2. Criteria for the architectonic period 

History of architecture has provided a reading of the glazed surface evolution mainly in qualitative terms, limiting 
the quantitative approach to rough comparisons between epochs. In order to assess the historical implications on 
transparency degree of façades, five 20-year periods have been defined for the present work (Figure 1). Time 
boundaries between periods correspond to key milestones for history of architecture in Spain, such as armed conflicts 
and significant changes in technical or regulatory aspects.

4. Results  

The elevations of the façades under study are depicted in Figure 2, including information about the date of construction 
and orientation. In the light of these drawings, the marked heterogeneity in building openings is corroborated. Notable 
differences are detectable among buildings, even with a neighboring position. Additionally, disparity is also present 
between the ground and the rest of floors, reflecting differences of use and accessibility from the pedestrian level.

4.1. WWR values for the whole dataset 

According to results, openings represent, on average, almost 31% of the façade for the study case (Figure 3). It 
should be noticed, though, that the WWR dataset is characterised by a scattered distribution (SD=11, VC=37%), with 
WWR values ranging from 73% to 10%. From an analysis in terms of frequency of WWR values (Figure 3), it can be 
stated that the bulk of façades (85%) has less than 45% of glazed surfaces and also that half of façades present a WWR 
between 16-30%.

4.2. WWR results by orientation  

WWR values by orientation have been summarized in Table 1. The extreme WWRs are found in NE 
(WWRmax=34%) and W (WWRmin=26%) orientations, without an equivalent behavior in the symmetrical orientations 
(NW and E respectively). Additionally, taking into account orientation does not lead to a reduction of the uncertainty 
in WWR, as shown by the similarity in terms of SD and VC for the whole dataset and for the longer façades (NW/NE, 
SW/SE). According to these results, it can be stated that no straightforward correlation pattern exists between 
orientation and WWR, confirming the impressions from the elevation drawings at first glance.

4.3. WWR results by date of construction 

Window-to-wall ratios values by date of construction depicted in Figure 4 are summarized in Table 2.  According 
to results, buildings dated before 1960 (periods P1, P2 and P3) present, on average, less glazed surface and less 
dispersed values than the more recent ones (P4 and P5). Additionally, it has been observed a decrease in WWR from 
the beginning of the century until the 60s (by almost 5% between P1 and P3), which is more pronounced between 
1940 and 1959 (P3). This downward trend is interrupted during the following architectonical period (P4) with an 
almost 13% increase in the average WWR between 1960 and 1979, also characterized by a rise in the dispersion of 
the dataset. Over the last decades analyzed (P5), openings size has been reduced on average, reaching values closer to 
the ones accounted in the beginning of the century (P1).  

Based on the correlation between average WWR values and architectonical periods, it can be inferred that technical 
innovations have substantially contributed to the fenestration changes. The marked increase in WWR during the 60s 
and 70s may be largely attributable to the spread of the pillars and beams concrete structure which allowed the façade 
to be relieved from its bearing function. Consequences of regulatory changes are also readable from the trends in 
WWR, as shown by the decline in the average opening size beyond 1979 linked to the entry into force of new thermal 
regulations (P5).

Conclusions 

In this paper, façade openings of an urban tissue sample from the Eixample district of Barcelona have been analyzed 
in terms of window-to-wall ratio (WWR). According to results, glazed surfaces correspond, on average, to 31% of 
urban vertical surfaces. This value underlines the relevance of fenestration regarding energy exchanges through the 
built envelope.  

The extreme heterogeneity of urban surfaces is highlighted by the remarkable dispersion in WWR values detected 
for the study case. In order to explore the variables governing this deviation, two parameters have been assessed: 
orientation and date of construction. 

Results show that façade orientation, despite its substantial influence on indoor environmental conditions, is not a 
key parameter driving the size of openings of buildings. Cerdà’s Eixample was conceived as an isotropic mesh where 
block orientation was fixed seeking “democratic” sunlight conditions. However, the solar concerns shown by the 
initial urban plan had no significant effects on the design of façades during the consolidation of the urban tissue.      

As for the influence of the date of construction on the size of openings, it has been found that the quantitative 
assessment carried out over the sample agrees with the qualitative description of fenestration given by the history of 
architecture. According to results, building system developments seem to be the most influential factors with regard 
to the occurrence of changes in the amount of glazed surfaces in building façades. In this vein, the popularization of 
concrete structure with non-load-bearing façades is readable from the increase of average WWR detected within the 
sample during the 60s and 70s. For the case study, it has been shown that regulatory changes and other socio-economic 
aspects also affect windows size, though its impact is more limited.  

Findings in this work suggest that it is possible to provide an additional reading of the urban history of a city based 
on the fenestration size. Though results obtained for Barcelona cannot be extrapolated to other locations, the existence 
of this kind of correlation is in itself interesting. In this sense, it could be revealing to repeat this study in other cities 
with a different climatic, socio-economic and technological background.  

Currently, there is a growing interest in developing energy-based studies within the urban context in response to 
the deterioration of urban life quality and global environmental crisis. However, in these investigations, the lack of 
information on real characteristics of built environments may undermine the validity and reliability of the conclusions 
drawn. Results on this paper contribute to a better knowledge of urban façade layout, providing indicative window-
to-wall ratio values helpful to enrich urban models used as a basis for energy studies.
