Abstract: Consequences of strain aging pseudoelastic NiTi wires (2.46 mm diameter) at moderate 
temperatures (near 100ºC)? 

Changes of stress-strain on aged, compared with non-aged wires, and small changes in thermal 
transformation, suggest existence of relevant strain fields. The fact that thinner wires perform differently on 
aging suggests radial dependence of strain fields. Structural measurements at CELLS-ALBA synchrotron, 
BL04 Materials Science Powder Diffraction beam-line. X-ray micro-diffraction for near 10 (µm)2 (FWHM) 
zones on cross-sections of samples done, aiming to detect residual strains as function of radial position on 
the wire. 

Results show very small changes of diffraction peaks position, with more relevant variations near the surface, 
as well as increase of line-width of peaks near surface. This might be interpreted as larger distribution of 
residual stresses at surface of wire, showing a high sensitivity of the transformation on residual stresses 
enabling defined paths of transformation 

Introduction:  Pseudoelastic NiTi wires with the same composition and transformation 
temperature but different diameter have been shown to perform differently. We look here for crystal 
structure differences and stress (strain) distribution in different diameter wires.

Experimental: Pseudo-elastic NiTi from Memry (CT, USA), a division of SAES Getters 
(Italy), previously form Special Metals Corp. (New Hartford, New York, USA). Straight-annealed wires 
2.46 mm and 0.5 mm diameter, Ni-rich (55.95 wt % Ni, balance Ti). As by DSC was 237 K. Wires in 
light oxide surface state as furnished. 

MTS 810 testing machine, in air-conditioned room. Speed of cycling: 100 s per cycle for the 2.46 mm 
diameter wire, and 20 s for the 0.5 mm diameter wire, to achieve similar conditions concerning heat 
transfer characteristic times to the ambient. Strain aging done with help of specifically designed 
devices. 

Synchrotron radiation from ALBA was used to perform micro-diffraction experiments at 25ºC 
(Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain; beam-line BL04, 2013110801 experiment on MSPD@ALBA). 
Wavelength was 0.4246 A, the beam was of near 10 µm2  (FWHM), and a CCD detector of 2048 
sections was used, each element (“pixel”) of the detector was of 79 by 79 µm. Detector was situated at 
260.5 mm of the samples with angular resolution between measured points corresponding to around 
0.01º in two-theta. 4 rings (peaks) registered, corresponding to beta phase NiTi. All the samples 
produced only the cubic beta phase peaks. The raw data was processed with the software FIT2D, to 
obtain the diffraction along a given direction, with a +/-5º integrating margin in angle along the “cake” of 
data.

Conclusions: Microstructural effects of strain aging at 100ºC, on NiTi pseudoelastric 
wires, have been looked for by micro-diffraction performed at ALBA-CELLS synchrotron radiation 
utility. The results of the measurements show that, on strain aged sample, the width of the 
diffraction peaks increase appreciably near the surface of the wires. This effect might be 
understood as the result of the high stresses and some plastic deformation during the strain 
aging, leaving a wider distribution of residual stresses near the surface of the wires. This wider 
stress distribution near the surfaces exists after the strain aging because the asymmetry of the 
surface, the existence of imperfections (mechanical defects) and oxide on the surface, which act 
as a source of non-symmetric stresses on transforming.

Low number of peaks, texture, resolution, statistics, prevented using full profile fit to strained samples.

Then we fit individual peaks to Pseudo-Voight functions.

All peaks resulted similarly, values at the end of the cross-section (near surface of the wire) have an 
increase in width. There is also a slight increase in two-theta after strain aging.

Experiments were done with the as furnished 0.5 mm dia. wire, with position steps of 50 µm. Results 
showed also a slight increase of line width and two theta angles near the lateral surface of the sample.

Then, it can be concluded that a “surface” effect exist on the microstructure of the wires (due to drawing, 
thermomechanical treatments, and surface oxidation on the wire). The effect is enhanced by strain aging, 
so it explains different mechanical behaviour (after strain aging) of wires with different diameters.
