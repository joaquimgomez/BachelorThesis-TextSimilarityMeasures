The PMV method is now the best method proposed for 
the thermal comfort evaluations, because of his genera-
lity (all the variables are considered) and of the good ac-
cord with the field studies conducted in USA and Den-
mark by the author. However, a lot of problems in the 
application of the PMV theory are open today. The in-
fluence of the climate over the concordance of the resul-
ts obtained from the PMV analysis with the field studies 
is a reality. In the recent past some authors have discus-
sed the relevance of the climate over the results, and 
the possible ways to complete the Fanger’s equations 
with an acclimatization term. In Europe, Van Hoof and 
Hensen (2005) discuss the relevance of the acclimatiza-
tion factor in temperate climate. In Mexico, Marincic, 
Ochoa and Isalgué (2005) propose a correction for the 
ACT program (a program for the evaluation of comfort 
based on the PMV method), in order to consider the ac-
climatization. The same Fanger discuss the possibility 
of correct the PMV in some climates (Fanger, 2002).
The importance of the acclimatization is really large, 
but other factors may influence the results of a PMV 
analysis. Particularly, the presence of a fast change in 
the external temperature or in the heat exchange of the 
body, can generate a strong discomfort sensation, that 
has not been fully evaluated. In this work the eventual 
addition of a “fast temperature change” term in the 
Fanger’s equations is discussed. The results obtained 
with the model are compared with field studies conduc-
ted in tree countries: Spain, Mexico and Italy.

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Overview
Considering the transition from one space into another, 
it is possible that the physiological response of the body 
assumes different forms. Particularly, when the tran-
sition crosses the zero PMV line, it is possible to feel 
an overheating or an overcooling sensation. Otherwise, 
thermal mass of the body can cause a delay in percep-
tion of the new situation. Psychological and cultural 

ABSTRACT

The sensation of comfort in buildings depends on exter-
nal and internal variables: the well-known PMV method 
relates the expected temperature with the physiological 
behavior of the human body. Some models have discus-
sed the relevance of adaptation factors, in order to ex-
plain the higher expected “good” temperature of users 
living in warm climates. The same PMV method has 
been modified for these climatic situations. An adapta-
tion term has clearly to be considered, but other effects 
are important to determine the real expected temperatu-
re. In this paper temperature changes are considered to 
play an important role determining the expected “good” 
temperature. Effects of ventilation, rapid thermal chan-
ges when people move inside or outside of a building, 
continuous change in the temperature rate in the HVAC 
controlled spaces, are investigated here. 
Results show how to determine a dT/dt dependent term, 
which has to be considering in the PMV evaluation, in 
warm as in temperate climate. These results will be com-
pared with field studies for different climates. A PID (pro-
portional integrative derivative) correction in the PMV 
predict results seem to have to be expected, to consider 
at the same time adaptation and temperature rate effects.

1. INTRODUCTION

The thermal comfort evaluation is an important need in 
architectural project and in HVAC system design. Diffe-
rent methodologies were developed in the past half of 
century, in order to approach the evaluation of comfort, 
but the more complete appears the method that utilize a 
thermal balance for the human body. The exact solution 
of the balance equation is complicated to obtain, but 
Fanger (1970) propose the values of the internal varia-
bles “skin temperature” and “heat loss by evaporation 
of sweat secretion” that lead to a comfortable sensation. 
With these values is possible to evaluate the thermal char-
ge of the body, and the consequent comfort perception.

factors also play an important role. For example, if the 
start situation locates in a +2 PMV and the final situa-
tion locates in a –1 PMV, people can feel a strong cold 
sensation in the first minutes of the transition and vote 
–2, or can feel a relief sensation and vote 0.In order 
to determine the real behavior of people, field studies 
have to be conducted. The relief sensation has probably 
a psychological origin, but a completely physiological 
definition of the transition is very difficult to obtain, due 
to the presence of expectations conditioning. Expected 
results are the choice between a gradual passage into 
the second environment and an overheating or an over-
cooling sensation. A psychological relief sensation can 
also to be expected. Figure 1 shows the possible charac-
teristic of a gradual passage, Figure 2 shows the cha-
racteristic of an overcooling. Figure 3 shows the relief 
sensation and corresponding votes. 

2.2 PMV calculation
The Fanger’s method starts from the heat balance of the 
body expressed in equation (1):
H -Ed -Esw -Ere -L -K =S    (1)

Figure 1: gradual passage from pmv 2 to pmv -0.7

were:
H: internal heat production in the human body
Ed: heat loss by water vapour diffusion through the 
skin 
Esw: heat loss by evaporation of sweat from the surface 
of the skin
Ere: respiration latent heat loss
L: respiration sensible heat loss 
K: heat transfer from the skin to the outer surface of the 
clothed body 
S: energy that the human body would have to loose or 
receive in the unit time to keep the energy balance while 
feeling comfortable, that is, assuming for the skin tem-
perature and for Esw the comfort values. 
The value S is directly connected with the PMV (Pre-
dicted Mean Vote) concept (Fanger, 1970) expressed in 
equation (2):

         (2)
were:
S: result of equation (1) in comfort conditions 
M:  metabolic power of the body. The difference bet-
ween M and H is that M is the total power production 
of the metabolism, where H is the heat production of 
the metabolism, the difference being mechanical work 
done by the body.
ADu:surface of the human body 
In dynamical conditions, the value S has to be changed 
for a new value S’:

                   (3)
were Δ is an  empiric coefficient (time dimension). A 
positive value would mean an overestimation of any 
change, and a negative value, a tracking effect, smoo-
thing fast changes.

With this new value is possible to predict a dynamical 
transition vote. Evaluation of PMV and adjusted PMV 
with the new S value was made with the EES software. 
The coefficient Δ has to be obtained from field studies, 
fitting the empiric results always with the EES software. 
More difficult appears to determine the sign of the new 
S term, as it might depend on the previous PMV, and the 
same concordance of sign between S and its variation is not 
secure, as it might also depend on the previous S or PMV. 

2.3 Experimental conditions
As first experiment, the dynamical transition from the 
external situations resumed in Table 1 (Rome), 2 (Her-
mosillo) and 3 (Barcelona) to the internal situation resu-
med in Table 4 and Table 5, was evaluated.

Internal conditions differences between Mexico and 
Europe makes the results more comparative, due to the 
different adaptation of people living in the Sonora de-
sert, that feel comfort in a different range of temperatu-
res, displaced to high values.
The experiment was conducted with students 20-25 
years old, divided in two groups. First all students voted 
outside, then one group moved inside. Past 20 minutes, 
the second group moved inside and immediately all stu-
dents voted. They voted every minute during 15 minu-
tes, and every 5 minutes during other 45 minutes. 

Clo values were estimated according to D’Ambrosio, 
Fato, Piccininni, Alfano and Cirillo (1986). Met values 
were estimated according to Fanger (1970). 
All the environmental parameters were registered during 
the experiment with Babuc and Escort systems. Type of 
experiment has also to be considered as Class II, accor-
ding to De Dear classification (De Dear, 1998).

3. RESULTS

Figures 4, 5 and 6 show the votes of students in the tree 
experiments. It has to be noted that the internal con-
ditions were not completely stable (Figs. 7-9), so the 
relation between the first and the second group is the 
fundament parameter of the analysis.

Figure 4: pmv and real votes in Hermosillo, as a function of time.

Results for PMV are something lower than the predic-
ted votes, due probably to a low estimation of the in-
crease in the metabolic rate during the transition. In the 
present case, it seems that long time in a “cold” ambient 
leads to an overestimation of cold sensation (Barcelona 
and El Hermosillo values) in most situations. In Rome, 
the evolution of temperature with time might influence 
further and avoid seeing this effect.

The influence of entering in a new environment might 
be different in the different cases studied, because of 
different conditions. Also, the 20 min in exterior condi-
tions might be insufficient in some cases, but this time 
was chosen as a compromise to avoid excessive exterior 
changes, and to avoid also boring the people involved. 
Probably the thermal mass of the body, with the delay 
that causes on the perception of the new conditions, 
plays the more important role in our experiments. It 
seems that a large time adaptation (more than one hour) 
could be present. Comparison between Mexican and 
Europe students shows the existence of an adaptation 
important correction. The expectation factor is fixed for 
the Sonora desert at 1.6, extending the Fanger (2002) 
results for the hot sensation to the cold case. 

4. DISCUSSION

The first objective of this work was the estimation of 
the Δ coefficient. It was made fitting the experimental 
curve with the EES software. This operation had two 
parts: first the temporal dependence (due to variations 
in the HVAC system control) of the thermal charge S 
present in the internal environment was substituted with 
the average value, and second the dynamical coefficient 
was evaluated in dependence from the static vote of 
the internal group, assumed as reference for the second 
group. The form selected to fit the curve was:

0.032)S(0.352epmv M/Adu +=                        (4)
to evaluate the first time dependence, and

/t]Sp)-(S0.032)[S(0.352epmv M/Adu ∆++=       (5)
to determine the coefficient Δ.
Empirical values of  S, Sp and Δ calculated are resumed 
in Table 6.
Table 6: empirical values of  S, Sp and Δ

S (W) Sp (W) Δ (s)
Rome -9.45 10 -21

Barcelona -9.30 10 -22
Hermosillo -5.20 30 -20

The negative value of the coefficient means a “smoo-
thing” or tracking effect. This might be interpreted as 
the effects of the delay caused by the thermal mass of the 
body. However, it is a common idea that, in some cases, 
to enter in a cold environment coming from a very hot 
one may lead to an “under cooling” sensation. This is not 
observed here, but more experiments have to be done, 
with different values of the change of solicitation S-Sp.

5. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

The obtained results show that, in the considered cases, 
the most important thing in considering the time varia-
tions is the “smoothing” which manifest in the first 20 
minutes in the new environment. Due to the conditions 
present, we think that more experiments have to be done. 
Transitions from cold to warm have also to be studied, 
for various differences of temperature. A further task 
will be the comparison between the Fanger’s method 
and others methods like ACT in dynamical situations. 
Normally, adaptive methods are based on the difference 
between an equivalent temperature (dependent on the 
parameters of the environment) and a desired tempe-
rature (dependent on the factors of the perception, in-
cluding expectations). This fact permit to adjust the 
difference between the two temperatures by adding an 
average term, which takes in account the adaptation, di-
rectly related with the yearly or monthly average tem-
perature. PMV is calculated in ACT by equation (6)

were:
Te = equivalent temperature sensed by users
Td = desired temperature of the users                       
Taking into account the dynamical transition and also 
the adaptation, it is possible to propose the form of a 
PID (proportional integrative derivative) processor for 
the total complex behavior of the human body. 
So, the proposed equations can be 

             (7)                  
for the Fanger’s adjusted method, and                            

            (8)                
for the adaptive adjusted methods.
Comparison between PMV obtained from adaptive and 
PMV obtained from Fanger’s adjusted methods will 
shows the goodness of the adaptive approach, which is 
clearly less rigorous (in physical sense) than the balance 
approach of Fanger.

6. CONCLUSION

Field studies over the comfort sensation are an impor-
tant verification of the ideas that were developed in the 
numerous investigations on human relation with the en-
vironment. Dynamical evaluations require also a very 

large number of experiments, which have just started. 
Only when a large database is obtained, it would be pos-
sible a really critical discussion over the questions rela-
ted. In this way authors program to work continuously 
on the themes opened with this first approach. As a final 
conclusion, it is possible to say that people vote under 
a lot of conditions and conditioning, with differences 
from the actual prediction obtainable from the theories. 
Separate physical phenomena and psychological expec-
tation in order to understand how the different factors 
influence the perception is also an important need, in 
times of energy savings attention and comfort request.
