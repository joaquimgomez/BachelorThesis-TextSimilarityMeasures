This work applies the variational principles of Lagrange and Hamilton to the assessment of numerical methods of linear structural
analysis. Different numerical methods are used to simulate the behaviour of three structural configurations and benchmarked in
their computation of the Lagrangian action integral over time. According to the principle of energy conservation, the difference
at each time step between the kinetic and the strain energies must equal the work done by the external forces. By computing this
difference, the degree of accuracy of each combination of numerical methods can be assessed. Moreover, it is often difficult to
perceive numerical instabilities due to the inherent complexities of the modelled structures. By means of the proposed procedure,
these complexities can be globally controlled and visualized in a straightforward way. The paper presents the variational principles
to be considered for the collection and computation of the energy-related parameters (kinetic, strain, dissipative, and external
work). It then introduces a systematic framework within which the numerical methods can be compared in a qualitative as well as
in a quantitative manner. Finally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted using three simple 2D models subjected to the
effect of four different dynamic loadings.

1. Introduction

1.1. Targets and Interest of Our Research. Variational mechan-
ics date back as far as the Eighteenth Century, when Leibniz,
Euler, Maupertuis, and Lagrange devised the calculus of vari-
ations and the principles of least action. This methodology
of treating physical phenomena is based on the notion that
everything in nature tends to a state of minimal energy [1].

In structural engineering practice, there is a preference
to use forces and accelerations rather than energy concepts.
Unfortunately, this approach often limits our understanding
of the phenomena, as, for example, in the case of earthquakes,
damage is a function of the square of the velocity, and not so
much of the acceleration [2].

In parallel we will deal with a systematic treatment of the
numerical methods which have proliferated since the 1950s
with the ever-increasing power of computers. This ceaseless
growth in numbers and terminology has given place to a
cumbersome mix of mathematics, physics, and computer

science that is often difficult to grasp. We have used our work
to propose a possible categorization according to the physical
qualities which they represent instead of according to their
mathematical properties.

1.2. Variational Mechanics. According to the principles of
variational mechanics [3], the difference between kinetic
energy and strain energy in a structural system equals the
appliedwork due to external forces. In this way, by computing
the energy scalars and carefully accounting for this difference
at each time step, one should be able to infer the degree of
accuracy of a simulation [4].

The correct values should not in any case diverge much
from zero, and deviations from this value would give us an
idea about how accurate and stable a method is.

1.3. Numerical Methods for Structural Analysis. In previous
works published by the authors [5, 6], it was shown how the
vast amount of existing numerical methods can be grouped



2 Advances in Mechanical Engineering

into three main sets according to the kind of physical phe-
nomena they represent and the type of differential equations
they discretize: matter integration techniques (partial dif-
ferential equations), constraint integration techniques (alge-
braic differential equations), and time integration techniques
(ordinary differential equations).

Based on this concept, we have chosen the following
matter integration implementations: finite element (FEM),
finite differences (FDM), and mass spring systems (MSS).
For the constraint integration we will limit ourselves to the
constraint reduction (CR) technique, whereas, in the case of
time integration we will study the Newmark Beta (NB),
Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT), Chung-Hulbert’s generalized-
alpha (CH), and WilsonTheta (WTH) methods.

All these time integration methods are available in a
general-purpose commercial package, so we were able to
establish a comparative reference for our own implementa-
tions. In the case of matter integration, we implemented our
own algorithms from the literature and adapted them to our
own purposes, also making a previous benchmark of their
results with respect to those obtained by the aforementioned
software.

1.4. Numerical Experiments. Three simple structural models
under four dynamic loadings will be tested. The influence of
the parameters time step, damping ratio, and the number of
integration points will be studied.

The work done by the load patterns, along with the
internal elastic, kinetic, and dissipative energies, will be com-
puted at each time step and combined together to verify the
Hamiltonian energy balance. Its integral through time will
provide different values of the total Lagrangian action of the
structure-loads system. The deviation from a proposed ana-
lytical value, whose computation is straightforward, would
account for the level of accuracy of the implementations.

It will be shown how, whether used on single elements
or complex systems with more elements, this methodology
could be employed as a reference since the value of the action
is a simple scalar which is easy to monitor.

2. Variational Mechanics

2.1. Principle of Least Action. In variational mechanics, the
Lagrangian functional𝐿, describing the dynamics of a system,
is given by

𝐿 = 𝑇 − 𝑈, (1)

where 𝑇 and 𝑈 are the kinetic and potential energies of the
system, respectively.

According toHamilton’s definition, action 𝑆 is the integral
through the studied time lapse of the Lagrangian

𝑆 = ∫

𝑡
2

𝑡
1

(𝑇 − 𝑈) 𝑑𝑡. (2)

The correct path for a dynamic system is the one forwhich
the value of the action integral is stationary. This leads to
a minimization problem which is rooted in the variational
principles of Lagrange and Euler.

2.2. Euler-Lagrange Equation and Energy Balance. For a
single particle-spring system subject to an external force, the
Lagrangian can be written as

𝐿 (𝑥, �̇�) =
1

2
𝑚 ⋅ �̇�
2
−
1

2
𝑘 ⋅ 𝑥
2
, (3)

where 𝑚 is the mass of the particle, 𝑘 is the stiffness of the
spring, 𝑥 is the instantaneous position, and the superscript
dot indicates derivation with respect to time.

From Hamilton’s principle of stationary action, and after
some variational calculus, the evolution of a physical system
is described by the solutions of the forced Euler-Lagrange
equation for the action of the system:

𝑑

𝑑𝑡

𝜕𝐿 (𝑥, �̇�)

𝜕�̇�
−
𝜕𝐿 (𝑥, �̇�)

𝜕𝑥
= 𝑄ext (𝑥, �̇�) , (4)

where

𝜕𝐿 (𝑥, �̇�)

𝜕𝑥
=
𝑑𝑈 (𝑥)

𝑑𝑥
=

𝑑𝑇 (�̇�)

𝑑�̇�

𝑑

𝑑�̇�
(
1

2
𝑚 ⋅ �̇�
2
) , (6)

𝑄ext (𝑥, �̇�) = −𝑐 ⋅ �̇� + 𝑓ext (𝑡) . (7)

Substituting (5), (6), and (7) into (4), and deriving (5)with
respect to time, we get the Newtonian classical formulation:

𝑑

𝑑𝑡

𝜕𝐿

𝜕�̇�
−
𝜕𝐿

𝜕𝑥
= 𝑚 ⋅ �̈� + 𝑐 ⋅ �̇� + 𝑘 ⋅ 𝑥 − 𝑓ext (𝑡) = 0, (8)

where the externally applied force 𝑓ext is generally given, and
the velocity dependent damping term is a nonconservative
force defined in terms of d’Alembert’s virtual work [7].

2.3. Kinetic Energy of a System, 𝑇. For a structural system
under dynamic forces, the above equations are used in a
vector-matrix fashion. Each of the points of the structure and
its degrees of freedom are represented as terms of a vector,
and the mass and stiffness of the whole system are character-
ized by amatrix.This leads to the following expression for the
computation of the kinetic term:

𝑇 =
1

2
⋅ {�̇�}
𝑇
⋅ [𝑀] ⋅ {�̇�} , (9)

where {�̇�} is the vector of the velocities obtained.
In the present work, the construction of the mass matrix

consists of the simple addition of the elements’ particular
masses in their concurrent nodes (lumped mass matrix).

2.4. Elastic Potential Energy, 𝑈. When a body of some
material is subject to external forces, its internal structure is
deformed. The displacement of these forces in space is the
source of performed work.

The scalar value of suchwork, in order to preserve the bal-
ance of energy, must be equal to that of the internal forces in
the body (stresses) times the internal displacements within
the material (strains).

Figure 1: Stress-strain components in a beam.The directions of the infinitesimal strains and stresses are arranged according to the length of
the beam.

The energy that is not recoverable is commonly dissipated
in the form of heat. However, for the sake of simplicity the
scope of this paper will be limited to the elastic range.

In elastic materials, the stored potential strain energy can
be accounted for as half of the integral over the volume of the
internal strains times the internal stresses.The corresponding
formula is [8]

𝑈el =

where

{𝜎}

{𝜀}
𝑇
= {𝜀𝑥𝑥 𝜀𝑦𝑦 𝜀𝑧𝑧 𝛾𝑥𝑦 𝛾𝑥𝑧 𝛾𝑦𝑧} . (12)

In the case of the linearized beam depicted in Figure 1,
we can define four kinds of strain energy according to the
four main stress components: axial (𝑁), shear (𝑄), bending
moment (𝑀), and torsional moment (𝑇).

In Table 1, the formulae for each of these strain energy
components are given. The listed expressions can be either a
function of the displacements along the beam or of the input
forces.

For a structural system, where several elements are com-
bined and attached in 𝑛 nodes, the equations that establish
the behaviour of each node with respect to others are defined
in the stiffness matrix [𝐾].

The coefficients that compose this matrix are obtained
through the different matter integration methods (FEM,
FDM, MSS, BEM, etc.) by solving the above equations in a
combination for all three kinds of stresses in all three planes
[9].

Finally, in order to compute the total elastic energy 𝑈 of
the system, the following expression:

𝑈 =
1

2
{𝑥}
𝑇
⋅ [𝐾] ⋅ {𝑥} (13)

is used, where {𝑥} is the vector of the displacements obtained.

2.5. Work Done by Dissipative Forces. In every real structure
the existence of damping is a well-known phenomenon



4 Advances in Mechanical Engineering

whose nature is still not fully understood. In order to incorpo-
rate it into a simulation, numerical artefacts are createdwhich
can account for the energetic dissipation involved.

In general, a damping matrix [𝐶] is defined which
accounts for the dissipative properties of the structural ele-
ments. This matrix affects the velocity in Newton’s equation
(8), behaving as a forcewhich acts against the applied external
forces.

The work done by this force can be accounted for by
means of the following relation:

𝑅 =
1

2
{𝑥}
𝑇
⋅ [𝐶] ⋅ {�̇�} . (14)

The simplestmodel for dissipation in structural dynamics
is due to Lord Rayleigh and is known as “linear damping,”
“Rayleigh damping,” or “classical damping.” In this ideali-
zation, the damping matrix is assumed to be a linear com-
bination of the stiffness and the mass matrices. Despite the
numerous criticisms this model receives, it is still widely used
for its convenience when combined with the modal analysis
procedure [10]. Once the stiffness matrix [𝐾] and the mass
matrix [𝑀] are ready, the damping matrix [𝐶] can be defined
as follows:

[𝐶] = 𝛼 ⋅ [𝑀] + 𝛽 ⋅ [𝐾] . (15)

The value of the mass and stiffness coefficients is deter-
mined by the solution of the eigenvalues of the [𝐾] matrix
[10].

2.6. Work Done by External Forces. The total work exerted
over a structure by the external applied forces can also be
represented in a vectorial fashion as

𝑊ext =
1

2
{𝐹ext} ⋅ {𝑥} . (16)

In general, the vector of the external forces is known for
each time step.

2.7. Total Action of the System, Energy Balance, and the
Lagrange-d’Alembert Principle. In order to account for the
correctness of a simulation, we can utilize the Lagrange-
d’Alembert principle [11], which establishes the following
relation:

𝛿∫

𝑡
2

𝑡
1

𝐿 𝑑𝑡 + ∫

𝑡
2

𝑡
1

𝐹ext𝛿𝑥 𝑑𝑡 = 0. (17)

If we withdraw the variation operator and rearrange the
terms, this leads to

∫

ated physical notions. The arrow represents a possible sequence of
methods for a dynamics simulation.

Having defined previously each of the terms, we can now
write an elementary formula from which the degree of
exactness of a simulation can be estimated:

(𝑇 − 𝑈) 𝑑𝑡 = −

∑

This is basically the computation of an energy balance,
where the Hamiltonian action is treated, in its discrete form,
as an average over time of each instantaneous Lagrangian.
In order to account for the external forces involved, we also
integrate their work over time. According to d’Alembert’s
principle, these two measures should be equal when internal
dissipative forces (hysteretic damping) are not present.

It is noteworthy how (20) also represents the first law of
thermodynamics, where the value of heat (in this case added
to the structure) can be associated with the kinetic energy of
the system.

Any divergence from this equality gives a measure as to
how inaccurate a numerical method is by means of a single
value, without the need to find simplified analytical models
whose assumptions rarely fit the real problems of engineering
practice.

3. Numerical Methods

As explained in previous works by the authors [5, 6], for the
simulation of structural dynamics three different physical
notions need to be integrated: time, matter, and kinematic
constraints.

Figure 2 shows a schematic of the process involved and its
relation to the physical concepts of time, matter and con-
straints. Also for convenience, a list of abbreviations for
existing numerical methods is provided in Table 2.

3.1. Matter Integration. To describe the dynamics of matter
we have an infinite number of degrees of freedom because
the particles that compose it can have arbitrary displacements
with respect to each other. Such systems are described using

partial differential equations (PDEs), where the time and
spatial coordinates are related. These general partial differ-
ential equations, which are applicable to any solid or fluid
material, are derived from the constitutive laws which apply
to the material.

For the solution of these equations, two different
approaches can be taken in order to control the number of
degrees of freedom (i.e., discretize): creating a mesh where
thematerial displacements are limited (mesh basedmethods)
or establishing the equations in the form of potential func-
tions so that they compose a system of particles that regulate
each other (mesh free methods) [12, 13].

We have limited our study to three mesh based methods
with different discretization schemes: finite element method
(FEM), finite differences method (FDM), and a mass spring
system (MSS).

For the general computation of nodal displacements and
rotations, a framework employing the direct stiffness method
(DSM) was prepared [14].

In our case, where beam elements were used, the analyt-
ical solution of Bernoulli-Euler is lumped into local element
matrices that are ultimately assembled into a global stiffness
matrix [8].

For FEM implementation, the description of the elastic
deformation of the beam is based on a Hermite interpolation
polynomial obtained from [3].

FDM establishes the relations between stations along the
beam as a sequence of equations that form a linear system
which is easily invertible [9, 15].

MSS is somewhatmore complex since it requires previous
discretization of the beam into a set of connected tetrahedra,
but from the point of view of physics its results are clearer as
the assumptions are that the nodes are simply connected by

bars with a characteristic Young’s modulus and area [16].
Some adjustments had to be made to the position of the
masses in the cross section so that the inertia of the section
would match the value assigned in the polynomial-based
methods.

The global nodal displacements and rotations computed
by means of DSM were transformed ultimately into local
coordinates and served as input variables for each of the three
methods above.

3.2. Kinematic Constraints Integration. In order to obtain the
internal strains and stresses, bodies are subject to kinematic
constraints. In this way a set of differential algebraic equations
(DAEs), comprising the PDEs mentioned in the previous
chapter, is assembled in the respective stiffness, mass, and
damping matrices:

Equation (21) showsDAE integration by constraint reduction
(CR). The global stiffness matrix of the system is made
nonsingular by symmetrically subtracting the columns and
rows corresponding to the constrained degrees of freedom
(𝐾𝑔: original matrix; 𝐾𝑔redd: modified reduced nonsingular
matrix). Consider

Equation (22) shows DAE integration by Lagrange multipli-
ers (LM). The global stiffness matrix is made nonsingular by
symmetrically adding columns and rows where unit values
are placed in the location of the constrained degrees of
freedom (𝐾𝑔: original matrix; 𝐾𝑔ext: modified extended
nonsingular matrix). Consider

𝐾𝑔 =

Equation (23) shows DAE integration by penalty method
(PM). The singularity of the global stiffness matrix is treated
by scaling the diagonal elements of the constrained degrees of
freedom with a very large number (𝐾𝑔: orginal matrix;𝐾𝑔sc:
modified scaled nonsingular matrix).

There is vast a amount of literature dedicated to explain
different schema from which stable, accurate, and faster
formulations can be constructed [12]. In general terms,
Newton’s equation is manipulated in one way or another to
isolate one of its terms. The possibilities are to do it either at
the acceleration level, at the velocity level, or at the position
level.

In themost common acceleration level schemes, predom-
inance is given to the methods of constraint reduction (CR),
Lagrange multipliers (LM), and penalty method (PM).

In all three methods the strategy is to alter the stiffness,
damping, and mass matrices in such a way that they become
invertible (after assembly, the stiffness matrix is symmetrical
and singular).

By means of CR one simply removes from the stiffness
and mass matrices the rows and columns corresponding to
the constrained degrees of freedom, hence reducing it in size.

Similarly, the LM method increases the size of the
system of equations in as many rows and columns as there
are constrained degrees of freedom in the model. These
“attached” vectors are zero in all their elements, except for
those corresponding to the aforementioned DOFs, where a
value in the range [0, 1) is inserted.

Regarding the Penalty Method, the corresponding ele-
ments of the diagonal are replaced with values that have sev-
eral orders ofmagnitude larger than those initially assembled.

as smooth displacement behaviour often conceals energy conservation violations.

and damping ratio = 1%. Analysis in the energy domain not only gives a global view of the structural behaviour but also accounts for possible
points of numerical instability and irregularities of the simulation.

Equation (23) and Figures 3 and 4 provide a visualization
of these methodologies as they are commonly implemented.
Further analysis on their advantages and drawbacks can be
found in [17].

3.3. Time Integration. Integration over time in a structural
dynamics simulation reduces to the solution for each time
step of an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The first
possible classification forODEs solvers distinguishes between

explicit, implicit, and hybrid methods. This division arises
as a consequence of the so-called numerical stiffness. This
phenomenon forces the size of the adopted time step to be
so small that convergence is never reached; or otherwise, the
adopted time steps are so large that the simulation becomes
unstable. This can be caused by the physical characteristics
of the system (components with large differences in their
masses, stiffness, and/or damping). However, in many other
instances, stiffness is numerically induced due to either the

equations of motion, or sudden or accumulated violations in
the constraint conditions.

Explicit methods present this kind of problem. The
advantage of implicit methods is that they are usually more
stable for solving a stiff equation, meaning also that a larger
step size can be used. Nevertheless, extra computations need
to be performed internally, thus requiring extra time.

For our comparison we have used the methods available
in a general purpose commercial package: Newmark Beta
(NB), Wilson Theta (WTH), Hilbert Hughes Taylor (HHT),
and Chung and Hulbert (CH). We implemented our algo-
rithms from [17–21]. The results obtained were in very good
agreement with those of the commercial package.

4. Numerical Experiments and Results

In this chapter we provide the results of our numerical exper-
iments, where several combinations of methods were used
in diverse simulations. Three different specimens of increas-
ing complexity were tested, and some engineering relevant
parameters affecting each numerical method were system-
atically studied (time step, damping ratio, and number of
integration points).

In order to avoid excessive complexity, the specimens
were treated as 2D models and kept within the elastic range,
considering the shear effects in deformation to be negligible.

4.1. The Studied Specimens. As mentioned above, and for
the sake of simplicity, we omitted material and geometrical
nonlinearities from our analyses.

The material and geometric properties shown in Table 3
are common in engineering practice, with values similar to
those of a 200 × 200 × 2mm hollow extruded steel bar.

The geometric configuration of eachmodel is displayed in
Figure 3, in order of increasing complexity.

Notwithstanding the obvious resemblance to a typical
structural engineering application, the generality of our work
and its potential use in the simulation of any mechanical
object regardless of size or shape should be noted. However,
the choice of parameters to characterize the strain energy
must be judicious in order to achieve adequate stiffness and
mass matrices.

Model A. The simplest model of choice for our research was
a 387,5 cm long cantilever column under a lateral loading
acting in its tip. The cantilever model is extensively utilized
for the validation of numerical methods in the literature.

with identical geometrical and mechanical properties for
each beam element as in the previous case. The load 𝐹 is
applied to the upper left corner.

Model C. The more complex three bay-four storey frame is
also shown in Figure 3. Its properties are again those pre-
sented in Table 3, and load 𝐹 is also applied to the upper left

In order to represent the structural dissipative behaviour,
Rayleigh damping was implemented according to [10]. It is
based on modal analysis and uses the first two natural
frequencies of the structure under study. The ones applicable
to our models are listed in Table 4.

For comparison purposes, a frequency response function
was computed for all threemodels. Its values are in agreement
with those of the modal analysis of Table 4 as can be seen in
Figure 4. It can be inferred from this figure that the more
complex model C has the highest sensitivity to low frequen-
cies, whereas models A and B should behave similarly as they
have their strongest response to similar frequency values.

4.2. Transient Input Forces. A load 𝐹 of 10 KN applied to the
tip of each specimen was scaled at each time step with an
input signal of variable amplitude.

As presented in Figures 5, 6, 7, and 8, four input signals
were devised in order to stimulate the loading of our system:
a simple sine function, a simple sine function suddenly
interrupted, an incremental triangular function, and a ramp
pulse, all of them spanning through five seconds.

A sine function with such a low frequency is seldom
encountered in engineering practice, but allows for the
calibration and tuning of the combined methods given its
smoothness and clarity.

For the second signal, after completion of the first period
it is interrupted abruptly in order to allow for free vibration
of the system. The point of interruption, in zero amplitude,
allows for observation of the effect of kinetic energy on the
simulation.

The incremental triangular function was constructed in
order to account for earthquake engineering regulations,
where sudden changes and peaks are to be simulated.

Regarding the last pulse, it makes it possible to compare
the performance of the numerical methods simulating free
vibration and the effect of resonance.

4.3. Parametric Sensitivity Study. The significant parameters
involved in the numerical computations have been iteratively
modified in order to assess their influence in the simulations.
For each type of integration the following parameters were
studied:

(i) Time integration:

(a) time step influence,
(b) damping ratio influence.

(ii) Matter integration:

(a) number of integration points along the beam
element.

(iii) Constraint integration:

(a) no comparison was available, as only the con-
straint reduction technique is implemented in
the reference software.

Table 5 shows the values used for the characteristic parame-
ters of each numerical method in all the simulations.

These values were not the subject of our study and
were fixed according to recommended values from the
literature [18–21]. It is important to note that Chung-Hulbert’s
method (also known as Generalized-Alpha) under certain
combinations of parameters includes previous ones, whose
performances are, according to [21], less accurate when low
frequency excitation is present.

4.4. Methodology: Energy Computation of a Simulation. The
evaluation of instantaneous energetic magnitudes provides
a very holistic hindsight into the behaviour of a simulation,
which is qualitatively superior to that of the displacement
domain towhich time history analysis is traditionally limited.

Besides, in the case of the single cantilever beam choosing
the tip as the observed target is generally straightforward, but
for more complex arrangements like, say, models B and C,
this is not so trivial. The common choice of a “representative
point” (the centre ofmass of each storey, conversion to SDOF,
etc.) has a definition which is always difficult and elaborate.

As an example, simple observation of the displacement
behaviour of the tip of Model A would mislead the analyst
to the conclusion that the results for signal 4 in Figure 9
are better approximations than those for signal 3, as the
displacement values seem to be closer to the analytical ones.

Nevertheless, this can be proven to be less accurate than
expected. Figure 10 shows the same simulation in the energy
domain, computing some operators of the different terms
from Section 2. The application of (20) appears in Figure 10
as 𝑊 + 𝑇 − 𝑈 − 𝑅. From this operator one can obtain
that, on average, under signal 4 the simulation “creates”
+0.69N cm of spurious energy on each time step, whereas
the same model, under signal 3—visibly more flurry in the
displacement domain, “absorbs”−1.12N cm fromnowhere. In
terms of absolute value, the first is closer to zero, apparently
still showing a better approximation for signal 4. However,
a rigorous computation should also take into account that
the total amount of work applied by signal 3 is, on average,
three times larger than that of signal 4. It is not equivalent
to a large average deviation from zero with large values as
it is with smaller ones. The formulation of an independent
normalization parameter will be provided.

To define our measure of error we use (9), (13), (14), and
(16) at each time step to compute the respective instantaneous
values of kinetic energy (𝑇), strain energy (𝑈), dissipative
energy (𝑅), and external work (𝑊).

Our methodology, based on (20), uses the Hamiltonian
action integral minus the average over time of the work due
to the externally applied forces, thusmeasuring the difference
to zero.

Moving the Lagrangian (𝑇-𝑈) term to the right hand side
and including the damping term, we obtain:

𝜖 (𝑡) = 𝑊ext (𝑡) + 𝑇 (𝑡) − 𝑈 (𝑡) − 𝑅 (𝑡) , (24)

whose discrete integral in time gives

𝑡
2

∑

𝑡
1

𝜖 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 =

𝑡
2

∑

𝑡
1

[𝑊ext (𝑡) + (𝑇 (𝑡) − 𝑈 (𝑡) − 𝑅 (𝑡))] 𝑑𝑡. (25)

However, this value is, by itself, not yet very representative. As
mentioned before, in the case of large values of external work,
epsilon also yields large values. For this reason, a normaliza-
tion parameter was devised. It is based on the total work done
by the external forces, but computed independently from the
displacements and based on (13) and (16). It is obtained by
isolating the displacement vector in each equation:

{𝑥}
2
= 2𝑈 ⋅ [𝐾]

−1
, (26)

{𝑥} = 2𝑊ext ⋅ {𝐹ext}
−1

. (27)

By combining (26) and (27) it is now possible to define
our reference input work parameter:

𝑊ref = 2
𝑊
2

ext
𝑈

= {𝐹ext}
𝑇

⌊𝐾⌋
−1
⋅ {𝐹ext} .

(28)

This reference work is completely self-contained and does not
rely on the numerical method used to do the simulation, as
the vector of the external forces and the stiffness matrix are
given data.

Once this value is defined, it is possible to establish
a measure of the error that is consistent regardless of the
numerical method, applied force, or desired model of study.

The applied formula for each of our comparisons is then
as follows:

Error =
100 ⋅ ∑

𝑡
1

𝑡
0

𝜖 𝑑𝑡

∑
𝑡
1

𝑡
0

𝑊ref 𝑑𝑡
. (29)

Other options for the value of epsilon are also available.
Similarly, one could compute (20) using the Hamiltonian
(𝑇 + 𝑈 + 𝑅) and subtracting it from the applied work. Its
time history is shown in Figure 10 as 𝑊 − (𝑇 + 𝑈 + 𝑅).
This operator provides a lower bound for the evolution of the
Lagrangian (most clearly visible for signal 4), as it balances
the kinetic energy of the system against the potential and the
dissipative energies. Its evolution in time gives information
about whether the absolute value of the kinetic term is
overestimated at each step. Given that the mass is kept
constant this operator permits to verify that instantaneous
velocities are computed correctly.

Another possible option for the value of epsilon is to
calculate the instantaneous increment of the Hamiltonian,
𝑑(𝑇 + 𝑈 + 𝑅). In systems where the energy is constant, this
value should be zero, but it is rarely the case in practical
applications. Its main interest resides in the detection of
segments in the simulation where the smooth transition from
one time step to the next is lost.

One could also define the epsilon on each time step as
the difference between the time-dependent calculated work
and our presented analytical reference work (𝑊ref − 𝑊). In
a way, this computation appears the most precise, as the
involved terms are of the same kind and the reference work is
derived from a numerically neutral relationship. Apart from
the possible error in the inversion of the stiffness matrix, the
term 𝑊ref is immune to the fluctuations caused by the time
integrators. Still, this operator is not fully satisfactory. As the
possible errors in the instantaneous work only depend on
the computed displacement, its time history only provides
information about irregularities in this matter.

The choice, then, of the Lagrangian (minus the damping
energy when applicable) to balance the external work seems
the most appropriate. Not only is its time history a valuable
source of information for the analysis of irregularities in a
simulation but also its integral in time provides a single scalar
whose value should be zero. Given that the energetic terms
are all positive, a positive value of this integral can only be
caused by an average overestimation of the kinetic term (i.e.,
the velocities) against the displacements. Similarly, a negative
value tells us to what degree displacements are unbalanced
against velocities, as the internal potential energy is a direct
function of them.

4.5. Numerical Results: Influence of Time Step. According
to the methodology exposed above, a thorough parametric
study was carried using the three models of choice. Figures
11, 12, and 13 present the values obtained from iteratively
modifying the time step between values of 0.00125 s and 0.15 s
for each numerical method, with a constant damping ratio
value of 2%.

As opposed to the analyst’s intuition, in spite of dealing
with linear models we obtained curves that vary significantly
from one method to another. Nevertheless, and as expected,
this divergence is more pronounced with larger time steps
and also increases with the complexity of the model.

The character positive or negative of the value of the error
also provides a valuable source of information, as it tells us
when the internal strain energy is larger or smaller than the
sum of the kinetic energy plus the external work. As this
term is dependent on velocity, it shows when the kinetic
term is overestimated or underestimated. In other words, the
higher the decoupling between velocity anddisplacement, the
further the simulation is from correctness.

When the time step is larger, it affects the velocity, which
loses or gains in phasewith the normalmodes of the structure
and with the input signal. In these cases the simulationmight
either dissipate or absorb energy artificially.This explains the

the simulations.

In terms of evaluation of the particular methods, it is
commonly accepted that CH has better performance than
the others, as it gives the analyst control over the numerical
damping for high frequencies without loss of accuracy. As the
sensitivity to those parameters was not within the scope of
this study, we cannot give a view about such effect, but we can
point out how, in general, in this configuration they all show
fairly similar results, only diverging significantly for larger
and impractical time steps. Although all of them are of the
implicit type, meaning unconditional stability regardless of
the time step size, our results show how this set of methods in
general tends to sacrifice energy conservation. In most linear
structural dynamics problems it is still not an issue, but for
the analysis of nonlinear situations we strongly recommend
the use of more modern integrators of the symplectic type, as
those described in [22].

4.6. Numerical Results: Influence of the Damping Ratio.
It should be noted that the damping considered in our
experiments is of an external nature, given the fact that no
material nonlinearities have been taken in to consideration.
The corresponding Rayleigh mass and stiffness coefficients

defined in (27) were obtained according to [10]. Figure 14
shows the relation of these values to the models used in the
study.

The sensitivity of the numerical methods to variations in
the damping ratio is presented in Figures 15, 16, and 17. For
all three models the range of study was fixed between 0% to
10% of critical damping. In general, this is sufficient for all
the methods to reach their asymptotic limit in almost every
simulation. For models A and B a value of 2% of damping
suffices to achieve stable behaviour with an error of less than
0.3%, which can be considered very acceptable.

4.7. Numerical Results: Influence of the Number of Integration
Points for Matter Integration Methods. For the study of the
matter integration techniques a similar approach based on the
variational principle of actionwas adopted.However, here the
definition of a reference parameter 𝑊ref was not required as
the analytical solution for beam elements is available applying
the concepts of Section 2.4.

Instead, we computed a global action term, whose units
are also those of angular momentum. It is defined as

Figure 18: Comparison of error in angularmomentum computation formatter integrationmethods against the number of integration points.
Analytical (ANA) versus finite differences (FDM) versus finite element (FEM) versus mass spring system (MSS).

The charts in Figure 18 were made by computing the
instantaneous value of internal work corresponding to each
different numerical method and averaging it over time. The
applied transient force was signal 1.

The measure of the error was computed as a percentage
of the difference to the analytical value. A positive error
indicates numerical spurious dissipation of energy, whereas
a negative error stands for artificial energy creation.

As expected, for an increasing number of integration
points the methods converge towards the analytical value.
However, they do it in an asymptotic fashion, reaching an
almost flat parallel value after about 25 integration points. In
general, the obtained error values remain below 5% for all the
methods, which is completely acceptable in practice.

Interestingly, FEM presents the best behaviour only for
the simple cantilever beam, creating spurious strain energy
for the other two models.

FDM andMSS tend to dissipate energy in all cases, which
means that, in general, they result in an underestimated value
of displacement by about 2%, remaining on the unsafe side.

5. Discussion and Future Work

The total Hamiltonian actions of three systems under
transient loadings have been computed for each possible
combination of methods. A comparison was made on the
basis of energy principles. It was shown how variational
principles and an energetic norm can be employed in an
easy and efficient manner to benchmark and assess the
accuracy and stability of different implementations. The
scheme provided, tested in three simple examples, is trivially
extensible tomore complex systems wheremore elements are
present.The advantage of this approach is that it allows for the
monitoring of the global behaviour by means of one simple
scalar. Also, a conceptual framework for the classification and
treatment of numerical methods, grouping them into time,
matter, and constraint integrators, was used for systematic
analysis of the results. It was also shown how methods of a
different nature and concept can be compared using the same
theoretical background.The accuracy and good performance
of time and matter integration methods are generally taken
for granted, as it is difficult, in the displacement domain,

to assess them with certainty. Future work will aim at the
application of the same methodology in material nonlinear
analysis and in structures of higher complexity.
