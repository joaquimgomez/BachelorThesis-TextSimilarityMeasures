Introduction
In a marine terminal, logistics of container movements 
and arrangement can certainly affect the benefit

Container logistics management understood from the 
time that a container is discharged at a port, can be 
defined as a set of financial transactions, and based on 
the logistic principle that every movement generates a 
cost

Can cost of passage and stay of a container at a 
terminal be reduced ?

Given the land cost, the machinery, the labour…



Formulation of the problem

20 and 40 foot containers. The TEU.

20-foot-long (6.1 m) and 8 feet (2.44 m) wide
(exact length is 19 feet 10.5 inches (6.058 m) )

Height: between 4 feet 3 inches (1.30 m) and 9 feet 6 inches (2.90 m)
The most common height is 8 feet 6 inches (2.59 m)

20 foot: 24000 kilograms max.

40 foot: 30480 kilograms max.

90% of containers in ships are 40 foot units 
Some 80% of the world's freight moves via 40 foot containers

Heavy loads (twenty foot units) with a maximum mass of 30500 kg



Formulation of the problem

Transport at sea by containers: different phases, summarized as:

-Filling of the container (packaging of goods in the containers)

-Arrival at a terminal (concentration of containers by road / train)

-Handling in the terminal (at the yard) -> modern machinery

-It is rarely known where inside a ship (bay, row, and tier) a given container 
would be transported, at the moment of arrival at the terminal. 

-Management of knowledge might imply reduction in shifting/reordering
containers to be loaded in a ship, information could be used to reduce cost. 

-Restrictions: location of reefers, hazardous and over sized containers.
-Nowadays technology comprises Gantry cranes at port (sea-side), straddle 

carriers (SCs), forklifts  top loaders, rubber-tyre and rail-mounted gantries (RTG 
and RMG), and tractor-trailers for movements and stacking at the terminal yard.



Formulation of the problem
-Loading ship: the master bay plan problem (stability/safety of ship)

Information processing and computation technology (stability), use of 
modern machinery to move the containers, from the yard terminal.

-Ship routes and alterations to avoid bad weather
important, but are not considered here.

-Unloading of a ship uses modern machinery, the same as the loading 
process, and is strongly conditioned by the previous loading process. 

-Handling in the terminal (at the yard), uses modern machinery and 
related to the intermodality (out of the port terminal, train and trucks)

-Distribution on land side (done with road and train)

-Distribution of goods from the container (emptying the containers)



Formulation of the problem

Location of a container:

In the ship:

Bay, row, tier

In the Terminal (at the yard):

the block, the bay, the row and the tier.
Maximum tier: 5-6

Reshuffles (or re-handles)



Formulation of the problem

The average daily yard utilization of large container 
terminals in Europe is about 10.000–20.000 containers 

resulting in about 15.000 movements per day. 

The time of containers in the yard is in the range of 3–7 
days at an average.

Barcelona: near 1.8 MTEU/year
-> near 5000 TEU/day average



Formulation of the problem
Operations:

(1) Cost of land; 

(2) Cost of equipment; and 

(3) Cost of labour. 

(4) Also, machinery working 
-> fuel, maintenance

Other (not considered): customs, inspection, damage by 
accident

Decomposition: Land + Machinery + Labour



Formulation of the problem
Variables:

-Cost of loader for stacking the containers: CT
-Loader maintenance and operation, including energy/fuel:  MTL

-Cost of chassis for containers, if wheeled: CC
-Chassis maintenance: MCC

-Depreciation of machinery = 1/15 of their purchase value. (This 
assumes average 15 years of useful life)

-Cost of labour for operating the loader: CW
-Area required per container parked: AC 

-Area required per container stacked: AS. Depends on tier number 
-Average stay of the containers in the terminal:  AD

-Interest rates:  RI (in %) (Applied for buying the machinery)
-Cost of Land:  CL (per unit area per year)

-The terminal's daily volume: DV (containers a day)
-The loader's efficiency:  LM



Formulation of the problem
Data for the model. Area in m2, costs in Euro

AC = AREA PER CONTAINER REQUIRED FOR PARKING; 87 
AD = average delay of a container in the terminal (number of days 

in the terminal); 
5 (variable) 

CC = chassis cost (purchase price); 7500 
CL = cost of land, per square meter per year; 30-60 
CT = cost of a loader 3E5-1E6 
CT/15 = straight line depreciation over 15 yr; 20000-66700 
CW = cost of personnel required for the operation of the loader, per 

year 
60000 

DV = daily container volume in the terminal; 5000 
LM = number of containers a loader can handle in a day 50-150 
MCC = cost of chassis maintenance; 750 
MTL = maintenance cost of a top loader; 30000-100000 
RI = interest rate in %; 6-12 

 



Formulation of the problem

Equations:

The total cost for stacking operations (TCS) and the total cost 
for wheeled operations (TCC) were calculated according to 

the equations (quantities for a year):

TCS = AD  DV AS  CL + (DV/LM) * (CT*RI + CT/15 + MTL + CW)

TCC = AD  DV  AC  CL + AD  DV ( CC  RI + CC/15 + MCC)

The ratio R = TCS/TCC was also calculated



Formulation of the problem

TCS= AD  DV  AS  CL + (DV/LM) * (CT*RI + CT/15 + MTL + CW)

Note that if CT is higher, but LM is proportionally higher,
Then CW effect is reduced (DV/LM means number of devices)



Formulation of the problem

1 level means 87 m2 per container

 

Area per container occupied for stacking 

   LEVELS (TIER NUMBER) 2 3 4 5 6 

AS = area per container required for 

stacking, in square meter  

43,7 29,3 22 17,6 14,5 

 



Formulation of the problem

The reshuffling problem:

LM depends on tier number

(say, near 70% at 5 tier)

Cost of machinery: at higher performance, cost increases, 
but doubling cost and doubling performance implies a 

benefit: Interaction among loaders, salaries

Interest rates affect to Machinery costs (no CW)



Results

Left: Series 1: Cost stack to 6 tier divided by cost 
to wheel the containers (values under 1 favour the 
stacking). Series 2: Cost of stack to 5 tier divided 
by cost of wheel the containers. Series 3: Cost of 
stack to 3 tier divided by cost to wheel. Series 4: 

Cost of stack to 6 tier divided by cost to stack to 3 
tier. Series 5: Cost to stack to 5 tier divided by 
cost to stack to 3 tier. Computations with 6% 

interest rate. The ratio Cost Stack/Cost roll goes 
to low values after 1 day (near zero with longer

interest rate, loader 0.3E6, 30Euro/m2/year for 

land).

Conclusions
To achieve low cost in container handling, it is 

needed to balance land use and machinery (energy-
intensive) use. 

The high land cost and the available space force the 
stacking of containers.

The model allows computation of preferred stacking 
conditions, the high land cost suggests the use of a 
high stacking ratio (i.e., to use a high tier number), 
but safety reasons limit the tier number to 5 or 6. 



Conclusions

In the real world: it would be better to use all the 
available land, for instance in the case of Barcelona 

or other ports, and by means of logistics and 
conditions assumed by the clients, force a relatively 
short stay of containers at the terminal, to keep the 

stacking relatively low and uniform. 

Using all the available space to stock the containers 
might allow a non-maximum stacking height, and a 
reduced tier number would mean less reshufflings 

and less time and energy spent to stack the 
containers

Introduction

Given the extension of a terminal, 
the costs of port land, 
the costs that placements and movements of containers, 
as well as their horizontal and vertical positioning, 

this work seeks to make an analytical study to check 
whether the assumption of an efficient allocation is 
fulfilled

-There is a limit of practical resistance and safety
