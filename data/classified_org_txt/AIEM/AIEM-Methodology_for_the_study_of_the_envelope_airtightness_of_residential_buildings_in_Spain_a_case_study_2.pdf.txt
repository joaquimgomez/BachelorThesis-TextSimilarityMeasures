Abstract: Air leakage and its impact on the energy performance of dwellings has been broadly studied
in countries with cold climates in Europe, US, and Canada. However, there is a lack of knowledge in
this field in Mediterranean countries. Current Spanish building regulations establish ventilation rates
based on ideal airtight envelopes, causing problems of over-ventilation and substantial energy losses.
The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology that allows the characterization of the envelope of
the housing stock in Spain in order to adjust ventilation rates taking into consideration air leakage.
A methodology that is easily applicable to other countries that consider studying the airtightness of
the envelope and its energetic behaviour improvement is proposed. A statistical sampling method has
been established to determine the dwellings to be tested, considering relevant variables concerning
airtightness: climate zone, year of construction, and typology. The air leakage rate is determined
using a standardized building pressurization technique according to European Standard EN 13829.
A representative case study has been presented as an example of the implementation of the designed
methodology and results are compared to preliminary values obtained from the database.

1. Introduction

In recent years, the interest in air infiltrations has significantly grown. The uncontrolled intake
access through the envelope of buildings generates a series of problems that affect its occupants [1]:

higher energy consumption, lack of thermal comfort, entry of pollutants and odours, noise, inadequate
functioning of ventilation systems, less protection against fire, etc.

There are numerous studies that have been carried out in Northern Europe, USA, and Canada
for decades [2]. However, in Mediterranean countries there is still a lack of knowledge in this area [3].
Some field studies have been carried out to characterize the behaviour of the envelope of residential
buildings concerning infiltration (Table 1):

In the south of Italy, an experimental study [4] was carried out in 20 residential buildings of
different periods (1810–2010), climatic zones, and typologies (cottages, terraced houses, apartments,
and large buildings). The study focused on the impact of infiltrations on energy consumption and
thermal comfort, analysing the influence of several parameters: net floor area, envelope area, internal
volume, typology, type of window frames, and year of construction.

Another study in Italy [5] analysed the airtightness of a three-story building of the 1970s recently
renovated with six apartments to know the influence of air leakage on energy losses and indoor air
quality. Repeated tests sealing different elements revealed the influence of each component on the total
infiltration rate.

Sfakianaki et al. [6] conducted a study in 20 single-family homes in the Attica area, Greece.
Both the tracer gas decay and pressurization methods were used. In this way, the cases were classified
into three categories according to EN ISO 13,790 [14] and the influence of different parameters on the
global infiltration rate was statistically evaluated.

In Coimbra, Portugal [3], four retrofitted and original buildings of the historic centre were studied.
Three of them were multi-family buildings and one was a detached house. The objective was to know
the air change rate (ACH) of the chosen sample and to establish the minimum ACH to maintain
good indoor air quality and acceptable thermal behaviour. Another more extensive testing campaign
in Portugal [7] analysed 49 apartments in two social housing neighbourhoods in order to know the
relationship between the behaviour of the users of the dwellings and their airtightness and ventilation.
One of the neighbourhoods had recently been rehabilitated. Tests were also carried out in an apartment
to find out the individual impact of different elements on the airtightness of the whole envelope
(window frame, self-regulated air inlets, mechanical extraction in kitchens, fixed air inlets in the
laundry, and mechanical fan in the bathroom).

A study in Osijek, Croatia, [8] obtained a database with airtightness test results in 58 residential
units. The sample was considered representative in terms of year of construction after finding a
relationship between the elements of the sample and the statistical data of residential buildings in
Croatia. The purpose was to establish a method for predicting the airtightness of the envelope applying
neural networks, which has been subsequently validated [15,16].

In Turkey [9], another study was carried out after the detection of problems in dwellings such
as inadequate air conditioning and ventilation or condensation. Airtightness tests were conducted



Energies 2018, 11, 704 3 of 20

in 52 newly built unoccupied homes to analyse the behaviour of the envelope and to proceed with a
possible revision of the regulations.

In the case of Spain, only partial studies have been carried out so far to characterize the airtightness
of the envelope of the housing stock. None of them has covered the entire geography of the country.
The study with the largest number of tests fulfilled was conducted in recently built dwellings in
northern Spain [10] to determine the level of infiltration in residential buildings and to establish the
determining factors. Also, in northern and central Spain, Meiss and Feijó-Muñoz [11] developed a
procedure to evaluate the excess energy consumption caused by air infiltration, analysing 13 homes in
residential buildings. The lack of airtightness in Spain was estimated to represent between 10.5% and
25.4% of the energy demand in winter in buildings built under current regulations [17].

Several social housing units in Madrid and Seville were analysed to determine the degree
of airtightness and indoor air quality [12]. The sample was chosen paying attention to the
representativeness of the architectural and construction typologies used in the period 1940–1980
and presented different degrees of retrofitting of the envelope. The airtightness of the envelope
in residential buildings at the beginning of the 21st century in the south of Spain has also been
characterized [13]. The selection of cases to be analysed in each building was made with a stratified
probabilistic design.

The objective of this work is to establish a rigorous and simple methodology in order to carry out
a characterization of the envelope of residential buildings in Spain in terms of airtightness, through
coordinated testing campaigns. A broad database of 411 cases that collects characterization information
and results is being created. In a later phase, the analysis of the data under a unified procedure and
criteria will be guaranteed. In this sense, it will be possible to know the impact that different factors
have on airtightness, as well as the infiltration rates corresponding to the most widespread constructive
solutions in Spain.

This methodology has been conceived in such a way that it is easily applicable to other countries
that intend to evaluate the energy impact of air leakage of existing buildings.

Regulations in Spain

The European Directive on the energy performance of buildings [18] is committed to the
generalization of nearly-zero energy buildings (nZEB) by 2020. In response to it, many countries
have been incorporating limitations in their regulations regarding the airtightness of the envelope [19]
since the beginning of the 2000s.

However, in Mediterranean countries with a temperate climate, where ventilation has traditionally
been done in a natural and manually controlled way, infiltrations have been part of the air supply and
have compensated the lack of regulation of specific controlled ventilation systems [13].

In Spain, after the oil energy crisis in the 70s, the building regulations NBE-CT-79 [20], relating to
thermal conditions of buildings, tended to increase thermal insulation, achieving an improvement in
the energy performance of buildings. NBE-CT-79 also affected indoor air quality as a consequence of
the lack of ventilation. To give an answer to this problem, in 2006 regulations of the Technical Building
Code (CTE) DB HS3 [21] were approved. This document implemented specific ventilation requirements
and proceedings to ensure adequate indoor air quality, establishing minimum ventilation flows.

The current version of the CTE [21], in spite of not contemplating a minimum requirement of
global airtightness of the envelope, gives the option to consider the equivalent infiltration area as part
of the ventilation opening area. In this way, using technical specifications tables or minimum values of
airtightness established for each type of window (Table 2) it is possible to adjust the required flow rates.
However, the obtaining of a precise value for the entire enclosure considering not only the airtightness
of its elements separately, but also the encounters of each solution, would be necessary. In any case,
the lack of knowledge of airtightness values results in the oversizing of the ventilation systems.

2. Methodology

2.1. Sampling

Given the impossibility of testing and characterizing each home in the Spanish residential stock,
sampling has been used, selecting a set of elements (sample), from which to extrapolate the results and
establish statements. In this sense, the maximum representativeness of the sample has been ensured in
order to characterize the existing housing stock in Spanish geography in the most reliable way.

In the theoretical framework, the best way to estimate a relevant statistical distribution would be
to analyse cases in a random sample of buildings in Spain that would ensure the representativeness
of the sample [24]. However, taking into account the objectives and characteristics of the present
study, a more realistic and efficient approach has been considered, proposing a non-probabilistic
quota sampling scheme. The sample reproduces the population on a smaller scale, ensuring the
heterogeneity and proportionality of the selected cases. The problem of this methodology lies mainly
in the possibility of bias in the sample when the cases are selected in a very specific environment.
The appropriate measures to avoid it have been taken. It is also necessary to indicate that sampling
errors cannot be estimated because the probability of each case being selected is unknown [25].

2.1.1. Parameters

The Spanish residential stock has been stratified into subgroups (strata) according to a series of
control variables. In order to define relevant control variables, a review of previous studies that have
established predictive airtightness models in residential buildings [26] has been used. It is deduced
that one of the variables with greater relevance is the year of construction [27–30]. Also, characteristics
of the building such as typology [31], type of construction [30], type of window/glazing [15] and
window frame [6,32], foundation [28], construction system [33], materials [15,24,32,34], floor area [28],
total height [28], number of storeys [33], ventilation system [35,36], type of insulation [30] and sealing
devices [34], and management type [31] should be considered. In addition, the execution also seems to
be a relevant factor in the airtightness of the envelope [36,37]. Several authors have also considered
that the climatic zone is a variable to consider [28,38].

There are many factors that have an impact on airtightness. However, in order to be considered
as control variables for sampling, its distribution must be known. Finally, the year of construction,
typology, and climatic zone have been taken as control variables for the sampling, given their relevance.
The impact on the infiltration rate generated by the other parameters will be evaluated afterwards,
during the data analysis phase.

The year of construction is relevant for several aspects. First, materials and joints deteriorate
over time [39]. A 10–15% increase in the infiltration rate has been estimated every 10 years [40,41].
Second, construction systems are evolving and improving, although in countries with temperate
climates where there are no regulations that limit the infiltration rate, the most recent buildings are not
necessarily the most airtight [2]. Third, the year of construction is linked to the regulations in force at
each moment, which establishes the requirements and conditions of the construction systems. A total
of 10 groups have been determined by periods, based on statistical sources [42].

Regarding the typology, a distinction has been made between single-family and multi-family
dwellings, which represent more than 70% of the residential stock in Spain [40].



Energies 2018, 11, 704 5 of 20

The climatic zone also has a significant impact on airtightness. Buildings located in cold climates
tend to be more airtight than others located in temperate climates [41]. Climatic zones do not only
affect weather conditions, but they can also establish differences in regulatory requirements or different
construction systems [28]. A simplification of the climatic zones in Spain has been made, obtaining a
total of four zones: Continental, Oceanic, Mediterranean, and Canary Islands (Figure 1).

The number of cases belonging to each stratum has been made proportionally, according to the
statistical distribution of the housing stock in Spain [42]. This way, a stratified representation of the
population is obtained.

2.1.2. Size and Distribution of the Sample 

Once the control variables were defined, the number of cases to be analysed and the stratification 
of the population is carried out. The size of the sample depends on three variables: the level of 
confidence, the variance, and the margin of error that is considered acceptable [43]. Statistically, the 
Spanish residential stock is considered an infinite population. This means that the size of the sample 
will be determined by the following Equation (1): 

n = Z σe  (1) 
where: 

n0: sample size (number of dwellings to be studied) 
Z: critical value, depending on the confidence level  
σ: population standard deviation (unknown value in Spain)

confidence, the variance, and the margin of error that is considered acceptable [43]. Statistically,

(1)

where:

n0: sample size (number of dwellings to be studied)
Z: critical value, depending on the confidence level
σ: population standard deviation (unknown value in Spain)
e: margin of error

The value of Z is given by the Gaussian distribution, depending on the level of confidence
accepted. The most frequent values are Z = 1.645, Z = 1.96 and Z = 2.575, for confidence levels of 90%,
95% and 99% respectively.

The value of the variance in terms of the airtightness of the envelope in Spain is an unknown
value, since there is still no representative data in this regard. Values obtained in a study carried out in
Italy were taken as reference, by proximity, constructive, and climatic analogy [44]. The study carried
out analysed 20 cases of several typologies and year of construction, resulting from the air change
rates values at 50 Pa (n50) a variance of 17.584.



Energies 2018, 11, 704 6 of 20

Taking into account that a higher level of confidence or a minor admissible error significantly
increases the sample size and that the number of cases to be analysed is conditioned by the purpose of
the study, the availability of resources, and the time limitation, a confidence level of 95% and an error
of ±0.4 have been considered acceptable, resulting in a sample size of 423 cases. This figure has finally
been reduced to 411 due to numerical rounding in the stratification process. The distribution of the
samples and their location are detailed in Table 3 and in Figure 1.

2.2. Tests Assessment

2.2.1. Testing Method

The evaluation of the leakages is carried out in accordance with EN 13829 standard [45], used
for the determination of air permeability of buildings by the fan pressurization method, commonly
known as Blower door test (Figure 2).

There are other measurement techniques such as the tracer gas method, which is more accurate
but requires well-trained experts and also higher costs [3]. The blower door test has been considered
the most appropriate technique because it is simpler and comparatively inexpensive. The generation
of a high-pressure differential (50 Pa) is sufficient to mitigate the wind and temperature action on
the envelope. In this sense, it is reasonably accurate and reproducible [2]. In return, the envelope is
subjected to an unreal situation, because the average pressure differential under normal environmental
circumstances is around 1–4 Pa.

Measurement sets are made both for pressurization and depressurization, in the internal volume
of the deliberately conditioned space of the house. In the case of apartment buildings, in which part of



Energies 2018, 11, 704 7 of 20

the envelope is in contact with other conditioned or unconditioned spaces different from the outdoor
space, the air permeability of each dwelling is measured individually. Dividing walls and horizontal
partitions to adjacent spaces are considered to be part of the envelope. It must be taken into account,
though, that there are air inlets with different environmental conditions [11]. Thus, envelope areas
from different conditions are measured in a differentiated way. Technical and operational limitations
do not allow addressing more accurate approaches like the pressure equalization method [46].

The infiltration curve is calculated according to the power law equation (Equation (2)), based on
the fundamental mechanics airflow, to establish the relationship between the fan flow (qenv) and the
building pressure difference (∆p):

Venv = Cenv(∆p
n) (2)

where:

Venv: air flow rate through the envelope of the dwelling (m3/h)
Cenv: air flow coefficient, which is related to the size of the opening (m3/(h·Pan))
∆p: induced pressure difference (Pa)
n: pressure exponent

The pressure exponent n provides an indication of the flow regime. It has the limiting values
of 0.5 and 1 [2]. On the one hand, when n is closer to 0.5, the flow regime is turbulent and leakage



Energies 2018, 11, 704 8 of 20

paths are expected to be large, short leaks. On the other hand, when the exponent is closer to 1,
the flow is laminar and long-path leaks are expected. Typical flow exponent values range between
0.6 and 0.7 [47].

Two procedures are carried out by Methods A (testing of a building in use) and B (testing of
the building envelope), as described in standard EN 13829 [45], taking into account the different
preparations of the building that each method requires (Table 4).

and ceilings bordering the internal volume subject to the test. AF (m2): net floor area. Total floor area of all floors
belonging to the internal volume subject to the test.

Additionally, two parameters are considered:

• EqLA (10 Pa): equivalent leakage area—National Research Council (NRC) of Canada Model (cm2).
It is defined as the area of a sharp-edged orifice that would leak the same amount of air as the
building does at a pressure of 10 Pa [48].

• ELA (4 Pa): effective leakage area—Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories Model (LBNL) (cm2). It is
defined as the area of a special nozzle-shaped hole that would leak the same amount of air as the
building does at a pressure of 4 Pa.

During the depressurization stage, leakage points were identified by thermography (Figure 3).
However, due to the climatological conditions of the areas where the tests were carried out, a large
thermal gradient to allow thermographic observation was not always expected. In these cases,
thermography will be replaced by the use of smoke generators.

For the assessment of the tests, a common protocol based on the standard [45] has been developed,
which specifies the correct execution of the experimental procedures and data capture, in such a way
that all the cases are analysed in a systematic and uniform way.

Additionally, two parameters are considered: 

• EqLA (10 Pa): equivalent leakage area—National Research Council (NRC) of Canada Model 
(cm2). It is defined as the area of a sharp-edged orifice that would leak the same amount of air 
as the building does at a pressure of 10 Pa [48]. 

• ELA (4 Pa): effective leakage area—Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories Model (LBNL) (cm2). It is 
defined as the area of a special nozzle-shaped hole that would leak the same amount of air as 
the building does at a pressure of 4 Pa. 

During the depressurization stage, leakage points were identified by thermography (Figure 3).

2.2.2. Software Development for Data Gathering  

A specific tool has been developed to store all the data from each case, “infil-APP” (Figures 4–
7). A wide characterization of different parameters, up to a total of more than 140, are stored in a 
tabulated way, detailed in Table 6. The application has been conceived to allow a simple, fast, and 
intuitive operation. Its structure is in accordance to the testing process, so that technicians only need 
to follow the steps. The information needed in order to perform the test is gathered in advance, so 
that the minimum time is spent on site.  

The first stage is completed before the test performance and comprises data of the technicians 
and the owner, responsible university, location, and year of construction of the dwelling (Figure 4). 
A code is automatically generated for each case, which allows personal data protection and the 
identification of each case. Dimensions are also gathered at this stage whenever graphical 
documentation of the dwelling is available. Otherwise, simple floor plans are sketched on site in order 
to obtain the required information. Dimensions such as floor area (AF), volume (V), envelope area 
(AE), or shape factor (Sf) are automatically calculated from partial dimensions. In order to guarantee 
suitable meteorological conditions limited by EN 13829 standard [45], weather forecast at the 
expected date, and time of the test is also introduced. If the wind speed exceeds 6 m/s, “infil-APP” 
does not allow one to continue to further steps and the test needs to be postponed.

3. BLOWER DOOR TEST RESULTS

The development of the protocol and the software described allow the performance of
standardized tests and data systematization that enables results interpretation. Its extended use
would allow the construction of a single national database developed by multiple agents. Besides,
its basis is replicable in other scenarios, such as other areas with a lack of knowledge on this field,
or countries that do not count on a standardized database.

2.2.3. Test Campaigns

A total of nine universities (Figure 1) participated in the characterization and testing of the
required cases. To this end, testing campaigns have been organized throughout 2016 and 2017, taking
into account the number of cases assigned to each site and paying special attention to the expected
climatic conditions, given that the EN 13829 standard [45] determines limitations with respect to the
wind during the test. Each site consisted of a coordinator and one or two teams of technicians, with a
total of 11 teams to cover the field work. These teams were trained before the campaigns to ensure
proper compliance with the developed protocol. A common cloud server was created to allow constant
data transfer and supervision from the coordinating University (VLL).

In order to obtain access to the dwellings required in the sampling, dissemination campaigns and
search for volunteers through leaflets, posters and advertisements on the websites of participating
universities and social networks were designed. Agreements with public administrations were
established, which allowed access to a number of cases for the study.

supply or exhaust systems nor adjustable openings. There is only one natural ventilation grid in the
kitchen, which was left open for the purposes of Method A and sealed for Method B.

3.2. Comparison of the Results

The case study results are compared to preliminary results of 343 buildings tested in the database
(Table 10). Building airtightness is expressed by either the air change rate (n50) or the air permeability
rate (q50).

As a preliminary analysis of the results, the control variables used to design the sample were
studied: climate zone, year of construction, and typology. Figure 11 represents graphically the
comparison between the case study results and the database results for Method B concerning dwellings
from the same climate zone (Continental), built within the same period (1960–1979) and dwellings
with the same typology (multi-family housing).

Although there is a wide spread of the values obtained from the database, the mean values
according to the chosen parameters do not differ in a meaningful way. It seems clear the fact that
significantly better results have been obtained for the case study dwelling than the general trend of
the database.

According to ISO 13790 [14] the case-study dwelling has a “medium airtightness level”, having
a value within the range of 2–5 h−1. However, the mean n50 value for multifamily dwellings of the
database is 7.26 h−1, which, according to ISO 13790 [14], corresponds to a “low airtightness level”.

To determine infiltration locations and distribution, thermal imaging was undertaken during 
the depressurization stage. Since there was a great temperature difference between the inside and the 
outside of the dwelling leakage points were easily visualized. Most leakages were located in window 
frames and shutter boxes (Figure 12).

comply with UK (q50 < 10 m3/m2·h) and Ireland (q50 < 7 m3/m2·h) or Czech Republic (n50 < 4.5 h−1)
regulations but not with German regulations nor Polish recommendations (n50 < 3 h−1) for new
buildings [49]. The comparison with French regulations has not been made since its indicator is
measured at 4 Pa and a direct translation of the results would not be accurate.

3.3. Leakages Location 

To determine infiltration locations and distribution, thermal imaging was undertaken during 
the depressurization stage. Since there was a great temperature difference between the inside and the 
outside of the dwelling leakage points were easily visualized. Most leakages were located in window 
frames and shutter boxes (Figure 12).

4. Conclusions

A methodology has been developed to investigate the airtightness of the architectural envelope
of the existing residential stock in Spain through an experimental study carried out throughout the
Spanish geography. Considering a proportional quota sampling scheme, a representative number
of 411 cases has been selected. In this way it is possible to extrapolate the results to other Spanish
residential buildings. The sample includes different typologies, construction years, and climatic
zones. The study will allow the creation of an extensive database and the identification of the factors
that have a greater impact on airtightness and the infiltration rates of typical constructive solutions.
The methodology has been conceived in such a way that it can be applied to other countries where
there is no data regarding the airtightness of the envelope in residential buildings.

A case study in Valladolid has been presented in order to show an example of the implementation
of the methodology. Airtightness results are compared to mean values obtained from the database,
considering the control variables used to design the sample: climate zone, year of construction,
and typology. Results obtained indicate that the dwelling has a medium airtightness level, significantly
higher than the mean values obtained from the database. Leakages at the case study were located
mainly around window joints and frames and shutter boxes.

Further work will include a deep analysis of the complete dataset obtained during the test
campaigns in order to establish infiltration rates for typical Spanish constructive solutions, the impact
of different parameters on the envelope permeability, and the impact of infiltrations on the ventilation
and energy performance of dwellings.
