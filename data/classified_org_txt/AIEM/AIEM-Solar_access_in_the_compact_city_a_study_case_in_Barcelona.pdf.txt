ABSTRACT
The objective of this work is to analyze the performance of a high-density urban fabric regarding 
access to solar radiation and to determine the extent to which urban form can affect the collection of 
energy on building envelopes.
A specific  case of  this  study is  the  Eixample district  in  Barcelona (Spain),  a nineteenth-century 
district that synthesizes the features of a compact and complex city. The attention is here focused on 
the  fabric orientation, with the aim of quantifying and comparing the influence of obstructions in 
different situations. 
This analysis is carried out using  Heliodón 2, a software that simulates real solar paths, providing 
graphical and numerical information about the evolution and distribution of solar radiation over a 
surface, and taking into account losses due to cast shadows. 
The results provide interesting information on solar radiation performance and the possibilities of 
formal solutions for improving exploitation of solar energy in an urban context. Furthermore, such an 
analysis gives the opportunity to explore the possibilities and reliability of comparative processes 
applied on an urban scale and to extend their application to other study cases.

1. INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of the world’s population, business activities, commerce and amenities are located 
in  cities  and  the  energy consumption  and  environmental  contamination  that  they  generate  have 
dangerous effects for present and future human generations.
The urgency of reducing energy demand and the use of fossil fuels first became clear in the 1970s, 
due to the international oil  crisis,  when world communities realized that a transformation of the 
productive, economic and social organization was needed.
Buildings form a major part of the global energy demand, because approximately half of the total 
amount of energy produced in the world is employed by them only to control interior comfort (Ratti 
et al. 2005). Moreover, edifices are not isolated and self-dependent entities, but linked parts of a 
settlement.  In  an  urban  area,  complicated  networks  for  material  transportation,  information, 
communication and services produce flows that also require considerable energy resources for their 
own operations.
The importance of an  urban scale approach to this problem started to be recognized in the early 
1990s, and during the last 20 years many studies have been aimed at creating more sustainable urban 
models and planning policies in order to reduce energy demand and foster the integration of available 
natural resources, with special regard to solar radiation.
The Solar City concept was created by P. Droege as an International Energy Agency research (2002) 
and  development  project  aimed  at  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  urban  settlements  by 
introducing a rational use of energy and a renewable energy system (Jenks et al. 2005).

Actually, just before then, C. Winter (1993) had already conceived the city of the 21st century (the 
Second Solar Civilization) as a solar city, defining it as “an energetically self-contained settlement 
with solar irradiance as its main energy source” and considering what this big “energy converter” 
would look like and how it would have to be designed. Though still immature, these observations 
highlight the importance of the formal aspects of a solar city and the role assumed by architects and 
planners in dealing with this natural energy source: the sun.
Interaction between site layout and solar penetration is really strict, complex and often conflictive, 
especially in  high-density urban cases.  There is  a general  tendency to recognize a  complex and 
compact model as more sustainable, since it leads to a lesser territorial expansion and reduces global 
energy demand (Rueda 2002), but it is clear that a strong densification of urban space inevitably 
reduces the amount of su potentially available as a natural source of energy. 
Hence, in what direction is the historic debate between smart growth and urban sprawl evolving, in 
the age of sustainability?  Is it possible to envision a high density  solar city? What are the most 
appropriated design solutions that urban designers can choose to optimize individual, technical and 
social use of the sun (Käiser at al. 1996 and Treberspurg 2008)? 
Several studies of the performance of urban environments with respect to solar energy have been 
carried-out (and many of them are still under way) using different methods of analysis: empirical 
formulas, algorithms, numerical models, manual, geometric or graphical tools, lighting and thermal 
simulation software,  and so on. Though considerable computational and technical advances have 
been made during the last few years, the problem is still partially unsolved and the results obtained 
up to now can by no means be considered exhaustive.
Main problems are related to the big number of inputs interacting at an urban scale. The lack of 
suitable tools for managing and synthesizing all kinds of variables at once makes the calculation 
processes long and complicated, often providing output data that are difficult to interpret. Difficulties 
in creating suitable three-dimensional digital mock-ups and in reproducing sky vault and cloudiness 
models are two further critical points that can affect the correct estimation of solar access into cities.
The inability of current tools to provide comprehensive and totally exact predictions raises serious 
questions  about  the  level  of  accuracy that  is  really  required  at  an  urban  scale.  Is  such  a  high 
computational complexity necessary, or can simplified methods and models of analysis suffice and 
offer more significant results?
At present, two important questions concerning the study of solar radiation performance within cities 
need to  be solved.  Firstly,  from the sustainability point  of  view,  the influence of morphological 
parameters on solar radiation access in buildings and open spaces takes on a special role in high-
density urban environments and therefore needs to be studied specifically.
Secondly, the definition of suitable and accessible research tools and processes seems to be one of 
the most urgent needs, in order to get a more flexible and practical knowledge and to achieve a 
rational management of all the information available. 

2. OBJECTIVES

2.1 General objectives
This  study represents  the  first  step  of  a  current  research  project  regarding  sun  availability  and 
radiation  control  in  high-density  urban  fabrics.  By studying  and  comparing  the  performance  of 
different built environments, it intends to obtain information about formal features of the city that 
affect solar access and its exploitation.
By focusing  attention  on  the  geometrical  aspects  of  the  question,  it  also  aims  to  improve  the 
possibilities  of  comparative  analysis  at  an  urban scale.  This  methodology is  based  on a  digital 
simulation and aims to reduce the number of variables taken into account, in order to obtain faster 
computations and more synthetic results that can be used to inform the urban planning process. 
This method is here applied to the case of the Eixample's district.

2.2 Specific objectives 
2.2.1 The influence of obstructions
The first step is to evaluate the effect of obstructions to access of solar radiation and the percentage 
of energy loss due to the mutual shadows cast by neighbouring buildings, in order to determine the 
previously performance of the existing situation. 

2.2.2 Urban fabric orientation and solar access
With specific reference to the direction of the urban pattern,  Eixample's regular grid is therefore 
studied  with  two different  orientations  with  respect  to  the  North,  in  order  to  compare  shadows 
projected  by  surrounding  buildings  in  various  situations.  Changeble  evolution  of  solar  radiance 
throughout the year is really important to relate correctly geometrical characteristics and solar access 
in the urban context. For this reason, number of sunny hours and amount of energy collected by 
exposed surfaces are separately calculated  in summer (21/06-20/09) and winter (21/12-20/03). 

2.2.3 Tool and methodology evaluation 
Through  the  operations  previously  described,  we  also  wish  to  test  the  efficacy  of  the  specific 
methodology and digital simulation process proposed in comparison with other tools usually applied 
for solar radiation analysis at an urban scale.
The aim is to check the level of accuracy provided by the software, in order to determine whether the 
results can be considered reliable to guide formal urban planning decisions.

3. METHODOLOGY
3.1 Identification and selection of the study case: Barcelona’s Eixample
Barcelona is located in the central coast of Catalonia, Spain, at 41°23’N and has a mean elevation of 
4 m above sea level. The climate is Mediterranean, with an annual average temperature of 15.5ºC, a 
daily temperature range of 15 degrees and an annual average solar radiation of 14.4 MJ/m2*day, ac-
cording to the Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya and to the Atles climàtic digital de Catalunya.
A population of about 1,600,000 people reside today in the urban area that covers an area of 100 km2. 
The formal organization of the city is the result  of both its history and the natural geographical 
boundaries. 
The Eixample covers an area of 748.5 hectares and houses about 16.5% of Barcelona’s inhabitants. It 
is one of the smallest districts in Barcelona, but one with a very high population density,  35,082 
inh/km2, well over twice the average for the whole city (data source: Department de Informatica del  
Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2007).
The demographic data clearly reflect the morphological and functional features of the site layout: a 
dense and mixed texture, in which private residential use is combined with public activities. In the 
21st century, the Eixample still works as a dynamic and heterogeneous district, though its formal or-
ganization dates back to 150 years ago.
Ildefons Cerdà’s 1859 Plan for the Eixample proposed a regular formal organization, constituted by 
an array of quadrangular chamfered blocks (manzanas) with sides 113.3 m long, defined by a grid of 
orthogonal streets 20 m wide (one central lane 10 m wide for vehicles and 2 lateral pedestrian side-
walks). Buildings, whose height was limited to 16 m, should have occupied only two edges of the 
block, in order to give access to the central patio consisting of public green areas. Unfortunately, dur-
ing successive phases of building speculation, the general buildings rose to a height of 20-24 m (1 or 
2 floors more) and occupied almost the whole manzana (Fig.1).
The street canyon geometry and grid orientation originally established by Cerdà (NO-SE and SO-
NE, the same chosen by the Romans for the foundation of the first settlement in the 1st century BC), 

3



were justified by the intention of controlling shadowing by surrounding buildings, in order to guaran-
tee that all dwellings would receive sufficient daylight and natural ventilation. 
Cerdà’s city concept seems to express the features of a compact and complex supposedly sustainable 
city (Rueda 1998) and also to recognize the importance of  sunlight and daylight availability in an 
urban context. It is therefore interesting to study the performance of the Eixample in order to test the 
effectiveness of a dense fabric with respect to solar access.
An analysis of the whole area would be unnecessary and not significant for the aim of this work be-
cause the peculiar regularity of the fabric easily allows one to consider only a part of it and to extend 
the results to the whole. Hence, an area formed by 9 blocks symmetrically placed in 3 x 3 square on 
the left side of the district was selected as a study sample (Fig.2)

3.2 Construction and approximation of the model
The  3D digital  mock-up of  the  selected  area  necessary for  digital  simulation  requires  a  careful 
process of preparation and simplification. In this study, we used a three dimensional model prepared 
by the Laboratorio de Modelización Virtual de la Ciudad (LMVC) of the Universitat Politèecnica de 
Catalunya.
Small-scale  construction  details  on the  building  envelopes  (like  openings,  balconies,  chimneys, 
decorations,  mouldings,  and  so  on)  were  omitted  from  the  model,  since  their  contribution  is 
irrelevant to solar gain at an urban scale and their presence can considerably reduce the computation 
speed. The main volumes were taken from a 2D topographic plan of the Eixample; the number of 
floors of each building was known and 3 metres were counted for each one to build their volumes.
Volumes within the same manzana were then merged together (in the scene there will be 9 objects in 
total), in order to eliminate adjacent overlapping surfaces and to obtain a less complex shape. The 
vector model built as a DWG file is finally exported as an STL format that reduces the enclosing 
envelope of the previous volumes to a “list” of triangles identified by coordinates of its 3 vertexes 
and of its perpendicular.

3.3 Simulation process
With  reference  to  the  sample  area  of  the  Eixample previously  selected,  assuming  that  all  the 
manzanas have the same area of exposure, we only analyse the performance of the central one, while 
the other blocks simply act as obstructions. Sun paths are simulated in summer (situation a) and in 
winter (situation b) in 3 different cases (Fig.2):
1) A case of maximum radiation: the surrounding buildings are removed from the scene in order to 
calculate the daylight hours and potential energy received with complete absence of obstructions.

2)  The  real  case  (urban  fabric  orientation  NO-SE and  NE-SO):  computation  is  now performed

including shadows projected by neighbouring buildings.
3)  A hypothetical  case  (urban fabric  orientation  N-S and E-O):  the  same process  of  analysis  is 
repeated, considering the Eixample's grid with a rotation of 45 degrees clockwise with respect to the 
original one.

3.3.1 The Heliodon 2 software
The  digital  tool  we  improved  is  Heliodón  2,  a  solar  path  simulation  software  that  allows  fast 
interactive  energetic  and  visual  control  of  natural  lighting,  providing  clear  and  immediate 
information about spatial and temporal distribution of radiation on building envelopes at a specific 
geographic site defined by latitude and altitude (B. Beckers and L. Masset 2009).
The program considers direct and diffuse components of illumination separately. Reflection factors 
of surface materials are not specified, which means that specular and diffuse indirect contributions 
due to the surrounding elements are not taken into account.
With respect to the direct component, Heliodón 2 considers maximum balances of incident radiation, 
without subtracting any losses due to cloudiness, but acting as if the sun were shining during the 
whole year. In this study, the attention will focus only on this component of the sun.
Compared with other lighting and thermal simulation software, this one does not refer to theoretical 
sky models or require climatic data to be entered, but instead it provides absolute information strictly 
linked to the geometry of the objects. Therefore, the statistical input data inserted are reduced and the 
calculation  is  simplified  in  terms  of  time  and  technical  costs.  Herein  lies  the  versatility  and 
robustness of the product. 
Evidently, hours of exposure and values of collected energy are therefore very optimistic and do not 
correspond to reality.  Actually,  Heliodon 2 has no diagnostic aim, but is rather aimed at  making 
comparisons between situations. Consequently, the assumptions described above do not affect the 
reliability of the final results.
Heliodón 2 uses  an  isochronal  projection to  represent  solar  provision in  a  specific  scene:  while 
stereography provides only instantaneous information, in these graphics hours (X axis) and months 
(Y axis) are equidistant. This property allows solar flux (kW/m2) to be integrated during an interval 
defined  by the  user,  in  order  to  obtain  corresponding  balances  of  solar  energy  (kWh/m2).  The 
accuracy of the final results depends on the frequency of calculation in the given duration; in this 
case, the default value of 15 minutes represents a good compromise between precision of output data 
and technical tools available for computation.

External surfaces in the scene are discretized by a regular virtual mesh of points, whose mutual 

5

 
Figure 3:The 3 situations analyzed, from the left case 1, 2 and 3 



distances can be regulated manually. In the current example, a width of 1.4 m seems to be sufficient 
for the scale of the project. According to the fixed frequency, Heliodón 2 computes a long series of 
data about instantaneous solar radiance at the nodes; mean values are then aggregated and elaborated 
to  obtain  a  cumulative  distribution of  daylight  hours  (h),  local  flux  (kWh/m2)  and total  energy 
(kWh). 

3.4 Overall quantitative comparison and qualitative cross-analysis
Potential contribution of direct solar radiation is quantified and compared  in the 3 different cases 
using graphical and numerical values of sunny hours and energy collected for the whole block. 
The overall results are then complemented by specific information on the evolution of solar radiance 
and the percentage of energy loss in significant single portions of the envelope, such as external and 
internal façades and roofs. These data express the  qualitative distribution of incident radiation and 
allow us to find more specific relations between position, dimensions and other formal features of 
exposed surfaces and their orientation, in both winter and summer.

4. RESULTS

4.1 Solar radiation distribution and influence of cast shadows
Comparing case 1 with case 2 (Table 1), it was foreseeable to find that the presence of obstructions in 
the immediate surroundings of the block represents a concrete obstacle to solar access that reduces 
total  energy gains.  Losses are  greater  in  winter  (-8,9%) than in  summer (-2,6%) because of  the 
different height of the sun on the horizon (in Barcelona, 23 and 72 degrees at 12.00 h at the winter 
and summer solstices, respectively).We also observe in the Figures 4 and 6 that the highest values of 
solar flux are always detected above horizontal surfaces during the summer (567 kWh/m2) and above 
south-facing vertical  surfaces during the winter  (304 kWh/m2).  This  is  because radiation always 
depends on the angle of incidence: at 0 degree angles no radiation corresponds, while for 90 degrees 
ones the maximum value is received. 
The Table 1 also show that both sun flux and sunny periods on roofs and internal façades are the 
same,  regardless  of  external  obstructions.  Actually,  the  only  parts  of  the  envelope  affected  by 
shadowing of  surrounding blocks,  in  both  seasons,  are  the  exterior  façades  of  the  manzana;  of 
course, amount of radiation received is proportional to the height of the building (Figures 4 and 6).

The large surface of the central patio, provides the most consistent contribution to solar energy 
gain,  though it  is  partly shaded by high surrounding buildings.  Distribution of solar  flux and 
sunny  periods  are  inhomogeneous,  with  maximum  values  concentrated  in  the  centre  and 
progressively decreasing toward the lateral parts.

4.2 Influence of urban fabric orientation
Numerical results (Table 1) demonstrate that a 45-degree rotation of the Eixample's urban fabric 
produces an overall  increase in solar energy gain in winter (+4%), when energy and daylight 
demand is higher in Barcelona. In fact, with the N-S and E-O orientation, a larger vertical surface 
is facing exactly south and, despite the presence of obstructions, it works as a energy collector. On 
the other hand, in case 3b (Figures 6 and 7), one of the long sides of the manzana is exposed to the 
north, which means that 23% of total surface of the exterior façades receives no direct radiation 
throughout the whole season (sunny hours = 0). 
In summer, a different process is instead detected: for the same block, seasonal gains fall slightly 
from 8194 MWh in case 2a to 8133 MWh in case 2b (about -1%). 
Actually, this decrease is almost inappreciable because, as stated above, during the hot season 
greater amounts of energy are provided by horizontal surfaces, which are not affected by shadows 
of  surrounding buildings  even in  this  situation:  the graphical  distribution shows,  in  fact,  that 
maximum values of sunny period (1289 hours) are detected above the roofs in both cases (Figures 
5 and 7). Positive or negative contributions of the other portions of the envelope probably have a 
secondary importance, which is why the overall balance is almost unchanged. 

4.3 Distribution of solar flux on the external façades
Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 show results for the sunny period and total energy on the 4 long sides and the 
4 chamfers of the manzana, according to their surface and orientation. We immediately observe 
that with a 45-degree rotation , exterior façades are definitely more affected by the influence of 
obstructions compared with case 2, in both summer and winter (cases 3a and 3b) .
During the winter, the average local flux on the south façade falls from 0.27 to 0.19 MWh/m2, and 
the average sunny period from 617 to 469 hours (Tables 4 and 5). This means that this side has 
less possibilities of enjoying direct solar access, even if its final contribution in terms of energy is  
higher than that of the previous case (259 versus 97 MWh), thanks to the surface available to 
radiation, which is about 4 times bigger than before. A similar performance is detected on the east 
façade, while the SO and SE sides show an opposite process (more sunny hours, but a smaller  
area exposed). 
The total  amount  of solar  energy stored by the exterior façades is  7% lower than in the real 
situation. If we assume, as mentioned above, that the behaviour of horizontal surfaces is fairly 
constant, how can we explain the overall increase obtained in case 3b (Table 1)? We deduce that 
the  highest  gains  come  from  interior  façades,  especially  from  the  south-facing  one,  whose 
contribution not only compensates for losses by the exterior vertical envelope, but also gives an 
extra provision of solar energy.
In summer (Tables 2 and 3), solar access in the hypothetical situation (case 3a) is instead reduced 
on the east  and west façades with respect to the real situation (case 2a). In fact, sunny hours 
decrease  respectively  from  511  to  394  and  from  549  to  428,  even  if  their  final  energy 
contributions are still consistent. 
The north side is more exposed (272 versus 108 hours of direct radiation), while on the other parts  
the values of local flux remain almost constant. The highest energy losses are basically recorded 
on the SO and SE chamfers, due to their small surface area. The balance of energy contributions 
provided by all vertical exterior components in case 3a is overall 14% lower than in case 2a. In 
other words, in summer, the influence of external obstructions is accentuated and the internal 
façades fail to compensate for energy losses due to shadowing.

5. CONCLUSIONS
5.1 Importance of temporal and spatial distribution of solar radiation
Studying solar access at an urban scale does not simply mean carrying out a general cumulative 
analysis. Influence of obstructions cannot be evaluated only in terms of overall amounts of energy or 
sunny hours: these quantitative “absolute values” are important, but by no means exhaustive, because 
information also needs to be organized in relation to space and time in order to be really significant.
Concerning  the  aspect  of  time,  of  course  solar  radiation  changes  during  the  year,  as  does  its 
relationship with the built environment, so it is essential to study its evolution in different seasons 
separately.  Moreover,  according  to  the  location,  radiation  may  or  may  not  be  perceived  as 
appreciable by the citizens: in fact, in a Mediterranean climate like that of Barcelona, reduction of 
sunlight and building overheating are generally required in summer. Consequently, in the Eixample, 
the presence of obstructions is not always considered to be negative.
It is also important to know the effective spatial distribution of solar radiation above the envelope. In 
the study case, shadows concentrate on exterior façades, while solar access on the roofs and on the 
interior surfaces is not affected by external obstacles. 
This  behaviour  immediately allows one  to  recognize some of  the typical  formal  features  of  the 
Eixample's urban fabric: the height to width ratio and the regular skyline of the blocks ensure total 
exposure of the roofs, which offer a large surface potentially exploitable for an active use of the 
sunlight.
If we move instead from the urban overview to the scale of a single  manzana, we individuate a 
“ziggurat” shape (Busquets, 1992) along its outer profile, due to the difference of 1-2 floors between 
adjoining buildings. Losses of solar energy due to this smaller-scale formal detail may be irrelevant 
with  respect  to  overall  gain,  but  become determinant—and  must  be  taken  into  account—if,  for 
example, it is desired to install technical solar devices.
Dimensional  and  formal  proportions  within  a  single  manzana  also  affect  the  performance  and 
potential  exploitation  of  its  envelope.  The  relation  between the  height  of  the  buildings  and the 
distance between opposite sides of the block,  similarly to the H/W ratio, represents a key formal 
parameter for controlling interior shadows. The central patio could recover its original function as a 
public, green, sunny space or adopt one of technical use of the sun, while the vertical façades could 
provide an equitable daily amount of direct radiation to the interior spaces. 
Issues regarding solar  access in the Eixample district  highlight the importance of checking both 
general and specific  situations and maintaining a continuous  transversality  between the different  
scales of the project—in this case the urban fabric, the single block and its individual components. 
Such an approach is not only valid for this specific case, but can also be considered as a general 
criterion of analysis, aimed at achieving a thorough understanding and a correct interpretation of 
solar energy phenomena within the urban fabric.

5.2 Fabric orientation and façades exposure in different directions
In terms of overall energy gain, the hypothetical configuration seems to be particularly suitable in 
both winter and summer. Actually we also demonstrated that this is not true at all, because the entire 
north side of the block (exterior and interior) is completely shaded during the whole cool season.
If it were possible to transfer the concept of manzana from an urban to an architectural scale, in other 
words if the manzana were a single dwelling, this situation would be positive, because lack of direct  
radiation  on  the  north  side  would  be  compensated  by  that  on  the  other  façades.  However,  the 
apartments in the Eixample often do not have a double external façade, so individual passive use of 
sunlight would be denied to all north-facing dwellings.
The orientation defined by Ildefons Cerdà's Plan was precisely aimed at ensuring that all the façades 
(except,  of  course,  the small  north chamfer)  receive  at  least  one hour  of  direct  radiation on 21 
December and this is still true, despite the strong densification of the urban texture that occurred 
during the years of building speculation.

The new direction of the streets definitely does not fit with the Eixample’s morphological structure, 
but this does not mean that it could not work instead in another situation: combined, for example, 
with a different articulation of the volumes or with a differently-sized urban fabric, the N-S and E-O 
orientation can offer very good results with respect to solar access.
In the early phases of the planning process,  calculation of façade surface area in each direction 
(Compagnon, 2004) and its relation to the corresponding energy potential offers important additional 
information that is helpful for evaluating solar performance and determining

5.3 Observations about tools and methodology
The application of the Heliodón 2 software has given a fairly positive and reliable feedback in this 
first  step of  the  research.  Of course,  some points  of  the method need to  be refined—especially 
regarding  construction  and  management  of  a  three-dimensional  model,  which  should  be  more 
accurately simplified—in order to obtain more specific and versatile results.
Moreover,  we also have to keep in mind that the amounts of collected energy calculated by the 
program are  potential  theoretical  values;  they are  useful  for  evaluating  and  comparing  different 
scenarios, but in practical applications they need to be suitably translated into effective quantities, 
taking into account real meteorological data. This point needs to be more investigated and represents 
another interesting issue of the research.
Overall,  the  comparative methodology seems to offer interesting opportunities for research at  an 
urban scale.  The simplicity of  the process,  the  speed of  computation  and the immediacy of  the 
information provided suggest the possibility of extending its application to other high-density cases 
and considering other morphological variables, in order to compare performances of different urban 
forms with respect to solar availability and to obtain useful tips for future planning decisions.
