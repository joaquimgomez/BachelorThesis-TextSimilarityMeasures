Abstract 
 

The need to investigate and improve the current model of energy use is essential, 
especially in industry sectors that consume the most. One of these industries is 
tourism, and energy consumption will vary according to their needs, uses and 
location. Conduct an assessment of energy and exergy used in hotels, comparing two 
different types of accommodation facilities, is a good start to determine the current 
status and consumption, and can help in the future to determine whether there are 
better solutions to achieve energy savings and energy efficiency of facilities. Room 
air conditioning is one of the largest energy consumption of a hotel, so special 
attention must be paid to the facility´s location as well as its orientation and 
architectural solution. The aim of this paper is to analyze and compare the energy 
consumption and comfort conditions of two hotels in Samaná, the northwest of the 
Dominican Republic. 

 
 
Introduction 
 
Tourism it´s a changing sector that moves around tourists preferences, tastes and 
habits; it has a strong impact in the built environment and architecture. Nowadays 
tourism is one of the biggest industries in the world and it´s a positive element in 
society. However, due to their operational characteristics hotels present a high range 
on energy consumption [1]. The hotel industry is one of the largest sectors of tourism 
industry and emits up to 21% of CO2 emissions from this industry and it´s estimated 
that contributes up to 5% of these emissions globally [2]. 
 
For these reasons it is necessary to contribute in searching for a more sustainable and 
efficient touristic model, that integrates the environment, not only in means of a nice 
landscape, but is relevant in the design, construction and wise use of a hotel. One of 
the objectives to be achieved in a short period of time is to obtain optimum energy 
efficiency, consuming less energy, but providing the same services. Savings and 
sustainability actions are needed in the Caribbean tourism-based communities, 
promoting good energy practices and responsible tourism.  
 
In January 2011 two hotels have been visited Samaná, Dominican Republic. The 
information and measurements were taken on two types of hotel, the first in the Hotel 
Gran Bahia Principe Cayacoa of 5 stars, and the La Tambora Beach Resort 3-star.

Data on electricity consumption, water and hydrocarbons and the description of the 
facilities we have been provided by maintenance personnel in charge of the premises 
by meter readings, invoices and purchases that were carried out at hotels in 2010. 
Data regarding the monthly and annual average temperatures have been taken from 
the the Dominican Republic´s ONEM (Bureau of Meteorology). In addition, we have 
taken measurements outdoor and indoor temperature, as well as surface measurements 
and construction systems description. 
 

Hotel Descriptions 
 

Gran Bahía Principe Cayacoa

Junior Suites of 38m2, 73 Standard rooms overlooking the sea with 28m2 and 132 
Standard rooms with 28 m2. Moreover, it is buffet style restaurant with 1, 3 theme 
restaurants, 3 bars, 2 snack bars and 1 disco. 

A Standard room type was studied containing: 
 

• 2 full size beds (1.35 m x 2 m) or 1 King Size (2 m x 2 m) 
• Hydromassage cabins 
• Air conditioning

Cooling system 
There is a chiller tower (cooler) with ice water to refrigerate the whole facility. Each 
room has a handler of 1.906.200 J (1800 BTU). It starts up automatically when the 
room system (room electricity) it’s activated inserting the room key in a card holder. 
This unit is also manually handled in terms of powering on/off, air speed and 
temperature; it stops automatically when the balcony door is opened.

Data processing 
 
Services Descriptions in Dominican Republic 

 
Electricity 
In the Dominican Republic there are 3 power distribution companies, 2 companies of 
generation through fossil fuels and 4 hydroelectric generating stations, as well as 
independent producers. The technologies used for electricity generation are: Steam 
Turbines (18%), Gas Turbines (16%), Combined Cycle Engines (23%), Fuel Oil 
(25%), Diesel Engines (3%), Hydro (14%). These are coordinated by the Dominican 
Corporation of State Electrical Companies (CDEEE). It is noteworthy that due to 
interrupted power supply utilities, citizenship uses alternative means of generation. 
The touristic industry uses gasoline-powered electrical generators. This increases the 
overall fuel consumption [3]. 
 
Water 
Water resources are managed by the National Institute of Water Resources (INDRHI) 
and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. The Dominican Republic 
has some surface water resources of 20,000 million m3 (BCM) per year, of which 12 
BCM is groundwater recharge. However, the irregular spatial and seasonal 
distribution, coupled with high consumption in irrigation and urban water supply, 
resulting in water scarcity [4].  
 
Hydrocarbons 
The import, distribution and sale of hydrocarbons in the Dominican Republic is 
governed by the direction of Hydrocarbons of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce 
(MIC). In 2010, BBLS 37.284.983 of fuels, 1.181.924 cubic meters of natural gas and 
41,030 metric tons of coal were imported [5].

Exergy analysis: graphical representation 
 

We shall use an exergetic triangle with 3 vertexes. One of them is related to Energy 
(red), other to Hydrocarbons (green) and the third to water (blue). In the middle of the 
triangle it is zero efficiency use and in the vertex is the maximum efficiency.

Conclusion 
 
This paper studies the energy and exergy consumed by two different type hotels 
located in Samaná, Dominican Republic, for the year 2010; the hotel Cayacoa a four 
star hotel three-star La Tambora. It is clear that the consumption of some resources at 
both hotels is proportional to the occupation and capacity or type of facilities. We 
have seen that due to the type of tourists visiting the region, the highest occupancy 
was recorded in the winter and spring months, from December to May or so. 
Although in the summer months, the hotel Cayacoa presented a higher occupation, 
unlike the hotel La Tambora. 
 
Electricity consumption in the hotel Cayacoa is also high in the summer months, even 
though it had less occupation, due to the use of air conditioners. The interior room 
temperature (without air conditioning) varies very little from exterior room 
temperature. Air humidity contributes to the heat sensation, and the absence of natural 
room ventilation or building isolation, drives the client to use the air conditioning 
system for longer periods of time. In La Tambora hotel, in general, the consumption 
goes according to occupancy. The diesel consumption is increased by the use of 
means of alternate power generation at both hotels. Water consumption is very regular

throughout the year, except for the hotel Cayacoa, that in the month of July showed 
slightly higher water consumption than the rest of the year. 
 
The purpose of this paper is to determine the current status of energy use in hotels in 
the region of Samaná, to raise awareness and be able to design architectural solutions 
and facilities that contribute to a better and efficient use of energy. Therefore, it 
should be taken as a starting point in the development of future planning in the region. 
 
The triangle that we have shown reflects that there are strong difficulties for a country 
that has more than 75% of its energetic resources comes from abroad. A controlled 
reduction of consumption appears nowadays as the only solution. This controlled 
reduction has to be aware of nationals and visitors.  
 
Future development as our group is considering further studies with the help of 
recognized experts (1).
