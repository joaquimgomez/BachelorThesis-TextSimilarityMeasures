ABSTRACT: This paper deals with both physical and psychological dimensions of visual adaptability in architecture. The 

adaptive model of environmental comfort has been studied especially from the thermal point of view. Studies revealed 

that, when moving from one space to another, the sensation of thermal comfort at the arrival location is widely 

determined by prior exposure temperatures over the whole course. As all the senses work together in our perception of the 

environment, the movement between spaces with different environmental conditions has a considerable effect on our 

overall sense of comfort. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to investigate whether the adaptive model of 

thermal comfort can be extrapolated to a visual adaptive model. It may seem that when examining visual comfort 

conditions, users’ sensation of the same stimulus is more pleasant by contrast if they come from higher or lower energy 

levels than if they come from similar or gradually reached environmental conditions. But this extrapolation is not 

immediate. On the one hand, thermal and visual environmental changes take place neither at the same speed nor at the 

same energy level. On the other hand, users’ thermal and visual adaptation periods are not the same. The proposed 

methodology is based on an exhaustive observation of individual behavior performed with a sequenced exposure to 

different environmental conditions with controlled visual levels. The final outcome is the production of generic physical 

and psychological conclusions related to the experience of changing environmental conditions, since exposure time, 

expectation and predicted environmental conditions seem particularly important in the final sense of comfort. The results 

can be applied not only to general change in environmental conditions but also while walking through transitional 

spaces. 

Keywords: visual comfort, adaptive approach, transitional, transient, survey. 

 

 

INTRODUCTION 

People have a natural tendency to adapt to changing 

conditions in their environment. This natural tendency is 

expressed in the adaptive approach to thermal comfort, as 

developed by Nicol and Humphreys [1]. However, this 

tendency is not solely applicable to thermal adaptation 

but it also encompasses all human beings’ sensorial 

fields, being processes such as adaptation of vision or 

hearing fairly common in everyday life. These senses are 

particularly important when interacting with our 

environment and getting information on our 

environmental and architectural surroundings. Therefore, 

this paper takes an adaptive approach to visual comfort 

based on the potential extrapolation of some of the 

concepts from the most recent studies performed on 

thermal comfort, given that this is the field where the 

adaptive model has been developed the most. 

 

With regard to thermal comfort, there are many 

contextual variables that play a role in the sense of 

comfort. Some of them are due to the environmental 

parameters that are dependent upon the climate, while 

others are due to user-dependent factors, be they social, 

physiological or psychological. Examples can include the 

users’ kind of activity, clothing, anatomy or posture, 

education or how the building and its facilities are used 

[1, 2]. In this sense, the time factor is particularly 

significant either in terms of the speed at which the 

environmental changes take place or the period needed 

by the user to get acclimated. What is more, from the 

physiological standpoint, human beings are particularly 

sensitive to the perception of changes in environmental 

stimuli. However, if the stimulus remains steady, humans 

may experience fatigue in the excitement of the sense 

receptors, thus leading to a decline in the perception of 

the stimulus. For this reason, some variability in the 

environmental conditions can come to be perceived more 

pleasant than being in environments with highly neutral 

or steady conditions [3, 4, 5, 6]. 

 

As Nicol and Humphreys state, if a change occurs 

that produces discomfort, people react in ways which 

tend to restore their comfort. According to their research, 

this can be done by two types of actions: changing the 

conditions to match their comfort and changing the 

comfort temperature to match the prevailing conditions 

[1]. In contrast to these more static situations, such as an 

office building or home, Chun and Tamura researched 

the thermal comfort in more dynamic situations, such as 

those that occur because a user is walking through a 



PLEA2012 - 28th Conference, Opportunities, Limits & Needs Towards an environmentally responsible architecture Lima, Perú 7-9 November 2012 

 

transitional space. In this case, when thermal changes 

take place more quickly, what they call the “relative 

evaluation tendency” happens. Their findings revealed 

that thermal comfort at one point in a transitional space is 

determined by the relative temperature at that location 

compared to the average value of prior exposure 

temperatures [7]. 

 

To the contrary, regarding visual or acoustic energy, 

regardless of whether it is a situation with a static user 

and changing conditions or a more dynamic situation 

with a user in motion, visual and acoustic energy changes 

are more frequent and usually take place at a higher 

speed compared to thermal energy. In this sense, human 

beings’ response is much quicker, that is, their visual and 

auditory adaptation to the change takes place at a much 

higher speed than their adaptation to changes in 

temperature. 

 

For this study, we experimented with the specific 

case of visual adaptation and the users’ response, setting 

aside the possible functioning of acoustic adaptation for 

future studies. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: Schematic diagram of adaptation to the dark: the 

recovery of the visual threshold following bright-light 

adaptation as a function of the amount of time spent in 

darkness. (Version of a diagram from John E. Dowling [8].) 

 

 

In this aspect, visual adaptation is due to a 

modification of the sensitivity of the eye’s receptive 

organs to the stimulus. In visual adaptation to both 

darkness and light, there is an initial mechanism which 

consists of the immediate change in the size of the pupil, 

which regulates the amount of light that reaches the 

retina via fluctuations in the aperture in a range of 1 to 

16. Simultaneously, the sensitivity of the cones and rods 

(cells located on the eye’s retina that receive the light) 

also enlarge or shrink respectively due to the increase or 

destruction of the light-sensitive chemical substance. For 

this reason, adaptation to darkness takes around 5 to 10 

minutes in the case of photopic vision (cones), while in 

the case of scotopic vision (rods) it takes approximately 

20 to 30 minutes (Fig. 1). In the opposite sense, 

adaptation to light is much quicker and takes place in just 

a few seconds [8, 9].

low level of light, adapts his vision to the illuminated work of 

art and then continues circulating at the same light level as at 

the start. (Version of a picture of Mario Gonzalo “Cachero” 

posted at: lalugareja.blogspot.com.) 

 

 

There are many situations in our everyday lives when 

there is a momentary change in the light conditions, thus 

leading to a contrast towards greater light or darkness. 

Clear examples of this include looking out a window, 

stopping to look at the display window of a shop, 

walking around a museum (Fig. 2) and going from one 

room to another through a transitional space [10]. Given 

this, we wondered how this kind of change in the light 

levels affects the user’s visual comfort and the adaptation 

of their perception of light. 

 

 

RESEARCH METHODS 

The methodology used to examine this adaptive approach 

to light comfort is based on the conclusions yielded 

through laboratory surveys performed with a series of 

young architects. They are all 2011-12 “Architecture, 

Energy and Environment” Master’s degree students and 

2011-2012 “Architecture and the Environment: 

Integration of Renewable Energies into Architecture” 

Master’s degree students at the School of Architecture of 

Barcelona (UPC). 

 

Even though we do not discard the possibility of 

administering field surveys in the future, since this study 

examines visual comfort and we know that both the 

energy changes in light conditions and users’ visual 

adaptation take place at relatively quick speeds, in field 

surveys there is a lower ability to control the conditions 

and as a result a higher probability that the results might 

be distorted. Likewise, we chose to administer laboratory 

surveys since in this kind of survey not only can there be 

the predefined environmental conditions and a higher 

capacity for control but also the range of conditions that 

users consider comfortable tend to be stricter than in field 

surveys, where users have more chances to adapt to the 

environment.

Regarding the description of the design of the 

experiment, it was performed with 24 healthy 

individuals, eight men and 16 women between the ages 

of 24 and 36. The participants come from different 

countries in Europe and the Americas. Likewise, they are 

all architects and students in post-graduate courses 

related to environmental energies in architecture, so they 

all have some knowledge about light issues as well as a 

certain discernment regarding the units used to measure 

illuminance (lux). 

 

The survey respondents were seated, as shown in 

Figure 3, in a room with multiple light scenes, of which 

three standard scenes were chosen: scene A, scene B and 

scene C. In the multiple runs of the experiment, these 

three light scenes produced average illuminance levels 

over a useful working surface (located 70 cm over the 

floor): A = 530 lux, B = 7.5 lux and C = 1 lux. The 

changes between the different light scenes took place 

almost instantaneously, since we used fluorescent lamps 

with quick switch control (Fig. 3).

location of the users in the room. 

 

 

The difference in illuminances (average values in lux 

over the working surface) between what was seen by the 

survey respondents seated under the centre of the light 

source and those located at the ends was insignificant for 

low illuminance levels, on the order of 3 lux in medium 

levels and 170 lux at high levels (Table 1). In this sense, 

if we bear in mind that human perception follows a 

logarithmic relation, this difference in measured values at 

medium and high levels of light should be clearly 

unimportant in the different users’ perceptions.

The 24 participants took part in four different 

experiments: experiment A1, experiment A2, experiment 

C1 and experiment C2. Each of the four experiments had 

three phases. The first phase began with a light scene 

with an initial illuminance value over the useful surface 

which remained constant over a certain period of time. 

The second phase began with an initial change in the 

light scene with a different illuminance value over the 

useful surface, which once again remained constant over 

a given period of time. Finally, the third phase began 

with a second change, which returned to the same light 

scene as in phase 1 (that is, with the same illuminance 

value over the useful surface as at the start), which once 

again remained constant over a given period of time. 

 

The participants in the experiments were never given 

any complementary information on the experiment in 

advance. Thus, we tried to avoid their having any kind of 

predisposition or possible expectation in terms of the 

results. 

 

Regarding the timeline of the experiments (Fig. 4), 

the first phase in the experiment required a prolonged 

period of time (10 minutes), since it was aimed at 

ensuring that the survey respondents’ vision was 

accustomed to the initial light level. What is more, during 

this first phase, the respondents were informed about the 

existing light level on the useful working surface so that 

they could have a point of reference when later 

estimating the light level. During the entire process (all 

three phases) in each of the four experiments, the 

subjects were involved in doing Sudoku puzzles in order 

to keep them entertained and thus ensure that their vision 

was set on a specific area. Likewise, the fact that they 

were engaged with Sudoku puzzles, which have numbers 

of a certain size and color over a homogenous white 

background, enabled us to ensure that the assessment and 

estimate of the light levels that they would be requested 

later were always made with regard to the same point of 

reference. 

 

After the ten minutes in phase 1 had elapsed, there 

was a change in the light scene, and therefore in the 

illuminance of the useful work surface, thus ushering in 

phase 2 of the experiment. This phase remained constant 

over a relatively short period of time (45 seconds). 

During this period, 30 seconds after having begun phase 

2, the respondents were asked to assess the light level at 

that moment compared to the light level in the first 

phase. What is more, they were also asked to estimate the 

approximate illuminance (value in lux) on the working 

surface. 

 

Forty-five seconds after phase 2 began, there was a 

second change in the light scene, going back to the 

illuminance of the useful working surface in the first 

phase and thus beginning phase 3 of the experiment. In 



PLEA2012 - 28th Conference, Opportunities, Limits & Needs Towards an environmentally responsible architecture Lima, Perú 7-9 November 2012 

 

this phase, the respondents were once again asked to 

value the light level compared to the first phase, and to 

estimate the approximate illuminance (value in lux) over 

the working surface. As shown in Figure 4, they were 

asked this 2 seconds, 15 seconds and 4 minutes after the 

beginning of the third phase.

procedure of a standard experiment. 

 

 

The respondents were asked two kinds of questions at 

the different points in the experimental process. First, in 

phases 2 and 3 they were asked to comparatively assess 

the illuminance level compared to the level in phase 1. 

To make this assessment, they used an adaptation for 

light of the ASHRAE scale and the Bedford Scale of 

Thermal Comfort (Table 2). Secondly, they were also 

asked to make in these phases an absolute assessment of 

the illuminance (estimated sensation in lux) on the 

working surface (bearing in mind that they knew the lux 

level in phase 1 in advance).

In the specific case of experiment A1, there was a 

succession of A-B-A scenes, while in the case of 

experiment A2, there was a succession of A-C-A scenes. 

We shall see how both cases started with a given high 

level of illuminance (530 lux), then dropped to lower 

levels (7.5 lux and 1 lux, respectively) and then went 

back to the initial level (530 lux). Given this sequence, 

we predicted that the respondents’ answers would reflect 

different assessments of their sensation of light according 

to whether phase 2 was closer to or further from the 

initial illuminance level. 

 

In contrast, the C1 experiment (with a succession of 

C-B-D scenes) and C2 experiment (with a succession of 

C-A-C scenes) started with low illuminance levels (1 

lux), which were then raised to higher levels (7.5 lux and 

530 lux, respectively) and then went back to the initial 

level (1 lux) (Fig. 5). In this case, since the process was 

the opposite of experiments A1 and A2, we predicted 

that the responses would also be different since users’ 

adaptation time to brighter or darker levels are different.

illuminance levels (lux) on the working surface. 

 

 

The experiments were performed in March 2012, and 

the other environmental conditions were monitored 

throughout the entire experiment to ensure that they fell 

within acceptable comfort margins. In this way, we 

attempted to prevent these conditions from interfering in 

the perception of light and to minimize any possible 

effect of synesthesia. During the entire process, the 

temperatures were maintained within the range of 22.2º 

C to 22.4º C. The relative humidity ranged from 44% to 

46.5%. Most of the time, the acoustic range was between 

38 dB and 40 dB. The CO2 levels were always kept 

within acceptable ranges, with values that spanning 

between 1100 ppm (parts per million) and 1305 ppm. 

What is more, the experiment was performed between 

2.5 and 4 hours after the respondents had eaten. Finally, 



PLEA2012 - 28th Conference, Opportunities, Limits & Needs Towards an environmentally responsible architecture Lima, Perú 7-9 November 2012 

 

we avoided any kind of external lighting during the 

experiment to prevent interference and a distortion in the 

results. 

 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Regarding the results of the experiment, there are two 

kinds of assessments to analyze. 

 

The first is the comparative assessment, that is, the 

light level that the survey respondents perceived when 

going back to the original illuminance value after 

experiencing a clearly higher or lower level of light 

(experiments C1 and C2, and A1 and A2, respectively). 

By observing the results of all four cases (Fig. 6, 7), we 

can see how in all of them the respondents overestimated 

or underestimated the illuminance once the original 

lighting level was restored (when entering phase 3). That 

is, when there was a change in the illuminance level, the 

sensation of light exceeded the real value in the direction 

of the change. For example, experiment A1 starts with a 

high illuminance level of 530 lux, in the first change this 

level drops to 7.5 lux, and when the conditions return to 

the initial value of 530 lux, the respondents’ sensation 

was a higher illuminance level than that value. What is 

more, in all the experiments we noted how in just a brief 

time (a few seconds), the respondents recovered their real 

sensation of light. In experiment A2 (530/1/530 lux), 

where the differences in illuminance values are greater 

than in A1, the effect of having a sensation of brighter 

light also occurs, although not so drastically. In 

experiment C2 (1/530/1 lux), whose sequence is the 

opposite of A2, the assessment of the sensation of light 

follows behavior quite similar yet opposite to that of 

experiment A2. Finally, in experiment C1 (1/7.5/1 lux), 

we noted how the respondents had little ability to discern 

the sensation of light, perhaps due to the similarity 

between the two illuminance levels.

experiments A1 and A2. 
 

 

 

Figure 7: Visual sensation for each of the illuminances in 

experiments C1 and C2. 
 

 

The second assessment to analyze is the absolute 

estimated value, that is, the illuminance level in lux that 

the survey subjects estimated once the initial value was 

restored. On this point we should recall that the survey 

respondents are all architects who are familiar with the 

units and that in all four experiments their point of 

reference is the respective illuminance values in phase 1. 

Likewise, they do not know that the illuminance in phase 

3 has the same value as in phase 1. By examining the 

results in all four cases, we can see how the survey 

respondents displayed some variation in their 

assessments of the estimated lux values over the useful 

surface. For example, in the specific case of experiment 

A1, which had the most common average conditions, 

there is a standard deviation in all three assessments in 

phase 3 of 68, 68 and 71 lux over the estimated 580, 565 

and 532  (Fig. 8). What is more, we should note that by 

carefully examining these results, there seems to be a 

kind of predisposition by some of the respondents to 

estimate the lux they assume there to be instead of the 

lux they estimated there to be. That is, some respondents 

distinguished between what they might know and the 

sensation they have. We also found that even though 

initially none of the respondents showed major signs of 

visual impairments, one of the subjects did show some 

signs. Following with the example of experiment A1, we 

can see how the estimate of illuminance is approximately 

10% higher than the average illuminance. What is more, 

in this case it took around 30 seconds to recover half of 

this value (Fig. 9).

experiment A1.

phase 3 of experiment A1, compared to the measured (dots). 

 

 

Finally, even though this topic is being left for future 

studies, we can predict that in acoustics a similar 

overestimation and underestimation effect of the 

perceived decibels may occur after a change in the 

acoustic level, although a priori it seems that the acoustic 

adaptation might be a bit slower than adaptation to light 

yet substantially quicker than adaptations to temperature 

changes. In any event, the kind of experiment to be 

conducted must be carefully studied bearing in mind all 

the variables that can specifically influence this approach 

to acoustic adaptability, including the kind of noise, its 

informational content, its dynamic, etc. 

 

 

CONCLUSION 

This paper is an initial approach to the adaptive model of 

light comfort. Just as with the thermal model, the 

experiment in the visual field shows us how after a 

change in the illuminance level the sensation of light is 

influenced by prior exposure. When there is a change to a 

higher illuminance level, the light sensation exceeds the 

actual light level and the viewer has the sense of higher 

illuminance. To the contrary, when the change is toward 

a lower level of light, the sensation is lower illuminance. 

What is more, in a relatively short period of time, the 

sensation gradually approaches the real value. The 

degree of overestimation or underestimation of the light 

sensation and the time needed to recover the real value 

are related to the magnitude of this change. These 

conclusions came from several laboratory experiments 

conducted with 24 subjects, all of them architecture 

graduates who were familiar with light magnitudes. The 

results can be applied in situations in which light 

conditions change and in circulation through transitional 

spaces.
