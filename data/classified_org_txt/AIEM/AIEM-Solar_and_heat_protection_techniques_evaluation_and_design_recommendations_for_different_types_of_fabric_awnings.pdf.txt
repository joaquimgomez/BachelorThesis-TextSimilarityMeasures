ABSTRACT

Cloths and fabrics have always being used as solar protection. Interior and exterior curtains, urban 
and building awnings are common resources in Mediterranean architecture to create comfort in hot 
summers. Solar and heat control (for cooling) through external opaque protections present two main 
functions: a) On transparent elements of the envelope: the regulation of impinging radiation direct 
transmission  to  the  interior  space.  b)  On  opaque  elements  of  the  envelope:  the  control  of  the 
impinging radiation on massive materials that would absorb and storage heat to release it to the 
interior space with a time delay (thermal inertia). In this paper, results of temperature monitoring of 
two different awnings (65% and 90% shading fabric / within and over vertical parapets) in similar 
courtyards in the city of Mendoza are presented.  Mendoza,  located in central  western Argentina 
(32º40’ southern  latitude,  68º51’ western  longitude,  750  m  above  sea  level),  has  a  temperate 
continental  climate  with  hot  summers  and  cold  winters.  Therefore,  the  use  of  solar  and  heat 
protection techniques in the hot season are crucial. Results analyse comfort conditions that lead to 
design recommendations to achieve optimal responses with fabric awnings in courtyards.

INTRODUCTION

For many years now it is obvious that energy consumption of buildings has to be reduced in order to 
develop a sustainable architecture. Residential and tertiary buildings being responsible for around the 
third  of  energy  consumption  in  western  countries,  their  impact  on  the  achievement  on  Kyoto 
protocol’s objectives is significant. 

To develop such energy-efficient  buildings,  designers may find themselves on two sources  of 
knowledge: personal background acquired on former studies and experience from other buildings, 
description of technological choices, controls, and monitored results. As such publications are scarce, 
generic studies handling with a systematic approach of a particular or global design method are used 
as the second source of knowledge. (Van Moeseke et al., 2007). Therefore the great importance of 
evaluation and design recommendations for monitored real case studies.

Bioclimatic  conditioning  of  buildings  relies  on  the  design  strategies  applied,  associated  with 
formal  and  material  definition  of  the  project  and  its  immediate  surroundings.  Solar  and  heat 
protection techniques are thus key strategies to ensure natural comfort, specially in high heliophany 
hot summer urban locations with slow air movement. 

It seems that a permanent yardstick would be established by relating their importance to human 
reactions, where a reasonable ratio would be 1 to 2. According to this, shading at overheating times is 
twice as important as heat gain during the unheated period. (Olgyay et al, 1957) 

On  open  space  design,  site  specific  characteristics  are  always  determinant  and,  even  though

architectural tradition and culture have always addressed urban open space issue, there are still scarce 
works that revise environmental quality funded in scientific studies and validation. (Sala et al, 2000)

Open  spaces  un  cities  play  a  decisive  role  in  their  thermal  behaviour.  The  courtyard,  as  a 
structuring  element  of  the  architectural  project,  is  a  significant  open  space  through  which  heat 
exchanges  between  interior  and  exterior  occur.  (Canton  et  al.,  2006)  Improving  microclimatic 
conditions in courtyards in summer depends on controlled dynamic shading. 

Shadow is the dark area behind an opaque matter that obstacles the radiant heat and direct light 
from radiant source. It will be possible to produce shadow if the location of sun as the light and solar 
energy source  is  known and determined.  The effectiveness  of  a  shading device  depends on  the 
proportionate success with which it  covers a given surface during the overheated period without 
interception of the sun’s energy during unheated times. 

Operable external shading devices can be of many types, including shutters (hinged, sliding, etc.) 
routable fins horizontal plates, retractable venetian blinds or canvas awnings. They can be made of 
many materials, such as wood, metals, asbestos-cement, fabrics and so on. The common feature to all 
operable devices is that they can be adjusted at will to either exclude or admit solar radiation. As with 
fixed devices, they intercept the sun’s rays before the rays hit the envelope. (Givoni, 1994) 

Solar  and  heat  control  (for  cooling)  through  external  opaque  protections  present  two  main 
functions: 

a)  On  transparent  elements  of  the  envelope:  the  regulation  of  impinging  radiation  direct 
transmission to  the interior  space.  Operable external  shading devices  can reduce solar  heat  gain 
through windows and other glazed areas down to about 10 to 15% of the radiation impinging on the 
wall. (Givoni, 1994). 

b)  On  opaque  elements  of  the  envelope:  the  control  of  the  impinging  radiation  on  massive 
materials that would absorb and storage heat to release it to the interior space with a time delay 
(thermal inertia). 

Cloths and fabrics have always being used as solar protection. Interior and exterior curtains, urban 
and building awnings are common resources in Mediterranean architecture to create comfort in hot 
summers. 

Fabrics,  commonly  used  as  sun  screens,  awnings  and  curtains,  conform  a  varied  world  of 
materials. Their behaviour depends on their thickness and colour. A light fabric -in thickness and in 
colour- will  allow an important amount of incident radiation and also it will reflect a part of it,  
absorbing little. A thick, dark canvas will have a low transmission but also a low reflection, therefore 
it  will  have  an  important  absorption  and  will  irradiate  heat.  (Paricio,  1997).   In  wet  climates 
membranes  made  of  impermeable  fabric  are  usually  used,  while  in  hot  dry climates  perforated 
membranes are preferable, to make the screen airily and light and thus to function as solar and heat 
protection. (Sala et al, 2000)

Besides the material properties of the shading device it is also important its design as it can be 
related to the space in a variety of solutions that may change the microclimatic situation of the 
protected exterior. Awnings can be attached to a window or to the entire courtyard, they can also go 
from one wall to the other, acting as a roof or be suspended over the walls acting as a ventilated roof. 

If  the space between the exterior  protection and the glass is  perfectly ventilated,  the shadow 
coefficient and thermal transmittance respect to a single glass can be around 0.16 (Paricio, 1997). 

In this  paper two different awnings (65% and 90% shading fabric material  /  within and over 
vertical parapets) that protect similar “box type” courtyards belonging to single family houses in the 
city of Mendoza are studied.

1. CASE STUDY

1.1 Climate and location

The study cases are  located in  Mendoza,  in  central  western Argentina (32º40’ southern latitude, 
68º51’ western  longitude,  750  m above  sea  level),  in  a  semi-arid  continental  climate  with  low 
percentages of atmospheric relative humidity and high heliophany (See Figure 1). It corresponds to a 
BWk  climate,  according  to  the  climate  classification  of  Koeppen-Geiger-Pohl  (1953).  Some 
meteorological records are shown in Table 1. 

1.2 Compared courtyards

Both courtyards belong to houses in which the main façade faces North (towards the Equator in the 
South Hemisphere). In both cases they are wider on the North – South axis (lenght) and narrower on 
the East – West axis (width). Courtyards also have similar area: Case 1 with 20.46 m2 (3.10 x 6.60  
m) and Case 2 with 23.76 m2 (4.40 x 5.40 m).  On both cases width and height proportions are 
approximate to 1.5 to 2, that is, the vertical parapets prevail over the horizontal ones, therefore their 
morphology is called “boxed – type courtyard” (Cantón et al, 2009). See Figure 2.

Courtyards  also present  similar  constructive materials  and finishes:  uninsulated massive brick 
walls painted in a light colour and massive floors made of concrete floors tiles and grey mosaic 
respectively. As solar and heat protection they present shading – fabric awnings that run horizontally 
on the North-South axis. Both awnings are green but their shading fabric has different thickness. 
Even though their height from the floor is the same (4.40 m) an important difference between the two 
awnings is their relative position to the walls. Case 1 is boxed within the perimeter of the walls that

1.3 Solar protections

Shading  fabrics  are  usually  commercialized  for  agriculture  purposes,  nevertheless  their  use  on 
awnings in the urban context is becoming more common than before due to their longer life, low 
maintenance and low prices. They also offer a wider variety of options (textures, densities, weights, 
resistances, colours) when compared with the traditional canvas.  

Shading  fabrics  are  made  of  100%  HDPE.  HDPE  is  a  thermoplastic  SPI  resin  with  an 
identification  coding  system  2  and  Unicode  U+2674.  High-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  or 
polyethylene high-density (PEHD) is a polyethylene thermoplastic made from petroleum. It takes 
1.75 kilograms of petroleum (in terms of energy and raw materials) to make one kilogram of HDPE. 
HDPE is commonly recycled. In 2007, the global HDPE market reached a volume of more than 30 
million tons. (Ceresana Research, 2008) 

Even though we are dealing with a petroleum derivate whose emissions are 1100 kg of carbon 
dioxide per kg of product (Clough et al., 1995) it is important to take into account first that it is being 
widely used so it is important to know how it works for this purpose and second that to produce 
shading fabrics  it  is  used almost  pure and therefore it  can be easily isolated and recycled.  This 
information along with less pollutant alternative materials should be given to users so they make a 
choice among available possibilities and so they dispose the shading fabric when no longer needed 
responsively.

On Figure 4 are presented five types of shading fabrics that change their tissue as they graduate 
from 35% shading to 90% shading. Case study 1 presents an awning with 90% shading fabric and 
Case study 2 has an awning with 65% shading fabric. Both materials are identified in Figure 4 and 
their characteristics, as given by the manufacturer are presented in Table 2.

2. MEASUREMENT METHOD

Air temperature and relative humidity monitoring were performed with data loggers ONSET HOBO 
H12 every 15 minutes for a summer representative period of 20 days on each case. Case 1 was 
measured from January 3rd to January 22nd 2008, and Case 2 from January 3rd to January 22nd 2010. 

On each case, a sensor was placed “under the shading fabric awning” and a control sensor was 
placed outside the influence of the fabric awning named after “exterior”.  Every data logger was 
suspended at a mean height of 2 metres.

3. RESULTS

On Figures 5 and 6 are presented the measured temperatures for Cases 1 and 2 in the complete 
period. Even though on the measured period, temperatures on summer 2010 were about 1ºC higher in 
average  compared  to  the  ones  measured  on  2008,  differences  in  each  awning’s  behaviour  are 
noticeable. 

On  Case  1,  around  6:00  p.m.  when  maximum  temperatures  were  recorded  on  the  exterior, 
temperatures under the 90%-shading fabric canopy are around 4ºC under; while on Case 2 their are 
about 9ºC below the exterior ones. That makes a difference of 5ºC between cases and can be the 
turning point from comfort to the lack of it. At night, if the awnings are closed and the courtyard  
massive  surfaces  “see”  the  sky,  as  most  nights  are  clear  temperatures  lower  near  exterior  ones 
allowing radiative cooling. On Case 2 there were some clear nights, specially January 6 th, 7th and 8th, 
in which the awning was not closed and therefore temperatures remained about 4ºC over the exterior  
ones .   

Temperature daily variations on sunny days are also much higher on Case 1 (around 10 – 12ºC) 
that almost follows external behaviour (14 – 16 ºC), than on Case 2 (4 – 6ºC) been easier to maintain  
the comfort sensation even though temperatures rise over pre-established comfort limits. As these are 
exterior spaces temperature ranges within comfort are.

On Table 3, mean temperatures of total measured days and for the two compared similar clear sky 
days are presented. It can be noticed that mean temperatures on selected days are lower than total 
mean  temperatures.  Even  though  that,  differences  between  exterior  measurements  and  the  ones 
performed under the fabric awnings are similar between selected days an the total of studied days. 

It is also important to notice that under the awning on Case 1 temperatures are almost 1ºC higher 
than in the exterior, even though maximums are lower than the highest temperatures in the exterior. 
See Figure 5 and its analyses.     

On Case 2 a different result is obtained as mean temperatures are close to 1.5ºC lower under the  
fabric awning than in the exterior. This goes along with the obtained results from Figure 6. 

Ventilation  possibilities  due  to  its  upper  location  in  relation  with  courtyard’s  walls  and  the 
possibility of air movement through the fabric change drastically the conditions between Cases 1 and 
2, even though some days the awning remained open at night time in Case 2. ventilation possibilities 
through the fabric itself is a material possibility very different from traditional canvas that are even 
thicker than the fabric used on Case 1 and therefore prevent air movement and concentrate heated air 
under the shading device. 

4. COMFORT CONDITIONS

The comfort conditions in the different scenarios analyzed have been evaluated by calculating the 
percentage of hours in which the open spaces are within the comfort range. The range’s definition for 
each of the considered variable  – dry bulb temperature– was determined through the use of the 
following procedure:  

Thermal  Comfort:  using  the  analytical  equation  of  the  Thermopreferendum (Auliciems et  al, 
1997) the comfort temperature for a specific location in a given period of the year and considering 
the variations of the location’s climate.

Tn = 17.6 + 0.31 x Tm          
Where:  Tn:  Comfort temperature 
Tm: Mean location’s temperature  

The range is determined by a variation of 2.5 ºC above and below Tn’s calculated value for the 
location. For the city of Mendoza, during the warm season, Tn = 25.4 ºC and the range’s limits are 
22.9 and 27.9 ºC.

The  contours  obtained  for  temperature  show,  for  each  measured  courtyard,  that the  comfort 
conditions related to temperature vary between day and night. During daytime the temperatures are 
within the comfort range and above it, with significant differences between the assessed scenarios

and, at night time, below the range with less pronounced differences. See Figure 7.
The  quantification  in  terms  of  percentages  of  the  different  comfort  ranges  on  selected  days 

indicates that, in the daily behaviour, Case 2 features the larger quantity of hours in comfort (59 %). 
For  Case  1  such  percentage  decreases  to  46  %.  The  main  difference  stands  on  the  higher 
temperatures registered on Case 1 on disconfort hours (28 – 35ºC) that are notoriously over the ones 
registered on the same period on Courtyard 2 (28 – 30ºC). On Case 1 27% of the time temperatures 
are over 30ºC while on Case 2, 100% of the time temperatures are under 30ºC.

5. DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

Traditional exterior awnings are efficient if they present the following characteristics:
- Colour: usually green. It can allow to the courtyard only 5% of the impinging radiation. It 

will absorb radiation so the following variables are crucial:
- Light density fabric: usually half-shadow fabric. It consents air movement at all times that 

prevents overheating by retaining hot air under the awning.
- Separation from vertical parapets: usually from 0.30 to 0.60 m. It should be a temporary 

ventilated roof allowing horizontal air movement at all times.
- A dedicated user. Awnings demand a daily movement so they will be open during daytime 

and closed at night or in very windy days.
