Abstract: Analyzing the Köppen–Geiger climate classification and available climate data for the
southern European Mediterranean coast, eight reference geolocations were selected for this analysis:
the cities of Valencia, Barcelona, Marseille, Rome, Koper, Split, Athens and Nicosia. The first part of
the research applies the climate potential for natural ventilation (CPNV) methodology that evaluates
the theoretical availability of natural ventilation (NV) for each city location corresponding to human
hygrothermal conditions. The second part of the article evaluates possible cooling energy savings (ES)
applying the advanced natural ventilation (ANV) space-cooling strategy. A hypothetical four-story
atrium office building model is designed for the building performance simulation (BPS) using
mixed-mode (or hybrid-mode) and night-time natural ventilation (NNV) approaches. The objective
is to present a comparison overview of possible space cooling ES between chosen geolocations. In the
context of the current European Union’s (EU) energy transition (ET) process, the article displays ANV
possibilities, as a renewable energy source (RES), in the reduction of building space cooling energy
demands (ED) on the electricity grid.

1. Introduction

The world’s building sector, comprising residential and service sectors, consumes about 35% of
total global final energy [1], and at the European Union (EU) level it accounts about 59% of the gross
total energy demands (ED) [2]. According to the World Energy Council’s set of scenarios, world
electricity demand will double to 2060, comparing to 2014 reference data. The estimation is based
on the future expansion of enabling technologies and the growth of the world’s middle class with its
improved standard of living [3].

Since the consideration for the environmental impact and energy efficiency (EE) arose at the world
level, the EU defined action plans for managing building ED and the extended use of renewable energy
resources (RES). Passive natural ventilation (NV) cooling strategies have a long tradition in vernacular
architecture and today are revised according to new researches in the field of human thermal comfort
(TC). Such revalorized techniques are introduced in the modern building concept in accordance with
today’s normatives and so became associated with the main principles in the contemporary sustainable
building design. Natural ventilative features are applied in passive and low or zero-energy buildings
concepts and are characterized by the possibility to maintain the indoor TC level with entire or partial
reduction of building cooling ED.

Today’s EE objectives among EU member states are decreasing progressively heating and cooling
(HC) ED while expanding the distribution of RES [4]. Currently in the EU, 45% of energy for HC is
used in the residential sector, 37% in industry and 18% in service sector. Each building sector has an
ability to decrease ED and to increase EE and supply from RES [5]. In 2015, the EU’s share of RES in
the total final ED was 16.4%, and approximately 8% was deployed for buildings HC [6,7].

The Mediterranean basin is marked by rapid urban development that has led to a heavy
concentration of population across the coastal urban settlements with common over-development
effect. Regarding the southern European Mediterranean coast, the most populated regions are the
coastline of the Iberian Peninsula, the western Adriatic coast and the Aegean coastal region [8]. The EU
member states, as developed and high-income countries, have a high level of ED with a proportionally
large ecological footprint [9].

The objective of this research is to present a survey of the climatic capacity and useful data for the
application of advanced natural ventilation (ANV) principles in contemporary EE building design.
In this respect, eight southern European geolocations are selected along the Mediterranean coast,
situated in seven EU countries (Spain, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece and Cyprus) and within
four climate zones.

Several recent works that evaluated NV cooling possibilities are also related to the Mediterranean
region. Chen et al. [10] computed NV potential in 1854 world geolocations applying the “NV
hour” indicator. The work, furthermore, provides a comparison overview of energy savings (ES)
for 60 of the world’s largest cities. Chiesa and Grosso [11,12] defined the “Cooling Degree Hour”,
a synthetic parameter, analysing 50 reference cities across the Mediterranean region and 55 major
European cities. Kolokotroni and Heiselberg [13] presented contemporary NV possibilities with
an overview of a broad range of innovative techniques and evaluation tools. The publication also
includes a survey of numerous reference-built projects. Pesic et al. [14] conducted an analysis for three
reference geolocations on the Catalonian coastline, evaluating hygrothermal potential for generating
NV principles and building space cooling ES based on the cross-ventilation approach.

2.1. Energy Balance Overview

Analysing seven EU member states that are chosen for this study, gross electricity production
by fuel shows that coal power source dominates in Greece (51%) and Slovenia (21.6%) while the
electricity generated from gas prevails in Italy (33.5%), Spain (17%) and Greece (13.4%) (Figure 1a).
Electricity produced from nuclear power is present in France (77.5%), Slovenia (36.5%) and Spain
(20.6%) [15]. Although Spain has banned construction of new nuclear reactors and those existing
should be dismantled by 2022, France has plans to expand nuclear capacities in the future [16].

RES in Slovenia (92.5%) and Croatia (90.8%) [15].

2.2. Energy Dependency and Annual Change in Final Electricity Consumption

Since 2004, the EU’s imports of energy from non-member countries have been greater than its
primary production, so that in 2015 it reached a 54% dependency level [17]. Among the group of seven
Mediterranean countries, the highest energy dependence level is in Cyprus (96.2%), while the levels
of Spain, Italy and Greece are in the range between 70% and 80% (Figure 2a). France, Slovenia and
Croatia have energy dependence rates below 50%.

In relation to the average annual change in the final ED at the country level, the highest growth
rates are in Cyprus (3.4%), Spain (2.5%) and Greece (2.3%), while Croatia keeps the lowest level (0.5%)
in this group of countries (Figure 2b) [18].

2.3. Space Cooling Energy Demands 

Today’s buildings’ cooling and ventilation systems are mainly powered by electricity [19], and 

as electric air-conditioning technology prevails in the current buildings cooling market, space cooling 

ED are mostly hidden in the overall electricity consumption data [20]. In this regard, the gross final 

space cooling ED at the EU level are largely unknown so that such data mainly rely on the 

assumptions from related studies. 

Pardo et al. [21] mapped space HC energy loads at the EU level by each building sector. The 

report includes analysis divided into different groups of member states with a closer look at the 

United Kingdom, France and Germany. Tvärne et al. [22] conducted an analysis about the district 

cooling market, displaying current and future estimated trends of ED. Kemna and Acedo [23] 

calculated space cooling loads for 28 EU members’ capital cities in order to obtain an estimated gross 

cooling demands at the EU level. Pezzutto et al. [24] evaluated HC demands for residential and 

service sectors systemizing data for two groups of countries. Person and Werner [25] presented an 

overview of current cooling supplies for each EU country. The report includes a comparison of gross 

cooling consumption with other relevant works. Werner [26] estimated annual electricity 

consumption for space cooling divided by the service and residential building sector for each member 

state. This research is based for the first time on actual measurements of cooling loads. Connolly [27] 

conducted an analysis calculating economic values of electricity and contrasting ED in HC sectors 

and electricity for each EU country. The analysis is later focused on the energy overview and peak-

loads in the Czech Republic, Italy, Romania and United Kingdom. 

Jakubcionis and Carlsson [28] carried out two analyses quantifying annual building space 

cooling loads for the residential and service sector by each EU country. The following chart displays 

the share of published results in the total annual electricity demands by each of seven EU countries—

as minimum, average and maximum estimated annual electricity load deployed in the service sector 

space cooling (Figure 3a). The same article evaluated additional annual final electricity consumption 

for cooling of service sector buildings by each EU country. The highest increases are likely to occur

The electricity loads for space cooling at the EU level are constantly intensifying [29]. This refers 

particularly to the southern European region as a result of general comfort cooling requirements, 

which are additionally increased by global warming effects [30]. With regard to these facts, such 

growth in air-conditioning (AC) intensity during summer cooling period (in the northern 

hemisphere) may produce so called peak-loads in electricity network [31], which occur during day-

time when the solar irradiation level is the highest [32]. Energy systems are commonly designed to 

meet such demands but in cases when loads are unexpectedly high, electricity generators run 

relatively inefficient and high-pollutant auxiliary power plants [33]. With respect to these facts, 

appropriate measures and methods for the reduction of buildings’ overall cooling loads should be 

applied with active and passive cooling strategies by increasing the overall potential for ES [34]. 

3. Climate Classification and Weather-Based Indexing 

3.1. Köppen–Geiger Climate Classification 

Analysing the updated Köppen–Geiger climate classification world map [35], four climate types 

are most represented along the northern Mediterranean coastline: “Csa” (hot-summer Mediterranean 

climate); “Cfa” (humid subtropical climate); “Bsh” (hot semi-arid climate); and “Bsk” (cold semi-arid 

climate) (Figure 4). “Csa” is the typical climate in the Mediterranean region, “Bsh” type covers 

isolated areas along the Iberian coastline and a large part of Cyprus, while parts affected with the 

inland weather conditions are identified as type “Bsk”. Mainly continental and lower mountain range 

areas along the coastline are classified as “Cfa”. Eight geolocations in seven EU countries are chosen 

for this analysis, principally as major regional port-cities: Valencia (Spain), Barcelona (Spain), 

Marseille (France), Rome (Italy), Koper (Slovenia), Split (Croatia), Athens (Greece) and Nicosia 

(Cyprus) (Figure 4, Table 1).

3.2. Cooling Degree Day (CDD) 

Cooling degree day (CDD) is a weather-based technical index designed to describe the need for 

the cooling (air-conditioning) requirements of buildings. The calculation of CDD relies on the base 

temperature, defined as the highest daily mean air temperature not leading to indoor cooling 

(definition: EUROSTAT [36]). 

The following chart displays the comparison of CDD values for the five-year period (2013–2017) 

by each country (Figure 5) [37]. Climate conditions in Cyprus show the highest values, followed by 

CDD rates for Greece, Spain and Italy.

4. Advanced Natural Ventilation (ANV) Principles

Kevin J. Lomas [38] defined a class of ventilative space cooling systems as the ANV principle that
is based on the air movement forced by the stack-pressure (or chimney) effect. Four different ANV
forms are specified with respect to the indoor air-flow direction. This analysis evaluates a specific
type named “centre-in, edge-out” (C–E) where the outdoor fresh air is introduced through a “central”
distribution area, usually through an atrium or a light-well, and afterwards is drawn-out on the
building perimeter, which is considered as an “edge” zone (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Advanced natural ventilation (ANV) principle—schematic diagram of stack ventilation 

form “centre-in, edge-out” (C–E). 

The advantages of ANV systems are that the air-flow is more stable compared to basic single-

side or cross-ventilation methods that rely on the wind force and, furthermore, the uncertainty factor 

for maintaining the TC level is significantly lower [39]. Such a method allows generating NV in deep-

plan spaces and the entire system is better protected from direct negative environmental effects, in 

terms of outdoor noise, air pollution etc. The ANV system is completely controlled by a building 

management system (BMS) in order to keep the designed levels of indoor air-quality, human TC and 

reduced cooling ED. 

5. Natural Ventilative Space Cooling Approach in Southern Europe 

According to numerous relevant studies, NV is an effective passive cooling strategy in 

Mediterranean vernacular architecture. Although day-time natural cooling ventilation has a limited 

potential due to unfavourable periods of elevated outdoor temperatures, night-time natural 

ventilation (NNV) can reduce interior air temperature peaks and improve overall TC by cooling 

down the exposed building high thermal mass structure [40]. NNV is applicable as a common cooling 

strategy in regions with high day-time temperature ranges and where nocturnal temperatures are 

not too low to overcool the indoor thermal mass [41]. Such a ventilative cooling method is especially 

useful for a class of office buildings that are generally vacant in the night so that elevated air-flow 

speeds can be generated for achieving the highest possible cooling effect [42]. 

For the purpose of cooling down the building’s high thermal mass during the night, an indoor 

flow of air can be generated by passive principles or by mechanical means, so that the cooled down 

structure is thermally capable of absorbing the heat gains throughout the next-day occupancy time. 

NNV affects indoor conditions in the following key aspects: reduction of air temperatures during the 

day, reduction of peak air temperatures, reduction of building structure temperature, and 

postponement of the peak cooling loads. [43]. Furthermore, NNV cooling potential depends 

primarily on: weather conditions, indoor air-flow speed, building heat capacity and the designed 

principle for a proper thermal convection between thermal mass and flow of air [44]. Thereby, the 

increased use of high thermal mass in contact with the indoor air flow is recommended which means 

avoiding the use of common office dropped (or suspended) ceiling type, considering its low thermal 

conductivity. [45]. 

In Mediterranean Europe, space comfort cooling is required during both summer and transition 

seasons. As a result of regional global warming effects, night-time passive cooling ventilation could 

become gradually ineffective in summer, but still can remain an efficient strategy throughout

seasons [46]. In view of these effects, the predicted climate change temperature increase will certainly
produce the unfavourable effects on the general NV capacity, particularly in July and August when
certain diurnal NV cooling modes could become inefficient. It should be considered as well that one of
the consequences of world climate change is the shift in the timing of seasons, so that the present-day
common building cooling period could begin earlier in springtime and end later in fall (in the northern
hemisphere) [13]. If during short periods of time lower TC levels are not acceptable, then running
additional mechanical cooling systems is required. In this sense, the NNV space cooling approach
can still be effective but as a part of hybrid ventilation system [47] that serves to cut the ED of the full
mechanical cooling system [48].

Nevertheless, the computer-based BMS is considered for maintaining the calculated TC level
and also for controlling the ventilation system’s operation during the building’s unoccupied
period [49], ensuring that the facade opening will be performed as scheduled and according to
climate conditions [13,50].

In office-type buildings that are located in warm climates, a passive cooling NNV approach
combined with a mechanical cooling system is often applied, so that cooling ES are therefore relevant
to consider [51]. Today, the main obstacles for implementing passive NV techniques come from
legislation and norms, as only hybrid and MV systems are accepted. Still, NV-based cooling principles
are feasible EE tools for the reduction of buildings’ cooling ED and CO2 emissions in the Mediterranean
region [52].

6. Methodology

The first part of this analysis applies the climate potential for natural ventilation (CPNV)
methodology developed by Francesco Causone (2016) [53]. Respecting local climate conditions and
without taking into account the wind force, the objective of this approach is to present an assessment
of the theoretical availability of NV, which can be used for both building space ventilation and cooling.

The second methodology is based on the BPS of a hypothetical office-building model and displays
a comparison overview of possible annual cooling ES. For this purpose, four cooling modes are defined
that are operating from April to October, which is the defined cooling period for this research.

6.1. Climate Potential for Natural Ventilation (CPNV)

The CPNV [53] is an evaluation tool that analyses weather data for a specific geolocation.
The CPNV coefficient is determined by the total annual number of hours when NV can be theoretically
performed (hNV,i), divided by the total annual number of 8760 h (htot) (1).

CPNV =
∑ni=1 hNV,i

htot
(1)

Based on hourly weather data, two parameters are determined: the ambient temperature (tout)
and the ambient humidity ratio (Wout). In order that the occupants find the building indoor space
acceptable from the aspect of hygrothermal comfort, the boundary values’ conditions are defined as
follows—it is required that the ambient temperature value is in the range between the lower and upper
acceptable indoor temperature (tin,l ; tin,u) (2) and that the humidity ratio value is in the range between
the lower and upper acceptable indoor humidity ratio rates (Win, l ; Win,u) (3) (Figure 7).

tin,l ≤ tout ≤ tin,u (2)

Win,l ≤ Wout ≤ Win,u (3)

Figure 7. The boundary conditions: time of year subdivided in nine areas according to temperature 

and humidity ratio thresholds (source: “Climate Potential for Natural Ventilation (CPNV)”, Francesco 

Causone, 2016; adapted image, with author’s permission). 

This analysis uses the “adaptive model” of TC for 80% acceptability range, according to the 

ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) Standard 55-

2017 [54]. Respecting this, the building lower and upper acceptable interior space temperature limits 

(𝑡𝑙 ; 𝑡𝑢) are calculated according to the following Equations (4) and (5): 

𝑡𝑙 = 𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑓 − 3.5 °C (4) 

𝑡𝑢 = 𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑓 + 3.5 °C (5) 

𝑡𝑙 and 𝑡𝑢 are defined with the comfort ambient temperature  (𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑓), which is determined with 

the following Equation (6), where the prevailing mean outdoor air temperature ( 𝑡𝑝𝑚𝑎(𝑜𝑢𝑡) ) is 

calculated as an arithmetic mean of seven sequential days prior to the day in question (according to 

ASHRAE 55-2017 standard). 

𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑓 = 17.8 + 0.31 𝑥 𝑡𝑝𝑚𝑎(𝑜𝑢𝑡) (6) 

Air supply temperatures are set as follows: 𝑡𝑖𝑛,𝑙  limit is set at 12 °C (7), while 𝑡𝑖𝑛,𝑢  limit is 

equivalent to 𝑡𝑢, but less than 33.5 °C, which is the highest acceptable air supply temperature (8). 

𝑡𝑖𝑛,𝑙 = 12 °C (7) 

𝑡𝑖𝑛,𝑢 =  𝑡𝑢  ;   𝑡𝑖𝑛,𝑢  < 33.5 °C (8) 

According to the CPNV methodology and other relevant sources, the commonly acceptable 

interior air relative humidity (RH) level is generally within 30% and 70%. However, CEN (Comité 

Européen de Normalisation) Standard EN15251 stated that the RH level has a minor effect on the 

human TC in “sedentary occupancy” building space type [55]. A further work about adaptive TC 

proposed that if higher RH levels are acceptable for NV space, in that case the interior materials and 

fittings should be moisture-resistant [56]. Furthermore, another research that analyses NV systems in 

hot and humid climates stated that the indoor upper RH limit is not required [57]. 

For this particular analysis, and considering that among eight selected cities the highest average 

RH is in Rome (75%) (Table 1), the upper RH limit (𝑅𝐻𝑢) is set to 80% and the lower RH limit (𝑅𝐻𝑙) 

is maintained at 30%. 

The lower and upper humidity ratio limits ( 𝑊𝑖𝑛,𝑙  ;  𝑊𝑖𝑛,𝑢 ) for the outdoor air supply are 

determined with the following Equations (9) and (10). The saturated vapor pressure  (𝑝𝑤𝑠)  is a 

function of 𝑡𝑙: 

Win,l  =  0.621945 𝑥 
𝑝𝑤𝑠 𝑥 0.3

𝑝−(𝑝𝑤𝑠 𝑥 0.3)
 ; 𝑝𝑤𝑠 =  𝑓(𝑡𝑙) (9) 

Win,l  =  0.621945 𝑥 
𝑝𝑤𝑠 𝑥 0.8

𝑝−(𝑝𝑤𝑠 𝑥 0.8)
 ; 𝑝𝑤𝑠 = 𝑓(𝑡𝑙) (10) 

The following equation is considered for calculating 𝑝𝑤𝑠 value (11): 

𝑝𝑤𝑠  = 610.7 𝑥 10
7.5 × 𝑡𝑙/(237.3+𝑡𝑙)  (11)

limits (tl ; tu) are calculated according to the following Equations (4) and (5):

tl = tcom f − 3.5 ◦C (4)

tu = tcom f + 3.5
◦C (5)

tl and tu are defined with the comfort ambient temperature (tcom f ), which is determined with the
following Equation (6), where the prevailing mean outdoor air temperature (tpma(out)) is calculated
as an arithmetic mean of seven sequential days prior to the day in question (according to ASHRAE
55-2017 standard).

tcom f = 17.8 + 0.31 × tpma(out) (6)

Air supply temperatures are set as follows: tin,l limit is set at 12
◦C (7), while tin,u limit is equivalent

to tu, but less than 33.5 ◦C, which is the highest acceptable air supply temperature (8).

maintained at 30%.

The lower and upper humidity ratio limits (Win,l ; Win,u) for the outdoor air supply are determined
with the following Equations (9) and (10). The saturated vapor pressure (pws) is a function of tl :

Win,l = 0.621945 ×
pws × 0.3

p − (pws × 0.3)
; pws = f (tl) (9)

Win,l = 0.621945 ×
pws × 0.8

p − (pws × 0.8)
; pws = f (tl) (10)



Sustainability 2018, 10, 3029 9 of 21

The following equation is considered for calculating pws value (11):

pws = 610.7 × 107.5×tl/(237.3+tl) (11)

The 24 h day is split in two periods: the assumed work-time schedule 8:00–17:00 and the rest of
the day 17:00–8:00, which is considered as the NNV operation period.

6.2. Building Performance Simulation (BPS)

The BPS is carried out with DesignBuilder software [58] with the objective of simulating possible
cooling ES using the ANV method in eight different reference geolocations. TC parameters are set up
according to the “adaptive model” for 80% acceptability range (ASHRAE Standard-55) that allows
achieving the maximum estimated level of building ES.

The BPS model represents a four-story open plan office-building with footprint dimensions
24.0 m × 24.0 m and the story height h = 4.0 m (Figure 8a). The central atrium has a full four-story
height with base dimensions 5.2 m × 5.2 m. Gross floor area is 576 m2 and the total calculated office
area covered with the ANV system is 2089 m2. The window area is 30%, the façade is designed
as a “sealed” type and has installed an external “louvre” sun-protection system. The air leakage
(or air-infiltration) is set as a constant annual value at 0.3 ac/h. Total heat gains are 50 W/m2 and
calculated number of occupants is 232 (Table 2).

The interior air-flow is generated by the buoyancy effect through continuously connected 

building space (Figure 8b). The supply-air is introduced into the under-floor plenum and afterward 

is driven into the base level of the central atrium. Thereby, by the effect of atrium’s height stuck-

pressure, the fresh air is distributed further through openings located just above the floor level of 

each of four stories. On the opposite side of the office space, on the façade plane, openings underneath 

the ceiling level drain warmed exhaust air through eight exterior exhausting air-shafts positioned on 

the building perimeter. The shafts serve the first three floors and although the top floor receives the 

fresh air from the central atrium, its ambient air is separately driven out through four roof top shafts. 

It is considered that all building ventilation openings, exterior and interior, are fully controlled by 

the BMS, that is to say, without any control by the occupants.

that all building ventilation openings, exterior and interior, are fully controlled by the BMS, that is to
say, without any control by the occupants.

The local wind effects are not taken into consideration for this analysis. The reference AC system
for the ES calculation is the variable air volume (VAV) type. The cooling system seasonal coefficient of
performance (CoP) is set at 3.5 and the economizer function is switched off. The space heating operative
temperature is set at 21 ◦C while the cooling temperature is 24 ◦C. The indoor humidification and
dehumidification measures are not applied. The building model envelope is designed in accordance
with “Passivhaus” recommendations for the “warm climate” zone with the following thermal heat
transfer coefficient (U): exterior opaque envelope: U = 0.50 W/(m2K); vertical exterior glazing:
U = 1.25 W/(m2K); roof glazing: U = 1.40 W/(m2K) and interior partitions: U = 0.75 W/(m2K). The flat
roof is set U = 0.22 W/(m2K). The occupancy schedule is 8:00–17:00 (continuous occupancy with no
lunch breaks) and the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) operation is 7:00–17:00 (Table 3).
The ventilative cooling is set to be operational equally for all eight geolocations from April 1 to
October 31, from Monday to Friday including also that the NNV mode operates every Sunday night
21:00–0:00 as the cooling process for the next-day.

As in most common BPS, the office area is modelled as an empty open space. However, for a
more detailed simulation, spatial organization with office furniture disposition should be considered
as it affects significantly the overall efficiency of the NV cooling process [59].

6.2.2. Ventilation Modes

Four cooling modes are programmed during the 24 h period (Table 3):

1. Full air-conditioning (FullAC) mode: set as the reference model for cooling ES calculations.
The model is designed as a “sealed” office building that is completely covered with the HVAC
system (without NV function). Operation is set from 7:00–17:00.

2. Day-time natural ventilation (DNV) mode: a hybrid system defined as the “concurrent mode”.
AC and NV are operating parallel in the “same time and in the same space”. The NV operation is
switched off when the external weather conditions are unfavourable and vice versa. The hybrid
system operation is set from 7:00–17:00, while the basic NV operating time is set from 6:00–7:00.

3. Night-time natural ventilation (NNV) mode: the “night-purge” operation is a passive natural
ventilative technique and is set from 21:00–7:00 (including the Sunday period from 21:00–0:00).

4. Day-time and night-time natural ventilation (DNNV) mode: combining two previous modes
(DNV and NNV), it covers the day-time occupancy schedule and the night-time, set as a 20 h
continuous ventilation process from 21:00–17:00 (next day), including Sunday night operation
from 21:00–0:00.

The interior ceilings are defined as “light‐weight” and “heavy‐weight” types (Table 4, Figure 9). 

The “light‐weight” model is the commonly used office‐building suspended ceiling with low thermal 

conductivity designed  for diurnal operations of FullAC and DNV modes. The “heavy‐weight” or 

dense concrete ceiling is designed for generating thermal convection between exposed high thermal 

mass and the interior flow of air during the NNV and DNNV operations. Both ceiling types are with 

U = 0.75 W/(m²K).

6.2.3. Ceiling Types

The interior ceilings are defined as “light-weight” and “heavy-weight” types (Table 4, Figure 9).
The “light-weight” model is the commonly used office-building suspended ceiling with low thermal
conductivity designed for diurnal operations of FullAC and DNV modes. The “heavy-weight” or
dense concrete ceiling is designed for generating thermal convection between exposed high thermal
mass and the interior flow of air during the NNV and DNNV operations. Both ceiling types are with
U = 0.75 W/(m2K).

7. Results 

7.1. CPNV 

Regarding the generated results, the heat maps can be classified in three groups. The first group 

is characterized in the annual periods with higher RH levels throughout a 24 h day: in Valencia it is 

from July to October and in Barcelona from June to October (Figures 10–11 ). The results for Marseille, 

Rome and Koper can be considered as the second group where day-time during spring and summer 

is marked with favourable weather conditions for generating NV but with short intervals of elevated 

RH and/or elevated outdoor air temperatures (Figures 12–14). The annual CPNV is reduced due to 

lower temperatures during winter, compared to other geolocations with milder climate conditions 

throughout the year. The third group is categorized by the cities of Split, Athens and Nicosia, where 

day-time weather conditions are unfavourable from June to September or October due to overall 

higher temperatures and in the case of Nicosia including higher RH levels throughout a 24 h day 

(Figures 15-17). For the most locations, this calculated CPNV contrast between day and night periods 

is considerably higher from April to October (Figures 18b-24b), with the exception of generally 

unfavourable weather conditions in Nicosia during July and August (Figure 25b). However, annual 

CPNV is not significantly reduced in the third group (Split, Athens and Nicosia) as the day-time NV 

principle is generally more available throughout spring, autumn and winter as a consequence of 

milder weather conditions. With the exception of Barcelona’s geolocation, all CPNV values are higher 

during night-time compared to the day-time rates, which is considered as a typical NV feature of the 

Mediterranean climate system (Figure 26). 

CPNV output displays the annual theoretical availability of NV approach for each selected 

geolocation. In this case, the NV function is considered for both cooling and ventilation effects in the 

building space and the wind force is excluded in this analysis. The outcome shows that the favourable 

period for NV application is primarily from April to October, while the period from November to 

March is mainly considered for periodical space ventilation, whose availability depends on specific 

weather conditions for each geolocation. As previously mentioned, the exception is Nicosia, where 

NV can be generated throughout the year in the day-time, but with a very restrictive weather 

conditions from mid-June to mid-September (Figure 17).

7.2. Cooling Energy Savings 

The BPS results demonstrate the differences between weather conditions in eight geolocations which 

are reflected in the general ANV cooling potential (Figures 27, 28). Respecting the determined cooling 

modes, DNV shows the lowest cooling capacity due to overall higher daily outdoor temperatures from 

June to August, where in the case of Split, Athens and Nicosia even higher AC loads are calculated in July 

and August, between +2% and +5% (Figure 27). Consequently, the overall DNV annual cooling capacity 

has the lowest EE level, within 6% and 30% (Figure 28). The following is NNV mode, as a passive cooling 

technique that can considerably reduce the building’s next-day cooling demands, between 21% and 45% 

at the annual level. Ultimately, the highest level of cooling ES, in the range within 22% and 52%, can be 

achieved combining the previous two cooling modes, that is to say with the DNNV operation.  

With the focus on DNNV as the most effective cooling mode, and comparing the outputs for each 

city location, the ES levels can be classified in three groups (Figure 28). The highest potential of ES, 

between 48% and 52%, are calculated in the locations of Barcelona, Marseille, Rome and Koper. The 

second level is in Valencia, 41%. The third group of cities, Split, Athens and Nicosia, show the lowest EE, 

in the range of 22% and 28%.

The applied ventilative techniques demonstrate also the potential of reduction of building CO2
emission, which is presented as a comparison overview by each cooling mode (Figure 29).

This region is characterised with mild winter weather conditions when ANV could extend its
function, namely from October to March, but that kind of ventilative systems would require a certain
pre-heat process during outdoor air intake. Such a ventilative model can be analysed in future research
regardless of the cooling ES. Additionally, to maintain or increase ANV cooling potential, the use
of low-energy fans is recommended during the periods of absence of sufficient stack-pressure force,
which can improve overall ventilation efficiency [60].

of annual NV availability for both space cooling and ventilation, taking into account particular 

weather conditions for each reference geolocation. As a preliminary design tool, the methodology is 

focused on the theoretical use of NV and the main hydrothermal comfort parameters are in this case 

relatively adapted to the Mediterranean climate. 

In the second section of this research, the BPS results display that the ANV C–E form is capable 

in reducing the building cooling electricity consumption from April to October, with a different 

capacity, which is related to the particular weather conditions (Figure 27). Regarding the EE overview 

of analysed geolocations, the presented data outcome displays certain systems’ advantages and 

weaknesses. The cooling capacity of DNV has a higher efficiency during transition seasons and 

combined with the NNV passive cooling technique (as the DNNV mode) such a system can operate 

throughout the entire annual cooling period. On the other side, the disadvantageous weather 

conditions for the DNV function are mainly during July and August, when is the lowest ES potential 

that in cases of Split, Athens and Nicosia is even negligible as a result of elevated summer outdoor 

temperatures. 

The overall output demonstrates the potential of building cooling ES using particular ANV 

modes based on hybrid or passive cooling approaches or a combination of both these principles. The 

evaluated ANV C–E form could take a part in the overall building ES together with other relevant EE 

techniques. The ANV C–E is a suitable cooling EE technique for the southern European coastal region 

and can be summarized in the following primary assessments: 

 Quality: natural ventilative principle; improved indoor environment conditions; 

 Efficiency: annual cooling ES in the range of min 6% and max 51% (Figure 28); 

 Impact: contribution in the ET process of southern European region as a RES.  

Future analyses of NV principles for this region should apply the available scenarios of climate 

change in order to estimate EE under different weather conditions in comparison with present-day 

weather data. Taking into account the generated output and the Mediterranean climate conditions, 

consideration should also be given to a definition of a particular building type system with its spatial

In the second section of this research, the BPS results display that the ANV C–E form is

weather data. Taking into account the generated output and the Mediterranean climate conditions,
consideration should also be given to a definition of a particular building type system with its
spatial organization that is designed to generate NV principles efficiently based on buoyancy and/or
wind-driven force for the maximum possible ES.

The summary of this research is useful for an early design stage as a preliminary valorisation
of ANV use. The aim of the analysis that has been presented is to promote the application of ANV
systems from currently isolated projects to a large-scale scenarios for the purpose of obtaining a more
effective ES factor in the current ET process at both local member states’ and the EU level.
