Abstract

District heating networks are commonly addressed in the literature as one of the most effective solutions for decreasing the 
greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. These systems require high investments which are returned through the heat
sales. Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease, 
prolonging the investment return period. 
The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand – outdoor temperature function for heat demand 
forecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665 
buildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district 
renovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were 
compared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors.
The results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications
(the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation 
scenarios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered). 
The value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the 
decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and 
renovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the 
coupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and 
improve the accuracy of heat demand estimations.

Abstract 

This work explores the double effect of urban compactness on building energy performance in a Mediterranean 
climate, namely the increase of urban heat island (UHI) intensity and the decrease of solar radiation availability on 
building façades. The energy demand of a test apartment has been calculated under varying conditions of UHI intensity 
and solar radiation for different urban textures. Results show robust relationships between the energy demand and the 
‘site coverage ratio’ of the buildings. This demonstrates that compact urban textures are more energy efficient than 
less dense urban patterns in a Mediterranean climate.

of the built environment has thus boosted research into the modelling of building energy consumption at the urban 
scale [1,2], considering the energy phenomena that affect the  energy performance of buildings in urban environments. 
This is aimed at developing urban analysis tools able to inform decision makers on the most effective policies and 
design strategies to improve the performance of the built environment at urban scale, instead of focusing on retrofitting 
the single building. 

This paper contributes to this wider aim through the assessment of the impact of urban compactness on the energy 
performance of buildings in a Mediterranean climate. Urban compactness modifies building energy demand in two 
ways; on the one hand, it may contribute to the increase of the UHI effect [3,4], which entails an indirect impact on 
the energy demand. On the other hand, it modifies the solar radiation availability on the building façade, which is a 
key variable of energy demand in a Mediterranean context [5]. 

Several studies have investigated the relationship between compactness and solar access in urban textures [6–11] 
highlighting the possibility of enhancing solar collection on the building’s envelope through the optimization of urban 
form. Many other studies have analysed the relationship between urban compactness and heat island intensity, using 
both experimental data and modelling tools [4,12–15]. According to these results, it is generally agreed that an increase 
of urban compactness entails a decrease of solar energy availability within the urban texture and an increase of heat 
island intensity in the urban area, especially at night.  

Notwithstanding the extensive knowledge developed on this topic, a quantitative analysis of the global impact of 
urban compactness on building energy performance is still lacking. Urban compactness may have contrasting 
outcomes as regards the energy performance of buildings, especially in a Mediterranean climate, where cooling and 
heating demand are equally significant. The increase of urban compactness enhances the UHI intensity, which is 
positive for the heating and negative for the cooling; conversely, the decrease of solar radiation due to the increase of 
urban compactness has a positive impact on the cooling demand but is detrimental to the heating demand [5].  

It is generally accepted that the UHI effect causes an overall increase of the energy demand in both hot and 
temperate climates [15–19], however the combined effect of increased UHI intensity and decreased solar gains has 
not yet been investigated. This paper aims at filling this gap, presenting an analysis of the global impact of urban 
compactness on the annual energy demand of residential buildings in a Mediterranean urban context. 

2. Materials and method 

The analysis is based on calculations of the energy demand for heating and cooling of a test apartment in different 
urban contexts, considering both the solar obstructions and the heat island intensity determined by the compactness 
of the urban structure. 

A sample of urban textures was identified in Rome (Italy) and Barcelona (Spain) to represent the range of urban 
compactness in Mediterranean urban areas. The reference textures are: Borrel y Soler, Gracia and Raval in Barcelona 
and Centocelle and Don Bosco in Rome (Figure 1). 

The compactness of the textures was measured using the ‘Site Coverage Ratio’ (ρbld), given by the ratio of the 
ground surface occupied by buildings to the total site area. 

A normalised model was built for each urban texture; the normalised models are theoretical homogenous textures 
composed of simplified urban blocks repeated in a regular urban structure [20], with the same values of 'site coverage 
ratio' of the real urban textures. The simplified textures were modelled in Design Builder in order to perform energy 
simulation of the test apartment with EnergyPlus (v 8.1) as follows: 

1) without urban context and using the standard weather file of Rome-Ciampino 
2) within the different urban textures and using a specific weather file for each texture 

The first simulation is representative of an apartment in a rural environment; the second takes into account the solar 
radiation obstruction and the UHI intensity determined by the urban context. To carry out the latter set of simulations, 
an urban weather file was created for each urban texture using the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) model [21,22]. 
The calculation of UWG model is based on a rural weather file (Rome-Ciampino in this case) and a parametric 
description of the urban area, which considers the morphological features of the fabric. Therefore, different urban 
weather files have been created using constant average values for all the urban parameters except the morphological 
ones, which were changed according to the different urban textures [5].

2. Materials and method 

The analysis is based on calculations of the energy demand for heating and cooling of a test apartment in different 
urban contexts, considering both the solar obstructions and the heat island intensity determined by the compactness 
of the urban structure. 

A sample of urban textures was identified in Rome (Italy) and Barcelona (Spain) to represent the range of urban 
compactness in Mediterranean urban areas. The reference textures are: Borrel y Soler, Gracia and Raval in Barcelona 
and Centocelle and Don Bosco in Rome (Figure 1). 

The compactness of the textures was measured using the ‘Site Coverage Ratio’ (ρbld), given by the ratio of the 
ground surface occupied by buildings to the total site area. 

A normalised model was built for each urban texture; the normalised models are theoretical homogenous textures 
composed of simplified urban blocks repeated in a regular urban structure [20], with the same values of 'site coverage 
ratio' of the real urban textures. The simplified textures were modelled in Design Builder in order to perform energy 
simulation of the test apartment with EnergyPlus (v 8.1) as follows: 

1) without urban context and using the standard weather file of Rome-Ciampino 
2) within the different urban textures and using a specific weather file for each texture 

The first simulation is representative of an apartment in a rural environment; the second takes into account the solar 
radiation obstruction and the UHI intensity determined by the urban context. To carry out the latter set of simulations, 
an urban weather file was created for each urban texture using the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) model [21,22]. 
The calculation of UWG model is based on a rural weather file (Rome-Ciampino in this case) and a parametric 
description of the urban area, which considers the morphological features of the fabric. Therefore, different urban 
weather files have been created using constant average values for all the urban parameters except the morphological 
ones, which were changed according to the different urban textures [5].

In either kind of simulation, the energy demand was calculated considering the test apartment at the first floor 
(+4.00m from ground level) in 4 orientations: NW-NE, NE-SE, SE-SW and SW-NW. Results have been analysed in 
relation to the texture’s site coverage ratio, in order to investigate the existence of significant relationships between 
the energy demands and the compactness of the urban structure. The comparative analysis of results is based on the 
average demands among the four orientations, so as to be representative of an average oriented apartment in an urban 
area. The values for the main parameters of the energy model are reported in Table 1.

3. Results and discussion 

In Table 2 the average solar obstruction and the UHI intensities for the five urban textures are reported.  The 
percentage of solar obstruction was obtained as the ratio of the apartment’s solar gains without urban context to the 
ones within the urban textures (with the apartment at 4.0 m from ground level). The average values of UHI intensity 
in summer, winter and during the entire year have been calculated using data from the weather files generated with 
UWG.

Results confirm that an increase of urban compactness determines a proportional decrease of solar radiation on the 
building façades. The direct proportion between site coverage ratio and solar obstruction is clear for Borrel Y Soler, 
Centocelle and Raval. The cases of Don Bosco and Gracia show different ratios, due to the height of the buildings in 
the two textures: in Don Bosco buildings are very tall, so the solar obstruction is enhanced, while in Gracia the 
buildings are low and the obstruction of solar radiation is reduced despite the high compactness of the texture. With 
regard to the UHI intensity, a proportion with the site coverage ratio is also recognisable; the UHI intensity is higher 
in the most compact textures. However, there are some exceptions, in particular on the summer UHI intensity, that 
may be explained in the light of other morphological features of the textures, such as 'vertical surface density'.  This 
parameter measures the density of façades in urban area, which varies a lot for different typology and height of the 
buildings and highly affects UHI intensity during summer, as commented in other works [4].  

3.1. Urban compactness and building's energy demands 

The trend lines in Figure 2 represent the variability of the average heating and cooling demands of the apartment 
as a function of the urban compactness. The red line identifies the energy demand of the same apartment located in 
the rural environment, without UHI effect or solar obstructions. The variation of the demand due to the increase of 
the site coverage ratio is thus the result of decreasing solar radiation and increasing UHI intensity and identifies the 
overall impact of the urban compactness on the energy demand.

Urban compactness and cooling demand are linearly correlated, with a robust R2 =0.95. The increase of urban 
compactness entails a proportional decrease of the cooling demand for the test apartment. Therefore, according to 
these findings, a high degree of compactness is beneficial during summer in a Mediterranean climate, due to the 
importance of the reduced solar radiation being greater than the increased heat island. However, the cooling demand

3.1. Urban compactness and building's energy demands 

The trend lines in Figure 2 represent the variability of the average heating and cooling demands of the apartment 
as a function of the urban compactness. The red line identifies the energy demand of the same apartment located in 
the rural environment, without UHI effect or solar obstructions. The variation of the demand due to the increase of 
the site coverage ratio is thus the result of decreasing solar radiation and increasing UHI intensity and identifies the 
overall impact of the urban compactness on the energy demand. 
 

 
Fig. 2. Relationships between the texture’s site coverage ratio and the apartment’s heating demand and cooling demand for five case studies. 

Urban compactness and cooling demand are linearly correlated, with a robust R2 =0.95. The increase of urban 
compactness entails a proportional decrease of the cooling demand for the test apartment. Therefore, according to 
these findings, a high degree of compactness is beneficial during summer in a Mediterranean climate, due to the 
importance of the reduced solar radiation being greater than the increased heat island. However, the cooling demand 

 Agnese Salvati et al. / Energy Procedia 00 (2017) 000–000   5 

for the apartment in the urban context is necessarily higher than the corresponding one in a rural environment, because 
of the impact of the UHI intensity.  

As regards the heating demand, a nonlinear relationship has been found with respect to the texture’s compactness 
(R2= 0.95). The heating demand is generally lower in the urban textures than in the rural environment, due to the 
beneficial effect of the UHI intensity, even in the texture with the lowest value of site coverage ratio. An increase of 
the texture’s compactness entails, at the beginning, a similar increase of the heating demand, because of the 
progressive decrease of solar radiation. However, there is a threshold value of the texture’s coverage ratio (ρbld=0.4) 
beyond which the heating demand resumes decreasing. This happens because the energy saving deriving from a strong 
UHI intensity becomes more important than the reduction of solar gains during winter time.  
 

 
Fig. 3. Relationship between the texture’s site coverage ratio and the apartment’s annual energy demand for five case studies 

 
Figure 3 shows the trend of the annual energy demand in relation to the texture’s site coverage ratio; the annual 

demand is the sum of the heating and cooling demands.  
These results indicate that the urban context is detrimental to the energy performance of the buildings if the urban 

structure is scattered. For low values of site coverage ratio, the apartment's energy demand is higher than in a rural 
environment. However, the increase of urban compactness determines a decrease of the annual energy demand in the 
urban context. Furthermore, the contrasting impacts of urban compactness on energy demand compensate themselves 
in very compact urban textures (ρbld around 0.63), determining the same energy demand of a rural environment. In the 
most compact urban texture among the case studies (Raval, ρbld=0.8), the annual energy demand is even lower than a 
rural environment. Therefore, these findings demonstrate that compact urban textures (ρbld higher than 0.5) are more 
energy efficient in a Mediterranean climate compared to scattered and discontinuous urban patterns, because 
compactness allows UHI intensity to be taken advantage of during winter time, while reducing the cooling demand 
thanks to a huge reduction of solar radiation on the building façades.  

The validity of the results is affected by the limitation of the energy model, the assumptions on the test apartment 
and the simplified modelling of the urban textures; further research would be required to provide empirical validation 
of these findings. 

4. Conclusion 

This work explores the contrasting effects of urban compactness on building energy demand in a Mediterranean 
climate. The energy demand of a test apartment has been calculated considering concurrently the UHI intensity and 
the solar obstruction determined by different urban textures. 

The results confirm that compact urban textures, with a site coverage ratio above 0.5, contribute to reduce energy 
consumption in a Mediterranean climate, by decreasing annual energy demand as opposed to the performance of an 
isolated building; this holds true despite the UHI intensity determined by compact urban structures, because the 
increase of air temperature is counterbalanced by a decrease of solar radiation during summer time. Therefore, this 
analysis suggests that the most compact and dense urban textures, such as the historic fabric of many city centres, are 
more energy efficient than sparser and less dense urban patterns, typical of more recent urban developments.

The relationships identified in this study allow for a preliminary assessment of the energy performance of urban 
textures, based on a common density parameter such as the ‘site coverage ratio’. The opportunity of performing rapid 
assessments at the district scale and providing maps of the energy vulnerability within the city would certainly ease 
the work of designers, planners and decision makers in identifying a priority of interventions on the built environment. 

Future lines of investigation would concern the identification of the most appropriate and effective interventions at 
the building scale, according to the solar access and the climatic performance expressed by each urban texture. In this 
way, the analysis of the energy performance at the urban scale could translate into operational tools for design at the 
building scale, fostering the work of architects and urban planners in the field of urban renewal and energy efficiency.
