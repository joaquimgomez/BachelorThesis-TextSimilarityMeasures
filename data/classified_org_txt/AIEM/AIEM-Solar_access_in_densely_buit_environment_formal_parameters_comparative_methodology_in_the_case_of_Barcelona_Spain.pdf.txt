Solar access in densely built urban environments
Formal parameters and comparative methodology in the case 

Alessandra CURRELI Helena COCH ROURA

ABSTRACT: : In what direction is the historical debate on contemporary cities evolving, in this age of 
sustainability? How are renewable energies and solar energy in particular being incorporated into urban 
settlements? To date, researches mainly focused on urban density, while less attention has been paid to the 
spatial properties of the built environment. In this study, we compare the performance of urban fabrics of similar 
building intensity in Barcelona (Spain) to investigate the extent to which morphological features of the built 
environment can affect sun collection on the buildings envelope, in order to define new formal guidelines for a 
“solar” design of urban planning. The available technical tools for solar radiation analysis are not really suited to 
an urban scale or to the early stages of the planning process. Therefore, we apply a simplified comparative 
methodology supported by  Heliodón 2 simulation software, we intend to provide a new methodological and 
operational tool which allows fast interaction between solar radiation and the urban design process. The present 
paper is an early step in an on-going PhD thesis. In the first section we describe the general approach, the 
objectives and the method. In the second section, we present the application of this method to the Eixample 
district and the results. In this preliminary study, we focus on one of the spatial characteristics of the urban fabric 
in particular - the orientation of the street network.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The rapid and uncontrolled sprawl of 

contemporary cities has environmental and social 
costs that have become unsustainable and it is now 
widely recognized that large-scale approach to this 
problem and a new urban model are required [1]. 

The following two factors have a bearing on this

program which is a model of development that 
promotes the systematic integration of renewable 
energy technology into urban communities [2].

the waste of energy in of megalopolises and 

specific exploration of solar effects in relation to 
urban and architectural design [3].  

J. Winter described solar 
city as “an energetically self-contained settlement 
with solar irradiance as its main energy source” and 
considered what this big “energy converter” would 
look like and how it would have to be designed [4]. In 

spatial organization of the urban fabric would be like 

in a solar city and which formal solutions would most

The relation between site layout and solar access

more intense. Studies of the morphological structure 
of urban fabric and its solar radiation performance 
could provide important new input for the design 
process from a solar perspective. 

Solar issues should be fundamental requisites for 
architects and urban designers from the first steps in 

operational instruments are needed. Although 
considerable computational and technological 

studies on solar performance at urban scale show 
that further research is required in this area.  

The current study aims to provide new formal 
materials as well as specific tools for developing a 
new conception of solar urban design.

the urban fabric are an interesting topic to study as  
an additional tool in the design process [7].

building density may have a highly variable spatial

Research into the links between quantitative and 
qualitative properties of the urban fabric explores 
additional possibilities of action in relation to 
challenges from the new sustainable urban vision. 

2.2. Digital tools for solar analysis at urban scale 

Solar radiation analysis at city level is a research 
area that can be considered pretty recent. 

The main problems are related to the high 
number of variables that interact at urban scale and

environment and to reproduce sky vault and 
cloudiness models [9] [10].

digital graphics and aims to create a completely 
realistic representation of lighting effects on the

design has not yet been fully defined and different 
options still need to be compared and evaluated.

instruments that allow fast interactive handling of 
solar radiation and urban design decisions [12]. 

3. OBJECTIVES 
3.1. Urban morphology and obstructions 

The first general goal of this study consists in 
evaluating how and how much the geometry of the 
urban fabric affects the potential use of solar 
radiation to establish the “operating margins” and the 
contribution of the architects who work on  
sustainable designs. 

parameters that influence solar access in the city and 
to study their behaviour and mutual relations. This 
operation leads to the definition of a general 

“database” of formal tools that can easily be used 
and adapted to different environmental situations.  

deduced from the analysis of existing cases will be 
used to draw up morphological and typological 
guidelines and specific design solutions for new solar 
urban interventions in Barcelona or in other 
geographic locations with similar climates. 

3.2. Definition of new methodological references 
for the urban project 

The second objective of this research is closely 
related and complementary to the previous one. In 

introduce a new operational 
and methodological protocol for the design of solar 
settlements.

reliability of a comparative analysis will be improved 
trough a solar radiation study performed at urban

aim to check whether these operational features 
affect the rigour and usefulness of the final results. 

The last goal is draw up a general method that 
can guide and support formal decisions during the 
early phases of the solar design process and that 
can be used repeatedly in generic urban cases. 

4. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 
This research is based on a comparison of 

whose solar performance is studied using Heliodón 

decision tool for designing with daylight availability 
[13]. The method is divided into 3 main steps. To 

ed the first of these steps. 

4.1. Selection of cases to study

same or similar building intensity. This characteristic

to the gross land area [14].

4.2. Solar radiation simulation process 

Heliodón 2 is a program that simulates the sun's 
paths at a specific geographic site and provides 
graphical and numerical information about the 
evolution and the distribution of solar radiation over 

shadows cast by neighbouring obstructions. 
Compared with other lighting and thermal 

theoretical sky models or requires meteorological 
 determined by a calculation 

algorithm based only on the direct component and 
corresponding to clear sky

absolute information that is closely linked to the 
geometry of the objects. 

The performance of the 4 samples will be 
compared separately in the summer (21 June-20 
September) and in the winter (21 December-20 
March). The potential contribution of solar radiation is 
computed by Heliodón 2 through a long series of 
data on instantaneous solar radiance (kW) at specific 
points of the envelope. The mean values are then 
integrated for the previously established interval to 
obtain the cumulative distribution of solar energy 
collected (kWh) by the whole envelope and the 
amount of sun flux (kWh/m2) on every single element 
of the building. The program also provides 
information about the distribution of daylight hours 
(h) received by every external surface.  

The element of reference will be the central block 
e the rest of the built 

environment simply will act as an obstruction. 
Overall data referring to the whole block are 

complemented by specific data on the solar 
performance of single portions

of solar radiance (kW) and of solar energy collected 
(kWh) describe the qualitative distribution of incident 
radiation and enable us to identify specific aspects. 

A comprehensive picture of the solar 
performance of the different urban plots can then be 
obtained by comparing the overall and local results. 

4.3. Data analysis and methodology review 

An analysis and comparison of data from the 4 
samples will allow us to identify common points and 
tendencies related to the spatial properties of the 

transpose the information from the specific to the 

morphological variables that are classified according 
to their performance and interaction with solar 
access.

and application examples will be provided for 
Barcelona. These guidelines will constitute a 
practical and basic “handbook” to guide architects 
and urban designers in the early decision steps of 
the design project. 

The final methodological review will be used to 
make any adjustments that will be needed to 
optimize the comparative analysis process applied to 
urban design. Sequential steps of the general 
methodology will then be specifically illustrated and 

will complete the “solar tool box” that this study aims 
to provide. 

5. PRELIMINARY CASE STUDY: EIXAMPLE 

to the case of the Eixample's urban fabric. This is a 
preliminary study to check the comparative approach 
at urban scale and to assess the suitability of the 
simulation software. 

The Eixample district occupies a surface area of 
748.5 hectares. It is one of the smallest districts of 

built sector of the city. 
Cerdà’s 1859 Plan for the district involved a 

quadrangular chamfered blocks (called manzanas) 
with sides 113.3 m long defined by a grid of 

the central patio consisting of public green areas. 

dings rose to a height of 
20-24 m and occupied almost the entire manzana. 

The street canyon geometry and pattern 
orientation established by Cerdà (NO-SE and SO-
NE) were devised to control shading by surrounding 
buildings and thus ensure that all dwellings received 
enough daylight and natural 
Cerdà’s city concept recognized the importance of 
sunlight and daylight availability in an urban context 

 tested the performance of 
this urban fabric with respect to solar access.

simply involve a general cumulative analysis. The

terms of overall amounts of energy or sunny hours:

responsible for the solar performance and potential 
exploitation of radiation in the urban fabric.
