Abstract 
The growing demand for energy and the accelerating threats from climate change call for innovative 
and sustainable solutions to decrease dependency on fossil fuels. Biomass-based, small-scale Combined 
Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) systems are one of these solutions, because they can satisfy the 
energy demands of the consumer with enhanced flexibility, lower losses, less costs and less 
environmental pollution as compared to centralized facilities. Due to recent advances in several 
scientific subfields with relevance to small-scale CCHP, a rapidly increasing amount of literature is now 
available. Therefore, a structural overview is essential for engineers and researchers. This paper 
presents a review of the current investigations in small-scale CCHP systems covering biomass-fired 
concepts and solar extensions. To this end, critical system components are described and analysed 
according to their specific advantages and drawbacks. Recent case studies have been collected and key 
findings are highlighted according to each type of prime mover. The results indicate a scientific bias 
towards the economic viability of such systems and the need for real-life and experiment system data. 
However, the potential of biomass-fired CCHP systems and of such systems with solar extensions has 
clearly been recognised. Based on the results, future policy implementations should focus on fostering 
such systems in areas with high energy costs and to increase energy resilience in developed regions. 
Additionally research and industry applying novel prime mover technologies should be financially 
supported.

1 Introduction 

To fuel the world’s rising demand for energy while also to slow down emissions of greenhouse gases, 
more efficient and more sustainable energy systems are necessary [1]. Combined Cooling, Heating and 
Power (CCHP) is a technology that aims to raise the energy efficiency of an energy system by using the 
electric as well as the thermal output for practical applications [2,3]. Most deployed CCHP systems 
involve centralized facilities with extensive heating and cooling networks supplying hundreds or 
thousands of industrial and residential consumers. However, the disadvantages of centralized energy 
systems are losses due to longer transfer distances, the inability to reply to the immediate demands of 
individual consumers and higher security risks should unexpected shutdowns occur [4]. Therefore 
smaller decentralized units, which serve the local demand for heat as well as for electricity, can be a 
more profitable and more efficient alternative to centralized facilities [5].

While small-scale systems providing cooling, heat and/or power driven by fossil fuels haven been 
successfully developed and constructed for decades, the implementation of renewable options is 
relatively new and successful mass-scale commercialization still has to be proven [6,7]. Amongst 
renewable energies, biomass seems to be the most promising energy source for CCHP systems as other 
renewable energies are either not generating enough heat in normal operation modes (wind, 
photovoltaic, hydro), are too locally limited (geothermal) or are too volatile (solar thermal) [8–11]. 
Hence, the development of small-scale, biomass-fired CCHP systems is becoming increasingly 
important for climate politics, economics and research [12–14]. Such systems can be especially cost-
efficient solutions in remote areas and islands with adequate sources of renewable energies [15,16]. 
Extensions involving solar electric energy can greatly augment the sustainability and viability of this 
approach, considering the vast solar potential and falling photovoltaic (PV) prices [17]. 

Historically CCHP is linked to the more well-known Combined Heat and Power (CHP) concept: a 
cooling unit is integrated to the CHP system, leading to more choices for energy outputs and higher 
operating times, especially in comparison to conventional power plants [12,18]. Several synonyms of 
CCHP can be found in literature and the following list defines their meaning for this paper [19]: 

• Trigeneration: essentially equivalent to CCHP [19] 
• Polygeneration/Multigeneration: Any system which produces more than two energy services; 

this can be a CCHP system but may also be a system producing chemicals or other products 
[19,] 

• MCCHP/ μCCHP: Micro CCHP (with less than 20 kW electric power) [20,21]  
• CHP with Cooling or Cogeneration with Cooling: Essentially the same as CCHP [22] 
• BCHP: Building Cooling Heating and Power [23] 
• Biorefinery: Any system, which produces chemical products out of biomass [19] 

Several studies indicate significant potential for biomass-fired CCHP systems, but so far only medium-
scale (1 MW-10 MW) and large scale (>10 MW) systems have been commercialised successfully, while 
micro-scale (<20 kW) and small-scale (20 kW – 1 MW) systems are still in an experimental phase 
[21,24]. To design a CCHP system for optimal environmental and economic performance, component 
type and size have to be evaluated and chosen carefully according to the electricity, heating and cooling 
demand [2,5]. For this, many authors argue that the prime mover is the heart of such systems with the 
biggest impact on system economics and environment [5,21,25]. Another possibility to optimize small-
scale CCHP systems is to use operation strategies adjusted to the electric or the thermal load [20]. 
These loads depend heavily on the energy consumer, which can be a household, an office building, a 
hospital, or any similar buildings [26]. Several studies investigate the optimal behaviour for CCHP 
systems and highlight the benefits of their flexibility for energy generation [19,27,28].  

The previously mentioned studies review certain aspects of CCHP systems, but none of them focus on 
the growing amount of literature on biomass-fired options [14]. Hence, the aim of this paper is to 
summarize and structure the constantly increasing amount of scientific literature on small-scale (< 1 
MWel), biomass-fired CCHP systems. For this, currently used technologies are presented as shown in 
Figure 1 and their specific benefits as well as drawbacks are identified. For each different prime mover 
technology, the key findings of the most recent case studies from 2010 to 2017 are highlighted and their 
key characteristics (maximal output, type of biomass, prime mover type, refrigeration technology, 
model software/experiment location) are assembled.

After this introduction, internal and external factors that affect the technological and economic 
development of CCHP systems will be listed in chapter 2. In chapter 3, the different ways to obtain 
biofuel for small-scale CCHP systems are presented. The studies investigating small-scale biomass-
fired CCHP systems are summarized and listed according to their prime mover in chapter 4. Therefore, 
the focus of the review has been laid on CCHP systems based on these various prime movers. Chapter 5 
presents the most common cooling and storage technologies. The findings are discussed in chapter 6 
and finally conclusions are drawn in chapter 7, where also future policy implementations are suggested. 

2 Internal and external factors driving CCHP development 

To seize the potential of small-scale CCHP systems internal as well as external factors will influence the 
development in the coming years. One external factor for the viability of small-scale CHP and CCHP 
systems are government policies for support and subsidies [19]. It was noted that governments from 
developed and developing countries like the USA, China, the EU, Brazil, Russia and Japan use different 
mechanisms to promote the use of CCHP systems [20,21]. This implies, that the huge potential has 
been acknowledged also politically, but until today the total share of electricity and heat generated 
through CHP and CCHP systems still remains low with for example less than 6% of heat generated by 
CHP or CCHP systems in the EU in 2016 [20,29]. However, other external factors like biomass prices, 
oil prices or carbon dioxide taxes also effect the economics of small-scale CCHP systems greatly [30]. 

There are several parameters to measure the performance of internal factors of energy systems, for 
which a good overview can be found in [31]. One of the most commonly used energetic performance 
parameters is the Primary Energy Saving Ratio (PESR), which describes the ratio of primary energy 
saved in the new system compared to a conventional stand-alone energy generation system [12,31]. 
Many small-scale CHP and CCHP systems achieve a PESR of 20-30%, which indicates favourable 
ecologic and economic performances [9,27,32]. However, especially in the case of biomass-fired and 
biomass-fired solar-assisted CCHP systems, the PESR can be misleading, because even if more energy 
is needed in biomass systems than in conventional systems, they might still perform ecologically better. 
Hence, other methodologies like Life Cycle Assessments or CO2-equivalence should also be taken into 
account [2,31]. 

3 Fuel Supply 

Apart from using simple mechanical preparation, biomass can be transformed into a gaseous, liquid or 
solid fuel through either biochemical conversion or through thermochemical conversion [33]. These 



     

 

 4 (34) 
 

products can either be used for fueling a CCHP system directly or can be stored and then transported to 
the CCHP system.  

3.1 Biochemical Conversion 
The most popular biochemical conversion technology is anaerobic digestion, which describes a chain 
process of biological reactions in a low-oxygen environment transforming organic biomass into biogas 
[10,34]. The main contents of biogas are methane with 55-80% and carbon dioxide with 20-45%, while 
other gases as impurities and the remains of the anaerobic biomass are also produced [33,35]. Biomass 
used for anaerobic digestion is usually waste from agricultural enterprises or manure from animals 
and/or humans. This type of biomass has usually a high moisture content and features high ash 
contents [36]. 

Another technology for the biochemical conversion of biomass is fermentation, which describes the 
conversion of biomass firstly to sugars and finally to alcohols, mainly bio-ethanol. Mostly sugar or 
starch crops are used, however the process can also be applied to lignocellulose biomass, but with less 
efficiency [36]. Fermentation is usually applied in large-scale factories and is one of the most 
commonly used processes for the production of high-quality biofuels [37]. 

3.2 Thermochemical Conversion 
The first process for preparing biomass for thermochemical conversion is drying, because this way, 
even for direct combustion, the efficiency can easily be increased by 5-10% and air emissions can be 
lowered. For micro-scale CCHP systems, the biomass can be dried before insertion into the system by 
using direct solar irradiation or other heat sources. Alternatively, some part of the exhaust heat from 
the CCHP system can be used to dry the biomass rapidly [38]. 

Pyrolysis describes the process of breaking down long hydrocarbon chains into smaller pieces by 
applying heat at temperatures, normally between 450-600 °C with low-oxygen supply [36]. Apart from 
temperature and heat supply time, other factors like chemical composition or surface area of the 
biomass have significant impact on the process and the products [35,39]. Gaseous products of biomass 
pyrolysis are mostly H2, CO, CO2, and CH4, but also higher hydrocarbons like C2H6, C2H4, and C3H8 in 
small amounts. Additionally liquid oils are produced, which consist of even higher hydrocarbon chains, 
and solid charcoal remains, which can be used for combustion or fertilizing [39]. The produced oils can 
be transformed into transportation fuels or they can be further broken down by applying more heat 
[10,35]. 

This process of applying even more heat to biomass, usually at temperatures between 750-1,000 °C 
degrees, is referred to as gasification. At this temperature level, almost all carbohydrates are cracked 
down to H2 and CO and the produced gas is often referred to as synthesis gas (syngas), producer gas, or 
wood gas. This is not a full combustion because the process occurs in a low oxygen environment [35]. 
Fixed bed type gasifiers represent the simplest category of gasifiers, where solid fuel particles are 
placed in a cylinder and gasifying agents (e.g. air, oxygen, steam) pass through the solid particles. After 
leaving the gasification chamber, the syngas usually undergoes a cleaning process by sending it through 
a cyclone for removal of solid particles and through filters. Another category of gasifiers is fluidized bed 
gasifiers [40]. Here the fluidizing agents enter from below into a mixture of biomass and inert bed 
materials like silica or sand, which are working as catalysts for the gasification process. 

3.3  Bioliquids and Biogases  
Based on the previous processes, medium to large-scale biofuel plants can provide biofuels used in 
many small-scale CCHP systems. For the sake of a complete picture of possible biofuel sources, a few 
other processes for the generation of biofuels will be listed shortly: 

• Jatropha oil produced mechanically from Jatropha plants holds high potential for an easy-to-
produce supply of biodiesel [41]. Several other so called energy plants are also currently under 
investigation for efficient generation of biofuels, e.g. Switch grass, Bermuda grass, Silver grass, 
Alamo [42].

• For the production of methane, seaweed (macroalgae) is currently being investigated and 
several pilot projects have proven successful implementation for biofuel production [42]. 

• Microalgae, which are used mainly in urban wastewaters, have been shown to be feasible for 
biofuel production [43]. 

4 Prime Mover 

For the various types of biofuels, different prime movers can be selected, which greatly influence the 
energetic and economic performance of a CCHP plant [21,25,44]. An assessment of key characteristics 
of prime movers presented in this study is shown in Table 1 (No publications could be found that 
considered steam engines in this context, thus this prime mover is omitted). The assessment of the 
potential for a given prime mover estimates the ability for biomass-fired CCHP market penetration in 
the near future. It is based on findings from different sources as well as on the authors’ judgement.

4.1 Internal Combustion Engines 
Due to their advanced technological development, low initial investment costs and widespread 
distribution, internal combustion engines (ICEs) represent the most often applied and most researched 
prime mover. The nominal electric loads of ICEs can range from 3 kW to up to 100 MW, making them 
applicable for all sizes of small-scale CCHP system. In addition, the electric efficiency of ICEs can reach 
up to 45%, but the thermal loses are comparatively high, so that the overall efficiency of ICE systems is 
generally equal or lower compared to other prime movers. In small-scale CCHP systems the amount of 
chemical energy converted into electric energy is found to be a bit lower, usually in the range of 30-35% 
[51]. Especially in the context of syngas usage, ICEs are quickly damaged by low quality gases (i.e. 
sticky tar can clog injection nozzles) and hence their efficiency is lowered significantly [48,49]. 
Therefore, bigger CCHP systems using ICEs and direct gasification generally include more 
sophisticated cleaning systems [52]. All described systems of small-scale bio-fired CCHP systems with 
ICEs are summarized in Table 2-Table 5. Cases of small-scale bio-fired CCHP systems using ICEs in 
combination with solar extensions are summarized in Table 8.

4.2 Fuel Cells 
With no moving parts and no combustion, fuel cells (FCs) are a completely different type of prime 
mover from their mechanical counterparts, excelling in environmental impact and load flexibility [45]. 
However, the environmental benefit is rapidly equalized when considering the energy consumption and 
GHG emissions for producing hydrogen or methane as fuel. FCs generally have a high electric efficiency 
and thus a lower heat recovery and bio-fueled CCHP systems using FCs which can serve loads from less 
than 1 kW to more than 1,000 kW have been demonstrated [5,21,76,77]. A huge disadvantage for FCs is 
the need of very high fuel purity levels. Research is therefore being conducted in techniques to remove 



     

 

 12 (34) 
 

sulphur, halogens, alkali and siloxanes from biogas, while for gasification systems, an efficient 
technology to remove tar is still the main obstacle for commercialization with investigations still 
ongoing [78–81]. Table 7 shows a summary of the investigated small-scale biomass-fired and solar-
assisted CCHP systems. There is also a case of system with an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) enhanced 
by a FC (see Table 11).

4.3 Stirling Engines 
Compared to the previously mentioned ICEs, Stirling engines (SEs) have the potential to operate more 
quietly, with better partial load performance and low maintenance costs due to less moving parts 
[12,48,87]. They can satisfy electric loads from a few kW up to 150 kW, while also being able to provide 
high temperature heat exhausts with high thermal efficiency [2,21,88]. Especially in the context of 



     

 

 13 (34) 
 

biomass usage, SEs show great fuel flexibility being able to be driven by direct combustion of biomass 
or by combustion of syn- or biogas, because the heat can be applied externally [89]. Uncertainties in 
operating SEs and high investment costs hinder further use of SE technology [89]. A summary of the 
investigated small-scale bio CCHP systems with Stirling engines is given in Table 8. 

There are few cases using SEs as prime movers in the context of small-scale CHP and CCHP systems, 
which however report promising results for reducing GHG emissions due to high energetic efficiencies 
[89–97]. However only few cases of such systems fueled explicitly with biomass could be found within 
the literature of scientific journals, which are summarized in Table 8.

4.4  Organic Rankine Cycles 
Compared to ICE and conventional turbines, Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) perform better when run 
under partial load, although there can be significant losses [48]. ORCs are a potential key technology 
for achieving successful commercialization of small-scale CCHP systems [87]. ORCs have been proven 
to successfully satisfy loads from 100 kW up to 2 MW, while even smaller systems are currently 
researched in a pre-commercial status [47,99]. Larger systems can reach electric efficiencies of up to 
35% and overall energetic efficiencies of around 85%, but systems smaller than 100 kW reach only 
lower electric efficiencies of about 15% [100]. A key decision for designing an ORC system is the choice 
of the organic working fluid, where several characteristics have to be considered: heat transfer 
properties, environmental impact, safety issues, chemical stability, pressure requirements, costs and 
availability, molecular weight, freezing point, curve of saturation, thermodynamic performance, 
corrosiveness [47,99,101]. A detailed overview of working fluids for low-temperature organic Rankine 
cycles can be found in Saleh et al. [102]. As mentioned before, several studies tested the combination of 
ORC with FCs (s. chapter4.2), but there are also numerous studies on small-scale CCHP systems 
relying solely on ORCs. In Table 9-Table 11, the cases of small-scale biomass-fired and solar-assisted 
CCHP systems using ORCs are summarized.

4.5 Steam and Gas Turbines 
Conventional steam and gas turbines can serve electric loads of several hundreds of MW, but internally 
fired gas turbines are rarely smaller than 500 kW while steam turbines are rarely smaller than 50 kW 
[21]. Both types of turbines suffer significant losses in efficiency when used in partial load mode, so 
steam and gas turbines are an inconvenient choice for flexible small-scale CCHP systems [26]. 



     

 

 17 (34) 
 

However, the high temperature of exhaust gases holds high potential for further usage for heating and 
cooling applications. Studies suggest that small-scale gas turbines with 100-600 kW electric output are 
economically disadvantageous compared to internal combustion gas engines, but future technologies 
could change this status [118]. A summary of the two previous cases is given in Table 12. 

There are certain studies that investigate the use of considerably small steam and gas turbines in CCHP 
systems, providing useful insights for other small-scale systems, especially run with micro-turbines as a 
prime mover. It can be found that for smaller systems (2 – 3.5 MW) the highest exergy losses occur in 
the furnace [119] and that the values of energy efficiency of steam and gas turbines are similar for CHP 
systems [120]. One case where a gas turbine cycle of unspecified nominal power is combined with two 
ORC cycles has been mentioned in chapter 4.4. 

4.6 Micro Turbines 
Micro-turbines are another promising technology on the brink of mass-scale commercialization for 
CHP and CCHP systems [121]. Micro-turbine sizes range from a few kW to several hundreds of kW, 
while even smaller capacities are being investigated. Apart from the disadvantages mentioned in Table 
1, there is also the need for high quality fuels when run on bio- or syngas [21]. A solution to this 
problem could be externally fired micro-turbines, where studies suggest that syngas containing more 
tar can lead to higher electric efficiencies [122]. Simulations of a biomass CHP system comparing an 
internally fired micro-turbine fueled with syngas to an externally fired micro-turbine driven by direct 
combustion could show that the latter reaches higher electric efficiency and higher overall efficiency 
with less biomass consumption [123]. In a case study for a polygeneration system, a 100 kW micro 
turbine was driven externally using direct combustion of biomass and natural gas [124]. It could be 
shown that with a mixture of 70/30 for bio/natural gas fuel, an electric efficiency of 21.8% could be 
reached, but a further increase of biomass would lower efficiency. Two cases of a trigeneration system 
using a micro gas turbine are presented in Table 12.

4.7 Solar Extensions 
In comparison to bioenergy, solar energy has an even bigger potential with negligible operational costs 
as there are no fuel costs [130]. With the costs for PV cells plummeting from $76.67 per Watt in 1977 to 
$0.36 per Watt in 2014 and the use of solar thermal energy always having been simple and cheap, solar 
energy becomes more and more competitive [17]. The key findings and characteristics of a solar-driven 
CCHP system with an auxiliary biomass boiler are shown in Table 13. Another study considering a 
purely solar-driven CCHP system based on an ORC was mentioned in Table 11.

In direct comparison with bioenergy or fossil fuels, solar energy is disqualified for fueling CHP or 
CCHP systems on its own [114]. It is therefore necessary to combine solar energy with either advanced 
electric and/or thermal storages or with other energy sources like biofuels [17,20]. Using solar energy 
this way in a CCHP system can lead to significant reductions of CO2 emissions and to higher energy 
utilization compared to stand-alone as well as CHP systems [132]. For solar extensions in bio-driven 
small-scale CCHP systems, there are five main configurations in which the solar energy can enhance 
the performance of the whole system (as illustrated in Figure 2): 

1. Solar thermal energy can enhance the biochemical or thermochemical conversion of biomass 
into fuel for the prime mover to reduce biomass consumption (example case [133]). 

2. Solar thermal energy can be used to preheat the air intake of the prime mover, which then will 
increase the efficiency of a combustion process (example case [134]). This is quite common for 
gas turbines and bigger systems. 

3. Solar thermal energy can be used to produce steam directly and to temporarily run the prime 
mover without any usage of biomass (example case [114,133]). This configuration is often 
applied in systems using ORCs. 

4. Solar thermal energy can be used to reheat any stream after the exhaust for enhancing the heat 
supply or the thermally activated cooling process. This way, when electricity demand is low, the 
heat and cooling demand can still be satisfied in partial mode and biomass can be saved 
(example case [83]). 

5. PV cells can provide electric energy and thus the prime mover has to satisfy less electric 
demand, so that biomass can be saved (example case [135]).

Figure 2 Possible solar extensions in biomass-fired small-scale CCHP systems 

This figure does not represent PV/thermal (PVT) components, which are essentially a combination of 
PV and solar thermal technology. Such PVT collectors are still not reliable and cost-effective enough for 
market penetration, but are promised to have huge potential in the near future [136]. As for Figure 2, 
the application of PVT collectors in a small-scale CCHP system would be a combination of any of the 
options 1-4 with option 5. 

Essentially all five configurations imply a temporary decrease in biomass consumption. This has 
several advantages for the system: 

• Operational costs can be lowered as there will be less costs for the biomass itself and the 
biomass transport to the system [24].  

• It leads to a better short-term CO2 balance, because the combusted biomass needs several years 
to be reincorporated into the biomass cycle, as well as to a better long-term CO2 balance, 
because less energy will be used in transport vehicles. 

• In some cases, the possibility to run systems only on solar energy can be a fallback option for 
stand-alone systems in case of a shortage of biomass supply.  

However, there are also certain drawbacks to be considered: 

• The installation of additional solar units leads to higher capital costs. 
• The installation of additional solar units leads to higher complexity for the design and 

operation of the CCHP. 

5 Cooling Units and Storage Systems 

Seizing the exhaust heat from a prime mover by connecting it with a cooling unit can lead to higher 
profitability [137]. Similarly energy storage technologies improve the economic viability of small-scale 
CCHP systems [138]. It is therefore imperative for a clear picture of small-scale CCHP systems to know 
about the most important thermally activated cooling technologies and storage technologies. 

5.1 Thermally Activated Cooling Technologies 
Although CHP systems have been in use since the installation of the first commercial power plant, 
CCHP systems have only experienced very slow development until the oil crisis in 1979 [139]. Since 
then the commercialisation of thermally activated cooling units accelerated and with it the 
development of CCHP systems. A commonly used parameter to describe the efficiency of refrigeration 
units is the coefficient of performance (COP), which is the cooling capacity of the unit divided by its 
heat or electricity consumption [74]. 



     

 

 21 (34) 
 

Three different thermal refrigeration technologies can be applied in CCHP systems [140]: 

• Absorption chillers (ACs) 
• Adsorption chillers 
• Desiccant chillers 

ACs are the most commonly used type of thermally activated chillers, especially Lithium Bromide–
Water (LiBr) and Water-Ammonia chillers [12,20,140]. In LiBr-chillers evaporating a low pressure, 
working fluid (water) in an evaporator “draws” heat and hence cools the surrounding. The gaseous 
water is then absorbed by the LiBr-salt solution in the absorber, the mixture reheated to evaporate the 
water and the water then condensed. The process scheme of a single-effect absorption refrigerator is 
illustrated in Figure 3. 

 

  

Figure 3 Simplified process of Single-Effect Absorption Refrigeration (based on [149]) 

LiBr-ACs can be driven by pressurized hot water with more than 120 °C or gases with more than 
400°C. Their advantages are the familiarity with the technology, the low investment costs and the high 
COP. Ammonia-water chillers work under the same basic principle as LiBr-chillers, but due to the 
lower evaporation temperature of ammonia, they can be used for lower temperature applications and 
in smaller sizes [12,139,140].  

Another technology, which can be applied to low-heat sources and which is more environmentally 
friendly, is adsorption chilling. The basic working principle is similar ACs; however, the working fluid is 
only adsorbed to the surface of the adsorbent. The most common adsorption chillers use silica gel, as 
this type has been successfully commercialized [140]. Drawbacks of adsorption chillers are higher 
investment costs [12] and lower COP [139]. Nonetheless, they are sometimes chosen for small-scale 
CCHP systems (see Table 4, Table 7 and Figure 4). 

A novel technology emerging on the market is desiccant cooling, where either a desiccant wheel or a 
liquid desiccant dries and heats up an incoming air stream, which can then be cooled down by 
surrounding air. In an evaporator the air then is rehumidified while its temperature is lowered 
immensely [141]. Desiccant cooling can be advantageous in small-scale residential systems due to its 
low maintenance costs and combined control of humidity and temperature [140]. Two cases using 
desiccant cooling could be found (see Table 6 and Table 9). Apart from thermally driven refrigeration 
systems, vapour compression chillers driven by electric or mechanical energy are often chosen in CCHP 
systems [5]. The advantages of vapour compression chillers are high COP and higher reliability due to 
independence from the thermal heat of the system, but they are less environmentally friendly, emit 
more noise and require more maintenance [2,32].

5.2 Storage Units 
In the context of solar energy, batteries are often identified as the means to enable versatility of solar 
energy sources, hence making solar energy a feasible alternative to conventional energy sources [142]. 
The worldwide energy capacity of batteries for utility-scale energy storage applications is predicted to 
rise from 412 MWh in 2014 to 51,200 MWh in 2023, which implies an annual growth rate of more than 
71% [143]. A plurality of battery technologies is currently investigated and a review of all of these is 
beyond the scope of this paper. Hence, it is here referred to recent reviews of battery technologies for 
further information [144,145]. 

Concerning thermal storages, simple water tanks are the most common and simplest solution, as water 
has a high specific capacity and the installation of a water tank is an easy and cheap task. A more 
compact way to store thermal energy can be provided by phase change materials (PCM). These 
materials use the energy needed for a phase change to either store or absorb heat [146]. Apart from 
storing energy for direct heating or cooling purposes, the heat can also be stored to preheat biofuels at a 
constant temperature and hence help with the start-up of an engine as well as to increase its efficiency 
[147].  

6 Results and Discussion 

As can be seen in Figure 4, most studies were simulation models, which themselves were often based 
on synthetic data or data collected from subsystems. Although there are some experimental studies, it 
seems that there is a general lack of real-life data in this area [148]. This may be due to an 
underestimation from researches of increased maintenance works and complexity, as operators may 
value the simplicity of a system highly. Additionally, as with every new technology, the overall lifetime 
of the components as well as their decay over time cannot be determined based on operation 
experience. There might be more real-life examples outside of scientific literature whose insights have 
not been documented for the scientific community. It was also found that nearly one out of four cases 
considers solar-assistance to enhance the biomass-fired systems. The potential of combining these two 
energy sources has thus been recognised. 

In the cases of biomass-fired CCHP systems investigated in this paper, downdraft gasifiers seem to be 
the most practical choice for gasification due to the high quality of the syngas [40]. These gasification 
systems are mostly below 500 kW nominal power, as smaller gasification systems are generally more 
cost-effective than larger ones due to lower maintenance costs [10]. In the case studies investigated in 
this paper, anaerobic digestion is also an often-used technology. While for off-grid CCHP systems 
thermal and electric storage units are usually indispensable, for on-grid systems they are often 
overlooked in models despite their potentially high impact on economics [18]. If the use of a thermal 
storage system was stated at all, it was usually water tanks and only in one case PCM. 

It could be found that LiBr-absorption is the most often used technology in the investigated cases of 
biomass-fired and solar-assisted CCHP systems. Ammonia-water chillers have also been proposed 
often, while for some models the concrete working pair for the AC has not been specified. As shown in 
Figure 4, AC technology is used significantly more often than other technologies.

Payback time was chosen as the most convenient economic variable, but it is difficult to compare the 
economic viability of different systems based on this variable, because some studies include subsidies 
while some do not. It is remarkable that almost every model achieved economic viability, at least when 
subsidised. Together with the lack of studies on real-life, successful systems, this suggests a certain 
economic bias within the scientific community towards such renewable energy systems and their 
efficiencies (see also [149,150]). To promote small-scale biomass systems in rural and off-grid areas, 
where the benefits may be strongest, it is necessary to inform the population about the benefits and to 
educate the system owner and operators in technical training institutes [151]. 

Most case studies identify the prime mover as the most important unit of the CCHP system, because it 
has the biggest impact on energetic, ecologic and economic performance. Future research in the fields 
of SEs, FCs and micro turbines can lead to considerable competitiveness of these technologies 
compared to ICEs, while ORCs are already penetrating the market successfully [12,21,25,48]. Despite of 
the instability with bio- and syngas and the regular maintenance requirements of ICEs, until today they 
still seem to be the preferred choice for investors. But due to the external combustion SEs or Micro 
turbines can be used in combination with gasification for greater robustness [89,122]. Additionally, 
these technologies could surpass the performance of ICE driven systems and can lead to small-scale 
CCHP systems with even higher ecologic and economic benefits. However, other technologies 
concerning heat exchangers, cooling units, gasifiers or digesters will also develop further due to new 
materials and better simulation programs [18,152–155].  

This study concentrated on systems which produce electricity, heating and cooling, but there are 
several polygeneration systems which produce other energy products like biofuels (e.g. hydrogen, 
methane), chemicals for production processes, purified water or food [156,157]. These technologies 
offer a huge variety of different system configurations for more efficient, more flexible and more 
environmentally friendly biomass usage, but they also increase the complexity of such systems. While 
some studies explicitly concentrate on storage possibilities, especially for off-grid systems, other studies 
completely ignore the possible benefits of storing electric and/or thermal energy. Nonetheless, on-

going advances in fields like phase-change materials or solid-state batteries will enter the energy 
market and increase the economic feasibility of small-scale CCHP systems, especially for off-grid 
systems and for solar-assisted systems [138,158–160]. For grid-connected systems data optimization, 
which will enable better synchronization of various interconnected CCHP systems, and load shifting 
techniques will improve their energetic and economic efficiency [138,161,162]. Other promising 
technologies emerging on the market are carbon capture and storage (CCS), where the CO2 is stored 
away, and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU), where the CO2 is used for chemical products. CCS and 
CCU can push the carbon balance of biomass-fired CCHP systems into negative areas [5,163].  

Overall, the CCHP market is currently experiencing enormous growth and several technologies are 
competing with each other while also opening up new possibilities [14,21]. The same can be said for the 
research in various subfields; several technologies now passed the experimental stage and can be 
applied and investigated in CCHP systems, while unripe technologies will enter this stage soon. Hence, 
the amount of studies in this field is growing rapidly [25]. 

7 Conclusion 

In this study, the most important components for biomass-fired, small-scale CCHP systems have been 
presented and described according to their most current development. Furthermore, for each prime 
mover, the most recent case studies and their key characteristics have been presented. The results of 
these findings have been discussed and put into the context of current and future technology 
development.  

Although the field of small-scale biomass-fired and biomass-fired solar-assisted CCHP systems gains 
rising interest in the scientific community, most studies are based on simulation models instead of 
experimental data. This leads to a gap between theoretical and practical feasibility of such systems. 
Models often show very cost-effective and feasible systems, but investors seem to be reluctant due to 
the uncertainty involved. This suggests an economic bias within the scientific field towards such 
systems. Future policy implementations should therefore consider the need for extra maintenance in 
combination with the increased complexity of such systems. Flexible and fast responding systems 
should be promoted. Especially regions with high energy prices, like islands or off-grid, rural areas, 
should be targeted for financial support. However, also in regions with good electric infrastructure, 
these small systems may help with the goal of decentralization and lead to higher energy resilience of 
communities and individuals. Research and finance projects should not just monitor the design and 
construction of such systems, but also observe long-term technical and socio-economic effects. 

Additionally, it was found, that many studies consider ICEs and ORCs as prime mover, but only few 
investigate the possibilities of other upcoming prime mover technologies like SEs, FCs or micro 
turbines. Especially in the context of biomass gasification prime movers need to show robustness and 
fuel flexibility, which ICEs often lack. Therefore, the chances for other prime movers to gain greater 
shares in the market are very high. To accelerate this development, policy implementations should 
promote the use of alternative prime movers, especially in combination with innovative biomass pre-
treatment technologies. Governments could finance such projects directly or give incentives to 
companies investing in such technologies through tax reductions or establishing knowledge transfer 
networks. 

Moreover, stricter execution of already established policies like CO2-taxes may accelerate the transition 
towards renewable CCHP systems. Nonetheless, all of the systems investigated require a stable supply 
of raw biomass or processed biofuels. Policy implementations should therefore consider that a higher 
biomass consumption for such systems may endanger entire ecosystems and may lead to competition 
with areas for food production.
