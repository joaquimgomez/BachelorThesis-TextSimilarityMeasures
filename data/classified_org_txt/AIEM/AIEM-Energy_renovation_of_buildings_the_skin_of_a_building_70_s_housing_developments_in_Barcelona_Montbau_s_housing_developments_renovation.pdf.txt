Abstract: This study, considering the current conditions of our planet, proposes to analyze how efficient is to renovate building skins
to meet energy, economic, and CO2 emission criteria.

A building envelope is the part of a building that is most exposed to weather conditions and therefore it has an impact on the internal
energy demand of its inhabitants so that they can comfortably there. Studying building skins and their status in terms of energy,
economic costs, and CO2 emissions will allow renovation to produce benefits in the medium and long-term.

This study was conducted in the neighborhood of Montbau, a housing development of around 30 buildings,  each with different
characteristics, built in the 70’s and currently having energy losses through their skins, which results in a high demand of internal
energy for heating and cooling purposes, in addition to doubled emission of CO2e released into the atmosphere.

Improvements are proposed to adapt the conditions of these buildings. Two solutions are proposed in addition to evaluating energy
costs caused by CO2e emissions and any other economic costs year 2012. Other studies analyze the behavior of buildings already
implementing such solutions and their corresponding energy, emission, and economic reductions.

The importance of  such studies  lays  on the need to  analyze options such as  renovation instead of  considering demolition as  an
alternative,  and  to  suggest  the  future  building  of  housing  developments  in  pro  of  the  sustainability  of  our  planet  and  offer  an
alternative for a sustainable future, housing and shelter under optimal conditions. The figures herein offer solid results in terms of
expenses, costs and energy savings, as well as the reduction of CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere. The graphs and tables
here contained offer a clear reading and suggest topics for further research and even for starting up building projects, both locally and
worldwide.

Keywords: Building skin, CO2 Eq emissions, Energy, Housing development, Renovation, Sustainable future.

TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND RENOVATION

In  1987,  the  “Brundtland  Report  (Our  Common Future)”,  defined  the  term sustainable  as  “development  which
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Given
the evidence of the disasters caused by the indiscriminate use of non-renewable natural resources, pollution of water
resources, the drying out of said resources, and the emission of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, among
others, alerts are becoming more frequent and consequences are much more serious as the 21st Century advances.

In 1997, during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol was established:
an agreement made by 140 countries to address the problem of global warming, with the primary objective of reducing
the increase of gases produced by the greenhouse effect.

By the  60’s,  with  the  boom of  the  Modern  Movement,  mass  housing  developments  started  to  appear,  trying  to
provide shelter for a growing population. Housing developments emerged as an aesthetic proposal with high and large
buildings would provide housing to population who did not owned a house. Their construction allowed managing large
plots of land at once to facilitate city development mechanisms and opened new views on urban growth. The Modern
Movement intended, along with the new aesthetics and new solutions, the use of different building materials which also
adapted to economic requirements.

By the end of the 20th Century, the Brunald Report defined the term sustainable, at the same time that the need for
social equity and resource management arose, but changes in recent years make imperative to recover the housing stock
that  was  built  during  those  times  as  an  essential  part  of  the  construction  of  cities  to  face  the  future  of  our  planet.
Therefore, it is necessary to renovate, reconstruct and reuse buildings. Occupation of the territory beyond measure must
come to an end, but it is also necessary to recover the right to a decent and fair housing. The substitution of buildings
for new ones brings higher and increasing costs. Economic conditions and drastic changes in the economy in recent
decades oblige us to stop and contemplate the need for alternatives to recover our environment and create sustainability.

As  for  the  current  conditions,  it  is  estimated  that  an  average  global  warming  in  excess  of  2°C  may  generate
irreversible  problems  on  ecosystems  and,  therefore,  affect  economy,  productive  models,  agriculture,  and  produce
extreme weather  events  with  devastating  effects  that  we  are  already  facing  in  our  daily  life.  The  increase  of  CO2e
emissions released into the atmosphere is linked to human activities such as intensive use of fossil fuels and destruction
of forests,  causing droughts and destructing aquifers. Cities, buildings, factories and vehicles emit high amounts of
CO2e  to  work.  For  instance,  a  housing  building  emits  high  amounts  of  CO2e  to  be  able  to  provide  heating  to  its
inhabitants,  and  such  heating  is  emitted  by  sources  and  resources  that  tend  to  run  out.  Everyday,  more  and  more
emissions are generated.

This study develops and poses as a hypothesis the renovation of building skins on buildings constructed before the
NBE-CT-79 regulation on energy saving was enacted.

Even if the conditions of the studied buildings are good, their construction took place over fifty years ago when the
need for  shelter  was a  priority  over  the  indiscriminate  use  of  natural  resources.  These buildings  require  immediate
intervention to meet necessary comfort conditions that are consistent with the respect for the environment. Renovation
would allow the recovery of housing developments, in addition to ensure their habitability over time and contribute to
building a sustainable city, mitigating CO2e emissions released into the atmosphere and reducing energy costs.

The studies and results of the renovation of the skin of similar buildings, along with the proposed solutions are
posed as a tool for further analysis on the impact and need for renovation as a feasible option. While the specific case of
the buildings in Montbau, Barcelona, Spain, is analyzed herein, based on the current and deteriorated economic scope,
the methodology and analysis at local or international level may be replicated for similar cases in the future.

1. STATE OF THE ART. BUILDING AS A WHOLE AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MONTBAU

A building is a construction whose purpose is to lodge different human activities - “a construction made of resistant
materials for human habitation” (RAE) - a consumer of material resources and a great energy exchanger. From the
process of its construction and subsequent use, a building will be a medium to exchange energy, which finally and in
some cases is used in building deconstruction.

Construction, housing in particular, is a consumer item such as any other good (cars, computers, etc.), that can be
bought, sold, possessed, inherited, and with prices that flow on markets. However, permanence of buildings over time
can take years or even centuries; a fact that gives buildings a different and attractive characteristic.

Traditionally, buildings were constructed having into account varied environmental conditions such as geographical
location and climate. Traditional architecture was respectful of the scope of buildings and their construction took into
account  such  characteristics,  by  using  transparent  or  opaque  skins,  to  harness  or  get  protection  against  external
conditions.

In the early 20th Century, in Europe, and especially in the US, modernity and industrialization proposed the use of
new  materials  for  construction  such  as  steel  and  glass  (Fig.  1),  which  transformed  architecture  and  the  design  of
building skins by reducing mass and increasing transparent surfaces. This change in materials required the use of energy
sources, initially inexpensive, such as oil, which allowed a degree of comfort and habitability. Any material was then

used for building skins or any constructive solution was allowed since temperature regulation was produced by energy-
consuming means either for heating or cooling.

der Rohe: paperback Studio Ed Gustavo Gili).

Global social and economic conditions in the mid-twentieth Century varied drastically. The growth of cities, the
excessive exploitation of non-renewable natural resources, the crisis of economic patterns, among other factors, were
evident in the needs and wants of large cities. In the 70’s, energy becomes expensive and the oil crisis is announced, the
world revolves around the search for alternative energy resources. The United States, France, and the Soviet Union take
a  chance  on  nuclear  power  plants,  industrialized  countries  without  energy  resources  seek  to  decrease  energy
consumption in various areas:  industry,  transport,  and housing.  Regulations are driven to achieve such savings and
therefore there is an impact on the way of building and living in cities.

In Spain, the first  regulation on energy saving, the NBE-CT-79 standard was worded by the end of the 70’s,  in
response to the crisis. By then, most of the buildings constructed in the previous decades, especially in the 50’s and
60’s, that were not considered historical patrimony did not meet current minimum “sustainability” requirements and
therefore the idea is to prevent the loss of energy through their skin as the materials used in their construction were not
intended to such purpose.

Indoor environmental conditions depend on the heat flow established through the various enclosures comprising a
building. The enclosure and the way the interiors of buildings are constructed have an impact on the indoor ‘weather’
and comfort needs.

1.1. The Skin of a Building

A building is a machine immersed in the middle of nature with its thermal, lighting, acoustic conditions, etc. These
may vary over time and they do not usually match the physical needs of human beings, which are relatively constant
and stable. To achieve this stability, it is necessary to act on the skin of the building. The environment is variable and it
has been necessary to create envelopes, -skins protecting such variability-, leaving some indoor spaces free for various
human activities to take place.

A  good  performance  on  the  skin  of  the  building,  either  built  or  renovated,  will  mean  a  decrease  in  energy
consumption,  needed  to  achieve  desired  indoor  comfort.  Constant  indoor  environmental  conditions  are  desired.  A
building can correct its environment through passive systems, such as insulation, radiation, light, ventilation, etc. or
even become in a producer of its environment through active systems, such as solar panels, photovoltaic cells, among
others.  The  materials  and  the  shape  of  a  building  are  the  cornerstones  of  a  good  design  that  results  in  a  good
construction.  This  study  will  focus  on  the  use  of  insulation  materials  -with  their  ability  to  modify  the  internal
environment  of  the  building-adaptable  to  the  shape  of  the  building  and  the  existing  envelope  (Fig.  2).

Mario Cucinella in: http://www.mcarchitects.it/sostenibilita (access February 2014)).

Consumption is controlled from the very design, although in areas with energy surplus, direct energy production
tends to replace the right design. Peter Reyner Banham [2], defines two types of cultures that differ in their attitude
towards a tree: one would build an insulating wall with the tree, and the other would burn it. Our society strongly agrees
with the second standpoint, although the alarm voices of our planet are making us to be aware and change our attitude
and assume our responsibilities.

That which is not achieved with these resources should be sought through external energy for its operation. Most of
such energy comes from fossil resources or limited energy production plants such nuclear plants, with a cost difficult to
appraise  in  the  future,  both  economic  and  environmental  (Chernobyl  or  Fukushim,  for  instance).  It  is  important  to
highlight that in recent years, great progress has been made in terms of solar power plants and wind farms, mainly.

1.2. Building Energy Performance

In order to measure energy performance, a study on the different programs validated to fit our interests has been
conducted. Based on the article Contrasting the Capabilities of Building Energy Performance Simulation Programs [3],
a  comprehensive  comparison  between  20  programs  was  carried  out  to  evaluate  the  topics  they  deal  with  and  their
reliability  in  the  opinion  of  the  experts  consulted  for  such  purpose.  Such  topics  as  “General  Modelling;  Building
Envelope, Day Lighting and Solar; Infiltration, ventilation, (…); Renewable Energy Systems; Electrical System and
Equipment; Environmental Emissions (various types of gases); Economic Evaluation; (…)” were discussed. Currently,
however, topics such as gas emission (CO2e) and economic implications have increasingly acquired more importance.

Recent works as “Establishing a Method to Perform a BPS - Building Performance Simulation” [4] deal the need to
reformulate the “Building Performance Simulation” approach so that it matches more modern approaches such as BIM
[5, 6].

In  this  paper,  we  have  used  DesignBuilder®  since  it  is  the  ‘user-friendly  interface’  of  Energy  Plus.  This  latter
software, along with TRNSYS, the most widely validated software by the scientific community in the field of energy
simulation.

1.3. Renovation

24,000,000 houses currently exist in Spain, out of which approximately 15 million were built before the 80’s (INE,
2007). Over half of the country's houses were not built taking into account any standards to avoid excessive energy
consumption, since at that time no legislation or standards existed to regulate construction processes, neither there were
suggestions for their maintenance and utilization (Fig. 3).

and housing census).

As  a  strategy  to  improve  buildings,  renovation,  and  intervention,  specifically  their  skin,  is  here  proposed.
Renovation is a continuous action made on an existing building in order to adapt it to current needs and conditions.
Improving the skin of a building, will stabilize indoor temperature conditions and, hence, the demands for comfort.

It is necessary to renovate, reconstruct, and reuse (Il s'agit de ne jamais demolir, ne jamais retrancher ou remplacer,
toujours ajouter, transformer et utilitser) [7]. Unmoderated occupation of the territory must stop. The substitution of
buildings  for  new  ones,  increasingly  represent  higher  and  hardly  acceptable  costs  in  economically  degraded
environments.  It  is  imperative to modify the lifespan of  a  building by renovating it  and giving it  a  new life  that  is
consistent with current times, both in terms of regulations, environment, and comfort. (See suggestions for maintenance
and utilization (Fig. 4).

Technology and means to carry out renovation are available, and it is important to demonstrate the capacity and the
impact said actions can have. Renovation has other facets, such as the improvement and optimization of facilities or the
inclusion of active systems, such as photovoltaic cells or panels for water heating; however, this study analyzes a single
aspect of renovation: how to treat a building’s skin.

1.4. Actions in our Environment

-Actions at European Level

Europe is a continent with a rich history that has been constructed throughout centuries. As such, rehabilitation and
intervention of historic buildings must be respectful allowing their past features to be rescued to offer better habitability
conditions for our current times. Regarding edifications, especially houses built between the 60s and 80s in the 20th

century that have not been considered as a cultural heritage or a monument, interventions can be performed on them to
improve their habitability without the limitations of a property declared as cultural heritage good.



32   The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, 2017, Volume 11 Rieradevall i Pons et al.

Various  interventions  have  been  performed  to  recover  and  intervene  buildings  and  neighborhoods  in  different
European countries such as Sweden, Italy, Austria, Germany, and France, among others. In most of them, the main
criteria taken into account for intervention are energy efficiency, mobility, waste management, construction materials
and vegetation, CO2e saving levels, among others to achieve a global standard for possible interventions and results in
the future. Some of the actions carried out include the need to conduct sociology studies (demography, age groups,
occupations,  education,  economic  status,  etc.)  so  that  it  is  possible  to  address  management  efforts  and  project
management.

For  instance,  in  Malmö,  Sweden,  the  need  to  intervene  one  of  the  recently  built  neighborhoods,  called
Augustenborg, was considered in 1998. The neighborhood was built in the late 40s, but by the late 90s it had already
started to deteriorate notoriously, mainly because of the elimination of the traditional, heavy industry dismantling and
the  resulting  unemployment  caused.  The  neighborhood  was  home  to  around  three  thousand  people  and  needed  a
comprehensive  intervention.  The  project  proposed  the  rehabilitation  and  recovery  of  the  environmental  conditions,
public  spaces,  roads,  and mobility,  and its  inhabitants  were  involved through participatory  workshops  and specific
actions to implement it and achieve a sense of belonging. Experiments were conducted with such things as an “electric
pool car” inhabitants may use as long as they return it. Also, waste management procedures were implemented, so 50%
of the waste was actually recycled. On the other hand, a series of actions were commenced on the buildings, such as
improvements in the isolation materials of the facades, installation of thermal solar panels and photovoltaic panels, use
of geothermal energy in sports facilities, and renewal of green areas and growing of vegetation on the roofs. The project
is still ongoing and it has shown excellent results [8].

In Torino, Italy, as part of the “Urban Regeneration and Development” program, an intervention project started in
2001 in suburbs that were built during the industrialization boom in the late 19th century until the middle 60s in the 20th

century. The economic crisis of the late 20th century caused important changes in those suburbs, and intervention was
planned to include urbanism, renovation, infrastructure, socio-economic changes, participation of inhabitants, sociology
analysis,  participatory  workshops,  and  culture  activities.  Arguata,  another  neighborhood,  built  in  the  1920s,  was
intervened in terms of public spaces, roads, infrastructure, and edifications, already deteriorated due to abandonment,
through efficiency measures such as insulation of roofs, reduction of thermal bridges, new low-emissivity windows, and
solar protection. Likewise, a natural gas co-generation plant was built to heat the buildings and produce electric energy.
Actions reduced CO2 emissions (1997) in 52% per year [9].

Another example is Winarskyhof in Viena. Between 2005 and 2008, rehabilitation of a set of buildings constructed
in 1924 started. 127 homes (7,200 m2) were intervened. New low-emissivity windows and doors were installed; facades
and balconies were insulated; water and electricity grids were renewed; lifts were installed, and yards and parks were
redesigned. 76 new apartments were built to replace the mansards, which also allowed the project to be funded [10].

In  France,  architects  Fréderic  Druot,  Anne  Lacaton  &  Jean  Phillippe  Vassal,  proposed  action  strategies  in  the
“Banlieue”, bad reputation suburbs of large French cities. The French State wanted to demolish them to substitute them
with small two-storey houses. The proposal of the architects was to revalue these neighborhoods and reclassify them
based on the idea of projecting the houses to the external areas so that day light and sun energy was harnessed, increase
the surfaces and create large terraces with greenhouses to control energy. By reinterpreting the large buildings in terms
of height and their enormous potential, the concentration of utilities and the optimization of the territory occupancy was
going to be allowed. The project proposed to potentiate community spaces and the way the buildings relate to bathroom
areas,  community  lounges,  restaurants,  playfields  for  children,  among  other  characteristics.  It  was  a  constructive,
typological, and global program of intervention on residential buildings [7].

This  study  especially  approaches  the  importance  of  rehabilitating  buildings,  house  developments,  and
neighborhoods, and the advantages of their costs over time versus the consequences of demolishing and build again.
The rehabilitation of  a  building in the Boulevard du Bois le  Petre clearly showed the advantages and feasibility of
conducting such type of interventions over the simple act of demolishing and build again.

1.5. Estate and Local Actions

Interest in rehabilitation has increased in Spain as a consequence of the crisis of the construction industry. However,
many working groups have rigorously and continually been working for a long while now on documenting the topics
dealt with in this document.

In Zaragoza,  the Mayorship Housing Rehabilitation Service is  conducting a rigorous work by acting on several



Energy Renovation of Buildings the Skin The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, 2017, Volume 11   33

levels not only in terms of buildings and environment, but also in terms of social issues- as most of the inhabitants of
the  area  are  low-income  population.  This  working  group  attempts  to  act  in  terms  of  urbanization  and  planning,
improving the deficit of community spaces, facilities, etc. First, they study the buildings and, according to results, act on
such topics as accessibility, roofs, damp, insulation, window and door frames, climatization, etc [11].

In Madrid,  a  working group of  Universidad Politécnica,  led by Margarita  de Luxán,  conducted a study paid by
“Empresa  Municipal  de  la  Vivienda”  in  order  to  study  the  buildings  of  the  center  of  the  city,  their  physical
characteristics:  shading, ventilation systems, and possible enhancements.  A very interesting document addressed to
architects and builders in that specific area of the city is the result of such study [12].

Margarita de Luxán and Gloria Gómez intervened a building of apartments in San Cristóbal de los Ángeles, Madrid,
by reoriented the windows of the building so that sunlight could easily and efficiently be collected by eliminating the
roof  and  the  façade  and  creating  a  ventilation  system  (heating  and  cooling  the  air),  and  the  interior  spaces  were
improved. The building now satisfies the habitability comfort need of its inhabitants [13].

In Cataluña, ADIGSA has intervened various buildings in the neighborhood of Verdum, and has also intervened
buildings in Trinidad, Barcelona, and in the cities of Terrassa and Planoles. The company has improved accessibility,
window and door frames, insulation, and many other features. Interventions commence with a diagnosis of the building
status as well as the areas to be intervened by simulating energy performance possible savings [14].

2. HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN BARCELONA

After  the  postwar  period,  economic  emergence  affected  the  growth  of  the  city  and  its  population.  Housing
developments  built  in  Barcelona  during  the  60’s  and  70’s  were  an  answer  to  the  need  to  accommodate  a  growing
population who came to the city looking for work and were hired as cheap labor.

In  1929,  the  Housing  Board  was  created  and  its  aim  was  to  eliminate  shantytowns  and  commence  housing
construction for its inhabitants. The first barracks were built by the new residents who arrived in the city and were
retained as labor for the construction of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, built mostly in the mountain of
Montjuïc. Then, inexpensive houses were built to accommodate this population [15].

In 1941, a tool, whose operator was the Association for Home Labor -the main statewide-level promoter linked to
the vertical union- was created. In Barcelona, together with the Municipal Patronage, the first actions inspired by the
housing  development  proposals  submitted  by  the  dictatorship  of  1929  began.  Garden  neighborhoods  with  a  rural
character, located in rural districts, started to be built and featured single-family houses larger than the ones built in
previous years.

The first housing developments that were built, such as El Polvorín, in Montjuïc in 1953 (Fig. 5 Aerial view of the
buildings of El Polvorín) have completely been renovated. Others, such as Torre Llobeta located at Paseo Maragall,
follow the urban design proposed in 1950, where five blocks of the Eixample are built. The church supplied, in some
cases, the deficiencies of the State and to celebrate the 35th  Eucharistic Congress, it commences the construction of
Viviendas del Congreso Eucarístico (Houses of the Eucharistic Congress) with around 2,700 units built over ten years,
between 1952 and 1962 (Fig. 6). Aerial view of Viviendas del Congreso Eucarístico).

In 1953, the “Regional Plan” is worded as an ideological and urbanistic instrument for Barcelona and its area of
influence.  This  plan,  in  the  context  of  a  permissive  management,  led  to  speculative  processes  that  ended  up  over
populating housing developments and the city in general. In 1957, the Social Emergency Plan was worded which most
of the housing developments were created and foreseen, including Southwest Besòs, Montbau, Guineueta, Badalona,
Baró de Viver, Bon Pastor, St. Martín, Cornellà and, Bellvitge [16] (Fig. 7 Situation of polygons in the Barcelona area).

formation of metropolitan Barcelona. The housing estates in Barcelona from 1950 to 1975 PhD thesis directed by Solà-Morales,
Manuel de Barcelona Polytechnic University of Catalonia.

Large housing developments create small cities -within the city- with thousands of houses and inhabitants. In 1968,
Bellvitge housing development created a city with 13,000 houses and between 30,000 to 40,000 inhabitants (Fig. 8
Bellvitge).  In  view  of  the  need  of  construction  projects,  the  private  sector  decided  to  become  a  key  player  in  the
construction of houses, both in lands made available by the town hall an in private-owned lands. Construction to house
increasing population in house developments opens the door to larger populations and speculation for profit [17]. (Fig. 9
Southwest Besòs).

Housing developments, for better or worse, over time became one of Barcelona’s key growth drivers. Allowing
expansion to strong demographic pressures, housing developments started to grow in a disorderly manner and had late
responses to a number of estimates and calculations that were never sufficient.

Therefore,  in  the  past  twenty  years,  policies  towards  the  construction  of  a  large  number  of  houses  -without
considering  urban  furnishing  and  public  space-  as  well  as  the  deficient  and  poor-quality  construction  of  houses
generated a sort of unfinished city [16]. The arrival of democracy began to balance these weaknesses by fostering a
heavy investment in public space and utilities and by renovating buildings.

3. THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MONTBAU

Montbau is located at the foot of Collserola Mountain, above the Ronda de Dalt, between Hospital Universitario of
Vall d'Hebron and Barcelona’s Regional Government Mundet, recently transformed in offices and colleges (Fig. 10
Montbau’s first and second phase constructed).

Montbau’s house development was constructed by public initiatives that  took place between 1953 and 1961 by
architects  Xavier  Subias,  Guillem  Giràldez  and  Pedro  López  Iñigo.  Its  design  reflects  a  clear  modern  sensibility;
structured around a central park and divided into two nuclei, it responds to topography and the environment, which
determine the layout of buildings. Several types of buildings with different sizes and heights, including duplex and
individual apartments, are part of this housing development [18] (Fig. 11).

Montbau represented the trends the city patronage wanted for its housing developments proposals. For this change
to happen, the manager, the deputy consultant, and the architects retained by the city patronage visited several European
cities, especially in Germany. They walked around Frankfurt, Bonn, Cologne, and Berlin, where they visit the Interbau,
including other sites under construction at that moment [15].

Barcelona’s Municipal Housing Patronage commissioned architects Guillermo Giraldez, Pedro Lopez Iñigo and
Xavier Subías/LIGS to draft Montbau’s Partial Plan. These young architects developed the initial proposal in a few days
to be submitted in an exhibition. After the exhibition, the City Council complemented and reformulated some of the
initial proposal points and submitted the Plan again for final approval [18].

Patronat Municipal de l’Habitatge: VCA, DL).

The two largest housing developments of the Municipal Patronage at that time were Montbau and Southwest Besòs.
The former became an operation of prestige and with possibilities for experimentation. The aim was to build 1,440
apartments of 60, 80, and 100 m2, in 31 hectares, with a variety of buildings, towers, linear blocks, and single-family
houses of various shapes.  One of Montbau’s differentiators regarding other developments was the emphasis put on
social infrastructure [15].

The first sector was located on the Southwestern/SW area -first stage- and architects Guillermo Giraldez, Pedro
López  Iñigo  and  Xavier  Subías  /  LIGS  were  commissioned  in  1958.  The  second  stage  was  developed  in  the
Northwestern/NW area and was three years later M. Baldrich -Deputy Developer- A. Bonet, who had not returned from
exile  after  a  few  years  in  Argentina,  J.  Soteras  and  Pedro  J.  Lopez,  architects  of  the  municipality  [18]  were
commissioned. Some initial criteria started to be depreciated and during the first development stage, an additional story
was  added  to  all  projected  buildings.  During  the  second  stage,  the  building  density  was  doubled  by  amending  the
development plan, which was approved in July 1962 (Fig. 12).

The neighborhood has been maintained, over the years, in good conditions. Buildings have not undergone major
changes, saved the closure of some galleries or terraces and the modification of some of their window frames, without
affecting the original design of the buildings. In the NE area, some neighbor communities have made important changes
such  as  the  replacement  of  tiles  or  plastering  in  some  of  the  facades.  Modification  attempts  are  described  in  a
publication of the Municipal Patronage containing proposals for the 1957-1960 three-year period. The concentration of
houses in large housing developments, access to housing ownership on a deferred basis, increase of investment and
social unrest with the purpose of creating facilities in the neighborhood (schools, community centers, etc.) are dealt with
in said publication.

housing (PMH) of Barcelona).

Montbau was a neighborhood for experimentation, based on the visits to Europe, the trends proposed by modernity
and the path dictated by the Athens Charter. A new type of apartments was built to respond to the new needs of the
growing industrial society. Building efficient, all-inclusive, comfortable apartments, with minimal space was the rule.

3.1. Block A - Duplex Buildings (Common Hallway Distribution)

Block A was one of the first buildings ever to be built in Montbau. It is a Ground-Floor Building+10, with only one
staircase and an elevator;  hallways lead to each one of the apartments.  There are two types of apartments:  20 two-
bedroom apartments and 30 three-bedroom apartments (Figs. 13 and 14). The building located towards the Northeast -
Southwest, with the facade of the living rooms facing the afternoon sun. Such orientation is favorable in winter for
heating. Sun can be handled using blinds, curtains, etc. in summer to avoid overheating (Fig. 15). The other duplex
building, Block N, is located in the same orientation.

3.2. Linear Block E-F (Apartments per Floor)

Block E-F is the typical type of apartment building in the area. These blocks are shallow, where apartments face
both facades, allowing good illumination in all the rooms and a good cross-ventilation design for summer time (Fig.
16). Their orientation is Southeast - Northwest. The Southeaster facade receives most of the sun hours and the rear part
receives just a few sun hours and only during summer time (Fig. 17).

3.3. Tower Q (4 Apartments per Story)

Block Q, with a tower design, holds 9 towers, each with 15 floors and 4 apartments per floor (Fig. 18). This block
has two different types of space: A and B. A-type apartments face South. B-type apartments face East and West. In
general, all apartments have good ventilation and illumination in all rooms (Fig. 19).

3.4. UNI14 - (Single-Family Attached Houses)

There are two types of houses in core Montbau. This study focuses on a unit of 14 UNI14 attached houses that
include workshops as a complement to the shopping mall (Figs. 20 and 21). This housing development is organized as
the linear blocks: Southeast - Northwest. The building is located on a slope of land. Access to houses is located on the
main road,  and following the topography,  a  staircase connects,  at  a  lower level,  the adjoining workshop floor.  The
houses are in pairs and distributions have minor differences (Fig. 22).

4. BUILDING SKIN CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS USED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MONTBAU

The skin of a building separates it  from the external conditions and protects it  against weather conditions.  This
protection  has  been  formed  over  time  and  depends  on  the  climate  where  buildings  are  located  at.  The  separation
between the envelope and the structure encourages the emergence of new enclosure surfaces. Said enclosure transmits
its own weight, as well as other loads, such as wind, onto the structure. This separation occurs in modern architecture by
the emergence of new technologies such as concrete and steel, which are the new enclosures defining buildings. In
general, the skin does not hold the building, but does change its composition. These trends are seen in some buildings in
Montbau, where three basic systems of skins are evident: concrete walls (screens and precast), concrete block walls, and
ceramic walls [1].

From the table below (See Table 1 Summary of building types per block), it can be concluded that many buildings
keep their ceramic load-bearing walls as said structures are a common and simple construction system. On the other
hand, higher buildings (A, N, and Q) required innovative structural systems and concrete structures, pillars and screens.
Prefabricated  systems  were  used  also  in  buildings  Blocks  C  and  D,  in  which  these  systems  were  used  both  in  the
structure and in the enclosure.

The  enclosure  study  concludes  that  most  of  the  buildings  suffer  large  energy  losses  since  none  of  them  have
insulation systems in their walls - except Block L, which has 5 cm of insulating wool in the deck. Therefore, comfort
conditions are poor and it is necessary to have systems that consume energy to get them comfortable.

For this study, the status of the four targeted buildings was analyzed: Block A, duplex apartments; Linear Block E-
F,  Block Q,  Towers,  UNI14 Single-Family  houses.  Also,  a  summary was  written  for  the  different  buildings  of  the
complex [15].

5. EVALUATION OF TYPICAL BUILDING IN MONTBAU

Building skins is the envelope that allows specific conditions to occur and isolates living spaces from the external
environment.  Its design and construction must provide solutions for comfort with a minimum energy consumption,
through the contributions provided by constructive solutions, adapted to weather and environmental conditions. The
skin takes on a greater role in situations of lack or reduction of energy resources [19, 20]. The skin is a physical barrier
that should help produce balanced climatically buildings. Skin conditions will impact the mechanical environmental
needs -low or null- that allow regulating a low energy consumption during the lifespan of the building and ensure an
adequate internal thermal comfort [21].

The construction of buildings in Spain, did not take into account these considerations until the energy crisis in the
70’s, -a crisis that affected all the industrialized countries, especially in Europe, with limited sources of energy- leading,
among  other  measures,  to  a  considerable  increase  in  energy  prices.  Given  the  crisis  and  the  economic  costs  of
maintaining  the  minimum  comfort  conditions,  it  was  necessary  to  reconsider  the  construction  system,  forcing  the
emergence of regulations that governed and regulated such type of envelope - NBE-CT-79 Standard-.

Buildings  constructed  between  the  50’s  and  70’s,  -subject  to  analysis  in  this  study-  despite  their  acceptable
conditions, do not meet the minimum comfort standards. Currently, these apartments consume large amounts of energy
to achieve acceptable internal comfort conditions [22].

This study analyzes the current consumption of the 4 types of buildings in the neighborhood of Montbau. This study
will allow the analysis of the current characteristics of the skin of several buildings, as well as knowing the energy
demand of air conditioning, C02e emissions and their economic cost to guarantee inhabitants the acceptable level of
thermal comfort. The analysis, limits its scope to the evaluation of consumption, costs, and CO2e emissions, needed to
achieve the thermal comfort required to warm the different spaces, without refrigerating them. Weather, location -the
neighborhood of Montbau in Barcelona, and the arrangement of buildings- their current position in the territory through
cross-ventilation, allow air currents that generate a regular acceptable temperature in summer time [23].

Simultaneously and complementarily, the study includes an analysis of the behavior of buildings in other climatic
zones of Spain -Madrid and Girona- to assess the impact suffered in different climatic conditions.

For this particular case, DesingBuilder [24] was used. This tool allows controlling temperature, lighting, and energy
analysis of buildings in any climatic situation, as well as assessing comfort and CO2e emissions, among others. The tool
offers the possibility of analyzing both existing buildings and future buildings during their any of the stages of the
design process.

The software allowed to model buildings type A, E-F, Q, and UNI14. Modeling basically consists in geometrically
defining the building, characterizing its constructive elements, defining its occupancy rate, its air conditioning system
and the external environment and climate. The software provides a series of results that will allow the analysis and the
evaluation  of  the  building  behavior  and  thus  estimate  the  various  possibilities  for  future  building  envelope
improvements.

All buildings have high energy consumption, produce high CO2e emissions, and are considerably expensive in terms
of  internal  comfort.  However,  the  buildings  with  the  highest  consumption  rate  are  the  single-family  UNI14  type,
followed by duplex apartments  -Block A-,  linear  blocks  -Block E-F-  and finally  apartment  towers  -Block Q (Figs.
23-25). The most compact buildings -E-F and Q- consume less. The type of housing affects consumption; the more
compact a building is, the less energy it losses is. This is so because there is less skin in contact with the outside, a key
situation to achieve comfortable spaces with a minimum consumption.

Current global study of the neighborhood proves the use of significant amounts of energy with its corresponding
CO2e rates and a considerable economic cost. It is assumed, based on the studies, that most houses present discomfort.

6.  QUANTIFICATION  OF  BUILDING  TYPE  A,  E-F,  Q  AND  UNI  14,  ACCORDING  TO  INSULATION
THICKNESS AND TYPES IN BARCELONA

The objective is to show the evolution of energy needs, CO2e emissions and their cost, depending on the different
insulation thickness proposed for model buildings, by renovating their glazing. To perform this analysis,  insulation
modification is studied, and the effect at a global level and per square meter of the building is taken into account to
create a comparison table between them (Fig. 26).

Fig. (26). Analysis of model buildings (Source: Author).

Graphs summarize all the results. In the case of Barcelona, amendments will allow a clear improvement in all the
buildings; sample analysis, in the modifying of window frames and glazing, shows an improvement between 5 and 16%
depending  on  the  building.  When  the  whole  building  envelope  is  intervened  with  a  7  cm  thick  insulation  system,
improvement reaches 77% in Block E-F, followed by Block A at 56%, Block Q at 49%, and finally the Single-Family
houses block at 35%. The graph shows that the use of a 7 cm and 40 cm insulation thickness, has a steady improvement,
but a minor affectation, depending on the insulation thickness used (Figs. 27-32). We found that the reduction of energy
loss through high insulation levels is the most effective way to conserve energy and establish a stable internal comfort.
Increasing the thickness of the insulation system in 4-6 cm is comparable, in terms of savings, to that obtained when
increased  in  6-12  cm.  The  graphs  show that  constructing  buildings  that  are  fully  insulated  may have  a  higher  cost
performance than the performance obtained, as showed in the reduction of energy consumption (Fig. 26) insulation
effect on the consumption of heating energy) in which it is shown that using 7 cm insulation represents a reduction of
94,602 kWh and an 8-cm increase represents a reduction of only 11,067 kWh. It is necessary to carefully study the
location and external conditions to provide the right solutions [25].

Graphs show that Linear Block E-F has a higher reduction by going from 42.29 kWh/m2 to 9.75 kWh/m2 or 76.94%.
The renovation of the envelope of the duplex building improves substantially, going from 48.73 kW/m2 to 21.16 kW/m2

- 7 cm of insulation - or 56.57%, Tower Q would have a substantial consumption reduction down to 21.10 kW/m2 or
48.48%. Single-family houses, or UNI14, are the ones with the highest reduction with 23.05%, reaching 32.73 kW/m2

by using 7 cm insulation thickness (Fig. 24).

The graphs with the summary of the data show a substantial improvement due to insulation, and show considerable
reductions in energy consumption, CO2e emissions, and economic costs to achieve the desired comfort in apartments
and houses.

The graphs (Figs. 29 and 30) show that the effect on CO2e emissions and cost are parallel to energy consumption
and CO2e emissions which have the same reduction ratios. Improving the envelope of buildings proves a reduction in
energy consumption and emissions associated with its  use.  The most  effective way to  reduce CO2e emissions is  to
reduce the energy demand required to obtain the desired indoors habitability. It is necessary to seek efficiency, mainly
in the end use -buildings-, capture, transformation, and transport of materials [26].

The type of building that responds less effectively and efficiently to the proposed improvements is the single-family
house, followed by duplex buildings, and towers. The most efficient building is the linear block (Figs. 28, 30, 31).



46   The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, 2017, Volume 11 Rieradevall i Pons et al.

This research develops the impact of improvements to building envelopes as a whole and at neighborhood level.
With this overall assessment, it is confirmed that it is not necessary to demolish or occupy more territory to contribute
to the urban development of cities and their environment balance [27].

Summary Table 2 shows that the action on the envelope produces immediate benefits in both energy consumption
and  reduction  of  greenhouse  gases  emission,  and  depending  on  the  insulation  thickness  it  is  possible  to  achieve
reductions in energy consumption, emissions, and cost between 64 and 77%, depending on the case. To reduce 30% of
greenhouse gases emissions in the European Union by 2020 - DB HE Basic Document: Energy Savings, (2013), with
error corrections by BOE 08711/2013- is the current environmental objective. Such objective can be achieved by acting
on the building envelopes and acting in a comprehensive manner on the various neighborhoods of our cities.

Acting on the envelope with the proposed improvements will enhance the quality of life of its residents, the facades
of buildings,  that  have been degraded over time or have received none or little maintenance, and the interaction of
buildings with the environment. These transformations with the different degrees of existing performance revitalize and
consolidate neighborhoods and cities.

7. CONSTRUCTIVE IMPROVEMENTS AND QUATIFICATION

Time affects the targeted buildings. Most of these buildings do not meet the minimum requirements of comfort, or
even regulations. The materials they were built with are deficient and make it difficult to meet the basic requirements
regarding living conditions and comfort.

The skin of the buildings must ensure the protection of their users against weather conditions, noise, and pollution,
among others. External conditions pierce building skins and affect their internal habitability and desirable conditions.
External conditions impact the envelope over time, degrading its conditions and causing a lower degree of comfort [28].

Apartment  buildings are  slowly updated and most  of  the times do not  get  the minimum necessary maintenance
works for their preservation. The division of most buildings in “condominiums”, along with a poor management on the
part of owners, makes renovation difficult. The current economic change -a brake on new construction projects and an
economic and environmental crisis- requires action on existing buildings to develop a new way to build and provide
houses and apartments with the required comfort conditions [27].

Any action for renovation of an existing building implies adding a layer of new materials on an existing envelope.
Therefore, it represents energy consumption, CO2e emissions and an economic cost at the time of its construction. New
materials will be added to allow the lifespan of buildings to be extended.

The objective of this section is to define the demand for materials based on the constructive solutions established
and then calculate energy costs and CO2e emissions produced by acting on the envelopes.

To conduct this study and define demand, the construction software called TCQ-2000 ITEC - Institut de Tecnologia
i Edificació de Catalunya- was used. The software consists of a set of informatics apps that provide support to drafting,
procurement, planning, and project control activities. By using this software, it is possible to calculate the economic and
energy costs of a building, in addition to CO2e generation. This study establishes two types of construction solutions,
both for the facades and the roof that fit our sample buildings -A, E-F, Q and UNI14- with various insulation thickness
using conductivity materials  that  are similar  between them. Likewise,  two types of  window frames -aluminum and



Energy Renovation of Buildings the Skin The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, 2017, Volume 11   47

wood-, used to complement the regeneration of the skin of the building are studied. This study is not intended to be an
executive  construction  project,  but  aims  at  establishing  parameters  to  analyze  how  the  building  behaves  after  an
intervention  on  its  skin,  in  terms  of  energy  costs,  greenhouse  gases  emissions,  and  economic  costs,  according  to
standardized solutions with insulation thickness that has already been established (Fig. 33).

Fig. (33). Scheme analysis of adaptation of standard solutions. (Source: Author).

Two constructive proposals are analyzed. Both options have variable insulation thickness. The first proposal, T1
(overlying), will bear a double mortar layer placed over the insulation. This method allows the recovery of the image of
the building as it can replicate shapes and moldings. The recovery of the material is difficult in the future and that is
why insulating material  has been incorporated within a stone mass.  T2,  the second proposal,  is  having a ventilated
facade where all the materials are joint by mechanical systems, allowing future disassembly and recycling. Also, this
type of ventilated facade is more favorable in warmer climates, as they allow chamber ventilation and reduce the impact
the sun has on the interior of buildings.

To assess energy, economic, and emission costs, these two constructive solutions, T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated
facade), are proposed, and by using the TCQ 2000 software, the economic cost of the constructive reform is assessed.
The  software  allows estimating  the  energy cost  of  the  adaptation  and the  emissions  that  occur  when analyzing  the
performance of the facade. These solutions are tailored to type A, E-F, Q and UNI14 buildings.

Having demonstrated the technical  feasibility and obtained the economic,  energy,  and CO2e emission value per
square  meter  of  the  constructive  solutions  adapted  to  the  targeted  buildings,  the  renovation  cost  of  each  building,
according to their construction type, is evaluated, as well as the insulation thickness and window frames chosen.

To establish said values, wall enclosure surfaces are evaluated, as well as any openings and the roof of each one of
the targeted buildings. The foregoing is conducted for both constructive proposals, T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated
facade), to obtain the results [1].

For each type of building these two constructive solutions -T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade)- are proposed,
including two types of window frames (aluminum or wood), both with double glazing and the four types of insulation
thickness -7, 10, 15, and 40 cm-. For each of these proposals, the energy cost of CO2e and economic value that should
be invested to renovate the envelope and recover the habitability of the interior spaces is obtained.

Facade renovations costs are influenced by the type of building materials chosen. The influence of aluminum is very
high in all the buildings. Energy costs and CO2e emissions can be doubled or tripled when building the same openings
with  wooden structures.  It  is  necessary  to  assess  maintenance  costs  considering  that  as  time passes  these  costs  are
balanced.

8. EFFICIENCY BETWEEN CO2e EMISSIONS AND ECONOMIC COSTS

The envelope of the targeted buildings was constructed in a specific time, on a number of techniques, constructive,
economic, and environmental characteristics of that specific time. The needs of habitability and legal environmental
conditions have changed over the years and as mentioned in previous sections, an adaption to new needs, in terms of
comfort, energy consumption, and greenhouse gases emissions, is necessary [22].



48   The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, 2017, Volume 11 Rieradevall i Pons et al.

Spain imports much of the energy it uses. It depends 76% on an external energy source. Spain's energy balance is
negative,  and  therefore,  reducing  consumption  will  improve  the  overall  trade  balance  of  the  country.  Through this
study, it will be possible to prove energy reductions and assess the economic cost represented by renovation [29].

In the previous sections, the heating demand was established with its corresponding energy, CO2e, and economic
needs, for the current envelope. Then, the incidence of acting on the envelope of the various buildings -A, E-F, Q,
UNI14-  was  assessed  considering  various  insulation  materials  with  different  thickness  -7,  10,  15,  and  40  cm-  and
modifying the window frames -wood or aluminum- using double glazing. After that, the costs of the improvements and
updating of the envelope was assessed using two constructive proposals: T1 (overlying), and T2 (ventilated facade),
based  on  the  thickness  established  using  adaptable  materials  that  can  fit  existing  materials  and  constructions  in
Montbau. Energy, economic, and CO2e emissions impact is assessed. In terms of the economic variable, existing aids
for renovation are not considered as they may vary over time and distort the final global values. Finally, values per
square meter of renovation of the envelopes were established, as well as their energy expenditure and the levels of CO2e
emissions that would occur by renovating the buildings (Fig. 34).

Three scenarios were set for the analysis of the increase in energy costs, which suggest an equilibrium between the
investment  in  the  renovation  of  facades  and  the  cost  in  their  use.  These  scenarios  foresee  a  percentage  of  annual
increase,  which  may  drastically  change,  subject  to  the  variable  operating  costs  and  the  scarcity  of  non-renewable
resources. The price of energy may vary due to demand, production, and availability of fossil fuel reserves, and that is
why said sensitivity scenarios have been established. It is difficult to establish its evolution, since several variables are
involved,  including  economic  crisis  -demand  decrease-,  taxes,  internal  conflicts  in  producing  countries,  natural
disasters,  discovery  of  new  reserves,  etc.  Likewise,  there  are  large  variations  between  the  forecast  of  fossil-fuel
depletion which, based on Hubert’s Peak Theory, establish a production peak and subsequent decline, a matter that
would impact consumption and prices will then fluctuate.

Therefore, costs can be easily overcome depending on the energy market, strongly influenced by an increasing fuel
consumption and reserves difficult to forecast. In 2012, there was an annual increase of 9%, in 2013 3.58%, and it was
expected, by the end of 2013, a possible increase of 11% in 2014 [30].  For this analysis,  three scenarios of energy
sensitivity are established, forecasting an increase in the cost of energy by 3%, 6% and 10% per year.

To develop the research, spreadsheets where prepared and the cost of renovation - energy kWh, CO2e and economic
costs in € for the year 2012- were included for the constructive solutions -T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade)-
using different insulation thickness -7, 10, 15, and 40 cm- and two types of window frames -wood and aluminum. For
the latter, maintenance costs were included taking into account the aforementioned variables, for periods of four-years
[30]

Also, this analysis attempts to demonstrate that energy renovation is useful to boost the construction industry and
reactivate  the  sustainable  economic  growth.  Therefore,  transforming  buildings  to  be  energy  efficient  will  help
consolidate  the  country's  prosperity  in  the  long  term  [31].

Improving energy emissions and economic performance will boost the cohesion and shared responsibility among
the various European countries, now that many of them are working specifically on that matter. Existing houses and
apartments are one of the largest energy consumers and CO2e. Therefore, the actions performed on the existing housing
developments -as outlined in this study- will define the energy performance of the housing development sector for the
decades to come [32].

Based on these data, we have analyzed the crossing point of the various construction options proposed, with their
corresponding structures and insulation thickness, before and after the intervention on the buildings. It is then necessary
to establish a selection parameter -CO2e emissions in this case- and their relationship with the three proposed economic
scenarios to obtain improvements that allow benefits to occur -energy, emissions, and economic benefits- depending on
the standard construction proposed, with the respective structure and insulation thickness.  The strategic point to be
analyzed  will  be  CO2e  emissions  because  of  the  implications  their  reduction  will  have,  which  exceed  the  purely
economic impacts at local level, to become a global issue.

A relationship between CO2e emissions and economic costs -3%, 6%, and 10% of annual accumulated difference-
will be established between non-renovated and renovated buildings. The values discussed are the difference between the
annual accumulated costs of the building before its renovation and the accumulated annual values of the building that
has already been renovated with the various proposed solutions, plus the economic cost and emissions resulting from
improvements made to the envelope.  The analysis will  be conducted starting in year zero -in which all  options are
identical- and the values will be negative -since an initial investment must be made to improve the envelope-, then in
year 25, medium term, and finally in year 50. In the latter case, positive or negative values can be obtained depending
on  the  balance  between  investment  costs  and  energy  consumption  when  the  envelope  has  been  already  improved
(EOTA- The European Organization for Technical Assessment-1999, establishes an estimated illustrative lifespan for
products, works, and constructions in which an estimated lifespan category is established for each work: Brief = 10
years, medium = 25 years, normal 50 years and long = 100 years. Those terms are the ones adopted for the periods of
this  study),  the  constructive  solutions  proposed  and  their  respective  thickness.  This  analysis  will  show  the  results
obtained for CO2e emissions in relation to economic costs, with both constructive solutions proposed, structure works
and more efficient insulation thickness for each one of the targeted buildings.

8.1. Block A Efficiency

Block  A  is  a  duplex  building.  In  all  the  three  time  points  established  -0,  25,  and  50  years-,  the  reduction  of
emissions is evident along with the economic costs over years 25 and 50 (Table 3 Block A Efficiency. CO2e emissions
and Economic Cost Reductions after Renovating the Skin of Block A Buildings, years 0-25-50).

The table shows the evolution -resulting from the difference between the building without any renovation and the
various renovation proposals- CO2e emissions, with the use of envelopes of various thickness for the years proposed
above, and the speculative energy price increase. Year 0 is identical for all the constructive proposals and economic
scenarios, because this is the year in which the investment has to be made to renew the facade.

The mid-term results year 25 using constructive solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade) with wooden
structures and 7 to 15 cm insulation thickness, show reduction values for CO2e emissions, being a little more elevated if
15 cm insulation thickness is used. In scenarios with differences of 3 and 6% in the cost of the stored energy, deficit
seems to occur. In the case of an alleged increase in the cost of energy by 10%, the graph shows, in year 25, a benefit
obtained from the investment made. (Table 3) Block A Efficiency. CO2e emissions and Economic Cost Reductions after
Renovating the Skin of Block A Buildings, years 0-25-50).

For year 50, it is evident that the use of solutions T1 or T2, with wooden structures and 15 cm insulation thickness,
would  achieve  a  better  relation  between  reducing  CO2e  emissions  and  recovering  investment.  In  the  three  alleged
economic scenarios, the recovery of investment is shown in the medium term.

Constructive solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade) using aluminum structures, show a high initial
investment in CO2e, which will be stabilized over time, but will always be higher than the results showed by the use of
wooden structures. The economic cost in this case will be very similar to the cost of using wooden structures and its
amortization will produce similar values between them.

A summary of the above analysis would consist in relating the building skin renovation investment and reducing
CO2e emissions over time -in this case, year 50-. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate the results obtained and relate them
to the angle occurring when point zero is joint to the studied point and the abscissa axis. The widest angle indicates the
optimal renovation choice and the narrowest angle indicates the most deficient choice. If both angles are known, then
the rest of the angles will give us guidance on the most feasible proposal.

For Block A (Table 4 Block A, Efficiency between Renovation Investment and Reduction of CO2e Emissions in
Year 50, and Figs. (35 and 36)), graphs show that the widest angle occurs using wooden structures with 7cm insulation
thickness in either of the constructive proposals. The narrowest angle is produced using aluminum structures with 40
cm insulation thickness in solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade).

The  most  efficient  point  between  investment  and  reduction  of  CO2e  emissions  is  proposal  T2,  using  wooden
structures and 7 cm insulation thickness to reduce emissions by 1,235,423 kg CO2e with an investment of €395,198.
Angles in proposal T2 (ventilated façade), with 7, 10 and 15 cm insulation thickness are very close, as shown in the
graphs (Fig. 37), in which 15 cm insulation thickness is to produce a greater reduction of CO2e emissions, but with a
slightly higher economic cost.

Block E-F is a linear block with 4 staircases and two apartments per floor. Year 0 is when renovation investment
occurs and investment shows deficit the renovation process will produce more emissions than the ones emitted in an
entire year. However, after that in the years to come, the reduction of emissions will be evident as well as the economic
cost (Table 5 Block E-F Efficiency. Reduction of CO2e emissions and economic costs after Renovating the skin of a

The table above shows the evolution of CO2e emissions, with the various insulation thicknesses for the years studied
and the three assessed energy increases. Year 0 is identical for all the constructive proposals and scenarios, since it is
the year in which investment is made to renovate the facade.

In  year  25,  using  wooden  structures  in  both  solutions  T1  (overlying)  and  T2  (ventilated  facade)  and  7  -15  cm
insulation  thickness,  CO2e  emissions  reductions  are  very  close  to  each  other,  with  the  highest  change  given  by
constructive solution T1 if 7 cm insulation thickness is used. The use of aluminum in both proposals, T1 (overlying)
and T2 (ventilated facade), show a wider gap between both proposals when using wooden structures, and even some
values  are  negative.  From  the  economic  point  of  view,  the  constructive  proposals  will  be  in  deficit,  saved  on  the
assumption of an annual increase of 10% in the accumulated price of energy.

For year 50, the table shows that by using wooden structures for solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade)
and 15 cm insulation thickness, a better relationship between the reduction in CO2e emissions and return on investment
would  be  achieved,  followed,  at  a  short  distance  by  the  same  type  of  solution  and  aluminum  structures  with  an
insulation thickness of 10 cm (Table 5 Block E-F Efficiency. Reduction of CO2e emissions and economic costs after
renovating the skin of a Block E-F building, Years 0-25-50.

Constructive solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade) using aluminum structures show a high initial
investment  in  CO2e  emissions,  which  is  gradually  balanced  over  time,  but  will  always  be  higher  than  the  results
provided after using wooden structures.

As in case A, we relate the investment in the renovation of the building skin and the reduction of CO2e emissions
over time -50 years.

In Block E-F (Table 6 Block E-F, Efficiency between investment in renovation € and CO2e emissions reduction for
year 50 and Figs. 38 and 39) the graphs show that the widest angle occurs when using wooden structures and 7 cm
insulation thickness in any of the constructive proposals. The narrowest angle occurs when using aluminum structures
with 40 cm insulation thickness in solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade).

The most efficient point between investment and reduction of CO2e emissions will be proposal T1 using wooden
structures and 7 cm insulation thickness to reduce CO2e emissions by 911.097 kg with an investment of 444,375€. The
angles of proposal T1 and proposal T2 with 7, 10 and 15 cm grades of are very close, as shown in the graphs (Figs. 38
and 39). Proposal T2 would get the maximum reduction of CO2e emissions with 941,270 kg but with a significantly
higher cost of 941,270 €.

8.3. Block Q Efficiency

Block Q is a ground floor tower with 14 floors and four apartments per floor. CO2e emissions in year 25 will be
reduced only by using wooden structures in both constructive proposals T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade). In
year 50, the two constructive solutions will provide positive results, although the proposals using aluminum structures
are  at  a  considerable  distance  from  the  rest  (Table  7  Block  Q  Efficiency.  CO2e  Emissions  and  Economic  Cost
Reductions after Renovating the skin of a Block Q Building, Years 0-25-50).

The table shows that in the medium term -year 25- when investment is yet to be returned, for all the constructive
solutions and insulation thickness, and with a difference in the accumulated annual energy costs in the 3%, 6%, and
10% proposed scenarios. This is so, because Q-type buildings, due to their constructive features -compact buildings
with a balanced ratio of solid parts and openings- show heating costs of 9,935€ without being intervened. In case of an
intervention  using  any  of  the  constructive  solutions,  either  wooden  or  aluminum structures,  with  15  cm insulation
thickness, the cost will be 4,678€ per year. Therefore, economic investment will require a longer time for repayment.

For year 50, it is evident that the use of solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade) with wooden structures
and 10-15 cm insulation thickness, would show a better relationship between reducing CO2e emissions and obtaining a
return on investment between 6% and 10% of the differences of annual cumulative energy costs.

As in previous cases, the investment in the renovation of the building skin and the reduction of CO2e emissions is
related over time -50 years.

For Block Q (Table 8 Block Q, Efficiency between Renovation Investment and Reduction of CO2e Emissions in
Year  50  and  Figs.  (39  and  40),  the  graphs  show  that  the  widest  angle  occurs  using  wooden  structures,  and  7cm
insulation thickness in either of the constructive proposals. The narrowest angle occurs using aluminum structures and
40 cm insulation thickness in solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade). For solution T1, emission reduction is
minimal.

The most efficient point between investment and CO2e emission reduction will be proposal T1-7 and T2-7 with
similar investment and reduction values -T1/7 428.668€ - 701.00 kg CO2e and T2/7 433.808€ - 701.357 kg CO2e. The
angles of the values between 7 and 15 cm insulation thickness using wooden structures are really close. The proposal
that reduces CO2e emissions the most is proposal T2, with 15 cm insulation thickness and a slightly higher cost.

8.4. Block UNI14 Efficiency

A UNI14 building contains 14 single-family attached houses, each one with three levels, which originally had a
level that was used as a workshop or production area, intended to render community services for the inhabitants of
Montbau.

CO2e emissions show negative results in the graph for years 25 and 50, using any of the constructive solutions, T1
(overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade), and aluminum structures and insulation of any thickness. Same thing happens if
wooden structures and insulation of any thickness are used for year 25, with constructive solution T2. For year 25,
making improvements in year 50, solution T1 will show positive results if wooden structures and 7-15 cm insulation
thickness are used, a proposal that would prove a greater beneficial impact in the medium and long terms. (Table 9
Block UNI14. Efficiency. CO2e Emissions and Economic Costs Reductions after Renovating the skin of a Block UNI14
Building, Years 0-25-50).

Negative results are caused by the high amount of envelope single-family houses have -the roof in this case-, which
would require a higher initial investment in relation to the volume and inner surface of the building.

economic costs will be negative in the medium term -year 25- in any of the scenarios in which the cost of energy is
increased and using any of the proposed solutions. The numbers will be positive for year 50 in increase scenarios of 6%
and 10% and constructive solutions T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade) using aluminum and wooden structures
and insulation of any thickness.

It is evident, for year 50, that by using solutions T1 (overlying) or T2 (ventilated facade), with wooden structures
and  10  cm insulation  thickness,  a  better  relationship  between  CO2e  emissions  reductions  and  return  on  investment
would be achieved.

In the case of single-family houses, lower emissions and costs reductions will occur if compared to the rest of the
buildings studied. The greatest amount of skin surface linked to a higher investment in renovation would produce more
accurate results.

As  in  the  previous  cases,  we  relate  investment  in  the  renovation  of  a  building  skin  and  the  reduction  of  CO2e
emissions over time -50 years-.

For  Block  UNI14  (Table  10  Block  UNI14.  Efficiency  Between  Renovation  Investment  and  CO2e  Emission
Reduction in Year 50 and Figs. 41 and 42), the graphs show that the widest angle point, therefore the most efficient,
occurs  when  using  wooden  structures  with  7  cm  insulation  thickness  for  proposal  T1  (overlying)  with  a  cost  of
163,814€ and CO2 emissions reduction of 187,113 kg. The graphs (Figs. 41 and 42) show negative angles indicating a
higher initial investment of CO2e emissions for materials used in the construction, than the benefits obtained in such
period.

Proposal  T1  (overlying)  produces  a  greater  reduction  in  CO2e  emissions  within  the  whole  set  with  a  minimum
investment difference if compared to the most efficient one which is 4,716€.

8.5. Efficient Renovation of Montbau

At this point, it is time to analyze the overall performance of the neighborhood of Montbau and its buildings. We
start  with  the  selection  of  the  most  efficient  solutions  and  extrapolate  the  remaining  buildings  per  square  meter,
studying their status in the medium term -year 25- and normal term year 50.

Depending  on  the  point  of  optimization,  the  constructive  solution  is  selected,  as  well  as  the  materials  for  the
structures and insulation thickness in order to establish optimal reduction rates for all the neighborhood.

The analysis of efficiency has led to propose more effective solutions for the conditions established in this studio.
For type A duplex buildings, the most efficient constructive solution is T2 (ventilated facade), using wood materials and
15 cm insulation thickness. The same constructive proposal is useful for Linear Blocks E-F and Q Towers. Finally, for
Block UNI14 or single-family houses, the most effective constructive solution would be solution T1 (Overlying) using
wooden materials and 10 cm insulation thickness.

The results for the four types of buildings will be extrapolated to the remaining buildings in Montbau, to get an
overall picture of what jointly acting would be like in this residential neighborhood.

We extract the values of heating energy consumption in kWh and CO2e emissions to choose the evolution in the cost
of energy from 6%, as it is an intermediate situation between cheap energy, 3%, and a significant increase of 10%. (See
Table  11  Montbau  -  like  buildings  with  no  renovation,  year  25,  and  Table  12.  Montbau-like  buildings  with  no
renovation, year 50)

In year 25, consumption would be 179,776,348 kWh, with CO2e emissions released into the atmosphere equivalent
to 49,498,919 kg and an energy cost, with 6% price increases, of 28,150,418€ in case 1,959 houses and apartments
within  an  area  of  160,406  m2  were  not  renovated.  If  we  do  the  exercise  for  year  50  -non-renovated  houses  and
apartments-  the  total  energy  consumption  would  be  335,603,543  kWh,  with  CO2e  emissions  released  into  the
atmosphere equivalent to 97,093,345 kg, and a cumulative energy cost of 146,925,283€. Accumulated consumption
values and emissions are doubled over time and economic costs are fivefold.

By Renovating with the optimal values estimated in this chapter -which include the necessary renovation energy,
gas emissions released into the atmosphere, and their economic cost in year 2012- the following results are obtained for
year  25:  energy  consumption  equal  to  106,051,437  kWh,  31,531,808  kg  of  CO2e  emissions,  and  a  price  increased
energy  cost  of  6%  equal  to  41,993,197€.  The  same  variables  for  the  year  50  are  157,999,235  kWh  in  energy
consumption, 46,743,719 kg of CO2e emissions, and a cost of 82,410,581€ in energy. Between one and the other date,

the increase in energy consumption and CO2e emissions is approximately 49%, and costs almost doubled between the
two dates.

The results summary table (Table 17 Overall summary of renovated and non-renovated buildings scenario in the
neighborhood of Montbau) shows that in the first 25 years, with the proposed improvements to buildings, reduction in
energy consumption is 41% and 36% in CO2e emissions. The cost of energy shows a deficit of 49% caused by the initial
investment in the renovation of facades. The economic value may vary, as already mentioned, depending on energy
prices. On the other hand, the energy consumption reduction values and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases far
exceed purely economic values.

When comparing the scenario in year 50, for non-renovated and renovated buildings, there is a decrease in energy
consumption of 53%, CO2e emission reductions of 52%, and a decrease in energy costs of 45%.

Renovating the envelope of buildings using an optimal solution between investment costs and results can lead to
reductions in consumption, emissions, and economic costs over 50% of consumption in non-renovated buildings. Usage
values are considerably reduced, but initial investment values impact the overall results. Overall results confirm the
need to act on the envelopes of the buildings and the benefits in the medium-term -year 25- and normal-term -year 50-.

CONCLUSION

The thermal envelop of a building is one of the main elements that can be modified in order to optimize energy
savings, CO2e emissions, and economic efficiency, in order to offer comfort to its inhabitants. Thermal losses through
the  envelop  of  buildings  suppose  energy waste,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  CO2e  emissions  and economic  costs,  as
consumption increases due to thermal systems overuse to compensate loses and, therefore, satisfy users’ needs, and
contributing to the sustainability of the city and the planet.

As a conclusion, consequences are pointed out depending on the type of materials used, the type of intervention
performed on the building envelop, the type and shape of the building, the construction option, its effectiveness, the
different  insulation  thickness  and  the  global  vision  of  the  renovation  of  the  buildings  in  the  neighborhood  and  the
possible consequences for our planet.

The current envelopes of the buildings in Montbau, do not meet the minimum comfort requirements set forth in the
current legislation, and to do so, a considerable amount of energy must be used, implying that CO2e emissions will be
released into the atmosphere and high economic costs will be caused. The type of buildings consuming the most are the
single-family houses –Block UNI14-, followed by duplex buildings -Block A-, linear blocks –Block E-F- and towers
–Block Q. Most compact buildings -Blocks Q and E-F- consume the least energy, followed by Block A and Block
UNI14.

Analysis and results allow concluding that there is a marked relationship between the amount of a building envelope
and a building useful surface in its internal part. The less external surface by a higher internal surface, the less energy
loses through the envelope that separates the building from the external environment. Therefore, single-family houses
will  have  the  highest  energy  transfer  to  the  exterior  due  to  a  greater  proportion  of  envelope,  followed  by  A-Type
buildings, duplex buildings, linear blocks, and towers.

Modifying the glazing and the structures that uphold the buildings, have none or poor impact on the reduction of

energy consumption and CO2e emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to act on the openings, since they can be treated
individually  in  single  houses  or  in  massive  buildings.  This  study  results  show  improvements  in  the  behavior  of
buildings when modifications are performed on the openings -between 8 and 16%-, which still proves to be inefficient.
The analysis shows that the use of specific insulation materials on the envelope, no matter the type of materials, may
produce improvements in the comfort of inhabitants, CO2e emissions, energy consumption and costs in the future. For
Barcelona, if the studied insulation materials are used, reductions between 34.9% (7cm insulation thickness for UNI14)
and 89% maximum (40 cm insulation thickness for Block E-F) are obtained. It is necessary to find the balance point for
the insulation thickness, since if thickness increases, it can result in a decreasing performance and savings with the first
centimeters are comparable to the performance obtained by doubling or tripling it.

Studies  allow  affirming  that  the  type  of  building  impacts  on  the  consumption  results  for  the  same  insulation
thickness used in different buildings. Linear Block E-F works better with a 7cm insulation thickness, improving in 76%
in comparison to its initial status; Block A, duplex apartments, shows improvements of up to 56%; Block A improves
up  to  48%,  and  UNI14  single-family  attached  houses  improve  up  to  35%.  Differences  are  caused  by  the  shape  of
buildings and the quantity of skin in contact with the external environment. Single-family houses are the least efficient
since they have a great amount of skin due to the space they occupy.

Both of the constructive solutions proposed fit the targeted buildings and therefore to all the buildings in Montbau.
Both proposals –T1 (overlying) and T2 (ventilated facade)- involve similar construction consumption, CO2e emissions,
and economic costs. Proposal T2 has a higher construction consumption, but lower CO2e emissions.

Regarding roofs, proposal T1 produces much less CO2e emissions when using gravel than proposal T2. Proposal T2
transforms roofs in a useful space, which is something that deserves attention in an architectonic project. Economic
costs are similar, although higher in Proposal T1 than in proposal T2.

Regarding openings, wooden structures are the best option, even if maintenance is necessary every four years. On
the other hand, aluminum structures do not require maintenance, although manufacturing costs are higher as well as
their energy consumption and CO2e emissions if compared to wooden structures.

Chosen constructive proposals act from the external part of the buildings. Renovating buildings from their external
part have various advantages. Costs in terms of displacement of inhabitants are not caused, the useful surface of houses
is not affected, waterproofing of buildings is improved, thermal bridges are reduced, and the general image of buildings
is improved.

Investment, in terms of energy (kWh) to renovate buildings plus energy use -reduced thanks to building renovation-
in comparison to the energy consumed when a building has not been renovated, is balanced within a prudent period of
time  (between  4  years,  as  a  minimum,  and  25  years,  as  a  maximum,  for  buildings  A,  E-F,  and  Q,  for  both  of  the
solutions proposed) taking into account insulation thickness and structures. Proposals that involve wooden structures
are optimized in a shorter term, between 4 and 10 years, due to the energy used in their manufacturing in comparison to
aluminum structures. Single-family houses -UNI14- need a longer period of time to be optimized, between 11 years –T1
(overlying)  with  7,  10  and  15  cm  insulation  thickness  and  wooden  structures-  and  a  maximum  of  46  years  –T2
(ventilated facade) with 40 cm insulation thickness and aluminum structures.

The  reduction  of  greenhouse  gases  emissions  (kg  of  CO2e)  runs  a  process  parallel  to  the  energy  consumption
process. Renovation investment costs in addition to use, in comparison to emissions by similar buildings that are not
renovated  are  optimized  between  5  and  30  years  as  a  maximum  for  buildings  A,  E-F  and  Q,  using  constructive
proposals T1 and T2 and the different insulation thickness and wooden structures. If aluminum structures are used,
optimization terms vary between 19 and 38 years. Single-family houses need a longer optimization term exceeding 50
years for proposals using aluminum structures. Constructive proposal T1 (overlying) using wooden structures and 7 - 15
cm insulation thickness are optimized between 17 and 22 years depending on thickness.

Three economic scenarios were established, suggesting annual increases in energy prices of 3, 6 and 10%. Said
scenarios  may flow in  several  ways,  although their  trend is  to  increase.  Considering the  results  of  the  study,  in  an
increase of 3% scenario, optimization would take place after 50 years; 30 and 40 years if increase is 6%, and between
21 and 30 years if increase is 10%.

The results of the analysis allow concluding that renovation extends the lifespan of buildings and, although benefits
are shown in the long-term graphs, energy costs will be one of the most important variables in all the cases.



Energy Renovation of Buildings the Skin The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, 2017, Volume 11   63

Efficiency relations between greenhouse gases emissions and the several economic cost scenarios lead us to choose
constructive options for each one of the types of buildings analyzed herein, which prove to be the most efficient ones
regarding the criteria established in the study. The most efficient proposal for duplex buildings -Block A-, linear blocks
-E-F buildings- and towers -Block Q- is T2 (ventilated facade), using wooden structures and 15 cm standard insulation.
For UNI14 single-family houses, the most appropriate proposal is T1 (overlying) with wooden structures and 10 cm
insulation thickness.

If these constructive proposals are extended to all the buildings in Montbau, and supposing an increase in energy
costs of 6%, energy consumption will decrease in 41% after 25 years, CO2e emissions will decrease in 36%, and there
will be a deficit of 49% in economic costs. After 50 years, consumption decreases to 53%, CO2e emissions decrease up
to 52%, and economic costs decrease in 45%.

The  data  above  confirms  that  intervening  the  current  envelop  of  the  buildings  in  Montbau  produce  energy,
environmental, and economic benefits. Renovating the skin of the existing buildings may be a major factor since energy
consumption is decreased, CO2e emissions also decrease, and comfort increases and contributes to the economic and
environmental equilibrium and regeneration of the planet.

Analysis allow concluding that there is a need to renovate the facades of the buildings in order to contribute to the
sustainability  of  the  environment  and face  the  crisis  of  our  planet  with  medium-term and long-term solutions.  The
analysis of the graphs allows evaluating important figures, in terms of CO2e emissions released into the atmosphere
produced by non-renovated buildings, energy consumption and costs. Figures show energy savings of up to 50% and
reduction of CO2e emissions released into the atmosphere by using the constructive solutions and insulation thickness
proposed, which were established taking into account their durability, effectiveness, and environmental management.

Also, recovering these buildings will allow the recovery of other spaces, rebuild social fabrics, and offer fair and
balanced habitability conditions for an optimal social development.
