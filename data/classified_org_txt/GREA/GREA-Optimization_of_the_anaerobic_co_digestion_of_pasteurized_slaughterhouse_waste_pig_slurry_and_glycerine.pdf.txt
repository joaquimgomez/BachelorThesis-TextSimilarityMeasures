1. Introduction 15 

The increasing demand of renewable energy sources and reuse of wastes require good 16 

technological solutions, following current European regulations and state member 17 

policies. Biogas is a form of renewable energy produced from biomass by the anaerobic 18 

digestion (AD) process. The biogas is used to produce electricity, heat or as transport 19 

fuel (De Vries et al., 2012). Main substrates for AD include agricultural biomass in the 20 

form of animal manures, energy crops (e.g. maize) and organic residues from the 21 

processing industry (e.g. glycerine, beet tails, animal wastes, fruit pulp wastes). The use 22 

of animal manure and other organic wastes as bioenergy feedstock would allow farmers 23 

to take profit of new economic markets for traditional waste products. Livestock waste-24 

to-bioenergy technologies, as AD, have the advantage to convert the treatment of 25 

livestock waste from a cost into a profit that can diversify farm incomes. 26 

Nonetheless of the interesting environmental advantages of the livestock waste 27 

treatment by AD, as the greenhouse gases emissions reductions, biogas production 28 

using only animal manure is not economically sustainable, and addition of biomass 29 

from other sources is needed (Møller et al., 2007). The livestock co-digestion with other 30 

organic waste sources, combined with good manure management practices, have shown 31 

an improvement in the economic feasibility in many individual or centralized agro-32 

biogas installations.  33 

The successful of the co-digestion strategies resides in the selection of co-substrates that 34 

must be showing complementary characteristics. Pig manure (PM) is characterized by a 35 

high buffer capacity and contains a wide variety of micro and macronutrients necessary 36 

for the growth and activity of anaerobic microorganisms, but shows high ammonium 37 

concentration and low organic matter content (Hartmann and Ahring, 2006). Several 38 

positive experiences have been described about the co-digestion of pig manure with 39 



 
 

complementary substrates as algae, food wastes or catch crops (Astals et al., 2015; 40 

Dennehy et al., 2016; Molinuevo-Salces et al., 2015).  41 

The co-substrates selection depends on their geographic availability in the area where 42 

the biogas plant is located, which, at the same time, is related with the kind of agro-food 43 

industry economy developed in this area. In the case of Catalonia, the meat sector is of 44 

great importance, being also one of the top five industries in Spain (Blancafort, 2009). 45 

This sector generates large quantities of materials not intended for human consumption, 46 

so called animal by-products (ABP). Besides animal food or meat and bone meal 47 

production, AD is one of the allowed methods to valorise these products (European 48 

Community, 2009 and 2011). Due to their composition, mainly composed by proteins 49 

and lipids with variable water content (Rodriguez-Abalde et al., 2011), ABP are 50 

considered good substrates for the AD process, according to the high methane yield 51 

potential. Although inhibitory processes could take place because of the combined 52 

release of ammonia due to protein decomposition and long chain fatty acids (LCFA) 53 

coming from fat degradation (Wang et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2008). ABP co-digestion 54 

strategy could reduce inhibition phenomena, and allows the progressive acclimatization 55 

of the bacteria to specific inhibitors such as ammonia (Edström et al., 2003) and/or 56 

LCFA (Silvestre et al., 2011), thus facilitating the control of the anaerobic process.  57 

In the last decade, other organic substrate, generated in huge quantities, is the recovered 58 

glycerine (RG) generated as by-product of the biodiesel manufacturing industry. The 59 

biodiesel production in the European Union has increased from 500,000 tons in 1998 to 60 

9,000,000 tons in 2009 (EBB, 2010). Each tone of biodiesel generates 0.1 tone of RG. 61 

The RG contains different components (alcohols, water, inorganic salts, free fatty acids, 62 

un-reacted triglycerides and methyl esters) that required removal from the RG before 63 

used as a raw material for alimentary, cosmetic or drug industry. The purification step 64 



 
 

might be economically unfeasible for most biodiesel plants, being their energy 65 

valorisation by AD an attractive option (Castrillon et al., 2011, Fountoulakis et al., 66 

2010). Since glycerine is characterized by low nitrogen content and high organic matter 67 

concentration, the co-digestion with rich nitrogen organic waste, as the PM or ABP 68 

wastes, could be an adequate strategy to limit the risk of organic overloading of their 69 

anaerobic mono-digestion (Astals et al., 2012; Robra et al., 2010). 70 

Most studies about co-digestion are based in the use of two substrates, although there 71 

are several experiences with ternary mixtures such as tomato residues with corn stover 72 

and dairy manure (Li et al., 2016), manure with food waste and sewage sludge in a 73 

proportion of 70:20:10 (Marañon et al., 2012) or cattle manure and food waste 74 

supplemented with crude glycerine (Castrillón et al., 2013). As an innovation aspect of 75 

this study, the results of ternary mixture co-digestion using pig manure, slaughterhouse 76 

and recovered glycerine are shown. The tertiary mixtures analysed have been designed 77 

based on the C/N ratio.  78 

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of adding recovered glycerine from 79 

biodiesel manufacturing during the continuous co-digestion of pig manure and 80 

slaughterhouse waste as strategy to balance the C/N ratio. The study includes the 81 

analysis of the effect of binary and tertiary mixtures on the biogas productivity and the 82 

stability of the process in terms of intermediary compounds as the volatile fatty acids 83 

and ammonia.  84 

2. Material and methods 85 

2.1. Wastes & inocula 86 

PM was collected from a centralized manure treatment facility located in Lleida (Spain). 87 

Fourteen fresh manure samples were collected (approximately every 3 months) and 88 

characterized, in order to account the temporal variability (seasonal fluctuations, 89 



 
 

changes in pig slurry management, etc.). The first sample was used for batch tests, 90 

while all samples were characterized and used as feedstock for the continuous AD 91 

experiment.  92 

Slaughterhouse waste (ABP) came from a pig slaughterhouse facility located in 93 

Barcelona (Spain). They consisted of a mixture of internal organs (kidney, lungs, livers 94 

and hearts, reproductive organs and fatty fractions), all classified as ABP type 3 95 

(European Community, 2009 and 2011). All fractions were minced using an industrial 96 

mincer till a particle size of 4 mm, mixed and pasteurized at 70 ºC during 60 minutes, 97 

following European ABP regulations (European Community, 2009 and 2011). The 98 

pasteurization was done in a high pressure and temperature autoclave (Iberfluid 99 

Instruments, Spain). Three pasteurized ABP (PP-ABP) were used along the 100 

experiments: one for characterization and batch tests (BMP) and other two as feedstock 101 

of the digester.  102 

Enough quantity of RG was collected once from the glycerol-containing waste 103 

discharge of a biodiesel factory located in Barcelona (Spain) and used for 104 

characterization, batch tests and feedstock of the digester. All materials, PP-ABP, PM 105 

and RG, were frozen till being used. 106 

The inoculum used in the batch test corresponds with the anaerobic sludge sampled in a 107 

wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in Barcelona. The inoculum used in the 108 

continuous experiment was a mixture (ratio 4:1, expressed as % volume) of digested 109 

sewage sludge, collected in the same WWTP as the inoculum for batch experiment, and 110 

the effluent of a mesophilic pig manure anaerobic digester (Lleida, Spain). 111 

2.2. Analytical methods 112 

Usual parameters were measured according to Standard Methods (APHA, AWA, 113 

WEF, 2005): total and volatile solids (TS, VS), pH, alkalinity ratio (AR), total 114 



 
 

Kjeldhal nitrogen (TKN), total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) and sulphate (SO4
2-

S). 115 

Total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) were determined by elemental analysis 116 

(Leco, USA). Total chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined by a modified 117 

Standard Methods procedure (Noguerol-Arias et al., 2012). Free ammonia (FAN) 118 

content was calculated using the formula given by Hansen et al. (1998). Proteins 119 

were calculated by multiplying the organic nitrogen by 6.25 gprotein g
-1

Norgfactor 120 

(Gelegenis et al., 2007). The fat content was analysed following recommendations of 121 

n-hexane extractable material for sludge, sediment and solid samples method of EPA 122 

(2005). Volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, i-butyric, n-butyric, i-valeric, n-valeric, 123 

i-caproic and n-caproic acids) were determined by gas chromatography (VARIAN 124 

CO-300) with a flame ionisation detector (FID) and a capillary column (TRB-FFAP 125 

de 30m x 0.32m x 0.25 µm). The carrier gas was helium (2 ml·min
-1

). Biogas 126 

composition (CH4/ CO2) was determined by gas chromatography. The CH4 and CO2 127 

were determinate with a packed column (Varian Haysep-Q 80-100 MESH 2mm x 128 

1/8´´x 2 mm SS). The carrier gas was helium (2 ml·min
-1

). The injector and column 129 

temperature were 250 °C and 105 °C respectively. 130 

2.3. Biochemical methane potential tests 131 

The mesophilic anaerobic biodegradability (AB), expressed as a percentage of the total 132 

COD and calculated according to Soto et al., (1993), of every waste was determined by 133 

triplicate through biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. Glass vials of 1.2 l were 134 

filled with 0.5 kg of a solution composed by the inoculum (5 gVSS·l
-1

), the substrate 135 

(initial concentration of 5 gCOD·l
-1

), macronutrient solutions (NH4Cl, HPO4K2, MgSO4, 136 

MgCl2), micronutrient solution (H3BO3, ZnCl2, CuCl2, MnCl2, (NH4)6Mo7O2, CoCl2, 137 

NiCl2, EDTA, HCl, NaSeO3, resazurine) and bicarbonate (1 gNaHCO3·gCOD
-1

) as a buffer. 138 

The vials were kept at 35 ºC and were continuously shaken at 100 rpm during 30 days 139 



 
 

of experimental time. Samples of gas from the headspace were taken periodically and 140 

measured by gas chromatography. Net methane volume, or total accumulated methane 141 

from vials minus the total accumulated methane from blanks, was used to calculate the 142 

maximum methane yields. All the cumulative methane yields were expressed under 143 

normal conditions (0ºC, 1 atm). Methane production and VFA concentration were 144 

expressed in COD equivalents, using the equivalence factors suggested by Angelidaki et 145 

al. (2009).  146 

2.4. Lab-scale digester set up 147 

A 6 l semi-continuous stirred reactor tank was operated at 36±1 ºC for 70 weeks (490 148 

days). The content of digester was continuously mixed using a mechanical stirrer. The 149 

temperature was maintained by recirculation of water through the double glass jacket of 150 

the tank.  The digester was fed 4 times per day using a peristaltic pump and a 151 

temporized control system. The constant volume inside the digester was maintained 152 

using an overflow system. The biogas flow was measured by a displacement flowmeter 153 

(Ritter, Germany), after a silica bed to retain water vapour and a filter to avoid particles 154 

in the gas. The digester inlet and outlet flows, biogas flow and temperature were 155 

monitored daily, while main parameters (pH, AR, COD and VS concentration, N related 156 

compounds, VFA and biogas composition) were measured twice a week. All parameters 157 

were expressed as a weekly average. 158 

The hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the organic loading rate (OLR) values were 159 

chosen since they are the design values of anaerobic digesters in centralized manure 160 

treatment facilities in Spain (Flotats et al., 2009). Based on industrial plant operation, 161 

the HRT was set in 20 or 33 days. The OLR was 0.8 kgCOD·m
-3

·d
-1 

along the acclimation 162 

period (P1) and between 2.2-3.2 kgCOD·m
-3

·d
-1

 for the others periods. The performance 163 



 
 

was divided in 3 stages based on feed composition, and in 5 periods based on HRT and 164 

OLR values. 165 

For each period, the stability of the system was evaluated based on control parameters 166 

as specific methane yield (Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

 and Nm
3
CH4·t

-1
), specific methane production 167 

rate (Nm
3

CH4·m
-3·

d
-1

), COD removal efficiency, methane content of the biogas, and 168 

VFA-related indicators. For that purpose taking into account the corresponding 169 

disturbance (change in feed composition), a “stable” system is defined as that with the ≥ 170 

methane production rate, methane yield and COD removal than in the reference 171 

condition, and when the alkalinity ratio and the propionic/acetic ratios are ≥0.4 172 

(Callaghan et al., 2002) and ≥1.4 (Karthikeyan et al., 2016).  173 

3. Results and discussion  174 

3.1. Characterization of organic substrates  175 

Table 1 shows the characterization of each waste, both for the initial samples used for 176 

batch tests and the samples used during the continuous experiments (14 and 3 samples 177 

of PM and PP-ABP, respectively). The PM showed similar characteristics along the 178 

experimentation. This fact is usual in agro-digesters due to the similar management 179 

practices at farm scale. Regarding the PP-ABP, the characterization was similar in the 180 

three analysed samples.  181 

RG and PP-ABP were characterized by high COD content (1,517 and 1,318 gCOD·kg
-1

 182 

respectively) in comparison with the PM (45 gCOD·kg
-1

). The TS concentration showed 183 

great differences among the three substrates, being particularly low in PM, reason why 184 

this substrate was very suited as dilution media for the mixtures.  185 

PP-ABP showed high TKN concentration, in accordance with their high TS 186 

concentration, being the 90% in form of organic nitrogen. The PM showed lower TKN 187 

and the 80% was in form of TAN concentration. The TKN concentration is in 188 



 
 

accordance with the proteins concentration that is a predominant compound in the PP-189 

ABP (110.6 g·kg
-1

), while the PM showed low concentration and the proteins content is 190 

almost inexistent in RG. This glycerine was the unique waste with a relevant quantity of 191 

sulphates (1.7 g·kg
-1

). PP-ABP are also characterized by high fat concentration (363.4 192 

g·kg
-1

), corresponding with the 50% of the VS. This high fat concentration makes ABP 193 

extremely prone to failure due to production of inhibitory compounds such as LCFA 194 

(Bayr et al., 2012). Firstly, lipids are hydrolysed to LCFA, which are oxidized to acetate 195 

and hydrogen through the β-oxidation pathway (Cirne et al., 2007; Mata-Alvarez, 196 

2003). Inhibitory concentrations of individual LCFA vary depending on the fatty acid. 197 

Digesting anaerobically poultry slaughterhouse wastes and pig slaughterhouse waste 198 

with manure, LCFA were speculated to be the reason for process failure (Cuetos et al., 199 

2010; Hejnfelt and Angelidaki, 2009).  200 

The anaerobic biodegradability of PM, PP-ABP and RG was 41, 94 and 65 %COD 201 

respectively (Table 1). The PM had a maximum methane yield of 0.2 Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

, 202 

which was lower than 0.3-0.5 Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

, the reported range in the literature for 203 

swine manure (Bernet and Béline, 2009; Grebrezgabher et al., 2010; Burton and Turner, 204 

2003; Møller et al., 2004). The BMP of PM has a strong variability due to the presence 205 

of slowly biodegradable lignocellulosic materials (Møller et al., 2004), as well as 206 

because of the previous biodegradation of organic matter during manure storage 207 

(Rodriguez and Lomas, 2002). PP-ABP had a maximum methane potential yield of 0.9 208 

Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

, which was higher than 0.23 - 0.62 Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

 (Hejnfelt and 209 

Angelidaki, 2009), due to different fat and water contents. The obtained methane yield 210 

of RG was 202 Nm
3

CH4·t
-1

, which is lower than the theoretical value of 1295 Nm
3

CH4·t
-1

 211 

for pure glycerine (Amon et al., 2006) but relatively close to 217 - 308 Nm
3

CH4·t
-1

, the 212 

reported potentials of glycerol fractions recovered by phosphate acidification or 213 



 
 

distillation processes (Siles et al., 2009). The presence of impurities (water, methyl 214 

ester, methanol, etc.) and inorganic salts (sulphate, phosphate, soda, etc.) depends very 215 

much on the biodiesel and/or glycerol recovery processes, being ultimately responsible 216 

for the decrease in methane yield as compared to pure glycerine. 217 

Figure 1 shows the accumulated methane curves of the three wastes (PM, PP-ABP and 218 

RG). No lag phase was reported for PM and RG, but a lag-phase of seven days was 219 

observed during the PP-ABP test with a sharply increase of methane production. This 220 

behaviour could be related with the high concentration of fat (363.4 g·kg
-1

) and LCFA 221 

(not determined), since an inhibition due to accumulated TAN or VFA was not 222 

observed. Silvestre et al., (2011) also observed that the long lag-phase observed during 223 

anaerobic digestion of trapped grease waste could be attributable to an adaptation or 224 

inhibition period for the microorganisms due to the high fat concentration. 225 

3.2. Reactor performance  226 

The PP-ABP, PM and RG were chosen because of their complementary composition, 227 

especially in relation to C/N ratio that showed wide range among the three substrates: 228 

PM had the lowest C/N ratio (5.7-5.3) and RG had the highest value (587.5), being PP-229 

ABP in-between (14.1 - 15.7).  Therefore, co-digestion mixtures were used stepwise to 230 

balance the C/N ratio of the inlet flow to optimize the AD process, trying to be as close 231 

as possible to the optimal range (15-30). Although the optimum C/N range has 232 

commonly been reported for an efficient use of nutrients and maximum methane yield 233 

in anaerobic digesters (Mshandete et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2010), lower C/N ratios have 234 

also been suggested as optimal, particularly, in the anaerobic digestion of swine manure. 235 

In an early study, Sievers and Brune (1978) revealed that the optimal C/N range for 236 

swine manure digestion was 15-19 in terms of maximum methane production.  237 



 
 

During the first step, the reactor feed content was only PM as substrate (P1); values 238 

from this period were used as reference in terms of increment/ decrement of methane 239 

yield or organic matter removal efficiency. In the second step (periods P2 and P3), two 240 

different PM:PP-ABP mixtures were assessed, being PP-ABP the 7% and 36% inlet-VS 241 

in P2 and P3, respectively. Finally, the co-digestion of two ternary mixtures (PM:PP-242 

ABP:RG) was assessed in the third step. Mean values of operational and control 243 

parameters per period, as well as the ratio between theoretical methane potential of each 244 

period and the experimental yield (named as α), are shown in Table 2. The evolution of 245 

the operational parameters (HRT and OLR) and specific methane production rate 246 

through the different periods are shown in Figures 2 and 3a, respectively.  247 

The first step and period (P1), with a feed composed by lonely PM with a C/N of 6.3, 248 

was performed with 21 days of HRT and an OLR of 0.8 kgCOD·m
-3

d
-1

. The methane 249 

production rate (Figure 3a), the methane yield and the methane production per ton of 250 

fresh matter were 0.22 Nm

·d

, 0.15 Nm

CH4·kgSV

 and 3.6 Nm

, 251 

respectively. The methane composition was 65 % v/v. The TAN concentration (Figure 252 

3b) was in the range of the optimal anaerobic digestion process, much lower than values 253 

assumed as inhibitory (Yenigün and Demirel, 2013; Chen et al., 2008), with a FAN 254 

level also below the inhibitory concentration of 0.45–1.1 gFAN·l
-1

 reported in the 255 

literature (Angelidaki and Ahring, 1994; Hansen et al., 1998; Kayhanian, 1999).  256 

VFA were used in this work as indicator for impending reactor failure. Different 257 

indexes have been suggested as the most appropriate indicators for imbalance between 258 

involved microbial groups: the content of propionic and/or branched-chain VFA (i-259 

butyric and i-valeric acids), or some ratios as the propionic to acetic or the VFA to total 260 

alkalinity ratio are usually mentioned in previous works (Franke-Whittle at al., 2014; 261 

Aymerich et al., 2013; Bruni et al., 2013). In this regard, the alkalinity ratio in P1 was 262 



 
 

below 0.4 (Figure 4a), or reference threshold (Callaghan et al., 2002), and the total VFA 263 

concentration in P1 was 0.3 g·l
-1

, indicating a stable performance. The acetic acid was 264 

the main VFA (> 50 % total VFA) during this initial step. Isoforms of butyric acid and 265 

valeric acid, which usually are related to certain degree of unbalance in acetic 266 

production versus consumption rates (Aymerich et al., 2013), were found in minor 267 

quantities of 5% and 6% total VFA in this period (Figure 4b). 268 

The second step had two PM:PP-ABP mixtures with a C/N of 6.1 and 5.9 was divided 269 

in two periods, P2 and P3. In the P2, the OLR was increased from 0.8 till 3.0 kgCOD·m
-

270

 and consequently, the methane production rate, the methane yield and the methane 271 

production per ton rose to 0.47 Nm

(representing an increment of +114%), 272 

0.35 Nm
3

CH4·kgSV
-1

 and 9.7 Nm
3
CH4·t

-1
, respectively. Although the VFA concentration, 273 

mainly the acetic acid, increased to values close to 2 g·l
-1

 (Table 2) and the TAN and 274 

FAN concentrations increased to 2.95 and 0.33 gN·l
-1

, respectively (Figure 3b), the 275 

system was considered stable due to the constant gas production along time. The CH4 276 

content also increased from 65% to 73% v/v. This general increment of control 277 

parameters was related to the higher lipid concentration of the feeding mixture, 278 

following previous works as Silvestre et al., (2011) who observed adaptation of the 279 

anaerobic biomass and an increase in the methane yield, after the addition of grease to 280 

the sewage sludge AD. Although the increment of the concentration of total VFA in the 281 

reactor, the concentration of i-butyric, n-butyric and i-valeric acids were slightly similar 282 

as in P1 but showing a relative distribution in P2 lower than in P1 (Figure 4b).   283 

In period P3, the HRT was increased to 33 days to prevent a potential inhibition by 284 

TAN or LCFA due to the increment of PP-ABP percentage in the feeding mixture, since 285 

higher HRT than 20 days might facilitate the biomass adaptation in manure anaerobic 286 

digesters (Murto et al., 2004; Salminen and Rintala, 2002). The OLR applied in this 287 



 
 

period was reduced to 2.6 kgCOD·m
-3

·d
-1

 and, in accordance, the methane production rate 288 

decreased regarding P2. Nevertheless, the methane yield increased from 0.35 until 0.43 289 

m
3
·kgVS

-1 
and the methane production per ton achieved was 13.6 Nm

3
CH4·t

-1
. Once 290 

again, the system reached a stable performance: the methanogenesis was not affected by 291 

the VFA concentration, since the system was correctly buffered as the alkalinity ratio 292 

showed (< 0.4), while the CH4 content and yields, TAN and FAN levels were similar to 293 

the values obtained in the P2. The content of acetic acid increased but the VFA profile 294 

was almost similar to P2 (Figure 4b). Moreover, the decrement of valeric acid isoforms 295 

(4-5% and ≤1 % total VFA in P2 and P3, respectively), which are usually related with 296 

delayed or incomplete protein degradation (Bruni et al., 2013), was shown along this 297 

step. In this sense, this indicated that the system evolved to a more balance substrate 298 

degradation. 299 

In fact, the methane yield at the end of the second step (0.43 Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

) was higher 300 

than previously reported values of 0.27 - 0.35 Nm
3

CH4·kgVS

 during the co-digestion of 301 

slaughterhouse waste with pig manure and fruits (Álvarez and Liden, 2008) or 0.38 - 302

 with sewage sludge (Luste and Luostarinen, 2010). Another 303 

positive effect observed in this second step was a synergy effect over methane 304 

production measured through the α index (Table 2): methane production in P2 and P3 305 

was 1.4 and 1.0 times, respectively, the theoretical value calculated considering the 306 

maximum methane potential obtained with batch tests. 307 

Ternary mixtures were tested in the third step, being co-substrates up to 16 and 18 308 

%inlet-VS in periods P4 and P5, respectively. Therefore, the OLR and C/N ratio were 309 

increased to 2.5 and 3.2 kgCOD·m
-3

d
-1

, and to 8 and 10 (Figure 3a) in P4 and P5, 310 

respectively. A clear change in the total VFA content, equivalent to 4.2% of the outlet-311 

COD, and profile was found. The highest propionic/acetic ratio was attained in this 312 



 
 

period, but the mean value per period was below 1.4 or value reported as inhibitory ratio 313 

(Karthikeyan et al., 2016). The acetic and propionic acids were the main VFA, while i-314 

butyric and i-valeric acids almost disappeared (Figure 4b). Both methane yield and 315 

production rate improved in +23% and +11% in P4 with respect to P3, reaching a COD 316 

removal efficiency of 51%. Related to the pig manure period or P1, the achieved 317 

methane yield and the methane production per ton, increased +153% and +344% in P4, 318 

respectively.  319 

Finally, in period P5, the system recovered a low concentration of VFA (1.9% outlet-320 

COD in Table 2), very similar to initial periods but with a similar profile to P4. An 321 

improved COD removal efficiency of 55% also pointed out such balanced situation in 322 

P5. The propionic/acetic ratio clearly decreased (Figure 4a) and minority VFA, as lineal 323 

and branched butyric and valeric acids, were not detected. Consequently, the occurrence 324 

of an imbalance between the different bacterial groups of acidogens and acetogens 325 

which might take place in the co-digestion of PM:PP-ABP blends were prevented with 326 

this tertiary mixture. 327 

Regarding AD systems and RG, Mata-Alvarez et al., (2000) and Rétfalvi et al., (2011) 328 

found high amounts of VFA that were released rapidly to the medium, while the 329 

inhibitory effect on methanogenesis of propionic acid with concentrations in-between 1-330 

6 g·l
-1 

after intermittently glycerine additions. Angelidaki et al., (1998) assumed that 331 

glycerol biodegradation to propionate took place instantly, similarly to Fountoulakis et 332 

al., (2010) who observed that glycerol biodegradation took place at a faster rate than 333 

that of propionate, and suggested that a glycerol overload was responsible of an 334 

increased propionate concentration in the reactor. In this work, a maximum dose of 18% 335 

inlet-VS was reached without failure, while Amon et al., (2006) found that glycerine 336 

addition higher than 8-15 % inlet-VS caused a decrement on biogas and methane yields 337 



 
 

in pig manure and maize silage co-digestion systems. These authors obtained an 338 

increment of +19 % in methane yield (from 0.57 to 0.68 Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

) when glycerine 339 

was 6 % inlet-VS.  340 

The buffer capacity of the digester was found to be a key aspect to overcome the 341 

accumulation of VFA after glycerine addition: in parallel with the propionic acid 342 

accumulation, the highest values of pH (7.8-8.0) and alkalinity ratio (0.24) were reached 343 

in P5. Although total alkalinity content decreased (Table 2) due the reduced quantity of 344 

PM in the tertiary mixture, there was enough buffer capacity despite ammonia 345 

concentration in periods P4 and P5 was lower than in the previous periods (Figure 3b). 346 

This alkalinity ratio is consistent with other works that reported buffer capacity changes 347 

due to the accumulation of inorganic salts in the digester (Siles et al., 2009).  348 

Regarding synergism of tested tertiary mixtures, no effects were observed since α index 349 

was 0.7 in both periods P4 and P5 (Table 2). This result was contrary to Fountoulakis et 350 

al., (2010) who concluded that the growth of active biomass was enhanced after crude 351 

glycerol addition at 1 % v/v in sewage sludge co-digestion digesters that also might 352 

increase the CH4 production above the expected theoretical value. Opposite to this, 353 

Silvestre et al., (2015) stated, after studying the addition of crude glycerine to sewage 354 

sludge, that the added quantity of glycerine is highly dependent on the characteristics of 355 

the main waste. Although this, the system was considered stable since methane yield did 356 

not decrease (0.38 Nm
3

CH4·kgVS
-1

). Based on these results, synergism and stability not 357 

always appear together; additionally, the methane production per ton of fresh matter 358 

achieved the highest value (18.7 Nm
3

CH4·t
-1

) in this last period.  359 

 360 



 
 

4. Conclusions  361 

A continuous experiment of 490 days for the co-digestion in mesophilic conditions of 362 

binary and tertiary blends of PM, PP-ABP and RG was performed successfully. A slow 363 

stepwise increment of C/N ratio from 6 (PM alone) to 8-10 (tertiary blends) enhanced 364 

the methane yield and production rate, without process failure. The best methane 365 

production rate were obtained upon a glycerine addition of 16% inlet-VS in period P5, 366 

reaching 0.64 Nm
3

CH4·m

·d
-1

 or 2.9-fold the initial one (0.22 Nm
3

CH4·m

 with PM 367 

solely). Such improvement was not explained because an activity enhancement or 368 

synergism effect, but because of a more balanced degradation process due to unstressed 369 

bacterial populations, as the VFA-related indicators showed through the performance, 370 

due to the applied C/N adjustment. The buffer capacity of the system while digesting 371 

tertiary blends also played an important role to overcome imbalance. Such situation was 372 

also reflected in the high specific methane yield attained especially in P6 with 18.7 373 

Nm
3

CH4·t
-1

, that represented an increment of +414% regarding the period run with pig 374 

manure alone (3.6 Nm
3

CH4·t
-1

). So, the co-digestion of tertiary blends of pasteurized 375 

animal by-products with pig manure and glycerine resulted in a feasible method of 376 

stabilization and valorisation of ABP, based on the improved organic matter 377 

degradation, stress indicators and gas productivity. Finally, owing the α index value 378 

obtained and the increasing propionic to acetic ratio in the co-digestion of the tertiary 379 

mixture, further works should be addressed to study the performance of the reactor at 380 

higher retention times, in order to increase methane production, biomass adaptation and 381 

stability. 382

HIGHLIGHTS 

 A stepwise C/N ratio increase was proposed as optimization strategy. 

 Animal by-products binary blends led to synergic effect on methane production 

yield. 

 A ternary co-digestion mixture with glycerin as a carbon source was proposed. 

 Glycerin was a profitable co-substrate if enough buffer capacity was kept.
