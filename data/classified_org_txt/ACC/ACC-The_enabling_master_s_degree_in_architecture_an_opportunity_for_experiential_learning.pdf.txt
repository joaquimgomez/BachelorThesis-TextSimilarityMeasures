Resumen

Schools of architecture have recently converted the former Final Degree Project into a one-year ‘enabling’ master’s degree. This is a collateral 
effect of adapting Spanish university studies to the European legislative framework. Faced with this challenge, the Escola Tècnica Superior 
d’Arquitectura del Vallès (ETSAV) proposed the implementation of a teaching model that would allow students to learn based on the experience 
of interaction with ‘the people’ and construction experimentation. On a methodological level, the article reviews the theoretical basis related to 
this model based on the condition of an open process, physical experimentation and social return. It also makes a critical approach of the three 
first years of the master’s degree to identify and review the teaching tools implemented, the subjects being researched and the contradictions 
that emerge. It concludes by evaluating the results obtained and identifying the need to balance learning between psychosocial competences 
and construction and technological competences, representing the main challenge and potential complexity of the service-learning projects 
conducted by the ETSAV’s ‘enabling’ master’s degree.

Abstract

Las escuelas de arquitectura han convertido recientemente el antiguo Proyecto Final de Carrera en un Máster ‘habilitante’ de un año de du-
ración; un efecto colateral de la adecuación de los estudios universitarios españoles al marco legislativo europeo. Ante este reto, la Escuela 
Técnica Superior de Arquitectura del Vallés (ETSAV) planteó implementar un modelo docente que permitiera un aprendizaje desde la expe-
riencia de la interacción con ‘la gente’ y la experimentación constructiva. A nivel metodológico, el artículo revisa la base teórica relacionada 
con este modelo basado en la condición de proceso abierto, de experimentación física y de retorno social. Además desarrolla un recorrido 
crítico por los tres primeros años de funcionamiento para identificar y revisar las herramientas docentes implementadas, los temas objeto de 
investigación y las propias contradicciones emergentes. Se concluye evaluando los resultados conseguidos e identificando la necesidad de 
equilibrar los aprendizajes entre competencias psicosociales y competencias constructivo-tecnológicas, principal reto y complejidad potencial 
de los proyectos de aprendizaje-servicio conducidos por el máster ‘habilitante’ de la ETSAV.

Introduction 

The conversion of the curriculums of Spanish schools of architecture, following the 

guidelines of Ministerial Order EDU/2075/2010,1 which lays down the requirements 

for the verification of official university qualifications that enable the profession of 

architect to be practised, as well as compliance with European Directive 2005/36/

EC2 and Royal Decree 1393/20073 on the organisation of official university 

education, has led to the former Final Degree Project (Proyecto Fin de Carrera, 

or PFC, in Spanish) being converted into a one-year master’s degree. The unitary 

nature of a master’s degree, separate from the graduate degree, the maturity of the 

student body and the fact that it offers a whole year to carry out a project offers 

schools the opportunity to design a teaching activity that builds genuine bridges 

between the academic world and the professional sphere.

This opportunity has inspired the creation of the Master’s in Architecture (MArq) 

from the Escola Tècnica Superior d’Arquitectura del Vallès (ETSAV) that sets out 

enabling as an opportunity to experience the meaning of ‘responsibility’. The MArq, 

which began in September 2015, has already run 6 one-year courses that co-

rrespond to 6 collaborations with city halls that have offered their territory for the 

experiment. Always based on real case studies, the master’s degree offers prac-

tical experience based on the service-learning condition, and participatory action 

research methodology. The responsibility is transferred to the student body, which 

verifies, corrects, modifies and adapts projects to the vicissitudes of residents, 

municipal technicians and social actors in order to come up with an ‘executable 

product’ that, in some cases, is built. Research and interaction, either from the 

social and community dimension or from constructive experimentation, make up 

the two main aims of the master’s degree. The reasons that justify these aims lie in 

ensuring, through action, design mechanisms that can be a reference and influen-

ce for the future professional practice of graduate students, a profession that invites 

us to explore the many facets and functions that architects may exercise. The good 

results of the school based on experiencial learning back up this programme, as 

does the commitment to the emerging challenges posed by the ETSAV’s educa-

tional project.

Teaching supported by research and interaction

Teachers like Marina Garcés point out that the success of learning is demonstrated 

outside of the class since it is exactly on the ‘outside’ where we find “everything 

that remains to be thought, the wishes ignited by what we have started learning, 

the echo of restless words, unresolved problems and, above all, the relationship 

between all forms of learning with life, one’s own and that of the collective”.4 A 

sense of restlessness to continue learning ‘outside of the class’ is therefore the best 

indicator that evaluates the quality of the work done at the school. And restlessness 

goes hand-in-hand with challenges, since knowing how to transmit the doubts 

entailed by the challenges faced by the modern architectural profession was one 

of the ETSAV’s main intentions when it came to designing this ‘enabling’ master’s 

degree.

It seemed interesting to move students away from a purely professional, 

documentary and instrumental form of learning, to instead place them before the 

decision of ‘how to do something’, and train them to formulate the right questions 

when faced with a problem, or a challenge, which they themselves would identify 

and ask. Root learning needed one essential ingredient, reality, and to be built on 

two basic and complementary teaching activities: research and interaction with 

different subjects. So this is how the master’s degree was proposed, not with

the sole aim of completing a PFC, but as the result of an approach that ranges 

from questions, concerns and challenges to a concrete physical and constructive 

response.

The first exercise in the master’s degree is the creation of a programme that 

reflects the challenges faced by the future of the territory, villages or cities; this 

is an exercise that requires research. This extensive research, which is perhaps 

initially scattered, is territorial in nature but is also social and financial. Learning 

to observe is perhaps one of the greatest difficulties in a teaching scenario 

dominated by the walls of a classroom. Jane Jacobs stated that “The way to get 

at what goes on in the seemingly mysterious and perverse behaviour of cities 

is, I think, to look closely, and with as little previous expectation as is possible, 

at the most ordinary scenes and events, and attempt to see what they mean 

and whether any threads of principle emerge among them”.5 On the challenge 

of relearning how to see our everyday surroundings, Garcés also adds the need 

to abandon the position of spectator and recover the power of the situation, 

the experience of what has been lived. This form of situated knowledge is what 

allows prejudices and transferrals to be detached from the place. This is how the 

research begins on the MArq, fostering a liberated, open and critical view in order 

to identify inconsistencies, imbalances and problems within the territory that can 

be resolved with an architectural project. 

The analysis of solid sources and the mapping of the physical dimension support 

this first phase, but, nevertheless, the process fits into the moment when interaction 

with actors from the space who practise the place. Urban studies and the history 

of humanist architecture demonstrate confidence in the power of architecture to 

change the reality posed by certain architects like Yona Friedman, who stated that 

“architecture has to be conceived with the people, and be brought into existence, 

as far as possible, by the people. This does not mean that the architect has no 

role in the process: they can provide ideas, techniques, new aesthetics, which 

will have to be validated with the people, by the people, for the people alone. 

Incidentally, architects are also people... they belong to the people”.6 Therefore, the 

ETSAV identified with the idea of ‘democratic’ or community-based architecture 

that was also proposed by other authors, such as De Carlo in “An Architecture of 

Participation” or the Briton John F.C. Turner based on the practice of observation 

in the self-built shanty towns of Lima, an experience that he highlights in “Once

Actar, 2011), 14.



confronted through professional contact with local realities and the people who live 

them, the creative specialist or open-minded professional is bound to change his 

or her attitude”.7

The social matrix will therefore be the basis for interaction with agents who 

come into play, whether they are developer-politicians, resident users, 

municipal technicians, financial agents or professionals from other fields. After 

assembling this ecosystem of stakeholders, the master’s degree will activate 

research towards the definition of a programme and the development of a 

PFC, and not only as a preliminary diagnosis but from the beginning to the 

end, passing through different moments and levels of participation. Overcoming 

the distance between the researcher subject and the researched object is the 

main challenge of participatory action research, a method to which the master’s 

degree subscribes in order to introduce students to a practice of deliberation 

and negotiation with antagonistic subjects; this is an exercise that will be habitual 

in their professional future.

An ‘open process’

If the profession of architect has any challenges on the table today, it is knowing 

how to drive the results of processes of participation towards an improved (and 

not worse) architectural response. To do this, students have to be made aware 

that planning is not a physical task carried out exclusively and autonomously by 

the architect, but rather a process of accumulating information, interests and 

availabilities to which the architect has been able to give shape. 

Although participation in architecture is a very recent and unusual phenomenon, 

an interest in using participation as a tool for improvement appeared back in 1959, 

at the CIAM in Otterlo, at which time TEAM X questioned the postulates of modern 

architecture to go beyond the relationship between privacy and community or 

between authorship and shared design. 

In 1961, in the manifesto ‘Open Form’, the Polish architect Oscar Hansen presented 

the challenges of a design that would incorporate the individual and momentary 

particularities of those who use the architecture: “The term ‘quality’ in the language 

of the Open Form should be understood as the recognition of the individual in a 

collective. The Open Form is to aid the individual in finding himself in the collective, 

in make him indispensable in the creation of his own surroundings”.8 Oskar 

Hansen’s didactics, halfway between physical invention and performance, is a 

point of reference that invites the student to enter an atmosphere of permanent 

experimentation and convert contempt towards the interests of users into a source 

of ideas and inspiration. 

In practice, the methodology of the master’s degree does not interpret Hansen’s 

theory as a condition for the proposed architectures, although many open 

proposals have arisen taking into account the security of a PFC, which by tradition 

is located on the frontier between reality and fiction. More than ‘open design’, the 

interest of the master’s degree lies in the ‘open process’, which is committed to 

exploring and putting into practice the function of the architect as a mediator in 

the management of resources of local communities involved in design processes, 

as well as their role as organiser and ‘facilitator’ of the process of executing 

those experiences that will come to be built, following the line of certain Anglo-

Saxon authors such as Jeremy Till when analysing the relationships between 

teaching and research from the perspective of the concept of control and power 

relationships in architecture.9

180 Giancarlo de Carlo also emphasised the idea of an open process and defined a work 

method that challenges the methodologies of the master. He suggested elevating 

and integrating the power of the user to the three phases of the project: defining the 

problem, developing solutions and evaluating the results. With critical purpose, he 

denounced the fact that these phases are not traditionally related to one another 

and that only the second becomes important for the architect as the needs and 

wishes of users take a back seat before the interests of the developer or architect. 

In addition, he adds, the third phase does not exist. But according to Giancarlo de 

Carlo’s new architecture of participation, these phases become an open design 

process where the definition of the problem, aims and resources needed are open 

to discussion. The intention is for this intersectional and cyclical character to be 

transferred to the master’s degree, either from physical experimentation or from 

community work. 

An opportunity for physical experimentation

Another aspect of the ETSAV’s MArq is learning based on physical or constructive 

experimentation, which is another exercise that brings students closer to their 

immediate future as a professional. Physical experimentation is something that has 

been moving away from university classrooms and, as a result of this, it is difficult to 

establish it as a habitual learning practice for the architect. The ease of theoretical 

teaching, the difficulty in finding a suitable space that is large enough and getting 

materials means that architecture teachers fall back on the comfort of a chair and 

a laptop screen.

In his essay The Thinking Hand, Juhani Pallasmaa expresses the opinion that 

“We need an educational change with regard to the sensory sphere, for us to 

discover ourselves again as physical and mental beings in order to fully use our 

capabilities and become less vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation”.10 The 

author proposes that it is necessary to rediscover the skills of the hand and 

even corporal existence. Pallasmaa’s proposal becomes a catalyst to implement 

experimentation in the everyday didactic practice of the MArq. However, in the 

three years since the master’s degree began, serious difficulties with follow-up by 

the students are identified, basically due to their distance from the study territory. 

On very few occasions, the practice of building has arisen spontaneously from 

the students as an inescapable necessity of their research process11 (this is the 

case of the figure 2). Thus it has had to be instigated from the faculty to the 

point that in the 2017/2018 course, the project consisted of a real commission, 

included within the budget of the city hall developer, with plans that set a deadline 

of one year to complete the building. As we will see later, it is not the mission 

of a master’s degree to build real projects, but, nevertheless, the urgency of 

reality was reflected in the students with a change in attitude towards the project, 

greater responsibility, rigor and empathy.

Learning processes that include constructive experimentation on a 1:1 scale and 

the acquisition of competences based on real projects are and have been a point 

of reference for the ETSAV. We can draw parallels with other foreign schools, 

such as the Rural Studio of Auburn University in Alabama. Representatives of this 

course have been invited to the ETSAV on several occasions. The planning course 

at Pascal Rollet in Grenoble, France, is also in the school’s line of sight. Among 

others we find the case of the Floating University at the University of Nuremberg or, 

closer to home, the interdisciplinary group of the International Cooperation Service 

of the University of Seville and Pablo de Olavide University which has been working 

on the rehabilitation of houses in Morocco since 2006. The ETSAV has a long 

history in learning processes that culminate in a built project, either promoted by

planning workshop.13 However, these initiatives have been rather disparate or on an 

individual basis. The main difficulty lies in setting up an infrastructure of spaces and 

companies that provide material, or simply sponsors, to ensure the construction 

exercise to train architects constantly and continuously. 

Stewardship and social return

Working in a real social and territorial scenario and physically carrying out constructive 

experimentation that is also real means that a ‘service-learning’ methodology can

be implemented that seeks to apply generated learning to a real demand. This is an 

extra-academic utility that gives meaning to the public university. 

The municipalities that the MArq has collaborated with not only achieve a kind 

of diverse architectural solution in the PFC format, but also a reflection on the 

problems in their territory, generating awareness of them amongst residents and a 

certain acceptance of the proposals.

For Steen Eiler Rasmussen, being able to count on ‘the people’ is also a way of 

making architecture easier to understand. In Experiencing Architecture, he argued 

that “architecture is produced by ordinary people, for ordinary people; therefore 

it should be easily comprehensible to all”.14 This is, therefore, also one of the 

MArq’s goals, to ‘democratise’ our understanding of architecture, take it down 

into the terrain of recognition and the acceptance of the people. Methodologically-

speaking, ‘participatory action research’ allows the evolution of the design process 

to be planned in a way that takes into account the goals of community work, such 

as the empowerment of the person doing research and the one being researched, 

the links created and the transformation of the perception of them both through 

shared action. All of this is to satisfy a final purpose, which is the improvement of 

living conditions in shared habitats.

At a practical and methodological level, this community dimension seeks 

to manage inclusion and diversity in the decision-making process of future 

architects. Therefore the decision of the people who inhabit the place is present 

in each phase, and from the perspective of the master’s degree this is applied 

at two different speeds: on one hand a slow speed, a participatory process that 

is open to the whole matrix of agents involved and that is sustained from start 

to finish where the students work together towards a common goal. And on 

the other hand, a fast speed, individual processes where only students who are 

especially interested in participation and in building activate intense collaborations 

with particular actors and with timings limited to the project’s requirements. One 

example of this comparative difference can be seen in the following images. 

Figure 4 shows a slow and transversal participation comprising three participatory 

sessions in 2018 with the Nostrallar Neighbourhood Association in Sabadell, 

Sabadell City Hall and the participation of all students of the MArq.15 Figure 5 

is an example of rapid and individual participation, where a project coordinated 

by three students activates sessions of co-design in order to build and meet the 

needs of particular users. 

A critical approach of the first MArq courses

The teaching structure of the MArq takes form around a project carried out by the 

students from the first ideas for a programme to writing up a PFC. This process 

begins, in a fairly collectivised work, in compulsory workshops during the first term. 

A territory, usually a municipality within Barcelona, is studied by all students to find 

out its needs, shortcomings and problems that can be solved by an architectural 

project. The first goal is to develop the programme that will govern the students’ 

projects. A group structure allows the reality of the municipality to be divided into 

subjects like habitat, territory and urban planning, and heritage. Electives in this first 

term can match these specialisms and maintain a direct link with the subject of the 

workshop. Once the programme is defined, the projects are carried out individually 

or in groups of two or three students. The second term focuses on the definition, 

verification and constructive experimentation of the project to complete a PFC as 

defined by the regulations.16 

The following municipalities have been used for the master’s degree: Sallent (autumn 

2015/2016 and autumn 2017-2018), Sant Cugat del Vallès (spring 2015/2016), Sant 

Bartomeu del Grau (autumn 2016/2017), Barberà del Vallès (spring 2016/2017) and 

the neighbourhood of Nostra Llar de Sabadell (spring 2017/2018). The case studies 

include small municipalities like Sant Bartomeu del Grau, with 900 inhabitants, and 

large municipalities in the metropolitan area, like Sant Cugat and Sabadell with 

90,000 and 200,000 inhabitants respectively. 

When the master’s degree has studied larger municipalities, the focus has been on 

one neighbourhood or area to limit the areas to be researched. In fact, if anything 

has become evident over the past six courses it is that the ideal framework to 

implement a teaching methodology based on participatory action research and 

service-learning is a small municipality or neighbourhood with a strong identity 

and community. In participation sessions, attendance is normally between 30 and 

60 people, regardless of the size of the municipality. This participation in a limited 

territory (small village or neighbourhood) offers a much more representative sample 

than in a big city. Communication and interaction with the population has turned 

out to be more fluid in villages than in big cities. In rural areas, more need for 

reflection at a territorial level has also been detected, something that is already 

practised in the city by teams of architects from public institutions.

sessions are made public and can be 
consulted online at: “Blog of the Master’s 
Degree in Architecture”, https://marq.etsav.

March 2019). 

16 Order EDU/2075/2010, from 29 July, which lays 
down the requirements for the verification of 
official university qualifications that enable the 
profession of architect to be practised, states 
that the PFC must be an original exercise 
carried out individually, which will consist of 
a professional comprehensive architectural 
project which synthesises all the competences 
acquired during the degree course, developed 
to demonstrate sufficiency to determine the 
completion of the building works it applies to, 
in compliance with the technical regulations 
and applicable administration.

Teaching tools

The teaching methodology of the MArq combines different tools, some of 

which are traditional when training to be an architect, and others that are more 

innovative. We divide the tools into two types. Those that are specific to the 

master’s degree —the real case study, research, interaction with people and 

constructive experimentation— and those of teaching practice —workshops, 

theory, physical and social cartography, tutorials and public correction. The 

following table shows the strengths and weaknesses found in the specific tools 

of the MArq.

Topics researched

One of the main difficulties detected when planning consists of the thematic 

contribution or transfer of global values that occasionally move away from the 

needs and specificities of the local territory. Even so, we identify common themes 

that intersect with the different locations: the opening up and connection of free 

spaces with the natural landscape, the reprogramming of disused industrial 

buildings, recycling of materials, territorial connectivity and cooperative housing 

are the most common. Low density, the recovery of the water cycle and energy 

efficiency, rural heritage and tourism, or the optimisation of facilities do happen 

but less frequently. 

The contradictions of the MArq

As a critical exercise with regard to the complexity of a collaborative work like this 

type of PFC, we can highlight a series of contradictions or challenges on which to 

continue working until the right measure is found to reach a situation of optimum 

balance and comfort. 

From the outset, the first contradiction lies in the need to work in a group from start 

to finish with regard to the regulatory requirement for the PFC to have a personal 

and unique result.17 Dynamics that flow in a group are affected and sometimes slow 

down in the second part of the academic year by seeking to adapt in order to give a 

result that can be individually assessed, even though the transversal competences 

of the master’s degree include teamwork and cooperation. The individuality of a 

project is somewhat questionable in light of a professional reality that is increasingly 

less generalist, with more projects carried out by multidisciplinary teams.

The second contradiction is manifested in the loss of focus or in the symptom 

of the researched researcher. Whether it is the result of participation sessions 

(disagreements, power roles) or, if the PFC culminates in building the plans, of the 

construction phase (decisions that are not shared, the day-to-day business of the 

work, technical data and the budget, among others), the critical distance required 

at the beginning of the course is distorted. Everyday situations that are on a small 

scale but consume a great deal of energy are sometimes perceived as agents that 

threaten the quality of the final result. 

Third, the impact of the vacuum on the theory or practice of participatory 

architecture. In spite of the students’ interest, in the master’s degree it is evident 

that the degree curriculum does not include these competences. The lack of tools, 

key concepts and referents is a constant that has to be dealt with in parallel to the 

planning exercise. This lack of experience is also suffered by part of the teaching 

team and sometimes involves divergent opinions on the issue of participation, 

which in turn contributes to a critical view that has a positive influence on the 

process.

186 Fourth, academic timings are often out of synch with the administrative times of 

developers and even more so with the biorhythms of the communities involved. 

This means a great deal of effort must be made during communication between 

the different actors and the school. 

And fifth, the total dedication of students decreases due to their need or opportunity 

to do work placements, which places greater pressure on the workload deriving 

from the master’s degree. The high level of complexity of a real project like this 

therefore represents certain incompatibilities outside of teaching hours, especially 

for those groups that end up building their plans.

Conclusions: consolidations and incorporations

For many students, the master’s degree has become their first real experience 

of service-learning. This progressively allows change and reflection to be made 

on the social responsibility of the architect in the city of sweat equity. The MArq 

is therefore an opportunity and a pretext to recover the inheritance of counter-

discourses that are typical of the history of architecture and urbanism featuring 

humanist authors who today can inspire future architects interested in community 

practices and participation. The connection with this heritage and tradition plus the 

interdisciplinary approach become allies when it comes to continuing to refine and 

polish what will struggle to become predictable or controllable as an experience 

and social entity. In the words of Richard Sennett,18 the master’s degree as a 

teaching project finds its nature not in an ecosystem limited by its balance, but in 

a social device that works in a network, an open system and a place to learn to 

manage the vicissitudes of the uncertain. 

The experience acquired during the three years the degree has been running, with 

its six case studies, allows us to evaluate the consequences of this methodology.19 

The panels that assess each course agree in stating that, compared to the projects 

that result from the old final degree project, those of the master’s degree show 

evidence of the development of a less productive entity but immense control and 

research by the students. The nature of each assignment has also conditioned 

the final result, especially in those contexts where the commitment to build has 

leveraged and reduced the ability to control the scale of the territory. In spite of 

the small circumstantial scale, placing students before an interlocutor external to 

the university and the profession who questions their decisions obliges them to 

consolidate the progress of the project with solid and transversal arguments, and 

the positive aspects of this interaction are not in doubt. On the other hand, the 

trajectory of the master’s degree has been much more erratic, with methods to 

encourage constructive experimentation. On some courses this experience has 

been non-existent, and on others all teaching has been devoted to construction. 

Neither one thing or the other. Therefore, we still have to find the right balance 

between the intellectual development of a project, work in a workshop, interaction 

with ‘the people’ and constructive experimentation on a real scale.
