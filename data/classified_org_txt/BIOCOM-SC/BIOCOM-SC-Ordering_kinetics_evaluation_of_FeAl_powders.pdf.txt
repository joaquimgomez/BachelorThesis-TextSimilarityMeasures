Abstract
In this study, time resolved X-ray diffraction experiments using synchrotron X-ray radiation have been 

performed to get insight on the time and temperature dependent atomic ordering of an intermetallic Fe-40Al 
(at.%) ball-milled powder. The target of the present study is to gain knowledge on the rapid heating processes 
occurring during Thermal Spray coating processes. Present results show that in the temperature range 400ºC - 
550ºC, the evolution of the order can be followed and modelled by fitting the powder diffraction patterns 
collected within the first minutes after fast heating. Reasonable refinements have been obtained by assuming the 
presence of two domains corresponding to the ordered and disordered lattices. The lattice constant changes from 
0.29165±3 10-5 nm in the ball-milled powder at room temperature to 0.29281± 10-4  nm in the ordered phase 
after 3000s at 550ºC. The growth of the ordered phase is proposed to be a vacancy-related process with an 
activation energy of 1.04 eV. Above 550ºC, the ordering kinetics appears too fast to be resolved using the few 
seconds time scale of the present experiments which is in agreement to thermal spray results conditions.

1. Introduction

Ordering phenomena is a key process for the proper understanding of the outstanding properties that 
intermetallic compounds can offer in terms of mechanical, electrical and magnetic properties. This has been 
investigated for decades in the attempt to elucidate how slight changes on crystal lattice order result in changes 
on these properties [1, 2, 3].

The order-disorder transitions take place at a so-called critical ordering temperature Tc, which exists for 
either first or second-order phase transitions. At temperatures above Tc, a short-range order (SRO) parameter is 
defined and the atoms are prone to order over short distances only; below Tc, a long-range order (LRO) 
parameter, defined by the tendency of atoms to be surrounded by unlike atoms, shows a dependency on 
increasing the temperature i.e. it either decreases continuously like CuZn or drops abruptly to zero slightly above 
Tc like Cu3Au [3]. 

Certain alloys possess the ordering temperature close to the melting temperature (Tm). Such alloys keep 
therefore a permanently ordered structure unless a special treatment such as high deformation by ball milling or 
high dose particle irradiation is applied [1]. Representatives of this group are Ni3Al, NiAl, FeAl, TiAl; by 
contrast, examples of reversibly ordering alloys, whose Tc < Tm, can be found within Cu–Pt and Cu–Au systems 
[4]. From the first category, transition metal aluminides have been mainly investigated due to their low densities 
and promising high temperature oxidation resistance properties.

But how then is their degree of order affected upon fast heating up to almost the melting point followed 
by rapid cooling? This concept is interesting to elucidate what happens to Thermal Spray coating processes. 
These are a group of technologies where sufficient kinetic and thermal energy are imparted to the raw material 
(in powder, wire or rod form) to create a confined high-energy particle stream, and propel the energetic particles 
toward the substrate using a high-pressure carrier gas. The molten or partially molten particles deform on impact 
with the substrate creating cohesive bonds with each other and adhesive bonds with the substrate [5, 6]; even just 
kinetic energy can be transferred to the particles in the more recent less conventional Cold Gas Spray process, 
inducing solid-state bonding only by suitable plastic deformation of the material [7]. 



Due to the thermal history of the powder upon spraying, which can involve particle temperatures near the 
melting point of the material (specially in conventional processes) and afterwards high cooling rates upon impact 
onto the substrate, partial ordering can be obtained in intermetallic coatings [8]. The main motivation of this 
study is then to evaluate how fast a disordered intermetallic powder becomes ordered due to rapid heating, in 
analogy to what happens to particles in the flame. We expect to gain insight of time-temperature dependent 
atomic ordering in the processes involved during the spraying, oriented to improve the final properties. Since 
usual x-ray data acquisition with proper resolution takes a long time, synchrotron radiation will be used. 

 Nanocrystalline Fe-40Al (at.%) structures are obtained by thermal spray from a ball milled feedstock 
powder as a way to enhance mechanical properties. We have produced Fe-40Al (at.%) coatings by the high 
velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) technology, obtaining good corrosion and oxidation resistance [9, 10]. Transition 
metal aluminides have strong potential for replacing superalloys and stainless steels in moderate and high 
temperature structural applications. FeAl-based alloys possess an outstanding high-temperature corrosion 
resistance [11] and they have a lower density  (5.56g/cm3) compared to other iron-based materials such as cast 
iron and stainless steels (e.g. in heating elements, hot-gas filters, piping and tubing, exhaust manifolds, etc.). 
However, some aspects such as poor room temperature ductility and toughness and mediocre creep strength, as 
well as fabrication difficulties have hindered the introduction of intermetallics in many cases as industrial 
structural materials [12]. Because of all these reasons, aluminides appear particularly interesting as coatings on 
more conventional higher-strength materials which are less corrosion-resistant at high temperatures. 

Many works have dealt with the order-disorder transitions in the Fe-Al system in terms of structural 
changes upon temperature, mainly through magnetic, calorimetric and X- ray diffraction experiments, showing 
complementary results with these techniques [13, 14]. Some authors have pointed out that the strength of 
ordering behavior of late transition-metal aluminides finds its origin in the atomic size effect, since the reduction 
in strain energy due to atomic size misfit can be achieved by ordering. However, the validity of this size effect 
has also been questioned for years [15]. 

Owing to long data acquisition, conventional laboratory X-ray sources present serious limitations for the 
study of how the order parameter in thermal equilibrium varies with temperature. On the other hand, the high 
intensity offered by synchrotron X-ray radiation sources coupled with modern fast timing detectors, allows 
getting insight on the kinetics of time-temperature atomic ordering processes. Such techniques are being applied 
for investigating the ordering transitions [16, 17, 18, 19] as well as the evaluation of several material 
crystallization kinetics [20, 21, 22, 23] and other reactions [24, 25, 26, 27]. In their work on Cu3Au, Shannon et 
al., studied the order-disorder transition starting from a disordered state at an initial temperature Ti  above the 
critical one (Ti > Tc) and then quenching into a region of the phase diagram where the equilibrium state is 
ordered (Tc > Tf ), Tf standing for final temperature [19]. By contrast, Schaefer et al., performed some time 
dependent experiments for Fe-45Al (at.%) specimens by using time-differential length scale measurements after 
fast heating rates and then left isothermally treated; they obtained the vacancy formation and migration 
enthalpies, 1.0 ± 0.1 eV and 1.5 ± 0.2 eV respectively [28]. The purpose of the present study is to report the 
ordering process in a Fe-40Al (at.%) ball milled powder alloy upon fast heating from the  room temperature 
disordered state and, to evaluate the kinetics of such ordering process as well. As mentioned above, this will help 
with the understanding of the ordered phase formation in thermal spraying. 

2. Experimental method

A ball milled Fe-40Al (at.%) alloy powder supplied by CEA-DTEN (Grenoble) was used for this study. It 
has a nominal composition of Fe–40Al–0.05Zr (at.%) +50 ppm B+1 wt%.Y2O3.

The temperature dependent and time resolved powder diffraction experiments were performed on the 
BL04-MSPD beamline of the synchrotron facility ALBA located in the Barcelona area [29, 30]. 

The powders were enclosed into sealed quartz capillaries of 0.5 mm diameter, and the data was collected 
in transmission geometry using a monochromated beam of 0.042492 nm wavelength. The set-up included a 
remote controlled heated air blower (Cyberstar) allowing collecting data at the selected sample temperatures 400, 
450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700 and 750ºC after fast heating from room temperature. The hot spot of the blower, 
this is the constant temperature range of the sample, is 5 mm in length and the X-ray beam was 3 x 0.7 mm2.  
The time needed for the blower to go from room temperature to the selected data acquisition temperature was 
about 3-5 min, also considering a non-negligible temperature overshoot of ~5%. The analogy to thermal spray 



appears as an approximation to the process since the powder is heated when fed in the flame and high 
temperatures are reached in very short times. To avoid the higher temperatures due to the overshoot, the 
following methodology was applied. The sample was rapidly heated at the blower set temperature and left 
stabilized during ~ 10min. It was then remotely moved 10 mm (10s moving time) from that position to heat 
another portion of the sample. By operating in this way, the part of the sample studied was quickly heated at the 
selected temperature without suffering from temperature overshoot. It was checked that, at that zone 10 mm 
apart from the initial heated position, the atomic order did not change, even testing at the highest temperature. 
The time for the 0.5 mm diameter capillary to achieve the final temperature, when laterally moved and exposed 
to the hot air flow, was estimated to be around 10 s. Sufficiently good data statistics could be obtained with 5 s 
effective acquisition time, which taking into account data processing/transfer and temperature reading resulted in 
8.2s time resolution of our X-ray powder data collection. The powder patterns were registered using the position 

sensitive MYTHEN detector (6 single modules of 1280 channels) allowing collecting in a single shot a 41.1º 2 
angular range in 0.0062º steps. Between two detector modules, the pattern is obscured over a ~0.2 º angular 
range; it was hence crucial for time resolved experiments to smartly position the detector so to avoid Bragg 
reflections on this  specific “dead” regions. The X-ray diffractograms will be presented in reciprocal space units 

instead of the 2 scattering angle:
Equation 1:  Q = 4(sin)/ 

The X-ray patterns were refined by the Rietveld method using the FullProf software [31]. For this work, 
we assumed the presence of different domains corresponding to a completely ordered bcc B2 superlattice and a 
completely bcc disordered phase [32, 33]. Since ordering parameters are related to the microstructure (strain and 
size), a particular attention was focused on the analysis and fitting of the x-ray peak shapes;  for that purpose, we 
used the Thomson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt function [32]. The instrumental resolution was determined by 
collecting data of a Na2Ca3Al2F14 sample enclosed in 0.5mm diameter capillary. 

In order to achieve a good correlation between the calculated and the experimental diffractograms, the 
minimum values of the usual fit indicators of the FullProf software were monitored. The increase of peak 
full width at half maximum (FWHM) respect to the instrumental contribution is assumed to come mainly from 
the grain size and strain effects; the different parameters were fitted throughout the refinement. At each step, 
iteration cycles were conducted until convergence was reached.

The full widths at half maximum HG and HL of the corresponding Gaussian (Eq 2) and Lorentzian (Eq 3) 
contributions are calculated according to an angular dependence [23]:

Where U, αD, X are terms related to strain and, Y, IG, αZ are related to domain size. According to the 
FullProf manual, the parameter ξ is a mixing coefficient to mimic Lorentzian contribution to strains. The output 
*.mic files give further information about microstructural parameters from each diffraction peak.

The approximate sizes of the ordered and disordered domains have been found according to the fitted 
Lsize (FullProf size parameter) as follows, due to the units used on the data:

Equation 5:  Size(nm)=100/(fitted Lsize)

  
3. Results and discussion

The atomized Fe-40Al (at.%) powder had a spherical morphology. Figure 1 presents a micrograph of the 
ball-milled Fe-40Al (at.%) powder, with characteristic irregular morphology corresponding to the milling 
process. Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of as-atomized powder and of atomized+ball-milled 



powder, at room temperature.  The pattern of the atomized powder at room temperature was obtained by 
collecting at several detector positions hence covering the gap mentioned in the previous section (Fig. 2). 

The atomized powder (Fig. 2a) showed the presence of all peaks corresponding to the ordered bcc B2 
structure. The fitted B2 cell parameter at room temperature was 0.28972±2 10-5  nm. However, for the ball-
milled powder at room temperature, no peaks corresponding to ordering (indexed as hkl, with h+k+l=odd) were 
observed.  Figure 2b corresponds to the ball-milled x-ray diffraction at room temperature, just showing the 
corresponding fundamental lines (h+k+l=even). The peaks are observed to be broad, indicating that milling 
induces strain and grain refinement.

The corresponding lattice constant of the ball-milled powder at room temperature was found to be 
0.29165±3 10-5  nm by the refinement. Zamanzade et al., have recently published in their review, the comparison 
between the lattice parameter for the α-Fe (bcc, a0 = b0 = c0 = 0.28665 nm) with the values found by many 
authors in the literature for the B2-FeAl phase (a0 = b0 = c0 = 0.291, 0.283, 0.3031 nm) [34]. The slightly larger 
lattice parameter compared to that of the B2 phase points out the lower degree of order as a result of the heavy 
plastic deformation. 

Most works about B2-ball-milled intermetallic phases have also yielded a disordered A2 solid solution 
structure [35, 36, 37]. In addition, non-stoichiometric compositions of FeAl (greater or less than 50 at.% Al) lead 
to the generation of constitutional defects. The sub-lattices of the B2 structure are defined as the α sublattice 

containing Fe atoms and the  sublattice containing Al atoms. Four possible defects can be created on these 
sublattices: (i) Fe atoms on the  sublattice (anti-site Fe atoms), (ii) Al atoms on the α sublattice (anti-site Al 
atoms) and (iii) vacancies on the α or  sublattice. FeAl is actually considered a less strongly ordered 
intermetallic because of the more complex defect distribution, where in addition to the occurrence of vacancies 
at the Fe site, the substitutional antisite defects at the Fe sites can also be very stable [38]. Both effects, the off-
stoichiometric composition with 40at%Al and the ball milling process, generate a distorsion within the lattice 
resulting in such increased lattice parameter. Actually, it has been shown that the NiAl phase continues to be in 
the ordered state upon milling without getting disordered, whereas the FeAl phase was found to be in the 
disordered state both in the as-produced condition by MA mechanical alloying and also on milling the ordered 
compound [39, 40]. With short time at the temperature of 400ºC and above, the fundamental peaks first appear 
very broad due to the strain effects of the ball milling, but they become narrower as the disordered phase 
disappears and the ordered phase appears (Fig 3). 

At first attempt, the occupation of Fe and Al were made variable, maintaining the chemical composition 
of the phase. No satisfactory fitting was achieved; the width of peaks is large, and no good fitting concerning the 
shape of peaks was obtained. A different peak width evolution for the superlattice and fundamental peaks was 
observed; due to all this, a variable width fitting procedure for superstructure peaks (hkl, h+k+l=odd) was 
attempted; this improves the fitting but the shape of peaks was not in good agreement (RBragg larger than 10). 
Relatively wide peaks without specific correlation among their widths at intermediate times at the selected 
annealing temperatures suggested the presence of two phases. Thus, we assumed the presence of different 
domains, corresponding to a completely ordered B2-type phase and a completely disordered; then, the 
refinement was approached by defining these two phases with the introduction of the proper (fixed) occupancy 
factors from the start. Therefore, the main parameters under considerations and indicative of the (dis-) ordering 
kinetics finally were: (i) the ratio between the ordered and disordered phase, being defined as the ratio between 
the two refined scale factors, (ii) the evolution of both cell parameters at the tested temperatures, (iii) the strain 
contribution of the remaining disordered phase and (iv) the domain size evolution of the two phases. The starting 
ball-milled powder showed only disordered phase, while on short times (a few seconds) of annealing time, the 
ordered phase increased its percentage.

Figure 4 shows the evolution of the ordered (a) and disordered (b) cubic phases cell parameters at the 
different temperatures along the experiment, when it is assumed that both phases have already stabilized. Very 
slight changes can be observed.  Table 1 indicates the minimum value of the usual fit indicators (Chi2, RBragg) 
that were monitored by the FullProf software along the fitting [32].

The ordered phase stabilizes after 3000s at around 0.29184 ±3 10-5 nm, 0.29216± 4 10-5 nm, 0.29244± 3 
10-5  nm, and 0.29281± 10-4  nm at the temperatures of 400, 450, 500 and 550ºC respectively, whereas the 
disordered phase presents more scattered values due to its reduced occurrence at long times of annealing 
treatment. A coefficient of thermal expansion of 2.2 10-5 K-1 is obtained, coherent with the one obtained from the 
cell parameter fits for the atomized powder at room temperature and at 500ºC (2.1 10-5 K-1).

Figure 5 shows the mass% of the ordered phase calculated from the ratio between the refined scale factors 
of the measurements. It can be observed that at 400ºC, the ordering process takes place more slowly, as 
expected, than at 450ºC and above; actually, it does not seem that even after the test time the complete ordering 
is achieved. Thermal energy promotes diffusion, which induces Fe and Al atoms to occupy their most 
energetically favorable positions, but at temperatures below 500ºC, the thermal energy input is still low to 
promote almost full ordering and, at even much higher temperatures, the thermal vibration is becoming a 
competitive process, thus also limiting the formation of the complete ordered structure [13]. At 500 and 550ºC, 
the ordering occurs fast and the material appears completely ordered after some 200 s. At above such 
temperature, the ordering occurs during the first 10-30s and, considering that the acquisition is done every 8 s, no 
much change can be observed after two diffractograms. The time dependence of the ordered phase weight% can 
be fitted to an exponential behavior approaching 100% at long times, and the following time constants were 
obtained: 400ºC, 910 s; 450ºC, 450s; 500ºC, 58 s; and 550ºC, 47 s. By plotting the natural logarithm of the time 
constants as function of the inverse absolute temperature, the obtained activation energy for the process was 
equivalent to 1.04 eV. Then, as this value is very near the energy determined by Schaefer et al. (1.07 eV) for the 
formation of vacancies, it appears that the growth of the ordered phase could be a vacancy-related process [29]. 

In Figure 6, the ordering process results in a release of strain can be seen. Also table 2 shows the range of 
values corresponding to the strain parameter (X, see equation 3) as well as the strain. The disordered 
arrangement produced by ball milling is a metastable, highly strained state. Thermal energy promotes diffusion, 
which induces Fe and Al atoms to occupy their most energetically favorable positions, eventually leading to an 
ordered phase; however, some strain remains, which should be related to a more long-range (and more time 
involved) process (large defects involved). The strain releases slowly after the ordering process because of the 
long range diffusion needed.

By considering the ordering through the existence of individual ordered domains that develop either when 
temperature or time are increased,  they grow more rapidly at 500ºC and 550ºC. Reordering after a severe plastic 
deformation process has been actually reported to occur upon heating by the coarsening of the nanodomains until 
the ordered domains reach the size of the grains [41]. 

There are two modes of defect structures in the B2 crystal: anti-structure defect structure and triple defect 
structure. The anti-structure defect structure results in an anti-site atom for a constitutional defect of a rich phase, 
and a pair of anti-structure defects for thermal defects. The triple defect structure consists of anti-site Fe atoms 
for Fe-rich constitutional defects and sublattice vacancies for Al-rich constitutional defects. The situation is 
actually complicated for the less strongly ordered FeAl. In addition to the occurrence of vacancies at the Fe site, 

the substitutional antisite defects at the Fe sites can also be very stable. Given the Hf value for FeAl, it is 



situated on the borderline for the different defect structures. However, Pike [42] shows that the triple vacancy 
model predicts the vacancy concentration of FeAl. The results here are coherent with Pike’s.

A fast growing of ordered phase domains is observed from the fittings. From no detectable existence, to 
some 8 nm size in 8 s at 450ºC (see figure 7 and 8 as well as table 2). This part would correspond to shorter 
range of order. At longer times, once the order is near completed, the size continues to grow, but more slowly, as 
it would correspond to long range diffusion. 

Concerning thermal spray processes, we should consider how this degree of order attained at the 
temperature reached by the particle feedstock material (partially or fully molten droplet), is then maintained 
upon the high cooling rates up to 106 K/s that are involved. First, the temperatures studied in the present work 
would be similar to the temperatures reached at the core of coarse particles, leading to their recrystallization and 
partial ordering, while the particle shells reach up to the melting point of the material. Cordier-Robert et al. 
actually confirmed that the non-homogeneous atomic order state in High Velocity Oxygen Fuel and Atmospheric 
Plasma Spray coatings depends on the initial powder microstructure in the feedstock [43]. Core is more ordered 
than shell in the case of the atomized Fe60Al40 Fe-40Al (at.%) powder and vice versa for the milled Fe60Al40 
Fe-40Al (at.%) powder. All these results would be in agreement to what was previously stated that these 
intermetallics do not usually disorder upon rapid quenching in the core. The molten areas are another issue, 
which cannot be explained by the experiments presented here and, where the behavior of the undercooled 
material must be considered. 
 

4. Conclusions

The study of the time-temperature atomic ordering for a Fe-40Al (at.%) ball milled alloy by means of X-ray 
synchrotron powder diffraction results in the following conclusions:

 The 400-550ºC temperature range can be followed by the experimental setup (the time to reach the 
temperature of the sample is about 10 s); one diffractogram was acquired each 8.2 s.

 The best fitting is performed by considering the presence of different domains (ordered and disordered 
phase, fixed occupancy factors), one growing and the other diminishing. The results seem to indicate 
that this assumption is the best one.

 At 400ºC, the ordering process takes place more slowly (some hours), as expected, than 450ºC and 
above (some minutes, or some seconds above 500ºC).

 The increase of ordered phase amount can be fitted to an exponential behavior. At long times, the 
ordering appears to be completed at 450ºC and above, although the existence of some strain even at 
high temperatures may indicate that some is not completely released. This shows a short-range process, 
seemingly related to vacancies (because the 1.04 eV value found for the activation energy is near to the 
reported in the literature for the formation of vacancies) for the ordering; at larger atomic distances, 
additional time process for the relief of residual strains (seemingly related to larger defects) may explain 
the results.

 The fitted growth of ordered phase domain size seems to follow the above indicated process.
 Even the small in-flight time of the particles in a HVOF process is enough to produce certain order of 

the internal core structure, which does not disorder upon rapid cooling. The ordering process is however 
assumed to be too fast to be able to be resolved in the time scale of the present experiments (a few 
seconds).
