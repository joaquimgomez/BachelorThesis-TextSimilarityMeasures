In some bacterial infections, the immune system cannot eliminate the invading pathogen.

In these cases, the invading pathogen is successful in establishing a favorable

environment to survive and persist in the host organism. For example, S. aureus bacteria

survive in organ tissues employing a set of mechanisms that work in a coordinated

and highly regulated way allowing: (1) efficient impairment of the immune response;

and (2) protection from the immune cells and molecules. S. aureus secretes several

proteins including coagulases and toxins that drive abscess formation and persistence.

Unless staphylococcal abscesses are surgically drained and treated with antibiotics,

disseminated infection and septicemia produce a lethal outcome. Within this context,

this paper develops a simple mathematical model of abscess formation incorporating

characteristics that we judge important for an abscess to be formed. Our aim is to

build a mathematical model that reproduces some characteristics and behaviors that

are observed in the process of abscess formation.

Keywords: S. aureus infection, abscess formation, fibrin network, partial differential equation, computational

1. INTRODUCTION

In some Staphylococcus aureus infections, neutrophils cannot completely eliminate the invading
pathogen. In such cases, a lesion known as abscess may form, especially in skin or in soft tissue
organs. An abscess is characterized by an area comprising invading pathogens, fibrin, immune
cells (mainly neutrophils) and many types of dead cells, and it may be formed in response to
viral or bacterial infections in various organs. Abscess formation is often a defense mechanism
elicited by the host to prevent dissemination of pathogens. However, in some instances, such as
mycobacterial and staphylococcal infections, the pathogen appears to have subverted this defense
and paradoxically uses this environment to thrive and persist (Cheng et al., 2009, 2010; Graves et al.,
2010; Kim et al., 2011, 2012; McAdow et al., 2012).

Following intravenous infection of mice, S. aureus starts to leave the vasculature to colonize
the renal tissue a few hours later. In the vasculature, S. aureus begins to produce toxins1. Some,
like α-toxin, can target various cell types and lead to massive damage in infected sites. Other, like
the leukotoxins, are more specific and target mainly leukocytes (Kwiecinski, 2013). The function

cause lysis of those cells.

of these toxins is thought to primarily kill immune cells, but
also to alter host responses. For example, interaction of α-toxin
with its receptor ADAMS10 causes tissue barrier disruption
that may facilitate dissemination from the vasculature to organs
(Berube and Bubeck Wardenburg, 2013). S. aureus also induces
the clotting of blood and plasma in the vasculature (Cheng
et al., 2009, 2010). Presumably this mechanism prevents immune
cells, in the bloodstream, to phagocytose the bacteria. Further,
this mechanism is responsible for the formation of bacterial
agglutinates or micro-emboli that may help to mechanically
disrupt the endothelial barrier and thereby allow the bacteria
to gain access into tissues. Despite these strategies, few bacteria
manage to survive in the vasculature and establish lesions in the
kidney successfully. Within 3 h of infection, the bacteria load in
both blood and kidneys are high (Cheng et al., 2009, 2010). Then
bacteria loads decrease until 12 h post inoculation (Cheng et al.,
2009, 2010). This is due to the fact that immune cells, mainly
neutrophils, are successfully eliminating the majority of bacteria.
Other host defense mechanisms, such as complement system,
also contribute to bacterial killing (Foster, 2005). Then after 12
h, we can clearly view a pattern of logistic growth of the bacteria
load. This pattern appears as a result of the abscess formation
dynamics (Cheng et al., 2009).

After 12 h, S. aureus starts to replicate forming a
Staphylococcus abscess community (SAC) inside the abscess
lesion. During this process, the bacteria employ a variety
of mechanisms to kill and evade immune cells. But equally
important is a mechanism used by S. aureus to isolate themselves
from immune cells conferring an even greater protection. This
mechanism is the result of the deposition of fibrin clots around
the SAC, and around the entire lesion (Cheng et al., 2009, 2010;
McAdow et al., 2012). S. aureus secretes coagulases, Coa and
vWbp, that bind to and activate prothrombin, thereby converting
fibrinogen to fibrin. The coagulases diffuse throughout the tissue
from the SAC, inducing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin
in the regions around the bacteria colonies. As a result, a fibrin
network is formed around the SAC (Foster, 2005; Cheng et al.,
2010; McAdow et al., 2012). S. aureus encodes a surface protein
called Clumping Factor A (ClfA) (Foster and Höök, 1998),
which is responsible for the recognition and binding to fibrin.
ClfA-mediated binding of fibrin delineates the first margin of
the SAC. The resultant fibrin polymer forms the structure of
fibrin around the staphylococci (Foster, 2005; Cheng et al.,
2010; McAdow et al., 2012), and S. aureus persists in the center
of abscess lesions protected from the immune system. Unless
staphylococcal abscesses are surgically drained and treated with
antibiotics, disseminated infection and septicemia produce a
lethal outcome (Kim et al., 2011). Therefore it is important
to gain a deep understanding of how an abscess is formed
in order to develop vaccines and treatments to S. aureus
infections. In vivo experiments have been performed to identify
the factors necessary for abscess formation, but the search for
its determinants is a complex task, since it requires studying the
interaction between hundreds or even thousands of components
that participate in the process and analyzing how observed
behavior emerges from these interactions. Mathematical and
computational modeling (Bender, 2000; Meerschaert, 2013;

Shiflet and Shiflet, 2014) can help in this search, contributing to
a better comprehension of some aspects of abscess formation as,
for example, the importance of different mechanisms employed
by pathogens to survive in the host.

A set of related works developed mathematical models
of the immune response with the objective of studying the
following subjects: (1) the innate immune response to a bacterial
infection, (2) the formation of bacteria colonies, and (3) the
dynamics of interaction between the host and the pathogen. The
related works bear some similarities to this paper, such as for
instance, the modeling of bacteria and neutrophil cells and the
modeling of processes such as bacteria replication, neutrophil
migration, phagocytosis and diffusion. However, none of them
are capable of reproducing the formation of a stable abscess
pattern.

In Keener and Sneyd (1998) a unidimensional model
developed by Alt and Lauffenburger (1987) is presented to
study under what conditions Polymorphonuclear leukocytes
(PMNs), more commonly called neutrophils, are successful in
controlling a bacterial infection. The model is comprised of
three variables: bacteria (b), cytokine (c) and neutrophil (n).
The authors performed a linear stability analysis of the model
[more details can be obtained in section 16.3 of the book
Mathematical Physiology Keener and Sneyd, 1998] and the
results obtained can be summarized in three cases: (1) bacteria
are completely eliminated and the neutrophil concentration
stabilizes to a normal value; (2) neutrophils cannot control
the growth of bacteria and bacteria grow without limitation;
(3) neutrophils control the growth of bacteria, but they cannot
completely eliminate them. In this case, there is a state of
persistent infection where both are present and maintain a
balance. These three behaviors are also obtained in the bacteria-
neutrophil model developed here. The paper concludes that
a bacterial infection can be controlled when the rate of
phagocytosis is sufficiently large and the immune response is
most effective when neutrophils are able to recruit more cells
and move chemotactically. As will be shown, the same behavior
is observed in this paper for models that consider the dynamics
of neutrophils. The model of Alt and Lauffenburger (1987) does
not consider the dynamics of fibrin as this paper does. Here, we
study and analyze the effects of fibrin in a mathematical model of
the abscess formation process.

Kawasaki et al. (1997) have developed a reaction-diffusion
system for bacterial and nutrient concentrations that reproduces
various observed growth patterns in colonies of bacteria. One of
the important elements of the model is a non-linear diffusion
term that depends on both concentrations of bacteria and
nutrients. The model simulates the fact that, in regions devoid
of nutrients, the bacteria cannot move, becoming more inactive.
They were able to produce highly branched patterns only with the
presence of a minimal anisotropy coming from the square lattice
used in simulations. In spite of reproducing several patterns, the
model was not able to reproduce the pattern of concentric rings
because, according to the authors, this pattern requires additional
mechanisms. The model of Kawasaki et al. (1997) does not study
the immune response to a bacterial infection, the dynamics of
fibrin and toxins as this paper does. Besides, the model does not

Pigozzo et al. Development of a Computational Model of Abscess Formation

consider diffusion to be dependent on the amount of available
space as the models presented in this paper do.

An additional mechanism was proposed by Lacasta et al.
(1999). They presented a model of reaction-diffusion for the
growth of colonies of bacteria of the species Bacillus subtilis.
The model is comprised of two equations for the concentrations
of bacteria and nutrients. Like the previous model of Kawasaki
et al. (1997), the model of Lacasta and co-authors was able to
reproduce different growth patterns of species B. subtilis, which
resulted in a rich variety of structures. Certain structures, such as
concentric rings, were only obtained because they considered in
the model a cooperative behavior among bacteria. This behavior
was modeled considering a global phenomenological variable
that represents the number of bacteria most active in the colony,
that is, the bacteria that move more in search of nutrients. In
addition, they considered a nonlinear diffusion coefficient that
depends on this variable.Lacasta et al. (1999) did not consider
the immune response, the dynamics of fibrin and toxins in their
model as this paper does.

Smith et al. (2011) developed a number of models to
gain a greater understanding of how different layers of host
defense in the lower respiratory tract, including resident cells
and recruited cells, combine to form a response against a
pneumococcal lung infection. In this study, the immune response
is divided into three stages: (1) the response given by resident
alveolar macrophages; (2) the response given by neutrophils; and
(3) the response given by macrophages derived from monocytes
from the bloodstream. Mathematical models that describe the
dynamics of each of these three stages were developed (Smith
et al., 2011). Smith and co-authors studied the relationship
between the inoculated concentration of bacteria and two
outcomes: (1) the establishment or (2) the eradication of an
infection. First, they used a single alveolar macrophage response
equation to study how a threshold dose determines whether the
result will be the establishment or eradication of the infection.
This model was then extended to incorporate pro-inflammatory
cytokine production accompanied by neutrophil recruitment.
Finally, they examined the possibility of elimination of the
bacteria given by an influx of monocyte-derived macrophages.
The authors argue that through these models it was possible
to better understand the contribution of each of the variables
considered for the initiation and resolution of pneumococcal
pulmonary infection and were able to capture the qualitative
behavior of the experimental data.The work of Smith et al. (2011)
does not consider the dynamics of fibrin formation and toxin
production by the bacteria and the interactions between fibrin,
toxin and neutrophils.

Other studies examine the dynamics of parasites in the
immune system. The first work (Antia et al., 1994) considers
the dynamics of parasites during an acute infection. The model
considers a generic population of parasites and it assumes that
the virulence of parasites is proportional to the rate of parasite
growth in the host. The results indicated that the transmission
would be more efficient if the parasite had an intermediate
growth rate (not as high as, for example, E. coli, and not as low as
M. tuberculosis). The authors argued that this would result in an
evolution and maintenance of an intermediate level of parasitic

virulence. A second work by Antia et al. (1996) considered a
different set of hypotheses for the dynamics of persistent parasitic
infections. This model predicts that initial persistence in the host
can be achieved by parasites that grow very slowly or by parasites
that have a niche that is inaccessible to the immune response.
In addition, the authors suggested that the evasion of immune
response by the pathogen at a time well after the onset of infection
may be a consequence of two processes: (1) deletion of T cells
in the thymus caused by the antigens; and (2) presence of a
maximum limit on the number of divisions of a T cell. In this
paper, we show that a refuge mechanism used by some bacteria
to persist in the host is the formation of a fibrin network that
confers protection against the immune response.

In our previous paper (Pigozzo et al., 2012), we were capable
of reproducing the initial formation of an abscess, but the abscess
pattern did not remain stable. One possible explanation is the
fact that S. aureus abscesses are encapsulated within a fibrin
capsule triggered upon secretion of two coagulases, Coa and
vWbp (Cheng et al., 2010; McAdow et al., 2012), which were not
modeled in our previous paper.

The objective of this paper is to construct a mathematical
model, based on partial differential equations (PDEs), that
essentially reproduces a pattern that is observed in histology
images of renal abscesses in mice (Cheng et al., 2009, 2010;
Graves et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; McAdow et al., 2012;
Kim et al., 2012). The pattern is comprised by the following
regions: )1) some region occupied by the bacteria colony (SAC);
(2) some region containing fibrin that forms a network around
a bacteria colony; and (3) surrounding the fibrin network, a
region comprised mainly of necrotic neutrophils and some live
neutrophils. Figure 1 shows these regions and how they appear
in the results of the computational simulations of this paper.
In addition, we study and analyze the characteristics of distinct
models involving the interactions between bacteria, the two
coagulases or coagulation factors, Coa and vWbp, fibrin and
neutrophils. This paper shows that it is possible to reproduce
some aspects of abscess formation through computational
models that are able to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics
of the fibrin network formation around the bacteria colony as
well as the neutrophil response to the bacterial infection. The
computational models were implemented using an explicit Euler
method for time discretization and, for the spatial discretization,
the Finite Volume Method (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2011), as
will be described in the following section.

The rest of the text is organized as follow. First, we describe
the characteristics of the mathematical models developed in
this paper and the numerical methods employed in the
implementation. Then, we present the results of computational
simulations with the models and, finally, we discuss limitations
and future work and draw our conclusions.

as growth, death and interaction terms and they have terms that
are responsible for modeling the movement of cells, molecules
and bacteria through the diffusion process. The majority of PDEs
presented in this paper have the following structure in common:

∂u

∂t
= f g + D∇ · (g ∇u),

u(x, 0) = u0,
∂u(., t)

∂En
|∂� = 0, (1)

where u is a variable that refers to a given population, the
term f is a function that models the growth of u and the term
D∇ · (g ∇u) models the nonlinear diffusion of u. Function g is
equivalent to the g function proposed in (Painter and Sherratt,
2003). This function was originally developed to model the
movement of interacting cell populations (Painter and Sherratt,
2003). We extended it to model interactions that also occur in
other cellular processes. For example, we use the g function

to model interactions that occur during bacterial growth or
neutrophil migration. The g function is used to account for
different interaction strengths between the populations and the
effects of these in processes of growth, phagocytosis, migration,
death and diffusion.

The g function is defined as the heaviside function of g:

g(w) =

{

g(w), 0 ≤ g(w) ≤ 1

0, otherwise.
(2)

Function g(w) is defined as:

g(w) = 1−
w

total
, (3)

where w is a term that models the interactions between distinct
populations and total is a parameter that denotes the maximum
population supported in a discretized region of the domain. In

Pigozzo et al. Development of a Computational Model of Abscess Formation

this work, we consider that the value of total is constant and is
equal to 1 for all discretized regions.

The interactions between the populations can be stimulatory
or inhibitory. In this paper, we consider only inhibitory
interactions in the w term. To illustrate the meaning of w,
consider, for example, a system with two types of populations:
u and v. The interactions that each population has with the other
one are modeled by the w term. Therefore, the w term is defined
for each distinct population in the system. For example, the w for
the u population is defined as:

wu = wuu u+ wvu v, (4)

wherewuu u is the inhibition that u exerts on itself andwvu v is the
inhibition that v exerts on u. These inhibitory relations will affect
all processes in u dynamics.wuu andwvu are constant parameters.
We call these parameters “weights” to refer to the fact that they
control the strength of the inhibition that one population exerts
on the other.

The g function for the u population is:

g(wu) = 1− wu. (5)

For the v population, we have:

wv = wvv v+ wuv u, (6)

wherewvv v is the inhibition that v exerts on itself andwuv u is the
inhibition that u exerts on v. These inhibitory relations will affect
all processes in v dynamics. wvv and wuv are constant parameters.
The g function for the v population is:

g(wv) = 1− wv. (7)

We can extend the definition of w for a system with n distinct
populations. Considering the u population again, wu is defined
as:

wu = wuu u+
∑

j∈C,
j 6=u

wju j, (8)

where C is the set of all distinct populations in the system
and j is one of these populations that is different from u. The
summation accounts for the inhibition that u suffers from all
other populations, with wju being the strength of the inhibition
that j population exerts on u.

We can also interpret the g function as a way to model the
effect that the lack of space has in the dynamics of a population
because its value can be seen as the amount of available space in
a discretized region of the domain. Considering that all regions
in the domain support a maximum number of cells, molecules
and/or bacteria (denoted by total), diffusion cannot occur for
fully occupied regions where there is no available space. In these
regions, we have w ≥ total which implies that w

total
≥ 1 and

g(w) ≤ 0 and, as a result, g(w) of Equation 2 is zero.
The diffusion of bacteria has another term, h(b), that models

their cooperative behavior. The bacteria diffusion term is defined
as:

Db∇ · (gb(wb) h(b)∇b), (9)

where gb(wb) is the bacteria g function and wb is the bacteria
interaction term. The function h(b) models a behavior where
the bacteria colony grows when conditions are favorable and the
colony density is high. The bacteria will only colonize nearby
regions when they were successful in establishing a colony in
their current location. As a consequence of this, in our model,
the diffusion of bacteria only occurs when bacteria concentration
is above a threshold. The function h(b) is defined as:

h(b) =
(α + 1) bγ

α + bγ
. (10)

This equation is a hyperbolic saturation function (Haefner, 2005)
and it is known as Hill equation in this form (Goutelle et al.,
2008). The Hill equation is used, for example, to model the
relationship between drug concentration and its effects (Wagner,
1968). In this equation, the term α + 1 scales the maximum
value to which the function is asymptotic, parameter α is a half
saturation constant and γ is a shape parameter (Haefner, 2005).
It is important tomention that the term h(b) is only present in the
diffusion of bacteria. If we consider that the cooperative behavior
is absent by doing h(h) = 1, we have a situation where, even
for a region with very few bacteria, the bacteria can diffuse to
neighboring regions with available space and, as a result, it is hard
for the bacteria to form a colony surrounded by fibrin because
some bacteria will always “escape.” Therefore, in our model,
such cooperative behavior as well as the nonlinear diffusion are
important to the formation of the abscess pattern.

In all models, the exchange between the vascular system
(arterioles and vessels) and the tissue was assumed to occur in
all points of the one-dimensional space. This is a reasonable first
approach because the kidney is highly vascularized.

The numerical methods used were the following: (1) explicit
Euler method for time discretization; and (2) for spatial
discretization, we used the Finite Volume Method (FVM)
(Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2011). The nonlinear diffusion was
implemented with a method based on FVM, where the calculus
of the divergent operator is based on the quantities calculated
at the two interfaces (left and right) of the finite volume. The
derivatives and the gradient operator are approximated with
numerical fluxes calculated at the interfaces. The quantities at
each interface are an average of the quantities on the neighboring
nodes. In summary, FVM is based on the evaluation of influx and
outflux in a control volume around each node in the mesh. The
code was implemented in C and the graphs were generated with
a script in Python.

3. RESULTS

In this paper, we incrementally build a mathematical model
of abscess formation. The interactions between the model’s
components are depicted in Figure 2. It is important to highlight
that the intensity of a particular inhibitory relation (in Figure 2,
inhibitory relations are represented by red arrows with the word
inhibition) depends on concentrations of the cellular types that
are exerting the inhibition. In the next sections, we will discuss

each of these relations and we will present the characteristics of
each submodel that is part of the abscess formation model.

3.1. Bacteria-Coa/vWbp-Fibrin Model
The first model accounts for the interaction between bacteria,
Coa/vWbp and fibrin. The objective of this model is to reproduce
the formation of a fibrin network around the bacteria colony.
In this model, we have the bacteria replicating and producing
two coagulation factors: coagulase (Coa) and von Willebrand
factor Binding Protein (vWbp). These coagulation factors are
responsible for converting fibrinogen into fibrin.

The model is comprised by the following system of equations:

∂coa

∂t
= k b gcoa(b, f , coa)+ Dcoa coa_diffusion(),

coa(x, 0) = coa0,
∂coa(., t)

∂En
|∂� = 0,

∂b

∂t
= r b gb(b, f , coa)+ Db b_diffusion(),

b(x, 0) = b0,
∂b(., t)

∂En
|∂� = 0,

f = b coa, (11)

where the term coa denotes the coagulation factors Coa and
vWbp, b denotes the bacteria and f denotes fibrin. The
functions gcoa(b, f , coa) and gb(b, f , coa) are the g functions of
Coa and bacteria, respectively. The functions coa_diffusion()
and b_diffusion() models Coa/vWbp and bacteria diffusion,
respectively. The diffusion is modeled in two ways: (1) with
the classic diffusion operator (diffusion terms in the System of
Equation 14); and (2) with the nonlinear diffusion given by
15 and 16. In the next section, we show the simulation results
with both diffusion operators. Diffusion is the net movement

of molecules or atoms from a region of high concentration (or
high chemical potential) to a region of low concentration (or low
chemical potential) as a result of randommotion of themolecules
or atoms.

The equation f = b coa models fibrin formation. We assume
that fibrin formation depends on the interaction between the
bacteria and the coagulation factors.

The term k.b.gcoa(b, f , coa) denotes the Coa/vWbp production,
where k is the production rate. The function gcoa(b, f , coa) is given
by:

gcoa(b, f , coa) = 1− (wbcoa b+ wfcoa f + wcoacoa coa). (12)

The parameterswbcoa,wcoacoa andwfcoa represent the influence of
bacteria, Coa/vWbp and fibrin in Coa/vWbp dynamics.

The Coa/vWbp production is limited by the available space
and is inhibited by bacteria and Coa/vWbp molecules that are
in the same discretized region. This inhibition is considered to
simulate the coagulation factors spreading from the border of the
bacteria colony and also to simulate the fibrin network formation
on this border.

The term r.b.gb(b, f , coa) denotes the bacteria replication,
where r is the replication rate. The function gb(b, f , coa) is given
by:

gb(b, f , coa) = 1− (wbb b+ wfb f + wcoab coa). (13)

The parameters wbb, wcoab and wfb represent the influence of
bacteria, Coa/vWbp and fibrin in bacteria dynamics.

The bacteria replication is limited by the available space and
is inhibited by Coa/vWbp molecules and the fibrin network. The
Coa/vWbp inhibition is justified by the fact that, when the colony
is being formed, the bacteria inside the colony will alter their
behavior and, consequently, will decrease replication and focus

on protecting themselves with the fibrin network. The fibrin
network inhibition is considered to simulate that bacteria colony
cannot replicate and expand over fibrin to other regions after the
formation of the fibrin network.

3.1.1. One-Dimensional Simulations

With the objective of understanding the spatiotemporal behavior
of the bacteria-Coa/vWbp-fibrinmodel, the diffusion process was
added to the model (Equation 14) and numerical simulations
were carried out on a one-dimensional domain:

∂coa

∂t
= k b gcoa(b, f , coa)+ Dcoa

∂2coa

∂2b

∂x2

b(x, 0) = b0,
∂b(., t)

∂En
|∂� = 0

f = b coa (14)

Dcoa
∂2coa
∂x2

and Db
∂2b
∂x2

are the diffusion terms of Coa/vWbp
and bacteria, respectively, where Dcoa and Db are the diffusion
coefficients.

In spite of S. aureus not being a motile organism, we
considered a diffusion process for S. aureus to simulate the
bacterial expansion as the bacteria replicate and increase in
number, having as a consequence an increase in the region
occupied by the bacteria colony. We chose a small diffusion
coefficient for the bacteria (Db = 0.05) to simulate the
aforementioned aspect of S. aureus infections.

Themodel’s initial conditions and parameters are presented in
Tables 1, 2, respectively. In our simulations, we assumed a one-
dimensional domain of 10 mm length and a simulation time of
20 days. In fact, this one-dimensional model is a simplification
of a 3D block model in that we have assumed that the lengths
associated with y and z are much smaller than the length
associated with x. In all PDEs, the domain is homogeneous and
the boundary conditions are of Neumann type.

Bacteria are initially placed in the middle of the domain,
neutrophils and the coagulation factors are placed initially with
a small concentration all over the domain. The bacteria initial
location can be seen as the set of points (arterioles) where bacteria
extravasate from the vasculature to the kidney tissue.

In all computational simulations we used the parameters
values presented in Table 2, except when we vary some
parameters to simulate different scenarios and, in these cases, we
highlight what are the new values employed.

Due to the lack of experimental data and the difficult in
making a direct correlation between some measured biological
quantities and the parameters of the models, the parameters
values were chosen to illustrate the different behaviors that the
models are capable of reproducing.

We observe in Figure 3A that, with time, the bacteria replicate
and the bacteria colony increases in size. As a result, the
production of the coagulation factors Coa/vWbp increases. With
time, Coa/vWbp is converted to fibrin. The fibrin has some

influence in bacteria’s growth but fibrin was not able to prevent
the spread of bacteria around the initial site of infection. We
believe this happened because fibrin is not influencing bacteria
diffusion as it influences bacterial growth. Therefore the bacteria
colony can spread to other areas of the tissue. The spatial pattern
seen in this result does not resemble the abscess pattern because
we cannot observe the formation of one or more colonies of
bacteria surrounded by fibrin.

In the simulated scenario described previously, we
implemented the classical diffusion operator that does not
consider any external influence in the diffusion of a population.
In some situations, this hypothesis that the diffusion of a cell
is not influenced by any other cell or molecule present in the
system is not true. In the human body, a cell can interact with

dozens of cells in a short period of time. Due to this fact, a cell
can have many of its processes influenced by these interactions.
Besides, space in the body is limited therefore the volume of
some part of a tissue supports a maximum concentration of cells,
molecules, liquids and other substances. The nonlinear diffusion
models the influence of a cell population in the diffusion of other
cell population. To represent the influence of both fibrin and
Coa/vWbp in bacteria diffusion, the diffusion term of bacteria is
defined as:

Db∇ · (gb(b, f , coa) h(b)∇b), (15)

where gb(b, f , coa) models the influence resulting from the
interactions between bacteria, Coa/vWbp and fibrin. The term

h(b) models the cooperative behavior of bacteria and was defined
in Equation 10. The diffusion of Coa/vWbp is defined as:

Dcoa∇ · (gcoa(b, f , coa)∇coa). (16)

The nonlinear diffusion simulates the fact that bacteria colonies
will be unable to expand to some points where fibrin
concentration is sufficiently high reproducing, in this way, the
formation of a fibrin network around the colonies. The fibrin
network acts like a barrier preventing any cell to cross it. We will
show that these hypotheses are important in the development of
a mathematical model of abscess formation.

Pigozzo et al. Development of a Computational Model of Abscess Formation

Incorporating the nonlinear diffusion terms in the PDEs, we
obtain the following system:

∂coa

∂t
= k b gcoa(b, f , coa)+ Dcoa∇ · (gcoa(b, f , coa)∇coa),

∂b

∂t
= r b gb(b, f , coa)+ Db∇ · (gb(b, f , coa) h(b)∇b),

f = b coa. (17)

The results obtained with numerical simulations of these
equations are shown in Figure 3B. We observe that, initially,
the bacteria colony grows and starts to expand. At the same
time, the bacteria produce the coagulation factors Coa/vWbp.
The concentration of these factors increases and they convert
fibrinogen, present in the body and that is not explicitly
considered here, to fibrin. In addition, the fibrin concentration
increases and we can see that fibrin is located around the bacteria
colony. Both coagulation factors and fibrin interacts with bacteria
preventing them to colonize other parts of the tissue. This process
reflects the quorum sensing behavior seen in S. aureus infections.

Quorum sensing (Painter and Hillen, 2002; Yarwood and
Schlievert, 2003; Le and Otto, 2015) is the process by which
microorganisms regulate population density through chemical
signaling. Chemical molecules secreted by microorganisms are
a form of intra- and interspecies communication that helps
bacteria coordinate their behavior. Quorum sensing allows to
modulate diverse characteristics of the microorganisms, such as
the motility, production of virulence factors and the formation
of biofilms. In staphylococci, the ability to sense the bacterial
density, or quorum, and to respond with genetic adaptations is
an important mechanism to bacteria survival in the host (Le and
Otto, 2015).

The nonlinear diffusion improved the model result, making it
possible to obtain a pattern more similar to an abscess. However,
abscesses are also composed by dead and live neutrophils. To
reproduce the complete pattern, it is necessary to include these
types of cell in the model.We will start including live neutrophils,
and then dead neutrophils and toxins will be included. We will
use the PDEs system given by Equations 17 as a base for further
developments of our mathematical model of abscess formation.

3.2. Bacteria-Neutrophil Model
The model of interaction between bacteria and neutrophil, called
bacteria-neutrophil model, is similar to the bacteria-Coa/vWbp-
fibrin model presented previously in section 3.1. The neutrophil
migration depends on bacteria concentration as the production
of Coa/vWbp. The neutrophil has also a g function that is present
in both growth and diffusion terms.

The bacteria-neutrophil model is comprised by the following
set of PDEs:

∂b

∂t
= (r − l n) b gb(b, n)+ Db∇ · (gb(b, n) h(b)∇b)),

∂n

∂t
= s b n gn(b, n)+ Dn∇ · (gn(b, n)∇n)). (18)

The variable n denotes neutrophil concentration and the variable
b denotes bacteria concentration. The term s.b.n.gn(b, n) models

neutrophil migration. Product b.n in term s.b.n.gn(b, n) can be
interpreted as the pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The
pro-inflammatory cytokines would have the effect of attracting
more neutrophils to the infection site. For the sake of simplicity,
these cytokines are not considered explicitly in this model.
The term r.b.gb(b, n) represents bacteria replication. Bacteria
phagocytosis is denoted by the term l.n.b.gb(b, n). The model
has two g functions: (1) gb(b, n) for bacteria; and (2) gn(b, n) for
neutrophils.

The g functions equations are given by:

gb(b, n) = 1− (wbb.b+ wnb.n),

gn(b, n) = 1− (wbn.b+ wnn.n). (19)

The model’s parameters are: (1) r is the bacteria replication rate;
(2) l is the phagocytosis rate; (3) wbb is the influence of bacteria
on its own dynamics; (4) wnb is the influence of neutrophils on
bacteria dynamics; (5) s is the neutrophil migration rate; (6) wbn
is the influence of bacteria on neutrophils dynamics; and (7) wnn
is the influence of neutrophils on its own dynamics.

3.2.1. One-Dimensional Simulations

With the objective of analyzing the spatiotemporal behavior of
bacteria-neutrophil model, one-dimensional simulations of the
Equation 18 were performed. In the simulations performed,
we observed three main behaviors: (1) the formation of a
bacteria colony when considering a small phagocytosis rate;
(2) a disseminated infection when small rates for phagocytosis
and for neutrophil migration are considered; and (3) infection
control with complete elimination of bacteria when considering
a “normal” immune response.

Values of parameters s (rate of neutrophil migration) and l
(rate of phagocytosis) were varied in three different scenarios:
(1) small phagocytosis rate: s = 10 and l = 20 (Figure 4A); (2)
small rates for phagocytosis and neutrophil migration: s = 5 and
l = 20 (Figure 4B); and (3) “normal” values for phagocytosis and
neutrophil migration: s = 10 and l = 40 (Figure 4C).

The first scenario is presented in Figure 4A. This scenario
simulates the mechanisms employed by bacteria to escape
phagocytosis by immune cells.We observe that neutrophils begin
to migrate to the tissue in an attempt to control the infection,
but they are not able to phagocytose bacteria efficiently. As a
consequence, the bacteria colony grows and expands around the
initial site of infection.

The second scenario (Figure 4B) simulates a deficient
immune response where it is considered an impairment in
neutrophil migration caused by bacteria, besides the impairment
in phagocytosis. It is observed that the bacteria colony can
rapidly expand to other areas of the tissue without the presence
of neutrophils. Neutrophil migration is impaired and there are
almost no neutrophils to fight the infection. Eventually, with
time, the bacteria will spread to larger areas of the tissue.

In the last simulated scenario (Figure 4C), we considered
a normal immune response. We observe that the bacteria
were completely eliminated by neutrophils. Neutrophils were
successful in controlling the infection due to rapid migration and
efficient killing of bacteria. After bacteria elimination, the spatial

distribution of neutrophils tend to stabilize throughout the tissue
due to the fact that we have notmodeled the neutrophil apoptosis.

3.3. Bacteria-Coa/vWbp-Fibrin-Neutrophil
Model
The bacteria-Coa/vWbp-fibrin-neutrophil model is an extension
combining the two models presented previously: the bacteria-
Coa/vWbp-fibrin model and the bacteria-neutrophil model. The
objective of this model is to reproduce, in addition to the
formation of one or more colonies of bacteria surrounded by
fibrin, the spatial distribution of neutrophils inside the abscess
lesion. The model is comprised by the following PDEs system:

∂coa

∂t
= k b gcoa(b, f , coa, n)+ Dcoa∇ · (gcoa(b, f , coa, n)∇coa),

∂b

∂t
= (r − l n) b gb(b, f , coa, n)+ Db∇ · (gb(b, f , coa, n) h(b)∇b),

f = b coa,

∂n

∂t
= s b n gn(b, f , coa, n)+ Dn∇ · (gn(b, f , coa, n)∇n). (20)

The equation f = b coamodels fibrin formation. The g functions
now depend on four types of populations: bacteria, Coa/vWbp,
fibrin and neutrophil. The new g functions are given by:

gcoa(b, f , coa, n) = (1− wbcoa b− wfcoa f − wcoacoa coa− wncoa n),

gb(b, f , coa, n) = (1− wbb b− wfb f − wcoab coa− wnb n),

gn(b, f , coa, n) = (1− wbn b− wfn f − wcoan coa− wnn n). (21)

It is important to highlight that when choosing n = 0 in Equation
20, we obtain the bacteria-Coa/vWbp-fibrin model presented in

Equation 17. In addition, when we consider coa = 0 and f = 0 in
Equation 20, we obtain the bacteria-neutrophil model presented
in Equation 18.

The parameters of the model are: (1) k is the Coa/vWbp
production rate; (2) r is the rate of bacteria replication; (3) l is
the rate of phagocytosis; (4) s is the neutrophil migration rate; (5)
wbcoa, wfcoa, wcoacoa and wncoa are the influence of bacteria, fibrin,
Coa/vWbp and neutrophil, respectively, in Coa/vWbp dynamics;
(6) wbb, wfb, wcoab and wnb are the influence of bacteria, fibrin,
Coa/vWbp and neutrophil, respectively, in bacteria dynamics;
(7) wbn, wfn, wcoan and wnn are the influence of bacteria,
fibrin, Coa/vWbp and neutrophil, respectively, in neutrophil
dynamics; and (8) Dcoa, Db and Dn are the diffusion coefficients
of Coa/vWbp, bacteria and neutrophil, respectively.

In this model, we consider, besides fibrin influence in the
dynamics of bacteria, also their influence in the dynamics of
neutrophil. The influence is reflected in the fact that when fibrin
concentration is sufficiently high, fibrin prevents neutrophils
from getting closer to the bacteria colonies. It is important
to highlight that phagocytosis is also influenced by fibrin.
Depending on fibrin’s location in the domain, for example, if
fibrin is located around a bacteria colony it will protect bacteria
from being phagocytized by neutrophils outside the colony.
Neutrophils inside the colony are not capable of handling the
infection alone.

3.3.1. One-Dimensional Simulations

We first present and compare the results of two scenarios: (1) a
scenario with the coagulation factors production rate k equals to

Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1355

Pigozzo et al. Development of a Computational Model of Abscess Formation

2; and (2) a scenario with the coagulation factors production rate
k equals to 0.4.

The first scenario is presented in Figure 5A. We can observe
that neutrophils have been able to enter the site of the colony of
bacteria, but were not able to eliminate them after saturation of
several points of the domain. The saturation ocurred also due to
the production of the coagulation factors and fibrin formation.
This scenario illustrates a limitation of the model: after saturation
of a domain position, neutrophils cannot phagocytose bacteria
there anymore. We observed that saturation occurred because
parameter wbn has a great impact in the model results together
with the initial condition. If the product wbn.b is sufficiently high,
in some points of the domain, few neutrophils can migrate to the
tissue before it saturates. As a consequence, these neutrophils are
not in sufficient number to eliminate all bacteria there. Another
limitation is the fact that we are not considering any mechanism
used by the bacteria to kill neutrophils. As a result, we have the

stabilization of cells populations with a considerable amount of
neutrophils inside the bacteria colony. These limitations were
the primary motivation for the development of an extension
of the current model by adding a variable that represents the
toxins produced by the bacteria. Toxins are also important for
the persistence of bacteria in the host. Basically, we can assume
that toxins interact with neutrophils causing their death.

The second scenario (Figure 5B) shows that when we decrease
the value of Coa/vWbp production (parameter k) to 0.4 and,
consequently, decreasing the fibrin formation, the bacteria are
completely eliminated. This scenario illustrates the importance
of fibrin in protecting the bacteria.

The simulations with bacteria-Coa/vWbp-fibrin-neutrophil
model allowed us to better understand the effect of each
parameter in the dynamics of the model. We have observed that,
for the immune response to be effective, the rate of neutrophil
migration cannot be so high because the regions with bacteria

FIGURE 5 | Spatial distribution of bacteria, fibrin and neutrophil concentrations in the comparison between the scenario with k = 2 (A on the left) and the scenario

with k = 0.4 (B on the right). The y-axis (concentration) represents the fraction occupied by a particular population in a discretized region of the domain. The x-axis (x)

represents the space in mm. The simulated time correspond to 20 days. Each line represents a particular day. The simulation starts at day 0 and finishes at day 20.

(A) shows that the neutrophils that migrate into the tissue phagocytose part of the colony of bacteria until saturation occurs in regions where there are neutrophils and

bacteria. At this time, no more phagocytosis occurs. In (B), the colony of bacteria cannot produce fibrin fast enough to protect itself and it is eliminated.

Pigozzo et al. Development of a Computational Model of Abscess Formation

could saturate rapidly and, in this case, neutrophils could no
longer eliminate the bacteria. We have also observed that the rate
of phagocytosis has an important role in model dynamics. The
elimination of bacteria was only obtained when we considered a
high phagocytosis rate combined with a moderate migration rate
and a small rate for Coa/vWbp production.

3.4. Bacteria-Coa/vWbp-Fibrin-Neutrophil-
Toxin Model
The previous model (Equation 20) can be modified to better
understand the effects of toxins produced by Staphylococcus
aureus. The toxins also contribute to the persistence of S. aureus
in the host (Cheng et al., 2009, 2010). The role of toxins is to
mantain cells of the immune system, mainly neutrophils, away
from the colony of S. aureus. Even after the formation of the
fibrin network, S. aureus bacteria continue to produce several
types of toxins, which, because of their small volume, are able
to pass through the fibrin network and reach the regions where
most living neutrophils are migrating to the infected tissue.

It is important to highlight that the immune system of wild
type mice as well as the immune system of humans is efficient in
eliminating dead cells from tissue, cleaning the infection site. This
cleansing would allow neutrophils and other immune system
cells to approach the fibrin network around the bacterial colony,
threatening to dissolve (to break down) this network to gain
access to the colony of bacteria, but the toxins may prevent this
process (Guggenberger et al., 2012; McAdow et al., 2012).

It was considered a simplifiedmodel of toxin’s dynamics based
on the following hypothesis:

• The production of toxins depends on bacteria concentration,
having a saturation. This production is not influenced by other
cells;

• The toxins cause the death of neutrophils at a rate that is
proportional to the concentration of both;

• It is considered that the diffusion of toxins is not influenced by
the presence of other cells;

• Both toxins and dead neutrophils do not influence the growth
and diffusion of other cell types.

It is assumed that the volume of toxins and of dead neutrophils
are negligible in relation to the volumes of other cells, therefore
they are not considered in the g functions.

The model is composed by the following PDEs system:

∂coa

∂t
= k.b.gcoa(b, f , coa, n)+ Dcoa∇ · (gcoa(b, f , coa, n).∇coa),

∂b

∂t
= (r − l.n).b.gb(b, f , coa, n)+ Db∇ · (gb(b, f , coa, n).h(b).∇b),

f = b coa,

∂n

∂t
= s.b.n.gn(b, f , coa, n)− αto.to.n+ Dn∇ · (gn(b, f , coa, n).∇n),

∂to

∂t
= βto.b.(1− to)− µto.to+ Dto.1to,

∂nd

∂t
= αto.to.n, (22)

where toxins represented by to and dead neutrophils represented
by nd are the new populations added to the model. Term

βto.b.(1 − to) denotes toxin production, where βto is the
production rate. Term µto.to denotes toxin decay and term
Dto.1to denotes toxin diffusion withµto being the decay rate and
Dto being the diffusion coefficient. Neutrophils in contact with
toxins die at a rate αto that is proportional to the concentration
of both (term αto.to.n). The g functions are the same as in the
previous model.

3.4.1. One-Dimensional Simulations

Simulations in one dimension were carried out to understand
the new behaviors that can be obtained after the introduction
of the toxin. In simulations with the toxin model, we have used
the parameter values of the “normal” immune response (s = 10
and l = 40) scenario (Table 2) with the exception of Coa/vWbp
production rate k which we varied in the two scenarios presented
here. The values of the new parameters that were incorporated
into the model are: βto = 0.5,µto = 0.5,Dto = 2, and αto = 0.7.

In the first scenario presented in Figure 6A, we considered
k = 2. We observe, in Panel A, that as the toxin diffuses through
the tissue, it causes a lot of death in the region occupied by
the bacteria colony. As a consequence, a concentration of dead
neutrophils is observed at the infection site. The toxins helped
bacteria to establish a favorable environment to persist.

One interesting result is observed when we consider a smaller
Coa/vWbp production rate (k = 0.5) in second scenario
(Figure 6B). In this case, we see the formation of two abscesses
next to each other. Neutrophils migrate in the middle of
the domain where the concentration of bacteria is high and
phagocyte bacteria there. Neutrophils start to die due to the
action of toxins. The toxins together with saturation after fibrin
formation prevent neutrophils to eliminate bacteria completely
and, as a result, there are the formation of two abscesses. In
histology images of mice kidneys infected with S. aureus, it
is also observed, in many situations, the formation of one or
more abscesses (Cheng et al., 2009, 2010; Kim et al., 2011,
2012)

4. DISCUSSION

In the mathematical models developed in this paper, we have
considered the influence of a population on the dynamics
of other population. This influence represents not only
the lack of available space due to the volume occupied
by distinct populations in a discretized region but also
represents other types of interactions such as inhibitory or
stimulatory interactions. These interactions are modeled through
the use of the g function presented first in section 2.
The interactions between different populations were modeled
through the product of their concentration by constant
parameters. We can also model these interactions by considering
some function of various parameters. However, in order to
avoid introducing complexity into the model and trying to
better understand its behavior, we have chosen more simplified
interactions.

Numerical simulations were important for us to understand
the effects of the g function not only on the growth terms but
also on the processes of movement. As shown in Figure 3A,

located near the middle of the domain. This results in a separation of the initial colony in two. These newly formed colonies have time to produce sufficient fibrin to

protect themselves, surviving in the host.

Pigozzo et al. Development of a Computational Model of Abscess Formation

without considering the g function in the diffusion terms, it
was not possible to obtain a pattern similar to an abscess. This
happened because bacteria and fibrin could move freely through
the domain. There was nothing to stop them from moving
to a location already containing a large concentration of cells,
molecules and other substances. The incorporation of the g
function into the diffusion, in this case, allowed us to model a
behavior that is believed to be more real in this situation: an
adaptive behavior in which populations adapt to the environment
around them. This adaptation occurs due to the lack of space, but
it could be due to the lack of nutrients, for example. With the
g function, it is possible to react to changes in the environment
avoiding a situation where more populations are created in a
place where this creation would not be possible anymore.

We think that the effect of the g function on the movement
of populations contributes to stabilize their spatial distributions.
Studies on parasitoid–host interaction and on predator-prey
models (Briggs and Hoopes, 2004, and references therein) found
some spatial mechanisms resulting on stability or increased
persistence. One of these mechanisms is the limited dispersion of
populations. One of the effects of the g function, in this paper, is
to limit the diffusion at the cellular level. In the case of models
that consider patch dynamics, other important mechanisms
that contribute to persistence are: spatial heterogeneity and
asynchronous dynamics between patches (Briggs and Hoopes,
2004, and references therein).

It was possible to observe, with the simulations, that the
parameter wbn is important for the persistence of bacteria in the
host, because this parameter represents the influence that the
bacteria exert in neutrophil migration. The higher the value of
wbn, the lower the migration of neutrophils and the lower the
efficiency of neutrophil response. Another important parameter
is the rate of neutrophil migration s. We have observed that
this rate cannot be very high because a great concentration
of neutrophils would saturate rapidly the regions with bacteria
before eliminating them. But this rate cannot be small because
bacteria would spread throughout the domain. The model
results are also affected considerably by the rate of Coa/vWbp
production k. If this rate is below a threshold then we have a
scenario where bacteria are completely eliminated. Otherwise, we
have a scenario where bacteria persist in the host.

4.1. Limitations and Future Work
As limitations of this paper, we can note the fact that
the use of models based on differential equations requires
detailed knowledge about the parameters that are included
in the equations. Some of these parameters can be measured
experimentally, while others need to be estimated. In this paper,
we used parameter values for illustration purposes, they were not
estimated due to lack of sufficient experimental data.

As future work, we plan to better study the effects of toxins
and the different behaviors that could be obtained by considering
it. We also plan to study the effect of considering the migration
of cells ocurring only at some points of the domain, simulating
the presence of blood vessels at those points. Some numerical
simulations already performed using this specific scenario have
shown that the chemotaxis process of neutrophils has a major

impact in the result because the chemotaxis allows neutrophils
to reach the bacterial colony faster than when diffusion only
applies. This observation is in good agreement with our previous
observations (Pigozzo et al., 2013). Besides, we plan to add
pro-inflammatory cytokines to the model and to consider their
chemoattractant effect on immune system cells.

As a future work, we plan to build a more complete
model and validate it with distinct experimental data such as
histology images, values of bacteria load in the tissue, size
of abscess diameter, among others, obtained from various in
vivo experiments including the leukocyte depletion experiment
(Robertson et al., 2008; Navarini et al., 2009; Attia et al., 2013)
and the Coa/vWbp inhibition experiment (Vanassche et al., 2011,
2012; Flick et al., 2013). We plan to consider, in our model, the
use by the bacteria S. aureus of its sensory/regulatory systems
to adapt the production of virulence factors, specifically to a
triggering signal, e.g., neutrophils (Guerra et al., 2017). The
idea is to study how the interaction between S. aureus and
neutrophils provokes certain sensing and adaptive responses
used by S. aureus (Guerra et al., 2017).

In addition, we plan to extend the model to two and three-
dimensional domains, but we think that the behaviors that could
be obtained with two or three dimensions are the same that we
can obtain with the one-dimensional models because the spatial
mechanisms considered are not altered with the increase in the
number of dimensions.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have developed computational models based on
partial differential equations that were able to reproduce some
characteristics observed in the abscess formation process.

The study comprised the analysis of the spatiotemporal
behavior of bacteria, the coagulation factors Coa/vWbp, fibrin,
toxins and neutrophils. These analyses were important and
helped to understand how the modeled processes interact, the
effects of the incorporation of certain processes, among other
factors.

It was shown, in this paper, that the use of the g function
in the growth and diffusion terms of the populations was one
of the characteristics that allowed the mathematical models to
reproduce some key aspects of the abscess formation process.
Other important characteristic was the fibrin network formation.
The fibrin network protected bacteria from the immune
response given by the neutrophils. The formation of the fibrin
network was modeled considering the production of coagulation
factors and the interaction of these factors with the colony of
bacteria.

More tests and refinement of the model may be needed, but
this initial model was capable of reproducing some characteristics
found in the abscess pattern such as: the formation of a fibrin
network around the colonies of bacteria and an accumulation
of necrotic neutrophils and live neutrophils in the abscess
region.

Based on simulations results and on analyses done so far, we
believe that the fibrin network is essential for bacteria persistence

inside the abscess lesion together with the mechanisms used by
the bacteria to kill neutrophils such as the production of toxins
and mechanisms used to evade phagocytosis.

The abscess pattern can also be obtained by models other
than those based on PDEs. For example, Cellular Automata
(Zorzenon dos Santos and Coutinho, 2001;Moreira and Deutsch,
2002; Xiao et al., 2006), Colored Petri Nets (Carvalho et al.,
2015; Pennisi et al., 2016) and models based on Agents
(Gopalakrishnan et al., 2013; Chiacchio et al., 2014; Abar et al.,
2017) can also be used to capture this pattern of formation.
