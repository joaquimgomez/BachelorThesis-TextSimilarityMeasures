CD5L (CD5 molecule-like) is a secreted glycoprotein that controls key mechanisms in 
inflammatory responses, with involvement in processes such as infection, atherosclero-
sis, and cancer. In macrophages, CD5L promotes an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile 
in response to TLR activation. In the present study, we questioned whether CD5L is 
able to influence human macrophage plasticity, and drive its polarization toward any 
specific phenotype. We compared CD5L-induced phenotypic and functional changes 
to those caused by IFN/LPS, IL4, and IL10 in human monocytes. Phenotypic markers 
were quantified by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, and a mathematical algorithm was 
built for their analysis. Moreover, we compared ROS production, phagocytic capacity, 
and inflammatory responses to LPS. CD5L drove cells toward a polarization similar to 
that induced by IL10. Furthermore, IL10- and CD5L-treated macrophages showed 
increased LC3-II content and colocalization with acidic compartments, thereby pointing 
to the enhancement of autophagy-dependent processes. Accordingly, siRNA targeting 
ATG7 in THP1 cells blocked CD5L-induced CD163 and Mer tyrosine kinase mRNA 
and efferocytosis. In these cells, gene expression profiling and validation indicated the 
upregulation of the transcription factor ID3 by CD5L through ATG7. In agreement, ID3 
silencing reversed polarization by CD5L. Our data point to a significant contribution of 
CD5L-mediated autophagy to the induction of ID3 and provide the first evidence that 
CD5L drives macrophage polarization.

Macrophages are innate immune cells present in all vertebrate tissues. To ensure homeostasis, these 
cells respond to internal and external cues and exert trophic, regulatory, repair, and effector func-
tions (1). However, they are also involved in the pathogenesis of major human diseases, ranging 
from infections, atherosclerosis, chronic inflammatory diseases including arthritis and diabetes, 
degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer (2).

The functional diversity of macrophages can be attributed to 
their ability to alter their phenotype in response to changes in 
the microenvironment (3). This plasticity allows them to acquire 
a wide range of functions, from proinflammatory, pathogen-
eliminating, and subsequent tissue-damaging (referred to as 
M1 or classically activated macrophages) to anti-inflammatory, 
immunosuppressive, and wound-healing (referred to as M2 or 
alternatively activated) (4). In this context and given the inher-
ent plasticity of these cells, there is growing interest in applying 
knowledge of their polarization to treat human diseases. In 
this regard, the repolarization of macrophages might offer an 
attractive therapeutic approach in diseases such as cancer (5). 
Various subpopulations of polarized macrophages have been 
defined on the basis of their in vitro stimulation. M1 prototypic 
macrophages are induced by Th1 inflammatory cytokines, 
microbial factors, or a combination of the two. In turn, the M2 
subset comprises macrophages induced by exposure to Th2 
cytokines IL4 and IL13, immune complexes in combination 
with IL1β or LPS, glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory cytokines 
IL10 and TGFβ, or tumor microenvironmental factors such as 
IL6 and leukemia inhibitor factor (6, 7). Here, we adopted the 
macrophage nomenclature proposed by Murray et al. based on 
the activation stimulus, i.e., M-INF/LPS, M-IL4, and M-IL10, 
as well as M-dexamethasone (DXM), which have also been 
referred to as M1, M2a, and M2c, respectively (8). These mac-
rophage subsets have been classified on the basis of their gene 
signatures, activation signaling pathways, surface molecule 
expression pattern, secretory profile, and functional properties 
(6, 7, 9–12). However, in this regard, most studies have been 
performed in murine models. Although these models have led 
to great advances, they show important discrepancies with the 
human. Moreover, information regarding human macrophage 
polarization is limited and scattered, especially regarding 
functional characterization. These observations thus highlight 
the urgent need for further advancement of our knowledge of 
human macrophage polarization (5).

Macrophages are the main source of CD5-like protein (CD5L), 
a 40-kDa soluble glycoprotein that belongs to the scavenger 
receptor cysteine rich superfamily (13). CD5L is involved in a 
broad spectrum of biological functions (14). Various mouse 
models of disease support the notion that CD5L participates in 
the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes, including cancer, 
by preventing the apoptosis of macrophages and other cell types 
(15–20). Human CD5L has also been shown to modulate other 
aspects of macrophage biology, namely anti-microbial responses 
to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (21) and TLR activation through 
increased autophagic mechanisms (22, 23). Moreover, CD5L 
contributes to atherogenesis by promoting oxLDL uptake and to 
macrophage-endothelial cell adhesion (24).

CD5L circulates in serum in relatively high amounts (25), 
and results of proteomic profiling highlight it as a putative serum 
biomarker for inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis 
(26), Kawasaky disease as well as liver cirrhosis (27–29). These 
significant alterations of plasma CD5L levels, together with the 
reports on its control of macrophage responses, have consistently 
suggested a functional role of this protein in host inflammatory 
reactions.

Like for many key modulators of macrophage activity, CD5L 
expression is tightly regulated in cells and tissues (20, 30, 31), 
being upregulated under inflammatory conditions and also dur-
ing cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies. Likewise, in vitro 
cultured macrophages do not express CD5L unless they have 
been previously activated with specific stimuli (19, 24, 32).

Here, we studied the involvement of CD5L in human mac-
rophage polarization. To this end, we performed a comprehensive 
analysis of human macrophages polarized in vitro. Using a novel 
mathematical algorithm to analyze phenotypic changes, together 
with functional studies, we reveal for the first time that—like 
IL10—CD5L drives macrophages toward an M2 phenotype. In 
addition, CD5L expression was restricted to those macrophages 
treated with IL10. Furthermore, our results provide the first evi-
dence that CD5L involvement in M2 macrophage polarization 
is dependent on autophagic mechanisms and ID3 transcription 
factor.

Primary cells and cell lines
All studies involving human samples were conducted following 
the Declaration of Helsinki principles and current legislation on 
the confidentiality of personal data and were approved by the 
Human Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitari Germans 
Trias i Pujol. Buffy coats, provided by the Blood and Tissue Bank 
(Barcelona, Spain), were obtained from healthy blood donors 
following the institutional standard operating procedures for 
blood donation and processing, including informed consent. 
CD3+ cells were depleted by RosetteSep human CD3 depletion 
cocktail (StemCell Technologies). Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) were isolated as described previously (23) by 
Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation at 
400 × g for 25 min. Recovered cells were washed twice in PBS and 
counted using Perfect-Count microspheres (Cytognos), following 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Peripheral blood monocytes (PB 
monocytes) were isolated by adherence in a 5% CO2 incubator 
at 37°C in RPMI-1640 2 mM glutamine (Lonza) supplemented 
with 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 30 min. Non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells 
were washed twice with PBS and incubated in RPMI-1640 2 mM 
glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Lonza), 
100  U/mL penicillin, and 100  µg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-
Aldrich) for 24  h prior to the experiments. The percentage of 
adherent CD14+ cells (PB monocytes) routinely obtained was 
94.98% (±3.26%). In phagocytosis assays, PB monocytes were 
differentiated by incubation in RPMI 10% heat-inactivated FBS 
for 7 days prior to the experiments, as described previously (24).

Stably transfected THP1-vector and THP1-CD5L cell lines 
were generated as described in Amézaga et al. (24). Cells were 
grown in culture medium (RPMI-1640 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/
mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin) supplemented with 
10% heat-inactivated FBS and 250  µg/mL geneticin (Gibco). 
Prior to the experiments, cells were differentiated to macrophages 
by incubation with 10 ng/mL of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) in culture medium for 24 h. They were

then washed with PBS and grown in culture medium for 24 h. 
These cells are referred to as THP1. HepG2 cells were purchased 
from ATCC (The American Type Culture Collection) and cul-
tured in EMEM supplemented with 2  mM glutamine (Lonza), 
100  U/mL penicillin, 100  µg/mL streptomycin, and 10% heat-
inactivated FBS.

In Vitro Polarization of Macrophages
PB monocytes and THP1 macrophages were polarized by 
incubation during the indicated times with 50  ng/mL IFNγ 
(Preprotech) plus 100 ng/mL LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 
(Sigma-Aldrich) (INF/LPS), 40 ng/mL IL4 (Preprotech), 50 ng/
mL IL10 (Preprotech), or 40  ng/mL DXM (Kern pharma). 
The control population was incubated in culture medium (−) 
without polarizing cytokines. To assess the effect of human 
CD5L (Homo sapiens CD5L, hsCD5L) on PB monocytes, these 
cells were incubated with 1 µg/mL albumin (Alb) purified from 
human plasma (Grifols), which was used as control protein, or 
1 µg/mL endotoxin-free recombinant CD5L (rCD5L) expressed 
in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, as detailed in Ref. (24). As a 
positive control of CD5L mRNA upregulation, cells were treated 
with 1 µM T1317 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), plus 1 µM 9cRa 
(Sigma-Aldrich).

Multicolor Flow cytometry analysis
PB monocytes (106 cells/well) were plated in six-well plates 
and incubated for 72  h with the polarizing stimuli at a final 
concentration of 5% FBS. They were then detached with accutase 
(Sigma-Aldrich), washed in PBS, and incubated with 100 µL of 
blocking buffer [PBS containing 10% human AB serum (Sigma-
Aldrich), 2% FCS (Lonza), and 0.02% NaN3 (Sigma-Aldrich)]. 
Cells were then labeled in brilliant stain buffer (BD Bioscience) 
with a combination of fluorescently conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies against HLADR, CD80, CD23, CD206, and CD163 
(BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on 
a BD LSRFortessa instrument using FACSDiva software (BD 
Biosciences), with 10,000 events acquired for each sample. 
Integrated median fluorescence intensity (iMFI) was computed 
by multiplying the relative frequency (percentage of positive) of 
cells expressing each marker by the median fluorescence intensity 
(MFI) of the cell population.

algorithm Development for the 
classification of Polarized Macrophages 
on the Basis of Their Phenotypic 
responses to iFn/lPs, il4, or il10
For each donor d (d = 1:26), we defined a vector that included the 
iMFI measurements of the five surface markers under a certain 
stimulus st (st = IFN/LPS, IL4, or IL10)

 iMFId,st = ( )iMFI iMFI iMFI iMFI iMFIHLADR CD80 CD23 CD206 CD163, , , , dd ,st 
(1)

The mean response of all the samples to a specific stimulus 
was then calculated and written in the corresponding vector. 
Therefore, for each stimulus we obtained one mean vector, 

containing the five mean values of iMFI measurements, one for 
each surface marker.

Given that (i) the presence of surface markers on the mem-
brane and the resulting fluorescence intensity scale may differ 
between markers and that (ii) we sought to simply determine 
the tendency of the surface marker to increase or decrease under 
a certain stimulus, we defined a normalized scale of iMFI for 
each of the markers, thus obtaining the normalized iMFI, iMFI.  
To carry out this normalization, we took as maximum refer-
ence values for each surface marker those arising from the five 
mean vectors, iMFImean, st . The normalization was then applied 
to all individual measured values (i.e., for each donor, stimulus, 
and surface marker) as follows, fixing at 1 those values that 
exceeded it:

This normalization algorithm was also applied to the mean

used as response patterns to the stimuli, iMFI pattern,st , which are 
shown in Figure 1B.

The response pattern was used to classify sample response to 
a given stimulus. It is hypothesized that a sample stimulated with 
IFN/LPS will show the lowest distance to the IFN/LPS pattern 
( )iMFI pattern,IFN / LPS  when its response is also compared with the 
IL4 pattern ( )iMFI pattern,IL4  and IL10 pattern ( )iMFI pattern,IL10 .

Let us assume that we have a sample of a certain donor, d, 
that has been treated with the stimulus st (st  =  IFN/LPS, IL4, 
or IL10). This sample is then experimentally analyzed and its 
surface markers are determined. The normalized concentra-
tion of each surface marker is evaluated through the vector

This magnitude set will be compared with the three patterns 
by using three geometrical distances between vectors, namely

The same procedure was applied to assess the distances 
between the response of cells to CD5L and the three patterns 
(distCD5L–IFN/LPS, d, distCD5L–IL4, d, and distCD5L–IL10, d), once the normal-
ized iMFICD5L,d  had been obtained by means of Eq. 3 (d = 1:12). 
The values of all distances are shown in Figure 1C.

The complete algorithm for classifying the stimulated samples 
is summarized in Table 1.

rna extraction and Quantitative rT-Pcr
PB monocytes or THP1 macrophages (1 × 106 cells/well) were 
incubated for 24  h in RPMI medium containing 5% FCS and 
the polarizing stimuli. Cells were then washed with PBS and 
disrupted with QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen), and RNA was 
extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA 
(1 µg) was reverse transcribed using the RNA to cDNA EcoDry™ 
Premix (Clontech). Each RT reaction was then amplified in a 
LightCycler® 480 PCR system (Roche) using the KAPA SYBR Fast 
Master Mix (KAPA Biosystems). Samples were incubated for an 
initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, then 40 PCR cycles were 
performed using the following conditions: 95°C for 10  s, 60°C 
for 20 s, and 72°C for 10 s. The primer pairs used in the study 
are listed in Table  2. Gene expression values were normalized 
to the expression levels of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase). Fold induction levels were calculated by using 
the expression level of each gene in untreated conditions (−) as 
a reference.

Measurement of cytokine secretion
PB monocytes (105 cells/well) were incubated for 72  h with 
polarizing stimuli diluted in culture medium containing 5% 
FCS and subsequently stimulated with LPS (from E. coli 0111: 
B4, Sigma-Aldrich). After 4 h (for TNF) or 24 h for (IL1β and 
IL6), culture supernatant fractions were collected and assayed 
for cytokine production with OptEIA ELISA, following the 
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). In experiments 
using THP1 macrophages treated with siRNA targeting ID3 
expression, cells were siRNA-transfected and allowed to dif-
ferentiate (see below). They were then stimulated with LPS 
(5 × 104 cells/well) and assayed for cytokine production as above. 
Color was developed by adding 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine 
liquid substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Optical density was read at 
450 nm on a Varioskan Flash microplate reader (ThermoFisher 
Scientific Inc.).

rOs Measurement
PB monocytes (105 cells/well) were polarized with the indicated 
stimuli for 72 h and then loaded with 10 µM dichloro-dihydro-
fluorescein diacetate (H2-DCF-DA) (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 
30 min at 37°C in the dark. They were then washed twice and 
resuspended in 100 µL of PBS. Absorbance at 485 nm was meas-
ured using a Varioskan Flash microplate reader (ThermoFisher 
Scientific Inc.). Intracellular ROS levels were calculated by using 
the levels of control cells (−) as a reference.

at the indicated ratios (macrophage: microsphere/bacteria) for 
1 h at 37 or 4°C. Incubation at 4°C was performed to measure 
extracellular attachment rather than internalization, since no 
uptake occurs at this temperature. Cells were then harvested by 
a 20-min incubation with accutase (Sigma-Aldrich). They were 
then extensively washed with cold PBS and fixed with PBS con-

induction of apoptosis and efferocytosis 
assay
1 × 106 HepG2 cells were plated in six-well plates and labeled with 
5 µM CellTrace CFSE (Invitrogen) in PBS for 20 min at 37°C in 
5% CO2. They were then washed and medium was replaced by 
EMEM 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours later, apoptosis was induced 
by 45 min UV irradiation followed by 1 h resting at 37°C. Then 
3,3’-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DIOC, Sigma-Aldrich) and 
propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) were used to measure 
apoptosis by flow cytometry, obtaining 16.2% ± 8.1% live cells 
(DIOC+, PI−), 9.4% ± 5.0% early apoptotic cells (DIOC−, PI−), 
and 68.3% ± 5.2% late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells (PI+). 
An efferocytosis assay was performed by co-culturing THP1 cells 
pre-labeled, as above with 0.5 µM CellTracker™ Deep Red Dye 
(Thermo Fisher), with CFSE-labeled apoptotic HepG2 cells for 
1 h at the indicated ratios (macrophage: apoptotic cell) and at 37 
or 4°C. Cells were then harvested by a 20-min incubation with 
accutase (Sigma-Aldrich), extensively washed with cold PBS, and 
fixed. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCantoII instru-
ment. FACSDiva software was used to quantify percentages of 
Deep Red-labeled macrophages that phagocytosed CFSE-labeled 
apoptotic cells. In addition, efferocytosis was observed by fluo-
rescent microscopy using an Axio Observer Z1 DUO LSM 710 
confocal system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH).

Western Blot analysis of cell lysates
For STAT3 phosphorylation, LC3 conversion and ID3 detection 
analysis, PB monocytes or THP1 macrophages (1 × 106 cells/well) 
were plated in six-well plates and polarized by incubation with 
the indicated stimuli at 37°C for the indicated periods. They were 
then washed in cold TBS and lysed in TBS lysis buffer [20 mM Tris, 
pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% 
Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, and complete protease 
inhibitor cocktail (all from Sigma-Aldrich)] for 30 min at 4°C. 
For STAT3 and LC3, nuclei and cell debris were removed by cen-
trifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min, while for ID3, total cell lysates 
were resolved. Protein concentration was measured with the BCA 
protein assay reagent kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following 
the manufacturer’s instructions. To this end, 40–50 µg of protein 
from cell lysates were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels 
(12% for LC3) under reducing conditions and electrophoretically 
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 
These were then blocked with Starting Block TBS buffer (Thermo 
Fisher) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 

4°C with mAb anti-phosphorylated STAT3 Tyr705 (Clone 9E12, 
05-485, Millipore), poAb anti-STAT3 (06-596, Millipore), poAb 
anti-LC3 (NB100–2220, Novus Biologicals), and mAb anti-ID3 
(9837, Cell Signaling Technology) diluted in blocking buffer. 
Blots were also probed against beta-tubulin (mAb anti-TUBB2A, 
T9026, Sigma-Aldrich) or Histone H3 (poAb anti-HIST3H3, 
9715, Cell Signaling Technology) to determine equal loading. 
The membranes were subsequently incubated for 60  min at 
room temperature with the appropriate fluorescently coupled 
secondary antibodies (IRDye680Cw-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit IgG or IRDye 800Cw-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 
LI-COR Biosciences, 926–32,221 and 926–32,210, respectively) 
diluted in blocking buffer. Three 15-min washes between steps 
were performed with TBS-0.01% Tween 20 (Merck Millipore). 
Bound antibody was detected with an Odyssey Infrared Imager 
(LI-COR), and densitometric analysis was performed using the 
Odyssey V.3 software (LI-COR).

Fluorescence Microscopy studies
PB monocytes (105 cells/well) were plated and incubated with 
the indicated stimuli for 72  h on Millicell EZ slides (Merck 
Millipore). Cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% paraform-
aldehyde (Panreac) and incubated for 24  h at 4°C with moAb 
anti-CD5L (Abnova) or poAb anti-LC3 (Novus Biologicals) in 
PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% human AB serum 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were subsequently incubated for 1  h at 
room temperature with Alexa Fluor® 488 F(ab’)2 fragment of goat 
anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor® 647 F(ab’)2 fragment of goat anti-
rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton 
X-100. Between steps, unbound antibodies were removed with 
three washes with PBS. Finally, nuclei were stained for 10 min 
at room temperature with PBS containing 800  nM Hoechst 
33,258 solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then washed three 
times with PBS, and coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount 
media (Sigma-Aldrich) and left at 4°C overnight. To determine 
autophagic flux, culture medium was replaced by prewarmed 
RPMI containing 100 nM LysoTracker Red (Molecular Probes), 
and cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h before fixation. The slides 
were examined under an Axio Observer Z1 DUO LSM 710 con-
focal system and analyzed with ZEN Black software (Carl Zeiss 
Microscopy GmbH). LC3 and LC3-LysoTracker Red colocalized 
puncta per cell were determined using a green and red puncta 
colocalization macro and ImageJ software in threshold images 
with sizes from 3 to 30 pixel2 and puncta circularity 0.8–1, as 
described previously (23).

silencing of CD5L, ATG7, and ID3 
expression
Undifferentiated THP1 cells were transfected with 10 nM of a set 
of four siRNAs targeting CD5L, ATG7, ID3 or an equal concentra-
tion of a non-targeting negative control pool (ON-TARGET plus 
siRNA, Dharmacon) using INTERFERin (Polyplus-transfection 
SA), as previously described (23), following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. After 24  h, medium was replaced, and cells were 
differentiated for 24 h with culture medium supplemented with 
10  ng/mL PMA. Next, this medium was replaced by culture

medium for a further 24 h before being tested for CD5L, ATG7, or 
ID3 expression by PCR or western blot and used in the functional 
assays described above. When indicated, cells were treated with 
40 ng/mL DXM for an additional 24 h prior to analysis.

gene expression Profiling analysis
Total RNA was isolated and purified from 106 THP1-vector or 
THP1-CD5L macrophages by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) 
and RNeasy columns (Qiagen). cRNA was generated from 10 µg of 
total RNA by using superscript (Invitrogen) and the MessageAmp 
II-Biotin (Ambion, USA) RNA transcription-labeling kit (Enzo 
Biochem) cRNA was hybridized to the CodeLink™ Human Whole 
Genome Bioarray (Applied microarrays) at 37°C for 16 h by using 
the TrayMix hybridizer (BioTray, France). Samples were labeled 
with Cy5 (Bionova), and arrays were scanned with an InnoScan 
700 scanner (Innopsys). Data normalization and analysis were 
performed with Bioconductor R, LIMMA package by the bio-
informatics platform of CIBERehd, Spain. The microarray data 
have been deposited in the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus 
database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession 
number GSE111315. Lists of genes obtained from microarray 
analysis were associated with biological process annotations, as 
defined by the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium (18). DAVID 
bioinformatics resources (19, 20) were used to search for statisti-
cally significant enrichment of functional categories.

statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM of at least three experiments. 
Student’s t-test was performed with Graphpad Prism V.5 software. 
Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.

Polarization with cD5l Promotes an M2 
Phenotypic Profile like That induced by 
il10
To gain a thorough understanding of the role of CD5L in human 
macrophage polarization, we examined the phenotypic and also 
functional changes induced by this protein, when compared with 
the response to culture medium (−) or the standard polarization 
stimuli IFN/LPS, IL4, or IL10. Neither human PB monocytes nor 
THP1 macrophages express detectable levels of CD5L protein. 
Therefore, we supplemented PB monocyte cultures with human 
rCD5L or human Alb as control. Although the latter is not an inert 
protein, we have previously used it as negative control, observing 
no significant effects on PB monocytes in our assays. On the other 
hand, we generated a macrophage cell line that stably expresses 
human CD5L, referred to as THP1-CD5L (21, 24).

The initial analysis included combined flow cytometry stud-
ies of HLADR, CD80, CD206, CD23, and CD163 polarization 
markers on PB monocytes from healthy blood donors after treat-
ment with medium alone, the standard polarization stimuli, or 
rCD5L (Figure 1A). In these experiments, INF/LPS selectively 
increased HLADR and CD80 and diminished CD206 and CD163 
when compared with medium alone; IL4 increased HLADR, 
CD80, CD23, and CD206 and inhibited CD163; and IL10, as well 

as rCD5L, increased CD163, and reduced CD23. Collectively, 
these flow cytometry data were used to build an algorithm for 
macrophage polarization classification, thus facilitating the study 
of response patterns in an unbiased manner (Table 1). To this 
end, flow cytometry data on marker expression were normalized 
(Figure 1B). For each donor, the response was then compared 
with the normalized profiles of IFN/LPS, IL4, and IL10 by cal-
culating the distance of each response to each of the standard 
stimuli. The shortest distance was considered optimal. By using 
this “minimum distance criterion,” 92% of the samples treated 
with IFN/LPS, IL4, or IL10 were correctly classified according 
to the applied stimuli (IFN/LPS, IL4, or IL10) (Figure 1C). The 
classification algorithm was then used to compare the distances 
between rCD5L-induced surface marker levels ( )iMFICD5L,d  to 
the three patterns of the standard stimuli (IFN/LPS, IL4, and 
IL10). The criterion of the minimum distance classified 10 of the 
12 rCD5L-treated samples (83%) as an IL10-like response and 2 
(17%) as an IFN/LPS-like response (Figure 1C, right). Therefore, 
according to the algorithm, rCD5L promoted a phenotype that 
resembled that of IL10 in 10 out of 12 donors.

RT-qPCR reinforced these findings, showing that treatment of 
PB monocytes with rCD5L did not modify CD80, TNF, CD206, 
or TGM2 expression but did induce a predominant increase 
in CD163, Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK), CD36, and vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression, in a very 
similar way to IL10 (Figure 1D). We next analyzed the expression 
of a selected set of these genes in THP1 macrophages and found 
that IL10 did not modify any of them in a significant manner. 
Therefore, we assayed the corticosteroid DXM as an additional 
M2-polarizing stimulus in these cells. THP1 macrophages 
responded to IFN/LPS, IL4, and DXM by modulating CD80, 
TGM2, CD163, and MERTK gene expression in a similar way 
as PB monocytes (Figure 1E). Interestingly, THP1-CD5L mac-
rophages showed a profile that resembled that of THP1-vector 
macrophages treated with IL10 or DXM.

Given that STAT3 is the key transcription regulator of IL10 
(33), we assessed its activation. Western blot experiments revealed 
increased STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) in PB monocytes 
polarized with IL10 and rCD5L when compared with those incu-
bated with control human Alb (Figure 1F, left). Similar results 
were observed for STAT3 phosphorylation in unstimulated 
THP1-CD5L vs. control THP1-vector macrophages (Figure 1F, 
right). Taken together, our data reinforce the notion that CD5L 
is a molecular driver of M2 macrophage polarization. The data 
further suggested that THP1 macrophages were suitable for the 
purposes of the present study.

cD5l Drives Macrophages to an M2 
Functional Phenotype similar to That 
induced by il10
Next, we performed a series of functional experiments to 
determine whether rCD5L-polarized PB monocytes (M-CD5L) 
share M-IL10 or M-DXM effector mechanisms. In this regard, 
like M-IL10, M-CD5L secreted lower levels of inflammatory 
mediators TNF, IL1β, and IL6 in response to LPS, thereby sug-
gesting a decrease in their inflammatory response to this molecule

(Figure 2A). In addition, IL10 treatment reduced inflammatory 
ROS production. Interestingly, treatment with rCD5L had the 
opposite effect, slightly increasing ROS levels in macrophages 
(Figure  2B). We studied three additional functional features 
of macrophages, namely the phagocytosis of latex beads and 
bacteria, as well as apoptotic cell clearance. In these assays, the 
percentage of FITC-positive cells increased in a dose-dependent 
manner when the experiments were performed at 37°C but not 
at 4°C (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). These observations 

indicate that increases in fluorescence were due to uptake rather 
than to adherence to the cell surface. Interestingly, unlike the 
inhibitory effect of IFN/LPS, treatment with IL4, IL10, or rCD5L 
did not alter the phagocytosis of latex beads, Gram-negative  
E. coli or gram-positive S. aureus (Figure 2C). On the contrary, 
when we analyzed the efferocytic ability of rCD5L-polarized 
macrophages we observed that they responded with increased 
phagocytosis of apoptotic HepG2 cells. In this regard, rCD5L and 
IL10 treatments increased the population of FITC-positive cells

by 46 and 25%, respectively, when compared with macrophages 
treated with the control protein Alb (P = 0.008 and P = 0.0011 
Student’s t-test, respectively) (Figure  2D). Similar results were 
obtained when we compared THP1-CD5L and THP1-vector 
macrophages (Figure 2E; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). 
Altogether, the data suggest that CD5L drives macrophages to 
an anti-inflammatory and high-efferocytic functional phenotype, 
like that shown by M2, M-IL10.

cD5l expression is Promoted by  
M2-Polarizing stimuli
To determine the expression of CD5L in polarized macrophages, 
we analyzed CD5L mRNA and protein in PB monocytes polarized 
with INF/LPS, IL4, IL10, or DXM. LXR/RXR synthetic ligands 
(T13+9CR) were used as a positive control of CD5L upregula-
tion, because these nuclear receptors induce CD5L expression 
(19, 34). RT-qPCR data showed that CD5L mRNA levels were 
upregulated 9.31- and 5.54-fold by IL10 and DXM polarization, 
respectively, when compared with medium alone (Figure 3A, left). 
Accordingly, DXM-treated THP1-vector macrophages showed a 
5.53-fold upregulation of CD5L mRNA (Figure 3A, right). The 
upregulation of CD5L gene expression was also associated with 
an increase in protein expression, as observed by immunofluo-
rescence staining and confocal microscopy using an anti-CD5L 

moAb (Figure  3B). To study the participation of CD5L in the 
acquisition of the M2 phenotype, we silenced its expression in 
DXM-treated THP1-vector macrophages. CD5L mRNA induc-
tion by DXM in these cells was abolished by siRNA transfection 
when compared with THP1-vector macrophages transfected 
with control siRNA (Figure 3C). Interestingly, this abolition was 
concomitant with a diminished expression of M2 markers CD163 
(by 56.8%) and MERTK (by 100%) (Figure 3D). In contrast, the 
expression of M1 marker CD80 remained unaltered, thereby sug-
gesting that these changes were specific. Altogether, these data 
indicate that CD5L is expressed in M2 macrophages, and they 
reinforce the notion that CD5L contributes to the acquisition of 
an M2 phenotype.

autophagy Protein aTg7 is involved in 
M-cD5l Polarization
Both autophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis may be 
involved in macrophage polarization (35–39). As CD5L 
induces autophagy (23), we next examined whether autophagic 
machinery is involved in CD5L-driven macrophage polarization. 
Autophagy vesicle formation and fusion with lysosomes were 
examined in M-IFN/LPS, M-IL4, M-IL10, M-DXM and M-CD5L 
(Figures 4A,B). To this end, we measured LC3 puncta per cell 
and the colocalization of LC3 puncta with acidic organelles, the

puncta per cell (2.40 ± 0.24, 2.87 ± 0.29, 2.21 ± 0.47, respectively, 
vs. 0.66  ±  0.19) and promoted Lysotracker Red colocalization 
(0.57 ± 0.17, 0.41 ± 0.16, 0.36 ± 0.12 double positive puncta per

ment with the control protein Alb. In addition, cells were exam-
ined for the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3A/B 
(LC3)-II status by western blot of total cell lysates (Figure 4B). 
These assays revealed that, like IL10 and DXM, rCD5L-induced 
high LC3-II levels, thereby further supporting the notion of 
increased autophagy-dependent mechanisms.

We next silenced the expression of ATG7, an integral com-
ponent of the cellular autophagic machinery, in THP1-CD5L 
macrophages and observed phenotypic and functional conse-
quences. In these experiments, siRNA treatment led to ~60% 
silencing of ATG7, as previously reported (23) (Figure  4C). 
Silencing ATG7 inhibited CD163 and MERTK mRNAs by 55 and 
100%, respectively, when compared with their expression levels 
in THP1-vector macrophages, but did not affect the expression 
of M1 marker CD80 or TGM2 (Figure  4D). Moreover, ATG7 
silencing reduced the efferocytic capacity of THP1-CD5L mac-
rophages by 68% when compared with cells treated with control 
non-targeting siRNA and using THP1-vector macrophage activ-
ity as a reference (Figure 4E). These data suggest that autophagic 
mechanisms participate in the CD5L-induced M2 macrophage 
phenotype and function.

gene expression Profile analysis of cD5l-
expressing Macrophages reveals iD3 as 
a Molecular Target
Array-based expression profile experiments were performed 
to compare THP1-vector and THP1-CD5L macrophages. The 
expression of 16 and 9 genes was upregulated and downregulated, 
respectively, by CD5L expression (>2-fold induction, P < 0.01) 
(Figure  5A). The list of genes modified by CD5L (>2-fold, 
P < 0.05) was subjected to GO analysis. The use of DAVID bio-
informatics resources showed statistically significant enrichment 
of several functional categories, including leukocyte migration, 
metabolic processes, signal transduction, and apoptosis, among 
the list of genes modulated by CD5L (Figure  5B). We further 
analyzed the expression profiling data to identify an intracellular 
player for CD5L-mediated macrophage polarization and selected 
DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID3 (ID3) and the transcription 
factor brain expressed X-linked 1 (BEX1), which were the most 
up- and downregulated genes, respectively (fold change vs. 
THP1-vector: ID3 7.2 and BEX1 −9.59, P < 0.0001). Accordingly, 
RT-qPCR analysis revealed the upregulation of ID3 and downreg-
ulation of BEX1 in THP1-CD5L vs. THP1-vector macrophages 
(Figure 5C). Interestingly, BEX1 mRNA was also downregulated 
in primary macrophages after all the treatments (i.e., IFN/LPS, 
IL4, IL10, and rCD5L) when compared with those incubated 
with medium alone (Figure 5D, left). Therefore, the data indi-
cated no specific involvement of BEX1 in IL10- or CD5L-driven 
polarization. In contrast, ID3 expression was downregulated in 
macrophages treated with IFN/LPS, while it was upregulated in 

those treated with IL10 and rCD5L (Figure 5D, right). We further 
confirmed CD5L-dependent ID3 upregulation at the protein level 
by western blot of THP1 macrophage lysates (Figure 5E, left), and 
in M-IL10 and M-CD5L (Figure 5E, right) when compared with 
other stimuli or medium alone. Altogether, our data suggest that 
CD5L and IL10 induce ID3 expression in macrophages.

We then studied whether modulation of ID3 expression 
by CD5L was mediated through the induction of autophagy 
(Figure  5F). Blockade of ATG7 expression in THP1-CD5L 
macrophages partially reversed ID3 mRNA induction (56% 
inhibition). Taken together, these results indicate that ID3 
mRNA is upregulated in IL10- and CD5L-polarized mac-
rophages and that its expression is regulated, at least in part, 
by autophagy.

iD3 is involved in M-cD5l Polarization
ID3 is a transcriptional regulator that negatively controls basic 
helix−loop-helix transcription factors by forming heterodimers 
and inhibiting their DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. To 
determine the contribution of ID3 to CD5L-mediated polariza-
tion, we silenced its expression in THP1-CD5L macrophages by 
siRNA treatment. We observed a ~91% inhibition of ID3 mRNA 
(Figure 6A, left) and a reduction of ID3 protein levels in these 
cells, which leveled out those observed in control cells (THP1-
vector) (Figure 6A, right). A decrease in ID3 expression did not 
modify CD80 or CD163 expression, but led to a 100% decrease 
in MERTK mRNA levels, thus completely reversing the effect of 
CD5L overexpression on THP1 macrophages (Figure  6B). In 
accordance with a decrease in MERTK expression, ID3 silencing 
abolished the effects of CD5L on the efferocytic activity of these 
cells by 99% (Figure 6C). Moreover, ID3 silencing in THP1-CD5L 
macrophages enhanced TNF and IL1β secretion in response to 
TLR induction, thereby reversing the modulatory effect of CD5L 
on cytokine secretion in response to LPS (Figure 6D). These data 
strongly support the notion that the ID3 transcription factor 
is involved in the induction of the phenotypic and functional 
characteristics of M-CD5L.

DiscUssiOn

Although macrophage polarization has been characterized in 
mice through the definition of gene/protein signature markers, 
secretory profiles, and activation of pathways, the definition 
of macrophage polarization states in the human is still poorly 
characterized. Here, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic 
and functional profiling of human PB monocytes and THP1 
cells treated with standard polarizing stimuli that may be of 
use for further studies related to macrophage polarization. 
In this regard, here we prove the utility of our approach to 
characterize macrophage responses to CD5L. Specifically, we 
demonstrate that CD5L drives M2 macrophage polarization in a 
similar manner as IL10. This finding is of relevance because M2 
macrophages are key regulators of inflammatory and healing 
responses, as well as of tumor progression. Identifying novel 
molecules and mechanisms involved in human macrophage 
polarization may facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and 
therapeutic tools.

Our polarization studies, which included expression data 
and mathematical analysis of 5 surface markers in PB mono-
cytes from 26 healthy donors, agree with those of the literature. 

In addition, they provide with a global picture of phenotypic 
changes during polarization. Accordingly, we observed that the 
M1 M-INF/LPS showed upregulation of HLADR in conjunction

with the co-stimulatory molecule CD80, which may be indica-
tive of increased antigen presentation (8), and downregulation 
of CD206, a molecule related to the resolution of inflammation 
(40). Regarding M2 macrophages, M-IL4 enhanced HLADR 
and CD80 expression, but also CD206 and CD23, the latter 
being involved in allergic reactions (41). Surprisingly, IL4, 
like IFN/LPS, induced the downregulation of CD163, a widely 
accepted marker of the M2 phenotype (40). In contrast, IL10, 
which is another M2 stimulus, is upregulated CD163 while it 
inhibited CD23.

To obtain a global and objective value of these phenotypic 
changes through which to classify macrophage polarization on 
the basis of a specific treatment, we developed a mathematical 
algorithm. For each marker, we defined a unique quantitative 
descriptor, the normalized iMFI magnitude, iMFI . This magni-
tude is independent of the particular fluorescence scale of the dif-
ferent markers assessed. Therefore, the iMFI allows comparison 
of the effects (up- or downregulation) of the different stimuli on 
all the markers regardless of their relative amount or fluorescence 
signal used. We then quantified the distance between the iMFI 
of the five markers in each donor and each stimuli and com-
pared them with the mean of the profiles by using vectors. This 
approach, validated by 92% agreement, proved useful to classify 

the polarized macrophages on the basis of their global phenotype. 
We believe that this qualifies the method as an excellent tool for 
classification purposes and that the 8% misclassification detected 
is probably related to the inherent heterogeneity in humans. The 
present algorithm allowed us to quantitatively determine that the 
CD5L-induced macrophage surface marker expression profile 
is similar to that of the M-IL10 profile. However, the distance 
values given by CD5L were slightly greater than those produced 
by IL10, which suggests that the two stimuli led to globally similar 
but not identical phenotypic responses. In summary, the newly 
developed algorithm proves useful for determining the effect of 
different stimuli on macrophage polarization.

Phenotypic changes observed by flow cytometry were com-
plemented by RT-qPCR data. Initial assays confirmed that the 
changes in CD80, CD206, and CD163 mRNA correlated with 
those provided by flow cytometry. Therefore, RT-qPCR was used 
for the analysis of the following additional subset-specific genes: 
TNF, as one of the main inflammatory cytokines; the multifunc-
tional enzyme transglutaminase 2, MERTK, and the scavenger 
receptor CD36, all related to phagocytosis and apoptotic cell 
clearance (40); and VEGF, which is involved in angiogenesis (42). 
In agreement with previous findings, CD5L modulated these 
genes in similar way as IL10.

Sanjurjo et al. CD5L Drives M2 Macrophage Polarization

Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 480

For a better understanding of the effect of polarization treat-
ments on the biological functions of macrophages, we next exam-
ined the functional behavior of these cells. In accordance with the 
literature (7), we observed distinct secretory profiles after LPS 
stimulation. M-INF/LPS responded to LPS with increased TNF, 
IL1β, and IL6 expression. In contrast, M-IL10 and also M-CD5L 
blocked inflammation, producing minimal, or basal levels of 
these three cytokines in response to LPS. Although CD5L- and 
IL10-induced macrophage polarization seem to inhibit inflam-
matory responses to LPS in a similar manner, our data suggest 
that the effects of CD5L are not caused by the direct induction 
of IL10 secretion, since rCD5L has no effect on IL10 mRNA or 
protein levels in macrophages in the absence of TLR stimulation 
(23). Furthermore, the anti-microbial response involving ROS 
production was increased in M-CD5L, which contrasts with the 
diminished levels of ROS detected in M-IL10 (43). These obser-
vations thus reinforce the idea that CD5L does not act through 
direct IL10 induction.

The phagocytosis of pathogens, apoptotic cells, and cell debris 
is a key feature of macrophage function in host defense and 
tissue homeostasis. In a set of phagocytosis experiments using 
latex beads, bacteria, and apoptotic cells, we observed suppressed 
phagocytic activity by M-INF/LPS. Our findings are in line with 
reports showing that INF-treated macrophages show impaired 
phagocytic activity (44–46). Conversely, M-IL10 and M-CD5L 
showed elevated expression of uptake receptors CD163, CD36, 
and MERTK, as well as increased efferocytosis, an observation 
that is consistent with the findings of other studies (47) and 
that reinforces the role of M2 macrophages in the resolution of 
inflammation.

Altogether, our phenotypic and functional data suggest that 
CD5L drives macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflamma-
tory and pro-resolving phenotype. Interestingly, in vitro, CD5L 
expression was restricted to IL10- or DXM-polarized mac-
rophages, thereby pointing to a positive feedback loop between 
CD5L expression and the maintenance of the M2 phenotype.

An increasing body of evidence shows that the autophagic 
machinery regulates macrophage polarization (35–39). However, 
there is discrepancy regarding the contribution of autophagy to 
M1 and M2 polarization (36, 48, 49). Such discrepancy may be 
explained by differences in experimental settings and/or in the 
backgrounds of the macrophages studied. Our data showed 
increased LC3 puncta and LC3-LysoTracker Red-positive 
puncta per cell, as well as an increased LC3-II/-I ratio only in 
macrophages treated with IL10, DXM, and rCD5L, thereby sug-
gesting enhanced autophagy by M2 macrophages. Additional 
analyses of other proteins that participate in autophagy signal-
ing (e.g., p62/SQSTM1, mTOR, or AMPK) will be necessary to 
determine the key partners involved. Moreover, regarding the 
role of autophagy in CD5L polarization, our siRNA experiments 
targeting ATG7 support the notion that, besides being involved 
in anti-inflammatory functions (23), autophagy plays a key role 
in M2 marker expression and also in the clearance of apoptotic 
cells in M-CD5L.

To identify an intracellular player involved in CD5L-mediated 
polarization, we performed expression profile experiments 
comparing THP1-vector and THP1-CD5L macrophages. The 

THP1 cell line was used because it showed similar results as 
primary cells regarding marker expression, STAT3 activation, 
phagocytosis, and efferocytosis. The list of genes modulated 
by CD5L showed statistically significant enrichment of several 
functional categories, some previously related to CD5L func-
tions, including leukocyte migration, metabolic processes, 
signal transduction, and apoptosis (14), thereby validating our 
data.

Regarding the contribution of ID3 to macrophage polariza-
tion, positive feedback between ID3 and M2 polarization has 
been proposed, because ID3 is upregulated by M2-polarizing 
stimuli, namely TGFβ (50), lung cancer-conditioned medium, or 
galectin-1 (51). Our data are in line with these results, because 
CD5L and IL10, which are also M2 drivers, enhanced ID3 expres-
sion. Accordingly, blockade experiments support the notion that 
ID3 is involved in the anti-inflammatory functions and clearance 
of apoptotic cells by M-CD5L macrophages. Interestingly, when 
autophagic flux was blocked by ATG7 silencing in THP1-CD5L 
cells, ID3 upregulation was partially reversed, thus suggesting 
that the upregulation of ID3 is autophagy-dependent. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a link between 
ID3 transcription factor and autophagy.

In summary, here we report on a comprehensive method for 
analyzing human macrophage polarization. This approach has 
revealed a novel role of CD5L as a driver of M2 macrophage 
polarization through the upregulation of ID3 and autophagic 
mechanisms. Our results point to CD5L as a potential target for 
future therapies seeking to alter the macrophage polarization 
state. This could be applied in settings such as cancer, where 
reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages is a promising 
mode of treatment.
