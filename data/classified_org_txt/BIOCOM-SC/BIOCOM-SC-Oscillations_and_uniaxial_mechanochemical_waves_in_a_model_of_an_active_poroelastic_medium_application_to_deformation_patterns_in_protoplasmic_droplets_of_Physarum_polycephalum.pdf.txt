Abstract

Self-organization in cells often manifests itself in oscillations and waves. Here, we

address deformation waves in protoplasmic droplets of the plasmodial slime mold

Physarum polycephalum by modelling and experiments. In particular, we ex-

tend a one-dimensional model that considered the cell as an poroelastic medium,

where active tension caused mechanochemical waves that were regulated by an

inhibitor (M. Radszuweit et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 (2013), 138102). Our ex-

tension consists of a simple, qualitative chemical reaction-diffusion model (Brus-

selator) that describes the regulation of the inhibitor by another biochemical

species. The biochemical reaction enhances the formation of mechanochemi-

cal waves if the reaction rates and input concentrations are near or inside an

oscillatory regime. The period of the waves is found to be controlled by the

characteristic oscillation period, whereas their wavelength is set by mechani-

cal parameters. The model also allows for a systematic study of the chemical

activity at the onset of mechanochemical waves. We also present examples for

pattern formation in protoplasmic droplets of Physarum polycephalum including

global oscillations where the central region of the droplets is in antiphase to the

boundary zone, as well as travelling and standing wave like uniaxial patterns.

Finally, we apply our model to reproduce these experimental results by iden-

tifying the active tension inhibitor with the intracellular calcium concentration

in the Physarum droplets and by using parameter values from mechanical ex-

periments, respectively knowledge about the properties of calcium oscillations

in Physarum. The simulation results are then found to be in good agreement

with the experimental observations.

1. Introduction

Biological cells are dynamic objects, the internal organization of which is

highly structured. The intracellular environment is compartmented, and a very

large number of biochemical substances react in the various compartments, dif-

fuse through a crowded environment, and move following gradients in chemical

potentials or due to mechanical and hydrodynamic forces. In such a complex

system, the spatial distribution of the biochemical substances becomes a key

factor for the correct performance of the cellular activities.

Biochemical self-organization manifests itself in the formation of static and

dynamic structures. Pattern-forming processes are typically associated with the

interplay between biochemical reactions and the transport of molecules, which

may be either passive or active. When a molecule (or particle) is transported

due to intracellular concentration gradients, the transport is passive, e.g., dur-

ing thermal diffusion of molecules. On the other hand, particles can also be

transported actively, i.e., when the cell consumes energy to transport the par-

ticle. This is the case when molecules (or vesicles, etc.) are transported as a

result of the action of active mechanical forces produced by molecular motors

2



[1]. These molecular machines pull at the filaments which form the cytoskeleton

of the cell. A combination of such forces and diffusion of biochemical regulators

may induce the formation of static and dynamic patterns in active fluid [2] and

poroelastic cellular media [3]. Similarly, oscillatory instabilities were found for

models of active gels [4] as well as for models of mechanical deformations in

epithelial tissues [5, 6, 7].

The filaments of the cytoskeleton consist of chains of proteins like actin and

are kept together in bundles by cross-linking proteins [8]. At large time scales,

the cytoskeleton is dynamic and fluidized. There is a continuous polymerization

and depolymerization of filaments and the unbinding of cross-linkers may pro-

duce cytoplasmic flows. Models based on active gel theory successfully describe

such flows [9, 10].

At smaller time scales, however, the cytoskeleton is more rigid and behaves as

an elastic solid. Together, the cytoskeleton and the cytosol, i.e., the fluid part of

the cytoplasm, form a poroelastic material. The dominance of the poroelasticity

at small time scales has been shown in experiments on partial dehydration of

living cells [11] and by the study of the cell response to small perturbations

measured by atomic force microscopy [12].

Physarum polycephalum has been used as a model organism to analyze the

filament structure of the cytoskeleton [13, 14, 15]. Physarum is a slime mold

(myxomycetes) that forms giant multinucleate amoeboid cells that may reach

vastly differing sizes (from a few µm2 to a m2). Different aspects of the self-

organization of this organism may be investigated by varying the cell size. For

instance, extended plasmodia form complex tubular transportation networks to

feed protoplasm to and from remote parts of the organism. The morphology

of such networks is analyzed from the point of view of the physiology [14, 16,

17, 18] as well as in the frame of graph theory [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. On the

other hand, the scientific focus also lies on small cellular structures of about

50 - 800 µm length, where the amoeboid motility of migrating microplasmodia

[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] is currently intensively investigated.

In addition to extended networks and the motility of migrating microplas-

3



modia, small protoplasmic droplets of Physarum have been studied in a third

line of research. Generally, aliquots of 0.5−25 µl protoplasm are extracted either

from a strand (vein) of an extended network [31] or from its apical zone [32] and

transferred into a Petri dish, where they expand into a roughly circular area to

generate a protoplasmic droplet of 400 µm – 1 mm diameter. Such droplets are

subjected to reorganization and intracellular differentiation and will eventually

form a new, viable cell. Immediately after deposition of the cell material on

the Petri dish, it forms a plasma membrane and then begins to self-organize.

During this process, mechanical deformation waves travel through the droplet

[31, 32, 33] and actively take part in the cellular reorganization. The loci and

instants of the onset of cell dilation (i.e., of the increase in cell thickness) are

tightly correlated to peaks of intracellular calcium concentration [32].

In Physarum, the driving force for pumping protoplasm through the cell is

provided by coherent contractions of the cytoskelton. The dynamics of these

motor proteins is regulated by the intracellular concentration of calcium [32, 34,

35], because an elevation in the calcium concentration leads to a delation of the

cell due to the relaxation of the actin fibers [35, 36]. Whereas the regulation

exerted by calcium on the cytoskeleton dynamics is well established [35, 36,

37, 38], less is known about the mechanistic details connecting the calcium

oscillations with the cytoskeletal dynamics. This is reflected by the current

discussion if the cytoskeleton dynamics is ”merely” coupled to an autonomous,

primary calcium oscillator [39, 40, 41] (for instance, oscillations of mitochondrial

activity [40, 41], which also cause the concentration of cytosolic calcium to

oscillate) or if the contractility and the resulting protoplasmic flows need to

be considered as a part of the feedback loop leading to calcium oscillations

[35, 42, 43].

Very recently, models based on the poroelastic nature of Physarum cell have

been proposed to rationalize the mechanism of locomotion of migrating mi-

croplasmodia [27, 28]. The concept of Physarum cells as being poroelastic media

was used previously in a series of studies aiming at understanding the dynam-

ics of the reorganization of protoplasmic droplets and the related deformation

4



patterns [3, 44, 45].

The combination of the poroelastic properties [12] with the concept of ac-

tive matter has recently been applied for eukaryotic cells predicting mechano-

chemical waves [3]. In the present paper the model for intracellular mechano-

chemical waves will be used as a starting point and extended by an oscillatory

chemical reaction to describe deformation patterns in protoplasmic droplets of

Physarum polycephalum. To achieve this, we describe a generic model of an

active poroelastic medium regulated by a diffusive biochemical substance that

inhibits mechanical tension. This regulator represents the intracellular concen-

tration of free calcium ions in Physarum droplets. This model is then extended

by the incorporation of a biochemical oscillator in the dynamics of the regulator

to allow for calcium oscillations that are believed to be essential for deformation

patterns in Physarum (see [45] and references therein).

The present work focuses on uniaxial patterns and is therefore constraint

to a single spatial dimension and is complimentary to an earlier study [45],

that coupled a realistic calcium oscillator to a two-dimensional version of the

active poroelastic model. Since it is controversial if Physarum droplets con-

tain a genuine oscillator, one main aim of our study here is to compare the

behavior of systems with oscillatory and non-oscillatory calcium regulation. In

principle, mechanical waves can appear also for conserved total concentration

of free calcium ions. Such an absence of the local calcium concentration is,

however, unrealistic for living cells. First, we study the resulting model for

typical eukaryotic cell parameters and discuss its general properties. Next, we

show some experimental results on mechano-chemical waves in protoplasmic

droplets of Physarum polycephalum. And finally, we employ the model of the

poroelastic medium coupled to a calcium oscillator to reproduce the particu-

lar experimental patterns observed in protoplasmic droplets of Physarum by

using a parameter set typical for the intracellular dynamics of Physarum. We

find that the typical wavelengths of the mechanochemical deformation waves

are determined by the viscoelastic properties of the model, whereas the period

of the oscillations is controlled by the frequency of the driving calcium oscilla-

5



tor. For large mechanochemical feedback strengths, waves appear already for

non-oscillatory calcium dynamics. Oscillatory conditions, however, lower the

threshold for the occurrence of deformation patterns substantially. Altogether,

the model studied demonstrates that deformation waves are more likely to occur

in a situation where chemical oscillations are present in an active poroelastic

medium.

2. Active poroelastic model with chemical reactions

2.1. Mechanical stresses

Following earlier work [3], we assume that the interior of the cells, i.e.,

the cytoplasm, is mainly formed by two phases, namely the cytoskeleton -

corresponding to the solid or gel phase - and the cytosol representing the fluid or

sol phase. For clarity of terminology, we will use the terms gel for the cytoskele-

ton and fluid for the cytosol and the corresponding labels g and f throughout.

Therefore, the total stress σ inside the cytoplasm is the sum of the stress in the

cytoskeletal phase σg and the stress in the cytosol σf :

σ = ρgσg + ρfσf (1)

where the the respective fractions of cytosol (fluid) and cytoskeleton (gel), ρf

and ρg, are assumed to be constant and shall satisfy ρf + ρg = 1. Both phases

have different structural and mechanical properties:

• The cytoskeleton is a viscoelastic active gel formed by a network of in-

terconnected actin filaments [8]. The filaments are interconnected by

crosslinkers and molecular motors, which produce an active tension (T ) in

the network. To be active, the molecular motors require ATP, which we

consider here to be abundant and to be of constant concentration. The

molecular motors are regulated by several molecules. The location of such

regulators play an important role in the control of the tension in the cy-

toskeleton. The active tension produced by the motors is inhibited by one

6



regulator such that T = T0 − ξf(c), where c corresponds to the concen-

tration of the regulator, T0 is the tension at low c, and ξ is the coupling

strength between the concentration c and the active tension T . In this

paper, we will assume that T depends only on the regulating species; for

a recent model introducing two antagonistic regulators in an active fluid

see [51].

The active gel has viscoelastic properties. We assume that the cytoskele-

ton is a viscoelastic solid gel [46] in contrast to other studies which consider

the cytoskeleton a viscoelastic fluid [47]. Our approach call for the use of

the Kelvin-Voigt model for the description of the viscoelasticity of the ac-

tive gel. The viscoelastic stress of the gel phase together with the active

tension T produced by the myosin motors reads:

σg = Eǫ+ ηg ǫ̇+ T, (2)

where ǫ is the strain, E is the Young modulus, and ηg is the viscous damp-

ening coefficient of the gel. Using linear elasticity theory [48], assuming

that |ǫ| ≪ 1, as is the case for small strains, we relate the strain ǫ = ∂xu

with the local displacement field u. This field indicates the deformation

of the actin network. The stress is rewritten in terms of the displacement

field:

σg = E∂xu+ ηg∂xu̇+ T. (3)

• The cytosol is the viscous fluid part of the cytoplasm. We assume that

the gel is a poroelastic solid material [49], penetrated by the cytosol. The

stress in the fluid phase is just viscous:

σf = ηf∂xv; (4)

where v is the velocity field of the fluid and ηf the viscosity of the fluid

phase. The regulators of the active tension of the cytoskeleton are trans-

ported by both advection and diffusion through the cytosol.

7



2.2. Poroelastic model

The equations of the force balance of both phases are:

ρg∂xσg = fg + ρg∂xp,

ρf∂xσf = ff + ρf∂xp, (5)

where ff and fg are the drag forces of the cytosol and the cytoskeleton, re-

spectively, and p is the pressure that is formally introduced by imposing the

incompressibility condition of the whole poroelastic system [49]. We have as-

sumed Darcy’s law for a porous medium to derive the drag force:

ff = ρfρgβ(v − u̇), (6)

where the parameter β is the ratio between the viscosity of the fluid (ηf ) and

its permeability (κ). The permeability corresponds basically to the square of

the cytoskeleton mesh size ℓm. Due to the symmetry of the multiphase system

we obtain fg = −ff . Inserting Eq. (3) and (4) into Eq. (5), we obtain:

ρg(E∂
2
xu+ ηg∂

2
xu̇+ ∂xT ) = ρfρgβ(u̇− v) + ρg∂xp,

ρfηf∂
2
xv = ρfρgβ(v − u̇) + ρf∂xp; (7)

The pressure in Eqs. (7) can be eliminated by subtracting the first from the

second equation, and finally the balance equation reads:

ηf∂
2
xv − ηg∂

2
xu̇− E∂

2
xu− ∂xT − β(v − u̇) = 0; (8)

This relation couples the dynamics of both phases. To close the system of equa-

tions we employ the incompressibility condition [3, 49] of the fluid-gel system:

∂x (ρfv + ρgu̇) = 0. (9)

Thus, the dynamics of the poroelastic medium can be obtained from the analysis

of Eqs. (8-9).

However, for some boundary conditions the incompressibility condition re-

duces to a simpler form. Assuming zero fluid velocity v = 0 and zero displace-

ment field u = 0 at the boundaries, Eq.(9) yields a relation between the shift

8



field and the fluid velocity:

ρgu̇ = −vρf . (10)

Eq. (10) is the core of the poroelastic approximation: the flux of fluid in one

direction produces a corresponding flux of gel in the opposite direction.

2.3. Body reference system

We define the body reference velocity w = v−u̇. In this new reference frame,

Eq. (8) reads

η∂2xw − E∂
2
xu− ∂xT − βw = 0; (11)

where the viscosity is renormalized according to η = ρfηg + ρgηf . In this

reference frame both velocities can be explicitly expressed in terms of the body

reference velocity:

∂tu = −wρf , v = wρg. (12)

2.4. Biochemical oscillator

The fluid (cytosolic) phase contains small molecules which may perform

regulatory function. A regulator species diffuses and is advected by the fluid

phase, such that its concentration c obeys:

∂tc+ ∂x(wc) = Dc∂
2
xc, (13)

where Dc is the diffusion coefficient of the regulator species. In the present

paper, we consider that either calcium ions or any other species whose con-

centrations are governed or regulated by them act as the ”regulator species”

c. Although other ions like magnesium can also slow down the activity of the

molecular motor myosin V [50], we will use the term ”regulator species” c and

calcium as synonyms.

The regulation of the activity of the cell can be performed by increasing

or decreasing the active tension T . We consider that both the activity of the

molecular motors and the active tension T are decreased as the concentration

9



of the regulator species c (calcium) increases. We model this effect by the

expression:

T = To − ξ
c

1 + c
, (14)

where To is an homogeneous active tension produced by a constant density of

molecular motors and ξ is the coupling strength between the concentration c

and the active tension. The coupling strength determines if the regulator (c)

activates (ξ < 0) or inhibits (ξ > 0) the active tension. Both cases have been

compared in related models of active gels [51].

We consider the dynamics of two biochemical species c and a for calcium

and the control species, respectively. On the one hand, calcium ions regulate

the active tension of the cell, on the other hand they interact with other com-

ponents of the medium and produce dynamics that follow non-linear evolution

equations. The dynamics of calcium and the control species, whose interplay

induces oscillations of the concentration of calcium ions, are modelled by the

reaction-advection-diffusion equations (15, 16):

∂tc+ ∂x(wc) = ψRc(c, a) +Dc∂
2
xc, (15)

∂ta+ ∂x(wa) = ψRa(c, a) +Da∂
2
xa, (16)

where ψ−1 determines the temporal scale of the dynamics and the functions

Rc(c, a) and Ra(c, a) describe the reaction kinetics of calcium and the control

species, respectively. The concentrations c and a can accumulate due to the ad-

vection of the fluid phase. An earlier one-dimensional model for mechanochem-

ical waves [3] was based on a constant average concentration of calcium and

corresponds to the special case Rc = Ra = 0. Such an assumption is, however,

not realistic for calcium concentration in living cells, where calcium is always

regulated by other species, here summarized in the additional variable a. Many

previous studies, see e.g. [39, 52], show that calcium oscillations are crucial for

the intracellular dynamics of Physarum.

The calcium oscillator is accounted for by a model with simple reaction

10



terms, following the Brusselator model [53]:

Rc(c, a) = A+ c
2a−Bc− c, (17)

Ra(c, a) = −c
2a+Bc, (18)

where the parameters A and B determine the conditions, especially the fre-

quency and amplitude of the oscillations. The homogeneous steady state so-

lution is given by the concentrations c = co = A and a = ao = B/A. This

solution is stable for B < 1 + A2 and it becomes unstable through a Hopf bi-

furcation such that the system oscillates if B > 1 + A2. Here, we keep A = 1

and we vary the parameter B above and below the critical value Bc = 2. Tak-

ing into account the diffusion in the spatially extended Brusselator model, the

homogeneous solution is unstable to a Turing instability if B >
(

,

see ref. [54] for more details. The dimensional constant ψ in Eqs. (15, 16) is

adjusted together with A and B to match the period of the calcium oscillations

observed in Physarum. The Turing instability demands that the diffusion co-

efficient of the control species a is sufficiently larger than that of the regulator

c, i.e., Da ≫ Dc, which is a condition that is complicated to fulfill, due to the

usually large diffusion coefficients of ions associated with the variable c. In fact,

the the opposite limit Da < Dc is the more realistic situation. Therefore, we

consider the case where Da = 0 in the following section whereas the Turing

instability is not discussed.

2.5. Linear stability analysis

Let us consider the entire set of equations that we have derived so far:

0 = η∂2xw − E∂
2
xu− ∂xT − βw, (19)

∂tu = −wρf , (20)

∂tc = −∂x(wc) + ψ(A+ c
2a−Bc− c) +Dc∂

2
xc, (21)

∂ta = −∂x(wa) + ψ(−c
2a+Bc), (22)

where ψ represents the time scales of the chemical kinetics. The parameter

values for Physarum employed below are summarized in Table 1. The spatially

11



homogeneous steady state of Eqs. (11-15) is given by constant concentrations

(c = co = A and a = ao = B/A) in a static two-phase system (w = 0 and

u = 0). The linear stability analysis of this steady state with respect to small

periodic perturbations (δw, δu, δc, δa)eikx+λt follows from the Jacobian

Figure 1: Two analytic phase diagrams in the parameter space spanned by F and B, obtained

from the dispersion relations for two different values of M : (a) M = 1 and (b) M = 3. Three

main regions are observed: homogeneous steady state (white), global oscillations (blue), and

waves (red and orange). The dispersion relations of the waves in the red domain possess a

maximum with complex values (see Fig.3(a)), whereas the maximum of dispersion relation of

the wave in the orange domain has purely real values (see Fig. 3(b)). For comparison, the

vertical dashed line marks the oscillatory instability of the ”pure” Brusselator, whereas the

horizontal dashed line indicates the mechanochemical instability in the absence of reaction

found in [3]. Crosses show the parameter values used in the dispersion relations plotted in

Fig. 3. Parameters of the model: ℓ = 1, ρf = 0.5, Dc = 1, ψ = 0.125, A = 1.

corresponds to the ratio of the diffusive to advective time scales. In the absence

of any reaction ψ = 0 and of any elastic components (E = 0), the critical Péclet

number (1 + A)2/A determines the onset of the mechanochemical instability

in the absence of reaction [3] and depends on the steady state concentration

co = A. The condition F > 1 (F < 1) decides if the homogeneous state is

unstable (stable).

2.6. Phase diagram

Figure 1 shows the phase diagram of the model, obtained by calculation

of the dispersion relations solving Eq. (25). The non-dimensional mechanical

13



parameters F and M , and the chemical parameter B of the Brusselator are

varied to characterize the parameter space. For small values of B and F the

homogeneous state is stable. Increasing B and F the homogeneous state be-

comes unstable through an oscillatory Turing instability and wave solutions are

expected. Two types of waves are observed (orange and red domains of Fig.

1). Their characteristics are described in detail in the following section. Fur-

thermore, a region where the Hopf instability leads to global oscillations is also

obtained for small values of F .

When keeping F = 0 and increasing the value of B above the critical value

Bc the homogeneous state becomes unstable through a Hopf bifurcation, that is

characteristic for the Brusselator model [54]. On the other hand, in the absence

of any reaction, i.e., ψ = 0, and increasing the value of F above the critical

value Fc, the homogeneous state becomes unstable through a wave instability

due to the mechano-chemical properties of the poroelastic medium [3]. When

both forces are combined, the homogeneous state becomes unstable for values

of B and F below the critical values Bc and Fc, respectively, i.e., in the area

below the dashed line in Fig. 1.

The effect of F is partially precluded by an increase of M , compare both

panels in Fig. 1, as the effect of increasing M shifts the bifurcations to higher

values of F . A more detailed study of the effect of M is shown in Fig. 2. For

B < Bc (Fig. 2(a,b)), an increase of M shifts the transition from the stable

uniform state to waves towards higher values of F . For the case B > Bc, the

behavior is different (Fig. 2(c,d)): The large value of B implies that the system

is already unstable due to a Hopf bifurcation for small active forces. Waves

appear for F > 0.5, independently of the value of M .

2.7. Dispersion relations

Figure 3 shows four examples of characteristic dispersion relations for the be-

haviors displayed in Fig 1. Their locations on the corresponding phase diagram

are indicated in Fig 1(a). For small values of F and B the homogeneous state is

stable, see Fig 3(c). Upon increase in the parameter B the characteristic Hopf

bifurcation occurs and the maximal eigenvalue is found for k = 0 (Fig 3(d)).

For larger values of F , wave instabilities are observed, see Fig 3(a). Further in-

creases of F cause the maximum of the real eigenvalue to become purely real in

the interval 0.2 ≤ k ≤ 0.5 (Fig. 3(b)), there are, however, unstable eigenvalues

with an imaginary component once k > 0.5 , see Fig 3(b).

We distinguish two types of wave instabilities if the largest unstable eigen-

value is either complex or real. For ψ = 0 the first type of dispersion curve

has been found to produce chaotic patterns (Fig 3(a)), while the second type

of dispersion curve (see Fig 3(b)) gave rise to travelling domains [3]. Note that

with reaction such dynamics may change, because for ψ > 0 the properties of

16



the patterns may depend on the particular value of ψ.

3. Experimental observation of cell thickness oscillations in proto-

plasmic droplets of Physarum

3.1. Experimental materials and methods

Plasmodia of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum, strain HU195×HU200,

were cultured on moist filter paper by feeding with oat flakes (Kölln Flocken)

at 21 ◦C in the dark. Sclerotia were obtained by drying the wet filter paper

on which a sufficient amount of the plasmodium had crawled. Sclerotia were

stored in the dark for 3 – 10 months. The sclerotium is a dormant, dehydrated

state of Physarum that may convert back into the plasmodium whence the

environmental conditions turn favorable again.

Plasmodia were grown from germinated sclerotia in 9 cm polystyrene Petri

dishes on 1.0% w/v (weight/volume) plain agar gels (Kobe Agar). Protoplasmic

droplets were obtained by puncturing a strand (of 1.0 – 1.5 mm diameter) of

the plasmodial network with a scalpel, collecting ≈ 0.5 µl of protoplasm with a

micropipette, and depositing the extracted protoplasm on a polypropylene Petri

dish containing a nutrient-free, 1.0% w/v plain agar. Within a few seconds the

protoplasmic droplet forms a plasma membrane, thus becoming a new cell,

which begins its cellular reorganization.

The Petri dish with the protoplasmic droplet is placed under a microscope,

covered, and the temperature kept constant at 21.0 ± 0.5 ◦ C by the laboratory

air conditioning system. The Petri dish was illuminated homogeneously from

below by a an array of 60 green LEDs (LedGalaxy, JDR-2760-G, Hamburg,

Germany) emitting at λ = 517 ± 20 nm. A sheet of frosted glass and a neutral

filter (1.0 o.d.) were placed in between the light source and the Petri dish.

The dynamics of the protoplasmic droplet was monitored from above through a

microscope (Zeiss Stemi SV11, Göttingen, Germany, magnification 19.6×) by an

8 bit charge controlled device (CCD) camera (Hamamatsu Photonics ST70CE,

Hamamatsu, Japan). The images were collected at intervals of 4.2 ± 0.2 s with

i.e., a resolution of 0.0456 mm/px. The frames were transferred to a computer

for data processing and analysis.

As the brightness of the transmitted light through the protoplasmic droplets

is inversely proportional to their thickness, relative thickness oscillations can

be assessed by image analysis. The background was subtracted from all origi-

nal images. Next, each background-subtracted image was subtracted from its

preceding image, and the increase or decrease in thickness was coded by grey

levels. Regions, where the thickness of the protoplasmic droplet increased and

decreased were coded in bright and dark grey, respectively.

18



3.2. Experimental results

A droplet of freshly extracted protoplasm forms a cell membrane within a

few seconds, thus forming a new cell that contains many nuclei. This freshly

formed cell must be considered as being highly disturbed as it was formed from

recently extracted protoplasm. This cell begins to reorganize itself and to un-

dergo intracellular differentiation processes in order to form a viable cell.

After the formation of the cell membrane, the protoplasmic droplets re-

mained quiescent for 10 – 12 min. Then, they began to develop macroscopic

oscillations of their cell thickness. These oscillations generally start at the rim

of the droplet, forming circular waves of cell thickness at the rim. A few minutes

later, the bulk of the cell also started to vary its thickness. Initially these oscil-

lations are aperiodic and irregular in time and space, but after some while, more

coherent dynamic structures are formed. In addition to thickness oscillations in

the bulk of the droplet, the shape of the droplet oscillates displaying a series of

oscillation modes.

Once the bulk oscillations become more coherent, these oscillations can be

classified according to their spatio-temporal appearance. For instance, typical

oscillatory cell thickness patterns observed are global oscillations (where the rim

oscillates in anti-phase with the bulk of the cell; Fig. 4(a-e)), propagating waves

of cell thickness (Fig. 4(f-j)), or standing wave-like oscillations (Fig. 4(k-o)). In

addition to these patterns of uni-axial symmetry, patterns with different sym-

metries, such as spiral-shaped waves or pairs of counter-rotating spiral-shaped

waves of cell thickness are also observed, as well as aperiodic, irregular cell thick-

ness oscillations. Although these different types of oscillatory patterns may last

for some time, all of them transient, and they may easily convert into each

other. In our experiments, we did not observe any determined temporal sequel

of patterns of thickness oscillations. Rather, the temporal sequel of cell thick-

ness oscillations was random, as was the persistence of the different types of

oscillations.

Although the transitions between the different types of thickness oscillations

were random, we could observe a certain correlation between the size of the pro-

19



toplasmic droplet and the wave form developed. Whereas global cell thickness

oscillations as well as standing and travelling-wave type thickness oscillations

were more frequently observed in small protoplasmic droplets, counter-rotating

spiral-shaped thickness oscillations were more frequently seen in larger proto-

plasmic droplets, i.e., droplets of diameters larger than 150 µm. This suggests

that the type of thickness oscillations patterns that develop in microplasmodia,

may depend on the extension and geometry of the protoplasmic droplet, and

hence on the ability of the droplet to accommodate the different forms of oscil-

lations.

4. Active poroelastic model for Physarum protoplasmic droplets

In this section we apply the generic poroelastic model described in Section 2

to protoplasmic droplets of Physarum. First, the parameter values of the model

are chosen form the literature for the particular case of Physarum. Where phys-

ical parameter values for Physarum were not available in the literature, we use

values obtained for other types of eukaryotic cells. The chemical parameters A,

B and ψ are chosen to reproduce the oscillation period of calcium oscillations

in Physarum [39, 52]. The stability analysis of the equations is performed using

the set of values tabulated in the right column of Table 1. Second, numeri-

cal simulations of the model with the chosen parameter values are done and

compared with the experimental results.

4.1. Parameter values

The cytosol is fluid. Assuming that the cytosol is a diluted aqueous suspen-

sion, its viscosity may be assumed to be similar to that of water (ηwater = 10
−3

Pa s). However, it is known that small particles in the cytosol increase this

viscosity, and the value of ηf may increase by a factor two or three [12].

The viscoelastic properties of the cytoskeleton have been extensively mea-

sured by atomic force microscopy. Typical values of the elastic (Young) modulus

of mammalian cells are between 1 and 10 kPa [55], although cardiac cells may

have Young moduli larger than 100 kPa [55, 56]. Experiments with Physarum

yielded a Young modulus of ≈ 9 kPa [57].

The viscosity ηg of the cytoskeleton can be assessed from experiments run

with various cell types, for example, for the cytoskeleton in neutrophils a value

of ηg = 130 Pa s is observed [58]. However, from experiments inducing large

deformations in Physarum cells much smaller values are obtained (i.e., 1 Pa s

[59]).

The volume fractions of the solvent and gel phases are assumed to be con-

stant. By hyperosmotic shocks the minimal fluid fraction of HeLa cells was

estimated to be ρf = 0.35 from the total decrease of the cell volume [11, 60].

Recent studies of passive poroelasticity have used a value of ρf = 0.75 [12] and,

therefore ρg = 0.25 for the gel phase. These values, together with the cytosol

viscosity yield a renormalized viscosity η = 0.09 kPa s.

The characteristic mesh size of the porous structure of the cytoskeleton has

been calculated from experiments in living cells. Typical results obtained for

HeLa cells point to ℓm = 15 nm [12, 60]. However, larger values for the porous

structure were used previously in the mathematical modelling of the Physarum

cell: ℓm = 50 − 200 nm [45, 61]. Here we have chosen an intermediate value

of ℓm = 0.1 µm. Using this value for the pore size, the permeability κ can

be obtained from the relation κ = ℓ2m, yielding a value of κ = 0.01 µm

parameter β can be calculated from the solvent viscosity as β = ηf/κ = 0.0002

µm.

The concentrations c and a are dimensionless. The steady state of the Brus-

selator model corresponds to the equilibrium concentration c = A and in order

to have comparable variables to the previous studies on active poroelastic me-

dia [3], we choose A = 1. In the limit ψ = 0 we recover the results shown in

ref. [3]. The parameter ψ corresponds to a characteristic time, which is fitted to

ψ = 0.125 s−1 to reproduce the characteristic time scale of the calcium oscilla-

22



tions in Physarum with the Brusselator model. The characteristic time scale of

the calcium oscillations is found to be ≈ 1 min [39, 52]. The critical frequency

of the limit cycle at the bifurcation is ω = ψA [54] which produces a period of

T = 2π/(ψA).

4.2. Phase diagram

The phase diagram in the phase plane spanned by the mechanical force

parameter F , which represents the active force, and the parameter B of the

Brusselator (i.e., the chemical reaction system) was calculated using the esti-

mated parameter values for Physarum (see Table 1). The phase diagrams were

calculated using two different values for the elastic (Young) modulus E (Fig. 5).

Similarly to the parameter space of the generic model shown in Fig. 1, a homo-

geneous steady state and wave patterns dominate the phase diagram (Fig. 5).

The domain of global oscillations is restricted to a smaller area of the phase dia-

gram in comparison with the generic phase diagram (Fig. 5), because we obtain

large values of the active mechanical force F using the parameters estimated for

Physarum.

For smaller values of B (B < Bc = 2), the increase of the active mechanical

force F destabilizes the homogeneous steady state through the appearance of

a wave instability. For larger values of the chemical parameter (B > Bc), the

active mechanical force F causes a change from global oscillations to a wave

instability. Further increase of the active force F alters the structure of the

dispersion relation and more complex patterns may arise [3].

The change of the value of the Young modulus E between both panels in

Fig. 5 leads to two different values of F that are needed for the instability to

occur. In the absence of any reaction, i.e., ψ = 0, the critical values of the

control parameter are F = 38.5 and F = 338.5, for E = 1 kPa and E = 9 kPa,

respectively.

4.3. Numerical results

We integrate Eqs. (19-22) numerically in a one-dimensional domain using

a finite differences method. We assume a fixed droplet without motion of the

23



membrane boundaries, therefore, we impose zero-flux boundary conditions for

c and a and Dirichlet conditions for the fields w and u, i.e., w(0) = w(L) = 0

and u(0) = u(L) = 0.

The process of pattern formation depends on the initial condition. We start

with a homogeneous spatial distribution of the biochemical concentrations a, c

of the control and regulator species, respectively. This initial distribution is per-

turbed to yield the formation of spatio-temporal patterns. Here, small random

perturbations are added to the initial homogeneous state to generate waves,

whereas the application of large homogeneous perturbations to the steady state

lead to the emergence of more coherent wave patterns, closer to global oscilla-

tions.

Figure 6 shows the spatio-temporal dynamics of the concentration c and

the thickness h for different parameters. We estimate the relative change in

thickness δh = (h − h0)/h0 with respect to the reference configuration h0 to

be proportional to ∂xu. This approximation is justified by the experimental

observation that regions in Physarum microplasmodia deform isotropically [34].

If z represents the coordinate orthogonal to x, the height is approximated by

δh ≈ ∂zuz. Then, isotropy gives δh ≈ ∂zuz ∝ ∂xux = ∂xu. This means that

large (small) values of ∂xu imply a local increase (decrease) of thickness of the

cell.

Travelling mechano-chemical waves are observed in the numerical simula-

tions under different conditions. Different examples are displayed in Fig. 6.

The boundary conditions produce inhomogeneous velocities of the waves and

large increases of both the concentration c and the thickness h at one of the ex-

tremes of the system. Such inhomogeneity in the deformation may produce the

motion of the whole droplet with free boundary conditions. The position where

the waves set in differs depending on the realization. In particular, Fig. 6(e)

shows a pacemaker generated close to the center of the system. More complex

dynamics is shown in Fig. 6(f), where travelling waves are generated alterna-

tively in both directions. This alternating dynamics in one dimension resembles

the spiral wave dynamics in two dimensions.

25



Wave structures with velocities of 5−30 µm/s have been observed in Physarum

[35]. In our experiments, we observe travelling waves of cell thickness (Fig. 4(f-

j)), the velocities of which are ≈ 15 µm/s. Such values are close to the wave

velocities observed in the numerical simulations, which are ≈ 25 µm/s.

Small amplitude standing waves are also shown in Fig. 6(c). They appear

at small values of the active tension and they seem to be transitory. Standing

waves have been also observed in the experiments (Fig. 4(k-o)).

Finally, global oscillations have also been observed in experiments where the

bulk of the cell oscillates in anti-phase to its rim (Fig. 4(a-e)). The periodically

oscillating dynamics of the bulk of the cell can be reproduced by numerical

simulations using the appropriate initial conditions, see Fig. 6(b). The me-

chanical deformation depends on the gradient of the active force, therefore, the

mechanical part remains static, and no deformation results. Under the same

parameter values, but with different initial conditions, travelling waves appear,

see Fig. 6(a). It may indicate that such global oscillations are unstable as in

Figs 6(e,f).

The condition of small strain ∂xu ≪ 1 used in the model derivation con-

strains the parameter space, where our model is applicable. The value of ∂xu

increases with active mechanical force F , thus, large values of the active force

were not employed in our numerical simulations. The strain also depends on

the elastic modulus E as small values of the modulus lead to large deforma-

tions and hence violate the condition of small strain. In such limits, turbulent

and complex dynamics are expected, already in the absence of any biochemical

reaction [3].

4.4. Spatio-temporal properties of the waves

The dispersion relations employed for the calculation of the phase diagram

shown in Fig. 5 are also used for the study of the spatio-temporal properties of

the non-linear patterns observed in the numerical simulations (Fig. 6).

First, we consider the characteristic length obtained from the dispersion

relation. The most unstable mode is typically correlated to the wavelength λ

Eqs. (19-22) for the parameters chosen to model Physarum for different values of the elastic

modulus: E = 1kPa (a), E = 5kPa (b) and E = 9kPa (c) and B = 2.1. For each value the

characteristic wavelength (top panels) and period (bottom panels) are shown. In top panels the

wavelengths associated to the most unstable mode (thick line) and the smallest wavelengths of

an unstable mode (thin line) are shown in comparison with the size of protoplasmic droplets

of Physarum (dashed line) employed in the simulations. In the bottom panels the periods

associated to the most unstable mode are shown (thick black line) when it exists and compared

with the results of the Brusselator model with the same parameters (red line). For the two

panels in (a) the case B=0 is also shown for comparison (blue lines). Vertical thin dashed

lines correspond to the values employed in the numerical simulations shown in Fig. 6.

27



of the patterns obtained in the full numerical simulations (Fig. 3). In Fig. 7

we show the dependence of the wavelength λ on the parameter F . If F → 0

the maximum corresponds to k = 0 because we recover the Hopf instability (we

employ B > Bc). For larger values of F the characteristic wavelength shrinks

to more realistic values in comparison with the size of the droplets (1 mm).

Pattern formation is, however, possible for small values of F because there are

unstable modes at smaller wavelength than the size of the droplets, for instance,

the wavelength associated to the larger unstable mode of the dispersion relation

(Fig. 7). Such unstable modes explain the patterns observed in the numerical

simulations as shown in Fig. 6. In fact, the thin vertical dashed lines in Fig. 7

correspond to parameter values of the numerical results in Fig. 6. For large

values of F the wavelengths converge to the values obtained in the system

with linear reaction (B = 0), see blue lines in Fig. 7(a), and indicate that the

viscoelastic properties of the model determines the final wavelength in the active

poroelastic model.

On the other hand, the results from the temporal dynamics based on the

dispersion relation are different. For some conditions the imaginary part of

the eigenvalues gives rise to oscillatory periods close to the period obtained

directly from the reaction model, without any type of transport, as seen from

the comparison of the black and red lines in the bottom panels of Fig. 7. The

oscillation frequency is almost constant in Fig. 7(b-c), and it explains that the

characteristic periods of the waves in Fig. 6 are independent of the parameters

F and E.

5. Discussion

We have combined an active poroelastic model for the cellular cytoplasm

with a generic reaction-diffusion model of a biochemical oscillator. Linear sta-

bility analysis and numerical simulations show the appearance of travelling and

standing waves. The resulting model, supplied with realistic parameter val-

ues from the experimental literature, reproduces the patterns obtained in our

28



experiments with protoplasmic droplets of Physarum polycephalum.

Our experiments on protoplasmic droplets show a large variety of behaviors

and different patterns of contraction of the cell thickness are found. In contrast

to a previous report [31], we do not observe any temporal directionality among

the appearance of patterns of cell thickness oscillations. The different patterns

appear randomly without any particular order. The protoplasmic droplet is in

the midst of a reorganization process to form a microplasmodium and, there-

fore, the different parameters values determining viscoelastic and active prop-

erties are continuously evolving with time. This parameter evolution highly

depends on the particular microplasmodia. For this reason, the comparison of

the phenomenological observations with the model results are of crucial impor-

tance, because the numerical simulations also show a rich variety of dynamic

cell thickness patterns as the parameter values are slightly varied.

A single active poroelastic system without any biochemical oscillator pro-

duces waves and complex dynamics [3]. In the particular case of Physarum

the mechanical deformations are coupled with calcium oscillations [32]. In the

present paper, we have shown that the combination of both effects, namely

poroelasticity and a biochemical oscillator enhances the region of pattern forma-

tion in comparison to a model that neglects the contribution of the biochemical

oscillator. Furthermore, we have shown that whereas the period of oscillations

is strongly controlled by the biochemical model employed, the spatial properties

of the patterns are determined by the viscoelastic properties of the system.

The typical wavelength of the patterns obtained using the parameter values

for Physarum (Table 1) range from 250 – 1000 µm (Fig. 7(c)). It is noteworthy

that these wavelengths correspond quite well to the wavelengths observed exper-

imentally in protoplasmic droplets but also to the wavelengths of undulations

formed by a finger instability at the leading edge (the so-called apical zone)

of extended macroplasmodia in Physarum [65]. Similarly to the protoplasmic

droplets the apical zone of extended plasmodia consists of a porous medium.

The active poroelastic system is defined by the velocity of the fluid (i.e.,

the cytosol) and the deformation of the gel (that is, the cytoskeleton). Similar

29



descriptions in terms of active materials have been used to model the cytoplasm

[10] as well as to describe cortical flows in polarized cells [66] as well as aspects

of cell motility [9]. The cytoplasm has also been modelled as an active fluid that

can transport the molecular motors [2] which at the same time produce active

tension in the fluid [2]. In contrast, here we considered the poroelasticity of the

cytoskeleton [12].

Models assuming an active cytoplasm [2, 62] provide an alternative approach

for the formation of patterns in the interior of cells compared to the standard

reaction-diffusion systems, which built an combination of diffusive transport of

molecules in the cell with biochemical reactions between different species. Such

models have been employed for example to explain cell polarity [63] or cellular

division of E. coli [64].

The latter examples explicitly consider different reactions inside the cell.

In the present paper, we have considered a simple qualitative reaction model

addressing the calcium oscillator in Physarum. However, the main details of

the calcium oscillator can be analyzed and a more complicated model can be

derived [45]. It may permit more quantitative comparison with experimental

results. However, the detailed mechanism coupling the calcium oscillations and

the mechanical contractions is still an open issue [35, 39, 42, 43] that calls for

further experimental studies.

A more complex description of the viscoelastic properties may also improve

the comparison with experiments. We have employed the Kelvin-Voigt model

for viscoelasticity which is a good model for short times. However, for some

applications with slow processes, one may consider the use of a different elastic

model like the Maxwell model of viscoelastic fluids. Moreover, we have restricted

our calculations to linear viscoelasticity which is not true for large deformations

of the cytoplasm, where nonlinear elasticity need to be included.

We have considered here a simple one-dimensional system to analyze the

equations and to perform the numerical simulations. Obviously, two- or even

three-dimensional systems provide more complete descriptions. In the present

paper, for the sake of simplicity, we restrict our study to the one-dimensional

30



case which, nevertheless, allows the investigation of uniaxial patterns and their

comparison to corresponding experiments.

In summary, we have extended the one-dimensional active poroelastic model

derived in [3] by introduction of a biochemical oscillator. For simplicity, we have

employed the generic Brusselator oscillator. The resulting model reproduces a

variety of experimentally observed uniaxial patterns observed in protoplasmic

droplets of Physarum polycephalum.
