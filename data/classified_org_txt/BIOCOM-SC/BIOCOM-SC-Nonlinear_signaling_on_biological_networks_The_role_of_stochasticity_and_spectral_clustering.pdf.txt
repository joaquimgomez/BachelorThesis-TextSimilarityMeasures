Signal transduction within biological cells is governed by networks of interacting proteins. Communication
between these proteins is mediated by signaling molecules which bind to receptors and induce stochastic
transitions between different conformational states. Signaling is typically a cooperative process which requires
the occurrence of multiple binding events so that reaction rates have a nonlinear dependence on the amount
of signaling molecule. It is this nonlinearity that endows biological signaling networks with robust switchlike
properties which are critical to their biological function. In this study we investigate how the properties of these
signaling systems depend on the network architecture. Our main result is that these nonlinear networks exhibit
bistability where the network activity can switch between states that correspond to a low and high activity level.
We show that this bistable regime emerges at a critical coupling strength that is determined by the spectral structure
of the network. In particular, the set of nodes that correspond to large components of the leading eigenvector of
the adjacency matrix determines the onset of bistability. Above this transition the eigenvectors of the adjacency
matrix determine a hierarchy of clusters, defined by its spectral properties, which are activated sequentially
with increasing network activity. We argue further that the onset of bistability occurs either continuously or
discontinuously depending upon whether the leading eigenvector is localized or delocalized. Finally, we show
that at low network coupling stochastic transitions to the active branch are also driven by the set of nodes that
contribute more strongly to the leading eigenvector. However, at high coupling, transitions are insensitive to
network structure since the network can be activated by stochastic transitions of a few nodes. Thus this work
identifies important features of biological signaling networks that may underlie their biological function.

I. INTRODUCTION

A wide variety of intracellular processes are governed by
signal transduction between different components of the cell
[1,2]. Typically, signaling occurs at proteins which change
their conformational state in response to the presence of a
signaling molecule. These molecules are emitted at a source
and are transported to the location of the receptor, after
which they proceed to trigger a sequence of events leading
to a cellular response. Using this mechanism the cell is able
to control signals in space and time in order to regulate
biological function [3]. Signaling networks which utilize this
system are, for example, protein-protein interaction networks,
transcriptional regulation, and excitation-contraction coupling
in muscle tissue [4–9]. In many of these systems signal
transduction is a cooperative process where multiple binding
events have to occur in order to trigger a response. Thus the
response of a receptor is typically a nonlinear function of the
local concentration of the signaling molecule. Also, receptors
are often closely packed into clusters so that a response at
one receptor influences the behavior of a nearby receptor.
This architecture allows the group of receptors to amplify
small concentration changes of the signaling molecule. In this
way signal transduction systems can perform robust switchlike
operations similar to that found in electronic systems [3].

During signaling receptors modulate their transition rates
between discrete conformational states. Thus signaling is
an inherently stochastic process which is characterized by
probability distributions of the various accessible states. In
many cases these probabilities are typically sigmoid functions
which relate the response of a receptor to the concentration
of the signaling molecules [4]. Another important feature of

cellular signaling transduction is that the motion of the signal-
ing molecule certainly deviates from that of a random walk.
This is because the intracellular space is filled with organelles
and various obstructions so that a diffusing molecule has to
navigate between complex intracellular structures. Also, the
transmission of signals occurs through a hierarchy of intracel-
lular transport mechanisms. For instance, in many systems the
signaling molecule moves as cargo along microtubules, where
molecular motors shuttle the signaling molecule between the
source and target [10,11]. In this way signals can be transmitted
between distant regions of the cell. Thus the connections
between signaling proteins can be complex and are likely an
important component of the biological function.

Given that signal transduction involves a large number
of receptors with complex connections it is natural that the
tools of network science can be applied to understand their
dynamics. To date there has been a great deal of work in
this direction and key insights have been gained using this
interdisciplinary approach [2,7,9]. In this study we explore the
general behavior of signaling networks in which nodes are
regulated by reaction rates that have a nonlinear dependence
on the states of connected nodes. Our main finding is that
these networks exhibit bistability where the system can reside
either in an active branch, where a large number of nodes
are activated, or an inactive branch in which the network is
largely quiescent. We analyze the nature of the bistability and
show that the onset, and stochastic transitions between the
stable branches, are dictated by the community structure of
the network. While this work is motivated by cellular signaling
networks the main results may also be applied in a wide variety
of contexts. The fundamental requirement is simply that nodes
on the network communicate in a cooperative fashion so that

the local response is a nonlinear function of the activity of
connected nodes. Potential applications of this work outside
of signaling networks are, for example, in rumor spreading
[12] where a member of the population acquires a belief with
a probability that increases nonlinearly with the number of
people who transmit that belief. This assumption is based on
classic experiments in human cognition which have shown
that the beliefs of individuals are strongly dependent on the
number of people who repeat that belief [13,14]. This implies
that there should be a range of contexts where the response of
nodes is inherently nonlinear. Thus the work presented here
can potentially be applied to a broad range of complex systems
where information spread is both stochastic and nonlinear.

A. Network of stochastic signaling units

In this study we develop a network model that shares basic
features with signaling systems observed in biological cells. In
particular, our model will be based on the Ca signaling system
which is utilized to regulate a vast number of subcellular
processes such as muscle contraction and gene transcription
[6,15]. In this model each node corresponds to a biological
receptor which responds in a nonlinear fashion to inputs from
connected receptors. Specifically, we consider a network of
N nodes where node i is described using a state variable
ηi , which can be ηi = 0 (inactive) or ηi = 1 (active). Each
node undergoes stochastic dynamics with a two state reaction
scheme,

0
αi−⇀↽−
βi

1, (1)

where αi is the activation rate, and where βi is the rate of
inactivation. The forward rate is given by αi = gi cγi where ci
is the concentration of the signaling molecule at node i, and
where gi is a constant proportional to the excitability of that
node. Here, γ is an exponent which controls the degree of
sensitivity of that node to changes in the concentration of the
signaling molecule. In the Ca system receptors typically have
multiple binding sites so that activation of receptor proteins is
a cooperative process which requires that γ > 1. In this study
we will consider the case γ = 2. In the discussion we will
discuss more generally how this parameter dictates the overall
dynamics of the system. The local signaling concentration is
given by

ci(t) = co + r
∑
j �=i

Aij ηj (t), (2)

where co is a constant that sets the background activity of each
site in the absence coupling. Coupling between network nodes
is dictated by the matrix Aij which gives a measure of how site
j influences the response at site i. In our previous study we
studied the case where connections depended on the distance
between nodes [16]. Here, we will consider networks with long
range connections that can be applied to more general signaling
networks. For simplicity we consider the case where Aij = 1 if
there is a connection between node i and j , and Aij = 0 if there
is no connection. In this case Aij corresponds to the network
adjacency matrix. Also, the parameter r gives the strength
of connection between nodes. We stress here that this network
model is general in the sense that it can describe a wide range of

systems in which communication between nodes is mediated
by the amount of an agent, in this case the concentration
ci , which regulates the local response in a nonlinear manner.
This model is similar to the susceptible-infected-susceptible
(SIS) model that is used to describe disease spreading [17,18].
However, in the SIS model co = 0 and γ = 1 [19,20], so that
a node can only be infected by a connected node, and the
response is a linear function of the network activity.

In this study we will simplify the system and treat
each node as identical so that gi = g and βi = β. Without
loss of generality we can choose time units such that
β = 1, so that the forward rate is then simplified to αi =
η[1 + ξ ∑

j �=i Aij ηj (t) ]
γ , where η = gcγo /β and ξ = r/co.

Thus the network dynamics is determined by two dimension-
less parameters, η which is a measure of the excitability of
nodes, and ξ which denotes the strength of coupling. Also,
we will focus on the regime where there is low background
activity so that co is small, and η � 1 and ξ � η. To
describe our network of nodes we denote the number of
connections to site i as ki =

∑
j �=i Aij . We can also define

the average number of connections to all nodes in the network
as 〈k〉 = (1/N) ∑N

i=1 ki . To compare different networks, it is
convenient to study system properties as a function of the
variable s = ξ 〈k〉. This parameter features prominently in our
analysis and will be referred to as the coupling strength.

B. Dynamics on the Erdös-Rényi network

As a starting point we will first consider the dynamics of
nodes on an Erdös-Rényi (ER) network [21] in which the
probability that two nodes are connected is given by a fixed
probability q. To characterize the activity of the network we
compute the fraction of nodes that are active (ηi = 1) at time
t given by

p(t) = 1
N

N∑
i=1

ηi(t). (3)

To explore the range of possible behaviors we will consider
an ensemble of initial conditions where the activity level of the
network is varied. To do this we choose initial conditions such
that ηi = 1 at site i with probability h, and ηi = 0 otherwise.
Here, we simulate K = 10 initial conditions where h = i/K ,
and where i = 0,1, . . . ,K . In this way we explore the time
evolution of a range of random initial conditions from the
fully inactive to fully active network. For the ER network
we note that there is a percolation transition at qc ≈ 1/N ,
and we will consider networks both above and below the
percolation threshold. In Figs. 1(a)–1(c) we plot p(t) vs t
for a three different values of the connectivity s, and with
fixed excitability η = 0.005. Here, we consider a system
of N = 500 nodes and with q = 0.03 which is above the
percolation threshold at qc = 0.002. Our simulations reveal
that there are three qualitatively different behaviors. For low s
[Fig. 1(a)] we find that all initial conditions evolve towards a
steady state where p(t) ∼ 0 in a time scale roughly τR ∼ 10.
For larger s [Fig. 1(b)] we find that the system is bistable
and can evolve, depending upon initial conditions, to both an
active [p(t) � 0] and inactive branch [p(t) ∼ 0]. Finally, for
even larger s [Fig. 1(c)] the inactive branch disappears and

FIG. 1. The network activity p(t) as a function of time for a range of initial conditions. Here, we use an ER network of size N = 500 that
is above the percolation threshold (q = 0.03), and with fixed excitability η = 0.005. (a) Inactive phase with s = 24. (b) Bistable phase with

the system evolves to the active branch with p(t) ∼ 1 on a
time scale shorter than the relaxation time τR . To visualize
the possible steady states of the system we compute the
quantity p∞ = p(T ), where T is taken to be much longer
than the relaxation time τR . In Fig. 1(d) we show a density
plot of the distribution of p∞ for the last 50 time units
of a simulation up to T = 100. Here, the steady state data
for all K = 10 initial conditions is included in order to
give a global picture of the possible steady states of the
system. Our results show that for s < sa all initial conditions
evolve to a low activity state where p(t) ∼ 0. For s > sa a
bistable regime appears where the system evolves to either
an active [p(t) � 0] or inactive [p(t) ∼ 0] phase depending
upon the initial conditions. Finally, for s > sb we find that all
initial conditions evolve to the active branch. Now, below the
percolation threshold we find that the network dynamics is
substantially different. In Figs. 2(a)–2(c) we plot p(t) vs t for
a range of connectivity, and for a network with q = 0.0015.
To visualize the possible steady states, in Fig. 2(d), we show
a density plot of the distribution of p∞ vs s. In this regime
we find that the steady state activity of the network increases
gradually above a critical connectivity sc and no bistability is
observed.

An important feature of our signaling network is that the
activity level can have distinct steady states. This feature is
important since the biological function of these networks is
likely dictated by the dynamics towards and between these
equilibrium states. Here, we will consider the dynamics of the
network and explore how the active state is reached from an

initially inactive state where p(t) = 0. As a starting point we
first consider a network with q > qc and a range of connectivity
s > sa such that the active branch is stable. In this case we find
that if stochastic fluctuations drive p(t) to a threshold pth =
0.25 then the system will almost certainly evolve to the active
branch. Thus we can define a waiting time tw as the time for an
initially inactive system, with p(t) = 0, to reach the threshold
at p(tw) = pth. In Fig. 3(a) we plot the average waiting time
〈tw〉 as a function of the connectivity s. Here, we find that
as the parameter s is decreased from above then the mean
waiting time 〈tw〉 increases exponentially. This result shows
that the stable branch is only observed providing 〈tw〉 � T ,
and therefore that the critical onset at s = sb is sensitive to the
simulation time. Indeed, as s decreases just below sb the mean
waiting time is substantial (〈tw〉 ∼ 2000), and decreasing s
further leads to prohibitively long simulation times. Thus for a
simulation time of T � τR the system exhibits bistability over
a broad range of s. On the other hand, below the percolation
threshold there is no gap between the active and inactive phase.
In this case we can compute the mean waiting time to reach an
arbitrarily chosen activity level peq , providing that peq < p∞.
In our simulation, shown in Fig. 3(b), we pick peq = 0.2, and
show that 〈tw〉 increases as s is decreased to the level where
pth ≈ p∞. Thus, below the percolation threshold, spreading
activity increases gradually to a well defined steady state and
threshold behavior is not observed.

To summarize, an ER network above the percolation transi-
tion exhibits bistability where initial conditions evolve towards
an active or inactive steady state in a time scale τR ∼ 10 − 20.

FIG. 3. Mean waiting time 〈tw〉 as a function of the connectivity

take to reach the threshold p(tw) = pth. The waiting time is averaged
over 1000 independent simulation runs. (a) Average waiting time 〈tw〉
for an ER network above the percolation threshold and a threshold
pth = 0.25. (b) Average waiting time 〈tw〉 for an ER network below
the percolation threshold and a threshold pth = 0.20.

In this regime an inactive network can undergo stochastic
transitions to the active state on time scales 〈tw〉 � τR , and the
exponential growth of this time scale as s → sb ensures that
this bistability is observed for long simulation times T . Thus,
above the percolation transition, the ER network behaves like a
perfect switch with extremely rare transitions between distinct
states. On the other hand, below the percolation transition the
network response is graded and does not exhibit bistability. In
this case long dwell times between distinct network states are
not observed, and the system evolves to a final state that is
insensitive to initial conditions.

C. Dynamics on the Barabási-Albert network

In this study we will also explore dynamics on a Barabási-
Albert (BA) network [22]. These networks have a scale free
structure which has been observed in a variety of biological
signaling networks [8]. Briefly, a BA network is formed by
adding a sequence of m new nodes to an existing network of
nodes. Each new node added is then connected preferentially
to the nodes with larger degree. In Figs. 4(a)–4(e) we plot
trajectories of the activity p(t) for a BA network with m = 5,
and in Fig. 4(f) we plot the distribution of the steady state
p∞. Here, we find that all initial conditions evolve to the
inactive state providing our connectivity is below a critical
value s = sa ∼ 40 [Fig. 4(a)]. For sa < s < sb we find that the
system is bistable and stochastic transitions between the active

and inactive branch are observed. Here, transitions between
these states occur over time scales substantially longer than the
relaxation time of the network. Finally, for s > sb all initial
conditions evolve to the active branch [Fig. 4(d)]. Finally,
we note that at onset the active branch emerges at a gap
defined as 
 = p∞(sa) [Fig. 4(f)]. This gap is an important
characteristic of the BA network and will feature prominently
in our subsequent analysis.

To explore dynamics on the BA network we have computed
the mean lifetime of the active and inactive network states.
As a starting point, we simulate the evolution of an initially
inactive state which is reached with initial conditions ηi = 0.
In Fig. 5(a) (blue line) we plot the mean waiting time 〈tw〉
for an inactive system to transition to the active branch as a
function of the connectivity s. As in the ER network the waiting
time 〈tw〉 increases exponentially as s is decreased into the
bistable regime. However, unlike the ER network, transitions
to the active branch occur on shorter time scales which can
be observed deep into the bistable regime. We have also
computed the average waiting time for an active network to
transition to the inactive state. In this case [Fig. 5(a), black line]
the average waiting time 〈ta〉 increases exponentially as s is
increased above sa . Thus the network is bistable with stochastic
transitions between two distinct network states. Now, for
different network connectivity m, we find qualitatively similar
results. In Fig. 5(b) we plot the gap at onset 
 vs m, showing
that the two stable branches gradually merge as the network

connectivity m is decreased. In Fig. 5(c) we plot p∞ vs s for
m = 2 showing that the onset of the active branch at s = sa
emerges gradually although a small region of bistability is
observed. In this case stochastic fluctuations on the network
smear the gap and the transition appears continuous.

D. Deterministic mean-field theory

In order to understand the basic features of the network
dynamics we have developed a simplified mean-field theory
of the system. Following our previous work, we define pi(t)
to be the probability that the ith node is active [ηi(t) = 1] at
time t . The stochastic dynamics is then governed by the master
equation,

pi(t + τ ) = [1 − pi(t)](αiτ ) + pi(t)(1 − βτ ), (4)

where αiτ and βτ are the transition probability that node i
makes a 0 → 1 or 1 → 0 transition in the time interval τ .
To proceed we make the approximation that state variables
can be replaced by their averages so that ηj ≈ pj . In the
continuum limit the master equation then simplifies to the
system of equations

which gives a set of N coupled nonlinear equations for the
site probability pi . Here, we note that in the limit of low
background signaling co → 0, in which ξ � 1, and for the case
γ = 1, our deterministic equations reduce to the deterministic
limit of the SIS model. In this study we will focus mainly on
the nonlinear regime γ > 1 which is more relevant to signaling
in biological networks.

As a starting point, we will first consider the spatially
homogeneous case where pi = p and

∑
j �=i Aij = 〈k〉. The

mean-field equations then reduce to a single equation,

dp

dt
= η(1 + sp )γ (1 − p) − p, (6)

where s = ξ 〈k〉. This equation possesses stationary points that
satisfy the algebraic condition

η(1 + s p )γ (1 − p) − p = 0. (7)
In Fig. 6(a) we plot the solution to Eq. (7), with η = 0.005

and γ = 2, showing that the system is monostable for s < s1,
bistable in the range s1 < s < s2, and monostable for s > s2.
To estimate the turning points we note that η � 1, so that in
this regime the transitions between the monostable and bistable
states can be well approximated by s1 ≈ 2/√η and s2 ≈ 1/4η.

To study the full mean-field equations we will solve Eq. (5)
on both the ER and BA networks. To keep track of the activity
of the network we compute the quantity

p(t) = 1
N

N∑
i=1

pi(t), (8)

which corresponds to the activity level of the network. To
characterize the steady state we define p∞ = p(T ) where T is
taken to be much longer than the relaxation time of the system.
In Fig. 6(b) we plot p∞ as a function of s (red circles) for the ER
network above the percolation threshold. On the same graph
we also plot the solution of the mean-field equations shown in
Fig. 6(a) (blue dashed line). Indeed, we find that the steady state
activity level p∞ is well approximated by the stable branches of
the steady state solution of the mean-field approximation. On
the same graph we have also plotted the steady state probability
p∞ for an ER network below the percolation transition (q =
0.0015). In this case we observe markedly different behavior.
Here, we find that for s < s3 the steady state evolves to an
inactive state with p∞ ∼ 0 independently of initial conditions.
For s > s3 the network evolves to distinct steady states which
depend on the initial conditions picked. However, this regime
of multistability ends abruptly at a critical connectivity and the
system again becomes monostable.

We have also solved the mean-field equations on the BA
network. In Fig. 6(c) we plot p∞ vs s for a network with
connectivity m = 5. In this case the mean-field equations
exhibit bistability with the onset of the active branch at a
critical s = s1, where there is a well defined gap 
 between
the two branches. Furthermore, both branches remain stable up
to s = s2 after which the inactive branch is no longer a steady
state solution. Now, for different network connectivity m we
find similar results but with a gap 
 that grows approximately
linearly with m [Fig. 6(d)]. Here, we point out that the
mean-field equations on a BA network only display bistability
and never multistability. To check this observation we have

repeated the simulation up to N = 5000 nodes, and find that
indeed only bistability is observed with features similar to
that shown in Fig. 6(c). Also, this bistability appears to be
robust even in the case where the activation and inactivation
rates are heterogeneous. Thus the power law structure of the
BA network ensures a bistable response over a wide range of
conditions.

E. Onset of the active branch is dictated by the spectral
structure of the network

In this section we analyze our mean-field equations in
order to develop a phenomenological theory of the network
activity. Firstly, we note that our mean-field theory, along
with the assumption that all nodes are equivalent, served as
a good approximation to the steady state dynamics of the
ER network above the percolation transition. This result is
expected since for q > qc an ER network is dominated by
a giant component where all nodes share the same average
connectivity, and can thus be treated as equivalent. Now, in the
case where q < qc this assumption will not apply. In this case
it is reasonable to approximate the network as a collection
of clusters, where nodes within each cluster have a higher
than average connectivity, but nodes in different clusters are
unconnected or weakly connected. Within each cluster we can
apply our mean-field approximation so that the steady state of
the lth cluster is governed by the algebraic condition

η(1 + ξ 〈k〉lpl)γ (1 − pl) − pl = 0 , (9)

where 〈k〉l denotes the average connectivity of the lth cluster,
and where pl denotes the fraction of active nodes of that cluster.
For γ = 2 the onset of bistability of the lth cluster then occurs
at ξ 〈k〉l ≈ 2/√η and transitions back to monostability when
ξ 〈k〉l ≈ 1/4η. Now, note that the full network connectivity is
defined by the parameter s = ξ 〈k〉 where 〈k〉 is the average
connectivity of all N nodes. Thus the lth cluster is bistable for
sl1 < s < s

and

. (11)

To proceed, let us now order clusters within the network
such that 〈k〉1 > 〈k〉2 > · · · > 〈k〉K where K is the number of
distinct clusters. Here, the cluster l = 1 has the largest average
connectivity and will be referred to as the leading cluster. Now,
since s11 < s

2
1 < · · · < sK1 , then the leading cluster will be the

first to bifurcate to an active branch at the onset, s3 = s11 . At this
connectivity, the network, depending upon initial conditions,
can evolve so that the leading cluster resides on the active
branch at steady state. Now, if we denote the number of nodes
in the leading cluster to be n1, then the active branch will
have the steady state probability p∞(s1a ) ≈ n1/N . Therefore,
the gap between the active and inactive branch is related to the
size of the leading cluster according to

structure representing all nodes with φ1i > 0.2 in the center and the
high activity sites with η̄i > 0.5 highlighted in red.

Thus the gap gives a direct estimate of the fraction of
nodes that belong to the leading cluster of the network. Now,
as the connectivity is increased further then more clusters
will develop an active branch so that multiple clusters will
be bistable. Hence, if s > si1 for i < 1,2, . . . ,M then all
these clusters will contribute to the active branch and the
number of distinct steady states is 2M . This result explains
the multistability observed in Fig. 6(b), where different steady
states are reached depending upon initial conditions.

F. Onset of active branch dictated by leading eigenvectors
of the network adjacency matrix

Our phenomenological theory predicts that the onset of
the active branch is determined by the leading cluster in the
network. To identify this cluster we will apply standard results
in spectral clustering which identify clusters of nodes from
the eigenvectors of the network adjacency matrix [23,24].
In particular, we will identify the leading cluster as the set
of nodes which correspond to the large components of the
eigenvector �φ1 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of Aij .
In Fig. 7(a) (red circles) we plot the ordered components of the
leading eigenvector (φ1i) for a BA network with m = 2. Here,
components are normalized so that the maximum component is

1. In this case we observe that there are roughly ten nodes with
components substantially larger than the typical component
of the eigenvector, and it is reasonable to identify the leading
cluster as the set of nodes such that φ1i > 0.2. To compare
these nodes with the network activity we compute the running
average at each node defined as

η̄i =
1

T − Ta
T∑

t=Ta
ηi(t) 
t, (13)

where Ta is the time at which we begin the time average,
and where T is the final time. In these simulations we wait
for times much longer than the relaxation time of the system
(Ta � τR), so that the system reaches steady state before we
initiate the time average. Thus η̄i gives a measure of the activity
level at node i at steady state. In Fig. 7(a) (blue squares) we
show η̄i vs i for a network connectivity of s = 40 which is
close to the onset at sa [see Fig. 5(c)]. Here, we have again
ordered the components η̄i and normalized the vector so that
the largest component is 1. To compare activity levels with
the leading eigenvector; in Fig. 7(b) we map the network of
500 nodes. Here, we identify all nodes with φ1i > 0.2 and
place them within a circle at the center of the network map.
In the same arrangement we designate in red the high activity
sites with η̄i > 0.5. Indeed, we find that the most active parts
of the network coincide with the leading cluster which can
be identified using the leading eigenvector. To quantify the
relationship between eigenvector and steady state we have
also computed the Pearson correlation defined as

C( �φ1, �̄η) =
∑N

i
(η̄i − 〈η̄〉)(φ1i − 〈φ1〉)√∑N

i
(η̄i − 〈η̄〉)2

√∑N
i

(φ1i − 〈φ1〉)2
, (14)

which gives a measure of the correlation between activity
level and eigenvector. Here, C ∼ 0 implies no correlation
while C ∼ 1 corresponds to high correlation. Computing
this quantity for our network yields C = 0.73 which shows
that the active branch at onset is highly correlated with the
leading eigenvector of the system. This result confirms our
phenomenological theory which predicted that the onset of
the active branch is determined by the leading cluster of the
network.

In the ER network we find similar results. For this network
we analyze the case where q < qc in which we have a
continuous transition to the active branch at sc ≈ 11. In
Fig. 8(a) we plot the steady state activity η̄i after ordering
and on the same graph show the components of the leading
eigenvector. Here, we find that most components of �φ1 are zero,
and that the nonzero components identify isolated clusters
of the network which have higher connectivity than average.
Thus, empirically, we can identify the leading cluster as
the set of nodes with φ1i > 0.01. In Fig. 8(b) we plot the
nodes where η̄i > 0.5, and simultaneously the nodes at which
φ1i > 0.01. Indeed, we find that the steady state active sites
are correlated with the cluster associated with the leading
eigenvector. However, in this case we find that there are also
contributions from clusters associated with the eigenvectors
that correspond to the second and third largest eigenvalues.
This finding is not surprising since the spacing between
eigenvalues of the ER network is small for q < qc; it is

expected that clusters corresponding to each eigenvector have
similar strength making them contribute to the onset of the
active branch.

G. Structure of the leading eigenvector:
localization and delocalization

A basic prediction of our phenomenological theory is that
the onset of the active branch is determined by the clusters
associated with the leading eigenvectors of the network adja-
cency matrix. Therefore, at onset we expect that the structure
of the leading eigenvector will determine the transition to the
active branch. In particular, if the size of the leading cluster
is n1 then the gap between the inactive and active branch
at onset is just 
 = n1/N . Therefore, we can estimate 

by counting the components of the leading eigenvector with
magnitudes much larger than the typical component. In the
case of the ER network n1 is just the number of nodes with
components φ1i > 0.01. This simple criterion is remarkably
effective in identifying groups of highly connected nodes in
our ER network which are disconnected from the rest of the
nodes [Fig. 8(b)]. In Fig. 9(a) we plot � = n1/N as a function
of the linking probability q. This result indicates that � exhibits
a sigmoid dependence on q with a transition point close to

the percolation threshold at qc ∼ 1/N = 0.2 × 10−2. Thus for
q < qc the leading cluster is a small fraction of the network,
while for q > qc it grows to system size due to the emergence
of the giant component. In Fig. 9(b) we show the ordered
components of the leading eigenvector above and below the
percolation threshold. Indeed, we find that for q < qc the
leading eigenvector is localized at a small number of nodes,
while for q > qc the vector is delocalized across all nodes in
the system. Therefore, for q > qc the gap 
 to the active branch
occurs due to a discontinuous jump since the leading cluster
associated is effectively system size. However, for q < qc
we have that n1 ∼ 10 and 
 ∼ 0.02, which is substantially
smaller. In fact, in Fig. 2(d) we find that stochastic fluctuations
smear this gap so that it appears continuous in our simulations
of the steady state.

Now, an important question to address is whether the onset
of the active branch is a continuous or discontinuous transition
in the infinite system size limit N → ∞. To address this
question we have computed � vs N for an ER network above
and below the percolation threshold. In the ER network it
is well known that qc ≈ 1/N so that we can remain below
the percolation threshold by picking q = 1/2N and above
with q = 3/N . In Figs. 9(c) and 9(d) we plot � vs N
above and below the percolation threshold for system sizes
in the range 500 < N < 2000. Indeed, we find that below
the percolation transition the size of the leading eigenvector
decreases with increasing system size. However, above the
percolation transition the size is comparable to the system size
� ∼ 0.9 and does not change substantially with increasing
system size. These results suggest that in the limit N →
∞ we expect a continuous transition to the active branch
providing q < qc, and a discontinuous transition for q > qc.
Thus the qualitative nature of the transition is dependent on
the localization properties of the leading eigenvector of the
network adjacency matrix.

In the case of the BA network we find that the size of the
leading eigenvector depends crucially on the connectivity m.
In Fig. 10(a) we plot � vs m showing that the size of the leading
cluster increases linearly with connectivity m. In Fig. 10(b) we
plot � vs system size N at a fixed m = 5. Here, we observe
that � decreases with increasing N , which is consistent with
previous studies, showing that the leading eigenvector of a BA
network is localized [25]. This result implies that in the limit
N → ∞ then 
 → 0, so that the transition to the active branch
will be continuous. Here, we note that the leading cluster of
the BA network is substantially larger than that of the ER
network. Thus for a system of size N = 500 a clear gap is
observed in the BA network for m > 2, while for q < qc this
gap is smeared out by stochastic fluctuations of the network.

H. Role of noise

Our deterministic mean-field theory explains several impor-
tant features of the nonlinear stochastic network. In particular,
in the case of the ER network the mean-field equations
correctly describe the system above the percolation threshold.
However, for q < qc the stochastic model [Fig. 2(d)] does
not exhibit the multistability predicted by the mean-field
equations. To explain this discrepancy, we note that our
mean-field equations neglect the effect of noise. Indeed, when

we include a noise term in our mean-field equations we find
that the qualitative results of the full stochastic model are
reproduced. To understand this result let us consider a network
in which there are M disconnected clusters which possess a
stable active and inactive branch; i.e., these clusters are in the
bistable regime. It is then possible to pick initial conditions
so that only a fraction of these M clusters will evolve towards
the active state. Thus the deterministic equations can evolve
to the 2M possible stable states of the network. Now, in the
presence of noise, all of these clusters can be activated by
stochastic fluctuations. Thus the steady state active branch we
observe in the network dynamics corresponds to the case where
all M clusters are activated. In this way, the stochasticity of
the system reduces the dispersion of the network activity by
driving the system to the maximally activated state. However,
the role of noise is different in the BA network. Here, we
observe robust bistability, and noise only induces stochastic
transitions between the active and inactive branch. In this case
noise only modifies the range of the bistable regime and does
not qualitatively change the dependence on the connectivity of
the network.

I. Spreading dynamics is governed by fluctuations
at the leading cluster

In this section we will briefly address the question of
how signals spread on the network of nodes. In effect, we
ask how a network that is initially inactive, with ηi = 0 for
all i, evolves towards the active branch at steady state. To

address this question we will first consider a BA network
with m = 2 which exhibits the richest dynamical behavior
near threshold. In Fig. 11(a) we plot the number of active
nodes on the network n(t) as a function of time during a time
interval where there is a transition to the active state. Here,
we fix s = 39.8 which is just above the threshold at sa = 37.8
[see Fig. 5(c)]. In this case we observe that the transition
is initiated by stochastic fluctuations which can nucleate a
cascade of activation leading to the active branch. By studying
several initiation events we find that in this case roughly 20
nodes are active before a nucleation event. Thus transitions
between the inactive and active branches are nucleated by the
activation of a critical number of nodes nc ∼ 20. To uncover
the structure of these nodes we identify the active nodes when
the system reaches a fixed threshold of nc = 20. For each
node we proceed to compute the ratio Pi = ki/M where ki
is the number of times node i was active when the threshold
condition was reached in M = 2000 independent simulations.
Thus the vector �P gives the distribution of active sites at
threshold. In Fig. 11(b) we show a map of our system and
circle those sites that belong to the leading cluster of the
network. On the same graph we highlight in red the ten nodes
at which Pi is largest. Here, we find that near threshold there
is a strong correlation between active sites and the leading
cluster. Given that the connectivity of the node is strongly
correlated with its component in the leading eigenvector, this
result indicates that the nodes involved in the nucleation of
cascades in the network correlate well with the most connected
nodes. However, for large system connectivity s = 159.2 we

find that this stong correlation is lost. In this regime we see
that only one or two nodes need to fire to initiate spreading
on the network [Fig. 11(c)]. Indeed, a map of active sites
at a threshold nc = 1 reveals that nucleation can occur with
equal likelihood at any node on the network. In this case
stochastic fluctuations induce a full network activation and the
nucleation process is independent of the underlying network.
To quantify these observations in Fig. 12 we compute the
Pearson correlation between the leading eigenvector �φ1 and the
density of active sites at threshold �P (t). Indeed, we find that the
correlation between these quantities decreases monotonically
as s is increased from the onset of the active branch. Thus for
low connectivity the leading cluster dictates the sites where
the initiation of spreading occurs, while for high connectivity
spreading initiation is largely independent of the network
structure.

To explain our numerical findings and to establish a
direct link with the leading cluster, and indirectly with the
nodes with higher connectivity, we can apply our mean-field
approximation and study the linear stability of the stable
branch. In this case we expand Eq. (5) near the steady state
solution p∗

i
so that pi = p∗i + ui , and where ui is a small

perturbation. Expanding to linear order in ui gives the linear
system of equations

dui

dt
= −[1 + η (1 + ξqi)2]ui + 2ηξ (1 − p∗i )(1 + ξqi)vi,

(15)

where qi =
∑

j
Aijp

∗
j
, and where vi =

∑
j
Aijuj . Thus the

stability of the low activity state is dictated by the system of
equations u̇i =

∑
j
Qijuj , where

Qij = −[1 + η(1 + qi)2]δij + 2ηξ (1 − p∗i )(1 + ξqi) Aij .
(16)

The time evolution of the system is then given by the linear
combination

�u(t) =
∑

k

ake
�kt �ψk , (17)

where �k and �ψk are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
matrix Qij . Thus the quiescent state is unstable when the
maximum eigenvalue, which we denote here as �1, satisfies the
condition �1 � 0. To simplify the analysis further we note that
the steady state occupation probabilities are small so that p∗

i
∼

0, so that 1 − p∗
i

∼ 1. Finally, we will make the assumption
that the terms qi =

∑

Aijp

do not vary substantially from
site to site. Hence, we can replace qi → 〈q〉, where 〈q〉 =
(1/N )

∑
i
qi is the average over the network. This gives an

approximation

Qij ≈ −[1 + η(1 + ξ 〈q〉)2]δij + 2ηξ (1 + ξ 〈q〉)Aij . (18)
The leading eigenvalue can then be approximated by

�1 = −[1 + η(1 + ξ 〈q〉)2] + 2ηξ (1 + ξ 〈q〉)λ1, where λ1 is
the leading eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix.

Our linear stability analysis shows that the inactive branch
is unstable when �1 > 0, and that the growth rate of network
activity will be well approximated by the leading eigenvector
�φ1 of the adjacency matrix Aij . However, our numerical results
show that fluctuations to the active branch also occur in the case
�1 < 0. In this case, while the inactive state is stable, stochastic
fluctuations can induce the system to transition between the
inactive and active branches. Our key finding here, which was
pointed out in our previous study [16], is that these fluctuations
occur at the leading cluster. The reason for this is simply that
in the stable regime fluctuations are suppressed with a weight
factor ∝ exp(�1t). Therefore, it is precisely fluctuations at the
leading cluster which decay at the slowest rate and therefore
have the greatest likelihood of inducing a stochastic transition
between inactive and active states. In fact, a key finding of
Fig. 12 is that the correlation between the sites of nucleation
and the leading eigenvector increases monotonically as the
connectivity is decreased into the bistable regime. Thus while
transitions become rarer at low connectivity they also occur
with higher likelihood at the leading cluster of the network.

II. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have explored the dynamics of a network
where signaling between nodes is stochastic and nonlinear.
The important feature that we have identified is that, because
of the nonlinear interactions between connected nodes, the
network exhibits bistability. This bistability corresponds to
an inactive branch where most of the nodes are in the off
state, and an active branch where a fraction of the system
is active. Our analysis revealed that the onset of the active
branch is dictated by the cluster of nodes that correspond
to the leading eigenvector of the network adjacency matrix.

For the ER network we find that this result implies that the
network dynamics above and below the percolation transition
is dramatically different. Effectively, below the percolation
threshold the leading eigenvector is localized on a few network
sites, while above, it is spread throughout the network. Thus,
below the percolation threshold, the active branch emerges in
a continuous fashion, and network activity grows gradually
as a function of increasing excitability. On the other hand,
above the percolation transition there is a substantial gap
between the two branches and the onset of the active branch is

discontinuous. Consequently, stochastic transitions between
the two stable states of the network are extremely rare and
the steady state dynamics of the system is determined mostly
by initial conditions. Now, in the case of the BA network
we observe similar yet distinct behavior. In this case the
leading eigenvector is also localized although the size of
the leading cluster is substantially larger than in the case of
the ER network. Thus a finite gap between the active and
inactive branches can be observed at least for the system
sizes considered in this study. Furthermore, we found that
stochastic transitions between the active and inactive branch
were readily observable, with dwell times that increased
exponentially with the network connectivity. Indeed, these
stochastic fluctuations occur at nodes that can be identified
from the leading eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix.

In the context of biological signaling networks our results
have several important implications. The most important is
simply that the network connectivity plays a fundamental
role in the global behavior of the system. For example,
an ER network above the percolation transition essentially
behaves like a perfect switch with extremely rare transitions
between the active and inactive states. On the other hand,
below the percolation transition, the network response to
system parameters is continuous and graded. From a biological
perspective this result implies that the wiring architecture of
the signaling network dictates the system response, and that
this behavior should be robust to changes in the properties
of individual nodes. Now, in the case of the BA network
we find that the system can also exhibit switchlike behavior

between distinct macroscopic states. A crucial finding is that
both the onset and the nucleation dynamics of activation in
these networks are dictated by the leading cluster of the
network. In the biological context this implies that networks
with a BA architecture are particularly susceptible to stochastic
nucleation events centered at the leading cluster of the network.
In effect, the overall activity level of the network will be driven
by certain “key players” which have a higher than average
network connectivity. Thus in these systems it is crucial to
identify these key players in order to understand the function
of these networks.

The importance of eigenvector localization has also been
recognized in the context of disease spreading. In an insightful
paper Goltsev et al. [24] showed that above the epidemic
threshold diseases are either localized on a finite number of
nodes, or alternatively can spread across a finite fraction of
the population. Which case occurs depends on whether the
eigenvector of the network adjacency matrix is localized or
delocalized. These results are consistent with our analysis of
nonlinear signaling networks which show that the transition
between the inactive and active branches is dictated by the
structure of the leading eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix.
In our study we show further that the active branch above
threshold is also dictated by the spectral structure of the
network. Thus, far from the linear regime, the spectra of
the network identify the nodes which contribute to the active
branch. Here, we also mention that the structure of the leading
eigenvector will play a crucial role in understanding more
general networks, such as power law networks with more
general degree distributions. In this regard we refer to a
recent study [25] which investigates networks with degree
distribution of the form P (k) ∼ k−γ . This study found that
localization of the leading eigenvector occurs for γ > 5/2,
while for γ < 5/2 localization occurs on a mesoscopic
subgraph associated with the shell with the largest index in the
K-core decomposition. This finding implies that the dynamics
of these signaling networks will depend qualitatively on the
exponent of the degree distribution. In future studies it will be
necessary to explore how features of these signaling systems
depend on the details of the network architecture.

It is worth mentioning that the importance of graph
spectra on the dynamics of networks has been investigated in
numerous studies [17,21]. In particular, several authors have
studied the dynamics of bistable reaction-diffusion systems
on complex networks [26,27]. All of these studies reveal that
the graph spectra play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal
dynamics and the steady state patterns of these systems.
However, we think it is important to note that in these systems
it is the Laplacian rather than the adjacency matrix which
governs the network dynamics. This is because diffusive
processes on networks are described by the Laplacian matrix
which accounts for the flow of the diffusive species. In the
signaling network considered here a node can activate a
neighbor with no reduction in activity level, which is in contrast
to a diffusive process which must account for an outflow of
activity from that node. Thus it is the adjacency matrix which
becomes the relevant mathematical object describing signaling
networks of the type considered in this study.

In this study we have also investigated the nature of
spreading in these nonlinear networks. In particular, we

explored how a network that is initially inactive makes the
transition to the active branch. Our main finding here is
that at high connectivity spreading is initiated, with equal
likelihood, at any site in the network. This is because only
a few connected nodes need to fire simultaneously in order to
induce a large scale transition to the active phase. However,
as the connectivity is decreased, the network structure dictates
the sites of activation. In this case we find that activation is
a nucleation process on the network which tends to occur
at the leading cluster. This result is consistent with known
results on disease spreading on networks, where it is known
that the threshold for spreading is dictated by the leading
eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix [17,18]. However,
in the scenario considered here, the system is bistable so that
stochastic transitions can occur to the active phase even in the
case when the low activity branch is stable. In this case we
find that the leading cluster is even more predictive of the sites
of nucleation. This is because the leading cluster is precisely
that set of well connected nodes where random fluctuations
are suppressed by the least amount. Therefore, as the network
connectivity is reduced into the bistable regime, nucleation of
spreading activity becomes exponentially rarer but occurs with
increasing likelihood at the leading cluster.

Once nucleation of spreading occurs on the nonlinear
network a complex range of spatiotemporal processes can be
observed. In the ER network below the percolation transition
we find that noise activates clusters of communities which can
transition independently between the active and inactive states.
In the deterministic mean-field approximation the network
can exhibit multistability which is due to the dynamics of
effectively independent communities in the network. On the
other hand, above the percolation transition in the ER network,
and also in the BA network, only bistability is observed. In this
case, the network activation always evolves to the same steady
state pattern of activity independently of initial conditions.
This observation is likely explained by the work of Kouvaris
et al. [28] who analyzed bistable reaction-diffusion systems
on networks. In this work they showed that these nonlinear
systems exhibit the analog of traveling waves of activation in
which different parts of the network are sequentially activated.
These activation fronts ensure that different initial conditions
evolve towards the same steady state patterns. Moreover, under
certain conditions these activation fronts can be pinned so that
the steady state pattern can also exhibit multistability. In the
system considered here we expect these observations to apply.
In effect, in a BA network, or in an ER network above the
percolation transition, activation of sites should evolve via the
analog of propagating fronts. Indeed, our numerical findings
suggest that in these networks these activation fronts are not
pinned so that the system evolves to the same steady state
pattern of activity independently of initial conditions. This
observation likely explains why in these networks bistability
is robust and multistability is not observed.

In this study we have considered the dynamics of nonlinear
signaling networks characterized by the exponent γ = 2. Here,
we discuss in more detail how this exponent affects the system
dynamics. In Fig. 13 we show the steady state distribution p∞
for exponents γ = 1, 2, and 4, for the BA network considered
in Fig. 4(f). For γ = 1 the system is monostable and evolves
to a well defined activity level for a given coupling strength

s [Fig. 13(a)]. In this case the steady state activity level
rises continuously with increasing s. This result is in stark
contrast to the case of γ = 2 and 4 [Figs. 13(b) and 13(c)],
in which the system is bistable and can make stochastic
transitions between the active and inactive states. Here, we
find that in the case γ = 4 the transition times between the
stable states are substantially larger than in the case γ = 2.
This result is expected since the higher nonlinearity increases
the potential barrier that needs to be surmounted in order
to transition between stable states. Thus as γ is increased
the bistability of the system is more evident [Fig. 13(c)].
Furthermore, we find that at the critical coupling s = sa , the
active sites on the stable branch are determined by the leading
eigenvector of the network adjacency matrix. Indeed, we have
checked that the leading eigenvector and the distribution of
active sites just above threshold are highly correlated with a
correlation coefficient that is largely independent of γ . Here,
the key requirement for this high correlation is the underlying
bistability of the system which allows the leading community
to remain active just above onset. Therefore, all details of the
onset of the active branch, such as the gap 
, are independent
of the exponent γ . Thus the transition to the active state is
dictated by the network structure and is largely independent of
the degree of nonlinearity.

It will be interesting to explore if our findings can be applied
to other spreading processes. For example, to infectious
disease or virus spreading on networks, or to the spread of

signals in neuronal activity in in vitro cultures [29]. Here,
the key requirement is that the activation of nodes must be a
cooperative process that is a nonlinear function of neighboring
states. We point out that in biological signaling networks this
requirement is natural since proteins are typically regulated by
multiple binding sites. On the other hand, in disease or virus
spreading it is generally believed that infection is linearly
related to the number of infected sites. However, there may
be contagious processes which have a nonlinear dependence
on infected nodes. A scenario where the response of a node
is probably nonlinear is the study of rumor spreading in a
population. In fact, it is well known that an individual’s belief
is strongly dependent on the number of different sources who
repeat that belief as truth. This phenomenon, which is known
as the “illusion of truth” [14], will likely introduce a degree of
nonlinearity in the interaction between members of a popula-
tion. In this case, our main results such as bistability, stochastic

and should explain the main features of the spreading process.
