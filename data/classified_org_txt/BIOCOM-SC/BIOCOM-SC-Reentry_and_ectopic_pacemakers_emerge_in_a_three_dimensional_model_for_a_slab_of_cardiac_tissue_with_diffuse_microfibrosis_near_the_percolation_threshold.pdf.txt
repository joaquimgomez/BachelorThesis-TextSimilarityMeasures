Abstract

Arrhythmias in cardiac tissue are generally associated with irregular electrical wave propa-

gation in the heart. Cardiac tissue is formed by a discrete cell network, which is often hetero-

geneous. Recently, it was shown in simulations of two-dimensional (2D) discrete models of

cardiac tissue that a wave crossing a fibrotic, heterogeneous region may produce reentry

and transient or persistent ectopic activity provided the fraction of conducting connections is

just above the percolation threshold. Here, we investigate the occurrence of these phenom-

ena in three-dimensions by simulations of a discrete model representing a thin slab of car-

diac tissue. This is motivated (i) by the necessity to study the relevance and properties of the

percolation-related mechanism for the emergence of microreentries in three dimensions

and (ii) by the fact that atrial tissue is quite thin in comparison with ventricular tissue. Here,

we simplify the model by neglecting details of tissue anatomy, e. g. geometries of atria or

ventricles and the anisotropy in the conductivity. Hence, our modeling study is confined to

the investigation of the effect of the tissue thickness as well as to the comparison of the

dynamics of electrical excitation in a 2D layer with the one in a 3D slab. Our results indicate

a strong and non-trivial effect of the thickness even for thin tissue slabs on the probability of

microreentries and ectopic beat generation. The strong correlation of the occurrence of

microreentry with the percolation threshold reported earlier in 2D layers persists in 3D slabs.

Finally, a qualitative agreement of 3D simulated electrograms in the fibrotic region with the

experimentally observed complex fractional atrial electrograms (CFAE) as well as strong dif-

ference between simulated electrograms in 2D and 3D were found for the cases where

reentry and ectopic activity were triggered by the micro-fibrotic region.

Introduction

The synchronous contraction of the heart is a consequence of the highly organized propaga-

tion of the membrane action potential through the whole cardiac tissue. Several cardiac

arrhythmias correspond to conditions where this synchronization fails and cardiac contraction

is compromised. One of the most relevant arrhythmias is fibrillation which corresponds to a

state where the contraction of many cardiac myocytes are strongly desynchronized in the atria,

i.e. atria fibrillation, or, with more dangerous consequences, in the ventricles, i.e. ventricular

fibrillation. Reentry is a circulating action potential wave, and believed to be a necessary but

not a sufficient condition for fibrillation. Fibrillation is often attributed to a succession of mul-

tiple breakups and pairwise annihilations of spiral waves.

Spiral generation and spiral breakup [1–4] have been extensively studied by computational

modeling, for reviews see [5, 6]. The generation of a spiral wave may result from the impact of

an ectopic beat: an additional, premature stimulus (S2) which generates a second wave that

interacts with the sinus wave (S1) giving rise to a spiral wave [5]. A second common mecha-

nism for spiral wave generation is cardiac alternans, the alternation of short and large pulses in

response to a high frequency pacing [6, 7].

Even though atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of sustained cardiac arrhyth-

mia [8], the mechanisms that trigger it are still poorly understood. One hypothesis supported

by clinical studies [9] and animal experiments [10] is that AF can be initiated by one or more

regions that generate ectopic beats. For example, six consecutive ectopic beats separated by

130 ms may induce atrial fibrillation [11]. Structural heterogeneities may also produce persis-

tent atrial fibrillation [12].

In this work, we study how an heterogeneous region with the presence of both full-con-

nected and non-conducting (fibrosis) areas can generate microreentry in 3D computational

models of cardiac tissue. This type of fibrosis is known as microfibrosis due to the microscopic

scale of the heterogeneities [13–15].

In 2007, Spach et al. [16] could reproduce their original experiments [17] using a 2D in-sil-
icomodel that also accounted for fibrosis. A single cycle of microreentry was generated after
using a standard S1–S2 protocol. They concluded that fibrosis increases the vulnerability to

fast pacing. Similar results using multiple stimulus protocols were obtained by different groups

[16, 18–22] and confirmed that fibrosis or other micro-structural heterogeneities may facilitate

the initiation of reentries and help to sustain reentry or fibrillation. The use of the words facili-

tate and help appears naturally, since it is well known that S1–S2 or fast-pacing protocols can

per se generate reentries. Therefore, there exists a complicated interaction among the different
waves (S1–S2) and the heterogeneity of the tissue (fibrosis).

However, it was only recently shown [23, 24] that we can generate microreentries and

ectopic pacemakers in 2D computer simulations of cardiac electrophysiology without the use

of a second premature stimulus (S2) [16] or fast pacing [18]. If only a single stimulus is used,

the usual interactions between subsequent waves are not present; and therefore, one can relate

the genesis of the microrentries inside the fibrosis to the specific heterogeneity of the tissue, i.e.

to its micro-structure rather than to functional features (like wave interactions).

The fibrosis forms a maze where waves fractionate and follow zig-zag pathways. Therefore,

the topology of the maze is crucial for the emergence of a reentry inside the fibrotic region [23,

24]. This wave activity may continuously or transiently generate ectopic beats when it crosses

the border of the microfibrosis region [18] into the healthy tissue areas. Such zig-zag dynamics

was previously observed in experimental studies [25].

A straightforward approach to the modeling of microfibrosis is the use of simple 2D dis-

crete and isotropic models of cardiac tissue, wherein a prescribed percentage of connections

between neighboring myocytes is randomly removed [23, 26]. The probability of microreentry

depends on the degree of fibrosis specified by the fraction ϕ of non-conducting links between
neighboring cells in the tissue. By analyzing the probability distribution of tissues with reentry

as a function of ϕ, it was found [23] that the maximum of this distribution was close to the per-
colation threshold ϕc [27, 28] of the conducting links in the associated discrete network. The
value of ϕc provides a reference parameter that depends only on the topology, and, therefore,
on the spatial dimension of the lattice used in the simulation. A similar relation was verified

later using two-dimensional microscopic anisotropic models of the tissue together with more

detailed physiological descriptions [24]. These results indicate that the degree of fibrosis as

well as the topology of connections between myocytes are important factors when evaluating

the pro-arrhythmic behavior of a particular region of the heart.

In recent years, related studies were carried out by Christensen et al. [29] for an anisotropic

tissue model, by Kazbanov et al. [30] for tissues with spatially varying degrees of microfibrosis

and by Vigmond et al. [19] for the modeling of complex fractionated atrial electrograms

(CFAE) and reentry in a fibrosis model based on imaging data.

Propagation near fibrotic area has been associated with CFAE, in both animal [31] and clin-

ical studies [32]. These findings have remarkably changed the management and prognostics of

patients with atrial fibrillation via a new procedure of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation that

is guided by CFAE mapping [33]. Recent clinical studies of guided CFAE ablation revisited the

benefits and risks of this procedure and clearly suggest that further investigation on this topic

is required [34–36]. Different computer simulations have also already given valuable insights

into how the microstructure of cardiac tissue, specifically microfibrosis, and CFAE are related

[13, 15].

Here, we extend our studies with 2D simulations presented before in [23, 24] to 3D simula-

tions of thin cardiac tissue represented by a discrete model composed of up to twenty, two-

dimensional layers arranged in a cubic lattice with an embedded region of microfibrosis that

will be shown: i) to reproduce microreentry inside the microfibrosis tissue, ii) to form an

ectopic pacemaker and iii) to reproduce qualitatively the signature of CFAE.

In addition, the simulations permit to quantify the influence in the activity of the ectopic

pacemaker of important physiological parameters such as electrical remodeling, the fraction of

fibrosis (i. e. the fraction of broken links), the size of the micro-fibrotic region and the tissue

thickness.

Many simulations of the atria are based on the monolayer hypothesis [11, 37], however, tis-

sue thickness of the atria is known to vary between 0.5 and 3mm [38]. In addition, some recent
studies have suggested the possibility of transmural reentries in the atria [39], a phenomenon

that could only be captured with a 3D model. Here, we investigate how the number of layers in

the third dimension influences the occurrence of microreentries in a fibrotic region of the atria.

Electrophysiological properties such as APD and conduction velocity (CV) vary substan-

tially within the heart. In addition, different pathologies, such as atrial fibrillation, ischemia or

a substantial increase of myocyte to fibroblast coupling, may significantly decrease the values

of both APD and CV [11, 40–43]. To assess how different electrophysiological features influ-

ences the probability to generate microreentries in a fibrotic region we test three levels of

electrophysiological remodeling: normal remodeling (APD = 135ms, CV = 44 cm/s); interme-

diate remodeling (APD = 120ms, CV = 39 cm/s), and strong remodeling (APD = 76ms,

CV = 34 cm/s).

Finally, the degree, type and pattern of fibrosis varies considerably for different kinds of dis-

eases or during different stages of one particular pathology [44]. Therefore, we have investi-

gated how the percentage of fibrosis, ϕ, and the size of a fibrotic region influence the
probability to generate microreentries and create ectopic pacemakers in cardiac tissue.

Materials and Methods

Continuous model of cardiac tissue

The propagation of the action potential is described by the cable equation [45]. The equation

relates the variation of the membrane potential (V) with the total ion current through the ion
channels across the membrane (I), and the conduction of potential along the cell membrane.
The cable equation reads:

@V
@t

¼ � I þ ~r � ðD~rVÞ; ð1Þ

where D = 1 cm2/s is the effective diffusion coefficient of the action potential [6]. The above
equation is solved in its discrete form, as will be explained in the next sections. Moreover,

homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are used. We do not consider anisotropy or any

detailed geometry and anatomy of the tissue to avoid extensive calculations. This amounts to a

qualitative description of the tissue which nevertheless captures the main properties of the

dynamics as will be demonstrated below.

The total current I is the sum of different types of ion currents I = ∑i Ii. The number and
form of these currents is determined by the specific ionic model employed [46]. Here, we use a

simplified and generic cardiac model, which consists of only three ion currents [4, 47]:

@V
@t

¼ � ðIfi þ Iso þ IsiÞ þ ~r � ðD~rVÞ; ð2Þ

where the currents do not exactly correspond to an explicit ion channel, but are controlled by

parameters which can be fitted to particular experimental measurements or to more detailed

models. The ionic currents read:

corresponding, to the fast inward (Ifi), slow outward (Iso) and slow inward (Isi) currents. These
currents are controlled by the gating variables v and w. The evolution of such gate variables
depends on the membrane potential:

v2 with p = θ(V − Vc) and q = θ(V − Vv), where θ(x) is the Heav-

iside step function. We have used the same parameter values as described before in [23]. One

of the main advantages of using this simplified and generic cardiac cell model is the ability to

test different scenarios in terms of electrophysiological remodeling via the modification of a

single parameter of the model, τd.
We employ finite differences for the spatial discretization (Δx = 100 μm) and a second

order Runge-Kutta method for the temporal integration of the equations (Δt = 0.0165ms) for
the numerical integration of Eqs (2–4).

Excitability and level of remodeling

Electrophysiological properties such as APD and CV vary substantially within the heart. In

addition, under different pathologies, such as atria fibrillation, ischemia or a substantial

increase of myocyte to fibroblast coupling, both APD and CV values can be significantly

decreased. For instance, whereas APD values can be as short as 140 ms in healthy atria, it is

reduced to 56 ms under chronic atrial fibrillation [11, 40, 41]. Likewise, CV values may be as

slow as 44 cm/s within normal atrial, whereas under chronic atrial fibrillation CV can be even

slower, with reported values at 37 cm/s [11, 40–43].

Numerical simulation of electrical remodeling has been used in many studies of atria fibril-

lation. Action potential duration and conduction velocities decreased under remodeling to:

APD = 100ms and CV = 66 cm/s in [48], APD = 144ms and CV = 54 cm/s [38], and APD = 75
ms and CV = 61 cm/s [11]. AP remodeling can be due to completely different reasons, and the
level of remodeling depends not only on the type of pathology but also on its stage.

In this work, we use a simplified approach to assess how different electrophysiological fea-

tures influence the probability to generate microreentries in a fibrotic region. Despite the mul-

titude of possibilities in terms of APD and CV values reported, we simulate only three levels of

electrophysiological remodeling: normal remodeling (APD = 135ms, CV = 44 cm/s); interme-

diate remodeling (APD = 120ms, CV = 39 cm/s), and strong remodeling (APD = 76ms,

CV = 34 cm/s).

These three cases of remodeling were simulated by using different values of the parameter

τd of the Fenton-Karma model [47]: 0.25 ms, 0.30 ms and 0.35 ms. The action potential dura-
tion (APD) and the conduction velocity (CV) of our simplified cell model decrease with the

parameter τd, and consequently, the wave length (WL) given by the product of these two quan-
tities (WL = CV � APD) also decreases. Thus, waves are smaller and slower for larger values of
τd, implying that the excitability decreases with this parameter. Therefore we make the qualita-
tive relation between decreased excitability and electrical remodeling, i.e. higher values of τd
corresponds to higher level of remodeling, as presented in Fig 1.

Discrete heterogeneous cardiac model

Randomly distributed inactive gap junctions, inert tissue cells among the cardiac muscle cells

or the presence of unexcitable cells, e.g. fibroblast, in the tissue break the homogeneous propa-

gation of action potential through the cardiac tissue. The resulting waves are expected to be

corrugated and noisy. We model this disruption in the propagation by the introduction of ran-

dom heterogeneities in the network of cells using the connectivity parameter ηij:

@Vi
@t

¼ � ðIfi þ Iso þ IsiÞ þ x
XN

j

ZijðVj � ViÞ; ð5Þ

where ξ = D/ℓ2 with ℓ = 100 μm. If the connectivity parameter ηij = 1 for all i and j we recover
the homogeneous discrete network limit of Eq (2). The connection between two cells (i and j)
is removed (ηij = 0) with a certain probability ϕ. These abnormal connections are randomly
scattered in the tissue. Our approach is a simple and qualitative model of reactive interstitial

fibrosis [49].

Definition and calculation of the percolation threshold

The increase of the fraction of non-conducting links leads to isolated regions confined by

removed links. Below a particular fraction of ϕc the network exhibits a percolation of conduct-
ing links [50]. Wave propagation is not possible for fractions above this percolation threshold.

For ϕ just below the value of ϕc, the effective medium approach [51] that enables modelers to
replace heterogeneous discrete models by homogeneous continuum models breaks down and

a single excitation wave may break into pieces and produce reentries and persistent irregular

activity [23].

The percolation threshold depends on several factors including the spatial dimension of the

system. The value of the fraction ϕ that produces conduction block in a particular two-dimen-
sional lattice may permit propagation in a different lattice with higher connectivity or in the

corresponding 3D medium. Therefore, it is not clear that previous results in 2D can be extrap-

olated to 3D. Here, we want to evaluate this transition from 2D to 3D systems by using a dis-

crete model of up to 20 layer thickness defined on a cubic lattice. The layers of this model

correspond to the square lattices employed in early studies in 2D [23].

We systematically increase the number of layers (N) in a three-dimensional model starting

from a monolayer, i.e. the two-dimensional system, assuming a layer thickness of 100 μm.
Altogether, we vary from N = 1 (monolayer, 2D) to N = 20 layers (3D tissue with a thickness of
2 mm). For these parameters the percolation threshold can be easily calculated from one hun-

dred randomly generated networks for different values of ϕ [23]. The change of the percolation
threshold is plotted in Fig 2.

Simulation protocol

We consider that a small cylindrical region in the center of our simulation domain represents

the fibrotic region and it is strongly heterogeneous. Inside this fibrotic region, a fraction ϕ of

connections are non-conducting (ηij = 0). Outside this fibrotic region all the connections
between neighboring myocytes are normal and homogeneous (ηij = 1). In addition, we model
electrical remodeling varying the excitability of the fibrotic region, we set τd to tod, where t

be 0.25ms, 0.30ms or 0.35ms.
We evaluate the interaction between the wave propagating in an homogeneous region of

the tissue with the fibrotic region with a fraction ϕ of non-conducting links. A single excitation
wave of action potential is initially induced in a corner of the three-dimensional slab. The

action potential propagates through the medium till it interacts with the fibrotic region.

where each layer corresponds to 0.01 cm.

Depending on the values of ϕ and ϕc (percolation threshold for the slab used in simulation, see
Fig 2) three behaviors are observed: For low fraction (ϕ� ϕc) the wave propagates inside the
fibrotic region and deforms, and although propagation inside is slower than outside, wave

propagation is stable. For large fraction (ϕ� ϕc) the wave does not enter into the fibrotic
region and propagates only around this region. For intermediate fraction (ϕ* ϕc) the wave
propagates in the fibrotic region, however the propagation inside is highly irregular. We evalu-

ate the different dynamics by simulating the activity during 1500ms. The resulting numerical
simulations are discussed in the next section.

Fibrotic border effects

We incorporate a fibrotic border (FB) that surrounds the region with microfibrosis. This bor-

der region models a smooth transition between non-fibrotic and fibrotic tissue in comparison

with a stiff transition employed in our previous models [23, 24].

First, we compare the two different borders: 1) a localized fibrosis without FB, as presented

in Fig 3(A). Here, a circular region of microfibrosis is immediately surrounded by homoge-

neous tissue; 2) fibrosis with a fibrotic border where the circular region of microfibrosis is

immediately surrounded by a second zone where the probability of microfibrosis decreases

with the radius to zero. Outside of these two regions there is no microfibrosis, see Fig 3(C).

We run one hundred of simulations for different values of ϕ, see Fig 3, and calculate the
probability of the different types of reentries observed in each set of simulations. We have also

classified the observed reentries as activity or reentry [52], see sketches in Fig 3. The label activ-
ity describes the simulations that have resulted in sustained reentry but are confined to the
region with microfibrosis. The label reentry characterizes the simulations where we observed
ectopic beats leaving the microfibrosis and inducing sustained reentry all over the tissue, see a

sketch in Fig 3. Simulations were monitored for 1500ms and were classified as: (i) no reentry,
(ii) non-sustained reentries, (iii) confined, sustained activity or (iv) global, sustained labeled
reentry.

The total number of reentries in both cases are similar, compare Fig 3(B) and 3(D). How-

ever, the type of activity, confined activity vs. global reentry, varies systematically. The inclu-
sion of a border region facilitated the transformation of confined activity to sustained, global

reentry affecting also the homogeneous surrounding tissue. Therefore, we include the gradual

fibrotic border in the next simulations.

Calculation of electrocardiograms

One way to indirectly assess the degree of fibrosis in cardiac tissue is the analysis of the wave-

form of electrograms measured by catheters tips located near cardiac tissue during a clinical

electrophysiology study. Propagation near fibrosis is associated with fractionated electrograms

[31, 32]. Two-dimensional computer simulations have already given valuable insights about

the relation between microfibrosis and complex fractionated electrograms [13, 15, 19].

Here, we continue these studies by also simulating electrograms (EG) measured by elec-

trodes near the 3D tissue surface (0.1 mm from the surface). The extracellular potential is com-

puted using the large volume conductor approximation [15]. To this end, we integrate all the

currents in the tissue with respect to the position of the electrode:

EG ¼ A

d~x; ð6Þ

where j~r0 j is the distance from the electrode to the particular point of the tissue and A is a

ent methods of calculations of EG see [53].

Results

The interaction of a wave with the fibrotic region was studied in two-dimensional models [23].

A remaining activity was observed inside the fibrotic area. Under certain conditions, this activ-

ity confined to the microfibrosis region may leave and re-excite the rest of the tissue, giving

rise to the generation of ectopic beats. Here, we extend those results to 3D.

Reentry in a three-dimensional slab of tissue

In Fig 4 we show a typical example of a simulation leading to reentry due to localized fibrosis

in 3D. The corresponding movie is provided as supplementary material (S1 Movie). First, the

wave of action potential propagates around the circular region, see Fig 4(A) and 4(B). How-

ever, the action potential slowly enters into the fibrotic region, where it breaks down into

pieces, see Fig 4(C)–4(E). One of these pieces arrives to the border where it induces the forma-

tion of a new reentrant wave, see Fig 4(F)–4(G). The action potential inside the fibrotic region

induces new waves into the homogeneous tissue. Therefore, via the mechanism of microreen-

try inside a region with microfibrosis a localized ectopic pacemaker is generated.

In order to understand the process of reentry in more detail we plot in Fig 5 the maps of

activation times. The time of the first activation of each cell is plotted in Fig 5(A) and 5(B).

While the wave takes around 200ms to arrive to the opposite corner of the system, it takes
more than 400ms to reach the center of the fibrotic area. Even more interesting is the time of
the second activation of each cell, which only occurs in the case of a reentry. We observe in Fig

5(C) and 5(D) that the second activation occurs first near the border of the fibrotic region at

300ms and it produces a propagating wave even before the center of the fibrotic region is
excited for the first time at 450ms (Fig 5(A) and 5(B)).

The probability of reentry depends on the thickness

Two-dimensional studies with the same model [23] predicted the appearance of reentry for a

intermediate value of τd inside the fibrotic region (tod). They are summarized in the first row in
Fig 6. For larger values of tod waves propagate too slow to enter into the fibrotic region (results

not shown). While reentry probability arrives to 40% in two-dimensional systems with strong

remodeling, only very small probability is found for tod ¼ 0:30 and no reentry is found for

tod ¼ 0:25.

If we add two layers to the single layer employed for the two-dimensional simulations

(N = 3), two important changes are observed, see second row in Fig 6. First, for strong remod-

eling, the whole distribution of reentries shifts, to higher values of ϕ, in agreement with the
dependence of the percolation threshold on the thickness, see Fig 2. Second, we observe an

increase of the reentry probability for intermediate and large values of tod.

Next, we consider a three-dimensional slab with five layers (N = 5), see third row in Fig 6.

The results for five layers confirms the shift to larger values of ϕ due to the change of the perco-
lation threshold, and the further increase of the probability of reentry for intermediate values

of tod. In particular, for intermediate remodeling and ϕ = 0.7 the probability of reentry is as
high as 90%. We highlight also that 5 layers correspond to 0.5 mm of thickness and that thick-

ness is already observed in some regions of the normal atria.

The probability of reentry for tod ¼ 0:35ms, is much smaller when 10 layers are employed
(N = 10). On the other hand, a sizable non-zero probability for reentry for tod ¼ 0:30ms, exists
only in a narrow window of fractions of ϕ. And, more important, activity is observed already
under normal remodeling with 6% of probability around the percolation threshold value.

Finally, for thick slabs of tissue (N = 20), no reentry is found for strong remodeling in compar-

ison with the high probability in two dimensional system. For intermediate remodeling the

results are similar to those obtained with half of the layers. For normal remodeling there is a

8% of probability of activity again around the percolation threshold value. The increase of the

thickness therefore shifts the optimal value of tod for reentry to occur to values that corresponds

to intermediate remodeling, whereas in the pure 2D case, the probability was largest for strong

remodeling (tod ¼ 0:35ms). Altogether, the strongest occurrence of reentry does not occur for
normal or strong but for intermediate remodeling. This is presumably because for normal con-

ditions the excitation waves are more robust against perturbation by the heterogeneous distri-

bution of available conducting links. In parallel, the tendency for rotor formation weakens as

remodeling gets more pronounced.

The probability of reentry depends on the size of the fibrotic region

To study the influence of the size of the heterogeneous region, we consider a set of parameter

values with high probability of reentries: tod ¼ 0:30ms and N = 10, see Fig 6. In Fig 7 we show
the results of these simulations, where we change the radius of the fibrotic region from 0.4 cm
to 1.4 cm. The higher the size of the region is, the more likely the reentries are.

With these results we can also estimate the minimum size for a fibrotic region in a 1mm
thick three-dimensional system to generate reentries: this is around 1 cm of diameter, which is
in the same order than the fibrotic spatial patterns derived from patients [54]. This value is

smaller than for a pure two-dimensional system where it is around 1.5 cm of diameter [52].

Simulation of fractionated electrograms in 3D

We consider again the 3D numerical simulation shown in Fig 4, where we choose 7 observa-

tion sites (electrodes), see Fig 8. The first panels of this figure correspond to four snapshots of
the action potential propagation (view from the top of the surface of the 3D simulation), where

the location of the electrodes are also shown.

During the simulation the EG measured by the different electrodes outside the fibrotic area

are basically the same, see Fig 8(a), 8(b), 8(f) and 8(g), and equivalent to a EG measured in an

homogeneous system. However, the EG measured by the three electrodes above the fibrotic

region are different, see Fig 8. Inside this region the wave propagates slowly and it arrives to

the middle with a large delay and pieces of waves arrive simultaneously from the border. The

signals of the electrodes inside the fibrotic area are weaker, and look irregular and fractionated,

see Fig 8(c)–8(e). Note that the amplitude of the EG inside the fibrotic region is weaker and

the scale is one order of magnitude smaller. Actually the amplitude of the EG decreases linearly

with the fraction ϕ due to the systematic loss of active tissue for the integral defined in Eq (6).
Two numerically calculated EG in 2D and 3D are compared in Fig 9. They correspond to

conditions where microfibrosis induces reentries. The EG measured in the homogeneous part

of the tissue is basically the same in 3D and in 2D, apart from an increase in the amplitude of

the EG due to the larger number of cells in 3D, see Fig 9(A) and 9(B). However the EG in the

fibrotic region looks different, see Fig 9(C) and 9(D). In the 2D case the EG is already fraction-

ated but the waveform still resembles somewhat that one of the homogeneous EG. The 3D EG

measured inside the microfibrosis is much more random and very different from the homoge-

neous EG, probably due to an averaging effect of uncorrelated signals from different layers of

the simulation. This result shows that 3D effects on the measured EGs are not negligible and

should be taken into account in future studies when comparing EG in more detailed and real-

istic physiological models with experimentally measured CFAEs.

Discussion

Percolation threshold and occurrence of microreentry in microfibrosis

Our previous simulations in 2D discrete and isotropic models of cardiac tissue with simple lat-

tice topologies (square, hexagonal) exhibited microreentry inside a fibrotic region [23]. Equiv-

alent results were obtained with two-dimensional models with sub-cellular resolution that

took into account the anisotropy of the tissue and the gap junction distribution together with a

much more complete physiological description [24]. In both studies, the probability of micro-

reentry depended on the fraction of fibrosis, ϕ, and it was shown to be most prevalent just
above the percolation threshold ϕc where conduction is lost. Since the percolation threshold
depends only on the lattice topology, details of the electrophysiological should not matter

much for the identification of the ϕ-values for which reentry is most likely.
In this paper, 3D simulations of homogeneous tissues with an embedded region of microfi-

brosis confirmed again that the probability to generate reentry from a microfibrotic region is

higher just above the percolation threshold for conducting links in the discrete network. Reen-

try is likely to appear for percentages of non-conducting links between 50% and 70%. Note

that myocyte connectivity decreases to a value of 65% in high-resolution 3D reconstruction of

an infarct border zone [21]. We show a straightforward relation between the size of the fibrotic

region and the probability of reentry: reentries are more likely to occur inside larger-sizes of

fibrotic regions. The same relation was observed before in 2D simulations [23]. One possible

explanation for this observation is that the increase of the size of the microfibrosis region leads

to an increase of the length of a possible reentry circuit that is formed via a zig-zag propagation

in the maze. Moreover, the 3D results reported here show that there are non-trivial and non-

intuitive relations between the probability of reentries, the excitability of the tissue (APD and

CV) and the thickness of the tissue.

The probability of reentry depends on the remodeling of the tissue and we observe a non-

monotonic behavior: probability of reentry first increases when we move from parameter val-

ues near propagation boundary (strong remodeling) to weakly excitable tissues (intermediate

remodeling); then, the probability of reentry decreases when we further move from weakly

excitable to normal remodeling. Non-trivial relations are also observed varying the tissue

thickness. For strong remodeling, probability of reentry first increases as we increase the thick-

ness of the tissue from a monolayer to 0.3mm, but decreases as we further enlarge the thick-
ness from 0.5mm to 2mm.

Source-sink mismatches produces unidirectional propagation block [55] and have an

important role in the generation of the zigzag reentry [18]. The probability of source-sink mis-

match increases with size and thickness. Therefore, by further increasing the thickness of the

system, the source-sink mismatches are too strong and instead of generating unidirectional

blocks, generate full propagation block. The fine balance between having enough driving force

for wave propagation, INa, and enough source-sink mismatches to generate reentry zigzag cir-
cuits explains the trends observed in the results presented in Fig 6. A similar balance or trade-

off between tissue structure and INa amplitude was also used earlier to explain slow conduction
velocities observed in experiments [56–58].

The role of fibrosis: triggering vs. perpetuating arrhythmic activity

There are several attempts to model the interaction of waves within regions of heterogeneous

cardiac tissue, where cells are partially disconnected [59–61]. Their main results are a decrease

of the macroscopic conduction velocity [51, 62] and a decrease of excitability which may pre-

clude spiral breakup [26]. Related results are the observations that propagating waves perform

a zigzag motion associated with the presence of non-excitable tissue [63], scars [64], propaga-

tion inside vein tissue [20] or microfibrosis [13].

However, it is worth noting that the above mentioned studies consider the role of fibrosis

in the maintenance or perpetuation of arrhythmia, e. g. atrial fibrillation. To achieve this goal,

the arrhythmia is always induced by premature stimulation (S1–S2 protocol) or fast pacing in

the simulations. In this work, our focus is on the role of fibrosis as a trigger for arrhythmia.

Our simulations present how a region with microfibrosis can sustain microreentry and

become an ectopic pacemaker. For instance, Fig 8 shows that after a single stimulus the 3D tis-

sue is rhythmically paced by the region of microfibrosis, with a cycle length around 200ms.
Future work may compare the outcome of different simulation protocols for a given heteroge-

neous setup that models regions of fibrosis inside a healthy tissue. We expect that reentry

occurs earlier in the S1–S2 and fast pacing protocols than in our single-stimulus approach.

Nevertheless, the parameter regions where reentry is found to be most likely to occur in our

study here should also be the ones where propagation of multiple excitation waves is most vul-

nerable to the emergence of reentries. This is the first 3D simulations that support the hypothe-

sis that ectopic pacemakers can be explained by the mechanism of microreentry inside a

region of fibrosis. Recently, the role of fibrosis and other tissue heterogeneities in the genera-

tion of ectopic foci was also studied using different mechanisms of arrhythmia, such as trigger

activity [65] and abnormal automaticity [66].

We systematically change the thickness of our 3D model. Fig 6 shows that the results are

qualitatively comparable when using the monolayer or a 0.3mm thick tissue. However, both
the qualitative and quantitative results obtained with 0.5mm to 2mm-thick tissues are sub-
stantially different from the results obtained with a monolayer model indicating a crossover

from genuine 2D to 3D behavior. This finding is in accordance with recent experimental and

simulation-based evidence of the impact of endo-epicardial electrical dissociation during atria

fibrillation [67]. During atrial fibrillation, the electrical activity of endocadial and epicardial

surfaces is found to be progressively uncoupled, most likely due to interstitial fibrosis. In addi-

tion, the uncoupling is correlated with increasing stability and complexity of the atrial fibrilla-

tion substrate. Therefore, one may conclude that atrial fibrillation progressively becomes a

three-dimensional process.

Fractionated and asymmetric electrograms

Under normal conditions, surface EG show first a positive deflection, when the AP wave is

arriving, followed by a negative deflection, indicating the wave is moving away. The ampli-

tudes of these reflections are similar or symmetric. Such typical waveforms are observed, for

instance, in our results presented in Fig 8. However, previous computational studies have

already characterized how changes in electrogram waveform are associated with complex and

fractionated propagation in the presence of fibrosis, arrhythmia, and complex 3D geometry

and anisotropy [11, 13, 15, 18]. For instance, in Fig 8(f) and 8(g), the waveforms are asymmet-

ric, with a positive deflection bigger than the following negative one. This indicates the colli-

sion of the two propagating waves, as described before in [68]. The two waves have to

propagate around the fibrotic region before they collide. A negative monophasic electrogram,

as in the electrode E of Fig 8(e), is usually associated with an AP focus [11, 18], since this

would reflect that most of the waves propagate away for the electrode position.

Fractionated electrograms are carefully studied and related to fractionated propagation in

microfibrosis in [13, 15, 18]. In our simulations we observe fractionated and complex electro-

grams near the fibrotic region, as presented by the waveforms in Fig 8(c)–8(e).

Limitations, future works and conclusions

The ionic model used in the numerical simulations is simple and rather qualitative. In order to

have a direct control of the parameters related with ion channels and their possible pathologi-

cal or pharmacokinetic modifications, more elaborate and detailed ionic models should be

employed in future studies. However previous results in two dimensions with the same model

[23] were later found to be very much in line with the outcome of studies with a more realistic

and physiologically detailed model [24]. Therefore we are confident that the three-dimensional

results presented here should server as a good starting point and provide guidance for studies

in the near future involving more realistic models incorporating detailed electrophysiology

and anatomy as well as experimentally obtained characterization of fibrosis.

The geometry employed here, a three-dimensional thin slab of tissue, is relatively simple

and we have already ongoing works that consider anisotropy and more accurate geometric

descriptions. The number of neighboring cells in the cubic lattice employed here is six while a

more realistic organization of the cells is probably closer to a three-dimensional close-packed

hexagonal organization in which each cell has twelve nearest neighbors. Since the percolation

threshold in such a lattice is substantially larger than the one in cubic lattice, reentries will also

occur at a much larger value of ϕ in the hexagonal lattice than in the cubic lattice.
The development of more elaborate descriptions of heterogeneous cardiac tissue including

specific information of this type is an actual research direction of several groups with a lot of

implications in cardiac modeling for the correct description of fibrotic regions in cardiac tis-

sue. For example, reactive interstitial fibrosis has been modeled by introducing non-conduc-

tive materials that disconnect a fraction ϕ of neighboring myocytes, however, fibroblast are
also frequently present in such regions which can be electrically coupled to myocytes and affect

their properties [43, 69–72].

In summary, we find that a confined region with microfibrosis may generate microreen-

tries. Such active regions may act as ectopic pacemakers for the surrounding tissue, exhibit the

electrogram signature of CFAEs and are intimately linked to the fraction of fibrosis, ϕ, and
topology of connections between myocytes. The essential parameter characterizing the topol-

ogy of the lattice of discrete nodes in the simulation (or the network of cells in experiments) is

the associated percolation threshold ϕc. The phenomena reported here: microreentry inside
fibrotic regions, macroreentry and ectopic pacemakers triggered from fibrotic areas and the

associated complex fraction electrograms all occur if the fraction of broken links representing

the degree of fibrosis is such that the network of the remaining conducting links is just above

the percolation threshold.
