Abstract. The beating of the heart is a synchronized contraction of muscle cells

(myocytes) that are triggered by a periodic sequence of electrical waves (action

potentials) originating in the sino-atrial node and propagating over the atria and

the ventricles. Cardiac arrhythmias like atrial and ventricular fibrillation (AF,VF)

or ventricular tachycardia (VT) are caused by disruptions and instabilities of these

electrical excitations, that lead to the emergence of rotating waves (VT) and turbulent

wave patterns (AF,VF). Numerous simulation and experimental studies during the

last 20 years have addressed these topics. In this review we focus on the nonlinear

dynamics of wave propagation in the heart with an emphasis on the theory of pulses,

spirals and scroll waves and their instabilities in excitable media and their application

to cardiac modeling. After an introduction into electrophysiological models for action

potential propagation, the modeling and analysis of spatiotemporal alternans, spiral

and scroll meandering, spiral breakup and scroll wave instabilities like negative line

tension and sproing are reviewed in depth and discussed with emphasis on their impact

in cardiac arrhythmias.

1. Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the developed world and

accounts for about a third of all deaths [1, 2]. CVD may occur due to problems in

the veins or arteries (arteriosclerosis) giving rise to heart attacks or strokes, in the

disruption of the proper contraction of the ventricles resulting in heart failure and

impaired blood supply. A loss of rhythm and synchronization of cardiac electrical

impulses orchestrating the pumping of blood is associated with a number of arrhythmias

(i.e., abnormal or irregular heart rhythm) including atrial (AF) and ventricular (VF)

fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VT) [3].

The main motivation for modeling in cardiology is nicely summarized in a

short introduction written by J. Jalife for a series of articles on recent advances in

computational cardiology in the leading journal Circulation research [4]: “Of all the

cardiac arrhythmias seen in clinical practice, atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular

tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) are among the leading causes of morbidity and

mortality in the developed world. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia and

is associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, dementia, and death. In

developed nations overall prevalence of AF is 0.9% and the number of people affected is

projected to more than double over the next 2 decades. VT/VF is the most important

immediate cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Incidence of SCD is estimated to be

4 to 5 million cases per year worldwide. Thus arrhythmias and SCD are among the

most significant manifestations ofcardiovascular diseases worldwide, but their underlying

mechanisms remain elusive.” Over the years, many researchers have developed, tested

and sometimes validated hypotheses regarding the nonlinear dynamics of sudden changes

in cardiac dynamics associated with arrhythmias. We will review crucial instabilities

and disruptions of the normal heartbeat like alternans, rotor dynamics and electrical

turbulence and the related theoretical approaches.

Nowadays, the incorporation of available experimental data - obtained from

electrophysiological studies of cardiac muscle cells, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings,

optical imaging of the voltage and calcium content in cardiac tissue, or magnetic

resonance imaging (MRI) of the anatomy and the mechanical motion of the heart

permits the developments of detailed and realistic models of the heart. The adequate

representation of the normal function of the heart and of various forms of CVD presents

big challenges for mathematical modeling and simulations. The heart acts as an

electromechanical pump, and its complete mathematical description would have to take

into account electric wave propagation, muscle contraction and blood fluid dynamics

making cardiac modeling a formidable multiphysics problem [5]. A second equally

formidable task is the integration of largely different spatial and temporal scales in

cardiac modeling. It is of great relevance to predict the impact of mutations as well

as the influence of pharmacological substances on the organ function of the heart in

simulation studies. Attempts in this direction require not only models at different levels

- from molecules and cells to tissue and organs - but also multiscale approaches that



CONTENTS 5

allow to estimate the impact of processes at small scales on the dynamics at larger

scales [6, 7]. Consequently, continuum models at tissue and organ level are typically

derived by mathematical homogenization procedures that average over a microscopic

scale [8]. A prominent example of this approach in cardiac modeling is the derivation of

the macroscopic spatially homogeneous, continuum bidomain equations for electrical

propagation from a homogenization procedure that averages over the discrete and

potentially heterogeneous microscopic cellular scale [9, 10]. Most studies that focus

on the electrical propagation and the related dynamic diseases like tachycardias and

fibrillation in the atria and ventricles employ the monodomain equations that can be

derived as an approximation of the bidomain model [11]. The monodomain equation

describes electrical wave propagation in the heart by coupled reaction-diffusion type

equations that are prototype models in nonlinear dynamics of spatially extended systems

[12]. The theory of nonlinear dynamics has introduced important concepts like the

distinction between periodic and chaotic dynamics as well as classification of bifurcations

that describe parameter-dependent qualitative changes in the dynamics in a unified

language [13]. Early on, it was realized, e.g., by Glass and Mackey, that physiological

rhythms such as the heartbeat offer a rich variety of nonlinear dynamical behavior and

the concept of dynamical diseases was introduced [14]. In an equally pioneering spirit,

Winfree pointed out the link between cardiac arrhythmias and generic dynamics of

excitable media [15].

The present review will focus mostly on electrical wave propagation in the heart.

It will thus not provide a complete mathematical framework for cardiac dynamics and

mostly neglect phenomena that involve mechanical aspects (e.g., the contraction and

motion of the heart) or fluid dynamics (e.g., with cardiac valves or arteries that involve

fluid dynamics). The aim of this review is twofold: on the one hand, we will discuss

phenomena familiar to cardiac modelers and cardiologists from the viewpoint of the

theory of nonlinear dynamics in excitable media; on the other hand, we would like to

provide a presentation of the basics of cardiac electrical wave propagation in a form that

is familiar to researchers working on nonlinear dynamics. This, we hope, will help to

overcome potential barriers of understanding, resulting from the different terminologies

used by physicians and biologists on the one side and computational and mathematical

modelers on the other side. Due to this broad scope, we have sacrificed a natural

historical prospective on the development of the different concepts to provide a more

tractable version. Our goal is to stimulate thereby the communication of the rapidly

growing community of cardiac modelers with scientists from the areas of nonlinear

physics and applied mathematics. These disciplines have developed suitable tools of

theoretical and numerical analysis that may support the impressive efforts in modeling

and simulation of the heart. In particular, we will put our focus on the understanding

of arrhythmias and fibrillation. Hopefully this will attract the attention from people

generally interested in modeling of nonlinear systems into mathematically challenging

problems that pertain to important issues of cardiac modeling.

With respect to electrical propagation, the basic local dynamics at the cellular



CONTENTS 6

level describe the temporal evolution of the transmembrane voltage (i.e. potential

difference accross the cell membrane) and of the important ionic channels (i.e. membrane

proteins allowing the flow of ions across the cell membrane). The resulting equations

are based on experimental data from physiological measurements at the cellular level

and are extended to the tissue level by assuming a resistive intercellular coupling. This

combination of local cellular dynamics and the spatial coupling between cells yields a set

of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, that exhibit solitary pulses and pulse trains

as solutions, characteristic of excitable systems, and describe the propagation of action

potentials in the tissue. A finite superthreshold perturbation can bring these systems far

from their stable quiescent state for a given amount of time known as action potential

duration, that typically depends on the time elapsed from the previous excitation.

Many cardiac malfunctions are associated with disturbances of normal propagation,

sometimes involving the formation of re-entries often called rotors (i.e., sustained

rotational electrical activity in cardiac tissue), which are believed to underlie ventricular

tachycardias (VT) characterized by a rapid heartbeat [16, 17]. Note, that the term

”rotor” similar to the term ”pinwheel” was originally introduced by Winfree [18] to

denote the center of the spiral wave. In physics literature this region is usually called

the ”core” [19], while in contemporary medical literature the term ”rotor” is often used

as a synonym to ”spiral wave” , see e. g. [20]. They also constitute one building block

of ventricular fibrillation (VF), a particularly dangerous malfunction of the heart, in

which synchronous excitation and contraction of different parts of the ventricles is lost,

potentially causing sudden death if left untreated for more than a few minutes. Re-

entries underlying VT are usually rotors or spiral waves, and are sketched as spiraling

excitationsrotating around an unexcited core (i.e., neighborhood of the internal end of

such wavefront). A common explanation for the transition from VT to VF is related

to breakup of an initially created rotor near [21] or far-away [22] its core, resulting

in the continuous creation and destruction of spirals or to breakup of scroll waves

(i.e., rotating waves in resp. two or three-dimensional media with a spiral-like shape

around an unexcited filament). Thus, a major challenge is to classify and understand

the mechanisms that cause, first, the creation of rotors, and second, their subsequent

destabilization.

Although most biologically relevant mechanisms of rotor initiation are driven by

tissue inhomogeneities, this review will deal mostly with homogeneous, continuous

models that describe the tissue and organ scale of cardiac propagation. This is done

typically by comparing phenomena observed in simple cardiac models with even simpler,

generic models for propagation in excitable media. As a result, we neglect a number of

important issues in the cardiac modeling that have been covered in depth in preceding,

excellent reviews and books. More details on electrophysiological cell models that form

the basis of models for cardiac propagation by giving the local excitable dynamics are

summarized, e.g., in the book by Pullan et al. [23] and in an article by Fenton and

Cherry [24]. A more detailed account on the basic mechanism of cardiac propagation

than the one provided by us below was given by Kleber and Rudy [25].



CONTENTS 7

We neglect also many recent efforts towards an improved and extended modeling

of the intracellular calcium dynamics as an active process that typically requires a

stochastic modeling approach. For more information on these topics see, e.g., the

excellent reviews by Falcke [26] for a general discussion of intercellular calcium handling

and by Qu and colleagues [27] for a description of recent progress on stochastic

calcium dynamics in cardiac cells. Recently, many efforts have been undertaken to

employ information on cardiac anatomy and geometry from MRI imaging, histology

and other experimental techniques in order to built realistic models of three dimensional

propagation. We do not cover these topics here and refer to the articles by Plank, Bishop,

Clayton, Smaill, Lamata and colleagues [28–32].

Moreover, a number of shorter review articles are also available which offer valuable

information on the central topics of nonlinear dynamics and cardiac arrhythmias

discussed in this article. A short survey on cardiac arrhythmias can be found in the

article by Fenton et al. [33]. The phenomenologies of alternans [34, 35] and fibrillation

[36] as well as a dynamics-based classification of ventricular arrhythmias [37] were given

by Weiss and colleagues. The current understanding and experimental knowledge on

the role of spirals (or rotors) is summarized in a short review by Pandit and Jalife [20].

A shorter concise review of the physics of cardiac arrhythmogenesis was presented by

Karma [38].

This review is organized as follows: In the next section, we consider basic facts

regarding the electrophysiology of the heart at different scales. Mathematical details

of the models needed for the rest of the review are described in Section 3. Aspects

of wave propagation in excitable media in general and cardiac tissue in particular are

introduced in Section 4, that discusses also the influence of heterogeneities and geometry

effects. Different types of dynamics are studied in Sections 5-7, namely alternans in one

dimension, meandering and breakup in two dimensions and instability of scroll waves

in three dimensions. Methodic approaches to analyze these instabilities are discussed

in Section 8. Finally, Section 9 provides a summary of the main results and a short

discussion and outlook for future investigations.

2. Electrophysiology of the cardiac electrical activation

2.1. The heart

Situated at the chest cavity, between the right and left lungs, and supported by a

membranous structure, the heart is a muscle that pumps blood throughout the body.

The pumping is generated by a coordinated contraction, triggered by an electrical

impulse that propagates along cardiac tissue. The heart is separated in two halves

and has four main chambers. The lower chambers are the ventricles, while the smaller

upper chambers are called atria. The cardiac muscle, or myocardium, constitutes the

bulk of the heart. In Figure 1 the main parts of the heart are identified.

Figure 1. Explanatory sketch of the different parts of heart, including the four

electrically active chambers: two atria and two ventricles; and the main elements of the

heart’s blood circulation system, including most relevant arteries and veins. Reprinted

from the free open access book [39].

The heart is composed of cardiac muscle with intervening connective tissue, blood

vessels and nerves. Cardiac tissue is divided into three layers called endocardium,

myocardium and epicardium. The endocardium and epicardium are the internal and

external layers, respectively. In the middle lies the myocardium, thicker than the

former. Between the endocardium and myocardium is the subendocardial layer, where

the impulse-conducting system (Purkinje fibers) is located.

2.2. The cardiac myocytes

Cardiac cells are called myocytes, having a length of 80 − 100µm and a diameter
of 10 − 20µm. Each of these cells is separated from the extracellullar space by a
phospholipid bilayer membrane. This membrane presents selective permitivity, allowing



CONTENTS 9

some ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc) to flow between the extracellular and intracellular

media through a set of specific ion channels. The resulting charge imbalance produces a

transmembrane potential difference, whose evolution is governed by the balance between

the electrical and chemical gradients across the membrane of the cell. The potential at

which chemical and electrical forces are in equilibrium is called the reversal or Nernst

potential, and is specific to each ion. The potential at which the cell is at rest is known

as the resting potential, and in cardiac cells its value is typically around −85 mV. If a
sufficiently large stimulus is given to the cell, the transmembrane potential rises above

a threshold potential and an active response occurs, known as an action potential. The

amplitude of a cardiac action potential is of the order of 130 mV.

Figure 2. Sketch of a typical action potential in a ventricular myocyte. Phases and

ion currents responsible for the action potential: sharp increase due to sodium influx

(0), rapid decrease due to potassium outflux (1), balance currents and plateu phase

(2), end of calcium influx (3) and return to the resting potential (4).

In Figure 2, a typical time evolution of the transmembrane potential is shown,

resulting in an action potential with different phases. Phase 0 is characterized by a sharp

stroke due to rapid influx of sodium ions. During phase 1 there is a rapid decrease in the

membrane potential due to a fast outward potassium current. This is then balanced by

the inward Ca2+ currents giving rise to the characteristic plateau of phase 2. Finally, in

phase 3 the calcium currents cease and the membrane returns to its resting potential,

or phase 4, due to a slow outward potassium current. In summary, during phase 0

there is a depolarization (i.e., change in membrane potential from negative to positive

values) of the cell membrane while phase 3 corresponds to repolarization (i.e., change

in membrane potential that returns it to a negative value) of the membrane.

Myocytes are connected to each other by means of intercalated discs, which are

responsible of the mechanical and electrical coupling among cells. The latter is produced

through gap junctions (i.e., pipe-like channels that permit the flow of ions from one cell

to another). This results in the propagation of the action potential in tissue, giving rise

to an excitation wave, with a propagation speed characteristic of the type of cardiac



CONTENTS 10

tissue. Gap junctions are located at the longitudinal ends of the myocytes, that are

bundled in cardiac fibers along which the propagation speed is faster. Thus, cardiac

action potential propagation is both discrete and anisotropic.

Figure 3. Conduction system of the heart and its relation to the electrocardiogram.

The P waves are related to the atrial signal, the QRS complex to the depolarization

of the ventricles, and T waves to the repolarization of the ventricles. Reprinted from

the free open access book [39].

2.3. Electrical activity propagation

Cardiac electrical activity is initiated at the sinoatrial node (i.e., the natural pacemaker

of the heart) where action potentials are produced periodically. Then, the electrical

impulse is propagated along the atrium and, through the atrio-ventricular node, to

the His bundle. It finally arrives at the ventricular myocardium through the Purkinje

fibers (Figure 3), depolarizing first the endocardium and proceeding transmurally to the

epicardium.

The electrical activity of the heart is visible in the electrocardiogram (ECG). In this,

a series of electrodes is set on a person’s thorax, that record the small voltage changes

at that point (of the order of the microvolt). The voltage difference between a pair of

electrodes is known as a lead. For a typical 12 lead ECG, 10 electrodes are needed, that

are placed on the right and left arms (RA and LA), right and left legs (LR and LL),

and on the chest (precordial electrodes V1−6). From the recordings of these electrodes,

the different leads are defined. With the ECG both the rhythm and the morphology of

the cardiac excitation is recorded. The several phases of propagation along the heart

leave different traces in the ECG (Figure 3). Thus, anomalies in propagation result in

distinctive variations of these waves in the different leads.

The propagation of the electrical impulse gives rise to a series of events that result

in the contraction of the heart (Figure 4). The depolarization of the cell membrane

induces an inward flux of extracellular calcium ions through L-type calcium channels.

Figure 4. Excitation-contraction coupling. Top: Dynamics of the membrane action

potential (blue), the concentration of calcium (red) and contraction of the myocyte

(green). Bottom: During depolarization, calcium enters the cell through the L-

type calcium channels (LCC), opening the calcium gated ryanodine receptors (RyR)

and releasing the calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This induces the

shortening of the myofilaments and the contraction of the cell.

This elevates the Ca concentration in the cytosol, allowing the release of calcium from

the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (i.e., cell organelle that sequesters intracelullar calcium)

increasing further the calcium concentration in the cytosol in a process known as calcium

induced calcium release (CICR) (Figure 4). Then calcium binds to the thin-filament

protein troponin C (TnC), allowing myosin (i.e., type of molecular motor) heads to

bind to actin filaments and pull them by a process called a power stroke. Besides,

the presence of stretch-activated channels at the cell membrane results in a feedback

from contraction to action potential propagation. In this way, the coupling between

excitation and contraction represents a complex process, that involves the dynamics of

transmembrane potential, ion currents, intracellular calcium concentration, stretching-

induced currents, and fibers strain and stress.

2.4. Cardiac arrhytmias

The contraction of the heart is thus generated by a single wave of electrical excitation, see

Fig. 5(a), that signals the cells to contract in a smooth and highly coordinated way for

pumping blood to the body. Tachycardia corresponds to a rotor that accelerates the rate

of contraction, and typically is associated to a spiral wave, see Fig. 5(b). Fibrillation

occurs when the normal electrical activity is masked by higher frequency circulation

waves which create small, out-of-phase localized contractions. Even if these contractions



CONTENTS 12

can be created by small foci of cardiac stimulus, the most prevalent hypothesis is that

one or more spiral waves break into multiple waves leading to fibrillation. It can be

transient or degenerate into fibrillation if the spiral wave breaks, see Fig 5(c). The

mechanisms leading to arrhytmias and fibrillation are diverse and have been studied

both experimentally and computationally, for a review see [40].

3.1. Action potential

3.1.1. Nernst potential. In a cell, a phospholipid bilayer separates the intra and

extracellular media, resulting in a difference in the concentration of the different ions

across the cell membrane. The membrane is full with proteins that act as ion channels

and ion pumps, that allow the passive or active transport of ions across the membrane.

All together, the cell membrane is equivalent to a set of (voltage dependent) resistors,

batteries, and a capacitor.

Due to the concentration difference between the intra and extracellular media, there

exists a potential difference, known as the Nernst potential, specific to each kind of ion.

If the potential in the intra and extracellular media is Vi0 and Ve0, respectively, then,

according to Boltzmann statistics, the probability of finding an ion in each medium is:

pi ∝ e−eVi0/kBT ; pe ∝ e−eVe0/kBT , (1)
where e is the elementary charge and kB is the Boltzmann constant.

The ratio in the concentrations is equal to the ratio of probabilities, so

3.1.2. Ion currents. The total potential drop across the membrane for a given ion

is obtained from the concentration difference between the interior and the exterior of

the cell, i.e. the Nernst potential, see Eq. (3), plus the potential drop due to the

current across the corresponding ion channel, assuming that the channel is ohmic. For a

schematic version of the two components see Fig. 6. Then, the transmembrane potential

the transmembrane current, where the subindex X corresponds to the ion considered.

Then, for each ion there is a current across the cell membrane that is proportional to the

difference between the transmembrane potential and its equilibrium Nernst potential

IX = gX(V − V XNernst), (5)
where gX = 1/rX is the membrane conductance for that ion. Such linear dependence

on the potential can be derived from more realistic calculations and, for specific ions

it agrees with experimental current voltage I-V curves, see an example in Figure 7.

For some ion currents other approaches based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current

equation are more adequate [11].

The conductances gX are in general not constants, but depend on membrane

voltage. The permeability of the channels is regulated by the state of gates which

permit the pass of ions through the channel. The gates represent the state of proteins

which open and close the corresponding channel in response to, for instance, a change

in transmembrane voltage. The dynamics of the gates is described by Hodgkin-Huxley

type equations [41] for w, i.e. the opening probability of the gate:

dw

dt
=

w∞(V )− w
τw(V )

, (6)

where the functions w∞(V ) and τw(V ) can be obtained experimentally measuring the

current-voltage relations. Thus, gX = gX(V,w, ...), together with the opening and

closing dynamics of the gates describe the dynamic value of the conductances.

The total current carried by all ions is just Iion =
∑

X IX . In steady state the total

current is zero Iion = 0, so the resulting resting potential Vr can be expressed in terms

of the Nernst potential and the conductances of the different ions:

Vr =

In addition to the ion current, there is a capacitive current related to the

potential propagation along nerve cells. In this formulation, the potential is considered

to vary along the longitudinal direction of the cell, while it is constant in the transversal

(or radial) directions. Due to the variation of transmembrane potential along the cable,

intra- and extracellular axial currents per unit length appear, given by [11]:

Ii(x) = gi[Vi(x+ dx)− Vi(x)]/dx,
Ie(x) = ge[Ve(x+ dx)− Ve(x)]/dx; (9)

where we have assumed that Ohm’s law is satisfied and gi, ge are the conductances per

unit length of the intra- and extracellular media.

Also, from Kirchhoff’s law, the sum of the currents entering and leaving a given

point must sum up to zero, so:

Ii(x)− Ii(x+ dx) = Itdx = Ie(x+ dx)− Ie(x). (10)
Besides, the transmembrane current is the sum of the ionic and capacitive currents:

It = p

where p is the perimeter of the cell. In the continuous limit dx → 0, the previous

which ensures a null conductance if any of the conductances is zero [11].

3.2.2. Intercellular action potential propagation. So far, the equations derived above

are valid for propagation in a single cardiomyocyte. For the modeling of tissue one has

to consider cardiac cells coupled through gap junctions, and different approaches can be

employed.

Continuum model. In the continuum model one has to solve the cable equation in each

cardiomyocyte and impose boundary conditions at the gap junctional space, such that

gi
∂Vi
∂x

(x = x−j ) = gi
∂Vi
∂x

(x = x+j ) = gjVj, (21)

where gj is the gap junction conductance, x
+
j and x

−
j represent the positions of the right

and left sides of the junction, and Vj = Vi(x = x
+
j ) − Vi(x = x−j ) is the intracellular

voltage drop across the gap junction. A simpler formulation is to consider the continuum

cable equation (19), but for an effective conductance geff that is an average of the

conductances at the intracellular medium and gap junctional spaces in a similar way

than the harmonic mean employed in Eq. (20) and obtained from a homogenization

approach [42]. In any of these cases, the difference between a continuum and a discrete

description only appears when studying the effects of propagation failure [43], typical

for low conductivities and determined by the interplay between the properties of the

action potential of the myocytes and structural properties of the tissue.

Isopotential model. An alternative approach is to assume an isopotential model, in

which the whole cell is at the same potential and the potential drops occur only at

the gap junction resistances. Then, one should consider the discretized version of the

continuum equations, with a spatial step equal to the size of the cell dx ≃ 100µm, and
gi ≡ gj, the gap junction conductance. Such a model is convenient when considering the
effects of the time and voltage dependence of the gap junction conductances. In general

terms gj = gj(Vj, t), where Vj is the transjunctional potential, so Vj = V
n+1
i − V ni is the

difference in intracellular potential of the two cells joined by the gap junction. The gap

junction itself behaves as a gate, so

with the steady state conductance and time constant depending on the intercellular

potential, such that

gss = gmin +
gmax − gmin

1 + exp [A(Vj − V1/2)]
, τj(Vj) = τj0e

−Vj/Vτ . (23)

Typical values are V1/2 ∼ 40 − 60 mV, Vτ ∼ 15 mV, and τj0 ∼ 100s [44]. For typical
wave speeds of 50-70 cm/s and durations of the upstroke of ∼ 3 − 5 ms the width of
the front of the depolarization pulse is ∼ 0.15 − 0.45cm, corresponding to 15-45 cells.
Given the upstroke voltage difference of ∼ 100mV, then the voltage difference between
cells is, at most, ∼ 6 − 7mV. Thus, under normal conditions, the dynamics of the
gap junction conductances does not seem to play a role, and one can assume it to be

constant. However, in some cardiac diseases there is a reduction or redistribution of the

protein molecules forming gap junction channels, from intercalated disks to lateral cell

borders [45]. The resulting gap junction and connexin expression remodeling [46, 47]

reduces conduction velocity and enhances anisotropy in diseased myocardium [48].

3.2.3. 3D formulation. A generalization of the cable equation to three dimensional

tissue can be made, assuming that cardiac tissue is composed of two media, so at each

point of space we can define intracellular and extracellular potentials. Then, assuming

Ohm’s law, we can write the currents as Je = σe∇Ve, Ji = σi∇Vi, where σi(x) and
σe(x) are the conductances of the intra- and extracellular media, that in this case are

assumed to be of tensorial character, so they define directions where propagation is

faster (or slower) and depend on the distribution of cardiac fibers in tissue. Here,

implicitly we are assuming that these conductances are average values over gap junctions,

inhomogeneities, etc. Again, applying Kirchhoff’s law, we obtain the bidomain model

for three-dimensional tissue, which are the equivalent of Eqs. (14) and (17):

χ

(

Cm

∂t
+ Iion

)

= ∇ · (σi∇Vi) = −∇ · (σe∇Ve), (24)

∇ · (σi∇Vi + σe∇Ve) = 0; (25)
where now χ is the ratio of surface to cell volume. In the case when σi = λσe, so the

anisotropy ratios are the same in the intracellular and extracellular media (which is

not the case in cardiac tissue), the above description can be reduced to a monodomain

equation for the transmembrane potential. In effect, in this case

∇ · (σe∇Ve) = −
λ

1 + λ
∇ · (σe∇V ), (26)

so we obtain the monodomain equation:

χ

(

Cm

)

=
λ

1 + λ
∇ · (σe∇V ). (27)

Then, the propagation of the transmembrane potential is described by the equation:

∂t

+∇ · (D∇V ), (28)



CONTENTS 19

where typical values of the membrane capacitance are Cm ∼ 1 − 10µF/cm2, varying
for different types of cells or different species [49]. The diffusion coefficient D ∼ 0.001
cm2/ms is derived from the resistivity between cells, and the cell capacitance and surface

to volume ratio [11]. Resistivity and surface to volume ratio, usually obtained from an

approximation of a cardiac cell by a cylinder, may also change from cell to cell.

For the rest of the review we will consider the monodomain description of cardiac

tissue propagation Eq. (28). Although this is not a correct description for two and

three-dimensional tissue [50], since the intracellular medium is more anisotropic than

the extracellular medium, it is usually a sufficient description of action potential

propagation in most situations. A relevant exception is the case of defibrillation, where

a bidomain description is required [51,52]. The injection of current into resting cardiac

tissue produces the formation of virtual electrodes, that are thought to be behind

the mechanism by which an external electric shock is able to annihilate reentrant

waves. Such virtual electrodes are virtual cathodes and anodes resulting from unequal

anisotropy ratios of the intracellular and extracellular spaces of the cardiac [51–53] or

from the borders of non-conducting heterogeneities [54, 55].

3.3. Ionic models

Ion currents across the ion channels at the cell membrane are governed by highly

nonlinear processes. There are different types of active cells in the heart and the explicit

form of the total current Iion depends on the type of cell and species [33].

• Ventricular myocytes. The action potential dynamics of ventricular myocytes has
been amply studied. There is a large list of ventricle cell models [33], which

are developed for different type of species, from mice or rabbits to dogs and

humans. The ventricles are the largest chambers of the heart and where electrical

discoordination becomes more dangerous [56]. Furthermore the thickness of the

ventricular walls makes it necessary to consider the three-dimensional structure of

the tissue.

• Atrial myocytes. The models for atrial cells are characterized by a short action
potential due to the reduced calcium current with respect to ventricular myocytes.

There are several models for the action potential of atrial cells, for a comparison

between two of the latest models in human tissue see [57].

• Cells forming the sinoatrial node. The regular activity of the heart is initiated by
this specialized population of cardiac cells. Their membrane potential oscillates

periodically [58], generating electrical oscillatory signals. A detailed comparison of

all the numerical models of automaticity has been recently presented [59].

• Purkinje fibers. The first models of cardiac cells were derived for this type of
cells [60]. The network of the Purkinje fibers produces a fast conduction pathway

to transmit electrical excitation from the atria into the ventricles [61]. The action

potentials of the myocytes at the Purkinje fibers present characteristic features:



CONTENTS 20

the velocity of propagation is faster than in other types of cardiac cells, and the

action potential duration is longer [61]. These cells can also present automaticity

and produce oscillations. For a review of several models of the Purkinje fibers cells

see [62].

For concreteness, in this review we focus in models of ventricular cardiac tissue. A

full description of all the possible ion currents, together with the dynamics of the ion

channel gates, is complex and produces models with a large number of equations. In

contrast, generic models try to reproduce the main properties of such ion currents with a

reduced number of parameters. In this section, we classify the models employed for the

study of wave instabilities in cardiac tissue in three classes. First, we consider realistic

ionic models that describe in detail several ion currents across the cell membrane.

Second, we study simple cardiac models that fit the main characteristic experimental

features of the action potential into simpler formulations. Finally, we consider generic

models of excitable media.

3.3.1. Detailed electrophysiological models. Electrophysiological detailed models [30]

are based on direct experimental observations from voltage and patch clamp studies.

Typically, these models include many Hodgkin-Huxley type equations [41] to describe

individual ion currents (IX) forming the total current Iion(V,w, pi) =
∑

X IX across the

cell membrane [63]. Modern ionic models also describe the changes of concentrations

of all major ions inside cardiac cells, and generally consist of anywhere between 10 and

60 equations [64, 65]. The quantitative descriptions of ion currents in cardiac tissue

are continually being revised, and there is not general agreement on the best model

for all circumstances [66]. Detailed models are adequate to numerically explore the

effects of different drugs in the propagation properties of the action potential [67]. The

nonlinear terms are typically stiff so adaptive methods are usually required to obtain

fast integration speeds [68, 69].

Below, we present some detailed electrophysiological models that have been amply

used in studies of cardiac wave propagation.

• Beeler-Reuter model. One of the first models of action potential in ventricular
myocytes is the Beeler-Reuter model [70]. It was the first ionic model used

to simulate spatio-temporal propagation in two dimensions [71]. It reproduces

important experimental phenomena by the use of four individual ion currents

in terms of Hodgkin-Huxley type equations. The total current for this model is

Iion = INa + ICa + Ix1 + IK1, where the corresponding ion currents are:

INa = (GNam
3hj +GNaC)(V − ENa),

ICa = Gsdf(V − Esi),

Ix1 = x10.8
e0.04(V+77) − 1
e0.04(V+35)

IK1 = 0.35

)

, (29)



CONTENTS 21

where INa is the fast inward Na
+ current, adapted from the sodium activation

parameter determined for squid axon by Hodgkin and Huxley [41]; ICa is the slow

inward Ca2+ current, which follows the same functional form; Ix1 is the time-

activated outward current and IK1 is the time-independent K
+ outward current.

The dependence on the membrane voltage of the latter two currents is chosen to

match current-voltage relations seen in myocardium, and they produce a reasonable

plateau and repolarization and it was originally introduced for purkinje fibers

modeling in [72]. The values ENa, Esi are reversal potentials and m, h, j, d, f

and x1 are gating variables, whose dynamics can be modeled as

dwi
dt

= (wi∞ − wi)/τwi , (30)
where wi represents any of the gating variables, and wi∞ and τwi , which depend on

V , are the steady state value and the relaxation time constant for the corresponding

variable, see Eq. (6). The shape of the action potential can be seen in Fig.9(a) with

standard values of the parameters of the model.

This model was posteriorly modified giving rise to several versions of the model. A

calcium speedup was introduced in [71] to suppress spiral wave breakup present in

the original equations giving rise to the modified Beeler-Reuter model.

• Luo-Rudy model. Multitude of results regarding ventricular tissue have been
illustrated with the Luo-Rudy phase 1 (LR1) model [64]. It describes the biophysical

mechanism of generation of action potential in cardiac guinea pig cells by a relatively

small number of state variables and was widely used to study wave propagation in

2D and 3D cardiac tissue [73, 74]. This model speeds up the opening and closing

rate coefficients for the sodium current from Beeler-Reuter model, see Eqs. (29),

and adds three new currents following the classical Hodgkin and Huxley description.

The representation of the total current is Iion = INa + Isi + IK + IK1 + IKp + Ib,

where the corresponding currents are:

INa = GNam
3hj(V − ENa),

Isi = Gsidf(V − Esi),
IK = GKxx1(V − EK),
IK1 = GK1K1∞(V − EK1),
IKp = GKpKp(V − EKp),
Ib = Gb(V − Eb); (31)

where INa is the fast Na
+ current, Isi is the slow inward Ca

2+ current, IK is the slow

outward K+ current, IK1 is the time-independent K
+ current, IKp is the plateau

K+ current, and Ib is a background current with constant conductance. The values

ENa, Esi, EK , EK1 , EKp and Eb are the reversal potentials and m, h, j, d, f and x

are again gating variables, whose dynamics can be modeled by Eq. (30).

The sodium conductance GNa controls the speed of the waves [75] and in a

general sense the excitability of the tissue, and Gsi is responsible for the front-

tail interaction between the pulses.



CONTENTS 22

An extension of this model is the Luo-Rudy phase 2 (LR2) model that includes a

more detailed description of intracellular Ca2+ [76].

• TenTusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov model. This model was developed for human
ventricular tissue [65]. It is based on experimental data on most of the major ion

currents and includes a basic intracellular calcium dynamics. The model reproduces

the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution. The

representation of the total current is Iion = INa + IK1 + Ito + IKr + IKs + ICaL +

INaCa + INaK + IpCa + IpK + IbCa + IbNa, where currents through ion channels (for

example INa) and ion exchangers (for example INaCa) are considered. The ion

currents depend on gating variables and a total of 17 equations are integrated to

account for the total transmembrane current. The main characteristics of wave

propagation obtained with this model were compared with more complex versions

of human ventricular models [66].

3.3.2. Cardiac models with simplified ion currents. Simple models of cardiac tissue

typically consist of a reduced number of equations, between two and four, aimed to

reproduce general qualitative properties of the cardiac action potential. Some of these

models are obtained as reduction of ionic models [77], but normally they are adaptable

models where Iion(V,w, pi) is a phenomenological expression of V and w with several

tuning parameters. Such models can reproduce quantitatively the overall characteristics

of cardiac tissue that are relevant for propagation, such as restitution of action potential

duration [78,79] and restitution of conduction velocity [78].

• Fenton-Karma model. Perhaps the best known example of a simple cardiac model
is the Fenton-Karma model [78], an extension of a previous simpler model [80]. It

consists of the usual cable equation:

∂v

∂t
= −

Ifi + Iso + Isi
Cm

+∇ · (D∇v), (32)

for a renormalized variable v. From this the transmembrane potential can be

approximated by V = (100v − 80)mV . The three phenomenological currents read:
Ifi = − up(v − Vc)(1− v)/τd,
Iso = v(1− p)/τo + p/τr,
Isi = − w

{

1 + tanh[k(v − V sic )]
}

/(2τsi), (33)

mimicking fast inward sodium (Ifi), slow outward potassium (Iso) and slow inward

calcium (Isi) currents. The variables u and w are gating variables which are used to

regulate inactivation of the fast inward and slow inward currents. Their evolution

depends on the transmembrane potential:

du

dt
= (1− p)(1− u)/τ−u (v)− pu/τ+u ,

dw

dt
= (1− p)(1− w)/τ−w − pw/τ+w ; (34)

where

p =

{

1 if v ≥ Vc,
0 if v < Vc,

(35)

and

τ−u (v) = (1− q)τ−u1 + qτ−u2 with q =
{

1 if v ≥ Vv,
0 if v < Vv.

(36)

The gate variables u and w are related respectively to the product of the gates h

and j of the sodium current, as well as to the gate f controlling the inactivation and

reactivation of the calcium current, in the more elaborated models of section (3.3.1).

Expressions (33) are not based on physical models of realistic ion currents, however

the flexibility of the functions Eqs. (34) permits the tunning of the parameters to

reproduce different propagation properties of experiments or other more realistic

models. Figure 9(b) shows an example of the action potential with this model.

The Fenton-Karma model with different parameter values has been employed to

study diverse types of instabilities in cardiac tissue [40]. More realistic action

potential shapes have been obtained with the extension of this model by an

additional equation [81,82].

• Aliev-Panfilov model. This is another frequently used model with simplified kinetics
[79]. It does not describe ion currents but the model is formed by nonlinear functions

which may be tuned to reproduce pulse shape and the restitution properties of the

canine myocardium with good precision. The model consists of just two equations

∂v

(w − p0v(v − p3 − 1)) (37)



CONTENTS 24

where v is a renormalized transmembrane potential, related to the physiological

one by V = 100v− 80 mV . The parameters ǫ0, p1 and p2 specify the scale between
v and the control variable w. The parameters p0 and p3 determine the shape of the

cubic function which controls the action potential dynamics. This model can also

be considered an extension of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, discussed in the next

section.

Besides these two models, there is a collection of reduced models created with the

same spirit as the ones here described. Other two-variable cardiac models were employed

for the incipient simulations of cardiac arrhythmias [83] and the first descriptions of

spiral breakup [84].

3.3.3. Generic reaction-diffusion models. Generic excitable media can be described by

a system of two coupled reaction-diffusion equations:

∂v

∂t
= ∇ · (D∇v) + I(v, w, pi),

∂w

∂t
= R(v, w, pi); (38)

where v corresponds to a scaled transmembrane potential V .

These generic models of excitable media are not derived from physiological data

and some properties of the waves often differ from waves of transmembrane potential in

physiologically realistic models. Since they do not aim at quantitative agreement, it is

usual to consider the functions I(v, w, pi) and R(v, w, pi) as simple as possible [85, 86].

A simple model should contain at least a stable equilibrium state, a threshold for wave

triggering and a refractory period [87].

The main advantage of these models is their simplicity, together with their ability

to reproduce general qualitative properties of cardiac excitation, such as generation and

propagation of a pulse, refractory properties, dispersion relations, etc. They are specially

appropriate to study features of cardiac wave propagation that are generic to a whole

range of excitable media. Besides, due to their simplicity, they allow the implementation

of effective numerical solvers and in some cases (or in some limits) they are amenable to

analytic treatment. For historical and practical reasons, here we consider three examples

of generic models:

• FitzHugh-Nagumo model. This historical model was derived in the 60s [85, 88]. It
reproduces the plateau observed in cardiac cells which was absent in the Hodgkin-

Huxley model of the nerve impulse [63]. The specific form of the reaction terms

is:

I(v, w, pi) =
1

ǫ

(

v −
v3

3
− w

)

,

R(v, w, pi) = v + p1 − p2w; (39)
where the parameters p1 and p2 specify the inhibitor kinetics. The small parameter

ǫ is the ratio of the temporal scales between v and w. The evolution of the model



CONTENTS 25

is shown in Fig. 9(c) in comparison with more realistic description of the action

potential. The action potential is shorter than the other type of models because of

the inhibitory tail produced by the second variable w.

• Barkley model. A very popular simple model for excitable media, given by [89]:

I(v, w, pi) =
1

ǫ
v(1− v)

(

v −
w + p2
p1

)

,

R(v, w, pi) = v − w; (40)
where ǫ is the ratio of the temporal scales between v and w. The parameters p1
and p2 specify the activator kinetics, with p2 effectively controlling the excitation

threshold of the system.

This model has been widely used for large and systematic numerical studies due to

the particularly fast numerical implementation in two [90] and three [89] dimensions.

• Bär-Eiswirth model. The Bär-Eiswirth model is an extension of the Barkley model,
introduced to study spiral breakup [91]:

I(v, w, pi) =
1

ǫ
v(1− v)

This function leads to inhibitor production only above a threshold value of v, giving

rise to a rich variety of patterns.

There are several other examples of generic models which are used to study wave

dynamics in excitable media. For example the Puschino model, extensively used in

incipient numerical simulations of excitable media [92], and its modification [93].

The boundary between generic and simple cardiac models is obviously diffuse and

some FitzHugh-Nagumo-like models have been modified to obtain more physiological

descriptions of the cardiac tissue by the introduction of additional temporal scales in

the model [94].

3.4. Excitation-contraction coupling

In section 2.3 we considered wave propagation in a static medium. The heart, however,

contracts, and this effect goes beyond a mere change in the geometry, since it induces a

modification of the electrical properties of tissue [95, 96]. This has been shown to have

important implications for the creation of a proarrhythmic substrate [97].



CONTENTS 26

3.4.1. Excitation-induced contraction Cardiac depolarization prompts the opening of

the L-type calcium channels at the cell membrane, resulting in an influx of calcium ions

into the cell. This, in turn, opens the Ryanodine Receptors (RyR) at the sarcoplasmic

reticulum (SR), a bag inside the cell where the concentration of calcium is about 1000

larger than at the cytosol, in a process known as calcium induced calcium release (CICR).

When the concentration at the cytosol rises, the crossbridge cycle starts through the

coupling of Ca2+ to the protein complex troponim C (TnC), finally resulting in the

generation of force by the muscle fiber. Although complex, the process of generation of

force at the cellular level is quite well understood [98]. Unfortunately, it is not easy to

translate this knowledge at the cellular level to a macroscopic description. The passive

viscoelastic properties of cardiac tissue are not well known, due to its high anisotropy,

history dependency, and the combination of contractile and passive material (collagen,

connective tissue).

The deformation of the tissue is usually modeled using continuum models of finite

elasticity [99, 100] (although discrete models have been also considered [101]). In the

former, the conservation of linear momentum gives a condition for local stresses, that

in equilibrium results in:

∇ · σ + f = 0 (43)
where σ is the stress tensor and f are the body forces. To obtain the deformation, stress

has to be related to strain and rate of strain, through constitutive equations [99, 100].

During cardiac contraction, the total stress acting at a given point is considered as the

sum of active Ta and passive stresses. The expression for the active tension is based

in the cross-bridge mechanism, in which the myosin molecules form cross-bridges that

interact with the thin filaments in the sarcomeres to generate force. Experiments show

that attachment and detachment of cross-bridges depends not only on the current state

of the muscle, but also on the history of length changes. Thus, a detailed mathematical

model for the development of active tension should take into account the concentrations

of intracellular calcium and of calcium bound to Troponin C, the proportion of actin sites

available for cross-bridge binding, the length-tension dependence and a force-velocity

relation [98]. To circumvent the complex cross-bridge mechanism responsible for the

development of active tension, simplified models have been proposed, that couple tension

directly to the transmembrane potential Ta = Ta(V ) [102].

3.4.2. Stretch activated channels. Besides the contraction of the tissue due to its

excitation, there exists electro-mechanical coupling by which mechanical deformation

affects the electrical properties of tissue through the opening of stretch activated

channels (SACs). This effect is responsible, for instance, of the commotio cordis, an

often fatal arrhythmia generated by a sudden blow in the chest [103], or of acute cardiac

death in ischaemia [95]. The observation that the occurrence of atrial fibrillation is

higher upon pressure overload is probably also related to this effect. The ion current

ISAC corresponding to the stretch activated channels is added to the cable equation

In simple formulations [104, 105] ISAC was assumed to be linearly proportional to

deformation and to the deviation of the transmembrane potential from its Nernst

equilibrium value ESAC , so

ISAC = GSAC(
√
C − 1)(V − ESAC). (45)

In fact, it has been observed that the conductance of this current is not a constant, but

varies with time, having an activation time of 20 ms to peak current, and then a decay

to half the peak current value in about 50 ms [106,107].

3.5. Anisotropy.

One of the main characteristics of cardiac myocytes is their elongated shape, that induces

their alignment in the tissue. A myocyte can be seen as a cylinder 100 µm long and 10-

20 µm wide. The fibers of the cell are oriented parallel to their long axis, and contract

in such direction.

The gap junctions mainly accumulate at both ends of the cylinder. In tissue, this

asymmetrical distribution of gap junctions produces a faster propagation of the action

potential along the direction parallel to the myocytes axis than perpendicularly to it,

with a 2:1 velocity ratio. More detailed models consider also the laminar order of the

cells in the tissue, introducing an additional anisotropy in the velocity of the waves,

giving rise to three different velocities with ratio 4:2:1. Such velocities correspond,

respectively, to the fiber axis, parallel to the laminar arrangement of myocytes, and

normal to the arrangement of myocytes [108].

The effect of anisotropy can be incorporated into a model of wave propagation in

cardiac tissue by the modification of the diffusion coefficient in the cable equation (28).

In the monodomain approach the diffusion tensor is usually determined by two diffusion

coefficient values: one in the direction of fast propagation (D‖) and a second value for

the two perpendicular directions (D⊥). To obtain a ratio 1:2 in the velocities a relation

D⊥ ∼ D‖/4 is used. Typical values of the velocities employed in the monodomain
approach are c‖ ∼ 50 cm/s and c⊥ ∼ 20 cm/s for the longitudinal and the transversal
direction of the fibers.

However, extra and intracellular anisotropy ratios are different. It implies that

a strict reduction to a monodomain description is not possible. The values in the

longitudinal direction of the extra and intracellular conductivities are similar, but

intracellular transversal conductivities is one or two orders of magnitude smaller than

the extracellular conductivity [109,110].

3.5.1. Modeling three-dimensional anisotropy. The direction of anisotropy in the tissue

varies in the transmural direction such that the fiber direction rotates, giving rise to



CONTENTS 28

rotational anisotropy [78, 111]. This effect produces a continuous rotation of the fiber

axis of ∆θ ≃ 120◦ between the endocardium and the epicardium. This total angle is
roughly constant independently of the local thickness of the ventricle. In order to model

such change in the propagation properties the diffusion tensor is accordingly modify:

D12 = D21 = (D‖ −D⊥,1) cos θ(z) sin θ(z), (48)
where the function θ(z) corresponds to the transmural distribution of the anisotropy.

This function can be obtained from experimental data, see for example [112], and

included into detailed whole heart models [113].

The variation on the fiber axis can be constant or it may accumulate in the regions

with transitions between different zones of the tissue [114].

4. Wave propagation in models of cardiac tissue

4.1. Homogeneous isotropic tissue

The complete modeling of the heart requires the combination of approaches from

different areas of physics [115]. The fluid dynamics in the blood vessels and the cavities

of the heart depends on the stresses generated by the heart walls, which are described

by continuum mechanics. Their motion is in turn the result of the electro-mechanical

coupling [102]. Therefore, the electrophysiology of the tissue determines the contraction

of the heart, its pumping properties and the resulting blood flow.

The electrophysiological dynamics of the atria and ventricles are connected through

the electrical propagation across the atrio-ventricular node and on the Purkinje fibers.

Since this affects only the initial condition for wave propagation in the ventricles, it is

possible to study both regions independently. For the ventricles, there have been efforts

to create detailed electrophysiological models incorporating realistic geometries [116].

The first geometric models of the ventricles were obtained by averaging of histological

sectioning. Examples of such studies are the San Diego rabbit model [117] and the

Auckland swine model [118]. Similarly, detailed models of human atria are also available

[119]. More recently, individual geometries of the hearts are obtained by magnetic

resonance imaging like e. g. in the Oxford rabbit model [29].

The distribution of cells within the ventricles is not homogeneous. Epicardial and

endocardial cells have different electrophysiological properties and, therefore, the local

action potential dynamics is different depending on the location of the cell inside the

ventricle. More controversial is the presence of midmyocardial M-cells in between the

endocardium and the epicardium, cells with a prolonged action potential in comparison

with cells in normal epicardium or endocardium [120].

The cable equation (28), together with the highly nonlinear dynamics of the action

potential, describes the electrical excitation that propagates through the heart. A

complete knowledge of all the factors that affect the propagation of the electrical

signal is not possible, therefore simplifications and approximations are commonly used.

Although cardiac tissue is three-dimensional, many properties of propagation can be

studied in lower dimensions. For example, the characterization of the conduction

velocity depending on different electrophysiological properties or the dispersion relation

during periodic pacing can be analyzed in one dimensional systems, the characteristic

frequency of rotors can be obtained in two-dimensional domains. On the other hand,

while the ventricular wall is thick and anisotropic, the atria are much thinner and a two-

dimensional approximation is not unreasonable. In effect, fibrillation in atria is clearly

different from ventricular fibrillation [56]. While many modelers assume that atrial

fibrillation is produced in a thin tissue by a pure two-dimensional mechanism, fibrillation

in the ventricles requires inclusion of the third dimension in the models [121, 122].

Nevertheless, more and more detailed structural information is included in current three-

dimensional models of the atria see e.g. [123] and ventricles, see e.g. [31]. Other elements

of the heart like the Purkinje fibers can be conveniently approximated as one-dimensional



CONTENTS 30

fibers to study the propagation of the electrical signal. Finally, the sinoatrial node is

highly localized and descriptions based on pure ordinary differential equations are useful

to study the characteristics of the oscillation.

Under normal pacing, cardiac tissue receives a periodic, localized stimulation, and

the excitation propagates in the form of traveling waves. Besides, there exist self-

maintained excitations in the form of rotors, corresponding to spiral (in two-dimensions)

or scroll waves (in three-dimensions).

4.1.1. Traveling waves. Myocytes are connected through gap junctions, see Section 3.2.

The electrical signal propagates fast along the cell body, but the velocity is reduced at

the gap junctions. If the connectivity between cells is too small propagation failure may

occur because adjacent cells are not excited anymore and propagation therefore stalls. If

the connectivity is large enough the propagation velocity can be averaged, so an action

potential excitation propagagates along a one-dimensional strand of myocytes with

roughly constant velocity. Models of one-dimensional cardiac tissue in the continuum

limit then support traveling waves with constant shape and velocity. The shape of the

action potential depends on the specific model employed, see Fig. 10 for examples of

traveling waves in three models of cardiac tissue.

The parameters which control the propagation properties of the tissue are the

conductivity and the fast and slow ion currents.

• Conductivity: The change on the conductivity and the corresponding diffusion
parameter D, see cable equation (28), modifies the velocity of propagation of the

wave without changing the characteristic times of the ion currents, which remain

unaffected, see Fig. 11(a-b). The structure of the cable equation implies a square

root dependence of the velocity on the parameterD (c ∝
√
D). Regions of decreased

conductivity correspond to the border of severe ischaemic regions [124] or to zones

substantially reduces wave velocity, while the APD remains almost constant [75].

with a large fraction of fibrosis, a very common process in cardiac remodeling,

effectively decreases the conductivity [125]. In general, remodeling processes in

cardiac disease affects conductivity and elevates the risk of severe arrhythmia [47]

• Fast depolarizing ion currents: Fast gating of ion channels inside the myocyte
and the corresponding currents, typically associated to sodium in the physiological

models of cardiac tissue, can also control the conduction velocity [126], see Fig. 11(c-

d). These processes are associated to the ratio between two characteristic temporal

scales in generic models which can also control the velocity of the action potential

waves [40].

• Slow repolarizing ion currents: Slow processes control the repolarization of the
cell and therefore the action potential duration. These processes are associated to

calcium or potassium currents and the action potential decrease is decoupled from



CONTENTS 32

the decrease of the velocity in physiological models, see Fig. 11(e-f). In simpler

models such decoupling is not achieve. An inhomogeneous reduction of action

potential is associated to ischaemia [126] and other pro-arrhythmic mechanisms

[127] as, for instance, the Brugada Syndrome [128, 129]. Such dispersion of

refractoriness may result in localized block and the induction of reentry [130,131].

When two waves propagating in different directions collide, they annihilate each

other. Relevant for cardiac tissue is also the study of interactions between consecutive

waves traveling in the same direction. When one end of the tissue is forced periodically

to produce waves, a periodic sequence of excitations often called a wave train propagates

through the system. At low pacing frequencies, there is practically no interaction

between consecutive waves and the velocity of the wavetrain is the same as the one

for a solitary traveling wave. On the other hand, at fast pacing, a wave may not be

able to propagate because it enters the refractory tail (i.e. the region behind the wave

where tissue has not yet fully recovered) of the preceding wave and propagation is

blocked. In between these two extreme situations, waves are able to propagate under

the influence of the refractory tail of the previous wave by reducing their propagation

velocity and their action potential duration. Both quantities depend on the local time

elapsed between consecutive pulses (i.e. the diastolic interval, DI), see Fig. 12 for a

particular example. The information on this dependence gives the action potential

duration (APD) and conduction velocity restitution (CV) curves. When this dependence

becomes very strong, an initially periodic wavetrain may become unstable and evolve

into alternans, a state in which the speed of the waves changes as they propagate along

tissue, see Section 5.

In two- and three-dimensional media the diversity in wave propagation increases.

Planar, circular, elliptical or even more complex waves can be generated depending on

the initial condition. Planar waves propagate at the same velocity as in the equivalent

one-dimensional system. When the wavefront is curved, however, the velocity of the

waves decreases with respect to the corresponding planar wave. In effect, the velocity

of an excitation pulse in cardiac tissue depends on the local curvature (κ) through the



CONTENTS 33

eikonal relation:

c = c0 −Dκ, (49)
where c0 is the velocity of the planar wave, and D is the diffusion coefficient [132]. This

expression fails for curved periodic traveling waves. Under such conditions a pre-factor

multiplying D in Eq.(49) is needed, see [133] for more details.

4.1.2. Spiral waves. Besides pulses, models for two-dimensional tissue often admit

rotating spiral waves, which are related to functional re-entry in cardiac tissue [135], see

Sec. 6.2. There are several experimental observations of spiral wave rotation in cardiac

tissue [16, 134, 135], see for example Fig. 13. If reentry in the form of spirals occurs

in the atria or the ventricles, spirals may be implicated with arrhythmias like atrial

flutter or ventricular tachycardia. The latter can be further classified into monomorphic

or polymorphic VT depending on whether there is only a single main frequency or

additional beats (amplitude modulations). The latter phenomenon is believed to appear

either due to the meandering motion of a single spiral or due to the existence of several

spiral waves in the tissue.

A way to create a spiral wave is to start with a broken pulse (a finger), so the

excitation front propagates around its free-end giving rise to the formation of a rotating

spiral wave. Depending on parameters, it is also possible that the newly generated

free-end does not grow but retracts. Such condition corresponds to a sub-excitable

medium. Another way to generate a spiral wave in cardiac tissue is the introduction

of an excitation in the wake of a two-dimensional traveling wave. The new excitation

cannot propagate in the direction of the refractory tail of the first wave. Hence, it

slides along the refractory tail until the tissue becomes again excitable and then rotates,



CONTENTS 34

creating the spiral, see the whole process in Fig. 14. Depending on the shape of the

secondary excitation, one or two spiral waves can be formed. The generation of the

spiral wave after the second excitation only occurs during a particular window of time,

known as the vulnerability window [136]. If the second perturbation comes too early, a

new wave cannot be generated because that part of the tissue is still in the refractory

state. If it comes too late, the perturbation generates a circular wave and no reentry is

formed.

Figure 14. Generation of a spiral waves in a model of cardiac tissue by a S1-S2

protocol: An initial perturbation produces a travelling wave (a), second perturbation,

shorty after the passing of the travelling wave (b), generation of a free end (c), evolution

into a rotating spiral wave (d-f). Time between consecutive snapshots 90 ms.

The whole spiral wave rotates around its free-end, or tip. The motion of the tip

determines most properties of the spiral motion, as it has been demonstrated by the

calculation of the response function, which is different than zero only close to the spiral

tip [137, 138]. The dynamics of the tip can change from a circular motion producing

rigidly rotating spiral waves to more complex dynamics, giving rise to meandering spiral

waves, see Sec. 6.1. If the interaction between pulses of the spiral is too strong the spiral

can break and a final chaotic dynamic state of pieces of rotating spirals fills out the whole

system, see Sec. 6.2. Such a state has been proposed to be the responsible of cardiac



CONTENTS 35

fibrillation.

4.1.3. Scroll waves. A scroll wave is the three-dimensional equivalent to a two-

dimensional spiral wave. It can be considered as a stack of spiral waves. The connection

of the tips of these spirals defines a filament, around which the scroll wave rotates. The

dynamics of the whole wave is often dictated by the motion of the filament.

Figure 15. Examples of a scroll wave rotating around the straight filament (a), and

of a scroll ring rotating around a circular filament (b). In the latter case, half of the

waves are not displayed to permit the visualization the filament. Adapted from [75]

with permission of Springer.

There are different types of scroll waves, whose presence in the medium and stability

depends on the initial and boundary conditions. A simple solution in a homogeneous

isotropic medium is a straight scroll wave rotating around the filament (Fig. 15a).

As in the case of two-dimensional spiral waves, the rotation can be rigid or the waves

may perform a meandering motion. Straight rigidly rotating scroll waves move with

the same frequency as in the two-dimensional equivalent. However, the meandering in

three-dimensional systems appears in a broader region of parameters [139], accompanied

with an helical deformation of the initially straight filament, see Sec. 7.1.

The stability of a straight filament is determined by the dependence of filament

tension with curvature. In isotropic media, scroll waves are usually found to be

stable. However, depending on the initial condition, anisotropy or heterogeneities,

the filaments of the scroll waves can be bent. An extreme case of a curved scroll

wave is a scroll ring, where the filament is closed into a ring, see an example in Fig.

15(b). Scroll rings have been extensively studied because their constant radius permits

a convenient measurement of the dependence of the filament dynamics on the local

curvature. Depending on the sign of the filament tension, two main dynamics have

been observed in rings with large radius: either they collapse when filament tension is

positive, which is the usual case, or they expand if the tension is negative. In Sec. 7.3 we

show that the latter case is associated to scroll wave turbulence [93,140]. On the other

hand, small drifting scroll rings can survive without neither collapsing nor expanding,

or several scroll rings can be knotted, resulting in a stable configuration [141].

Sometimes the positions of the tips of the spirals are not aligned along the filament,

but present a shift in the phase of rotation. This effect is due to a twist on the filament.



CONTENTS 36

As with local curvature, scroll waves typically reduce the twist. There are, however,

cases where twist persists, like three-dimensional meandering where some amount of

twist is stable, or initially twisted scroll waves with periodic boundary conditions where

the twist cannot be released, see Sec. 7.2. Twist may also be induced in heterogeneous

systems, see Section 4.2.

Complex and chaotic wave dynamics can be the result of:

• scroll wave turbulence: originated by the destabilization of the filament due to an
instability or to anisotropy.

• scroll breakup: originated by the interaction among the waves forming the scroll.
While the previous mechanism does not have any equivalent in two-dimensional

systems, the mechanism of scroll breakup is basically the same as the equivalent

mechanism in two dimensions, but it has been described to occur in a larger

parameter region of the phase diagram [122].

4.2. Heterogeneous tissue

The description of cardiac tissue as continuous and homogeneous facilitates the modeling

of such a complex problem. However, tissues in living organisms are nonuniform, and the

heart muscle is not an exception. Cardiac tissue is highly heterogeneous, with multiple

sources of inhomogeneity. For example, the whole cardiac vein system has to provide

energy to the heart and therefore frequently crosses the muscle, interacting with the

propagation of electric waves. Furthermore, the properties of the tissue are far from

being homogeneous, presenting physiological gradients and local variations. Finally,

there are different types of cells in the myocardium with different electrical properties

which may produce small-scale heterogeneities.

Particular modeling of the different types of heterogeneities is possible, and some

situations have been extensively studied. However, generic results from qualitative

descriptions, like parametric changes, gradients or non-conducting inclusions, have

helped to interpret some properties of cardiac tissue.

Next we review different types of organization of the inhomogeneities in cardiac

tissue and the most relevant effects in action potential propagation.

4.2.1. Large non-excitable local heterogeneities. Blood vessels supply oxygen and

energy to the myocardium. They form a complex network of pipes with different

sizes [54], introducing large inclusions in the tissue. They are typically modeled as

inert obstacles which do not propagate the electric wave, see an example in Fig. 16(a).

Scars produced by an infarct could be modeled similarly as inclusions. A traveling

wave propagates around the inclusion, however a spiral or scroll wave can pin around

the heterogeneity, typically an artery, and produce an abnormal periodic excitation of

the heart [16]. Paradoxically, the inclusions themselves can generate new waves when

an electric field is applied [142], producing the unpinning of spirals under repetitive

perturbations [143], and, furthermore, eliminating ventricular fibrillation [54, 55]. Such



CONTENTS 37

a method is known as far-field pacing and it is more efficiently than periodically forcing

the tissue from outside, or anti-tachycardia pacing, to unpin spirals [144].

On the other hand, elongated obstacles can produce propagation along them. Such

single large heterogeneity may produce a reentry under adequate conditions [20, 145]

or under high frequency stimulation [146]. The combination of several obstacles may

block in one direction and propagate in the other one, giving rise to the possibility of

anatomical reentry depending on the geometrical properties of the obstacles. Curvature

of the waves reduces the speed of propagation, see Eq. (49), thus, highly curved fronts,

obtained at the exit from small channels, may stall [147,148].

Equivalent to the pinning of the tip of spiral waves, filament of scroll waves can

anchor in three-dimensional systems to small heterogeneities [149].

panel) and the effects on wave propagation in tissue (large color figure) with the

neous and different types of gradients are present and affect wave propagation. For



CONTENTS 38

example, the transmural distribution of cell types is not homogeneous so the cell prop-

erties at the epicardium are different to the properties of the myocytes forming the

endocardium of the heart [150]. A third type of cells, the M-cells are located between

the two previous types. Proximity to ischemic regions may also alter the local properties

of the myocardium and introduce different types of gradients in the tissue.

appearance of reentry with the reexcitation of point a, that finally results in block at

The variations in the action potential duration (APD) corresponding to regional



CONTENTS 39

differences of electrophysiological properties result in dispersion of repolarization. This

has been linked to an increased risk of cardiac death [151] and, in particular, to a higher

risk of arrhythmogenicity in short QT, long QT and Brugada syndromes [152–155]. In

Brugada syndrome, for instance, dispersion of repolarization is thought to be caused by

an abbreviation of the APD of the right ventricular epicardium due to loss of the action

potential dome [156]. Then, a region of depolarized tissue (during calcium current

entrance, or phase-2 of the AP) can re-excite adjacent regions that exhibit shorter

action potential duration (APD) [130], producing an extrasystole which can eventually

initate phase-2 reentry (see Figure 17). This same mechanism has also been proposed to

explain reentry associated to dispersion of repolarization around ischemic regions [157].

Thus, reexcitation due to phase-2 reentry needs two conditions to be met: first, that a

heterogeneous loss of dome is produced in tissue and, second, that the spike-and-dome

regions are able to reexcitate the loss-dome areas. The latter has been shown to occur

due to the propagation of a slow pulse sustained by the inward calcium current, that is

then able to reexcitate adjacent tissue [131].

Linear Gradients. A continuous change on the properties of propagation will cause an

acceleration (deceleration) of the pulse moving in the direction (opposite direction) of

the excitability gradient. It may also modify the vulnerability window and even induce

conduction block [136].

In a two-dimensional slab of tissue a gradient of excitability induces variations in

wave velocity, see Fig. 16(b), and produces the drift of a spiral wave pushed by the

change of the rotation frequency during each period of rotation due to the gradient.

The direction of the drift depends on the model parameters [158]. A gradient in the gap

junction conductances produces similar behavior [159].

A straight scroll wave with the filament parallel to a gradient of excitability produces

the formation of constant twist along the filament [160]. Furthermore, if the scroll wave

is not oriented in the direction of the gradient it turns and tries to align in the same

direction. On the other hand, scroll rings are also affected by gradients and the normal

vector of the filament plane also orientate with the gradient [161].

Step Gradients. Sudden changes on the excitability or in other properties of the

myocytes may substantially affect the dynamics of the waves. A traveling wave

propagating from a region of higher excitability to a region of lower excitability will

change velocity adapting to the local properties of the the tissue. However, in the

opposite direction it may block and do not propagate.

Step gradients produce two different velocities, see Fig. 16(c). Spiral waves located

at the border of two regions with different properties of propagation may be affected if

the core of the spiral rotates crossing this border. The difference of rotating frequencies

produces a directed drift along the boundary between the two regions [162].

A scroll wave oriented perpendicularly to the border between two regions with

different propagation properties will deform. The filament in the region with faster



CONTENTS 40

rotation frequency will maintain its original shape. In the other region, the filament

twists because of the difference in frequency. Thus, to keep the filament connected and

compensate this phase difference twist develops [160].

4.2.3. Localized heterogeneity. The accumulation of different types of cells or the

presence of light infarct areas or scars may result in a localized change in excitability

of a determinate region of the tissue. Apart from the effects of the borders discussed in

the previous section, the shape, size and degree of excitability of the heterogeneity may

be determinant for the propagation properties of the waves. A two-dimensional pulse

crossing a region with different excitability will change locally its velocity and curvature.

If the difference in excitability in this region in comparison with the rest of the medium

is large enough reentry can be produced [163].

One of the most accepted mechanism of reentry formation is the interaction of two

consecutive waves with a large heterogeneity formed by cells with a refractory period

larger than the rest [163–167]. The second pulse stops in the heterogeneity because of

the refractory state produced by the previous wave. It can, however, propagate outside

of the heterogeneity producing a free end which re-enters into the heterogeneity when

the refractory period ends.

4.2.4. Small-scale heterogeneities. Small-scale heterogeneities are inevitable and

omnipresent in cardiac tissues. This is due to the variability of individual cells,

the presence of different cell types as well as the potential inclusion of fibrotic cells

inside otherwise healthy tissue. Another factor is the discrete nature of the tissue

that is composed of myocytes separated by extracellular space filled with interstitial

fluids. As discussed in Section 3.2, homogenization procedures [8] are employed to

derive the bidomain equations of cardiac dynamics based on periodic arrangements of

cells and related periodic variation of medium properties [9, 10]. Often, the bidomain

equations are further reduced to the monodomain equations [11], resulting in a set of

coupled nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations that is the main model type discussed

in this review. A homogenization of reaction-diffusion equations with small-scale

heterogeneities was carried out recently [168, 169] to obtain effective diffusivities resp.

conductivities and effective local excitation kinetics assuming a random structure.

The procedure was validated with simulations in discrete models with randomly

assigned coupling between cells and/or local kinetics with small fraction of non-excitable

elements and/or blocked connections. Homogenization fails badly if such obstacles to

perturbation reach fractions close to percolation. Then, large cluster occur and the

assumption of homogenization regarding a large differences in scales between variation

of local kinetics and spatial coupling on the one hand and the typical interface width of

excitation on the other hand breaks down [168]. As a result, heterogeneities may induce

disruption and subsequent reentry, as has been observed in very schematic models [170],

in simplified ionic models [171], and in more complex models [172]. Homogenization

has also been used to predict effective wave speeds in periodic media [42, 173]. As long



CONTENTS 41

as the excitation front width is larger than the characteristic size of the heterogeneities

the wave speed is approximately constant. Interestingly, intermediate periods of the

heterogeneity length scale may yield conduction block of waves, whereas propagation is

possible at small and large length scales [173].

In contrast to such approximations of spatial homogeneity and/or smooth changes

of parameters in cardiac modeling, cardiac tissue may be modeled not as a continuous

medium but as a discrete interconnected collection of cells, some of which, e. g. the

fibroblasts, are non-excitable, see and example in Fig. 16(d).

Approximately two thirds of the volume of cardiac tissue is formed by myocytes,

the rest of the volume is basically composed by fibroblasts. Since the size of myocytes is

around five times larger than the size of the fibroblasts, the fibroblasts are the largest cell

population by number [174]. One of the main function of fibroblasts is the production

of the proteins forming the extracellular matrix (ECM) which give support to the whole

tissue. An excess production of such proteins leads to fibrosis, which increases the risk

of malfunction in the heart. It has been shown in in vitro experiments that fibroblasts

form gap junctions with myocytes [175] and, therefore, may be electrically active in the

tissue.

The effects of a large fraction of fibroblast in the myocardium and its implications

in the formation of arrhythmias have been recently studied [176]. Although commonly a

heterogeneous description of the tissue was considered in such studies, homogenization

techniques were also employed to create a tridomain model [177], which is an extension

of the bidomain model with an additional third phase representing the fibroblasts.

Nevertheless, fibroblasts are usually included in the modeling of tissue as non-excitable

elements in a discrete version of the cable equation. Because of the smaller size of the

fibroblasts with respect to the myocytes, they are sometimes included in the discrete

lattice as an additional connection to each myocyte [178, 179], or with a smaller size in

models at the sub-cellular scale [180,181].

The effect of fibrosis, details of tissue structure obtained from histology and

other heterogeneities on the cellular level have also been included in a number of

discrete models for cardiac tissue in two and three dimensions [171, 172, 182–189]. The

disconnection among myocytes has been also employed as a model to explain reentry

around the pulmonary vein in the atria [190], which is one of the major causes of atrial

fibrillation [191], and in the formation of ectopic pacemakers [171].

In general the inclusion of randomly distributed non-excitable cells or the

uncoupling of myocites produces a reduction of wave velocity and an increase of spiral

period [192, 193]. It can stabilize spiral waves and preclude their breakup, typically

occurring at rapid rotation frequencies [194]. In all the different models that incorporate

non-excitable tissue, a decrease in the velocity of wave propagation is observed, that

can induce the formation of reentries [171, 190, 194] due to the source-sink mismatch

mechanism [25,195], see a realization of such reentry formation in Fig. 18.

On the other hand, a heterogeneous description of the medium is also particularly

convenient for the modeling of cell cultures. In this case cells grow in vitro, establishing

connections among them. Because of the lack of a solid tissue they form irregular

networks of connected cells. This facilitates the spontaneous generation of spiral

waves [196] where the role of the heterogeneities in the connectivities is crucial [197].

4.2.5. Geometry effects. For the most of this review we discuss propagating structures

independent from specific geometric constraints, distance to boundaries or obstacles to

propagation. In many realistic situations, the geometry of the medium or the shape and

location of boundaries may have an important influence on electrical propagation in

excitable media and specifically in cardiac tissue. Many relevant effects stem from the

fact that geometric constraint cause curvature of the excitation waves. According to Eq.

(49), convex shape (positive curvature) slows down or even blocks wave propagation,

whereas a concave shape (negative curvature) leads to faster wave motion. A situation of



CONTENTS 43

interest is propagation within narrow pathways, where unidirectional block and reentry

were found in simulations [198, 199]. Reflection of fronts and block of excitation pulses

have been observed experimentally in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction [200] and in

catalytic surface reactions [201, 202]. Analogous phenomena have been reported in

parallel for cardiac tissue, see e. g. [148,203]. Theoretical analysis of wave propagation

in channels or pathways with varying diameter has bee carried out based on, e. g.,

conformal mapping [204] and perturbation theory [205].

An interesting phenomena relevant to cardiology, is also the formation of spiral

waves at sharp changes such as corners or sudden extensions in a boundary, which was

observed in experiments and simulations related to the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction

[206] (see Fig. 19) and to the catalytic CO oxidation on a platinum surface [207]. Cabo

et al. pointed out that such a vortex shedding at obstacles to propagation may be

behind formation of spirals in cardiac tissue [145].

Not only spiral initiation but also persistent spiral waves can be affected by

geometries and in particular by boundary effects. This is relevant for rotors in cardiac

tissue, because the spiral wavelength (i.e., distance between two consecutive pulses)

is typically of the same order as the size of the heart. In other words, unlike in

chemical reaction-diffusion systems one will rarely find spirals with many windings.

For a typical example, see the rotating excitation in Fig. 13 above. Theory [208] as well

as experiments and simulations [209] have focused on spirals in circular and spherical

domains. Hartmann et al. report that the spiral frequency increases substantially if

the size of the domains is smaller than half the spiral wavelength in a large domain



CONTENTS 44

and that spirals cannot be sustained for domains smaller than one tenth of the spiral

wavelength in a large domain [209]. Other interesting aspects recently found include

boundary-induced meander [210] as well as the existence of discrete orbits for particular

distances to the boundary [211] as well as changes in the stability of scroll waves near

boundaries [212,213].

4.3. Anisotropic tissue

Anisotropy alone in homogeneous two dimensions, or in thin homogeneous cardiac

tissues, will only produce the deformation of the waves, without inducing any new

instability. In three-dimensional media the shape of filaments of scroll waves adapts to

the fiber anisotropy. In general, it is possible to show that in a 3D reaction-diffusion

system with anisotropy the stationary shape of the filament is a geodesic of a Riemannian

space, whose metric tensor is related to the inverse of the diffusion tensor [214,215]. The

filaments align with the local fiber orientation [216], and they bend and adopt curved

shapes following geodesic metrics [217]. The curvature of such filaments may induce the

formation of twist which may destabilize the scroll waves and produce instabilities [78] or

spiral breakup [73]. Furthermore, abrupt changes of anisotropy may induce oscillatory

dynamics of the filament superposed to the normal rotation of the scroll wave around

the filament [218].

The implementation of relatively complex models in realistic geometries of the

ventricles requires the use of an adequate description of the orientation of the fibers

and the correct values for the anisotropy governing the wave propagation through fiber

directions [219]. They are nowadays implemented in all modern electrophysiological

models of the heart [30]

(APD) in a cell paced at constant stimulation period, exemplifying the phenomenon of

cardiac alternans. The action potential duration (APD) is usually defined as the time

from the steepest increase of the transmembrane potential V to a repolarization of

90 percent. The duration between two consecutive action potentials is called diastolic

interval (DI).

5. Cardiac alternans

Among the cardiac instabilities known to give rise to arrhythmia and fibrillation one

of the most studied is that of cardiac alternans. It was first described under the name

of pulsus alternans by Ludwig Traube in 1872 as the alternation of strong and weak

arterial pulses. Later on it was discovered and studied by Hering in 1908 [220] and Sir

Thomas Lewis in 1911 [221] that this alternation had an electrophysiological origin. It

corresponded to a beat-to-beat change in the duration of the action potential at the

single cell level (Fig. 20), that resulted in beats of weaker and stronger contraction

of the heart. This abnormal electrical activity was recognized as an alteration of the

ECG by Kalter and Schwartz [222] in 1948. Specifically, as a change in the amplitude

or position of the T-wave of the ECG, related to a change in repolarization (see Fig.

3). Since then, the appearance of T-wave alternans has been recognized as a indicator

Figure 21. Schematic illustration of concordant and discordant alternans. The

alternation in the APD can be in phase over all the tissue (concordant alternans)

or create out of phase regions (discordant alternans), separated by a nodal line, where

the value of the APD remains constant at consecutive beats.

of suffering sudden cardiac death (SCD) [223]. Due to this, T-wave alternans has been

proposed as a risk stratifier of SCD. An electrophysiological explanation of this link was

given by Pastore et al [224] that found that, in tissue, action potential alternans could

be either in phase (termed concordant alternans) or out of phase in differents parts of

tissue (discordant alternans), as shown in Figure 21. This latter case was found to be

very proarrhythmic, since it gives rise to dispersion of repolarization that can result in

localized block, and the initiation of reentry and fibrillation. The role of alternans on

spiral stability had been studied previously by A. Karma [84, 225], who showed that

alternans can produce break-up of the waves emitted by a spiral (Fig. 22), due to

localized conduction blocks. At fast pacing rates, the instability reaches the spiral core

and produces a disordered state, where vortices are continuously created and destroyed,

similarly to what is observed during ventricular fibrillation in the heart.

5.1. Dynamics

From a theoretical point of view, alternans at the single cell level were studied using a

cobweb construction (see Figure 23) by Nolasco and Dahlen [226], that also introduced

the concept of AP restitution, i.e., the experimentally observed fact that the action

potential duration (APD) at a given beat depends on the time elapsed between the

end of the previous action potential and the beginning of the current one (known as

diastolic interval, DI). Although more complex effects may appear, resulting in memory

when the APD depends on the past history of the system, this basic map is still the

basis of many studies of alternans. It was in fact used by Guevara et al [227] to show



CONTENTS 47

Figure 23. Cobweb diagram used for the study of alternans. The fixed point is

given by the intersection of the curves APD = f(DI) and T = APD + DI. Under

consecutive iterations it can be stable (a) or give rise to a period-doubled solution (b),

depending on the slope of the restitution curve df/dDI at the fixed point.

that alternans appears as a period doubling bifurcation of the periodic train of APs at

a constant stimulation period.

The basic approach to alternans for a single cell starts from a restitution relationship

APDn+1 = f(DIn) relating the DI at a given beat with the duration of the AP in the

following stimulation, where it is assumed that the action potential duration depends

only on the preceding diastolic interval. Then, we can describe the dynamics of a cell

paced with a constant period T = APDn +DIn by means of a one-dimensional discrete

map

APDn+1 = f(T − APDn). (50)
The pacing period T acts as the bifurcation parameter. A fixed point of this map

corresponds to a sequence of constant action potential durations. Whether the fixed

point is attractive or unstable is determined by the slope the function f(T − APD)
at the fixed point (Fig. 23). The fixed point becomes unstable at a period doubling

bifurcation if the slope of the APD-restitution curve f(DI) exceeds one [226]. This

is known as the restitution hypothesis [228]. However, there is contradictory evidence

regarding its validity [229,230]. In effect, various authors reported severe shortcomings

of the mentioned criteria [231, 232]. More complex dynamics, including the effect of

memory APDn+1 = f(DIn, DIn−1, . . .) result in higher dimensional maps [233–235].

Then, instead of a restitution curve one can talk about a restitution portrait [236, 237]

and the condition for the appearance of alternans is related to the responses of the system

under different stimulation protocols. There is now increasing evidence that often the

failure of the simple restitution curve is due to alternans originating as an instability of

intracellular calcium cycling [230, 238], that is independent of transmembrane voltage

kinetics, as shown in experiments under AP clamp conditions [239,240].

In tissue, the dynamical behavior becomes richer. For a pulse circulating in a ring

(similar to anatomical reentry in which the action potential circulates a nonexcitable

obstacle) the topology of the problem imposes that, once alternans develop, they are



CONTENTS 48

Figure 24. Schematic view of the effect of CV-restitution. A pulse after a long DI at

the pacing point will have a fast conduction velocity, so the stimulation arrives early

to the other end of the cable. The next pulse, by the other hand, will follow a short

DI, and have a slow conduction velocity. This will increase the stimulation period at

one end of the cable with respect to the pacing point, inducing a change in the phase

of oscillation.

always discordant. In effect, the ring geometry imposes periodic boundary conditions

for the APD, i.e., APDn+1(0) = APDn(L). Then, in order for an APD to go from

being long to short at a given point in the ring in two consecutive excitations, the

value of the APD has to change continuously from one value to the other as one moves

along the ring, implying the presence of at least one node. By means of an analysis of

coupled maps, Courtemanche et al [241, 242] showed that the instability to discordant

alternans was a Hopf bifurcation, resulting in quasiperiodic oscillations. This point was

confirmed in an ionic model given by the modified Beeler-Reuter model by Bauer et

al [243], performing an stability analysis of the periodic traveling solution in the ring

using continuation methods (see section 5.2.3).

The original experiments by Pastore et al [224], however, were in a patch of tissue

paced at one point. In that case, the transition from concordant to discordant alternans

was hypothezied to be due to preexisting heterogeneities in tissue. In fact, gradients

of electrophysiological properties can give rise to discordant alternans [244]. However,

numerical simulations of homogeneous tissue [245, 246], showing the transition from

concordant to discordant alternans, showed that heterogeneity was not an essential

factor. Rather, the transition was dynamical. In fact, the key ingredient is that, due to

the dispersion relation (dependency of the speed of the pulse on the diastolic interval),

the local stimulation period varies from point to point in the tissue. This heterogeneity,

dynamically created, is what prompts the transition from concordant to discordant

alternans (see Fig. 24). This point can be understood using a kinematic description to

study the dynamics of alternans (see Section 5.2.1).

5.2. Theory and Methods

Alternans in a one-dimensional geometry, either with periodic boundary conditions (a

pulse circulating in a ring), or in a paced cable, can be studied using a kinematic

description that provides the local values of the pacing period and APD in terms of the

restitution properties of the tissue. This provides a description of the system that is

valid even in the nonlinear regime, so it can be used to study, for instance, conduction

blocks. Close to the onset of alternans it is possible to derive amplitude equations for

the spatio-temporal dynamics of alternans. Even if these equations can be derived from

the kinematic equations, they can also be written down based on general symmetry

properties of the bifurcation to alternans and, therefore, reproduce generic properties

of the dynamics. Besides, one can analyze the bifurcation to alternans through a full

linear stability analysis of the cable equations. For this one can exploit the symmetry

properties of a pulse circulating in a ring. A full linear stability analysis for the paced

case is, at this moment, missing.

5.2.1. Kinematic description of alternans. Let us consider the case of a cable paced at

one end x = 0 with period T0. Then, we characterize the time at which the wavefront

and the waveback pass through a given point of tissue x by:

tf (x) = tf (0) +

∫ x

0

dx′

c(x′)
, (51)

tb(x) = tf (x) + APD(x); (52)

where c(x) is the velocity of the wavefront at position x. Knowing c(x) and APD(x) at

every point in space, then the system is completely determined. From the restitution

curves, we know that these variables will depend on position through the value of the

diastolic interval DI at that point, so c(x) = CV [DI(x)], APD(x) = f [DI(x)]. Besides,

at each point we have that local period of stimulation corresponding to the beat n is

T n(x) = APDn(x) +DIn(x), so

DIn(x) = T n(x)− f [DIn−1(x)], (53)

Eqs. (53)-(54) constitute a closed set of discrete time equations (maps) that can

be used to study the stability of a pulse in tissue. However, there is a missing point

that happens to be crucial, this is, that the restitution curve of a given cell in tissue is

actually affected by electrotonic current coming from neighboring cells. During pulse

propagation, the electrotonic current coming from the left and right neighboring cells

is different, meaning that the change in the restitution curve must break the left-right

symmetry. The easiest way to include this effect is to consider diffusion plus a first

derivative, that breaks this symmetry (for a more rigorous derivation, see [247]). Then

ftissue(DI
n) = fcell(DI

n)− w∂xDIn + ξ2∂2xDIn. (55)



CONTENTS 50

The two spatial derivatives on the r.h.s of this equation originate from the resistive

electrical coupling between cells during repolarization, which tends to smooth out spatial

variations of APD. Both first and second derivative terms are present because action

potentials propagate in the +x direction from the paced end of the cable towards the

opposite end, and this propagation breaks the inherent parity symmetry x → −x that
would be present if, for example, all the cells in the cable were activated simultaneously.

It follows that the coefficient of the first derivative term, which explicitly breaks this

symmetry, must vanish when the conduction velocity is infinite, and all the cells are

effectively activated simultaneously, which implies the scaling w ∼ D/CV . Furthermore,
since the second derivative term originates from the parity symmetric diffusive coupling

in the cable equation, it is sensible to assume that ξ is related to the diffusion length,

i.e., the length over which the membrane potential can diffuse on the characteristic

time scale of repolarization. Recalling that the solution of the one-dimensional diffusion

equation with a boundary fixed at a value V0 is V (x, t) = V0erfc(x/2
√
Dt), then one

obtains that ξ ∼ (D×APD)1/2. For typical parameters of cardiac tissue, ξ is a few mm
and w is even smaller.

Including this effect, and substituting in Eq. (53), the final equation is, therefore:

which provides a mesoscopic description of pulse propagation, that has been useful

in describing conduction blocks [248], the effect of electrophysiological gradients [244],

electromechanical coupling [249], etc.

5.2.2. Amplitude equations. Close to the onset of alternans one can consider a reduced

description of the dynamics, based on amplitude equations [250]. These have been

very successful in examining the dynamics in a multitude of physical systems, such as

convection in fluids, chemical reactions, etc. In the current setting they can be obtained

considering small modulations on top of the period doubling

DIn = DI∗ + (−1)na(x, t), (57)
where the modulation is assumed to depend on a continuous time t = nT0, since the

beat to beat change is small once the rapid changes are factored out with the term

(−1)n. Then, from the second iteration of the map (56) one obtains the equation:

that provides a description of the spatio-temporal evolution of cardiac alternans. The

last term in the equation corresponds to a nonlocal coupling. This appears from the

need to integrate the wavefront speed along a trajectory to obtain the stimulation period

at a given point. In fact, 1/Λ = (2/c2)dc/dDI, so the influence of this nonlocal term is

greater when the CV-restitution curve is steep. It is important to notice that, due to

the presence of this term, a solution a(x, t) = a0, corresponding to concordant alternans

with a constant amplitude, does not satisfy equation (58). In a semi-infinite domain

x ∈ [0,∞), the base state a = 0 always bifurcates to discordant alternans.
Using Eq. (58), in [247,251] it was shown that discordant alternans appears either

in the form of standing waves, with fixed node positions (points at which the oscillation

vanishes, i.e. a = 0), or traveling waves, where the nodes appear periodically at the end

of the cable, and disappear at the pacing point (see Fig. 25). The transition from one to

the other type of solution occurs as the slope of CV-restitution is increased. From the

spectra (Fig. 26) associated to the linearized version of Eq. (58) one can observe that

the traveling waves correspong to modes of the absolute spectrum while the standing

waves correspond to isolated eigenvalues, probably appearing because of the breaking of

translational symmetry due to the pacing point. From the dispersion relation associated

to Eq. (58) it can be estimated that the wavelengths for standing and traveling waves

are given by λ = 2π(wΛ)1/2 and λ = 4π(2ξ2Λ)1/3/
√
3, respectively, with associated

frequencies Ωi = 0, Ωi = (3
√
3/2)(ξ/2Λ)2/3 [247, 251]. The solution with the smaller

wavelength is the one that bifurcates first.

The amplitude equation formalism can be applied to diverse situations, as gradients

of electrophysiological properties [244], anomalous dispersion [252], control of alternans

[253–257], or coupling with intracellular calcium [258,259]. It also provides us with some

insight into another important problem, not jet completely understood: the influence of

alternans on the stability of spiral waves. The distribution in the amplitude of alternans

will determine where conduction block (i.e. the break-up of the waves of the spiral)

occurs. As in the ring geometry, for topological reasons, alternans on top of a spiral

wave always present a nodal line (or an odd number of them), separating regions with

opposite APD alternation. Since, in the far field, the waves emanating from the spiral

asymptote to plane waves, one would expect to obtain a distance between nodal lines

similar to the paced case and, therefore, a spiraling nodal line (see Figure 27). In [260] it

was shown that, depending on parameters, the dynamics of the nodal line is dominated,

either by the core, or by the far field.

A more accurate determination of this transition can be made performing a

have added important contributions to the understanding of cardiac arrhythmias

[11,262]. The latter methods (continuation and stability analysis in 1D) can be applied

to models with modified ion channel kinetics [243]. This allows not only for a fast and

efficient computation of action potential (AP) forms and APD and CV restitution, but

also enables a quick assessment of the changes of the alternans instability with changing

model properties.

One approach along these lines is to compare direct simulations of propagation on

a one-dimensional (1D) ring, where one can take advantage of the translation symmetry

of the problem, and numerical stability analysis in this set-up. We start from the

equations describing a one-dimensional electrophysiological model of the spatial profile

of the transmembrane voltage V (x) and the vector of corresponding spatial profiles of

the gating variables ~w(x):

The stability analysis is based on the continuation of periodic solutions in the above

equation. The stability of pulses or pulse trains in a ring is obtained via the solution

of the linear stability problem by numerical computation of pulse spectra. This yields

not only a much more accurate determination of the onset of alternans than the direct

numerical integration of electrophysiological model equations, but also a numerical test

of the validity of simplified theories like the restitution hypothesis introduced above

for a specific model. In an exemplary study [243], the membrane ionic dynamics

were described by the Beeler-Reuter Drouhard-Roberge model [70,263] for mammalian

ventricular tissue.

The calculations necessary for a numerical bifurcation analysis of propagating action

potentials in the one-dimensional system can be described in two steps. First, one can

calculate the shape and velocity of a traveling pulse in a ring. Second, the stability of

the pulse is investigated. A traveling pulse in a ring which moves with fixed velocity c

and maintains its shape is stationary in a co-moving frame of reference with coordinate

ξ = x − ct. A transformation of the 1D version of Eqs. (59) to this co-moving frame
yields

Traveling wave solutions (V0(ξ), ~w0(ξ)) can be found assuming the condition of

stationary ∂V/∂t = 0, ∂ ~w/∂t = 0, so Eqs. (60) becomes a traveling wave ordinary

differential equation (ODE). This allows to study properties of nonlinear waves by using

well established dynamical systems methods like bifurcation analysis and continuation

[264]. Propagating periodic action potential sequences can be calculated by continuation

software for ODEs [265].

One can perform a linear stability analysis of the traveling pulse (V0(ξ), ~w0(ξ))

[266, 267], by linearizing the co-moving frame reaction-diffusion equations (60) with

respect to small deviations from the steady traveling pulse (δV (ξ, t), δ ~w(ξ, t)). The

separation ansatz

(δV (ξ, t), δ ~w(ξ, t)) = eλt · (Φ(ξ), ~W (ξ)), (61)

The Jacobian matrix J(V0, ~w0)(Φ,

L as elements. The real part of a given eigenvalue λ decides on temporal growth or decay

of a corresponding eigenfunction, compare Eq. (61). We are looking for L−periodic
solutions of the eigenvalue equation (62) with regard to the pulse in a ring. Since one

wants to solve Eq. (62) by continuation, one needs to consider a more general problem

first: For each complex number λ, Eq. (62) represents a second order linear ODE with

periodic coefficients which can be rewritten as a first order ODE. Its general solution is

given by the Floquet theorem. We adjust the complex number λ so that the system (62)

possesses a Floquet multiplier ei2πγ of absolute value one (γ ∈ R), which corresponds to
the existence of a solution of Eq. (62) on the domain (0, L) with boundary condition

Following the methods described above, one can compute profiles and velocities

c of pulses on a ring for different ring lengths L. The resulting dispersion relation

or conduction velocity (CV) restitution curve c(L) shows for large L a plateau (to

be exact, this model presents weak anomalous dispersion, i.e., negative slope [268],

see Fig. 28(a). Anomalous dispersion in the context of cardiac models is known as

supernormal conductivity [40]).

Numerical bifurcation analysis allows us to test the hypothesis regarding the

relation between the onset of alternans and the form of APD-restitution curve. The

family of traveling pulses parameterized by L defines an APD-restitution curve f(DI),

shown in Fig. 28(b). This APD-restitution curve is a well defined function for traveling

pulses but might fail to apply for the dynamics of non-steady states. The onset of

alternans can be determined with the linear stability analysis defined by Eq. (62).

The eigenvalue zero belongs always to the spectrum of the traveling pulse due to the

translation invariance. The traveling pulse is stable if all eigenvalues except λ = 0 are

least one eigenvalue has a positive real part.

imaginary part contains a period 2π/Im(λa) which would be twice the pulse period if the

bifurcation would correspond to a perfect period doubling. The condition for alternans

determines the critical size of the ring Lcrit and the related pulse and conduction velocity

ccrit. The circumferences Lcrit obtained by the continuation method are in line with those

found in numerical simulations. The associated eigenfunctions to λcrita show a broad

amplitude at the back of the pulse [243] indicating the variations of the APD that occur

in alternans. One can evaluate the restitution condition from the results of the numerical

stability analysis, see Fig. 30. Comparing the slope of the APD−restitution curve to
the multiplier eRe[λa(T)]·T one finds for the modified Beeler-Reuter model that the slope

of the restitution curve is 0.85 at the onset of alternans giving a sizable deviation of the

prediction of a slope 1 [226].

The mentioned frequency ratio of two indicates that the solution of the eigenvalue

equation (62) and the resulting spectra reflect the alternans instability. The results for

various choices of parameters governing the ion channel kinetics of the modified Beeler-

Reuter model and the related 1D simulation results regarding alternans are given for

the example studied in [243]. The described methods were also analyze the stability of

pulse trains of two and more action potentials on a ring [252] yielding results in line

with those found earlier for FitzHugh-Nagumo model with anomalous dispersion.

6. Spiral wave dynamics

Rotating excitations (rotors) are often found in cardiac experiments and corresponding

simulations. A special case of two-dimensional rotors are spiral waves, that are discussed

in this section. Their three-dimensional equivalent are scroll waves that will be reviewed

separately in the next section. Spirals can become unstable (spiral breakup), which leads

typically to a state of irregular, chaotic activity. The description of reentry in cardiac

tissue in terms of a rotating wave around an obstacle forming a spiral wave dates back

to a classical paper by Wiener and Rosenblueth in 1946 [269]. Later, it was shown in

chemical media (i.e., in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction [270]) that such rotors

can be autonomous and circulate around an unexcited area referred to as the spiral

core. An obstacle is thus not necessary to sustain spiral waves in excitable media. In

the cardiac literature this latter case is refered to as functional reentry, and contrasted

with anatomical reentry when the spiral wave is anchored to an obstacle and rotates

around a region of heterogeneous tissue. In any of these cases, the rotors impose a

frequency that is much larger than the natural sinus rhythm frequency of the heart

and are therefore widely discussed as building block of ventricular tachycardias and

fibrillation, see e. g. [20]. To exist, sustained rotating spirals need a minimum system

size of 20 percent of the spiral wavelength in an unbounded domain. So one may expect

that rotors are not found in small animals. Recent studies, however, reveal that (stable

and unstable) spirals and the related signature of ventricular fibrillation (VF) appear

even in mice and rats. A comparative analysis of typical VF frequencies νV F in animals

from mice and rats via cats, dogs and pigs to humans and horses displays a characteristic

power law scaling with νV F ∝ BM−1/4, where BM is the body mass [271]. Similarly,
the rotor core diameter R scales with R ∝ BM1/4, while the action potential velocity is
practically constant. In absolute numbers, characteristic fibrillation frequencies decrease

from 38 Hz in mice to 6.8 Hz in humans. Since the extension L of the heart roughly

scales with L ∝ BM1/4, the characteristic ratio of system size L to rotor size R is only
weakly dependent on the size of the animal and apart from the characteristic scaling of

frequencies and lengths comparable rotor dynamics may be observed in many different

species.

Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of spirals in cardiac propagation

were often motivated by the rich variety of experimentally observed spiral dynamics.

Stationary and drifting spirals were discovered, e. g., in slices of ventricular muscle

from dog and sheep [16, 17]. Later on, improved imaging techniques allowed the

visualization of spiral dynamics on the surface of isolated rabbit hearts [135], wherein

nonstationary reentrant spiral dynamics was identified as a mechanism for polymorphic

tachycardia. Optical imaging of electrical activity in isolated, perfused dog hearts

enabled the observation of transiently erupting rotors and frequent wavefront collisions

and wavebreak generation in the early phase of ventricular fibrillation-like activity [272].

In parallel, a method to obtain spatial phase maps (i.e., representation of the dynamical

phase of the local excitations, see Fig.2) was developed that allowed to identify the

multiple spiral tips (i.e., phase singularities), as sources of fibrillatory activity and

rotating, reentrant excitations and to follow their temporal evolution with emphasis

on formation and termination of such rotors [273].

Depending on the dynamics of the tip and the type of wave interaction between

consecutive pulses of the same spiral wave, different types of behavior are observed, see

Fig. 31 for three representative examples:

• Rigidly rotating spiral waves: the tip of the spiral wave rotates rigidly around
a circular unexcited region, the core (Fig. 31(a)). Under some conditions such

dynamics is associated with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia where the ECG

shows a fast characteristic frequency [17]. Two limiting cases can be distinguished:

the large core regime, when the core size is larger than the typical spiral wavelength

and there is not interaction between consecutive pulses, and the small core regime,

where the core size is much smaller than the wavelength [274].

• Meandering spiral waves: the motion of the tip is not circular but it performs
a more complex motion. These spiral waves would produce the appearance of

several frequencies in the ECG and, therefore, they are associated to polymorphic

ventricular tachycardia. In the simplest case two frequencies are combined to

produce epicycloid or hypocycloid dynamics [275]. The appearance of additional

frequencies produces complex spiral motion [276]. In effect, the typical spiral waves

observed in models of cardiac tissue present elongated cores. In these, the tip

follows a relatively large straight motion along the refractory tail of the previous

pulse combined with rapid turns (Fig. 31(b)) [277]. Variation of parameters in

cardiac models yields a variety of meander patterns [74].

• Spiral break-up: the interaction between pulses can produce the breaking of the
spiral in different pieces that automatically rotate and produce new spiral waves.

Then, the new spirals break again, producing a cascade effect (Fig. 31(c)). A final

chaotic dynamic state of pieces of rotating spirals fills out the whole system [91,278].

Such a state has been proposed to underlie ventricular and atrial fibrillation [80,279].



CONTENTS 59

6.1. Meandering

The term meandering spiral waves was firstly used by Winfree in the description of

chemical spirals in the BZ reaction [280]. In this, the rotation of some spiral tips is

not rigid but a cycloid motion resulting from the combination of two frequencies and

giving rise to a flower-like dynamics, see Fig. 32. Such experimental results were

posteriorly explained by numerical simulations in different simple reaction-diffusion

models [132,281,282], which were able to define the tip of the spiral and to calculate its

trajectory.

The meandering motion of the spiral waves appears due to the interaction of

the wavefront with the refractory tail of the previous excitation. Therefore, it can

be interpreted as a time-delay feedback in the active medium [283]. The analysis of

the dynamics of spiral meandering revealed that it appears through an oscillatory,

Hopf bifurcation. This was first demonstrated numerically by Barkley, Kness and

Tuckerman [86]. At the same time, Karma [284] showed that meander occurs via a

Hopf bifurcation of circularly rotating spiral-wave solutions when the excitability of

the model is sufficiently high. A complete stability analysis of the spiral wave solution

has been performed in a simple reaction-diffusion model, identifying the eigenvalues

and the unstable modes corresponding to the Hopf bifurcation [285]. The ensuing

dynamics has been studied using a reduction of the whole reaction-diffusion system

to a low-dimensional model in terms of a normal form analysis, that captures the

interaction between the original rotating state and the new modes appearing at the

Hopf bifurcation [286,287].

Meandering spiral waves are commonly observed in simple and complex models of

cardiac tissue. Close to the bifurcation three cases can be distinguished depending on

the motion of the tip: inward and outward meandering, and drift. Depending on the

relation between the characteristic rotation frequency of the spiral and the frequency of

the Hopf bifurcation, epicycloid (Fig. 32(b)) and hypocycloid (Fig. 32(d)) dynamics can

be observed, which produce meandering with inward and outward petals, respectively.

In the case of resonance between the two frequencies, a linear drift is obtained, see Fig.

32(c).

Far from the bifurcation threshold, cardiac models usually present complex

meandering motion, as meandering with linear cores [288], a combination of a fast half

rotation with a slow linear motion along the refractory tail [289], or hypermeander [276],

a randomly motion associated to highly meander spiral waves.

Associated with meander (or hypermeander) is the Doppler effect, by which the

wavelength of the spiral shortens ahead of the tip in the direction of its movement and

enlarges in the opposite direction. When this effect is large it can give rise to spiral

breakup [91,290]. Even if it is stable, it results in complex dynamics, that in the ECG is

manifested as polymorphic VT, sometimes indistinguishable from those obtained during

VF [122].

6.2. Spiral breakup

An important motivation for the study of excitable media has been the quest for the

cause of irregular high-frequency electrical activity in cardiac muscle typically observed

during ventricular and atrial fibrillation [15]. The reason for the onset of ventricular

fibrillation as well as possible treatments remain subjects of intense experimental and

theoretical research [291]. Early experiments in thin sheets of heart tissue displayed

only stable spirals in contrast with the irregular activity seen in experiments with whole

hearts [17]. In addition, it was argued that hearts with small mass and, in particular,

small wall thicknesses do not support irregular spiral turbulence-like electrical dynamics.

Consequently, A. T. Winfree suggested that irregular activity in the heart might be a

genuinely 3D phenomenon [121]. Thus realistic three-dimensional, anisotropic models

of the heart and excitable media have been investigated and revealed various sources

of irregular activity on the surface including intricate dynamics of scroll waves [78,292]

and the analogue of breakup in three dimensions [293, 294], for further elaboration on

complex 3D dynamics, see Section 7. In parallel, the phenomenon of spiral breakup has

emerged as a candidate mechanism for ventricular and atrial fibrillation and shall be

reviewed in this section.

In reaction-diffusion media, three fundamentally different mechanisms of spiral

breakup have been observed:

• Lateral instabilities, observed in chemical reaction-diffusion equations, spirals can
break because the waves emitted from the spiral’s centre (core) are destabilized by

transverse perturbations that appear only for fast inhibitor diffusion [295–298], but

this mechanism is not relevant for electrophysiological models. Zykov et al. showed

that inhibitor diffusion is needed to obtain instability of transversal modes [298].

In contrast, cardiac models have diffusion only in the activator variable, i.e. spatial

coupling is provided exclusively by the coupling of transmembrane potential, while

diffusion of ions is absent or can be neglected on the scale of the tissue.

• Radial instabilities, observed in cardiac models, typically unstable modes in the
radial direction [71, 84, 91, 225, 241, 242, 278, 279, 299–301] cause spiral instability

and possibly breakup. If, instead, transversal modes would be the main cause

of spiral instability and breakup, excitation waves should display corrugations as

seen in models with fast inhibitor diffusion, see e.g. the images displayed in the

corresponding references [295–298].

• Meandering-induced instabilities, this possibility can arise from the destabilization
of the core’s location through meandering [285, 286, 302] that was described above

in Section 6.1.

In what follows, we shall concentrate mostly on destabilization against modes in the

radial direction, since these are the most relevant ones for cardiac dynamics exhibiting

spiral breakup. Strong spiral meandering stemming from an instability of the spiral core

can, however, enhance these instabilities since it effectively corresponds to a moving wave

source, where a nonlinear Doppler effect leads to modulation of the wavelength, for a

detailed discussion see [91, 303].

It is crucial to note that in all examples of radial spiral breakup in reaction-

diffusion models and related experiments two different scenarios are observed: spirals

may break first close to their core or alternatively far away from the core [301], see

Fig. 33. The core breakup in Fig. 33(a) is accompanied by a meander instability, which

introduces a Doppler effect into the waves emitted from the spiral core. Breakup near

the core is found in simulations in excitable media [84, 91, 278] and in experiments

with a chemical reaction [290], whereas breakup far away from the core is typically

seen under oscillatory conditions both in chemical experiments [305] and in simulations

of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) [306, 307]. Interestingly, core and

far-field breakup occurs also in a 1D set-up, where the spiral core is mimicked by

a suitable Dirichlet boundary condition (see Fig. 34). It was found [301, 304] in

simulation of the Bär-Eiswirth model of Eqs. (41) that using the values of u and v

of an additional unstable focus in the local dynamics of this model (for details see [304])

selects wavelength and frequencies similar to the ones found in 2D spirals in simulations

of the same model. At the same time the effect of meandering on the radially outgoing

wavetrain is absent. The emergence of breakup like dynamics in the 1D setup (see

Fig. 33b,d) shows that meandering may not be necessary to obtain core-breakup. This

stipulation has been verified in 2D simulations of spirals and spiral break-up presented

in [308].

To summarize, one can distinguish four distinct phenomenologies of spiral breakup:

• Far-field breakup without meandering as seen in Fig.33(b), the CGLE and
the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, typically associated with long-wavelength

modulation caused by the Eckhaus instability.

• Core breakup without meandering as reported in the Bär-Eiswirth model by
Sandstede and Scheel [308].

• Far-field breakup with meandering as seen in chemical experiments by Zhou and
Ouyang [309, 310], in simulations of calcium waves by Falcke et al [311]. For a

theoretical analysis, see the work of Brusch et al [303].

• Core breakup with meandering as seen in Fig. 33(a), in many cardiac models



CONTENTS 63

[84, 279, 292] and in experiments with the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction [310].

This route is often termed Doppler-induced instability.

For models of cardiac tissue, usually core-breakup and strong meandering of the

spiral core is observed [279].

7. Scroll wave dynamics

In the ventricles, one has to take into account that the wall thickness is not negligible,

making the tissue fully three-dimensional. The natural extension of spiral waves in two

dimensions corresponds to scroll waves in three dimensions.

Straight scroll waves may rotate with constant frequency. However, under certain

conditions the filament of the scroll is not straight but takes a helical shape under

meandering, see Section 7.1, or when an external twist is imposed, see Section 7.2; or it

may produce complex unstable dynamics if the tension of the filament is negative, see

Section 7.3. Finally, the breakup of spiral and of scroll waves are discussed in Section

7.4.

7.1. Meandering

The natural extension of two-dimensional meandering to more realistic three-

dimensional tissue is the meandering of scroll waves [312]. The first explicit simulations

of scroll meandering were obtained with simple models and its dynamics employed to

explain relevant properties of the ECG under arrhythmic conditions [135].

In the first numerical simulations an equivalent behavior to two-dimensional

meandering was assumed. However, it was observed that scroll curvature modifies the

meander Hopf instability, resulting in a short wavelength instability that saturates.

Then, one obtains helicoidal meandering scrolls [313] because the meandering of the

filament of the scroll wave promotes the bending of the filament [73].

The linear stability analysis of scroll waves shows that the branch of meander modes

can become unstable for finite wavelength perturbations along the filament, see Sec.

8.2.2, even if it is stable in two dimensions, so three-dimensional effects make the scroll

unstable where the spiral was stable [139,314]. The final nonlinear state depends on the

boundary conditions, so the amplitude of meander is constant along the direction of the

filament z for periodic boundary conditions, but varies with z for non-flux boundary

conditions.

Spiral meander in the presence of an external field can be studied using a normal

form model [315], which can also be applied to a scroll wave, with filament curvature

taking the place of the external field. This improves previous models [313] by considering

the effect of scroll curvature both in the motion of the instantaneous filament and in

the amplitude of the meander modes and explains the difference in curvature between

the translation and meander modes.

Apart from the quasi two-dimensional periodic meander, complex aperiodic

meander has also been described [316], which presents buckling of the scroll wave, an

instability typically associated to negative filament tension, see Sec.7.3.2.



CONTENTS 65

7.2. Sproing

Three dimensional waves rotate around the center filament. If, moving along the

filament, there is a rotation resulting in a shift in the position of the wavefronts, then

one talks about twisted scroll waves. Such rotation produces a change in the frequency

of the rotors in each plane perpendicular to the scroll filament.

A twisted filament in a homogeneous system relaxes to an untwisted configuration

[317]. However, there are several cases where twist can be imposed in the filaments,

which may result in their destabilization:

Figure 35. Experimental observation of sproing instability in the Belousov-

Zhabotinsky reaction in an vertical oxygen gradient and simulations of (b) twisted

scroll wave and (c) scroll breakup due to sproing in the Barkley model with a vertical

gradient in excitability and zero-flux boundary conditions. Shown are surfaces of

constant chemical concentrations, for more information see [318].

• Periodic boundary conditions: Straight scroll waves connecting two boundaries
with periodic boundary conditions cannot eliminate the twist due to topological

restrictions. It produces scroll waves with an integer number of rotations which

depending on the total length of the system determines the twist of the filament.

The twist can be controlled changing the number of rotations or the total length.

Such condition is very useful for the realization of numerical simulations [319] and

the analytic study [139] but unrealistic for comparison with experiments.

• Heterogeneous system: A change in the value of the excitability along the direction
of the straight filament produces a change in the rotation frequency. For instance,

if there is a constant gradient of excitability along the filament twist then forms

homogeneously along this direction [160]. A step change in excitability produces

twist in the slower part of the medium [160, 320]. More complex heterogeneities

would change the local excitability of the medium and change the rotation frequency

around the filament, inducing a distribution of twist (see Fig. 35).

• Diffusion anisotropy: If the scroll filament is aligned with the direction of
transmural rotational anisotropy twist is induced along the filament [73,78,321,322].

In any of these cases, for small values of twist τ , the filament evolves to a straight

twisted filament. However, if twist increases above a critical value (τ > τc), the straight



CONTENTS 66

filament becomes unstable giving rise to a helical shape of the filament [139], in an

instability known as sproing. The radius of the helix grows as the square root of the

difference between the actual twist value and the critical value (
√
τ − τc), which suggests

that it corresponds to a supercitical Hopf bifurcation.

7.3. Negative line tension

Even if the scroll filaments are just convenient mathematical entities, their dynamics

permits to assign them physical magnitudes like tension. The first reference to the

concept of filament tension of scroll waves is due to Yakushevich [323].

The first three-dimensional numerical simulations showed the dynamics of scroll

waves with positive filament tension: straight filaments are stable while scroll rings

shrink and disappear [324]. Then, numerical simulations were done showing not

only shrink of scroll rings but also expansion [92]. Almost simultaneously, the first

interpretations in terms of kinematic theory already predicted the existence of expanding

scroll rings [325], implying that a straight scroll wave had to be also unstable.

The first clear numerical simulations of negative filament tension where done by

Biktashev et al and the instability explained in terms of negative filament tension using

a perturbation theory [93]. Recently, Dierckx et al [326] have calculated higher orders

in the perturbation theory in generic models of excitable media.

Numerically, the full turbulent dynamics was studied some years later [140] and its

possible appearance in ionic models of cardiac tissue was also discussed [75], where it is

related to reduced conductances of sodium and slow inward currents. These low values

are typically employed to model ischemic conditions of cardiac tissue [126].

Further understanding of this instability was obtained when, using a complete linear

stability analysis of the scroll wave solution in a simple reaction-diffusion model, the

unstable mode corresponding to the negative filament instability was identified as a

translational mode, related to rigid body displacements in the direction perpendicular

to the filament [314].

In simple models positive tension occurs for a medium with high excitability,

i.e. a low excitation threshold, while negative tension occurs typically in media with

low excitability [40, 140, 325]. However, more elaborate models show a region of the

parameter space where scroll rings can slowly expand even if the medium is highly

excitable [327], although turbulent dynamics was not observed in such simulations.

Besides a change in the parameters of the model, the excitability of the medium can also

be decreased replacing the partial differential equations by a discrete model, resulting

in a change of filament tension when discreteness is increased [192].

The most detailed study of the onset of negative filament tension has been

performed in the Barkley model Eqs. (40) [139,140,328]. In a large region of parameters

Eqs. (40) produce stable scroll waves with positive tension and without any scroll

breakup, see Fig. 36. Negative filament tension appears inside a broad region of

parameters and closer to the non-excitable condition, where free edges retract, see

positive and negative tension, are compatible with meandering.

Scroll waves with negative filament tension have been recently found in three-

dimensional chemical BZ reaction [329, 330]. However, they have not been observed

in experiments in cardiac tissue, so the relevance of this instability for the induction of

fibrillation is disputed.

CONTENTS 68

filament is the same and all spatial derivatives in the third direction parallel to the

filament are zero. The first essential 3D effects occur when one considers either curved

of twisted filaments. An ideal object to study the effect of curvature is a scroll ring

that contains a circular filament, with constant curvature. The filament dynamics of

scroll rings was studied in [92, 324, 331], showing that the rotation of a scroll ring is

non-stationary, see Fig. 37. The position of its filament is not stable but drifts in space,

with drift velocities proportional to the filament curvature:

cn = −Dnκ, cb = Dbκ; (65)
where cn and cb are drift velocities in the normal (horizontal in Fig. 37) and binormal

(vertical) directions, Dn and Db are proportionality coefficients, and κ is the filament

curvature. For scroll rings κ is equal to R−1, where R is the radius of the ring, so Eqs.

(65) take the simple form:

Ṙ = −
Dn
R

, Ż =
Db
R

. (66)

Based on the sign of the normal component of the velocity two regimes of the scroll

ring are distinguished. The first regime with positive Dn corresponds to a contraction

of the scroll ring [324], see Fig. 37(a). When the ring filament reaches a critical radius,

collapse of the scroll ring occurs. The second regime with Dn < 0 is the scroll ring

extension [92] shown in Fig. 37(b). Under such conditions the radius of the scroll ring

increases proportionally to its curvature. Expansion and collapse of scroll rings are

typically accompanied by a vertical drift, see Fig. 37.

7.3.2. Buckling of scroll waves. Filament contraction decreases the filament length and

thus is associated with positive line tension, while extension of the filament corresponds

to the case of negative tension. A filament with positive line tension will either collapse

(e.g. for the case of a scroll ring) or will attain a stable shape with the minimal possible

length (e.g. for a straight scroll). Thus, an initially perturbed straight filament will

recover the stable straight configuration. By the contrary, a filament with negative

tension tends to increase its length. The instability due to negative filament tension and

the resulting turbulence is a purely three-dimensional effect. For the same parameter

values spiral waves are stable in two dimensions. It follows that there is a minimal

thickness of the three-dimensional wall below which the effects of negative filament

tension disappear. In Fig. 38 we show the results of some numerical simulations with the

same parameter values but for different vertical thicknesses. When the tissue becomes

very thin, the instability does not develop and the scroll wave rotates in a similar

fashion as a spiral wave in two-dimensional media, see Fig. 38(a). For intermediate

thickness the filament is unstable, however the length of the filament saturates. The

filament bends and undergoes a complex meandering motion without breaking up, see

Fig. 38(b). Such dynamics is known as buckling of scroll waves and produces buckled,

precessing filaments, where the negative filament tension instability is arrested by the

horizontal boundaries. The study of this bifurcation shows a critical thickness to obtain



CONTENTS 69

a finite, saturated, buckling amplitude [332]. For thick three-dimensional tissue the

negative tension instability develops, see Fig. 38(c), giving rise to a turbulent state.

7.3.3. Turbulence of scroll waves. In large systems, filaments with negative filament

tension grow, creating loops. Then, if the filament touches a boundary, this results in the

filament breaking into two pieces, leading to filament multiplication [40,56,93,140]. This

regime has received different names from different authors, e.g. autowave turbulence

[333], scroll wave turbulence [334] or Winfree turbulence [140].

An example of turbulent dynamics is shown in Fig. 39. First, a scroll wave rotates

around its straight filament. As time goes on, transverse deformations in the filament

develop (Fig. 39(a-b)). The length of the filament rapidly increases because it loops

out and forms an irregular expanding tangle. The tangle initially still consists of a

single connected filament until the moment it touches a boundary plane. After that,

the filament gets fragmented into many pieces (Fig. 39(c)) that fill the medium and the

resulting waves exhibit a turbulent appearance (Fig. 39(d)).

Upon onset of the instability the total length of the filament increases exponentially

with time. The total length saturates when the outflow of filament through the

boundaries is compensated by the increase of filament length generated by the instability

[328]. The turbulent dynamics frequently presents an intermittent behavior between

complex turbulence and a relatively organized state [334]. This occurs due to the

stabilizing effect of filament interaction; filaments tend to bunch in groups of three

or more filaments [334]. These filament bundles push the remaining individual pieces

of filament outside the medium, and thereby counteract the effects of negative filament

tension. This effect is associated with parameters for which formation of multi-armed

spiral waves in two spatial dimensions is found, which typically occurs at low excitability

conditions [335].

7.4. Characterization of electrical turbulence.

An important issue is the quantitative characterization of the turbulent fibrillation

dynamics in experiments and corresponding simulations. Since formation of a spiral

or scroll due to reentry of electrical activity and subsequent breakup of this initial

rotor is believed to be the most likely mechanism for fibrillation, we focus here on

the characterization of irregular activity states in models and experiments exhibiting

spiral breakup. Electrical turbulence in general can be classified as spatiotemporal

chaos [336]. Indications for spatiotemporal chaos are spatial correlations that decay

on scales much smaller than the system size, short temporal correlation, many positive

Lyapunov exponents, and an extensive scaling of the attractor dimension (Kaplan-Yorke

dimension) estimated from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents with the system size

(= area in 2D or volume in 3D). The computation of Lyapunov exponents is technically

quite involved and has therefore not been carried out for realistic electrophysiological

models. To our knowledge, the only example where the extensive scaling of the attractor

dimension has been shown numerically for an excitable model with a turbulent dynamics

stemming from spiral breakup is the work of Strain and Greenside on the Bär-Eiswirth

model [337]. An alternative approach to characterize spatio-temporal spiral chaos on

the basis of coherent structures was recently suggested by Byrne et al. [338].

A second approach builds on the phenomenological classification of electrical

turbulence in excitable media as defect-mediated turbulence. Defect-mediated

turbulence refers to a state where new defects are created in pairs of opposite topological

charge and existing defects are annihilated if they collide with defects of opposite

topological charge. The sign of the topological charge at the center of a spiral or a spiral

fragment characterizes its sense of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise). The term

was introduced originally for spatiotemporal chaos in the complex Ginzburg-Landau

equation by Coullet et al. [340]. An illustration of defect-mediated turbulence resulting

from spiral breakup in an excitable medium in 2D simulations is given in the top row

of Fig. 40, where topological defects are marked by black and red circles. Gil et al.

developed a simple theory for the defect statistics in defect-mediated turbulence by

assuming a constant creation rate of defect pairs in competition with an annihilation

rate proportional to the square of the defect number in the medium [341]. As a result,

the defect number fluctuates in time according to a Poisson distribution and the variance

of the defect number was predicted to be equal to its temporal mean [341]. Studies of

the defect-statistics in the Bär-Eiswirth model [342, 343] revealed that spiral breakup

leads to an initial fast transient increase of the defect number, but shows substantial

deviations from the prediction of the model by Gil et al. In particular, the variance

close to the breakup instability is much smaller than the mean, which is due to a

strong anticorrelation between topological defects reminiscent of the spatial correlation

of particles in a liquid. Further away from the breakup instability spatial correlations

are much weaker and the defect statistics are in line with the prediction of the simple

theory by Gil et al. [341].

Recent studies by Davidsen and coworkers have focused on the similarities

and differences between defect statistics in 2D and filament statistics in 3D. For

filament-induced turbulence emerging from a three-dimensional filament instability, they

analyzed the statistics of defects (spirals) on the surface of their 3D simulation volume

and found that the creation and annihilation rates of the surface defects follow essentially

a linear dependence on the defect number in the medium with a constant offset [346]

in contrast to 2D defect-mediated turbulence described above. This offers a possibility

to determine the essential mechanism of electrical turbulence from experimental data

on phase singularities. In a more recent study, the effect of the third dimension on the

defect statistics in a system with genuine 2D spiral breakup instability was investigated

showing no crucial differences in the defect statistics stemming from the dimension [339].

Defect statistics altogether offer an interesting and sufficiently simple tool to analyze

electrical turbulence in the heart or in tissue cultures. TenTusscher, Panfilov and

colleagues have indeed investigated the ”organization” of ventricular fibrillation in the

human heart both for realistic cardiac simulations [345] and for experimental data

recorded in patients during heart surgery [344]. Their results are illustrated in Fig.

41, which shows a statistics roughly in line with the mean = variance prediction of Gil

et al. [341]. The analysis of defect-statistics on the epicardial surface provides a useful

tool to characterize electrical turbulence and evaluate the accuracy of predictions from



CONTENTS 73

computational models with experimental data. A recent application, e.g., compares

defect statistics and other metrics from homogeneous and heterogeneous models [347]

and concludes that the influence of transmural and apicobasical electrophysiological

heterogeneity in electrical turbulence is negligible and may, hence, be discarded in

models. These heterogeneities were included by assigning different electrophysiological

parameters to epicardial, midmyocardial and endocardial cell layers in [347].

8. Theory and methods for spiral and scroll wave instabilities

After the phenomenological description of the different instabilities affecting rotors in

cardiac tissue presented in the previous two sections, we survey in this section theoretical

approaches and numerical methods to study and analyze the instabilities responsible of

complex dynamics in excitable media and cardiac models.

8.1. Kinematic description

In many situations a spiral or scroll wave can be considered as a rigid body, and its

motion reduced to the motion of its tip (for a spiral) or its instantaneous or central

filament (for a scroll). This is particularly valid in the limit of weak excitability,

where this procedure can be performed rigorously using perturbation methods [348–350].

Cardiac tissue, under normal conditions, is highly excitable, so the kinematics equations

in this case have to be considered as a phenomenological description of the motion of

the spiral (or scroll) wave. Still, such a description has helped to understand important

phenomena, as the origin of meander [351], the drift of spirals under an external

field [352–354], or the influence of a periodic forcing [355]. This knowledge has helped

to devise possible methods for defibrillation using low intensity electrical fields [356].

8.1.1. Spiral waves. This phenomenological approach starts by reducing the dynamics

of a spiral wave to the motion of its tip [283,357]. In a Cartesian coordinate frame such

equations are written as

dX

dt
= −c sinα− g cosα,

dY

dt
= c cosα− g sinα; (67)

where X and Y are the tip coordinates, α its angular variable, and c and g denote,

respectively, the normal and tangential (respective to the spiral curve) tip velocities,

see Fig. 42. These two velocities depend on curvature effects, parametrized by the

instantaneous wavefront curvature at the tip, denoted κ, and are expressed by the

eikonal equation for the normal velocity, and an analogous description for the tangential

velocity:

c = c0 −Dκ, g = g0 − γκ; (68)
in terms of the set of basic kinematic parameters c0 , g0 , D, and γ. In the limit of weak

excitability the curvature correction to the normal velocity can be assumed negligible

(Dκ ≪ c0), so that c reduces to c0.
The particular solution corresponding to a rigid rotating spiral is recovered by

setting α = ω0t and taking g = 0, which gives a critical curvature κc = g0/γ. From the

calculation of the curvature of a spiral wave rotating around an obstacle of radius R0, one

obtains κc = (c0/ξ
2DR20)

1/3 [283], resulting from the limit of Wiener and Rosenblueth

approach of spiral waves [269], with ξ being a numerical constant. Thus, the natural

frequency of the rotating spiral is [283]

Figure 42. Sketch of the spiral wave motion. Wave corresponds to a snapshot of a

rotating spiral wave in a generic model of excitable medium. The coordinates of the

tip are x and y around the center of the core of the spiral, shown with a blue solid line.

It is also shown the angular rotation of the tip around the core α, and the normal c

and tangential g velocities of the tip, with respect of the wave front, giving rise to the

final rotating motion.

In general, to obtain solutions for quasi-rigid rotating spirals, one needs to supplement

Eqs. (67) with appropriate equations for the angle α and the curvature at the tip κ,

both being assumed to be time-dependent quantities:

dκ

dt
=

γω0
D

(κc − κ),
dα

dt
= ω0 + γ(κc − κ)κ (70)

whereD/(γω0) is the characteristic relaxation time of a perturbation in the tip curvature

to the rigid rotating spiral solution. Note that if D/γ ≫ 1 this time is larger than the
rotation period. The change in the curvature of the tip modifies the tangential velocity

and, therefore, the frequency of rotation.

The effect of the interaction between consecutive pulses can be incorporated into

the kinematic description by considering the dependence of the normal and tangential

velocities of the tip c0(T ) and g0(T ), on T , which is the rotation period for the rigid

rotating spiral. This gives rise to a time-delay feedback. While for large T one recovers

the usual rigid rotation description, Eqs. (67), since c0(T ) → c0 and g0(T ) → g0 in this
limit; at rotation periods of the order of the recovery time, the velocities are modified:

c = c0(T )−Dκ, g = g0(T )− γκ; (71)
where T is a spatially distributed function T = T (x, y, t) of the previous wave. For the

numerical calculation of the trajectories the whole wavefront has to be calculated, and

it can be used for the study of the meandering of spiral waves, see [283].

In the limit of a weakly excitable medium (or large core limit) it is possible to study

the onset of the meander instability by means of an asymptotic analysis [351, 358]. In

this, a relation between the instantaneous radius of rotation Ri and the normal velocity

of the wave with respect of the wave front at the tip c can be obtained, given by

Ri = (D/c0)(b/(1 − c/c0))3/2, being D the diffusion constant, c0 the speed of a planar



CONTENTS 76

front, and b a numerical constant [351,358]. Provided that c is known, then this sufficies

to determine the motion and stability of the tip. In the case of meander, it was shown

that the tip velocity c depends on the motion of the previous pulse due to the interaction

of the wave front with its own recovery tail. Assuming a perturbation of the form:

p = [R0 + q(t)] exp(iθ), with p the position of the tip in the complex plane and R0 the

radius of the circular core, it was shown that the radial perturbation satisfies a delay

differential equation, given by [358]:

d2q

dθ2
+ ω2q = ω2mF [q(t)− q(t− T0)], (72)

being T0 the spiral period, m a parameter that depends on the properties of the medium

and F a tanh-shaped function that can be calculated through asymptotics. A stability

analysis of this equation shows that when the parameter m exceeds a certain threshold

meander appears with a frequency ωH that is half the frequency of the spiral. Thus,

in this limit, meander is perfectly periodic. Calculations for smaller cores, show that

as one leaves the large core limit the ratio becomes smaller that 1/2 and the motion

becomes quasi-periodic, as is observed in numerical simulations [358].

8.1.2. Scroll wave rings. In a three-dimensional system, a scroll wave is approximated

by an oriented traveling surface with an open edge corresponding to the filament [359].

Each element of the surface moves with a velocity proportional to the mean curvature

H, i.e., the average of the principal curvatures, of the surface: c = c0 − 2DH. The
motion of the free edge of the surface depends on the mean curvature near the edge

(H0) and on the geodetic curvature κ of the edge line itself, and it grows (g > 0) or

contracts (g < 0) with a velocity g = g0 − 2γH0 − γ′κ, where g is the extension of the
transversal velocity defined in Eqs. (68). The five kinematic parameters describing the

evolution of a scroll wave (c0, g0, D, γ and γ
′) can be determined from the particular

reaction-diffusion model [283].

The motion of the waves follows the dynamics of the free edge corresponding to

the filament and, therefore, a quasi-steady approximation can be applied [283]. For

the particular case of scroll rings the geodetic and mean curvatures can be expressed

in terms of the angle of rotation around the filament α and the radius R of the scroll

ring: κ = −R−1 cos(α) and H0 = (κ− R−1 sin(α))/2. As a result a set of four ordinary
differential equations for the position of the free edge in cylindrical coordinates can be

derived for the case of scroll rings with large radius [325,359]:

where where ω0 corresponds to the rotation frequency of a spiral wave in two dimensions,

ρ is the radial component and z the vertical position of the free edge, its local curvature

(κ) and the angle of rotation (α), see a schematic representation in Fig.43. At first order

in R−1, and after the integration over one period of rotation, the dynamics of a scroll

ring becomes [325,360]:

Depending on the value of the parameters the filament tension can change the sign. The

decrease of g0 in Eq. (75) may change the sign ofDn to negative values if g0 is sufficiently

small. Scroll waves in the kinematic approach can be formed only if g0 > 0. If g0 < 0 no

steadily rotating scroll waves can form and the tip contracts in the course of time. Thus,

decreasing the value of g0 is equivalent to a reduction of the excitability and it means

that filament tension becomes negative under conditions of weak excitability [360].

that a scroll wave can be constructed by placing 2D spirals along a line (filament) slowly

varying in space. A periodic rigidly rotating spiral wave satisfies V = V (r, θ − ωt). For
the scroll wave, one can represent the three-dimensional space in the neighborhood of

the filament using the coordinate representation R+ pN+ qB, given by:

whereR is the position of the filament, T is the tangent vector, N and B the normal and

binormal unit vectors, s the arclength, κ the curvature and τg the torsion of the filament.

Then, the filament dynamics is represented by coordinates along its length s and in

normal p and binormal q directions yielding to V (s, p, q, t) = V0(r, θ+φ(s, t)−ωt)+V1+...,
(where r and θ are the polar coordinates in the plane p, q) [361].

Starting from the straight, untwisted scroll wave, one can obtain the motion of the

mean filament and the equation for twist, making an expansion in terms of curvature

and torsion, and projecting over the adjoints translational and rotational marginal

eigenmodes (also known as response functions, see [137, 138]). At lowest order this

results in the equations [93, 361]:

In the case of an untwisted scroll ring, κ = R−1, and the former equations become

simply [93]:

, (81)

where Ṙ and Ż are, respectively, the velocities of the filament in the normal and binormal

directions. The parameters Dn = b2 and Db = c3 can be obtained by calculating the

adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearization around a stable rotating scroll wave [361].

As in the previous section the theory predicts a linear dependence of the radius of the

scroll ring on the curvature. Note, however, that the finding of the adjoint solution is

not trivial and it has to be obtained using numerical methods [138].

The ribbon model (78)-(80) developed by Keener can be extended also to the case

of twist induced instabilities. Defining p(σ, t), the unit vector pointing orthogonally

from the center filament to the line of instantaneous scroll wave tips, the scroll wave

twist can be defined as τ = (p× ∂sp) ·T. Then, a phenomenological extension of Eqs.
(78)-(80) for a twisted scroll wave was developed in [160] (a more rigorous derivation

can be found in [326]), giving

that corresponds to the conversion of twist into writhe. To completely characterize the

problem, one has to write down the dependence of scroll frequency ω on twist. Keeping

the first twist corrections to the un-twisted scroll frequency:

w +D∂sτ + (T · ∂tR)τ (84)

Eqs. (83), (84) are equivalent to Keener’s phase equation (78).

To calculate the stability of a straight scroll wave one can consider small transverse

deformations X, Y , perpendicular to the direction of the scroll z. Then, up to quadratic

order for the complex deformation field W (z, t) = X(z, t) + iY (z, t), Eqs. (82)-(84)

that results in a final helix radius R = [2(τ 0 − τ c)/(τ 0 + k)k2]1/2.
Numerically, the previous result can be obtained with simulations with periodic

boundary conditions where the twist is fixed. In the more realistic case of non-flux

boundary conditions, twist can be induced with a spatial change of excitability [160].

Interestly, Eqs. (83,84), give a very good prediction of the distribution of twist even for

fast spatial changes of excitability. The onset of sproing in this case can be calculated

from the absolute instability spectrum [160], giving rise to a spatial modulation in the

amplitude of the helix resulting from sproing.

8.2. Linear stability analysis of spiral and scroll waves

8.2.1. Stability analysis of spiral waves. A rigid rotating spiral wave, stationary

solution of the reaction-diffusion system, remains stationary in a frame rotating with the

same frequency ω of the spiral. In such co-moving frame the reaction-diffusion equations

take the form:

∂θ

)

V = D∇2V + I(V,w),
(

∂

∂t
− ω

)

w = R(V,w). (90)

The steady state solution corresponding to a rigidly rotating spiral wave (defined by V0
and w0) is obtained by solving the expression:

0 = ω

V0 +D∇2V0 + I(V0, w0),

0 = ω

The stability of the solution V0 and w0 is obtained through a linear stability analysis,

perturbing the solution V = V0 + V1 exp(σt) and w = w0 + w1 exp(σt), and evaluating

the eigenvalues of the resulting eigenvalue problem [285]:

Besides the neutral modes associated to translational and rotational symmetries, given

by eigenvalues σ = 0 and the complex-conjugate pair σt = ±iω (marked respectively as
a star at the origin Re(σ) = Im(σ) = 0 and two stars at Im(σ) = ±ω in Fig. 44), there
is a pair of eigenvalues whose stability Re(σ) changes with the control parameter of the

corresponding model employed in Eqs. (90). The rigid rotating spiral wave becomes

unstable through a Hopf bifurcation because these two eigenvalues are complex with

no null imaginary part, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 44. The complex part of

the eigenvalue produces a secondary frequency ωH . This new frequency induces the

meandering of spiral waves, a cycloidal motion composed by two frequencies. If ωH < ω

the meandering produces inward loops and if ωH > ω, outward loops, which is actually

the case shown in Fig. 44.

8.2.2. Linear stability analysis of untwisted straight scroll waves. Similarly to the case

of the spiral, a linear stability analysis permits the detection of instabilities of the rigidly

rotating scroll waves in a co-rotating reference frame, that will be used in the following.

First, Eqs. (38) are transformed into cylindrical coordinates (r,θ,z), using θ = θ0 − ωt

where, for simplicity, we do not considered the effects of the twist. The resulting equation

for the steady state is obtained assuming that V0 = V0(r, θ) and w0 = w0(r, θ). These

functions do not explicitly depend on the z-coordinate, so one recovers the basic solution

for the spiral wave, given by Eqs. (91), that in this case corresponds to a straight scroll

wave, without twist.

Next, the stability of this solution can be determined through a linear stability

analysis considering small perturbations of the steady state: V (r, θ, z) = V0(r, θ) +

V1(r, θ) exp(σt − ikzz) and w(r, θ, z) = w0(r, θ) + w1(r, θ) exp(σt − ikzz). Introducing
these perturbations in Eqs. (93), one obtains the equations obeyed by V1 and w1 and

From these equations the corresponding dispersion relation can be calculated [139],

i.e. the dependence of the different eigenvalues or growth rates σ on kz. If the real part

of one of the eigenvalues is positive (Re(σ) > 0) for a window of values of kz, the rigidly

rotating scroll wave is unstable.

As it was already noted in Sec. 6.1, the two-dimensional meander modes correspond

to two complex conjugate eigenmodes, whose real part crosses zero at the two-

dimensional meander instability line. The induction of the meander instability by

three-dimensional effects is shown in Fig. 45. All modes in Fig. 45(a) have negative

real parts so the scroll wave is stable. However, Fig. 45(b) shows that the real part of a

finite band of modes has become positive indicating that the 3D scroll wave is unstable

to meander, while the real part of 2D spiral meander mode at kz = 0 is still negative

and therefore the 2D spiral is stable.

One of the eigenvalue pairs obtained in the stability analysis of scroll waves

corresponding to a perturbation with kz = 0 is purely imaginary ±iω and is related to
the translational invariance of the underlying reaction-diffusion equations. For nonzero

values of kz, the real part of this eigenvalue may become positive and it is maximal

for a particular spatial wavenumber (Fig. 46). This instability corresponds to negative

filament tension. From the dispersion relation one observes that the band of unstable

wavenumbers has a maximum value kmaxz , which defines the minimum tissue size, or

critical thickness, Lmin = 2π/kmax, below which the negative line tension instability

does not develop [139,314], as discussed in Section 7.3.2.

assuming that V0 = V0(r, θ) and w0 = w0(r, θ). As in the previous case, the stability

of this solution can be determined through a linear stability analysis introducing small

perturbations of the steady state: V (r, θ, z) = V0(r, θ) + V1(r, θ) exp(σt − ikzz) and
w(r, θ, z) = w0(r, θ) + w1(r, θ) exp(σt− ikzz) into Eqs. (95):

For nonzero twist (τ 6= 0 ) the dispersion relations obtained from Eq. (96) are not
symmetric with respect kz and therefore σ does not depend only in k

z but also on odd

powers of kz.

8.3. Normal form analysis of the meander transition

8.3.1. Spiral waves. A simple phenomenological analysis of the transition to meander

was developed by Barkley [286] and further formalized by Sandstede & Scheel [287].

In this, a normal form is derived for the bifurcation to meander, assuming that it

occurs as a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, and taking into account Euclidean symmetry

(rotation plus translations in the plane). Then, at the onset of the instability there are

five marginal modes, corresponding to translational and rotational symmetry, and the

modes emerging from the Hopf bifurcation. With this, the model reads:

φ̇ = ω (97)

ṗ = eiφ(iωR0 − z) (98)
ż = (λH − |z|2)z (99)

where φ is the phase of the circular motion of the spiral tip, and the complex functions

p = x+ iy and z = ρeiα are the position of the tip and the (complex) amplitude of the

Hopf modes. Besides, the Hopf and translational eigenvalues are given by λH = µ+ iωH
and λT = iω, respectively (note that the equations are written in the original, not in

the comoving, frame). When µ < 0 the Hopf modes decay to zero, and the solution is



CONTENTS 84

a rigidly rotating spiral p(t) = R0e
iωt. When µ > 0, then, taking z = ρeiα, for the Hopf

mode one obtains:

ρ̇ = (µ− ρ2)ρ, α̇ = ωH , (100)
which, assuming that the amplitude decays fast to its steady state value, gives ρ =

√
µ,

α = α0 + ωHt. Then, the motion of the tip of the spiral is given by:

ṗ = iωR0e
iωt −√µe−iα0+i(ω−ωH)t. (101)

When the frequency of the Hopf modes is the same as the original frequency of the

spiral ωH = ω, this equation results in a linear drift of the tip:

p(t) = R0e
iωt −√µte−iα0 , (102)

If the frequencies are different, ωH 6= ω then, the solution reads:

p(t) = R0e
iωt +

i
√
µ

ω − ωH
e−iα0+i(ω−ωH)t, (103)

that results in outward or inward petals depending on the relative values of ω and ωH .

These type of normal forms can also be used, for instance, to study the resonant

drift of the spirals under the effect of a periodic forcing [362].

8.3.2. Scroll waves. The normal form of a spiral wave under meandering (97)-(99) has

to be modified in order to take into account the effects of a small curvature of slightly

curved filaments of a 3D scroll wave [315].

which indicates that the real value of σ depends on kz, and for large enough values of

γ the eigenvalue may become positive. The curvature at the origin of the translation

band is the same as the drift velocity of a spiral in the presence of a electric field. It

is also equal to the opposite of the curvature of the meander band shifted by a factor

β [315]. The specific form of the coefficients γ and β can be found in [315].

Figure 47. The difference between convective and absolute instabilities is illustrated

by the response to a localized perturbation - the solid line indicates the difference

between a state that evolves from a large local perturbation to a reference state (e. g.

a periodic wavetrain resp. a periodic train of action potentials in electrophysiological

context) and the reference state before the perturbation.

8.4. Linear stability analysis of spirals near breakup.

A theoretical analysis of spiral breakup can be based on a numerical linear stability

analysis of stable rotating spirals in a rotating frame [285] (see section 8.2.1) or on the

stability analysis of 1D wavetrains that are governing the radial dynamics in the spiral

waves [301, 304]. In the latter case one can compute the set of eigenvalues giving rise

to the essential (for unbounded system or systems with periodic boundary conditions)

or the absolute spectrum (for finite bounded systems) [363]. Similarly, the continuous

spectrum of spirals in large but bounded finite domains is different from the continuous

spectrum of spirals in unbounded domains. For more details, we refer to work by

Sandstede and Scheel [308,363]. In practice, instabilities of the absolute spectrum often

indicate an absolute instability of wavetrains, where a given perturbation grows locally,

i.e., at the point it was applied Fig. 47(b), whereas instabilities of the essential spectra

capture also convective instabilities, where the growing perturbations travel towards one

of the system boundaries (Fig. 47(a)). A typical example for the radial dynamics of a

spiral where the asymptotic wave-train in the far-field is convectively unstable is given in

Fig. 34 (a) in Section 6 above. It is worth noting that absolute and essential spectra of a

given wavetrain are obtained from the same linearized equation. The differences between

absolute and essential spectra are caused only by the different boundary conditions that

in turn lead to different eigenfunctions; for a simple example, see the discussion on a

Ginzburg-Landau equation with an advection term in [364].

To understand the mechanisms of spiral breakup, it is instructive to consider the

basic arguments in spiral stability analysis. A stable rotating spiral in an excitable

medium selects, for a given set of parameters, a particular wavelength λ0 and a related

temporal period T0. At the same moment, there exists a one-parameter family of periodic

wave solutions with varying speed c, temporal period T and wavelength λ = c(λ)T . The

one-parameter family is described by a conduction velocity (CV) dispersion curve c(λ).

At small wavelength, the wavetrains either exhibit an instability (modulation of Eckhaus

instability in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation(CGLE) resp. alternans in many

cardiac tissue models that are most relevant here) or cease to exist (saddle-node or



CONTENTS 86

drift pitchfork bifurcations in FitzHugh-Nagumo systems [365, 366]). If the wavelength

selected by the spiral is smaller than this minimum value, it will be unstable. These

minimum stable wavelengths and periods shall be called λmin, respectively Tmin, in the

following. Only in a few cases (e.g. for the CGLE describing oscillatory media [367],

or the Rinzel-Keller model of an excitable medium [368]), it is possible to compute

the instabilities or bifurcations analytically. In other cases, simpler kinematic theories

(see above section on alternans) or approximations by singular perturbation theory

(excitable media) may yield useful information on the nature of this instability. For

the models employed in cardiac dynamics, none of these methods are sufficient to yield

an understanding of the instability at λmin. This calls again for alternative methods,

namely numerical stability analysis of traveling waves, introduced above in Section 5.2.3.

8.4.1. Linear stability analysis of periodic traveling waves. One has to numerically

compute the 1D wave solutions and their linear stability along the dispersion curve.

Continuation software as AUTO can be used to obtain the spatial profiles U0(z)

of periodic waves as stationary solutions in a co-moving frame z = r − ct [369].
Consequently, one needs to compute periodic orbits that correspond to a single

wavelength with periodic boundary conditions. The evolution of small perturbations of

a spatially periodic travelling wave U0(z) in the reaction diffusion equations is described

by Wjn(z)e
ωjnt, where Wjn(z) and ωjn are eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the linearized

equations. For continuum models such as the reaction-diffusion equations used in

electrophysiology, there are infinitely many eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as the system

length L → ∞. Consequently, the ωjn are located on continuous curves in the complex
plane. A wavetrain solution is stable when all eigenvalues ωjn have non-positive real

parts. If the wavelength λ is used as a bifurcation parameter, the described method

yields accurate information on the minimum stable wavelength λmin for a given model

and parameter set, where the eigenvalue spectra and the eigenfunctions describe the

dynamics of perturbations to the wavetrains.

If one considers periodic travelling waves with constant shape U0(z) and constant

speed c in 1D, a few facts on the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions are known a priori. If

the cardiac model is spatially homogeneous, any translation of a given periodic solution

is also a valid solution with identical stability properties. This translational symmetry

of the wavetrains is reflected by an eigenvector W00 = dU0/dz with zero eigenvalue

ω00 = 0 (Goldstone mode). Symmetry arguments require the eigenfunctions of the

periodic operator, obtained by linearization around a wavetrain with wavelength λ, to

be Bloch functions Wjn(z) = e
i(2πn/L)zφjn(z) = e

ikzφjn(z) with φjn(z) = φjn(z + λ) and

n = 0, . . . , N −1 [370]. The above Bloch form can be used in an ansatz that reduces the
stability problem for the infinite domain to a stability problem in a domain of length λ

with the wavenumber k = 2πn/L as an additional parameter. If one assumes a purely

imaginary exponent ikz in the prefactor of the Bloch eigenfunctions, one obtains the

so-called essential spectrum. To assess the stability of spirals in finite domains, one

needs, however, to compute also the absolute spectrum. This can be done by employing

an ansatz Wjn(z) = e
(µ+ik)zφjn(z) for the eigenfunction that yields spectra depending on

the exponential weight, i.e. ωjn = ωjn(µ). The group velocities of the associated modes

are then vg = ∂Im(ωjn(µ))/∂k = ∂Re(ωjn(µ))/∂µ. The sign of the group velocities

indicates in which direction modes are travelling. In addition, one can compute the most

relevant parts of the absolute spectra ωjn(µ) by requiring ∂Re(ωjn(µ))/∂µ|µ=µ∗ = 0 and
verifying the pinching condition, see [308]. In this fashion, one can obtain the growth

rates and frequency of the modes with zero group velocity that constitute the absolute

spectrum and determine the stability in a finite system. A result of the application of

this procedure for a model near parameters for spiral breakup is shown in Fig. 48.

The result of an application of the described procedure for different parameters

in the vicinity of spiral breakup found in 2D simulations, is shown in Fig. 49, which

demonstrates that spiral breakup in this case of an excitable medium can be explained

from an absolute instability of the 1D wavetrain with the same wavelength as the

asymptotic wavelength in the far-field of the spiral. Remarkably, the studies from

which Fig. 48 and Fig. 49 were taken, both relate spiral breakup near the core

in a situation where meandering is absent to an absolute linear instability of the 1D

wavetrain. Interestingly, the critical modes in Fig. 48 are short (i.e. finite) wavelength

whereas the instability in Fig. 49 results from a long-wavelength Eckhaus instability.

8.4.2. Spiral instabilities and breakup phenomenologies. Potential discrepancies

between 2D simulation and stability analysis of the 1D radial dynamics may arise

from nonlinear behaviour not captured by the linear stability analysis or instabilities

of the discrete spectrum, like spiral meandering [286, 302] discussed in Subsection 6.1.

Such instabilities do not have a counterpart in one dimension and require a numerical

stability analysis in two dimensions that is computationally more expensive and in

practice often restricted to rather small domain sizes (typically up to system sizes of a

few spiral wavelengths) as well as to the iterative computation of the largest eigenvalues.

Wheeler and Barkley have carried out a full 2D numerical stability analysis for a spiral

in a circular domain and a co-rotating frame of reference and obtained a reasonable

approximation of the continuous and discrete spectra for spirals in large domains [371].

This approach is conceptually even simpler and more complete than the reduction of the

spiral stability analysis to the analysis of stability of 1D wavetrains presented above, but

is computationally much more expensive and may be difficult to apply to many-variable

cardiac models.

One can analyze the phenomenon of spiral breakup by comparing numerical

simulations with a stability analysis of periodic wavetrains. It is thereby possible to

link distinct phenomenologies of spiral breakup, e.g. core breakup and far-field breakup

(see Fig. 33), with different instabilities of the radial wavetrains or rotating spirals.

Additional factors like meander instability, which is often quite pronounced in realistic

models, make the analysis more difficult.

A study of simple reaction-diffusion systems [304] revealed that the instabilities of

1D wavetrains in a ring geometry are usually of convective nature (see section 3.2). To

obtain breakup in stationary sources, respectively non-meandering spirals, however, an

absolute instability of the plane waves in the far-field is required [367], which requires

additional consideration. Several studies [304, 308, 371] have found that spiral breakup

in simulations is often clearly correlated with absolute linear instabilities of plane waves

in the far-field. Stability analysis also showed a relation between the characteristics

of the instability and the phenomenology of breakup in simulations. Linear stability

analysis of waves yields information on the group velocity of the unstable modes, which

sometimes gives a hint on the phenomenology of spiral breakup in the present context.

Hence, the sign of the group velocity may decide if breakup occurs near or far-away

from the core. It is important to note that nevertheless (i) core breakup can result



CONTENTS 89

from different types of instability and that (ii) the same instability scenario may lead

to phenomenologically different appearances. In other words, the form of the linearly

unstable modes is not sufficient to determine the full nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics.

Moreover, a particular phenomenology found in simulations does not necessary allow

a conclusion on the specific nature of the linear instability presumably behind it. To

obtain the full information, direct simulations and an independent linear stability are

hence necessary. In many cardiac models, core breakup is presumably caused by an

alternans instability of the wavetrains emitted from the spiral core [225,279,292,372].

The influence of meandering and the resulting Doppler effect in core breakup

has been verified in simulations [91] and experiments with the Belousov-Zhabotinsky

reaction [290]. Far-field breakup of (presumably) meandering spirals with a non-

decaying modulation of the wavetrain in the far-field (’superspirals’ [287,373]) has been

studied in the same reaction [309,310]. Here, an interpretation of the breakup in terms

of the non-linear consequences of the Eckhaus instability has been given [303]. Most

of results for the stability analysis of spirals near the onset of breakup were obtained

for simple reaction-diffusion systems. The analysis and numerical procedures described

here may be applied to simple cardiac models like the Aliev-Panfilov model [79] or the

variant of the Noble model studied by Karma [84]. This should enable researchers to

elucidate the mechanisms behind the rich phenomenology of spiral breakup found in

cardiac models [40]. Finally, the hypothesis that alternans is the crucial instability

behind spiral breakup maybe tested and possible alternatives may be uncovered.

9. Discussion and outlook

Cardiac arrhythmias are potential triggers of sudden cardiac death, which is the main

cause of death in the developed world [374], and a plethora of other health risks.

The transition between healthy and pathological tissue dynamics may have different

causes, e.g., myocardial ischemia, infarction or genetic predisposition. Similarly, the

dynamical mechanisms governing such a transition are not unique and often not well

understood. As a result mathematical modeling of action potential propagation in the

heart has become a major research topic during the last two decades. Realistic models

of cardiac tissue include hundred of dynamical coupled equations evolving in complex

and asymmetrical geometries.

A huge growth of computational capabilities and numerical algorithms in the last

years has enabled direct numerical simulations, employing these models, to reproduce

the main properties of cardiac arrhythmia and the associated dynamical transitions.

However, mechanistic interpretations of the transition are often difficult and missing for

realistic cardiac models. Therefore, we have reviewed here often findings in simplified

models of cardiac tissue to analyze the different mechanisms of instabilities in cardiac

dynamics and provided simplified theoretical descriptions.

Altogether, cardiac modeling has emerged as one of the prime application areas of

theories and methods of nonlinear physics originally developed for pattern formation in

extended nonequilibrium media. Rotors are believed to be formed in reentry and are

crucial for the appearance of arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia (VT) as well as

atrial and ventricular fibrillation (AF,VF). Therefore, a substantial part of this review

is focused on the dynamics and potential instabilities of such structures.

We have reviewed the related advances in theory, the different numerical and

analytical methods that have been developed in recent years and their application to

cardiac dynamics. According to Jalife [4] in particular rotors are crucial:“AF and

VT/VF are by far the most significant cardiac arrhythmias faced by the physician.

Owing to their highly complex electrocardiographic appearance, both AF and VF are

commonly thought of as being the result of exceptionally complex and disorganized cardiac

activation, in which electrical waves propagate through the atria or ventricles chaotically

and unpredictably. In fact, during fibrillation the electrical activation sequence is

profoundly abnormal; electrical wave fronts do not follow the usual paths. The atrial or

ventricular rates accelerate to the extreme and electrical waves assume a complex vortex-

like behavior that looks a lot like eddy formation and turbulence in water. Recent evidence

strongly suggesting that rotors are critical in sustaining both atrial and ventricular

fibrillation (AF, VF) in the human heart, which may have critical implications for

treatment with radio-frequency ablation.” This passage illustrates the fruitful exchange

between the nonlinear physics and the cardiology communities that has been the main

theme of this review article.

What has been achieved is a detailed understanding of a few central phenomena.

Often this has been done initially for largely simplified cardiac model equations. The



CONTENTS 91

findings and the associated methods described here can, however, also be applied to more

realistic electrophysiological models and may in the future help the analysis of newly

developed computational models. The starting point for a nonlinear dynamics treatment

of cardiac propagation is a periodic sequence of action potentials corresponding to (a

somewhat idealized) normal sine rhythm. This rhythm is parametrized by its frequency

and the wavelength of subsequent action potentials and corresponding velocities.

A key instability that already occurs in the local dynamics of paced cardiac

cells is cardiac alternans (Section 5), which is a period doubling of the oscillation in

the membrane potential of a single cardiac cell occurring at sufficiently large pacing

frequency. In a single cell the onset of alternans can be predicted from the action

potential duration (APD) restitution curve that describes the dependency of the time

a specific AP lasts on the diastolic interval The map approach, amplitude equations as

well as numerical linear analysis of APD trains allow accurate predictions for the onset

of alternans. Many of these theories are not rigorous and therefore need comparison

with direct numerical simulations. In tissue, alternans may occur in two different

forms, namely discordant and concordant alternans. Discordant alternans is particularly

relevant and may lead to further complications like APD block and formation of rotors.

The mechanism of its occurrence has been worked out nicely in the framework of

amplitude equations.

The dynamics of rotors invokes many complicated phenomena. Rotors in cardiac

tissues behave usually in a complicated manner. This is a result of various dynamical

instabilities of the spirals rigid rotation (Section 6). These may act upon the core region

near the tip or in the far-field of periodic waves of a spiral or affect both aspects. Most

electrophysiological models display strong meandering, a well understood phenomenon

stemming from an oscillatory instability of the tip motion. Instabilities in the far-field

lead typically to the destruction of coherent spiral patterns and to formation of new

rotors by spiral breakup.

Scroll waves are subject to many new instabilities like negative filament line tension

and sproing that were described in Section 7, that also contains a discussion on the

state-of-the art characterization of electrical turbulence. Finally, Section 8 deals with

approaches to analyze the instabilities behind the complex dynamical phenomenologies

found in simulations of cardiac dynamics and corresponding experiments. A main

result is that changes in behavior of rotors are often associated with linear instabilities.

Numerical stability analysis can then give an accurate determination of critical

parameters, nature of instabilities and bifurcation and their spatiotemporal signatures.

A popular view cited in many talks and publications, see e.g. [15, 40] is that the

mechanism for ventricular fibrillation may develop from a rotor that occurs from a

perturbation of the regular sine rhythm. The rotor is the center of a spiral wave

that typically has a much higher frequency than the sine rhythm in cardiac tissue

and therefore occurs as tachycardia. If this spiral is unstable a more irregular pattern

appears that bears the signature of fibrillation. Alternative explanations for the irregular

dynamics observed in fibrillation have featured a single drifting or wildly moving



CONTENTS 92

(meandering) rotor or electrical turbulence forming at some distance from a spiral

(mother rotor) center. All these scenarios can be traced back to the different instabilities

described in this review and are, in principle, possible in perfectly homogeneous

tissue. Since healthy tissue usually is not subject to the cascade of events leading

to fibrillatory activity, functional reentry may occur as a result of pathological changes

in the electrophysiological properties of the myocytes.

While this review mostly has dealt with cardiac propagation in homogeneous and

isotropic media, the true heart has a couple of other important features that need to be

incorporated into a realistic modeling with the goal to obtain quantitative predictions

and sufficient agreement with experiments. In the following we briefly address some of

these possible model extensions.

• Models including heterogeneities and anisotropy: Heterogeneities (see Section 4.2)
and anisotropy (see Section 3.5) are often relevant in the formation and maintenance

of arrhythmias. In such a case, one sometimes speaks of anatomical reentry. While

investigations of spatially homogeneous models show that heterogeneities are not

always necessary to generate complex, irregular activity in the heart, they may

largely enhance the probability of such effects and alter substantially the appearance

of irregular electrical activity in the tissue. A striking example are the complex

fractionated atrial electrograms, see e. g. [375], that show very short correlations in

space that cannot be reproduced in simulation of homogeneous tissue models and

are therefore often associated with microfibrosis or other variations of conductive

properties at the level of individual cardiac muscle cells. As a result more and

more models incorporate detailed information on structural heterogeneities or the

anatomy of fiber orientation that determines the anisotropic conduction properties

in the heart and try to assess the impact of tissue anatomy on cardiac dynamics,

for a short review, see e. g. [32]. In ageing tissue the amount of heterogeneity,

e.g. due to fibrosis, as well as the prevalence of arrhythmias like AF and VF is

strongly increased. Therefore, it will be necessary to include structural details

possibly obtained from imaging of specific patient into quantitative modeling of

cardiac disease. A good understanding of the role of heterogeneity,a classical

subject on cardiac modeling research with contributions already in the sixties [376],

shall nevertheless be coupled to an analysis of an averaged homogeneous model. If

the averaged parameters place the dynamics in the tissue close to an instability,

the influence of heterogeneities may be crucial to trigger malfunction. For larger

heterogeneities and smoothly varying parameters, again stability analysis and

bifurcation theory can be directly applied to cardiac as has been done previously

for simple generic reaction-diffusion equations of FitzHugh-Nagumo type [377–380].

Modeling of heterogeneities is also necessary for a better understanding and

development of therapeutic strategies in atrial and ventricular fibrillation. To

prevent these arrhythmias, already now ablation procedures are employed that

assume that the source of these abnormal cardiac dynamics can be localized and

isolated. This implicitly assumes that they stem from areas where ischaemia or



CONTENTS 93

fibrosis have altered the dynamics of the tissue towards a potentially damaging

form. Another relevant area where heteregoneities of another type have recently

be implicated is defibrillation of tissue with chaotic, irregular activity. Luther

et al. have provided experimental evidence that suggests that defibrillation may

work to a large extent by wave initiation at larger non-conducting heterogeneities

in cardiac tissue, namely blood vessels that exceed a certain critical size [54, 55].

Their work has sparked a lively discussion among experimentalist and modelers. A

recent contribution is the work by Caldwell et al. who provide experimental data

on wave initiation by applying external field to tissue and provide an alternative

explanation [381]. The final word in this debate is, however, not yet spoken

and will require a much larger effort in modeling and detailed experiments that

should aim at understanding the mechanism of defibrillation and on optimizing the

defibrillation strategies, e. g. by following and critically testing ideas like Luther et

al. who showed that application of a sequence of smaller shocks may provide much

more efficient than the standard protocol of defibrillation based on one single large

shock [54].

A topic related to the inclusion of heterogeneities is the correct description of

anisotropy. Despite large progress during the last years in computational modeling

the extension of the analysis of instabilities to anisotropic conditions, more complete

geometries and more elaborate models is still in progress. For example the

characteristic Eikonal equation can be generalized to the case of anisotropic tissue to

produce a modified curvature relation for wave fronts in anisotropic generic models

of excitable media [382]. The use of complex metrics adapting the anisotropic

properties of the media, for example using analytical models of fiber structure [383],

to the metrics and generalize the analytical solutions in cartesian coordinates to

the new metrics has already given first promising results.

• Models with electro-mechanical coupling and mechano-electric feedback: An
important improvement in the instability theories of cardiac tissue has been already

begun with the incorporation of the effects of the deformation of the tissue in

the study of the different instabilities. The effect of a deforming metrics in

wave propagation has been studied in simulations in a medium with a varying

oscillatory metric [384, 385] and indicate that the mechanical deformation could

play an important role on the stability of spiral waves. An oscillatory change

of metrics in one of the directions, results effectively in time-varying anisotropic

diffusion that changed the local curvature of the waves emitted by the spiral. If,

at a given point, the local curvature became too small to support propagation,

block and spiral break-up resulted. On the other hand, the influence of the stretch

activated channels in action potential morphology and propagation has been shown

to give rise to spontaneous oscillations [104,386,387], ectopic beats [388], initiation

of spiral waves [389,390], spiral break-up [105,391], instability of scroll waves [392],

or transition from concordant to discordant alternans [249].

• Stochastic models: Throughout this review, we have discussed deterministic models.



CONTENTS 94

Since, however, the importance of fluctuations and stochastic dynamics ihas been

established for important aspect of cardiac muscle cell physiology, in particular for

intracellular calcium cycling [26], stochastic elements have entered more advanced

physiological models and have become a topic of increasing interest to cardiac

modelers. This aspect was recently covered by a longer review article [27].

Often these models describe the fluctuation at the level of a single cell. It remains

a largely unsolved problem, how fluctuations at the level of the single cell can

be incorporated in tissue models. Moreover, it is not yet clear if and how such

fluctuations will become critical for the dynamics at the tissue or organ level. A

first step maybe to employ discrete models of cardiac tissue that represent the

dynamics of individual cells and are simple enough to be computationally feasible,

see e. g. [170–172], with additional noise terms or a stochastic dynamics derived

from detailed cellular models.

In summary, we have reviewed here a collection of important results regarding the

dynamics of cardiac propagation in one-, two- and three-dimensional cardiac tissue and

introduced tools for the analysis of crucial instabilities that have been previously applied

to generic models of excitable media and to simple cardiac models. Such knowledge

may motivate other researchers to extend the current techniques into more elaborate

frameworks, where it may be used for more complex and realistic physiological models of

cardiac tissue and eventually contribute to a complete understanding and classification

of cardiac arrhythmias, which should be helpful for the subsequent development of

efficient defibrillation protocols or preventive drug therapies.
