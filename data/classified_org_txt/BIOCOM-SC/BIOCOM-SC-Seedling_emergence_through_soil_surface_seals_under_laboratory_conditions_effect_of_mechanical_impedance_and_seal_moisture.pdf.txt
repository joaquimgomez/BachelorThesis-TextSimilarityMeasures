Running title: Seedling emergence through soil seals  12 

 13 

Abstract 14 

It is well known that soil sealing strongly affects seedling emergence. The effect of soil 15 

sealing on the emergence of flax and turnip seedlings was studied in the laboratory. Seeds 16 

were sown in pots, watered, then covered with loamy soil and water was added. Three 17 

different doses of water were tested. Soil sealing was obtained with a paste of soil mixed 18 

with distilled water, added to each pot as a thick homogeneous, continuous and isotropic 19 

layer. The initial water content of the seal was measured. When seedling emergence was 20 

observed (or at the end of the experiment in the case of event failure), seal strength was 21 

measured in situ by a firmness pressure tester (used as a penetrometer). Relationships 22 

between water loss and initial moisture of the seal versus mechanical impedance were 23 

obtained. Differences in emergence success between species depended on the initial soil 24 

water content as well as on the initial seal moisture. A model of seedling emergence 25

Introduction  30 

Soil sealing (also known as soil crusting) is a worldwide problem, occurring under a wide 31 

range of soil types and climatic conditions (Awadhwal & Thierstein 1985). Although 32 

physical and biological soil seals are an almost negligible portion of the soil, they have a 33 

number of crucial roles, especially where water is scarce (Maestre et al. 2011). Soil seals 34 

form the boundary between soil and atmosphere, and therefore control gas, water and 35 

nutrient exchange into and through soils (Belnap et al. 2005). Physical seals are formed 36 

by densely packed mineral particles resulting from either the disruption of soil aggregates 37 

and reorganisation of the disaggregated particles into “structural seals”, or the formation 38 

of “depositional seals” (Valentin & Bresson 1992; Cerdan et al. 2001; Fox et al. 2004). In 39 

particular, soil sealing is a consequence of disruption of soil aggregates by water. Several 40 

mechanisms have been suggested as responsible for disruption of soil aggregates: the 41 

presence of electrolytes in the soil solution (associated with sodic soils); mechanical 42 

action (for example by raindrop impact, Agassi et al. 1981); or a combination of both 43 

mechanisms. In all cases, the wetting process (fast or slow wetting) contributes decisively 44 

to disruption of soil aggregates. In the Mediterranean region, the formation of physical 45 

seals on the soil surface is common (Singer & Le Bissonnais 1998), due to climate 46 

conditions, low soil organic matter content and poor structure and aggregate stability 47 

(Singer 1991).  48 

Soil sealing strongly affects seedling emergence (Aubertot et al. 2002), and hence crop-49 

stand establishment (Awadhwal & Thierstein 1985). Seedling emergence is affected by 50 



3 
 

soil sealing through two mechanisms: physical impedance and changes in water 51 

evaporation rate which determines the moisture content in the seed bed (Rapp et al. 52 

2000). The strength of a seal is affected by its moisture content and thickness, rate of 53 

drying, rainfall intensity and duration, soil texture, type of clay and bulk density 54 

(Awadhwal & Thierstein 1985). Those authors explained that a harder and less permeable 55 

soil seal develops under the following conditions: (1) high initial bulk density of the 56 

topsoil; (2) the soil does not contain organic matter and its clay content is high (3) the soil 57 

aggregates at the surface are smaller prior to wetting; (4) the upper layer water content is 58 

high and maintained for longer (slower drying). When the seal is sufficiently wet, the 59 

seedling deforms the material, and emergence takes place through penetration (Arndt 60 

1965; Souty & Rode 1993). When the seal is dry, but not yet locally cracked by 61 

shrinkage, it may bend and break, if the exerted force is sufficient (Goyal et al. 1982; 62 

Souty & Rode 1993, 1994).  63 

Seedling emergence depends not only on the soil seal strength, but also on the thrust that 64 

the seedlings can exert against the seal. It is generally assumed that the probability of 65 

seedling establishment depends greatly on seed size, e.g., the amount of reserves 66 

accumulated for early seedling development (Haig & Westoby 1988), and so seals could 67 

be especially critical for small-grain plants (Nuttall 1982; Gallardo-Carrera et al. 2006). 68 

Various methods of measuring the thrust strength of seedlings are used in laboratory 69 

trials, including the measurement of longitudinal deformation of a steel plate in direct 70 

contact with seedlings (Bouzaziz et al. 1990; Tamet et al. 1995), and measurement of the 71 

force that seedlings exert with sophisticate sensors (Gallardo-Carrera et al. 2007), 72 

indicating thrusts ranging from zero to around 0.5 N, depending on the species and the 73 

soil moisture.  74 



4 
 

This work intended to describe the emergence of seedlings of flax and turnip, two small 75 

seed crops, as affected by the impedance of laboratory-generated seals, and the initial soil 76 

and seal water contents. The mechanical characteristics of the soil seals depending on the 77 

degree of water loss were also studied and modelled, in order to predict the final 78 

emergence rate. 79 

 80 

Material and Methods 81 

A set of experiments were carried out using commercial seeds of flax (Linum 82 

usitatissimum L., Linaceae) and turnip (Brassica rapa L., Brassicaceae) whose ability to 83 

germinate under laboratory conditions had been previously established. We chose flax 84 

and turnip because they are crop species with relatively small seeds without sufficient 85 

reserves to overcome deep seeding or soil sealing (Forbes & Watson 1992). The weights 86 

of 1000 seeds were 5.86 g for flax and 2.10 g for turnip. 87 

Only one type of soil was used throughout the experiments, a dried and sieved (< 2 mm) 88 

sandy clay loam (22% clay, 26% silt and 52% sand) obtained from the Ap horizon of a 89 

calcareous soil (Molina et al. 2016). In the field cracks are present in topsoil; however 90 

during the experiments crack formation was not observed in the experimental units, 91 

probably because of the small size in diameter. Each experimental unit was a plastic pot 92 

with a capacity of 145 mL (5.5 cm diameter and 6.1 cm height) that was filled according 93 

to the following procedure. First, a layer of sand 1.2 cm thick was placed at the bottom, 94 

and approximately half of the intended volume of water was added (I1). Then, the dried 95 

and sieved soil was added until the plastic pot was filled to 2 or 3 mm below the top, and 96 

one seed of flax or turnip which had been previously imbibed in distilled water (24 h) 97 

was placed on the surface, and the second half dose of water was added (I2). Finally, a 98 

thin layer (2 to 3 mm) of saturated soil paste was applied to completely fill the plastic pot. 99 



5 
 

This last layer became a seal when dry. Three total water amounts (I1+I2) were applied, 100 

20, 40, and 50 g (equivalent to 8.6 mm, 17.1 mm, and 21.4 mm of water, respectively), to 101 

obtain three initial levels of soil moisture (IMSoil w/w). The saturated soil paste was 102 

prepared to obtain homogeneous and isotropic seals, with initial water contents (IMSeal - 103 

initial moisture of seal) of 0.213 to 0.337 (w/w), considering the water added to the dry 104 

soil to prepare the paste. The IMSoil moisture level of 8.6 mm is the minimum water 105 

volume needed to form a seal, while the moisture level of 21.4 mm was not only enough 106 

to form a water surface lamina but, at the same time, to ensure the wetting of all the soil 107 

contained in the pots by infiltration. These minimum and maximum water volumes would 108 

allow the generation of water infiltration to 1 cm and 5 cm in depth, respectively. These 109 

experimental conditions are very reproducible, although they may differ from some field 110 

conditions. 140 pots were thus prepared and subsequently monitored. 50 pots were used 111 

for each one of the IMSoil moisture levels 8.6 mm and 17.1 mm, including 5 different 112 

IMSeal moistures for flax and for turnip (with 5 replicates each one). However, the 113 

highest level of IMSoil moisture (21.4 mm) was represented with 40 pots, because only 4 114 

different IMSeal moistures could be taken into consideration for each species. 115 

Twice a day the seal was monitored to determine whether emergence had occurred. When 116 

a seedling emergence was observed, the following data were recorded: the final weight of 117 

each pot (g); the mechanical impedance of the seal (MPa); and the moisture of the seal 118 

(w/w), determined by drying one sample at 105 ºC to constant weight. The same 119 

measurements were made in pots where no seedlings emerged until the end of the 120 

experiment (this was when 24 h passed without recording further seedling germinations). 121 

The mechanical impedance (MI) of the seals was measured using a firmness pressure 122 

tester (fruit sclerometer) with a cylindrical head of diameter 11 mm (95 mm2 area). A 123 

continuous pressure was applied to the seal until it was broken. Water loss (WL mm) was 124 



6 
 

determined by the difference between the weight of the pots at the beginning of the 125 

experiment and at seedling emergence, or at failure. The precision of weighing was 0.001 126 

g. The thickness of the seals developed in one set of samples pots was measured with a 127 

slide gauge. The mean seal thickness formed (n = 50) was 3.5 mm (SE 0.4 mm, range 128 

2.9–4.2 mm). 129 

The data were first analysed statistically using a set of exploratory techniques to 130 

investigate linear, or nonlinear, relationships between measured parameters linked with 131 

soil moisture, seal moisture, water loss, mechanical impedance of the seal, seal water 132 

balance and water remaining in the soil sample, taking into account various groups of 133 

data characterized by the two species, the seedling emergence, and the initial moisture 134 

contents of soil and seals.  135 

General linear models (GLM) and variance tests (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the 136 

influence of the main factors – species (flax / turnip), emergence of seedlings (yes / no), 137 

IMSoil (8.6, 17.1, 21.4 mm) and IMSeal -, on the measured mechanical impedance, as 138 

well as their interactions. The separation of means was evaluated using the Games-139 

Howell method. Descriptive statistics were also calculated to characterize the mechanical 140 

impedance for the trials carried out according to the emergence or non-emergence of the 141 

seedlings. 142 

Binary logistic regressions of the emergence of a seedling, a binary response variable, 143 

were performed with the initial seal moisture as a continuous predictor and for the 144 

various combinations of species and initial soil moistures studied. The models were fitted 145 

using an iterative reweighted least squares algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood 146 

estimates of the parameters, and the logit link function was used. To assess the 147 

performance of each fitted logistic regression model, various tests to determine the 148 

goodness-of-fit and some measures of association were used: (i) Deviance test and 149 



7 
 

Pearson test to determine whether the predicted probabilities deviated from the observed 150 

probabilities, (ii) Hosmer-Lemeshow test to compare the observed and expected 151 

frequencies of emergence, to assess how well the model fits the data, and (iii) Somers’ D, 152 

c-statistic, Goodman and Kruskal's gamma, Kendall's tau which use the measurements of 153 

concordant pairs, discordant pairs and the total number of pairs to compare the predicted 154 

responses with actual responses.  155 

Data were analysed using Minitab® Statistical Software (Minitab Inc. 2012). The 156 

probability level of significance was set at 0.05. 157 

 158 

Results and discussion 159 

In general, first seedling emergences were observed 3 days since the pots were prepared. 160 

The monitoring period lasted at least a week (7-10 days). After that, we considered the 161 

trial finished. The overall success rates of seedling emergence were 50% for flax and 162 

51.43% for turnip (with a standard error (SE) of 5.97 % for both species), and the highest 163 

and lowest emergence rates were obtained with flax at IMSoil of 21.4 mm and 8.6 mm 164 

respectively (Table 1).  165 

Fig. 1 shows the positive linear relationship between water loss and mechanical 166 

impedance. The p-value (< 0.001) for the linear regression model shows that the model 167 

estimated is significant, and that the mechanical impedance (MPa) can be predicted by 168 

water loss (mm), MI = -0.3037 + 0.0614·WL (r = 0.873), displaying that the flow of 169 

humidity through the pot, which then evaporates or evapotranspiration results in the 170 

hardening of the seal. During the drying of the soil, surface tension compresses the 171 

particles together, forming a thick and strong layer (Sumner, 1992). 172 

A GLM of the variable MI with the three main factors (species, emergence and IMSoil) 173 

and the covariable IMSeal, and all possible interactions, was established. Species was not 174 



8 
 

a significant factor (p-value = 0.247) while the interaction of the other two factors 175 

(emergence and IMSoil) with the covariate (IMSeal) showed a significant effect on 176 

mechanical impedance (p-value < 0.001). The relationship between mechanical 177 

impedance of the seal and its initial moisture (IMSeal) is presented in Fig. 2, 178 

distinguishing between the emergence success or failure, and the three levels of IMSoil. 179 

Nevertheless, only in the case of IMSoil = 21.4 mm and non-emerged seedlings, did the 180 

fitted linear model between IMSeal and MI have a slope significantly different from zero 181 

(p-value < 0.001); the linear regression models of mechanical impedance versus IMSeal 182 

were not significant (the predictor IMSeal did not explain MI) for the other groups of 183 

data. Therefore, no relationship was detected between these two variables in the pots 184 

where seedling emergence was observed. Fig. 2 shows that emergence took place when 185 

the mechanical impedance was approximately below 0.4 MPa, whatever the initial seal 186 

moisture content. These values of seal mechanical impedance are in the lower band of 187 

field observations (Gallardo-Carrera et al. 2007). The seal impedance of pots where 188 

emergence did not occur that had been watered with 8.6 mm or 17.1 mm followed the 189 

same pattern, that is, the final mechanical impedance of the seal was not related with its 190 

initial moisture, and it varied approximately across the same range as in pots with 191 

seedling emergence (very few cases above 0.4 MPa). No significant differences were 192 

detected between the mean mechanical impedances corresponding to the three levels of 193 

IMSoil in pots with seedling emergence, and that corresponding to the lowest level of 194 

IMSoil in pots without seedling emergence (Fig. 2), with mean values around 0.15 MPa. 195 

Thus, failure to emerge in these cases does not seem attributable only to the IMSeal, 196 

although it was related with the seal strength. Moreover, when the IMSoil was highest 197 

(21.4 mm) the mechanical impedance of the seals in pots where emergence did not occur 198 

was clearly inversely related with their initial soil moisture, giving the widest range of 199 



9 
 

seal mechanical impedances of the entire experiment (Fig. 2). It is notable that at similar 200 

values of seal mechanical impedance, some seedlings of both species emerged but others 201 

did not. These intra-species variations may be affected by the depth of the seed inside the 202 

pot, its size, and its speed of germination. Survival chances of seedlings depend, to a 203 

great extent, on the speed of germination after effective-rains, since fast germination 204 

ensures emergence before seal formation by the drying soil as well as the early 205 

establishment of a root system to tap water from deeper soil layers (Kigel 1995); 206 

moreover, larger seeds contain more reserves than the smaller seeds (Haig & Westoby 207 

1988). It is thus possible that the large, quickly germinating seeds were able to break the 208 

seal, while the smaller, slower seeds were not.  209 

The seedlings of both species develop with the cotyledons above ground (epigeous 210 

germination). The seedlings of flax have hypocotyls 1.5–4 mm long, epicotyls up to 1.5 211 

mm long, elliptical-oblong cotyledons, 6.5–14 mm long and leafy. Those of turnip 212 

develop a taproot and lateral roots, have hypocotyls 5 cm long, epicotyls 2–4 mm long, 213 

cotyledons with petioles 2 cm long, blade cordate, 1–1.5 cm long, cuneate at base, and 214 

notched at apex (Corner 1976). Both species produce lipid-containing seeds (Al-Ani et al. 215 

1985; Crawford 1992), and were considered to have low strength in terms of seal 216 

penetration (Forbes & Watson 1992; Gallardo-Carrera et al. 2007). In addition to their 217 

differences in morphology and seed size, flax seeds are compressed, 6–10 mm × 2–3 mm, 218 

while turnip seeds are globose, 1–1.5 mm in diameter (Corner 1976). Flax seeds are 219 

myxospermous, that is their coat produces mucilage when wet, while turnip seeds do not 220 

(Bengoechea & Gomez-Campo 1975; Crawford 1992). As mentioned above, the overall 221 

relative frequencies of emergence of the two species were very similar, but there were 222 

important differences in their emergence success depending on the initial water content as 223 

well as the initial seal moisture. Flax emerged more successfully when the initial soil 224 



10 
 

moisture was greater, while turnip emerged more successfully when initial soil moisture 225 

was lowest (Table 1).  226 

Binary logistic regression was used to determine the probability of emergence of a 227 

seedling in various conditions, and clarify the observed responses. These one-predictor 228 

models were fitted to the data to test the relationship between the likelihood that a seed 229 

emerges (π) and the initial moisture of the seal (IMSeal), according to π = 230 

exp(α+β·IMSeal) / (1+ exp(α+β·IMSeal)), where α and β are the regression coefficients. 231 

The results are shown in Table 1, and the regression coefficients were only significantly 232 

different from 0 for turnip seeds at the two higher IMSoil, although the directions of these 233 

relationships were opposite. For the remaining cases, the regressions showed that IMSeal 234 

was not a significant predictor of seedling emergence across the range of values studied; 235 

it is not possible to be certain that the IMSeal had an effect on the response. In the case of 236 

flax with intermediate IMSoil, IMSeal could be considered a significant predictor if the 237 

level of significance was set at 0.10 (but not at 0.05). Fig. 3 depicts these differences 238 

between the various cases, with the graphical representations of the estimated probability 239 

of seedling emergence depending on the initial seal moisture, considering the two species 240 

and the three levels of initial soil moisture separately. The results of the assessment of the 241 

model goodness-of-fit for all these regressions were also presented in Table 1; all the 242 

cases (except one of the statistical tests) were not significant, suggesting that the models 243 

were well fitted to the data. The best values for the measurements of association 244 

expressing the degree to which predicted probabilities agree with actual outcomes were 245 

obtained for turnip at the two higher levels of IMSoil, and the worst values also occurred 246 

for turnip, for the lowest level of IMSoil. For flax, the values obtained for these 247 

concordance statistics can be considered correct and acceptable.  248 



11 
 

The water content of the seal, in addition to that of the soil, was decisive in determining 249 

flax emergence at the intermediate level of IMSoil, where the probability of emergence 250 

increased when IMSeal increased; however, it seemed to play no role at the other two 251 

levels of IMSoil. Despite this, the percentage of flax emergence increased with IMSoil 252 

(Table 1). The results do not inform about the role of the mucilage layer, which differs 253 

between species (Crawford 1992; Kigel 1995), but it seems that, concerning flax, the seed 254 

imbibition and/or the seedling elongation were favoured when the water content 255 

increased. 256 

On the other hand, turnip was more successful at emerging at IMSoil of 8.4 mm (Table 257 

1), independently of IMSeal; at the intermediate IMSoil the probability of emergence 258 

increased when IMSeal increased, while at 21.4 mm of IMSoil the reverse was observed 259 

(Fig. 3). After imbibition there is a gradual acceleration of metabolism, and the resulting 260 

demand for oxygen exceeds the rate of replacement; seed endurance during this period of 261 

natural anaerobiosis is strictly limited, and when it is prolonged by excessive burial, 262 

flooding or compaction, emergence is greatly reduced (Crawford 1992). Al-Ani et al. 263 

(1985) and Crawford (1992) demonstrated that flax and turnip, both lipid-containing 264 

seeds, suffer at least a partial oxygen deficit during the initial stage of germination, but 265 

the percentage of post-anoxic survival was up to 15% greater in flax than in turnip, after 266 

24h of anoxia (80% versus 65%). Thus, in this case, the water content of the seal seems 267 

to play a crucial role in successful seedling emergence by increasing its mechanical 268 

impedance over time, and by acting as an oxygen barrier. It could be very important in 269 

small seeds with a lipid-rich endosperm.  270 

In those situations (combination of soil and seed) where the presence of a resistant seal 271 

limits the development of seedlings, the flow of water through the seal contributes to its 272 



12 
 

hardening. The appropriate reduction of this flow (mulch, shading, simultaneity of two 273 

crops, etc.) can contribute to reduce this limitation. 274

FIGURES AND TABLES 353 

Table 1. Logistic regression analysis of the emergence of 140 seeds of the two tested 354 

species (Flax and Turnip) placed in soils with three different levels of initial moisture 355 

(IMSoil). The logistic regression model has the following form: logit(Emergence) = 356 

ln(π/(1-π)) = α + β·IMSeal, where the variable Emergence is the dichotomous outcome 357 

variable (Yes / No), π is the probability of the outcome (emergence of the seedling), and 358 

IMSeal (initial moisture of the seal) is the continuous predictor. 359 

Figure captions 360 

Figure 1. Relationship between water loss and mechanical impedance for a set of pots 361 

used in the experiments. 362 

Figure 2. Relationship between initial moisture of the seal and mechanical impedance, 363 

taking into account the emergence of the seedlings (no / yes) for the various initial soil 364 

moisture contents. 365 

Figure 3. Fitted curves obtained using a binary logistic regression model for Flax and 366 

Turnip at 3 levels of initial soil moisture content. Continuous lines represent the fit 367 

obtained for the probability of the seedling emergence as a function of the initial seal 368
