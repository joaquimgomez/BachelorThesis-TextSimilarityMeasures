We present numerical results for a chemical reaction of colloidal particles which are transported by
a laminar fluid and are focused by periodic obstacles in such a way that the two components are well
mixed and consequently the chemical reaction is speeded up. The roles of the various system param-
eters (diffusion coefficients, reaction rate, and obstacles sizes) are studied. We show that focusing
speeds up the reaction from the diffusion limited rate ∼t−1/2 to very close to the perfect mixing rate,
∼t−1. © 2013 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4799875]

I. INTRODUCTION

The motion of colloidal particles on modulated surfaces
has attracted a great deal of attention in the past decade.1–6

The interest in this subject has mainly been directed at sort-
ing phenomena, and a considerable portion of the work has
been experimental. The work has focused on mixtures of
particles which are sorted into separate streams of different
species when the mixture is transported under laminar condi-
tions along a structured or modulated medium with periodic
obstacles or traps. In this scenario it is possible to control the
transport of materials such as DNA fragments or functional-
ized biological colloidal particles. The modulated surfaces are
specifically designed to present periodic arrays of traps2, 3 or
microfabricated obstacles4 among other configurations. This
technique can be applied not only to solid spherical particles
but also to other objects such as cells, proteins, DNA, and
droplets in immiscible fluids.7 Theoretical studies comple-
mented with stochastic simulations have received consider-
able attention.9–11 Other sorting methods based on inertia and
hydrodynamics have also been explored.8 The sorting phe-
nomenon consists of a lateral or orthogonal displacement of
the particles with respect to the driving force or velocity di-
rection of the fluid mixture. The deviation of the particles in
a mixture from the direction of flow of the mixture depends
on some property or group of properties of the particles such
as size, mass, or charge, causing the particles with different
values of these properties to flow in different directions.

The same principle can be used to achieve the converse
effect, namely, to focus particles coming from different direc-
tions and mix them if the modulated structure of obstacles or
traps is prepared accordingly.5 Focusing of particles is useful
in a number of different scenarios such as counting, detecting,
and mixing.6 This property has special relevance in the lami-
nar regime, where slow molecular diffusion makes it difficult
to concentrate and mix particles.

Our particular focus in this work lies in using this
methodology to mix reactants in order to speed their reaction.
It is our objective to show that using an appropriate modulated

or structured surface of obstacles one can concentrate two re-
actants in a very small domain, thus favoring their chemical
reaction. Our main result is that reactants that arise from non-
homogeneous distributions can be efficiently mixed and as a
result are able to reach the classical law of mass action re-
action regime characterized by the reactant concentration de-
cay law ∼t−1 much sooner than they would in the absence of
a mixing mechanism. We present results on the efficiency of
some obstacle geometries toward this purpose. We discuss the
roles of the different control parameters and of the densities,
the diffusion coefficients of the different species, the reaction
rates, and the particle and obstacle sizes.

Our presentation proceeds as follows. First in Sec. II we
begin with the description of the continuous dynamical sce-
nario and present the associated dynamical equations which
contain diffusion, advection and reaction terms. In Sec. III
we present numerical results from the simulation of the equa-
tions and thereby analyze the roles of the different parameters.
Finally we close with some conclusions and perspectives in
Sec. IV.

II. DYNAMICAL MODEL

The theoretical scenario is the overdamped advective
reaction–diffusion model of chemical kinetics corresponding
to the simple irreversible reaction A + B → 0. We note that
the reactive particles are Brownian colloidal particles, much
larger than the solvent molecules with which they collide.
Thus the mean free path is very small, of the order of molecu-
lar distances in the solvent. This is the standard common jus-
tification for a formulation in terms of continuous equations
for concentration fields. Moreover, the overdamped Brownian
motion is justified by calculating the Reynolds number, which
for a length scale of 10 μm and velocities of order 100 μm/s
in water is of order 10−3.

The dynamical equations for the two reactants are

cb(x, y; t) = −∇Jb(x, y; t) − kcacb, (1b)

where ca and cb are the time dependent local concentrations
of the reactants A and B, k is the reaction rate constant, and
Ja, Jb are the fluxes of the reactants. The latter are given by

Ja(x, y; t) = ca(x, y; t)v(x, y; t) − Da∇ca − U0ca∇U,
(2a)

Jb(x, y; t) = cb(x, y; t)v(x, y; t) − Db∇cb − U0cb∇U.
(2b)

Here Da and Db are the diffusion coefficients, U0U(x/λ, y/λ)
is the modulated potential interaction due to obstacles, and
v(x/λ, y/λ) is the local velocity responsible for the advective
flux, which we assume to be a Hele-Shaw flow (that is, a flow
between two very close parallel plates). We have explicitly
extracted the amplitude U0 of the potential so that U(x/λ, y/λ)
is the potential of unit amplitude. This potential is modeled by
placing a circular tower at each obstacle, which changes from
unit value at the center of the disk defining the base of the
obstacle to a zero value outside the range of the interaction.
Specifically, it is modeled by the expression

U (r) =

where Rk, k = 1 . . . N, are the positions of the centers of the
N obstacles of base radius a, d > a is the radius of the in-
teraction, and δ is the (small) scale that characterizes a sub-
stantial change in the value of the potential. To take into ac-
count the finite size of the advected particles in a model with
a continuous concentration field we have introduced an inter-
action potential with a radius d larger than the obstacle radius
a. The distance d − a then represents the particle radius (see
Fig. 1). The potential range d corresponds to the minimum
distance between the centers of the colloidal particle and the
obstacle, and hence is the sum of their radii. The flow field
is obtained by solving the Laplace equation with boundary
conditions that reflect the presence of N circular obstacles of
radius a, but neglecting any effects that the advected particles

we have moved to the Appendix.

and the concentrations and derivative operators are also di-
mensionless. We fix the parameters D̂i = 0.01, v = 1, and
Û0 = 0.01 throughout the paper. From now on for simplic-
ity of notation we drop the primes on x′ and y′ and alert the
reader not to confuse x and y as used henceforth with the orig-
inal variables.

The equations are simulated on a two-dimensional lattice
of Nx = 1000, Ny = 300 cell centers, and cell dimensions (di-
mensionless quantities) �x = �y = 0.05, which corresponds
to system dimensions lx = 50 and ly = 15. Our integration
time step is �τ = 5 × 10−4. The dynamical evolution is re-
ported every 5 time units up to a final time τ = 60.

Figure 1 shows the role of one obstacle, the flow lines,
and the finite size of a colloidal particle. When the particle fol-
lowing a flux line is close to the obstacle its trajectory changes
to a different flow line pointing away from the obstacle. The
result is a lateral deviation of the particle from the initial flow
line as it circumnavigates the obstacle. In the presence of sev-
eral obstacles, and depending on their specific spatial distri-
bution, these deviations can favor focusing and hence acceler-
ate the reaction. To check this hypothesis we have employed
two obstacle patterns, one with 293 obstacles in a tilted peri-
odic pattern (PP), as shown in Fig. 2, and a second one with
the same number of obstacles but distributed randomly over
the same area (random pattern, RP). We have also performed

some simulations with no pattern (NP). We have mainly used
obstacles of radius a = 0.15 and an interaction potential ra-
dius d = 0.25, which corresponds to a radius d − a = 0.10 of
reacting particles. We have also used the values a = 0.10, 0.05
and d = 0.20 in some cases in order to study the dependence
of the results on these parameters. We have also performed
some simulations in which the flow is not affected by the ob-
stacles and thus the particles move at a constant velocity, i.e.,
v = constant (a = 0), see below. This is done because in pre-
vious calculations concerning flows of particle mixtures over
surfaces with obstacles we did not take the effect of the ob-
stacles on the flow field into account.9–11 Here we have the
opportunity to assess the importance of doing so (see below).

We are interested in a number of observables along the
flow direction, and not in a direction perpendicular to the flow,
which we integrate over. The observables we focus on are the
local reaction rate R(x),

R(x) = k
∫

dy ca(x, y)cb(x, y) (7)

and the total flux as a function of the position x,

J (x, t) =
∫

dy[Jx,a(x, y, t) + Jx,b(x, y; t)]. (8)

From this quantity the reaction efficiency at a long time (here
taken as τ = 60) is evaluated comparing the fluxes of non
reacted particles at two points, x = 0.5 and x = 40,

η(k) = 1 − J (x = 40)
J (x = 0.5) . (9)

In Fig. 2 we present the two-dimensional landscape in
which the advection, diffusion, and reaction of the two com-
ponents A and B takes place. One can see the periodic and
tilted structure of the circular obstacles. Figure 3 (top) shows
the distribution of both concentrations at time τ = 60. It is
clear that the obstacles focus the concentrations toward the
center line, where most of the reaction process takes place.
This situation should be compared with the case of randomly
distributed obstacles, Fig. 3 (bottom).

III. ANALYSIS OF NUMERICAL RESULTS

In Fig. 4 we present initial and final concentration pro-
files. The left column shows the effect of obstacles on the flow

of reactants in the absence of a reaction (k̂ = 0). From top to
bottom we see the reactant flow patterns when the obstacles
are placed in the PP, in the RP, and without obstacles, that is,
no pattern (NP). We clearly see the strong focusing effect of
the PP geometry compared to the other cases. In the right col-
umn we see the same three cases but now the two species are
allowed to react with rate coefficient k̂ = 0.2. The reaction
clearly proceeds much more rapidly when the reactants are
focused by the obstacles. The reaction in the presence of ran-
dom obstacles and of no obstacles occurs more slowly and at
comparable speeds in the two cases, the former slightly more
rapidly than the latter. In Fig. 5 the local reaction rate R(x)
given in Eq. (7) and the flux J(x) of Eq. (9) in the steady state
are plotted for the focusing geometry (PP) along the flow di-
rection. We observe repeated positions at which the reaction is
more efficient. These points correspond to rows where the in-
nermost focusing obstacles are the closest together. This result
opens the possibility of alternative patterns with more active
reaction domains. The flux is shown for the focusing obstacle
geometry for a number of rate coefficients and is seen to be
a monotonically decaying function of position. For the focus-
ing obstacle geometry with k̂ = 0.2, for instance, we calculate
a reaction efficiency of ∼85%, a fairly high value for such a
relatively small system.

In Fig. 6 we explore the dependence of the efficiency on
the reaction parameter k̂. We see that the efficiency comes
close to a maximum value around k̂ = 0.2, with little im-
provement above that. This almost-independence of the rate
coefficient is an interesting unanticipated feature.

It is informative to compare this efficiency with that ob-
tained in the most effective case, that is, that of perfect (to-
tally homogeneous) mixing. In this case, assuming equal ini-
tial concentrations ca = cb = c. the reaction equation is

dc

dτ
= −k̂c2. (10)

Its solution is

c(τ )

c(0)
= 1

1 + c(0)k̂τ
. (11)

We choose the comparison time τ = 40. If we further
choose c(0) = 1 and k̂ = 0.25, we find that c(40)/c(0) = 1/11
which gives an efficiency η = 0.91. This an upper bound for
this setup. The focusing configuration thus leads to almost
perfect mixing.

We can use this result to obtain an analytic estimate for
the efficiency. If we take the velocity of the flowing compo-
nents ∼1 we can substitute time for space, τ = x/v. We ex-
pect the flux to have a functional form similar to that of the
concentration in Eq. (11), and thus we propose the following
expression for the efficiency at xF:

η(xF , k̂) =
ak̂xF

1 + bk̂xF
, (12)

with parameters a and b to be fitted. A nonlinear fit to our
numerical data yields a = 1.085 and b = 1.195 (PP), a
= 0.358 and b = 0.788 (RP), and a = 0.105 and b = 0.325
(NP). In Fig. 6 we have plotted this function for xF = 40. This
numerical result implies that most of the reacted matter was in

the perfect mixing regime characterized by the decay ∼τ−1.
This is an unexpected result because of the inhomogeneous
concentrations in this system. It tells us that the reaction is
dominated by the small domains near the center of the array
where there is quasi-perfect mixing, as is seen in Fig. 3.

To complete our analysis, we will explore the effects on
these results of varying the diffusion coefficient (assumed to
be the same for both species), the focusing pattern geometry,
and the sizes of obstacles and particles.

In the left panel of Fig. 7 we present the effect of the dif-
fusion parameter. It is useful here to compare the diffusion
length of the Brownian particles with the distance between
obstacles. The diffusion length in a two-dimensional system
is given by λD =

FIG. 6. Reaction efficiency versus reaction rate constant k̂ at the final po-
sition xF = 40 (τ = 60) for the periodic pattern (PP, diamonds), random
pattern (RP, circles), and without obstacles (NP, triangles). The dashed line
corresponds to the reaction efficiency for perfect mixing, cf. Eq. (11). The
full lines are the fittings of Eq. (12).

d between two obstacles is tr = d/v. It thus follows that λD
= √4Dd/v, and the diffusion length compared to this dis-
tance is λD/d � 0.2 where we have used the simulation values
D = 0.01, d = 1, v = 1. The diffusion length is thus smaller
than the period d of the lattice. In this limit the advective
motion of the particles dominates against diffusion, which is
precisely the limit in which experimental sorting1–4, 9–11 and
focusing5 work well. Figure 7 (left panel) quantifies the rel-
evance of diffusion in the reaction efficiency in our focusing
scenario. We see in the inset how the larger is the diffusion
the lower is the efficiency.

In the right panel of Fig. 7 we present three fluxes that
correspond to different geometries. We see that the flux with
the focusing pattern decays faster than the random pattern
which is also more effective than no pattern at all.

Finally we discuss the effect of the parameters d (radius
of potential interaction) and a (radius of the obstacles) on the
reaction efficiency. From Fig. 8 we can see that the stronger
effect comes from the change in the parameter d. A compar-
ison of pairs of curves with a common value of a shows that
the reactant flux is strongly reduced by increasing d from 0.20
to 0.25. This reduction in the flux implies an increment in the
efficiency (see inset of Fig. 8), as follows. Returning to Fig. 1,
we see that larger d means that more stream lines of the liq-
uid flow are affected by the potential, and as a consequence
more particles traveling along the stream lines are deviated.
Moreover, the deviation of each particle will be greater, that
is, particles are moved to further stream lines. An increase of
d then clearly produces a larger focussing effect of the react-
ing particles, and as a consequence the reaction is enhanced.
Note that such a change in the parameter d with fixed a cor-
responds to a change in the particle radius d − a (a change
in the reactants) while maintaining the same pattern of
obstacles. Similar results were obtained experimentally in
Ref. 5, where focusing was observed only for large enough
particles.

Next we fix the parameter d and explore the role of the
parameter a. In Fig. 8 we see that an increase in a reduces the

efficiency (see inset). The explanation again lies in the fact
that the obstacles lead to a deformation of the stream lines (see
Fig. 1), and this effect is stronger for larger a. With a stronger
deformation the stream lines are displaced further from the
obstacles, and as a result more particles can escape from the
action of the interaction potential, whose range d is now held
fixed. As a consequence the increase of a at fixed d reduces
the focussing effect of the pattern and hence the reaction effi-
ciency decreases.

Perhaps most interesting from an experimental point of
view is to analyze the effect of varying both a and d while
maintaining their difference constant. This corresponds to
changing the dimensions of the obstacles, easily modified in

FIG. 8. Comparison of fluxes obtained by using patterns with different radii
of obstacles a and of potential range d. Solid lines: d = 0.20; dashed lines: d
= 0.25. For each d value, different values of obstacle radius are represented:

an experiment, while keeping the particle radius d − a con-
stant. This would be the scenario in which one attempts to op-
timize the reaction process for given reactive species. In Fig. 8
we can compare the case d = 0.20, a = 0.10 with the case d
= 0.25, a = 0.15, which corresponds to changing the obstacle
size with a common particle radius of d − a = 0.10. Results
in the figure show that the increase of obstacle size in this ex-
ample clearly reduces the reactant flux and hence improves
the reaction efficiency.

As a last test, we have compared these results to those
of approximation in which the deformation of the fluid flow
is neglected, i.e., in which the flow velocity is taken to be
constant and only the scale d of the interaction potential is
taken into account. In Fig. 1 this situation would correspond
to straight, horizontal stream lines. This approximation was
used in our previous work on particle sorting,9–11 and in our
present scheme corresponds to the limit a = 0. In this situ-
ation the stream lines are not deformed and hence a larger
number of particles are deviated by the potential. In Fig. 8 we
see the expected result, namely, that this approximation over-
estimates the reaction efficiency when compared to a finite a
value (for a given value of d). For the smallest values of a (ob-
stacles smaller than the particles) this approximation does not
qualitatively change the focussing scenario, but as a increases
the importance of including the effects of advection clearly
increases.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Obstacles placed in carefully selected geometrical pat-
terns have been used in the past to effectively separate col-
loidal mixtures that are caused to flow over a surface con-
taining such obstacles. In this paper we have explored the
converse, namely, the possibility of speeding up the mixing
of components that undergo advective diffusion over a sur-
face containing carefully situated obstacles. We have illus-
trated the effects of this mixing by considering the reaction of

two species and comparing the reaction rates when the species
are allowed to mix by ordinary advective diffusion in the ab-
sence and presence of these obstacles. We have shown that a
periodic pattern of tilted obstacles, as opposed to a random
placement, is able to effectively focus the streams of reac-
tive species. We have furthermore shown that this focusing
mechanism leads rather rapidly to reaction rates comparable
to those obtained with perfect mixing. We have studied the
dependence of the reaction efficiency on the different param-
eters of the problem. We interpret the focusing mechanism
as a consequence of the finite size of the reacting particles.
These results could be useful for the design and interpretation
of new experiments.

APPENDIX: NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE
HELE-SHAW PROBLEM WITH CIRCULAR
OBSTACLES

We will consider a fluid contained between two paral-
lel plates, separated by a gap d (Hele-Shaw cell). In the limit
of small d the velocity field u can be considered as two-
dimensional, and is given by

u = − d
2

12μ
∇p, (A1)

which is identical to the Darcy’s law for the flow in a porous
medium. μ is the viscosity of the fluid and p is the pressure,
which satisfies ∇2p = 0. We place N circular obstacles or
disks of radius a centered at positions Rk, k = 1 . . . N. The
velocity of the fluid far from the obstacles is u∞. At the rigid
boundaries the velocity satisfies the condition of zero nor-
mal component, but not the no-slip boundary condition.
The stream lines passing the obstacles are identical to
those of a two-dimensional inviscid fluid with the same
geometry.12

The velocity field can be written in terms of the velocity
potential φ as

u = ∇φ, (A2)
which obeys the Laplace equation

∇2φ = 0. (A3)
The general solution of the 2D Laplace equation (A3) can

be written in polar coordinates as

φ(r, θ )=

)−λ)
(bλ1e

iλθ + bλ2e−iλθ ),
(A4)

where aλi, bλi are constants that depend on the boundary con-
ditions. It is easy to establish that for real φ these constants

should satisfy

aλ1bλ1 = (aλ1bλ2)∗, (A5)

aλ2bλ2 = (aλ2bλ1)∗. (A6)
We will use the multipole expansion (A4) for the velocity

field in the neighborhood of each disk, with the polar coordi-
nates centered at the disk. Hence we will have N such expan-
sions. The advantage of these expansions is that the boundary
conditions at the disks are easy to formulate. In particular, the
normal velocity vanishes, that is,

∂φ

∂r

∣∣∣∣
r=a

= 0 (A7)

and then, taking into account the conditions Eqs. (A5) and
(A6) we get

aλ1 = aλ2 = 1, (A8)

bλ1 = b∗λ2 ≡ bλ. (A9)
We still have to find one set of bλ constants for each disk k (k
= 1 . . . N), which we will denote as bλ(k).

We next consider the ensemble of N disks. All multi-
pole expansions should simultaneously satisfy boundary con-
ditions on all the discs and at infinity. It is convenient to em-
ploy a complex variable for the position, i.e., we define the
complex position r̃ as

r̃ = x + yi. (A10)
Henceforth a tilde on any vector will denote a similar defini-
tion as a complex variable. By employing this notation, the
general solution Eq. (A4) can be expressed more compactly
as a series of powers of r̃ .

Note that each expansion (A4) is valid near the corre-
sponding disk, but not far from it. In particular the expansions
diverge at infinity. The way to manage an expression for the
potential valid at arbitrary distances is to use only the decreas-
ing powers of the multipole expansions, adding the terms cor-
responding to all the disks. Taking into account the boundary
condition at infinity we can then write

φ(r) = r · u∞ +
N∑

k=1
φk(r), (A11)

where φk(r) is the distortion of the potential produced by the
disc k, which will have the form

φk(r) =

Here r̃k = r̃ − R̃k is the position relative to the center of
disk k, and the cλ(k) are constants. With this expression the
boundary condition at infinity has already been taken into ac-
count. To find the unknowns cλ(k) we should make this ex-
pansion compatible with those of each disk, Eq. (A4), which

To relate the expansion Eq. (A11) with Eq. (A12) to those

of Eq. (A13), it is convenient to use the Taylor expansion of
the negative powers of r̃k (position relative to disk k) in terms
of the positive powers of r̃j (position relative to any other disk
j �= k). The idea is that the positive powers in the local expan-
sion Eq. (A13) of any disk should correspond to the terms
coming from the rest of the disks in Eq. (A11). That is, we
write(

These equation can be solved to obtain the constants cλ(j)
with which the potential and the velocity field can be calcu-
lated through Eq. (A11). In practice one can use a few mul-
tipole terms, λ = 1 . . . λmax, for a moderate value of λmax
since the series converge rapidly (more terms are necessary
as the distances between disks are decreased). The procedure
involves finding cλ(j) only once, and permits us to find fluid
velocity at any position by only summing a few contributions
from each disk.

A dipolar approximation (λmax = 1) provides reasonably
good results if the disks are not very close to each other, and
its solution can be used as an initial step of an iterative solu-
tion of the complete problem. This solution reads

To solve Eqs. (A23) and (A24), an iterative method can
be used. These equations can be formulated as a matrix
relation,

C = AC∗ + B, (A26)
where C is a vector containing all the cλ(k) coefficients. Then
we can apply the following iteration, which can be shown to
be convergent:

Ci = AC∗i−1 + B, (A27)
with the initial term C0 given by the dipolar approximation
Eq. (A21).
