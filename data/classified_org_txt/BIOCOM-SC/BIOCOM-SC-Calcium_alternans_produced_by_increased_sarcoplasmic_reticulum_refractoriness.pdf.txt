Abstract 

Despite the important role of electro-mechanical 

alternans in cardiac arrhythmogenesis, its molecular 

origin is not well understood. In this paper we want to 

study alternans that can be associated with alternations 

in the cytosolic calcium transient. To this end we study 

particularly, how a malfunction of Ryanodine Receptor  

(RyR) recovery time from inactivation may induce beat-

to-beat alternations in intracellular calcium 

concentration and how this could affect the stimulus 

propagation in inhomogeneous tissue, whose cells exhibit 

different calcium dynamics. 

 

1. Introduction 

Cardiac arrhythmias are often associated with 

irregularities in intracellular calcium dynamics, which is 

coupled with the transmembrane voltage. A prominent 

example of this is the presence of calcium alternans, a 

beat-to-beat alternation in the level of intracellular 

calcium concentration [1]. Numerous experimental 

studies have shown that isolated cardiac cells, when 

paced rapidly or pharmacologically stressed, exhibit a 

beat-to-beat alternation in both the action potential 

duration (APD) and the intracellular Ca transient [2-4]. 

The mechanism responsible for this irregular rhythm is 

not well understood. Alternans at the single cell level can 

be caused by unstable membrane voltage (V) dynamics 

linked to steep APD-restitution, or unstable intracellular 

calcium (Ca
2+

). The existence of a dynamical instability 

of Ca cycling independent of V dynamics has been 

clearly demonstrated by experiments [5,6], where 

alternans of intracellular Ca
2+

 can occur even though the 

membrane V is periodically clamped. 

 A possible explanation has been given in terms of 

fluctuations in the Ca
2+

 content of the Sarcoplasmic 

Reticulum (SR), at fast pacing rates, in which the 

Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca
2+

-ATPase (SERCA) 

does not have enough time to refill completely the SR 

before the next excitation. Coupled with a steep SR 

calcium load - calcium release relationship, this has been 

shown to give rise to sustained alternans. However, 

alternans has also been observed in experiments in which 

the SR content remains constant in successive beats [7]. 

Thus, it has been hypothesized that other mechanisms, 

related with calcium release restitution, must underlie the 

changes in cytosolic calcium dynamics. We investigate 

calcium alternans in a situation when the SERCA pump is 

able to rapidly eliminate calcium from the cytoplasm and 

fully recover the same SR calcium level before the next 

voltage activation.  

We show in this work that calcium alternans appears 

under these circumstances if the recovery from 

inactivation of the Ryanodine Receptors (RyR) 

malfunctions and becomes too slow. This agrees with 

post-rest potentiation experiments that show that several 

seconds are needed to recover full SR calcium depletion 

[7]. We then analyze the arrhythmogenic implications of 

our results, by performing simulations of action potential 

propagation in tissue, using a model for an atrial myocyte 

[8]
 

with modified calcium dynamics. We
 

describe in 

detail how the presence of alternans affects the stimulus 

propagation in inhomogeneous tissue in which cells with 

different calcium dynamics are present. Depending on the 

size and spatial distribution of the region with alternans, 

they produce local conduction block and reentry due to 

dispersion in action potential duration [9]. We analyze 

different distributions, and the minimum size that gives 

rise to conduction block. 

 

2. Methods 

We used a monodomain tissue model representing a 

2D sheet of human atria myocyctes with isotropic 

diffusion, a diffusion coefficient of D=1.00 cm
2
 s

-1
, and a 

specific capacitance of Cm=1 たF cm
-2

. This model was 

solved using an explicit finite difference scheme with a 

space step of dx=0.025 cm, and time step dt=0.01 ms. 

The 2D simulations were performed in a rectangular 

region of dimensions Lx=2.25 cm, Ly=3 cm. No-flux 
boundary conditions were imposed at each edge. The 

model by Nygren et al [8] was modified [10] in order to 

reproduce calcium alternans at high pacing rhythms, as 

has been observed in experiments [4]. The modified 

model [10] includes three different compartments (Fig. 

ISSN 0276−6574 645 Computing in Cardiology 2011;38:645−648.



1A): i) a dyadic (junctional) space with the presence of 

LCC and RyR channels, ii) a subsarcolemmal space 

where the other transmembrane currents act, and iii) the 

bulk cytosolic compartment where the calcium 

concentration transient is caused by diffusion from the 

subsarcolemma and luminal calcium eflux from the SR 

through the RyR channels, as in [11]. For the RyR 

dynamics we consider a markovian four state model 

based on the one in Ref. [12] (see Figure 1B), with the 

parameters used in Ref. [13]. The SR Ca release includes 

inactivation/adaptation and SR Ca load dependence of 

activation and inactivation. The model reproduces the 

nonlinear dependence of gain and fractional SR Ca 

release upon SR Ca load. At fast pacing it presents 

alternans, due to slow recovery from inactivation of the 

RyR.

employed by the cell model. B) Diagram of the Markov 

model for the state of the RyR. The states I1, I2, C, O, are 

similar to those employed and discussed in other models 

[12,13]. The dynamics of activation (opening), 

inactivation and recovery of the RyR is given by the rates 

k2, k-2, and k-6.  The recovery time is defined as the 

inverse of the recovery rate tREC=1/k-6. The subindex k in 

Ca refers to the dyadic or bulk cytosolic space.  

 

The model is simulated first for a single cell, to fit the 

original intracellular calcium values given by Nygren et 

al [8]. Once the single cell model matched the results in 

[8], but exhibiting also alternant behaviour, we explored 

the effect on voltage propagation in tissue, due to the 

alternant-type cells �cluster� size, alongside the 

conditions under which full or partial signal blocking 

could occur.  

First, in order to investigate the conditions under which 

conduction block occurs, we divided the domain into 

three regions of two different types (see Fig. 3A). Type I 

region is populated with cells of regular behaviour, 

separated by a strip of width h perpendicular to the 

propagation direction of the AP waves (Fig 3A), and 

populated with cells exhibiting alternans (type II cells). 

By varying the width h of the strip we determined the 

critical size for which the system undergoes a transition 

from a full blocking regime to a stable local 2:1 block 

regime.  

Then, in order to establish the effect of blocking in the 

formation of arrhythmias, different shaped areas of type II 

cells were also tested. 

Finally, numerical ECG's were obtained using the 

�dipole� formula [14], ECG= ∫(D〉V·r/r2)dx, where  
r=rtissue-rp, and rp denotes the point at which the ECG is 

calculated. 

 

 

3. Results  

In Fig. 2 we show typical action potentials and calcium 

transients for type I and type II cells. From there it can be 

seen that a modification in the refractoriness of the RyR 

in type II cells results in electromechanical alternans.   

 

Figure 2: Single cell action potentials and calcium 

concentration in the dyadic space for two values of the 

refractoriness parameter tREC=200 ms (type I cell) and 750 

ms (type II cell), giving rise to a regular calcium 

dynamics (dashed line) and alternans (solid line). The 

stimulus period was set to TS= 220 ms. 

 

 

Distributing cells as shown in Fig. 3A, we were able to 

determine the minimum size h of the region with 

alternanting cells that results in conduction block. In these 

simulations the tissue is stimulated from the upper side, at 

a pacing period of TS=220 ms. As the AP wave 

646



propagates through the area that presents alternans, the 

duration of the AP changes. In particular, after a long AP 

in this region, the recovery time for the following wave 

becomes smaller, resulting in conduction delay and 

eventually conduction block. When this zone is small, 

diffusive effects smear out the gradient in transmembrane 

voltage, and the waves propagate through it. As the size 

of zone II is increased, gradients of repolarization 

develop, and the waves following a long calcium transient 

start to be delayed, up to a point beyond which 

conduction block is produced (Fig. 3B). In our 

simulations, for h=1.5 cm there is an irregular behaviour, 

with intermittent conduction blocks, while for h=2.0cm 

there is a 2:1 blockade. We have also computed the 

electro cardiogram (ECG) corresponding to this situation 

(Fig. 3B), clearly showing the transition from normal 

stimulus propagation, to irregular blockade and to 2:1 

block. Although not shown here, we have tested that this 

minimum size depends also on the alternans region 

geometry and its position with respect to the stimulation 

site [10].

different regions, with and without alternans 

(respectively, zones II and I). B) Virtual ECGs 

corresponding to simulations with a central region of 

width h=1.25cm, 1.5cm, and 2.0 cm.  The stimulus period 

TS =220 ms and recording site rP =(1.125, 1.5, 0.025) cm. 

 

 

Once we know the typical size of the region with 

alternans that produces conduction block, we have studied 

the case of a tissue paced from one corner, that presents a 

circular region of these characteristics (see Fig. 4). As 

shown, the ensuing dispersion of repolarization is enough 

to produce localized block and the induction of reentry. 

This is also evident in the corresponding ECG in Fig. 4, 

for a case in which reentry disappeared spontaneously. 

 

 

4. Discussions and conclusions 

There is increasing evidence that anomalies in the RyR 

dynamics can result in a proarrhythmic substrate. One of 

the ways this occurs is through the induction of calcium

that alternans are develop in a circular region of side 

R=0.5cm (dashed line). As the waves go pass this region, 

they get delayed, until at some point, localized conduction 

block is produced. In the lower panel we show the 

corresponding virtual ECG.

alternans that, due to the action of the sodium-calcium 

exchanger, change the duration of the action potential. 

Once they appear, AP alternans can be concordant (with 

the AP at a certain beat being either long or short, but 

homogeneous in all tissue) or discordant, with the 

formation of defect lines that separate regions oscillating 

out of phase. It is, in fact, close to these defect lines that 

strong dispersion of repolarization can be created, 

resulting in localized block and reentry. In AP alternans 

driven by an instability in voltage (for instance, due to 

steep AP restitution), the origin of discordant alternans 

can be traced back to a dynamic instability related with 

conduction velocity restitution [15].  

In this paper we have considered an alternative 

mechanism that can create dispersion of repolarization 

(with its subsequent proarrhythmic effects): a 

heterogeneous distribution in the dynamical 

characteristics that regulate the appearance of alternans in 

the dynamics of intracellular calcium. In particular, we 

have considered the proarrythmic effect of a spatial 

heterogeneity in the refractoriness of the RyR. We have 

considered first the idealized situation of an abrupt 

change in RyR refractoriness in a region of tissue, and 

confirmed that this results in a large dispersion of 

refractoriness in the border region, that gives rise to 

conduction block as its width is increased. Depending on 

the size of the alternans region, there maybe delayed 

conduction (for small sizes), localized block at every 

other beat (for large sizes), or a complex behaviour with 

blocks occurring at intermittent intervals (for intermediate 

sizes).  Then, we have shown that this can result naturally 

in reentry, considering a circular region with intracellular 

calcium alternans in an otherwise normal tissue.
