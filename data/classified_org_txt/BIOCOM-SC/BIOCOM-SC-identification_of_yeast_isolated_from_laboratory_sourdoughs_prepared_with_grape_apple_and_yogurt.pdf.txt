INTRODUCTION 

 

When bakers, whether industrial or artisan, set about making sourdough bread it 

is because they wish to achieve several objectives. Among others, bakers want to 
make a type of bread with enhanced acidity, and a distinctive taste and flavour. 

Sourdough is distinguished from other bread ferments, because the microbiota is 

composed of a population of both lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast. The 
isolation and application of molecular techniques for the identification of these 

microorganisms enables us to improve our knowledge of this singular and 

complex ecosystem. Regional Spanish bakers value keeping the sourdough 
fermented for years, without using an initial starter. They only prepare it again 

when they consider that a sensory quality deviation is produced. Nowadays, there 

is a trend to prepare the liquid ferment, blocking its activity by applying lower 
temperatures to decrease the refreshments frequency, instead of maintaining solid 

ferment with several daily refreshments. Some bakers maintain several 

sourdoughs at the same time, initiated with special ingredients, or using different 
types of cereal flours. Such applications are aimed to bread products, with 

variable proportions of ferment, and some sweet elaboration as the panettone. 

Sourdough can be initiated spontaneously using different ingredients, but cereal 
flour (most frequently wheat or rye) and water are common to every formulation. 

In all protocols, the subsequent phases involve trying to achieve a stable ripe 

sourdough (mother dough). After the initial preparation and prefermentation of 
the sourdough, the refreshment technique is aimed at maintaining the metabolic 

activity of the microbial communities at all times. Generally, a ripe sourdough 

contains a variable amount of lactic acid bacteria and yeast, ranging from 10
7
 to 

10
9 

CFU/g and 10
5
 to 10

7
 CFU/g, respectively, with a ratio of about 100:1 

(Gobbetti, 1998). The final pH, which ranges from 3.5 to 4.3, is usually 

considered an index of well-developed sourdough fermentation (Collar et al., 
1994). 

LAB comprise a large heterogeneous group of Gram-positive, non-sporulating, 

and strictly fermentative lactic acid-producing bacteria. It is a group that includes 
a broad number of genera and species. Although the LAB sourdough microbiota 

is clearly dominated by Lactobacillus, other less predominant or subdominant 

LAB species may also be found, including members of the genera Weissella, 
Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus (De 

Vuyst and Neysens 2005; Huys et al., 2013).  

Yeasts are unicellular fungi, and in sourdough various different genera have been 
detected. A recent review (Huys et al., 2013) based on some 40 original 

publications — from the early 1970s, and from different, mainly European, 

countries (particularly Italy) — listed Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida 
humilis (syn. Candida milleri), Pichia kudriavzevii, Kazachstania exigua (syn. S. 

exiguus), Torulaspora delbrueckii and Wickerhamomyces anomalus (syn. P. 

anomala, Hansenula anomala) as the six most frequently encountered species; 
other species are less frequently detected in sourdough, namely Candida 

glabrata, Pichia membranifaciens, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, 

Candida stellate, Kazachstania unispora, Kluyveromyces marxianus, 
Meyerozyma guilliermondii and Saccharomyces pastorianus. 

Yeasts contribute, more than LAB, to the leavening capability of the dough by 

releasing CO2 from alcoholic fermentation. The yeast leavening capacity varies 
between species and strains and is affected by the LAB metabolism and bread 

fermentation process conditions (Häggman and Salovaara, 2008a,b). 

Sourdough leavened products, compared to purely yeast leavened products, 
increase the shelf life (Galle and Arendt, 2014), and have significant impact on 

nutritional properties, especially when whole flour is employed (Poutanen et al., 

2009). Another important contribution of sourdough yeast, as well as LAB, is to 
produce different volatile compounds that improve and increase the sourdough 

taste and flavour. These compounds vary in kind, concentration, and according to 

strain (Damiani et al., 1996).  
The aims of this study were: i) to identify and describe the collection of yeast 

strains from three spontaneous laboratory sourdoughs prepared using a traditional 

Spanish protocol, each one elaborated with different initial ingredients, such as 
apples (5 days juice fermented at 40ºC), yogurt, and grapes (2 days must 

fermented at 20ºC), and ii) to evaluate the role of these ingredients in the 

diversity of microbiota yeast sourdough. The use of apple and yogurt is common 
in Spanish bakeries; nevertheless that of grape is a more recent development. 

 

Yeast strains collected from three spontaneous laboratory sourdoughs, prepared over 10 days and using a traditional Spanish protocol, 

and formulated with (non-essential) different ingredients were identified and described. In addition to wheat flour (Triticum aestivum) 
and water, organic apples (5 days juice fermented at 40°C), or plain yogurt, or organic white grapes (2 days must fermented at 20°C) 

were used at the beginning of each sourdough production.  

One-hundred-eighteen yeast colonies were collected from the different phases of sourdoughs (ingredients preparation, pre-sourdough, 

and ripe sourdough propagation) using WL agar and Lysine agar media. Yeast isolates were clustered into 8 groups using PCR-RFLP 

analysis of the 5.8S-ITS rRNA region. One strain of each group was chosen for sequencing to confirm yeast identification at species 

level. The specifically prepared fruit ingredients, apple and grape, provided diversity of non-Saccharomyces yeast to the respective 

sourdoughs. The dominant species in the pre-sourdough phase were Meyerozyma guilliermondii for apple sourdough and 

Hanseniaspora uvarum for grape sourdough. For yogurt sourdough, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was already the dominant yeast in the 

pre-sourdough phase with a low proportion of Meyerozyma guilliermondii and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. In the three sourdoughs, 

regardless of the different ingredients used, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the dominant yeast in the ripe phase.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 

Origin of sourdoughs yeast collection 

 

The collection of sourdoughs yeast to be identified was composed of a total of 

118 strains. These yeasts came from the three types of spontaneous laboratory 

sourdoughs prepared, in duplicate, using a traditional Spanish multiphase 
protocol provided by an artisan bakery (‘Fleca Parés’, Vilafranca del Penedès, 

Catalonia, Spain). Each sourdough was started in a sterile container and then, 

they were prepared with a spiral kneader; the kneading shaft was cleaning 
meticulously and treated with water at 85°C. Sourdoughs were elaborated with 

wheat flour (Triticum aestivum) and using different initial ingredients such as 
organic apples, plain yogurt, and organic grapes as described by Gordún et al. 

(2015).  

The first sourdough phase was the preparation of the different ingredients 
(fermented apple juice and lightly fermented grape must). For apple sourdough 

(AS) small pieces of apple were fermented with unpasteurized honey and mineral 

water (ratio of 1:0.04:1, respectively) for 5 days at 40°C; and for grape 
sourdough (GS) grape must (Xarel·lo white grape variety from the Valldolina 

vineyard) was fermented for 2 days at 20ºC; this first phase was not performed 

for yogurt sourdough (YS).  
The second or pre-sourdough phase lasted for 5 days, for all three sourdoughs. 

This phase begins with the mixture of the specific ingredients and wholemeal 

flour (ratio of 3:1, respectively), leaving 48 hours at 22ºC to carry out the mixture 

fermentation. Later, three wheat flour and water renewals were carried out, in 

which fermentation and activity blocking periods were interspersed. Specifically, 

a part of the preceding dough was mixed with flour and mineral water (ratio of 
1:5:6, respectively) and left for 24hours at 22 °C; two more renewals were carried 

out, again mixing a part of the previous dough with flour and mineral water (ratio 

of 1:1.7:1.7, and 1:2.5:2.5, respectively) and both renewals they were left 2 hours 
at 22ºC and 22 hours at 5ºC. 

Later, throughout the third or ripe sourdough phase, the refreshment was done 

three times a day (at 9am, 1pm, and 5pm) for 5 days. Specifically for this, a part 
of the preceding sourdough was mixed with wheat flour and mineral water (ratio 

of 2:2:1, respectively), leaving 4 hours at 29ºC in the first two refreshments (at 

9am and 1pm) and in the third refreshment (5pm) (ratio of 1:2:1, respectively) 16 
hours at 29ºC. 

Samples were taken throughout the sourdough process; in the first phase from 

apple juice after 5 day fermentation and grape must after 2 day fermentation. 
Four samples of the second phase (named P1, P2, P3, P4) and five samples of the 

third phase at 9am (named R1, R2, R3, R4, R5) were analyzed. The sampling 

was done immediately after the fermentation period and before the renewal of the 
ingredients, with the exception of P1 that was analyzed after mixing the specific 

ingredients with the flour. 

As described by Gordún et al. (2015), for the counting and isolation of the yeasts 
from the different phases of three sourdoughs (AS, GS, and YS), 10 g of each 

sourdough sample was homogenized with 90 mL of saline Ringer ¼ solution 

(Scharlau, Spain) using a Stomacher apparatus (BagMixer® 400P, Interscience, 
Paris) for 2 min. Decimal dilutions were then made using the same solution and 

microbiological seeding was performed in duplicate on every agar plate: i) total 

yeast count on WL agar supplemented by 0.5 g/L chloramphenicol (Scharlau, 
Spain), and ii) non-Saccharomyces yeast on lysine agar (Scharlau, Spain). The 

yeast plates were incubated for 3 to 5 days at 27°C. After counting, yeast strains 

were selected based on their morphology or colony colour in order to represent 
the diversity of yeast sourdoughs. The yeasts were purified on Sabouraud agar 

(Scharlau, Spain) and stored at 4°C until identified.  

 

 

 

 

Yeast identification by 5.8S-ITS rRNA analysis and sequencing 

 

Yeast isolates were clustered by amplification and restriction of an rRNA gene 

region and representative isolates were identified to the species level by 

sequencing the 5.8S-ITS region. All yeast strains were incubated in YPD broth 

(2% glucose, 1 % yeast extract, 2% peptone w/v) at 28ºC for 48 hours and cells 

were collected by centrifugation. DNA was isolated according to Querol et al. 

(1992) and diluted to 1-50 ng/l. The rRNA gene region was amplified in a 

Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf). Primer pairs used to amplify the 5.8S-ITS 

region: ITS1 (5’-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3’) and ITS4 (5’-
TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’) have been described elsewhere (White et 

al., 1990). PCR reactions were as follows: a first step at 95ºC for 5 min, then 40 

cycles of 94ºC for 1 min, 55.5ºC for 2 min, and 72ºC for 2 min, with a final 
extension of 10 min at 72ºC. PCR products were digested without further 

purification by the endonuclease HinfI (New England Biolabs, Inc., Germany) 
according to the supplier’s instructions. Additionally, endonuclease Dde I and 

Mbo I (New England Biolabs, Inc. Germany) were used to better distinguish 

among Hanseniaspora species and Candida species, respectively. The PCR 
products and their restriction fragments were separated on 1.4 and 3% agarose 

gels, respectively, in 1x TBE buffer, stained with ethidium bromide and 

photographed under UV light. Fragment sizes were estimated by comparison 
against a 100-pb DNA ladder (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).  
Yeast isolates were grouped according their amplicon sizes and restriction 

fragment length polymorphism. One strain of each group was chosen for 

sequencing. PCR products of selected strains were cleaned with a QIAquick Gel 
extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and directly sequenced using the Bid Dye 

Terminator v 3.1 sequencing standard kit (Applied Biosystems) following the 

manufacturer’s instructions, in an automatic sequencer 3730 DNA analyser 
(Applied Biosystems). The amplicons were used as template for the sequencing 

reaction (BigDye, Qiagen, Germany), and the DNA fragments were sequenced 

(Secugen, Madrid, Spain). To sequence both strands, ITS1 and ITS4 primers 
were used. Sequences from the 5.8S-ITS region were aligned using the Vector 

NTI software (Life Technologies). Sequence comparisons were performed online 

using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) program (Altschul et al., 
1990) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Center 

for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 

Bethesda, MD). Strains were ascribed to the species based on comparisons with 
type strain sequences in (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

Identification of yeast strains isolated from sourdoughs  

 

A total of 118 yeast isolates were clustered using PCR-RFLP analysis of the 

5.8S-ITS rRNA region into eight groups. After analysis of their restriction 

fragment length polymorphism (Table 1) two of these groups — group: 
Hanseniaspora uvarum, and group: Saccharomyces cerevisiae — were identified 

at genus and species level respectively, by comparison of the size of restriction 

bands with those available in the literature (Cordero-Bueso et al., 2011; Esteve-
Zarzoso et al., 1999). The other six groups could not be identified by RFLP 

analysis. In order to recognize and confirm the species identification, especially 
when the 5.8S-ITS pattern had not been previously reported, one strain 

representing each group was selected for sequencing the 5.8S-ITS rRNA 

amplicon. Sequencing data revealed that the other yeast groups corresponded to 
Candida oleophila, Candida pararugosa, Cyberlindnera misumaiensis, 

Cystobasidium pinicola (syn. Rhodotorula pinicola), Meyerozyma guilliermondii, 

and Wickerhamomyces anomalus respectively, and confirmed the previous yeast 
identification (groups H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae).

Results from yeast sourdoughs are presented in Table 1. Thus, the different yeast 
groups were distributed specifically throughout the development of three types of 

sourdough prepared with different ingredients, such as apple, yogurt and grape. 

The results show that four of eight yeast species identified, C. oleophila, C. 
pararugosa, Cyb. misumaiensis and Cys. pinicola, would not form part of these 

sourdoughs because they were only identified in the apple ingredient, and not in 

fermented apple juice, which was used in the sourdough (Table 2). Only S. 
cerevisiae was present in all three types of the sourdough studied, including pre-

sourdough and the ripe sourdough phase. The other yeast species identified, H. 

uvarum, M. guilliermondii and W. anomalus, were mostly associated with a 
particular sourdough and its predominance varied with the phase of the 

sourdough.  
Other laboratory sourdoughs elaborated with durum wheat flour and with 

additional ingredients, as macerated pears, concentrated grape must, or 

unpasteurized honey, showed different strains of S. cerevisiae as dominant yeast 
microbiota in all mature sourdoughs (Minervini et al., 2016). 

 

Enumeration and yeast identification from apple sourdough  

 

Forty-two strains from the 3 phases of AS elaboration were isolated, purified and 

identified (Table 2). In the first phase, the apple juice (small apple pieces in water 
and honey) initially contained various yeast species with a total population level 

of 1.9E+03 CFU/g. The species isolated from apple juice were identified as C. 

oleophila, C. pararugosa, Cyb. misumaiensis, Cys. pinicola and M. 

guilliermondii. C. oleophila and Cyb. misumaiensis have been identified on cider 

must (Coton et al., 2006); Cys. pinicola has been reported in skin of fruits 

(Janisiewicz et al., 2010) and C. pararugosa in fruit-based beverages such as red 
wine (Jensen et al., 2009). These four species of yeast were not able to adapt to 

the sourdough ecosystem. In the fermented apple juice ready to be used as a 

liquid starter to initiate the AS, M. guilliermondii was found at a population level 
of 5.2E+06 CFU/g. During the second phase (5 days for sourdough preparation 

with the aim of achieving a stable microorganism population as well as adequate 

pH and acidity), M. guilliermondii continued to be the dominant species, with 
final population levels of 7.6E+05 CFU/g. In the third AS phase, where ripe 

sourdough is propagated by refreshments (three times a day), a lowered M. 

guilliermondii population was observed reaching levels as low as 2.0E+03 
CFU/g, at the same time Saccharomyces cerevisiae was beginning to implant, 

with a population of 9.5E+05 CFU/g. 

M. guilliermondii — which was isolated from the beginning to the end of the 
apple sourdough study — has been previously identified on several varieties of 

apples, even remaining on the surface after washing (Pelliccia et al., 2011). A 

wide variety of yeast species, including Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces, 
was found throughout the cider-making process. In general, the non-

Saccharomyces yeasts grow well during the early stages of apple juice 

fermentation, but are subsequently replaced during the following stages by 
Saccharomyces yeast (Suárez et al., 2007).  

M. guillermondii was only occasionally isolated from sourdough, in particular 

from a Spanish laboratory-made wheat sourdough where it was found, along with 
Saccharomyces, to be the dominant species (Barber and Baguena, 1988). In 

some tests of bread prepared with both selected M. guillermondii strains and 
baker’s yeast, the suitability of M. guilliermondii was demonstrated in a mixed 

starter for extending the shelf-life of sourdough baked goods whilst also 

maintaining optimal taste and structure (Coda et al., 2013).  

 

Enumeration and yeast identification from yogurt sourdough 

 

Forty-four strains from the 2 phases of YS elaboration were isolated, purified, 

and identified (Table 3). When the initial ingredients — wheat flour, yogurt and 

water — were mixed, three yeast species were identified, M. guilliermondii, S. 
cerevisiae and W. anomalus, at a total population level of 7.0E+01 CFU/g. 

During the pre-sourdough phase, the population of S. cerevisiae increased rapidly 
reaching 1.7E+07 CFU/g; the other yeast species present at the beginning 

maintained levels of 8.1E+02 CFU/g. In the ripe sourdough phase, YS could be 

considered a stable sourdough, in which S. cerevisiae maintained a high 
population level (3.6E+06 CFU/g) and only one secondary yeast, W. anomalus, 

was detected (1.0E+02 CFU/g). Evaluating this YS result, it could be observed, 

as expected, that the plain yogurt (maintained refrigerated at 5ºC) does not 
contribute to increase yeast microbiota. When yogurts are produced under 

conditions of good manufacturing practice, they should contain less than 1 yeast 

cells/g (Fleet, 1990). The sourdough yeasts may be assumed to have originated 

from the wheat flour or environmental sources. 
W. anomalus has been associated with substrates such as cereals and flours. It is 
well-adapted to the sourdough microbial ecosystem, where it is encountered 

either as the only yeast or in an inter-yeast species community (Daniel et al., 

2011). The dominant species in the Belgian artisan bakery sourdoughs were S. 
cerevisiae and W. anomalus; while the dominant species in laboratory sourdough 

fermented for 10 days were W. anomalus and Candida glabrata (Vrancken et 

al., 2010). In a pilot plant study made by Coda et al. (2013), different 
combinations of starters previously selected for antifungal activity were tried, and 

the combination of baker’s yeast with M. guilliermondii, W.anomalus and 

Lactobacillus plantarum showed a more prolonged shelf life and optimal 
chemical and sensory characteristics compared with the other breads. W. 

anomalus has been reviewed for its mycocine activities and potential future 

applications (Passoth et al., 2011; Muccilli et al., 2012). 
 

Enumeration and yeast identification from grape sourdough 

 

Thirty-two strains from the 3 phases of GS elaboration were isolated, purified, 

and identified (Table 4). In the first phase, H. uvarum was the yeast present in the 

lightly fermented must. During the second phase, H. uvarum dominated reaching 
a population level of 1.3E+08 CFU/g; in this phase of pre-sourdough S. 

cerevisiae was identified but in a lower proportion. In the third or ripe sourdough 

phase, S. cerevisiae overtook H. uvarum, which following the refreshment days 
reduced its population to 1.3E+03 CFU/g. Thus, initial fermented grape provided 

a specific yeast microbiota, H. uvarum, but in ripe sourdough it was not dominant 

or stable yeast.

yeast corresponds to CFU /g of sourdough in WL agar. Saccharomyces yeast frequency (%) was calculated from counting the difference between WL agar (total 

yeast) and Lysine agar (non-Saccharomyces yeast). 

 

 
The role of non-Saccharomyces yeast, such as H. uvarum, has been investigated 

in the wine and cider sectors. The use of specific apiculate yeast in grape must 

fermentations may lead to the production of wines with different biochemical 
profiles, and the importance of Hanseniaspora yeast in mixed starter cultures 

with S. cerevisiae has been  emphasized by Moreira et al. (2011). H. uvarum

could act in the same way in sourdough. H. uvarum has been mentioned in a 
marginal way as secondary yeast, together with S. cerevisiae as the dominant 

species, in an Italian panettone sourdough. The presence of H. uvarum was 

justified by the use of a traditional refreshment procedure using grape must 
(Restuccia et al., 2007).

CONCLUSION 

 

Evaluating jointly the results of yeast composition in three sourdoughs prepared 
using a traditional Spanish protocol, two of them elaborated with usual and non-

essential ingredients like fermented apple juice and yogurt, and the third with a 
novel ingredient such as lightly fermented must grape, it was observed that AS 

and GS originally presented a specific population of yeast, namely M. 

guilliermondii and H. uvarum, respectively. However, in both types of 
sourdough, M. guilliermondii and H. uvarum gave way in the ripe sourdough 

phase, with the successive refreshments, to S. cerevisiae as the dominant species. 

In the case of YS, the initial yeasts possibly came from the flour, and were 
identified as S. cerevisiae, M. guilliermondii, and W. anomalus. In the YS pre-

sourdough phase, S. cerevisiae was already dominant, in contrast to AS and GS, 

and it continued to be dominant in the ripe sourdough. This study indicates that 
the addition of different non-essential ingredients to the production of sourdough 

may provide a specific diversity of yeast, especially of the non-Saccharomyces 

group. It would be of interest to study in greater depth the uses of the different 

ingredients in the final sourdough refreshment with a view to enhancing the 
effect of these non-Saccharomyces yeasts.
