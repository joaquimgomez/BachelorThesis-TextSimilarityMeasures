The factors leading to changes in the organization of microbial assemblages at fine

spatial scales are not well characterized or understood. However, they are expected

to guide the succession of community development and function toward specific

outcomes that could impact human health and the environment. In this study, we put

forward a combined experimental and agent-based modeling framework and use it to

interpret unique spatial organization patterns of H1-Type VI secretion system (T6SS)

mutants of P. aeruginosa under spatial confinement. We find that key parameters,

such as T6SS-mediated cell contact and lysis, spatial localization, relative species

abundance, cell density and local concentrations of growth substrates and metabolites

are influenced by spatial confinement. The model, written in the accessible programming

language NetLogo, can be adapted to a variety of biological systems of interest and

used to simulate experiments across a broad parameter space. It was implemented

and run in a high-throughput mode by deploying it across multiple CPUs, with each

simulation representing an individual well within a high-throughput microwell array

experimental platform. The microfluidics and agent-based modeling framework we

present in this paper provides an effective means by which to connect experimental

studies in microbiology to model development. The work demonstrates progress in

coupling experimental results to simulation while also highlighting potential sources of

discrepancies between real-world experiments and idealized models.

Wilmoth et al. Pseudomonas Confinement and Type VI Secretion

INTRODUCTION

Spatial organization has a strong influence on the development
and dynamics of biological systems (Kreft et al., 1998; Lardon
et al., 2011; Halsted et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2016; McNally
et al., 2017; Timm et al., 2017). The factors leading to changes
in organization of multicellular assemblages at fine spatial scales
are not well characterized or understood, however, they are
expected to guide the succession of community development
and function toward specific outcomes (Liu et al., 2009; Cline
and Zak, 2015; Dini-Andreote et al., 2015). The organization
of distinct microbial populations can be shaped by physical
and chemical processes, and affect important activities such
as antibiotic resistance, efficient energy conversion, C and
N cycling and quorum sensing (Ginovart et al., 2005; Gras
et al., 2010, 2011b; Sahari et al., 2014; Wang and Ma, 2014;
Koonin and Wolf, 2015; Biteen et al., 2016). Microbe-microbe
interactions can also depend on direct and indirect competition
for resources between different community members (Kreft,
2004; Hellweger et al., 2008; Borenstein et al., 2015; McNally
et al., 2017). The microscale/local transport of essential microbe-
derived metabolites and cell-to-cell competition are likely to be
strongly influenced by spatial confinement and individual cell
behavior in the environment (Lardon et al., 2011; Pintelon et al.,
2012; Vogel et al., 2015; McNally et al., 2017). Consequently,
investigating the complexity of these processes and emergence
of unique behaviors requires the combination of experimental
and computational tools that can be used to explore the impact
of spatial organization, while correlating individual microbial
behavior and interactions to specific outcomes (Dini-Andreote
et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015; Hansen et al., 2016).

Cells can compete directly with surrounding species through

physical contact, and in more specialized cases, are capable of
transferring toxic effector proteins to susceptible cells. The Type

VI secretion system (T6SS) is an important example of such a

pathway, being responsible for the assembly of a pilus apparatus
that can be used to contact neighboring cells and potentially
induce cell death (Hood et al., 2010; Chou et al., 2012; LeRoux
et al., 2012). Hood et al. (2010) showed that the H1-T6SS of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is required to direct the injection of
toxins from T6SS active cells (T6SS+) into T6SS-susceptible
cells (T6SS−) that lack immunity. Other important secretion
systems such as H2- and H3-T6SS in P. aeruginosa direct
toxins preferentially to eukaryotic cells. However, because the
H1-T6SS toxin is preferentially directed toward other bacteria,
it is particularly well suited for studies of contact-mediated
interactions between neighboring and competing prokaryotes
(Mougous et al., 2006; Sana et al., 2016, 2017). T6SS interactions
in mixed microbial populations also play an important role
in the regulation of more complex biological processes and
microbial community dynamics (Russell et al., 2014; Verster
et al., 2017). For instance, the T6SS interactions occurring
amongst commensal bacteria in the mammalian gut microbiome
have been shown to modulate community composition and
interactions, as well as provide a mechanism for defending
commensal bacteria from invading pathogens (Hecht et al.,
2016). Furthermore, these T6SS interactions are highly active and

prevalent, where > 109 T6SS firing events (i.e., predicted pilus
injections) min−1 g−1 colonic contents can occur and nearly 25%
of human gut microbiota have been shown to encode a T6SS
pathway (Wexler et al., 2016; Sana et al., 2017).

Using two-member communities as a model system of
T6SS interactions in the laboratory, Borenstein et al. (2015)
demonstrated that established colonies of T6SS− Escherichia
coli could survive contact with T6SS+ Vibrio cholerae. Agent-
based modeling (ABM) simulations further showed that T6SS−
cells could survive T6SS+ attack when placed in situations
of nutrient limitation and relatively slow growth rates, and
could even outcompete the T6SS+ cells, as long as T6SS−
cells were able to establish microcolonies within the mixed
community (Borenstein et al., 2015). These results demonstrate
the importance of spatial confinement and local organization on
cell growth and survival. Thus, competition between neighboring
microbial cells and spatial confinement are expected to drive
changes in cell assemblage and organization (Borenstein et al.,
2015; Halsted et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2016).

Numerous advances in our understanding of cell-to-cell
behavior and interactions at fine spatial scales have stemmed
from the use and development of nano/micro-fabricated
platforms (Wang et al., 2013; Yamazaki et al., 2014; Swennenhuis
et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2015; Hansen et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,
2016; Timm et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2017). Timm et al. (2017)
used a microwell array platform to study the contact-mediated
T6SS interactions of P. aeruginosa. The microwell array platform
enabled high-resolution and high-throughput imaging of mixed
T6SS+ and T6SS− cells growing under spatial confinement
within microwells, with well diameters ranging from 20 to
100µm and 5µm depth. Interpreting the results of these cell-
to-cell interactions with simplified analytical models of overall
growth within each well becomes challenging and potentially
unreliable when trying to capture the complex interactions
reflected by spatial organization of microorganisms within the
microwells. Alternatively, ABM simulations can capture how
changes at the level of individual microbial interactions lead
to changes observed at the community and microcolony levels.
In conjunction with laboratory experiments ABM simulations
can be used to infer and test important growth parameters that
impact spatial organization within colonies (Borenstein et al.,
2015).

In this study, we have developed an ABM model around
experimental data obtained from a microwell array platform.
We use the model to interpret spatial organization patterns
of P. aeruginosa mutants growing under spatial confinement.
The novelty of our approach relies on the high throughput
nature of both the experiment and ABM simulations, which
allows investigating how the initial ratio of community member
abundances, initial growth location and T6SS interactions affect
spatial organization during growth. The model is written in
the language NetLogo (Wilensky(1999), NetLogo, http://ccl.
northwestern.edu/netlogo/; Center for Connected Learning and
Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University, Evanston,
IL) and is linked to a computational framework that permits
submitting many calculations in parallel for different initial
parameters, where each combination of parameters can be

conceptualized to represent a micro-environment of interest.
The ABM model has been deployed in the Compute and Data
Environment for Science, CADES (http://cades.ornl.gov/), which
also stores the relevant experimental data used during fitting
routines. We find that key parameters, such as spatial constraints,
local concentrations of growth substrates/metabolites and
associated rate constants alter the impact of P. aeruginosa Type
VI secretion activity on the spatial organization of cells in
confined environments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial Cell Culture
Two P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutants were modeled during growth
simulations to investigate the effects of Type VI secretion
on cell organization. Cultures included a 1retS mutant that
constitutively expresses GFP and the toxic effector proteins
associated with Type VI secretion, and a 1retS/1tse/i1-6
deletion mutant that constitutively expresses m-Cherry and is
susceptible to Type VI secretion interactions (i.e., injection
of toxic effector proteins) (Timm et al., 2017). Cell culture
conditions for growth experiments followed Hood et al. (2010)
and Timm et al. (2017).

Microwell Fabrication
Fabrication of Si microwells followed the methods outlined in
(Hansen et al., 2016). Briefly, a 1µm parylene film was deposited
on a 4 inch diameter silicon wafer with a silicon dioxide coating.
An adhesion promoter and positive photoresist were spun onto
the wafer with a spin coater, followed by 1min of baking on a
hot plate at 115◦C. The substrate was exposed to UV light using
a contact mask aligner, baked on a hot plate for an additional
minute at 115◦C, then developed. The parylene exposed in the
patterned photoresist was etched with O2 plasma in a Reactive
Ion Etch (RIE), and was followed by a Bosch process to etch into
the silicon to formmicrowells. Residual photoresist was removed
by etching with O2 plasma. The final well depth was 5µm. The
layout of the microwell platform can be found in Hansen et al.
(2016). It contains arrays of microwells ranging in size from 5 to
50µm in diameter, in increments of 5 microns, along with wells
that are 100µm in diameter. Twelve arrays of each size, including
four replicates of three different well spacing, are included in each
array. Individual microwell-array chips were sectioned from the
Si wafers and subsequently used for growth experiments with P.
aeruginosamutants.

Microwell Culture Experiments and Image
Analysis
The cell-seeding, growth, imaging and image analysis methods
used in this study correspond to those described in Timm
et al. (2017). Timm et al. (2017) provides a detailed step-by-
step description of those protocols along with online video
content displaying those techniques. Representative data, as well
as the image collection and correction procedures, are provided
there. Specifically, we provide additional analysis of a more
comprehensive data set and describe the development of a new
ABM framework that helps explain some of the unresolved

questions reported by Timm et al. (2017). Briefly, cells of P.
aeruginosa were mixed in a 1:2 ratio (GFP:m-Cherry) suspended
in growth media and incubated on bovine serum albumin (BSA)-
functionalized microwell chips in a humid environment for 1 h
(Timm et al., 2017). The number of cells that attach within
any given well is dependent on the number of cells present in
solution and the time allowed for the cells to attach. Not all
of the cells will attach inside a microwell during a 1 h interval.
Some cells remain in suspension or attach outside of the wells
on the parylene cover. Following 1 h incubation the solution is
removed and the parylene is peeled, leaving behind only cells
that were attached inside the wells. The entire microwell array
is then sealed under a nutrient agarose layer and grown in a
live cell chamber on an automated microscope stage. Details of
fluorescence microscopy used to measure growth are given in
Timm et al. (2017). Images were collected every 30min over a
24 h period, and were then processed and analyzed using ImageJ
and Matlab software (Timm et al., 2017). Data presented here is
taken from images collected from multiple chips imaged during
experiments performed on different days. Experimental data
for co-culture experiments represents analysis from 63 (20µm),
35 (25µm), 49 (30µm), 16 (35µm), 16 (40µm), 16 (45µm),
16 (50µm), and 4 (100µm) wells. Mono-culture experiments
were performed as controls, with equivalent numbers of wells
examined for T6SS+ and T6SS− only cultures at each well
size. Representative images taken from a single 100µm diameter
well are shown in Figure 1A. Growth curves were established
by measuring total fluorescence from both GFP and m-Cherry
expressing mutants over time in each well and corrected for
background fluorescence (Timm et al., 2017).

Analysis of Experimental Imaging Data
Amulti-stage fitting was performed on both the ABM population
curves and time series fluorescence data corresponding to the
experimental population curves of T6SS+ and T6SS− in each
well. Using a derivative zero crossing algorithm, the growth
period of each fluorescence series was separated from the decay
stage (Figure 2). The data from the cell growth period was then
fit to the logistic function, Equation 1, using the least squares

where a0 is the initial fluorescence intensity, which reflects the
number of living cells present inside the well at the beginning
of the experiment. In this form, a is the maximum intensity, µ
is the maximum growth rate and τ is the lag time. The analysis
presented in this paper deals exclusively with observations of the
growth phase. The parameters a, µ and τ for each well were
collected and a and µ scaled as shown in (Eq. 2) to represent per
unit intensity values; the scaled a′, µ′, and τ were then plotted vs.
the initial ratio T6SS+:T6SS− for each well size and a linear fit
was performed. The slope of each line, i.e., a′/ratio, µ′/ratio and
τ /ratio, for each well was then plotted vs. all the well sizes.

ABM Development and Simulations
Themodel is described following the protocol ODD (Overview—
Design Concepts—Details) that was initially established by
Grimm et al. (2006) and later revised and updated by Grimm
et al. (2010). This protocol was specifically developed in order
to provide a standard way to describe ABMs, so that both the
basic features and the details of the models could be correctly
communicated to the scientific community. In the following, we
provide a concise description of our particular ABM (see full
details in the Supplementary text and Supplementary Figure 1
flowchart).

The basic principles of the bacterial model and protocol
system developed here are taken from the INDISIM model
(Ginovart et al., 2002; Gras and Ginovart, 2006; Gras et al.,
2011a; Granda et al., 2016). The basic entities of our model
represent bacterial cells of the two P. aeruginosa mutants,
including the 1retS mutant (T6SS+) and the 1retS/1tse/i1-6
deletion mutant (T6SS−) that is susceptible to Type VI secretion
(Hood et al., 2010), and spatially confined areas (or grids)
of a two-dimensional circular well that represents the growth

environment on the microwell array chip used for laboratory
experiments. The bacterial cells are defined by several individual
variables and parameters: bacterial species (T6SS+ or T6SS−),
mass, mass to initiate the division process, energy, and viability.
Spatial grid variables contain the local content of a carbon (C)
source, together with the x-y spatial coordinates. Global variables
account for the global balance of bacteria (in terms of number
and biomass for each of the two mutants of P. aeruginosa) and
nutrient source, as well as the emerging bacterial and biomass
mean growth rates, and the bacterial biomass distributions. The
model can simulate a population of up to 105 bacterial cells in
spatial grid domain. This is a qualitative version of the model as
it currently uses values that are given in relative units.

It is assumed that bacteria are able to respond to and
detect the nutrient concentration in the space in which they
are located. Both T6SS+ and T6SS− bacteria are modeled to
consume resources at the same rate. The nutrient consumption
is adjusted according to its local availability and the uptake is
driven by the local concentration of available C. Cell movement
and reproduction may also be driven by the occupation of the
surrounding growth space. The mutants interact by direct cell-
to-cell contact via the Type VI secretion system and, in this case,
a T6SS+ can kill a contacted T6SS− cell. Additionally, indirect
interaction can occur through the competition for available C and
for the occupation of space. Stochasticity is introduced through
setting initial individual locations at random by using a Gaussian

wells are shown as closed circles. Solid lines show the logistic fit to the growth phase. Dotted lines show the fit of an exponential to the decay phase. The gradient

distribution around an expected mean value (initial individual
mass, mass to start the reproduction cycle, viability time and
cell lysis when optimal conditions for cellular maintenance are
not met). Random variation is applied to individuals within grid
spaces to deal with the initiation of the reproduction cycle in each
bacterium and with the change in location of cells. For instance,
the model permits assigning a probability of initial growth at the
edge of the well, a behavior that, as it will be discussed later,
is observed experimentally. Moreover, in the predation process
by T6SS+ cells, randomness is considered in the identification
of a neighboring T6SS− cell. This randomness accounts for the
uncertainty in these processes and reflects the high variety of
mechanisms that underlie the variability observed in real systems.
In order to avoid privileged first-acting bacteria in the model,
the order of the bacteria to perform simulated actions is chosen
randomly at each time step.

Overall, the execution of the model consists of four main
parts: (1) initialization of the system, where the initial population
of T6SS+ and T6SS− mutants are defined and distributed
according to the user’s input parameters, the spatial cells are set
up with the corresponding initial amount of nutrient, and global
variables are formally evaluated for the first time; (2) the core
of the simulation, with the main loop where all the individual
actions and environmental processes take place iteratively until
the end of the simulation; (3) the output of results at the end
of each time step, both graphical representation and numerical
evaluation, as well as a final external text file with the simulation
outcome for further analysis; (4) analysis of the results and
comparison to experimental data.

The population curves obtained with the ABMmodel were fit
using Equation 1 and scaled as in Equation 2, and the resultant
parameters a′, µ′, τ plotted vs. the initial T6SS+:T6SS− ratio,
similarly to what it was done with the experimental parameters.
The ABM model, however, contains many input values that
define a very large parameter space, where different results are
obtained by using a different set of input values. In this paper, we

have chosen to inspect a range of input values in order to examine
how the level of aggressiveness of T6SS+ cells affect the outcomes
of the simulations. Specifically, for each well and T6SS+:T6SS−
initial ratio, 100 simulations were run, each corresponding to the
same set of input values. To mimic the experimental conditions
better, T6SS+ and T6SS− cells were initially constrained to
areas corresponding to the well dimensions, and the bacteria
were added in initial ratios and densities corresponding to those
observed in the experimental wells of the same size.

RESULTS

Previously, Timm et al. (2017) demonstrated that the GFP 1retS
mutant T6SS+ and the m-Cherry 1retS/1tse/i1-6 deletion
mutant T6SS− that is susceptible to Type VI secretion,
formed discrete microcolony assemblages during co-growth
in microwells. Observed well populations were heterogeneous
(Figure 1A) with distinct assemblages of individual species
forming across the wells. Instances of T6SS− microcolony
formation were unexpected based on the hypothesis that T6SS+
cells would dominate each well environment due to their directed
injection of toxic effector proteins into susceptible cells. In
the present study, we used ABM simulations (Figure 1B) to
examine how spatial confinement and Type VI secretion can lead
to growth conditions that allow the formation of microcolony
assemblages and enable susceptible T6SS− cells to persist.

In Figure 3, we show how the experimental values for a′, µ′, τ
change with the initial T6SS+: T6SS− seeding ratio for both types
of cells in 30µm diameter wells. Although the initial ratio of cells
in the solution used to seed the wells is 1:2, natural variability in
the number of cells of each type that seed into the wells provides
initial ratios ranging between nearly 0 (all T6SS−) to 3:1 (3 times
more T6SS+ than T6SS−). For both types of cells, τ is practically
independent of the initial ratio, whereas a′ and µ′ for T6SS+
linearly decrease as the T6SS+:T6SS− ratio increases. Likewise,

µ′ and a′ values decrease as cultures have an increasing number
of T6SS− cells compared to T6SS+. For both T6SS− and T6SS+
the maximum number of cells per initial number of cells (a′), as
well as the maximum rate of increase per initial numbers of cells
(µ′), decreases as the corresponding cell type is initially present in
excess. As seen in Figure 4, for each 30µmwell, the initial density
is relatively constant, independent of the initial T6SS+:T6SS−
ratio. Cells are, for the most part, segregated into domains
that contain either T6SS + or − cells. The latter is observed
both in experiment and simulations (Figures 1A,B, respectively),
though some overlap can be seen within the experimental images
(Figure 1A, yellow region). We speculate that larger clusters
or colonies of cells will grow more slowly on a per cell basis
because of nutrient limitations that may occur at the center
of those microcolonies relative to growth at the edges. Thus,
even though the overall density within the wells is the same,
local microcolony size may influence the maximum growth rate
per initial number of cells (µ′) and maximum number of cells
per initial number of cells (a′). A more detailed image analysis
strategy that allows quantitative description of microcolony size
and patchiness within wells throughout these experiments is
warranted and under development.

During growth on the experimental microwell platform,
both T6SS + and − cells showed a general preference for
seeding at the well edges regardless of well size (Timm et al.,
2017). During ABM-simulated growth in a circular well with
preferential seeding at the boundaries, microcolony formation
qualitatively mirrors the experimental results of Timm et al.
(2017) (Figure 1) though, again, a more quantitative analysis of
microcolony size and patchiness within wells is needed to make
a direct comparison. In the simulations, the cell placement is
biased so that there is a higher probability of cells beginning the
simulation at the edges of a well. Cells seeded near the edge of
wells, in both the experiments and the simulations, propagate
toward the interior because of confinement imposed by the well
edge. Based on the contact mediated pathogenesis associated
with T6SS interactions, we expect that subsequent cell-to-cell
interactions would help maintain bacterial domain segregation
and minimize co-localization.

T6SS– mutant only data (orange triangle). The expected ratio of T6SS(+):(−)

was 1:2. Error bars represent standard deviations around the mean value.

In Figure 5 we have plotted the slope of the straight
lines, i.e., a′/ratio, µ′/ratio and τ /ratio, for each well size vs.
the well diameter. In the case of T6SS+ cells, the slope of
these lines shows more variation than that seen for T6SS−
cells. The reason for this remains unclear and may result
from T6SS+ cells growing outside the wells and outside the
analytical region of interest (see Supplementary Movie 1). Also,
fluctuations in GFP expression or loss of GFP intensity may
contribute to this variation across experiments. For T6SS−
cells, the sensitivity (slope, µ′/ratio and a′/ratio) of maximum
growth rate per initial number of T6SS-cells and maximum
number of cells per initial number of cells, increases slightly
with well diameter. Figure 4 shows that the initial seeded cell
density per well on the experimental platform decreased as a
function of increasing well diameter between 15 and 100µm.
One might expect that at lower cell densities, the sensitivity to
initial ratio of T6SS+ to T6SS− cells would decrease because
lower densities should correspond to fewer T6SS+ to T6SS−
interactions. However, if increasingmicrocolony size is suspected

to cause reductions in µ′ and a′, as described above, larger
wells could facilitate formation of these larger domains by (i)
allowing unimpeded growth of microcolonies and (ii) increasing
the possibility for the seeding of larger microbial aggregates
or flocs from solution. Again, more detailed image analysis
techniques should facilitate future investigations using the array
platform.

Using the ABM model, we performed a similar study of
microcolony formation in a population of T6SS+ and T6SS−
cells, where the aggressiveness of the former was changed from
high to moderate to low. For simulating the experimental
conditions closely, we computed the experimental distribution
of T6SS+:T6SS− initial ratios and densities and used similar
initial values in the simulations. The results of the simulations are
shown in Figure 6 for a well size of 30µm, where we have plotted
a′, µ′ and τ for initial T6SS+:T6SS− ratios that resemble those
obtained experimentally. When the aggressiveness was 1 (i.e.,
each contact occurring between a T6SS+ and a T6SS - cell results
in the death of a T6SS− cell), the behavior of a′, µ′ and τ for
T6SS+ resembles that seen experimentally (compare Figure 6A
to Figure 3A). The opposite is true for T6SS− cells (Figure 6B vs.
Figure 3B), and the results indicate that the fewer T6SS− there
are present, the more poorly T6SS− cells grow. The trend seen
in Figure 6B for T6SS− cells can be explained as follows: while
T6SS+ cells are not affected by their own aggressiveness, T6SS−
cells are, and although it is theoretically advantageous for T6SS−
cells to have relatively fewer neighboring T6SS− competitors, this
advantage is offset by a high rate of lysis caused by the highly
aggressive T6SS+ cells. Lowering the aggressiveness of T6SS+
from 100 to 10% does not significantly change the behavior of a′,
µ′ and τ for both T6SS+ and T6SS− mutants (Figures 6C,D).
However, if the aggressiveness is lowered to 1% (Figures 6E,F),
then a′ and µ′ of T6SS− cells follow the same trend as in the
experiment (Figure 3B). At this low killing rate, however, the
growth rate of T6SS+ cells decreases (compare Figure 6E to
Figure 3A). Specifically, as the aggressiveness of T6SS+ cells is
reduced, the linear fit of a′ intersects the y-axis at a lower point.
Thus, at lower abundances and lower levels of aggressiveness,
T6SS+ cells can no longer effectively compete with T6SS− cells.

DISCUSSION

The T6SS of P. aeruginosa is an important biological model for
understanding how cell-to-cell contact directs the succession
and organization of microbial communities (Robinson et al.,
2009; Hood et al., 2010; Sarris and Scoulica, 2011; LeRoux
et al., 2012; Das et al., 2013). As mentioned in the introduction,
T6SS interactions play a significant role in the regulation of
microbiomes, which has important implications for biomedical
and pathogen research, particularly for understanding
mammalian gut microbiomes, and also environmental
biogeochemistry relevant to native microbial interactions
with plants and soil. However, the factors leading to changes
in organization of microbial cells at fine spatial scales, driven
by T6SS interactions, are not well characterized or understood.
Recent laboratory investigations and ABM simulations indicated
that established T6SS− colonies of Escherichia coli could persist
during cell-to-cell interactions with Vibrio cholerae T6SS+ cells
(Borenstein et al., 2015). The results of Timm et al. (2017) further
suggested that spatial confinement, as well as T6SS activity
between growing effector and susceptible P. aeruginosamutants,
could potentially direct cell organization in micro-colonies and
affect the survival of susceptible cells. In the present study,
building upon additional analysis of the complete dataset of
Timm et al. (2017), and in combination with ABM simulations,
we provide supporting evidence that both spatial confinement
and T6SS activity can lead to changes in the organization and
persistence of P. aeruginosa.

We found that discrete zones of clearing occurred around

T6SS− cell assemblages during co-growth with T6SS+ cells in

ABM simulations (Figure 1; see also Supplementary Movie 2).
This cell-to-cell organization of T6SS− cells, surrounded by a

zone of clearing, is consistent with T6SS-induced cell lysis at
the boundary between both P. aeruginosa mutants (Hood et al.,
2010; Borenstein et al., 2015). This zone of clearing provides a
mechanism of P. aeruginosa cellular organization, as previously
observed in Si-based microwell arrays (Timm et al., 2017). We
speculate that during growth of both mutant strains, these buffer
zones can occur randomly during growth, perhaps forming

safe-pockets for susceptible cells to continue growing, and can
become more defined as microcolonies of both species expand
and interact at their outer boundaries. Fitting of the complete
experimental dataset indicated that starting at the apparent
peak in cell growth for both strains, a general decay in T6SS+
GFP signal intensities began, while T6SS− m-Cherry intensities
subsequently remained more persistent over time (Figure 2).
Borenstein et al. (2015) demonstrated that more-established
microcolonies of T6SS-susceptible cells can potentially survive
T6SS attack, which helps explain the persistence of susceptible P.
aeruginosa mutants as deduced from the fluorescence intensities
taken from our experimental data. We also observed that T6SS+
cells could outgrow a well once the interior of the well cavity had
become nearly filled by growing cells (Supplementary Movie 1);
this may explain, to some extent, the sharp decay phase generally
observed for T6SS+ GFP intensities (Figure 2).

We found that the initial seeded cell density per well on the
experimental platform decreased as a function of increasing well
diameter between 15 and 100µm (Figure 4), but cell density
did not have an apparent effect on cell organization during
different growth simulations, which is consistent with the results
of Timm et al. (2017) that demonstrated microcolony formation

across all well sizes between 20 and 100µm diameters. The
correlation between initial cell density after seeding and well
size likely reflects the preparation of the experimental microwell
platform. For instance, following the experimental cell seeding
step (Timm et al., 2017): (1) slight drying of the aqueous
culture media before contact with the nutrient agarose cover;
(2) difficulty rinsing cells from smaller diameter wells during
the final water rinse step; or (3) a larger side-wall to floor
area ratio per well could have affected initial cell densities such
that smaller wells were more densely packed than larger wells,
particularly at well edge boundaries. However, qualitatively,
we found that spatial organization into distinct T6SS mutant
assemblages during experimental and simulated growth was not
strongly influenced by cell density or close packing. Future
quantitative analysis of assemblage size and spacing for different
well sizes may reveal a more defined mechanism. Densely packed
cell assemblages have been shown in previous studies to follow
similar biological-phase separation where distinct microcolony
formation is favored regardless of cell-to-cell density in spatially
confined environments (Tolker-Nielsen and Molin, 2000; Berk
et al., 2011; Borenstein et al., 2015; Cutler et al., 2015; McNally
et al., 2017).

We generally found the impact of well size to be negligible
for the size ranges explored in experiments, see Figures 5A,B.
Well size did not have a significant impact on overall growth
rates per initial cell number or maximum growth rate per initial
cell number. This was unexpected. Indeed, in well diameters
<25µm, competition for resources and cell-to-cell interactions
would have been expected to suppress T6SS− growth. Reductions
in spatial confinement within larger wells would, in principle,
allow T6SS− cells to grow more efficiently with increasing
well diameters, reducing the likelihood of encountering T6SS+
because of the lower seeding densities and more available area.
In wells of 45µm diameter and greater, at much lower initial
densities (Figure 4), the individual T6SS− colonies may have
had the potential to develop with less competition and become
more established before interacting with the more aggressive
mutant strain. In this case, the perimeter of T6SS-interactions
around a colony would be overshadowed by the more established
interior of each mutant colony. In other words, with larger wells
above 40 microns, T6SS-killing should have become secondary
to the size of mutant colonies by the time they interact at their
edges. Clearly, a more systematic study of micro-colony size and
distribution is needed to understand these results. The behavior
of T6SS+ cells across well sizes displays variation in the data
that makes it difficult to draw specific conclusions about T6SS+
growth as a function of well size.

Finally, average a′, µ′ and τ for each well size vs. the entire
well size distribution were also calculated, see Figure 7; the
results obtained in a mixed population of T6SS+ and T6SS−
cells were compared to those obtained in control experiments

comprising only one cell type. As seen in Figure 7D, for the
control experiments, the average a′, µ′ and τ of T6SS− cells
are practically insensitive to the well size, whereas the same data
for T6SS+, Figure 7C, shows variation and an increase at larger
well sizes. In mixed populations, the data for T6SS− cells shows
a similar trend, Figure 7B, although the error bars are larger,
illustrating the interactions with T6SS+ cells. The data for T6SS+
cells, Figure 7A, shows even larger error bars, which is surprising
because these cells should not be negatively impacted by the
presence of T6SS− strains. As mentioned above, inspection
of the data reveals that on some occasions T6SS+ cells can
outgrow/leave the well boundaries (Supplementary Movie 1).
We believe this is one of the primary reasons for the large
variation observed in Figures 7A,B. Consequently, whether or
not T6SS+ cells outgrow or escape the wells should also affect
the growth of T6SS− cells remaining within the same wells.

In this study we have developed an experimental-ABM
framework that can be used to interpret unique spatial-
organization patterns of P. aeruginosa cells growing under
spatial confinement. The ABM model developed here, although
qualitative, is capable of showing microcolony formation
regardless of initial density, or whether the bacteria prefer
to begin growth at the well edges, which is consistent with
other recent studies that have examined different microbial
species under T6SS interactions. Our model was also capable
of reproducing the behavior of a′, µ′ and τ of T6SS+
cells for a particular well size, and the same was true for
T6SS− cells once the aggressiveness level of T6SS+ cells
was lowered. As such, this model can be used to extract

information regarding aggressiveness levels, amount of available
resources, and rate of consumption of nutrients, as well as
how all these variables affect the growth of the bacterial
colony. Yet, there are some uncertainties that the current
model does not take into account. Future work will focus on
optimizing the model by identifying the most essential growth
parameters and developing a more quantitative description of
variables used for running the simulations. Further, the ABM
model is capable of investigating 5000 wells in 30min, and
in connection with the microfluidic platform, constitutes a
powerful framework to connect microbiological experiments to
ABM simulations, while improving the ABM models to more
accurately reproduce the experimental observations. Finally,
this new microfluidic-ABM framework could be used in the
future to predict the types of microcolonies that are likely to
develop when different microbial species are mixed, which is
expected to advance our understanding of microbial ecology
at fine spatial scales, as well as mechanistically describe how
microbial succession occurs in nature and shapes environments
of interest.
