simulation of T-junction

S. Arias · A. Montlaur

Abstract In this work, we study the influence of the contact angle boundary
condition on 3D CFD simulations of the bubble generation process occurring in
a capillary T-junction. Numerical simulations have been performed with the com-
mercial Computational Fluid Dynamics solver ANSYS Fluent v15.0.7. Experimen-
tal results serve as a reference to validate numerical results for four independent
parameters: the bubble generation frequency, volume, velocity and length. CFD
simulations accurately reproduce experimental results both from qualitative and
quantitative points of view. Numerical results are very sensitive to the gas-liquid-
wall contact angle boundary conditions, confirming that this is a fundamental
parameter to obtain accurate CFD results for simulations of this kind of prob-
lems.

1 Introduction

Gas-liquid two-phase flows dominated by capillary forces occur in countless mod-
ern industrial applications of interest to the designers of space-based as well as
terrestrial equipment. Examples can be found in normal gravity examples such
as mixing process, chemical reactions, emulsion technology, materials synthesis,
pipeline systems, medical science, personal care products, etc. These operations
are critical to a wide variety of industries such as petroleum, pharmaceutical,

mining, biological, and chemical. Similar operations will need to be performed in
space and on planetary bodies, if we are to achieve our goals of human space
exploration. Indeed, gas-liquid two-phase flows intervene as well in space-based
systems such as life-support systems for human exploration, thermal management
systems, propulsion systems, chemical contactors, space bioreactors, etc (Ostrach,
1988; McQuillen et al., 1998; Baroud & Willaime, 2004; Guo et al., 2017). A better
understanding and an improvement of two-phase flows generation techniques are
thus mandatory for the optimal development of these technologies, both in nor-
mal and reduced-gravity environments. Regarding microgravity conditions, several
methods have been proposed in the past to fulfill this goal, aiming to generate and
control two-phase flows in a more accurate way (Pampering & Rath, 1995; Bhunia
et al., 1998; Forrester et al., 1998; Di Marco et al., 2003; Iacona et al., 2006).
T-junction bubble generators have arisen as an efficient method providing trains
of bubbles, immersed into a continuous liquid, with small dispersion in bubble size
(Carrera et al., 2008; Arias et al., 2009, 2010).

Very recently, the authors of the present work introduced a 3D numerical study
of the bubble generation process into a T-junction, obtained with the commercial
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver ANSYS Fluent v15.0.7 (Arias &
Montlaur, 2017). In this study, numerical simulations were compared with ex-
perimental data, reproducing the same conditions. Numerical data agreed with
experimental results from a qualitative point of view, but showed quantitative
discrepancies. Obtained numerical results depended on the gas-liquid-wall contact
angle boundary conditions. Consequently, CFD and experimental results never
agreed simultaneously for time scale results (bubble generation frequency) and
properties of bubbles detachment (bubble volume and velocity), and the real im-
pact of the value of the gas-liquid-wall contact angle remained an open question.
This is indeed a complex paradoxical problem, since the interface is a contact
line moving along a no-slip solid surface, which has led to several recent studies
(Malekzadeh & Roohi , 2015; Yong-Qiang et al., 2017). As mentioned by Hirt
& Brethour (2001), in the Volume of Fluid (VOF) algorithm approach, which
will be used here, dynamic contact angles are not specified but computed as part
of the solution via the finite volume method. They arise automatically from the
basic balance of forces on which the numerical method is built. This is one of
the several practical advantages of this modeling approach. Nevertheless, the nu-
merical description of contact angles suffers from artificial diffusion (Schonfeld &
Hardt, 2009). Huh & Scriven (1971) suggested that the viscous dissipation becomes
very strong near a moving contact line, being dominant with respect to inertial
or capillary effects in that region. Afkhami et al. (2009) found that this intense
dissipation can curve the interface dramatically near the contact line, which can
cause the contact angle to differ significantly from the measured interface angle.
In any case, the study and selection of the adequate value of the contact angle
for 3D-CFD simulations of multiphase flows in a channel remains a challenging
problem, motivating and demanding further work such as the one presented here.
For example, Rosengarten et al. (2006) implemented the contact angle within the
surface tension model in the solver. The fluid contact angle at the wall was used
to rotate the surface normal in the cells adjacent to the wall and thus to adjust
the curvature and interface shape near the wall, following a method first described
by Brackbill et al. (1992). Shi et al. (2014) used the free energy model of the Lat-
tice Boltzmann method and showed that the droplet size and shape in T-junction

microchannel depend on the wetting property of channel walls. Here, and given
the previously commented difficulty to account for the physics of moving contact
lines, the objective is to set the contact angle as a boundary condition.

This paper is a continuation of the study by Arias & Montlaur (2017), aiming
to tackle this issue, by explicitly discussing and quantifying the importance of the
value of the gas-liquid-wall contact angle. Section 2 briefly recalls the T-junction
problem statement, identifying the relevant dimensionless numbers characterizing
the bubble generation process. Section 3 summarizes the experimental and nu-
merical metrics and methodology. Section 4 analyzes the influence of the contact
angle boundary conditions, whereas new numerical data are provided and com-
pared with experimental results in section 5. The main conclusions are outlined in
section 6.

2 Problem statement

The experiment considered here consists in generating trains of bubbles in a capil-
lary T-junction. Air and water are injected in perpendicular directions into 1 mm
internal diameter capillaries, see figures 7 and 8. The liquid capillary is the main
channel, with a total length of 10 mm. The gas capillary intersects perpendicularly
to the liquid one. Air and water are considered incompressible and under isother-
mal conditions. Standard values at 25◦C are used for density (ρG = 1.225 kg/m

3

and ρL = 10
3 kg/m3, for gas and liquid respectively), viscosity (µG = 10

−5 Pa.s
and µL = 10

−3 Pa.s) and surface tension (σ = 0.072 N/m).

A detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in (Arias &
González-Cinca, 2016). Gas and liquid volumetric flow rates (QG and QL, re-
spectively) can be accurately controlled, producing bubbles with high regularity.
Results will be presented in section 5 as a function of the superficial velocities
(instead of the volumetric flow rates). The gas and liquid superficial velocities are
defined as USG = QG/A and USL = QL/A, where A is the capillary cross-section
area. Moreover, the actual gas and liquid velocities are defined as UG = QG/(αA)
and UL = QL/((1 − α)A), where α is the volume average void fraction (Arias
& Montlaur, 2017). Therefore, the relationships between the superficial and the
actual velocities are UG = USG/α and UL = USL/(1 − α).

Although new experimental results are presented in this work, the range of USG
and USL analyzed here remains the same as in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017), as well
as the dimensionless numbers that characterize the problem. Table 1 summarizes
these values. Bo is the Bond number, defined as ρLgφ

2
c/σ, with the gravitational

acceleration g and the capillary internal diameter φc. We is the Weber number,
defined as We = ρGφcUG

2/σ, for a gas velocity UG. Re is the Reynolds number,
defined as Re = ρLφcUM/µL, where UM is the mixture superficial velocity, sum of
the gas and liquid superficial velocities. Finally, Ca is the capillary number, defined
as Ca = µLUSL/σ. As shown by the values in table 1, gravity plays a negligible
role in the bubble generation process with respect to capillary effects (Bo < 0.29,
(Suo & Griffith, 1964)), and capillary forces overcome inertial forces (We < 2,
(Rezkallah, 1996)). Values of Re correspond to flows under laminar conditions,
and surface tension effects are greater than the liquid viscous effects (Ca < 10−2).
Consequently, the present analysis can be assumed as gravity independent (g =

3 Methodology

3.1 Experimental procedure and metrics

Results of a total of 15 experiments are compared with numerical simulations, with
same gas and liquid superficial velocities and fluid physical properties used in both
cases. Experiments were performed at 3 different liquid superficial velocities (0.106,
0.318 and 0.531 m/s) while increasing the gas superficial velocity (within the range
0.068-0.473 m/s). For each pair of velocities USL-USG, images were taken with a
high-speed camera at 4000 frames per second (f.p.s), once the flow had stabilized.
Only two types of flow regimes were obtained, bubble and slug flow regimes. Bubble
flow regime occurs when bubble volume VB is smaller than the volume of a sphere
VS with a diameter equal to the capillary internal diameter φc, and slug flow regime
in the other case (VB > VS). Both types of flow patterns are intermittent flows in
which the gas phase is dispersed into the liquid phase forming independent bubbles.
The bubble generation frequency for a single bubble is defined as fi = 1/Tfi, Tfi
being the total time required to form and detach a single bubble, denoted with
the subscript i. Tfi was computed by counting the number of frames required to
form the bubble i, that is, Tfi = #frames/4000f.p.s. The bubble volume of each
single bubble VBi was estimated taking into account that QG = fi ·VBi, and then
that VBi = QG ·Tfi. The bubble (or gas) velocity UGi was measured directly over
the calibrated images, by considering the displacement of the foremost part of a
single bubble. Finally the bubble length LBi was also measured over calibrated
images. For each pair USL-USG, the average values of these four parameters were
estimated over a large enough sample of n bubbles. Standard deviations calculated
for each experimental value accounted for uncertainty. They have been plotted as
error bars in figures 9-12, representing an improvement of the experimental data
with respect to (Arias & Montlaur, 2017). For the sake of clarity, error bars smaller
than the corresponding symbols in the graphs are not represented.

The same four parameters were obtained in the numerical simulations. Figure 1
shows an example of data obtained as a post-process of the CFD simulations, that
is, the fraction of air as a function of time at two cross-sections of the domain
(at 7 and 8 mm from the beginning of the tube). The frequency is computed as
the inverse of the time between two consecutive bubbles when crossing the same
cross-section, that is, as 1/Tf . The bubble velocity is calculated as the distance
between cross-sections at 7 and 8 mm divided by the time TS , needed for the

total fraction of air of a bubble over time (AB) and multiplying it by its velocity
times the capillary cross-section area. The bubble length is calculated as the time
between the foremost and rearmost times of a bubble (TB) multiplied by the
bubble velocity.

3.2 Numerical simulations

All numerical simulations use the commercial CFD solver ANSYS Fluent v15.0.7.
Both fluids are modeled as immiscible ones by using a three-dimensional Volume
of Fluid (VOF) method and tracking the volume fraction of each fluid, as well as
the interface between the phases, throughout the domain. An explicit formulation
is used for the VOF model, the PRESTO! (PREssure STaggering Option) scheme
for pressure interpolation (Ansys, 2014), a second-order upwind scheme for spatial
discretization and a first-order implicit scheme for the transient formulation. Re-
garding the boundary conditions, air and water inlets are considered as velocity
inlets, with the corresponding values of USG and USL in each case of study. The
outlet of the T-junction is set up as a pressure outlet. All walls are treated as
no-slip smooth walls with identical constant contact angle, which is the key point
of the present study, defining it as the angle between the wall and the tangent to
the interface at the wall (measured from the liquid toward the gaseous phase). All
gas and liquid physical properties are set to the same values as in the experiments.
The gravity value is set to 0, accordingly to the experimental small value of the
Bond number. All details concerning this CFD solver and the settings used for
these numerical simulations can be found in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017).

The computational mesh is composed of 413000 elements. This mesh is a hybrid
of tetrahedral (in the core of the domain) and hexahedral (close to the walls)
elements. The value∆t = 5×10−6 s is selected as a time step for all the simulations.
Again, more details about the chosen mesh and time step and their validation can
be found in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017).

4 Contact angle study

We next denote θV the value of the gas-liquid-wall contact angle boundary condi-
tion on the vertical capillary, θH on the horizontal one, and simplify the notation
to θ when θV = θH . In a previous work, Arias & Montlaur (2017) considered a
constant θV . The horizontal channel was maintained perfectly hydrophilic, that
is, θH = 0

◦, following previous set-up from Arias et al. (2012), and given that ex-
perimental results showed no attachment of the gas at this channel. Additionally,
two-dimensional numerical simulations performed in (Arias et al., 2012) found that
the condition θH = 0

◦ was essential in order to generate bubbles with a realistic
shape (non-attached to this channel). In (Arias & Montlaur, 2017), numerical re-
sults were found to be very sensitive to the value of θV . Furthermore, no single
value of θV could provide simultaneously close-to-experimental results for the bub-
ble frequency, velocity and volume, not even for a single pair USL−USG. In fact, it
was shown that when the value of θV increased, the pinch-off region moved down-
stream, producing a detachment mechanism that differed from the one observed
in the experiments (see figure 3 in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017)). Eventually, values
of θV = 25

◦ and θH = 0
◦ were fixed in all numerical simulations, given that this

configuration provided the best resemblance with experimental pinch-off, despite
leading to some numerical error.

In the current study, we cancel the perfect hydrophilic boundary condition by
imposing the same (non-zero) value of the contact angle in the horizontal channel
as in the vertical one. This change of boundary condition has been motivated
by the previously commented impossibility of reaching good agreement by only
tuning θV . Furthermore, it is also found more logical from a physical point of
view, since the same contact angle θ is now imposed on every wall, meaning that
the wall boundary condition is now continuous in the critical region of the T-
junction where pinch-off occurs. Different values of contact angles (within the
range 0 − 90◦) were tested for each pair USL − USG, until finding a value that
simultaneously provided close-to-experimental results (for the bubble frequency,
volume, velocity and length) and a realistic pinch-off process. Figure 2 presents
the values θ that best fulfill these requirements for each pair USL − USG studied
here. The contact angle is plotted as a function of the actual liquid velocity UL,
which is computed by canceling α in the definitions of UL and UG (see section 2):

UL =
USL

1 − USG
UG

, (1)

where values of UG come from experiments (see section 5.3). Figure 2 shows
that values in the range of θ = 25 − 30◦ are optimal for UL < 0.415 m/s and
UL > 0.756 m/s. This confirms that the 25

◦-value imposed in (Arias & Montlaur,
2017) in the vertical channel was correct, but, and as it will be further commented
in the following sections, it had to be also imposed in the horizontal channel. No
suitable constant value of θ was found in the range 0.415 < UL < 0.756 m/s.
Within this range, fine-tuning of θ should be made for every particular case; nev-
ertheless, further tests have proved that imposing a constant value of θ = 40◦

(calculated as the average within this range), would not generate any substantial
variation in the solution. The observed discontinuity of the optimal value of θ has
no trivial explanation, and no correlation with any physical behavior or experi-

mental tendency has been found. Further studies could try to provide a suitable
answer to this particular subject.

Figure 3 shows bubbles just after detachment for contact angles of 25◦, 35◦,
45◦, 90◦ (for USL = 0.531 m/s and USG = 0.178 m/s). The contact angle is
indicated in the upper right corner. The corresponding experimental picture is
also included (between the two most similar numerical simulations). The main
effect appearing when disabling the perfectly hydrophilic condition, that is, now
θH = θV , is that the gas can now be attached to the horizontal channel. Gas
attachment only occurs in the pinch-off zone for small contact angles (such as 25◦

and 35◦), but also appears further away from this zone for larger values (with
45◦, and especially in the extreme case of 90◦). It plays a fundamental role during
the bubble generation process: as the gas thread connecting the bubble to the
single-phase gas adheres to the horizontal channel in the pinch-off zone, the bub-
ble formation process slows down. This effect decreases the value of the bubble
generation frequency, while increasing the bubble volume and length. Note that,
when there is no attachment at all, bubbles have been found to be generated faster
than in experiments, resulting in larger frequencies, as found in (Arias & Mont-
laur, 2017). However, if the value of the contact angle is too high, bubbles become
partially or totally attached to the horizontal channel outside this pinch-off zone,
which results in a non-realistic physical behavior as clearly shown in figure 3 for
the extreme value of θ = 90◦. Therefore, the selection of θ relies on a trade-off
between the necessity of getting slight adherence in the pinch-off region, and the
requirement of having no attachment further away from this zone.

Figure 4 shows the bubble generation frequency as a function of θV (for USL =
0.531 m/s and USG = 0.178 m/s), for numerical simulations with either θH = θV
or θH = 0

◦. Note that the plain lines in figures 4 and 5 aim to help comparing
these two cases, but do not correspond to any interpolation. Numerical simulations
with θH = θV generate bubbles at a smaller rate (larger times are required to
form a single bubble), producing smaller frequencies, as previously discussed. In
addition, figure 4 clearly shows how increasing θV reduces the frequency. Figure 5
shows bubble volume (normalized with the capillary diameter times the cross-

section area) as a function of the contact angle, for the same values of USL and
USG. Bubble volume increases with θV , since it also increases the time required
to form a single bubble. Note that in figures 4 and 5, the experimental values of
frequency (331.2 s−1) and normalized bubble volume (0.538) have been added for
reference as horizontal dash lines. It can be seen that when θH = θV , a value of
θ = 35◦ is needed to get close to the experimental values. Whereas extremely high
and unrealistic values of θV would be needed in the perfectly hydrophilic case,
θV = 90

◦ for the frequency, and θV = 60
◦ for the normalized bubble volume,

confirming the relevancy of the choice of θH = θV .
Finally, the contact angle does not have any major impact on the bubble ve-

locity. Figure 6 shows how several numerical simulations, with different contact
angles, provide values of the velocities close to the experimental one (0.802 m/s),
independently of the value of the contact angle (and whether the horizontal chan-
nel is perfectly hydrophilic or not). This is a logical result since the velocity is
measured in the region of the T-junction where the gas is fully detached. The only
point that is remarkably far away from the experimental result corresponds to the
case with θ = 90◦, in which the bubble is completely attached to the horizontal
channel (non-physically realistic case), see figure 3. This artificially imposed gas
attachment slows down the bubble displacement along the channel, reducing the
bubble velocity.

5 Results and discussion

Numerical simulations satisfactorily reproduce the trains of bubbles obtained in
experiments. Figures 7 and 8 show examples of bubble and slug flow regimes, re-
spectively. These figures show the formation and detachment of one single bubble,

showing several stages during the bubble generation. Contrary to the numerical
results presented in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017) (see figures 5-7 of this reference),
the time Tf required to form and detach a bubble is now the same in experiments
and numerical simulations: 3.0 milliseconds in figure 7 (0.6 millisecond for each
step), and 2.75 milliseconds (0.55 millisecond for each step) in figure 8.

Bubble shapes are also adequately reproduced. Bubbles smaller than the capil-
lary diameter are slightly deviated away from the spherical shape due to the shear
stresses exerted by the liquid, see figure 7. Bubbles bigger than the capillary di-
ameter tend to have bullet-shape bodies, rounded at the front part with a mostly
flatted rear part, see figure 8. Independently of the shape, the detachment process
is simulated in a satisfactory manner in all cases, correctly reproducing the gas
thread connecting the bubble to the single-phase gas. After the detachment, the
elongated rear part of the bubble (a remnant of the squeezed gas thread) readjusts

bubble surface.

Next four sections validate the numerical simulations in a quantitative way by
comparing their results regarding bubble frequency, volume, velocity and length
with experimental data. In figures 9-12, numerical simulations have been plotted
with solid symbols (and noted as Sim.), and experiments with empty symbols
(and noted as Exp.). As commented in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017), errors due to
the selected mesh size and time step are within a relatively small margin (≤ 3.1%
for all selected parameters). From a quantitative point of view, these errors are
similar to the corresponding standard deviations found in experiments. Therefore,
in the following sections, numerical errors obtained within this margin can be
considered as negligible.

5.1 Bubble generation frequency

Figure 9 shows the bubble generation frequency as a function of the superficial
gas velocity, with data from experiments and numerical simulations. The frequency
first follows a close-to-linear tendency (for very low gas flow rate), that progres-
sively curves until reaching a saturation value (for larger gas flow rates). A simple
exponential fit for this behavior is plotted in figure 9 (for each liquid superficial
velocity), whose details can be found in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017). Numerical
simulations satisfactorily describe this behavior and agree qualitatively and quan-
titatively with experimental results. In some cases, experimental and numerical
points even overlap. Errors in frequency for numerical results with respect to ex-
periments have an average value of 3.2%, with a standard deviation of 2.6%, which
are values close to the precision margin of the chosen mesh and time step. Note
that, the errors obtained in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017) (considering only the same
numerical simulations) were up to 17.6% for the average frequency value and 8.7%
for their standard deviation, which clearly shows the improvement in the numerical
results obtained when imposing the θH = θV boundary condition.

5.2 Bubble volume

Figure 10 shows results from experiments and numerical simulations of the bubble
volume, which has been normalized with the capillary diameter times the cross-
section area, that is, V̄B = USG/fφc. In the experiments, the average value of
the bubble volume standard deviations was found to be 0.055, with a maximum
value of 0.156 (corresponding to the case with the largest value of the bubble
volume, USL = 0.106m/s and USG = 0.471m/s). These small values of experi-
mental dispersion in bubble volume show that the bubble formation process was
conducted with high regularity and periodicity in all experiments. Numerical sim-
ulations agree qualitatively with experimental results, bubble volume increasing
with the gas superficial velocity. Numerical errors for bubble volumes are of 2.8%
in average, which is again within the mesh and time step precision margin, with
a standard deviation of 1.9%, resulting in numerous overlapping points for exper-
iments and numerical simulations in figure 10. Once again, these values of error

show great improvement with respect to the numerical results presented in (Arias
& Montlaur, 2017), where an average error of 15.0% for bubble volume and a
standard deviation of 6.9% were obtained.

5.3 Bubble velocity

The drift-flux model predicts that under the hypothesis of non-dominant gravi-
tational forces, the bubble velocity must be proportional to the mixture velocity
(Zuber & Findlay, 1969), that is UG = C0UM , where C0 is called the void fraction
distribution coefficient. Figure 11 illustrates this linear tendency. The value of C0
has been calculated using a linear fitting for the experimental data, resulting in a
value of 1.13. This value is coherent with the values reported in the related liter-
ature for similar two-phase flows (Arias & Montlaur, 2017). Numerical errors for

bubble velocity have an average value of 2.2%, with a standard deviation of 1.3%,
and again the experimental and corresponding numerical points often overlap in
figure 11, improving the errors obtained in (Arias & Montlaur, 2017) of 5.2% for
the average velocity value and 2.9% for the standard deviation.

5.4 Bubble length

The bubble length, normalized with the capillary diameter, is plotted as a function
of USG/fφc in figure 12. Experimental data fit to the linear expression:

L̄B = C1 + C2

, (2)

where C1 = 0.62 and C2 = 0.90 are fitting constants. Equation 2 is similar
to the expressions used by Arias & González-Cinca (2016) for comparable exper-
imental data. As shown in figure 12, the bubble length increases with the gas
superficial velocity, following a linear tendency. Equation 2 has also been plotted
in figure 12. An average difference of 3.4% is obtained between experimental and
numerical results, with a standard deviation of 1.8%. Though Arias & Montlaur
(2017) had not presented any results concerning the bubble length, it has now
been computed in order to quantitatively compare the perfectly hydrophilic and
the non-zero boundary conditions. An average error of 9.9% for the bubble length
and a standard deviation of 6.2% have been found for the perfectly hydrophilic
case, showing again the necessity of the θH = θV boundary condition.

6 Conclusions

This paper studies the influence of the gas-liquid-wall contact angle boundary
condition on 3D-CFD simulations of the bubble generation process occurring in a
capillary T-junction. This paper is a continuation of the previous work of Arias &

Montlaur (2017), which showed the influence of the contact angle but left it as an
open question.

The commercial CFD solver ANSYS Fluent v15.0.7 provided numerical simu-
lations of an air/water mixture in a T-junction, and obtained data were validated
by comparison with experimental data. Small dispersion in size during the bubble
formation process was achieved. Numerical simulations reproduced trains of bub-
bles with similar physical behavior as the one observed in experiments, accurately
reproducing the experimental bubble shapes.

Numerical results showed to be very sensitive to the gas-liquid-wall contact
angle boundary condition. In particular, fixing a non-zero value of the contact
angle boundary condition on the horizontal wall happened to be of critical im-
portance in order to obtain reliable and close-to-experimental numerical results.
The major difference, with respect to (Arias & Montlaur, 2017), is that in this
present work, the same value of contact angle has been imposed on both vertical
and horizontal channel walls, now providing much more accurate results. Values of
θ = 30◦ for UL < 0.415 m/s, θ = 40

◦ for 0.415 < UL < 0.756 m/s and θ = 25
◦ for

UL > 0.756 m/s were found to be the most adequate ones. The study also showed
that increasing the contact angle value decreases the bubble generation frequency
(increasing the bubble volume and length). As for the bubble velocity, it does not
depend significantly on the value of the contact angle, as long as the bubbles do
not totally adhere to the horizontal channel, which would happen in an extreme
and non-realistic case of perpendicular contact angle.

Results on bubble generation frequency, volume, velocity and length were com-
pared between 3D-CFD and experimental data. Relative errors and standard de-
viations of these results prove that the θH = θV boundary condition adopted in
this work is essential, and that it greatly improves the results presented in (Arias
& Montlaur, 2017) (with θH = 0

◦). Therefore, the contact angle boundary con-
dition is a key parameter to obtain accurate results for numerical simulations of
two-phase flows in a capillary.
