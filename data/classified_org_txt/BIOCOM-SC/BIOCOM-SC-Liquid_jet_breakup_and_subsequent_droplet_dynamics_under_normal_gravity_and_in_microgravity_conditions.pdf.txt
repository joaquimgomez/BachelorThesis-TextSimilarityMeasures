We present an experimental study on the characteristics of liquid jets in different con-

figurations. We consider jets injected perpendicular to gravity, jets injected parallel to

gravity, and jets injected in a microgravity environment. We study the role played by

gravity in the jet breakup length and in the dynamics of the droplets generated after

breakup. We analyze droplets obtained in the dripping and jetting regimes, focusing

the study on their size, trajectory, oscillation and rotation. The particularities of the

considered injection configurations are analyzed. In normal gravity conditions, in the

dripping and jetting regimes, the breakup length increases with the Weber number.

The transition between these regimes occurs at Wecr ≈ 3.2. Droplets are notably
larger in the dripping regime than in the jetting one. In the latter case, droplet mean

size decreases as the liquid flow rate is increased. In microgravity conditions, droplet

trajectories form a conical shape due to droplet bouncing after collision. When a

collision takes place, coalescence tends to occur at low modified Weber numbers

(Wem < 2), while bouncing is observed at higher values (Wem > 2). The surface of a

droplet oscillates after bouncing or coalescence events, following a damped oscillator

behavior. The observed oscillation frequency agrees with theoretical predictions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of the different stages in the life of a liquid jet (formation, instability, breakup,

droplet dispersion, atomization) is a key issue for applications in industries such as the phar-

maceutical (drug delivery), electronics (PCB manufacturing), printing (ink-jet injection), car

(diesel engines), or space (liquid rocket engines)1,2. The development of high-speed photog-5

raphy and computer processing power allow the acquisition of new understanding of the

physics involved in the phenomena associated with liquid jets.

The breakup of a falling jet, which gives rise to the subsequent formation of drops and

spray, is determined by various parameters and can be classified into different regimes3,4.

Two main patterns controlled by different forces can be distinguished: large drop and fine10

spray. The instability that leads to the formation of drops with similar size to the jet

diameter is known as the Rayleigh mode. On the other hand, the instability that leads to

the formation of droplets much smaller than the jet diameter is known as the Taylor mode.

In the first case, which corresponds to a regime of low jet velocity, the interaction between the

liquid and the ambient gas triggers the breakup process with the growth of long-wavelength,15

small-amplitude disturbances on the liquid surface. The Rayleigh instability gives rise to the

drop formation by means of capillary pinching. In the Taylor mode, corresponding to a high

jet velocity regime, the breakup instability is associated with the growth of short-wavelength

waves caused by the interfacial shear and pressure fluctuation which generates a spray.

Two different types of instabilities (convective and absolute) are considered in the20

Rayleigh mode assuming a reduced gravity environment. In the convective instability,

a disturbance in a jet grows and propagates only in the downstream direction5. In the abso-

lute instability, the disturbance propagates both downstream and upstream in the absence

of gravity and ambient gas and for a Weber number (We) below a critical value depending

on the Reynolds number of the jet6. Different authors carried out Rayleigh’s linear stability25

analysis around the cylindrical base state of the jet, considering the effects of viscosity,

outside gas, nozzle geometry or system dimensions2,6–9. In normal gravity conditions, three

mechanisms of liquid jet breakup in the laminar regime can be considered: periodic drip-

ping, chaotic dripping, and jetting. The transition between the dripping and jetting regimes

was found to occur at a critical Weber number Wecr
10. The dripping-jetting transition in a30

dripping faucet was studied in different fluids by Ambravaneswaran et al. 11 . The authors

2



obtained phase diagrams showing transitions from simple and complex dripping to jetting.

The variation with We of several quantitative measures of the dynamics for detecting the

transition from dripping to jetting was also obtained.

Concerning the effects of gravity on the shape of liquid jets, Clarke 12 proposed a universal35

solution of a flow of a viscous jet under the influence of gravity. The proposed solution was

a good predictor for the shape and size of viscous liquid jets. Gañán Calvo, Ferrera, and

Montanero 13 , Montanero et al. 14 found that the solution provides very accurate results for

a wide range of Reynolds and Froude numbers.

Although the shape and instability of liquid jets have been extensively studied in normal40

gravity conditions, fewer studies have been carried out in microgravity. Under the action

of gravity, the Navier Stokes equations lead to a universal solution with a monotonically

decreasing jet radius12, while the same equations admit a cylindrical shape in the absence

of gravity. Indeed, one can find a universal scaling of the axial coordinate in terms of

gravity, which becomes singular for g = 014. The study of liquid jets in a microgravity45

environment allows one to investigate the competition between surface forces and inertial

forces at low Weber numbers. As long as gravity is present, a certain volume of liquid is

accelerated, and this often masks the effects of the surface forces. In addition, the study of

liquid jet breakup in microgravity provides an ideal framework in which the characteristics

and dynamics of the generated droplets can be examined for longer periods of time than in50

normal gravity conditions. This makes the microgravity environment very appropriate for

the study of droplet collisions and oscillations. Moreover, the solution of a flow field of a

liquid jet is often expressed under the hypothesis of axisymmetry. However, the only possible

experimental condition in normal gravity in which axisymmetry is valid occurs when the jet

is oriented parallel to gravity. The realization of experiments in microgravity conditions55

is the only possibility in which this gravitational term can be dismissed by maintaining

axisymmetry.

Studies of jets in microgravity have mainly focused on the analysis of instabilities, jetting

modes, and comparison with the behavior of vertically falling jets in normal gravity. Abso-

lute and convective instabilities in liquid jets in reduced gravity were observed by Vihinen,60

Honohan, and Lin 15 for Reynolds number Re < 0.2. O‘Donell, Chen, and Lin 16 determined

experimentally Wecr in the convective-absolute transition in liquid jets in microgravity for

50 < Re < 150. The physics of vertically falling jets, their breakup, and subsequent drop

3



dynamics under normal and reduced gravity conditions and the effects of the two instabilities

on these processes were studied in Edwards et al. 17 . Osborne and Steinberg 18 determined65

experimentally the jetting modes and their corresponding breakup mechanisms as well as

the transitions between jetting and chaotic dripping and between convective and absolute

instabilities in microgravity conditions. In order of decreasing velocity, they observed: de-

velopment of a long slender jet supporting a convective instability, producing drops with a

little variation in size (jetting); a small to non-existent jet that produced drop sizes of great70

variability (chaotic dripping); and a large mass of fluid that accumulated at the nozzle and

did not detach during the experiments (quasi-stable). The transition from jetting to chaotic

dripping was consistent with the theoretical predictions of Clanet and Lasheras 10 . Recently,

Amini, Ihme, and Dolatabadi 19 studied the effect of gravity on the onset and growth rate

of the Rayleigh instability in vertically falling viscous liquid jets. The transition between75

convective and absolute instability was characterized by the expression of a critical We as

a function of capillary and Bond (Bo) numbers. The authors showed that the critical We

decreases with increasing Bo, which explained the shift of the dripping/jetting transition to

lower We when gravity is considered.

The characteristics and dynamics of the droplets generated in the jet breakup play an80

important role in different industrial applications, which has generated the interest of many

researchers for several decades. Teng, Kinoshita, and Masutani 20 predicted the size of

droplets formed during the breakup of cylindrical liquid jets from instability analysis. The

size was found to depend on a modified Ohnesorge number. Cheong and Howes 21 performed

a numerical and experimental study of the capillary instability of jets injected parallel to85

gravity. Drop size in the jetting regime was found to decrease for increasing gravity level,

as was later confirmed in Amini, Ihme, and Dolatabadi 19 . Oscillations in rotating and non-

rotating glycerine/water and silicon oil drops in the microgravity environment provided by

the Space shuttle were studied in Wang, Anilkumar, and Lee 22 . The oscillation of the drops

was generated by two methods different from jet breakup. In one case, the drop started90

oscillating after turning off an acoustic field that kept it levitating. In the other case,

the drop was gyrostabilized through an imposed rotation along an axis, and oscillations

were started by using an imposed field in that axis. The inviscid frequency shift of the

damped oscillations due to nonlinearity was compared to theoretical predictions. Yamada

and Sakai 23 studied the oscillation of micrometric droplets of water, ethylene glycol and 2095

4



cSt silicon oil, generated by the coalescence of two droplets in normal gravity conditions.

Suñol and González-Cinca 24 studied the collision between droplets created after jet breakup

in a low gravity environment, showing that the conical shape of the jet is due to bouncing

events between droplets.

Under normal gravity, if a liquid jet is injected perpendicular to the direction of gravity,100

the shape of the jet is no longer rectilinear but curved. Thus, the axisymmetry is broken

and the problem becomes complex to solve analytically. Uddin and Decent 25 performed a

theoretical study on the instability of liquid jets curved by gravity. The authors carried out

a linear instability analysis to examine the behaviour of the most unstable wavenumber and

the growth rate of instabilities. No experimental data have been found in the literature that105

could confirm the theoretical predictions.

In this paper we carry out an experimental analysis of the liquid jet breakup and sub-

sequent droplet dynamics with the following configurations: jet injected perpendicular to

gravity, jet injected parallel to gravity, and jet in microgravity conditions. We consider

jets in both dripping and jetting regimes, analyzing the breakup length, droplet size and110

trajectories, as well as the droplet surface oscillations. This is the first analysis carried out

comparing the three injection configurations. In addition, the analysis of the liquid jet from

the breakup length of the liquid volume to the droplet collisions and oscillations gives a new

complete view of the different phenomena taking place in an injected jet.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section II, the experimental setup is described.115

Experimental results and discussions are presented in Section III. Finally, the conclusions

of the paper are presented in Section IV.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE

In order to study the liquid jet breakup and droplet dynamics in a microgravity environ-

ment, an experimental setup was designed and built to be used in the Instituto Nacional de120

Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA) Drop Tower (Torrejón de Ardoz, Spain). This facility provides

2.1 s of 10−3 · g0, with g0 = 9.81 m/s2.
The experimental setup consisted of systems for jet generation, data acquisition, control,

and power supply. Fig. 1 shows a picture and a detailed sketch of the setup.

σ = 7.28 · 10−2 N/m) was used as working fluid. The liquid, initially contained in a flexible
reservoir bag (EVA Nutribag 500 ml), was injected through a nozzle (internal diameter dc =

0.7 mm) at controlled flow rates into a rectangular test tank (160 mm long, 200 mm wide,

and 250 mm high). The liquid flow rate QL was varied from 5.00 ml/min up to 15.00 ml/min

by means of a liquid pump (Ismatec MCP-Z Standard). We also used a liquid flow meter130

(Bronkhorst L30) to verify the flow rate in the line. The test tank was made of stainless steel

with two methacrylate windows to allow the visualization of the tank interior. An empty

flexible residual bag (EVA Nutribag 500 ml) was connected to the test tank to avoid any risk

of overpressure.

The data acquisition system was composed of a high-speed camera and the illumination135

subsystem. The camera (RedLake MotionXtra HG-SE), which contained a built-in battery

and an internal memory, was activated when a trigger signal was received just before the

setup was released. The camera recorded the jets at rates between 500 and 1000 frames per

second (recording images with 640× 512 and 640× 256 pixels, respectively), depending on
the experimental run. The spatial resolution of the acquired images was 0.15 mm per pixel.140

The illumination subsystem consisted of a matrix of 280 ultra-bright LEDs and a diffuser

sheet to homogenize the light.

The liquid pump and the data acquisition system were controlled wirelessly by LabView

software.

The capsule containing the experimental setup was released six times (six drops), be-145

tween which QL was the only parameter changed. Experiments were conducted at room

temperature (approximately 20◦ C) and at ambient pressure.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Jets in normal gravity

1. Jet breakup150

In the experimental setup described in the previous section, a jet is created by injecting

liquid at a fixed flow rate QL through a capillary tube oriented perpendicular to the gravity

direction. With this arrangement, two different regimes have been observed under normal

gravity by changing the liquid flow rate. When inertial forces are negligible compared to

surface tension, a drop is formed at the nozzle outlet and grows continuously until it detaches155

from the nozzle. In this situation, the dripping regime, the nozzle leaks (see Figs. 2(a)

and 2(b)). On the other hand, when inertial forces dominate surface forces, the jetting

regime takes place (Figs. 2(c) to 2(e)). In this case, the jet emerging from the nozzle curves

downwards due to the action of gravity. The liquid is contained in a curved cylinder with

surface perturbations of growing amplitude. Once the amplitude equals the cylinder radius,160

the liquid bulk breaks forming droplets. Points in Fig. 3 show the steady-state trajectories

for different values of the Froude number (Fr = v/
√
gdc, where v = 4QL/πd

2
c is fluid velocity

and g is gravity). As expected, faster jets (large Fr) reach larger horizontal positions x for

the same vertical position y.

In order to analyze the transition between the dripping and jetting regimes, the average165

breakup length 〈Lb〉 was obtained for different values of the liquid flow rate. Lb was measured
over N = 500 frames for every QL, and an average value 〈Lb〉 = 1N

∑N
i=1 Lbi was calculated.

The graphical definition of Lb in each regime is shown in Fig. 2 right for the case of injection

perpendicular to gravity (an equivalent definition is used for jets parallel to gravity). In

particular, in the jetting regime, Lb is given by the length of a circular arc from the center170

of the nozzle to the breakup position. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the normalized average

breakup length 〈Lb〉/dc, where dc is the nozzle radius, with respect to We. Results for jets
parallel (‖) and perpendicular (⊥) to gravity are presented in this plot. At low We and Bo
numbers, the nature of the nozzle and thus the contact angle between the liquid and the

nozzle play a crucial role in the determination of the volume of the drop. Therefore, the175

8



results presented in Fig. 4 could change if a different nozzle were employed. Taking this into

account, a comparison of the performance of a given nozzle in the different configurations

can be carried out. Fig. 4 shows that in the dripping regime of the perpendicular jets, the

breakup length increases linearly with We. This behavior differs from what is found when the

injection is parallel to gravity, where the breakup length remains the same for any We in the180

dripping regime (as was also seen, for example, in Fig. 2 in Ambravaneswaran et al. 11). The

transition between dripping and jetting takes place at 2 < We < 3. In the jetting regime,

the breakup length also grows linearly with We. It is interesting to note that 〈Lb〉/dc is
significantly larger in the dripping regime at the highest We than in the jetting regime at

the lowest We in the injection perpendicular to gravity. This behavior could depend on the185

nature of the nozzle and is characteristic of this configuration, since in the case of injection

parallel to gravity the breakup length in the jetting regime is always larger than in the

dripping regime (as was also seen in Ambravaneswaran et al. 11). A careful comparison of

the snapshots in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) confirms that in fact Lb is higher in the dripping regime

(Fig. 2(b)) than in the jetting regime (Fig. 2(c)). This can be explained by the difference in190

the breakup process between the two regimes in the perpendicular jet configuration, which

could also depend on the nozzle characteristics at low We. In the dripping mode, the forming

droplet drags the liquid downwards, resulting in a neck that becomes thinner as the forming

droplet grows. The breakup of the neck generates the droplet. In the jetting mode, droplets

are generated by the Rayleigh instability in which the most unstable surface wave grows195

until the cylindrical shape is broken. This can occur at a very small distance from the

nozzle, as can be observed in Fig. 2(c).

2. Droplet size distribution

Teng, Kinoshita, and Masutani 20 studied the size of the droplets generated after jet

breakup in the jetting regime for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, obtaining the fol-200

where α is an empirical parameter related to orifice effects, which is experimentally de-

Masutani 20 obtained the following expression for α:

α = 1.1303 + 0.0236 ln(3Oh), (3)

which leads to a droplet mean diameter of dm ≈ 2.12dc in our case.205
The size of the generated droplets was measured from the recorded images. Since droplets

oscillate after jet breakup, an equivalent diameter de is defined as the diameter of a spherical

droplet with a volume equal to that of the oscillating droplet. de measurements are carried

out in two-dimensional images, thus the equivalent diameter is given by de = 2
√

Am/π

where Am is the measured area of the oscillating droplet.210

Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) show the droplet size distribution for three values of the liquid

flow rate corresponding to the configuration with the jet oriented parallel and perpendicular

to gravity, respectively. In both configurations, the case QL = 10 ml/min corresponds to the

dripping regime, while in the other two cases a jetting regime is obtained. In the dripping

regime, droplets with de ≈ 4.5 mm detach regularly from the nozzle. The distribution215
function is narrower in the parallel configuration, indicating a lower droplet size dispersion.

At larger values of the liquid flow rate, already in the jetting regime, the droplet mean size

is significantly smaller (de ≈ 2 mm) than in the dripping regime, and decreases as QL is
increased. The distribution function in the jetting regime is much wider than in the dripping

regime, reflecting a higher size dispersion. The larger dispersion in the jetting regime can be220

explained because the distribution functions, despite containing data of droplets generated

after coalescence events, are mainly obtained from the droplets directly generated by the

jet breakup process. In the jetting regime, collisions between droplets after their generation

occurs frequently, resulting in bouncing or coalescence events.

In the jetting regime, the droplet mean diameter obtained experimentally in both con-225

figurations is in good agreement with the prediction given by Eq. 2. The obtained de at

QL = 13.50 ml/min in both configurations is slightly higher than the numerical values ob-

tained in Cheong and Howes 21 (in their Fig. 10, the parameter G is equivalent to 1/2Fr2).

Cheong and Howes studied vertically falling jets with a similar setup to the one presented

in this work. The diameter of their nozzles are 0.65, 0.90 and 1.40 mm, and, in addition230

to water, they used aqueous glycerol solutions. The discrepancy in the value of de can be

explained by the fact of counting droplets after coalescence. However, in the case with

QL = 15.00 ml/min the value of de is in good agreement with Cheong and Howes
21 for both

parallel and perpendicular jets.

3. Droplet trajectories235

After the jet breakup in the dripping regime, droplets fall vertically. In the jetting regime

in the perpendicular configuration, the generated droplets follow a parabolic trajectory due

to the action of gravity. An automatic method has been built to track the position of

the center of the droplets along their trajectory. In Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), the x-coordinate

(injection direction) and y-coordinate (gravity direction) of the droplets center are plotted240

as a function of time for QL = 15.00 ml/min. The region limited by x ∈ [5, 10] mm
and y ∈ [−1,−2] mm corresponds to the breakup zone. At larger values of x and y, droplet
dynamics show a linear and a quadratic behaviour, respectively, corresponding to a parabolic

trajectory.

The trajectories of droplets injected at QL = 15.00 ml/min are shown in Fig. 7 left, where245

the dashed lines correspond to the normal gravity case. The mean of the droplet trajectories

is given by the curve at Fr = 7.8 in Fig. 3. A droplet path reaching larger distances than

the rest (x = 28 mm) can be observed in Fig. 7 left. The origin of this abnormal behaviour

is an irregularity in the jet breakup mechanism as observed in the recorded videos. They

show the generated droplet colliding with a bigger droplet and bouncing, which significantly250

deviates its trajectory. Fig. 7 right shows a sketch of the collision process between two

droplets of a similar size. Droplets can collide if they are at t1 on a converging path or in

parallel trajectories with vi > vj and 0 < b < ri + rj.

B. Jets in microgravity

1. Jet breakup255

When a liquid jet emerges from a nozzle in microgravity conditions, it quickly loses its

cylindrical shape due to the action of inertial and surface tension forces. The cylindrical jet

is perturbed by the competition between cohesive and disruptive forces giving rise to surface

oscillations. Under certain conditions, the oscillations can be amplified and the liquid body

disintegrates into drops at a distance Lb from the nozzle outlet (Rayleigh instability).260

Fig. 8 shows the liquid patterns obtained when a liquid jet is injected at different flow

rates into the test cell in microgravity. At low flow rates, 0 < QL < 10.00 ml/min, inertial

forces are negligible compared to surface tension and a nearly-spherical droplet is formed,

growing without detaching from the nozzle (quasi-stable growth in Fig. 8(a)). At QL = 10.00

ml/min, the generated droplet remains attached to the nozzle but loses its spherical shape265

due to the action of liquid inertia (Fig. 8(b)). At QL = 13.15 ml/min, inertial forces are

strong enough to create a small liquid jet. In this case, jet breaks at a small length and

droplets of different size are generated (chaotic dripping in Fig. 8(c)). At higher liquid

flow rates, QL ≥ 13.50 ml/min, the breakup length increases and the droplet size, with
little variation for a given QL, decreases with the flow rate (jetting in Figs. 8(d) and 8(e)).270

These observations are consistent with previous works (e.g. Clanet and Lasheras 10 , Osborne

and Steinberg 18). Our observations manifest in addition that a liquid injected at a given

QL adopting a jetting regime under normal gravity will show the same regime or chaotic

dripping in microgravity. Moreover, at the flow rates in which a dripping regime is observed

in normal gravity, a quasi-stable growth without breakup is obtained in weightlessness.275

between dripping and jetting regimes occurs at Wecr ≈ 3.2, a slightly lower value than the
one predicted by Eq. 5 in our experimental conditions.285

In order to study the effects of the Weber number on the breakup length Lb, we follow the

procedure detailed in Lefebvre 1 . The maximum growth rate of an axisymmetric disturbance

in the injection direction of a jet is given by qmax = 0.34
√

σ/ρr30 at kr0 = 0.697, where k

is the wavenumber and r0 is the radius of the undisturbed jet. Taking this into account,

an expression for the breakup length of a liquid jet subjected only to inertial and surface290

tension forces as a function of the Weber number can be obtained:

with A = 19.5 and B = 0.85.

In Fig. 10, the normalized average breakup length 〈Lb〉 is plotted as a function of the
Weber number. Data shown correspond to both normal gravity and microgravity conditions.

Each point has been obtained from the average of the values of Lb measured over 500 frames.300

In the jetting regime, Lb in the case of injection perpendicular to gravity does not show any

dependence on the gravity level. In the case of the parallel configuration, Lb slightly decreases

when gravity is considered, as was observed in experiments in Edwards et al. 17 , Cheong

and Howes 21 and numerical results in Amini, Ihme, and Dolatabadi 19 . Therefore we can

conclude that the effects of gravity in the determination of Lb are more important in the305

parallel configuration than in the case of injection perpendicular to gravity. In fact, in this

latter case the effects of gravity on Lb are negligible in the range considered. Thus, while

gravity plays a fundamental role in the path deflection of jets perpendicular to g, the role

played by gravity on Lb turns out to be more important in jets parallel to g. This non-

intuitive observation is due to the fact that when the jet is oriented parallel to the gravity310

force, it is accelerated in the direction of injection which results in a droplet generation closer

to the nozzle since the instability grows faster as the Bond number increases. This result

is in agreement with other experiments17,21 showing that the breakup length is reduced by

gravity, resulting in the formation of smaller droplets.

FIG. 11. Droplet size distribution in microgravity for different liquid flow rates QL.

The experimental points in the jetting regime of the perpendicular configuration are fitted315

to Eq. 8 in Fig. 10 with A = 0.18 and B = 5.95. The discrepancy in the fitting parameters

with respect to Grant and Middleman 26 is presumably due to the fact that our experiments

were carried out in a regime of much lower flow rates close to the dripping-jetting transition.

In microgravity conditions, the interaction of the jet with the environment could play an

important role, in particular at low We27. Therefore, the chaotic dynamics occurring around320

the dripping-jetting regime and right after the jetting regime is established in the absence of

gravity is of different nature than the one reported in normal gravity conditions in previous

works of Clanet and Lasheras 10 , Ambravaneswaran et al. 11 . Thus, the discrepancies found

in the dripping-jetting analysis in microgravity compared to normal gravity could also be

due to the different nature of the chaotic regime.325

2. Droplet size distribution

The size of the droplets created after jet breakup in microgravity conditions has been

measured. Since the majority of the droplets oscillate, the introduction of the equivalent

diameter de becomes necessary.

Fig. 11 shows the droplet size distribution for different values of the liquid flow rate. For330

QL = 13.15 ml/min, the dispersion of the droplet size is significantly wider than in the cases

corresponding to QL = 13.50 ml/min and QL = 15.00 ml/min. This is due to the fact that

QL = 13.15 ml/min corresponds to the chaotic dripping regime, in which the jet breaks up

randomly generating droplets of different size.

As stated before, the maximum growth rate of the jet perturbation takes place at kr0 =335

0.697, which gives a wavelength of the fastest growing disturbance of λ = 4.51dc. After

breakup, a cylinder of length 4.51dc becomes a spherical droplet. Thus, (4.51dc)(πd
2
c/4) =

πd3e/6, which gives and equivalent diameter de = 1.89dc. However, the experimental data

reveal that 2dc / de / 3dc. In all cases, the mean value of the droplet size obtained

experimentally is higher than the theoretical prediction. The disagreement is mainly due340

to droplet coalescence events taking place just after breakup, which can be observed in the

recorded high-speed videos. Coalescence is largely promoted by the oscillation of droplets

after breakup. Even if the distance between droplets is kept constant, the amplitude of the

oscillation can be sufficiently large to allow droplets to collide and, consequently, bounce or

coalesce.345

Fig. 12 shows the droplet size distribution for QL = 13.50 ml/min and QL = 15.00 ml/min

for the perpendicular jet configuration in normal gravity and microgravity conditions. In the

case ofQL = 13.50 ml/min, the droplet size mean value is 〈de〉1g = 2.22 mm and 〈de〉0g = 2.13
mm for normal gravity and microgravity, respectively. In the case of QL = 15.00 ml/min,

the mean values are 〈de〉1g = 1.85 mm and 〈de〉0g = 1.76 mm. Therefore, no significant350
dependence on the gravity level can be observed. As it happens with the behaviour of

the breakup length, this is a characteristics of the injection configuration perpendicular to

gravity.

3. Droplet trajectories

Fig. 13 shows the x-coordinate (being x the direction of injection) of the droplets center355

as a function of time for QL = 15.00 ml/min. The white band without data points between

x = 5 mm and x = 10 mm corresponds to the jet breakup zone. Data have been obtained by

the same tracking method used in the normal gravity case. Although the method encoun-

tered some difficulties to distinguish surfaces when topological changes (due to breakup or

coalescence) took place, and thus a small number of points are misplaced, some information360

can still be extracted from the plot. The alignment of points reveals a small velocity dis-

persion of the droplets generated after breakup. In addition, droplet velocity turns out to

be very similar to the velocity of the jet from which the droplet is generated. On the other

hand, the droplet generation frequency fg can be obtained from the time interval between

two consecutive lines of points. The droplet generation is very regular, with fg ≈ 80 drops/s.365
The case of QL = 13.15 ml/min (chaotic dripping) showed an irregular droplet generation

for which no clear value of fg could be obtained.

Fig. 7 left shows the droplet trajectories for QL = 15 ml/min in microgravity in solid

19



lines. Droplets created after jet breakup keep an initial rectilinear trajectory in the direction

of injection. The deflection is explained by the collision of two droplets after breakup. Thus,370

the cone-shape created by the trajectories is due to droplet collisions near the breakup point.

The collision process is illustrated in Fig. 7 right, where droplet i is approaching droplet j

since |~vi| > |~vj| with impact parameter b 6= 0. Although velocities at time t1 are horizontal,
velocities after the collision (t3) have a non-zero component perpendicular to the direction

of injection.375

When two droplets collide, they can either bounce or coalesce. The result of the colli-

sion depends on the droplets size, the relative velocity between droplets, and the impact

parameter of the collision. In order to determine the role played by these parameters in the

final result of a collision, we introduce a modified Weber number Wem as a function of the

relative velocity vrel = vi−vj between droplets i and j, Wem = ρv2reld∗/σ, where d∗ =
√

didj,380

being di and dj the equivalent diameter of droplet i and j, respectively.

The normalized impact parameter as a function of the modified Weber number is pre-

sented in Fig. 14. The bouncing and coalescence events for the parameter values considered

are indicated. Since the spatial resolution of the images is low compared to the droplet

mean size (approximately 10 pixels per droplet diameter), only four values of b/d∗ could be385

considered (which correspond to 0, 1, 2 and 3 pixels). Coalescence tends to take place at low

modified Weber numbers (Wem < 2), while bouncing occurs at higher values (Wem > 2).

This is in agreement with the fact that coalescence is more likely to occur at low relative

velocity between droplets. It is worth mentioning that all droplets were oscillating before

the collision, which influences the behaviour (bouncing or coalescence) after it.390

C. Droplet oscillations

Droplet surface oscillations can be generated after jet breakup, coalescence, or even after

droplet bouncing. Although gravity is not expected to play an important role in the droplet

oscillations observed in our experiments, analyzing them in a microgravity environment is

advantageous in terms of localization and duration of the phenomenon.395

Two parameters characterizing the droplet oscillation have been measured: diameter dx

in the direction of injection x, and angle φ between the major axis of the droplet and the

y direction. The damping coefficient and the frequency of oscillation are derived from the

modes would lead to differences in φ of 60◦ and 45◦, respectively. The average value of φ in405

Fig. 15(a) and 15(b) tend to increase and decrease, respectively. This behaviour indicates a

rotation of both droplets around their center of mass. The rotation appears to be slightly

faster in the larger droplet.

Fig. 16 shows the evolution of the droplet diameter dx as a function of time for droplets

with equivalent diameter de = 2.01 mm and de = 2.16 mm. Damping coefficient and oscil-410

model:

where A2, γ2 and ω2 = 2πf2 are the amplitude, the damping coefficient and the frequency

of vibration of the second mode, respectively.

FIG. 17. Oscillation frequency (second mode, n = 2) of the droplets as a function of their equivalent

diameter. Points: experimental data. Line: theoretical prediction.

Fig. 17 shows the oscillation frequency measured for different equivalent diameters and

the prediction given by Eq. 11. The measurement of frequency is remarkably more accurate

than that of the damping coefficient, even if the resolution of the images is the same, be-420

cause frequency is measured from the temporal axis. Since droplet size in our experiments

is considerably larger than in the experiments by Yamada and Sakai 23 , the frequency of

oscillation is consistently lower than in their work. The good agreement between our exper-

imental results and the theoretical prediction indicates that the damped oscillator model is

a good approximation, confirming that gravity does not play any role in the frequency of425

oscillation of the considered droplets.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented experimental results obtained under normal gravity and microgravity

conditions which provide new insight into the characteristics of liquid jets and the dynamics

of the droplets generated after their breakup. The main insight gained by our results is430

related to the behaviour of jets injected perpendicular to gravity in the dripping and jetting

regimes as well as the role played by gravity in the observed phenomena. We focused our

investigation on the jet breakup and the characteristics of the generated droplets, namely,

size, trajectory, oscillation and rotation.

In the normal gravity case, two different regimes (dripping and jetting) were observed435

23



at the considered flow rates in jets injected perpendicular to gravity. The variation of

a normalized average breakup length with We was obtained. In the dripping regime the

breakup length increases with We. This behaviour differs from what is found when the

injection is parallel to gravity, in which the breakup length remains the same for any We. In

the jetting regime the breakup length grows linearly with We. The breakup length is larger440

at the highest We value in the dripping regime than at the lowest We value in the jetting

regime. This is a characteristic of the injection configuration perpendicular to gravity.

The analysis of jets in microgravity revealed that the injection of a liquid with We > 3.2

that gives rise to a jetting regime under normal gravity will give rise to a jetting or a

chaotic regime in microgravity. Similarly, in the cases We < 3.2 in which a dripping regime445

was observed in normal gravity, a quasi-stable growth without breakup was obtained in

weightlessness. The transition between dripping and jetting regimes occurs at Wecr ≈ 3.2,
a slightly lower value than the one predicted by theory. In the jetting regime the influence

of gravity on the breakup length in the perpendicular configuration is negligible.

The analysis of the droplet size distribution in normal gravity showed droplets being sig-450

nificantly larger in the dripping regime than in the jetting regime. Size dispersion was larger

in the jetting case, probably because some coalescences just after breakup were considered in

the measurements in this regime. In the two levels of gravity considered, the droplet mean

size decreases as the liquid flow rate is increased. In the jetting regime of the perpendicular

configuration, droplet size did not show any significant dependence on the considered levels455

of gravity.

In normal gravity conditions, although droplets in the jetting regime of jets perpendicular

to gravity follow an expected parabolic trajectory, collisions of droplets after jet breakup

can deviate them to describe much longer paths. In microgravity, droplet trajectories form

a conical shape due to droplet bouncing after collision. When a collision takes place, coales-460

cence tends to occur at low modified Weber numbers (Wem < 2), while bouncing is observed

at higher values (Wem > 2).

We observed the rotation of droplets around their center of mass when their surface

oscillates following a damped oscillator model. The obtained oscillation frequency agrees

with theoretical predictions.465
