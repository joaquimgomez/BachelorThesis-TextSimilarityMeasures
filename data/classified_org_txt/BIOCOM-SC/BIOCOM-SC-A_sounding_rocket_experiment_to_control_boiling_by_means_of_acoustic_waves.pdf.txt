Abstract One of the most critical issues when considering long-term space1
exploration missions is the management and storage of cryogenic propellants.2
The exposure of storage tanks to radiation and extreme temperatures implies3
the need of efficient technologies to counteract their effects on the fuel. A po-4
tentially dangerous effect for spacecraft operations is the generation of vapor5
bubbles in cryogenic propellants. We present an experimental setup and pro-6
cedure to mature a technology based on acoustic waves to control boiling in7
microgravity.8

1 Introduction10

Future long-term space exploration missions will require efficient fuel stor-11
age in microgravity. Cryogenic propellants (affordable cost, environmentally12
friendly) are good candidates for these missions. However, their storage con-13
ditions can be very demanding, particularly regarding temperature. Liquid14
hydrogen, for example, is stored at 20 K. In long-term missions, the persistent15
solar incidence on the fuel tanks can cause heat leaks which in turn could16
generate localized boiling leading to bubble formation. Vapor bubbles under17
reduced g-forces cannot rise up the liquid phase as in terrestrial conditions18
and its accumulation can be hazardous for several vehicle manouvres such as19
engine restart or propellant loading [1].20

The analysis of the characteristics of boiling in microgravity was first ad-21
dressed by Siegel and Keshock [2], and it has been followed by many other22
authors [3,4]. The use of acoustic waves is an efficient method to manage the23
dynamics of gas or vapor bubbles. Bubbles in a standing acoustic wave are24

driven to pressure nodes or antinodes depending on their size [5]. Acoustic25
fields can also modify heat transfer in boiling on ground [6–8] and in micro-26
gravity [9].27

In this paper we present an experimental setup and procedure to study bub-28
ble dynamics in pool boiling under the application of an acoustic field in mi-29
crogravity. The setup was selected by the European Space Agency’s Education30
Office to fly in a sounding rocket under the framework of the REXUS/BEXUS31
programme.32

2 Experimental setup33

The experimental setup was designed taking into account the characteristics34
of the REXUS vehicle (specifications, interfaces, microgravity conditions) and35
with the aim of acquiring valuable information of the phenomenon of study.36
The setup (Fig. 1) consists of a test cell and systems for boiling generation,37
acoustic field generation, data acquisition, and experiment control. A cylindri-38
cal module (height 220 mm, diameter 356 mm) contains the setup in two levels.39
The test cell and most parts of the systems and electronics are in the upper40
level. The computer is the only equipment in the lower level. Fig. 2 shows a41
block diagram with the internal connections in the experimental setup.42

Fig. 1 Experimental setup.

When the rocket reaches the microgravity phase, bubbles are formed in the43
test cell by activating a heater in it, while an acoustic field is generated to act44
on the bubbles. The experiment is monitored by different sensors. The bubble45
dynamics is recorded by means of a video camera.46

2.1 Test cell47

The physical phenomenon of study takes place in the test cell (Fig. 3). Several48
tests were carried out to determine the optimal final design for the purpose of49
the experiment.50

Fig. 3 Test cell.

The cell is made of Aluminum T6061 with dimensions (HxWxL) 61 x 45 x51
58 mm containing HFE7100. The material was chosen given its good structural52
properties for the hypergravity conditions at rocket launch, and given the53
appropriate acoustic properties for the propagation of the wave generated in54
a piezoelectric ceramic (PZT). In order to provide visual access to the inside55

of the cell, it has two windows made of transparent PMMA. The PZT is56
attached by conductive epoxy to the outside of one of the walls perpendicular57
to the windows. On the opposite wall, a heater is placed to heat the liquid58
and generate boiling. The test cell is connected to a waste tank through an59
overpressure valve, so that pressure is kept constant inside the cell and boiling60
temperature does not change during the experiment. The connection is used61
before the experiment to fill the cell by means of a syringe and a second valve.62

2.2 Boiling generation63

The objective of the boiling generation system is to heat the liquid in the cell in64
a controlled way so that bubbles are generated at an inner wall of the test cell at65
an appropriate rate for the purpose of the experiment. Bubbles are generated66
by means of a 1 cm2 area and 0.42 mm thickness Captec (www.captec.fr)67
heating element (Fig. 4), which consists of an electrical resistance heated by68
Joule effect in contact with a heat flux meter and a copper plate. The same type69
of heater has been used in pool boiling experiments in microgravity [10]. The70
heating resistance of 27.3 Ω has a serpentine shape over the surface. Heat flux71
transmitted to the liquid and temperature can be measured by means of the72
flux meter and two thermocouples. Measurements are controlled and recorded73
by an Arduino hardware platform used as an acquisition data module. The74
copper layer (30 µm thickness) is in contact with the fluid and separated from75
the flux meter by a polyamide layer of thickness 150µm.76

The heating power is supplied by a DC-DC converter which offers a max-77
imum voltage of 12 V. The applied voltage (either 6 V or 12 V) is controlled78
by an Arduino Mega 2560 board.79

2.3 Acoustic field generation80

The objective of the acoustic wave generation system is to create an acoustic81
field in the liquid that can modify the dynamics of the bubbles. For this pur-82

pose, a standing wave is generated inside the test cell by means of an electrical83
signal applied to the PZT. The system is composed of the following elements:84

– Function generator (Tabor Electronics 5325 PCI card) to generate and85
control the frequency and voltage amplitude of the applied sinusoidal wave.86

– Amplifier (10x voltage amplifier Tabor Electronics 3322 PCI card). The87
low output voltage amplitude from the function generator leads to a low88
acoustic energy in the liquid, which is insufficient to alter the bubble dy-89
namics. This makes necessary the use of the amplifier, which can provide90
up to 40 Vp-p.91

– PZT with transverse nominal frequency of 160 kHz. It is connected to92
the amplifier output and converts the electrical signal into a mechanical93
vibration.94

– Computer (MXC 4000/2G, AdLink Technology Inc.). It contains the func-95
tion generator and amplifier PCI cards, supplying power to them and con-96
trolling them by means of a LabView code. The computer has no moving97
parts (no fan, SDD).98

A sinusoidal standing wave is generated between the wall with the PZT99
and the opposite wall where the heater is attached. The frequency of opera-100
tion is selected under several criteria. The frequency must generate a pressure101
node at the heater. Since bubbles are smaller than the resonance size, they102
are attracted to the pressure antinodes, thus contributing to the detachment103
of the bubbles from the heater. Moreover, the working frequency is selected104
so that there is a small number of nodes (between 3 and 5) in the liquid. This105
ensures a long enough bubble path towards the antinodes. In addition, reso-106
nance frequencies or their harmonics are preferred since they provide larger107
vibration amplitudes and consequently a larger acoustic force on the bubbles.108

Several tests were carried out to determine the appropriate frequency of the109
acoustic standing wave according to the above criteria. The amplitude of the110
wave in the liquid was measured by means of an hydrophone. Fig. 5 shows the111
acoustic pressure of a wave of 39 kHz in the axis crossing the PZT and heater112
walls at their center. The PZT and the heater are at x=0 mm and x=27 mm,113
respectively. The experimental line corresponds to the measurements obtained114
with the hydrophone. The theoretical line corresponds to the expected form115
of the wave.116

2.4 Data acquisition117

Two types of data are recorded during the experiment for later analysis. A118
GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition video camera (up to 1280x720 pixels at 120119
fps) records the phenomenology taking place inside the test cell. The com-120
puter triggers the camera and data is stored in an SD card. The required121
light is provided by a matrix of LEDs. A diffuser sheet provides homogeneous122
background illumination.123

and the heater are at x=0 mm and x=27 mm, respectively.

An accelerometer and a set of thermocouples also provide data on the124
experiment. The Arduino board is used as a data acquisition device for these125
sensors. Since Arduino has only 10 bits of resolution, a 16 bit ADC (ADS1115126
from Adafruit) is placed between the heater thermocouples and flux meter127
and the Arduino board in order to obtain a higher resolution. One of the128
thermocouples is a T-type and the data acquisition is made by means of a cold129
junction compensator (AD595). Data from the other two sensors are acquired130
using a 16-bit ADC (ADS1115). The second thermocouple has a sensitivity of131
32 µV/C and is compensated by the first one.132

A set of five thermocouples type T are distributed inside the test cell to133
obtain information on the temperature of the liquid, and at different loca-134
tions of the experimental setup to measure the temperature of other devices.135
The Arduino board acquires the temperature measurements from the sensors136
through a cold junction compensator (AD595) that linearizes the ouput signal.137
The signal is amplified and filtered in order to achieve the desired resolution138
and to reduce the noise.139

The accelerometer is placed on the longitudinal axis of the rocket in order140
to record the g-jitter and peaks of acceleration that could affect the bubble141
dynamics.142

2.5 Control software143

A LabView 2013 (National Instruments) code was built to control the following144
processes:145

– Boiling generation (heater power supply).146
– Acoustic wave generation (function generation and amplifier).147
– Thermocouples and accelerometer data acquisition and storage.148
– Uplink and downlink.149

The code includes two optional working modes: Nominal and Test. The150
Nominal mode is planned for the actual flight. The Test mode is used for151
tests with the setup in the lab or in the rocket in which the boiling system152
must not be activated. In this mode, the experiment trasmits to the ground153
segment the correct reception of the trigger signals, but does not activate their154
corresponding protocols. In addition, no data is stored in the Test mode. The155
code allows 5 minutes for the mode selection. If no signal has been received156
after this time, the nominal mode is launched.157

The control software is divided in several stages, most of them running si-158
multaneously. At first, the main variables are initialized and the status values159
are set to zero. In addition, the Arduino and the function generator are initial-160
ized and the output file headers are created. It continues with the temperature161
and acceleration measurements acquisition from the Arduino analogical inputs.162
At some point the main protocols for boiling and acoustic wave generation,163
and camera switch on are activated. The computer is switched off after all the164
protocols have finished.165

The software allows the experiment to be controlled by telemetry. The166
following uplink actions are available from the ground segment:167

– To start the experiment.168
– To check if uplink is working.169
– To select a mode (Test or Nominal).170
– To stop Test mode (in order to run Nominal mode).171
– To shutdown the experiment.172
– To switch on/off the camera.173

The ground segment is able to receive all the experimental data except174
from the video.175

3 Experimental procedure176

At computer switch on (10 minutes before lift-off), the LabView code is177
launched and waits for the first uplink signal to select between the Test and178
the Nominal mode. In case no signal is received, the Nominal mode starts 5179
minutes before the lift-off signal. The start and end times of boiling and acous-180
tic wave generation systems are fixed according to the specific rocket flight181
characteristics (time of motor separation). Since the estimated time for the182
microgravity phase is 134 seconds, the camera and the computer are switched183
off 5 and 10 minutes after lift-off, respectively.184

The aim of the experimental protocol is to manage bubble dynamics by185
detaching and moving them away from the heater. The acoustic wave ampli-186
tude is kept constant during the experiment. A first set of three acoustic wave187
frequencies around 35 kHz is applied for 15 seconds each with the heater on188
just after microgravity conditions are reached. Since this phase starts imme-189
diately after the rocket de-spin and booster separation, the bubble dynamics190
can be affected by the g-jitter. The experiment continues with the application191

of a pair of high (168 kHz) and low (35 kHz) frequencies. The high frequency,192
which is closer to the PZT resonance frequency, is applied for 45 seconds with193
the aim at detaching and moving the bubbles. The low frequency is applied194
for 9 seconds to move the bubbles to the corresponding antinodes. In the last195
35 seconds of the microgravity phase, the pair of high and low frequencies are196
applied in the same way with a larger power applied to the heater in order to197
generate more bubbles.198

All frequencies are applied in sets of three (f, f+∆f and f-∆f) to allow slight199
displacements of the position of the nodes and antinodes of the generated wave.200

4 Conclusions201

We have presented an experimental setup and the corresponding procedure202
to study the dynamics of bubbles generated by boiling under the application203
of an acoustic field in microgravity. The design of the setup is determined by204
the scientific objectives and the characteristics of the sounding rocket. The205
experimental setup run successfully in the REXUS rocket launched in spring206
2016. The analysis of the obtained data will be published elsewhere [11]. The207
scaling of the setup for a further maturation of the acoustic technology in208
other microgravity platforms is straightforward.209
