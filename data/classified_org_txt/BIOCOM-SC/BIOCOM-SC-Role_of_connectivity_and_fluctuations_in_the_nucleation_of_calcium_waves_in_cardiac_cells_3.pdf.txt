Spontaneous calcium release (SCR) occurs when ion channel fluctuations lead to the nucleation of calcium
waves in cardiac cells. This phenomenon is important since it has been implicated as a cause of various cardiac
arrhythmias. However, to date, it is not understood what determines the timing and location of spontaneous
calcium waves within cells. Here, we analyze a simplified model of SCR in which calcium release is modeled as
a stochastic processes on a two-dimensional network of randomly distributed sites. Using this model we identify
the essential parameters describing the system and compute the phase diagram. In particular, we identify a critical
line which separates pinned and propagating fronts, and show that above this line wave nucleation is governed by
fluctuations and the spatial connectivity of calcium release units. Using a mean-field analysis we show that the
sites of wave nucleation are predicted by localized eigenvectors of a matrix representing the network connectivity
of release sites. This result provides insight on the interplay between connectivity and fluctuations in the genesis
of SCR in cardiac myocytes.

I. INTRODUCTION

Calcium (Ca) is a ubiquitous secondary messenger that is
responsible for a vast array of subcellular signaling processes
such as muscle contraction, cell proliferation, and gene
transcription [1]. Ca plays a particularly important role in the
cardiac cell as it mediates the coupling between membrane
voltage and tissue contraction [2]. A central role in Ca
regulation is played by the ryanodine receptor (RyR) which
controls the flow of Ca from intracellular Ca stores to the cell
interior. An important feature of RyR channels is that they are
highly sensitive to Ca and transition from a closed to open
state in a Ca-dependent manner. This Ca sensitivity, which is
mediated by multiple binding sites on the channel, is further
amplified by the close arrangement of RyR channels into
clusters of 10–100 RyR channels [2]. This architecture ensures
that small increases of local Ca concentration can trigger a
domino like opening of an array of RyR channels, leading to a
large local release of Ca [3]. In a cardiac cell there are several
thousand of these clusters organized along equally spaced
planes (Z planes), so that signaling is determined by the number
and timing of these release events. This signaling architecture
is found in a wide variety of cell types and is utilized to control
the spatiotemporal distribution of Ca in the cell [1].

The nonlinear response of RyR receptors in clusters endows
the Ca cycling system with the properties of an excitable
medium. This is because Ca released at a given cluster can
diffuse and activate its nearest neighbors. Thus, under certain
conditions a fire-diffuse-fire wave can propagate in the cell
[4–6]. These Ca propagation events are referred to as sponta-
neous Ca release (SCR) since the release that occurs in this
fashion is typically initiated by a random opening of a single or
group of RyR clusters [4]. These spontaneous Ca waves play
an important role in the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias since
they can lead to membrane depolarization, which, if it occurs
in a population of cells, can induce a focal excitation that prop-
agates in heart tissue [7–9]. These excitations are dangerous
because their timing is random and they can therefore disrupt
the regular beating of the heart and initiate cardiac arrhythmias
[8,10,11]. Despite a great deal of work the basic features of

spontaneous Ca waves (SCR) are still not fully understood.
Experimental and theoretical studies reveal a wide range
of complex spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca depending upon
physiological conditions and cell type [12–16]. In particular
Bar et al. [12] studied stochastic spreading in an array of
discrete sites and identified a nonpropagating to propagating
transition. Interestingly, the propagation dynamics could be
described as a directed percolation process, and also as a
depinning transition depending upon the system parameters.
More recently, Nivala et al. [15] performed numerical and
experimental studies to explore the emergence of SCR as a
function of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) load. These authors
found that at low SR loads Ca sparks typically occur in
the cell in a stochastic manner but rarely transition to Ca
waves. However, as the SR load is increased Ca waves are
nucleated in the cell interior with greater frequency; although
the distance of propagation is small, i.e., the waves tend to fail
after propagating a distance of several micrometers. Further
increases in SR load led to longer propagation distances until
waves propagate the extent of the cell leading to a substantial
release of Ca. In earlier work Marchant and Parker [17] used
fluorescence imaging to analyze the nucleation of Ca waves
in Xenopus oocytes. In these cells Ca release is governed
by clusters of inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) receptors
which mediate the flow of Ca in similar fashion as do RyRs
in cardiac cells. They found that waves tend to nucleate at
specific regions of the cell characterized by a higher density
of release sites and sensitivity to stimulation. Furthermore,
they noticed that when the period between Ca waves was
long then wave nucleation occurred at specific sites with
greater reliability. While these studies shed light on various
aspects of subcellular Ca dynamics, several questions remain
unanswered. For example, it is not known how the spatial
distribution of calcium release units (CRUs) combines with
fluctuations and excitability to determine the location of wave
nucleation sites in the cell.

In this paper we explore a simplified theoretical model
that can be used to understand essential features of Ca wave
nucleation and propagation. We analyze in detail the role of

the random arrangement of CRUs inside the cell, the strength
of diffusive coupling, and the kinetics of spark activation and
extinguishing. Our goal is to determine how these properties
determine the location and timing of spontaneous Ca waves
in cardiac cells. Using this approach, we show that the
dynamics of SCR is crucially dependent on two important
parameters. The first is the ratio of the length scale over
which Ca diffuses from a Ca spark to the average distance
between release sites in the cell, which gives a measure of
the degree of coupling between CRUs in a cell. The second
parameter is the amount of Ca released during a Ca spark,
which determines the excitability of the system. We find that
for large excitability, fluctuations play the leading role in the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the system. In this regime Ca
waves are nucleated randomly in the system, and the spatial
arrangement of release sites does not determine the sites of
wave nucleation. However, as the excitability is reduced it
is the spatial arrangement of Ca release sites which dictates
the location of wave nucleation. More precisely, we show
that the sites of wave nucleation are determined by eigenvec-
tors of the network connectivity matrix, which represents the
strength of diffusive coupling between CRUs. Using a mean-
field theory we argue that the initiation of SCR can be viewed
as a barrier escape process, which favors wave nucleation at
the sites of eigenvector localization. These results help explain
several key experimental observations of Ca wave nucleation
in biological cells [17]. In particular, they give a quantitative
approach to identify sites that are prone to initiate Ca waves,
and explain why wave nucleation occurs at these sites, with
higher likelihood, as the system excitability is reduced.

II. THE MODEL

A. Biophysical background

In Fig. 1 we illustrate the basic architecture of subcellular
Ca signaling in cardiac cells. Here, RyR channels form clusters
of 10–150 channels which are distributed in the cell along
planar invaginations referred to as Z planes. In this study
we will refer to each of these clusters as a Ca release unit.
Along each Z plane the distribution of CRUs is random with
an average spacing in the range 100–500 nm while the spacing
between planes is in the range 1–2 μm [18,19], so that there are
roughly 100 CRUs on a Z plane and about 104 in the cell. Under
normal conditions RyR channels are stimulated by the opening

FIG. 1. (Color online) Illustration of the Ca signaling architec-
ture. CRUs contain a few (1–5) LCC channels and a cluster (10–150)
of RyR channels responsible for Ca signaling. In ventricular myocytes
CRUs are distributed along roughly 50–100 Z planes with ∼100 CRUs
within each plane.

of voltage-gated L-type Ca channels (LCCs) which raise the
local concentration. However, under conditions of Ca overload
fluctuations of RyR channels from the closed to the open state
can induce spontaneous Ca sparks. In this case an RyR channel
opening leads to a local increase in Ca which can diffuse and
induce additional openings of the channels in the cluster. This
process is highly nonlinear and leads to a substantial increase
of local Ca which can, in some cases, diffuse and stimulate
nearest-neighbor CRUs. When this occurs a Ca wave can
be nucleated which can spread across the cell and induce a
substantial release of Ca. It is these release events which are
believed to underlie various cardiac arrhythmias.

B. A simple model of stochastic wave nucleation

In this study we will apply a minimal model in order to
explore the relationship between the arrangement of CRUs
and the nucleation of Ca waves. Given the complexity of the
local RyR kinetics in a cluster we will simplify the system
by modeling the ith CRU using a state variable ηi , which
can be ηi = 0 (no spark) or ηi = 1 (spark). To model the
stochastic dynamics of Ca sparks we let the state variable
obey the reaction scheme

0
αi�
βi

1, (1)

where αi is the rate at which sparks are ignited at site i, and
where βi is the rate at which a spark at that site is extinguished.
Since RyR cluster openings are regulated by the local Ca
concentration, we will take the forward rate to be αi = gicγi ,
where ci is the local Ca concentration at site i, gi represents the
excitability of that CRU, and γ is an exponent that describes the
nonlinear dependence of the spark activation rate on the local
Ca concentration. Experimental studies reveal that the open
probability of RyR channels is a nonlinear sigmoid function of
the local Ca concentration [3,20]. Thus, given the Ca-mediated
cooperativity between RyR channels in the cluster, we expect
that the rate of spark formation should have a highly nonlinear
dependence on the local Ca concentration. To account for this
nonlinearity we will set γ = 2 in this study. Furthermore, we
note that in the cell Ca sparks terminate due to inactivation or
SR depletion. Here, we focus only on the dynamics of wave
nucleation, and neglect the role of slow recovery processes due
to a previous excitation.

In this study we will focus on spontaneous Ca waves that
occur due to RyR channel openings, and so we will consider
the case where the LCC channels are shut. In this case the local
Ca concentration at a CRU is given by

ci(t) = co +
∑
j �=i

hij (t) ηj (t), (2)

where co is the background Ca concentration, and where hij (t)
gives the rise in the local Ca concentration at site i due to
an active Ca spark at site j (ηj = 1). To model interactions
between CRUs we note that the solution of the diffusion
equation in an isotropic medium requires that the concentration
at site i due to Ca released at site j should fall off proportionally
to exp[−d2

ij
/4D(t − tj )]. Here, dij is the distance between the

CRUs, D is the effective diffusion coefficient of Ca, and tj is
the activation time at site j . Here, we make the simplification
that sites which influence site i are activated at roughly the

determined by the exponential dependence on d2

. To model

this effect we will consider coupling between CRUs of the form

hij = rj exp[−|�xi − �xj |2/l2], (3)
where rj represents the Ca released at site j , �xi and �xj are
the locations of the ith and j th CRUs in the cell, and l is a
diffusive length scale. Alternatively, we note that Ca buffers
in the intracellular space will also determine the concentration
of Ca away from the source. This problem has been addressed
in detail [21], and it is found that the concentration away from
a source of Ca should decay as ∼(1/dij ) exp(−dij / l), where
l is a length scale that is dependent on the buffer kinetics and
diffusivity. In both cases the site-to-site coupling is effectively
short ranged and is characterized by a length scale l which
will be systematically varied in our model.

C. System parameters

To model the spatial distribution of active sparks in a
cell we will study the time evolution of our system in two
dimensions (2D). Thus, we consider the dynamics of N
CRUs that are placed at random locations on a square of
size L × L, so that the ith site is placed at location (xi,yi),
where xi and yi are chosen from a uniform distribution in
the interval [0,L]. This arrangement introduces a length scale
which is the average minimum distance between CRUs. This
distance can be estimated to be d ∼ L/2

√
N , so that a natural

dimensionless parameter that characterizes the system is the
ratio s = l/d = 2

√
N l/L, which gives a measure of the length

scale of diffusive interactions compared to the average CRU
spacing. Hereafter, we will refer to the parameter s as the
spatial coupling strength. In this study we will consider the
case where each CRU is equivalent so that αi = α, βi = β,
gi = g, and ri = r . Also, we take the diffusive length scale
to be a constant with lij = l, so that the heterogeneity in
the system originates only from the spatial arrangement of
CRUs on the plane. The parameter r will be referred to as
the excitability of the system since it gives a measure of the
amount of Ca released at a CRU. To fix the system parameters
we will rely on existing experimental observations of Ca sparks
and waves. First, we will assume that Ca can diffuse between
nearest neighbors depending on the amount of Ca released
at each CRU. At high SR loads we expect that Ca released
at a CRU can diffuse to several nearest neighbors so that we
will consider spatial coupling in the range 0 < s < 6. Also,
we will also take co = 0.01 μM and let the spark rate of an
isolated CRU be α ∼ 0.001 ms−1, which is roughly one spark
every second. Since α = gc2o this will fix g = 0.5 ms−1 μM−2.
Finally, we note that since a Ca spark typically lasts for a
duration 20–50 ms, we will take β = 0.05 ms−1.

D. Spatiotemporal dynamics

In Figs. 2(a)–2(c) we show the spatiotemporal evolution of
active sites starting with initial conditions such that all sites are

inactive (ηi = 0). Our numerical simulations reveal that there
are two distinct phases of the system. In one case, illustrated by
Fig. 2(a), Ca sparks are nucleated at localized regions of the
system and proceed to spread rapidly as an advancing front
of active sites, with ηi = 1, which invades the surrounding
inactive region with ηi = 0. In Fig. 2(a) we show the spatial
distribution of active sites for a short time interval following
nucleation of the advancing front. In this regime the total
number of active sites, denoted as n(t), increases rapidly once a
wave is nucleated [Fig. 2(d), red trace], and the system settles to
a final steady state where most of the sites are in the active state.
In the case where the excitability and coupling are reduced we
see that waves are not nucleated in the system [Fig. 2(b)].
Here, the system slowly evolves towards a state where active
sites form a sparse random pattern, where each unit fluctuates
with time according to the local stochastic dynamics. In this
case, the evolution of the spatial pattern does not occur via a
coherent activation front but rather in a gradual fashion where
the pattern of activity spreads in a diffuse manner. In this case
we find that the number of active sites increases on a much
slower time scale [Fig. 2(d), blue trace]. As the coupling is
reduced further [Fig. 2(c)] the spreading of active sites occurs
even more slowly, and settles in a sparse random pattern where
only a few sites are active [Fig. 2(d), green trace]. Here, we
find that the steady state is governed by clumps of active sites
spread randomly throughout the system. These distinct cases
are representative of the possible spatiotemporal evolution of
the system.

E. The propagation and timing of Ca waves

An important feature of the spatiotemporal dynamics is the
nucleation of propagating Ca waves. To analyze the dynamics
of waves we study the evolution of a front in 2D that joins
a region of high activity with ηi = 1 with an inactive region
with ηi = 0. Our goal is to determine the conditions for which

the planar front advances in our system. To investigate this
transition in the most simple setting we chose initial conditions
such that all points on our L × L square with x � L/2 are
set to the value ηi = 1, and all points x > L/2 are ηi = 0
[Fig. 3(a)]. To track the evolution of the front we average ηi
in the y direction in bins of size �x = 1/40 along the x axis.
In Fig. 3(b) we show the time evolution of this projection,
showing that fronts can propagate from the active to the
inactive state. Analysis of these fronts reveals that for a given
excitability r there is a critical coupling sw, which we will
refer to as the front propagation threshold, such that fronts
will propagate with s > sw but remain pinned for s < sw.
In Fig. 3(c) we plot the function sw(r) which separates the
propagating and nonpropagating regions of phase space.

To characterize the timing of wave nucleation we chose
initial conditions so that all sites are inactive (ηi = 0), and
determine the average waiting time T for a Ca wave to be
nucleated in the system. Our criterion for wave nucleation is
that the fraction of active sites exceeds 80% of the total number
of CRUs in the system. In Fig. 4 we plot the average wave
nucleation time, averaged over 100 independent simulations,
as a function of the system excitability r, and for a range of
values of the spatial coupling s. This result reveals that as the
excitability r is reduced the wave nucleation time increases
substantially. Specifically, we find that as r approaches the
propagation threshold the first passage time T appears to
diverge. In practice, simulation times become exceedingly
large and we show results only up to a mean waiting time
of T = 1000 ms.

F. Steady state dynamics

To further characterize the system we have computed the
long-time dynamics of active sites. Thus, we compute the
time dependence of the average number of active sites, which
we define as 〈η(t)〉 = (1/N ) ∑N

i=1 ηi . Since the steady state

dynamics depends crucially on initial conditions we will
consider the dynamics of 〈η(t)〉 for a broad range of initial
conditions. Thus, we consider initial conditions so that the
probability that a site is active (ηi = 1) is taken to be p, and
where p will be varied in the range 0 to 1. In Figs. 5(a)–5(c)
we show the time evolution of 〈η〉 for a range of excitability
r , and where the coupling is fixed at s = 4. Based on these

simulations we identify three distinct steady state behaviors.
For small values of r we find that the system evolves towards
a low-activity state where 〈η〉 ∼ 0 [Fig. 5(a)], independently
of initial conditions. As r is increased further we find that
〈η〉 evolves towards multiple values depending upon the initial
conditions [Fig. 5(b)]. Hereafter, we will refer to this regime
as the multistable phase. In Fig. 5(e) we show snapshots of
the active sites at steady state. In this regime, different initial
conditions evolve towards distinct nonhomogeneous steady
states. Finally, for larger r values the system again evolves
to a state where η ∼ 1 independently of initial conditions
[Fig. 5(c)]. To further quantify this behavior, in Fig. 5(d) we
plot the value of 〈η〉 after a time of t = 5000 ms, for a range
of initial conditions. We have taken the value at this time since
it is much longer than the transient dynamics observed, and
the system appears to have reached steady state. Indeed, we
find that for a range of excitabilities (ra < r < rb) 〈η〉 can
attain several distinct values, while outside this range 〈η〉 ∼ 0
for r < ra and 〈η〉 ∼ 1 for r > rb. To quantify this finding
we have also computed the variance σ of the steady state

value of 〈η〉. Hence, we compute σ =
√

〈η〉2 − 〈η〉2, where
x̄ denotes the sample average of x over the different initial
conditions. As shown in Fig. 5(d) (red line) the variance σ
increases substantially in the multistable phase of the system
(ra < r < rb).

Our simulations indicate that above the wave propagation
threshold the system evolves towards the active state where

by finding the parameter r where the variance σ just exceeds 0.05.

〈η〉 ∼ 1. Thus, we expect that the transition from the active
to multistable phase, at r = rb, should coincide with the wave
propagation threshold. To check this hypothesis we have com-
pared the wave propagation threshold to the onset of the
multistable phase. To determine the onset of the multistable
phase we note that the variance σ rises as r is decreased to
r = rb [Fig. 5(d)]. Thus, an accurate marker for the onset of
multistability is the value of r such that the variance has risen to
the value σ = 0.05. In this way we can compute a quantitative
estimate for the onset of the multistable phase. In Fig. 6 we
have plotted the onset of the multistable phase along with the
wave propagation threshold. Indeed, we find that these two
lines are very close to each other. This result indicates that,
as expected intuitively, the onset of the multistable phase
coincides with the threshold for wave propagation.

III. MEAN-FIELD THEORY

A. Deterministic mean-field theory

The numerical simulations of our stochastic spark model
reveal rich spatiotemporal properties. In order to understand
basic features of the system we develop a simplified mean-
field theory which will shed light on various aspects of the
dynamics. Let us first define the spark probability Pi(t) to be
the probability that the ith CRU is active [ηi(t) = 1] at time
t . The stochastic dynamics is then governed by the master
equation

Pi(t + τ ) = [1 − Pi(t)](αiτ ) + Pi(t)(1 − βiτ ), (4)
where αiτ and βiτ are the transition probabilities that site i
makes a 0 → 1 or 1 → 0 transition in the time interval τ . To
simplify the dynamics we will make the approximation that the
state variables can be replaced by their averages so that ηj ≈
Pj , and the local Ca concentration can be approximated by
ci ≈ co +

∑
j �=i hij Pj (t). In the continuum limit the master

equation then simplifies to the system of equations

which describes the time evolution of the spark probability
Pi(t).

B. Steady state dynamics of the mean-field equations

To analyze the dynamics of the mean-field equations
we first consider steady state solutions to the N nonlinear
equations given in Eq. (5). To distinguish steady state solutions
we keep track of the average site probability defined here
as 〈P (t)〉 = (1/N) ∑N

i=1 Pi(t), and denote the steady state
occupation probability as 〈P 〉∞ = 〈P (t → ∞)〉. To capture
the system behavior over a wide range of parameters we will
compute 〈P 〉∞ vs the excitability r , for different values of
the dimensionless ratio s. As in the full stochastic model
Eq. (5) can have multiple steady state solutions, which can
be reached depending upon the initial conditions chosen.
Thus, we consider a range of initial conditions of the form
Pi = p + ξi , where p is an average that will be varied, and
where ξi is a uniformly distributed random number with an
average 〈ξ 〉 � p. By considering the time evolution of an
ensemble of initial conditions, with varying p and 〈ξ 〉, we
can then explore the possible steady state solutions to Eq. (5).
Our main results are summarized in Fig. 7(A) where we have
plotted 〈P 〉∞ vs r for a fixed coupling of s = 2.5. We find
that for r < ra then there is effectively only one steady state
solution vector Pi with 〈P 〉∞ ∼ 0 [Fig. 7(a)]. This solution
corresponds to the inactive state of the system where the steady
state probability of active sites is low. For larger excitability r
we find that there is a region of parameter space between ra and
rb where there are multiple steady state solutions which can
be reached depending upon the initial conditions [Fig. 7(b)].
However, for larger excitability (rb < r < rc) we find that
these multiple states collapse into effectively two distinct
solutions. In this regime the system is bistable and can be in
either the active state (〈P 〉∞ ∼ 1) where most sites are active,
or the inactive state where the system is quiescent (〈P 〉∞ ∼ 0)
[Fig. 7(c)]. For even larger excitability r > rc the lower branch
vanishes and the system evolves to a single unique solution
in which 〈P 〉∞ ∼ 1 [Fig. 7(d)]. In order to characterize
the steady state behavior of the mean-field equations we
have constructed the full phase diagram of the mean-field
theory. In Fig. 8 we plot the boundaries separating the
monostable, bistable, and multistable phases of the mean-field
equations.

As in the full stochastic model we find that the mean-
field equations also possess propagating front solutions. To
investigate the wave propagation threshold we simulate the
time evolution of a planar front in 2D which joins the active
(Pi = 1) and quiescent (Pi = 0) states. In Fig. 8 we show the
wave propagation threshold in parameter space (red dashed
line). Above this line a planar front of active sites invades
the region of inactive sites, while below, the front remains
pinned or is extinguished. Indeed, we find that, as in the full
stochastic model, the wave propagation threshold coincides
with the bistability-multistability transition line.

C. The role of fluctuations

A basic limitation of the mean-field theory is that it

where ξi(t) is a Gaussian noise term that satisfies
〈ξi(t)ξj (t ′)〉 = D2δij δ(t − t ′) , and where 〈ξi(t)〉 = 0. In this
scenario the deterministic equations are driven by uncorrelated
noise which should mimic the effect of stochastic fluctuations
from the reaction scheme given by Eq. (1). In this study we
seek to explore the qualitative behavior of Eq. (6) and so
we will consider the system behavior for a wide range of
noise strengths. Thus we will choose our noise amplitude so
that D =

√
〈ξ 2〉 is in the range 10−4–10−2. Equation (6) is

solved directly using a standard Euler scheme [22], where it is
necessary to introduce a boundary condition that fluctuations
cannot induce unphysical probabilities below zero. Thus,
during the numerical time stepping we impose the condition
that Pi = 0 when Pi < 0.

To explore the behavior of Eq. (6) we will compute the
long-time dynamics of the average probability 〈P (t)〉. First,
we note that the deterministic ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) [Eq. (5)] reach steady state in a time t ∼ 100 ms. Thus,
we will approximate the steady state average probability to be
〈P 〉∞ = 〈P (t = 1000 ms)〉. In Fig. 9(a) we show 〈P 〉∞ vs r
for a range of values of the noise amplitude D. We find that
as D is increased, the range of excitability r , where bistability
and multistability are observed, is substantially reduced. In

particular, for D = 10−2 the bistable regime is eliminated and
the dispersion of the multistable phase is reduced. The reason
for this decrease in dispersion is illustrated in Fig. 9(b) where
we show the effect of noise on the temporal evolution of the
system. In this simulation we have chosen r = 0.16 so that the
deterministic system is in the multistable phase. For times t <
800 ms we set D = 0 and let the system evolve towards distinct
steady state values depending upon the initial conditions. For
times t > 800 ms we turn on noise so that D = 10−2 and
observe that 〈P (t)〉 evolves towards a smaller set of steady state
values. Here, we find that the steady state behavior attained
in the deterministic limit is unstable to noise perturbations
so that a new set of steady state values is attained once the
noise is turned on. In Fig. 9(c) we plot the mean waiting
time to wave nucleation when the noise amplitude is D =
10−2. Indeed, consistent with our stochastic model (Fig. 4),
we find that the mean waiting time diverges rapidly as the
excitability is reduced towards the wave propagation threshold.
These numerical results indicate that the mean-field equations
with noise capture key features of our stochastic system.

D. Linear stability analysis

Our numerical analysis of the deterministic mean field
equations [Eq. (5)] reveals a complex phase diagram. A distinct
feature of the system is that for large excitability r > rc the
steady state solution with Pi ≈ 0 becomes unstable, and the
system always evolves towards the fully active state with
Pi ≈ 1. To analyze this transition we consider the stability
of the Pi ≈ 0 solution. In this case we expand Eq. (5) near the

steady state solution p∗
i

so that Pi = p∗i + ui , where ui is a
small perturbation. Expanding to linear order in ui gives the
linear system of equations

the condition λ1 � 0.

To simplify the analysis further we note that the steady
state occupation probabilities are small so that p∗

g(co + 〈q〉)2] + 2gr(co + 〈q〉)λc, where λc is the leading
eigenvalue of the matrix Cij , and where the spatial evolution of
the system is governed by the eigenvector which corresponds
to λc.

E. Localization of eigenvectors

The linear stability analysis allows us to understand the
spreading of activity from an initially low active state.
According to Eq. (9) the initial spreading dynamics will be
dictated by the eigenvectors which correspond to the largest
eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix Cij . Here, we will
explore the spatial structure of these eigenvectors in order to
determine the nucleation sites of Ca waves. To determine the
shape of the leading eigenvector �φ1 we rescale the eigenvector
components, denoted as φ1i , so that the component with
the maximum magnitude has the value 1. We then plot φ1i
vs i where the ith component is that component with the
ith largest magnitude. The ordered magnitudes for a system

of N = 1000 sites, and for different values of the coupling
parameter s, are shown in Fig. 10(a). This result indicates that
eigenvector components are strongly peaked at a small fraction
of sites in the system. In this case we find that the eigenvector
amplitudes are concentrated on fewer than 5% of the sites
in the system. In order to visualize the spatial distribution
of the leading eigenvector we have also plotted all spatial
sites with eigenvector components with magnitude φ1i > 0.5.
In Fig. 10(b) we show the spatial distribution of these sites
for different values of the coupling parameter s. This result
demonstrates that the eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix
Cij are localized at specific regions in the system.

To explore further the factors that determine the sites
of eigenvector localization we have computed the spatial
distribution of the density of release sites. First, we note
that to compute the density it is necessary to chose an
appropriate length scale. A natural length scale to pick is
the effective localization length of the leading eigenvector,
which we will denote here as lc. Thus, we measure the
effective radius of the the leading eigenvector by computing
the radius of the smallest circle that encloses all sites with
φ1i > 0.5. Using this length scale lc we then compute the
density within squares of size lc × lc. In Fig. 10(c) we plot
the leading eigenvector for a particular configuration of sites,
and where we have picked the dimensionless parameter to
be s = 2 and s = 3. Here, we observe that the region of

localization of the leading eigenvector is different in the two
cases, even though the underlying spatial distribution of points
is identical. On the same plot we identify the highest density
of points within squares of size lc × lc. Indeed, we find that
the leading eigenvector coincides with the region of highest
density at the given scale. This result demonstrates that the
leading eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix are localized
at high-density regions.

IV. THE SITES OF Ca WAVE NUCLEATION

Our linear stability analysis reveals that the inactive state
(ηi = 0) is unstable when λ1 > 0, and that spreading will
be localized on a few sites determined by the leading
eigenvector �φ1. In this section we will proceed directly to
the full stochastic model to determine the spatial distribution
of nucleation sites. To determine these nucleation sites we
simulate the stochastic evolution of the initially quiescent state
and determine the spatial distribution of active sites at the onset
of wave nucleation. To achieve this, our approach was to first
determine the time ta where the number of active sites reached
3% of the steady state number of active sites (n∞) after wave
nucleation. This simulation is repeated for M times, and for
each site i in our system we compute the ratio ρi = ni(ta)/M ,
where ni(ta) is the total number of instances when site i is
active at the nucleation time ta . Using this approach we can
construct the spatial density of active sites at the onset of wave
nucleation. In Fig. 11(a) we show the spatial density of active
sites in our system computed using M = 20 000 simulation

runs. In this simulation we find that most of the waves are
nucleated at a specific localized region in the system (see
density scale). In Fig. 11(b) we plot all sites with magnitude
greater than 0.1 for the eigenvectors corresponding to the three
largest eigenvalues.

Our numerical simulations reveal strong correlations be-
tween the leading eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix
Cij and the density of Ca wave nucleation sites. To check
this prediction quantitatively we have computed the Pearson
correlation coefficient between the leading eigenvector �φ1
and the density vector �ρ at the onset of wave nucleation. To
compare these two vectors we compute their similarity using
the standard Pearson correlation coefficient which is given by
the quantity

C( �ρ, �φ1) =

(ρi − 〈ρ〉)(φ1i − 〈φ〉)√∑N

so that C( �ρ, �φ1) ∼ 1 or 0 if the vectors are strongly cor-
related or uncorrelated. In Fig. 11(c) we plot the Pearson
correlation coefficient C vs the excitability r , showing that
the correlation increases as the excitability is decreased
towards the wave propagation threshold. This result demon-
strates that the leading eigenvector of the connectivity ma-
trix becomes increasingly predictive of the spatial distribu-
tion of wave nucleation sites as the system excitability is
decreased.

The relationship between the leading eigenvector and the
nucleation site probability distribution should also hold in

the mean-field theory with noise [Eq. (6)]. To check this
result we chose parameters above the wave propagation
threshold, and consider the time evolution of a sparse initial
pattern with 〈P 〉 ∼ 0. In this parameter regime we measure
the time ta when the average site probability has increased
to 〈P (ta)〉 = 0.1. We then compute the Pearson correlation
C( �P (ta), �φ1) where �P (ta) is the probability of release sites
at the onset of wave nucleation. In Fig. 12(a) we plot C
vs r , which shows that the correlation increases as the
excitability r is decreased. On the same graph we overlay the
steady state average 〈P 〉∞ computed using the deterministic
mean-field theory. Here, we note that the leading eigenvector
is predictive of the wave initiation sites for r < rc, which
is the regime in which the leading eigenvector is stable
(λ1 < 0). These results indicate that the leading eigenvector is
predictive of the sites of nucleation up to the wave propagation
threshold.

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have developed a simplified stochastic
model of Ca wave nucleation in a cardiac cell. In this setting,
the spatiotemporal dynamics can be characterized using the
excitability r , which is the amount of Ca released during
a spark, and the spatial coupling s, which is the ratio of
the distance Ca ions diffuse during a spark to the average
spacing between release sites. In terms of these parameters we
show, in Fig. 12(b), an illustration of the phase diagram of
the system. Here, we identify a critical line (red dashed line)
that separates pinned and propagating excitation fronts. This
transition line has been observed in previous studies and is
due to the spatial discreteness of the system [12,13]. In effect,
the spatial separation between release sites ensures that there
is always a critical excitability below which waves cannot
propagate. A numerical study of the regime of propagation
revealed that the waiting time to a nucleation event diverges as
the excitability is reduced towards the propagation threshold.

Furthermore, we show that as the critical line is approached
wave nucleation tends to occur at regions in which the leading
eigenvector of the connectivity matrix Cij is peaked. In this
regime it is the spatial arrangement of release sites that dictates
where fluctuations initiate wave nucleation. However, further
away from the critical line there is a regime of high excitability
where small fluctuations are sufficient to nucleate waves. In
this regime fluctuations dominate nucleation kinetics and the
arrangement of CRUs does not play an important role. In
particular, in the limit of large r wave nucleation occurs at
the first 0 → 1 transition, so that wave nucleation occurs at
any site with equal probability. Now, below the critical line we
also observe rich dynamical behavior. In particular, we identify
a multistable phase where the steady state activity levels form
random patterns that are dictated by initial conditions. In this
regime waves do not propagate and so there is no mechanism
to drive the system to the fully active state. On reducing the
excitability further we also identify a phase where the system
is trapped in a low-activity state. In this regime cooperativity
between release sites is weak and the system can be described
as a collection of independent sites.

The rich spatiotemporal dynamics of our system can be ex-
plained by the interplay between noise and the time evolution
of the deterministic mean-field equations [Eq. (5)]. For large
excitability (r > rc) the deterministic mean-field equations
possess propagating wave solutions, and the quiescent state
is unstable since λ1 > 0. In this regime wave nucleation is
deterministic and the presence of advancing fronts ensures that
the same steady state is reached independently of initial condi-
tions. In effect, propagating fronts smooth out inhomogeneities
and the presence of noise does not change the qualitative
behavior of the system dynamics. Now, for rb < r < rc the
deterministic mean-field equations exhibit bistability since
the quiescent state with Pi ∼ 0 is stable (λ1 < 0). In this
regime fronts advance in the system so that the active branch
with 〈P 〉 ∼ 1 can be reached only if there is a sufficiently
large region of active sites. Now, in the presence of noise,

052715-11



HERNANDEZ-HERNANDEZ, ALVAREZ-LACALLE, AND SHIFERAW PHYSICAL REVIEW E 92, 052715 (2015)

fluctuations can induce a large enough region of active sites
that will propagate in the system. Thus, the time evolution
of the quiescent state will be governed by stochastic wave
nucleation, which is characterized by a mean-first-passage
time T . In effect, bistability will be observed in the fully
stochastic system only if the state of the system is evaluated at
a time t < T . For t > T wave nucleation will likely occur
and bistability will not be observed, as the system will
evolve towards the active branch. Now, in the regime ra <
r < rb the deterministic mean-field equations evolve towards
a multitude of possible steady states. In this phase we find
that active fronts are pinned, so that different steady states
can be reached depending on the initial configuration of active
sites. Now, in the presence of noise we find that the system
evolves towards a smaller set of steady states [Fig. 9(b)].
This is because noise fluctuations can destabilize a subset
of the steady states that are reached by the deterministic
evolution. A pertinent analogy to this behavior is found in the
theory of spin glasses where a disordered system possesses
a rugged energy landscape with a large number of energy
minima [23]. There, fluctuations due to temperature can
induce transitions between local minima, and the long-time
behavior of the system is governed by the slow dynamics
of stochastic escape between these local minima. However,
this dynamics is exceedingly slow since the mean time to
escape can be exponentially long. In this case the system is
said to exhibit “glassy” behavior since the system ages over
a long time scale, and steady state may not be reached in
a tractable simulation time. In effect, the presence of noise
should drive the system to a unique steady state, but this will
likely take an exceedingly long time. Finally, for r < ra a
wide range of initial conditions evolve to the same quiescent
state with Pi ∼ 0. In this regime there is effectively only one
distinct steady state and noise does not change the system
behavior.

Our mean-field analysis provides a precise picture of the
sites of wave nucleation. In the case when λ1 > 0 wave
nucleation is deterministic and the sites of nucleation tend to
occur at the regions where �φ1 is localized. However, in the case
where the quiescent state is stable (λ1 < 0) we find that the
leading eigenvector is still predictive of the sites of nucleation.
In fact, our numerical analysis showed that as r is decreased
towards the propagation threshold, the correlation between
the leading eigenvector and the sites of wave nucleation
increases. This result can be explained from the fact that small
fluctuations around the quiescent state evolve according to
Eq. (10). Thus, fluctuations which occur at regions where �φ1
is localized will decay exponentially at the rate λ1, which is
the slowest decay rate in the system. In effect, the leading
eigenvectors identify preferred regions in the cell where noise
fluctuations are most likely to initiate a propagating Ca wave.
These results reveal that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the connectivity matrix play a crucial role in the nucleation
dynamics of the system.

Experimental studies have shown that Ca waves can
nucleate at specific sites in the cell. In particular, Marchant
and Parker [17] imaged Ca waves in the Xenopus oocyte and
analyzed the source of wave nucleation. Indeed, they found
that Ca waves were nucleated at regions of higher release site
density. Also, these sites had a higher than average frequency

of spontaneous firing indicating a higher excitability. Thus,
these experiments reveal that both density and excitability play
a crucial role in determining those regions in the cell which are
more likely to initiate a Ca wave. Our model analysis predicts
that these sites of wave nucleation correspond to the region
at which the leading eigenvector is localized. Indeed, we find
numerically that the leading eigenvector �φ1 tends to localize
in regions of higher density. Furthermore, we have explored
the role of a heterogeneous distribution of excitabilities (gi),
and find that indeed �φ1 will tend to localize in regions of
high excitability. However, we have not explored in detail the
competition between density and excitability in determining
the sites of localization. Interestingly, Marchant and Parker
also found that the ability of specific sites to nucleate waves
was more prominent when the interval between Ca waves was
longer. This result is consistent with our main finding that the
leading eigenvector becomes more predictive of the nucleation
sites as the system excitability is reduced. Hence, these
experiments confirm our finding that the spatial arrangement of
release sites becomes more prominent at reduced excitability.

An important limitation of this study is that we have mod-
eled a Ca spark as a simple stochastic on-off process. However,
in a cardiac cell, excitation of a Ca spark depends on recovery
from inactivation of the RyR channel, or the replenishing of
the SR load following Ca release. These dynamical processes
introduce refractoriness to each site and will therefore play
a crucial role in the location and timing of Ca waves. For
example, experiments from Nivala et al. [15] have shown that
at high external Ca, Ca waves are nucleated periodically at
specific sites in the cell. However, when the external Ca is
decreased then waves tended to nucleate at random sites in the
cell. This result is in contrast to the findings of Marchant and
Parker who found that as the excitability is reduced then waves
tended to originate at specific sites in the cell. This difference
is likely due to the fact that the Ca waves observed in oocytes
have a period larger than 10 s, which is likely much larger than
the refractory period of release sites. Thus, in this case the ini-
tiation of Ca waves is independent of the recovery kinetics, and
nucleation sites are dictated by the excitability and arrange-
ment of release sites. On the other hand, Nivala et al. observed
repetitive waves with a period ∼1 s. In this case, it is likely that
recovery kinetics played a crucial role in determining the sites
of wave nucleation. In fact, it is likely that the sites of wave ini-
tiation occurred at those regions in which the recovery kinetics
was fastest. In the case that recovery kinetics is dictated by the
refilling of the SR network, then these sites likely correspond
to regions of the cell with a higher density of SR calcium
transport ATPase (SERCA) channels, which are responsible
for pumping Ca back into the SR. In this study we have not
considered the role of refractoriness, and therefore our analysis
applies only in the case when the refractory time is much less
than the average waiting time for a wave nucleation event. This
is likely the reason why our theoretical results are in excellent
agreement with the findings of Marchant and Parker, but not
those of Nivala et al. [15]. A more comprehensive analysis will
require the inclusion of recovery kinetics in order to extend the
model to the regime when the wave nucleation time is short.

A second limitation of our study is that we have not
explored the role of site-to-site heterogeneities. Experimental
observations [24] of Ca wave nucleation in astrocytes reveal

052715-12



ROLE OF CONNECTIVITY AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 92, 052715 (2015)

that Ca waves originate at repetitive sites which are strongly
correlated with regions of the cell with high protein expression,
and also with the presence of mitochondria. These results
suggest that heterogeneities within cells are substantial and
play a crucial role in determining nucleation sites. Also,
experimental studies have shown that the distribution of RyR
clusters in cardiac myocytes is broadly distributed [25]. This
result indicates that clusters with a much larger than average
number of channels could potentially drive the initiation of
SCR. To include heterogeneities it will be necessary to include
site disorder in our stochastic simulation and mean-field
theory. In this case we expect wave nucleation to still occur
at the localization sites of the leading eigenvector of Qij
[Eq. (8)]. These localization sites will be determined by both
the distribution of site disorder and the spatial arrangement of
release sites. Hence, while our simplified approach neglects
some key factors, it allows us to study the interplay between
fluctuations and geometry in the nucleation of Ca waves.
Further refinement of these ideas will be necessary to make
more direct contact with experiments.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this study we have introduced a simplified model of Ca
activity in a cardiac cell. Using this model we identify the
region in parameter space where the spatial arrangement of
CRUs dictates the sites of wave nucleation. In this regime
we show that wave nucleation occurs at localized regions
determined by the eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix.
These results serve as a starting point to understand the
interplay between fluctuations and geometry in the formation
of Ca waves.
