Abstract

Gap junctions are membrane channels that connect the
cytoplasm of adjacent cells allowing the cell-to-cell elec-
trical coupling necessary for action potential propagation.
Pathological conditions, such as malformations in connex-
ins, mutations affecting phosphorylation of regulatory sites
of connexins, alterations in gap junction organization, and
type and quantity of connexin expression, can impede the
normal electrical propagation. All these malfunctions can
produce a dispersion of repolarization, implicated in ven-
tricular arrhythmias. In fact, ventricular tachycardia and
spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia occurred in more than
twice as many connexin deficient hearts than wild-type
hearts.

We perform numerical simulations of a human ventric-
ular model in order to mimic some of these pathological
conditions. In particular, we consider a diminished Cx43
connexin expression, as well as altered connexin conduc-
tance dynamics, i.e., modified maximum and minimum
conductances gmax and gmin, half-inactivation voltage
V1/2 and decay kinetics. Physiologically these modifica-
tions can appear due to mutations or to different connexin
configurations, i.e., forming heteromeric channels. Under
these conditions we study the change in action potential
duration (APD) and CV-restitution properties. We observe
that, although CV diminishes with decreased connexin ex-
pression, the APD remains almost constant up to the point
of conduction block. Also, propagation differs for constant
or time-dependent voltage conductance, conduction block
occurring earlier for the former. While mutations result-
ing in a stronger dependence of the delay time produced
an appreciable change intercellular conductances, this ef-
fect was not so important when the mutations affected the
overall delay time. Thus, our results suggest that a correct
description of gap junctional conductance is of big impor-
tance for understanding action potential propagation un-
der pathological conditions.

1. Introduction

A proper heart contraction requires a sequential propa-
gation of the electrical stimulus from one cell to another

through the cardiac tissue. Gap junctions (GJ) are mem-
brane channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells
and allows the cell to cell current transfer. Each gap
junction channel contains specific proteins, named con-
nexins, distributed in two hexameric structures referred as
hemichannels or connexons, one from each neighboring
cell. Each connexon can be constituted by one type of
connexin (homomeric connexon) or more than one type of
connexin (heteromeric connexon). Furthermore, an inter-
cellular channel can be composed by two identical homo-
meric connexons (homotypic junction) or two connexons
of different heteromeric or homomeric composition (het-
erotypic junction) [1]. Characteristics and type of con-
nexon affects the electrical coupling between adjacents
cells and then the properties of Action Potential (AP) prop-
agation. As in most tissues and organs, multiple connexin
types with different expresion or combination are found in
the heart, depending on the specific animal and the spe-
cialized cardiomyocyte. In this way, three main connexins
are found in mammalian cardiac cells: connexin40 (Cx40),
connexin43 (Cx43) and connexin45 (Cx45), with different
amounts and combinations in different heart tissues. Cx43
is the far the most abundant in cardiomyocytes. Moreover,
the gap junctions of atria of most mammalians species con-
tain abundant connexin Cx40 coexpresed with Cx43. Con-
nexin45 (Cx45) is found in atrial and ventricular myocytes
but in less quantities [2].

In the last years a considerable atention has been cen-
tered in the role of the gap junctions and conexins in ar-
rhythmias. In fact mutations and alterations of gap junction
organization and connexin expression are related with hu-
man heart disease with arrhythmic tendency. In this sense
a reduction of expresion of Cx43 in ventricles has been ob-
served in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and other
chronic myocardial disease states. In failling hearts one of
the consequences of the observed downregulation of Cx43
expression is the conduction slowing [3]. Hypertrophic
and dilated cardiomyopathy produces a rearrangament of
connexin Cx43, normally located in intercalated disc and
with low density in lateral membranes, originating an het-
erogeneous connexin redistribution and down-regulation

expression resulting in conduction defects [4] . Mutations
that originate changes in phosphorylation of hemichannels
affect, not only to process of degradation, expression and
distribution of connexins, but also to the funcionality of
channels and the conductance of gap junctions [5]. Furthe-
more a mutation in a connexin protein is implicated in the
pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome [6] Conse-
quently, pathological remodeling of connexins contributes
to arrhythmogenic substrates and development of reentrant
arrhythmias.

In this work we use a simplified ventricular model to
analyze the effect of several pathological circustances in
order to mimic some of the above mentioned pathological
condictions. We observe the strong behaviour of connex-

ins, being necessary big changes to observe appreciable
reduction in velocity conductivity.

2. Model and approach

We use the simplified human model of Peñaranda et al
[7] to provide the action potential dynamics with the pa-
rameters corresponding to a human ventricular cardiomy-
ocyte. This model is applied to a cardiac fiber, where we
solve the discrete cable equation assuming that cardiomy-
ocytes are isopotential

where Vj and gj are, respectively, the voltage and conduc-
tance differences between the j-th cell and its neighbor.

Simulations have been performed using a simple Euler
forward algorithm with a time discretization dt = 0.01 ms.
Spatial discretization dx = 0.01 cm is used. Dynamics of
gap junctions are introduced following the model of Vo-
gel/Harris [8]/[9] in a way similar to the works of Lin and
Desplantez [10], [11]:

and conductance time constant τg = AτeBVj . Here
gj,max/gj,min are the maximum/minimun connexin con-
ductances and A, Aτ , B and V1/2 correspond to param-
eters fitted to experimental data from Lin and Desplantez
[10], [11].

We use the values of parameters obtained by these
authors for the different homomeric-homotypic and
homomeric-heterotypic channels as original parameters
(see Fig. 1). In the latter case we measure the conduction
delay between two cells presenting Cx43 and Cx45 con-
nexins. Changes in conductance dynamics are analyzed
to mimic malfunctions of gap-junctions. We analyze the
changes produced in restitution properties when expresion
of connexins is diminished and/or when conductivity of
channels is reduced, reproducing the effect of some muta-
tions.

3. Results

In Fig. 2 we show the effect of either an overall re-
duction of the conductance or a reduction of the maximal
conductance gj,max in a tissue with Cx43-Cx43 channels.

curves for either homomeric-heterotypic channels Cx45-
Cx43 (red) or Cx43-Cx45 (blue) for a) reference conduc-
tance and b) 20% of maximal conductance gj,max.

This results in an overall reduction of the conduction ve-
locity, according to the scaling CV ∼

√
g. The difference

from a continuum description is not observed until very
small velocities, corresponding to conductances of the or-
der of 1/50 times the standard value. This case has been
very well studied [12]. Interestingly, even for very low
conductances, the action potential resitution curves remain
unaltered.

A more interesting situation is the case of homomeric-
heterotypic channels. In this case the steady-state conduc-
tance is asymmetrical and the conduction delay time could
depend on the direction in which the channels are trans-
versed. We consider the case of Cx43-Cx45 gap junction
and in Fig. 3 plot the conduction delay vs diastolic interval
(DI) curves for propagation in either direction. For stan-
dard conditions the difference is negligible. This was to
be expected. At standard delay times of ∼ 0.15 ms be-
tween cells and for an upstroke of ∼ 3-5 ms duration and
∼ 100 mV amplitude, this corresponds to a difference of
2.5− 4 mV between contiguous cells. For those values of
Vj the conductance is always maximal. Lowering the max-
imal conductance (Fig. 3b) the conduction delays increase
and the asymmetry effect begins to be appreciable (for the
parameters in Fig. 3b, Vj ∼ 6− 10 mV).

We have investigated the effect of changing the time
constant τg , either its overall factor Aτ or its voltage
dependence B. The effect is very different. Starting

from a value of gj equal to that of the maximal conduc-
tance gj,max, the conductance decreases with time until it
reaches a steady value. Typically the time constant of gj
(10-100 s) is much larger than the duration of a stimula-
tion. This means that it cannot follow the changes in volt-
age polarity during an action potential and its changes dur-
ing an action potential are typically negligible. However,
due to the voltage dependence of the time constant, the
dynamics of the conductance is faster during the upstroke
than during the plateau phase. This means that, even if in
the time of an stimulation the conductance does not have
enough time to reach a low value, it can decrease as the
continued effect of many stimulations, since the conduc-
tance can hardly increase, due to the very slow time scales
at Vj ∼ 0. This is the effect observed in Fig. 4. While an
overall change of the conductance time scale τg does not
change the final value of the conductance and only how
fast it approaches it, a change in its voltage dependence
does indeed change the final average conductance. This
accentuates the difference already observed in Fig. 3 be-
tween the two directions of propagation. In fact, a feed-
back mechanism can be produced, in which a decrease in
conductance increases the conduction delays that in turn
increase the intercellular potential difference, resulting in
a further decrease of conductance. We have observed that
this can result in a branch of low conductance action po-
tentials.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

We have performed simulations considering discrete
connexions between cells and studied the effect of reduc-
ing the maximal conductance and the time scales for its
dynamics. Unless very low values of the conductance are
achieved, discrete effects are negligible for homotypic con-
nexins. A more interesting situation happens when het-
erotypic channels are considered. In this case, a reduc-
tion of the maximal conductance results in a difference
in conduction delays between two cells presenting Cx45
and Cx43 connexins, depending on the direction of prop-
agation. This effect is accentuated when the voltage de-
pendence of the conductance time scale is enhanced. This
may have proarrythmic effects in the atria or at the junction
of ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibres where a change
from Cx43 to Cx45 connexins has been observed [10],
[11].
