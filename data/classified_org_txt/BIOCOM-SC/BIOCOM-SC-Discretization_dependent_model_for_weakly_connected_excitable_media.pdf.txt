Pattern formation has been widely observed in extended chemical and biological processes. Al-
though the biochemical systems are highly heterogeneous, homogenized continuum approaches
formed by partial differential equations have been employed frequently. Such approaches are usu-
ally justified by the difference of scales between the heterogeneities and the characteristic spatial
size of the patterns. Under different conditions, for example under weak coupling, discrete models
are more adequate. However, discrete models may be less manageable, for instance, in terms of
numerical implementation and mesh generation, than the associated continuum models. Here we
study a model to approach discreteness which permits the computer implementation on general
unstructured meshes. The model is cast as a partial differential equation but with a parameter that
depends not only on heterogeneities sizes, as in the case of quasi-continuum models, but also on the
discretization mesh. Therefore, we refer to it as a discretization-dependent model. We validate the
approach in a generic excitable media that simulates three different phenomena: the propagation
of action membrane potential in cardiac tissue; in myelinated axons of neurons; and concentration
waves in chemical microemulsions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Chemical and biochemical reactions outside of the
thermodynamic equilibrium are highly nonlinear. In con-
tinuum media and in combination with diffusive trans-
port such nonlinear reactions can produce the formation
of spatio-temporal patterns [1]. A particular example
of pattern formation is traveling waves in excitable me-
dia [2]. Such dynamics has been extensively studied [3],
[4] due to its relation with important physiological pro-
cesses like heart beating [5] and stimulus propagation in
neuronal networks [6]. Excitable waves have been also
observed in diverse chemical systems like the Belousov-
Zhabotinsky reaction [7] and CO oxidation in catalytic
surfaces [8].

For the aforementioned models, homogenized contin-
uum approaches formed by partial differential equations
(PDEs) have been extensively employed. Homogeniza-
tion techniques allow continuum models to capture the
discrete and small scale details of the particular system
or phenomena in terms of reaction-diffusion equations:

∂tu
j = F j(uuu) +∇.(σ∇uj), (1)

where uuu is the vector of variables of interest, uj , and
σ is the homogenized or effective diffusion coefficient.
This is the case of cardiac tissue, formed by a discrete
grid of cardiac cells, the brain, formed by a complex
discrete network of neurons, and some chemical reac-
tions that takes place inside droplets that form a set of

weakly connected discrete microscopic reactors [9]. The
corresponding models of such discrete systems have been
transformed into homogenized continuum versions [10]
with effective parameters [11]. For instance, the differ-
ences among nonlinear reactions can be treated with a
mean-field approach and the heterogeneous diffusion can
be homogenized via the classical Bruggeman’s approxi-
mation of effective medium [12].

However, such homogenized continuum descriptions
may fail when characteristic lengths of patterns are small
and close to the scale of the details of the system. Un-
der such conditions a detailed and microscopic descrip-
tion is typically employed, usually based on heteroge-
neous partial differential equations. Another possibility
is the use of discrete models with effective parameters
mimicking the homogenization performed for continuum
models. Here, a discrete model refers to a discrete set of
equations,

du
j
i

dt
= F j(uuui) +

∑
k

Gj(u

k), (2)

where i identifies one specific discrete component of the
system (e.g. a cell or a droplet), uuu is the vector of vari-
ables of interest, uj , and the summation over k high-
lights that the components are not independent from
each other. In the simple case of 1D model this summa-
tion may involve only first neighbors (to represent, for
instance, the discrete Laplacian operator). Nevertheless,
it is possible to use complex networks in this summation
term [6, 13]. In summary, the continuum space is re-
placed by a discrete set of components whereas time is
still continuous, leading us to a system of coupled ordi-
nary differential equations.



2

For instance, for the case of action potential propaga-
tion on cardiac tissue, different microscopic models based
on heterogeneous PDEs [14–18] and on discrete models
[18–20] were proposed to investigate important aspects
of cardiac diseases.

Unfortunately, both alternatives pose non-trivial com-
putational challenges. The multi-scale nature of com-
plex phenomena leads to a large number of equations
when microscopic or heterogeneous continuum models
are adopted. On the other hand, discrete models de-
mand precise representation and location of each individ-
ual component of the system, a property that challenges
mesh generation. Ideally, we would like to have a model
that: 1) captures the complex features of the phenomena,
i.e. behave as well as the microscopic or discrete models;
2) is computationally less expensive than the microscopic
model; and 3) is able to use general unstructured meshes
as those routinely generated for the solution of PDEs.

We have recently proposed a new model [21] that, for
the particular case of slow propagation on cardiac tis-
sue, was able to fulfill all the above requirements. This
model can be seen as an extension of the works on quasi-
continuum models [22–25] that propose partial differen-
tial equations (PDEs) that approach discreteness. Such
quasi-continuum models take into account higher order
terms for the diffusion operator together with the charac-
teristic length of the system to approach, in a continuum
way, the underlying discrete nature of the problem, see
[26] for a review. It is worth noting that similar models
were also proposed recently in the field of phase transi-
tions [27] and in structural mechanics [28, 29].

Classical homogenization techniques and quasi-
continuum models generate PDEs by upscaling some in-
formation of the microscopic/discrete structure of the
system, L. This information is usually embedded in some
coefficients of the generated PDEs. For instance, the
coefficient σ in eq.(1) would depend on the microscopic
features: σ(L). The main idea of our model is to use
also some information of the mesh or discretization, M.
Therefore, the coefficients of the PDEs depend on both
L and M, e.g., we would have σ(L,M) in eq.(1). Thus,
we call our new model a Discretization Dependent Model
(DDM ).

In this work, we continue previous investigations [21]
of DDM by evaluating its performance for the descrip-
tion of three different excitable media, cardiac tissue with
reduced conductivity, slow impulse conduction in myeli-
nated axons, and chemical reaction inside small droplets
surrounded by oil. We chose these phenomena since
each one of them presents very distinct scales of spatio-
temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we show that our new
proposed DDM model can behave as a quasi-continuum
model, when the discretization size of the mesh goes to
zero, and as a pure discrete model, when the mesh M
matches the topology of the discrete system, L.

Our results suggest that our new DDM, for all the three
problems, outperforms both the classical homogenized
continuum model as well the quasi-continuum models. In

addition, its performance is similar to the discrete model,
but with the advantage of its flexibility in terms of nu-
merical mesh that does not need to precisely match the
topology of the discrete system.

II. MODELS

We consider here a set of two reaction-diffusion equa-
tions with reaction terms described by the modified
Fitzhugh-Nagumo model [30]. Therefore, we take eq.(1)
for two components, j = 2, to obtain the next system of
equations:

∂tu = f(u, v) + ∂x(σ∂xu), (3)

∂tv = g(u, v) + δ∂x(σ∂xv), (4)

where the variables u and v may correspond to chemical
concentrations or action membrane potential depending
on the particular application, and f and g are, in general,
non-linear functions. Here we consider:

f(u, v) = k [u(1− u)(u− a)− uv] , (5)
g(u, v) = k [ε(bu− v)] . (6)

The model is based on the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model
[31, 32] where the term −uv prevents negative values of
the variable u. It is a generic model of excitable medium
and after a proper initial condition it produces the for-
mation of traveling excitation waves in a 1D system, see
fig.1, or spiral and scroll waves in higher dimensions.
The corresponding boundary conditions and initials val-
ues are:

∂xu(x, t) = ∂xv(x, t) = 0, ∀x ∈ ∂Ω,
u(x, 0) = u0, v(x, 0) = v0 x ∈ Ω0 ⊂ Ω.

Next we show different mathematical models that can
be used to describe an heterogeneous reaction-diffusion
system, going from a detailed description to homogenized
approximations of the system.

A. Previous models

First, we perform a systematic study of the different
models employed during the last years in the modeling of
heterogeneous reaction-diffusion systems. Below, in Fig.2
there is comparison among all the approaches under two
different conditions.

1. Heterogeneous multi-scale model

The most exact description corresponds to the hetero-
geneous general case which is given by the next set of
reaction-diffusion equations for two generic variables u
and v with spatially dependent coefficients:

X (x)∂tu = θ(x)f(u, v) + ∂x(σ(x)∂xu), (7)
X (x)∂tv = θ(x)g(u, v) + δ∂x(σ(x)∂xv). (8)

σ(x) is the spatially-dependent conductivity or diffusion
coefficient. Function θ(x) identifies the spatial location
where the reactions appear, see more details below in
Section IV. Function X (x) depends on the particular
case considered, see Table I. Parameter δ is the ratio of
diffusion coefficients for u and v.

We named this model Heterogeneous Multi-scale
Model (HMM), and although it is the best approach to
the real case, it is rarely used, because of its high com-
putational costs.

For the excitable dynamics induced by eqs.(5,6), a
wave propagates through an one dimensional system. See
two examples in Fig.2 for two different values of conduc-
tivities. For both cases we have X = θ = 1 and δ = 0.
The reaction terms are given by eqs.(3-6). The conduc-
tivity σ(x) is periodic on space with a high value of σ0
for the length l0 = 100µm that alternates to a low value
of σ1 for the length l1 = 0.5µm. For normal conduction
we use σ0 = 1.035×10−3 and σ1 = 1.035×10−5µm2/ms;
for weak conduction we decrease the second parameter,
σ1 = 2.96× 10−7µm2/ms.

2. Homogenized continuum model

If the spatial changes in the functions σ(x), θ(x) and
X (x) are smaller than any characteristic length of the
obtained spatial patterns, the HMM can be reduced to a
homogenized Continuum Model (CM). These functions
are averaged to particular homogeneous values σ̄, θ̄, X̄
by upscaling some important information, L, from the
detailed heterogeneous system to arrive at:

X̄∂tu = θ̄f(u, v) + σ̄∂2xu, (9)
X̄∂tv = θ̄g(u, v) + δσ̄∂2xv. (10)

which forms a set of homogeneous partial differential
equations.

In Fig. 2 for the Homogenized Model all the param-
eters are the same as those used for the HMM. The
homogenized conductivity is calculated by σ̄ = (`0 +
`1)/(`0/σ0 + `1/σ1).

In Fig.2(A,B) we can observe that under normal con-
ditions, the CM approximates well the dynamics of the
HMM. However, for weak conduction, the CM fails to
reproduce the slow dynamics (see Fig.2(C-D)).

3. Homogenized discrete model

When the continuum approach fails, an alternative is
to use a homogenized Discrete Model (DM) with a char-
acteristic length ` that comes from the underlying in-
homogeneity of the system, i.e., it also comes from L,
mimicking, for example, the length of a single cell.

The dynamics of a single element of such discrete sys-
tem follows the same non-linear reactions and the inter-
action with the two first neighbors is given by the discrete
Laplacian ∂2` :

X̄∂tui = θ̄f(ui, vi) + σ̄∂2`ui, (11)
X̄∂tvi = θ̄g(ui, vi) + δσ̄∂2` vi, (12)

where ∂2`ui =
ui+1−2ui+ui−1

`2
, σ̄, X̄ , θ̄ are the same ho-

mogenized values of the functions σ(x), θ(x) and X (x)
as in eqs.(9,10).

The computational integration of these equations is
fast and its solutions approximate very well those of
the HMM, under both normal and weak conduction, as
shown in Fig.2. However, as mentioned before, the down-
side is that the length ` is fixed, and the model can not
be solved on a arbitrary mesh.

4. Quasi-continuum model

To overcome the above mentioned problem, continuum
models have been proposed in the past with the main
goal of approximating discreteness. These models take
into account the discrete nature of the phenomena, i.e.,
the characteristic length `, together with high order ap-
proximations, obtained for instance via Padé series [25].
Such continuum approximations are usually called quasi-
continuum models QCM [22–25]. Applying these tech-
niques to our equations would give us:

X̄∂tu = θ̄f(u, v) +
(

σ̄

1− κ1∂2x

)
∂2xu (13)

X̄∂tv = θ̄g(u, v) +
(

δσ̄

1− κ1∂2x

)
∂2xv, (14)

where κ1 =
`2

12
.

Fig.2 shows that QCM indeed outperforms CM and
keeps the desired feature of a classical PDE, i.e., can be
solved on any arbitrary mesh. Nevertheless, for the case
of weak coupling, the solution is still far from our gold
standard, the HMM.

conduction at t = 0.5 ms (A) and t = 1.1 ms (B); and weak conduction at t = 2.2 ms (C) and t = 8.3 ms (D). Both QCM,
CM and HMM were solved using a fine discretization. The parameter values employed in all simulations are: a = 0.2, b = 0.5,
k = 36.0, ε = 4.5 · 10−5, θ̄ = X̄ = 1, δ = 0. For the panels (A) (B), σ̄ = 6.9 × 10−4µm2/ms. For the panels (C), (D)
σ̄ = 5.6× 10−5µm2/ms.

B. Discretization-dependent homogenized model

Here, we present an alternative homogenized model
that tries to link the continuum and discrete approaches.
The main idea of our model is to use also some informa-
tion of the mesh or discretization, M. Here, we will use
the value of h, which is the spatial discretization used
by the numerical methods. Therefore, the coefficients of
the PDEs depend on both L and M, e.g., we have coef-
ficients of the PDE that depend on ` and h. Therefore,
we call our new model a Discretization Dependent Model
(DDM ).

To compute the discrete Laplacian at position x we
need the evaluations of u(x+ `) and u(x− `). However,
after a continuum model or classical PDE is discretized
we may have only access to u(x+ h) and u(x− h), if we
consider a homogeneous mesh with spatial discretization
equals to h. Therefore, to obtain an approximation of
the discrete Laplacian we look for an additive correction

term Q± that satisfies:

u(x± `) = Q± + u(x± h). (15)

We obtain the function Q+ by the comparing the Tay-
lor’s expansion of u(x+h) and u(x+ `), and equivalently
for the function Q−:

Q± = ±(`− h)∂u+
(
`2 − h2

)
∂2u±

(
`3 − h3

3!

)
∂3u

(16)

+

(
`4 − h4

4!

)
∂4u...

Knowing Q±, we can use eq.(15) and eq.(16) to rewrite
the discrete Laplacian:

∂2`u =
u(x+ h) +Q+ + u(x− h) +Q− − 2u(x)

`2
. (17)

Rearranging terms and truncating the series we have:

∂2`u ≈ ∂
2u+

(
`4 − h4

12`2

)
∂4u(x). (18)



5

Finally, we rewrite the series using Padé approximation
[21, 25] to obtain:

∂2`u ≈
∂2

1−
(
`4−h4
12`2

)
∂2
u. (19)

The reaction-diffusion equations casted as a
discretization-dependent model are:

X̄∂tu = θ̄f(u, v) +
(

σ̄

1− κ2∂2x

)
∂2xu (20)

X̄∂tv = θ̄g(u, v) +
(

δσ̄

1− κ2∂2x

)
∂2xv, (21)

with κ2 =
`4−h4
12`2

, where `2 is the length employed in the
DM and QCM, and h the mesh discretization.

The model DDM has some very important properties:

• DDM = QCM when h → 0. Taking h → 0,
eqs.(20,21) are simplified to those of the quasi-
continuum model QCM, since κ2 → κ1.

• DDM = CM when `, h → 0. From the above we
know that DDM = QCM when h→ 0. In addition,
when ` → 0 eqs.(13,14) are simplified to those of
the homogenized continuum model CM. This is ex-
pected, since by `→ 0 we mean the discrete nature
of the phenomena is not relevant and the classical
continuum hypothesis is valid.

• DDM = DM when h→ `. When the discretization
mesh coincides with the underlying discrete system
DDM equations correspond to those of the discrete
model DM.

Therefore, all the previous presented homogenized
models, CM, DM and QCM can be taken as particular
cases of the new Discretization Dependent Model, DDM.

For more details on the numerical discretization of the
models for both cases of uniform and non-uniform meshes
see Appendix A.

III. DISCRETE BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS

In the previous section we have presented five ap-
proaches to model heterogeneous reaction-diffusion sys-
tems. Next, we choose three representative biochemical
examples of heterogeneous reaction and diffusion to ap-
ply the different models.

We restrict our study to excitable systems composed
of two phases, each one with different values for the reac-
tion and diffusion coefficients. Each system alternates be-
tween an active region, A of length l0 (gray colored area),
and a passive one, P of length l1 (white colored area),
see Fig. 3. We study three biochemical systems with
different underlying structural organization: the prop-
agation of the action potential through cardiac tissue,

see Fig. 3(A), the propagation of the action potential
through myelinated axons of neurons, see Fig. 3(B), and
the Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction in aqueous
droplets surrounded by oil, see Fig. 3(C).

These phenomena are modeled by the same general
reaction-diffusion equations, as presented by the equa-
tions of the HMM model, eqs.(7,8). The space depen-
dent functions are defined as follows: when x ∈ A we
have θ = 1, X = X0 and σ = σ0; whereas when x ∈ P
we have θ = 0, X = X1 and σ = σ1. In addition, the
reaction terms are modeled by eqs.(5, 6):

X∂tu = θk(u(1− u)(u− a)− uv) + ∂x(σ∂xu), (22)
X∂tv = θk(�(bu− v)) + δ∂x(σ∂xv). (23)

All the parameters of the three biochemical models
were carefully adjusted to obtain the distinct and char-
acteristic wave propagation speeds and wave-lengths as
reported in the literature, see Table I. In particular, we
have chosen these three examples as they present very
different temporal and spatial scales. Fig. 4 presents
how the solutions depend on time and space for each of
the three models. The neuron action potential is the
fastest and the chemical reaction in droplets is the slow-
est system, see Fig. 4(A); in terms of spatial profile, the
cardiac action potential has the longest wave-length and
the chemical reaction in droplets the smallest one, see
Fig. 4(B).

For the homogenized models, CM, QCM and DDM,
the effective coefficients σ̄, θ̄, X̄ are computed as follows:
σ̄ = `

`0/σ0+`1/σ1
, θ̄ = `0/`, X̄ = `0/` for the neuron

case, for cardiac and chemical reaction was X̄ = 1, where
` = `0 + `1. The other parameters are presented in Table
I.

reaction front propagation in chemical active droplets and

correspond to active regions whereas white areas of length `1
and σ1 correspond to passive regions.

A. Tissue of cardiac cells

Membrane action potential in cardiac tissue propa-
gates among individual cardiac cells, i.e. myocytes, by
gap junctions. The propagation of the action potential is
much faster inside the individual cells than through the
gap junctions and therefore at this microscopic scale the
tissue is heterogeneous, where the conduction depends
on space σ(x) and the tissue combines the scale of the
myocytes `0 = 100 µm with the size of the gap junctions
`1 = 0.5 µm, see Fig.3 (A). Typically, under normal prop-
agation the continuum approach is employed giving very
good agreement with experimental data. However, under
different cardiac diseases, such as infarct and ischemia,

the effective conductivity of gap junctions decrease, σ1,
and can induce Conduction Block, and different types of
arrhythmia [33, 34].

In these conditions, for reduced gap junction conduc-
tivity the DM was shown to reproduce these features
better than the CM, see [3].

We employ the modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model, see
eqs.(22,23), where the field u corresponds to a renormal-
ized membrane action potential and v to a generic gate
variable. Here, θ = 1 in the myocyte, whereas in the gap
junctions we have only diffusion and θ = 0. See Table I
for the other parameters of the model.

B. Myelinated nerve axons

Membrane action potential propagates along the ax-
ons of the neurons [35]. The accumulation of myelin
along large regions of the axons induces a fast propa-
gation of the impulse between the Ranvier nodes, short
nodes where the electric impulse is intensified again [36],
see Fig.3(B).

Therefore, this system is heterogeneous and multi-
scale, intercalating short nodes of Ranvier (σ0, `0) and
long Myelin Sheath (σ1, `1) [3]. We employ the modified
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, see eqs.(22,23), where the field
u corresponds to a renormalized membrane action poten-
tial and v to a generic gate variable. Table I presents all
the parameters of this model.

The lost of the thickness of the myelin sheath re-
duces the speed of propagation and may induce Con-
duction Block [3] and disturb the action potential propa-
gation. Such alteration of the normal thickness of myelin
is known to be related with multiple sclerosis [37].

C. Chemical droplets in oil

The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is a classical chem-
ical example of excitable media [7]. Excitation pulses
and spiral waves fully develop in extended versions of
this chemical reaction [38] in aqueous conditions. By the
use of emulsions of water, oil and surfactant the activity
of the reaction can be confined in small reactors formed
by water droplets surrounded by a thin surfactant mem-
brane immersed in the oil phase, see Fig.3(C). The size
of the droplets can change from some nanometers [39]
to the scale of hundred of microns [40]. Although the
oil phase is passive and avoids any reaction, it permits
the diffusion of the non-polar particles. One can model
such excitable system by the use of activator-inhibitor
system where two concentrations diffuse, and therefore
we employ the same modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model,
see eqs.(22,23), with renormalized concentration in both
fields u and v, and with diffusion taking place in both
equations (δ = 1), see Table I.

IV. RESULTS

We consider excitable waves in one-dimensional media
under weak conductivity between consecutive elements.
We study, for the three systems, propagation failure, i.e.
conduction block, and the dependence of the total acti-
vation time on the distance to the location of the initial
stimulus. In addition, we measure the dependence of the
speed of the waves along the heterogeneous systems on
the parameter σ, i.e. the conductivity or diffusion, and
we evaluate the influence of the numerical discretization
h on the solutions for the different models. For all the
three cases we obtained similar results: the DM is a bet-
ter approach than the continuous model CM because it
reproduces better the results of the HMM. The DDM
produces also similar speed of the waves as compared to
the HMM, and is a good approach even for different val-
ues of the numerical discretization, h. The DDM repro-
duces a similar speed of the heterogeneous model until
the numerical scheme becomes unstable, which happens
for h > 1.8` as deduced before in [21].

A. Tissue of cardiac cells

The study of the speed of propagation of cardiac action
potential is presented in Fig.5. For different values of σ̄,
Fig.5(A) presents the propagation speed obtained by the
Heterogeneous Model HMM and the homogenized Con-
tinuous Model CM with a fine discretization of 0.5 µm;
and by the Discrete Model DM with `= 100.5 µm. While
the CM does not give rise to conduction block, both DM
and HMM produce conduction block for a similar value
of the parameter σ̄.

In Fig.5(B) we fix the discretization to 160 µm for the
homogenized CM, QCM and DDM when varying the
conductivity σ̄ and compare the results with those of the
HMM with fine discretization. While CM and QCM give
rise to waves with small velocities and premature artifi-
cial conduction block, the DDM shows better accuracy in
the calculation of the wave velocity and in the determina-
tion of the conductivity where conduction block occurs,
in this case at σ̄ = 4.2× 10−5 µm2/ms.

In Fig.5(C) we fix σ̄, which produces a speed of 10
cm/s with the model HMM, and compare the homoge-
nized CM, DDM and QCM models for different values

of discretization, h. For small discretization, h → 0, the
speed obtained with the CM is artificially high in com-
parison with the HMM model. However, the speed ob-
tained with the QCM tends to the one measured in the
DDM, which is relatively close to the speed of the HMM.
The CM and QCM models should not be used with a dis-
cretization larger than 120 µm, since the results suggest
a conduction block that does not occur for this values of
σ̄. The DDM model allows the use of larger values of dis-
cretization than the others, and only stops near 180 µm

due to numerical instabilities, denoted by a cross in the
figure. With a large range for h, between 10 µm and 160
µm, the DDM reproduces very well the velocity obtained
with the HMM. The numerical instability occurs because
we use a semi-implicit method, as previously described
in [21] and its supplementary material.

B. Myelinated nerve axon

The resulting speed of action potential propagation
along a myelinated axon of a neuron under different con-
ditions is shown in Fig.6. As mentioned before, both
temporal and spatial scales of this phenomenon are very
different from the previous one. Nevertheless, the perfor-
mance of each tested models is very similar.

For small conductivity, waves cannot propagate and
produce conduction block. This phenomenon is observed
in Fig.6(A) for the Heterogeneous Model HMM and the
homogenized DM. However, CM with fine discretization
(1 µm) does not reproduce the conduction block.

We compare also the HMM with the homogenized
CM, QCM and DDM when the conductivity σ̄ is var-
ied, keeping fix the discretization at 300 µm in Fig.6(B).
The DDM can reproduce with better accuracy than
CM and QCM the conduction block that occurs when
σ̄ = 3.8× 10−3.

In Fig.6(C) we compare the model HMM with the ho-
mogenized CM, QCM and DDM with σ̄ = 7.1 × 10−3,
corresponding to a speed of 628.8 cm/s. For small dis-
cretization, h → 0 the CM is far away from HMM,
whereas QCM and DDM converge to the same value
and relatively close to the speed obtained with the HMM.
The CM and QCM cannot be used with a discretization
larger than 250µm and 230 µm, respectively. The DDM
allows the use of larger discretization and stops near 380
µm due to numerical instability. Between 1 µm and 350
µm our DDM is very effective in reproducing the velocity
of the HMM.

C. Chemical droplets in oil

Diffusion coupled to the nonlinear chemical reactions
can produce the propagation of reaction fronts. The de-
pendence of the velocity on the different parameters is
shown in Fig.7.

For small diffusivity, chemical waves cannot propagate
and give rise to propagation block, see Fig.7(A), for the
Heterogeneous Model HMM and the homogenized DM.
However, CM with a fine discretization, h = 0.1 µm,
cannot reproduce the conduction block.

We compared also the HMM with the homogenized
CM, QCM and DDM when the conductivity σ̄ is varied,
keeping fix the discretization of 7.5µm in Fig.7(B). The
DDM can reproduce the conduction block that occurs at
σ̄ = 3.6×10−7 with better accuracy than CM and QCM.

In Fig.7(C) we compare the model HMM with the ho-
mogenized CM, QCM and DDM with σ̄ = 4.6 × 10−7,
which corresponds to a speed of 14.5 m/s. We vary the
discretization from 1 µm to 8 µm. For small discretiza-
tion, h → 0 the CM is far away from HMM, whereas
QCM and DDM converge to the same value that is rela-
tively close to the speed obtained by the HMM. The CM
and QCM cannot use discretizations larger than 5.5 µm
and 4.5 µm, respectively. The DDM allows larger values

D. Transitory dynamics

In the previous section the speed of the waves is calcu-
lated when the excitable wave takes a stationary shape
and moves with constant velocity. However, before the
wave adopts the final stationary shape, velocity and
thickness of the wave changes depending on the initial
condition. The local thickness of the excitable pulse,
corresponding to action potential duration (APD) for
cardiac cells and neurons and to excitation time for the
chemical reactions, depends on the distance to the source
where wave is initiated, see Fig.8 for two different exam-
ples in each of the three biochemical systems.

Here, we observe the main differences among the three
systems. While for normal conditions the action poten-
tial in the cardiac tissue rapidly relaxes to the stationary
shape and all the models reproduce constant APD in the
space, see Fig.8(A), the action potential in the axon con-
tinuously changes with the distance and the stationary
shape is still not achieved, see Fig.8(B). The chemical
droplets is an intermediate case where the transitory dy-
namics occurs along the first 0.03 cm, see Fig.8(C).

The behavior of the chemical systems does not depend
on the diffusivity σ, compare panel (C) and (F) in Fig.8.
In both cases, Excitation durations (ED) are not cor-
rectly computed with the CM, whereas ED distributions
obtained with DM and DDM are close to those of the
HMM. In the other two cases, the change with the de-
crease of conductivity is more relevant. In the CM, ED

distribution does not change substantially with the mod-
ification of the conductivity. However, with the DM and
DDM the distribution changes and follows closely the
one computed with the HMM.

V. DISCUSSION

We have presented a discretization dependent model
for the integration of discrete biochemical systems which
merges good properties of a discrete model (e.g. veloc-
ity dependence on conductivity, conduction block, depen-
dence on the distance to the initial condition) with the
applicability and cost of a homogenized continuum model
(e.g. integration on unstructured meshes, analytic calcu-
lations).

As a final test of our argument we constructed an one-
dimensional mesh with random discretization, where we
can integrate the continuum, quasi-continuum and our
discretization dependent model and compare them with
the standard heterogeneous HMM model, see Fig.9. It
is interesting to point out that the discrete model can
not be solved on this unstructured mesh, as it requires
the exact topology of the underlying discrete system.
Using this non-uniform mesh the speed obtained with
the DDM and the corresponding conduction block are in
good agreement with the results obtained by the HMM,
see Fig.9(A). In summary, DDM outperforms the clas-
sical continuum model, CM, the Quasi-continuum ap-
proaches to discreteness, QCM, and it is computationally

much cheaper than the heterogeneous model, HMM. As
a matter of fact, DDM was shown to be computationally
cheaper than any other tested model in this work, includ-
ing the DM, as it can be integrated with discretization
values larger than those used by other models, see for
instance Fig.5C.

It is interesting to note that both DDM and QCM
models mainly propose modifications on the diffusion
term. This is similar to the modifications proposed in
[41] to deal with cases of anomalous diffusion. Other
techniques that have also been extensively used are non-
local diffusion [42] and fractional diffusion. The DM
can be written as a non-local diffusion model. By tak-
ing two delta Dirac functions as the Kernel function of
the integro-differential equation, we arrive at the discrete
Laplacian in one-dimension. Therefore, our new model
DDM can also be seen as a modified non-local diffu-
sion model. Non-local and fractional diffusion models
can be equivalent, see [43]. Recently, fractional reaction-
diffusion equations were used to model cardiac tissue [44]
where all the information of the micro-structure of the
tissue was projected to the fractional diffusion [45]. In

particular, similar APD distributions studied here, see
Fig. 8, can be found in [44]. Therefore, in the near
future we will compare our new DDM model to these
other approaches: non-local, anomalous and fractional
diffusion models. In this direction, our method can be
also extended to more elaborated non-local couplings, to
study the spread of pathological pulses in the brain [46].

For small discretization, the discretization-dependent
model gives rise to a quasi-continuum model defined
as a continuum approach to discreteness [23–25]. In
turn, quasi-continuum models give rise to classical
continuum model, when the inhomogeneity length `
can be neglected. Also, in the adequate limit, the
discretization-dependent model reproduces the complete
discrete model, which sometimes is a better description
than continuum models. Therefore, all the previous pre-
sented homogenized models, CM, DM and QCM can be
taken as particular cases of the new Discretization De-
pendent Model, DDM.

We have compared the HMM with the homogenized
versions of the continuous and discrete models. It is
known that the homogenized versions of the continuous
[11] and the discrete [10] models are good approaches to
HMM only for certain values of the parameters. If one of
the conductivities is too small and the fraction close to
the percolation limit, homogenization fails [11, 40]. Un-
der such conditions the excitation waves can break into
pieces and produces irregular dynamics [17, 47, 48]. It
may be interesting to extend the analysis here presented
to two dimensional systems and compare the resulting
dynamics.

Excitable waves can propagate in more complex
topologies like networks [13, 49, 50] where all the con-
tinuous models probably fail, and discrete models with
complex interactions has to be consider. However, there
are simpler networks like trees and some random net-
works where propagation failure has been also observed,
where the DDM may be also applied [51]. In addition,
our model may be applied to study discrete breather, i.e.
temporally periodic and strongly localized in space non-
linear structures, where the QCM was also applied with
not completely satisfactory results [52, 53].

Finally, we would like to note that the proposed
discretization-dependent models are not restricted to
pattern formation in excitable media. They are rather
general and can be used for other reaction-diffusion sys-
tems. There are multiple examples of patten formation in
biology that are in the border of continuum and discrete
descriptions, like the Turing mechanism [54], cell-to-cell
communications [55] as well as other biological contexts
at different spatial scales [56].

FIG. 10. Scheme of a uniform mesh A) with discretization h,
and a non-uniform mesh B) with discretization hi .

Appendix A: Discretization of Models on Uniform
and Non-uniform Meshes

Here, we present the numerical schemes for the mod-
els for the cases of uniform and non-uniform meshes. We
use operator splitting to separate the non-linear part that
comes from the reactions and the linear term that comes
from diffusion. More details of this scheme can be found
in [21]. Here we focus on the discretization of the diffu-
sion terms. For the classical CM and HMM models we
have:

∂tu = ∂ (σ(x)∂u) . (A1)

Here, σ(x) varies on space either because we have
the HMM case or due to changes on the homoge-
nized coefficient that may reflect non-periodic or non-
regular information of the microscopic/discrete struc-
ture of the system, L. For example, cells may have
different sizes and droplets alignment may be not reg-
ular so that the discrete characteristics may vary with
space and the homogenized coefficient would reflect it:

σ(x) =
`(x)

`0(x)/σ0(x)+`1(x)/σ1(x)
.

We assume also that our discretization may be non-
uniform, i.e, h varies. We can represent this either using
a continuum approach, h(x), or equivalently saying that
our domain is discretized on N volumes or elements, each
with a size of hi, with i ∈ {1, · · · , N}. Fig. 10 presents
examples of uniform and non-uniform meshes. By using
the classical Finite Volume method to discretize space we
have:

∂tui =
2

hi

[
σi+1/2

(
ui+1 − ui
hi+1 + hi

)
− σi−1/2

(
ui − ui−1
hi + hi−1

)]
,

(A2)
where ui = u(xi, t), with xi the coordinate of the center
of the volume i as shown in Fig. 10.

In order to simplify the notation we define Tσi±1:

Tσi±1 =
2σiσi±1

hi(hiσi±1 + hi±1σi)
, (A3)

where we have imposed the continuity of fluxes on faces

i+ 1/2 and i− 1/2 to arrive at this generalization of the
harmonic mean.

Rewriting eq.(A2) we have:

∂tui =
[
Tσi+1 (ui+1 − ui)− T

σ
i−1 (ui − ui−1)

]
. (A4)

To obtain a numerical solution we discretize time using
Backward Euler. This generates a tridiagonal matrix
that needs to be solved for each time step of the sim-
ulation.

For the special case of uniform mesh and constant σ
we find the classical second order approximation in space
for the diffusion equation: ∂tui = σ

ui+1−2ui+ui−1
h2

. This
is the discretization used to solve the homogeneous CM
on an uniform mesh or DM, replacing h by `.

For a general non-uniform mesh, we cast DDM basic
equation as:

∂tu =

(
1

1− κ2∂2

)
∂ (σ(x)∂u) . (A5)

Discretizing the numerator of the right hand side as be-
fore, and moving the denominator to the left hand side
we have:

∂tui−κ2i∂2(∂tui) =
[
Tσi+1 (ui+1 − ui)− T

σ
i−1 (ui − ui−1)

]
,

(A6)
where κ2i = (`

4
i − h

4
i )/12`

2
i . Here, not only the mesh

is non-uniform (hi), the discrete characteristics of the
system may also vary with space, `(x), with discretization
also given by `i.

Using the same spatial discretizaton on the left hand
side we obtain:

∂tui −
[
Tκ2i+1 (∂tui+1 − ∂tui)− T

κ2
i−1 (∂tui − ∂tui−1)

]
=
[
Tσi+1 (ui+1 − ui)− T

σ
i−1 (ui − ui−1)

]
, (A7)

where

Tκ2i±1 =
2κ2i

hi(hi + hi±1)
. (A8)

Finally, using Backward Euler for the time discretiza-
tion we arrive at the following linear system that needs
to be solved at each time step k:

the case of a uniform discretization of time, k. The nu-
merical scheme (A9) is used to integrate the models DDM

and QCM. For QCM we replace κ2 by κ1. Note that
eq.(A9) also generates a tridiagonal matrix that needs to
be solved for each time step of the simulation. Therefore,

the computational cost of the different models, DDM,
QCM, DM and CM, is the same and is mainly affected
by the spatial discretization used, h.
