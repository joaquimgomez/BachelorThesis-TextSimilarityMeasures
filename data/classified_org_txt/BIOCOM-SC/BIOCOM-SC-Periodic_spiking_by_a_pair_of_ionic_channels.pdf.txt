Abstract

Neuronal cells present periodic trains of localized voltage spikes involving a large amount of different ionic channels. A
relevant question is whether this is a cooperative effect or it could also be an intrinsic property of individual channels.
Here we use a Langevin formulation for the stochastic dynamics of a pair of Na and K ionic channels. These two channels
are simple gated pore models where a minimum set of degrees of freedom follow standard statistical physics. The whole
system is totally autonomous without any external energy input, except for the chemical energy of the different ionic
concentrations across the membrane. As a result it is shown that a unique pair of different ionic channels can sustain
membrane potential periodic spikes. The spikes are due to the interaction between the membrane potential, the ionic
flows and the dynamics of the internal parts (gates) of each channel structures. The spike involves a series of dynamical
steps being the more relevant one the leak of Na ions. Missing spike events are caused by the altered functioning of
specific model parts. The time dependent spike structure is comparable with experimental data.

1. Introduction

Neurons exhibit a great variety of firing electrical pat-
terns. It is recognized that the neuronal electrical activity
depends, besides from the synaptic inputs, on its electro-
physiological membrane properties of the specific type of
neuron [1, 2]. These membrane properties ultimately de-
pends on physical processes, such as the movement of ions
through the molecular channels, the membrane potential
dynamics, and the gating dynamics of the channels. These
processes are indeed complex, involving a large hierarchy
of biomolecular structures from the atomic to the cellular
and multicellular scales.
However, from the point of view of physical modeling,

it is interesting to explain these processes by using a re-
duced formulation, with only a minimum of relevant phys-
ical mechanisms and variables. One could then address
for instance the question of whether the observed firing
behavior could appear in a very simple device or it is in-
stead necessary a large biological complexity or a whole
collectivity of channels [2, 3]. Also, due the the large va-
riety and complexity of real neural outputs, it is funda-
mental the recognition of the different fundamental firing

patterns. Then one could in principle try to reproduce
the most basic response patterns by using only the neces-
sary ingredients in a unified framework, and to study the
changes of these basic patterns when varying the physical
parameters. Once this aim is achieved, it is open the pos-
sibility of introducing more elements in order to reproduce
more complex patterns. This objective implies the choice
of a simple theoretical scenario as starting approach.

Most theoretical approaches for action potential dynam-
ics are based on the classic Hodking-Huxley [4, 5] frame-
work. It originally consists of deterministic equations for
the dynamics of membrane permeability. At the level of
individual channels other computational approaches con-
sider microscopic details at the atomic scale by means of
molecular dynamics simulations [6]. Also mechanical mod-
els for the gating dynamics for a K channel have been
proposed [7]. In the last years there has been an increas-
ing interest on the role of channel noise in neural firing
patterns [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Fluctuations have usu-
ally been modeled by using either master equations for the
gate states [15, 16], or by including stochastic terms into
the membrane conductivities [17]. Also the diffusion of
ions inside the channel has been considered [18, 19].

Recently, a semi-microscopic approach for the stochastic
dynamics of individual molecular channels was formulated
[20, 21]. This approach uses only some relevant physical

mechanisms acting on a minimum model. Variables repre-
senting the relevant degrees of freedom (ion positions and
gate states) interact through a single energy functional,
and a Langevin dynamics is then constructed by follow-
ing standard rules from statistical physics. It is worth to
remark the physical consistency of the resulting formula-
tion. On the one hand the magnitude of the fluctuations
verifies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. On the other
hand the working of the channel is autonomous, with the
energy source being the chemical energy from the differ-
ent ionic concentrations inside and outside the cell. The
resulting model was able to reproduce the basic properties
of Na and K channels [21] and the excitable properties of
a single Na channel in the presence of K leak [20].
Here we will show how this approach, applied to a

unique pair of channels following known physical mech-
anisms acting on the membrane, is able to generate a pe-
riodic firing pattern of electrical activity. We will find
the effects of the external control parameters, and answer
questions on how to control the stability of the periodicity
or where are the sources of misfunctioning.

respective gates Y1, Y2, Y3, ionic concentrations [Na

fluxes (arrows), and membrane potential ∆V .

The structure of this paper is as follows. In the next
section we will show how a couple of gating pores, model-
ing Na and K channels, exhibit periodic firing with a well
controlled period. Next we will study the changes in the re-
sponse pattern by changes of different channel parameters
and external conditions. We end with some conclusions.
Some specific details of the approach are presented in the
Appendix.

2. The periodic spiking minimum device

We have employed a minimum device consisting of a
couple formed by two channel models, as a rude simplifi-
cation of Na and K voltage-gated ionic channels, as pic-
tured in Fig. 1. Each model is a simple physical pore with

active gates controlled by the membrane potential. The
Na-like channel has two gates, whereas the K-like chan-
nel has a single gate. This physical structure has been
designed [20, 21] to follow experimental observations on
individual Na and K channels (see for instance Chapter 4
in Ref. [2]).

The physical variables of the model are the ion positions
xi, the gate coordinates Yj , and the membrane potential
∆V . The Yi are bistable variables such that the value 0/1
corresponds to the corresponding gate being closed/open.
Gates Y1, Y2 of the Na channel are activating and deacti-
vating (i.e. open and close with membrane depolarization)
respectively. According to experimental evidence, they are
mediated by different parts of the channel structure [2, 22].
Gate Y3 of the K gate is activating. These gates (Y1, Y2,
Y3) can be related to the activating (m(∆V ), n(∆V )) and
deactivating (h(∆V )) functions appearing in the H–H for-
mulation [4, 5].

We have considered a single degree of freedom (Y vari-
able) for each gate. Generalization to more Y variables
to account for the existence of several voltage-sensing do-
mains in real channels is straightforward, but it has not
been considered here in order to keep the formulation of
the model to a minimum. The control parameters are
the out cell ionic concentrations with fixed intra cell con-
centrations. Thus we implicitly neglect changes in bulk
concentrations originated by the small local flow from the
pair of channels.

The model is defined by an energy functional U describ-
ing the interaction between the different physical variables.
The explicit construction of this functional is described in
the Appendix. Following basic statistical physics the vari-
ables xi, Yj follow a brownian stochastic dynamics [20]:

γxẋi = −∂xiU(xi, Yj ,∆V ) + ξi(t), (1)

γYj Ẏj = −∂YjU(xi, Yj ,∆V ) + ξYj (t), (2)

where thermal noises fulfill

〈ξa(t)ξb(t
′)〉 = 2γa kBT δa,b δ(t− t

′), (3)

and γa are the corresponding frictions. Note that by con-
struction the model verifies fluctuation-dissipation theo-
rem. An analogous formulation for the coupling between
ion and channel state, consistent with statistical physics,
was already used in Ref. [18] to describe the stochastic
behavior of singly occupied ion channels.

The numerical simulation of these equations, by a first
order algorithm, allows to record the state of the gates
and the position of the ions. The ionic concentrations in
the bulk are implemented as boundary conditions at both
ends of the channel for the Langevin dynamics of ions [23].
Finally, the dynamics of the membrane potential follows
the classical capacitor equation

where CM is the membrane capacity assumed to be con-
stant and the r.h.s term includes all the ionic fluxes either
across the channel or membrane leaks.
Letting the system evolve according the dynamical equa-

tions, without any external perturbation, we observe that
the membrane potential present periodic pulses or spikes.
We show a temporal evolution of this quantity in Fig. 2,
which is very similar to those presented in some experi-
ments, as it is seen for instance in Chapter 17 in Ref. [2].
The working of the system during a few spikes, in this

range of parameters, can be seen in Figs. 3, 4, where the
evolution of the three gate variables and the membrane
potential are shown.

steps are also specified in boldface.

These figures reveal that any successful pulse involves
three different regimes : stand-by, the spike event and the
refractory state. These physical regimens are composed
of steps (Table 1): stand-by from the membrane at the
K-Nernst potential which corresponds to the dynamical
depolarizing (step a), the spike (steps b and c) and the
restoring of the K-Nernst potential (step d). Being more
explicit the description of each step is:
a).- This is the main dynamical process to trigger the

pulse and to control the spike period. This step has the
largest time span where the Na gate Y1 is closed and the

Figure 7: Time evolution of the membrane potential between two
consecutive pulses for four values of the Y1 barrier height considered
in Table 2. Times are shifted in order to place the first pulse of each
case at t = 0 and in this way to highlight the corresponding period.
The results illustrate how the period increases with barrier height.
Black line: Vd(Y 1) = 8 kBT, red line: Vd(Y 1) = 9 kBT, blue line
Vd(Y 1) = 9.85 kBT, and green line: Vd(Y 1) = 10 kBT.

Y2 gate is open. The K gate Y3 is just closed and the mem-
brane potential is the K Nernst value ∆V ∼ −92 mV (See
Fig. 3 at t = 34ms). Now the Y1 gate, although closed,
has nevertheless a small leak of Na ions. In Fig. 3 we see
how this leak increases the action potential depolarizing
the membrane. An analogous phase, the so called pace-
maker depolarization, is found in Na channels of Purkinje
cells [2].

b) and c).- The pulse. This regime is the shortest time
interval, which is magnified in Fig. 4. The Na leak increas-
ing ∆V triggers the sequence of events in the Na channel
that originates first the opening of gate Y1, which permits
a larger flux of Na ions, depolarizing the membrane by
increasing ∆V even further forming the pulse (b). Very
quickly the gate Y3 of the K channel also opens and gate
Y2 of the Na channel closes. Then the flux of K ions to-
wards the exterior of cell leads the membrane potential to
reset its polarization, leading to more negative values of
∆V (c).

d).- Na gate Y2 closes and the membrane potential re-
laxes towards the K-Nernst potential because during all
this step the Na channel is closed and the K channel is
open. In this regime the Na channel presents three dif-
ferent configurations of closed channel. d1: Y1 open and
Y2 closed, d2: with Y1 and Y2 both closed, and d3 with Y1
closed and Y2 open. Then the Na channel rests in stand-by
regime, until the K gate Y3 closes and the depolarization
starts a new cycle.

In this dynamics some cycles are observed to be missing
because of the inherent stochasticity of the gate dynam-
ics. In the first example the Na door Y2 closes before the
completion of the depolarization of the action potential.
This misses a possible spike at t = 803 ms (Fig. 5). In the
second example the K door Y3 opens reducing the mem-
brane potential without a pulse at t = 962 ms (Fig. 6).
The system goes back to the state d3. These two cases of

missed spikes disturb the regularity of the train of spikes,
increasing the mean and the variance of the period. All
these steps are summarized in Table 1.

3. Effect of the Na ions leak

The pulse of the action potential is produced by the syn-
chronized opening and closing of gates of the Na channel,
and it is completely similar to the process described for
the model of excitable membrane of Ref. [20]. The period-
icity of the oscillatory behavior is controlled by the slow
leak of the Na ions when both channels are closed, which
introduces its time scale into the process. This slow leak
could be produced by other processes or channels in more
complex devices. In our case the period of the oscillations
should directly be related to the rate at which ions can
cross the potential barrier of the closed gate Y1. As it is
well known the time scale for crossing a barrier is given
by the Arrhenius (or Kramers) law, according to which
T ∼ expVd/kBT for Vd ≫ kBT , where Vd is the height
of the barrier (in this case that of the Y1 gate). To test
this prediction we have performed simulations with differ-
ent values of Vd(Y1). Results of mean periods, measured
as the time intervals between membrane potential peaks,
are presented in Table 2.

Vd(Y1) (kBT ) 8 9 9.85 10
Number of oscillations 501 274 115 94
Mean period 〈T 〉 (ms) 4.03 7.33 17.3 20.9
Std dev. σT (ms) 2.77 3.33 7.2 10.2

Table 2: Oscillation periods for different Y1 barrier heights, calcu-
lated for a simulation time span of 2025 ms.

Note that according to the Kramers’ law, by increas-
ing the barrier height in 1 kBT the crossing time should
increase in a factor e = 2.718... for Vd ≫ kBT . Ac-
cording the results in Table 2: T9kBT/T8kBT = 1.8,
T10kBT/T9kBT = 2.8. While the order of magnitude is
correct, the result is better for the larger barrier case as
expected. In Fig. 7 four examples with different periods
are plotted.

4. Effect of external cell concentrations

For a specific Na-K pair of channels, their internal pa-
rameter values, including concentrations, are fixed, so
the most viable possibility of some external control is to
change the external (out cell) Na and K concentrations.
Na

+
out

concentration: We expect that the height of
the spike follows the Na concentration because the Na
Nernst potential also increases as ln[ρNa(out)/ρNa(in)].
Moreover the period of the oscillations is decreased be-
cause of the leak increase. Numerical simulation for differ-
ent Na external concentrations were conducted to confirm

this prediction. The distribution of periods can be seen in
Fig. 8 and mean and variance values in Table 3.

K
+
out

concentration: We have seen in simulations that
the period is rather insensitive to moderate variations of
the external values of K concentration. When increasing it
further a new effect appears. For higher values of Kout con-
centration the difference with the internal concentration is
lower, and then with the channel K open the membrane
polarization is lower (i.e. the potential reach smaller neg-
ative values), as it can be seen in Fig. 9. As a result the K
channel has less tendency to close. Then, for larger time
spans, the system remains in a state with the Na channel
closed and the K channel open. In such state it is nec-
essary a larger fluctuation to induce the closing of the K
channel and initiate the depolarization of the membrane
that will produce the spike (Fig.9b).

This behavior can be seen in more detail in Fig. 10 for a
[Kout] = 0.415M. Note that the periodicity of the spikes,
given until now by the time scale of the Na leak, is now
broken. Instead, to this time it is now added the waiting
time for the stochastic closing of the K channel. This
introduces a new source of stochasticity.

For even larger Kout concentrations the effect is stronger
and the polarization of the membrane is weaker. As a con-
sequence there are very few events of closing of the K gate.
In this case some peaks of the membrane potential can be
observed due to strong fluctuations, but now not neces-
sarily associated with closings of the K channel (Fig. 9c).
This is then an excitable regime controlled by fluctuations.
In this regime the apparition of peaks is expected to be a
stochastic poisson process, with an exponential distribu-

5. Conclusions

We have shown that the periodic spiking activity of the
action potential can be modeled by an unique pair of Na
and K ionic channels, by using a minimal semi-microscopic
approach [20]. The emergence of regular spikes is caused
by the interaction between the channel gates, ionic flows
and the membrane potential, within a unified physical
framework. The system is autonomous and it enters in
the oscillatory regime without any kind of perturbation or
energy supply. The only source of energy is the chemical
energy of the ionic concentration differences between both
sides of the membrane. This is assumed to be controlled
by other cell mechanisms, such as molecular ionic pumps,
not considered here. The dynamical patterns of the spike
events are very similar to those observed in experiments,
with a clear stand-by regimen of membrane depolarization
and a very narrow pulse.
Given the simplicity of the approach it has been possi-

ble to establish the relevant steps and involved variables
in the periodic firing. Special attention has been paid to
the external Na and K concentrations. In particular the K
concentration has shown to be responsible for the transi-
tion from an oscillatory regime, with a well defined period,
to an excitable regime, with stochastic waiting times. The
period is controlled by the Na leak, which could be changed
to model different neurons by using an internal parameter
such as Vd(Y1). In our simulations we have obtained ex-
amples of spike intervals from 2 ms to 25 ms, but results
are in principle not limited by these values.
The approach uses basic physical processes, described

with a minimum of degrees of freedom, implemented by
using standard formalisms of statistical physics. This al-
lows for further possibilities of including other physical
elements and mechanisms, which should permit to cover
additional specific firing patterns. They could further be
combined to deal with more complex neural activity.

the close state, and f(1) = 0 for the open state. The
parameters of the model are indicated in Tables A1-A2.
