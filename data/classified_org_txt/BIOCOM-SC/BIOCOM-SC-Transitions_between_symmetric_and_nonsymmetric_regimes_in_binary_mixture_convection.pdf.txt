Abstract

We present here a comprehensive picture of the different bifurcations
found for small to moderate Rayleigh number in binary-mixture convection
with lateral heating and negative separation ratio (S). The present work
connects the symmetric regime found for pure fluid (S = 0)[1] with the fun-
damentally nonsymmetric regime found for S = −1 [2, 3]. We give a global
context as well as an interpretation for the different associations of bifurca-
tions found, and in particular we interpret an association of codimension-two
bifurcations in terms of a higher codimension bifurcation never found, to our
knowledge, in the study of an extended system.

1. Introduction

The study of convecting systems has a long and rich history, and many of
the techniques developed for their study have been later successfully applied
to broader categories of problems, such of pattern-forming systems [4]. In

particular, the study of the different instabilities has motivated some of the
developments in the field of dynamical systems theory which in turn has led
to a systematic way of approaching the study of convecting systems.

The study of convection in two-component systems, usually referred to
as double-diffusive convection, was originally motivated by oceanographic
problems [5], i.e. by the study of the relative role played by heat and solute
(salt) diffusion in the development of convecting structures in the ocean. The
application of double-diffusive convection to this and other problems, ranging
from alloy solidification to stellar physics has received much attention in the
past [6, 7, 8].

In this paper we study a binary-mixture, that is, a fluid with two miscible
components in which thermodiffusion (Soret effect) is present. The influence
of the Soret effect as a driving force that could build up solutal gradients was
investigated in [9], and the phenomenology uncovered and experimentally
confirmed showed that the system behaved similarly to double-diffusive sys-
tems. This coincidence was later explained [10] by noticing a correspondence
between Soret convection and the double-diffusive case for certain boundary
conditions. This correspondence does not apply in this work.

While the most common setup in convection experiments is that of a fluid
layer heated from below, other configurations are possible. In many situations
(technological, oceanographical, etc.) lateral thermal gradients arise. The
case of lateral thermal and solutal gradients is the one that concerns us in
the present work. The behavior of a double-diffusive system heated from the
side was also described by Stern [11] and Thorpe et al. [12].

With lateral heating and a laterally imposed concentration gradient, con-
vection develops without threshold except in a particular limit in which so-
lute buoyancy is exactly compensated with thermal buoyancy, thus making
possible the existence of a purely diffusive solution. This case was studied
in [13] and then in detail in [14] for low Rayleigh number, establishing the
nature of the first bifurcation from this quiescent state. A subsequent work
[15] studied the dependence of the first bifurcation on the aspect ratio and
in another work [16] the bifurcation diagram of the steady solutions for low
Rayleigh number was computed for different inclinations of the cavity, finally
connecting with the horizontal problem.

The genericity of this particular case of compensating gradients was tested
in [17]. It was proved that the bifurcation diagram is generic, except for
the purely diffusive state which is destroyed when we move away from the
compensating gradients case. This system has been further studied in [18],

2



where the influence of the third dimension is studied for different aspect
ratios. In [19, 20] the multiplicity of steady states in the large aspect ratio
containers of Ref. [16] is studied and interpreted in terms of localized steady
states (convectons).

In the case of lateral heating but without imposing a lateral concentration
gradient a similar quiescent state can be obtained, in this case due to the
solutal gradient built because of the Soret effect [2]. Note that this case is
inequivalent to the previous one. Close to the threshold of the instability of
the purely diffusive state, the behavior was found to be similar to the one
found in the double-diffusive case. Nevertheless, as the Rayleigh number is
increased, a richer variety of scenarios has been found. Most interestingly the
dynamics is dominated by a low-frequency nonsymmetric periodic solution
which appears in a global bifurcation, experiences multiple transformations
and finally disappears in a blue sky catastrophe [2].

This behavior is in sharp contrast with the one found in the pure fluid
case, for the same values of the Prandtl number [21, 1]. In that case, for
the same range of explored Rayleigh numbers, the dynamics remains sym-
metric and steady, and loses stability in a Hopf bifurcation to a short-period
symmetric solution, which disappears for much higher values of the Rayleigh
number in a very complex scenario leading to a chaotic attractor [1].

To explore the genericity of the results of [2] and to bridge the gap with
the pure fluid case, a study of the successive transformations of the global
connection that gives birth to the aforementioned low-frequency nonsym-
metric periodic solution was undertaken in [3]. It was found that this global
connection changed in nature from a saddle-loop to a SNIC and then again
to a saddle-loop, finally to become a Hopf bifurcation in a Takens-Bogdanov
(TB) point.

This Takens-Bogdanov point was found to be associated with a saddle-
node-separatrix loop (SNSL) bifurcation and with a cusp. This conjunction
of codimension-two bifurcations has been found in many problems of very
different nature, from systems biology [22] to lasers [23]. In [3] it was found
that this conjunction and all the low-Rayleigh number dynamics could be
described as a part of the unfolding of a degenerate (codimension-three)
Takens-Bogdanov point, the saddle case found by Dumortier et al. [24].

In this paper we present a comprehensive picture of the transformations
that the bifurcation diagram undergoes as we move away from the case of
compensating gradients to the case of pure fluid. To this end a wide range
of variation of parameters (Rayleigh number and separation ratio) is ex-

3



plored, and different numerical techniques (mainly temporal integration of
dynamical equations and continuation of steady solutions) are employed. In
particular we pay a special attention to the disappearance of the long-period
nonsymmetric solution and to the change of character of the bifurcations
from global to local. This kind of investigation is hampered by the long tem-
poral scales of the associated dynamics and the complexity of the different
scenarios found, and indeed an arduous numerical effort has been necessary
to complete the task. Moreover, the range of parameters spanned is quite
large and some of the most interesting and complex dynamics occurs in very
small regions of parameter space. Luckily, as in Ref. [3], the topology of
the bifurcation lines could be rationalized as associations of codimension-two
bifurcations that could be linked to higher codimension phenomena, which
in fact resulted to be a guide to find and organize them. We think that such
connections constitute an important result of this study.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2 we state the system
under study, its equations and the numerical methods employed. In Sec. 3
we present the results for the different ranges of parameters explored, and
discuss the structure of the bifurcation diagrams. Finally we present the
conclusions in Sec. 4.

2. Formulation of the problem

Binary mixtures are characterized by a cross-diffusion effect called the
Soret effect that describes the diffusive separation of the lighter and heavier
components of the mixture in an imposed temperature gradient. Specifically,
if c is the concentration of the heavier component, its flux is proportional
to −(∇c + c(1 − c)ST∇T ), where ST is the Soret coefficient, and T is the
temperature; then, when ST is negative the heavier component migrates, on
a diffusive time scale, towards the hotter boundary.

In our work, we consider a binary mixture in a 2-D rectangular cavity
of aspect ratio Γ = d/h = 2, where d is the length and h is the height of
the cavity. A difference of temperature ∆T is maintained between the right
and left vertical walls (Tr − Tl = ∆T ) and at the horizontal walls, which are
assumed to be perfectly conducting, a linear temperature profile between the
two prescribed temperatures is imposed. All walls are considered no-slip and
impervious (no mass flux) boundaries.

The Boussinesq equations describing the system are nondimensionalized
using ∆T as unit of temperature, h as the unit of length and the thermal

4



diffusion time in the vertical direction tκ = h
2/κ as the unit of time, κ being

the thermal diffusivity. In the equation of mass-conservation we approxi-
mate the expression of the flux of the heavier component substituting the
concentration c appearing in the thermodiffusion term by its concentration
c0 in the homogeneous mixture and thus the concentration field is scaled by
∆c = −c0(1− c0)ST∆T .

With the stated approximations the dimensionless equations explicitly
read

where u ≡ (vx, vz) is the velocity field in (x, z) coordinates, P is the pressure
over the density, and θ denotes the dimensionless departure of the temper-
ature from a linear horizontal profile. C is the scaled deviation of the con-
centration of the heavier component relative to the linear horizontal profile
which would develop in a pure diffusive state. The dimensionless parameters
are the Prandtl number σ = ν/κ, the Rayleigh number Ra = αgh3∆T/νκ,
the Lewis number τ = D/κ, where ν denotes the kinematic viscosity, g the
acceleration of gravity, α the thermal expansion coefficient, andD is the mass
diffusivity. The separation ratio S is defined as S = c0(1 − c0)

is the mass expansion coefficient (β > 0 for the heavier component).
Boundary conditions are written as

u = θ = n · ∇(θ − C) = 0, at ∂Ω. (5)

Note that there does not exist a redefinition of the pressure that would
eliminate the terms that depend on x in Eq. (1). This means that the con-
ductive solution given by the linear profiles of concentration and temperature
(u = θ = C = 0) typically does not exist. The lateral inhomogeneity in the
density will always lead to buoyancy forces that cannot, in general, be com-
pensated by changes in the pressure of the surrounding liquid. There is only
one exception to this behavior, and is the case in which S = −1. In this case
there exists a purely conductive solution.

Eqs.(1-4), together with boundary conditions (5), remain invariant under
the transformation π, a central symmetry around the point (Γ/2, 1/2),

π : (vx, vz, θ, C) → (−vx,−vz,−θ,−C),

(x, z) → (Γ− x, 1− z).

This is a generalized reflection and the group {π, I} is isomorphic to Z2.
Hence any solution of these equations either is π-invariant (which from now
will be called symmetric) or its image under π is also a solution (constituting
a pair of nonsymmetric solutions). This has important consequences on the
nature of its possible bifurcations [25].

Eqs. (1-4) and boundary conditions (5) have been solved by a second or-
der time-splitting algorithm, proposed by Hugues and Randriamampianina
[26], applied to a pseudo-spectral Chebyshev method. To calculate steady
solutions, we have adapted a pseudo-spectral first-order time-stepping formu-
lation to carry out Newton’s method [27, 28, 29, 30]. In the preconditioned
version of Newton’s iteration, the corresponding linear system is solved by
an iterative technique using a GMRES package [31]. The linear stability
analysis of the steady states is conducted by computing the leading eigenval-
ues of the Jacobian by means of Arnoldi’s method, using routines from the
ARPACK package.

For numerical calculations the chosen parameters have been Prandtl num-
ber σ = 0.00715 and Lewis number τ = 0.03, close to those characteristic of
molten gallium-doped germanium [32, 33]. The system has been discretized
in space by using 60× 30 and 72× 48 mesh points for values of the Rayleigh
number of order Ra ≈ 1000, and 90 × 60 and 120 × 60 mesh points for
Ra ≈ 2000. The accuracy of the results was estimated by evaluating the
change of the Rayleigh number at all the bifurcation points when changing
the numerical parameters within the mentioned ranges, both for those cal-
culated with the Arnoldi Method (steady-state bifurcations) and for those
obtained with the time dependent code, and in the worst case it was better
than 0.1%.

3. Results

description of the results by focusing on different regions of this diagram. In
Subsecs. 3.1 and 3.2 we review previously published results [2, 3] respectively
for S = −1 and for low Ra and S near -1. The solutions and bifurcations
found in those regions are the starting point for studying the transformations
of the dynamics to the very simple scenario existing for the pure fluid at S =
0. In Subsec. 3.3 we describe the low Ra regime, in which the nonsymmetrical
solutions disappear by increasing S. In Subsecs. 3.4 and 3.5 we explore the
complex scenario that occurs for high Ra (Ra = 2000 to Ra = 2500). In
this regime, increasing S makes the bifurcation diagram simpler until only a
Hopf bifurcation of symmetric solutions is found at S = 0.

3.1. Results for S = −1

In this subsection we review previous results obtained for S = −1. As it
has already been mentioned, this precise value of the separation ratio allows
for a quiescent, purely conductive solution, but as the Ra number increases
the system exhibits a rich and interesting behavior. In Fig. 2 we show a
summary of the steady solutions found in the system and their respective
bifurcations. We characterize each steady solution for each value of Ra by
its Nusselt number, defined as the quotient of heat flux through the left
side of the container divided by the heat flux of the corresponding quiescent
solution.

For small Ra, the aforementioned conductive solution is found (line Nu =

1 in Fig. 2), which is stable until a symmetry-preserving transcritical bifurca-
tion T1 occurs at Ra = 541.9. This area of the bifurcation diagram is shown
in more detail in Fig. 3. The supercritical branch is characterized by a very
weak convection (resulting in Nusselt numbers very close to 1), which in the
beginning forms a pattern with a main clockwise roll accompanied by a pair
of counter-clockwise smaller rolls (see inset in Fig. 3). This branch becomes
unstable in a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation (not shown in the figure) for
Ra = 542.4. The nonsymmetric branch born in the pitchfork bifurcation
ends in another pitchfork bifurcation of the conductive state also very close
to T1. This is a scenario very similar to that of double diffusive convection
with N = −1.[17]. The supercritical branch, after losing stability, undergoes
two additional saddle-node bifurcations and ends up meeting the conduc-
tive solution again at another transcritical bifurcation point, T2, as shown
in Fig. 3. There we find a similar structure of bifurcations, with a nonsym-
metric solution connecting again another pair of pitchfork bifurcations. In
the process the convective pattern gains a roll (see inset). This is repeated
successively for larger Ra.

The most interesting dynamics originates from the strongly subcritical
branch born at T1. This branch gains stability at a turning point (SN1) with
a very small Rayleigh number (RaSN1 = 99) and loses it again in a pitchfork
bifurcation (P ) at RaP = 245 (see Fig. 2). At P a nonsymmetric solution
is born, which after the occurrence of T1 is the only remaining stable steady
solution present in the system. In the insets in Fig. 2 representative stream-
function patterns of both branches are shown. Both show strong convection,
with the symmetric solution characterized by a single, counter-clockwise cen-
tered roll. The nonsymmetric solution has a single roll, very similar to the
symmetric one, but displaced to one side. This nonsymmetric solution loses
stability in a saddle node bifurcation SN2 for RaSN2 = 1209, and becomes
more unstable in another saddle node bifurcation SN3 for RaSN3 = 865.6
(see Fig. 2). This branch becomes further unstable still in a Hopf bifurca-
tion (Hns) at RaHns = 2218 with a frequency ωHns = 6.80. Similarly, the
symmetric branch undergoes a Hopf bifurcation (Hsym) at RaHsym = 2137
with a frequency ωHsym = 6.73. Both bifurcations have a very similar fre-
quency, giving a hint of a possible link between the two bifurcations as the
parameters are varied (see Sec. 3.5).

For Ra > RaSN2 no more stable steady solutions are found in the system.
Beyond this value of Ra, the time dependent evolution code reveals the
presence of a periodic stable solution for a wide range of Ra, connected

with the nonsymmetric steady branch through a global bifurcation, namely
a homoclinic saddle-loop connection at RaSL1 = 1183.67, indicated by SL1 in
Fig. 2. The nature of the bifurcation, i.e. the fact that it is a saddle-loop, can
be confirmed by the logarithmic law that the period follows when approaching
the critical point. The evolution of the velocity at a representative point and
the changes in the concentration field along this long-period nonsymmetric
(LPNS) orbit are represented in Fig. 4. When the system is near the unstable
steady symmetric solution (represented by a cross in Fig. 4) the system is
also nearly symmetric, with the large roll in the center, and with a slow
dynamics during which the roll is displacing towards one side forming larger
solute gradients, reaching a state very similar to the nonsymmetric steady
solution (not shown in Fig. 4). At a certain point the solute layer collapses,
giving rise to a fast large excursion through phase space during which the
solute redistributes and the roll returns to the centered position. This fast
evolution shows itself as a large spike in the system response.

By increasing Ra the dynamics of the system becomes more complex. At
first the LPNS orbit remains qualitatively similar until the unstable steady
symmetric solution undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at RaHsym = 2137. While
the symmetric orbit thus generated is unstable, this bifurcation changes the
geometry of phase space and therefore influences the LPNS orbit. At this
value of Ra the LPNS orbit starts to curl, presenting ripples of the same fre-
quency than that of the unstable symmetric orbit. As the Rayleigh number
increases, the LPNS orbit finally becomes unstable in a period-doubling bifur-
cation around Ra = 2220, and becomes rapidly chaotic in a period-doubling
cascade. At this point, the period of the slow oscillations (well reproducible,
with changes smaller than 0.01%) increases dramatically with the Rayleigh
number, making the ratio of the periods of the slow and the fast oscillations
as large as 6000 for Ra = 2255. At this value of Ra the symmetric periodic
orbit has become stable in a pitchfork bifurcation (PPO) at RaPPO = 2253,
and coexists with the stable attractor (see Fig. 5a). The long period of the
attractor finally diverges following a square root law at RaBSC = 2257.73,
where it disappears in a Blue Sky Catastrophe (BSC) bifurcation. The type
of divergence is indicative of a collision with a saddle-node orbit. The sim-
plest scenario accounting for such collision is depicted in Fig. 5b. In this
scenario, the symmetric orbit that appears after Hsym undergoes a pitchfork
bifurcation (PPO). At this pitchfork bifurcation an unstable branch of non-
symmetric periodic orbits appears. Then, this orbit undergoes a saddle-node
bifurcation (SNO2) that makes it stable but shortly after it undergoes an-

other saddle-node bifurcation (SNO1). This saddle-node bifurcation would
be located at RaBSC = 2257.73, at the point where the period diverges. One
could expect that after the BSC the orbit would settle on the stable branch of
SNO1 for higher values of Ra, but instead the orbit disappears into the sym-
metric stable orbit. This would be due to a very small separation between
SNO1 and SNO2 or simply because of a very small basin of attraction of
that orbit. Consistent with that collision is the fact that the (fast) winding
frequency of the attractor and the frequency of the symmetric orbit right
after PPO are very similar, with a common value ω = 7.01.

3.2. Results for low Rayleigh number and low S > −1

The scenario sketched for S = −1 is not specific for this precise value
of S but nonetheless should undergo changes when varying this parameter
in order to accommodate the simpler scenario found for a pure fluid [1], i.e.
for S = 0. In this subsection we review the transformations of the steady
nonsymmetric branch, and in particular the eventual disappearance of the
global bifurcation SL1 that originates the LPNS orbit, together with the
saddle nodes SN2 and SN3, until only a Hopf bifurcation remains. These
results were discussed in detail in a previous work ([3]).

As we have seen above (see Fig. 2), for S = −1 there is a range of values
of Ra for which the only stable solutions found are the steady nonsymmetric
solution, whose stability ends at SN2, and the LPNS orbit, connected to the
former at the global bifurcation SL1. At this collision the period of the orbit

presents a logarithmic divergence, thus confirming the saddle-loop nature of
the connection. This part of the branch of steady solutions presents two
turning points: SN2, where the solution become unstable, and SN3, where
an additional eigenvalue becomes positive thus increasing its instability.

The transformations of these bifurcations when increasing S can be an-
alyzed following the results depicted in Fig. 6. The first qualitative change
when S increases occurs when the locus of the global connection SL1 moves
towards SN2, until it meets the saddle-node at about S = −0.922, becom-
ing a SNIC (saddle node on an invariant circle) global bifurcation. This is
the situation depicted for S = −0.9 in Fig. 6a. In this case the connection
point is also located by the divergence of the period, but the law ceases to
be logarithmic to become of square-root type.

For larger S new bifurcations of codimension-one appear. In Fig. 6a
it is shown that for S = −0.897 two new bifurcations have appeared very
close to the turning point SN3, a Hopf bifurcation (H0) at which a periodic
solution is born and, for a slightly higher value of Ra, another saddle-loop
bifurcation (SL2) at which the orbit born at H0 collides with a saddle point.
The simultaneous appearance of these two bifurcations is caused by a Takens-
Bogdanov bifurcation (see below) between S = −0.9 and S = −0.897. The
nonsymmetric steady state between SN3 and H0 has also become stable due
to the same cause. If Ra is further increased, the nonsymmetric periodic
orbit reappears in a SNIC bifurcation at SN2.

14



When the value of S is raised a little, up to S = −0.8966, the latter
global SNIC connection point detaches from SN2, thus becoming a saddle-
loop again. At this moment we have a solution branch with two saddle-
loop connections, very close to each other. As before, this was tested by
performing a fit to the logarithmic law for the divergence of the periods of
the two connections.

If we turn now to Fig. 6a, we see that for S = −0.894, both global
connections have disappeared and hence the orbit is created at H0. If S is
further increased, SN2 and SN3 annihilate each other in a codimension-two
cusp bifurcation that occurs at S = −0.8928. The final situation, in which
only the Hopf bifurcation (with very low frequency) is found, is represented
by the S = −0.892 branch of Fig. 6a.

All of the previous results can be understood in terms of the different
connections between codimension-two bifurcations in the Ra − S plane, as
shown in Fig. 6b. The point near S = −0.922 at which the global connection
attaches to the SN2 point (not shown in Fig. 6b, see Fig. 1) is in fact a saddle-
node separatrix-loop codimension-two bifurcation. We denote it by SNSL2.
This point is then the merging of the two bifurcation lines corresponding
to the SN2 and SL1 bifurcations from S = −1, forming a SNIC line until
the global connection detaches from SN2 near S = −0.8970. This detach-
ment point is another SNSL, SNSL1, and a line of homoclinic saddle-loop
connections (SL2) is also born there. This line of global connections turns
towards lower values of S, thus explaining the previous duplicity of saddle-
loop connections. The SL2 line ends meeting the SN3 line at the birth of the
H0 line at S = −0.8990 in a Takens-Bogdanov (TB) point, which is charac-
terized by the presence of a double zero eigenvalue. This codimension-two
point explains the linked appearance of the H0 and the second saddle-loop
in figure 6a for S = −0.897.

As S is increased, the SN3 and the SN2 lines approach each other, until
they finally meet at a cusp bifurcation point around S = −0.8928 (this
bifurcation is denoted as C). For larger values of S, as it has previously been
stated, the boundary of existence of the LPNS orbit is the H0 line. Thus,
the birth of this orbit has switched from a global to a local bifurcation, but
for large enough values of Ra the origin of the orbit is indistinguishable, as
the positive eigenvalues of the steady state become also complex conjugate
for instance in S = −1.

The bifurcation diagram described above for this low-Rayleigh regime is
remarkable in that it is not specific of this problem, but rather has a generic

15



character[3]. Indeed it can be found as a slice in parameter space in the
unfolding of a codimension-three degenerate Takens-Bogdanov point ([24])
also known as the Dumortier-Roussarie-Sotomayor (DRS) bifurcation.

3.3. Disappearance of the nonsymmetric regime

In this subsection we will describe in detail how the nonsymmetric regime
disappears when S is increased further in the low Ra region. This low Ra
region is shown in Fig. 7. We are now in the right part of the complete
diagram (Ra-S diagram, Fig. 1), at values of separation ratio S > −0.83. For
the smaller values ofRa we still have the line P of pitchfork bifurcations of the
symmetric solutions that gives rise to steady nonsymmetric solutions. Above
this line we find the branch of Hopf bifurcations H0 of these nonsymmetric
solutions, which is the result of the transformations described in the previous
subsection. The dynamics in this region of the bifurcation diagram is simpler
than that of other regions discussed above, since the dynamics is controlled by
only three branches of bifurcations (the already discussed P andH0 lines plus
a new line of saddle node bifurcations SN) and one codimension-two point,
DP2. The Hopf bifurcations undergone by the nonsymmetric steady solution
are of small frequency (see subsection 3.2). The SN branch corresponds to
the saddle-node points of the branches of steady nonsymmetric solutions, and
DP2 is a degenerate pitchfork located in the low Ra part of the pitchfork
branch.

In the inset of Fig. 7 we show schematically the solutions and their stabil-
ity as a function of the Rayleigh number for S = −0.81 (which is indicated
by the vertical line in the S-Ra diagram). We can observe a branch of steady
symmetric solutions that are unstable in the region between the two pitch-
fork bifurcations. These solutions lose stability again at Ra ≈ 2200 where
they undergo Hopf bifurcations (not shown in this figure, they correspond to
the curve Hsym shown in Fig. 1). Steady nonsymmetric solutions exist from
the low-Ra P (which is a supercritical pitchfork) to SN , and are unstable in
the region delimited by the curve H0. In this region stable periodic nonsym-
metric solutions exist (the LPNS orbit). Between the high-Ra P (subcritical
pitchfork) and SN there exist two different nonsymmetric steady solutions,
one stable and the other unstable. This scenario persists until the turning
point of the curve H0, which occurs at S ≈ −0.783. For less negative values
of the separation ratio S, and for values of the Rayleigh number smaller than
2500, there are no more periodic nonsymmetric orbits.

the last four values.

17



From S = −0.783 to S = −0.7594 the scenario is similar to that depicted
in Fig. 7, except that now the two Hopf bifurcations and the branch of
nonsymmetric periodic solutions are no longer present. At S = −0.7594 and
Ra = 792, a codimension-two bifurcation takes place: a degenerate pitchfork
(DP2), where the pitchfork of the lower branch changes from supercritical
to subcritical (see this region in more detail in Fig. 8a). From that point on
and for a fixed value of S, the region of values of Rayleigh number for which
steady nonsymmetric solutions exist is limited by two saddle-node points.
Namely, we find nonsymmetric stable solutions in all the Ra range between
the two values of the SN curve, and nonsymmetric unstable between each
SN and its closest point on the P curve. At S ≈ −0.7593 (turning point of
curve P ) the two subcritical pitchforks annihilate each other, and increasing
further S the branches of nonsymmetric solutions constitute isolas. These
isolas collapse at S ≈ −0.75895, which corresponds to the turning point of
the SN curve. This scenario is shown in Fig. 8b, where we have represented
a parameter ǫ, quantifying the symmetry breaking of a solution, as a function
of the Rayleigh number for different values of S. The parameter ǫ is built as
follows

ǫ = vz(xo, zo) + vz(Γ− x0, 1− z0),

and hence the steady symmetric solutions lie on the horizontal line ǫ = 0.
The intersection points of the curves with the ǫ = 0 axis are the pitchfork
bifurcations from which the nonsymmetric solutions (which are represented
here as continuous lines regardless of their stability) are born. The outer
curve is for S = −0.7596 and the inner is for S = −0.758955.

3.4. High Ra. Connection with S = −1

If S is increased in the high Ra regime, the picture presented in section
3.1 remains valid in a range of values of S close to −1. In Fig 9 we see a
diagram of the bifurcations for that region in parameter space.

Again, the LPNS orbit loses stability in a period doubling or flip (f)
bifurcation, and very quickly becomes a chaotic attractor in a period doubling
cascade as Ra is increased. Again, the divergence of the (average) long period
of the attractor follows an inverse square-root law, which allows us to identify
its disappearance as a Blue-Sky Catastrophe.

As S is increased, the flip bifurcation moves slightly towards smaller val-
ues of Ra, and for a high enough value of S the LPNS orbit loses stability
to a quasi-periodic solution, i.e. becomes a torus in a Neimark-Sacker bifur-
cation (NS1). The nature of this transition, marked in Fig. 9 by B, is not

region bounded by the dotted rectangle is presented in Fig. 10.

clear, for several reasons. First, this transition point is very hard to locate.
We have located points where the long-period orbit becomes a torus, then
for a slightly higher value of Ra it enters in a resonance region, and there
it undergoes a period-doubling cascade, thus becoming a chaotic attractor.
Also, the orbit can become chaotic following an initial flip bifurcation and a
subsequent period-doubling cascade, only to follow a reverse period-doubling
cascade for higher Ra and then become a torus in a NS bifurcation. The
regions where this mixed behavior occurs become narrower and narrower
around point B, and hence it is hard to pinpoint a single codimension-two
bifurcation as the reason for this behavior.

Also, the transition from the chaotic attractor to a torus (marked by
a thick discontinuous broken line in Fig. 9) is problematic to characterize.
Resonant orbits have been found with many different periods in that re-
gion (there are instances with 3, 5, 7, 11 and many more multiples of the
fundamental period), and there are many instances of multistability, as in
(S,Ra) = (−0.9525, 2181.2), where the LPNS orbit coexists with a period-18
resonance. The many resonance regions found, possibly due to the extreme
difference between the fast and the slow frequency, obscure thus this transi-
tion to the point where we do not find one scenario but many. Furthermore, it
has to be noted that the closer we are to the transition region the transients,
which might be chaotic, become longer and longer, hence making more and

19



more difficult to identify unequivocally the nature of the attractor.
For higher values of Ra, as S is increased, the nature of the disappearance

of the attractor also changes. In a similarly obscure scenario, in the region
in parameter space marked with A, the BSC changes to a homoclinic torus
bifurcation at the line marked with h in Fig. 9. There are some evidences for
the identification of the homoclinic torus bifurcation. On the one hand, the
Poincare section performed on the temporal evolution shows that the solution
is quasiperiodic, for values of S high enough (to the right of the thick broken
line in Fig. 9). On the other hand we measure a logarithmic divergence
law for the slow period of the quasiperiodic solution when approaching the
bifurcation. Again, it is not clear the nature of the change from BSC to
homoclinic torus bifurcation, as very close to A resonant zones again tend
to accumulate, and longer and longer time series are needed to characterize
the behavior of the system, a problem aggravated by the fact that the long
period is divergent.

For values of S high enough, the bifurcation scenario becomes much more
clear, as the regions with periodic or quasiperiodic solutions are unambigu-
ously identified. The h bifurcation line turns towards higher values of Ra,
and there are no more global bifurcations present. For S > −0.92, if Ra is in-
creased, the quasiperiodic solution disappears in a low-frequency backwards
NS bifurcation, NS2, where a short-period nonsymmetric orbit bifurcates.
This orbit in turn disappears for high enough Ra in a saddle node of peri-
odic orbits (SNPO), and thus the only remaining solution is the symmetric
orbit that had become stable in the pitchfork of periodic orbits (PPO).

If we continue the three bifurcation lines h, NS2 and SNPO towards
higher values of Ra and more negative values of S, using time evolution, we
find that the long period of NS2 becomes longer and longer as the three lines
converge to a point around (S,Ra) = (−0.975, 2474.73).

Given the nature of the bifurcation lines that converge at that point,
we identify it as a codimension-two bifurcation, a Takens-Bogdanov point of
periodic orbits (TBPO). Beyond this point, there are no more nonsymmet-
ric solutions that are stable, and the only stable solution remaining is the
symmetric periodic short-period orbit that becomes stable at PPO.

Figure 10: Enlargement of the dotted rectangle in Fig. 9. Dashed lines correspond to
bifurcations between unstable states, found by continuation. In the insets a) to d) are
represented diagrams of the solutions present in the corresponding constant-S cuts. An
enlargement of the small dotted rectangle near S = −0.845 between cuts c) and d) is
shown in Fig. 11a

Hopf-Hopf bifurcation, HH . In Fig. 10 we show an enlargement of Fig. 9,
with some bifurcation diagrams on the side to help discuss the dynamics.

First, in Fig. 10a we show a diagram of a representative cut of the dy-
namics before the HH point for S ≈ −0.9. We show the two unstable steady
solutions as two parallel dashed lines, corresponding to the symmetric and
the nonsymmetric branch of developed solutions shown in Fig. 2 for S = −1.
At Hsym a symmetric unstable orbit appears, which becomes stable at PPO,
where an unstable nonsymmetric orbit appears.

Also, as it has been described in the previous section, the LPNS becomes
unstable in a forward NS bifurcation (NS1) and then the resulting torus
disappears in a reverse NS (NS2), where a short-period nonsymmetric orbit
bifurcates. This orbit loses stability at SNPO, finally connecting with the
PPO point. The LPNS orbit, unstable for Ra > RaNS1 , disappears in a

21



backward Hopf bifurcation (H0) of the nonsymmetric solution, which is the
same through which it is created in the low-Ra regime for S > STB, see Sec-
tion 3.2. The unstable short-period nonsymmetric orbit appears in the Hopf
bifurcation Hns of the nonsymmetric steady solution before becoming stable
at NS2. This is the same bifurcation that was introduced in Section 3.1.

As we have mentioned before, NS1 and NS2 meet at HH . To fully
characterize the point HH we should locate the relative position of Hns,
H0, NS1 and NS2. From the angle at which these bifurcation lines meet
at HH we conjecture that the sequence, in ascending Ra, is Hns-NS1-NS2-
H0, which corresponds to the (time-reversed) case Ia of the classification of
Guckenheimer and Holmes [34].

In Fig. 10b we show the bifurcation diagram right after the HH point.
Now, the non-symmetric steady solution is stable again between H0 and Hns,
which have inverted their order, and of course the torus has disappeared.

If we keep increasing S we observe first that PPO and Hns cross each
other, but this is not a codimension-two bifurcation as they are bifurcations of
different solutions. For S = −0.84762, Hns and SNPO meet at a Degenerate
Hopf / Bautin codimension-two point, DH , near Ra = 2146.09. At this
point Hns changes, ceasing to be a supercritical Hopf to become subcritical.
This is illustrated in Fig. 10c, where we show how the non-symmetric steady
solution now does not become an orbit for Ra > RaHns and hence beyond
this point the only stable solution remaining is the symmetric periodic orbit,
which becomes stable at the PPO point. Also for this value of S, we find
again the P bifurcation that was present for low Ra, and there is where the
nonsymmetric steady solution branch ceases to exist as Ra is increased.

With a slight increase of S, the bifurcation landscape changes dramati-
cally. As it is portrayed in Fig. 10d, now Hsym and P have exchanged their
order, and the symmetric steady solution is stable again in the region be-
tween P and Hsym. P has changed from subcritical to supercritical, with an
additional saddle node, and Hns and PPO have disappeared altogether. In
that small interval of S, many changes have taken place, obviously related
with the pitchfork-Hopf (P -Hsym) interaction.

In Fig. 11a we portray an enlargement of that small region, enclosed by
a dotted rectangle near S = −0.845 in Fig. 10.

As we see in the figure, as S is increased, P changes from a subcritical
to a supercritical bifurcation in a degenerate pitchfork codimension-two bi-
furcation (DP1) at S = −0.845084 similar to the previously described DP2
(see Section 3.3). At this point, the previously described SN branch appears.

case of the degenerate pitchfork-Hopf interaction, computed through a stereographic pro-
jection (see [35] and Appendix A).

This branch has a tangency point with the Hns branch at the ZH point at
S = −0.844829.

The ZH point is a zero-Hopf (also fold-Hopf) codimension-two point.
From the relative stability of the different solutions surrounding it, we char-
acterize it as case IV a/IV b of [34].

The Hns, P , Hsym and PPO branches meet at a pitchfork-Hopf point at
(S,Ra) = (−0.844817, 2127.38) (PH). The relative stability of the solutions
(the symmetric steady, the nonsymmetric steady, the symmetric orbit, the
non symmetric orbit) surrounding the PH point lead us to identify it un-
ambiguously with case V III in the unfolding of the Hopf-Hopf bifurcation
in [34]. Note that we can do that when it is not critical the fact that the
normal form is four-dimensional, e.g. in the absence of resonances.

After the PH point we recover the scenario depicted in Fig. 10d, but
the fact that there are so many codimension-two bifurcations so close to
each other has led us to conjecture that this scenario is related with the
degeneracy of a codimension-three point, a higher codimension point where
codimension-two bifurcations converge.

We have found a codimension-three candidate in a Degenerate pitchfork-
Hopf (DPH) point, and we identify it with case DHPiv from Algaba et al.
[35] (in fact, they study a degenerate Hopf - pitchfork interaction, see Ap-
pendix A for the details of the correspondence). In Fig. 11b we show a
diagram of the unfolding of this codimension-three point. Since it is a three-
dimensional parameter space, we are portraying the stereographic projection

23



of the surface of a sphere surrounding the singular point. Also, similarly as in
our bifurcation diagram, the lines identified as Hns, PPO and P cross at non-
codimension-two points. Note the similarity with our bifurcation diagram,
as it also incorporates DP2.

This association of codimension-two bifurcations acts as an organizing
center for parameter space, and explains the transition from symmetric to
nonsymmetric solutions as S is decreased. In that respect we note that
beyond Hns and SN there are no more nonsymmetric solutions for higher S
and Ra, in the studied parameter range, which helps make the connection
with the S = 0 case[1], where no such solutions were found. As we have seen
in Section 3.3, in a different Ra interval, the last nonsymmetric solution is
an isola associated with a turn in the SN branch at about S = −0.758955.

Besides of the transition from symmetric to nonsymmetric solutions, the
codimension-two bifurcations surrounding PH help explain the different ways
in which the fast frequency appears. In [2] it was noted how Hsym and Hns
have a very similar associated frequency at S = −1. The present study
provides a connection between both of them, and also with PPO. Note that
the stability boundary for the symmetric orbit at S = 0 was Hsym at Ra =
1991 [1], whereas for S = −1 it became stable at PPO, for Ra = 2253.67 .
The point PH provides a transition between the two stability boundaries.

4. Conclusions

We have performed a comprehensive study of the dynamics of binary-
mixture convection on a laterally heated cavity, across a very large range of
parameters, and we have connected the results reported for S = 0 [1] with
those for S = −1 [2, 3], providing an interpretation in terms of dynamical
systems. To this end we have studied both steady and time-dependent so-
lutions (finding periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic behaviors) by both time
evolution and continuation of steady solutions, as discussed in Section 2.

We have calculated and described most of the codimension-two bifurca-
tions of steady solutions found in that parameter range, and we have provided
an interpretation in terms of higher codimension bifurcations in some cases,
such as the DRS [24] or the DPH [35] bifurcations. Let us emphasize that
as far as we know these later bifurcations had previously been found only in
small-dimensionality ODE models, whereas in this work we have dealt with a
space-dependent fluid system, as described by the PDE system given by Eqs.

24



(1-4), which have been integrated directly. Comparable complex scenarios
have been found in Taylor-Couette flows [36, 37, 38].

Also, we ascertain that the identification of higher codimension phenom-
ena provide robustness. Small variations of the other parameters might give
different unfoldings, but cannot change the nature of the singularity. Further-
more, the practical approach of conjecturing higher codimension phenomena
helps focus the attention on small parts of parameter space, see e.g. Fig. 11.
Without a prior idea of the codimension-two points to expect, the analysis
and the continuation of these bifurcation lines would be very hard, given the
very different scales present in parameter space. We note here a recent work
discussing codimension-three bifurcations by Tuckerman [39].

Physically, the symmetric periodic solution that is born at Hsym is only
weakly dependent on the solute field, its development is related with the
strength of the flow field, which in turn depends on the global thermal gra-
dient. As Ra is increased it is the only remaining stable solution. Also, it is
noteworthy that all the nonsymmetric solutions appear when S is negative
enough, relating symmetry with the ratio of buoyancies or with the Soret
effect.

An important point that has to be addressed regarding these results is
whether the bidimensionality of the system hinders the connection with ex-
perimental results. This question cannot be fully answered, as we know of
no experimental realizations or three-dimensional simulations of the exact
system of study, but we can extrapolate from what is known experimentally
for the pure fluid and what has been found in prior numerical results. There
are not many experiments of low-Prandtl number lateral convection. The
fluids are often opaque, which makes it very difficult to measure their prop-
erties. Perhaps the most common material is gallium [40, 41], studied to
characterize the secondary instabilities in rectangular boxes. Experiments
show a basic quasi 2D flow which becomes unstable in a Hopf bifurcation
[40]. Both 3D and 2D simulations agree that the secondary instabilities are
oscillating [40, 42], with a threshold depending strongly on the aspect ra-
tio, but experiments show a supercritical Hopf bifurcation incompatible with
numerical results, which is attributed to non-Boussinesq effects [40]. Hence,
while simulations provide a good threshold for the secondary instability, they
do not characterize properly the system, regardless of the dimensionality.
Recent works [43, 44] have also characterized the secondary instabilities of
low-Prandtl number fluids in a laterally heated cylinder. In particular, in
Ref. [44] the 3D case is compared with the 2-dimensional problem for the

25



same aspect ratio and Prandtl number [1], finding comparable results for the
first bifurcation.

There exist some related numerical works that have been devoted to study
the importance of the third dimension. For pure fluids and lateral convection,
it has been studied the effect of three-dimensional disturbances on a 2D
flow [30]. It was found, through a linear stability analysis, that the results
depended critically of the Prandtl number. For higher Prandtl numbers the
secondary instability remains 2D, but for smaller Prandtl number the 3D
destabilization mechanism becomes more important, depending nevertheless
on the aspect ratio. For the double-diffusive problem, in Ref. [18] the third
dimension brings an extra branch of solutions, without changing the other
branches except for their relative stability. In an intermediate range of Ra,
the problem reduces to the well-known two-dimensional problem [45, 14, 15,
17] when the vertical sides of the box parallel to the thermal gradient are far
enough, so that even if they act as sources of vorticity this will be swamped
by the two-dimensional density-driven flow when the box is long enough [18].

In conclusion, we expect that in a realistic setting, a basic steady quasi-2D
flow followed by an oscillating instability for high enough Rayleigh number
will develop, in correspondence with the pure fluid and the double-diffusive
case. The nature of this oscillation will change when modifying the 3D shape
of the box or when some physical aspects of the problem are included in the
model, as it occurs in the previously cited experiments and numerics[40, 42].
Regarding the unstable and stable steady solutions that we find, we expect,
as in the numerical examples for the double diffusive problem, that their
stability will change when considering 3D aspects of the realistic problem,
but the branches of the equivalent 2D solutions are likely to be present[30, 18],
at least in rectangular boxes in which the presence of transverse walls has
small influence. Lastly, little can be said about whether the periodic solutions
will survive in a three-dimensional setting, but there is nothing that forbids
them from having close analogues for limiting values of the aspect ratio.

Finally, despite the detail and the large range of parameters studied, this
study still has some limitations, such as the full characterization of points
A (interaction BSC - homoclinic torus) and B (interaction flip - Neimark-
Sacker) in the bifurcation diagram (see Fig. 9). While the unfolding of the
former is mostly unknown, there has been some theoretical work on the latter
[46, 47, 48], highlighting its complexity. This particular interaction has also
been observed in molten gallium convection experiments [49]. As we have
discussed, the huge difference between the two frequencies, long transients,

26



divergent periods, multistability and the abundance of resonant solutions
obscure the interpretation of A and B. Hence, the characterization of these
two points remains as future work.

Appendix A. Unfolding of the codimension-three singularity

In this appendix we detail the correspondence between the DHPiv case
from Algaba et al. [35], and the codimension-three bifurcation which, as we
conjecture, gives an explanation of the association of many of the codimension-
two bifurcations found in the intermediate Ra range.

While in [35] the case discussed is the interaction of a degenerate Hopf
bifurcation with a pitchfork, their analysis is also valid for a degenerate
pitchfork-Hopf interaction, in the same way as it is valid, to a certain extent,
for nonlinear degenerate Hopf-Hopf interactions. It is trivial to adapt their
results to our case, but we nevertheless do it, since the case of interest,
DHPiv, is not discussed in detail in [35].

We start by writing down an unfolding of the singularity. The variable
z corresponds to the symmetry breaking and ρ is a radial variable, corre-
sponding to the radius of the periodic solution. The angular variable has
been omitted, as the dynamics of z and ρ is decoupled from it (i.e. there is
rotational symmetry).

where a 6= 0, 1, 2 and c = ±1, d = ±1. Observe that this is simply Eq. (8)
from reference [35], with z and ρ exchanged.

Taking different values of a, b, c we obtain the different cases of the un-
folding, all discussed in [35]. In order to identify which is the case that
corresponds to ours we proceed in an indirect fashion. First, we identify the

27



type of the codimension-two bifurcations that correspond to our results, and
when that can only correspond to a possible case of the unfolding, we identify
it.

In our case, we identified the PH point in Fig. 11a as the case V III
in the unfolding of the Hopf-Hopf bifurcation, following Guckenheimer and
Holmes [34]. Furthermore, we identify the ZH point with the case IV a/IV b
for the Fold-Hopf bifurcation, following again the nomenclature of [34].

The previous identification of the PH and ZH bifurcations lead to an un-
ambiguous identification among the degenerate pitchfork-Hopf bifurcations
studied by Algaba et al. [35, 50, 51]. The case DHPiv from [35] is the
only that corresponds to the explored bifurcation diagram, incorporating
both codimension-two bifurcations in the specified case. Note that we do
not prove that a projection of the global boundary value problem has this
particular degeneracy, but we use this as a conjecture in order to further
investigate parameter space. In our case, this led to the finding of the de-
generate pitchfork bifurcations DP1 and DP2, that correspond directly with
the ones found on Fig. 11b.

Figure 11b has been computed by finding the bifurcations of the steady
solutions of Eqs. (A.1-A.2) in the case DHPiv (a > 0, c = +1, d = +1). In
the three-dimensional parameter space spanned by (µ1, µ2, µ3) we consider
only the sphere given by µ2

= k2. We find the points (lines) where

the codimension-two (one) bifurcations intersect the surface. In Fig. 11b we
plot a stereographic projection of this sphere.
