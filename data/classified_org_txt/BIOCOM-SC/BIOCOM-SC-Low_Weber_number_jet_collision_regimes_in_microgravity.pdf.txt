The outcome of the collision between two liquid jets depends on the liquid properties, jet velocity6
and impact angle. So far studies on liquid jet impingement have been carried out in normal gravity7
conditions. In microgravity, jets are not accelerated and can show a different behavior than on8
ground. We perform an experimental analysis of the injection of liquid jets in microgravity, focusing9
in the jet impingement at different velocities and impact angles at low Weber number. Several10
regimes are obtained, some of which are not observable on ground. Other regimes take place at11
different parameters ranges than in normal gravity. A map of the observed regimes is proposed in12
terms of the Weber number and the impact angle.13

INTRODUCTION15

The collision between two liquid jets can result in16
merging, bouncing, or dispersion in form of droplets [1–17
3]. The outcome of the collision can be controlled by18
changing two parameters, namely the flow rate and the19
impact angle of the colliding jets. Hence, the impinging20
jets configuration with changeable orientation becomes a21
simple and flexible method to enhance mixing. This con-22
figuration can be found in a variety of applications such23
as propellant injection in rocket engines, agrochemical24
coating, ink-jet printing, as well as in several pharma-25
ceutical processes.26

Most studies on liquid jets have focused on the de-27
scription of the jet breakup mechanisms and the result-28
ing droplet characteristics. The pioneering work of Lord29
Rayleigh on the linear stability analysis around the cylin-30
drical base state was followed by numerous works consid-31
ering non-linear effects that can become dominant in the32
breakup process. Very complete reviews of the underly-33
ing physics behind the jet breakup mechanisms can be34
found in Lin [4] and Eggers and Villermaux [5]. Three35
modes of liquid behaviour with their associated breakup36
mechanisms can take place in the laminar regime in nor-37
mal gravity conditions: periodic dripping, chaotic drip-38
ping and jetting. Many attempts to model the breakup39
of liquid filaments or the transition between different40
regimes have been carried out [6–14]. Gravity force is41
neglected in most models, even though gravity can affect42
the jet breakup in cases like low surface tension fluids.43
Different modes of liquid jetting have been found in ex-44
periments in microgravity conditions [15, 16]. Umemura45
and Wakashima [17] and Tsukiji et al. [18] studied the46
atomization regimes of a liquid jet in weightlessness, as47
well as the effects of pressure and temperature. Suñol and48
González-Cinca [19, 20] reported a quantitative analysis49
of the breakup length, droplet size and jet structure in50
the breakup of a liquid jet in microgravity.51

When two liquid jets collide, they can coalesce forming52

a new jet, a liquid chain or a sheet; bounce off each other;53
or disintegrate in the form of small droplets. The criti-54
cal element determining merging versus bouncing is the55
dynamics of the air film that separates the colliding inter-56
faces. Jets can attract and coalesce when the thickness of57
the film is reduced to the range of the intermolecular van58
der Waals forces (of the order of 100 nm). Li et al. [21]59
identified soft and hard merging mechanisms of colliding60
jets. In addition, they demonstrated that bouncing is61
confined to regimes of low Stokes number and high ratio62
between jet and capillary waves velocity. These regimes63
represent weak impact inertia and weak capillary effects,64
respectively. Given the dependence of these effects on65
liquid properties, bouncing in water was predicted to be66
non observable at atmospheric conditions. Wadha et al.67
[22] captured qualitatively the transition of colliding jets68
from bouncing to coalescence by means of a parameter69
determined by the Weber and Reynolds numbers as well70
as the angle of collision. All the studies carried out up un-71
til now belong to the inertia-dominated regime achieved72
under normal gravity conditions. The collision between73
liquid jets in microgravity conditions has not been ad-74
dressed yet, even though the non-accelerated jets could75
give rise to new phenomenologies of potential interest for76
the design of space systems such as low-thrust satellite77
positioners and the operation of bipropellant rocket en-78
gines.79

At high Weber number, the effects of gravity force on80
the collision between jets can be neglected since the ac-81
celeration generated to the jets is very low compared to82
the change in velocitiy caused by the collision. Thus,83
experiments in a microgravity environment are not ex-84
pected to provide any new understanding on the char-85
acteristics of liquid jet collisions at high Weber number.86
However, at low Weber number, microgravity conditions87
are necessary to maintain the symmetry of the collision88
configuration.89

In the present study, we analyze the injection of liquid90
jets in microgravity conditions, with a particular empha-91

sis in the impingement of jets at different velocities and92
collision angles. Our aim is to determine the regimes that93
take place at low Weber number We = ρdnv

2/σ, where94
ρ is the liquid density, dn is the nozzle diameter, v is the95
velocity, and σ is the surface tension, and to compare96
them with results in normal gravity conditions.97

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP98

In order to carry out experiments in microgravity con-99
ditions, an experimental setup was designed to be used100
at the ZARM drop tower. In this platform, setups are101
placed inside an airtight capsule (1.5 m long and 80102
cmwide) that is pulled up to a height of 120 meters at103
the top of the drop tube and released. After 4.74 s,104
the experiment lands in the deceleration unit filled with105
polystyrene pellets. During the free fall, the pressure106
inside the drop tube is 10−5 atm. The low air resis-107
tance allows the ZARM drop tower to provide a very108
good quality of microgravity of approximately 10−6g0,109
where g0 = 9.81 m/s

2 is the gravity acceleration at sea110
level.111

Distilled water (ρ = 998 kg/m3, σ = 7.28 ·10−2 N/m2)112
was injected from two nozzles (dn = 1 mm) at variable113
orientation and flow rate. The impact angle 2α of the jets114
was changed from 6◦ (quasi-parallel jets) to 180◦ (frontal115
collision). The flow rate at each nozzle Q varied from 5116
to 100 ml/min, which corresponds to 0.5 ≤We ≤ 62.117

The flow rate was controlled and maintained by a high-118
accuracy liquid pump (Ismatec MCP-Z Standard), which119
assured a constant flow at each nozzle in microgravity120
conditions. A T-junction bifurcated the flow into two121
sub-lines, each of them connected to a manual valve that122
compensated any irregularities in the flow split at the123
T-junction. Images were recorded by means of a high-124
speed camera (Photron FastCam MC2) at 1000 fps with125
a resolution of 512x512 pixels each frame. Both the flow126
rate and the high-speed camera were controlled remotely127
using LabView software.128

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION129

The breakup length Lb of a single jet was obtained130
over N = 500 frames for every Q, and the average value131
〈Lb〉 = 1N

∑N
i=1 Lbi was calculated. The breakup length132

shows a linear behaviour with the jet velocity (hence with133 √

an irregular elongated shape (“b”). When inertia over-142
comes surface tension, a liquid jet is formed (“c”, “d”143
and “e” in Fig. 1). The transition from dripping to jet-144
ting occurs at a critical Weber (Wecr ≈ 2.3). At low145
flow rates in the jetting regime (We & Wecr), the droplet146
size and generation frequency are highly unpredictable147
(“c”). As the flow rate increases, the droplets generated148
from the jet breakup become smaller and with a lower149
size dispersion (“d” and “e”). In this case, the average150
jet breakup length increases linearly with the square root151
of the Weber number [20].152

A wide range of regimes emerge as a result of the153
oblique and frontal jet interactions (see in Table I all154
the cases studied, where v is the liquid injection veloc-155
ity). Figure 2 shows the regimes obtained in the oblique156
jet interaction. In Figs. 2a and 2d, a nonuniform spatial157
distribution of noncoalescing droplets is generated. Figs.158
2b and 2e show droplets from different jets coalescing159
with each other. Soft merging between low velocity jets160
with a sudden bend of the jets very close to the merging161
point can be observed in Figs. 2c and 2f. Hard merging162
takes place at high impact inertia, giving rise to a liquid163
chain (Fig. 2g) or a sheet (Fig. 2h and 2i). At low values164
of 2α used (6◦ ≤ 2α ≤ 22◦), jets bounced off each other165
with an outgoing angle 2φ smaller than the impact angle166
(Figure 2j). The non coalescence between jets can be re-167
lated to the behaviour of the film of air separating both168
interfaces as they come close to each other, as found in169
[22]. Jets drag along air into the collision region, where170
it is squeezed in a thin film. Since the thickness of the171
air film is much smaller than the other dimensions, lubri-172
cation approximation is applicable, which results in high173
magnitude forces keeping the jets apart. As soon as the174
air between jets is drained out, coalescence could take175
place.176

The transition from jet bouncing to coalescence is il-177

lustrated in Fig. 3. The bouncing regime corresponds178
to a metastable state, and coalescence is triggered by an179
instability in the interface of the colliding jets. A film180
of air is entrained by the liquid flow and is continuously181
replenished, resulting in a self-sustained noncoalescence.182
However, a sufficiently large perturbation in the jet flow183

(which can be due to nozzle vibrations, pump anomalous184
operation, or the presence of a colloid in the liquid) can185
force the air to quickly drain out giving rise to coales-186
cence.187

Due to the symmetry of the problem, the dynamics188
of the air layer between colliding jets is analogous to189
that of the droplet impact on solid surfaces [21]. The190
width of the air layer Hd scales with the dimensionless191
impact velocity as Hd/R = AISt

−2/3, where R = dn/2,192
AI is a prefactor, and St is the Stokes number, defined193
as St = ρRv/ηg, where ηg = 1.983 · 10−5 Pa s is the194
air viscosity. When oblique collisions are considered, the195
impact velocity is modified by a sinα factor. Thus, the196
Stokes number becomes St = ρdnv sinα/(2ηg). Accord-197
ing to Li et al. [21], there is a critical value of the Stokes198
number that determines the transition from bouncing to199
merging. At low jet velocities, the shape of the jet is200
not cylindrical due to the reflected waves to the noz-201
zle. The velocity of the capillary waves is estimated as202
vc ≈ (σk/ρ)1/2, where k is the wavenumber and is of the203
order of 1/R. The ratio between the jet velocity and the204
capillary waves velocity leads to a second dimensionless205
number Γ, defined as Γ = v/vc = v(ρR/σ)

1/2, which206
controls the bouncing/merging transition at low jet ve-207
locities [21]. Therefore, the jet bouncing and coalescence208
regimes can be analyzed by means of the Stokes number209
St and the ratio between jet and capillary waves velocity210
Γ. Fig. 4 shows St as a function of Γ. Crosses correspond211
to coalescence, circles to bouncing, and crosses inside cir-212
cles to a metastable bouncing state like the one shown in213
Fig. 3. Jet bouncing was found only at Γ > 0.2 in [21].214
However, two of the observed bouncing regimes in our ex-215
periments took place at Γ < 0.2. Therefore, microgravity216
conditions seem to favour bouncing against coalescence.217
Bouncing is enhanced in microgravity since jets are not218
accelerated and hence the removal of air between them219
becomes more difficult.220

The transition from bouncing to coalescence can be221
analyzed in terms of the parameter K, defined as222

introduction of the dimensionless numbers Weα and Reα225
comes when considering oblique collisions, since the im-226
pact velocity becomes v sinα. Wadhwa et al. observed227
coalescence at K > Kcr and bouncing at K < Kcr, with228
Kcr = 6.1 [22]. Fig. 5 shows the behaviour of K as a229
function of α for the cases of jet bouncing and coalescence230
observed here, where a cross inside a circle corresponds231
to a metastable bouncing state. Our results show several232
cases of jet coalescence at K < 6.1 at α < 10o, which233
is a region not explored in [22]. In this region jets are234
quasi-parallel and small interfacial instabilities can gen-235
erate coalescence more easily than at large values of α.236
In fact, one would expect that in normal gravity condi-237
tions this effect is enhanced and that Kcr substantially238
decreases as α = 0o is approached.239

The frontal collision between two jets provides partic-240

ular features since the system is axisymmetric and the241
outcome of the collision is located in the injection axis.242
As a consequence, the resulting fluid body interacts with243
the incoming liquid streams, as opposed to the oblique244
jets case, in which the result of the collision moves away245
from the collision point. Fig. 6 shows the regimes ob-246
served in the opposed-jets configuration, with a separa-247
tion between nozzle tips of 6 cm. Fig. 6a shows the248
dripping regime that takes place at low We, in which249
surface tension dominates over fluid inertia and droplets250
grow remaining attached to the nozzles. In Figs. 6b to251
6d, We > Wecr and the jetting mode is attained. Fig.252
6b shows the dispersion of droplets generated from jet253
atomization occurring close to the nozzle. Droplets ap-254
proach each other at a relative velocity around 10 cm/s255
and bounce off since the time scale of draining the air256
film between the two interfaces is higher than the con-257
tact time between droplets. At higher jet velocities, the258
inertia of the colliding droplets generates strong pertur-259
bations of the air gap between liquid interfaces, forcing260
them to coalesce. In this case, a central droplet is formed261
and grows from coalescence with incoming droplets (Fig.262
6c). The jet breakup length increases with increasing263
flow rate. When Lb is larger than the distance from the264
nozzle tip to the colision point, jets coalesce before at-265
omization can take place, and a liquid bridge is formed266
(Fig. 6d). The interaction between jets creates a central267
liquid body that connects the two nozzles permanently.268
The shape of the liquid bridge highly depends on the flow269
rate. At low flow rates, the bridge shape oscillates be-270
tween oblate and prolate spheroids. At large flow rates,271
the central body becomes a steady liquid sheet.272

To characterize the conditions under which the ob-273
served regimes take place, a map in terms of the Weber274
number and the impact angle is proposed (Fig. 7). The275
regimes represented, ordered by increasing flow rate, are:276
dripping, droplet bouncing, droplet coalescence, jet co-277
alescence, jet bouncing, liquid chain, and liquid sheet.278
Some of the regimes, such as jet bouncing or liquid279
chains, occur only in configurations with 2α 6= 0, π rad.280
Jet coalescence is observed at α = 0 rad as a result of281
the soft merging mechanism.282

CONCLUSIONS283

In conclusion, our results significantly extend the un-284
derstanding of the behavior of liquid jets at low Weber285
numbers. We have analyzed the impingement of jets in286
microgravity conditions in a large range of impact angle287
including frontal collision, and observed several regimes.288
Some of the regimes take place at different parameters289
ranges that in normal gravity conditions, while others oc-290
cur only in microgravity. A map of the identified regimes291
have been proposed in terms of the Weber number and292
the impact angle.293
