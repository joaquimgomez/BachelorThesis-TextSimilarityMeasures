Abstract. The cytoskeleton of the organism Physarum polycephalum is a
prominent example of a complex active viscoelastic material wherein stresses
induce flows along the organism as a result of the action of molecular motors and
their regulation by calcium ions. Experiments in Physarum polycephalum have
revealed a reach variety of mechanochemical patterns including standing, traveling
and rotating waves that arise from instabilities of spatially homogeneous states
without gradients in stresses and resulting flows. Herein, we investigate simple
models where an active stress induced by molecular motors is coupled to a model
describing the passive viscoelastic properties of the cellular material. Specifically,
two models for viscoelastic fluids (Maxwell and Jeffrey model) and two models
for viscoelastic solids (Kelvin-Voigt and Standard model) are investigated. Our
focus is on the analysis of the conditions that cause destabilization of spatially
homogeneous states and the related onset of mechano-chemical waves and
patterns. We carry out linear stability analyses and numerical simulations in
one spatial dimension for different models. In general, sufficiently strong activity
leads to waves and patterns. The primary instability is stationary for all active
fluids considered, whereas all active solids have an oscillatory primary instability.
All instabilities found are of long-wavelength nature reflecting the conservation of
the total calcium concentration in the models studied.

Mechanochemical pattern formation 2

1. Introduction

The cytoplasm of the living cells is formed by filaments
consisting of chains of actin protein organized in
bundles by cross-linking proteins [1]. The continuous
polymerization and depolymerization of filaments and
the unbinding of cross-linkers may produce cytoplasmic
flows at large scales of time, which permits the
modeling of such flows in terms of active gel theories [2,
3, 4]. At small time scales, however, the cytoskeleton
is more rigid and behaves as an elastic solid [5].

The organism Physarum polycephalum has been
used as a model organism to study the filament
structure of the cytoskeleton [6, 7]. In particular,
the reorganization of the cytoplasm of Physarum in
small protoplasmic droplets has been used to study
the active properties of the cytoskeleton, because
mechanical deformation waves travel through the
droplet during such cellular reorganization [8, 9, 10,
11]. Other aspects of the spatiotemporal dynamics of
Physarum polycephalum such as percolation of small
plasmodia into a transport network [12] and the frontal
extension dynamics of a bigger cell [13] have been
explored experimentally recently. A current focus of
(mostly) experimental and theoretical studies is the
investigation of migrating plasmodia [14, 15, 16, 17].

Recently, two-phase models [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] of
the cytoplasm of protoplasmic droplets of Physarum
have appeared, that are composed of an active solid
cytoskeleton coupled to a passive viscous cytosol.
A reduction of detailed models of the cytoplasm
of Physarum [19, 20, 21] gives rise to a simple
and more generic model of mechanochemical pattern
formation in active viscoelastic cytoskeleton [23].
Since contraction and the subsequent deformations
in Physarum were correlated with low calcium
concentration [9], the cited models employ an
inhibitory regulator for the active stress in the
cytoskeleton. It was shown, that such a model
yields an oscillatory long-wavelength instability and
corresponding traveling and rotating waves. Earlier
on, an even simpler model for pattern formation in
active fluid was introduced by Bois et al. [24], that
assumes that the cytoskeleton is a simple viscous fluid,
wherein active stresses increases with the concentration
of molecular motors or an activating regulator. This
model was found to exhibit a stationary long-
wavelength instability and corresponding patterns.
The two latter models are at the starting point of our
studies.

The second model [24] is a one-phase active
fluid model of the cytoplasm that yields stationary
patterns and was motivated by observations in C.
Elegans cells [25]. In contrast, Radszuweit et al. [23]
proposed a two-phase active poroelastic model that
yields waves and was motivated by the observation

of deformation waves in Physarum [8]. This model
represents the cytoplasm as a two-phase material
consisting of a solid sponge-like cytoskeleton and a
viscous cytosolic liquid. Both cases are examples of
mechano-chemical pattern formation [26, 27], i.e. they
do not require chemical reaction-diffusion instabilities
to structure the interior of a cell. These models
assume that the passive stresses are supplemented
by an active stress caused by molecular motors that
depends on the concentration of the motors or on
regulating agents like calcium ions [28]. It is worth
mentioning that both models were extended to a
situation where the regulator was reacting with other
biochemical species. In other words, the simple
mechanochemical models were coupled to reaction-
diffusion equations, yielding patterns stemming from
short-wave length Turing-type instabilities. Bois et al.
showed already that the coupling of reaction-diffusion
equations to a mechanochemical model for an active
fluid enhances the tendency of a system for pattern
forming instabilities [24]. Alonso et al. observed a
similar trend for the coupling of the active poroelastic
equations to reaction-diffusion equations [21].

In the remainder we will, however, disregard the
effect of reaction-diffusion processes mechanochemical
pattern formation. Instead emphasis is on the effect
different possible models for the passive viscoelastic
properties of the active cytoplasm using the simple
model for an active fluid used in [24] as a starting
point. As in previous work [23], we keep the simple
expression for the active stress introduced there, but
vary the assumptions regarding the passive material
properties that enter the passive stress contribution.
For simplicity, we confine our study to models based
on linear elasticity. Our studies addresses both
viscoelastic active fluids (described by the Maxwell
resp. Jeffreys model) as well as viscoelastic active
solids (described by the Kelvin-Voigt resp. Standard
model). The key goal of this work is to investigate the
influence of these passive stresses on pattern formation
for parameters that roughly match the condition in the
cytoplasm of Physarum and, in general, of living cells.

Both, active fluid and solid model for the cell,
have been extensively employed in the study of the
viscoelastic properties of the cytoskeleton [5] and of
the rheology of different types of living cells [1].
Cell rheology [29, 30] is the field in which the
interaction between the viscoelastic properties and the
mechanical response of living cells [31] are studied.
A typical assumption is that the cell material can
have both solid and fluid characteristics. Although
the mechanics of typical eukaryotic cells were found
to be solid only at time scales shorter than 1 second
[32] and to exhibit fluid characteristics at longer
time scales [33], viscoelastic solid models have been



Mechanochemical pattern formation 3

successfully employed for reproducing measurements
of viscoelastic properties of living cells [34]. The
combination of a viscoelastic approach with active
stress can produce pattern formation in living cells,
and in particular mechanochemical waves, which can
produce deformation patterns in protoplasmic droplets
of Physarum polycephalum [8, 21]. More examples are
also possible, for instance cortical oscillations are able
to move periodically the nucleus in fibroblasts [35, 36]
or to produce actin pattern formation in epithelial cells
in Drosophila [37].

This manuscript is organized as follows: in
the next section, we present the basic ingredients
of a simple one-phase description of the active
cytoskeleton, and discuss the inclusion of active stress
and viscoelastic properties into the model. In section
3 we carry out a linear stability analysis for four
different models of active viscoelastic solids (Kelvin-
Voigt and standard model) and active viscoelastic
fluids (Maxwell and Jeffrey model) and identify
parameter regions where spatially homogeneous steady
states are unstable indicating pattern formations. We
also address the non-linear dynamics of the patterns
and waves emerging in the standard and Jeffrey models
by numerical simulations. In section 4, a comparison
of numerically simulated patterns in one model with
linear elasticity (standard model) to a description
based on nonlinear elasticity is presented. Finally,
section 5 provides a short summary and we discuss the
results.

2. Model

The actomyosin cytoskeleton has been modelled at the
mesoscopic scale as an active gel [2] in particular at the
cellular cortex [24], the region of the cytoskeleton close
to the membrane. The actomyosin network is modelled
by a single gel phase, which deforms due to the active
stress of the myosin.

2.1. Active stress

The total stress in the cytoskeleton σ is the sum of
the active tension T (c) and the viscoelastic stress σve
of the network, i.e. σ = T (c) + σve. The viscoelastic
properties of the cytoskeleton characterize the response
of the cell to the deformations, see Fig.(1) for a sketch,
and Sec. (2.2) for more details. Neglecting inertial
forces, the force balance obtained from such a total
stress reads:

∂xσve + ∂xT (c)− γv = 0, (1)

where γ is the friction coefficient and describes e.g. the
friction that occurs if the cytoskeleton (actin cortex)
moves relative to the membrane. The dimensionless,
scaled concentration, c, is assumed to determine

the strength of the active tension. The quantity c
represents either the concentration of molecular motors
(direct regulation of active tension), see e.g. [24],
or of a biochemical species that controls the motor
activity (indirect regulation of active tension), see e. g.
[23]. Therefore, the active stress T (c) and the resulting
deformation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton depends on
the local concentration c as

T (c) = T0 + ξ
c

Kc + c
, (2)

where T0 is the active tension due to other active
sources. The sign of ξ can be positive or negative
depending on whether the concentration c activates
[24] or inhibits [23] the active tension, respectively.
The active tension may also be affected by the
concentrations of two different competing species, as
was assumed in a recent extended model for an active
cellular fluid [38]. Apart from the action of motor-
regulating proteins, calcium ions are known to inhibit
the action of myosin motors in Physarum [28], while
they activate myosin in muscle cells [39].

Throughout this paper, we are considering the cell
material as a single phase fluid or solid. Therefore,
the velocity (v) indicates the deformation (u) of the
cytoskeleton. Both quantities are related by the simple
relation ∂tu = v. This relation is quite similar to
the incompressibility condition in two-phase models
that relates the motion of the solid network of the
cytoskeleton with the velocity of the cytosol. The
only difference lies in the sign of the term with
the active stress T (c), which is negative instead of
positive, for details see [23]. While an active fluid is
appropriately described by the single-phase approach,
an active solid could be coupled to a passive fluid in
which the regulator of the active tension is transported
as proposed in [23]. Such a two-phase poroelastic
description leads, however, to an analogous description
as the one phase model of an active solid presented
here. In particular, the two-phase poroelastic model
has exactly the same instabilities and dynamical
behavior as the active solid model.

Biochemical macromolecules diffuse inside of the
cell. The diffusion coefficient for proteins inside living
cells depends on several factors, although the most
relevant is their weight [40]. A characteristic value
for the diffusion of a protein inside the cytoplasm is
around D = 10 µm2 /s. For smaller molecules, for
example calcium, this coefficient is typically larger.

On the other hand, inside the cell active transport
occurs due to the generation of flows of the cytoplasm.
Such cytoplasmic streaming can organize and move
different species coherently [41].

The concentration of such a biochemical compo-
nent with passive, i.e. diffusive, and active, i.e. advec-
tion, transport follows a diffusion-advection equation.

2.2. Viscoelasticity

The response of a cell to a deformation is not unique
and depends on the type of the cell or on the time
scale and amplitude of the perturbation. For certain
types of cells this response is elastic and they behave as
solids, i.e. after an initial perturbation the cell recovers
the original shape, see Fig.1(a). However, under other
conditions the response is viscous and the cell behaves
as a fluid, i.e. the applied stress deforms the cell shape
plastically and the deformation remains, see Fig.1(b).
The stress (σ) is related with the local force per unit
of area and is usually given in the unit of kilopascal.
The strain (ǫ) is the deformation (u) per unit of length
of the material. It is a non-dimensional quantity and
corresponds in continuum mechanics to the spatial
derivative of the deformation: ǫ = ∂u/∂x. The strain
is limited therefore to ǫ < 1. Furthermore, the models
discussed below will all be based on linear elasticity
and they are typically valid for small strain (ǫ ≪
1). Traditional viscoelastic models are represented by
an equivalent circuit composed of a small number of
springs and dashpots that may either exhibit solid- or
fluid-like elastic responses. The term σve in Eq.(1)
is computed from these elements, see e.g. [42]. It is
important to note that those springs and dashpots do

not have a direct physical interpretation. Hence, the
resulting models are phenomenological. For example
the elastic and viscous responses shown in Fig.1(a) and
(b), may be modelled in their simplest form as a spring,
see Fig. 2(a), which returns the border of the cell to the
original position and a dashpot, see Fig. 2(b), which
deforms and adapts to the new position.

Figure 2. Different representations of the viscoelastic models in
terms of springs and dashpots for viscoelastic solids and fluids.

Typically simple viscoelastic models used to
describe cellular dynamics combine both types of
responses (the viscous dashpot and the elastic spring).
For a selection of simple viscoelastic models that we
will analyse in the remainder of this paper see Fig.2.
We differentiate between two basic types of models
depending on the final response:

• Viscoelastic solids: after the initial stress the
cell recovers its original shape. There is single
equilibrium value of the strain and the spring
recovers the original value after the retreat of the
external stress, see examples of the stress-strain
relations in Fig.3(a,c,e).

• Viscoelastic fluid: the stress produces a permanent
deformation. The dashpot does not have an
unique equilibrium strain, see examples of the
stress-strain relations in Fig.3(b,d,f).

With the combination of springs and dashpots
either in parallel of in series, we can recover a spectrum
of possible responses. In Fig.3 we show the responses
of the viscoelastic models shown in Fig.2 to a constant
external stress that is applied for 10 seconds. For an
elastic response, the strain basically follows the applied
stress and relaxes back zero when the stress disappears.
For a viscous model, the strain continuously increases
till the stress is removed.

The Kelvin-Voigt and the Maxwell models are
the two simplest models of viscoelasticity. While the

Figure 3. Comparison among the different viscoelastic models
of the response, i.e. induced strain, to an external stress. The
curves can be derived from expressions obtained in Appendix B
Parameter values employed: σ0 = 1kPa, E = 5 kPa, η = 25 kPa
s, and for the last cases: E1 = E2 = E/2 and η1 = η2 = η/2.

Kelvin-Voigt model represents a solid, see Fig.2, and
the strain appears to saturate after a certain time to
a particular value (here to ǫ = 0.2 at 10 seconds in
Fig.3), the Maxwell model represents a fluid, see Fig.2,
and the strain continuously grows for constant stress,
see Fig.3. Both models has been used frequently in
generic models of viscoelastic active gels.

The Standard and the Jeffrey models of viscoelas-
ticity combine three elements, see Fig.2, to obtain more
complex responses, see Fig.3. For a longer review on
linear viscoelastic models we refer to [42].

2.3. Parameter values

Living cells are very heterogeneous and the values of
mechanical parameters strongly differs even inside of
the same cell at the same time [43]. Measurements
of viscoelastic parameters can be done by magnetic
and optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, particle
tracking and other techniques, see [29] for more
detailed list and references.

Even a single interpretation of a single experiment
is complicated, because it is often not easy to separate
the properties of the membrane, from the ones of

the cytoskeleton or the cytosol with knowing only
the overall viscoelastic properties of a cell measured
in experiments. Estimates of concrete values are
nevertheless obtained from experimental data and
differ from cell to cell. As an example we give several
characteristic values in Table 1. Elastic moduli of cells
typically vary from 1 kPa to almost 100 kPa. Similar
variations are obtained in the measurements of the
viscosity of the cytoskeleton network. The ratio of
both parameters define the viscoelastic relaxation time
τ = η/E which can vary over up to three orders of
magnitude.

This large variation makes the choice of character-
istic values in models difficult. Previous generic mod-
els based on active gels for the actomyosin cytoskele-
ton employed typical values of the elastic modulus of
a few kilopascals, for example E = 1 − 10 kPa [2]
and viscoelastic relaxation times of τ = 100 s, which,
by using τ = η/E, corresponds to viscosities around
η = 100−1000 kPa s [2]. We have used direct measure-
ments of the parameters for actomyosin cortex in one-
cell-stage of C. elegans embrio [48] as a first estimate
to choose characteristic values for the elastic modulus
and the viscosity, see Table 2; we are, nevertherless,
vary systematically the values of these parameters in
our study. From the similar works we have extracted
an estimate for the the hydrodynamic length ℓ and
the value of the friction coefficient, which appears in
Eq.(1). The parameter values employed here, see Ta-
ble 2, are in agreement with other theoretical studies,

3. Pattern formation in active viscoelastic

models

As a starting point for the analysis, we recall the
results on one phase model of an active fluid originally
proposed for the actomyosin cortex [24]. Then we
introduce some classical models of linear viscoelasticity
of fluids and solids. These models have been
extensively applied to the modeling of the viscoelastic
properties of living cells under active and passive
conditions, see a collection of applications in Tab.3.
First, we perform the linear stability analysis of the
models and second we perform numerical simulations
of the all nonlinear model for some selected cases for
two more complex models of viscoelasticity.

3.1. Linear stability analysis

A particular homogeneous steady state is composed by
the concentration c = c0 and the velocity v = v0 = 0.
To study the stability of this steady state we perform
a linear stability analysis, by the introduction of a
spatio-temporal perturbation c = c0 + δce

λt+ikx and
v = v0 + δve

λt+ikx and evaluate if the perturbation
grows (λ > 0) or decreases (λ < 0) with time. The
variable λ is the growing rate and indicates the stability
of the solutions to small perturbations. Such variable
depends on the parameters of the model and on the
wave number k, see Fig.4 for a collection of different
types of dependences on k.

F = P/Pc. For F > 1 the solution is then unstable
for a characteristic wavelength. If one checks the two
eigenvalues corresponding to Eq.(7) the term 1 + ℓ2k2

ensures negative eigenvalues for sufficiently large values
of k. It means that in case of unstable eigenvalues
there is always some stable modes and the system is
stable to perturbations at small spatial scale. The
corresponding instability curve is plotted in Fig.4(d)
and corresponds to a long wave instability with real
eigenmodes. The phase diagram is plotted in Fig.5(a).
For F > 1 the solution is unstable and all the
modes plotted in Fig.5(a) are unstable giving rise to
a long wave instability, see Fig.4(d). For F < 1
the homogeneous solution is stable, see Fig.4(a). The
parameter Pc depends on c0 and the corresponding
value of P needed to destabilize the homogeneous
solution also changes, see Fig.5(a). For the special
case η = 0, i. e. for an active inviscid fluid, there
is a competition between the advection produced by
the active force, which controls the velocity of the



Mechanochemical pattern formation 8

fluid, see Eq.(1), and the diffusion, see both terms in
Eq.(3). Such a competition has been used to study
cytoplasmic streaming [41, 50] where the otherwise
unphysical solutions are stabilized by the coupling to
a second viscous phase.

If we apply such an approach to our active gel
model we obtain the next set of equations:

∂tc = − ∂x(vc) +D∂
2
xc, (8)

0 = ∂xT − γv;

where the velocity depends only on the active tension.
It has the same homogeneous solution as in the
previous case. The linear stability analysis of such
solution produces the eigenvalue:

λ = −Dk2 (1− F ) (9)

For F > 1 the solution is unstable and all the modes
plotted in Fig.5(b) are unstable giving rise to an
unphysical situation. For F < 1 the homogeneous
solution is stable. The phase diagram is the same as
that the active fluid case discussed above, although the
real long wave instability is converted to an unstable
dispersion curve.

3.1.2. Maxwell model The Maxwell models has been
employed in the derivation of the hydrodynamic
equations of an active polar gel [61] where the
flow velocity of the cytoskeleton is coupled with the
asymmetric formation of a polar cytoskeleton, see for
example [61, 2, 3, 4, 55]. Here we consider an isotropic
nonpolar model, for which the Maxwell model is used
in a viscoelastic isotropic active fluid to determine the
viscoelastic properties and active stress responses in
C. elegans and Zebrafish embryos [48]. The Maxwell
model has been previously considered in the extension
of a one-phase model to a two-phase model [54], where
the cytoskeleton (active polar gel) and the cytosol
(passive fluid) are described separately.

Different types of pattern formation are achieved
by taking into consideration such passive viscoelastic
response to active stresses. On the other hand, the
response to external strains of an active viscoelastic
model are similar to the passive Maxwell viscoelastic
model [56].

The relation between the viscoelastic stress and
the velocity of the fluid is in this case:

(1 + τ∂t)∂xσve = η∂
2
xv, (10)

where τ = η/E is the viscoelastic relaxation time. The
resulting equations of this viscoelastic model are:

∂tc = − ∂x(vc) +D∂
2
xc, (11)

τγ∂tv = η∂
2
xv + ∂xT − γv + τ∂t∂xT ;

which yields the following characteristic equation for
the eigenvalues:

This relation can give rise to three types of dispersion
relations apart from the trivial stable case. As
in the viscous active fluid it may produce a long
wave instability with a characteristic wavelength,
see Fig.4(d), or yield dispersion curves where the
large wavenumber perturbation are all unstable
as in Fig.4(b,c). The critical mechanochemical
coupling strength, ξc can be calculated analytically by
considering the small k limit of Eq. (12). We find

ξc(E) = EγPc, (13)

which is equivalent to the condition 1 − F = 0 and
shows that the onset of mechanochemical instability is
not dependent on the elastic modulus E. Just above
onset the eigenvalues are real for all k, oscillatory
eigenvalues appear for small E.

It is also instructive to look at the large k limit
of Eq. (12). Doing this, we can derive a condition
where the dispersion curve undergoes a transition from
a physically reasonable dispersion curve like in Fig. 4
(d) to a dispersion curve with diverging positive real
parts as in Fig. 4 (c). It reads (l2/τ + D(1 − F ))2 <
(4Dl/τ). The numerically computed phase diagram
for a particular value of E is shown in Fig.5(c) for
comparison with more simple models of active fluid
and confirms the analytical findings.

3.1.3. Kelvin-Voigt model The Kelvin-Voigt model
has been employed for the elaboration of a one-
phase model of the cytoplasm considering the density
changes of F-actin and the concentrations of myosin
free and attached to the filaments of actin [49]. A
two-component model consisting of an elastic network
coupled frictionally to a permeating fluid is the basis
of the two-phase model of the cytoplasm. Generic
models of the solid actomyosin cytoskeleton and the
fluid cytosol have been studied using a Kelvin-Voigt
model for the passive viscoelasticity [59, 23]. The
modification of the strain-stress relation of the Kelvin-
Voigt model under active cytoskeleton was considered
in [59]. Such descriptions have been employed for the
modeling of two cell types: modeling of muscle cells
where the sarcomere chain can be described as a one
dimensional elastic system in terms of a displacement
field [59, 57] leading to oscillatory instabilities; and
modeling of Physarum microplasmodia where the high
concentration of actin produces elastic responses of the
cytoplasm [21, 20].

The actin cytoskeleton of certain cells often
condenses into stress fibers formed by filament bundles
contracted by myosin motors. The Kelvin-Voigt model



Mechanochemical pattern formation 9

has been also utilized for the experimental study of
the elastic properties of fiber bundles inside cells under
stress to fit the elongation and the response of the
cells after bundle incision [47]. Different models of
active viscoelastic bundles were developed to explain
traveling or standing filament density waves [60].

The viscoelastic stress in terms of the deformation
and the velocity of the gel is:

∂xσve = E∂
2
xu+ η∂

2
xv, (14)

where we note again that v = ∂u/∂t. The equations of
the model are:

∂tc = − ∂x(vc) +D∂
2
xc, (15)

0 = η∂2xv + E∂
2
xu+ ∂xT − γv,

∂tu = v;

The corresponding characteristic equation for the
eigenvalues describing perturbations of the homoge-
neous steady with u = v = 0 and c = c0 reads

λ2 + λDk2
(

+D2k4
M

= 0; (16)

where we have defined the nondimensional parameter
M = E/(Dγ). The corresponding phase diagram
is shown in Fig.6(a), indicating that the spatially
uniform steady state undergoes an oscillatory long
wave instability. The critical mechanochemical
coupling strength, ξc can be calculated analytically by
considering the small k limit. We find

ξc(E) = (E +Dγ)Pc (17)

which is equivalent to the condition F − M =
E and shows that the critical coupling ξc for the
mechanochemical instability is linearly dependent on
the elastic modulus E. The instability is also found to
be of oscillatory nature with a frequency (expressed
by the imaginary part of the critical eigenvalue) of
ω = (D2k4M)1/2. If the large k limit of Eq. (16)
is considered, one finds that the eigenvalues for large
wavenumbers k stay always negative and the dispersion
curve of the Kelvin-Voigt is hence always either of the
type displayed in Fig. 4(e) or of the type shown in Fig.
4(f).

While for M = 0 all eigenvalues are real,
see Fig.4(d), and for large M all the eigenvalues
corresponding to unstable modes are complex, see
Fig.4(f), for intermediate values of M the most
unstable mode is real, however there is still a range of
wavenumbers with unstable complex eigenvalues, see
Fig.4(e). The size of this range decreases with M , and
disappears for M = 0.

In the limit η = 0 we obtain an active elastic solid
model. The cytoskeleton network looks very stable
and is elastic at short times. This allows for the
construction of models of active elastic solids for the
actomyosin network [51, 53] to evaluate the response

elastic network is embedded in a permeating viscous
fluid, with elastic response at long times and liquid-like
dissipation at short times [52] giving rise to oscillations
similar to the behavior of the full Kelvin-voigt model.

with the same homogeneous solution as in the previous
cases. The eigenvalues fulfill the next condition from
the linear stability analysis:

The corresponding phase diagram of the instabilities
obtained from the linear stability analysis is shown in
Fig.6(b). The phase diagram is similar to the phase
diagram for the non-zero value of η, but with unstable
modes. The viscous term η stabilizes the unstable
modes, compare both diagrams Fig.6(a,b), by the
introduction of the terms 1 + ℓ2k2 in Eq.(16). Models
with active elastic stress use permeating viscous fluids
to account for the same effect [53, 52]. Similarly, the
active viscous fluid model stabilizes the modes of the
active inviscid fluid model, see Fig5(a,b).

4. More complex viscoelastic active matter

models

4.0.1. Standard model The Kelvin-Voigt and the
Maxwell models for viscoelasticity have only a small
number of control parameters and are sometimes not
suitable to fit experimental data. One can incorporate
new dashpots and springs to the previous simple
models to obtain more control parameters and different
responses of the model for the cell material, see
Fig.3. For the standard model, a spring in series
with the dashpot is added to the equivalent circuit
of the Kelvin-Voigt model. This model was employed
to directly fit experiments with living cells in the
measurement of viscoelastic properties by magnetic
bead microrheometry [34] and other experimental
techniques [45]. The relation between the viscoelastic
stress and the deformation and velocity of the fluid is:

(1 + τ∂t)∂xσve = η∂
2
xv + E2τ∂

2
xv + E2∂

2
xu (21)

where τ = η/E1 is the relaxation time associated to the

and D = 10 µm2/s. The color code is the same as for the
different type of dispersion relations in Fig.4.

where we define M = E2/(Dγ) using the iso-
lated spring. The critical mechanochemical coupling
strength ξc can be calculated analytically by consider-
ing the small k limit. We recover the result obtained
in Eq. (17) for the Kelvin-Voigt model above, which
is equivalent to the condition F − M = E, i.e. the
critical coupling ξc for the mechanochemical instability
is linearly dependent on the elastic modulus E. The
instability is again found to be of oscillatory nature
with a frequency (expressed by the imaginary part of
the critical eigenvalue) of ω = (D2k4M)1/2. From the
numerically determined phase diagram, see Fig.7, one
finds, however, that the real part of the eigenvalues can
diverge in the large k limit at small values of E2 for
small choices of E1 (the dispersion curves are then of
the type displayed in Fig. 4(b,c) ). In the limit τ → 0
(keeping η finite) one recovers Eq.(16) and therefore
the Kelvin-Voigt limit. For τ → ∞ one simply obtains
Eq.(20) corresponding to the purely elastic limit.

4.0.2. Jeffrey model The Jeffrey model of viscoelas-
ticity incorporates an additional dashpot in parallel
to the equivalent circuit used to derive the Maxwell
model. It therefore represents a viscoelastic fluid in
contrast to the standard model, which describes vis-
coelastic solid. This stress-strain relation of the Jef-
frey model was employed for the study of rheology of
two cell lines of fibroblasts subjected to a step stress
to examine their mechanical response on different time
scales [33].

The relation between the viscoelastic stress and
the deformation and velocity of the fluid is for this
case:

where ℓ22 = η2/γ is a second hydrodynamic length scale
and ℓ2 = η1/γ. For ℓ2 = 0 one recovers the Maxwell
limit of Eq.(12), see in figure 8 the phase diagrams for
different values of η2. The critical mechanochemical
coupling strength, ξc of the Jeffrey model can as above
be calculated analytically by considering the small k
limit. We find the same result as in Eq. (13), which
is equivalent to the condition 1 − F = 0 and shows
that the onset of mechanochemical instability is not
dependent on the elastic modulus E. Just above onset
the eigenvalues are real for all k, oscillatory eigenvalues
appear for small values of the elastic modulus E. The
large k limit yields that the eigenvalues there always
have negative real parts.

4.1. Numerical Simulations

In order to obtain information about solutions beyond
small perturbation around the steady state, we
supplement the linear stability analysis by numerical
simulations in one spatial dimension. For the details on
the methods employed in the simulations see Appendix
C.

4.1.1. Standard and Jeffrey models In this section we
will only consider the Standard and the Jeffrey model.

Pattern formation in the Kelvin-Voigt model has previ-
ously been studied already in detail by numerical sim-
ulations in [19]. For both models under consideration
here, we present a few representative cases for different
parameter values that exhibit mechanochemical insta-
bilities. As standard parameters we fix ℓ = 10 µm,
c0 = 1, D = 10 µm

2/s, η = η1 = 25 kPa s, and
ξ = 60 kPa, while the remaining values are varied. Pe-
riodic boundary conditions are used for all variables.
For the initial regulator concentration a small random
perturbation χ is added to the homogeneous distribu-
tion: c(x, t = 0) = c0+χ(x). The remaining quantities
are set to zero.

Fig. 9 shows space-time plots for simulations of
the viscoelastic Standard model with a constitutive law
given by eq. (21). We limit the presentation of the spa-
tiotemporal dynamics to one variable, the velocity v,
since the other fields closely follow its dynamics and
do not provide any novel (qualitative) information. In
agreement with phase diagram in Fig. 7 (b), waves
emerge by a (purely complex) instability. Close to
the onset of instability (c) a small-amplitude standing-
wave pattern persists. Further from this onset (a,b)
there is a transient behavior until a stable wave pattern
evolved. The transient pattern in particular includes a
wave-coarsening process.

The results for the Jeffrey model (see eq. (24)) are
presented in Fig. 10 for parameters belonging to the
phase diagram in Fig. 8 (b). For an elastic modulus
approaching to infinity the dynamics should converge
to the purely viscous model. This is illustrated for a
large value of E in Fig. 10 (a) where the expected
coarsening behavior is found. However, due to its
finite value the remaining pulse travels slowly. When
the parameters enter the region of linear complex
eigenvalues the transient coarsening behavior changes,
as shown in (b), by periodic modulations. However, the
final state remains a traveling-pulse solution. For even
lower elastic modulus E multiple pulses may co-exist
in a stable final state Fig. 10(c).

4.1.2. Nonlinear viscoelastic material Using linear
viscoelastic constitutive laws as presented in the
previous sections situations may occur, in which non-
trivial velocity profiles remain static or move very
slow. Consequently, deformations f = 1 + ∂xu grow
in an unphysical manner or even become negative. To
avoid this problem we introduce a nonlinear elastic
constitutive law without changing the linear dispersion
relations. A widely used hyperelastic model is the
incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material. Since we
consider one dimension we limit us to the uni-axial

model with η2 = 1 kPas and E = 25 kPa (τ = 1 s) (a), E = 7.75

case with stress:

σMR(f) = (C1 + C2/f)(f − 1/f
2) (27)

f = 1 + ∂xu.

From this one can conclude that the linear elastic
modulus is E = 3(C1 + C2). It is convenient to
introduce C1,2 =

(1 ± β), where β affects only

the nonlinear response. For the viscoelastic Standard
model we get:

(1 + τ∂t)σve = (η + τσ

MR)∂xv + σMR. (28)

However, for the active fluid models (Maxwell and Jef-
frey) this modification is not applicable. An incom-
pressibility constraint ∇·v = 0, where v is now a two-
or three dimensional vector field is necessary in this
case. In one dimension this constraint leads to trivial
solutions. Therefore, we restrict the simulations to the
Standard model.

In order to compare the dynamics between the
linear and nonlinear case, in Fig. 11 (a,b) space-time
plots with the same parameters as in Fig. 9 (a,b)
are shown. The final states for the nonlinear material
both show single traveling pulses. In sub-figure (c)
the spatial profiles of this pulses are depicted. A
direct comparison between the profiles of the linear and
nonlinear constitutive law, see Fig. 11 (d) illustrates
that the nonlinearity prevents deformations to become
unphysical (f ≤ 0).

5. Summary and discussion

In this paper, we have investigated the influence of the
passive material properties on the pattern formation
properties of active viscoelastic fluids and solids. In
general, sufficiently strong activity destabilizes the
homogeneous steady states and leads to waves and
patterns independent of the passive viscoelastic model

chosen. The primary instability was found to be
stationary for all active fluids considered, whereas
all active solids exhibited on oscillatory primary
instability. Since the concentration of the species
regulating the active tension (i.e.concentration of
molecular motors such as myosin or motor-regulating
protein resp. motor-regulating ions such as calcium)
, was assumed to be conserved in the system, all
instabilities found are of long-wavelength nature. In a
first step, we analysed the linear stability of the steady
state with a spatially homogeneous concentration of
motors or regulator species and zero fluid motion
resp. time-independent deformation. Some of
the models studied have the unphysical property of
unstable eigenvalues in the large wave number limit,
in particular the elastic solid model, the zero-viscosity
limit of the simple active fluid model for all parameters
as well as the Maxwell and Standard models for a
substantial range of parameters. In contrast, the
viscous active fluid model, the Jeffreys model for
a viscoelastic fluids and the Kelvin-Voigt model for
active solids have only negative eigenvalues in the large
k limit. This may be due to the fact that the isolated
viscous dashpot added in parallel to elements with
elastic springs in the equivalent circuits of Figure 2
provides a sufficiently large damping of perturbations
for large wavenumbers in the full parameter range of
the Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell models. For two of



Mechanochemical pattern formation 13

models that have not been investigated before, namely
the Jeffreys and standard models, we performed
numerical simulations of the full nonlinear evolution
equations. In general, the predictions of the linear
stability were confirmed in these simulations.

In two-phase models of the cytoplasm suggested
to model the dynamics of Physarum polycephalum the
dynamics of the fluid viscous cytosol is taken into
account in addition to the dynamics of the active solid
viscoelastic cytoskeleton described by a Kelvin-Voigt
model [20, 21, 23]. The resulting model equations
are, however, apart from the sign of the active stress
identical to the one-phase Kelvin-Voigt model given
above and therefore, present, the best choice for
modeling Physarum as an active solid.

Our study was restricted to one spatial dimension,
but the instabilities found carry over also to the
analogous two-dimensional equations as was already
shown for the Kelvin-Voigt two-phase model of
Physarum. Furthermore, only models of linear
viscoelastic elasticity which are good approximations
near the onset of instabilities and as long as
deformations are small. We have obtained explicit
expressions of the growth rates from the linear stability
analysis as well as for the onset of instabilities. Some of
the results were verified also in numerical simulations
of the full nonlinear dynamics of two selected models.
The springs and dashpots employed for the modeling
of the viscoelastic properties do not correspond to
any microscopic dynamics of molecules in living
cells. They represent instead a phenomenological
macroscopic approach. Other phenomenological
models utilize computational tensegrity and are based
in the description of prestresses of the interconnected
filament structure, producing better descriptions for
dynamical rheology of living cells [62]. Again another
class of models start from the microscopic structure of
the cytoskeleton [1, 29].

In summary, the motivation of this study was
in part taken from results of the modeling the
dynamics of the cytoplasm of Physarum, which
employed a two-phase description coupling an active
viscoelastic solid described by the Kelvin-Voigt model
coupled to a simple passive, viscous liquid [19].
Here, specifically, we have performed a study of
the influence of the viscoelastic properties of living
cells by considering a number of simple models
describing active solids and active fluids. In particular,
we showed that all active fluid models exhibit a
stationary long-wavelength instability with purely real
eigenvalues, whereas all active solids models show
an oscillatory long-wavelength instability involving
complex eigenvalues with positive real parts. The
threshold of the instability depends on the elastic
modulus for all active solid models, while active

fluid models display a constant threshold independent
of the elastic modulus. For qualitative modelling
of mechanochemical patterns, the main decision is
clearly the one between active solids and active fluids.
Among the considered solid models the Kelvin-Voigt
model and among the fluid models studied the Jeffrey
model were the best choices with respect to avoiding
unstable modes with arbitrary large wavenumber in
the whole parameter space. The Maxwell model and
the standard model, in contrast, are only suitable
to describe the behavior near the onset of the
mechanochemical instability. Since all models studied
are assuming linear elasticity, they should in any case
not used in situations far away from onset where
strong deformations occur. We demonstrated for
an example in numerical simulations that in such
situations nonlinear elasticity model are more suitable
and will give results that are quite different from the
ones found with linear elasticity. If experimental data
of the viscoelastic response of the cell material that
should be modelled are available, one may choose
the model that gives the best fit to the data. The
main finding reported above was that apart from
the basic distinction if the cytoplasm responds as a
fluid or a solid that the details of the material will
not affect the potential for mechanochemical pattern
formation. All cases are examples of mechano-chemical
pattern formation [26, 27], i.e. they do not require
chemical reaction-diffusion instabilities to structure
the interior of a cell and the biochemical species
regulating the active tension - either molecular motors
or proteins resp. ions up- or downregulating the motor
activity - are not undergoing chemical transformation
or interactions. In typical biological situations,
this picture is largely oversimplified. Instead often
reaction-diffusion processes contribute substantially to
formation of waves and patterns inside cells [63].
In other words, the simple mechanochemical models
are usually coupled to reaction-diffusion equations,
yielding patterns stemming from short-wave length
Turing-type instabilities instead of the long-wavelength
instabilities found for all models here. Bois et
al. showed already that the coupling of reaction-
diffusion equations to a mechanochemical model for
an active fluid enhances the tendency of a system
for pattern forming instabilities [24]. Alonso et
al. observed a similar trend for the coupling of
the active poroelastic equations to reaction-diffusion
equations [21]. Radszuweit et al. [20] showed that
the whole variety of deformations pattern observed
in experiments with plasmodial droplets of Physarum
polycephalum reported in [8, 9, 10, 11] require also an
extension of the active poroelastic model by reaction-
diffusion equations describing the regulation of calcium
ions.

Appendix A. List and meaning of parameters

An complete list with the parameters employed in the
manuscript is shown in tab.A1, together with a short
explanation of the meaning of the parameter and the
analytical expression if is necessary.

Appendix B. Strain-stress relations

Next we list the relation between the applied stress
and the corresponding strain obtained from the spring
and dashpots models shown in Fig.2 and used for the
calculations shown in Fig.3. Note that the total stress
in two parallel elements is the sum of both stresses;
and the strain of two elements in serie is the sum of
both strains.

• The elastic model is based in a linear relation
between the stress and the strain σ = Eǫ and
therefore:

Appendix C. Numerical methods

A staggered Finite Volume and Finite Difference
scheme for discretization in space is used. If n is the
spatial index, then concentration values cn are located
at position xn, while velocity vn+ 1

, stress σn+ 1
2

and

displacement un+ 1
2

are located at xn+ 1
2

= xn+∆x/2 on
an equidistant grid. For interpolation of the advective
flux j = vc at nodes n+ 1

2
the upwind scheme is applied.

For time discretization of eq. (3) and the stress-strain
relation we chose the implicit Euler scheme to improve
numerical stability. By posterior check of the simu-
lation results we ensure that the associated numerical
diffusion coefficient Dnum ≈ v∆x/2 is much smaller
than the regulator diffusion D. In the presented cases
we set the domain length to L = 200 µm and the the
space step to ∆x = 0.1 µm. The time-step size ∆t
varies from 0.25 s−0.4 s since it influences numerical
stability. In order to solve the nonlinear system oc-
curring in each time step we make use of a staggered
equation scheme and iterate until convergence within
some tolerance. The software package UMFPACK [64]
provides us with a reliable solver for systems of linear
equations.
