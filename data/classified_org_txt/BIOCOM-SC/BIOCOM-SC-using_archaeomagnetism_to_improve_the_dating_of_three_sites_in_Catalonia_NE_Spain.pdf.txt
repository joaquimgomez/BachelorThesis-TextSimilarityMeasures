ABSTRACT 19 

Archaeomagnetic dating for four archaeological structures has been attempted in 20 

Catalonia (NE Spain) using magnetic inclination and declination values from three 21 

reference curves: the Iberian SVC and two curves computed using the regional 22 

SCHA.DIF.3k model and the global SHA.DIF.14k. The dating results have been used to 23 

add to the dating discussion for the three archaeological sites, which are from three very 24 

different periods: Roman, Medieval and modern. 25 

Besides, some considerations on the usefulness of the three reference curves and the 26 

corresponding geomagnetic models have been done. The last firing of a Roman limekiln 27 

near Tarragona occurred during the 1
st
 century BC according to the Iberian SVC and 28 

during the 1
st
 century AD according to the archaeomagnetic models, i. e. closer to the 29 

chronology of the kiln infillings (2
nd

-3
rd

 centuries AD). All three reference curves date 30 

successfully two structures from an archaeological site north to Barcelona within the 31 

10
th

-11
th

 century AD. The obtained ages match with the determined radiocarbon ages. 32 

Dating a modern limekiln near Girona, with a presumed age of more than 200 years 33 

produced an inconsistent age when using the Iberian SVC but plausible ages within the 34 

17
th

-18
th

 centuries AD using the archaeomagnetic models. This suggests that the Iberian 35 

SVC has been superseded by the regional SCHA.DIF.3k and the global SHA.DIF.14k 36 

model which exhibit excellent dating capability. Older archaeological sites, including 37 

prehistoric sites, should be investigated to fully exploit and check the possibilities of the 38 

new SHA.DIF.14k archaeomagnetic model. 39

1 INTRODUCTION 42 

Archaeomagnetic dating is an archaeometric technique that uses the Earth’s magnetic 43 

field variations to estimate the age of materials from an archaeological site that were 44 

subjected to high temperatures (baked clays, kiln walls, burn pits, etc.). In this technique 45 

the same principles and equipment as in palaeomagnetic studies are used. A natural 46 

thermomagnetic remanence (NRM) is adquired by materials containing magnetic 47 

particles as these cool down below their critical temperature. The direction of the NRM 48 

coincides with the local direction of the Earth’s magnetic field prevailing at the time of 49 

cooling. Archaeomagnetic dating is achieved by comparing the measured mean 50 

archaeomagnetic data from a sampled structure with a reference curve that describes the 51 

known local evolution of the Earth’s magnetic field. These reference curves were firstly 52 

developed as regional secular variation curves (SVC) defined at a reference location 53 

(usually a main or a central city); later, regional models were also developed at a 54 

country level in such a way that through the model a SVC can be computed for any 55 

location within the region; finally global models were also developed, these formally 56 

cover all the Earth’s surface although their non-uniform distribution of archaeomagnetic 57 

data results in a variable reliability of their magnetic field predictions. 58 

Europe is one of the areas were archaeomagnetic SVC and geomagnetic models are 59 

quite well developed. France was one of the first countries to build its own SVC 60 

(Thellier, 1981) and this has been regularly updated (Bucur, 1994; Gallet et al. 2002; 61 

Genevey et al., 2009 and 2013). Archaeomagnetic dating in Spain could only be 62 

attempted using the French SVC (Parés et al., 1992) before the publication by Gómez-63 

Paccard et al. (2006) of the first SVC for the Iberian Peninsula which was based on 143 64 

archaeomagnetic directions with ages ranging from 775 BC to AD 1959. Since then, 65 

various archaeomagnetic studies have produced new data (e. g. Catanzariti et al., 2012; 66 

Gómez-Paccard et al., 2013) and the existing SVC has been used as a dating tool (e. g. 67 

Catanzariti et al., 2007; Gómez-Paccard and Beamud, 2008; Prevosti et al., 2013; Casas 68 

et al., 2014a). Additionally, for a relatively high-density area of archaeomagnetic data 69 

such as Europe, it has been possible to develop a regional model based on spherical cap 70 

harmonic analysis (Pavón-Carrasco et al., 2009). This model have also been 71 

successfully applied to determine the age of archaeological sites in Spain (e.g. Prevosti 72 

et al., 2013; Casas et al., 2014a; Casas et al., 2014b). Recently, a new global 73 

geomagnetic field model based on archaeomagnetic and volcanic data has been 74 



published (Pavón-Carrasco et al., 2014). This model describes the geomagnetic field 75 

variations for the last 14000 years and was built using the updated GEOMAGIA50v2 76 

database (Korhonen et al., 2008) containing new data from Spain. Other existing global 77 

models based partially on lake sediments records result in strongly smoothed SVC with 78 

a limited use for archaeomagnetic dating. 79 

In the present paper we intend to use the main available assets to build reference curves 80 

to undertake archaeomagnetic dating in Spain (this assets are the Iberian SVC, the 81 

regional SCHA.DIF.3k and the global SHA.DIF.14k models). These have been used to 82 

infer the age of the last heating in four archaeological structures from three sites in 83 

Catalonia (NE Spain), see Fig. 1. The sampled structures have archaeological/historical 84 

context and are associated to a more or less constrained ages (Roman, Medieval and 85 

modern). The archaeomagnetic dating should constraint further their age. 86 

2 ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF THE SITES AND SAMPLED 87 

STRUCTURES 88 

2.1 Forn Teuler (Nulles, Tarragona) 89 

Forn Teuler is a Roman villa at Nulles (15 km north from Tarragona). The villa lies 90 

around 1.5 km to the south-west of the modern village and its existence was not been 91 

reported previously because it was discovered in 2010. Significant amounts of potsherds 92 

are scattered on a surface of about 2 ha and reused sherds can be found in modern dry 93 

stone walls that delimit outcrops. In situ walls of the villa have been integrated into a 94 

small country house, including 3-meter high opus caementicium walls. The abundant 95 

potsherds and tiles indicate a chronology spreading from the 2
nd

-1
st
 centuries BC up to 96 

the 4
th

 century AD. 97 

In 2013 archaeological prospection works were performed in the area and a cylindrical 98 

structure corresponding to a limekiln was reported. The structure is cut by an unpaved 99 

lane whose level was decreased recently (Fig. 2a). The estimated diameter of the kiln is 100 

around 3 meters. The kiln has not been excavated but 35 visible pottery fragments from 101 

its interior were recovered and some of them were used to reconstruct partially their 102 

corresponding vessels. Among the reconstructed vessels there were three Hayes 200 103 

forms of African red slip ware (Fig. 3) which indicate a chronology between mid-2
nd

 104 

century AD and mid-3
rd

 century AD (Hayes, 1972) when the kiln was already 105 

abandoned. 106 



The in-situ visible parts of the kiln walls below a dry stone wall were intensively drilled 107 

(Fig. 2a, bottom). From one side of the kiln nine oriented samples were retrieved and 108 

seventeen from the other, a total amount of twenty-six oriented samples were retrieved 109 

to perform archaeodirection analyses. 110 

 111 

2.2 Cal Ticó (Barcelona) 112 

 113 

This archaeological site is located on a hill delimited by a meander of the small 114 

Argençola stream, within the municipality of Castellnou de Bages (40 km north-west 115 

from Barcelona). The name of the site refers to a country house that lies 390 meters 116 

south-west to the hill. The presence of potsherds in the area motivated prospection 117 

works performed in 2006 and excavation works in a small rectangular area (250 m
2
) 118 

during 2008-2009. These revealed the presence of a small pottery workshop as indicated 119 

by structures very eroded which only preserve their bottom parts, excavated in the 120 

natural ground. The identified structures comprise two circular kilns (both with a 121 

diameter of around one meter), an oval working area and several clay extraction points 122 

(Folch and Gibert, 2011). Since 2011 the excavated area was progressively extended up 123 

to 575 m
2
. One end of the rectangular area, where lies the oval working area, was 124 

excavated further to the south-east and hints of a hut were revealed, including a small 125 

rectangular area originally interpreted as a hearth though perhaps it is an oxidized kiln 126 

floor.  127 

Folch and Gibert (2011) reported the radiocarbon dating results on the older infillings of 128 

the oval working area, indicating an age between Cal AD 880 and 1020 at a 95% 129 

confidence level (2). This age would presumably be also the terminus post quem age 130 

of the associated dwelling space. On the other hand, Cantoni et al. (2012) published an 131 

updated report of the excavation works including an additional radiocarbon dating of 132 

one of the kilns (labelled 1 in Folch and Gibert (2011)) indicating a later age, 133 

comprising three time intervals: Cal AD 1050-1090, 1120-1140 and 1150-1220 (2). 134 

This, as well as the repetition of similar structures at slightly different topographical 135 

levels suggests the existence of different archaeological phases. 136 

Two structures were sampled for archaeomagnetic purposes (Fig. 2b). On one hand, 137 

some burnt stones that formed the walls of the mentioned kiln were drilled and yielded 138 

and we get ten oriented samples. On the other hand, a flat stone from the small 139 



rectangular area was also sampled. This stone exhibited an oxidized reddish surface due 140 

to the high temperature and it was firmly attached to the ground and surrounded by 141 

oxidized clay. Twelve oriented samples were obtained from the small rectangular area 142 

(see Fig. 2b). It is unclear whether this area was really a hearth or part of a kiln. For 143 

simplicity and to help the reader to distinguish it from the other sampled structure we 144 

will refer to it as a hearth throughout the text. 145 

2.3 Camps de Mas Vidal (Girona) 146 

From 2010 to 2013, coinciding with roadworks in the municipality of Vilademuls (20 147 

km north from Girona) three archaeological sites (Aguelo et al., 2014) were identified 148 

and excavated, among them ‘Camps de Mas Vidal’. The site lies close to the track of the 149 

Roman Via Augusta and connected with this period two concentrations of silos were 150 

found. Only the inferior part of these structures was preserved, and the potsherds from 151 

their infillings indicated an age within the 2
nd

 century BC.  152 

In the same site, but in a different area, an isolated limekiln was found. This limekiln is 153 

very close to the country house which gives to the site its name (Mas Vidal). The kiln 154 

was cut in the ground taking advantage of the natural gradient of the land; its lateral 155 

opening was visible and it was situated at the same level that an internal shelf that 156 

supported the chalk blocks (Fig. 2c). The preserved interior of the kiln has a depth 157 

higher than 4 meters and the structure continued above the cut ground as stone blocks of 158 

its walls were found among the infilling material. No pottery or any other datable 159 

artifact was recovered from the kiln though typologically the kiln could be medieval or 160 

more likely modern. On the other hand the nearby country house, which construction 161 

was possibly connected with the production of lime in the kiln, is more than 200 years 162 

old (Camps, 2013). 163 

The limekiln was sampled all around its perimeter; the hard lime waste and slag that 164 

covered the shelf was particularly drilled but some samples were also obtained from the 165 

burnt sandstone that forms the lintel of the opening side. A total number of twenty-eight 166 

holes were drilled to produce oriented samples. 167

3 EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS 169 

3.1 Sampling and experimental methods 170 

There exist basically two different archaeomagnetic data than can be retrieved from 171 

heated structures and used to assign ages to them; the archaeomagnetic direction and the 172 

intensity. The first requires in situ structures whereas the latter can also be applied to 173 



displaced objects. At first sight it would seem obvious that the use of both direction and 174 

intensity should even be better than the use of only one of them. However, we have 175 

discarded the use of intensity. On one hand, there are harder requirements to retrieve 176 

reliable intensity estimates (in terms of particle size and magnetic mineralogy). On the 177 

other hand the inherent dating uncertainties of the archaeomagnetic methods indicates, 178 

within the area and presumed time intervals under study, that intensity would not 179 

constraint further the time intervals obtained using directions (Fig. 4). This is basically 180 

due to the high uncertainty of the intensity values given by the dating curves and the 181 

low rates of change of these intensity values over time. 182 

A portable electrical drill with a water-cooled diamond bit was used to sample the 183 

archaeological structures following the standard palaeomagnetic procedure. The in situ 184 

azimuth and dip of the cores were measured using a compass coupled to a core orienting 185 

fixture with clinometer. The obtained cores were cut to get standard palaeomagnetic 186 

specimens (2.5 cm diameter and length); some samples produced a single specimen, 187 

others produced two, and occasionally spare bits of the cores were also obtained. 188 

The magnetic mineralogy of the sampled materials was investigated using magnetic 189 

susceptibility equipment from Bartington, available at the Geology Department in the 190 

Universitat Autònoma, in Barcelona (UAB): a MS3 magnetic susceptibility meter and 191 

two kinds of sensors (MS2B dual frequency and MS2W water jacketed). The 192 

susceptibility of all the cores was measured at two different frequencies (0.465 and 4.65 193 

kHz) before and after application of the archaeodirection measuring protocol. The 194 

available spare bits of cores were crushed to fill the ceramic crucible that fits into the 195 

MS2WF furnace to obtain thermomagnetic susceptibility curves; the maximum heating 196 

temperature was 540ºC. 197 

Archaeodirections were obtained for each specimen following a standard laboratory 198 

protocol that comprised stepwise thermal demagnetization and measurement of the 199 

remnant magnetization after each temperature step. The equipment used was a 755R 200 

SRM superconducting rock magnetometer (2G Enterprises) and a MMTD-80 oven 201 

(Magnetic Measurements) available at the Paleomagnetism Laboratory (CCiTUB-202 

CSIC) of the Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera (Barcelona, Spain). Ten steps, 203 

from 150ºC to 570ºC, were applied. For each specimen the characteristic remnant 204 

magnetization (ChRM) direction was calculated by principal component analyses 205 

(Kirschvink, 1980) on Zijderveld diagrams using the Plotcore software developed at the 206 

University of Liverpool. The corresponding maximum angular deviation (MAD) was 207 



also calculated. Specimens with MAD values higher than five were disregarded to 208 

compute the mean direction of each sampled structure (Hervé et al., 2011). Mean 209 

directions were calculated following Fisher (1953) statistics; concentration parameter k 210 

and confidence factor α95 were also computed.  211 

3.2 Magnetic susceptibility results 212 

All the samples from Forn Teuler (Nulles, Tarragona) are very similar, whitish and 213 

compact with a mass susceptibility (LF) between 2 and 10 · 10
-6

 m
3
/kg. Their values of 214 

frequency dependent susceptibility (FD) are around 8% and rarely exceed 10%. This 215 

would indicate the presence of a significant amount of superparamagnetic (SP) grains 216 

(Dearing et al., 1996). After the measurement of the archaeomagnetic directions, the 217 

susceptibility of the samples decreases slightly and the values of FD become more 218 

erratic. This can be interpreted as an enhancement of antiferromagnetic compensation of 219 

magnetic moments and the creation of new extremely fine SP grains. Thermomagnetic 220 

curves also support the presence of an antiferromagnetic phase as susceptibility 221 

increases with the temperature within the range 40ºC to 240ºC. 222 

All the samples from Cal Ticó (Barcelona) are made of local reddish (rubefacted) 223 

sandstone, samples from the kiln exhibited LF values from 2 to 9·10
-6

 m
3
/kg, whereas 224 

samples from the hearth showed much lower LF values, around 5·10
-8

 m
3
/kg (except 225 

one bearing a rust crust with a LF value of 4·10
-6

 m
3
/kg). FD is around 4% for samples 226 

from the kiln and even lower for samples from the hearth. After having heated 227 

repeatedly the samples to retrieve their archaeomagnetic directions, the susceptibility of 228 

the samples from the kiln decreases slightly and remains unchanged for samples from 229 

the hearth. This would imply that in both cases the susceptibility signal is dominated by 230 

coarse-grain multidomain (MD) ferromagnetic or, more likely, ferrimagnetic minerals 231 

though their presence is very diluted within the sandstone. 232 

There are three types of samples from Camps de Mas Vidal (Girona), slag, sandstone 233 

and baked clay. Slag and sandstone samples show low susceptibility values (2·10
-7

 234 

m
3
/kg), whereas samples of baked clay exhibit higher values (7·10

-6
 m

3
/kg). FD are 235 

below 4% for all kinds of samples indicating again that the susceptibility signal is 236 

dominated by coarse-grain MD particles. 237 

There is a good reversibility of the thermomagnetic curves for the samples from the 238 

three sites, the cooling curves showing only a slight decrease for samples from Forn 239 

Teuler. Despite the different magnetic phases and domain state that could be deduced 240 



from the susceptibility values, the distribution of the Koenigsberger ratios (QNRM) for all 241 

the samples from the three sites, except those from the sampled hearth in Cal Ticó, 242 

showed QNRM values above 1 (Fig. 5) indicating stable remnant magnetizations not 243 

influenced by the current field. In contrast, all samples from the hearth (but one) show 244 

QNRM values below 1 and therefore they could be dominated by an induced 245 

magnetization due to the present geomagnetic field; this has to be taken into account to 246 

analyze the corresponding archaeodirection results. 247 

3.3 Archaeodirection results 248 

Representative Zijderveld diagrams of specimens from each sampled structure are 249 

shown in Fig. 6 along with the Lambert equal-area projections of all the individual 250 

ChRM directions that contribute to the computations of the mean archaeomagnetic 251 

direction of each structure. All twenty-six samples from Nulles produced a single 252 

specimen and only three were rejected, one due to a MAD>5º and two due to broken 253 

cores that were wrongly replaced in their original position to retrieve their orientation.  254 

From the ten samples from kiln 1 in Can Ticó, two outliers were rejected (with an 255 

anomalously high declination value, around 40º), only one sample produced two 256 

specimens and the corresponding direction datum was computed as the mean value 257 

between both measurements before computing the mean archaeodirection using the 258 

eight accepted values. From the twelve samples from the hearth, sampled in the same 259 

site, only one sample was rejected again due to a very high declination value. Two 260 

samples produced two specimens instead of one; in this case, only one was used to 261 

compute the corresponding direction data because for both samples one of the 262 

specimens exhibited a MAD value higher than 5º. Finally, from the twenty-eight 263 

samples collected in Mas Vidal, six were rejected, four due to MAD>5º, and two due to 264 

broken cores wrongly replaced in the original position.  265 

A Fisher’s test using fishqq.py from the PmagPy software package (Tauxe, 2010) 266 

proved that all data ensembles used to compute mean archaeodirections are Fisher 267 

distributed and therefore Fisher statistics can be used to calculate the corresponding 268 

mean direction. Table 1 summarizes the obtained archaeomagnetic directional results. 269 

 270 

4 ARCHAEOMAGNETIC DATING 271 

The obtained mean directions were compared with three available reference curves: i) 272 

the SVC for the Iberian Peninsula (Gómez-Paccard et al., 2006) that describes the 273 

evolution of the geomagnetic field at Madrid during the period of time between 815 BC 274 



to 1900 AD (Fig. 7a). ii) a curve computed using the regional archaeomagnetic model 275 

SCHA.DIF.3k (Pavón-Carrasco et al., 2009) that allows the computation of reference 276 

curves for the interval between 1000 BC and 1900 AD in Europe and neighboring areas 277 

(Fig. 7b). And iii) a curve computed using the global archaeomagnetic model 278 

SHA.DIF.14k (Pavón-Carrasco et al., 2014) that extends the computation of the 279 

geomagnetic field back to 12000 BC (although the model is not well constrained before 280 

6000 BC) and to any location on the Earth. Comparison was performed using a Matlab 281 

dating tool developed by Pavón-Carrasco et al., (2011), for model SHA.DIF.14k only 282 

the time interval 2000 BC to 1900 AD was used (Fig. 7c). 283 

 284 

5 DISCUSSION 285 

In general, comparison with the reference curves produces similar time intervals that 286 

roughly agree with the presumed archaeological age or with available radiocarbon data. 287 

However, the Iberian SVC fails to get a plausible age for the limekiln at Camps de Mas 288 

Vidal. This is due to the higher level of smoothing for this curve compared with those 289 

produced by the curves obtained using the archaeomagnetic models. In particular, the 290 

unsuccessful dating is possibly due to the fact that the Iberian SVC does not define a 291 

sharp inclination peak that occurs around the presumed age of the limekiln. 292 

Additionally, SVC are defined at a reference point (in this case Madrid) and their use 293 

involves the relocation of the archaeomagnetic data assuming a purely dipolar field 294 

which is, as indicated by Casas and Incoronato (2007) a possible source of error. 295 

For the kiln sampled at Nulles (Forn Teuler) the dating solutions consist of several 296 

rather wide time intervals. The available contextual data (Hayes 200 forms within the 297 

the infillings of the kiln) indicates that in the 2
nd

-3
rd

 centuries AD the kiln was already 298 

abandoned. Both the regional SCHA.DIF.3k and the SHA.DIF.14k solutions indicate at 299 

a 95% confidence level that the kiln could have been used for the last time in the mid-1
st
 300 

century AD (see Fig. 8a). In contrast, the Iberian SVC places the last use quite earlier, in 301 

the 1
st
 century BC. It does not seem very reasonable to admit that much more than 100 302 

years passed after the last use of the kiln and its filling but it is not impossible. Besides 303 

that, the dating solution obtained using the Iberian SVC also includes a time interval 304 

that points to a modern use (or remagnetization) of the kiln. This remagnetization is 305 

quite unlikely as the kiln was not exposed until very recently. The fact that the other two 306 



tested dating assets do not produce this modern age interval points to think that this is 307 

an artifact produced by the Iberian SVC. 308 

The comparison between the experimental results from the two structures sampled at 309 

Cal Ticó (the kiln and the hearth) and the reference curves produced probability 310 

distributions always consisting of a single and very narrow time interval.  It is worth to 311 

mention that the two structures produced basically the same time intervals. This 312 

concurrence is particularly noticeable using the archaeomagnetic models to date the 313 

structures instead of the Iberian SVC. Moreover, Koenigsberger ratios (QNRM) from the 314 

hearth suggested that the remanence from these samples could be influenced by the 315 

present values of the geomagnetic field. Consistently, both mean declination and 316 

inclination values from the hearth are slightly closer to the present field values (Fig. 7), 317 

and paradoxically the slight difference in the mean direction provokes that the dating 318 

solution for the hearth is always a time interval that begins slightly earlier than that of 319 

the kiln. The available radiocarbon ages have been compared with the archaeomagnetic 320 

results (Fig 8e). Considering the 2- radiocarbon ages (which directly compare to the 321 

95% confidence level archaeomagnetic ages) the agreement between the radiocarbon 322 

and archaeomagnetic ages of the kiln is quite good. The archaeomagnetic age of the kiln 323 

appears to be just statistically a bit older than the radiocarbon one. This fact makes the 324 

results fit even better if we consider that the archaeomagnetic age dates the last heating 325 

of the kiln and the radiocarbon age dates its infillings. In contrast, the age of the 326 

working oval area and the hearth do not overlap. This poorer agreement is not surprising 327 

as the link between the oval area and the hearth is only suggested by their proximity and 328 

also, because the QNRM values from the hearth samples suggest that their magnetic 329 

remanence could have been perturbed by the current geomagnetic field. 330 

Coming back to the Camps de Mas Vidal site, besides the discordant results obtained 331 

using the Iberian SVC, the other reference curves produce very similar and very narrow 332 

time intervals. This is what one should expect for modern structures because the 333 

uncertainty bars of the archaeomagnetic models decrease drastically when they 334 

approach the present time. For modern structures, the precision of archaeomagnetic 335 

dating is at its highest point and the dating discussion can go to the yearly scale (Casas 336 

et al., 2014b). Unfortunately, no written documentation on the construction date of Mas 337 

Vidal country house has been found. Besides that, the link between the country house 338 

and the limekiln is merely a hypothesis. In any case the hypothesis is now supported by 339 



archaeomagnetic dating as the presumed age of the country house (>200 years) and the 340 

archaeomagnetic age of the limekiln (mid 17
th

-early 18
th

 century) show a good 341 

agreement.   342 

6 CONCLUSIONS 343 

The ages of last heating of four structures from three archaeological sites from 344 

Catalonia (NE Spain) have been constrained. The kiln sampled at Nulles (Forn Teuler) 345 

was used during the mid-1
st
 century AD. Both structures sampled at Cal Ticó are almost 346 

concurrent and were used during the 11
th

 century AD. The limekiln from Camps de Mas 347 

Vidal was used during the second half of the 17
th

 century or early 18
th

 century AD. 348 

The comparison between the contextual archaeological data, radiocarbon ages and the 349 

obtained archaeomagnetic ages, as well as the dating discussion, indicate that in general 350 

archaeomagnetic direction dating is reliable. However, the Iberian SVC does not 351 

describe rapid changes of the Earth’s magnetic field and could be too smooth to obtain 352 

precise archaeomagnetic ages. This has been shown in the case of the limekiln at Camps 353 

de Mas Vidal where the SVC can even fail to produce a reasonable archaeomagnetic 354 

age. The Iberian SVC was the first archaeomagnetic dating asset specifically designed 355 

for application on sites from Spain and Portugal, but it has been superseded by the 356 

regional SCHA.DIF.3k model. For the time span and area investigated, the new 357 

SHA.DIF.14k global model appears to be basically identical to the regional model.  358 

One of the advantages of archaeomagnetic dating is that this technique dates a very well 359 

defined moment, i.e. the last thermal event that occurred on the measured material. This 360 

thermal event in the case of undisturbed kilns corresponds to the last firing. Therefore, 361 

decontextualization issues can only hardly arise using this technique. This has to be 362 

taken into account when it comes to putting together all the data from an archaeological 363 

site with different overlapped parts and chronological phases. The ‘Cal Ticó’ site can be 364 

a good example of site with such a complexity. 365 

The results corroborate that archaeomagnetic dating of structures of unknown age (due 366 

to the lack of contextual data) can already be successfully undertaken in north-eastern 367 

Spain in a very wide time window. This was already pointed out in previous 368 

publications for model SCHA.DIF.3k (e.g. Casas et al., 2014a) and it also applies to the 369 

new SHA.DIF.14k model. The precision of dating decrease as we go back in time as it 370 

has been shown for the limekiln at Forn Teuler (Nulles). The expected precision of 371 

archaeomagnetic dating for Roman sites is around the century. Fortunately, in the 372 



Mediterranean area, there are many Roman sites bearing typologically datable artifacts 373 

that can be used to progressively increase the available data to improve the 374 

archaeomagnetic models; this is an ongoing collective task. Besides that, in future work, 375 

older archaeological sites, including prehistoric sites, should be investigated to fully 376 

exploit and check the possibilities of the new SHA.DIF.14k archaeomagnetic model. 377
