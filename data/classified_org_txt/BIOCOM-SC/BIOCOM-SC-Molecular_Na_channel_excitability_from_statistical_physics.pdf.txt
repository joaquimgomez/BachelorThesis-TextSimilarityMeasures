Abstract – The excitable properties of the neural cell membrane is the driving mechanism of
the neural pulses. Coordinated ionic fluxes across Na and K channels are the devices responsible
of this function. Here we present a simple microscopic physical scenario which accounts for this
phenomenology. The main elements are ions and channel doors that obey standard formulation
of statistical physics (overdamped Langevin equations) with appropriate nonlinear interacting
potentials. From these equations we obtain the ionic flux and the dynamics of the membrane
potential. We show that the excitable properties of the membrane are present in a single and
simple Na channel. From this framework, additional microscopic information can be obtained,
such as statistics of single channels dynamics or the energetics of action potential events.

Introduction. – Experimental understanding of bio-1
physical electrical processes in the cell membrane during2
the action potential has much progressed during the last 603
years, mainly fostered by the seminal works by Hodgkin4
and Huxley [1]. They performed extensive experiments5
on the giant squid axon, and constructed a mathematical6
model that has constituted since then the basis for the7
interpretation of the behaviour of nerve and cardiac cells.8
According to the Hodgkin-Huxley [HH] model, action po-9
tential is produced by coordinated ionic fluxes crossing the10
cell membrane, which acts as a capacitor. Then the ex-11
citable characteristics of the membrane action potential is12
the result of a dynamical coupling between the ionic flux,13
the membrane conductance and the electrostatic potential14
[1].15

It is now also well known that ions flow along some bio-16
chemical molecules (channels) embedded in the cell mem-17
brane. These channels present two main structural confor-18
mations (open and closed), with transitions between these19
two states controlled by the membrane potential. Action20
potential is then known to be the result of the synchro-21
nized dynamics of a large number of ionic channels [2].22
Moreover much quantitative physical information is also23
known on the dynamics of the distinct states of single ionic24
channels [3–6]. In particular experiments on single chan-25
nels show very strong fluctuations in the intensity (pA,26

i.e. a few charges in a microsecond) crossing the channel. 27
As a result the observed stochastic behavior has become 28
a active topic in recent studies. 29

Several theoretical scenarios have been used to address 30
this stochastic phenomenology. Most of these approaches 31
incorporate fluctuations in some of the elements of the 32
HH theory, for instance by using Langevin [7–10] or mas- 33
ter equations [11] for the conductance equations or noise 34
terms in the equation for the membrane charge [12]. A 35
more microscopic approach used Langevin equations for 36
the ions with Poisson equation for the potential membrane 37
[13] in order to obtain the effects of fluctuations on the 38
membrane conductivity. 39

A microscopic modeling of the excitable dynamics of 40
the action potential, treating channels and ions as physi- 41
cal objects, merits attention. This approach would allow 42
for studying single channel excitable events, and to ob- 43
tain additional information of some aspects of the action 44
potential dynamics, such as energetic balances. It would 45
also provide the influence of changes of different physi- 46
cal parameters (concentrations, temperature, etc) on the 47
whole process, without the need of additional parameter 48
fittings. Then one could address questions such as the 49
minimum elements necessary to produce the action poten- 50
tial or whether the cooperative coupling of a large number 51
of channels is necessary for excitability. 52

Our aim in this work is thus to place the action po-53
tential spikes within the framework of statistical physics54
to explain these phenomena at the microscopic level. We55
will propose a minimum model presenting the desired ex-56
citable behavior, and accordingly we will not try to get57
quantitative agreements with any particular cell type. As58
a result we expect our simplified model to be close to a59
very primitive channel, presumably much simpler than in60
modern organisms and containing the minimum set of el-61
ements that permit a bona fide excitability behavior.62
In this paper we proceed first with the description of63

the Na channel and the physical elements that constitute64
our model. Next we present the numerical results for the65
excitable behavior of a single Na channel, and relate the66
excitable properties of the model to the physical mecha-67
nisms implicit in the classical HH theory. We will show68
that the minimum scenario to explain the excitable prop-69
erties is a single gated Na channel in the presence of a70
leakage of K ions. We end with some conclusions and71
perspectives.72

Microscopic physical approach and modeliza-73

tion. – Our approach consists of treating ions as Brown-74
ian particles, and channels as physical pores with mechan-75
ical doors that have two steady states (open and closed).76
All of them are driven by the membrane potential which77
also depends on the ionic flux. We will focus on the dy-78
namics of a Na channel with two doors, whose states are79
defined by the variables Y1 and Y2, that will evolve accord-80
ing their respective dynamics controlled by the membrane81
potential ∆V . Our approach is then closely related with82
that of Ref. [13] but within a more simple scenario. The83
leak of K ions through the membrane will be modeled as84
an additional channel with effective parameters without85
doors.86
Other relevant point for a microscopic description is87

that fluctuations should be relevant locally due to the very88
small number of charges involved and the fact that, al-89
though they move deterministically under the electrostatic90
force, they diffuse also by thermal noise. Following stan-91
dard formulations of nonequilibrium statistical mechan-92
ics, the main variables of the model follow overdamped93
Langevin equations with their corresponding potential en-94
ergies and thermal noises. The system is autonomous, and95
the only source of energy is the Gibbs energy associated96
with the ionic concentrations and the membrane poten-97
tial. In this way the model is also able to give information98
about the energetics of any excitable event. In this for-99
mulation, the model parameters and other characteristics100
can be related to biological experimental information.101
To make explicit our microscopic approach we will for-102

mulate our approach following the following assumptions:103
(i) The first assumption is the use the capacitor equation

for the membrane potential ∆V ,

−CM
d∆V

dt
= INa + IK + I0, (1)

where CM is the membrane capacity assumed to be con-104

stant and adjusted to a single Na channel. The intensities 105
INa, and IK correspond to the flux of Na and the leak of 106
K ions. I0 is a perturbative current pulse that will trigger 107
the spike. This equation will be integrated as 108

∆V (t+∆t) = ∆V (t)−
∆Q(Na+) + ∆Q(K+)

2CM
, (2)

where ∆Q(Na+) and ∆Q(K+) are the balance of charges 109
crossing any of the channel boundaries during the interval 110
of time ∆t which are obtained from the trajectories of ions. 111
The divisor “2” takes into account that charges cross both 112
boundaries of the channel (then being counted twice) when 113
crossing the membrane from one side to the other one. 114
(ii) The second assumption has to do with the calcula-

tion of the ionic flux. Ions inside the channel are described
by point–like particles with electrical charge +q moving
in one dimension. Their positions xi(t) obey overdamped
Langevin equations, γiẋi = −∂xiU + ξi(t), where γi is the
effective friction and ξi(t) is a thermal noise of zero mean
and intensity γikBT . The interaction potential U is the
addition of the interactions with the doors (see below) and
the electrostatic membrane potential Ve(xi,∆V ),

Ve(xi,∆V ) = q
∆V

L
(xi − L), 0 < xi < L. (3)

This Langevin equation has to be complemented with 115
boundary conditions of concentration values ρ0 = Acin 116
at x = 0 and ρ2 = Acout at x = L, being A the effective 117
section of the channel and cin/out the bulk ion concentra- 118
tion, interior and exterior to the cell respectively (note 119
that any ion affinity of the pore could be accounted for 120
by changing the value of A in these relations). Bound- 121
ary conditions are implemented in the following way: ions 122
disappear when hopping out of the channel due to their 123
Brownian motion, and they appear into the channel ac- 124
cording with a probability depending on the concentration 125
at this boundary. There is no need of any explicit assump- 126
tion about the form of the conductances, but nevertheless 127
the fact that it is formulated consistently with statistical 128
mechanics guaranties that this model evolves towards the 129
correct steady state membrane potential without further 130
parameters or fine tuning. That is, it provides the Nernst 131
potential when a single ion species can cross the mem- 132
brane, and the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz theoretical pre- 133
diction [14] when different ions compite. Note also that 134
we are explicitly neglecting any ion-ion interaction inside 135
the channel. This is justified by the small number of ions 136
simultaneously present in the system and the screening of 137
the aqueous medium. 138
(iii) The dynamical equations for the channel doors are 139

the kernel of our approach. There is strong experimen- 140
tal evidence that the Na channel has two active doors 141
or barriers [2], and that they open and close stochasti- 142
cally according to the value of the electrostatic membrane 143
potential and thermal fluctuations [6]. This hypothesis 144

the K pore (top). Arrows indicate the ion flux when the chan-
nels are open.

and the use of Langevin equations are the original parts145
of our approach. Then we describe a channel door as a146
physical barrier controlled by the dimensionless variable147
Y which behaves as a nonlinear spring with two steady148
states: Y ∼ 0 (closed) and Y ∼ 1 (open). These door149
states are controlled by the elastic potential Vj(Yj ,∆V )150
(j = 1, 2), given by151

Vj(Yj ,∆V ) = V0
[

−a ln(Yj(1− Yj))− b(Yj − 0.5)
2
]

+ Qj(∆V − φref )Yj , (4)

where Qj is the charge of each door sensor and φref is152
a reference potential. Their values are specific of each153
door, Q1 = 12 e , Q2 = −8 e, whereas we take common154
values for the other parameters: V0 = 7kBT , a = 0.2,155
b = 9, and φref = −40 mV. his potential presents two156
minima near Yi ∼ 0, 1 corresponding to the closed and157
open states respectively. These minima interchange their158
relative metastability by changing the value of ∆V . For159
smaller voltages the door 1 (2) is in the closed Y1 ∼ 0 (open160
Y2 ∼ 1) state, and for larger voltages we have the oposite161
behavior. At ∆V = −40mV both states are equally prob-162
able in both doors.163
Since barriers are physical entities, when ions interact

with them they interchange momentum and energy. Thus
variables Y and xi have to obey physical laws expressed
in terms of dynamical (Langevin) equations constructed
from a common potential. With this requirement the po-
tential VI(Y, xi) corresponding to the interaction between
particles and internal barriers is modeled as

VI(Y, xi) = Vdf(Y ) exp

, (5)

where Vd is the barrier height, xc is the position of the164
barrier center inside the channel and σ is its width (see165
Fig. 2). The function f(Y ) modules the aperture of the166
doors according to the Yj variables. The parameter values167

for the two doors have been taken as Vd(1) = 200meV, 168
Vd(2) = 250meV, xc(1) = 1 nm, xc(2) = 3 nm, and σ = 169
0.283 nm. 170
For the modulated function f(Y ) in Eq. (5) we have

taken the function,

f(Y ) =
1

2
(1 + cosπY ), (6)

which has the values f(0) = 1 for the closed state, and 171
f(1) = 0 for the open state, and has relative extrema at 172
these points. This property reduces the sensitivity against 173
thermal fluctuations of Y around the steady states. 174
Regarding the K leakage through the membrane, we 175

consider the motion of K ions as equivalent to moving in 176
an additional (K-selective) channel without any door, and 177
with effective parameters. This provides a charge leakage 178
that restores the membrane potential at the end of the ac- 179
tion potential. Then we have not considered for K a gated 180
channel in the spirit of the HH-theory (see below), since 181
we are seeking a minimal model and as we will show such 182
a gate is not necessary for excitability. 183
According to the former assumptions our approach has 184

a set of equations that need to be numerically simulated. 185
Our variables are the position xi of the ions (Na and K) 186
inside the channel, the Na channel doors Y1 and Y2 and 187
the membrane electrostatic potential ∆V . 188

Note that the first Langevin equation is for all ions:193

More specifically, as in a real experiment, we follow209

the dynamical evolution of the membrane potential when210
small and instantaneous discharges ∆Q of positive ions,211
corresponding to depolarizing voltage perturbations ∆V0212
of +80 or +70 mV, are applied to the membrane with213
a period of 5ms. In Fig. 3 we show a typical time in-214
terval with 10 of these perturbation events. In order to215
show the characteristics of the perturbations, we show, on216
top of this figure, how these pulses are seen when they217
are applied to the membrane without the presence of the218
Na channel, ı.e. with only the K leakage. We see the ex-219
pected response of the system as a sudden increase of ∆V0220
followed by a slow relaxation towards the steady value of221
the membrane potential. We can also appreciate the size222
of the voltage stochastic fluctuations.223
In the middle and bottom figures we show the response224

of the system under these perturbations. The middle225
graph of the figure corresponds to perturbations equiv-226
alent to instantaneous increases of ∆V of +70 mV, and227
the bottom graph to increases of +80 mV. At each pertur-228
bation event the value of the potential membrane ∆V (t)229
presents narrow and larger excursions towards positive val-230
ues. This high increase is due to the fast flux of Na ions231
into the cell when both channel doors are opened. Then232

the door 2 of this channel closes suddenly and the out- 233
ward K-flux starts to restore the initial steady state of the 234
membrane potential but in a larger time scale. Although 235
most of the peaks are real excitable events (their height 236
are around two times larger than the perturbation), a few 237
of them have some imperfections. In the middle figure we 238
see some failed (f) or missing events when the Na channel 239
door Y1 does not open, and double peaks (d) when door 240
2 opens again before the closing of door 1. Also at the 241
bottom graph we see small (s) pulses, in which the door 242
2 closes very fast and the channel has been active a very 243
short time. One appreciate that for pulses of +70 mV 244
(middle graph) the number of errors is larger. 245
To describe more explicitly the dynamics of the model 246

during the action potential, we show in Fig. 4 a detailed 247
view of a single pulse (the 9th pulse in Fig. 3-bottom) with 248
numerical results for other observables. The top frame in 249
this figure is an amplification of the membrane potential, 250
the middle frame is the plot of the ionic intensities dur- 251
ing the same pulse, and in the bottom part we find the 252
evolution of the two Na channel doors, Y1 and Y2. In 253
these frames we have marked five different times: t0 is the 254
perturbative trigger time, where the potential is instan- 255
taneously increased in an amount ∆V0 = 80 mV. This is 256
followed by the opening of door Y1 at t1. Then at t2 the 257
door Y2 closes. In the interval (t1, t2) both Na channel 258

doors are open and Na ions enter into the cell producing259
the rise of the ∆V pulse. This is manifest in the middle260
figure where we see the corresponding inward (negative)261
Na intensity. This interval corresponds to the so-called262
open state [2]. After t2 the Na flux is stopped, due to the263
closing of Y2, which corresponds to what is known as the264
inactivated state of the channel. Here an eventual addi-265
tional perturbation would not induce any channel opening.266
Now K leak starts to dominate tending to restore the ini-267
tial or standby state by an outward (positive) K intensity,268
as seen in the middle frame. Then at t3 the Y1 closes269
and at t4 the Y2 opens. The refractory time corresponds270
to the interval (t2, t4) when Y2 remains closed. After t4271
the channel recovers the steady (excitable) closed state.272
In this figure we can also see the fluctuations of the door273
variables and their almost instantaneous transitions fol-274
lowing the membrane potential. In the middle frame data275
of ion intensities have been filtered by using an averaging276
filter with a window of 62.5 µs to improve the signal from277
the sea of statistical fluctuations.278

Thus our model exhibits some of the fluctuations and279
imperfections observed in experiments. These figures280
could be refined by further adjustment of the system pa-281
rameters to a specific experiment, or by introducing a sec-282
ond kind of K–channel with a door, but the excitability283
properties of the model are clearly manifest.284

It is interesting to relate the assumptions of this model
to the main elements of the classical Hodgkin-Huxley the-
ory. In this theory the crossing of ions through the mem-
brane is described by time-dependent currents, represent-
ing the total of a large number of channels. These currents
produce changes in the membrane potential according to

the capacitor equation. Our first assumption Eq. 1 is ex-
actly this, but applied to discrete charges (ions) instead
to currents. Moreover, according to HH, the charge inten-
sity crossing many Na channels depends on the membrane
potential according to a generic law,

INa = gNa(t)(∆V − VNa), (12)

where VNa is the Na Nernst potential and gNa(t) is the 285
ionic conductance. Membrane conductances represent 286
thus the average of the states of a large number of chan- 287
nels, each of them either open or closed. We have substi- 288
tuted this Ohm-type law by the Langevin dynamics of ions 289
along a single channel. Nernst potential is not a parameter 290
of our model, but instead it is reached automatically (in 291
a single ion species situation) since it corresponds to the 292
equilibrium state of our model. Analogously Goldman– 293
Hodgkin–Katz law is verified in the steady state corre- 294
sponding to more general situations. 295
Moreover in Eq. (12) the membrane conductance de-

pends on other variables subjected to dynamical equations
[1]. Namely this conductance depends on so called activa-
tion and deactivation functions m and h,

gNa(t) = ḡNam
3(t)h(t), (13)

where ḡNa, is a constant. Activation and deactivation 296
functions are interpreted in the context of our model as 297
the average state of each of the two channel doors, i.e. of 298
our variables Y1 and Y2, for a large number of channels. 299
The way these functions m and h are built is the kernel of 300
the HH theory. They obey deterministic linear differential 301
equations, chosen in such a way that each variables m, h 302
have a single steady state that, depending on the value 303
of ∆V , ranges continuously from 1 (all doors open) to 0 304
(all doors closed). On the contrary our variables Yi, rep- 305
resenting the doors of a single channel, present two steady 306
state (open and closed) in such a way that a stochastic 307
dynamics permits transitions between both states 308
The HH–theory includes K-channels with a different 309

conductance (with a single door) and a ionic leakage. In 310
our model we have only implemented the leak. The K- 311
channel with door could be implemented in our model 312
straightforwardly, but it has not been necessary for ob- 313
taining excitability. 314
As a result, both in the HH–theory and in our model, 315

the coupling between potential and the channels state trig- 316
ger a well synchronized temporal sequence of events, re- 317
sulting in a sudden discharge of Na ions, the appearance 318
of the spike and the K flux restoring the potential. 319

Conclusions and perspectives. – We have pre- 320
sented a microscopic physical approach to the excitable 321
properties seen in neuronal cell membranes. The main 322
points of our approach are: ions obey classical sta- 323
tistical equations of motion, channels are pores with 324
doors whose dynamics are controlled by elastic nonlin- 325
ear potentials, and the electrostatic potential of the cell 326

membrane follows the capacitor equation. Moreover,327
since it is constructed incorporating fluctuations accord-328
ing to fundamental statistical physics (namely according329
to fluctuation-dissipation theorem), it provides the correct330
statistical fluctuations of the diverse variables. This model331
can then be used to study the dynamics of a small num-332
ber of channels, and in particular it appears as specially333
suitable for analyzing single channel experiments. Note334
that in global measurements of real neural spikes a large335
number of channels are involved, and fluctuations will be336
smoothed out.337

We have shown that a single Na channel in the presence338
of K leakage constitute an excitable system producing the339
characteristic spikes in the action potential. Our objective340
here was not to reproduce the exact form of the action341
potential for some specific channels or neurons but rather342
to formulate in terms of fundamental statistical mechanic343
laws the underlined physical mechanisms in this biomolec-344
ular process.345

It is worth to comment about the model parameters346
and their specific values. All of them have a clear physical347
meaning. Ionic concentrations per length are fixed by the348
experimental densities and the estimated channel areas.349
Friction parameters are estimated from experimental time350
scales, and barrier heights are of order of a few kBT as351
it is expected in the biomolecular scale. Parameters of352
the doors and the function in Eq. (6) have been chosen353
to fix the door’s steady states (open and closed) and their354
location inside the channel. Other parameters such Qj355
and φref are adjusted to enter in the experimental scale.356
Since their physical meaning is clear and they are used in357
physical dynamical equations the whole model lies within358
the framework of well founded physics.359

This approach presents several perspectives worth to be360
explored:361
- All model elements are described by standard phys-

ical equations based on a single energy functional, and
accordingly it is possible to address the energetics of an
excitable event. Before and after a pulse the system is in
the same thermodynamic state but several (few) charges
have changed of reservoir: ∆qNa influx of Na and ∆qK
outflow of K. Thus it is easy to estimate their loss of Gibbs
energy,

∆G = ∆qNa g(Na) + ∆qK g(K), (14)

where g(Na), g(K) are the Gibbs energy per particle of362
Na and K ions.363

- The approach allows for other channels and doors mod-364
elizations which could be related to different biochemical365
structures of the channel proteins. Each door would have366
specific effective parameters that can be estimated from367
appropriate experiments.368

- The role of the ionic concentrations on the channel369
states has not been receiving so far enough experimental370
attention, but we have observed, in our simulations, im-371
portant sensitivity due to the ion–door collisions (in this372
regard see for instance Fig. 5 in Ref. [15]).373

- Our approach allows to a new view, from statistical 374
physics, of the well established Hodgkin-Huxley theory 375
and other models based in it. 376
Finally, it is worth to remark that we have employed 377

the minimum set of elements that results in the excitable 378
dynamics observed in biological membranes. In this re- 379
gard, it could also be seen as a modelization of hypothet- 380
ical primitive channels, which presumably would be much 381
simpler than present biological structures, which are the 382
result of a long evolution and likely much more sophis- 383
ticated. Thus our approach opens a complementary sce- 384
nario to study ionic channel phenomenology from funda- 385
mental physics. 386
