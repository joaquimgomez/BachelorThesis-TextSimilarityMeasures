We study the interaction between two independent nonlinear oscillators competing through a neutral excit-
able element. The first oscillator, completely deterministic, acts as a normal pacemaker sending pulses to the
neutral element which fires when it is excited by these pulses. The second oscillator, endowed with some
randomness, though unable to make the excitable element to beat, leads to the occasional suppression of its
firing. The missing beats or errors are registered and their statistics analyzed in terms of the noise intensity and
the periods of both oscillators. This study is inspired in some complex rhythms such as a particular class of
heart arrhythmia.

Synchronization of nonlinear oscillators, either mutual or
entrained to an input signal, has been and continues being a
very active topic of research �1�. However, intrinsically dif-
ferent, at least from a formal point of view, is the issue of an
“external” or “exported” competition between a pair of os-
cillators with distinct and arbitrary frequencies. By exported,
we mean that the competition is assumed to take place and is
being registered in a neutral third excitable element. Al-
though this scenario has been much less investigated than
standard synchronization, recently published related ap-
proaches are those of Balenzuela and Garcia-Ojalvo �2�,
when analyzing in a neuronal context binaural pitch percep-
tion, and of Soen et al. �3�, dealing with spontaneous rhythm
disorders in self-assembled networks of heart cells. Notice
also from the very definition of the problem that we will
refer here to purely dynamical units without any consider-
ation of spatial degrees of freedom. In this respect, we com-
pletely leave apart competition of oscillatory pacemakers in
extended systems as they are common in optical or chemical
self-organizing systems.

Our model is organized hierarchically, i.e., one of the os-
cillators is dominant, making the neutral excitable element to
fire whenever possible, whereas the second one just perturbs
it, leading to its anticipated activation and/or refractoriness.
The outcome is thus a signal from the excitable element with
the underlined periodicity of the dominant pacemaker, but is
sporadically punctuated with missing pulses. To our under-
standing, this description is fundamentally equivalent, but
simpler to analyze than the apparently more natural starting
assumption based on two nonhierarchical oscillators, i.e.,
each of them equally able to ignite the excitable element. On
the other hand, the dynamical scheme constructed in this
way is rendered a little bit more versatile and realistic by
considering a certain degree of stochasticity in its operational
rules. In this respect, we introduce a noise term in the equa-
tions of the second oscillator preventing its perfect periodic
perturbation of the slaved excitable element.

Although our main interest is to formulate a simple and
generic model for a somewhat new concept, that of the ex-
ported competition of two hierarchical oscillators as defined
above, our study is somewhat inspired by the particular class

of cardiac arrhythmia called pure ventricular parasystole �4�.
Essentially, it amounts to a cardiac disordered rhythm caused
by the interaction of two competing and largely independent
oscillators �5�. One is the normal pacemaker, referred to as
sinus or sinoatrial node. The second one is an ectopic focus
located in the ventricles, firing with a larger and more irregu-
lar period than the sinoatrial node. A third neutral excitable
element could mimic the whole ventricular tissue whose sig-
nals are monitored. Systematic statistical studies of such
records have appeared recently in the physics literature �6,7�.

Our approach is based on models presenting saddle-node
bifurcation phenomenology. The generic activator-inhibitor
equations read,

�

where u and v denote the activator and inhibitor adimen-
sional variables, and the function g�u� has the form,

g�u� = AeBu, �2�

with A=0.2 and B=3.0. This choice reproduces the
nullclines of the Morris-Lecar type I model �8–10�. ��t�
would represent a Gaussian white noise of intensity D, with
zero mean and correlation,

���t���t��� = 2D��t − t�� . �3�

The parameter I represents the external input and it controls
the regime, oscillatory or excitable, of this model �oscillatory
for I�2/3 and excitable otherwise�. The function g�u� �Eq.
�2�� has been chosen to have nullclines that intersect each
other as shown in Fig. 1.

In the oscillatory regime, the model allows us, by chang-
ing I, to control the period of firing in a quite wide range. In
Fig. 2, we represent the period, as a function of I, for the
deterministic case �D=0�. It is remarkable that, in spite of
the important differences obtained in the period, the duration
and shape of the pulses remain almost unchanged, as the
inset of Fig. 2 shows for two very distinct periods.

The addition of noise, apart from introducing a certain

degree of irregularity in the time between pulses, leads to a
decrease in the averaged firing period. The induced irregu-
larity can be measured by the normalized variance, R
=����tp�2� / �tp�, where tp are the interpulse intervals and
���tp�

2� its variance. In Fig. 3, we represent R and the period
T= �tp� as a function of the noise intensity. The monotonous
increase of R with respect D is a signature of the oscillatory
regime under noise.

Figure 3 can allow us to choose the adequate range of
noise values in our study. We will concentrate on a region,
from D=10−6 to D=10−5 characterized by very small differ-
ences between periods T, but a quite important variability in
R. This allows us to focus on the effects of the randomness
of the perturbing oscillators but with a very good control of
its mean period.

The explicit model consists of two nonlinear oscillators
whose signals are exported to a neutral excitable element
where they compete. Each of these three elements are essen-
tially modeled by Eqs. �1�–�3�, but with appropriate param-
eters for each one.

with I	2/3 �excitable�. Both normal and ectopic inputs are
introduced in the activator equation through the coupling
terms, �uS and �uE, respectively. In Fig. 4, a diagram of the
different elements and an example of their signals are pre-
sented.

We have numerically integrated the set of Eqs. �4�–�6�,
with the function g�ui� chosen according to Eq. �2�. In gen-
eral, the combined action of the two oscillators on the excit-
able element produces a train of pulses �beats� with period
TS, but with some missing beats �arrhythmia�. An example is
shown in Fig. 5. Defining �t as the time interval between an
ectopic beat and the next normal beat, we observe, in the

panel �b� of this figure, how an ectopic pulse produces the
inhibition of a normal one if �t is smaller than some char-
acteristic time 
. This time 
 does depend on the character-
istics of the excitable element and the coupling parameters �
and �. One expects that, if the pacemaker period TS is equal
or smaller than 
, all ectopic pulses would be effective. This
point will be confirmed later on.

The following definitions are worth introducing. A S beat
will denote an expressed pulse coming from the excitable
element due to the firing of the S oscillator. A V beat, on the
other hand, will correspond to the trace of a missing or un-
expressed S beat in the output signal of the excitable element
�see Fig. 5�. In order to analyze the sequence of pulses, we
evaluate two important characteristics: the V-V interval,
which is the time between two V beats, and the NIB, which
is the number of S beats between two consecutive V beats.

These two characteristics have been analyzed from long
sequences of N=20 000 pulses for several period ratios and
noise intensities. For the determistic situation �D=0�, we ob-
serve, in general, the presence of only three values of NIB.
For example, for TE /TS=3.2, NIB=2,9 ,12. These NIB trip-
lets depend on the period ratio, but always agree with the

rules obtained from circle map models �4�. For TE /TS�3,
only the value NIB=2 is present. This situation changes
when some noise is included. In Fig. 6, we present the nor-
malized histograms of the V-V interval and the NIB, for
TE /TS�3 and two different values of the noise intensity. For
the lower value of noise, the histogram of the V-V intervals
shows a set of equidistant peaks reproducing multiples of TE.
We also observe that only some NIB values are present: 2, 5,
8, 11, … . For a higher value of noise, the V-V intervals
histogram presents a quite different and less defined struc-
ture. Correspondingly, many other values of NIB appear in
the record but the particular indices 2, 5, 8 … still present
relative maxima. It is thus clear that the role of the noise is to
broaden the NIB histogram. This important difference for
both noise intensities is also apparent in the sequences of
pulses shown in Fig. 7. On the other hand, for a fixed value
of noise intensity, the NIB histogram does depend on the
period ratio TE /TS, as can be seen in Fig. 8, where some
different number sequences are observed.

The effectiveness of ectopic beats can be measured by the
relative error, evaluated as the missing beats over total ones
�either expressed or unexpressed�. In spite of the different
rhythms shown in Fig. 7, one can check by simple pulse
counting that the amount of errors for both D values is es-
sentially the same. This fact has been confirmed by analyzing
longer simulations. Thus the error rate does not depend very
much on the noise intensity, but indeed on the relative period
of normal and ectopic beats. In order to study further this
behavior, we have fixed the period TE and have varied TS.
Results are shown in Fig. 9, for three different values of TE.
It is easy to see that, when TS�
, all ectopic inputs are
effective, and then the relative error has to be nV /N=TS /TE.
Figure 9 shows that this situation is reached, as anticipated,
for low enough TS. From this picture, we can estimate the
time 
 using any of the three cases, and a value of 
�3 is
obtained for this set of parameters. In order to analyze the

dependence of 
 on the coupling between the excitable ele-
ment and the ectopic focus, we have calculated the relative
error for several values of parameter �. Some of the results
are presented in Fig. 10. Here TE=11 and TS is changing
over the adequate range for each case. We observe that, as �
increases, the intersection of its corresponding curve with the
limit curve TS /TE occurs for smaller period ratio, which in-
dicates a higher value of time 
. The inset of Fig. 10 shows
the obtained values of 
 as a function of �.

In summary, we have described a new scenario of com-
petition between nonlinear oscillators that consists in their
exported interaction through a common excitable element.
Complex rhythms arise from such a coupling featuring some
resemblances with the disordered records associated to some
particular classes of cardiac arrhythmias. Specific statistical
measures have been evaluated to discern both the role of the
intrinsic firing periods of the competing oscillators as well as
some intrinsic randomness in the system. The advantage with
respect to cycle-map-based models �4� is that our concept of
exported competition can be applied to any dynamical model
exhibiting oscillatory and excitable behavior implementing
competing units. A principal limitation is that we do not take
into account the spatially extended structure, for example, of
the cardiac tissue. Moreover, in this later context, a more
realistic cardiac electrophysiological model would be neces-
sary to reproduce clinical data, but our approach provides a
very promising new perspective to analyze pure parasystole
arhythmias.
