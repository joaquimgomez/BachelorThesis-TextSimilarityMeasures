ABSTRACT

Bubble detachment, rise, and bouncing upon impact with a free surface is studied experimentally in variable gravity
conditions. Previous investigations focused on the effects of fluid properties such as viscosity or surface tension on the
rise and bouncing dynamics. Gravity force is a crucial factor in the detachment, rise and bouncing processes. However,
the effect of different gravity levels has never been studied experimentally. In this paper we analyze the role of gravity
in the detachment, rise velocity and bouncing motion of millimetric bubbles colliding with a free surface. Single air
bubbles in ethanol are detached from a nozzle by the buoyancy force. After reaching a terminal velocity, the rising
bubble interacts with the free surface in a bouncing process prior to coalescence. The equivalent bubble diameter at
detachment decreases as the gravity level increases, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. An expression for
the terminal velocity as a function of gravity is proposed. The terminal velocity is found to increase with the gravity
level, although bubbles are smaller at higher values of gravity. The bouncing process has been modelled by a damped
oscillator, in which the free surface acts as an elastic membrane. An expression for the frequency of bouncing as a
function of gravity has been obtained, showing a good agreement with the experimental results. The motion of the
bubble during the bouncing process can be approximated by an underdamped oscillator even if viscosity is negligible.
Therefore, viscosity is not the main responsible for damping, which is probably due to energy transfer from the bubble
to the fluid in the form of vortex and surface waves generation.

I. INTRODUCTION1

Many industrial applications require the use of bubbly flows2
with controlled dynamics. Hence, the enhancement of the3
understanding of bubble dynamics is essential in order to4
improve the operation of such applications. In particular, the5
collision of bubbles with a gas-liquid interface is a common6
phenomenon in bubbly flows. The dynamics of these interac-7
tions are a key aspect to determine whether the collision will8
result in the formation of foams, flotation aggregates or bubble9
coalescences.10

The collision of a bubble with a free interface depends on11
the characteristics of the bubble rise before impact, which in12
turn depends on the process of detachment from a nozzle.13
The bubble diameter at detachment determines its terminal14
rise velocity, which determines the coalescence or bouncing15
after the collision with the free interface.16

In the present case of study, a millimetric gas bubble is17
released from a nozzle and it rises until it collides with a free18
surface. The overall process can be divided into four stages:19
(i) detachment from the nozzle, (ii) bubble rise, (iii) bouncing20
with the free surface and (iv) bubble coalescence.21

Bubble formation and detachment from a nozzle have been22
studied by many authors over the years. The reader may23
refer to Kulkarni and Joshi (2005) for a detailed review of24
the existing models. Carrera et al. (2006) studied the bubble25
formation in microgravity conditions, reporting that at low gas26

flow rates the bubble size is not uniform and the frequency of 27
bubble generation is very difficult to control. 28

Many attempts to model the bubble shape and terminal 29
velocity in the steady rise have been carried out (Moore, 1965, 30
Tomiyama et al., 1998, Bozzano and Dente, 2001, Rodrigue, 31
2001, de Vries et al., 2002, Kulkarni and Joshi, 2005, Loth, 32
2008, Sanada et al., 2008, Legendre et al., 2012, Maldonado 33
et al., 2013, Suñol and González-Cinca, 2015). However, due 34
to the complexity of the problem, most of the predictions are 35
largely in terms of empirical correlations which are for the 36
most part based on specific test conditions. The application of 37
these correlations to other test conditions may not be valid, in 38
particular when the gravity level is changed. 39

Most of the studies on bubble bouncing carried out up to 40
date consider the collision of a gas bubble with a solid wall 41
(Tsao and Koch, 1997, Klaseboer et al., 2001, Legendre et al., 42
2005, Malysa et al., 2005, Legendre et al., 2006, Zenit and 43
Legendre, 2009, Manica et al., 2014, Klaseboer et al., 2014). 44
In this configuration the bubble bouncing is due uniquely 45
to bubble surface deformations upon impact with the solid 46
wall. However, the collision of a bubble with a free surface 47
is a more complex bouncing process characterized by the 48
deformation of both the bubble shape and the free surface. 49
Sanada et al. (2005) and Suñol and González-Cinca (2010) 50
reported that there is a critical threshold determined by the 51
bubble characteristics that separates the bouncing and non- 52

bouncing regimes of the interaction: the bubble may bounce53
a few times before coalescing, or the bubble may coalesce as54
soon as it reaches the free surface. Air bubbles in ethanol show55
two distinct behaviors when they impact with a free surface56
in normal gravity conditions: bubbles with diameter d < 0.4757
mm coalesce with the free surface immediately after impact,58
while bubbles with d > 0.47 mm bounce a few times before59
coalescence.60

Zawala et al. (2011, 2013) and Kosior et al. (2014) stud-61
ied the bouncing process in resting and vibrating surfaces,62
concluding that highly deformed bubbles, which is related to63
fluid properties, bounce because the liquid film separating the64
gas phases has a large thickness, so that the bubble-interface65
contact time is shorter than the time needed for the film to66
drain.67

The dynamics of the bouncing process of a bubble upon68
impact with a free surface has been properly modelled by69
Sato et al. (2011) using a coupled mass-spring approximation.70
In this model, two springs connected in series are considered.71
One spring corresponds to the bubble shape deformation while72
the other one corresponds to the deformation of the free73
surface. The model contains two parameters that must be74
empirically determined for particular experimental conditions.75
Although the bouncing of a bubble impacting at a solid wall or76
a free surface is a highly dissipative process (Tsao and Koch,77
1997), the model by Sato et al. (2011) does not contain any78
dissipative terms.79

Zawala and Malysa (2011) studied the influence of the80
impact velocity and the size of the water film formed in the81
coalescence of a bubble with a free surface, showing that the82
bubble bounces when the thinning film does not reach its83
rupture thickness during the collision time. The film formed84
by the colliding bubble ruptured for radius smaller than 0.2885
mm. Pigeonneau and Sellier (2011) numerically investigated86
the evolution of both the bubble and the free surface shape by87
means of a boundary-integral method. For weakly deformed88
interfaces (corresponding to high values of the surface tension89
force), the film drainage time was found to be faster than for90
large interface deformations.91

Other investigations on the bubble bouncing process were92

mainly focused on the effects of viscosity in the bouncing 93
dynamics (Sanada et al., 2005), or the effects of salt concen- 94
tration and velocity of approach (Del Castillo et al., 2011). 95
The gravity level is one of the main parameters governing 96
the dynamics of the bubble from its detachment from the 97
nozzle until its coalescence with the free surface. In spite 98
of the importance of gravity in the whole phenomenon, no 99
experimental studies have been carried out up until to analyze 100
its effects. 101

The main objective of this work is to study the effects of 102
gravity on the bubble detachment diameter, terminal velocity 103
and drag coefficient, and to find a relation between the fre- 104
quency of bouncing and the gravity level. The bubble bouncing 105
with a free surface is modelled as a damped oscillator, in which 106
the free surface acts as an elastic membrane and the bubble 107
shape is approximated to be constant. 108

In Sec. II, the experimental setup and procedure are pre- 109
sented. Results on the bubble detachment, bubble steady rise, 110
and the bouncing process are presented in Sec. III. Sec. IV 111
contains the conclusions of this work. 112

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE 113

In order to study the effects of the gravity level on the 114
bouncing of a bubble impacting at a free surface, we designed 115
an experimental setup and run it at the ESA Large Diameter 116
Centrifuge (LDC) of the European Space Agency in ESTEC 117
(Noordwijk, The Netherlands). This platform allows to explore 118
hypergravity levels from 1g0 up to 20g0, where g0 = 9.81 119
m/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level. The LDC 120
allows to reach g = 20g0 only at the bottom of the capsule 121
(“gondola”). 122

The experimental setup integrated in the gondola consists 123
of a test cell, a bubble injection system, and a data acquisition 124
system (Fig 1). The test cell is a tank with a rectangular 125
prism shape of dimensions 140 × 60 × 90 mm3 (height × 126
width × length), with aluminium and methacrylate walls filled 127
with ethanol up to 100 mm. A nozzle (Hamilton RN Needle 128
with with inner diameter dc = 0.15 mm and outer diameter 129
do = 0.8 mm) is placed in the direction of gravity at the 130
center of the tank. The distance between the nozzle tip and the 131

free surface is 22 mm. This distance was chosen as the result132
of the balance between reaching the bubble terminal velocity133
and obtaining a rectilinear vertical path. On the one hand, if134
the distance is smaller than 2 cm, bubbles may not reach the135
terminal velocity before the impact with the free surface. On136
the other hand, if the distance is higher than a few centimeters,137
the Coriolis force can trigger a path instability and bubbles can138
undergo a zig-zag or helical path (Suñol and González-Cinca,139
2015), breaking the axisymmetry of the collision. The tip of140
the nozzle is at 14 cm from the bottom of the gondola. Since141
g = 20g0 is only reached at the bottom of the capsule, we142
decided to change the resulting artificial gravity level from143
1g0 to 19g0 (at the nozzle tip). Air is injected into the tank144
through the nozzle using a syringe pump (KDS Legato 180).145
When a steady flow rate of approximately one bubble every146
five seconds is reached (inertial forces are negligible at this147
flow rate), the data acquisition starts. A gas outlet is placed at148
the top of the tank in order to avoid any overpressure.149

The data acquisition system consists of a high-speed video150
camera, a matrix of 140 ultrabright LED and a diffuser151
sheet. The tank has two methacrylate windows to allow the152
illumination of the inside of the cell from one window and the153
recording of the phenomena of study from the other window.154
LED was chosen as lighting candidate with the aim to avoid155
temperature along the series of experiments, which were con-156
ducted at room temperature. The high-speed camera (RedLake157
Motion Xtra HG-SE) records the detachment, rising, bouncing158
and coalescence processes at 2000 frames per second. The159
spatial resolution of the images is 0.03 mm/pixel. The high-160
speed camera is placed at a height slightly below the free161
surface and tilted an angle of 5◦. This is necessary to avoid162
blurred images of the free surface, and allows the recording163
of both real and mirrored images of the bubble when it is near164
the free surface.165

The high-speed camera and the syringe pump are controlled166
by a fanless computer. An ethernet connection between the167
ground workstation and the computer allowed to remotely168
control the experiment using VNC and LabView software.169

Once the desired artificial gravity level is achieved in the170
LDC, the experimental procedure consists in the following171
steps:172

1) Switching on the illumination and the video camera.173
2) Bubble injection from the nozzle.174

3) Video recording of bubble detachment, rise, and bounc- 175
ing. 176

4) Transfer of the recorded video to the computer. 177
The total required time for these steps is between 5 and 178

8 min. Most of this time is employed for the transfer of the 179
high-speed movie to the computer. The procedure is carried 180
out for each gravity level. 181

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 182

In our experiments, a millimetric gas bubble is injected from 183
the nozzle and rises until it collides with the free surface. 184
The whole process can be divided into four stages: bubble 185
detachment from the nozzle, bubble rise, bubble bouncing 186
with the free surface, and bubble coalescence. We focus our 187
study on the three first stages. Fig. 2 shows a sequence of 188
snapshots of the bubble bouncing and coalescence process. 189
The top row corresponds to a bubble bouncing at g = 2g0, 190
and consecutive frames are separated by a time interval of 191
∆t = 2 ms. The middle row shows a bubble bouncing at 192
g = 5g0, with consecutive frames separated by ∆t = 1 ms. In 193
the bottom row, the gravity level is g = 19g0 and consecutive 194
frames are separated by ∆t = 0.5 ms. In these three cases, the 195
bubble bounces twice before coalescing with the free surface. 196

The number of bounces of each bubble could be pre- 197
dicted if the energy dissipation at each collision was known. 198
Coalescence involves the existence of a drainage time Td 199
of the liquid film formed between the bubble and the free 200
surface. For Tc < Td (where Tc is the contact time between 201
the bubble and the free surface), the bubble will bounce, 202
while for Tc > Td, the bubble will coalesce with the free 203
surface. Tc is usually defined as Tc = d/va, where va is the 204
approach velocity of the bubble to the free surface, and d is 205
the bubble diameter. The bouncing of a bubble with a free 206
surface is a dissipative process. As a consequence, the energy 207
associated with the bubble motion diminishes and the approach 208
velocity va decreases at every bounce until d/va > Td, 209
which results in bubble coalescence with the free surface. 210
The shape and size of the bubble also play a determining role 211
on the coalescence process (Suñol and González-Cinca, 2010, 212
Zawala and Malysa, 2011, Pigeonneau and Sellier, 2011). The 213
drainage time and the approach velocity are closely related to 214
the size and shape of the bubble. The drainage time increases 215

for larger bubbles, and decreases if the difference between216
the curvatures of the bubble and the free surface is high. Our217
study is focussed on the bubble detachment and rise, and on218
the dynamics of the bouncing process prior to coalescence,219
rather than on the coalescence itself.220

Pictures in Fig. 2 show a decrease in the bubble diameter as221
the gravity level is increased. This is due to the fact that the222
buoyancy force is higher at higher gravity levels, while the223
surface tension force is constant. The bubble detaches from224
the nozzle when buoyancy equals the surface tension force,225
hence the bubble is smaller at higher gravity levels.226

Fig. 3 shows the position of the bubble center as a function227
of time for g = 5g0. The time needed for the bubble to reach a228
steady rise is approximately 10 ms after the detachment. From229
this time the bubble rises with a constant terminal velocity230
until it collides with the free surface. After the collision, the231
bubble bounces twice before coalescence occurs.232

A. Bubble detachment233

While the syringe is pumping air, a bubble grows attached234
to the nozzle until it detaches when the forces directed down-235
wards equal the forces directed upwards. In our experiments,236
the drag and inertial terms were negligible since air was237
injected at a very low flow rate (approximately 1 bubble every238
5 seconds). A competition takes place between the surface239
tension force, Fσ , which keeps the bubble attached to the240
nozzle, and the buoyancy force Fb, which pushes the bubble241
upwards. The buoyancy force is proportional to the bubble242
volume, which increases linearly in time, while the surface243
tension force is constant. Bubble detaches when Fb = Fσ:244

It should be noted that Eq. 2 gives accurate results only if the 251
needle used for bubble formation is completely wetted by a 252
liquid and the bubble is formed at the inner diameter dc. 253

In order to obtain experimentally the bubble equivalent di- 254
ameter, we approximated the bubble shape as an axisymmetric 255
ellipsoid with vertical diameter dv and horizontal diameter dh, 256
where dv and dh can be measured from the images recorded 257
in the steady rise. Since the bubble equivalent diameter is, by 258
definition, the diameter of a spherical bubble containing the 259
same volume as the ellipsoid (πd3/6 = πd2hdv/6), it can be 260
expressed as 261

Fig. 4 shows the bubble diameter as a function of the 262
normalized gravity level. The capillary length C` =

is also plotted for comparison. A very good agreement between 264
the experimental data and the prediction of Eq. 2 is obtained. 265
This confirms that neglecting drag and inertial forces is a 266
reasonable approximation for the current configuration. 267

B. Bubble rise 268

Once the bubble is detached from the nozzle, it starts to 269
accelerate vertically until the drag force Fd equals the buoy- 270
ancy force Fb. At this moment a steady state is attained and 271
the bubble properties remain constant. The main parameters 272
governing the bouncing/coalescence processes with the free 273
surface are the bubble approach velocity (terminal velocity) 274
and the shape of the bubble and the interface. 275

1) Terminal velocity: A relation between the terminal ve- 276
locity and the gravity level can be obtained from the analysis 277
of forces in the bubble rise. During the steady rise, the drag 278
force counteracts buoyancy, Fd = Fb: 279

In order to obtain Cd as a function of the gravity level,288
we can use the approach by Mendelson (1967) and Tomiyama289
et al. (1998), in which the existence of the bubble is considered290
as a disturbance on the gas-liquid interface. Neglecting the291
viscosity of the liquid (160 ≤ Re ≤ 237 in our experiments),292
the disturbance propagates through the liquid in the form of a293

where λ is the wavelength. Defining θ as the angle between295
the vertical direction and any point in the bubble interface, the296
velocity component normal to the interface vN is a sinusoidal297
function of θ, with period 2π. As a result, one can regard the298
bubble as a source of a wave with wavelength λ = πd. This is299
valid even for non-spherical bubbles. Postulating that the phase300
velocity is equal to the terminal velocity in inviscid conditions301
(see Tomiyama et al. (1998) for a physical argumentation of302
this postulate), the wavelength relation introduced in Eq. 7303

Lehrer Lehrer (1976) argued that during rise, the potential307
energy of the bubble is converted into kinetic energy followed308
by its dissipation in the wake, which results in a slightly309

Eqs. 11 and 13 contain the required relation between the 317
drag coefficient and the gravity level. 318

In order to experimentally obtain the bubble terminal veloc- 319
ity, we have measured the time interval t needed for a bubble 320
to rise a given number of pixels z, in the steady rise region. 321

Fig. 5 shows the bubble terminal velocity as a function of 322
the normalized gravity level. The terminal velocity is found to 323
increase as the gravity level is increased. This is the expected 324
behavior for a fixed bubble size, but we must keep in mind 325
that in our experiments the size of the bubble decreases as the 326
gravity level is increased. As a consequence, the behavior of 327
the terminal velocity as a function of gravity for bubble size 328
determined by natural detachment is a priori unknown. 329

The experimental measurements are slightly above the the- 330
oretical prediction of Eq. 8. Lehrer’s (Lehrer, 1976) modifica- 331
tion of Eq. 8 by energy balance arguments, resulting in Eq. 9, 332
becomes a better prediction of the obtained data. Experimental 333
results show a good agreement with Eq. 9 for g > 10g0. 334
However, for lower gravity values there is a deviation between 335
the experimental data and the theoretical prediction of Eq. 9. 336
This could be due to the fact that the conversion from potential 337
to kinetic energy in Lehrer’s argumentation is somehow more 338
efficient at higher bubble terminal velocities. Therefore, the 339
prediction for g < 10g0 could be a combination between 340
Eqs. 8 and 9, which has not been developed theoretically up 341
to date. 342

Solving for the drag coefficient in Eq. 5, one can obtain its 343
experimental values by measuring the bubble diameter and the 344
bubble terminal velocity. 345

Fig. 6 shows the drag coefficient as a function of the Eötvös 346
number. It can be noted that Eq. 13 is a better fit to the 347
experimental data than Eq. 11. This behavior can be expected 348
from Fig. 5, since Eq. 9 (and correspondingly, Eq. 13), shows 349
a better prediction for the terminal velocity. 350

2) Bubble shape: The bubble shape in the steady rise region 351
is determined from the competition between inertial forces 352
and surface tension forces. Hence, the Weber number (defined 353
as We = ρdv2T /σ) becomes an appropriate dimensionless 354
number to characterize the bubble shape. The bubble aspect 355
ratio � = dh/dv is plotted as a function of gravity in Fig. 7. 356
The effects of gravity on the bubble aspect ratio do not reflect 357

plotted in Fig. 7 correspond to bubbles of decreasing size as359
the normalized gravity level increases. In case the bubbles had360
the same size in all gravity levels, we would have expected361
the aspect ratio to increase with g/g0 (flatter bubbles at larger362
gravity levels).363

By employing a potential flow solution over an ellipsoid,364
an implicit relation between the aspect ratio and the Weber365

explained in a similar way as in Fig. 7. Eqs. 15 and 16 376
are only applicable to bubbles of the same size and different 377
aspect ratio. Furthermore, the discrepancies could be caused 378
by the unknown hydrodynamic boundary conditions at the 379
bubble surface. As reported recently, the bubble surface in 380
the considered system can be partially or even completely slip 381
(Basarová et al., 2018). 382

From the examination of the above results, we are not able 383
to make any clear statement about the effects of the gravity 384
level on the bubble shape. 385

C. Bubble bouncing 386

Fig. 9 shows the position of the bubble center as a function 387
of time for g = 5g0 during the bouncing process. The time 388
interval between the first impact and the final coalescence is 389
approximately 15 ms. 390

When a bubble bounces upon impact with a free surface, 391
both the bubble and the free surface become deformed. Sato 392
et al. (2011) modelled this process by means of a mass-spring 393
approximation consisting in two springs connected in series. 394
One spring with stiffness K1 accounts for the bubble defor- 395
mation, and the other spring with stiffness K2 corresponds 396
to the free surface deformation. Two limiting cases can be 397
considered. 398



7

On the one hand, the limit K1 � K2 corresponds to a399
deformable bubble colliding with a solid wall. In this case,400
the frequency of the bubble bouncing can be approximated by401
the frequency of the second mode of an oscillating bubble in402
an unbounded fluid (Lamb, 1932):403

ω = 4

√
6σ

ρd3
. (17)

This frequency of bubble bouncing coincides with the404
frequency of a drop bouncing on a wall in a liquid (Legendre405
et al., 2005).406

On the other hand, the limit K1 � K2 corresponds to a407
bubble with an arbitrary shape colliding with a deformable408
free surface, which acts as an elastic membrane.409

The model used by Sato et al. (2011) does not contain any410
dissipative terms. However, the process of bubble bouncing411
with a solid wall or a free surface is a highly dissipative412
process (Tsao and Koch, 1997). Therefore, the process of413
bubble bouncing with a free surface can be approximated as414
a collision between a bubble with an arbitrary shape and an415
elastic membrane (which corresponds to the second limiting416
case), with a dissipative term. Our approximation is then417
related to a forced damped oscillator model:418

where m is the added mass of the bubble, c is a damping419
coefficient (proportional to the fluid viscosity), K is the stiff-420
ness of the free surface (proportional to the surface tension),421
and Fb is the buoyancy force. Since the added mass and the422
buoyancy force are proportional to the bubble volume, we can423
rewrite Eq. 18 in the form424

z̈ + 2ζω0ż + ω
2
0z = χ, (19)

where χ is a constant acceleration due to buoyancy, ζ is425
a dissipative term, and ω0 is the natural frequency of the426
harmonic oscillator. The solution of Eq. 19 in the underdamped427
case is428

z(t) = z0 + h0 exp(−ω0ζt) sin (ωt+ ϕ) , (20)

where ω = ω0
√

1− ζ2 is the frequency of the bubble429
bouncing and h0 exp(−ω0ζt) is the amplitude. Eq. 20 will430
be used to obtain the experimental values of ω and hn (where431
hn is the amplitude of the nth bounce), with z0, h0, ω0ζ, ω432
and ϕ as fitting parameters.433

Eq. 20 will be used to obtain the experimental values of434
bouncing frequency (ω) and amplitude hn (where hn is the435
amplitude of the nth bounce), with z0, h0, ω0ζ, ω and ϕ as436
fitting parameters.437

1) Frequency of bouncing: In order to obtain a theoretical438
prediction for the frequency of bouncing, we assume that the439
free surface acts as an elastic membrane driven by capillary440
and gravity forces. Taking into account the effects of viscosity,441
the general dispersion relation for a capillary-gravity driven442
wave can be written as a complex equation (Lamb, 1932,443

Introducing Eq. 2 into Eq. 23, we obtain an implicit relation 452

numerical solution of this relation is plotted in Fig. 10. 454

An explicit relation between ω and g can be obtained in the 455
inviscid case. Neglecting the viscosity, the dispersion relation 456

Eq. 25 together with Eq. 2 results in an explicit relation 459

Note that from Eq. 24, the definition of the phase velocity 461
vp = ω/k, and the relation k = 2π/λ = 2/d, we recover the 462
result for the terminal velocity obtained by Mendelson (1967): 463

which has been solved numerically, together with the relation 470

The experiments analyzed here are in a region of low 473
Reynolds number (160 ≤ Re ≤ 237), hence, in the inviscid 474
regime. This is clearly manifested in Fig. 10, in which the 475
plot of Eq. 23 and Eq. 25 obtained from our data overlap, as 476
happens with the plot of Eq. 27 and Eq. 28. 477

data have been fitted to Eq. 20, with z0, h0, ω0ζ, ω and ϕ as481
fitting parameters. The data used for the fit are the circled-482
crossed points in Fig. 9. The rest of the points have been483
excluded to the fit since they are in the steady rise region484
or in the coalescence region. (ii) For g > 8g0, there are not485
enough data points to make a reliable fit. Therefore, ω has486
been obtained from the time t that a bubble needs to complete487
a period, ω = 2π/t. The experimental frequency of buoyancy488
fits better in Eqs. 27 and 28 than in Eqs. 23 and 25. This489
confirms, as was obtained in Fig. 5, that the terminal velocity490
in Eq. 9 predicts better the experimental behavior than the491
prediction of Eq. 8, for g > 10g0.492

In summary, viscosity does not affect the frequency of493
bouncing. Moreover, the bubble trajectory can be approxi-494
mated by an underdamped oscillator, although damping is495
not caused by viscosity. Damping could be caused by energy496
transfer from the bubble to the fluid in form of vortex gen-497
eration and surface waves. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)498
measurements would be of interest to support this hypothesis.499

2) Amplitude of bouncing: The amplitude damping in our500
model is characterized by the coefficient ω0ζ (Eq. 20). Experi-501
mental data are fitted to the model only for g ≤ 7g0 due to the502
lack of sufficient data for g > 8g0. The damping coefficient is503
one of the fitting parameters. No conclusive effect of gravity504
on the damping coefficient has been found for the considered505
range of gravity level. Presumably, the damping coefficient506
only depends on the fluid properties (unless some kind of507
energy transfer to the fluid occurs), hence it is independent508
of the gravity level.509

After the first bounce, the bubble velocity becomes negative510
until the bubble center reaches its lowest position before511
rising again. In this second rise phase, the bubble reaches an512
approach velocity lower than the terminal velocity, va < vT .513
The amplitude of the first bounce, h1, is given by the position514
of the bubble center at its lowest point after the first bounce.515
Suñol and González-Cinca (2010), measured in normal gravity516
conditions the amplitude of the first bounce as a function of the517
bubble equivalent diameter in ethanol, and found two distinct518

between the amplitude of the first bounce and the bubble 521
diameter was derived: 522

h1 = (0.72± 0.03)d− (0.08± 0.04). (29)

Extending this result to hypergravity conditions, we can 523
introduce Eq. 2 in the above relation, to predict the behavior 524
of h1 as a function of the gravity level. Fig.11 shows the 525
amplitude of the first bounce as a function of the gravity level. 526
It is important to note that for Figs 10 and 11, each data point 527
refers to a different bubble size, thus graphs do not actually 528
represent the effect of gravity on the frequency and amplitude 529
of bouncing for a fixed bubble size. The measured values of h1 530
are slightly lower than those given by the prediction, specially 531
for high gravity levels. An increase of the energy dissipation 532
at high gravity levels could be the cause of this discrepancy. 533
However, there are no available models to quantify such 534
dissipation. 535

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS 536

We have studied the effects of the gravity level on the bubble 537
detachment from a nozzle, steady rise, and bouncing upon 538
impact with a free surface. 539

The bubble detachment size has been found to decrease as 540
the gravity level increases, in very good agreement with the 541
prediction based on the competition between buoyancy and 542
surface tension forces. 543

The terminal velocity in the bubble rise increases with 544
gravity, although the bubble size is smaller at higher gravity 545
levels. A good agreement between the experimental results and 546
the prediction by wave analogy has been obtained. 547

No clear effects of the gravity level on the bubble shape 548
have been obtained. 549

Concerning the dynamics of bubble bouncing, we have 550
modelled the system as a damped oscillator with the free 551
surface acting as an elastic membrane. The experimental 552
determination of the frequency of bouncing as a function of 553
the gravity level showed a very good agreement with the 554
theoretical prediction. The amplitude of the first bounce has 555
been found to decrease as the gravity level increases. However, 556
the bubble size varies for each gravity level, hence the effects 557



9

of gravity on the frequency and amplitude of bouncing for a558
fixed bubble size remains unknown. Finally, we have observed559
that the motion of the bubble can be approximated by that560
of an underdamped oscillator even if viscosity is negligible.561
This reflects that the viscosity is not the main responsible for562
damping.563

It would be of interest to consider bubbles of different size564
at a fixed gravity level in future experiments. This would allow565
to test the existing theoretical models, with a changing gravity566
level, in terms of dimensionless numbers. The study of liquids567
with different properties can also be of interest. In addition,568
a study of the restitution coefficient and the drainage time,569
would help to predict the number of bounces. The restitution570
coefficient gives an idea of the amount of kinetic energy lost571
in each bounce, so we could be able to predict the approach572
velocity, and hence the contact time, on the next bounce.573
