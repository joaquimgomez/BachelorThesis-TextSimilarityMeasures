During cardiac diseases many types of anatomical and functional remodeling of cardiac

tissue can occur. In this work, we focus on two conditions: hypoxia and fibrosis, which

are part of complex pathological modifications that take place in many cardiac diseases

(hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, and recurrent myocardial

infarction) and respiratory diseases (obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep

apnea, and cystic fibrosis). Using computational models of cardiac electrophysiology,

we evaluate if the interplay between hypoxia and fibrosis is sufficient to trigger cardiac

arrhythmia. We study the mechanisms behind the generation of ectopic beats, an

arrhythmic trigger also known as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), in regions

with high hypoxia and fibrosis. First, wemodify an electrophysiological model of myocytes

of the human left ventricle to include the effects of hypoxia. Second, diffuse fibrosis is

modeled by randomly replacing cardiac myocytes by non-excitable and non-conducting

cells. The Monte Carlo method is used to evaluate the probability of a region to generate

ectopic beats with respect to different levels of hypoxia and fibrosis. In addition, we

evaluate the minimum size of three-dimensional slabs needed to sustain reentries for

different stimulation protocols. The observed mechanism behind the initiation of ectopic

beats is unidirectional block, giving rise to sustained micro-reentries inside the region with

diffuse fibrosis and hypoxia. In summary, our results suggest that hypoxia and fibrosis are

sufficient for the creation of a focal region in the heart that generates PVCs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular diseases frequently promote life-threatening arrhythmias. For some diseases,
studies suggest the existence of anatomical triggers for dangerous arrhythmias (de Bakker et al.,
1988; Haïssaguerre et al., 1998; Ng, 2006; Jalife, 2011). These pathological regions would repeatedly
re-excite the neighboring cardiac tissue, acting as sources, drivers, or foci of ectopic beats. Any area
of the heart other than the sinoatrial node, which originates a heart beat is an ectopic pacemaker.
In particular, when the region is in the left ventricle, it is the source of premature ventricular
contractions (PVCs) (Boineau and Cox, 1973; Ruberman et al., 1977).

Sachetto et al. Ectopic Beats Due to Hypoxia and Fibrosis

In this work, we use a computational model of the human
left ventricle to investigate the generation of ectopic beats in a
heterogeneous cardiac region under hypoxia and with diffuse
fibrosis. Hypoxia accounts for the lack of blood supply for
the cardiac tissue, whereas fibrosis is related to the increase
of collagen and fibroblast as a reparative or reactive process.
Hypoxia can significantly change cardiac electrophysiology and
fibrotic regions are non-conducting and non-exciting areas that
increase the conduction heterogeneity of cardiac tissue.

The number, diversity and types of processes in cardiac
diseases that result on functional or anatomical modifications can
be overwhelming, as well as the complexity of their multifaceted
interactions. Nevertheless, these two processes, hypoxia and
fibrosis, are common in many different cardiac diseases and
have been suggested to be related to cardiac arrhythmia. For
instance, there is a variety of diseases that can compromise
the micro-structure of cardiac tissue in the ventricles via
the process of fibrosis. This is the case in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) (Maron, 2002), hypertensive heart
disease (HHD) (Diamond and Phillips, 2005), and myocardial
infarction (MI) (Schmidt et al., 2007). In turn, these diseases, all
with the substrate of fibrosis, can also, due to different reasons,
induce hypoxia or acute ischemia, and trigger fatal arrhythmias.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause
of sudden death in young athletes. It is characterized by
cardiac andmyocyte hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, and fibrosis.
Sudden cardiac death may be the first manifestation of the
disease. Approximately 70% of all patients with HCM die
suddenly (Maron et al., 1995; Ho et al., 2010; Namboodiri
and Francis, 2010; Alkon et al., 2012). The high arrhythmic
propensity in HCM is due to the combination of the abnormal
substrate, like fibrosis, and ischemia or hypoxia (Alkon et al.,
2012), in general associated with intense physical exercise.
Extreme physical exercise may induce, in HCM patients,
diastolic pressure and volume overload of the ventricles, and
hypoxemia, i.e., low oxygen saturation in the blood. These can
result in a transitory ischemia, usually near the endocardial
region. Ventricular arrhythmias related with exercise are strongly
correlated to cardiac fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (van Rijsingen et al., 2011). The arrhythmias
originate from areas with a high extent of fibrosis or from regions
directly adjacent to these areas.

Hypertensive heart disease comprises of structural, functional,
and endothelial processes that alter coronary hemodynamics
and ventricular function. As in HCM, ventricular enlargement
or hypertrophy is also combined with fibrosis. In addition,
changes in coronary arterial flow involve ventricular wall
compression, luminal obstruction, the increased wall thickening
of the hypertensive arteriole and reduced ventricular wall
vascularity (Frohlich, 2001). These pathophysiological changes
are frequently associated with ischemic heart disease and the
combination with the fibrotic substrate increases the risk of
sudden cardiac death (Frohlich, 2000).

Most of myocardial infarction (MI) involves the occlusion
of a coronary artery of the ventricle or other types of coronary
artery diseases. In the acute phase, ischemia and necrosis (Chiong
et al., 2011) appear. Early revascularization and the use of new

medicaments greatly contribute to improve survival to acute MI.
During the healing phase of MI, fibrosis substitutes necrotic
cells (Shi et al., 2017). However, post-MI patients remain at
substantial risk for ventricular arrhythmias (Pouleur et al., 2010).
In fact, most of the deaths in post-MI patients are due to
arrhythmia and recurrentMI, i.e., a second episode of acuteMI at
the same region of the first one (Ørn et al., 2005). Therefore, once
again, we recognize the existence of a heterogeneous substrate
that involves fibrosis from the first MI episode, hypoxia and
ischemia during the recurrent MI, and the relation to fatal
arrhythmias.

The aforementioned cardiac diseases suggest a sequence of
events: structural changes that involve fibrosis are followed
by hypoxia or ischemia, that in turn results in cardiac
arrhythmia. However, the relation between fibrosis and hypoxia
is not trivial. For instance, some respiratory diseases that
involve chronic, transitory, or intermittent hypoxia induce
the process of fibrosis in cardiac tissue, and increase the
occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. Studies in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive
sleep apnea (OSA), and with cystic fibrosis (CF) have shown
that low oxygen saturation during exercise may predispose them
to cardiac ventricular arrhythmias (Cheong et al., 1990; Ruf
and Hebestreit, 2009; Cintra et al., 2010). Cardiac arrhythmia
has been also reported in patients with sleep apnea syndrome
(SAS) (Guilleminault et al., 1983). In turn, chronic hypoxia
induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis in
the LV myocardium (Miwa and Sasaguri, 2007; Yamashita
et al., 2007). In fact, cardiac fibrosis can develop from different
stimuli, including ischemia, inflammation, pressure overload
and volume overload. A common feature of all these stimuli
is tissue hypoxia, either directly or indirectly, due to increase
of oxygen consumption by infiltrating inflammatory cells and
activated resident cells (Gao et al., 2014). This process is referred
as hypoxia-induced fibrosis and has been a recent important
topic of research (Darby and Hewitson, 2016). During chronic
hypoxia and pathological repair, the hypoxia pathway might be
responsible for driving the process of fibrosis (Watson et al., 2013;
Shi et al., 2017).

In summary, hypoxia and fibrosis in the heart appear in
many cardiovascular diseases, HCM, HHD, Recurrent MI, and
respiratory diseases, COPD, OSA, CF, SAS. In addition, all these
diseases are related to cardiac arrhythmias. In this paper, we use
a computational model to investigate if the combination of these
two pathological processes, hypoxia and fibrosis, is sufficient for
the genesis of ectopic beats, a known trigger for life-threatening
arrhythmias.

We modified an electrophysiological model of myocytes of
the left ventricle (Ten Tusscher and Panfilov, 2006) to include
the effects of hypoxia as previously presented in Shaw and
Rudy (1997). Diffuse fibrosis is modeled by randomly replacing
cardiac myocytes by non-excitable and non-conducting cells.
This approach has been employed in a large number of scientific
studies to model fibrosis in ventricular (Ten Tusscher and
Panfilov, 2007; McDowell et al., 2011; Kazbanov et al., 2016) and
atrial (Cherry et al., 2007; McDowell et al., 2015; Alonso et al.,
2016) tissues. This approach is justified due to: the lack of a

Sachetto et al. Ectopic Beats Due to Hypoxia and Fibrosis

non-invasive technique that can capture the 3D micro-structure
of a region with fibrosis; and the complex, distinct and almost
unpredictable patterns of fibrosis as identified by histological
images (Boineau and Cox, 1973; Campos et al., 2012). As we
include this random feature in our simulations, the Monte Carlo
method is used to calculate the probability of an injured region
to behave as an ectopic pacemaker, assuming that two values
characterize the injured tissue: the percentage of fibrosis and the
degree of hypoxia.

The results of our simulations suggest that injured regions
with both hypoxia and fibrosis generate ectopic beats.
Simulations considering only one of these two processes,
i.e., only hypoxia or only fibrosis, do not show ectopic beats.
The mechanism behind the generation of ectopic beats is
unidirectional block, which triggers sustained micro-reentries
inside the region with diffuse fibrosis and hypoxia. The analysis
of the probability distributions reveals that the simulations that
generate ectopic beats have a percentage of fibrosis between
37 and 65%. In addition, the highest probability of ectopic
beat formation is obtained for percentages of fibrosis near
the percolation threshold, a pure topological metric. This is
in agreement with previous results (Alonso and Bär, 2013;
Gouvêa de Barros et al., 2015; Alonso et al., 2016). We also
observe that the probability increases with the level of hypoxia,
i.e., the scenario with most severe hypoxia is the one with highest
probability of generation of ectopic beats. Finally, we study
how reentries and ectopic beats depend on: (1) the shape of the
simulated tissue, cubic vs. rectangular; (2) the total size of the
tissue; and (3) the protocol to introduce the action potential wave
into the injured tissue.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1. Modeling Normal and Cardiac
Myocytes During Hypoxia
In order to model the cellular dynamics in our computational
experiments, we consider the ten Tusscher model (TT3) of
human ventricle myocyte electrophysiology (Ten Tusscher and
Panfilov, 2006). For the dynamics of the cellular transmembrane
potential (V) the following ion currents are considered:

Cm
∂V

∂t
= Iion = INa + IK1 + Ito + IKr + IKs + ICaL+ (1)

INaCa + INaK + IpCa + IpK + IbCa + IbNa + IKATP;

where Cm is the membrane capacitance. Note that Iion includes
currents from ion channels, exchangers and pumps. Almost all
currents depend on the transmembrane potential and on gating
variables, η, of the Hodgkin-Huxley type.

We modified the ten Tusscher et al. model (Ten Tusscher
and Panfilov, 2006) to simulate hypoxia by introducing a K+

current activated by Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) called IK(ATP)
and modifying the PCa(L) conductivity to be also dependent on
ATP. This formulation for modeling hypoxia was introduced
before in Shaw and Rudy (1997), although similar alternative
formulations are also possible (Kazbanov et al., 2014).

Different degrees of Hypoxia can be simulated by changing
the values of [ATPi] from normal (6 mM) to acute (2 mM).
According to Shaw and Rudy (1997), this ranges are likely to
occur also during acute ischemia. Table 1 shows the impact of
the reduction of [ATPi], due to hypoxia on the properties of
Action Potential Duration (APD), velocity of action potential
propagation, and wave length. Whereas APD depends on the
level of hypoxia, velocity is basically constant, as can be seen in
Table 1.

2.2. Action Potential Propagation on
Cardiac Tissue
The coupling of cells in three-dimensional tissues is modeled
with themonodomain formulation, which is given in terms of the
transmembrane potential V and the vector of state variables, η:

βCm
∂V

∂t
+ βIion(V , η) = ∇ · (σ∇V)+ Istim, (2)

∂η

∂t
= f (V , η), (3)

where β is the surface-volume ratio, Cm is the membrane
capacitance, Iion the total ion current, Istim is the current due to an
external stimulus, and σ is the monodomain conductivity tensor.
Themodel is further equipped with appropriate initial conditions
and no–flux boundary conditions (n · σ∇V = 0), i.e., the
boundary of the tissue is considered to be isolated.

In order to solve the monodomain equations and simulate the
action potential propagation in the heterogeneous tissue we used
an efficient parallel cardiac solver described in Sachetto Oliveira
et al. (2017). This solver uses the Rush-Larsen method to
solve the ODEs associated with the TT3 model and the finite
volumes method do solve the partial differential equation (PDE)
(Equation 2), and can be configured to disconnect a random
percentage φ of (100µm)3 volumes, allowing us to model diffuse
fibrosis, as described next. The time step (1t) was set to 0.02 ms
for the numerical solution of both ODEs and PDE.

2.3. Model of Fibrosis
Different types of fibrosis can be observed depending on its
spatial distribution (Nguyen et al., 2014): compact, interstitial,
patchy, and diffuse. In this work, we consider diffuse fibrosis,
which corresponds to the distribution of fibrotic tissue among
myocytes in such a way fibrotic and normal tissues are
interleaved, forming a complex maze.

Sachetto et al. Ectopic Beats Due to Hypoxia and Fibrosis

We model diffuse fibrosis by randomly removing active
tissue volumes of the size of (100µm)3 creating completely
disconnected inert regions. The (100µm)3 is roughly the length
of individual cells in the longitudinal direction of the tissue. Such
approach has been extensively employed before (Ten Tusscher
and Panfilov, 2007; Alonso and Bär, 2013; Kazbanov et al., 2016;
Vigmond et al., 2016) to study the formations of ectopic beats and
reentries in the tissue. The maze of conducting tissue mixed with
fibrosis produces fractionated AP propagation.

Fibrosis is modeled via the parameter σ in Equation (2). If the
fraction of fibrosis in a particular region is φ, we assign σ = 0 to a
given cell with a probability of φ. A cell with σ = 0 is considered
inactive and disconnected from the surrounding cells.

When the fraction φ of fibrosis is high, action potential does
not propagate through the tissue. On the other hand, action
potential wave propagates when the fraction is small. There are
intermediate values of φ where these two regimes clash and
waves are able to propagate in a certain direction but not in
the opposite direction due to source-sink mismatches, giving
rise to unidirectional blocks responsible for the breakup of the
propagating waves. Such effect depends also on the level of ionic
remodeling due to hypoxia in the tissue. As explained before, in
order to model the degree of hypoxia we change the value of
[ATPi].

2.4. Calculation of Percolation Threshold
Waves break in a window of values of the fibrosis fraction in
the tissue (φ). The window of values is close to the percolation
threshold of the grid. Such value corresponds to the maximum
fraction of fibrosis at which there is still a path composed of
healthy cells connecting one side to the other of the system.
Typical theoretical calculations of percolation threshold are done
for large systems involving a huge number of cells and therefore,
finite sizes effects are discarded. However, a fibrotic region has
a finite size and its format or geometry may influence the results.
For this reason, we statistically calculate the percolation threshold
for the next two types of geometries:

• A rectangular slab of tissue of horizontal lengths 4 × 4 cm2

and different thickness: from a single layer (formally a two
dimensional grid of cells) to around 25 layers of cells, see
Figure 1A.

• A cubic domain formed by aN3 cells, where we vary the length
N from 2 cells to around 30, see Figure 1B.

For each pair (N,φ) we randomly generate 100 different
heterogeneous grids and evaluate numerically if the generated
models permit the wave propagation from one side to the other.
With the results, percolation threshold, φth, is calculated via
linear interpolation. The resulting dependence of φth on N is
presented in Figure 1. As previously noted, for a single layer we
approach the two-dimensional limit, see Figure 1A. For slabs
with thickness higher than 20 layers the resulting value of φth
is already close to the theoretical three-dimensional limit value,
see Figure 1A. For cubic domains the three-dimensional limit
is the same that in the previous case for large systems, see
Figure 1B. However, for small system the behavior differs from
the two-dimensional limit, see Figure 1B.

FIGURE 1 | Percolation threshold of a rectangular slab of tissue composed by

regular cubic grid of cells for different thickness N in a system 400× 400× N

(A) and cubic system for different lengths of the cube N× N× N (B). For

comparison the analytic limits corresponding to infinite two and three

dimensional systems are shown (red lines). Numerical fit (solid blue line) has

been calculate to guide the eye and permit to extrapolate to possible higher

values of N. For comparison, (B) also presents the results of (A) in gray.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Rectangular Slab With a Central
Injured Region
First we consider a rectangular slab of healthy tissue with a
circular injured region with fibrosis and hypoxia, as shown
in Figures 2A–H. If this injured region is small enough, the
action potential wave rapidly propagates around, enters from
the whole border and excites the whole injured region almost
simultaneously. However, if the injured region is large, the wave
enters first from the left (from the stimulus side). Since the rest of
the border is excited later, propagation in this case is mainly from
left to right. If the fraction φ of fibrosis is close to the percolation
limit of the grid (Alonso and Bär, 2013; Alonso et al., 2016) the
waves propagate slower inside the injured region in comparison
with the speed on the healthy tissue, see Figures 2C,D. This
propagation inside the injured region is highly irregular and
continuous break-ups and fusions of waves can occur, see
Figures 2C–E. For a certain random combination of cells, the
tissue forms source-sink mismatches and unidirectional blocks,
i.e., the wave can not propagate from left to right, but can
propagate later in the opposite direction (right to left), see
Figures 2F,G. The resulting wave in the injured region arrives to
the left border and can re-excite the healthy tissue giving rise to
an ectopic beat, see Figure 2H. If the leaving wave interacts with
a previous wave it can break and generate a rotor. A video of this
simulation can be found in the Supplementary Material.

The generation of reentries depends on different factors, such
as the degree of fibrosis and hypoxia. In simulations considering
only one of these two processes, i.e., only hypoxia or only fibrosis,
ectopic beats are not observed. The fraction of fibrosis of the
tissue has to be close to the percolation value of the discrete grid

action potential.

of cells, see Figure 1. Figure 3 shows the probability distribution
of reentries as function of the fraction φ for different thickness of
the slab.

We have analyzed three degrees of hypoxia for different
thickness of the slab, see Figure 3. With low degree of hypoxia
([ATPi] = 4mM) reentries are very unlikely to occur and
appear for values of φ close to the percolation threshold. For
severe hypoxia ([ATPi] = 2mM) there is a higher probability of
reentries which occur in a wider window of values of the fraction
of fibrosis.

3.2. Rectangular Slab With Fibrosis and
Hypoxia
The size of the injured region is relevant in the formation
of sustained reentries. We perform several simulations using
different tissue sizes to demonstrate this relation. First we
increase the injured region to cover the whole tissue and a wave
is induced at the border of the system for different degrees of
fibrosis and hypoxia. The results are shown in Figure 4 and are
comparable with the results obtained with a restricted circular
injured region shown in Figure 3.

Although the probability of reentries are systematically higher
when the whole slab is injured, the range of fibrosis with reentries
is basically the same. The probability of reentries increases with
the thickness of the slab and, for 10 layers of cells, the probability
of reentry for high degree of hypoxia arrives at 100% for several
values of φ, as we can see in Figure 4C.

3.3. Minimum Size of a 2D Injured
Rectangular Slab That Sustains Reentries
The difference between the probabilities of reentry obtained
in Figure 3, 4 is due to the difference of size of the injured
region. Whereas, for example, in Figure 3A the total injured

area is 6.16 cm2, in Figure 3A the injured area is the whole slab,
corresponding to 16 cm2.

Next we study theminimum area needed to generate reentries.
We use a single layer rectangular slab (2D) and reduce its
size systematically. We evaluate the probability of reentries for
different values of φ keeping [ATPi] = 2mM. The same approach
is used in the next sections.

We obtain one reentry over one hundred tries for φ = 0.38
and φ = 0.40 in a system formed by 7 × 7mm2 square (see
Figure 5A). However, we did not find any reentry in smaller
systems. Note that as our tissue mesh is formed by finite volumes
of (100µm)3 , the total number of volumes in such minimum
system is 4900.

A comparison between a reentry in the smallest tissue and a
typical reentry in a much bigger system is shown in Figure 5.
Whereas, for the first case, the excitation can propagate inside the
injured region without a clear structure, i.e., in a very fractionated
fashion, the reentry shown in the big injured region appears with
a well defined shape.

3.4. Minimum Size of a 3D Injured
Rectangular Slab That Sustains Reentries
One could consider that the total number of finite volumes (FVs)
is the most relevant feature that defines the minimum size of the
injured region, i.e., a tissue with a high number of injured FVs
would have a high probability to generate reentries. To check
this hypothesis we perform numerical simulations in a three-
dimensional rectangular slab of tissue keeping the thickness
constant, 10 layers of cells, and we evaluate the minimum volume
under these conditions.

We obtain a single reentry over 25 tries for φ = 0.62 in a
system formed by a slab with a volume of 7 × 7 × 1mm3. The
two-dimensional version of this slab is actually the same case

Sachetto et al. Ectopic Beats Due to Hypoxia and Fibrosis

FIGURE 3 | Histograms with the percentage of reentries in a rectangular slab of tissue with an injured circular region with different levels of hypoxia (ATPi ) and fibrosis

(φ). For a two dimensional system corresponding to a tissue with a single layer of cells reentries occurs at low fraction of fibrosis (A), while for 5 layers (B) and 10

layers (C) the probabilities of reentries increase and reentries occur at higher fractions of fibrosis. The probability to find a reentry decreases for higher values of ATPi .

The size of the slab is 4 × 4 cm; The injured region occupies a circular region with radius equal to 1.4 cm.

discussed in the previous section. The total number of FVs in
such minimum 3D system is 49000, which is 10 times bigger
than the number of FVs in 2D. Therefore, these results indicate
that the total number of FVs (or myocytes) inside the injured
region is not the only relevant parameter for the generation of
reentries.

3.5. Minimum Size of a 3D Injured Cubic
Slab That Sustains Reentries
Next we change the geometry of the domain. We define a cubic
injured tissue formed by L × L × L cm3, where L is the length of
the cube. We vary the volume by modifying L.

Following the same type of initial condition employed along
the previous studies, we systematically reduce the size of the
cube to estimate the minimum size which sustains reentries.
We find reentries in a cube with L = 0.4 cm. In this case
the total number of FVs in such minimum system is 64000,
which is actually larger than the number of FVs in the previous
rectangular three-dimensional slabs (which was 49000).

3.6. Dependence on the Initial Perturbation
The minimum size of a cube to obtain reentries also depends
on the initial perturbation. The simulations done previously

in the whole tissue slabs are initiated with a perturbation in
one of the faces of the volume. However, in the case of the
circular injured region in the middle of the slab, see Figure 2 the
perturbation from the exterior of the slab continuously trigger
the entrance of the wave from different positions. Therefore,
the propagation of the waves toward the injured region is
different than the oversimplified version shown for example in
Figure 5. In order to study how reentries depend on the way
AP propagates toward the injured region we implemented and
analyzed different initial perturbations, or stimulations, in a cubic
domain with fibrosis and hypoxia. See three examples of reentries
in Figure 6 with different initial protocols (videos are available in
the Supplementary Material).

We apply several protocols to evaluate the effect of the initial
perturbation. We initially perturb a different number of faces of
the cubic domain. The most effective way to initiate a reentry
inside the cubic domain is the introduction of a perturbation
in one face of the cube. Such case is discussed in the previous
section, and a particular realization with theminimum size where
reentries are observed is shown in Figure 6A. The increase of the
size of the injured cube increases the number of reentries (with
the same number of statistically independent realizations), as
shown in Figure 7. Similar minimum size was obtained when two

corresponding to a tissue with a single layer of cells reentries occurs at low fraction of fibrosis (A), while for 5 layers (B) and 10 layers (C) the percentages of reentries

are higher and occur at higher fractions of fibrosis. The probability to find a reentry decreases for higher values of ATPi . The size of the slab is 4 × 4 × N cm.

adjacent faces of the injured cube were perturbed simultaneously.
However, the probability to induce a reentry is systematically
smaller than the previous case, see Figure 7.

The application of the initial perturbation in four of the faces
of the cube synchronizes the excitation inside the injured cube

and increases drastically the minimum size needed to obtain
reentries. With this stimulus protocol, the minimum size that
present reentries increases to L = 6 mm, corresponding to a total
of 216000 finite volumes. See an example of a reentry in such case
in Figure 6B.

larger than for less synchronized stimulations (one or two
faces).

4. DISCUSSION

The computer simulations presented in this work suggest that
the combination of fibrosis and hypoxia in a localized region
of the myocardium can provide a sufficient condition for the
genesis of ectopic beats. The mechanism behind the generation
of ectopic beats is unidirectional block inside a region with
diffuse fibrosis and hypoxia, where micro-reentries are formed.
We note that, although specific regions have been correlated
with the generation of ectopic beats, such as the pulmonary
veins (Haïssaguerre et al., 1998) during atrial fibrillation or
border zone of infarct regions after coronary occlusion (Boineau
and Cox, 1973), the mechanism behind this remains unclear.
Along decades experiments and numerical simulations have
suggested several candidates: abnormal automaticity, triggered
activity, such as early or delayed after depolarization, micro-
reentries, or even the combination of some of these three
(Jalife, 2011). Multiple data available in the literature supports
all these mechanisms. Probably, each one might be more
specific to a particular disease. However, the results in this
work may somehow defy this common sense. Micro-reentries
could arise from the combination of hypoxia and fibrosis,
two cardiac conditions that appear together in many heart
diseases, as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart
disease, recurrent myocardial infarction, and even in respiratory
diseases, such as obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive
sleep apnea and cystic fibrosis. Therefore, our results suggests
that a single mechanism could be behind many different
pathologies.

It is interesting to note also that among these three
mechanism, only micro-reentry, as first proposed to explain
PVCs in Boineau and Cox (1973), already suggested that both the
electrophysiology as well as the micro-structure of cardiac tissue
should be taken into account. Both abnormal automaticity and
triggered activity mechanisms focus only on electrophysiology
aspects of single myocytes. Nevertheless, recent studies have
shown that the presence of fibrosis or other non-conductive or
non-excitable cells is of extreme importance in the generation
of ectopic beats, even when the altered electrophysiology of
myocytes reflects abnormal automaticity or triggered activities
(Pumir et al., 2005; Zimik et al., 2015). Therefore, it seems that
recent studies are converging toward mechanisms that combine
both electrophysiological and micro-structural changes in order
to explain the genesis of dangerous ectopic beats.

In this work, we used simple computational models to
reproduce hypoxia and diffuse fibrosis. Nevertheless, the result
of this combination is far from trivial. First, in the simulations
that considered only one of these two processes, i.e., only hypoxia
or only fibrosis, ectopic beats were not created. However, even
when both conditions were considered, ectopic beats were not
always present. This combination does not result in an all-or-
none mechanism. The generation of ectopic beats depended on
many aspects that were evaluated in this work: percentage of

fibrosis, fibrosis pattern, level of hypoxia, size of the injured
tissue, its shape, and how AP waves enter the injured region.
The way fibrosis is distributed within cardiac tissue was modeled
stochastically. Therefore, we used the Monte Carlo method to
calculate the probability of an injured tissue to generate ectopic
beats.

By varying the percentage of fibrosis and level of hypoxia we
observed that the probability of micro-reentries increases with
the level of hypoxia, i.e., the scenario with most severe hypoxia
was the one with the highest number of reentries. In addition,
the simulations that generated ectopic beats had percentages of
fibrosis between 37 and 65%, and the highest number of reentries
was obtained using percentages of fibrosis near the percolation
threshold, a pure topological metric. This is in agreement with
our previous results (Alonso and Bär, 2013; Gouvêa de Barros
et al., 2015; Alonso et al., 2016).

In these previous studies, we have considered simple
and phenomenological models of cardiac myocytes to study
the effects of atrial fibrillation (Alonso et al., 2016) or
we have considered realistic models of mouse ventricular
tissue (Gouvêa de Barros et al., 2015). Here, we consider a human
ventricular model (Ten Tusscher and Panfilov, 2006) where
hypoxia could be studied at different degrees. The common
features of all these studies are the basis of the investigated
mechanism of micro-reentry: (1) Diffuse fibrosis generates
complex and long reentrant paths within the damaged region;
(2) Both action potential and wavelength are short for the cases
of mouse AP, remodeled AP due to atrial fibrillation, or, in
this paper, remodeled AP due to hypoxia in myocytes of the
human ventricle. The combination of long pathways and short
wavelengths allows micro-reentry circuits to be formed.

The probability of a compromised region to become an
ectopic pacemaker is higher for large damaged regions. We have
confirmed this hypothesis with our simulations using both two
and three-dimensional systems, see Figure 7. These simulations
also show the minimum sizes of the domains where reentries
were obtained. The dependence on the size supports the idea that
if the system is large, source-sink mismatches are more likely to
appear together with long reentrant pathways. Nevertheless, our
results suggest that the relation between size and probability of
reentry is not trivial and the shape of the injured region and the
way AP waves enter it play important roles.

For instance, in Table 2 we summarize our results in terms of
minimum required sizes to generate reentries for different tissue
geometries and different stimulation protocols. By comparing the
simulations that used the same stimulation protocol (stimulus
from a single face) we observe that the minimum volume in
cm3 may vary substantially: 70 × 70 × 1 (0.005 cm3), 70 ×
70 × 10 (0.05 cm3), and 40 × 40 × 40 (0.064 cm3). In fact,
our results suggest that it is easier to generate an ectopic beat
on flat geometries or on thin slabs than on cubics geometries.
Coincidentally, the most common infarct is known to be the sub-
endocardial one, with a geometry of the damage tissue that can
be described as a thin slab near the endocardial surface of the
heart. Nevertheless, if we keep the geometry fixed Figure 7 clearly
shows that by increasing the volume or size of the injured region
sustained reentries are more likely to occur.

Table 2 also shows how micro-reentries depend on the
different possible entrances of the wave into the injured region.
We have found that when the borders are well synchronized the
minimum injured volume that is needed to generate reentries is
much bigger than when the borders are loosely synchronized.
For instance, the last three lines of Table 2 show the minimum
volumes for different initial conditions when the geometry of the
injured region is a cube, see also Figures 6 , 7.

Our results on the minimum size of fibrotic regions can be
compared with measurements taken from human ventricles with
late-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LE-MRI). The
studies reported in Wu et al. (1998); Ørn et al. (2007), and
de Haan et al. (2011) reported scars of a minimum size around
0.1 cm3 for patients with a history of ventricular tachycardia. In
our simulations we have found that it is possible to generate an
ectopic pacemaker on injured regions with much smaller sizes
(one order of magnitude smaller). This discrepancy could be
related to the lack of spatial resolution of nowadays LE-MRI
exams. Nevertheless, the presented minimum size regions have
very low probability to behave as an ectopic pacemaker, see
Figures 6 , 7. Therefore, although the occurrence of reentries in
such small regions is theoretically possible, it is very unlike to
occur.

There are many limitations in this study. First, we have
used simple models for both fibrosis and hypoxia. For instance,
different types of fibrosis can be observed (Nguyen et al., 2014):
compact, interstitial, patchy and diffuse. In this work we have
only used a simple model for diffuse fibrosis. In addition,
the results and conclusions presented in this work should be
taken cautiously. As we have previously mentioned, although
hypoxia and fibrosis are found together in many heart and
respiratory diseases, they are usually accompanied by many other
pathological conditions. Although the complex interactions of
pathological conditions other than hypoxia and fibrosis are out of
the scope of this work, we list here a few interactions that deserve
further investigations in future works. In respiratory diseases
hypoxia has been co-observed with oxidative stress (Yin et al.,
2012; Ramond et al., 2013; Debevec et al., 2017). It has been
shown that the combination of hypoxia and oxidative stress can
be quite complex, involve multiple scales of cellular metabolism
and lead to further reduction of APD (Zhou et al., 2009). In the
case of acute ischemia, whereas hypoxia is present and has been
shown to be the condition that most affects AP waveform (Shaw
and Rudy, 1997), hyperkalemia and acidosis are also important

conditions that can considerably reduce AP wave velocity
and, as consequence, further reduce wavelength. Whether the
aforementioned conditions could, in theory, corroborate with the
describedmicro-reentrymechanism, and increase the probability
of the genesis of ectopic beats, other conditions could counteract
it. For instance, during fibrosis a possible connection between
myocytes and fibroblasts could increase the APDs of myocytes
(Kohl and Gourdie, 2014). However, it is still an open question
if fibroblasts are electrically coupled to the myocytes (Kohl
and Gourdie, 2014). Therefore, we employ here a simple
approach assuming that fibroblasts do not interact electrically
with myocytes and they basically act as barriers to the action
potential propagation. This approach has been employed in a
large number of scientific studies on the modeling of fibrosis in
ventricular (Ten Tusscher and Panfilov, 2007; McDowell et al.,
2011; Kazbanov et al., 2016) and atrial (Cherry et al., 2007; Alonso
et al., 2016; McDowell et al., 2015) tissues. Such approach has
been also employed in highly detailed microscopic models of
cardiac tissues where cells are disconnected by barriers or by dead
cells (Jacquemet and Henriquez, 2009; Hubbard and Henriquez,
2014; Gouvêa de Barros et al., 2015). Other studies consider
different approaches to model the electrical interaction between
fibroblasts and the myocytes (Xie et al., 2009; Nayak et al., 2017).
Finally, we highlight that this is a pure theoretical study, and
therefore, further experimental validations are pending.

In summary, the combination of fibrosis with hypoxia in a
localized region of the myocardium can provide the sufficient
condition for the genesis of ectopic beats and reentries in a
human ventricular model. The size, shape and geometry of the
injured region, as well as the electrophysiology remodeling due
to hypoxia are important features that determine the probability
of an affected region to behave as an ectopic pacemaker, a trigger
for life-threatening arrhythmias.
