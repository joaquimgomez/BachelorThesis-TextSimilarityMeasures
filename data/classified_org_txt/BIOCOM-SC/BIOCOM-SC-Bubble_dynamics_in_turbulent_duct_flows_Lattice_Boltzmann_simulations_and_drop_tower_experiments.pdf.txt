Abstract Lattice-Boltzmann simulations of a turbulent duct1

flow have been carried out to obtain trajectories of passive2

tracers in the conditions of a series of microgravity experi-3

ments of turbulent bubble suspensions. The statistics of these4

passive tracers are compared to the corresponding measure-5

ments for single-bubble and bubble-pair statistics obtained6

from particle tracking techniques after the high-speed cam-7

era recordings from drop-towers experiments. In the condi-8

tions of the present experiments, comparisons indicate that9

experimental results on bubble velocity fluctuations are not10

consistent with simulations of passive tracers, which points11

in the direction of an active role of bubbles. The present12

analysis illustrates the utility of a recently introduced exper-13

1 Introduction19

Multiphase flows are ubiquitous in technological applica-20

tions. Specially complex situations correspond to the disper-21

sion of one phase driven by a turbulent flow. In these cases22

the interaction between the flow and the dispersed phase is23

complicated by break-up and coalescence phenomena (Colin24

et al, 2008; Balachandar and Eaton, 2010). This problem is25

most relevant for space technologies such as life support sys-26

tems and environmental control for life in space (Hurlbert27

et al, 2010), power generation and propulsion (Meyer et al,28

2010) or thermal management (Hill et al, 2010). Therefore29

there is a strong interest in the study of turbulent bubbly30

flows under microgravity conditions (Colin, 2002).31

Whereas there are several studies for the case of normal32

gravity (Kytömaa, 1987; Tryggvason et al, 2006; Mazzitelli33

et al, 2003), there are few works in microgravity (see for34

instance Colin et al (2001)). Very recently (Bitlloch et al,35

2018) developed a gravity-insensitive method that generates36

monodisperse, homogeneous bubble suspensions in a turbu-37

lent duct flow. One important feature of this method regard-38

ing fundamental research in turbulent bubbly flows is the39

capability of controlling, in an independent way, important40

characteristics such as the degree of turbulence, the bubble41

size and also the bubble density.42

In a series of microgravity experiments (36 drops of 4.743

s conducted in the ZARM Drop Tower), and by using parti-44

cle tracking techniques, results on bubble velocity statistics45

were obtained (Bitlloch et al, 2018). One intriguing result46

obtained in these experiments was a weak dependence of47

the relative bubble velocity fluctuations on Reynolds num-48

ber. Simple scaling arguments of developed turbulence do49

not predict such dependence. This anomalous scaling could50

then be either a property of the duct flow in the particular51

conditions of experiments, or be instead an indication of an52

active role of the bubbles on the flow.53



2 Pau Bitlloch et al.

The main aim of this paper is to obtain precise numerical54

results on turbulent duct flows in order to elucidate this ques-55

tion. To this end, Lattice-Boltzmann simulations of the flow56

have been carried out. By using virtual passive tracers, these57

simulations allowed to compare their statistics with that of58

the real bubbles. Simulation results also enabled to compare59

the two-point statistics of passive tracers to that from the60

particle-tracking of bubble pairs. This gives interesting in-61

formation on the flow mixing properties and the probability62

of bubble encounters. In particular we compared the char-63

acteristic times of separation between pairs of passive trac-64

ers in simulations and pairs of bubbles in the experiments.65

All these information allowed to obtain an additional and66

more accurate knowledge of the behavior of turbulent bub-67

bly flows under microgravity conditions.68

2 Lattice-Boltzmann simulations69

In order to characterize the structure and properties of a tur-70

bulent flow through a duct of square section we have per-71

formed 3D Lattice-Boltzmann simulations. The channel has72

been discretized into a uniform grid of 320x80x80 liquid73

nodes, representing a portion of 400x100x100 mm3 of the74

duct, with periodic conditions at its ends. After some tests75

of various discretizations of the model, we decided for the76

D3Q15 Lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model with77

mid-way wall boundary conditions for no-slip walls (Nour-78

galiev et al, 2003; Bitlloch, 2012).79

For the sake of stability, since it is not possible to simu-80

late all scales of turbulence down to the Kolmogorov length,81

we used the Smagorinsky coefficient for sub-grid scale fil-82

tering (Hou et al, 1994). This method is based on the cal-83

culation of the local effective viscosity that would dissipate84

the sub-grid effects generated at each local point. Some rem-85

nant numerical instability was controlled by an additional86

smoothing procedure that preserved mass and momentum87

(Bitlloch, 2012).88

The present code was parallelized and ran in the Mare89

Nostrum supercomputer at the Barcelona Supercomputing90

Center (calculating typically with a set of 256 processors)91

and in a cluster of 16 processors at the Department of Ap-92

plied Physics of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC).93

An overall estimation of the total CPU time used, account-94

ing for checking and optimization of the parallelized code95

as well as for its subsequent simulations, has been of around96

80,000 hours.97

2.1 Code checkings98

In order to check our code, we ran simulations for the same99

conditions as Pattison et al (2009). Comparisons showed100

good agreement in the time-averaged structure of the flow,101

obtaining the same main longitudinal component of the flow102

and a reasonable agreement on the residual transversal com-103

ponents associated to the square section of the duct (sec-104

ondary flow, see below), which was qualitatively correct ex-105

cept for small asymmetries probably due to insufficient tem-106

poral averaging.107

As an illustrative example, Figure 1 shows the computed108

flow in a transversal section of the square duct for both Reynolds109

numbers of 3800 and 12700. Lines represent the fluctuating110

component of the flow velocity (u′ = u−U). Length and111

color of the lines show the magnitude of each vector in an112

arbitrary scale. The same comparison is made for the longi-113

tudinal section of the flow placed at midway between walls114

in the z direction is presented in Figure 2. Higher Reynolds115

numbers shows a finer and more detailed structure of turbu-116

lence that includes smaller eddies.117

As measured by many authors (e.g., Melling and Whitelaw,118

1976), and in contrast to the case of pipe flow with a circu-119

lar section, turbulent flow in a square duct generates a weak120

remnant mean flow contained in the square transversal sec-121

tion of the flow, with pairs of symmetric vortices on each of122

the four edges of the channel. Those are called secondary123

flows, as they have a magnitude significantly smaller than124

the main longitudinal flow, and emerge only after careful125

time averaging of the transversal flow. Their structure is such126

that the flow approaches the edges from the bisector of the127

right angle between walls, then it follows the wall (moving128

really close to it) until it approaches the bisector of the wall,129

where it returns to the central part of the section. Figure 3130

show the mean secondary flows obtained in our computa-131

tions for the case of Re = 3800. Lines represent the flow132

vector (0,Uy,Uz), being the length and color of the lines,133
the magnitude of the vector in an arbitrary scale. Results134

have been obtained from averaging over the whole length of135

the simulation, and over a period of 400,000 iterations (cor-136

responding to 500 s of simulated time for the parameters137

of our experimental duct) after the simulation had reached138

the stationary regime. Given the difficulty of observing such139

secondary flows, they constitute a good test of the numerical140

simulation.141

Analogously, we have done a statistical analysis for the142

computation with Re = 12700, averaging over a period of143

300,000 iterations (corresponding, in our case, to 110 s of144

simulated time) after reaching the stationary solution of the145

flow. Comparing the numerical results obtained from both146

simulations in Figure 4 we find that the dimensionless pro-147

files of velocity remain essentially unaltered by the change148

in the degree of turbulence in the flow. This is in agreement149

with the fact that the main structure of the flow is determined150

by the largest scales of turbulence, while the smaller ones151

define the scale of dissipation. The increase of the Reynolds152

number produces the decrease in size of the smallest scales153

of turbulence, resulting in the addition of more scales of ve-154

duct of square section and dimensions 800x100x100 mm3,170

and by using a wire mesh (2.5 mm thick) with square holes171

of 10x10 mm2, corresponding to the scale of the most ener-172

getic eddies of the duct. The bubble suspension is achieved173

by injecting into the co-flow a pre-generated slug flow of174

water and air. This slug flow is formed by combining water175

and air flows in a T-junction device (Carrera et al, 2008),176

and is injected into the co-flow by four injectors forming a177

square. The bubble size is given by the size of the injectors,178

typically of the order of one millimeter, and can be fine-179

tuned through the injection parameters (Carrera et al, 2008;180

Arias et al, 2009; Bitlloch et al, 2015). The resulting We-181

ber numbers are small enough for bubbles injected into the182

turbulent flow to be roughly spherical. Typical bubble sizes183

are larger than the dissipative turbulent scales, and there-184

fore they could actively couple to the flow. At the same time185

bubbles are much smaller than the largest eddies, which are186

limited by the duct width of 100 mm. Generated void frac-187

tions are typically small, of the order of a few percent. For188

the presented analysis, in order to reduce optical screening189

between bubbles, we have selected cases in the range from190

0.3 to 0.8 void fractions.191

This system is insensitive to the gravity level and permits192

to control the frequency and size of the generated bubbles in193

a way completely independent from the co-flow characteris-194

tics. More details on the setup can be found in Bitlloch et al195

(2018). An example of the injection of the bubbles can be196

seen in Fig. 6, with the resulting turbulent suspension shown197

in Fig. 7198

In order to analyze experimental results, images taken by199

high speed video cameras were processed by particle track-200

ing techniques to reconstruct the bubble trajectories during201

the experiments. To this aim, after substracting the back-202

ground, a standard filter was used to highlight the interphase203

of each bubble. In this way it was possible to identify the204

Previous experimental results, based on particle tracking210

techniques, concluded that the relative bubble velocity fluc-211

tuations of the transversal y-component, σy, have a signifi-212

cant decreasing tendency as the Reynolds number increases213

(Bitlloch et al, 2018). In particular, after relaxing the pseu-214

doturbulence generated by bubbles (due to their relative ve-215

locity with respect the co-flow before switching-off gravity),216

it was found that the ratio σy/Uc was 0.13 for Re = 6000217

whereas it was 0.08 for Re = 13000 (Bitlloch et al, 2018).218

For the longitudinal component σx, however, the experimen-219

tal data did not exhibit any conclusive tendency in this re-220

spect (σx/Uc = 0.10 for Re = 6000 and σx/Uc = 0.11 for221
Re = 13000) (Bitlloch et al, 2018) .222

To analyze these experimental results we study the pro-223

files of both relative velocity fluctuation by using the present224

numerical results. Flow data in this case correspond to re-225

sults that would exhibit passive tracers. Figures 8 and 9 show226

these profiles taken at depths
y

Lc
= 0.5 and 0.25, respectively.227

We then compare the relative fluctuations on each direction228

obtained in simulations for different degrees of turbulence. It229

can be seen that, in both cases, the change of the Reynolds230

number has no significant effect upon the relative velocity231

fluctuations. This is a result that coincides with the expec-232

tation from simple scaling arguments for fully developed233

turbulence, but that are not consistent with the mentioned234

experimental results. According to these results, bubbles do235

not seem to behave as passive traces of the flow, thus sug-236

gesting an active role of bubbles in the turbulence in the con-237

ditions of the experiment.238

lations an initially structured configuration of a large num-244

ber of tracers (around 40000 tracers distributed in a regular245

lattice at relative distances of 1.25 mm ) for a long period246

of time, thus reaching a homogeneous distribution. Specifi-247

cally, the case with Re= 3800 was first evolved during 30000248

iterations (corresponding to 37 s of simulated time) and then249

the statistics was analyzed for the following 20000 iterations250

(25 s). The statistics of the case Re= 12700 was initiated251

after 50000 iterations (18.1 s), and spanned another 50000252

iterations.253

In Figure 10 we show a transversal coordinate as a func-254

tion of time, and the projection on the transversal section of255

four trajectories described by tracers located initially on a256

close neighbourhood. The trajectories clearly show that the257

tracers remain close to each other for a certain finite time258

and then they strongly diverge from each other.259

Experimental measurements of bubble pairs have been260

taken from the trajectories of bubbles previously captured261

with particle tracking methods. Those located at a distance262

smaller than 2 mm of another bubble (measured from their263

centers in the recorded image), have been considered a pair264

and have been used to calculate the averaged temporal evo-265

lution of their separation. In Figure 11 we display the evolu-266

tion of the mean distance between pairs of bubbles at differ-267

ent temporal ranges of the microgravity experiments. Noisy268

signals at the final part of the lines denote a lack of sufficient269

statistics, caused by the high degree of screening between270

bubbles in the videos, which makes impossible to follow271

the trajectory of a bubble for a long period of time. Thus,272

as time increases, we are losing the track of more bubble273

pairs and consequently we get poorer statistics. In Figure 11-274

top, for the smaller Re = 6000, the slope of the mean sep-275

aration versus time is steadily reducing in successive time276

decaying during the experiment, as it was observed in Bitl-278

loch et al (2018). The present results constitute another inter-279

almost no differences in the short times for the first three282

co-flow dominates so that the pseudoturbulence relaxation284

is more difficult to observe (which agrees with relaxation of285

velocity fluctuations being much weaker in this case as seen286

in Bitlloch et al (2018)). The different behavior observed in287

the last time window is due to the arrival of bubbles already288

generated in microgravity, and hence generated and trans-289

Namely dark and light red lines correspond to Re= 6000.294

and dark and light blue lines correspond to Re = 13000. We295

find that the measurements for equivalent degrees of turbu-296

lence share a similar slope once they have reached the linear297

regime, defining an effective rate of separation.298

Dashed lines in Fig. 12 correspond to the linear fittings299

303

At this point it is important to call the attention upon304

the fact that the pairs of bubbles defined from experimen-305

tal images are in many cases only apparent, due to the lack306

of information about the depth along the visual direction z.307

A majority of them are separated by distances much larger308

than the apparent separation and thus will follow rather inde-309

pendent trajectories. If we consider that a pair of bubbles is310

real when their initial separation ∆z0 in the visual direction311

is smaller than 1.6 mm, for a homogeneous distribution of312

bubbles in our duct of width Ly = 100 mm we obtain a pro-313
portion of about 3% of real pairs, against 97% of apparent314

ones. One could think of different strategies to differentiate315

the two populations of pairs, with the help of a detailed sta-316

tistical study of tracers in the simulations. However, due to317

the small statistical significance of the real pairs, the lack of318

more experiments to increase the amount of data makes any319

of such attempts virtually hopeless.320

Figure 13 shows the evolution of the mean separation be-321

tween real pairs of tracers, obtained from our simulations for322

two different degrees of turbulence. The first noticeable ob-323

servation is that real pairs of tracers, unlike our experimen-324

tal measures, have an average separation that grows closer325

to exponentially in time. This rate is defined by an exponent326

L , which we may assimilate to an effective Lyapunov expo-327

nent, that controls the average rate of exponential separation328

d(t) = d0e
L t of infinitesimally close trajectories in a chaotic329

dynamical system (Salazar and Collins, 2009). Fits in Fig-330

ure 13 are shown in Table 2, which adjust nicely to simula-331

tions until the finite size effects of the duct section become332

important and slow down the growth, as can be observed in333

the figure for the most turbulent case.334

tings for these results are also included in Table 3.351

The last aspect we will analyze concerning the dynam-352

ics of bubble pairs is the measurement of the statistics of353

time needed before a pair separates beyond a minimum dis-354

tance. In the experimental measurements, as well as in the355

simulations, we have considered the time lapse between the356

moment the pair reduces its separation to a distance smaller357

than 2 mm and the moment it surpasses 4 mm, always taken358

between their respective centers. In Figures 16 and 17 we359

show the experimental data and the simulated predictions,360

respectively.361

Results are hard to compare due to the large amount362

of screening events in the experimental images, that pro-363

duce an increasing uncertainty in the shape of the curves as364

the time lapse grows. In simulations, significant differences365

are observed between the distribution of probability for real366

pairs of tracers and that of apparent pairs, with much longer367

life times for real pairs, as a result of the strong correla-368

tions of velocities in nearby bubbles, as opposed to the case369

essentially uncorrelated for distant ones. From the detailed370

knowledge of the statistics of the time separation of both ap-371

parent and real pairs, taken from numerical simulations to-372

gether with the appropriate characterization of the screening373

effects, the proper fitting functions could be obtained that374

would allow to correctly project the experimental data into375

a reduced set of parameters in order to extract the statistics376

of real versus apparent bubble pairs, and thus try to detect377

whether this observable captures some effect not contained378

in the passive tracer picture. We have not pursued this idea379

because, as pointed out before, the limited number of ex-380

periments available in microgravity prevents from reaching381

statistically significant conclusions for the minority of the382

events of interest, namely those corresponding to the real383

pairs.384

5 Conclusions385

Large scale Lattice-Boltzmann simulations have been per-386

formed to produce reference states of turbulence with the387

same conditions of the experiments but without bubbles, to388

contrast with experimental data in the presence of bubbles,389

in view of detecting nontrivial couplings between bubble dy-390

namics and turbulence.391

This numerical study shows that the relative velocity fluc-392

tuations (scaled to its characteristic velocity) of the flow is393

roughly independent of the degree of turbulence, in accor-394

dance with the expectation from simple scaling arguments395

for fully developed turbulence.396

In previous experiments, however, it was observed that397

the relative velocity fluctuations displayed by bubbles de-398

viated significantly from this scaling, and reflected instead a399

tendency to decrease with increasing Reynolds number. This400

suggests an active coupling role of bubbles on the turbulent401

flow, that would require a more systematic study to be con-402

firmed and quantified more precisely.403

By using particle tracking we have studied the space-404

time statistics of bubble pairs, and compared it with results405

of passive tracers from Lattice-Boltzmann simulations. In406

particular we have studied the first-passage time statistics as-407

sociated to the separation of two-close tracers. We find that408

the average distance between a pair of tracers increases ex-409

ponentially with an effective time scale that depends on the410

degree of turbulence in the flow. For the case of a pair of ap-411

parent tracers, though, the average separation between them412

increases linearly with time. In the analysis of experimen-413

tal data, we find a similar behavior for the apparent pairs,414

which dominate the statistics. Real pairs are comparatively415

rare, and any statistical method to extract the corresponding416

information for those cases would need a larger number of417

experiments in microgravity. The conclusions of the present418

analysis could be, in some sense, limited because only 2D419

projections of the experimental trajectories are available for420

comparison with numerical results, but demonstrates the use421

of the recently introduced experimental setup to generate422

controlled turbulent bubble suspensions in microgravity.423
