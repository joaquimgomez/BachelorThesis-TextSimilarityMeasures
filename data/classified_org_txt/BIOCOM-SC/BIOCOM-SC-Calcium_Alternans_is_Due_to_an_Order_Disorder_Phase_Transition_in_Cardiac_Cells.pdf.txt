Abstract: Electromechanical alternans is a beat-to-beat alternation in the strength of contraction of a cardiac cell, 

which can be caused by an instability of calcium cycling.  Using a distributed model of subcellular calcium we 

show that alternans occurs via an order-disorder phase transition which exhibits critical slowing down and a 

diverging correlation length.   We apply finite size scaling, along with a mapping to a stochastic coupled map 

model, to show that this transition in two dimensions is characterized by critical exponents consistent with the Ising 

universality class. These findings highlight the important role of cooperativity in biological cells, and suggest novel 

approaches to investigate the onset of the alternans instability in the heart.

When a cardiac myocyte is rapidly paced by a periodic stimulus it is known to exhibit complex dynamics of both 

cell membrane potential and intracellular calcium (Ca). A common transition is from a periodic response to 

alternans, where the duration of the action potential (AP) and the Ca transient alternates from one beat to the next 

[1-3].  This phenomenon has been studied extensively since it is known that patients diagnosed with T-wave 

alternans, the resulting beat-to-beat alternation in the shape of the electrocardiogram (ECG), present a higher risk of 

suffering life threatening arrhythmias [3,4].   Earlier work showed that alternans could arise from a period-doubling 

bifurcation associated with the kinetics of ion channels regulating the membrane potential [3]. However, 

experimental studies revealed that alternans may also appear due to an instability in  intracellular Ca, independently 

of the dynamics of voltage[5]. Global deterministic models of the average subcellular Ca concentration, also 

explained alternans as a consequence of a period doubling bifurcation in the dynamics of Ca cycling [6]. These 

studies overlooked, however, the stochastic nature of Ca signaling at the ion channel level.   

Recently, several authors have studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of subcellular Ca during alternans [7-9]. In 

particular, Restrepo et al. [7] developed a detailed model of the three dimensional distribution of Ca signaling and 

showed that rapid pacing induced Ca alternans. This finding suggested that nonlinearities in the kinetics of Ca 

signaling proteins might be the underlying cause for alternans. In an important study, Rovetti et al. [10] developed a 

comprehensive theory of Ca alternans referred to as the "3R theory", which attributed alternans to the combination 

of the underlying stochasticity of Ca regulation, the regenerative recruitment of Ca sparks due to nearest neighbor 

interactions, and refractoriness in the Ca response. This result is important since it demonstrated that Ca alternans 

can be a direct consequence of the collective behavior of local stochastic units.       

In this paper we use a detailed model of stochastic Ca cycling to show that the transition from regular Ca cycling to 

alternans occurs via an order-disorder phase transition consistent with the Ising universality class. We demonstrate 

that this transition follows from known features of the Ca cycling architecture, such as the close positioning of 

signaling channels in micro domains, and the coupling between signaling units due to Ca diffusion. In particular, 

we demonstrate that these far-from-equilibrium biological systems exhibit features that can be described using 

equilibrium statistical mechanics, where stochasticity at the ion channel level serves the role of temperature, while 

cellular diffusion leads to spatial cooperativity.  

Phase transition in a detailed model of Ca cycling.-   The Ca signaling architecture (Fig. 1A) is designed so that 

changes in membrane voltage can initiate signal transduction inside the cell. A cardiac cell consists of thousands of 

similar domains, referred to as Ca release units (CaRUs), where voltage gated Ca channels (LCC) induce Ca release 

due to a nearby cluster of Ryanodine receptors (RyR) channels which control the flow of Ca sequestered within the 

sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).  RyR channels open in a Ca dependent manner [11] and this property ensures that an 

LCC channel opening in the immediate vicinity induces an autocatalytic release of Ca from the RyR cluster, 

2 
 



referred to as a Ca spark[11].    Under normal conditions several thousand sparks are triggered in the cell and the Ca 

released summates to form the global Ca transient  [12].     

To explore the collective dynamics of these signaling domains we first note that CaRUs in ventricular myocytes are 

distributed along planes perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cell, called Z-planes.  Each Z-plane is 

effectively a two-dimensional (2D) network of CaRUs. We therefore study the dynamics of Ca cycling in an 𝐿𝐿 × 𝐿𝐿 

array of signaling units (Fig. 1B; full details of the model are given in the supplemental material [13]). The local 

signal transduction is captured via a direct simulation of 1-5 LCC channels in close proximity with 10-100 RyR 

channels. Here, each channel is modeled by simulating the stochastic channel transitions between states of 

experimentally derived Markovian schemes (Fig. 1C and [13]). These junctions are coupled via diffusive currents 

in the cytosol and SR. Then, we pace the array of signaling units using an AP clamp. Indeed, we find that when our 

system is paced at a fast cycle length (𝑇𝑇) then the Ca transient averaged over all units can exhibit an alternating 

beat-to-beat sequence. In Fig. 1D we show a representative trace of the whole cell average Ca transient, defined as 

𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 = (1 𝐿𝐿2⁄ )∑ 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘

𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 , demonstrating Ca transient alternans similar to that observed experimentally [5].   We also 

plot the local Ca concentration within the dyadic junction 𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 for three representative compartments, showing that 

the local response is stochastic and can exhibit stereotypical Ca spark events (S), or non sparking events (NS) 

where the local autocatalytic release fails or is abbreviated. In Fig. 1E we show the alternans bifurcation of the 

steady state average peak Ca transient (and jSR concentration) as a function of pacing rate 𝑇𝑇. 

To describe the transition to alternans in a cardiac cell we first define a local order parameter that gives a measure 

of the phase of alternans in different parts of the cell. Inspired by previous work on the analysis of phase transitions 

in chaotic coupled map lattices[22] we use 

𝑚𝑚𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘(𝑛𝑛) = 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑛𝑛 �(−1)𝑛𝑛 �𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (𝑛𝑛) − 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (𝑛𝑛 − 1)�� = 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑛𝑛[(−1)𝑛𝑛 ∆ 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (𝑛𝑛) ] ,     (1) 

where 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑛𝑛[𝑥𝑥] refers to the sign of the argument 𝑥𝑥,  𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (𝑛𝑛) denotes the jSR load at site (𝑘𝑘, 𝑙𝑙), at the beginning of the 

𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡ℎ beat, and where the (−1)𝑛𝑛 is included so that the sign of 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) gives a measure of the phase of alternans, i.e.  

𝑚𝑚𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = +1  for all 𝑛𝑛  denotes a large-small-large-small sequence of 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (𝑛𝑛) . Global alternans appears when the 

concentrations in 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘  alternate from beat to beat (∆ 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (𝑛𝑛) ≉ 0) with the same overall phase. Indeed, the magnitude 

of whole cell alternans is the system average 𝑚𝑚(𝑛𝑛) = (1 𝐿𝐿2⁄ )∑ 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛),𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗  which gives a measure of the global 

alternans phase at beat 𝑛𝑛.   We find that close to the transition to global alternans our order parameter displays 

features indicative of long-range order. In Fig. 2A we plot a snapshot of the steady state spatial distribution of 

alternans amplitude (−1)𝑛𝑛 ∆ 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (𝑛𝑛),  and phase 𝑚𝑚𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘(𝑛𝑛) , for decreasing pacing rates. We observe that global 

alternans forms via the gradual coalescence of in-phase domains similar to the patterns observed in the 2D Ising 

model close to the critical temperature. A plot of the time dependence of the average alternans phase (Fig. 2B) 

3 
 



displays large temporal fluctuations near the critical pacing rate, which is indicative of critical slowing down near a 

second order phase transition. This result is also consistent with the observation of a diverging correlation length 

(Fig. 2C) as the critical pacing rate is approached.   

Finite size scaling analysis.-  To uncover the nature of the transition we have computed moments of the alternans 

phase defined as 

〈𝑚𝑚𝑘𝑘〉 =
1
𝑁𝑁
�|𝑚𝑚(𝑛𝑛)|𝑘𝑘
𝑁𝑁

𝑛𝑛=1

   , 
   (2) 

where 𝑁𝑁  is the number of beats. In Fig. 2C we plot 〈𝑚𝑚2〉 vs. the pacing rate 𝑇𝑇  showing the gradual onset of 

alternans. In the range of pacing intervals where 〈𝑚𝑚2〉  begins to increase, the susceptibility, defined as 𝜒𝜒 =

𝐿𝐿2 (〈𝑚𝑚2〉 − 〈𝑚𝑚〉2), increases with system size (Fig. 2C), suggesting that it diverges in the thermodynamic limit, 

which is indicative of long-range correlations near a phase transition. To find the critical pacing period 𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 we 

compute the Binder cumulant [23]  𝑈𝑈 = −3 + 〈𝑚𝑚4〉 〈𝑚𝑚2〉2⁄ , which is independent of system size according to the 

finite size scaling ansatz 〈𝑚𝑚𝑘𝑘〉 = 𝐿𝐿−𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝛾𝛾⁄ 𝐹𝐹�(𝑇𝑇 − 𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐)𝐿𝐿1 𝜈𝜈
⁄ �.  Numerical simulations of systems sizes 40 < 𝐿𝐿 < 90, 

with temporal averages of 𝑁𝑁 ∼ 106 beats, reveal that the curves of the Binder cumulant intersect over a narrow 

range of the pacing period 𝑇𝑇 consistent with finite size scaling  (Fig. 2C, and inset). At criticality, finite size scaling 

predicts that 〈𝑚𝑚〉 ∼ 𝐿𝐿−𝑘𝑘 𝜈𝜈⁄ , 𝜒𝜒 ∼ 𝐿𝐿𝛾𝛾 𝜈𝜈⁄ , and [𝜕𝜕𝑈𝑈 𝜕𝜕𝑇𝑇⁄ ]𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 ∼ 𝐿𝐿
1 𝜈𝜈⁄ , where 𝛽𝛽, 𝛾𝛾, 𝜈𝜈 are critical exponents that characterize 

the universality class of the phase transition.  Numerical simulation of these exponents gives (see full details in 

[13]) 𝛽𝛽/𝜈𝜈 = 0.18 ± 0.11, 𝛾𝛾/𝜈𝜈 = 1.75 ± 0.08, 𝜈𝜈 = 0.91 ± 0.14.  The values of these exponents indicate that the 

onset of calcium alternans is consistent with a two dimensional order-disorder Ising transition (𝛽𝛽/𝜈𝜈 = 0.125,

𝛾𝛾/𝜈𝜈 = 1.75, 𝜈𝜈 = 1). 

To check the robustness of our results we have also considered the effect of Gaussian fluctuations, up to 20% of the 

average, in the diffusion coefficient linking intracellular compartments.    We find that disorder does not introduce 

significant changes in the behavior of the order parameter, showing, as in the pure system, a clear signature of a 

phase transition (see online supplement).  Another important question to address is whether the order-disorder 

transition proposed here is sufficient to explain the formation of whole cell alternans in a 3D cardiac cell.   To 

answer this question we have also simulated a 3D array of CaRUs, which more closely represent the internal 

geometry of a cardiac cell (see online supplement for full details).   We account for the larger spacing between Z-

planes by including a diffusive coupling between compartments in different planes that is 10% − 20% that within a 

Z-plane. Our simulations show that this small diffusive coupling between planes is sufficient to synchronize 

alternans across the whole cell.  Thus, the order-disorder transition reported here also occurs in a realistic 3D 

geometry of a cardiac cell.

Stochastic coupled maps model.-  To uncover the underlying mechanism for the alternans transition we have also 

developed a coupled maps model of Ca cycling that mimics the key features of our detailed stochastic model.   We 

first note that local signal transduction can be characterized by the probability, denoted as 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗, that a local LCC 

channel opening will trigger a Ca spark.  To shed light on this quantity we have computed 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 using the previous 

detailed model. In Fig. 3A we plot the probability of inducing a Ca spark as a function of SR load for different 

numbers of RyR channels in the cluster. Our results reveal that 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 has a robust sigmoid dependence on the SR load, 

which arises due to the cooperativity of RyR channels in the cluster which transition to the open state in a Ca 

dependent manner.  To analyze the dynamical consequences of this feature we construct an iterative map describing 

Ca cycling. Here, we keep track of the beat-to-beat changes of the SR load at beat 𝑛𝑛, and site 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗, using a discrete 

variable 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛). The main features of our coupled map system, illustrated in Fig. 3B, are:     

(i) The release phase.  Here, the CaRU at beat 𝑛𝑛 releases Ca with a trigger probability 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗�𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛)�, which is simply 

the SR load dependent probability of triggering a Ca spark. Thus, we have 

𝑥𝑥�𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) = 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) − 𝑟𝑟 ⋅ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) ⋅ 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛)    (3) 

where 𝑥𝑥�𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) is the SR load after release at the 𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡ℎ beat (Fig. 4B), and where 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) is a random variable that is 

generated at each site according to the rule  

𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) = �
1                          𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤ℎ  𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝            𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗�𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛)�        
0                         𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤ℎ 𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝        1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗�𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛)�   .

 
   (4) 

Here we use a probability of sparking given by 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗(𝑥𝑥) = 1 [1 + (𝑥𝑥∗ 𝑥𝑥⁄ )𝛾𝛾]⁄  in order to mimic the sigmoid response 

observed in the fully stochastic simulation.      

(ii) Nearest neighbor equilibration.   In the next phase we mimic Ca diffusion between signaling units by averaging 

the local SR load.   Therefore, we average over the nine nearest neighbors 

�̅�𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) =
1
9
� 𝑥𝑥�𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘(𝑛𝑛)
<𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘>

 . 
   (5) 

(iii) SR recovery phase.  The Ca released into the cell is then pumped back into the SR via SERCA uptake pumps.  

This effect can be modeled as  

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛 + 1) = �̅�𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) + 𝐹𝐹��̅�𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛)�  ,     (6) 

where the change in SR concentration due to the uptake flux is taken to have the form 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑝𝑝(1 − 𝑥𝑥) for 𝑥𝑥 ≤ 1 

and 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) = 0 for 𝑥𝑥 > 1. The parameter 𝑝𝑝 gives a measure of the amount of Ca pumped back into the SR during 

that beat, which is proportional to the pacing period 𝑇𝑇. Thus, we vary the parameter 𝑝𝑝 to simulate the system 

response to variable pacing rates.

Simulations of an 𝐿𝐿 × 𝐿𝐿 array of coupled maps system reveals that at rapid pacing rates the global average 𝑥𝑥(𝑛𝑛) =

(1 𝑀𝑀⁄ )  ∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛)  
𝑀𝑀
𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗=1 undergoes an alternans transition similar to that observed in the full stochastic simulation.    

To characterize the alternans transition we follow our previous approach and compute the order parameter at beat 𝑛𝑛 

and site 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗  as  𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) = 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑛𝑛[(−1)𝑛𝑛�𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛) − 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗(𝑛𝑛 − 1)�] . In Fig. 3C we plot 〈𝑚𝑚〉 as a function of 𝑝𝑝  for 

different system sizes 𝐿𝐿. We observe that the average amplitude increases smoothly as the parameter 𝑝𝑝 is decreased 

bellow a critical point 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐, which indicates the gradual formation of an ordered phase. Furthermore, our data (Fig. 

3D) reveals that the binder cumulants intersect over a narrow range of 𝑝𝑝 which is consistent with the predictions of 

finite size scaling near a phase transition. We have computed the associated critical exponents using averages over 

109 beats (see [13] for details), and find exponents 𝛽𝛽/𝜈𝜈, 𝛾𝛾/𝜈𝜈 and 𝜈𝜈 consistent with the Ising universality class.   

Discussion.-  In this paper we have applied a detailed Ca cycling model to show that the transition to alternans in 

cardiac myocytes can be described as a second order phase transition in the Ising universality class. The mechanism 

for alternans is due to the fact that local Ca release is probabilistic and all-or-none, so that at rapid pacing rates the 

switch like behavior of the probability of sparking 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 favors alternating sequences of release and no-release. This 

sequence of release events is stochastic and eventually fluctuations desynchronize neighboring units. For a 

sufficiently steep curve, however, fluctuations are smaller and alternating sequences persists for a large number of 

beats, so nearest-neighbor diffusion suffices to synchronize sequences that are in phase. We find that this 

synchronization of local alternating sequences occurs via an order-disorder transition in the Ising universality class. 

This result can be partially explained by the observation that a ±1 alternans phase differs only by a shift of one 

beat, and therefore should be dynamically equivalent.  This underlying Ising symmetry of the system (first pointed 

out in [8]), combined with short range diffusive coupling, is likely the key factor that places the system in the Ising 

universality class.  

Critical behavior has also been observed in subcellular Ca dynamics in the absence of pacing. In particular, Nivala  

et al  [24] demonstrated that Ca released in the cell can be tuned to exhibit a self-organized critical state (SOC) in 

which stochastic Ca sparks generate Ca spark clusters of different sizes via propagating Ca waves. This critical 

behavior is distinct from the order-disorder transition reported here which occurs in response to pacing.  In both 

cases Ca diffusion plays a crucial role.  For the Ising transition Ca diffusion is required to synchronize local 

alternating responses, while the SOC state requires diffusion to induce propagating Ca waves in the cell. These 

results reveals that Ca signaling in cardiac myocytes exhibits a broad range of distinct critical behavior.   

The emergence of equilibrium properties in non-equilibrium systems has also been observed in coupled chaotic 

maps which exhibit phase transitions [22,25], where it has been shown that a course grained description satisfies the 

conditions for equilibrium statistical mechanics, such as detailed balance and Gibbs distributions [26]. Our results 

suggest that this scenario explains the phase transition towards Ca alternans, where the probabilistic response of 

6 
 



RyR and LCC channels, which determines the strength of local fluctuations, plays the role of temperature. It is the 

interplay between this local stochasticity and diffusive coupling that is responsible for the rich spatiotemporal 

structures that exhibit critical behavior.
