This paper presents a 3D numerical study of the bubble generation process in

a T-junction, performed with the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics solver

ANSYS Fluent v15.0.7. Numerical results on bubble generation frequency, bubble

velocity, volume void fraction, bubble volume, and characteristics bubble lengths are

compared with experimental data. Additionally, a new simple �tting for the bubble

generation frequency, based upon previously reported experimental works, is proposed

here.

I. Introduction

Capillary gas-liquid two-phase �ows occur in increasingly more modern applications in space-

based systems. This is mainly due to the fact that two-phase systems present an improvement in

performances and e�ciency, as well as signi�cant reductions in weight, with respect to single-phase

systems. Some remarkable examples in di�erent aerospace �elds can be found for example in space

bioreactors, chemical contactors, life support systems for human exploration and development of

space (HEDS), thermal management systems and propulsion systems. A full understanding of the

behaviour of gas-liquid interface and �ow characteristics in gravity reduced environments is thus a

major necessity for the development of these technologies. Di�erent methods have been developed

to produce controlled two-phase �ows in microgravity conditions. In this paper, we focus on the

analysis of a micro T-junction in which bubbles are generated and dispersed into a continuous liquid

in a very regular way and with small dispersion in bubble size.

Numerous experimental studies have been made on the generation of bubbles and droplets in

T-junction bubble generators as the ones performed in [1, 2]. In the recent past, di�erent Compu-

tational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods have also been used in order to study similar devices. A

commercial CFD package was used by Qian & Lawal [3] to simulate the squeezing regime during the

bubble formation in a T-junction microchannel, focusing on studying the e�ects of pressure, surface

tension and shear stress action on the gas thread. Kashid et al. [4] discussed CFD modelling aspects

of internal circulation and slug �ow generation. The slug �ow formation in a 120◦ Y-junction was

simulated and velocity pro�les inside the slug were obtained. A numerical investigation by means

of a phase-�eld model of the breakup dynamics of streams of immiscible �uids in a micro�uidic

T-junction was carried out by De Menech et al. [5], where three regimes of formation of droplets

(squeezing, dripping and jetting) were identi�ed and analysed.

More recently, Arias et al. [6] presented a �uid dynamics numerical study on the formation of

mini-bubbles (bubbles with a diameter of the order of 10−3 m) in a 2D T-junction, and results on the

behaviour of bubble velocity, volume void fraction, bubble generation frequency and characteristic

lengths were obtained and compared to experimental data. Also using a two-dimensional numerical

model with Volume of Fluid method (VOF), the phenomena of alternating droplet formation, with

3



applications such as nanoparticle synthesis, hydrogel bead generation, and cell transplantation in

biomedical therapy, was studied by Ngo et al. [7]. Malekzadeh & Roohi [8] focused in the two-

dimensional bubble formation process by analysing in detail the e�ects of three main parameters,

that are: the capillary number, the contact angle and the gas-liquid �ow rate ratio. As for 3D

simulations, droplet formation in T-junction microchannels was studied using the Lattice Boltzmann

method by Shi et al. [9] and simulations in heat exchangers using the VOF method were performed

by Ben Saad et al. [10].

The paper presented here is a continuation of the study by Arias et al. [6], completing it and

extending it to 3D. Some parameters are now studied in more depth, such as the bubble generation

frequency, a new �t for frequency being used here, and new values of interest are presented, such as

the bubble volume, the bubble equivalent diameter and the unit cell length. Section II presents the

T-junction problem statement. Section III summarises the methodology used in the experimental

study, following the one used in Arias et al. [6], as well as the hypotheses used in the numerical

simulations and their validations. Section IV exposes the results of the numerical simulations and

compares them to the experimental ones. Finally some conclusions are drawn in section V.

II. Problem statement

This study aims to simulate a bubble generator in which liquid and gas are injected at perpen-

dicular directions into a 1 mm internal diameter capillary T-junction with a total length of 10 mm,

see �gure 1. In order to compare numerical simulations with realistic results, CFD simulations

have been carried out following the experimental conditions as much as possible. The �uids used in

experiments and CFD simulations are air and water, both of them considered incompressible and

isothermal, at a room temperature of 25◦C. Standard physical values at that given temperature are

assumed for viscosity (µG = 10
−5 Pa.s and µL = 10

−3 Pa.s for air and water, respectively), density

(ρG = 1.225 kg/m
3 and ρL = 10

3 kg/m3 for air and water, respectively) and surface tension at the

gas-liquid interface (σ = 0.072 N/m).

The experimental setup used in this study has been reported in previous works by Arias et al.

[11, 12]. Its particularity is that the gas and liquid volumetric �ow rates can be controlled in a very

accurate way. Note that, in the whole study results are presented as a function of the super�cial

4

velocities de�ned as USG = QG/A and USL = QL/A, where USG and USL are the gas and liquid

super�cial velocities, QG and QL the gas and liquid volumetric �ow rates, and A the capillary

cross-section area.

The gas super�cial velocities used in the experiments range from 0.062 to 0.473 m/s, whereas

three values (0.106, 0.318 and 0.531 m/s) are used for the liquid super�cial velocity. A total of 23

experiments are compared with the results obtained in the numerical simulations. Although the core

of this work is the simulation of 3D two-phase �ows, 16 new experiments widen and complement

the knowledge provided by the 7 experiments previously presented in Arias et al. [6]. Additionally,

three more simulations were conducted at a very low gas �ow rate (USG = 0.025 m/s) for each

liquid super�cial velocity (note that no experiment had been conducted for this USG value).

The dimensionless Bond number (Bo) represents the balance between gravitational and surface

tension forces. Bo is commonly de�ned as (ρL− ρG)gφ2c/σ, where ρL and ρG are the liquid and gas

densities, g the gravitational acceleration, φc the capillary internal diameter and σ the surface tension

at the gas-liquid interface. ρL is usually much larger than ρG (∆ρ ≈ ρL), which leads to the next

simpli�ed de�nition of the Bond number: Bo = ρLgφ
2
c/σ. Following this last de�nition, Bo = 0.139

in this study. As a consequence, gravity plays a smaller role than the surface tension in the bubble

generation process, and the formation and detachment of bubbles is mainly dominated by the

competition between the capillary and the liquid drag forces, which can be evaluated by the Weber

number. Suo & Gri�th [13] developed a criterion based on the Bond number that determines that

gravitational e�ects become negligible with respect to capillary e�ects when Bo < 0.29, resulting in

the irrelevance of the channel orientation. Therefore, the present analysis can be considered gravity

independent and assuming g = 0 m/s2 becomes a valid approach for the numerical simulations.

5



The gas Weber number can be de�ned asWeG = ρGφcUG
2/σ, where UG is the gas velocity, also

commonly referred as bubble velocity. According to Rezkallah [14], when the criterion WeG <∼ 2 is

accomplished, capillary forces overcome inertial forces, and the bubble formation is controlled by

the surface tension. Only bubble and slug �ow regimes are expected to be observed in these cir-

cumstances. In our experiments, 0.159 m/s ≤ UG ≤ 1.143 m/s (more information about the bubble

velocity can be found in section IVB), which leads to 4.3×10−4 ≤WeG ≤ 2.2×10−2, corresponding

to the surface tension controlled region. The liquid Weber number (WeSL = ρLφcUSL
2/σ) ranges

from 0.16 to 3.92.

The average mixture super�cial velocity Reynolds number can be de�ned asReM = ρLφcUM/µL,

where UM is the sum of the gas and liquid super�cial velocities. In the experiments, 0.167 m/s

≤ UM ≤ 1 m/s, which leads to 167 ≤ ReM ≤ 1000. The liquid super�cial velocity Reynolds number

(ReSL = ρLφcUSL/µL), ranges from 106 to 530. These values of ReM and ReSL correspond to

�ows in laminar conditions.

Finally, the capillary number Ca = We/Re is used to compare viscous forces and surface

tension e�ects at the interface. The corresponding range of the capillary number, based on the

liquid super�cial velocity, is 1.5× 10−3 ≤ CaSL ≤ 7.4× 10−3.

Having used the same �uid physical properties and gas and liquid super�cial velocities in ex-

periments and simulations, the bubble generation behaviour in numerical simulations is expected to

be similar to the experimental one.

III. Methodology

A. Experiments

Experiments were performed at constant liquid super�cial velocity while increasing the gas

super�cial velocity. For each pair of velocities USG-USL, images were taken with a high-speed camera

at 4000 f.p.s. once the �ow stabilised and the generation of bubbles was regular and periodic. Images

of the two-phase �ows were classi�ed into bubble or slug �ow regimes, according to the Dukler's

criterion (see section IV). Bubble generation frequency was measured by counting the total number

of bubbles over a long period of time, whereas the bubble velocity was measured directly over the

calibrated images, by taking into account the displacement of the foremost part of a single bubble.

6



The unit cell length was also measured over the calibrated images. It was measured, both in the

experiments and in the numerical simulations, as the distance between the most forward points of

two consecutive bubbles.

B. Numerical simulations

1. Flow solver

All numerical simulations were carried out using a commercial CFD solver, ANSYS Fluent

v15.0.7. Note that this CFD solver is di�erent from the numerical code JADIM used in [6]. The

VOF method was used to model the two immiscible �uids by solving a single set of momentum

equations and tracking the volume fraction of each �uid throughout the domain. In each control

volume, the volume fractions of both phases sum to unity.

The tracking of the interface between the phases is accomplished by the solution of a continuity

equation for the volume fraction of one of the phases [15]. For the qth phase, this equation has the

following form:

1

ρq

[
∂

∂t
(αqρq) +∇·(αqρqvq) =

n∑
p=1

(ṁpq − ṁqp)

]
(1)

where ρq, αq and vq are the density, volume void fraction and velocity of phase q, ṁpq is the

mass transfer from phase p to phase q and ṁqp is the mass transfer from phase q to phase p. The

volume fraction equation is not solved for the primary phase; the primary-phase volume fraction is

computed based on the following constraint:
∑n

q=1 αq = 1.

The �elds for variables and properties are shared by the phases and represent volume-averaged

values, as long as the volume fraction of each of the phases is known at each location. Thus the

variables and properties in any given cell are either purely representative of one of the phases, or

representative of a mixture of the phases, depending on the volume fraction values. That is, if the

water volume fraction in the cell is denoted as aw, then three conditions are possible. If aw = 0,

the cell is empty of water, if aw = 1, the cell is full of water, and if 0 < aw < 1, the cell contains

the interface between water and air [15]. Based on the local value of aw, the appropriate properties

and variables are assigned to each control volume within the domain.

7



An explicit formulation is used for the VOF model, with a Courant number of 0.25, and the

PRESTO! (PREssure STaggering Option) scheme is used for pressure interpolation. This scheme

uses the discrete continuity balance for a staggered control volume about the face to compute the

staggered pressure. This procedure is similar in spirit to the staggered-grid schemes used with

structured meshes [15]. For the volume fraction spatial discretisation scheme, the geometric re-

construction scheme is used, which represents the interface between �uids using a piecewise-linear

approach. In Fluent this scheme is the most accurate and is applicable for general unstructured

meshes. The geometric reconstruction scheme is generalised for unstructured meshes from the work

of Youngs [16]. Finally, a second-order upwind scheme is used for spatial discretisation.

The VOF method also includes the e�ects of surface tension along the interface between each

pair of phases. The surface tension model in Fluent is the continuum surface force model proposed

by Brackbill et al. [17]. With this model, the addition of surface tension to the VOF calculation

results in a source term in the momentum equation. As commented in section II, a surface tension

of 0.072 N/m is applied.

The following boundary conditions were set for the numerical simulations. All walls are treated

as no-slip smooth walls. A wall adhesion angle in conjunction with the surface tension model is also

applied in the VOF model [17]. Rather than imposing this boundary condition at the wall itself, the

contact angle that the �uid is assumed to make with the wall is used to adjust the surface normal

in cells near the wall [15]. This so-called dynamic boundary condition results in the adjustment of

the curvature of the surface near the wall. The contact angle is the angle between the wall and the

tangent to the interface at the wall. A contact angle of 0◦ was set up as wall adhesion (hydrophilic

condition) on the horizontal walls, and of 25◦ on the vertical walls, based on experimental data from

Arias et al. [6], see Section III B 3 for more details on this.

Water and air inlets are considered as velocity inlets, with the corresponding �uid velocity in

each case of study, namely USG and USL. At the water inlet, the fraction of water is considered as

1 and at the air inlet, the fraction of air is the one set to 1. The outlet of the T-junction is set up

as a pressure outlet.

An operating pressure of 101325 Pa is set up at a point close to the air inlet, that is, at a point

8

where there will always be only air. Finally the gravity value is set to 0, as explained in Section II.

2. Mesh

The computational mesh was composed of 413000 elements. An in�ation mesh comprising 15

layers was used along all the walls, with a �rst layer height of 0.005 mm. A body sizing of 0.045 mm

was used in all the domain. The resulting mesh is a mix of hexahedral (close to the walls) and

tetrahedral (in the core of the domain) elements, as it can be seen in Figure 2. The hex dominant

option has been chosen, resulting in a fewer number of elements than if mainly tetrahedral elements

had been considered. Mesh independence is presented in section III B 3.

A �rst-order implicit scheme is used for the transient formulation. Time step independence is

also presented in section III B 3. In order to obtain a converged solution, the calculation was always

continued until at least 7 or 8 bubbles of air were generated.

3. CFD validation

The mesh convergence is �rst checked. Three meshes are considered: a coarse one (220000

elements), a second one (413000 elements) obtained by multiplying the body sizing and �rst layer

height of the boundary layer by 0.75, and a third one (879000 elements), obtained by multiplying

again the mesh dimensions by 0.75. Three independent parameters of study are used: the bubble

frequency (f), velocity (UG) and volume (VB). Absolute values and percentages of error with respect

to the �nest mesh are shown in table 1, for USL = 0.318 m/s and USG = 0.242 m/s.

These results show that for the 413000-element mesh, errors due to the mesh remain within

a relatively small margin (≤ 3.1%); this is thus the mesh that has been chosen for the numerical

study.

Next, the in�uence of the time step has been studied considering the chosen mesh of 413000

elements. Three values of ∆t are considered: 2.5× 10−6, 5× 10−6 and 10× 10−6 s. Again absolute

values of bubble frequency, velocity and volume are shown in table 2, as well as the percentages of

error with respect to the smallest ∆t, for USL = 0.318 m/s and USG = 0.242 m/s.

Table 2 shows that the three values of ∆t lead to similar values (all errors ≤ 5.0%), smaller for

the value of ∆t = 5× 10−6 s (≤ 2.1%) than for the value ∆t = 10× 10−6 s. Therefore, the middle

value, ∆t = 5× 10−6 s, has been chosen for the rest of the CFD study.

In order to further validate the chosen mesh size and ∆t value, both mesh and time convergence

tests were repeated at USL = 0.531 m/s and USG = 0.469 m/s, which are the highest liquid and

gas velocities in the study. Results showed errors of less than 3% between the mesh of 879000 and

413000 elements, and of less than 1% between ∆t = 2.5× 10−6 s and ∆t = 5× 10−6 s, con�rming

the adequacy of the chosen mesh and ∆t.

Another critical parameter to validate is the contact angle boundary condition on the vertical

wall. As commented in Section III B 1, a constant value of 25◦ is imposed on the vertical capil-

lary, based on experimental data from Arias et al. [6]. Nevertheless, several studies emphasise the

complexity of the mathematical paradox that supposes a contact line moving along a no-slip solid

surface, which is the case on the vertical wall. Of the three forces acting on the �uid (inertial,

viscous, and surface tension, assuming gravity is negligible), theoretical studies suggest that the

viscous dissipation becomes very strong near a moving contact line [18]. It then leads to a curvature

of the interface that varies sharply near the contact line, which can cause the contact angle to di�er

signi�cantly from the measured interface angle, even at short distances away from the contact line

[19]. Given the complexity of this phenomenon, a detailed study of the dynamic contact angle is out

of the scope of the study proposed here, and a constant value is therefore imposed on the vertical

wall.

In order to validate the experimental value of 25◦, di�erent values are tested between 0◦ and

90◦, and the in�uence on the bubble frequency, velocity and volume is studied and presented in

Table 3, for USL = 0.318 m/s and USG = 0.242 m/s. Table 3 shows that the contact angle highly

in�uences the numerical value of the bubble frequency, velocity and volume. CFD results get closer

to the experimental ones for a contact angle between 45◦ and 60◦ for the bubble frequency, and

for a value between 60◦ and 90◦ for the bubble volume, whereas the error of the bubble velocity

is more or less constant and remains within the mesh error margin. Therefore, no single value of

the contact angle can provide simultaneously close-to-experimental results for the bubble frequency,

velocity and volume, not even for a single pair USL − USG.

11



Figure 3 now shows views of the bubble generation for the CFD simulations, for contact angles

of 25◦, 45◦ and 60◦, and compares them to the experimental one. The moment just before the

detachment of the bubble is studied. Contrary to the results from Table 3, it can be seen that for

angles bigger than 25◦, the detachment mechanism di�ers from the one observed in the experiment,

and more signi�cantly as the contact angle increases. The contact line reaches lower positions

on the vertical wall for larger values of the contact angle, and consequently the pinch-o� region

moves downstream. From an experimental point of view, this displacement occurs when the liquid

velocity or its viscosity increases, because the liquid shear force becomes dominant over the e�ect

of the buildup of the pressure immediately upstream the bubble [20]. According to Oishi et al.

[21], this e�ect starts to take place when the capillary number (CSL) is greater than 5.8 × 10−3.

The experimental picture shown in �gure 3 corresponds to a value CSL = 4.4 × 10−3, in which

regime the liquid shear force should not be strong enough to move downstream the pinch-o� region

as much as it is observed in the 60◦ numerical simulation. Therefore, this value of contact angle

clearly contradicts experimental evidences, even though it provides close-to-experimental numerical

results for the bubble frequency and volume. The best resemblance with experimental pinch-o� is

thus obtained for a contact angle of 25◦ in the numerical simulation, which is also con�rmed by

comparing the position of the contact line in the vertical capillary. For these reasons, and despite

the numerical errors in the bubble frequency and volume observed for this value, a contact angle of

25◦ is chosen in the rest of the study.

4. CFD metrics

Figure 4 shows an example of data obtained as a post-process of the CFD simulations. It shows

the propagation of the bubble, through the fraction of air at two cross-sections of the domain located

at 7 and 8 mm from the beginning of the tube, as a function of time. This allows to calculate the

bubble frequency f , as the inverse of the time Tf between two bubbles at the cross-section, and

its velocity UG, as the distance between two cross-sections (here 7 and 8 mm) divided by the time

TS needed for the bubble to travel this distance. Its volume VB is also calculated from this �gure,

integrating the total fraction of air of a bubble over time AB and multiplying by its velocity and by

indicated in the upper right corner

the area of a 1 mm diameter circle. Since, this method could introduce some uncertainties related

to UG, the bubble volume was also computed de�ning the bubble interface at a given instant and

integrating numerically the volume inside. This method was applied to three conveniently chosen

USL-USG pairs (0.106-0.344, 0.318-0.242 and 0.531-0.068 m/s). The relative error was found to be

smaller than 1.95% in all cases and the �rst method to compute VB prevailed due to its simplicity.

Finally, the volume average void fraction, α, was estimated for both the experiments and the

CFD simulations with the expression:

α =
USG
UG

(2)

Note that de�ned in this way, the void fraction di�ers from the volumetric gas quality, β, which

is de�ned as the ratio between the gas and the total volume �ow rates: β = QG/(QG +QL).

For this study, all simulations have been performed on a laptop computer, with 8.00GB of RAM

and an Intel i7−4500U @1.80GHz quad core CPU. It takes around 24 hours to simulate 30ms, that

is, the fastest simulations were �nished within a day whereas the slowest ones took up to 2 or 3

days.

IV. Results and discussion

A set of 26 new 3D numerical simulations are compared with a set of 23 experiments. 16 of

these experiments are a novelty with respect to [6], as explained in section II. It can be seen that

numerical simulations satisfactorily reproduce trains of bubbles as the ones obtained in experiments,

see �gures 5-7. Note that, as it will be detailed later, the bubble frequency is higher in the CFD

simulation than in the experiments. Thus the choice has been made to show the trains of bubbles

of �gures 5-7 at the same stage of formation, which does not correspond to the same times.

In contrast with the study provided by Arias et al. [6], here no arti�cial pinch-o� mechanism has

been used in numerical simulations to detach bubbles. Bubbles were generated, both in experiments

and numerical simulations, with high regularity and small size dispersion. Such periodicity allows

to use the concept of unit cell, according to which the �ow can be decomposed in duplicated units

formed by a single bubble and a slug of liquid. The unit cell is mainly characterised by its length (see

section IVC), which can be estimated as the distance between the tips of two consecutive bubbles.

Two types of �ow patterns, the bubble and the slug �ow regimes, were obtained in the sim-

ulations and in the experiments (accordingly to the criterion WeG <∼ 2 explained in section II).

As expected, no strati�ed, churn or annular �ows were found for these values of gas and liquid

super�cial velocities neither in experiments nor in numerical simulations [13, 14, 22]. Both kinds

of �ow patterns analysed here correspond to intermittent �ows, in which the gas phase is dispersed

into the liquid phase. Flows were classi�ed into bubble or slug �ow regime according to the Duk-

ler's criterion [23], which de�nes the transition between the bubble and the slug �ow regime as the

moment when the bubble, assuming that it were spherical, reaches a diameter equal to the capillary

�ow regime, its diameter being smaller than the capillary diameter. In this �gure, bubbles are

not exactly spherical. This is a consequence of the liquid drag and shear forces, which noticeably

deform bubbles longitudinally. Figs. 6 and 7 show two examples of slug �ow regime, the former

being known as short Taylor bubble and the latter as middle Taylor bubble [24]. Bubbles from the

slug �ow regime are characterised by a bullet-shaped body, rounded at the front part and mainly

�attened at the rear of it.

In every case, bubbles have an elongated rear part just after the detachment, this elongated

shape being a remnant of the squeezed gas thread that was connecting the new bubble with the

single-phase gas. From that moment, the e�ect of the surface tension tries to minimise the total

surface of the bubble, which results in the vibration of the bubble surface until it stabilises. It can be

seen that numerical simulations correctly reproduce the elasticity and �uctuation of the gas-liquid

interface during the bubble detachment stage described here, but that the formation of bubbles was

faster in the numerical simulations than in the experiments. This was expected from the contact

angle study in Section III B 3, and the following sections will make further reference to this fact.

Next sections focus in a more exhaustive validation and comparison of numerical simulations

with experimental data. Several parameters are selected to perform such a validation: bubble

generation frequency, bubble velocity, volumetric void fraction, bubble equivalent diameter and

A. Bubble generation frequency

Figure 8 shows the evolution of the bubble generation frequency when increasing the super�cial

gas velocity. Data corresponding to three di�erent liquid super�cial velocities has been plotted

for both experiments and numerical simulations. Although the same values of USG and USL from

experiments were usually used in numerical simulations, some new values of USG were also simulated

in order to enrich the knowledge about the behaviour of bubble generation frequency. This is the

case of the three points at USG = 0.025 m/s, which are not present in the experimental data.

According to Arias et al. [11], at very low gas �ow rate f follows a close-to-linear tendency

that progressively curves when increasing USG until reaching a saturation value fsat, which remains

constant thereafter. Consequently, two main di�erent regimes arise during the bubble generation

process: the linear regime, at low gas �ow rates, and the saturation regime, for larger gas �ow rates.

The existence of these two regimes was already con�rmed and reported by the same authors in [12].

Figure 8 shows how f approaches its corresponding saturated value for the three di�erent values

of USL in both experiments and simulations. The saturation frequency increases when increasing

USL, which is a consequence of the corresponding increment of the liquid drag force, the main force

in charged of detaching bubbles [25, 26]. Therefore, larger liquid drag forces are expected to produce

smaller bubbles resulting in larger frequency values [11, 12]. This e�ect also explains why the linear

slope at the origin, a0, increases when increasing the liquid �ow rate as observed for the three values

of USL presented in the �gures and in table 4.

As shown in �gure 8, numerical simulations satisfactorily describe the behaviour of f observed

in experiments. Numerical simulations agree qualitatively, but not quite quantitatively, with exper-

imental results. They provide values in accordance with the experimental ones, but always larger

(coherently, bubble sizes are expected to be slightly smaller, see section IVC). Di�erences in fre-

quency between experimental and numerical results range from 3.5%, which would be within the

margin of error of the mesh, to 34%, for the smallest value of USG and USL, which is a large dif-

ference, with an average value of 17%. As commented in Section III B 3, the boundary condition

of the solid-air-water contact line is the key of this problem. A constant contact angle of 25o is

imposed on the vertical wall, corresponding to the one that best recreates the bubble detachment

observed in the experiments. Nevertheless, the variation of the physical contact angle during the

bubble formation process is not reproduced here, leading to CFD results always faster than the

experimental ones. Future work should focus on the dynamic study of the contact angle, which is

out of the scope of the study presented here.

A simple exponential �t is used with the values of bubble generation frequency in �gure 8:

18

(3)

Eq. 3 de�nes a simple function aiming to connect smoothly the linear part and the constant

saturation value observed in �gure 8, but it does not pretend to be a model for the bubble generation

frequency. Only two parameters are considered in Eq. 3, the initial slope a0 of the linear regime,

and the value of the saturation frequency fsat. According to the �rst-order Taylor series expansion

of Eq. 3, f tends to f0 = a0USG when USG tends to zero. On the other hand, Eq. 3 tends to fsat for

larger values of USG. Both parameters have a clear physical meaning, as explained below. Assuming

a regular generation of bubbles in size, the gas �ow rate injected into the capillary must be equal

to the bubble volume times the frequency, QG = VBf , which leads to f = QG/VB = AUSG/VB , in

terms of the gas �ow rate or the super�cial gas velocity. Matching this expression with the �rst-

order Taylor series expansion of Eq. 3 shows that a0 = A/VB . The initial slope of the linear regime

corresponds to the maximum value of the ratio f/USG for each given USL. Then, a0 is related to the

minimum bubble volume that can be generated for each given USL, that is, VB |min = A/a0. The

saturation frequency is related in turn to the minimum time required to form a bubble, marking a

limiting scale for the bubble generation process [11].

Table 4 summarises the values obtained for a0 and fsat when �tting both the experimental and

numerical data by using Eq. 3. In every case, these values were found to be of the same order of

magnitude for numerical and experimental values, but larger for the simulations.

B. Bubble velocity and void fraction

The bubble velocity is presented in �gure 9 as a function of the average mixture super�cial

velocity UM . It shows how, as expected, UG increases when UM increases and how both the

experimental and the numerical data follow linear tendencies. The bubble velocity data �ts the

drift-�ux model, de�ned by Zuber & Findlay [27], which under the hypothesis of negligible gravity

levels or non-dominant gravitational forces can be written as [6, 28, 29]:

UG = C0UM = C0(USG + USL), (4)

where C0 is the void fraction distribution coe�cient, which considers both the e�ect of the

non-uniform velocities of the gas and liquid phases and of the void pro�les through the capillary

diameter. Following Eq. 4, the value of C0 has been calculated using a linear �tting in �gure 9. A

value of C0 = 1.10 was found for the experimental data. Numerical simulations correctly reproduced

the same behaviour than the one observed in the experiments, with C0 = 1.15 (4.5% greater than

in the experiments). In both cases, the value of C0 is coherent with the range 1.1-1.2 reported in

the related literature for similar two-phase �ows [6, 29, 30].

Both values of C0 (greater than 1) prove that bubbles move faster than the mixture, which is

due to the fact that bubbles move mainly through the centreline of the capillary, not being attached

to the upper part of the capillary in any case. It proves the negligible role of the gravitational forces

[29], agreeing with the small Bond number value in the experiments, see section II, and validates the

absence of gravity in the CFD simulations. The percentage of error with respect to the experimental

data range from 0.8% to 19.3%, for the smallest value of USG and USL, with an average value of

5.4%.

Figures 10 shows the volume void fraction as a function of the ratio between the gas and

the corresponding value of C0. Both experimental and numerical data �t well to their respective

prediction. The values of void fraction were found to be slightly smaller in the numerical simulations,

coherently with their previously observed greater values of velocity. A minimum relative error of

0.8% was found with respect to the experimental data, being 15.5% the maximum relative error and

5.0% the average relative error. Two points appear below the value USG/USL = 0.1. As explained

before, additional numerical simulations were run for very small values of USG (0.025 m/s). 3D

numerical simulations proved thus to be useful in this case by providing information that was not

available from the experiments.

Normalising the expression QG = VBf with the cross-section area times the capillary diameter,

a non-dimensional expression of the bubble volume can be obtained:

. (6)

The bubble volume was measured from the 3D numerical simulations, see subsection III B 4.

Since no direct measures of VB could be performed in the experiments, Figure 11 shows the non-

dimensional bubble volume as a function of the ratio USG/(fφc) for numerical data only. It shows

how, as expected, the bubble volume increases when increasing the gas super�cial velocity. Data �t

well to the prediction of Eq. 6, which con�rms that bubbles were generated with high regularity.

In order to provide a bubble size quantitative comparison between experiments and simula-

tions, an equivalent diameter φB has been considered for each bubble. This equivalent diameter

is estimated by matching the bubble volume predicted by Eq. 6 to the volume of a sphere with a

diameter equal to φB . Being VS = πφ

Figure 12 shows the dimensionless equivalent diameter as a function of the gas super�cial veloc-

ity. Di�erences in equivalent diameter between experimental and numerical results range from 1.1%

to 9.1% with an average of 5.2%. The equivalent diameter is estimated using Eq. 7 in both cases.

The lines correspond to Eq. 7, in which the �tting of f provided by Eq. 3 is used. Both experimental

and numerical data correctly agree with the combination of Eqs. 3 and 7. As a consequence of the

faster bubble generation process observed in the numerical simulations, the equivalent diameters

are found to be slightly smaller in numerical simulations than those from experiments, especially at

low liquid super�cial velocity. It can also be observed that increasing the liquid super�cial velocity

causes the bubble volume and thus the equivalent diameter to decrease. Finally, �gure 12 allows

distinguishing the bubble and the slug �ow regime by means of the Dukler's criterion, see section IV.

Bubbles with φ̄B < 1 correspond to the bubble �ow regime, whereas these with φ̄B > 1 fall into the

category of the slug �ow.

23



The last part of the validation of the numerical simulations focuses on the unit cell length, LUC .

Bubbles displace at a speed of UG, being 1/f the time required to form and detach a single bubble

(same time as the one required to generate a new unit cell). As a consequence, the unit cell length

must be equal to the bubble velocity times the time required to form a unit cell. The unit cell length

can then be expressed as:

L̄UC =
UG
fφc

, (8)

where it is normalised with the capillary diameter. Values of the non-dimensional unit cell

length are plotted in �gure 13. Both data, corresponding to experimental and numerical data, �t

well to the prediction of Eq. 8. Relative errors range from 2.0% to 20.8% with an average value of

9.5%.

Figure 14 plots the dimensionless unit cell length L̄UC as a function of the gas super�cial velocity

USG for each liquid super�cial velocity. A theoretical prediction can be found in this case when

using Eq. 4 into Eq. 8:

L̄UC =
C0(USG + USL)

fφc
(9)

Figure 14 shows a non-monotonic behaviour with a minimum value of L̄UC for each given value of

USL. This minimum is located at the crossover region between the linear and the saturation regime

and it can be explained taking into account the dependence of f in USG. The time required to form

a single bubble decreases as the bubble generation frequency increases, which in turn decreases the

total quantity of liquid that can be injected into the unit cell, producing shorter unit cells. Within

the linear regime, small variations of the gas super�cial velocity typically cause the generation

frequency to largely increase, which decreases rapidly the unit cell length towards its minimum

value. On the other hand, within the saturation regime, the increase of the gas super�cial velocity

makes the bubbles grow in size while maintaining almost the same frequency. This enlargement

of bubbles explains the smooth increasing of the unit cell length beyond its minimum value, as

USG increases. As previously discussed, since the bubble formation process is found to be faster in

V. Conclusions

This paper presents a study on the numerical simulation of bubbles generated in a 3D T-

junction (1 mm internal diameter capillaries), with an air/water mixture, using the commercial

25



CFD solver ANSYS Fluent v15.0.7. Numerical results were compared with experimental data, both

cases following the same conditions.

Several trains of bubbles were simulated with high regularity and small dispersion in size during

the bubble formation process. No arti�cial pinch-o� mechanism was required for the detachment of

bubbles. Bubble or slug �ow regimes were obtained in all cases, both in experiments and numerical

simulations. Regarding the slug �ow, only short and middle Taylor bubbles were generated. Nu-

merical simulations satisfactorily reproduced the formation of bubbles, both in the stabilised shape

and in the evolution of shape during the formation of bubbles.

Several parameters were compared between 3D-CFD results and experimental data, such as

bubble generation frequency, bubble velocity, void fraction, bubble equivalent diameter and unit

cell length. Results were found to be of the same order of magnitude in both simulations and

experiments, though due to a constant contact angle being imposed on the vertical wall, CFD

simulations always predicted larger frequencies, resulting in smaller sized bubbles. Future work

should focus in studying into more details the boundary condition of the solid-air-water contact

line in the numerical simulation, in order to further improve these results. 3D-CFD simulations

allowed to study new zones of interest (especially at low gas �ow rate) and new parameters such as

the bubble volume (not available from experimental results), showing that this is a useful tool to

improve our current experimental knowledge on two-phase �ows in minichannels.
