S1. Sonication versus non-sonication experiment 

 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown in a flask of capacity 100 ml with 80 mL of glucose broth 

(Sharlab, Spain) for 40 hours at 27ºC. Once grown, and in aseptic conditions, a simple test was run 

to assess the robustness of the visual inspection of the digital image analysis described in the 

material and methods section for the identification of budded cells and unbudded cells. Two 

samples were taken from the growing culture. The first sample was diluted in a sterile saline 

solution and homogenized using a Vortex mixer (according to the material and methods section of 

this work), while the second sample (the rest of the suspension) was sonicated for 15 seconds, at 

70W and 20 KHZ (Bandelin sonopuls GM70, Germany). A set of about 350 cells was inspected for 

each experimental condition in order to identify budded cells and unbudded cells. The classification 

process followed the same criteria explained in the material and methods section of the main 

manuscript. The cross tabulation of the counts of the four groups of data obtained (Sonication-

Budded, Sonication-Unbudded, Non-sonication-Budded, Non-sonication-Unbudded) is shown in 

Table S1. These data were analyzed statistically by means of a Chi-square test for independence. 

This test was used to determine whether there was a significant association between the two 

variables. The statistical results suggested that the variables were not related at the 5% significance 

level (p-value = 0.144 according to the Pearson Chi-Square test, p-value = 0.162 according the 

Fisher’s exact test). Therefore, according to the test, the hypothesis of no association between the 



two variables cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.

S2. Experimental distributions of the following morphological variables of yeast cells: 

perimeter, major diameter, minor diameter, elongation (or aspect ratio) and circularity 

 

The temporal distributions of the cell perimeters (Figure S2.1) display in general similar behaviors 

to those observed with the cell areas (Figure 5).  

Figure S2.2 presents histograms of the major and minor diameter of the cells. Under aerobic 

conditions, the values of the minor diameters present unimodal distributions with high percentages 

for values between 5 and 7 μm, with only few changes depending on the growth phase. 

Nevertheless, there is a slight shift of higher percentages to high values during the log phase, and 

then a decline in the stationary phase. Under microaerophilic conditions, the minor diameters 

initially follow a unimodal distribution, and as the lag phase progresses, the distribution becomes 

rectangular with a range of percentages for values between 5 and 8.5 μm. In the log phase the 

distribution reverts to unimodal with higher percentages for minor diameters between 6 and 7.5 μm, 

and in the stationary phase the values of the minor diameters decrease (higher percentages 

correspond to diameters between 5 and 7 μm). The distributions of the major diameters vary in a 

more noticeable way depending on the growth phase. In aerobic conditions, they proceed from 

unimodal distributions in the samples corresponding to the lag phase (with sizes similar to the 

minor diameters, less than 8 μm) to rectangular distributions in the log phase samplings, in which a 

large part of the population increases the size of the major diameter and may reach up to 13 μm. 

Finally, in the samples corresponding to the stationary phase, bimodal distributions were observed, 

with the predominant peak displaced again to the left with diameters similar to the values of the 

minor diameters, and therefore reducing again its size. Under microaerophilic conditions, the 



distributions of the major diameters vary more visibly depending on the growth phase, although to a 

lesser extent than in aerobic conditions.  

The temporal evolutions of the variables estimating shape, namely, elongation (or aspect ratio) and 

circularity are displayed in Figures S2.3 and S2.4, respectively. It can be seen in Figure S2.3 that, at 

the beginning of the aerobic temporal evolution, in the lag phase, it is observed that the values of 

elongation fall below 1.5, whereas right at the beginning of the log phase this boundary is exceeded. 

The percentage of cells with values higher than 1.5 increases along the log phase and decreases 

again on reaching the stationary phase, yet without completely vanishing. The temporal 

distributions of the elongation of the cells growing under microaerophilic conditions are similar to 

bimodal distributions. In the lag phase there is a higher percentage of cells with elongations lower 

than 1.5, but during the log phase the higher percentages correspond to values greater than 1.5. At 

the end of the log phase and beginning of the stationary phase there is a tendency to reverse the 

percentages again, that is, a small decrease in the proportion of cells with high elongations can be 

observed. The temporal distributions of the parameter circularity in aerobic conditions evolve 

according to the population growth phase (Figure S2.4). In the lag phase, the values range from 0.6 

to 0.9, with a higher percentage of cells concentrated between 0.8 and 0.9. As the log phase 

progresses the percentages are reversed so that cells with values around 0.7 dominate. In the 

stationary phase, the percentages are inverted again, with values close to 1. In microaerophilic 

conditions, the lag phase is also characterized by a circularity range between 0.6 and 0.9. But unlike 

in aerobic growth, in this case no percentage for particular values seems remarkable stand out. 

During the log phase the percentage of cells farthest from the circular shape increases and in the 

stationary phase, the results tend to be similar to the ones obtained in the lag phase.
