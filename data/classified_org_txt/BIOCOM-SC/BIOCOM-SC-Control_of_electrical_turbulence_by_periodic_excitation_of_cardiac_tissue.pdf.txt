Electrical turbulence in cardiac tissue is associated with arrhythmias such as the life-threatening ventricular
fibrillation. The application of a high-energy electrical shock constitutes an effective defibrillation, but also
causes severe side effects. Recent experimental studies have shown that a sequence of low energy electrical
far-field pulses is able to terminate fibrillation more gently than a single pulse. During this low-energy
antifibrillation pacing (LEAP) only tissue near sufficiently large conduction heterogeneities, such as large
coronary arteries, is activated. In order to understand and potentially optimize LEAP, we performed extensive
simulations of cardiac tissue perforated by blood vessels. We checked three alternative cellular models that
exhibit qualitatively different electrical turbulence. LEAP may operate if and only if the spectrum of this
chaotic activity is characterized by a narrow peak around a dominant frequency. For each of 100 initial
conditions, we tested different electrical field strengths, pulse shapes, numbers of pulses, and periods between
the pulses. It turned out that the optimal period matches the dominant period of the chaotic activity while
both over- and underdrive pacing lead to a considerably smaller success probability and higher field strength
for reliable defibrillation. An optimal LEAP protocol, which minimizes the required total energy for successful
defibrillation, consists of five or six pulses. Compared to a single bi-phasic defibrillation pulse, it reduces the
total energy by about 86%, corresponding to an energy reduction of 97 – 98% per pulse.

In ventricular fibrillation, the heart is quiver-
ing instead of pumping, a condition which leads
to cardiac arrest and ultimately to death. This
loss of synchronous contraction stems from disor-
ganized electrical activity in the ventricles. Emer-
gency defibrillation is achieved by the application
of a strong electrical shock which is accompanied
by severe side effects such as tissue damage and
trauma. Recently, an alternative treatment using
a sequence of low energy pulses has been sug-
gested in which each electrical pulse excites only
localized tissue sites at the large heterogeneities
– such as blood vessels – instead of the entire
tissue. In laboratory experiments in vitro and in
vivo, this so-called low-energy antifibrillation pac-
ing (LEAP) with five pulses achieves defibrillation
with an energy reduction of 80 – 90 % per pulse in
comparison with standard single shock treatment.
Here, we perform an extensive numerical study
of LEAP employing far field pacing at the major
blood vessels. We have tested three alternative
electrophysiological models that exhibit qualita-
tively different spatiotemporally chaotic activity.
LEAP operates if and only if the spectrum of this
chaotic activity is characterized by a narrow peak
around a dominant frequency. In this case, a res-
onant pacing with the same frequency and a se-

quence of five to six pulses results in an optimal
total energy reduction for defibrillation of 86 %
and an even greater reduction per pulse. Pacing
with a frequency which is similar, but somewhat
different from the dominant frequency, as typi-
cally done in experiments, results in a consider-
ably smaller energy reduction. Our results may
provide a link between the spectrum of the elec-
trical activity and the optimal pacing frequency
in experimental defibrillation procedures.

I. INTRODUCTION

A loss of rhythm and synchronization of cardiac elec-
trical impulses orchestrating the pumping of blood is as-
sociated with a number of arrhythmias (i.e. abnormal
or irregular heart rhythms) including atrial fibrillation
(AF), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and ventricular tachy-
cardia (VT). The nonlinear dynamics of electrical excita-
tion waves in cardiac tissue has been studied extensively
in experiment and simulation for more than two decades,
for recent reviews see e. g.1–5. VF represents a particu-
larly dangerous malfunction of the heart, in which syn-
chronous excitation and contraction of different parts of
the ventricles is lost, potentially causing sudden death if
left untreated for more than a few minutes.

The electrical activity during VF is dominated by ei-
ther one or a few large rotors (mother rotors) surrounded
by irregular activity or entirely by multiple wavelets in a
spatiotemporally chaotic state. First direct experimental



2

observations of such states were reported almost 20 years
ago6,7. Recent experimental and simulations studies8,9

show a complex picture with states dominated by one or
a few mother rotors as well as multiple wave dynamics
characterized by a mean number of 10 vortices on the
surface of, e. g., a human heart. The fluctuations in
vortex number resemble a Poissonian statistics.

Defibrillation by a strong electrical pulse is the only
known effective therapy for VF. Such a strong shock
globally excites the tissue resulting in termination of
all excitation waves, but also causes severe side effects
as pain and trauma for the patient10, damage of the
myocardium11, and reduced battery life in implanted de-
vices. These adverse effects could be diminished if VF
could be terminated reliably by defibrillation shocks with
significantly lower energies. Recent studies12,13 of AF in
vitro and in vivo as well as VF in vitro have shown that
a sequence of five low-energy far-field pulses with stimu-
lation rates close to the arrhythmia cycle length can re-
quire 80− 90% less energy per pulse than a single shock.
This method is called low-energy antifibrillation pacing
(LEAP). With much faster pacing rates than the cycle
length, similar energy reductions were found for AF15,16,
while for VT the energy may further be reduced by an
order of magnitude14,17.

LEAP takes advantage of the fact that an electric field
depolarizes and hyperpolarizes the tissue near conductiv-
ity heterogeneities18 which become virtual electrodes19.
The strength of this effect depends on the size and
shape of the heterogeneities and the strength of the elec-
tric field20–22. Only tissue at major conduction hetero-
geneities may be activated by each of these very weak
pulses. Therefore, global tissue activation and wave ter-
mination originates from few localized activation sites
(hot spots). The mechanism how multiple low-energy
far-field pulses terminate arrhythmias are not well un-
derstood as experimental methods to visualize three di-
mensional electrical turbulence are missing. Luther et
al.13 suggest that the major conduction heterogeneities
necessary for LEAP are given by large coronary arteries
and show that the size distribution of the heterogeneities
follows a power law. However, Caldwell et al.23 did not
find such a co-localization of hot spots and major coro-
nary vessels.

Theoretical approaches to understand LEAP have of-
ten focussed on the process of unpinning and removal
of a small number of vortices20,24–26. In these papers,
it was demonstrated that vortices that were assumed to
be pinned at larger heterogeneities in cardiac tissue are
best terminated if the pacing frequency in a LEAP pro-
cedure is set to be 80 - 90% of the dominant frequency
(the rotation frequency of the vortex around the pinning
site). Such a choice of pacing frequency allows for an
efficient scanning of the phase of the vortex in order to
find the vulnerable window for vortex termination27,28.
A simulation study in a realistic three-dimensional car-
diac geometry demonstrated for selected examples that
LEAP works for a pacing period of 88% of the VF cy-

cle length, but often fails for much faster pacing with a
period of 16% of the VF cycle length29.

For LEAP, reduction of defibrillation energy is the
quantity which is studied in the quasi-two-dimensional
AF and the three dimensional VF13. Very similar results
are found in both cases and, moreover, the size distribu-
tion of the radii of arteries are found to be almost iden-
tical for atria and ventricles. Therefore, we expect that
LEAP can be qualitatively investigated within a simple
two dimensional model in which the non-conducting het-
erogeneities are represented by circles whose size distri-
bution is given by the distribution of radii of coronary
arteries measured in13. Furthermore, we employed three
alternative models which are established for ventricular
cells32–34. The simplicity of our composite model allows
us to perform systematic statistical studies with a set of
100 initial conditions. This is essential since both stan-
dard defibrillation and LEAP may depend critically on
these and are also associated with large uncertainties13.

In our computational study, we aim for a basic under-
standing of LEAP to potentially optimize its protocol.
Therefore, we have investigated many aspects of LEAP
which might be crucial for its success. It turns out that
for successful LEAP, both the electrical turbulence and
the LEAP protocol must posses certain properties. More-
over, we found a LEAP protocol which is even more effi-
cient in our simulations than the one employed in exper-
imental studies.

In the methods section 2, we introduce the cellular
models in a mono-domain framework, the distribution of
heterogeneities, the alternative defibrillation protocols,
the numerical methods used in the simulations, and our
choice of initial conditions. Section 3 contains the main
results regarding characterization of electrical turbulence
in the three models, single pulse defibrillation and LEAP
as well as the survival statistics of fibrillation activity in
the absence of defibrillation. Section 4 and 5 provide a
discussion of the result and a short conclusion, respec-
tively.

II. METHODS

We have performed extensive numerical simulations
with several cellular models and defibrillation protocols
with different electrical field strengths, wave forms, num-
ber of pulses, and inter-pulse intervals. Typically, 100
simulation runs with different initial conditions were per-
formed for each configuration. To obtain statistically
valid results, we restricted the simulations to a homo-
geneous, isotropic and two-dimensional tissue which is
perforated by blood vessels.

A. Mono-domain equation and cellular models

By homogenization, cardiac tissue is represented by
intra-cellular and extra-cellular space5,30. Assuming van-

ishing anisotropy, the propagation of electrical waves is
described by the mono-domain equation30:

∂tV (~x, t) = D∆V (~x, t)−
Iion (V (~x, t), ~w(~x, t))

C
, (1)

where V denotes the transmembrane potential, ∆ the
Laplacian, C the specific membrane capacitance, and Iion
the sum of transmembrane current densities which is a
function of both the transmembrane potential V and sev-
eral state variables ~w. The (diffusion) coefficient D is de-
termined by tissue conductivity, membrane capacitance,
and the area to volume ratio of the cellular model.

The dynamics of the state variables ~w in eq. (1) is spec-
ified by a particular cellular model. To our knowledge,
reliable information about the structure of electrical tur-
bulence during ventricular fibrillation is lacking, as cel-
lular models are built to reproduce the activity in single
cells and even recent models of human ventricular cells
exhibit a very diverse spatiotemporal behavior31. Thus,
we tested several cellular models which exhibit quali-
tatively different spatiotemporal chaos: The Luo-Rudy
(LR) model with standard parameter values32, the Ten
Tusscher (TT) model with parameter values to match
human epicardial tissue33, and the Fenton-Karma (FK)
model34. For the latter model, we have used the default
parameter values in35 which maximize the propensity for
spiral waves to break while minimizing core meandering.
In all three models we used the specific capacitance for
cells of a mammalian heart, given by C = 1.0 µF cm−2 36.

B. Blood vessels as heterogeneities

Blood vessels constitute large heterogeneities of
conductivity13 and were modeled as non-conducting
patches in otherwise homogenous tissue. The intracel-
lular current into these heterogeneities is zero and in the

presence of an external electric field ~E, this leads to the

boundary condition (∇V − ~E) · ~n = 020,22, where ~n is
normal to the boundary of the heterogeneity. In con-
sequence, an external electric field, increases the trans-
membrane potential in the vicinity of one side of the het-
erogeneity and may activate this tissue20,22. In general,
smaller heterogeneities require a larger field strength for
tissue activation20. For a circular heterogeneity in quies-
cent two-dimensional tissue, the minimal radius required
for activation is a well-known, monotonically decreas-
ing function of the magnitude of the applied field13,20.
In the absence of conduction heterogeneities and tissue
anisotropy, the transmembrane potential is not altered
by an external electrical field30.

Both in ventricles and in atria of adult beagle dogs,
the size distribution of coronary artery radii R is given
by a power law p(R) ∝ Rα13. This distribution holds
between Rmin ≈ 0.06 mm and Rmax ≈ 0.8 mm and the
exponent is given by α ≈ −2.75 both for ventricles and
atria13. We modeled coronary arteries in ventricles as
circular heterogeneities with radii drawn from this distri-
bution and positions drawn from an uniform distribution
while circle overlap is prohibited. For the (area) density
of all heterogeneities, 40/cm2 was chosen since this value
matches the measured density of activated arteries in the
limit of large E13. We have checked that different real-
ization of positions and radii resulted in almost identical



4

defibrillation successes. Therefore, the same realization
of positions and radii was used in simulations while the
initial states of electrical turbulence were varied unless
stated otherwise.

C. Defibrillation protocols

State-of-the-art defibrillators execute a biphasic, asym-
metric protocol37. We tested both monophasic and
biphasic defibrillation protocols specified as follows. For
monophasic pulses, a rectangular waveform with a dura-
tion of 10 ms and amplitude E was chosen. For biphasic
pulses, the waveform consisted of two subsequent rectan-
gular parts with identical amplitudes E and opposite field
direction. We fixed the total pulse duration to 10 ms and
optimized the ratio of forward to backward duration. For
fixed parameters, we found that 7 ms (forward) and 3 ms
(backward) leads to best defibrillation results, in agree-
ment with38,39, where the best efficiency is obtained when
the first phase is about twice as long as the second phase.
Our low-energy antifibrillation pacing (LEAP) protocol
contains n identical biphasic pulses, where the interval T
between two pulses is constant and defined between the
onsets of neighboring pulses.

D. Numerical methods

The mono-domain eq. (1) in conjunction with a cellu-
lar model (LR, TT, or FK) was solved on an rectangular,
2-dimensional, and equidistant finite-difference grid with
1000×1000 nodes and a grid spacing of 0.2 mm, corre-
sponding to an edge length of 20 cm. Both periodic and
no-flux boundary conditions were used, as discussed be-
low. The diffusion term of eq. (1) was discretized by
the standard five-point stencil40. Since a straightforward
explicit Euler time integration requires a rather small
time step of 0.001 ms for numerical stability, we used the
Rush-Larsen method41 to integrate the gating variables.
Furthermore, we considered the diffusion term implicitly,
since for the explicit solution, time steps would have been
limited by ∆x2/4D.42 The resulting linear equation sys-
tem has a symmetric positive definite coefficient matrix
and can be solved efficiently by the conjugate gradient
method40. These modifications allowed us to increase
the time step to 0.1 ms.

E. Generation of initial conditions

A single spiral wave was initiated using the standard
cross-field stimulation technique43 on a grid with no-flux
boundary conditions. We have run the system for 5 s
to allow spiral break and onset of electrical turbulence.
Subsequently, the transmembrane potential in 10 ran-
domly chosen squares with 10 mm edge length was set to
the excitation threshold, the boundary conditions were

changed (periodic or no-flux, depending on the simula-
tions performed later), and the systems evolved for one
more second to establish different initial conditions. In
total, we generated 100 initial states of electrical tur-
bulence (fibrillation) which we used for simulations with
(LR), (TT), and (FK) cellular models, both with periodic
and no-flux boundary conditions.

III. RESULTS

A. Electrical turbulence

After generating the initial conditions as discussed
above, all considered cellular models – (LR), (TT), and
(FK) – support electrical turbulence representing fibril-
lation, see fig. 1 and movies as supplementary mate-
rial. However, the spectra of the transmembrane poten-
tial are qualitatively different: The (LR) model exhibits
a pronounced peak indicating a dominant cycle length of
τ = 1/f ≈ 0.33 s while the main peaks in the spectra of
the (TT) and the (FK) model are more expanded, see
fig. 2. Moreover, the (LR) spectrum features two addi-
tional peaks at about half and double of the dominant
cycle length while the (TT) and (FK) spectra are rather
unstructured.

Previous simulation studies have indicated that spa-
tiotemporal chaos in generic one- and two-dimensional
reaction-diffusion systems44–46 and electrical turbulence
in cardiac tissue35 are often transient states. Therefore,
we have checked the lifetimes of electrical turbulence in
the absence of defibrillation and with initial conditions
generated as described in section II E. With no-flux
boundaries, both the (LR) and the (TT) model exhibit
rather short spatiotemporal chaos while the turbulence in
the (FK) model is quite persistent, see fig. 3. Naturally,
periodic boundaries increase turbulence lifetimes and we
find t1/2 ≈ 9.2 s for the half-life of the turbulence in the
(LR) model. The half-lifes of both the other models are
beyond our simulation horizon.

B. Single pulse defibrillation

Running N = 100 simulations (see supplementary ma-
terial) for each parameter configuration and starting from
different initial conditions as presented above, we deter-
mined the single pulse termination probability P S, which
is defined as the probability that a fibrillation state is
converted into a quiescent state by a single defibrillation
pulse, as a function of field strength E. We computed
P S as the fraction of successful termination events, see
fig. 4. This is a statistically sound estimate since its er-
ror is given by δP S =

√
P S(1− P S)/N ∼ 1/

√
N . We

have checked both mono-phasic and bi-phasic pulse pro-
tocols as well as both periodic and no-flux boundary con-
ditions. For a given cellular model and fixed pulse dura-
tion, bi-phasic pulses (3 ms forward, 7 ms backward) are

The displayed graphs are averages of spectra of the transmem-
brane potential V at all spatial grid points and from all simu-

by a narrow peak at 3 Hz and two local maxima at about
double and half of this frequency (dotted lines). A similar
characterization fails for both the (TT) and the (FK) model,
where the bulk of the power density is beyond such peaks.
Furthermore, the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of
the displayed Gaussian peaks are given by δf ≈ 0.25 Hz (cen-
tral peak), δf ≈ 0.45 Hz, and δf ≈ 2.3 Hz for the (LR), (TT),
and (FK) model, respectively.

see fig. 4. This is in line with earlier findings39. On
the other hand, the defibrillation success is almost un-
affected by the boundary conditions. We also estimated
both the minimum electric field strength Emono90 of a sin-
gle monophasic pulse and Ebi90 of a single biphasic pulse

We found Emono90 ≈ 12.6 V/cm and Ebi90 ≈ 5.0 V/cm for
the (LR) model, Emono90 ≈ 6.7 V/cm and ES90 ≈ 4.9 V/cm
for the (TT) model, and Emono90 ≈ 20.9 V/cm and Ebi90 ≈
18.4 V/cm for the (FK) model. Systematic experiments
with mono-phasic pulses applied to over 200 fibrillation
episodes of canine hearts in vivo are consistent with our
results for the (LR) and (TT) models: While defib-
rillation is hopeless for field strengths below 2.9 V/cm
and guaranteed for field strengths above 8.5 V/cm, the
regime in-between is characterized by an increasing suc-
cess probability47.

nE. The lines for n = 5 and n = 6 first exceed 90%

termination probability, so we identify the optimal LEAP pro-
tocol to consist of 5 or 6 pulses.

C. Low-energy antifibrillation pacing (LEAP)

LEAP has been defined by the reduction of the en-
ergy per pulse of several weak pulses in comparison to
a single pulse13. Here, we adapt a stricter definition for
successful LEAP by comparing the total energy of the
weak pulses to the single pulse. Since single biphasic
pulses are favorable for defibrillation compared to single
monophasic pulses, see section III B, we employed the
former for LEAP. However, we also noted that for the

small field strength employed for LEAP, there is virtu-
ally no difference between the efficiencies of mono- and
biphasic pulses. The overall energy delivered by a LEAP
protocol is proportional to the number n of pulses and
the square of the electric field strength E. Therefore,
we define the rescaled field strength Ẽ ≡

√
nE and con-

sider LEAP with n pulses to be functional if ẼL90 < E
bi
90,

where ẼL90 is the rescaled electric field strength of LEAP
to achieve a termination probability of 90% and Ebi90 is
the corresponding quantity for a single biphasic pulse.

It turns out that LEAP is successful to control elec-
trical turbulence in cardiac tissue described by the (LR)
model, see fig. 5 and movies as supplementary material.
However, cardiac tissue described by means of the (TT)
or the (FK) model does not show an improvement for
LEAP in the form of a significant total energy reduction
when compared to the single shock defibrillation: For
pulse intervals T between 0 ms and 500 ms, pulse num-
bers up to n = 10, and rescaled field strengths up to
the respective single pulse limits, LEAP is not success-
ful for these models. For the (LR) model, the pulse in-
terval T turns out to be crucial for LEAP success, see
fig. 5a. Maximal termination probability PL is found
for Tmax ≈ 330 ms which matches the dominant period
τ ≈ 330 ms of the fibrillation state of the (LR) model,
see fig. 2. Furthermore, pulse intervals with Tmax/2 and
2Tmax may also be chosen for LEAP albeit they result
in a smaller success probability.

Naturally, the termination probability increases with
the number of pulse, except for intervals T slightly be-
low Tmax, where n = 4 is optimal, see fig. 5b. In
this regime, the later pulses seem to reinitiate fibrilla-
tion after successful termination. Choosing the optimal
interval Tmax, the minimal field strengths for a LEAP
success probability of 90% are EL90 ≈ 0.85 V/cm and
EL90 ≈ 0.76 V/cm for five and six pulses, respectively,
see fig. 5c. In both cases, this corresponds to a rescaled
field strength of ẼL90 ≈ 1.9 V/cm, see 5d. For comparison,
the field strength required for a single defibrillation pulse
is Ebi90 ≈ 5.0 V/cm, i.e., the achieved total reduction of
dissipated energy is about 86%, while the reduction per
pulse is about 97% for five pulses and about 98% for six
pulses.

For the optimal pulse interval Tmax, the termination
probability PL decreases for electric field strengths above
2.8 V/cm, see fig. 6a. In this regime, the later pulses
reinitiate fibrillation after successful termination, simi-
lar to the situation depicted by the blue line in fig. 5b.
In fact, the optimal pacing period does not match Tmax
which is given by the dominant period of the electrical
turbulence in absence of pacing, but is shifted to about
365 ms for E = 3 V/cm, see fig. 6b. With this pacing pe-
riod, which corresponds to 10% underdrive pacing, EL90 is
increased significantly to about 2.2 V/cm for six pulses,
see fig. 6c, and the energy reduction is only 80% per
pulse, resulting in no reduction of the total energy.

Our results are summarized in table I. Electrical tur-
bulence, i.e. fibrillation, exhibits a frequency spectrum

with a distinct peak. For the (LR) model, this peak is rel-
atively narrow compared to the (TT) and (FK) models.

Furthermore, the (LR) spectrum exhibits peaks at about
half and double of the dominant frequency, while both the
(TT) and (FK) models have rather unstructured spectra.
Naturally, fibrillation exhibits less persistence for no-flux
boundary conditions. Furthermore, for given boundary
conditions and simulation domains, electrical turbulence
exhibits different persistencies in different models. How-
ever, for all models and periodic boundaries, the half-life
t1/2 of fibrillation is at least 9 s which is longer than the
duration of a defibrillation protocol. LEAP does only
operate in simulations with the (LR) model. Maximal
reduction of the total energy of a pulse train is found for
five or six pulses and a pulse interval of 330 ms.

IV. DISCUSSION

We have performed extensive simulations of electri-
cal turbulence, standard single pulse defibrillation, and
LEAP. For each set of parameters, simulations were re-
peated with 100 initial conditions for the electrically tur-
bulent state in order to determine the probability of wave
termination. Heterogeneities obeying a size distribution
typical for blood vessels in cardiac tissue where added
and acted as virtual electrodes, i. e. centers for localized
tissue activations during defibrillation. Extensive simula-
tions were performed for three different cellular models,
namely the Luo-Rudy (LR) model32, the Ten Tusscher
(TT) model33, and a variant of the Fenton-Karma (FK)
model34 which all show somewhat different phenomenolo-
gies of spatiotemporal chaos. We found that LEAP is
only successful for the (LR) model which exhibits a clear
dominant period during fibrillation not present in the
(TT) or the (FK) model.

The half-life of the fibrillation state depends on the
cellular model, the boundary conditions, and the domain
size. In order to test LEAP, we have chosen a sufficiently
large domain size of 20 cm x 20 cm for all models to
ensure enough persistence of turbulence. Alternatively,
arrhythmias may be sustained by decreasing the tissue
conductivities29 (In this study over-driving VF with 88%
of the dominant cycle length in an anatomically realis-
tic model may result in an energy reduction of 99.5%
in some simulations29). The relatively small half-lives of
fibrillation did not seem to have misguided us in terms of
LEAP success: Electrical turbulence in the (LR) model
with periodic boundary conditions exhibits a half-life of
about 9 seconds and can be successfully terminated by
LEAP. On the other hand, turbulence in the (TT) model
with no-flux boundary conditions exhibits only about 3
seconds while LEAP does not succeed in this case.

Parameters like the electric field strength, the number
of pulses and the pacing period, i. e., the time between
two pulses, were varied in order to determine the most
efficient protocol in terms of energy reduction. It turns
out that the pacing period for which LEAP works most
efficiently is roughly the dominant period of the electrical
turbulence. Protocols with multiples and divisors of this



8

optimal period have relatively high success rates too, in-
dicating that the defibrillation process can be understood
as a synchronization process. A LEAP protocol, employ-
ing resonant pacing with the mentioned dominant period
and five pulses, required about 97% less energy per pulse
and 86% less total energy than a single biphasic shock
for successful defibrillation.

This optimal pacing is somewhat different from
the over- and underdrive pacing applied in LEAP
experiments13. For a field strength of E = 0.75 V/cm,
employing a pulse interval of 90% or 110% of the domi-
nant cycle length reduces the success probability to about
50% in our simulations, see fig. 5a. For larger elec-
tric field strengths, however, the optimal pacing period is
slightly increased. With E = 3 V/cm, the optimal pac-
ing period is at about 110% of the dominant period of
electrical turbulence, see fig. 6b. This effect can be inter-
preted as an increased dominant period of the perturbed
system: Tissue which gets excited by strong electrical
fields has an increased refractory period. Underpacing
with a pulse interval of T = 365 ms results in an energy
reduction of about 80% per pulse, see fig. 6c, but no total
energy reduction. We might speculate that the experi-
mental finding13 of an energy reduction between 80 and
90% per pulse and successful underdrive pacing might
correspond to a similar variant of LEAP.

V. CONCLUSION

We have drawn statistically sound statements for a
simple model of cardiac tissue perforated by blood ves-
sels. We demonstrated that LEAP is only successful if
the cellular model exhibits a clear dominant period dur-
ing fibrillation. In this case, the pulses are most efficient
with respect to defibrillation if the period between these
pulses matches the dominant period of fibrillation. Us-
ing a defibrillation protocol with this period required 97 –
98% less energy per pulse, i.e. 86% less total energy than
a comparable single biphasic shock for successful defib-
rillation. We also investigated a less efficient version of
LEAP in which underdrive pacing is superior to resonant
pacing. The speculation that a similar mechanism was
at work in previous LEAP experiments is worth testing
in future experiments.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

Movies of the simulations are provided online as
supplementary material. In all movies, the simula-
tion domain has an edge length of 20 cm and periodic
boundary conditions. In movies 4 – 6, the (first) pulse
is applied at t = 500 ms. All biphasic pulses are applied
for 7 ms in forward and 3 ms in backward direction.

Movie 4: Defibrillation with a single biphasic pulse for
the (LR) model. The field strength is E = 5 V/cm.
Movie 5: Defibrillation with a single biphasic pulse for
