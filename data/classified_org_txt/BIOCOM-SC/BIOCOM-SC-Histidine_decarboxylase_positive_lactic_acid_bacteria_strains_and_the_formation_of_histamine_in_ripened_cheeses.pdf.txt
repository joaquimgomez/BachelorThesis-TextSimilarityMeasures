Abstract  

The relationship between histidine decarboxylase-positive (hdc+) lactic acid bacteria 

(LAB) counts and the amounts of biogenic amines, particularly histamine, in cheeses 

made with and without LAB starter were investigated. Sixty LAB strains were isolated 

from ripened cheeses made with raw milk inoculated with lactic starter and cheeses 

without starter. The strains were identified by carbohydrate fermentation test and the 

histidine decarboxylase gene was determined by PCR. Biogenic amine contents from 

the cheeses were determined by HPLC. LAB counts, and their diversity were higher in 

the cheeses without starter. The cheeses contained low concentrations of the studied 

amines. The lowest concentrations were found for ethylamine and putrescine followed 

by cadaverine, tyramine, phenyletilamine and histamine, especially in the cheeses with 

starter. There was a direct relationship between the percentage of hdc+ LAB strains and 

histamine; and between this percentage and the sum of tyramine, phenylethylamine and 

ethylamine concentrations. 

 

Keywords: lactic acid bacteria, histidine decarboxylase, biogenic amines, histamine, 

cheese 

 

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS  

It is a well-known fact that the content of biogenic amines in cheeses should be 

controlled because these compounds can cause toxicity and undesirable flavor. The 

results of the present study show that LAB starter cultures do not completely prevent 

the formation of biogenic amines in cheeses manufactured with raw milk. Although the 

LAB starter helps to reduce the total amount of biogenic amines, histamine 

concentration is not clearly linked to the use of starter. In order to ensure the safety of 

cheeses, it is necessary to use high quality milk, follow hygienic practices and take 

advantage of the selective pressure of the physico-chemical and technological 

parameters that occur during cheese making.

Introduction 

Biogenic amines are compounds of biological origin with low molecular weight that 

have in common the presence of at least one amino group. Biogenic amines are formed 

during the metabolism and play an important role in cellular physiology. They are 

present in living organisms and in different amounts in a variety of foods. Biogenic 

amines in foods are mainly produced from amino acid precursors by the action of 

decarboxylase enzymes of microorganisms. The expression and activity of enzymes 

depend not only on the presence of the decarboxylase gene, but also on the conditions in 

which the microorganism grows. The ability to form biogenic amines has been 

described for some microbial groups related to foods, especially fermented foods like 

cheeses. The main biogenic amine producers in cheese are Gram positive bacteria, such 

as LAB (e.g. Lactobacillus or Enterococcus), and most Gram negative bacteria 

described as usual contaminants of milk, such as Enterobacteriaceae (e.g. Escherichia, 

Salmonella or Enterobacter) and psychrotrophic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas).  

The content of biogenic amines such as histamine, tyramine, ethylamine or 

phenyletilamine in foods should be controlled since, in susceptible consumers, their 

presence can cause health problems such as headaches, nausea and vomiting, allergies, 

an increase of arterial blood pressure. Moreover, some biogenic amines like cadaverine 

and putrescine are responsible for the undesirable flavor in some foods (Brito et al. 

2014). The degree of toxicity depends on the amine type and concentration and may be 

increased by the presence of other amines; for example, cadaverine and putrescine 

facilitate intestinal absorption of histamine due to blockage of monoamine oxidase 

enzyme activity. There is neither consensus nor enough information as to what levels of 

amines in foods would be safe for consumption, with the exception of histamine (EFSA 

2011). Specific legislation for biogenic amines only covers histamine in fishery 

products, and although some countries have set a limit for histamine levels in alcoholic 

drinks such as wines, no other levels of toxic amines are defined in any legislation. All 

that is available is a few recommendations by some studies (Spano et al. 2010; 

Leuschner et al. 2013).  

The most common amines found in ripened cheeses are histamine, tyramine, putrescine 

and cadaverine and they are produced mainly by LAB (Brito et al. 2014), but 

phenylethylamine, ethylamine and tryptamine can be present, too (Fernández et al. 

2007; Schirone et al. 2012; Poveda et al. 2015). There are many studies concerning 

amine presence in cheeses, which depends on the origin and treatment of the milk and 



 4 

on the manufacturing process, in which the hygienic conditions and the length of the 

ripening period play a significant role (Fernández et al. 2007). During the ripening of 

cheeses, free amino acids are produced as a result of proteolysis. The presence of these 

amino acids and of decarboxylase-positive microorganisms and the favorable 

environmental conditions (technological process, pH, temperature, water availability, 

etc.) allow the formation of biogenic amines (Linares et al. 2012).  

In cheeses made with raw milk and without starter, fermentation depends on the 

spontaneous development of the indigenous microbiota. Therefore, the quality of the 

final product relies on the microbial load and the variety of microorganisms present in 

the milk. Frequently, these types of cheese have more intense flavors than cheeses made 

with pasteurized milk. Nevertheless, the sensory characteristics vary notably among 

batches and it is not easy to control them. Some authors explain that the use of 

commercial ferments in the making of traditional cheeses has caused some loss of 

typical sensory characteristics of cheeses because of the reduction of microbiological 

biodiversity (Sheehan et al. 2008). A way of solving this problem is to design a starter 

formed by autochthonous LAB, isolated and selected among the microbiota of cheeses 

made with raw milk, which would provide the flavor and aroma differentials 

responsible for the particular identity of each cheese. A possible biosafety criterion 

could be to select strains that do not produce histamine or other toxic amines (Mesthri et 

al. 2011) and with the capacity to inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms 

biogenic amines producers (Rabie et al. 2015; Özogul et al. 2016). 

Many LAB can be producers of biogenic amines, and therefore biochemical 

identification of amine presence is not sufficient to determine food safety. A reliable 

tool for this purpose could be the detection of amino-acid decarboxylase genes (e.g. 

presence of the histidine decarboxylase gen, hdc+). However, it is important to take 

advantage of the selective pressure of the physico-chemical and technological 

parameters that occur during cheese making to prevent decarboxylase activity of native 

strains.  

The objectives of this study are: a) to evaluate the relationship between hdc+ LAB 

counts in ripened cheeses, isolated using three different agar media, and the amount of 

histamine in cheeses, and b) to determine the relationship between LAB starter and 

biogenic amine amounts in cheeses.

Material and methods 

Samples  

Four cheeses made by different small producers recognized for the quality of their 

products were analyzed. The cheeses were prepared with raw goat milk and ripened for 

5-6 months and weighed 250 g. The main difference between them was that two were 

made using a commercial LAB starter composed of Lactococcus lactis lactis, 

Lactococcus lactis cremoris, Lactococcus lactis diacetylactis, and Streptococcus 

salivarius thermophilus. The samples were called S (with starter) and NS (without 

starter). 

 

LAB counts 

The surface of each piece of cheese was removed with a sterile knife. Ten grams was 

taken aseptically and homogenized mechanically with 90 mL of peptone water in a 

Stomacher Lab-blender 400 for 2 min. Then, decimal dilutions were made using quarter 

strength ringer’s saline solution and microbiological seeding was performed in duplicate 

on MRS agar, M17 agar and Mayeux agar. The culture media were purchased from 

Sharlab (Barcelona, Spain). The agar plates were incubated at 30 ºC for 2-5 days in an 

atmosphere of reduced oxygen at less than 10% using a candle jar. The countable plates 

(between 30 and 300 colonies) were used to quantify the LAB populations. 

 

Isolation and biochemical identification of LAB  

Five colonies were isolated from countable plates of the above media. They were 

randomly picked and purified by streaking on the same isolation medium. A total of 

sixty strains (fifteen per cheese) were studied. Bacterial growths were checked by Gram 

stain and catalase test. After microscopic observation, colonies were transferred onto 

three fresh plates of MRS, M17 and Mayeux agar, respectively. Identification was 

accomplished by API 50 CHL test (BioMerieux, France) according to the 

manufacturer’s instructions and gas production (CO2) from glucose was determined in 

MRS broth in a test tube sealed with paraffin cap.   

 

Identification of hdc+ LAB strains  

DNA purification  

Detection of hdc+ cheese bacteria was performed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 

assay using purified DNA. First, 10 mL of Elliker broth was inoculated with an isolated 



 6 

bacterial colony. Cells were grown for 3-4 days at 30 ºC until a sufficient population for 

DNA purification was achieved. Culture cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 

g for 15-30 min at 4 ºC and washed with 10 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Then, 

the pellet of bacteria was suspended in 1.5 mL of PBS and recovered in a microtube by 

centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The pellet was suspended in 100 L of buffer 

P1 (0.05 mol/L Tris-Base, pH 8.0, 4 g/L EDTA, and 100 mg/L RNAase, stored at 4 ºC) 

for 5 min at 4 ºC. Next, 150 L of lysis buffer P2 (8 g/L NaOH, and 10 g/L SDS) and 

60 L of 10 mg/mL Lysozyme (prepared in 10mM Tris, pH 8) were added and the mix 

was maintained for 1 h at 37 ºC. The reaction was then neutralized with 200 L of 

buffer P3 (294.5 g/L potassium acetate, pH 5.5) and the suspension was centrifuged at 

10000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was obtained to precipitate the DNA using ethanol 

absolute and DNA quality was determined by the ratio A260/A280. 

 

PCR analysis 

Purified DNA was used as template in the PCR experiments using 3 pairs of primers 

(Figure 1). These primers were chosen by studying amino acid and nucleotide 

sequences of the histidine decarboxylase genes of Lactobacillus 30a and Clostridium 

perfringens in the conserved regions (Le Jeune et al. 1995). PCR conditions were as 

follows: 40 cycles, DNA denaturation 1 min at 94 ºC, annealing 30 seconds at 48 ºC, 

and DNA polymerization 2 min at 72 ºC. PCR was finished with an extension of 5 min 

at 70 ºC. Amplification products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. PCR was 

controlled using the ribosomal gene 16S and primer assays were 8F (5’-

AgAgTTTgATCCTggCTCAg-3’) and 1510R (5’-ggTTACCTTgTTACgACTT-3’). 

Positive control was performed using DNA purified from Lactobacillus buchneri as 

hdc+ (INCAVI, Spain). To determine false products during PCR reaction, PCR 

products were sequenced and nested PCR was carried out. 

 

Formation of histamine in MRS broth medium 

Amine production in a synthetic medium was determined by studying hdc+ bacteria. A 

loop full from pure culture was inoculated into 8 mL tubes of MRS broth with 50 mg/L 

of histidine and pH adjusted to 6. The tubes were incubated at 30 ºC for 48-72h. 

Histamine formation was determined using a Veratox histamine kit (Neogen 

Corporation, USA). A microwell reader (Synergy HTX MultiMode Reader, Biotek 



 7 

Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) was used to yield optical densities at 650 nm. 

Control optical densities were used to form a standard curve, and optical densities of 

samples were plotted against the curve to calculate the concentration of histamine. 

 

Determination of biogenic amines in cheeses by HPLC 

Ten grams of each cheese sample was blended with 20 mL of 0.1 M HCl. After cooling 

to 3 ºC to allow crystallization of most of the fat, the sample was centrifuged at 4500 

rpm at 3-5 ºC for 30 min. The creamed layer was removed and the supernatant filtered 

through qualitative filter paper. Five mL of the filtrate was poured into 1 mL of NaOH 

0.5 M. Then, Na2CO3 was added in excess (about 1 g) and homogenized in a shaker, 

and 6 mL of n-butyl alcohol was added and shaken again. The aqueous phase was again 

extracted twice with 6 mL of n-butyl alcohol for each time. The organic extracts were 

then combined and 5 mL of 0.1 M HCl was added and homogenized by stirring. Finally, 

the phases of this mix were allowed to separate, and the acid phase was filtered with a 

0.45 µm filter and stored in tubes at -20° C until being analyzed by HPLC. The amines 

were separated by reverse phase HPLC and the method involved pre-column 

derivatization of the amines by treatment with o-phtaldehyde (OPA). The volume 

injected was 14 µl (7 µl of OPA mixed with 7 µl of sample). The OPA was prepared 

from 50 mg of OPA and 1 mL of methanol in 10 mL of borate buffer (0.4 M, pH 10), 

with the final addition of 40 µL of mercaptoethanol. HPLC was equipped with two 

pumps Beckman 110B System Gold (San Ramon, CA, USA), an injector Hewlett 

Packard series 1100 and fluorescence detector Hewlett Packard 1046A (Agilent 

Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany).  

HPLC separations were performed at 45 ºC using a 25 cm x 0.46 cm Spherisorb ODS 2 

C18 column with particles of 0.5 µm of diameter and gradient mobile phase 

composition with a flow rate of 0.85 mL per minute. As a mobile phase for 

chromatographic separation, methanol:acetate buffer solution (0.05 M, pH 6.6) was 

used. Biogenic amine detection was performed using a fluorescence detector with an 

excitation wavelength of 230 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. 

Amines were identified by comparison of retention times of amines in samples to 

standard solutions and also by addition of the suspected amine to samples. Amine levels 

were calculated by direct interpolation in the standard curve for histamine, 

phenylethylamine, ethylamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine.

Statistical analysis 

PCR results were tabulated as presence or absence of the histidine decarboxylase gene. 

Statistical analysis of data was conducted by graphical and numerical summaries. 

Variance tests (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the influence of the two main factors, 

starter and medium (use or no use of starter and the three different agar media used), on 

the LAB counts and their interactions. Separation of means was evaluated by variance 

tests according to the Tukey-Kramer procedure. Data were analyzed using Minitab® 

Statistical Software (Minitab Inc 2012). The probability significance level was set at 

0.05.  

 

 

Results and discussion 

Counts and isolation media  

The LAB counts for the four cheeses on the three different agar media are shown in 

Figure 2. As can be observed, they ranged between 8.52 and 6.40 Log CFU/g. The 

averages (and standard deviation of the mean) of the cheeses without starter (NS1 and 

NS2) and the cheeses with starter (S1 and S2) was 7.81 (0.50) Log CFU/g and 7.57 

(0.46) Log CFU/g, respectively. LAB counts for the cheeses without starter on MRS 

agar were slightly higher than those for the cheeses with starter. According to the 

medium used, the highest counts were obtained mostly on MRS agar, with an average 

(and standard deviation of the mean) equal to 8.28 (0.09) Log CFU/g, followed by LAB 

counts on M17 agar, with 8.04 (0.22) Log CFU/g. The lowest counts were obtained on 

Mayeux agar, with 6.75 (0.34) Log CFU/g. ANOVA applied to LAB count showed that 

the interaction of the two factors (starter and agar medium) was not significant (p-value 

= 0.968), and neither was use or no use of starter. On the other hand, differences were 

significant depending on the type of agar medium (p-value = 0.017). Comparison of the 

three means by the Tukey method revealed that the count on Mayeux agar was 

significantly different from the counts on MRS and M17 agar. However, the difference 

between these two last media was not large. The difference in growth depending on the 

medium is a qualitative attribute since lactic cocci were favored in Mayeux and M17 

agar and lactobacilli were favored in MRS agar although they are not selective media. 

The different LAB counts on different culture media are in accordance with results of 

other studies (Aponte et al. 2008; Van Hoorde et al. 2008), and the use of the three 

culture media seems a good strategy to achieve more diversity of grown strains.

LAB identification 

Biochemical API 50CHL test allowed the identification of 48 of 60 isolated lactic 

strains, with 29 of them being named at species level (Table 1). The test kit was specific 

for lactobacilli but was used for identification of all isolated LAB as in other studies 

carried out (Trias et al. 2008; Hong et al. 2015). In order to allow growth and partial or 

total identification of cocci, incubation time was extended up to 5 days. The 

carbohydrate fermentation profiles of some cocci strains did not allow differentiation 

between Streptococcus and Lactococcus. In fact, for data processing purposes, all cocci 

were included in the Lactococcus group because the galleries were incubated at 30 ºC. 

All LAB strains isolated from MRS agar corresponded to Lactobacillus; strains isolated 

from M17 agar were identified as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Leuconostoc; and 

strains isolated from Mayeux agar were Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. In fact, the test 

media displayed poor selectivity, favoring the growth of specific LAB genera but also 

of other genera.  

The most important finding in bacteria identification was that the diversity of LAB in 

the cheeses manufactured without starter was higher than in those with starter (see NS 

and S samples, respectively; Table 1). In the cheeses made without starter, 25 of the 30 

strains were identified at genus level; the highest proportion belonged to Lactobacillus 

(60%), followed by Lactococcus (32%) and Leuconostoc (8%). Also, four Lactobacillus 

species (plantarum, brevis, casei and buchneri) and one Lactococcus species (lactis) 

were identified. As for the cheeses made with starter, 23 of the 30 strains were 

identified at genus level, all of which belonged to Lactobacillus. In these cheeses, four 

Lactobacillus species (plantarum, brevis, casei and curvatus) were identified too. Three 

of the four species of Lactobacillus identified in the cheeses with and without starter 

were the same. Generally, species variety is greater at the beginning of ripening and 

decreases as the process advances. The greater presence of lactobacilli in ripened 

cheeses made with raw milk is shown in several works (Gala et al. 2008; Van Hoorde et 

al. 2008; Aydemir et al. 2015; Gobbetti et al. 2015). Total or partial loss of starter 

during ripening has been reported in some studies (Novella-Rodríguez et al. 2002; 

Pogačić et al. 2013; Terzić-Vidojević et al. 2015). Also, it is known that, in ripened 

cheeses, the prevailing bacteria are not LAB starters but mainly mesophilic lactobacilli 

(Gobbetti et al. 2015). This is why the Lactococcus and Streptococcus starters were not 



 10 

isolated in this study. If they had been isolated, they would have been incubated at 42 or 

45 ºC (Aponte et al. 2008). 

The starter enabled rapid decline in pH, and probably the LAB diversity succession was 

lower. The cheeses without starter showed more bacteria diversity probably because the 

succession of microorganisms was slower and the wild strains had more ability to adapt 

to changes, as also reported in Gobbetti et al. (2015).  

Potential LAB histamine producers  

PCR test for Lactobacillus buchneri as positive control of hdc+ LAB was standardized 

(Fig. 1). Using this test to detect the hdcA gene, the hdc+ LAB strains isolated from the 

cheeses were identified and quantified. 46.7% of total isolated LAB had the hdcA gene, 

and therefore they were potential histamine producers although the production of 

histamine requires the presence of hdc+ strains, as well as favorable conditions for the 

expression of the histidine decarboxylase gene. The highest percent of hdc+ strains 

corresponded to Lactococcus (62.5%), followed by Lactobacillus (55.3%) and 

Leuconostoc, with only one of the two species identified.  

Considering the strains grown in each agar medium, the bacteria isolated on Mayeux 

agar had a high percentage of hdc+ strains (70%), while the LAB isolated on MRS and 

M17 with high bacterial counts had a low proportion of hdc+ strains (40% and 30%, 

respectively). The results confirm that the ability to produce histamine was strain-

dependent and not only related to specific species. It was also found that isolation of the 

maximum number of LAB strains absolutely requires the use of different media.  

The results also showed that the cheeses with starter had a lower proportion of hdc+ 

strains (43.3%) than the cheeses without starter (50%). This suggests that the LAB 

starter could act as an inhibitor of some, but insufficient, autochthonous hdc+ strains.  

All isolated hdc+ LAB produced more than 50 mg/kg of histamine in MRS broth with 

50 mg/L of histidine. Therefore, the quality and safety of the cheeses studied could be 

affected by the growth of isolated strains. Thus, in cheeses manufactured with raw milk, 

it seems necessary to control the factors that inhibit the ability of LAB to decarboxylate 

amino acids precursors of biogenic amines; being important factors the pH, the NaCl 

concentration, the time and the temperature of ripening between others (Komprda et al. 

2007; Komprda et al. 2012; Linares et al. 2012). The controlling factors are even more 

crucial given that some LAB used as a dairy starter could have the ability to form 

amines (Guarcello et al. 2015). 

 



 11 

Biogenic amines in cheeses 

The cheeses tested contained most of the studied biogenic amines (i.e. histamine, 

tyramine, ethylamine, phenylethylamine, putrescine and cadaverine), as Figure 3 shows. 

The lowest concentrations were found for ethylamine in the four cheeses (< 8 mg/Kg), 

followed by putrescine (≤ 15 mg/Kg). The amounts of cadaverine, tyramine and 

phenylethylamine were smaller in cheeses with starter (≤ 4 mg/Kg) than in cheeses 

without LAB starter (between 17 and 50 mg/Kg). These results could be explained by 

the higher LAB counts obtained in cheeses without LAB-starter. Also Combarros-

Fuertes et al. (2016) reported that in Zamorano cheeses, biogenic amines contents could 

be related to higher non-starter LAB counts. The histamine concentration (between 3 

and 30 mg/Kg) did not allow differentiation between the cheeses with and without 

starter. The highest histamine concentration (30 mg/Kg) was found in one of the 

cheeses with starter. However, the second highest was found in one of the cheeses 

without starter (21 mg/Kg). Despite the results obtained for histamine, it seems that the 

use of LAB starter could reduce the presence of some indigenous strains with potential 

ability to produce toxic amines, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, or amines 

responsible for undesirable flavors, such as putrescine and cadaverine. The values found 

for the four cheeses were similar to or below those reported in other works (Pintado et 

al. 2008; Poveda et al. 2015), and the histamine concentrations obtained were 

considered safe by EFSA (2011). 

Figure 4 shows that the cheeses without starter had the highest total amounts of 

biogenic amines, more than double the total quantity of amines found in the cheeses 

with starter. The results showed that there was no relationship between histamine and 

total biogenic amine concentrations, while similar percentages of hdc+ LAB strains 

were detected (p-value = 0.392). Therefore, in addition to hdc+ LAB strains, there could 

be a greater presence of other undesirable biogenic amine producers that can grow 

better without the competition of a LAB starter. During the ripening period, there is 

greater availability of amino acid precursors of biogenic amines, and the action of 

microbiota decarboxylases tends to take place in this stage (Pinho et al. 2004; 

Fernández et al. 2007; Poveda et al. 2015).  

Figure 5 shows a direct relationship between the number (%) of hdc+ LAB strains and 

histamine concentration in both groups of cheeses, with and without starter (S1-S2 and 

NS1-NS2), although a larger sample size would be required to confirm our findings. 



 12 

An inverse (or indirect) linear relationship between histamine concentration and sum of 

amines putrescine and cadaverine is observed, with a Pearson coefficient equal to -

0.849. On the other hand, there is a direct linear relationship between the percentage of 

hdc+ LAB strains and the sum of the amounts of tyramine, phenylethylamine and 

ethylamine, with a Pearson coefficient equal to 0.791. But no relationship between the 

number (%) of hdc + LAB strains and the sum of putrescine and cadaverine 

concentration can be established. Neither relationship between the histamine and the 

sum of tyramine, phenyletylamine and ethylamine concentrations, nor between these 

three toxic amines and the sum of putrescine and cadaverine concentrations can be 

established. In addition to hdc+ LAB strains, other microorganisms as some species of 

Enterobacteriaceae (E.coli, Pantoea conspicua, Providencia rettgeri) or Enterococci 

(Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium) might be involved in the production of 

histamine or tyramine, phenylethylamine and ethylamine (Torracca et al., 2018). The 

results also suggest that hdc+ LAB strains could have the ability to decarboxylate other 

amino acids, in addition to histidine. However, strains producing cadaverine and 

putrescine could be different from strains producing histamine.  

As found in other works (Fernández et al. 2007; Schirone et al. 2012), the total amount 

of amines in the four cheeses was considered low (< 120 mg/Kg), which is a clear 

indicator of good hygienic practices during manufacturing and ripening. Total amine 

concentrations are not a risk in any of the cheeses analyzed and, although hdc+ LAB 

strains were isolated, these bacteria did not form large quantities of histamine or other 

amines in the cheese matrix. It has been stated that the acidic medium stimulates 

bacteria to form amines from amino acids to protect themselves against this medium 

(Pircher et al. 2007; Linares et al. 2012). In the present study, it was found that, in MRS 

broth enriched with histidine, hdc+ LAB strains synthesized the maximum histamine 

concentration according to initial histidine concentration. Not always happen that 

bacteria with decarboxylase capacity synthesize biogenic amines, even in synthetic 

medium. Ladero et al (2015) showed that some isolated strains possessed the histidine 

decarboxylase gene, but no histamine was found in the culture supernatant after 24 - 48 

h of culture. This means that, during cheese ripening, the pH but mostly a mixture of 

physico-chemical factors with an inhibitory effect on the amines production acted 

jointly (Linares et al. 2012).   

 

 



 13 

Conclusion 

The elaboration of cheeses from raw milk implies a high probability that there are hdc+ 

LAB strains with ability to form histamine and other biogenic amines (tyramine, 

ethylamine, phenylethylamine, putrescine and cadaverine). The use of LAB starter does 

not guarantee the absence of biogenic amines since other hdc+ bacteria may be present.
