Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is an important health problem in Latin America. Due to the mobility of Latin
American population around the world, countries without vector presence started to report disease cases. We developed a
deterministic compartmental model in order to gain insights into the disease dynamics in a scenario without vector presence,
considering congenital transmission and transmission by blood transfusion. The model was used to evaluate the epidemiological
effect of control measures. It was applied to demographic data from Spain and sensitivity analysis was performed on model
parameters associated with control strategies.

1. Introduction

Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is caused by the
protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it is an important
health problem in Latin America. The most effective trans-
mission route is through contact with triatomines bug (the
disease vector) feces. Other transmission routes can occur
by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and congenital
transmission [1]. Some cases of oral transmission have been
reported in Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina,
and Bolivia [2].

The disease presents an initial acute phase, generally
asymptomatic, and a subsequent chronic phase, which can
present clinical manifestations (cardiac, digestive, and/or
neurological) [1]. Since the 1960s the only drugs used in
Chagas disease treatment are benznidazole and nifurtimox,
which have a great efficiency if the treatment starts early and
can control disease progression in chronic cases [1, 3].

Although some Latin American countries, as Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Peru, have
received from the Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO) the International Certification of Disease Elimina-
tion by the main vector Triatoma infestans, the disease is still
a challenge [4]. According to theWorld Health Organization,
around 8 million people are infected worldwide and 10,000
people die every year due to disease clinical manifestation
[1]. Moreover, it estimates that 25 million people are at risk
of acquiring the disease. Around 30-40% of infected people
develop cardiomyopathy, digestive megasyndromes, or both
[5].

Since 2000, cases of the disease started to be reported in
nonendemic countries such as European countries, Canada,
USA, Japan, and Australia, due to the large flow of Latin
American immigrants [6]. In 2010, the World Health Assem-
bly approved a resolution, WHA 63.20 [7], recognizing the
increase in the number of cases and established a way to track

all of the transmission routes.The global cost of the disease is
similar to rotavirus or cervical cancer [8].

By 2009, 4,290 cases had been diagnosed in Europe,
compared with an estimated incidence ranging from 68,000
to 122,000 cases, hence 95% of cases are nondiagnosed,
reflecting the difficulty in tracking infected people [9, 10].
Due to uncertainty about the real number of cases in each
country, estimates are based on PAHO [11] and Schmunis et
al. 2014 [12].

Spain is the European country with most Latin American
immigrants, ranking the second on the world list, after
the United States of America [13]. In 2008, there were
approximately 4 million immigrants in Spain. 1.5 million of
themwere born in a country endemic for Chagas disease and,
therefore, they are potential carriers of the disease [14]. The
first case of the disease by blood transfusion in Spain was
detected in 1984, with two more cases in 1995 and 2004 [15].
Cases of congenital transmission were also reported [16, 17].

Due to its silent evolution after infection and the resulting
underdiagnoses, there is no complete and reliable data about
the disease. Therefore, mathematical models can be a partic-
ularly useful tool on the study of disease spread and control.

Several mathematical modeling studies have been done
in order to assess different aspects of Chagas disease and
control strategies. For instance, Velasco-Hernandez et al. [18]
considered a compartmental model with humans, vectors,
and transmission by blood transfusion. Inaba and Sekine
[19] also considered humans, vectors, and blood transfusion
but with infection age dependent infectivity. Congenital
transmission was considered by Massad [4], Raimundo et al.
[20], and Coffield et al. [21]. Fabrizio et al. [22] explored an
interhuman model, considering congenital transmission and
blood transfusion transmission.

In this work, we present a novel deterministic compart-
mental model considering congenital and blood transfusion
as the main mode of transmission using demographic data
from Spain. The aim is to gain insight into the dynamics of
the disease in a scenario without the vector and to evaluate
the epidemiological impact through the implementation of
control strategies like an improvement on surveillance in
blood transfusion and treatment of infected newborns. We
also introduced a cure rate for infected individuals to verify
how it affects disease dynamics.This cure ratemeans decrease
in the number of parasites inside host, and consequently
decreasing the risk of developing clinical manifestation.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Model Description. We introduce a deterministic com-
partmentalmodel forChagas transmissionwithout the vector
presence. The model distinguishes Latin American people
from countries with active vector transmission and natives
and immigrants from countries without vector transmission.
It also splits men and women in different compartments in
order to take vertical transmission into account. Therefore,
the population is classified into eight compartments:

(1) 𝑀Vℎ: healthy men from country with active vector
transmission;

(2)𝑀V𝑖: infected men from country with active vector
transmission;

(3)𝑀
ℎ
: healthy men from country without vector trans-

mission;
(4) 𝑀

𝑖
: infected men from country without vector trans-

mission;
(5) WVℎ: healthy women from country with active vector

transmission;
(6) 𝑊V𝑖: infected women from country with active vector

transmission;
(7) 𝑊

ℎ
: healthy women from country without vector

transmission;
(8) 𝑊

𝑖
: infected women from country without vector

transmission.

In the model simulations we analyze the number of
individuals over time in each of the compartments. The pro-
cesses considered for driving their dynamics are the simplest
as possible, keeping in mind the essence of the system’s
structure, the objectives of the model and the questions to
be answered. The reasons for looking for such simplicity are
various. From a theoretical perspective, a strictly gradual
increase in complexity is essential in any model development
in order to elucidate the different drivers of the overall
dynamics. From a social perspective, this simplicity facilitates
the necessary interaction with nonmodelers like community
health workers, social scientists, and patients’ associations in
order to seek real and feasible applications.

The processes considered by the current model are birth,
mortality, and flows among compartments. Infections flows
are associated with two possible causes: blood transfusion
and congenital transmission. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the
model.The assumptions for the dynamics of transmission are
the following:

(i) It is assumed that vertical transmission is propor-
tional to the number of infected women. People who
are born in Spain will be considered in the without
vector compartment, that is, 𝑊

𝑖
or 𝑀
𝑖
, even though

their family origin is Latin American.
(ii) We considered that the birth rate 𝛼 is the same for

women from countries with and without the vector
presence. We also assumed that 50% of the descen-
dants are women and 50% are men, for simplicity.

(iii) If a woman is infected, she has a probability 𝛽 to infect
her son or daughter.

(iv) The parameter 𝛾 stands for mortality rate for healthy
people. For infected individuals we assumed a mor-
tality rate induced by the disease 𝛿, where 𝛿 > 𝛾.

(v) Flow among health and infected classes due to blood
transfusion is considered as the result of interaction
between susceptible and infected people. We con-
sidered that there is no difference in the blood and
organ donation rate for populations from countries
without the vector and for countries with the vector.
The parameter 𝜏 stands for the yearly blood donation
rate.

infected female (1), healthy female (2), healthy male (3), or infected male (4). The same occur for newborns from𝑊
𝑖
that can be infected

female (5), healthy female (6), infected male (7), or healthy male (8). Healthy women𝑊Vℎ and𝑊ℎ only gave birth to healthy newborns (flows
not shown).

(vi) We also considered that a proportion 𝑝
𝑖
of donated

blood is potentially contaminated with T. cruzi. Once
donation has been made, health services carry out
controls screening. We considered 𝜉 as the probability
of an effective surveillance in screening donated
blood samples, thus 1 − 𝜉 is the probability that an
infected sample will not be detected, reach a receptor,
and infect him or her. In this way, the rate at which
a healthy person becomes infected with a parasite
from an infected person will be proportional to the
product 𝜏

𝑏
= 𝜏𝑝

𝑖
(1 − 𝜉). We also considered that

all transfusions are made with the same rate for all
individuals.

(vii) We supposed that infected individuals can be cured
with a rate 𝐶 due to treatment. This cure rate
means a reduction in the number of parasites inside
host, reducing the chances of clinical manifestation.
We consider that a yearly percentage 𝑑 of infected
individuals will be diagnosed and receive treatment.
Considering 𝑒 as the treatment effectiveness, we can
write 𝐶 = 𝑒 ⋅ 𝑑. The detected patients that do
not receive any treatment due to different reasons
(e.g., reported difficulties in accessing it [29]) are not
distinguished from nondiagnosed individuals by the
model.

(viii) Nomigration flows (neither immigration nor emigra-
tion) were considered by themodel, since they are not
relevant for its current purpose.

Formulating and evaluating the model behavior will help

us to find out what information is known and what is
unknown, to analyze the relative importance of each one of
the parameters, and to understand the system’s dynamics,
observing the long-term dynamics based on the control
actions that are carried out.

3. Results

3.1. Parameter Estimation. In order to evaluate the trends and
the important factors on the dynamic system, it is necessary
to attribute parameters values used by the model. Thus, the
modelwas fed with available data from Spain.The diversity of
model parameters to be fixed required the use of different data
sources. After exploring data availability, we chose 2007 as
the starting point of the simulation because it guaranteed the
access to all necessary information. The sources and obtained
values are described below.

3.1.1. Birth Rate and Vertical Transmission. By 2007 birth
rate in Spain was 10.9 per 1,000 inhabitants [23]. In a study
performed in two maternity clinics in Barcelona, Muñoz et
al. [24] reported a prevalence of 3.4% among pregnant Latin
American and 7.3% of newborns were infected. Then, we set
the birth rate as 𝛼 = 0.0109 year−1 and the probability of
vertical transmission as 𝛽 = 0.073.

3.1.2. Mortality Rates. By 2007 mortality rate in Spain was
8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants [25]. Cunubá et al. [26] published
a systematic review about mortality attributed to Chagas
disease.The authors found that the annuallymortality rate for
Chagas patients was twice higher than non-Chagas patients
in a moderate clinical group (0.16 (Chagas) vs. 0.08 (non-
Chagas) with RR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.52-2.91).Therefore, we set
𝛾 = 0.0085 per year and 𝛿 = 2𝛾 = 0.017.

3.1.3. Transmission by Blood Transfusion. We defined the rate
of transmission by blood transfusion as 𝜏

𝑏
= 𝜏𝑝

𝑖
, where

𝜏 is the donation rate per year and 𝑝
𝑖
is the proportion

of potentially infected blood samples. The proportion of
potentially infected blood samples was reported as 0.67 per
1,000 [27]. The rate of blood donation in Spain in 2007 was
33.4 per 1,000 inhabitants [28]. Then, the rate of infection by
blood transfusion 𝜏

𝑏
was calculated as 0.00022378 per year.

3.1.4. Control Strategies. Actions to control the increase
in new cases of Chagas disease are incorporated into the
model ((1)-(8)) by assuming some control parameters. We
considered two kinds of control strategies:

(i) Increasing the proportion of infected newborn
treated, by means of increasing the parameter 𝜌 on
the model simulation.

(ii) Increasing surveillance in blood transfusion, by
means of increasing the parameter 𝜉 in the model
simulation.

Moreover, we also assumed a cure rate by diagnosing and
treating infected individuals. In the model simulation, it was
done by increasing the parameter 𝑑.

A summary of parameters used in the simulations is listed
in Table 1.

3.2. Numerical Simulations. Population in Spain in 2007 was
45,226,803 [30] of which 1,638,694 were immigrants from
countries with the vector presence and potential Chagas dis-
ease carriers. The estimated number of infected individuals
was 53,134. Besides, taking into account the demographic
characteristics of the population, the estimated number of
infected women in the childbearing age in Spain was 24,000
[24, 27].

Based on that, the initial conditions were set as𝑀
ℎ
(0) =

21, 791, 055,𝑀
𝑖
(0) = 0,𝑀Vℎ(0) = 792, 780,𝑀V𝑖(0) = 29, 134,

𝑊
ℎ
(0) = 21, 792, 055,𝑊

𝑖
(0) = 0,𝑊Vℎ(0) = 792, 780,𝑊V𝑖(0) =

24, 000.
By use of model (1)-(8), we simulated the cumulative

number of infected people over time. Numerical simulations
were performed using the software R 3.5.0, integrating the
system ((1)-(8)) by Runge–Kutta fourth-order method, using
the parameters shown in Table 1 and the initial conditions
set above. Time step used was one year and time range for
simulation was 40 years.

3.3. Total Infected Population. The dynamics of the total
number of infected individuals (𝐼 = 𝑀

𝑖
+ 𝑊
𝑖
+ 𝑀V𝑖 +

𝑊V𝑖) was simulated for 40 years in order to observe the
epidemiological behavior given by the model. We observe a
decreasing behavior on the total number of infected people
along time as shown in Figure 2. This result is due to the
higher death rate attributed to infected people and to the fact
that migration flows are not considered, thus resulting in a
decreasing rate of change in the total number of the infected.
At the end of 40 years simulation, there was a 48% reduction
in the number of the total infected when compared with the
initial value.

3.4. Comparing the Effect of Transmission Routes. Beyond
the number of infected people immigrating to the country
without vector presence, another quantity of interest is the
number of new cases of the disease, i. e., the cumulative
number of new infected arising due blood transfusion and
congenital transmission, represented by the sum of individu-
als in the compartments𝑊

𝑖
and𝑀

𝑖
.

We can compare the difference in the disease dynamics
when only one route of infection is considered, as displayed
in Figure 3.The results show that congenital transmission has
a higher impact than the transmission by blood transfusion,
causing 38% more new infections.

3.5. Control Strategies. Two control strategies were consid-
ered, as above mentioned, treatment of infected newborns

were simulated, isolated, and combined.

3.5.1. Considering Only Treatment of Infected Newborns. In
this simulation, we evaluated the effect of performing a
control strategy only on newborns. The parameter associ-
ated with this control strategy is 𝜌, which represents the
proportion of successfully treated infected newborns. This
parameter was varied by 20%. The other parameters of the
model remained constant as in Table 1, while the parameter
𝜉 representing the control in blood transmission was set to
zero. Figure 4 displays the result of this sensitivity analysis in
the cumulative number of newly infected individuals.

When comparing these tendencies with the scenario
without control (Figure 2), the obtained percentage reduc-
tions on the cumulative number of new infected after 40 years
are shown in Table 2. Treating 100% of infected newborn
means that the cumulative number of newly infected individ-
uals will arise only due to transmission by blood transfusion.

3.5.3. Combined Control. Sensitivity analysis can also be
performed by varying the two parameters associated to
control strategies at the same time. Figure 6 shows the results
of combined control, by varying 𝜌 and 𝜉 simultaneously.
Resulting percentage reductions on the cumulative number
of newly infected when compared with a without control
scenario at the end of 40 years simulation are shown in
Table 4.

We also explored the effect of a certain cure rate on the
dynamics of infected individuals. The effectiveness due to
treatment with nifurtimox and/or benznidazole in patients in
the chronic indeterminate phase of Chagas disease is about 7-
8% [3].

According to [10], the index of underdiagnosis in Spain is
in the range 92.0-95.6%. It justifies the low values considered
for the percent of detected individuals in model simulation,

associated with control strategies were 𝑑 = 25% (detection of

included in the parameter 𝑑. Based on that, we set the
treatment effectiveness as 𝑒 = 7.5% and varied the detection
and treatment of infected individuals 𝑑. The cure rate is
assessed as 𝐶 = 7.5% ⋅ 𝑑.

The detection and treatment of infected patients are
difficult, mainly due to the asymptomatic characteristics of
the disease [10] but also because of other barriers such as
health care access limitations or the ownmisperception of the

disease [29]. Therefore, we varied the parameter 𝑑 between 0
and 25%.

Percentage reductions in the total number of infected
individuals from the initial year simulation to 40 years are
shown in Table 5.

The cumulative number of new infected is strongly
affected by the introduction of the cure rate. Figure 7 displays
the sensitivity analysis by varying the parameters 𝜌, 𝜉, and
𝑑. The corresponding percentage reductions when compared
with the scenario without control at the end of 40 years
simulation for each parameter combination are displayed in

3.5.4. Interrupted Control. Another interesting scenario
explored by our model was the simulation of interrupted
control. We simulated the cumulative number of new cases
by applying control strategies after ten years without control,
followed by a control period of 15 years, and interrupted
again after this period. We used a detection proportion of
25%, a treatment success of 80% of infected newborns, and
surveillance in blood transfusion 80% effective. Figure 8
displays the result. In the first ten years, the number of
new cases increases because there are more infected people
in the population. When control strategies are performed,
the number of new cases decreases because infected people
are treated avoiding transmission by congenital and blood
transfusion routes. When the control strategies are stopped,
the number of new cases start increasing again, since there
will be more infected newborns and people infected by blood
transfusions over time.

4. Discussion

In this work, we used a compartmental mathematical model
to evaluate the dynamics of Chagas disease in a scenario
with vector absence, where the transmission can only occur
through congenital or blood transfusion routes.



8 Complexity

Our results show that, although the total number of
infected individuals presents a decreasing behavior (Fig-
ure 2), in 40 years its reduction reaches less than half of its
initial value, even assuming a death rate for infected individ-
uals as twice the rate for healthy people and no immigration.
It means that if the disease is not taken seriously, it can be
present in the population for a long period of time [31], even
with the vector absence, generating a burden to the public
health system which should be prepared to provide patient
care and conduct an adequate treatment in order to prevent
the long-term disease manifestations.

According to the model, transmission exclusively due to
blood transfusion has a smaller impact on the number of new
cases when compared with the transmission exclusively due
to congenital route (Figure 3). Low prevalence in blood banks
in countries with vector absence, oftentimes by self-exclusion
of Latin American immigrants in transfusion services, can
explain this fact [9]. Nevertheless, blood screening should
be sustained and it is vital to prevent infection through
transfusion and organ transplantation also in nonendemic
countries. Optimizing blood transfusion safety and screening
is one of the resolutions of the World Health Assembly for
the control and elimination of Chagas disease (WHA 63.20)
[7]. In Spain, the control strategy is based on selective donor
screening from a questionnaire and it has been implemented
since 2005. Donations from at-risk individuals are accepted
and the blood is tested [15]. It can prevent a transfusion by
a contaminated blood sample beyond identifying infected
people. Simulation results plotted in Figures 4 and 5 display
the application of isolated control strategies. They show that,
even if all infected newborns are treated or if a totally effective
surveillance in blood banks is reached, the reduction on the
number of new cases when compared with a scenario without
control is not 100% achieved.

Themodel simulation also shows that application of com-
bined control strategies (i.e., treatment of infected newborns
and effective surveillance in blood transfusion) can lead to a
more significant reduction in the number of new cases when
compared with a scenario without control (Figure 6). For
instance, treating 80% of infected newborns and having 60%
of effectiveness on surveillance in blood banks entails 72.6%
less new infections when compared with a scenario without
control. It is important to highlight that, although there are
standard protocols to deal with the disease control, the quality
of the service is very important and sometimes difficult to be
measured. In this sense, the study of patients’ perceptions and
experiences should be included in such protocols in order to
increase the quality assessment of services. This fact justifies
the values used on our parameters associated with control
strategies, varying from 20% to 100% on the effectiveness.

Regarding congenital transmission, an important fact to
mention is that the majority of Latin American immigrants
in Italy, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand are
women in childbearing age, highlighting the importance of
programs to screen pregnant women. These programs lead
to an early detection of congenital transmission, as stated
in World Health Assembly [7]. By 2014 only the Tuscany
region in Italy had legislation to screen pregnant women
from areas considered endemic [8]. In Spain, only Catalonia,

Valencia, and Galicia regions had protocols in screening
pregnant women from Latin America up to 2014 [8]. The
other countries do not have national programs for disease
prevention [32, 33]. The adoption of screening protocols is
extremely important since the identification and treatment of
infected newborns have good therapeutic results [24].

Although the detection of infected people is difficult due
to the asymptomatic characteristic of the disease leading to
an underestimation on the number of current cases [10], our
model tested the effect of a cure rate due to treatment. This
cure rate can be understood as a reduction in the number
of parasites inside the host body. Treatment in chronic
cases can reduce long-term complications caused by the
disease [3, 34]. Nevertheless, treatment accessibility should
be guaranteed for all of the diagnosed patients by eliminating
existing barriers [29]. Regarding women in childbearing age,
detection and treatment also prevent congenital transmission
[35, 36].

Our model results are in accordance with this fact since
the detection and treatment of infected people have an impact
on the cumulative number of new infections (Figure 7).
One important strategy to track infected people is by active
surveillance in primary care and community action in order
to identify pregnant women and follow up their children
[37]. Even with a great effort to conduct this kind of strategy,
in some cases, infected people can be lost. The simulations
results show that there is a reduction in the number of
total infected people by 52.76% if 25% of infected people
are detected and treated when compared with a scenario
without control. The detection and treatment also reduce
the number of new cases when combined with treatment of
infected newborns and surveillance on blood transfusions.
For example, detecting 25% of infected individuals, treating
40% of infected newborns, and having a surveillance in blood
banks 40% efficient, the number of new cases is almost 70%
smaller when compared with a scenario without control. It is
important that the control strategies are sustained; otherwise,
the disease elimination will take even longer to be achieved.
Figure 8 displays a result of a simulation where the control
is applied for a limited period and it is then interrupted.
During the period where control applications are performed,
the number of new cases decreases, but it starts increasing
again when control stops.

The model was applied to Spain, a country without the
vector presence, but it could be similarly applied to other
countrieswith vector absence in order to carry out a diagnosis
of the current epidemiological situation and determine the
order of magnitude of such control strategies’ effects.

It should be recalled that a model is a simplified descrip-
tion of reality. Consequently, it entails necessary simplifica-
tions in order to focus on the stated aims. The proposed
model was sufficient to show the importance of sustaining
the control strategies considered in order to advance steadily
towards the disease elimination. Otherwise, it will be present
in a population for a long time causing long-term clinical
manifestation and a burden on the public health system.

Other aspects can be also explored in future works as, for
example, the introduction of migrations rates. Nevertheless,
although migration flows have a straightforward effect on



Complexity 9

Chagas disease dynamics in nonendemic countries, they
are usually unpredictable and difficult to control. Therefore,
in silico experiments could be used for exploring different
scenarios and proposing possible actions to revert those
negative epidemiological effects. Another control strategy
that could be incorporated into the model for its testing is
the screening of specific collectives in order to detect (and
treat, if necessary) new asymptomatic cases among at-risk
populations [38]. In the case of women in childbearing age,
treating infected women before a future pregnancy would
prevent congenital transmission [36].

Finally, it is also important to point out that the inter- and
transdisciplinary work amongmodelers, health practitioners,
community health workers, patients’ associations, and other
context-specific actors is essential for generating and imple-
menting effective tools for decision making and public health
control policies. In that sense, the development of simple
models and user-friendly simulation platforms will guarantee
that this necessary collaboration between modeling experts
and nonexperts is feasible.

5. Conclusions

Mathematicalmodels can be used as a valuable tool to explore
different scenarios related to disease spread, as well as to
estimate the epidemiological impact when control strategies
are implemented. Interdisciplinary collaboration is extremely
important in this context since it can improve decision
making for the implementation of public policies in order to
reduce the disease burden in public health.
