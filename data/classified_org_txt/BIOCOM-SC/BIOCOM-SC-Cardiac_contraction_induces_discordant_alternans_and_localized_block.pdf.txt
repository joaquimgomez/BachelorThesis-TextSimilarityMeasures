In this paper we use a simplified model of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling to study the effect of tissue
deformation on the dynamics of alternans, i.e., alternations in the duration of the cardiac action potential, that occur
at fast pacing rates and are known to be proarrhythmic. We show that small stretch-activated currents can produce
large effects and cause a transition from in-phase to off-phase alternations (i.e., from concordant to discordant
alternans) and to conduction blocks. We demonstrate numerically and analytically that this effect is the result of a
generic change in the slope of the conduction velocity restitution curve due to electromechanical coupling. Thus,
excitation-contraction coupling can potentially play a relevant role in the transition to reentry and fibrillation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The origin of ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening ar-
rhythmia, lies in the formation and destabilization of reentrant
waves of electrical activity. During normal sinus rhythm, the
cell transmembrane potential propagates in the form of a
pulse-shaped wave, triggering the contraction of the heart.
The initiation of reentry often occurs as the wave encounters
refractory tissue, thereby resulting in localized block, wave
break, and the formation of reentrant spiral waves.

Cardiac alternans is a crucial factor in the emergence of
wave breaks [1]. At the single cell level, alternans is character-
ized by a beat-to-beat alternation in the duration of the excited
phase of the cardiac action potential. When propagating along
tissue, this may result in spatially homogeneous patterns of
oscillations (concordant alternans), or in domains of out-of-
phase oscillations (discordant alternans) [2], as the nonlinear
wave changes its width as it propagates [3,4]. Strikingly,
the main characteristics of this instability can be captured
considering a mesoscopic approach [5]. A description in terms
of coupled maps, relating the action potential duration (APD)
and the conduction velocity (CV) of the action potential, at a
given point, with the local time lapse between the end of an
excitation and the beginning of the following one [diastolic
interval (DI)], reproduces the main characteristic observed
during cardiac alternans. Furthermore, close to the transition to
alternans, the small oscillations in the APD have been shown
to obey a Ginzburg-Landau-type equation with an additional
nonlocal term that causes spontaneous nucleations of domains
giving rise to discordant alternans [6,7].

The dependencies of APD and conduction velocity on DI
are known as APD and CV restitution curves, respectively.
They can be easily calculated numerically from simulations
of ionic models or measured in experiments. In the simplest
formulation, the onset of alternans occurs when the slope of
the APD restitution curve is larger than one, giving rise to a
period-doubling instability of the underlying periodic rhythm
[8,9]. While the onset of alternans is determined by the APD
restitution, its phenomenology is strongly influenced by the
CV restitution [3,4]. When the slope of the CV restitution curve
is positive and different from zero at the onset of alternans,
the transition is always to discordant alternans, with a distance

between out-of-phase domains inversely proportional to this
slope [6].

This phenomenological formulation has been extended to
include such effects as memory [10], intracellular calcium
dynamics [11], and nonmonotonic APD [12] or CV restitution
curves [13]. In this paper, we consider an effect that is
usually neglected when studying the stability of cardiac waves:
the contraction of the tissue. This is often considered to
be a passive consequence of electrical activity. However,
simulations of simplified models of excitation-contraction
coupling [14], as well as of reaction-diffusion equations in
a medium with a varying (oscillatory) metric [15], suggest
that mechanical deformation play an important role for, e.g.,
the stability of spiral waves. This is due to mechanoelectric
feedback whereby mechanical deformations (e.g., stretch)
can modulate electric activity [16]. Mechanoelectric feedback
is mediated by stretch-activated channels in the cellular
membrane [17]. The main goal of this paper is to explore the
possibility that contraction acts as a proarrhythmic substrate
through the induction of discordant alternans and localized
block. For this, we present a mechanism that explains how
a small stretch activated current (SAC) can produce a large
macroscopic effect.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we present
the ionic model, incorporating the effect of mechanoelectric
feedback. In Sec. III we compute its restitution curves, that are
used in Sec. IV to derive coupled maps for the dynamics of the
APD and DI. With these we check the appearance of discordant
alternans as a function of the strength of the stretch activated
current and the length of the system. To calculate the minimum
tissue size necessary for the onset of discordant alternans,
we derive amplitude equations in Sec. V and compute their
solutions analytical and numerically. Finally, in the last section
we present the conclusions and in the appendixes some more
technical details of the derivations.

calcium concentration, stretch activated currents, and strains
and stresses of fibers [18]. To gain insight into the possible
proarrhythmic effects of mechanoelectric feedback, an alter-
native approach is to consider simple models which contain
its basic dynamical ingredients [19]. In this spirit, we use
a reduced mechanoelectrical model, introduced in Ref. [14],
that considers a three-variable Fenton-Karma model [20] for
electrical activation, wherein active stress is coupled directly
to the transmembrane potential. As proposed in Ref. [21], a
linear version of the elastic equations is solved to give rise to a
global coupling term in the reaction-diffusion equations. The
resulting model reads:

where �(·) is the Heaviside unit step function, and the
constants gs and Es give the conductance and Nernst potential
of the stretch activated current Jsa [22]. The variable u
is a normalized voltage u = (V − V0)/(Vf i − V0), Ta the
active tension, and 〈Ta〉 = [

∫ L
0 Ta(x) dx]/L the average active

tension along tissue. Thus, the stretch activated current (SAC)
is different from zero only in those regions where the local
active tension is lower than the average value. The other three
currents, a slow inward (Jsi), a slow outward (Jso), and a fast
inward current (Jf i), involve characteristic time constants τsi ,
τ0, τd and characteristic activation voltages u

We simulate this model on a one-dimensional (1D) cable
of length L with fixed boundaries and nonflux boundary
conditions for the nondimensional transmembrane potential
u. Two sets of parameter values have been selected for
the model. A first set corresponds to parameters that fit
the restitution curves of the Beeler-Reuter model [20,23,24]
(original Beeler-Reuter parameters), which are known to give
rise to discordant alternans due to CV restitution. Alternatively,
we have also used a model version where we have modified
one of the parameters (the recovery time of the w gate), which
is set to τ−w = 95 ms, instead of the original value τ−w = 41 ms.
This change makes the onset of alternans to appear in a regime

where the CV restitution curve is flat, so one would not expect
to obtain discordant alternans in this case. We will denote
modified Beeler-Reuter to this set of parameters. In Fig. 1
we show the transmembrane potential, active tension and the
different currents for this set of parameters.

In Fig. 2 we show plots of the spatial distribution of
APD obtained with the Beeler-Reuter parameters. Below a
given critical fiber length, in the absence of stretch-activated
current (gs = 0), concordant alternans appears [see Fig. 2(a)].
However, if we include contraction and increase the strength of
the stretch-activated current by a small amount, a transition to
discordant alternans is observed for otherwise identical model
parameters [Fig. 2(b)]. Thus, small changes in the SAC suffice
to transform the characteristics of alternans from concordant
to discordant. This finding provokes the question whether this
proarrhythmic scenario is a general feature of action potential
propagation with electromechanical coupling provided by a
stretch activated current.

III. RESTITUTION MAPS

We can understand the effect of SAC uncovered in the
previous section within the framework of the restitution maps
[5]. The change in a single parameter, from the Beeler-Reuter
model to the modified Beeler-Reuter model, modifies the
APD restitution curve, but not the CV restitution [Figs. 3(a)
and 3(b)], so at the onset of alternans the CV restitution curve is
flatter in the latter case than in the former one. In the original
parameters the slope of the APD restitution curve becomes
larger than one at a diastolic internal of DIc = 117.2 ms,
while for the modified parameters this value is increased to
DIc = 202.4 ms where the CV restitution curve is almost flat.

FIG. 2. (Color online) Spatiotemporal plots of the transmem-
brane voltage (top panels) and APD for two consecutive beats in
a cable as a function of the position on the cable (bottom panels, one
beat in blue and the next one in dashed red), for the original Beeler-
Reuter parameters and different conductances of the SAC: (a) gs = 0,
showing concordant alternans, and (b) gs = 0.0065ms −1, resulting in
discordant alternans. Besides the change in gs all the other parameters
are the same. The spacial and time discretizations are dx = 0.025 cm,
for a total length L = 6 cm, and dt = 0.01 ms, respectively. The
pacing Tpace = 340 ms is obtained applying periodically a current
of 1.0 (in nondimensional units) during 0.01 ms at the first 10 grid
points.

Since the minimum tissue size necessary to obtain discordant
alternans depends on this slope [7], we would not expect to
observe discordant alternans with the modified parameters
unless we consider infinitely long cables. More specifically,
an estimate of the minimum tissue size to obtain alternans (for

a stationary node) was given in Ref. [7] as

Lmin = π
√

w�/2, (5)

with � = c2/2(dc/dDI), and w ∼ D/c a coefficient related
with the left-right asymmetry in diffusive coupling for a
propagating pulse. For the modified parameters dc/dDI is very
small so that � → ∞ and discordant alternans never appears
in tissue.

Considering now the coupled excitation-contraction system
in Eqs. (1)–(4) we observe that the coupling with contraction
changes the slope of the CV restitution curve, but not that of the
APD restitution [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)], consistent with results
obtained in more realistic electromechanical models [25].
Thus, the onset of alternans (in cell) does not change, but the
nature of alternans in tissue (either concordant or discordant)
may change due to this coupling. From the expressions for the
minimun tissue size necessary to obtain discordant alternans
given in Eq. (5) the problem seems rather straightforward to
solve. Just measure the slope of the CV restitution curve at the
onset of alternans for different values of the stretch-activated
current conductance gs and from this obtain the minimum
tissue size for the transition to discordant alternans as a
function of gs. However, the situation is more complex, since
the change in the slope is not constant but depends on the
position in tissue at which it is measured. Thus, the formulas
obtained in Ref. [7] to calculate the minimum tissue size are
not valid now, and we have to obtain an equivalent expression
that incorporates the effect of mechanoelectric feedback. This
will be one of the goals of the following sections.

IV. COUPLED MAPS

The dynamics of the system can be studied by a mesoscopic
description using the restitution curves to obtain coupled map
equations for the APD and pacing period T . In general, the
dynamics of the full model can be properly projected into a set
of two maps (see full details in Refs. [6,7]):

T
n(x) = Tpace +

∫ x

, (7)

where Tpace is the pacing period on one end of the cable, T
n,

cn, Dn, and An are the stimulation interval, wave speed, DI,
and APD of the nth pulse, and T n = An + Dn. It is important
to notice that Eq. (7) is strictly the definition of the period at a
given position x while Eq. (6) is a good approximation of the
APD dynamics where the coefficients w and ξ 2 are obtained
from the restitution curves (see Appendix A) giving in our case
w 	 0.145 cm and ξ 2 ∼ 0.2 cm2.

The dynamical system given by Eqs. (6) and (7) must be
closed with an expression for the conduction velocity c. In
the absence of contraction, this is just cn = c(Dn). However,
contraction introduces a spatial dependence that makes the
determination of c nontrivial. Indeed, we have measured
the CV along the tissue for different values of the SAC
conductance parameter gs [Fig. 4(a)] and observed that the
conduction velocity increases as the pulse travels along the

tissue, up to a point where the whole AP has entered the
cable, and a constant conduction velocity is reached. Based
on this observation we consider that, once the whole action
potential is in the cable, the conduction velocity depends both
on the diastolic interval of the previous beat and on the action
potential duration of the current one, so cn+1 = CV(Dn,An+1).
Furthermore, according to Fig. 4(b) we may assume that
the dependence of conduction velocity with APD is linear.
However, this general dependence is not enough to close the
system since it is valid only when the full action potential has
entered the cable. From Fig. 4(a) we can assume that, while the
action potential is entering the cable, the conduction velocity
increases linearly with the distance traveled by the pulse. This
allows us to write the conduction velocity as

c
n+1 = CV(Dn) + αAn+1S(x − cn+1An+1)

+αx/cn+1[1 − S(x − cn+1An+1)], (8)
where S(·) is a sigmoidal function that interpolates between
the regions where the conduction velocity is constant or
grows linearly with x. The coefficient α, which effectively
measures the effect of contraction on conduction velocity, can
be calculated fitting the measured profiles of CV(x) with the
function given in Eq. (8) [Fig. 4(c)], for different values of the
length of the system L and SAC conductance gs. As shown in
Fig. 4(e), plotting the product αL as a function of gs all the
data collapses into a single curve, from which we get

α = gs

(0.06 + 2.8gs). (9)

FIG. 5. (Color online) Phase plot of the different solutions obtained with Eqs. (1)–(4) as a function of the size of the system L and the
normalized strength of the SAC gs , for the (a) original Beeler-Reuter parameters, and T = 343.5 ms and (b) the modified Beeler-Reuter
parameters, with T = 404 ms. The different solutions are concordant alternans (black circles), discordant alternans (green squares), block and
complex behavior (red triangles). The blue triangles correspond to suppression of alternans. Examples of the different solutions are shown
above the phase diagrams, including localized and 2-1 block. In (c) and (d) we show the corresponding phase diagrams obtained with the
maps (6), (7), and (8), with S(x − cA) ≡ 0.5 {1 + tanh[1.2(x − cA)/(cA)]}, showing the transition from concordant to discordant alternans as
a function of gs .

With this, we close the system of equations and can
compare the results of the coupled maps with the full numerical
simulations of the ionic model. When doing the comparison,
however, one should be cautious. Equation (8) is just an
approximation: the conduction velocity actually depends on
the length of the pulse at a given instant on time, and not on
the duration of the pulse at a given point in space, as considered
here. Furthermore, for long tissues (or fast pacing rates) where
more than one pulse is present at the same time in the cable,
one would have to consider the influence of this second pulse.
However, we found that for typical values of L and gs , the
approximation given by Eq. (8) reproduces well the numerical
results from the ionic model.

The simulation of Eqs. (6), (7) together with Eqs. (8), (9),
taking for the sigmoidal S(z) = [1 + tanh(κz)]/2, allows us
to analyze the details of the transition to discordant alternans
as a function of the length of the system and the strength of
stretch-activated current. Both the full model (1)–(4) with the
parameters of the original and modified Beeler-Reuter models
and the coupled maps present a transition from concordant to

discordant alternans induced by contraction (Fig. 5). For the
parameters in the modified Beeler-Reuter model, the slope of
CV restitution is negligible at the onset of alternans. Thus,
discordant alternans never appears for gs = 0 [Fig. 5(b)].
Contraction alone is able to provoke the transition from
concordant to discordant alternans in this case, as observed in
simulations of the full model [Fig. 5(b)] and the coupled maps
[Fig. 5(d)], changing gs for fixed L. For the original parameters
of the Beeler-Reuter model, there is a transition to discordant
alternans as the length L of the cable is increased, even in the
absence of contraction, due to a positive slope of the CV restitu-
tion curve at the onset of alternans. The effect of contraction is
to shift this transition to lower values of L [Figs. 5(a) and 5(c)].

V. AMPLITUDE EQUATIONS

In the previous section we showed that numerical simu-
lations of the coupled maps are in good agreement with the
results from the full model. We can, therefore, analyze in
more detail the coupled maps in Eqs. (6), (7) in order to obtain

022703-5

further information about the solutions and the mechanism
behind the transition from concordant to discordants alternans.
Specifically, our goal is to obtain a value for the minimum
length necessary to obtain discordant alternans due to the
presence of stretch-activated currents.

Close to the bifurcation to alternans, we can consider small
oscillations of the APD and stimulation interval, An(x) 	
A∗ + (−1)na(x,t), T n(x) 	 T ∗ + (−1)nb(x,t), which are as-
sumed to vary on slow time and spatial scales around the
values at the bifurcation point. Introducing these expressions
in Eqs. (6), (7), and (8) and carrying out some algebra (see
Appendix B), it can be shown that the small oscillations obey
a Ginzburg-Landau-type equation:

τ∂ta = σa − ga3 − w∂xa + ξ 2∂2x a − b. (10)
The effect of contraction is now hidden in the form of b,
which is a complex function that depends on the slope of CV
restitution and the strength of parameter α. In the limit when
there is no dispersion (dCV/dDI = 0) and S(x − cA) is very
steep and can be approximated by a Heaviside function, this
expression greatly simplifies to (see Appendix B)

b = 1
�

∫ x
0

�(x ′ − c∗A∗)a(x ′) dx ′ (11)

with � = c∗2/2α, and c∗ the conduction velocity at the onset
of alternans. This is similar to the known expression due to
CV restitution [6] b ∼

∫ x
0 a(x

′) dx ′ but with b different from
zero only for cables longer than c∗A∗, which corresponds to
the width of the pulse at the onset of the bifurcation. The
reason for this is clear: if the system size is smaller than the
width of the pulses, then there is no difference in conduction
velocity at alternative beats. From Eq. (8), and considering
S(·) a Heaviside function �(·), it is easy to see that, in that
case, the CV does not depend on An+1. Beyond that point,
the mechanism behind discordant alternans is the same as for
conduction velocity dispersion. During alternans, a pulse with
a long APD develops a higher active tension, which stretches
the tissue in front of it [Fig. 6(a)]. Since the stretch-activated
current appears where the tissue is distended, it is precisely in
the case of long (short) APD that the tissue ahead of the front
becomes more (less) depolarized. Then, a pulse with a long
APD has a higher velocity than a pulse with a short APD, due
to a larger stretch-activated current (Fig. 6), and catches it up
as it travels along tissue, until a node is formed.

A. Stability analysis

We are interested in obtaining expressions for when the
instability to alternans occurs and which is the minimum
tissue size necessary to observe discordant alternans. For
that, we perform a linear stability analysis of the amplitude
equation (10) around the nonalternating solution a = 0 and
find an analytical expression for the eigenvalue and the eigen-
function corresponding to the marginal mode. Let us consider
a(x,t) = exp(t/τ )�(x). Then, linearizing we obtain

can set φ = φ̃e−wx0/ξ 2 , with φ̃ ∼ O(1). After some algebra,
for �1(x) we get the solution at first order:

In order to match �2 and �1 at x = xo we can use
the fraction �1f = � ′1/�1 evaluated at x = xo, which is
independent of C1. Then,

which after imposing φ = φ̃e−wx0/ξ 2 reads �1f (x = x0)

Now we have to solve the equation for �2 matching to
the slope given by (21) at x = x0. A general solution can be
searched in the form �2 = Aeq(x−x1) where q is a complex
number. Introducing this function in Eq. (14) one notices that
using the complex conjugate of q we can eliminate the new
term appearing in the integral. We find thus a particular solution
which reads:

�2 =C2[eq(x−x1) + eq
∗(x−x1)] = C2e−ρ(x−x1) cos[k(x−x1)],

(22)

where q∗ is the complex conjugate of q = −ρ + ik with ρ and
k being real values. Notice that the scale of Lmin is given by
the first zero of this function, which is directly related to the

wave number k. Imposing that Eq. (22) satisfies the amplitude
equation we get, after some algebra, the conditions

tan k(x0 − x1) =

The four equations (23)–(26) determine the four unknowns of
the problem, i.e., ̃, k, ρ, and x1.

To check the validity of the previous solution, we solved
numerically the linear eigenvalue problem associated with
(10), linearized and discretized in space, using a finite
difference representation of the derivatives and the trapezoidal
rule for the integral. Looking for exponentially growing or

and aN+1 = aN−1. The resulting eigenvalue problem is then
solved for the complex growth rate  = r + ii , and the
corresponding eigenmodes.

In Fig. 7 we show a comparison of the eigenmodes obtained
from the analytical solution, the solution of the eigenvalue
problem and the full maps, showing an excellent agreement.
This is specially remarkable for the comparison with the full

solutions to Eq. (30): ρ = 0, or ρ = −w/2ξ 2. However, for
large values of � looking for a solution around ρ = 0 gives
a very bad approximation. For both typical and large values
of �, ρ is indeed small but not extremely close to zero. In
this circumstance one can neglect the cubic term in Eq. (30)

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have considered a mechanoelectric model
that couples active tension directly to a simplified model of the
cardiac excitability and analyzed an equivalent coupled map
scenario, to show that tissue contractions have a proarrythmic
effect and may cause discordant alternans. The model shows
that a small contraction effect suffices to induce the transition
from concordant to dicordant alternans via its influence on the
conduction velocity properties. In our model, stretch increases
the conduction velocity, in accordance to what has been
observed in other numerical studies under similar conditions
[25]. The reason is that stretch opens the stretch activated
channels, elevating the resting potential, thus making it easier
to depolarize.

We have performed a detailed analytical treatment in terms
of coupled maps and their amplitude equation. This has
allowed us to uncover the basic mechanism for discordant
alternans. As an effect of the stretch-activated current, a pulse
with a long APD has a higher velocity than a pulse with a short

APD, so the two pulses approach, decreasing the DI and thus
the APD of the long pulse, until a node is formed. This happens
in situations where the derivative of the conduction velocity
with the diastolic interval is zero, which, in the absence of
stretch-activated currents, would make discordant alternans
impossible. An analysis of the amplitude equation has allowed
us to show that the minimum length of the system needed to
observe discordant alternans increases as the inverse of the
strength of the stretch-activated as this goes to zero.

A limitation of our formulation is that it considers linear
elasticity, whereas the elastic response of real tissue is known
to be highly nonlinear. Still, given that the transition from
concordant to discordant alternans occurs even at very small
values of the stretch-activated conductance, this would not
affect the qualitative prediction of the model. Perhaps a bigger
uncertainty remains in the correct form of the stretch activated
current. In fact, it has been observed that the conductance of
this current is not a constant, but varies with time, having an
activation time of ∼20ms to peak current, and then a decay
to half the peak current value in about 50 ms [26]. The simple
formulation of the SAC used in this paper would consider
average values and assume that the transients are fast in the
time scale of development of active tension. Furthermore, the
coupling between excitation and contraction in our model is
very simplistic and does not take into account the role played
by intracellular calcium. In this respect, it cannot account for
alternans due to intracellular calcium, or for changes in the
resting potential due to the effect of stretch on the dynamics
of calcium handling [27].

More importantly, our analysis assumes an increase of
conduction velocity with stretch. Indeed, there exists exper-
imental and numerical evidence showing that this is the case
for moderate values of stretch [25,28], although the relation
has often been observed to be biphasic [28]. At larger values
of stretch the increase in the resting potential inactivates the
sodium channels, resulting in slower conduction and even
conduction block. However, there are also experiments where
conduction velocity has been observed to be constant or
to decrease with stretch [28–31]. Thus, the validity of our
assumptions is not clear in this point. Even so, under the
conditions considered in the paper, the scenario unveiled
here is general and the conclusions hold generally. Whenever
stretch is created in front of the pulse increasing the conduction
velocity, a small stretch-activated current together with the
nonlocal nature of the interaction produce discordant alternans.

An open question is the generalization of our results to
two- (2D) or three-dimensional tissue, which would be the
relevant case for the heart. In a 2D tissue, in the case where
radial symmetry can be assumed, the effect of stretch is the
same as in 1D tissue [32] and one would expect similar results.
However, in two dimensions the effect of contraction is very
dependent on the position of the pacing point and the form
(and type) of the boundaries [33,34]. This is specially relevant
given the complex interaction between walls in a real heart, a
question that cannot be addressed without further knowledge
of heart contraction. Also interesting is the effect of MEF in
the case where a spiral is present in 2D tissue with standard
boundary conditions. MEF is known to produce a drift of the
spiral, proportional to the strength of the SAC [25]. However,
in the presence of alternans, the topology of the spiral induces

CARDIAC CONTRACTION INDUCES DISCORDANT . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 91, 022703 (2015)

the formation of nodal lines [35], which can present complex
dynamics [36,37]. Our results in 1D suggest that one would
expect a transition from a straight nodal line (corresponding to
concordant alternans in the radial direction) to a spiraling one
(corresponding to discordant alternans) due to MEF, at least as
long as there are not multiple arms of the spiral in the tissue.
Analyzing this latter case is a natural next step to understand
the effect of MEF in cardiac alternans.

APPENDIX A: CALCULATION OF
THE COEFFICIENTS w, ξ 2

We will calculate w and ξ 2 as sketched in Ref. [7]. For that,
we have to consider parameters for which there is discordant

alternans in the tissue. Computing D(x), we can find the
position of a node x∗, for which Dn+1(x∗) = Dn(x∗) = D∗.
Since, from the restitution curve A = f (D), we would expect
to see the same value of the APD at two consecutive beats at
that value of DI. If there is a difference, it must be due to the
spatial terms, that cause a splitting of the restitution curves:

A
n+1(x) = fS1S2[Dn(x)] − w∂xDn(x) + ξ 2∂2xDn(x). (A1)

Thus, since close to the node in DI, the second derivative is
almost zero:

A
n+1(x∗) − An(x∗) 	 w[∂xDn−1(x∗) − ∂xDn(x∗)]. (A2)

Then

w 	 A
n+1(x∗) − An(x∗)

∂xD
n−1(x∗) − ∂xDn(x∗)

. (A3)

In the example shown in Fig. 8, we have

w 	 4.25 ms
29.28 ms/cm

= 0.145 cm. (A4)

For the coefficient ξ 2 we will take the estimate ξ 2 ∼ D ×
APD ∼ 0.2cm2.

APPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF THE AMPLITUDE
EQUATIONS

1. General approach

To derive the amplitude equation (10) from the maps (6),
(7), we first consider the expression for the pacing period at a
given point in tissue, which reads:

T
n(x) =

∫ L
0

dx ′

c[Dn(x ′),An+1(x ′),An(x ′)]

−
∫ L

dx ′

c[Dn−1(x ′),An(x ′),An−1(x ′)]
, (B1)

or, differentiating,

dT n(x)

dx
= 1

c[Dn(x),An+1(x),An(x)]

− 1
c[Dn−1(x),An(x),An−1(x)]

. (B2)

As explained in the text, we will assume that the dependence
of CV on the current and previous APDs is negligible so that
combining Eqs. (B2) and (8) we can write

dT n

dx
= 1

c(Dn) + αAn+1S(zn+1) + αx/cn+1[1 − S(zn+1)]
(B3)

− 1
c(Dn−1) + αAnS(zn) + αx/cn[1 − S(zn)]

, (B4)

where we recall here again that zn = x − cnAn.
Now, if oscillations are small because we are close to the

onset of alternans, we can expand the period and the APD
around their value at the onset (T ∗,A∗):

T
n(x) 	 T ∗ + (−1)nb(x,t), (B5)

A
n(x) 	 A∗ + (−1)na(x,t), (B6)

where a/A∗,b/T ∗ � 1 vary slowly in time and space. The
general goal before obtaining the final amplitude equation is
to be able to write db/dx as a function of b and a. To do it,
we expand the previous expressions up to first order in α and
a,b to get

c(Dn) 	 c(D∗) + c′∗(−1)n(b − a) ≡ c∗ + c′∗(−1)n(b − a),
(B7)

S(zn) 	 S(x − [c∗ + c′∗(−1)n(b − a)][A∗ + (−1)na])
	 S(x − c∗A∗) − S ′(x − c∗A∗)(−1)n

× [c∗a + c′∗A∗(b − a)]
≡ S(z∗) − S ′(z∗)(−1)nG(b,a), (B8)

where, in Eq. (B7), we have used that, at constant pac-
ing, T n = An + Dn. Notice that to shorten the notation we
have defined c∗ ≡ c(D∗), c′∗ ≡ dc/dD(D∗), S(z∗) ≡ S(x −
c∗A∗), S ′(z∗) ≡ S ′(x − c∗A∗), and G(b,a) = (c∗ − c′∗A∗)a +
c′∗A∗b. We can now use this expansion to expand the

denominators of Eq. (B4) to get

c(Dn) + αAn+1S + αx/cn+1(1 − S)
	 c∗ + c′∗(−1)n(b − a) + α[A∗ + (−1)n+1a]

× [S(z∗) + S ′(z∗)(−1)n+1G(b,a)]

+ c′∗A∗x/c∗)]
+α[S(z∗)A∗ + [1 − S(z∗)]x/c∗]. (B9)

The term α[S(z∗)A∗ + (1 − S(z∗))x/c∗] is just the change in
conduction velocity due to the APD that is present even in the
absence of alternans [see Fig. 3(c) in the main text]. The last
term in Eq. (B9) is the combined effect due to contraction and
alternans and has two contributions: αaS(z∗), which takes into
account the fact that the APD is changing in consecutive beats,
and so does its effect on the velocity, and αaS(z′∗)(A∗c∗ − x),
which takes into account that the length of the AP is changing
from beat to beat, and so does the point at which the speed
reaches a plateau.

Using the former expression, it is not difficult to expand

(B10)

in order to compute dT n/dx and, in this way, to obtain an
expression for b, since dT n/dx 	 (−1)ndb/dx, using that
oscillations in pacing period are much smaller that oscillations

where we have defined the length scales � = c∗2/2c′∗ and
� = c∗2/2α, which measure the relative importance of CV
dispersion and excitation-contraction coupling, respectively.

2. Amplitude equation and its simplification

Once Eq. (B11) has been obtained, we can now use the
results (and derivation) of the amplitude equation as described
in Ref. [7]. Taking into account that the map for the APD,
Eq. (6), is not modified, one obtains

τ∂ta = σa − ga3 − w∂xa + ξ 2∂2x a − b (B12)

022703-10

(B13)

Solving the above equation exactly is cumbersome, but
we can obtain a fairly simplified expression by doing some
approximations. First, let us assume that, without contraction,
dispersion is negligible. This is actually the case for the
second set of parameters, which were chosen precisely to make
� → ∞. The amplitude equation for a reads as

Given that S(z) is a rather steep function let us write the
hyperbolic tangent as

S(z) = �(z) + R(z), S ′(z) = κ
2 cosh2(κz)

(B15)

with R(z) being the difference between the � function and
S(z). We can then write the amplitude equations as

(B16)

Now we can consider a rather important approximation. For
large κ values in S(z), the difference between the functions
S(z) and �(z) becomes is small, and we can take

∫ x
0

�(x ′ − c∗A∗)a dx ′ =

getting

τ∂ta = σa − ga3 − w∂xa + ξ 2∂2x a −

This amplitude equation is a good approximation of
the coupled map dynamics whenever the amplitude of the
alternation is small and when the � function is a good
representation of the sigmoidal function S(z). The first is
accomplished if we are close to the alternans threshold;
the second can depend on the particular implementation of
the sigmoid function. We have used S = tanh(x − cA) so
far, but other implementations like S = tanh[(x − cA)/cA]
(which leads to the same amplitude equation) are possible. In
the particular case of S = tanh[(x − cA)/cA], the amplitude
equation is a better approximation of the coupled model for
shorter lengths and larger mechanoelectric coupling even when
one could expect the amplitude equation to fail. Let us note
that, using simulations of the full coupled model, we have
tested these approximation. We know that they generally
overestimate the value of the characteristic length scale needed
to obtain discordant alternans but give the right order of
magnitude.

[22] Notice that the conductance of Jsa in this formulation cor-

responds to gs = GskT /E in Ref. [14], with kT being the
normalization factor of the active tension E = 2(c1 + c2) and c1
and c2 the coefficients of the strain energy function. Considering
the parameters kT = 5 MPa, c1 = 2 MPa, c2 = 6 MPa, then
Gs = 3.2gs .

[23] The parameters are V0 = −85 mV, Vf i = 15 mV, τd = 0.25 ms,
τr = 33.3 ms, τsi = 29.0 ms, τ0 = 12.5 ms, τ+v = 3.33 ms,
τ
