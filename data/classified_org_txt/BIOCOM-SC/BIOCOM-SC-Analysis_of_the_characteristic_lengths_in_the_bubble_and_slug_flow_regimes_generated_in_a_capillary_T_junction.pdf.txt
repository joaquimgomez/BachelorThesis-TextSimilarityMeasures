Abstract

We present an analysis of the geometry of the continuous and disperse

phases in the bubble and slug flow regimes in air-water mixtures generated

in a capillary T-junction of 1 mm internal diameter. Bubble size dispersion

is very low in the considered flow patterns. The concept of unit cell is used to

identify two characteristic lengths of the two-phase flow, namely, the unit cell

length and the bubble length. The relationship between these lengths and

the gas and liquid superficial velocities, gas mean velocity, bubble generation

frequency and volume average void fraction is analysed. We conclude that in

the considered configuration the unit cell and bubble lengths can be predicted

either by the ratio of the gas-liquid superficial velocities or the volume average

void fraction.

1. Introduction

The study of gas-liquid flows in capillaries has increased notably in the

last decades due to their technological interest in different industries such as

chemical, nuclear or space (Baroud and Willaime, 2004). The lower weight

and better efficiency of two-phase systems with respect to systems containing

only liquids makes them an interesting alternative in different applications

such as the thermal control in spacecraft. The control of the length and shape

of the bubbles in these flows is a key technological issue. The relationship

between the bubble velocity, volume average void fraction, and geometry of

the continuous and the disperse phases can provide useful information on the

bubble characteristics.

In the recent years, numerous studies have been carried out on the char-

acteristics of bubbles in two-phase flows. Barnea and Taitel (1993) analysed

the length of elongated bubbles in vertical columns. By imposing a random

dispersion in the bubble size at the inlet of the column, the authors stud-

ied the evolution of the bubble length and the occasional merging between

bubbles. Garstecki et al. (2006) related the capillary number with the for-

mation of bubbles and droplets in microfluidic T-junctions. The comparison

of the contribution of the shear stress and the pressure drop in the bubble

formation allowed the authors to obtain a simple scaling law that satisfacto-

rily predicted the bubble length in most of the cases considered. Xu et al.

(2006) studied the flow patterns of monodisperse microbubbles in microflu-

idic T-junction devices. The authors described the mechanism of formation

of monodisperse microbubbles using the crossflowing shear-rupturing tech-

nique, relating the bubble size with the continuous phase flow velocity and

viscosity. Agostini et al. (2008) proposed a model to relate the length and

velocity of elongated bubbles in low pressure refrigerants in microchannels.

Revellin et al. (2008) deepened the previous study by considering a new set of

data for elongated bubbles in R-134a, and proposing new expressions relating

bubble velocity and length. Guo and Chen (2009) modelled a micro-channel

T-junction using the volume of fluid method and reproduced the interface

2



of immiscible gas-liquid flows, comparing it with experimental results. The

authors provided a description of the mechanism of bubble break-off and a

value of the transition capillary number from squeezing regime to shearing

regime. Following earlier works of Qian and Lawal (2007) and Sobieszuk et

al. (2010) on the slug flow regime, Kawahara et al. (2012) characterised this

regime in horizontal microchannels. The authors analysed several fluids in

rectangular and circular microchannels, presenting new correlations of the

bubble length in terms of the homogeneous void fraction.

In this paper we present an experimental analysis of the characteristic

lengths in the bubble and slug flow regimes, namely, the unit cell and the

bubble lengths. Bubbles with larger and smaller length than the capillary

diameter have been considered. In section 2 the experimental setup is de-

scribed. The methodology of the experimental analysis and an insight into

the theoretical background are shown in section 3. In section 4 the ex-

perimental results are presented and compared with previous results in the

literature. Concluding remarks are given in section 5.

2. Experimental setup

The experimental setup (Fig. 1) is composed of four main parts: test

section, gas supply system, liquid supply system, and data acquisition and

control system. This setup allows an accurate control of the gas and liquid

injection into the test cell. As a consequence, the setup provides the forma-

tion of regular trains of bubbles with small size dispersion (Arias et al., 2009,

2010, 2013; Arias, 2011).

A two-phase flow is generated in the test section consisting of a methacry-

late T-junction formed by two capillaries of internal diameter φc = 1 mm (see

Fig. 2). Generation of bubbles is provided by the liquid cross-flow in the T-

junction (Carrera et al., 2008).

Figure 2: Bubble generator. Lengths are in mm.

Gas is injected at constant flow rate into the test section from a 5 litres

gas storage tank (G1 in Fig. 1) at 200 bar. The tank manometer regulates

4



pressure up to 10 bar with an uncertainty smaller than 0.1 bar. A remov-

able micron filter (HOKEr 6200 series, G2) at the outlet of the manometer

avoids potential damages caused by particles. Further pressure reduction

is achieved by means of a Bronkhorstr gas pressure controller/meter (G3),

which regulates the pressure at the manometer outlet with an uncertainty

smaller than 0.01 bars. In order to obtain an accurate gas mass flow rate,

a choked orifice (G4) is connected to the pressure controller. Given a pres-

sure at the choked orifice inlet, it is possible to know the outlet pressure and

flow rate. A constant orifice inlet pressure stabilises the flow rate and avoids

fluctuations at the T-junction inlet. The gas volumetric flow rate is mea-

sured at the T-junction inlet with an uncertainty smaller than 0.5 ml/min

by means of a Bronkhorstr F-201C9 mass flow meter (G5). An anti-return

valve (G6) stops any flow coming from the T-junction. Teflon and Gyrolokr

standard fittings are used in tubing to provide resistance to high pressure

and to avoid flow leakage, respectively. Liquid is injected into the test sec-

tion by means of an Ismatecr MCP-Z pump (L3) with an uncertainty lower

that 1 ml/min. A HOKEr removable micron filter (L2) is located between

the liquid tank (L1) and the pump. The liquid flow rate is measured at the

inlet of the T-junction by a Bronkhorstr L30 liquid flow mass meter (L4)

with an uncertainty smaller than 0.5 ml/min. An anti-return valve (L5)

at the T-junction inlet stops any flow coming from it. Residual liquid and

gas are conducted to a waste tank (L6) connected to the main liquid tank

(L1). Liquid and gas mass flow meters and the pressure controller/meter are

connected to a DC regulated Blausonicr power supply (DA2).

The equipment is controlled by means of a computer (DA4). The for-

mation of bubbles at the T-junction is recorded by a Redlaker MotionXtra

HG-SE high-speed camera (DA1), which allows a recording speed between

500 fps (with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024 pixels) and 32000 fps. Rear

5



lighting is supplied by an array of LED (DA5), and a piece of paper (DA6)

homogenises light for a better visualisation of the gas-liquid interface. A DC

regulated Blausonicr power supply feeds the light source (DA3). Images are

processed by means of the software provided by the camera manufacturer.

3. Methodology

The structure and geometric characteristics of periodic two-phase flows

can be analysed by focusing in an elementary part of the flow, the unit

cell (Dukler et al., 1975; Fabre and Liné, 1992; Wallis, 1969). The unit cell

is composed of one bubble, the liquid surrounding it, and the liquid slug

between it and the preceding bubble. The characterisation of the bubble and

the unit cell geometry can be obtained from the relevant lengths in the cell

(Fig. 3): the unit cell length LUC defined as the distance between the tip (or

the rearmost point) of two consecutive bubbles, and the bubble length LB

given by the distance between the bubble tip and its rearmost point. LUC

and LB are obtained from the analysis of the high-speed camera images in

each experiment. Occasionally and specially for fast bubbles the gas-liquid

interface was blurred or distorted, which caused certain inaccuracies when

measuring lengths. An error of 0.07 mm is associated to the interface in

these cases. Consequently, a maximum measured error of 0.14 mm (counting

twice the interface) is estimated for LUC and LB. This error is one order of

magnitude smaller than all the values of LUC and most of the values of LB

presented in this work.

Experiments were performed at constant room temperature with syn-

thetic air (density ρG = 1.2 kg/m
3, viscosity µG = 10

−5 Pa·s) and distilled

water (density ρL = 10
3 kg/m3, viscosity µL = 10

−3 Pa·s) and surface tension

σ = 0.072 N/m. Constant liquid and gas flow rates (QL = 2.0-80.0 ml/min

and QG = 1.7-99.0 ml/min, respectively) were considered in each experi-

mental run. Once the gas-liquid flow stabilised, images of the test section

were recorded at 4000 fps for each selected pair (QL,QG). The high-speed

camera focused on the T-junction to record the bubble formation process.

The camera also provided information of the flow up to a distance of 20×φc
downstream the T-junction. Fig. 4 shows images of the two flow patterns

(bubble and slug) analysed, as defined by Dukler et al. (1988). According

to this definition, the transition between the bubble and slug flow regimes

takes place when the bubble diameter is equal to the capillary diameter. The

geometry and position of bubbles are not always symmetric with respect to

the main capillary centreline (see Fig. 4-(a)) because neither the injection of

gas nor the bubble’s break-up are symmetric to the centreline. Only when

the two-phase flow moves downstream and away from the T-junction it is

expected to become fully developed and symmetric to the main channel cen-

treline.

(USG = 0.241 m/s, USL = 0.212 m/s). Gravity is directed downwards in the pictures.

Table 1 shows the range of average gas and liquid superficial velocities

(USG = QG/A and USL = QL/A, A being the capillary cross-sectional area)

in the bubble and slug flow regimes. Measurement errors were estimated

taking into account the error of the gas pressure controller and the flow

meter (0.18 ml/min and 0.5 ml/min, respectively) for USG, and the liquid

pump and the flow meter (1 ml/min and 0.5 ml/min, respectively) for USL.

This estimation provided errors of 1.4 × 10−2 m/s and 3.2 × 10−2 m/s for
USG and USL, respectively.

The Reynolds number shown in Table 1 is obtained from the average mix-

ture superficial velocity (UM = USG +USL), ReM = ρLUMφc/µL. Since 95 %

of the ReM values were smaller than 2000, we assume laminar conditions.

In the considered experimental conditions, capillary forces dominate over

gravity ((ρL − ρG)gφ2c/σ = 0.139). The capillary number, calculated for the
continuous phase (CSL = µLUSL/σ), ranged from 5.8 × 10−4 to 2.3 × 10−2

(see Table 1). According to our observations, only experiments in which

CSL < 1.5 × 10−3 (less than 3 % of the total) were fully in the squeezing
regime, with no significant shearing effect. This value of the capillary number

is of the same order or magnitude than the values at the transition point be-

tween the squeezing and shearing regimes provided by Guo and Chen (2009)

(CSL < 5.8 × 10−3) and Oishi et al. (2008) (CSL = 3 × 10−3). We observed
the shearing effect in all the experiments with CSL > 1.5 × 10−3, becoming
more evident as the liquid superficial velocity increased. Nevertheless, even

in these cases the squeezing mechanism was still present during the break-up

and detachment of bubbles. Thus, most of the experimental results anal-

ysed in this work lie at the transition region between the interfacial-tension

dominated and the shear-dominated regimes.

For the considered experimental conditions, according to the drift-flux

model the gas mean (or bubble) velocity is given by UG = C0 · (USL + USG)
(Colin et al., 1991), where C0 is the void fraction distribution coefficient (Zu-

ber and Findlay, 1969). C0 depends on the flow structure and is determined

by the void profile and the effects of gas and liquid velocity. In a previous

work with similar experimental conditions to this one, C0 was 1.22 (Arias et

al., 2013), which is in good agreement with earlier studies (McQuillen et al.,

1998). We assume this value along the present work.

Bubbles achieve a constant velocity right after their generation in the T-

junction. Table 1 shows the range of values of UG and of the volume average

9



void fraction (ratio between the bubble volume and the volume of the unit

cell), α = USG/UG. Combining the definitions of UG and α, one can obtain

the ratio between the gas and liquid superficial velocities:

(1)

The bubble generation frequency f in the T-junction presents a linear

and a saturation regime depending on the value of USG (Fig. 5) (Arias et

al., 2009, 2010). The frequency grows linearly with USG at low values of it,

while the bubble size remains constant at large values of USG. f reaches

a saturation value fsat, which is related to the minimum time necessary to

form a bubble. In the saturation regime the bubble size grows as USG is

increased. The location of the crossover region between regimes depends on

USL. Bubble size in the linear regime was already reported in previous works

(Arias et al., 2009, 2010). The data analysed here correspond to the bubble

and slug flow regimes in saturated conditions.

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Bubble generation

Assuming a high regularity and a small bubble size dispersion in the

bubble generation process, the volume of liquid required to detach a bubble

VL is given by:

VL = QL/f (2)

Therefore, for a given liquid flow rate, if the time required to generate

each bubble is constant, the volume of liquid needed to detach each bubble

will also be constant. The length of the liquid required to detach a bubble

becomes a characteristic length of the phenomenon and can be expressed

as LL = VL/A. Thus, Eq. 2 can be rewritten to obtain a prediction of the

bubble generation frequency:

f =
QL
ALL

=
USL
LL

(3)

In the saturation regime (f = fsat), the volume of liquid required to

detach a bubble at a given QL reaches a constant and minimum value given

by VL|min = A · LL|min, where LL|min is the minimum liquid characteristic
length. LL|min is independent of USG and USL, which can be derived from an
expression of fsat when experimental errors are neglected (Arias et al., 2010):

fsat ≈ 719.6 · USL, (4)

Combining Eq. 3 with Eq. 4, we obtain LL|min = 1.39 · 10−3 m and
VL|min = 1.09 mm3. The value of LL|min and VL|min is intrinsic of the bubble
generator in the saturation regime. In fact, it is determined by the injector

geometrical characteristics and the fluid properties.

11



For the sake of convenience, in the following sections length is normalised

by the capillary diameter (e.g. L̄L|min = LL|min/φc = 1.39), and volume is
normalised by the capillary cross-sectional area times the capillary diameter

(e.g. V̄L|min = VL|min/(A · φc) = L̄L|min = 1.39).

4.2. Unit cell length

The time required to form a unit cell can be considered as the time

between the detachment of two consecutive bubbles, and is given by the

inverse of the generation frequency. Along this time the unit cell moves a

distance LUC at the gas mean velocity UG. Therefore, the dimensionless

unit cell length is given by L̄UC = UG/(f φc). Combining it with Eq. 3, one

obtains:

L̄UC = L̄L
UG
USL

, (5)

which, applying the drift-flux model, can be expressed as:

L̄UC = C0 L̄L

(

)
(6)

Therefore, in the saturation regime in both bubble and slug flow patterns,

the dimensionless unit cell length is given by (C0 L̄L = C0 L̄L|min = 1.7):

L̄UC = 1.7

USL

)
(7)

Fig. 6 shows the experimental values of the normalised unit cell length as

a function of the ratio between gas and liquid superficial velocities, as well

as the prediction given by Eq. 7. A good agreement is observed between

experimental data and the theoretical prediction in both bubble and slug

flow regimes. This prediction turns out to be appropriate when the gas and

liquid volume flow rates (and hence the gas and liquid superficial velocities)

are available, which is a common scenario.

By substituting Eq. 1 into Eq. 6, we obtain a relation between the nor-

malised unit cell length and the void fraction:

(8)

It can be derived from Eq. 8 that in the limit of α → 0, the unit cell
length tends to the value C0 · L̄L. In the saturation regime, Eq. 8 becomes:

Fig. 7 shows the experimental values of the normalised unit cell length as

a function of the volume average void fraction, as well as the prediction given

by Eq. 9. Given the accuracy of the prediction in the considered regimes,

Eq. 9 turns out to be useful when a direct measurement of α is provided.

Fig. 7 also shows that the transition between the bubble and the slug flow

13



regimes takes place at α ≈ 0.2, which is in good agreement with previous
results (Arias et al., 2013).

4.3. Bubble volume

During the process of bubble generation in the T-junction, bubble shape

and size vary while gas is being injected. Bubbles grow until they reach a

diameter close to the capillary diameter, when their shape becomes elongated

due to the interaction with the capillary walls. When the bubble length

becomes several times larger than the capillary diameter, the bubble shape

consists of a cylindrical main body with a bullet-shaped nose. Bubbles may

recover their spherical shape as a result of the surface tension if they leave

the capillary (e.g. when the generated train of bubbles is injected into a tank

of dimensions substantially larger than the capillary).

Assuming a high regularity and consequently a small size dispersion dur-

ing the bubble generation process, the average bubble volume is given by:

14



VB = QG/f (10)

Considering Eq. 2 and QG/QL = USG/USL, one can express the bubble

volume as:

VB = ALL ·
USG
USL

, (11)

which, normalised by the capillary cross-sectional area times the capillary

diameter, becomes:

V̄B = L̄L ·
USG
USL

. (12)

Considering the value L̄L|min = 1.39 in the saturation regime, we obtain:

V̄B = 1.39 ·
USG
USL

(13)

Fig. 8 shows the normalised average bubble volume as a function of the

ratio between the gas and liquid superficial velocities. The experimental val-

ues of VB were obtained from Eq. 10 and later normalised with the capillary

cross-sectional area times the capillary diameter. The theoretical prediction

represented in Fig. 8 corresponds to Eq. 13. A good agreement between

the experimental data and the theoretical prediction of the average bubble

volume is found. As expected, bubble size grows when USG increases at a

given USL. Likewise, decreasing USL with a constant USG generates larger

bubbles, which can be explained by the fact that a smaller USL reduces the

liquid drag force and slows down the bubble detachment process. Therefore,

Fig. 8 demonstrates that an accurate control of the average bubble volume

(hence, the bubble size) can be achieved by using the T-junction studied in

this work.

15



According to Dukler’s criterion (Dukler et al., 1988), the transition be-

tween the bubble and slug flow regime takes place at V̄B = 2/3 (volume of

a spherical bubble of 1 mm in diameter). According to Eq. 13, this value

is reached at USG/USL ≈ 0.48, as can be observed in Fig.. 8. Therefore,
Eq. 13 provides an accurate prediction for the bubble and slug flow regimes

obtained in the considered conditions. The general expression of the bubble

volume given by Eq. 12 is used in the next section to provide an prediction

of the bubble length in both flow patterns in the saturation regime.

4.4. Bubble length

In order to analyse the behaviour of the bubble length, LB, it is convenient

to consider separately the two flow regimes.

16



In the bubble flow regime, the bubble diameter is smaller than the cap-

illary diameter and USG/USL � 1 (Fig. 8). Bubbles are dispersed in the
continuous liquid phase and weakly affected by the capillary walls, which

allow them to adopt an spherical shape determined by surface tension. Nev-

ertheless, if the liquid drag is large enough (even for very low USL) the bubble

shape may differ from a sphere (Carrera et al., 2008). The visualisation of

the bubbles considered in this analysis, allows us to assume that they are

spherical in the bubble regime. The volume of a spherical bubble is given

by VSB =
π
6
LB

3. Scaling the volume VSB with A · φc, we obtain V̄SB = 23 L̄
3
B,

where LB has been normalised with φc. An expression of the normalised

bubble length can be obtained by assuming that the sphere has the same

volume than the average bubble volume given by Eq. 12:

L̄B =

(
3 L̄L

2
·
USG
USL

)1/3
(14)

In the saturation regime we obtain the normalised bubble length in the

bubble flow regime is given by:

L̄B = 1.28

(
USG
USL

)1/3
(15)

Garstecki et al. (2006) provided a simple scaling law for the bubble length

that can be written as:

LB
w

= 1 + C
USG
USL

(16)

where w is the width of their rectangular channel (assumed as φc for

cylindrical channels) and C is a fitting parameter of order one that depends

on the particular geometry of the T-junction. Eq. 16 predicts the bubble

length in the squeezing regime and consequently it assumes that, even in

the case USG/USL � 1, the tip of the merging gas blocks almost the entire

17



cross-section of the main channel, obstructing the flow of the liquid. As a

consequence, the expected minimum bubble length is L̄B ≈ 1. The exper-
iments analysed here are not governed by the squeezing mechanism alone

since an effect due to the liquid shear stress is also present (see section 3).

As the shear stress becomes more important, the breakup point moves down-

stream the T-junction and the gas blocks only partially the liquid channel

producing bubbles smaller than the capillary diameter (see Fig. 4-(a)). This

explains the disagreement between Eqs. 14 and 16, which becomes larger as

the shearing effect increases and bubbles become smaller than the capillary

diameter.

In the slug flow regime and for large bubbles, the bubble length is larger

than the capillary diameter, thus the bubble shape is strongly affected by

the capillary. In the case of large bubbles (bubble length greater than ap-

proximately three times the capillary diameter), experimental observations

show that the bubble shape can be approximated by a cylinder of length LB

and cross-sectional area AG, with AG < A. Fig. 9 shows a bubble of length

six times larger than the capillary diameter (right). The shape of smaller

bubbles in the slug flow is not cylindrical anymore, containing longitudinal,

frontal, and rear deformations due to the liquid drag and gas inertial forces.

Fig. 9 shows a bubble of length smaller than two times the capillary diameter

(left). Fig. 10 sketches a comparison between the cylindrical shape (left) and

a more realistic contour (right) for these smaller bubbles. The approxima-

tion of cylindrical shape is expected to be more accurate as the bubble length

increases.

The volume of a cylindrical bubble is given by VCB = AG·LB. Normalising
it by A · φc, we obtain:

V̄CB = αB · L̄B, (17)

where αB = AG/A is the cross-sectional void fraction. Applying Eq. 17

and Eq. 12 to the same bubble volume, the normalised bubble length can be

expressed as:

(18)

In order to determine αB, we use an approach to calculate the void frac-

tion distribution coefficient focused on the liquid layer surrounding an elon-

gated bubble (Revellin et al., 2008). A general expression of C0 (Zuber and

19



Findlay, 1969) is integrated at a given time, assuming the void fraction dis-

tribution across the cross-section to be a discontinuous function equal to 1

(gas) or 0 (liquid). As a result, C0 is given by:

C0 =

which, in terms of αB, leads to:

In the slug flow regime, bubbles fill almost entirely the cross-sectional

area (Fig. 9), hence αB � (1−αB). In addition, USG/USL is usually greater
than 1 for the slug flow regime. Thus αB � (1 − αS)USL/USG, and Eq. 20
becomes:

C0 =
1

αB
(21)

The combination of Eq. 21 and Eq. 18 leads to:

L̄B = C0 · L̄L

)
(22)

In the saturation regime, the normalised bubble length in the slug flow

regime is given by:

L̄B = 1.7

(23)

Garstecki et al. (2006) prediction for the normalised bubble length (Eq. 16)

tends to C · USG/USL when USG/USL � 1. This behaviour is in good agree-
ment with Eq. 22, allowing us to identify C as C0·L̄L. This agreement was not
necessarily expected since Eq. 16 is a prediction of the bubble length in the

20



squeezing regimen, whereas Eq. 22 is not restricted to that regime. Moreover,

Eq. 22 is used here for experimental data in the squeezing-shearing transi-

tion regime. However, in this transition regime the effect of the buildup of

the pressure immediately upstream the bubble (squeezing mechanism) and

the shearing effect are present simultaneously and, both effects depend on

QL (hence on USL) (Garstecki et al., 2006). Thus, the total time for bubble

formation in the transition regime, τ , depends mainly on the liquid flow rate

(τ ∝ 1/QL). The volume of the bubble will be proportional to τ times the
growing velocity of the bubble (VB ∝ τQG ∝ QG/QL = USG/USL), which
leads to L̄B ∝ USG/USL, independently of what effect (squeezing of shearing)
is the strongest.

Fig. 11 shows the experimentally measured normalised bubble length as a

function of the ratio of the gas and liquid superficial velocities. The theoret-

ical predictions for L̄B in the bubble (Eq. 15) and slug (Eq. 23) flow regimes

are plotted as well. For USG/USL . 0.3, the experimental data fit to the pre-

diction of spherical shape for the bubble flow regime. In fact, USG/USL = 0.3

corresponds in Eq. 15 to a bubble length smaller than the capillary diameter

(L̄B ≈ 0.85). This result shows that bubbles start to deviate from a spheri-
cal shape when their diameter is smaller than the capillary diameter. Thus,

Eq. 15 is not expected to be accurate for USG/USL > 0.3. For USG/USL � 1,
the experimental values of L̄B fit to the prediction of cylindrical bubbles

provided by Eq. 23, especially when USG/USL & 2. The observable slight

discrepancies between Eq. 23 and the experimental data are a consequence

of considering cylindrical bubbles instead of the more realistic bullet-shaped

ones. In any case, Eq. 23 is proven to be a simple and accurate prediction

for large elongated bubbles in the slug flow regime. Eq. 16 with C = 1.7

is also plotted in Fig. 11. The experimental data agree with Eq. 16 when

USG/USL � 1, but Eq. 16 overpredicts the value of the bubble length when

21



USG/USL � 1.

Fig. 11 shows a region in the range 0.3 . USG/USL . 2 where a transition

between almost spherical bubbles smaller than the capillary diameter and

nearly cylindrical bubbles of diameter larger than the capillary diameter takes

place. A wide variety of irregular oblate and ellipsoidal shapes are adopted by

bubbles in this region (see Fig. 12), which explains why their length cannot

be accurately predicted by Eqs. 15 and 23. However, the length in this region

fits to the following expression:

L̄B = 0.44 + 1.7

and cylindrical geometries. Gravity is directed downwards in the pictures.

Eq. 24 follows the same tendency as Eq. 23 for large values of USG/USL.

Thus, the average deviation of the bubble length from the spherical or cylin-

drical shape in the considered region, regardless of the bubble shape, is given

by the fitting parameter 0.44 of Eq. 24. Eq. 24 expresses a smooth varia-

tion from spherical to cylindrical shape, providing a prediction of the bubble

length in the range 0.3 . USG/USL . 2.

The bubble length can also be expressed in terms of the volume average

void fraction, in a similar manner as it is done with the unit cell length in

Section 4.2. The combination of Eq. 1 and Eq. 14 provides the following

prediction for the bubble flow regime:

Fig. 13 shows the normalised bubble length as a function of the volume

perimental data, being more accurate in the bubble flow regime. In order

to better fit the region of transition from spherical to cylindrical bubbles,

Fig. 13 shows Eq. 24 expressed as a function of α:

L̄B = 0.44 + 1.7

application of Eq. 24 (0.3 . USG/USL . 2).

5. Conclusions

We have presented an experimental analysis of the characteristic lengths

in the bubble and slug flow regimes generated in a capillary T-junction of

1 mm internal diameter. The setup provided the formation of regular trains

of bubbles with small size dispersion in both flow regimes. Most of the

air-distilled water mixture flows studied here were laminar, surface forces

overcame buoyancy forces, and the effects of both the squeezing and shearing

mechanisms were present. The analytical expressions obtained in this work

are applicable to the linear and the saturation regime.

The volume of liquid required to generate and detach a bubble in the

saturation regime was found to be constant, independent of the gas and

liquid flow rates, and equal to 1.09 mm3. The bubble volume was found

to be the volume of liquid times the ratio of the gas-liquid superficial ve-

locities. The unit cell and the bubble lengths, being a consequence of the

balance between the gas and liquid flow rates, were expressed as a function

of the ratio of the gas and liquid superficial velocities. Both characteristic

lengths were also expressed as a function of the volume average void fraction.

Bubbles were considered as spherical or cylindrical in the bubble and slug

flow regimes, respectively. This assumption led to different predictions for

the bubble length depending on the regime. The effect of the liquid shear

stress was found to generate bubbles with a diameter smaller than the cap-

illary diameter. Therefore, the prediction of the bubble length in the bubble

flow regime (USG/USL . 0.3) disagreed with the scaling law proposed by

Garstecki et al. (2006) in which the bubble size is never smaller than the

channel width (squeezing mechanism). However, the prediction of the bub-

ble length in the slug flow regime (USG/USL & 2) unexpectedly agreed with

Garstecki’s scaling law, even if in our experiments the shearing stress starts

to become dominant over the interfacial effect. An additional prediction for

25



the bubble length provided a smooth variation from spherical to cylindrical

shape in the range 0.3 . USG/USL . 2.

The expressions provided here for the bubble volume, the unit cell and

bubble lengths are particularly interesting, as well as easy to work with, since

the gas and liquid volume flow rates (and hence the gas and liquid superficial

velocities) are commonly available experimental data.
