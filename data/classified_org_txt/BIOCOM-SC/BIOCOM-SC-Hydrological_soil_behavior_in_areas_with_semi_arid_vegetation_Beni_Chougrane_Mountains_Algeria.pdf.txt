Abstract 21 

In northern Algeria, the physical degradation of land by water erosion is one of the most serious 22 

forms of degradation. As is well known, vegetation plays an important role against water 23 

erosion. In the mentioned area the potential vegetation called maquis is currently characterized 24 

by an advanced stated of degradation, often ranging between sparse cover and bare soil. In the 25 

Oued Fergoug watershed belonging to the Beni Chougrane Mountains (NW of Algeria), a trial 26

was carried out with a mini rainfall simulator designed by ORSTOM to evaluate the runoff rate 27 

and the sediment load at experimental plot scale and in a situation of bare soil. The experimental 28 

layout took into account two different surface slopes, three different rainfall intensities, and 29 

three levels of initial soil water content. The highest runoff values observed exceeded 0.50 mm 30 

min-1 and the maximum sediment load yield was 94.2 g L-1 per square meter. Summarizing, the 31 

intensity of rain is the main factor for runoff generation, independently of the slope and the 32 

initial soil water content values. Since vegetation cover is a crucial component in maintaining 33 

stable slopes and limiting soil losses, the most effective practice to protect bare soil against 34 

erosion is to provide a protective ground plant cover in this area.  35

Introduction 40 

Land degradation is recognized as the main outcome of desertification (Puigdefabregas et al. 41 

2009). In particular, the mentioned authors highlight the importance of hydrological ratios, 42 

energy ratios, biomass, productivity and spatial patterns between the ecosystem attributes 43 

associated with land condition. Ecosystem degradation notably entails the incapacity to 44 

preserve, use and recycle local resources such as water, energy and nutrients. Koulouri & 45 

Giourga (2007) consider land abandonment and slope gradient as key factors for soil erosion in 46 

the Mediterranean region. In northern Algeria, the physical degradation of land due to water 47 

erosion is one of the most serious forms of degradation (Souidi et al. 2014).  48 

Soil erosion is a two-phase process consisting of the detachment of individual soil particles 49 

from the soil mass and their transport by erosive agents as surface runoff. Runoff refers to the 50 

portion of rainwater that is not lost due to interception, infiltration, evapotranspiration or surface 51 



3 
 

storage, and flows over the land surface to a stream channel. Interrill erosion is induced by a 52 

moving sheet of water over the soil surface. The rate at which water passes into the soil is 53 

known as the infiltration rate and this exerts a major control over the generation of surface 54 

runoff (Rickson & Morgan 1995). In the case of bare soil, rainfall is distributed between 55 

infiltration and runoff, as direct evaporation is not taken into account. 56 

Vegetation plays an important role against water erosion in two main ways: by preventing loss 57 

of substrate and by favoring sedimentation (Rey et al. 2004). Gray & Sotir (1996) point out the 58 

beneficial effects of herbaceous vegetation in preventing rainfall erosion. Martínez Raya et al. 59 

(2005) observed that plant cover with arbustive species reduced soil loss and runoff about 90% 60 

compared to bare soil. The risk of slope failures and erosion is heightened when the vegetation 61 

cover is removed (Rickson & Morgan 1995). Coppin & Richards (1990) distinguish between 62 

(i) bioengineering, the use of vegetation for slope stabilization and erosion control, and (ii) 63 

biotechnical engineering, techniques where vegetation is combined with inert structures, in 64 

which the engineering role of the vegetation is accentuated.  65 

Among the various factors for controlling soil erosion related with the vegetation cover, the 66 

growth of the roots and their persistence play a significant role in semi-arid areas (Himmelbauer 67 

et al. 2013). Coppin & Richards (1990) underline the engineering role of vegetation and 68 

particularize water uptake by roots, reinforcement of soil by roots, and anchoring and 69 

buttressing by taproots. 70 

Rainfall simulation, used for many years, is still one of the most used and most successful tools 71 

to study soil erosion by water (Martínez-Murillo et al. 2013).  72 

One application of a rainfall simulator in Algeria concluded that soil tillage on marls in a semi-73 

arid condition could be an excellent tool to diminish runoff and control soil erosion (Prinz et al. 74 

1994).  75 



4 
 

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to characterize the runoff and sediment load yield 76 

on bare soils of a region located in Beni Chougrane Mountains (one of the most erodible 77 

countries in the world) by means of small-scale rainfall simulation. This information would be 78 

useful to assess future restoration projects using vegetation for the area understudied.  79 

Material and methods 80 

The experiment was carried out in the Oued Fergoug watershed (122 km2) in the Beni 81 

Chougrane Mountains (NW of Algeria). This area forms part of the great Oran-Chott Chergui 82 

watershed belonging to the Oran Tell, which in turn covers an area of 2860 km2. The UTM 83 

coordinates of the mouth of Oued Fergoug are: 31S 232440 mE 39394850 mN.  84 

Average monthly temperatures (series from 1993 to 2012) show two different seasons: a cold 85 

season (from November to April) with an absolute minimum of 3°C recorded in January, and a 86 

hot season (from May to October). The absolute maximum temperature in this period was 41°C 87 

(August). Average annual rainfall at three stations located around the study area- Mascara, Ain 88 

Farès and Bouhanifia- were 402, 428 and 281 mm respectively. The maximum and minimum 89 

mean monthly rainfalls recorded between 1980 and 2000 were 62.8 mm (December) and 2.4 90 

mm (August). The rainfall distribution throughout the year is highly variable and it is 91 

concentrated during the cold season (Bouchetata & Bouchetata 2006). It should be noted that 92 

the rainiest season is between October and December and the wettest months are December and 93 

January. Rainfall intensity is also very variable and heavy rainfalls occur from late November 94 

to February, but secondary maximums are obtained in September or October and in April or 95 

May. Extreme values of rainfall intensity reach 900 mm h-1 (December or January) for periods 96 

of 5 to 10 minutes. 97 

The Beni Chougrane Mountains are characterized by an extremely abrupt relief (peaks from 98 

300 to 800 m) and large hills alternate with high plateaus and deep valleys. Slopes are very 99 



5 
 

variable. Nearly 20% of the soil surface has a slope of more than 50%, and 26% of the soil 100 

surface has a slope of between 25% and 12.5%.  101 

The soils of the experimental area are developed on marl and sandstone and colluviums. 102 

Climatic aridity and soil erosion prevent soil development and poorly developed soils are 103 

common. Very often the soils retain characteristics of the bedrock. Inceptisols and entisols are 104 

the main soil orders in the region. Analytical data of the topsoil in the experimental area show 105 

60.2% clay, 22.1% fine silt, 7.5% coarse silt, 5.5% fine sand, 3.1% coarse sand, and 1.7% 106 

organic matter. Calcium carbonate is present in large proportions. 107 

In accordance with the semi-arid Mediterranean bioclimate of the area, the maximum 108 

expression of the potential vegetation in the area is a particular maquis dominated by Callitris 109 

articulata (Vahl.) Link. (called thuya de Barbarie in French). This is a scrubland or shrubland 110 

of greater or lesser density depending on the conditions, with the presence of a diverse 111 

assortment of plant species sharing the common physical characteristic of dominance by shrubs 112 

(Olea europaea L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Calycotome spinosa (L.) Lamk., Artemisia 113 

herba-alba Asso, etc.). Evergreen oak (Quercus ilex L.) and pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) 114 

forests can appear in some specific sites forming sparse stands (Zahira et al. 2009; Haddouche 115 

et al. 2011; Tayeb & Kheloufi 2014).  116 

In most of the area, due to several causes (erosion, fire and overgrazing), the vegetation is 117 

characterized by an advanced state of degradation. At best a sparse vegetation cover is observed 118 

and surfaces with bare soil in higher areas are common. In particular, we can see the rapid 119 

progress of land degradation by comparing the map provided by Benchetrit (1966) showing the 120 

situation of the vegetation of the Beni Chougrane area in 1953 (the author used a legend with 8 121 

categories: forest, degraded forest, maquis, scrublike matorral or garrigue, vineyards, European 122 

crops, Algerian crops, and bare soil) with the information obtained by remote sensing (Zahira 123 

et al. 2009; Haddouche et al. 2011; Tayeb & Kheloufi 2014). Nowadays Beni Chougrane is 124 



6 
 

included in the southern edge of the olive-growing area (Zdruli 2014), and is considered a good 125 

grazing area (FAO 2005). 126 

A mini rainfall simulator designed by ORSTOM (Asseline 1981; Casenave 1982) was used in 127 

this experiment. A total of 18 rainfall simulations were carried out on regular square plots of 1 128 

m2. An adjustable lever system made it possible to vary the oscillation angle of the nozzle and 129 

the wet the surface of the soil. Consequently, the rainfall intensity in the plot ranged from 30 to 130 

150 mm h-1. The nozzle was supplied with water at constant pressure. It produced a flat stream 131 

of water in a fan shape.  132 

An experimental area located on the same parent material, with similar soils and covers (bare 133 

soil), was selected on two different surface slopes. Nine plots were established in each area, 134 

distributed in a 3 by 3 matrix of plots, with the three different rainfall intensities, and three 135 

levels of initial soil water content (Table 1). Water runoff and sediment load were measured 136 

with a test tube at 1 minute intervals. Each rainfall simulation experiment was carried out until 137 

10 consecutive sediment samples were collected. The length of the simulations ranged between 138 

15 (moister plots) and 108 (dry plots) minutes. 139 

The statistical analysis of data was first conducted using a set of exploratory techniques to 140 

investigate the relationship between time, runoffs and sediment loads of various groups of data 141 

according to the combinations of the three factors considered (Table 1). Row data and 142 

transformations of the data by logarithm function were investigated. Regression models were 143 

performed with the sediment load as the response variable to explain or predict, the runoff as a 144 

continuous predictor and the three factors as categorical predictors, jointly with their 145 

interactions. In order to establish comparisons between the runoffs when the stabilization took 146 

place, data were analyzed grouped into subsets according to the factors described above. 147 

General linear models (GLM) and variance tests (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the influence 148 

of the three factors (surface slope, initial soil water content and rain intensity) and their 149 



7 
 

interaction on the final stabilized runoff. In order to complete this data analysis, and taking into 150 

account the variability of the data and the small sample sizes, a nonparametric alternative to a 151 

one-way ANOVA, the Kruskal-Wallis test, was also used to rank data values. The separation 152 

of means was evaluated using the Tukey-Kramer procedure and Games-Howell pairwise 153 

comparisons. Data were analyzed using Minitab software (2007). The probability level of 154 

significance was set at 0.05. 155 

 156 

Results and discussion 157 

Fig. 1 shows the results of the evolution of the runoff (mm min-1) in the course of the experiment 158 

for the 18 simulations carried out. In the initial dry soil condition, water infiltrated across the 159 

soil surface and no runoff was observed independently of slope. Then the runoff rate stabilized 160 

(a maximum runoff rate was reached) over time. However, runoff acquired rising importance 161 

from the beginning of the simulation under more intense rainfall (RI-50 and RI-80). Runoff in 162 

moister soils (FC and SAT) started from the first moments of the simulation and increased until 163 

a stable rate was achieved. This maximum runoff rate was not assumed conclusively in the most 164 

favorable set of conditions to erosion (RI-50 or RI-80 and 25% slope), but we can consider the 165 

runoff values to be very near to stability. 166 

Fig. 2 depicts the relationships between stable runoff rate (mm h-1) and sediment load yield (g 167 

L-1) per square meter. This figure shows that when the soil is dry (DS) the sediment load 168 

concentration does not increase when maximum runoff increases; our interpretation of this is 169 

that the soil mass susceptible to erosion tends to be exhausted during the experiment. This does 170 

not mean that the total (per square meter) quantity of sediment exported was the same over both 171 

slopes (12.5% and 25%). A similar behavior can be observed in the case of the rainfall 172 

simulations with RI-30 mm h-1. In this case the largest quantity of exported soil (in terms of 173 

sediment load yield) would correspond to dry soil (DS). In other combinations of factors, the 174 



8 
 

regression model suggests that the maximum concentration of sediment exported was not 175 

reached. When the intensity of rainfall is maximum, the behavior varies according to slope. An 176 

overall view of all the graphs suggests a complex relationship between these variables, possibly 177 

related to the energy balance (Chaplot & Le Bissonnais 2003). The maximum value of sediment 178 

load yield, which reached 94.2 g L-1 m-2, was generated by interrill erosion. The stable 179 

(maximum) runoff values obtained with the rainfall simulator should be considered only as 180 

indicative of soil behavior in actual field conditions, among other reasons due to the large 181 

variety of simulators that can be used (Martínez-Murillo et al. 2013) and the wide variety of 182 

environmental factors that may be involved (Casenave 1982). Consequently, the interpretation 183 

should be considered in relative terms and in relation to the trends suggested by the results. 184 

Table 2 shows the maximum runoff values of the 18 treatments arranged in descending order 185 

and significant differences have been stated for medians and means with the two statistical tests 186 

(Kruskal-Wallis and one-way ANOVA tests).  187 

In each of the three data sets corresponding to each level of initial soil conditions, for the 188 

stabilized runoff variable, the two-way ANOVA tests performed with the factors slope and rain 189 

intensity revealed that their interaction was significant (the three p-values < 0.01). For the three 190 

initial soil conditions, according to the Tukey-Kramer procedure, the higher means of runoff 191 

corresponding to the combinations 25%_RI-80 and 12.5%_RI-80 were significantly different, 192 

but no significant differences were detected between the pairs 12.5%_RI-50 and 25%_RI-50, 193 

or between 12.5%_RI-30 and 25%_RI-30. In turn, for each data set corresponding to the 194 

different levels of rain intensity, the two-way ANOVA tests carried out with the factors slope 195 

and initial soil water content for the runoff variable showed that the interaction of these two 196 

factors was not significant (p-values of 0.599, 0.755 and 0.825 for RI-30, RI-50 and RI-80 197 

respectively). Thus, the two main factors, the slope and the initial soil water content- showed 198 

an additive effect on runoff. Both factors were significant in each of the three rain intensities 199 



9 
 

(all p-values<0.01). According to the Tukey-Kramer procedure, in the case of the lowest rain 200 

intensity no significant difference was detected for the means corresponding to FC and DS, 201 

while for the other two rain intensities no significant differences were detected between the 202 

means of FC and SAT. 203 

The results conclusively showed that the rainfall intensity is the main factor for runoff 204 

generation independently of slope value and initial soil water content. Both slope value and 205 

initial soil water content are factors that are uncontrollable by man, but their geographical 206 

distributions are usually known on different scales. The maximum concentration of sediment 207 

load yield tends to decrease with time over shallowly sloping surfaces and when rainfall 208 

intensity is low. In other cases the sediment load yield can increase with time. This suggests 209 

that it is necessary to protect the soil surface under any conditions of slope and initial moisture 210 

level in areas with more intense rainfall (> 80 mm h-1). The most effective practice for 211 

protecting the soil against erosion is to implement an adequate vegetal cover, because 212 

vegetation is a critical component in maintaining stable slopes and thus limiting erosion.  213 

The importance of the soil surface protective (vegetation) cover is well known. Subsequently, 214 

more field research and acquired knowledge would be necessary to design a detailed project for 215 

the bare soil areas in the Beni Chougrane Mountains favoring long-term restoration of 216 

spontaneous vegetation. The different factors involved in this land degradation and the present 217 

success of some bioengineering techniques to obtain ground cover vegetation should be taken 218 

into account in this context. Moreover, rainfall simulations would be an adequate technique to 219 

evaluate the abovementioned restoration work. 220
