Abstract

A novel algorithm to reconstruct neutrino-induced particle show-
ers within the ANTARES neutrino telescope is presented. The method
achieves a median angular resolution of 6◦ for shower energies below
100TeV. Applying this algorithm to 6 years of data taken with the AN-
TARES detector, 8 events with reconstructed shower energies above
10TeV are observed. This is consistent with the expectation of about
5 events from atmospheric backgrounds, but also compatible with dif-
fuse astrophysical flux measurements by the IceCube collaboration, from
which 2 – 4 additional events are expected. A 90 % C.L. upper limit on
the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux with a value per neutrino flavour
of E2 · Φ90% = 4.9 · 10−8 GeV · cm−2 · s−1 · sr−1 is set, applicable to
the energy range from 23TeV to 7.8 PeV, assuming an unbroken E−2

spectrum and neutrino flavour equipartition at Earth.

1 Introduction

With the discovery of a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux by the IceCube
observatory located in the deep Antarctic ice, high-energy neutrino astronomy
has reported its first observation [1–3]. The extraterrestrial origin of the flux
has been established with high significance [4–6]. Although the sources of
these high-energy neutrinos have not yet been pinned down, it is expected
that their identification will help to elucidate the sites and mechanisms of
baryonic acceleration, and will play a key role in the discovery of the sources
of Galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays.

In neutrino telescopes in ice or water, a charged-current (CC) interac-
tion of a νµ or νµ (in the following abbreviated to ↪ ↩νµ) inside or around the
instrumented volume creates a relativistic muon whose long trajectory can,
depending on its energy, cross the entire detector and be detected by photo-
multipliers (PMTs) through the induced Cherenkov light emission. The event
signature due to neutral-current (NC), and ↪ ↩νe and ↪ ↩ντ CC interactions inside
or close to the instrumented volume is however a particle shower1 (also often
referred to as a shower-like or cascade event) with a characteristic longitu-
dinal extension of a few meters that increases logarithmically with energy.

1with the exception of about 17% of tau leptons decaying to muons that appear as
track-like events [7].

The particle shower constitutes a Cherenkov light source which appears lo-
calised compared to the typical distances between photosensors in neutrino
telescopes. This light emission characteristic offers the opportunity to es-
timate the energy released in a neutrino-induced shower more reliably than
that of muons, while the direction determination is more difficult and generally
results in a worse angular resolution.

A high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux has been observed and char-
acterised in several different analyses by IceCube. The high-energy starting
event analysis identifies neutrino-interaction vertices of all flavours contained
in the detector volume. In 4 years of data taking, it has observed 54 events
from the entire sky, of which 39 have been identified as shower-like with a
typical directional resolution of about 15◦ [5]. A best-fit spectral index of Γ =
2.58±0.25 is obtained, assuming a power-law flux model dNν/dEν = Φ0E−Γ .
The flux normalisation at 100TeV of Φ0 = 2.2× 10−8GeV · cm−2 · s−1 · sr−1
is valid per neutrino flavour, and for neutrinos yielding a deposited energy
between 60TeV and 3PeV. Recently, a complementary measurement of an
astrophysical neutrino flux has been achieved using only CC muon neutrino
events from the Northern sky. Using 6 years of data, an astrophysical flux
with a hard spectral index of Γ = 2.13± 0.13 and a normalisation at 100TeV
of Φ0 = 0.9 × 10−8GeV · cm−2 · s−1 · sr−1 has been found for neutrino en-
ergies above roughly 200TeV [6]. This result shows a 3.3σ tension with
the normalisation value and soft spectral index obtained in a fit combining
different previous IceCube analyses with mainly lower energy thresholds [8],
which could be indicative of a spectral break [6]. The measurements indicate
that a substantial fraction of the flux must be of extragalactic origin, while a
Galactic contribution could be the reason for the observed tension. Exploit-
ing the limited statistics of the available astrophysical neutrino sample, first
indications have been put forward that the observed flux is anisotropic, being
slightly stronger and exhibiting a softer spectrum in the region of the Galaxy
in the Southern sky [9, 10]. The νe : νµ : ντ ratio is compatible with 1:1:1
[8], consistent with expectations from charged meson decays in cosmic-ray
accelerators and 3-flavour neutrino mixing. Dedicated searches for small-
scale anisotropies in neutrino arrival directions and for spatial correlations
with known astrophysical sources have not revealed statistically significant
deviations from the isotropy hypothesis [11–14].

Given the tensions and uncertainties in the observations by IceCube, it is

4



important to provide additional measurements and complementary sky cov-
erage in the track-like muon neutrino and in the shower-like all-flavour event
channels. ANTARES is a neutrino telescope located in the Northern Hemi-
sphere which, despite having a significantly smaller volume than IceCube, has
a comparable muon neutrino effective area at TeV energies for observations of
the Southern sky [12]. ANTARES data have been used to set constraints on,
e.g., the all-sky diffuse muon neutrino flux [15, 16], the strength of a possible
Galactic component of the flux discovered by IceCube [17], and the possi-
ble neutrino flux from the region of the Galactic Ridge [18]. Furthermore,
several searches for clustering and large-scale anisotropies in the neutrino ar-
rival directions, as well as for temporal and/or spatial correlations with known
astrophysical sources have been carried out [19–22].

This paper presents a reconstruction algorithm for neutrino-induced par-
ticle shower events and reports on the first application of such an algorithm
to ANTARES data. The reconstruction method has been employed to search
for a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux using 6 years of data collected from
2007 to 2012. The ANTARES detector is described in Sec. 2. The detector
simulation and the developed algorithm are presented in Sec. 3 and Sec. 4, re-
spectively. The data selection is discussed in Sec. 5, while the analysis method
and the discussion of systematic uncertainties can be found in Sec. 6.

The results of the search are reported in Sec. 7, while Sec. 8 summarizes
and concludes the paper. The presented work is used as input to more ad-
vanced reconstruction algorithms based on updated simulations which are in
development [23].

2 The ANTARES neutrino telescope

The ANTARES neutrino telescope [24] is located in the Mediterranean Sea
about 40 km offshore from Toulon in a depth of about 2500m, and comprises
a three-dimensional array of 885 PMTs housed inside glass spheres, denoted
as optical modules (OMs) [25]. The OMs are attached to 12 readout cables
(lines), each holding 75 of these arranged in groups of three on 25 storeys2.
The vertical spacing between storeys is 14.5m, while the horizontal spacing

2The 12th line holds only 20 storeys with OMs. The remaining storeys house a test
system for acoustic neutrino detection [26].

5



between lines deployed in an approximately octagonal configuration is about
60m on average. The detector instruments a water mass of roughly 20Mt,
but can be sensitive to neutrino interaction events outside of this volume,
depending on the distance of the neutrino interaction point (vertex) to this
volume, the neutrino direction and the event light yield. ANTARES is mainly
sensitive to neutrinos of TeV to PeV energies, with a threshold for astrophys-
ical studies of roughly 100 GeV.

If the analogue output signal of a PMT reaches an amplitude correspond-
ing to a charge above a tunable threshold of typically 0.3 photoelectrons (pe),
the signal time and charge are digitised, and this pair of values is denoted as
a “hit” [27]. Events are selected by different triggering algorithms [28] that
causally connect hits in time and space. The achieved resolutions on the ar-
rival time of photons at the PMTs, measured with nanosecond precision [29],
and on the position and orientation of the OMs [30], as well as the low pho-
ton scattering probability in seawater [31], allow for the reconstruction of
the triggered events with excellent angular resolution for muon neutrino CC
events [32].

Two different types of backgrounds have to be taken into account in the
event reconstruction algorithms and in the search for high-energy astrophysi-
cal neutrinos. The time variable photon emission by deep-sea bioluminescent
organisms and Cherenkov photons induced by electrons from beta decays of
radioactive potassium (40K) add PMT hits unrelated to those caused by the
detection of Cherenkov photons from the passage of relativistic particles. The
second type of background consists of events that are induced by atmospheric
neutrinos and muons produced in interactions of cosmic rays with the Earth’s
atmosphere. Using the Earth as a shield against the atmospheric muon back-
ground, upward-going neutrinos are observed that predominantly originate
from the Southern sky due to the geographical location of the telescope.

Individual upward-going atmospheric neutrinos are indistinguishable from
neutrinos of astrophysical origin, unless observed in temporal and/or spatial
coincidence with other cosmic messengers [33, 34].

3 Simulation of signal and background

For the development of the shower reconstruction algorithm and for the op-
timisation of the diffuse neutrino flux search, detailed Monte-Carlo (MC)

6



simulations of the detector response to both signal and background events
are used [35, 36].

Some of the deep-sea environmental conditions typically change on a time-
scale of a few hours. In particular, the optical background rates, which are
measured for each OM individually, can show significant variations with time,
and are of relevance for the data acquisition and the detector efficiency. In
order to take these variations into account, each data-taking period of a
few hours (denoted as a run) is simulated individually [37]. The background
is generated according to the measured rates on each active OM, which
are determined with a sampling frequency of roughly 10Hz. Additionally,
PMT individual charge calibrations and effective thresholds are used, and the
simulated hit time and charge is smeared. Finally, the simulated events are
processed with the same trigger algorithms active during data acquisition.

The generation of ↪ ↩νµ and ↪ ↩νe neutrino interactions is performed using the
LEPTO [38] package for deep inelastic scattering processes and RSQ [39] for
resonant and quasi-elastic processes using the CTEQ6-DIS [40] parton distri-
bution functions. The hadronisation is performed using PYTHIA / JETSET
[41]. Interactions of ↪ ↩ντ are not simulated and their contribution is estimated
differently, as discussed in Sec. 6. In order to obtain sufficient statistics at
high energies, the ↪ ↩νe and ↪ ↩νµ events are generated with a hard E−1.4 spec-
trum. A reweighting procedure is employed to simulate different astrophysical
and atmospheric neutrino flux models from the generated events.

The generation of atmospheric muon events uses the MUPAGE [42, 43]
package. The propagation of muons in water is achieved with MUSIC [44].
For muon events, no reweighting procedure is used, but an integrated flux
corresponding to one third of the data-taking livetime is generated.

For hadronic showers induced by neutrinos with an energy below 100 TeV,
each particle generated in the interaction and its corresponding light emission
is simulated with GEANT 3.21 [45]. Electromagnetic showers and their pho-
ton emission are generated using parametrisations and precomputed probabil-
ity tables. For neutrino events with energies above 100 TeV, hadronic showers
are simulated using a one-particle approach, i.e. all hadrons are replaced with
an equivalent electron whose energy is determined from that of the hadrons
by an appropriate weighting scheme.

In order to keep the computational cost of the simulation manageable, two
additional simplifications are introduced. For photons generated in particle

7



showers, scattering processes are not taken into account, and for ↪ ↩νµ CC
events with Eν > 100TeV, Cherenkov photon emission from the hadronic
vertex shower is not simulated. Both simplifications are taken into account in
the analysis by corrections and corresponding systematic uncertainties, which
are derived from dedicated simulations and discussed in Sec. 6.

4 Shower event reconstruction

For the selection and reconstruction of triggered events that contain a shower,
a dedicated maximum-likelihood-based reconstruction algorithm has been de-
veloped. It allows for the estimation of the shower energy, of the interaction
point and time, and of the direction of the incoming neutrino.

In a pre-fit step, the shower position and time are roughly estimated. To
this end, hits caused mainly by unscattered light are selected by considering
only the earliest hit on each OM. A χ2-fit scanning for the time and position of
the shower is done assuming a spherical light source, and using only OMs on
storeys with at least two hits within 20 ns. As optical background processes,
such as 40K decays or bioluminescence, induce mainly single photoelectron
hits, restricting the hit selection to coincidences with a charge exceeding
1.2 pe per hit ensures that this pre-fit is performed on a sample dominated
by signal hits. This signal hit selection has been developed with dedicated
simulations including scattering for photons induced by shower particles, and
has been verified by comparing measured and simulated hit time distributions.

In the next step, a new hit selection takes into account all hits in the
event again. Hits are selected if their distance to at least one storey with
coincident hits or to the shower position estimated in the previous step is
lower than 50 m. Additionally, the hit time must be in a range of ±80 ns with
respect to the arrival time expectation assuming isotropic photon emission
at the estimated shower position. The chosen value of the distance criterion
corresponds roughly to the seawater absorption length [46] and prevents far-
away background hits that coincidentally fit to the isotropic light emission
hypothesis from being falsely selected. If this procedure finds fewer than 5
hits in total or hits on less than 3 lines, the event is discarded. The remaining
contamination from noise-induced hits has been estimated to be about 1%.

Refining the results of the pre-fit and based on this second hit selection,
the parameters of the shower are determined with two consecutive maximum-

8



likelihood fits. Both fits make use of precomputed probability tables that
have been obtained using the detailed MC simulations described in Sec. 3.
The first maximum-likelihood fit determines the position and time of the
shower. It varies these shower parameters and evaluates the precomputed
probability for each selected hit, given its time and position, to be due to
Cherenkov photons emitted at the assumed shower time and position. The
second fit determines the direction of the incoming neutrino and the energy
of the particle shower resulting from the neutrino interaction, while fixing
the start time and position of the shower to the values found by the first
fit. This factorisation of the fitting procedure is possible due to the large
scattering length of seawater and due to the homogeneity of the medium,
which allows for the position reconstruction of the maximum shower light yield
independent of the shower direction3. This second fit is based on precomputed
and tabulated probabilities for hits to be due to Cherenkov photons emitted
in a particle shower with given energy, time and position, and induced by a
neutrino with given direction. The three-dimensional probability table depends
on the photon emission angle, the total photon yield emitted by the shower,
and the energy of the shower. The photon emission angle is defined as the
angle between the direction of the incoming neutrino and a straight line from
the shower position to the hit OM. The shower charge cshower, in units of
photoelectrons and with typical values of about 108 pe for 10TeV shower
energy, is used as a proxy for the total light yield from the shower and is
defined as cshower = chit · e

λw · 1

· 4πd

, where chit is the measured charge of

the hit with a maximum value of about 25 pe, λw is the attenuation length
of seawater [31] and α is the incidence-angle-dependent photon-detection
probability of an OM. The last factor relates the OM cross-section AOM [25]
to the total surface of a sphere defined by the radial distance d of the shower
position to the OM. The definition of the parameter cshower was chosen to
make the shower energy estimate approximately independent of the detected
light yield, allowing for the reconstruction of events in which the emitted light
partly escapes the sensitive volume of the detector.

In the search for astrophysical neutrinos described later, a quality cut on
the likelihood of the vertex fit (vertex-quality cut) is applied. It aims at
optimising the signal to background ratio by efficiently selecting neutrino-
induced shower events while vetoing atmospheric muons. Applying this cut

yields a 3 (6)m median position resolution for the neutrino interaction vertex
for events with a MC shower energy of 100 GeV (1 PeV). In particular, for
high shower energies, this resolution is dominated by the distance between the
interaction vertex and the position of the shower light yield maximum. The
MC shower energy is defined by the fraction of the neutrino energy deposited
at the vertex, thus contributing to the shower light yield. For ↪ ↩νe CC events,
it is equivalent to the neutrino energy, while it is lower by the energy of the
escaping neutrino for NC events.

The distribution of the angular error on the neutrino direction in Fig. 1
(left) shows a median value of about 6◦ for shower energies up to 100 TeV, and
worsens to about 25◦ (40◦) at 1 PeV (10 PeV). This is a consequence of the
stronger light yield at higher energies that saturates the detector and increas-
ingly impedes the efficient recognition of the emission direction of Cherenkov
light from the shower particles.

again as a consequence of the light yield saturating the detector.

The effective area for the detection of ↪ ↩νe CC and all-flavour NC events
after applying the vertex-quality cut is depicted as a function of the simulated

for νe corresponds to the Glashow resonance [48]. As shown in Fig. 2 (right),
the fraction of successfully reconstructed events among all triggered shower-
like events increases from 50 % to 90 % as a function of shower energy in the
range from 1 TeV to 3 PeV. Applying the vertex-quality cut, roughly 10 %

angle error of about 7◦. Further details can be found in Ref. [49].

5 Data selection

The reconstruction algorithm described in the previous section was applied
to data collected from February 2007 to December 2012. This includes the

11



construction and commissioning phase of the detector and therefore several
detector configurations, each comprising a different number of active lines
included in the data taking. All of these configurations have been reproduced
by the detailed run-based simulation procedure described in Sec. 3. The data
analysis was designed blindly, i.e. the neutrino selection criteria have been
developed using the simulations only. A fraction of 10% of the data runs
(test data), sampled from the full data collection time range, was compared
to simulations to validate the selection criteria. These test data were excluded
from the neutrino search described in Sec. 6. Simulation studies, as well as
a comparison to the test data, did not reveal any significant influence of
the time-variable optical background rates on the performance of the shower
reconstruction strategy presented in Sec. 4. This is to be expected, as the
typical optical background rates in the ANTARES detector are of the order
of 50 kHz to 80 kHz per PMT, while even for extreme and rare conditions of
several hundred kHz, the probability of any given PMT having a background
hit in ±80 ns is of the order of a few percent.

Active PMTs have been observed to occasionally produce a flash of light
inside OMs, and photons from this flash are detected by other PMTs in the
vicinity. This phenomenon is rare, with only a few occurrences over the whole
data-taking period. Runs that have been identified to contain at least one
flashing PMT were excluded from the analysis. In order to further suppress
this background, events were vetoed if the shower position is reconstructed
closer than 15m to any of the OMs. This cut (discharge cut), which reduces
the sensitive volume within the instrumented detector by about 30%, was
chosen conservatively after a dedicated analysis of events with flashing PMTs.
Note that this cut is not included in the effective area shown in Fig. 2 (left).

Removing the 10% test data, a total effective data-acquisition livetime
of 1247 days is included in the analysis.

6 Analysis method and systematic uncertainties

The presented analysis used 6 years of ANTARES data to search for an excess
over the atmospheric background of upward-going astrophysical neutrinos
inducing high-energy showering events.

The method is complementary to the first searches for a diffuse neutrino
flux performed with ANTARES [15, 16], which selected only the track-like

12



event signatures of upward-going muons induced by ↪ ↩νµ CC interactions. Even
though NC interactions of atmospheric ↪ ↩νµ contribute to the background for
the presented search, the small value of the ratio of atmospheric ↪ ↩νe to ↪ ↩νµ
fluxes at TeV energies [54] reduces the overall background compared to the
earlier analyses.

We treat the search for astrophysical neutrinos as a simple counting exper-
iment, and derive confidence intervals using the unified approach of Feldman
and Cousins [51]. We optimise the selection criteria for the best upper limit,
also known as model rejection factor (MRF) optimisation [50].

Requiring successfully reconstructed shower-like events with hits on at
least 3 lines, which survive the vertex-quality (cf. Sec. 4) and the discharge
cut (cf. Sec. 5), reduces the atmospheric muon background in the simulated
event sample down to about 1000 events, and about 100 (10) atmospheric
(cosmic) neutrinos remain in the sample.

Selecting only upward-going shower events by cutting on their recon-
structed zenith angle, Θrec = 0◦ defines vertically down-going while Θrec =
180◦ is straight up-going, reduces this contamination further by a factor of
about 50. Cutting on the reconstructed shower energy, Erec, in principle allows
for the discrimination of astrophysical and atmospheric neutrino contributions
to the flux, since the energy spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos is expected
to be harder than that of atmospheric neutrinos.

The MRF is minimised for a neutrino energy spectrum with spectral index
Γ = 2.0 by varying Erec and Θrec, and the optimum is obtained for Erec ≥
10TeV and Θrec ≥ 94◦. It is found that this cut combination vetoes the last
simulated atmospheric muon events, and that it is largely independent of the
exact spectral shape of the neutrino signal, in particular for softer spectral
indices. With these cuts applied, the simulations yield an expectation of
1.3 to 2.9 signal events (↪ ↩νe + ↪ ↩νµ) from a diffuse astrophysical flux with
the spectral index and normalisation as reported by IceCube in Ref. [6] and
Ref. [5], respectively.

In the following, all reported event contributions are given for the cut level
after the MRF optimisation. From the simulated atmospheric background,
2.3 events are expected using the Bartol atmospheric neutrino flux model [52]
and 0.3 events from the prompt atmospheric neutrino component. The latter
assumes a flux corresponding to the upper limit determined in Ref. [6], i.e.
50% of the flux predicted in Ref. [53]. As no simulated atmospheric muon

13



remains, the residual contamination of atmospheric muons reconstructed as
upward-going showers is estimated by an extrapolation scheme. The efficiency
of the vertex-quality cut applied on the sample of events that survive the
energy and zenith-angle cut was evaluated as a function of the vertex-quality
cut and was extrapolated to the strict cut value used for the final event
selection. The validity of this extrapolation scheme has been confirmed with
looser cuts on the zenith angle which allowed to compare with the number
of muons remaining in the sample. This yields an estimate on the remaining
atmospheric muon contribution of 1.8 events after the final cuts.

The contribution from astrophysical ↪ ↩ντ was estimated assuming flavour
equipartition at Earth for the astrophysical neutrino signal. In the NC channel,
↪ ↩ντ interactions are assumed to create showers identical to those of ↪ ↩νµ and
↪ ↩νe interactions. The contribution of ↪ ↩ντ CC interactions was estimated from
the ↪ ↩νe channel, taking into account that a fraction of 82.6 % of all created
τ± leptons will give rise to particle showers through their decay. This proce-
dure estimates a total astrophysical ↪ ↩ντ contribution of 0.5 to 1.2 events for
the fluxes in Ref. [6] and Ref. [5], with an uncertainty of about 30%, taking
into account that the τ± track length before decay exceeds the median ver-
tex resolution of the presented reconstruction for τ± energies above roughly
100 TeV, and can thus affect the shower fit. The contribution of prompt
atmospheric ↪ ↩ντ is negligible [53].

For ↪ ↩νµ CC events with Eν > 100TeV, photon emission from the hadronic
vertex shower has not been simulated, cf. Sec. 3. A dedicated analysis of the
reconstructed energy spectrum of such events for energies above and below
100TeV was used to quantify their additional contribution to the sample of
reconstructed shower events. This estimate yields a small additional contri-
bution of at most 0.3 (0.2) events from the astrophysical (atmospheric) ↪ ↩νµ
flux.

The systematic uncertainty on the normalisation of the conventional at-
mospheric neutrino flux was assumed to be ±30 % [54, 55]. The same was
assumed as the relative uncertainty on the number of atmospheric muons.
The parametrisation in Ref. [53] was employed for the prompt atmospheric
neutrino flux which yields on average an uncertainty of +25−40%.

The influence of the uncertainty on the light absorption length and the
scattering length of seawater, and on the average PMT efficiency has been
determined by varying the nominal parameter values in the detector simulation

14



independently by ±10% [56]. The resulting individual uncertainties for the
event detection efficiencies were added in quadrature. The number of simu-
lated events surviving all cuts relevant for the diffuse neutrino flux search, the
assumed uncertainties on the respective fluxes and the detection uncertainties
for the different fluxes are summarised in Tab. 1. Neutrino events generated
according to a hard astrophysical spectrum are on average more energetic
and hence induce a larger number of signal hits in the detector compared to
atmospheric neutrino events, and their respective detection uncertainties are
therefore smaller.

The uncertainty induced by the missing photon scattering in the simulation
of shower events has been investigated by a dedicated simulation including
photon scattering processes. It was found that on average 30 % less shower
events with simulated photon scattering survive the vertex-quality cut, which
is taken into account as a systematic uncertainty on the number of shower
events in the following.

7 Results

Summing up the discussed atmospheric background contributions and cor-
rection estimates (cf. Tab. 1), nb = 4.6

+2.8
−3.0 background events are expected.

For the full dataset of 1247 days, this analysis yields a sensitivity to an astro-
physical neutrino flux of:

E2 · Φ̄90% = 2.2+0.9−0.7 · 10
−8GeV · cm−2 · s−1 · sr−1

per flavour, assuming an unbroken E−2 power law spectrum and flavour equipar-
tition at Earth.

Fig. 3 shows the reconstructed zenith-angle distribution. The cuts dis-
cussed in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 were applied. The measured distribution com-
pares well to the MC expectations from the atmospheric muon and neutrino
backgrounds. The zenith-angle distribution of the atmospheric neutrino back-
ground is asymmetric with respect to the horizon, which results from the
convolution of the assumed atmospheric neutrino flux model [52] and the
detector acceptance.

Applying a cut on the reconstructed zenith angle Θrec ≥ 94◦, as derived
in the MRF optimization procedure, 60 upward-going events remain, while

coincidentally matched to the shower hypothesis. This is a scenario which
is in principle covered by the run-based simulation concept that accounts for
the OM-individual background rates at the time of the data taking. The
remaining 7 events could be verified to have a reconstruction error comparing
well to the resolutions discussed in Sec. 4.

Using Poisson statistics, the observation of 8 events with an expectation
of 4.6 corresponds to an excess with a significance of 1.6σ. This result agrees
with the assumption of a purely atmospheric origin of the observed events,
but it is also compatible with the expectations from the diffuse astrophysical

18



neutrino fluxes as reported by the IceCube collaboration.
Following the Feldman-Cousins approach [51] a 90 % C.L. upper limit on

the number of signal events of µ90% = 9.1 is evaluated from the 8 measured

+2.8
−3.0 expected background events. Systematic uncertainties (in-

cluding that arising from the missing photon scattering in our simulation,
cf. Sec. 6) have been taken into account following the method detailed in
Refs. [57, 58].

The relative uncertainties on the signal and background efficiencies, cal-
culated as the average of their systematic error intervals, are evaluated to
29 % for the astrophysical signal and 42 % for the atmospheric background.
This increases the 90% C.L. upper limit of the confidence interval to 11.4
events. For the unblinded data set of 1247 days, the upper limit on the diffuse
astrophysical neutrino flux per neutrino flavour is then evaluated to:

E2 ·Φ90% = 4.9 · 10−8GeV · cm−2 · s−1 · sr−1.

The limit is valid under the assumption of flavour equipartition at Earth and
for an unbroken E−2 spectrum in the energy range from 23 TeV to 7.8 PeV.
This range was obtained from the simulated neutrino energy spectrum of all
astrophysical shower-like events by determining its central 90% interval.

8 Summary and Conclusion

A novel event reconstruction algorithm has been presented, which allowed
for the first time to select and reconstruct particle-induced shower events in
data taken with the ANTARES neutrino telescope. The algorithm achieves
a median angular resolution of 6◦ for shower energies below 100TeV. The
median value of the true over reconstructed shower energy ratio, EMC/Erec, is
1.5 – 2 for shower energies up to 1 PeV, while the 90% quantile increases from
3 to 20 for energies between 500GeV and 1PeV. The fraction of successfully
reconstructed events among all triggered shower-like events increases from
50 % to 90 % as a function of the shower energy in the range from 1TeV to
3PeV.

Using 1247 days of ANTARES data, a 90 % C.L. upper limit on a diffuse
astrophysical neutrino flux per flavour was evaluated to:

E2 ·Φ90% = 4.9 · 10−8GeV · cm−2 · s−1 · sr−1.

Figure 5: The 90% C.L. upper limit on the diffuse all-flavour astrophysical
neutrino flux obtained in this work (solid red line) in comparison to previously
set upper limits (dotted lines, AMANDA-II [59], Baikal NT-200 [60], and
ANTARES νµ [16]) and 2 different measurements of a diffuse astrophysical
neutrino flux reported by IceCube (solid blue lines, IC νx/3 [5], and IC νµ [6]).

The limit is valid in the energy range from 23 TeV to 7.8 PeV, assuming an
unbroken E−2 neutrino spectrum and flavour equipartition at Earth. It has
been calculated using the Feldman-Cousins approach [51]. Systematic errors
have been taken into account following Refs. [57, 58].

Fig. 5 illustrates the obtained upper limit in comparison with previously
set limits by the AMANDA [59] and Baikal [60] experiments. The upper limit
obtained in this work almost coincides with those obtained previously with
ANTARES, using only upward-going muons recorded in 855 [16] and 334
[15] days, although the sensitivity of the present dataset is about a factor
of two and three better, respectively. Also shown are the two most recent
IceCube measurements of an astrophysical flux that have been obtained either
with analyses selecting contained events [5] or using through-going muon

20



tracks originating from the Northern sky [6]. All flux limits and measurements
are given per flavour and represent the sum of neutrino and antineutrino
fluxes. For comparison, the conventional atmospheric νµ flux (black solid line
with the gray shaded area showing systematic uncertainty) according to the
Bartol neutrino flux model [52] and the measured atmospheric νe flux [61] is
indicated.

The reported measurement of 8 events is statistically in agreement with
the expected background of 4.6+2.8−3.0 events from atmospheric muons and neu-
trinos. Assuming an astrophysical flux as reported in Ref. [6] ([5]), additional
2.1 (4.4) signal events are expected, which reduces to 1.7 (4.2) events assum-
ing a cut-off at 3 PeV. In all cases, the addition of an astrophysical neutrino
signal is compatible with our measurement.

Though not yet sufficiently sensitive, the presented first shower analysis
using the initial 6 years of data taken with the ANTARES neutrino telescope
demonstrates the potential of ANTARES to independently confirm and com-
plement the measurement of a high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux, as
performed by IceCube. In order to meet this important goal, several improve-
ments of the analysis have been identified and are under way. Building on the
gained experience, a second shower reconstruction strategy is developed. It
improves on the angular resolution and increases the shower event selection
efficiency, while continuing to provide the necessary strong suppression of the
atmospheric muon background. Using the track reconstruction already em-
ployed in our previous searches for a diffuse flux with muon neutrinos [15, 16],
an analysis combining both track-like and shower-like events is in progress.
With the addition of the remaining ANTARES data until the scheduled end
of its operation time in 2017, this combined search is expected to reach a
sensitivity at the level of the flux discovered by IceCube [4].
