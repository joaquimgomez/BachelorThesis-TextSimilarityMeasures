Statoil deployed three acoustic recorders from fall 2013 to 2014 in the Arctic region as

part of a broad scientific campaign. One recorder was installed in the Barentsz Sea south-

east of Spitsbergen. Two other recorders were installed in the Greenland Sea north-east

of Greenland. All recorders were operating at a duty cycle of 2 min on and 30 min off,

sampling at 39,062 Hz and recording in 24 bits. The Greenland recorders both captured

air gun surveys performed during the summer months of 2013, allowing to estimate the

transmission loss in the Arctic over long ranges. This paper presents “log(R)” transmission

loss curves for these scenarios that can help assessing the acoustic shipping impact for

future expeditions.

1. INTRODUCTION

With the opening of shipping routes and improved economic availability of the arctic the
anthropogenic activities have been increasing over the last few years in that area (Stephenson et al.,
2011). At the same time, sound pollution has become an important issue where there is concern
not only about how sound may affect marine mammals (Southall et al., 2007) but also concerning
its affect on fish (Casper et al., 2013), cephalopods (André et al., 2011), and other organisms (Solé
et al., 2016). These affects can lead in extreme cases to direct harm of an animal or more often to
masking of acoustic signals reducing communication of forraging ranges (Jensen et al., 2009). In
the European Union, this concern about sound pollution has resulted in a special section in the
Marine Strategy Framework Directive where sound levels have to be monitored and high intensity
sounds have to be cataloged (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2008).
It is likely that similar requirements will become the norm for operations outside of EU coastal
waters such as the arctic zone which has a rich marine mammal diversity. Actual measurement of
sound contributions from activities is not always possible or practical due to costs or the difficult
artic environment. In many cases source sound levels related to these activities may be available,
but the sound propagation ranges, and the sphere of influence, is often decided using modeling
techniques (Sigray et al., 2016).

This report presents opportunistic data of sound measurements made by two recordings
deployed by Statoil during the 2013–2014 season that recorded seismic surveys using air guns
performed in the area at distances up to 300 km away. The surveys were performed during the
months August, September, and October of 2013 (a duration of about 50 days). Availability of the
survey ship position then permitted to compare received sound levels with source distance and to
estimate the parameters of the most basic sound propagation loss model: C log10(R). Where C is

often set to 20 for spherical loss, to 10 for cylindrical loss,
or somewhere in between to account for sound channels with
partically reflecting surfaces. In this report,C is estimated for long
range propagation loss using the received levels from the air gun
used in the seismic survey. These results may be compared with
for example the shallow water loss curves for the Barentsz Sea
provided in Jensen et al. (2000) that show very high low frequency
losses (over 100 dB at 50Hz at 10 km range) or empirical data in
deep water in DiNapoli andMellen (1986) (around 82 dB at 50Hz
at 100 km range). Additionally this may serve as input or control
for low frequency arctic modeling (Gavrilov and Mikhalevsky,
2006; Alexander et al., 2013).

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1. Recording Equipment
The Greenland I recorder was deployed during the Oden Arctic
Technology Research Cruise 2013 on August 23 at 78◦ 30′N and
10◦ 0′E (Figure 1A) and recovered the next year on September
17. The location was about a 120 km away from the continental
slope (a zone where sperm whale activity could be expected).
The Greenland II recorder was deployed during the Oden Arctic
Technology Research Cruise 2013 on August 22 at 76′ 30′N and
14◦ 20′E and recovered the next year on September 17. The depth
at both deployment locations was around 200 m. The recorders
were attached to a line suspended a few tens of meters above the
sea floor using a subsurface float. The lines were recovered with
the use of an acoustic release.

In both recorders, the data was recorded with a duty cycle of
2 min on and 30 min off sampling at 39,062Hz in 24 bits. The
sampling frequency was chosen to allow a longer deployment
time than 1 year in case its recovery would be delayed due to
weather conditions. The hydrophone (AGUAtech Low-Power
Scientific Measurement Hydrophone) sensitivity was –160 dB

FIGURE 1 | Overview of the deployment area: (A) survey vessel and recorder positions together with bathymetric information (the color bar shows the depth in

meters); (B) Sound speed profiles at the two recorders (red: Greenland I, green: Greenland II) and a location in between the two recorders (blue).

re 1 V/µPa; the data was quantized between ±2.5 V. The
hydrophones were connected to channel B on the two recorders
which had gain correction parameters of –0.732 dB (Greenland
I) and –0.576 dB (Greenland II), respectively.

2.2. Sound Speed Profiles
Sound speed profile data was obtained from the NOAA-
NODC World Ocean Database 2013 to have some idea of
the propagation properties of the environment. Pressure and
salinity information was entered into the UNESCO equation
to compute a sound speed profile. Three profiles are shown in
Figure 1B. The red line was obtained from cruise #4832 (cast
#12258746) recorded at 78.832 latitude and –9.998 longitude
on September 10, 2003. In this case, pressure was not recorded
and it was estimated from the depth. The green line was
obtained from cruise #9719 (cast #3288290) recorded at 76.958
latitude and –14.203 longitude on September 9, 1984. The
blue line was obtained from cruise #10547 (cast #9922885)
recorded at 77.573 latitude and –12.3 longitude on September 3,
2000.

All three profiles were made around the same time of year as
the seismic survey was performed. The recorders were installed
below a possible acoustic channel at a depth of around 100 m. In
any case, the airguns were towed well-above the sound channel,
limiting the amount of acoustic energy that would have been
trapped by it.

Based on the recordings, the frequency band considered to be
most interesting was the third octave band centered on 40 Hz.
Higher frequencies were not always as clearly apparent at long
distances and below 20 Hz the airgun energy started to reduce.
Absorption of this frequency in sea water is below 0.01 dB/km
(Mellen et al., 1987; Ainslie and McColm, 1998) and was ignored
in this analysis in light of the presence of greater sources of error
and propagation distances under 300 km.

FIGURE 3 | Three air gun shot sequences from the Greenland II recorder. All

images show the pulses detected in a single run file (2 min) synchronized using

cross correlation with the first pulse in the recording. The top two ones were

fired from a distance of 20 km, the bottom one from 50 km.

2.3. Airgun Shot Detection
Airgun shots were detected automatically using a basic
magnitude threshold detector requiring peaks to be at least
twice over the background noise level. The background noise
level was estimated before each detected shot by taking a

0.5 s sample 5 s before the detected peak. The configured duty
cycle only provided 2 min of continuous data at a time.
For detected shots to be included in the analysis at least
5 shots had to be detected in the recording and not more
than 13; the latter would indicate a recording with a large
amount of impulsive noise from other sources. Additionally,
detections were eliminated if they did not follow a pattern
of about 11 s intervals. Shots with received peak levels over
160 dB re 1 µPa2 were excluded as they were likely affected
by saturation. A shot was defined as starting 0.1 s before
the detected peak and ending 0.1 s after it. Considering the
large number of available shots that were detectable well-above
the background noise, no efforts were made to fine-tune the
detector to detect weaker impulses. However, as explained further
below, the shots were not always equally well-defined due to
bottom and surface interactions. In total, 10,076 shots detected
at Greenland I and 11,391 shots detected at Greenland II
were used.

2.4. Seismic Survey Data
Positional data was made available through a datasheet provided
by Statoil containing the position and time of the air gun
shots. All gun shot recordings were made in the months
August–October 2013. The survey tracks are shown with a
different color/shape combination for each run in Figure 1A. The
positional data was not entirely consistent with occasional mixing
of shots made under the same operating name and time, but at a
very different position. These positions were much less frequent
than the regular gun shots and were filtered away using a median
distance estimate taken over ship positions from a time interval
around the recorder timestamp.

A broadband source level estimate of the array is published in
the GUNDALF array modeling suite report (Goppen, 2011) and
gives as 252 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m for the zero to peak level (RMS
pressure 229 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m). These values are understood to
be used for long range modeling and are not correct very close to
the array. The source level in a frequency band around 40 Hz was
not known.

loss; the red line is a logarithmic fit with optimal parameters –31 log10(R) (with residual RMS = 5.0 dB) for both graphs.

(A) and measurements between 50 and 300 km away (B) from the Greenland I recorder. Level measurements are in black; background noise measurements are in

blue. The green line represents spherical loss; the red line is a logarithmic fit. The optimal fit up to 50 km range (A) has parameters –16 log10(R) (residual RMS = 4.2

dB) and beyond 50 km (B) –29 log10(R) (residual RMS = 4.6 dB).

The distance between the survey vessel and each recorder is
shown in Figure 2. The color and shape of the different runs
follows the same scheme as in Figure 1A.

2.5. Time Synchronization
It was assumed that the ship timestamps were synchronized
through GPS; the recorder times were configured before
deployment, but they may have some unknown drift. To
synchronize the clocks it was initially planned to find the start
of an airgun run after a long pause that was recorded. There
are more than enough pauses in the airgun deployment, but the
duty cycle of the recorders made it more difficult to find such an
event. Unless the clocks are very much out of synchronization,
it seems that shooting started before the shots were registered in
the shot datasheet, and also continued for some time after. This
made it impossible to find a reliable moment for synchronization.
In order to find the ship range for each detected shot on the

recorder all ship ranges in a 5 min time interval before and after
the shot (10 min in total) were collected and the final range
was evaluated through a median. The error with respect to the
distance of the ship is considered to be small, minimizing at
the same time the effect of spurious airgun activations discussed
above.

2.6. Shot Measurement
For the comparison of measurements, it is important to
understand what the automated algorithm ismeasuring. Figure 3
shows airgun signals passed through a third octave band filter
centered on 40 Hz from three different survey vessel locations
and registered at the Greenland II recorder. Each image shows
the superposition of all the signals detected inside a single run file
of 2 min. The top two images were recorded with the vessel at
roughly 20 km distance. The bottom image with the vessel at 50
km distance.

FIGURE 6 | Received level in the third octave band centered on 40 Hz at the

Greenland II recorder. The green line represents spherical loss; the red line is a

logarithmic fit with optimal parameters −19 log10(R) with residual RMS = 4.2

dB.

There is an obvious difference in recorded levels between
the two 20 km recordings, but first the detection algorithm is
evaluated. The detector looks for the peak level and then takes
a window of 0.1 s on both sides to compute the SPL. The airgun
signals in the images actually consist of multiple pulses (about
three or more) of different intensity; the strongest pulse is not
always at the same position. This means that the algorithm may
not always take the SPL measurement over the same part of the
recorded signal, as shown with the rectangles in the images. The
total window length of 0.2 s was selected to cover a complete
single pulse and the level of the strongest pulse present in the
signal is what is used to evaluate transmission loss, in addition
to changes in the peak level itself. Considering the sampling rate
of the recording (many times higher than necessary for the band
being measured) the peak level itself should be fairly accurately
estimated.

There is a fairly large difference in received levels at 20
km distance in Figure 3. The bathymetry profiles between the
ship position and Greenland II recorder was inspected and were
found to be similar: a gradual increase in elevation of 40–50 m.
Ship shielding at seismic frequencies is not expected to play any
role here. There was a difference in the array orientation but
the airgun array is assumed to have omnidirectional radiation
patterns. The low received levels in Figure 3 were recorded just
when a pause was made. It is not known if reduced levels were
used as an Acoustic Deterrent Device which would have some
effect on the transmission loss estimation; however, if enough
shots were made at constant level these outliers can be ignored
by the modeling process.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Greenland I
First the received sound pressure level in the third octave band
centered on 40 Hz (SPL) and the received peak level (PL) in the
same band are considered at the Greenland I recorder. Figure 4
shows the SPL and PL against the survey vessel distance up to
a distance of 300 km. The red line is a logarithmic fit on the

measurements; the green line represents spherical transmission
loss. The root-mean-square of the residuals of each fit is reported
as the “residual RMS.” The transmission loss follows a pattern
much larger than spherical. In arctic waters it is not unusual
to find high losses at some distance from the source due to
dissipation of reflective rays.

The logarithmic fit in Figure 4 does not follow the curve of the
data very well and a single “log(R)” rule does not seem sufficient.
To look at the loss close to the source a smaller selection of
data was taken based on the distance graphic in Figure 2. At
the end of September and beginning of October (860–990 h) the
survey vessel came closest to Greenland I. Matching the track
colors and shapes in Figure 1A these tracks appear to go almost
straight over the recorder, providing very similar conditions for
the measurements. The received levels of that time period are
displayed in Figure 5 (black dots) together with background
noise levels (blue dots) showing that all the shots are well-above
background noise levels. The transmission loss was now close to
spherical, but still quite high. From around 40 km distance the
“near distance” model starts to fail and another fit is required.
Figure 5B shows the transmission loss for distances from 50 km
together with background noise level estimates. The logarithmic
fit follows the data fairly well. The received levels have a spread
of around 10 dB at each distance. Using a combination of the two
models a prediction could be made below 5 dB error (based on
the residual RMS-values).

The background noise levels plotted in Figure 5 seem to be
coupled to the distance to the survey vessel in a very similar way
as the shots. The operational noise from the survey propagates
well at least up to 300 km.

3.2. Greenland II
The data from the Greenland II recorder will be presented in
a similar fashion as those from Greenland I. The peak level
measurements followed the 40 Hz levels closely and are not
provided. In Figure 6, the 40 Hz SPL measurements are shown
with a logarithmic fit (red) and spherical transmission loss
(green). The transmission loss behaves muchmore spherical than
at Greenland I, with slightly less than spherical loss at large
distances.

At close range the model does not fit the data very well. On
September 3 and 4 the survey vessel made two very similar tracks
nearby the recorder. These correspond to the orange and purple
tracks close to the Recorder II in Figures 1A, 2 (260–285 h). The
variation in received levels was large, which was discussed above
in relationship with Figure 3. Fitting a logarithmic model only
on the levels received at a distance of 50 km or more, as was
done in Figure 5 for Greenland I, resulted in parameters –18
log10(R) with residual RMS = 4.2 dB. As with the Greenland I
recorder, the background noise levels follow a similar pattern
as the airgun shots related to the survey vessel distance (not
shown in plot), indicating that the survey itself is the dominant
contributor during that time.

Interestingly, in e.g., Figure 6, which shows the received peak
levels as in Figure 4B, there is a clear drop in both airgun shot
levels and background noise levels of around 20 dB. This could
be due to the bathymetry. From that position, there was an

underwater ridge at about 136 km from the ship, 50 km from
Recorder II with its peak around 25 m above the recorder depth,
possibly blocking a fair amount of sound. A similar effect was not
as apparent in the data from Recorder I as most of the survey
tracks were made on the north side of it.

4. CONCLUSION

From the data presented above, it appears difficult to define a
“log(R)” when the source is close to the recorder. Figures 5,
6 give very different estimates of the transmission loss with
the former showing a loss much larger than spherical and the
latter a loss somewhat smaller. However, there was less data
available at close distances whichmade it more difficult to average
out level fluctuations due to operational or environmental
circumstances.

A large amount of data was available for both recorders for
larger distances, but at any particular distance the spread of the
received levels was in the order of 10 dB. To clean up the data

the levels were binned at 4 km intervals from 50 up to 250 km.
The results are shown in Figure 7, where the transmission loss at
both recorders is reasonably modeled by spherical transmission
loss. There are bumps in the curves where the propagation path
may have been optimal or partially blocked, but as an order of
magnitude estimation a model using –22 log10(R) seems to be a
good approximation for this area during summer months.
