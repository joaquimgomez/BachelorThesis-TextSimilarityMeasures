Abstract

In the past years, the IceCube Collaboration has reported in several analyses the ob-
servation of astrophysical high-energy neutrino events. Despite a compelling evidence for
the first identification of a neutrino source, TXS 0506+056, the origin of the majority of
these events is still unknown. In this paper, a possible transient origin of the IceCube astro-
physical events is searched for using neutrino events detected by the ANTARES telescope.
The arrival time and direction of 6894 track-like and 160 shower-like events detected over
2346 days of livetime are examined to search for coincidences with 54 IceCube high-energy
track-like neutrino events, by means of a maximum likelihood method. No significant cor-
relation is observed and upper limits on the one-flavour neutrino fluence from the direction
of the IceCube candidates are derived. The non-observation of time and space correlation
within the time window of 0.1 days with the two most energetic IceCube events constrains
the spectral index of a possible point-like transient neutrino source, to be harder than −2.3
and −2.4 for each event, respectively.

1 Introduction

The observation of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos reported by the IceCube Collaboration
in the last few years represents a crucial step forward in the field of neutrino astronomy and
strongly motivates independent searches for their origin. The first significant evidence of a
diffuse flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range was observed in the “High-Energy
Starting Events" (HESE) sample of IceCube [1, 2, 3]. The spectral energy distribution of the 82
events recorded in 6 years of data taking is described in [3] as a single power law: E2νΦ(E) =
2.46± 0.8× 10−8(Eν/100 TeV)−0.92

+0.33
−0.29 GeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1. The ANTARES Collaboration has

investigated the possibility that this signal partially originates from point-like steady sources in
a wide region close to the Galactic Centre and from the position of 13 HESE reconstructed as
tracks [4]. Since no significant excess was observed, strong constraints on Galactic steady-source
contributions of the HESE sample were set.
Another recent measurement by IceCube of the cosmic neutrino flux is based on the analysis
of eight years of track-like events from the Northern Hemisphere [5, 6], hereafter referred to as
“the Muon sample”. The analysis of the 36 muon neutrino events with reconstructed energy
> 200 TeV selected by IceCube resulted in a best-fit of the astrophysical spectrum given by
a single power law: E2νΦ(E) = 1.01

+0.26
−0.23 × 10

−8(Eν/100 TeV)−0.19±0.10 GeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1
[6]. This result presents some tensions with the HESE measurement, which comes from the all-
sky analysis, dominated by shower-like events. The proposed hypothesis of the diffuse Galactic
neutrino emission being a possible cause of the discrepancy [7] has been severely constrained by
both ANTARES and IceCube [8, 9].
Recently, a high-energy neutrino detected by IceCube was found to be positionally coincident
with the direction of a known blazar, TXS 0506+056, in a state of enhanced activity observed in
γ-rays and at other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum [10]. Moreover, an a posteriori
time-variability study of the neutrino emission revealed a flare that occured in 2014/2015 [11].
An ANTARES follow-up triggered by this result yielded no significant observation for neutrinos
in space and/or time correlation either with the high-energy event or with the 2014/2015 flare
[12].
Finally, the observation of two spatially compatible events from the HESE sample with a time
difference of less than one day, with a p-value of 1.6% [13], could be interpreted as the signature
of another flaring source. All these results reinforce the motivation of a time correlation study
between ANTARES and IceCube events. Such a correlation would support the hypothesis of the
IceCube events being originated from flaring episodes.

In the analysis presented in this paper, a total of 54 candidate cosmic neutrino events are
selected from the IceCube HESE and Muon samples and treated as potential transient neutrino
sources. Only events classified as muon tracks, lying within the ANTARES field-of-view and
provided with an angular error, are included in the list. In case of events that are present in both
samples, only the one with smaller angular uncertainty is considered. The equatorial coordinates,
observation time and median angular error of the selected HESE candidates numbered 1 to
37 are extracted from [1], 38 to 54 from [2] and 55 to 82 from [3]; Muon events numbered
1 to 29 are extracted from [5] and 30 to 36 from [6]. All information is reported in Tables 1
and 2. The angular uncertainty corresponds to the median angular error reported by the IceCube
Collaboration in the case of the HESE sample. For events from the Muon sample, an estimation
of the median angular uncertainty is derived from the angular errors on the equatorial coordinates
provided by the IceCube Collaboration. This is done assuming that the median angular errors
on the declination, δ, and the right ascension, α, follow independent Gaussian distributions with
standard deviation given by the angular errors. The standard deviation of the two-dimensional

3



Gaussian, function of δ and α, is then employed as median angular uncertainty. In this sample,
a conservative minimum value of 1◦ for the angular uncertainty is assumed.
In contrast to time-integrated searches, the information of the neutrino arrival times is exploited
to enhance the discovery potential. When dealing with transient emissions, the background of
atmospheric neutrinos can be significantly reduced by limiting the search to a small time window
around the source flare. In this work, a maximum likelihood approach is followed to look for
spatial and temporal coincidences between the selected ANTARES events and the IceCube HESE
and Muon candidates.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, the ANTARES neutrino telescope and the
data sample are described. The search method is explained in Section 3. In Section 4, the results
of the analysis are presented, while the conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

2 ANTARES neutrino telescope and data sample

The ANTARES neutrino telescope [14] is located 40 km off-shore from Toulon, France, anchored
2475 m below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. A three-dimensional array of 885 photomulti-
plier tubes (PMTs) detects the Cherenkov light induced by charged particles produced in neutrino
interactions within and around the instrumented volume. The 10-inch PMTs, distributed along
12, 450 m long, vertical lines, face 45◦ downward in order to optimise the detection of light from
upgoing particles. The position, time and collected charge of the signals in the PMTs (hits) are
used to infer the direction and energy of the incident neutrino.
Two event topologies can be identified in the ANTARES neutrino telescope: track-like and
shower-like. The former can be the signature of a long-range muon produced in charged current
(CC) interactions of muon neutrinos in the proximity of the detector. For this event topology,
the direction of the parent neutrino can be reconstructed with a median angular resolution of
0.4◦ [15]. Shower-like events are mainly induced by neutral current (NC) interactions, and by
νe and ντ CC interactions. Since the shower elongation is of a few metres, the whole shower
appears as a point-like light source in the ANTARES detector. A median angular resolution of
about 3◦ can be achieved for high-quality selected events [16]. The analysis presented in this
paper includes both track-like and shower-like events recorded in ANTARES between the 1st
of December 2008 and the 31st of December 2016 for a total livetime of 2346 days, covering
the whole considered IceCube observation time (6 years and 8 years for the HESE and Muon
samples, respectively). The events are selected following the chain of cuts defined in the latest
ANTARES point-like source analysis [4]. A summary of the different selection criteria for tracks
and showers is given below.

Track Selection. The selection of muon-neutrino-induced events is optimised using parameters
provided by the track reconstruction algorithm – a multi-step fitting procedure that estimates
the direction and the position of the muon by means of a maximum likelihood method [17].
Cuts are applied on the reconstructed zenith angle (cos θtr > −0.1), the estimated angular error
(βtr < 1◦) and the parameter that describes the quality of the reconstruction (Λ > −5.2) in order
to increase both the quality and the purity of the neutrino sample. Further cuts, described in [4],
are imposed on energy-related variables in order to guarantee the validity of the muon energy
estimator employed in the analysis. For each event, a proxy for the muon energy is provided
based on the parameter ρ [18, 19] which computes the muon energy deposition per unit path
length. A total of 6894 neutrino candidates are selected in the track channel, with an expected
atmospheric muon contamination of 13%.

4



Shower Selection. Only events not selected as tracks are considered in the shower chan-
nel. Showers are selected if reconstructed as upgoing or coming from close to the horizon
(cos θsh > −0.1) with constraints on the angular error estimate (βsh < 30◦) and on the in-
teraction vertex, which is required to lie within a fiducial volume slightly larger than the in-
strumented volume. Additional selection cuts based on parameters provided by two different
shower reconstruction algorithms are applied to further reduce the remaining background from
mis-reconstructed atmospheric muons. A detailed description of these cuts can be found in [4].
The selection yields a total of 160 neutrino candidates in the shower channel, with an estimated
43% of atmospheric muon contamination.

3 Analysis method and expected performances

The directions of the 54 IceCube candidates are investigated to search for spatial and temporal
clustering of events above the known background expectation following a maximum likelihood
ratio approach. The likelihood describes the ANTARES data in terms of signal and background
probability density functions (PDFs) and is defined as:

logLs+b =
∑

J∈{tr ,sh}

∑
i∈J

log

− µsig, (1)

where SJi and B
J
i are the values of the signal and background PDFs for the event i in the sample

J (tr for tracks, sh for showers), while µJsig and N
J are respectively the number of unknown

signal events and the total number of data events in the J sample. The combined information
of three parameters – direction, observation time and energy – is included in the definition
of the PDFs in order to enhance the signal-to-background discrimination. While atmospheric
neutrino events are rather randomly distributed, neutrinos from transient point-like sources are
expected to accumulate around the source position and flaring time, i.e. the direction (α, δ) and
the observation time tIC of the considered IceCube candidate. The energy information helps
to distinguish signal from background, as a softer energy spectrum is predicted for atmospheric
neutrinos (E−γ with γ ∼ −3.6 [19]) with respect to the expected signal. Slightly different
definitions of the PDFs are used in the track and in the shower channels. For each track-like
event i, the probability of being reconstructed as signal or background is given by:

Stri = S
space(∆Ψi, βi|γ) · Senergy(ρi, βi|δi, γ) · Stime(ti), (2)

Btri = B
space(δi) · Benergy(ρi, βi|δi) · Btime(ti). (3)

As for the shower-like events, the probabilities are computed as

Sshi = S
space(∆Ψi|γ) · Senergy(Nhitsi |γ) · S

time(ti), (4)

Bshi = B
space(δi) · Benergy(Nhitsi ) · B

time(ti), (5)

where:

• Sspace is a parameterization of the Point Spread Function (PSF), i.e. the probability density
function of reconstructing an ANTARES event i at a given angular distance ∆Ψi from the
true source location, i.e. the position of the IceCube candidate. The shape of the PSF
is determined from Monte Carlo simulations of cosmic neutrinos assuming a E−γ energy
dependence of the spectrum with variable spectral index γ, which is fitted in the likelihood
maximisation. In the case of the track channel, the information of the event angular error
estimate βi is also included.

• Bspace yields the probability of reconstructing a background event at a certain declination
δi. It is derived from data using the observed declination distribution of the selected events.

• Senergy and Benergy give the probability for a signal or background event to be reconstructed
with a certain value of the energy related parameter (ρ for tracks and the number of hits
used by the reconstruction algorithm, Nhits, for showers). Monte Carlo simulations of E−γ
energy spectrum cosmic neutrinos (signal) assuming neutrino flavour equipartition at Earth
and of atmospheric neutrinos using the spectrum of [20] (background) are used to derive
the energy PDFs. In the track channel, the information of the event angular error estimate
βi is also considered and the dependence of the energy estimator on the declination δi of
the event is taken into account by generating both PDFs in steps of 0.2 in sin δ.

• Stime is the signal time-dependent PDF. In this analysis, a generic Gaussian time profile

for the signal emission is assumed, Stime(ti) = 1√2πσt e
(− (ti−tIC )

2

2σ2
t

)
, with ti being the detec-

tion time of the ANTARES event i, tIC the observation time of the considered IceCube
candidate, and σt the unknown flare duration, fitted in the likelihood maximisation.

• Btime describes the probability to observe a background event at a given time ti. Given
the small expected contribution of a cosmic signal in the overall data set, this PDF is
built using the time distribution of data events, ensuring a time profile proportional to the
measured data. To avoid statistical fluctuations, this PDF is computed applying looser
selection criteria than those of the final sample.

The likelihood of equation (1) is maximised independently at the position of each IceCube
event leaving as free parameters the number of signal events µsig = µtrsig +µ

sh
sig, the signal spectral

index γ and the flare duration σt, providing the best-fit values µ̂sig, γ̂, σ̂t for each investigated
source. Moreover, the position in the sky of the fitted source is left free to vary around the
position of the IceCube event within a cone with opening angle twice as large as its angular
uncertainty. In the maximisation, the value of the spectral index can range between 1.5 and 3.5,
while values between 0.1 and 120 days are allowed for the flare duration. The lowest precision
of the observation time of the IceCube candidates provided by the IceCube Collaboration sets
the lower bound to 0.1 days, while the choice of 120 days as upper bound is imposed by the
fact that the time distance between the last recorded IceCube candidate (HESE ID 82) and the
last ANTARES available fully-calibrated data is ∼ 240 days. Thus, more than 95% of the signal
events from a Gaussian flare with σ = 120 days and centered at the observation time of HESE
ID 82 could be detected within the considered ANTARES data taking period.

The significance of any cluster of ANTARES events around an IceCube candidate is deter-
mined by a test statistic Q derived from the likelihood as

Q = logLs+b − logLb, (6)

6



where logLs+b is the likelihood defined in equation (1) evaluated with the best-fit values (µsig =
µ̂sig, σt = σ̂t, γ = γ̂, α = α̂, δ = δ̂) and logLb is the likelihood evaluated in the background-only
case (µsig = 0). The Q distributions for different signal strengths are determined from pseudo-
experiments (PEs), i.e. performing the search for time and spatial correlation on scrambled
data. In each PE, a fake sky-map containing a known number of signal events injected into a
background-only dataset is generated. The simulated directions and times of the background
events are randomly drawn from the zenith, azimuth and time distributions as seen in the
actual data. The distribution of the reconstructed zenith angle is parametrised by two different
spline functions, P (θ) and O(θ), shown in Figure 1. In order to account for possible systematic
uncertainties on the background, the zenith-dependent distribution of background events, Z(θ),
in each PE is taken as Z(θ) = P (θ) + r · (O(θ) − P (θ)), with r being a random number drawn
from a uniform distribution between -1 and 1. The simulated signal events are injected around
a given candidate position assuming an unbroken power-law E−γ energy spectrum with γ being
the tested spectral index. A random time drawn from a Gaussian distribution characterized by a
mean and a standard deviation given by the IceCube candidate observation time and the tested
flare duration is assigned to each signal event.

and O(θ), are shown as purple and orange lines.

In order to estimate the potential of the search, the mean number of signal events needed for
a 5σ discovery is calculated for different durations of the simulated flare. As an example, Figure
2 shows the number of signal events needed for a 5σ significance with a 50% detection power at
the location of the IceCube event HESE ID 3, for a E−γ neutrino spectrum, with γ equal to 2.0
or 2.5.

In the case of signal emission lasting a few hours, the number of events needed for a 5σ
discovery is reduced by a factor ∼ 3 (depending on the assumed source spectrum) with respect to
a time integrated analysis. Similar levels of improvement in the discovery potential are expected
for all the IceCube candidates.

4 Results

No significant excess over the expected background is observed for any of the assumed source
locations when applying the described search method. The positions of the ANTARES tracks
and showers together with the directions of the 54 IceCube candidates are shown in Figure 3.

The most significant cluster, defined as the cluster with the lowest pre-trial p-value, is found
at the location of the IceCube track with ID 15 from the Muon sample, with a number of fitted
signal events µ̂sig = 1.6, a best-fit flare duration σ̂t = 120 days and a best-fit spectral index
γ̂ = 3.5. The pre-trial p-value of the cluster is 3.7%, corresponding to a significance of 2.1σ.
The second and third most significant sources correspond to HESE ID 71 and Muon ID 26, with
pre-trial p-values of 3.8% and 4.6%, respectively. Since multiple candidates are analysed, trial
factors must be taken into account. To do so, the distribution of the smallest p-values obtained
performing the search on the same list of sources using PEs is computed. The observed pre-trial
p-value is then compared to this distribution, providing a post-trial probability of 90% for the

In the absence of a significant excess, upper limits on the one-flavour neutrino fluence at 90%
C.L. are derived using the Neyman method [21]. The fluence F is defined as the integral in time
and energy of the neutrino energy flux E · ΦE :

In this equation, ΦE is the neutrino differential flux given by the flux normalization Φ0
multiplied by the dimensionless neutrino spectrum S(E) = (E/GeV)−γ . The integral in time

extends over the duration of the flare ∆T . In the integral (7), the best-fit flare duration σ̂t is
assumed as ∆T . The parameters Emin and Emax represent the boundaries of the declination-
dependent energy range containing 90% of the expected signal events.

A summary of the results, in terms of best-fit number of signal events µ̂sig, spectral index
γ̂, flare duration σ̂t and upper limits on the fluence, is reported in Tables 1 and 2. For those
sources for which a null number of signal events is fitted, limits are calculated assuming ∆T =
120 days, chosen arbitrarily, as the value of the fitted flare duration is meaningless for clusters
fully compatible with being background-like. In Figure 4 the one-flavour neutrino fluence upper
limits and sensitivities calculated for the same flares are shown as a function of the source
declination for the two spectral assumptions.

A discussion on the implications of the null observation in a time window of 0.1 days follows.
The study does not reveal any ANTARES track-like (shower-like) event in correlation with any
IceCube candidate within a time window of 0.1 days and a maximal angular distance of 10◦
(30◦). Under the hypothesis that each IceCube candidate is produced by a different point-like
transient source with a flare duration ≤ 0.1 days, this non-detection is used to derive a constraint
on the spectral index of such a source, as done in a previous ANTARES work [22]. Using a
counting method and assuming Poisson statistics, the 90% C.L. upper limit on the number of
ANTARES events in time correlation with an IceCube HESE/Muon candidate is n90s = 2.3. The
corresponding upper limit on the neutrino fluence normalisation for different spectral indices γ

with AICeff being either the HESE or Muon IceCube effective area [23].

In Figure 5 the 90% C.L. upper limits, N90ν,IC, as a function of the spectral index γ are shown
for the most energetic IceCube event of each sample, Muon ID 27 and HESE ID 45. If N90ν,IC
is smaller than 1 (number of events detected by IceCube), a transient origin with flare duration
≤ 0.1 days can be excluded at 90% C.L.. Each IceCube event is therefore only consistent with
the mentioned transient origin for neutrino spectra harder than E−2.4 for the event Muon ID
27, E−2.3 for the event HESE ID 45. These limits are compatible with the IceCube best-fitting
spectral indices 2.2±0.2 and 2.1±0.2 for the neutrino flare from the direction of TXS 0506+056
[11].

5 Conclusions

A search for time and space correlation between the selected ANTARES events and 54 IceCube
high-energy track-like events has been presented. As no significant evidence of correlation be-
tween the ANTARES and the IceCube events has been observed, no further evidence is found

been derived. The non-detection of any ANTARES event within 0.1 days from the IceCube
neutrinos observation times has been used to constrain the spectral index of a possible flaring
source responsible for the most energetic IceCube event of each sample.
