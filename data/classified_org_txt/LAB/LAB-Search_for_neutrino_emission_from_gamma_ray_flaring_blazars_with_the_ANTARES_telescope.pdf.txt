The ANTARES telescope is well-suited to detect neutrinos produced in astrophysical transient sources as
it can observe a full hemisphere of the sky at all times with a high duty cycle. Radio-loud active galactic
nuclei with jets pointing almost directly towards the observer, the so-called blazars, are particularly
attractive potential neutrino point sources. The all-sky monitor LAT on board the Fermi satellite probes
the variability of any given gamma-ray bright blazar in the sky on time scales of hours to months. Assum-
ing hadronic models, a strong correlation between the gamma-ray and the neutrino fluxes is expected.
Selecting a narrow time window on the assumed neutrino production period can significantly reduce
the background.

An unbinned method based on the minimization of a likelihood ratio was applied to a subsample of
data collected in 2008 (61 days live time). By searching for neutrinos during the high state periods of
the AGN light curve, the sensitivity to these sources was improved by about a factor of two with respect
to a standard time-integrated point source search. First results on the search for neutrinos associated
with ten bright and variable Fermi sources are presented.

1. Introduction

Neutrinos are unique messengers to study the high-energy uni-
verse as they are neutral and stable, interact weakly and therefore
travel directly from their point of creation to the Earth without
absorption. Neutrinos could play an important role in understand-
ing the mechanisms of cosmic ray acceleration and their detection
from a cosmic source would be a direct evidence of the presence of
hadronic acceleration. The production of high-energy neutrinos
has been proposed for several kinds of astrophysical sources, such
as active galactic nuclei (AGN), gamma-ray bursters (GRB), super-
nova remnants and microquasars, in which the acceleration of
hadrons may occur (see Ref. [1] for a review).

Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacs, classified as
AGN blazars, exhibit relativistic jets pointing almost directly
towards the Earth and are some of the most violent variable high
energy phenomena in the Universe [2]. These sources are among
the most likely sources of the observed ultra high energy cosmic
rays. Blazars typically display spectra with enhanced emission over
two energy ranges: the IR/X-ray and MeV/TeV peaks. The lower
energy peak is generally agreed to be the product of synchrotron
radiation from accelerated electrons. However, the origin of the
higher energy peak remains to be clarified. In leptonic models
[3], inverse Compton scattering of synchrotron photons (or other
ambient photons) by accelerated electrons generates this high en-
ergy emission. In hadronic models [4], MeV–TeV gamma-rays and
high energy neutrinos are produced through hadronic interactions

of the high energy cosmic rays with radiation or gas clouds sur-
rounding the source. The gamma-ray light curves of bright blazars
measured by the LAT instrument on board the Fermi satellite re-
veal important time variability on timescales of hours to several
weeks, with intensities much larger than the typical flux of the
source in its quiescent state [5]. The high state periods of the gam-
ma-ray light curves are used as tracers of the most promising neu-
trino emission periods with the hypothesis of the time coincidence
of both emissions.

This paper presents the results of the first time-dependent
search for cosmic neutrino sources by the ANTARES telescope.
The data sample used in this analysis and the comparison to Monte
Carlo simulations are described in Section 2, together with a dis-
cussion on the systematic uncertainties. The point source search
algorithm used in this time-dependent analysis is explained in Sec-
tion 3. The search results are presented in Section 4 for ten selected
candidate sources.
2. ANTARES

The ANTARES Collaboration completed the construction of a
neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea with the connection
of its twelfth detector line in May 2008 [6]. The telescope is located
40 km off the Southern coast of France (42�48’N, 6�10’E) at a depth
of 2475 m. It comprises a three-dimensional array of photomulti-
pliers housed in glass spheres (optical modules [7]), distributed
along twelve slender lines, 450 m height, anchored at the sea bot-
tom and kept taut by a buoy at the top. The average distance
between lines is 60 m. Each line is composed of 25 storeys of
triplets of optical modules (OMs), each housing one 10-inch photo-
multiplier. The lines are subject to the sea currents and can change
shape and orientation. A positioning system based on hydropho-
nes, compasses and tiltmeters is used to monitor the detector
geometry with an accuracy of 10 cm.

The main goal of the experiment is to search for high energy
neutrinos with energies greater than 100 GeV by detecting muons
produced by the neutrino charged current interaction in the vicin-
ity of the detector. Due to the large background from downgoing
atmospheric muons, the telescope is optimised for the detection
of upgoing muons as only they can originate from neutrinos.

Muons induce the emission of Cherenkov light in the sea water.
The arrival time and intensity of the Cherenkov light on the OMs
are digitised into hits and transmitted to shore. Events containing
muons are selected from the continuous deep sea optical back-
grounds due to natural radioactivity and bioluminescence. A
detailed description of the detector and the data acquisition is
given in [6,8].

The arrival times of the hits are calibrated as described in [9]. A
L1 hit is defined either as a high-charge hit, or as hits separated by
less than 20 ns on OMs of the same storey. At least five L1 hits are
required throughout the detector within a time window of 2.2 ls,
with the relative photon arrival times being compatible with the
light coming from a relativistic particle. Independently, events
which have L1 hits on two sets of adjacent or next-to-adjacent
floors are also selected. This second condition mainly improves
the trigger efficiency by 10–15% at energy lower than 1 TeV.

The data used in this analysis were taken in the period from
September 6 to December 31, 2008 (54720 to 54831 modified
Julian days, MJD) with the twelve line detector. This period over-
laps with the availability of the first data from the LAT instrument
onboard the Fermi satellite. The corresponding effective live time is
60.8 days. Atmospheric neutrinos are the main source of back-
ground in the search for astrophysical neutrinos. These upgoing
neutrinos are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays in the
Earth’s atmosphere. To account for this background, neutrino
events were simulated according to the parametrisation of the
atmospheric neutrino flux from Ref. [10] with 100 years equivalent
live time. Only charged current interactions of muon neutrinos and
antineutrinos were considered. An additional source of background
is due to downgoing atmospheric muons mis-reconstructed as
upgoing. Downgoing atmospheric muons were simulated with
the MUPAGE package [11] with a sample equivalent to 1/10 of
the actual live time. In both cases, the same detector geometry is
used and the Cherenkov light was propagated taking into account
light absorption and scattering in sea water [12].

From the timing and position information of the hits, muon
tracks are reconstructed using a multi-stage fitting procedure,
based on Ref. [13]. The initial fitting stages provide the hit selection

and starting point for the final fit. The final stage consists of a max-
imum likelihood fit of the observed hit times and includes the con-
tribution of optical background hits.

To discard most of the downgoing atmospheric muon back-
ground, a cut on the zenith angle (h > 90�) is applied to select
only upgoing events. To suppress the remaining atmospheric
muons mis-reconstructed as upgoing, tracks are also required to
have a good reconstruction quality. The latter is quantified by a
parameter, K, which is based on the value of the likelihood func-
tion obtained for the fitted muon (see Ref. [13] for details). The
cumulative distribution of K for muons reconstructed as upgoing
is shown in Fig. 1 along with the simulated contributions from
atmospheric muons and neutrinos. The small discrepancy be-
tween data and simulation at very negative values of lambda is
due to pure optical noise (40 K decay and bioluminescence) back-
ground events not taken into account in the Monte Carlo simula-
tions. The error estimate of the reconstructed track direction
obtained from the track fit is required to be smaller than 1 de-
gree. This error is extracted from the diagonal terms of the covari-
ance error matrix of the track fit. Fig. 2 shows the simulated
distributions of the error estimate parameter for both atmo-
spheric muon and neutrinos.

For this analysis, events are selected with K > �5:4. This value
yields to the best 5r discovery potential and results from the opti-
mal compromise between the atmospheric neutrino and muon
background reduction and the efficiency of the cosmic neutrino
signal with an assumed spectrum proportional to E�2m , where Em is
the neutrino energy. The final sample consists of 628 events ob-
tained in 60.8 days. The simulations indicate that the selected
sample contains 60% atmospheric neutrinos; the rest being mis-
reconstructed atmospheric muons. The average energy (5–95%) is
70 GeV – 11 TeV for atmospheric neutrinos and 2 TeV – 1.4 PeV
for cosmic neutrinos with a E�2m spectrum.

The angular resolution of the reconstructed neutrino direction
cannot be determined directly from the data and has to be esti-
mated from simulation. Comparison of data and Monte Carlo in
which the time accuracy of the hits was degraded by up to 3 ns
constrains the systematic uncertainty of the angular resolution to
about 0.1� [14]. This uncertainty incorporates effects on possible
detector mis-alignments, inaccuracies in the simulation of light
propagation in the water or the time response distribution of the
PMT. Fig. 3 shows the cumulative distribution of the angular differ-
ence between the reconstructed muon direction and the neutrino
direction for an assumed spectrum proportional to E�2m . For the

The effective area for muon neutrinos is defined as the ratio
between the rate of selected neutrino events and the cosmic
neutrino flux. Fig. 4 shows the muon neutrino and antineutrino
effective area of the ANTARES telescope as a function of the decli-
nation of the source, after integrating over the energy with an as-
sumed spectrum proportional to E�2m between 10 GeV and 10 PeV.
In the flux limits (see Section 4), a conservative uncertainty on
the detection efficiency of about 30% is taken into account. This
number includes contributions on the uncertainty of the sea water
optical parameters [12] and the OM properties such as efficiency
and angular acceptance.

3. Time-dependent search algorithm

The time-dependent point source analysis is performed using
an unbinned method based on a likelihood ratio maximisation.
The data are parametrised as a mixture of cosmic neutrino signal
and atmospheric neutrino and muon background. The goal is to
determine, at a given point in the sky and at a given time, the rel-
ative contribution of each component and to calculate the proba-
bility to have a signal above background in a given model. The
likelihood ratio, k, is the logarithm of the ratio of the probability
density for the hypothesis of signal and background (Hsigþbkg) over
the probability density of only background (Hbkg):

where nsig is the unknown number of signal events determined by
the fit and N is the total number of events in the considered data
sample. Psigðai; tiÞ and Pbkgðdi; tiÞ are the probability density func-
tions (PDF) for signal and background respectively. For a given
event i, ti; di and ai represent the time of the event, its declination
and the angular separation from the source under consideration.

The probability densities Psig and Pbkg are factorised into a
purely directional and a purely time-related component. For signal
events, the directional PDF is described by the one dimensional
point spread function (PSF), which is the probability density of
reconstructing an event at an angular distance a from the true
source position. The shape of the time PDF for the signal event is
extracted directly from the gamma-ray light curve assuming pro-
portionality between the gamma-ray and the neutrino fluxes. The
directional and time PDF for the background are derived from
the data using the observed declination distribution of the selected
events and the observed one-day binned time distribution of all
the reconstructed muons respectively. Fig. 5 shows the time distri-
bution of all the reconstructed events and the selected upgoing
events for this analysis. Once normalised to an integral equal to
1, the distribution for all reconstructed events is used directly as
the time PDF for the background. Empty bins in the histograms
correspond to periods with no data taking (i.e. detector in mainte-
nance) or with very poor quality data (high bioluminescence or bad
calibration).

The statistical interpretation of the search result relies on sim-
ulated pseudo experiments (PE) in which the background events
are randomly generated by sampling the declination and the time
from the parametrisation Pbkgðdi; tiÞ and the right ascension from a
uniform distribution. Events from a neutrino point source are sim-
ulated by adding events around the desired coordinates according
to the point spread function and the time distribution of the stud-
ied source. Systematic uncertainties (cf Section 2) are incorporated
directly into the pseudo experiment generation. The uncertainties
on the angular resolution and orientation of the detector were
incorporated by varying the simulated characteristics of the signal

events within the assigned range of 0.1�. The uncertainties affect-
ing the effective area is accounted for in the limits by varying the
number of injected signal events by a Gaussian error with a width
of 30%.

The null hypothesis corresponds to nsig ¼ 0. The obtained value
of kdata on the data is then compared to the distribution of
kðnsig ¼ 0Þ. Large values of kdata compared to the distribution of
kðnsig ¼ 0Þ reject the null hypothesis with a confidence level (C.L.)
equal to the fraction of the number of PE above kdata. The fraction
of PE for which kðnsig ¼ 0Þ is above kdata is referred to as the p-value.
The discovery potential is then defined as the average number of
signal events required to achieve a p-value lower than 5r in 50%
of the PEs. In the same way, the sensitivity is defined as the average
signal required to obtain a p-value less than that of the median of
the kðnsig ¼ 0Þ distribution in 90% of the PEs. In the absence of evi-
dence of a signal, an upper limit on the neutrino fluence is obtained
and defined as the integral in energy and time of the flux upper
limit with an assumed energy spectrum proportional to E�2m from
10 GeV to 10 PeV. The limits are calculated according to the classi-
cal (frequentist) method for upper limits [15].

The performance of the time-dependent analysis was computed
by applying this unbinned algorithm for a single source assuming a
single square-shape flare of fixed fluence with a width varying
from 0.01 days to 32 days. The solid line in Fig. 6 shows the average
number of events required for a discovery from one source located
at a declination of �40� as a function of the width of the flare. The
numbers in the black line are compared to that obtained without
using the timing information (dashed line). The time-integrated
analysis was performed using the same inputs (data sample, source
characteristics) and the same unbinned algorithm but with the
time PDF term set to 1. Time dependent searches have their power
by cutting down on the atmospheric neutrino and muon back-
ground, shorter flares cut more background. The flare timing infor-
mation yields an improvement of the discovery potential by about
a factor 2 (1.3) with respect to a standard time-integrated point
source search [14] when looking for a 1 (10) day flare.

4. Search for neutrino emission from gamma-ray flares

The time-dependent analysis was applied to bright and variable
Fermi blazar sources reported in the first-year Fermi LAT catalogue
[16] and in the LBAS catalogue (LAT Bright AGN sample [17]). Sources
were selected in the sky visible to ANTARES and that had at least one
day binned gamma-ray flux in the high state periods greater than
8 � 10�7 photons cm�2 s�1 above 100 MeV and showed significant
time variability on time scales of days to weeks in the studied time
period. A source is assumed variable in the LBAS catalogue when
the observation has a probability of less than 1% of being a steady
source. This list includes six Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars and four
BL-Lacs. Only four bright and nearby sources in the considered sam-
ple, PKS2155–304 [18], PKS1510–089 [19], 3C279 [20] and WComae
[21], have been detected by the ground Cherenkov telescopes HESS,
MAGIC or VERITAS.
Table 1 lists the characteristics of the ten selected sources.

The light curves published on the Fermi web page for the
monitored sources [22] are used for this analysis. They correspond
to the time evolution of the daily gamma-ray flux in the band
0.1–300 GeV since August 2008. The high state periods are defined
using a simple and robust method based on three main steps.
Firstly, the baseline is determined with an iterative linear fit. After
each fit, bins more than two sigma (rBL) above the baseline (BL) are
removed. Secondly, seeds for the high state periods are identified
by searching for bins significantly above the baseline according
to the criteria:

ðF � rFÞ > ðBLþ 2 � rBLÞ and F > ðBLþ 3 � rBLÞ ð2Þ

where F and rF represent the flux and the uncertainty on this flux
for each bin, respectively. For each seed, the adjacent bins for which
the emission is compatible with the flare are added if they satisfy:
ðF � rFÞ > ðBLþ rBLÞ. Finally, an additional delay of 0.5 days is
added before and after the flare in order to take into account that
the precise time of the flare is not known (1-day binned light curve).
With this definition, a flare has a width of at least two days. The
flare search was performed on the 2008–2010 Fermi light curve

and then the list of flare periods was restrained to the studied per-
iod. This procedure takes into account the errors on the gamma-ray
data points and without any interpolation that would smear out the
signal in time and make the analysis less effective. Moreover, it
allows finding the minimal threshold to apply to the gamma-ray
flux to identify periods statistically inconsistent with a steady emis-
sion. Fig. 7 shows the time distribution of the Fermi LAT gamma-ray
light curve of 3C454.3 for almost two years of data and the corre-
sponding selected high state periods. With the hypothesis that the
neutrino emission follows the gamma-ray emission, the signal time
PDF is simply the normalised light curve of only the high state
periods. The third column of Table 2 lists the flaring periods for
the ten sources found from September to December 2008.

The results of the search for coincidences between flares and
neutrinos are listed in Table 2. For nine sources, no coincidences
are found. For 3C279, a single high-energy neutrino event is found
in spatial and time coincidence during a large flare in November
2008. Fig. 8 shows the time distribution of the Fermi gamma-ray
light curve of 3C279 and the time of the coincident neutrino event.
This event was reconstructed with 89 hits distributed on ten lines
with a track fit quality K ¼ �4:4. The particle track direction is
reconstructed at 0.56� from the source location. The pre-trial p-va-
lue is 1.0%. However, the post-trial probability computed taking
into account the ten searches is 10%; this occurrence is thus com-
patible with a background fluctuation. In the absence of a discov-
ery, upper limits on the neutrino fluence were computed and are
shown including the systematic errors in the last column of Table
2. The overall effect of including the systematic uncertainties is a
degradation of the limit by 10%.
5. Summary

This paper presents the first time-dependent search for cosmic
neutrinos using the data taken with the full twelve line ANTARES
detector during the last four months of 2008. For short variable
sources, time-dependent point searches are more sensitive than
time-integrated searches due to the large reduction of the back-
ground assuming that neutrinos and gamma-rays are emitted in
the same periods. This search was applied to ten very bright and
variable Fermi LAT blazars. One neutrino event was detected in
time/direction coincidence with the gamma-ray emission in only
one case, for a flare of 3C279 in November 2008, with a post-trial
probability of 10%. Upper limits were obtained on the neutrino
fluence for the ten selected sources.
