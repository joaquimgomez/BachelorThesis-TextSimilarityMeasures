Abstract: The ANTARES neutrino telescope has an energy threshold of a few tens of

GeV. This allows to study the phenomenon of atmospheric muon neutrino disappearance

due to neutrino oscillations. In a similar way, constraints on the 3+1 neutrino model, which

foresees the existence of one sterile neutrino, can be inferred. Using data collected by the

ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to 2016, a new measurement of ∆m232 and θ23 has

been performed — which is consistent with world best-fit values — and constraints on the

3+1 neutrino model have been derived.

1 Introduction

Neutrino oscillations arise from the mixing between flavour (νe, νµ, ντ ) and mass (ν1, ν2, ν3)

eigenstates. The mixing parameters of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix [1–3]

(PMNS) and the differences between the mass eigenvalues regulate the oscillation proba-

bility.

Neutrino oscillations have been detected by a variety of experiments, studying solar

as well as atmospheric neutrinos, but also neutrinos produced from nuclear reactors and

particle accelerators. For a comprehensive review see [4].

Atmospheric neutrinos are produced through the interaction of cosmic rays with nuclei

in the Earth’s atmosphere. Their flux spans many orders of magnitude in energy, from GeV

to hundreds of TeV. Being isotropic to first order, it allows to investigate a large range

of baselines on the Earth’s surface, from ∼ 10 km of vertically down-going to ∼ 104 km of
vertically up-going neutrinos.

In this paper the muon disappearance channel (Pνµ→νµ) is studied. The vacuum sur-

vival probability for a muon neutrino of energy E interacting at a distance L from its

creation point is given by:

dominance” approximation, relevant in the energy domain considered for this analysis.

Here the νµ survival probability depends only on Uµ3 = sin θ23 cos θ13 and ∆m
2
32. For a

vertically up-going atmospheric νµ, the first minimum of the survival probability described

in equation (1.1) is reached at energies of ∼ 25 GeV. The formalism given in eq. (1.1)
is further modified by matter effects [5–7] as the neutrinos propagate through the Earth.

Throughout the paper, oscillation probabilities are calculated with the OscProb package [8]

which treats matter effects for an arbitrary number of neutrino families numerically without

approximations.

The ANTARES neutrino telescope [9] has been designed and optimised for the ex-

ploration of the high-energy Universe by using neutrinos as cosmic probes. However, its

energy threshold of about 20 GeV is sufficient, even if at the edge, to be sensitive to the

first atmospheric oscillation minimum, making also the study of neutrino oscillations pos-

sible. As neutrinos and antineutrinos are indistinguishable on an event-by-event basis in

neutrino telescopes, in the following muon (electron) neutrinos are refered to the sum of

contributions from both neutrinos and antineutrinos.

A previous analysis of ANTARES data, covering the data acquisition period from

2007 to 2010, represented the first study of this kind performed by a neutrino telescope,

and measured the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters, ∆m232 and θ23 [10]. In the

present work, data collected during 10 years have been studied with a new analysis chain

that also includes a more comprehensive treatment of various systematic effects.

Despite the fact that neutrino oscillation is a well established phenomenon, some ob-

served experimental anomalies, such as the ones reported by the LSND [11] and Mini-

BooNE [12] collaborations, seem to indicate a deviation from the standard 3-flavour picture.

These discrepancies could be partially explained by introducing in the model an additional

neutrino state. However, since the number of weakly interacting families of light neutrinos

is limited to three by the LEP results [13], the additional neutrinos have to be sterile, i.e.,

they do not undergo weak interactions.

The 3+1 neutrino model foresees the existence of one sterile neutrino in addition to

the three standard ones. A choice has to be made, how to extend the mixing matrix U

from three to four families. In this analysis the convention from [14] (see “supplementary

materials”) is adopted: U3+1 = R34R24R14R23R13R12 where Rij is the rotation matrix for

angle θij . If j − i > 1, Rij also contains a CP-violating phase, δij . Six new real mixing
parameters have to be accounted for: three new mixing angles, θ14, θ24 and θ34, a new

mass splitting, ∆m241, and two new phases, δ14 and δ24. In line with other analyses of

sterile neutrinos in the muon disappearance channel [14–16], θ14 = 0 is assumed, which

also eliminates any dependency on δ14.

Even though a sterile neutrino does not interact as the active flavours, its presence

would still modify the oscillation pattern of the standard neutrinos, due to the fact that the

standard neutrino flavours could oscillate into these additional sterile species. In particular,

can lead to distortions in their survival probability. This is illustrated in figure 1 which

shows the νµ survival probability for maximal mixing of θ23 and different combinations of

the mixing parameters θ24, θ34 and δ24. If only θ34 is non-zero, the survival probability of

νµ with respect to the non-sterile hypothesis is only modified close to the first oscillation

minimum. The case of both θ24 and θ34 being non-zero leads instead to a significant shift of

the first oscillation minimum in energy (depending on δ24) and modifies the event rate up

to energies of few hundred GeV, easily accessible with ANTARES. The fast wiggles due to

∆m241 = 0.5 eV
2 will be smeared out by detector resolution effects, therefore no sensitivity

to this parameter is expected. The surprisingly strong effect of δ24 on the νµ survival

probability, neglected in all similar analyses so far, is further detailed in the appendix.

Since the effect of an additional sterile neutrino would be visible in the same energy

and zenith range as the νµ disappearance, the same analysis chain and data sample can be

exploited to constrain the 3+1 neutrino model parameters. In this paper, the results of an

investigation aiming to constrain the mixing angles θ24 and θ34 of the 3+1 neutrino model

are also reported.

The paper is organised as follows: in section 2 the ANTARES neutrino telescope is

briefly described and its detection principle is illustrated; the ANTARES data sample as

well as the Monte Carlo (MC) chain are presented in section 3, while the event recon-

struction is discussed in section 4. Section 5 is dedicated to the event selection and the

minimisation procedure. The results are presented in section 6, while conclusions are given

in section 7.

2 The ANTARES neutrino telescope

The ANTARES neutrino telescope is located in the Mediterranean Sea, 40 km off the

coast of Toulon, France, at a mooring depth of about 2475 m. The detector was com-

pleted in 2008. ANTARES is composed of 12 detection lines, each one equipped with 25

storeys of 3 optical modules (OMs), except line 12 with only 20 storeys of OMs, for a

total of 885 OMs. The horizontal spacing among the lines is ∼ 60 m, while the vertical
spacing between the storeys is 14.5 m. Each OM hosts a 10-inch photomultiplier tube

(PMT) from Hamamatsu [17], whose axis points 45◦ downwards. All signals from the

PMTs that pass a threshold of 0.3 single photoelectrons (hits) are digitised and sent to the

shore station [18, 19]. The on-shore trigger system [20] performs a hit selection based on

causality relations and builds events under the hypothesis that the selected hits originate

from Cherenkov radiation induced by relativistic charged particles as they are produced in

neutrino interactions close to the ANTARES instrumented volume.

The main sources of optical background registered by the ANTARES PMTs are rep-

resented by Cherenkov light from decay products of the radioactive isotope 40K, naturally

present in sea-water, by light emitted through bioluminescence by living organisms, and

by energetic atmospheric muons, which can penetrate deeply under the sea and reach the

detector from above.

3 ANTARES data and Monte Carlo samples

ANTARES data collected from 2007 to 2016 have been considered in the analysis. After

excluding data acquired under adverse conditions, a total of 2830 days of live time has

been evaluated.

The aim of the MC production is to reproduce in the most realistic way the events

expected at the detector, as well as the response of the apparatus when recording these

events. In order to account for changes of the environmental conditions, as well as for

the different operational status of the detector and its components over time, a run-by-

run MC approach is applied [21]. A typical run lasts few hours. Several time dependent

conditions are taken from real data and applied to the run-by-run MC. First, temporarily

or permanently non-operational OMs are masked in the simulation. Secondly, background

light conditions, which might vary due to bioluminescence, are measured every 104 ms

for each individual OM. These samples are directly used as input for the background

light simulation. Thirdly, individual OM efficiencies are considered, as calculated on an

approximately weekly basis from 40K coincidence rates [22]. Finally, the acoustics based

position calibration, performed every few minutes, is applied. All these detailed inputs

assure an authentic description of the detector response for each individual run. Remaining

uncertainties are small and can be handled as global parameters which are discussed below.

They are included in the analysis as systematic uncertainties.

Neutrino interactions of all flavours have been simulated with the GENHEN [23] pack-

age, developed inside the ANTARES Collaboration. It allows to reproduce neutrino in-

teractions in the GeV to multi-PeV energy range. MC neutrino events can be weighted

to reproduce different physical expectations. For atmospheric neutrinos with Eν ∈ [20–
100] GeV, a MC sample almost three hundreds times larger than the data sample is avail-

able. The model by Honda et al. [24] for the Fréjus site is used in this work.

Even though the sub-marine location of ANTARES provides a good shielding against

atmospheric muons, still a large amount of them will reach the detector. The event gen-

erator used in ANTARES to simulate atmospheric muons is MUPAGE [25]; the energy

and angular distributions, as well as the multiplicity of muons propagating in sea water

are parameterised. The contribution from this background is also evaluated from the data

itself.

Particle propagation and Cherenkov light production are simulated using a GEANT-

based [26] package [23], which takes into account all relevant physics processes and com-

putes the probability that photons emitted by a particle reach the OM surface, producing

a hit. Finally the detector response is simulated, including the digitisation and filtering of

hits. At this stage a realistic optical noise is added on each OM for each data acquisition

run of the detector, and the time evolution of the detector configuration is accounted for

as described above.

4 Event reconstruction

Charged-current (CC) interactions of muon neutrinos produce a muon propagating through

the detector and inducing Cherenkov light. They are identified as track-like events. The

event reconstruction and selection used in the analysis have been optimised to select such

events. On the other hand, νe CC interactions, as well as neutral-current interactions (NC)

of all flavours produce hadronic showers. In the case of νe CC interactions an electromag-

netic shower is produced as well. Moreover, ντ CC events can be produced as the result of

νµ → ντ oscillations with and without muons in the final state. All these events constitute
an additional source of background for this study.

Events have been reconstructed using two different algorithms, described in detail

in [27, 28]. In the following discussion these algorithms will be referred to as method A
and method B, respectively. Both are optimised for events induced by GeV-scale νµ CC
interactions. In method A a hit selection, based on time and spatial coincidences of hits, is
applied and a χ2-fit is performed in order to find the best track. Events can have a single-

line topology (SL), if all the selected hits have been recorded in the same detector line, or

a multi-line topology (ML), when hits belong to OMs of different lines. Method B consists
of a chain of fits, aimed to improve at each step the track estimation. Starting from a hit

selection, a first prefit, based on a directional scan with a large number of isotropically

distributed directions, is performed. The best 9 directions are used as starting points for

the final likelihood (logL) fit.
Once the muon track has been reconstructed, its length, Lµ, is computed. This is done,

for ML events, by projecting back to the track the first and last selected hit. For SL events,

– 5 –

since a vertex estimation is not possible due to the lack of azimuth information, the track

length is estimated from the z-coordinates of the uppermost and lowermost storey which

have recorded the selected hits and taking into account the reconstructed zenith angle.

The muon energy estimation is based on the fact that muons in the few-GeV energy

range can be treated as minimum ionising particles, and their energy can be estimated

from their track length Lµ:

Ereco = Lµ × 0.24 GeV/m , (4.1)

where the factor 0.24 GeV/m represents the energy loss of muons in sea water in the

energy range of 10–100 GeV [29]. This quantity is used in the following as estimator for

the neutrino energy. The energy resolution of fully contained muons is dominated by the

spacing of the detector elements and is found to be around 5 GeV. For muons leaving the

detector only a lower limit for their energy can be derived, corresponding to their visible

length inside the instrumented volume. More details on the muon energy resolution can

be found in [10].

5 Analysis

To achieve the best sensitivity to the measurement of the oscillation parameters, a set of

quality criteria has been applied. The selection of νµ CC events has been optimised by

performing a preliminary Monte Carlo (MC) sensitivity study, before applying the whole

analysis chain to data.

The main parameter on which the selection is based is the reduced χ2 for method A and
the logL for method B. Events reconstructed by method A and passing the corresponding
event selection are kept. The events discarded by this procedure are further reconstructed

by method B; they are kept in the analysed sample if the corresponding selection criteria
are passed. Only events which are reconstructed as up-going are used in the following. A

minimum number of five storeys with selected hits is required, in order to minimise the

background induced by atmospheric muons.

In figure 2 the distribution of the MC true neutrino energy, ET, for selected νµ CC

events is shown. For the histogram with the solid line no neutrino oscillations are assumed,

while the dashed one refers to a 2-flavour oscillation scenario with maximal mixing and

∆m232 = 2.46 × 10
−3 eV2. As can be seen, atmospheric neutrino oscillations affect the

expected event distribution for ET . 100 GeV. About 7590 well-reconstructed νµ CC
events are expected in a live time of 2830 days when oscillations are neglected. Roughly

one half of these events are reconstructed with method A (ML), while methods A (SL)
and B both contribute with approximately 25% to this event sample. Further, ∼ 40 νe
CC events are selected. Oscillations reduce the number of expected events by ∼ 720
events. This reduction is dominantly seen in the A (SL) sample (∼ 60%) which contains
the lowest energetic and most vertical events, while the other two reconstruction methods

contribute each about 20%. ντ CC events reduce this oscillation signal by ∼ 20 events,
taking into account the energy-dependent cross section ratio σ(ντ CC)/σ(νµ CC) (about

spectrum of the produced muons.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the reduced χ2SL for method A (SL) events where
data are compared to simulated atmospheric neutrinos and background atmospheric muons.

While the MC reproduces quite well the data in the signal region dominated by the neutrino

signal, a disagreement between the MC expectation and data is visible for larger χ2SL.

Both data and MC follow an exponential law in this region, but with different slopes. For

this reason, the number of background atmospheric muons in the signal region has been

determined from data itself. The distribution in figure 3 has been parameterised in the

region dominated by atmospheric muons (χ2SL > 0.8) with four different exponential fits

by varying the fit range. Each fit has been extrapolated into the signal region, and its

corresponding integral has been computed. The mean of these integrals has been used

to estimate the number of atmospheric muon background, and its uncertainty has been

computed from the errors on the fitted function parameters. Summing up the results

of this method for events that have been reconstructed by method A (SL and ML) and
method B, and combining the corresponding errors in quadrature, a total background of
740 ± 120 atmospheric muons has been determined. This value is subsequently used as a
Gaussian prior mean value and uncertainty in the minimisation procedure. The energy and

direction distribution of the atmospheric muon background has been, instead, estimated

directly from MC.

After applying the event selection criteria described above on the data sample, a total

of 7710 events have been selected, 1950 from method A (SL), 3682 from method A (ML)
and 2078 from method B. In figure 4 the event distribution as a function of the logarithm

function converges to the standard χ2 for bins with high statistics. For bins with a small

number of entries the log-likelihood is more adequate.

Since the treatment of the systematic uncertainties slightly differs between the stan-

dard atmospheric oscillation analysis and the sterile neutrino analysis, they are described

separately in the following subsections.

5.1 Treatment of systematics for the standard oscillation analysis

The standard oscillation analysis accounts for six sources of systematic uncertainties. Three

are related to the atmospheric neutrino flux. A global neutrino normalisation factor, nν ,

which is left unconstrained during the fit, accounts for uncertainties on the total number

of expected events. A variation ∆γ in the nominal neutrino flux spectral index has been

used as additional nuisance parameter. Uncertainties on the neutrino/anti-neutrino flux

ratio, ν/ν̄, and on the flux asymmetry between up-going and horizontal neutrinos, νup/νhor,

have also been taken into account. These uncertainties [30] have been parametrised by the

IceCube Collaboration [31]. Such parameterisations compute a correction on the number

of expected events as a function of the neutrino energy, flavour, chirality, direction and the

value of the uncertainty on the flux ratio. The two ratios considered in this analysis have

been found to be strongly correlated, thus a unique nuisance parameter is considered in

the fit.

An additional source of systematic uncertainty is the limited knowledge of the neutrino

interaction model. At the energy of interest for this study, the cross section is dominated

by deep inelastic scattering (DIS), with a smaller contribution from quasi elastic (QE) and

resonant (RES) scattering. Uncertainties in the DIS cross section can be incorporated in

the global flux normalisation factor nν , as well as in the correction to the spectral index

∆γ. For what concerns the QE and RES processes, dedicated studies have been performed

with gSeaGen [32], which uses GENIE [33] to model neutrino interactions. The dominant

systematic is found to be related to the axial mass for CC resonance neutrino production,

MA. Its default value is 1.12 ± 0.22 GeV [33]. By varying this parameter by ±1σ, the
correction with respect to the expected number of events has been computed as a function

of the true neutrino energy and this parameterisation is used in the final fit.

Apart from the oscillation parameters under investigation, ∆m232 and θ23, the other

oscillation parameters may play a role, but their effect is limited for this study. In partic-

ular, θ13 is left free in the fit but treated with a Gaussian prior at θ13 = (8.41 ± 0.28)◦,
which is taken from a global fit [34] as well as the values of the solar neutrino parameters,

which are kept fixed: ∆m221 = 7.37×10
−5 eV2 and sin2 θ12 = 0.297. Different values of δCP

have been tested at the stage of the MC sensitivity study and found to have no impact on

the final result. Therefore δCP is fixed at zero.

The number of atmospheric muons, Nµ, contaminating the neutrino sample, is treated

as an additional nuisance parameter. Its value and uncertainty, determined with the data-

driven technique, are used as a prior.

Finally, detector and sea water related systematics have been studied as well. Dedi-

cated MC simulations have been generated with modified OM photon detection efficiencies

and a modified water absorption length, assuming a variation of ±10% from the nominal
value, but keeping the same wavelength dependence. The overall OM efficiency can be

easily adjusted to the measured coincidence rates from 40K decays [22] which makes the

chosen 10% variations a conservative benchmark value, in line with early studies performed

on ANTARES OMs [17]. The water absorption length had been measured several times at

the ANTARES site [35]. The different measurements, taken at two different wavelengths,

vary within about 10%.

The correction to the event rates, obtained by dividing the event rates from the mod-

ified MC simulation (rvar) and the one from the nominal MC simulation (rnom), has been

computed as a function of the MC neutrino energy and zenith angle for νµ CC events,

reconstructed as up-going. While no zenith-dependent effect is seen, the energy response

of the detector is affected by these variations. The resulting distributions have been fitted,

in the energy range 10–103 GeV, with a function of the form:

f�(ET) = A� · (ET/E0)B� , (5.2)

where ET is the MC true neutrino energy, A�, B� are the two fitted parameters describing

the effect of the modified OM photon detection efficiencies and E0 = 100 GeV defines the

reference energy for A�. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the event ratios as a function

of true neutrino energy, together with its parameterisation.

The effect of the modified water absorption length is described by the same functional

form of eq. (5.2) using Aw and Bw as the corresponding fit parameters. The values of the

fitted parameters A�, B�, Aw and Bw are listed in table 1. The effects of A� and Aw are

taken into account in the minimisation procedure by the global normalisation factor, nν ,

which is left unconstrained, while B� and Bw are covered by the uncertainty of the prior

on the spectral index, ∆γ (see table 2).

5.2 Treatment of systematics for the sterile oscillation analysis

For the sterile analysis, the flux as well as the cross section related systematic uncertainties

are treated in the same way as described in the previous subsection.

Since the effect of a sterile neutrino would modify the oscillation pattern in a similar

way as ∆m232 and θ23 do, these parameters are considered to be one of the sources of

systematic uncertainty for this analysis. Both ∆m232 and θ23 are left unconstrained as

recommended in [36]. The other standard oscillation parameters are treated as previously

discussed.

As discussed in section 1, the addition of a sterile neutrino in the model implies six new

mixing parameters to be accounted for. The mixing angle θ14 and its associated phase δ14
have been fixed at zero, since they mainly affect the νe channel. The fast oscillations due

to ∆m241 & 0.5 eV
2 are unobservable due to the limited energy resolution of the detector,

making ∆m241 not measurable. It has been kept fixed at 0.5 eV
2. The choice of the neutrino

mass hierarchy (NMH) as well as δ24 are expected to impact the result. Therefore both

normal and inverted hierarchy (NH/IH) and various values of δ24 have been tested during

the fit. Furthermore, to ensure the stability of the fit procedure, the atmospheric muon

contamination has been fixed at the value found by the standard oscillation analysis. It

has been verified that this choice does not lead to better constraints with respect to the

case of a free muon contamination.

6 Results

The minimisation procedure has been done using the ROOT package Minuit2 [37], applied

to the function introduced in equation (5.1). Results are presented in the following subsec-

tions, for the standard oscillation analysis and the sterile oscillation analysis, respectively.

6.1 Results for the standard oscillation analysis

In table 2 the complete list of all the fitted parameters for the standard oscillation analysis

is shown, together with their best-fit values and their priors. Due to the high energy

threshold of ANTARES this analysis is not sensitive to the NMH. The results hold for

both NH and IH. The best-fit value is found for ∆m232 at (2.0
+0.4
−0.3) × 10

−3 eV2, which is

compatible with the current world best-fit value [38]. The mixing angle θ23 is found to

be compatible with maximal mixing within its error. The global normalisation factor for

neutrinos, nν , is found to be 18% lower. This value is within the atmospheric neutrino

flux uncertainties and it is compatible with what was reported by other analyses [31]. A

non-negligible pull is found on ν/ν̄. This parameter seems to compensate for the low value

of nν : this has been derived from an alternative fit, for which all nuisance parameters

but nν have been fixed, to allow a more direct comparison with the result reported in [10].

Under these conditions nν = 1.04±0.02 is found. Concerning the spectral index correction,
∆γ, no significant distortion from the nominal value is observed. The fitted value for the

atmospheric muon contamination shows a strong pull and it is found incidentally close

to the MC expectations. For both θ13 and MA the best fit values and their errors are

found at the corresponding prior, which indicates no sensitivity to these parameters. This

can be understood as the νµ survival probability does not depend on sin θ13 but only on

cos θ13 = 0.99 (see eq. (1.1)) whereas MA mainly affects neutrinos with energies below the

detection threshold of ANTARES.

The distribution of the ratio between the reconstructed energy and the cosine of the

reconstructed zenith is shown in figure 6. This ratio is affected by the oscillation phe-

nomenon as can be seen for the lowest values of Ereco/ cos θreco. For comparison, also the

distribution of MC assuming no neutrino oscillation, as well as the one assuming the world

best-fit values [38] are shown. The latter two are calculated with all nuisance parameters at

their nominal values. Such a 1D distribution does not carry the full information exploited

in the fit, which is performed on the 2D distribution shown in figure 4. While compati-

ble with world data, ANTARES results seem to prefer a somewhat shallower (or energy

shifted) oscillation minimum.

In figure 7 the 90% CL contour obtained in this work, in the plane of sin2 θ23 and

∆m232, is compared to those published by other experiments. The 1D projections, after

profiling over the other variable, are shown as well. Confidence level contours have been

computed by looping over a fine grid of values in ∆m232 and θ23 and minimising the negative

log-likelihood over all the other parameters.

The non-oscillation hypothesis has been tested by performing the minimisation with

a fixed null value of the oscillation parameters, and it is discarded with a significance of

4.6σ, compared to 2.3σ in our previous analysis [10].

6.2 Results for the sterile oscillation analysis

In table 3 the complete list of all the fitted parameters for the sterile oscillation analysis

for NH and IH is shown, together with their best-fit values and their priors. While θ24
is found to be compatible with zero, the best fit for θ34 is found at a non-zero value.

This can be understood from the slight preference of the ANTARES data for a shallower

oscillation dip (see discussion related to figure 6), which can be easily provided by a non-

zero value of sin θ34 (see figure 1). The non-sterile hypothesis is found at −2∆ logL = 4.4
which corresponds to a 2-parameter p-value of 11%. The fitted values of ∆m232 and θ23 are

slightly different but consistent with respect to the ones obtained in the standard oscillation

analysis. The complex phase δ24 is found at 180
◦. For IH instead the fit prefers δ24 = 0

analysis is observed.

and δCP = 0
◦ which allow a direct comparison with the results from IceCube/DeepCore [16]

(NH) and Super-Kamiokande [15]. All three experiments find the best fit for |Uτ4|2 to differ
from zero. Our results exclude regions of the parameter space not yet excluded by other

experiments.

The IceCube/DeepCore analysis [16] is limited to events with reconstructed energy

lower than 56 GeV, while the distortion on the oscillation pattern possibly produced by

the presence of a sterile neutrino would be evident also at higher reconstructed energies.

The present analysis includes events with reconstructed energy up to 100 GeV. It has

been verified that the ANTARES limits degrade when restricting the analysis to events

with Ereco < 56 GeV. In this work both of the standard atmospheric oscillation parameters

∆m232 and sin
2(2θ23) are left unconstrained in line with the IceCube/DeepCore analysis [16].

After profiling over the other variable, the following limits on the two matrix elements

can be derived:

|Uµ4|2 < 0.007 (0.13) at 90% (99%) CL , (6.1)
|Uτ4|2 < 0.40 (0.68) at 90% (99%) CL . (6.2)

7 Conclusions

Ten years of ANTARES data have been analysed to provide a measurement of the atmo-

spheric neutrino oscillation parameters. The analysis chain has been optimised with respect

to our previously published study, by combining two track reconstruction algorithms and

introducing a more elaborate treatment of various sources of systematic uncertainties. The

results, ∆m232 = (2.0
+0.4
−0.3) × 10

−3 eV2 and θ23 = (45
+12
−11)

◦, are consistent with what has

been published by other experiments. The non-oscillation hypothesis is discarded with a

significance of 4.6σ.

Exploiting the same analysis chain and the same data set, a further study has allowed

to constrain, for the first time with ANTARES, the parameter space of the 3+1 neutrino

model, which foresees the existence of one sterile neutrino. ANTARES excludes values of

the parameter space not yet excluded by other experiments.

A Sterile neutrinos and matter effects

For the analysis presented in this paper, oscillation probabilities are evaluated with the

software package OscProb [8]. However, in this appendix some common approximations

are applied, to derive analytical formulae. These are NOT used for the analysis itself but

allow to get a better understanding of the interplay between different parameters. The νµ

survival probability in vacuum in the 3 + 1 model can be simplified with the following two

hypotheses [15, 43]: first, it is assumed, that the first generation decouples completely, i.e.

∆m221 = 0 and θ12 = θ13 = 0; second, fast wiggles due to oscillations involving m4 are

assumed to be unobservable, i.e. sin2(∆m24iL/4E) = 1/2 for all i. This yields

Pνµ→νµ = (1− |Uµ4|

with P
(3)
µµ the νµ survival probability in the 3-flavour scheme, i.e. without additional ster-

ile neutrinos. Only |Uµ4|2 = sin2 θ24 can be probed in this scheme, which is applied in
most accelerator based νµ disappearance analyses. However, when analysing atmospheric

neutrinos, matter effects cannot be neglected. An analytical formalism is developped in

eqs. (4.13)–(4.25) of [15]. In eq. (4.13), a complex phase is present in the non-diagonal

term of the matrix, which is neglected, i.e. set to zero, in subsequent steps. If instead this

phase is kept, sin 2θs in eq. (4.16) acquires an extra term exp(−iδ).

sin 2θs =

|Uµ4|2|Uτ4|2(1− |Uµ4|2 − |Uτ4|2)
(1− |Uµ4|2)(|Uµ4|2 + |Uτ4|2)

cos 2θs =
|Uτ4|2 − |Uµ4|2(1− |Uµ4|2 − |Uτ4|2)

(1− |Uµ4|2)(|Uµ4|2 + |Uτ4|2)
. (A.3)

This in turn modifies eqs. (4.18) and eq. (4.19):

E2m = A

For δ = 0 the original expressions from [15] are reproduced. With A32 = ∆m

32/Eν and

As =
√

GFNn(|Uµ4|2 + |Uτ4|2)/2 (GF the Fermi constant and Nn the neutron density)

the νµ survival probability in matter is fully defined and can be written equivalently to

eq. (A.1) (see also eq. (4.23) of [15]):

Pνµ→νµ = (1− |Uµ4|
2)2
(
1− sin2 2θm sin2(EmL)

)
+ |Uµ4|4, (A.6)

which describes well all features shown in figure 1. The impact of the CP-phase δ disappears

when either |Uµ4|2 = 0 or |Uτ4|2 = 0, which leads to sin 2θs = 0. Further, δ → δ + π is
completely degenerate with changing the mass hierarchy, i.e. swapping the sign of A32 if

either cos 2θ23 = 0 or cos 2θs = 0. Deviation from maximal mixing in θ23 or from the

symmetry between |Uµ4|2 and |Uτ4|2 defining θs breaks this degeneracy. The impact of
the neutrino mass hierarchy on the νµ survival probability in matter had been pointed out

already in [44], while the influence of complex phases is also discussed in [45].
