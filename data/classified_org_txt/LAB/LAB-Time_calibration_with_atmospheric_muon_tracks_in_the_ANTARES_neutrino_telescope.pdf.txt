Abstract

The ANTARES experiment consists of an array of photomultipliers distributed along 12

lines and located deep underwater in the Mediterranean Sea. It searches for astrophysical

neutrinos collecting the Cherenkov light induced by the charged particles, mainly muons, pro-

duced in neutrino interactions around the detector. Since at energies of ∼10 TeV the muon

and the incident neutrino are almost collinear, it is possible to use the ANTARES detector

as a neutrino telescope and identify a source of neutrinos in the sky starting from a precise

reconstruction of the muon trajectory. To get this result, the arrival times of the Cherenkov

photons must be accurately measured. A to perform time calibrations with the precision re-

quired to have optimal performances of the instrument is described. The reconstructed tracks

of the atmospheric muons in the ANTARES detector are used to determine the relative time

offsets between photomultipliers. Currently, this method is used to obtain the time calibration

constants for photomultipliers on different lines at a precision level of 0.5 ns. It has also been

validated for calibrating photomultipliers on the same line, using a system of LEDs and laser

light devices.

1 Introduction

The ANTARES neutrino telescope [1] aims at the exploration of the high-energy Universe by using
neutrinos as cosmic probes. One of the main goals of the experiment is the discovery of point-like
sources of cosmic neutrinos. Typically, searches for sources of neutrinos are performed using the
reconstructed directions of selected events. In this sense, a good angular resolution, i.e., the angle

2



between the direction of the reconstructed muon and of the neutrino, is of great importance to better
discriminate between the signal and the background. At energies ∼ 10 TeV the median value of the
angular resolution in the ANTARES detector, as determined with simulations, is ∼ 0.4◦ [2].

In the energy range of interest, the angular resolution is driven by the reconstruction accuracy.
Since the reconstruction algorithm depends on the precise measurement of the photon arrival times
on the photomultipliers (PMTs), an accurate detector time calibration is crucial to guarantee the
best performance of the telescope. In particular, the precision in the measurement of the relative
PMT timings is required to be ∼ 1 ns [3].

In this paper, the methods to perform the time calibration of the detector at this level of accuracy
and to determine the calibration constants used in the physics analyses of the ANTARES collab-
oration are presented. The method is based on the reconstructed trajectories of the down going
atmospheric muons, which are the main source of physical triggers for a neutrino telescope. This
calibration method does not require the physics data acquisition to be stopped and does not rely
on additional electronic devices. It was initially implemented for the first ANTARES point-source
analysis [4].

The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 a brief description of the ANTARES detector
is presented. The calibration method is introduced in Section 3. In the fourth Section the recon-
struction method used in the point-like source search, and in the majority of the physics analyses
in ANTARES, is described. In Sections 5 and 6 the derivation of the calibration constants is de-
scribed in detail. In Section 7 the results are discussed and compared to the results obtained with
an independent system of calibration that uses an array of optical beacons [5]. A summary and the
conclusions are given in Section 8.

2 The ANTARES detector

ANTARES is the first deep-sea neutrino telescope in operation in the world. Anchored at a depth of
2475 m in the Mediterranean Sea, 40 km off the coast of Toulon (France), the detector comprises 885
PMTs distributed on a three-dimensional array made up by 12 flexible lines, each of them 480 m long,
which are arranged on an octogonal layout with an interline separation of 60-75 m. Each line holds
triplets of PMTs and the control electronics boards needed for the power supply and data control
at this level, at 25 vertical positions (storeys). The first storey of each line is placed 100 m above
the seabed and the distance between adjacent storeys is 14.5 m. Each PMT (10” photocathode,
model R7081-20 of Hamamatsu [6]), hosted in a high-pressure-resistant glass sphere together with
high-voltage power supplies and internal calibration tools, constitues an optical module (OM) [7].

The electronics boards are enclosed in a titanium container, the local control module. The
main electronic components are the analogue ring sampler (ARS) circuits [8], which perform the
digitisation of the electronic signals produced in the PMTs, providing information on amplitude,
arrival time and signal shape. Two ARSs per OM work in a token ring configuration to minimise
the acquisition dead time. Inside each ARS, an amplitude-to-voltage converter is used for the signal
charge integration, and a time-to-voltage converter allows the measurement of hit times with a
sub-nanosecond precision.

The 12 ANTARES detection lines are connected to a junction box that, through an electro-
optical cable about 40 km long, links the detector to the shore station and provides the power and
control signals needed for the full apparatus. All the signals passing a threshold condition, referred
to as L0 trigger and typically set to 0.3 photoelectrons, activate the digitisation and the sending of
the hit time and the integrated charge of the signal to the shore station [9]. They are then processed
with a cluster of computers by applying a data-filter algorithm looking for space-time correlated hits

consistent with a specific physics signal to mitigate the effect of optical background. Finally, the
detector includes a set of additional instruments for calibration purposes, such as hydrophones for
the positioning system and optical beacons for timing calibration. In particular, the optical beacons
system consists of a series of LED and laser light devices which are distributed along the detector
to illuminate the PMTs.

3 Time calibration in ANTARES

An accurate muon track reconstruction requires a precise determination of the arrival times of the
photons on the PMTs. In particular, all the PMTs have to be synchronised to within ∼1 ns. The
main uncertainties on the measured hit times come from the transit time spread of the PMTs and
the optical properties of sea water. In the ANTARES experiment, the first time calibration [3] of
the PMTs was performed at the integration laboratories before the deployment of each line. A
laser device sending light to the PMTs through an optical fiber was used. After correcting for the
propagation delay within the line, the time offsets between each ARS and an ARS chosen as a
reference were calculated. These offsets defined a first set of time calibration parameters, usually
referred to as the ARS T0 or the intra line calibration parameters. These values were stored in the
ANTARES database and used for the prompt data analysis after deployment.

The value of ARS T0 measured in the laboratory may change after the line deployment due to,
e.g., variations in the environmental conditions. Therefore, a system allowing for the in situ time
calibration of the detector and the monitoring of the calibration constants is needed. The optical
beacon system can be used to perform the relative time calibration of the optical sensors. There are
two kinds of optical beacons: the LED beacons and the laser beacons. The LED optical beacons
consist of 36 individual blue LED light sources arranged in groups of six on electronic boards placed
side by side, forming a hexagonal prism, enclosed in a glass container. Four LED optical beacons are
positioned regularly (in the 2nd, 9th, 15th and 21st storeys from the bottom) on each detector line.
The non-consecutive LED optical beacon pairs within a line are fired simultaneously at maximum
intensity during a calibration run. In total, 24 runs of 5 minutes duration are taken once per month.
The runs are analysed later to check and update (if needed) the ARS T0 parameters.

In order to measure the relative offsets between the detector lines (inter line calibration), one
laser beacon is placed at the bottom of a central line. This device consists of a Nd-YAG laser, which
emits green light in high-intensity short pulses (FWHM ∼1 ns) illuminating up to the 10th floor of
every detector line. Currently, one laser beacon run of 5-10 minutes duration is taken every month.
However, it is important to complement this system with the method proposed here, as mentioned
in Sec. 6.

4 Track reconstruction

The muon track reconstruction algorithm [10] used by ANTARES both for physics analyses and
for timing calibration consists of several fitting procedures that are performed consecutively. In the
final step, estimates of all the parameters needed to describe the event trajectory are obtained by
maximising the likelihood function

L(
−→
d ,−→p ) =

∏

P (ti|t

−→

L is the product of the likelihood, P , of the individual hits accounting for the probability of the time
of the hits, where ~p indicates a point in the muon track direction ~d at a time t0 and ti indicates the
measured hit time. tth is the expected hit time given by

~q after travelling the light-grey line path. l and k indicate the components of the vector ~v = ~q − ~p
in the parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to ~q, respectively.

derived from a given set of parameters (see Fig. 1), namely the position, ~q, of the PMT which
has detected the Cherenkov photon; the components of the vector ~v = ~q − ~p in the parallel, l,
and perpendicular, k, directions to the muon track; the group velocity of light, vg; the angle of the
Cherenkov light, θc; and the speed of light in vacuum, c.

The likelihood in Eq. 1 can be expressed in terms of the probability density of the time residuals
ri = ti − t

th
i . The probability density function used for the likelihood fit is obtained from simula-

tions, and takes into account the contribution from hits arriving late due to Cherenkov emission by
secondary particles and/or light scattering, and the effect of the transit time spread of the PMT.
The probability of a hit being due to background is also accounted for.

The quality of the track fit is quantified by the parameter

Λ =
log(L)

NDOF
+ 0.1(Ncomp − 1), (3)

which incorporates the maximum likelihood value L, the number of degrees of freedom in the fit
NDOF = Nhits − 5, equal to the number of hits used minus the number of free parameters. Ncomp
is the number of compatible solutions found by the maximization algorithm, which in general takes
large values for well-reconstructed tracks and small ones for badly reconstructed events. The Λ
parameter is a useful tool to reject badly reconstructed events, mainly down going atmospheric
muons misreconstructed as up going. Moreover, the uncertainty on the reconstructed track direction
is used for further event selection. Assuming that the likelihood function near the fitted maximum
follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, the error on the zenith (βθ) and azimuth (βφ) angles
can be derived from the likelihood fit covariance error matrix. From these errors, the parameter

β =
√

referred to as the angular error estimate, is obtained, where θrec is the reconstructed zenith angle.
A cut on the angular error estimate is highly efficient for signal events and removes a large fraction
of misreconstructed atmospheric muons [10].

5 Time calibration with muon tracks: method

The reconstructed trajectories of the down going muons produced in cosmic-ray interactions in the
atmosphere are used for the time calibration of the ANTARES detector. These are collected at
a rate of ∼5 Hz. The method is an iterative procedure that uses the time residual distributions
obtained for a subset of hits which are not used in the track fit. The complete procedure consists of
the following steps:

1. A subset of hits (the probe hits), which were registered by the ARS or were within the line
under investigation, is selected. These hits are not used in the track fit.

2. The muon trajectory is reconstructed using only the remaining hits (the reco hits).

3. Time residuals for the probe hits are calculated with respect to the fitted track.

4. A Gaussian function is fitted to the peak of the probe hit time residuals distribution (an
example is given in Fig. 2), the mean value of which is taken as the time correction to be
applied to the hit times for a new iteration of the method.

The exclusion of the probe hits guarantees that the resulting time residual distributions are not
biased, since the muon track has not been fitted to minimise them. If the subset of probe hits
includes only those collected on one single ARS, the so-called intra line calibration is performed.
If it includes those collected on one detection line, the inter line calibration is performed. This
procedure is repeated until the time corrections are small (∼ 0.5 ns). The reconstructed muon
tracks used for the time residuals are affected by the time corrections applied; at each new iteration,
the number of high quality reconstructed events increases with the number of iterations until the
method converges to an optimal solution. Fig. 3 shows how fast this solution convertes to its noise
limit of 0.5 ns when applying the method to determine the time offsets between different detection
lines. In the same figure it is also shown how the median value of the fit quality distribution increases
with the number of iterations of the method.

6 Results on the inter line timing

The inter line calibration corrects the time offsets with respect to a common reference for the full
detector. Since at the integration laboratories the time calibration is only performed at the line level,
this is the most important calibration performed off-shore. Indeed, the first hint of the existence of
time offsets between the lines of the ANTARES detector was found when studying the distributions
of the quality reconstruction parameter Λ. A large discrepancy between data and Monte Carlo
simulations1 was found for tracks crossing the detector diagonally and inducing hits on several lines,
whereas nearly vertical tracks, the reconstruction of which is single-line dominated, showed better
agreement.

1In the ANTARES collaboration, the generation of atmospheric neutrinos is performed with the GENHEN package
[11] using the Bartol model [12], while the atmospheric muons are produced with MUPAGE [13].

A Gaussian function is fitted to each distribution around the position of the peak. The RMS of
the distribution decreases, and the number of entries increases, with increasing iterations, since the
timing corrections applied at each new iteration have a positive effect on the event reconstruction.

Table 1: Inter line offsets measured with the track residual method. These values are currently used
for data processing.

In order to determine the time offsets, the method described in the previous section is here applied
to data recorded with 12 detection lines in a few days of data-taking from March 2010. Other periods
have been studied (November 2010, April 2011, March 2012) with no significant differences in the
time offsets. Good quality events (only tracks fitted with Λ > −6.0) were used. Fig. 2 shows the
time residuals distribution, after one (left) and after six (right) iterations of the method, for hits
detected on line 8, which is one of the central lines of the ANTARES detector. The range of the
Gaussian fit applied to these histograms was chosen in order to avoid the contribution from scattered
photons and to match the most Gaussian-like region of the residuals distribution.

The inter line constants determined for the 12 detection lines are summarised in Table 1. These
are the values normally used in ANTARES analyses.

6.1 Impact on the reconstruction and on the angular resolution.

After the application of the corrected inter line timing, an improvement in the quality of the recon-
struction was observed with an increase of the number of events with high Λ values. The improvement
was particularly important (see Fig. 4) for events reconstructed on several lines, while for vertically
down going events, which are mainly single-line reconstructed, the improvement was smaller, as
expected. The agreement of the distributions of the Λ parameter for data and simulated events
improved after the timing calibration correction by ∼ 15% for well-reconstructed tracks

In order to study the effect of the inter line time shifts on the detector resolution, offsets of
the same amounts as the values listed in Table 1 were added to the hit times of simulated events
and the reconstructed tracks compared to the results of reconstruction from the usual simulation.
Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the angular difference, Ψ, between the reconstructed track direction
and the generated one for the default Monte Carlo simulation and for events reconstructed using
mis-calibrated lines. Adding the offsets results in a resolution degraded by about 40% degraded
resolution for the selected events (Λ > −5.4 , cos θrec > 0.0 and β < 1

◦). The median value of the
distribution worsens from 0.40◦ to 0.55◦ for the studied sample.

6.2 Cross-check with simulations

The precision of the muon time residuals method can be tested using simulations by adding inter line
time offsets in the event reconstruction chain. The same time offsets as in the values summarised
in Table 1 were introduced to distort the timing measured by the lines. The resulting simulated
reconstructed tracks had the muon time residuals method applied to determine the inter line timing
offsets. Fig. 6 shows the measured time offsets compared with the offsets artificially added to
mis-calibrate the lines. The RMS of the distribution is 0.35 ns, which is well within the required
precision.

6.3 Cross-check with the optical beacon system

The laser beacon can also be used as well to determine the time offsets between the detector lines.
This system provides an independent calibration method to cross-check the results obtained using
the information provided by the muon track residuals. For this purpose, a calibration run is taken
every month in the ANTARES detector. The laser, at the bottom of line 8, illuminates the detector
for about 10 minutes. The data are then analysed following a similar procedure to the one applied
for the ARS T0 in-situ calibration [3]. The method is based on the study of the time differences
between the emission of the light pulse and the time when light is detected by the OMs. Time
residuals are calculated by correcting for the required photon propagation time. Gaussian functions
convolved with an exponential are fitted to the time residual distributions. The obtained fit peak
values are then plotted as a function of the distance between the OM and the laser beacon position.
Only those OMs which are illuminated by the laser at the single photoelectron level are used in the

calculation, because for them a constant relation between residual peak positions and distance to
the light source is expected.

In Figure 7 the inter line offsets measured with the laser optical beacon are compared to the
results obtained using the track residuals method. They agree to within 1 ns, except for line 1 and
line 8, which both show a discrepancy larger than 2 ns. The discrepancy for line 1 may be due to the
large distance from the laser optical beacon (line 1 is the farthest), and for line 8, to a shadowing
effect that prevents light from directly reaching the uppermost OMs.

It was found by examining the reconstructed events that the track residuals method is more effi-
cient than the laser optical beacon method, producing a slightly higher number of well reconstructed
tracks (see Figure 8).

7 Results on the intra line timing

The intra line calibration with atmospheric muons is performed by producing time residual distri-
butions for every ARS in the detector. In order to reduce the amount of required data, the first step
in the scheme explained in section 5 is modified to provide probe-hit time residuals for those ARSs
that have registered at least one hit from the current event. Again, the resulting distributions are
fit with a Gaussian function, the mean of which is taken as the time offset of the ARS under study.
As an example, Figure 9 shows the fitted probe-hit residuals distribution for one particular ARS in
line 4 and floor 10.

Since the ARS T0 constants provided by the LED beacon calibration system are taken into account
in the muon track reconstruction, the procedure discussed in this paper provides corrections to the
intra line calibration parameters obtained using the beacons. In Figure 10 the distribution of these
corrections is shown including all ARSs with sufficient statistics after one iteration (left) and after

7.1 Effect on the reconstruction

In order to determine the effect on the reconstruction of the measured ARS time corrections, a
small sample of data runs has been analysed. In Fig. 11 a comparison of the reconstruction qual-
ity parameter for events reconstructed considering the LED beacon calibration (dashed line) and
reconstructed applying the time corrections obtained using the method presented in this paper is
shown. A small increase in the number of high quality events is observed, similar to the findings from
simulations in Section 6.1, after correcting for artificially introduced time offsets. This validates the
intra-line-timing calibration produced with the muon time residuals method. Note also that, while
the LED beacons typically calibrate about one thousand ARSs, the muon tracks method allows the
timing corrections of almost all of the active channels (nearly 1600 in this study) to be obtained.

8 Conclusions

A method for the time calibration of the ANTARES detector based on the reconstruction of atmo-
spheric muons has been presented. It has been used to measure the relative time offsets between
the different detection lines, already measured in the laboratory, with a precision of 1 ns. A cal-
ibrated inter line timing results in a factor of 1.2-2.0 improvement in the number of high-quality
events reconstructed in the zenith angle range −0.8 < cos(θ) < 0, i.e. events traversing the detector
diagonally. It has also been shown that not accounting for the inter line time corrections would
result in a degradation of the expected detector resolution by approximately 40%. A comparison
with a timing calibration results obtained with the laser beacon system shows that the two methods

are compatible to within 1 ns. However, the muon time residuals procedure is more efficient for
the improvement of the quality of reconstructed events and allows the evaluation of the offsets for
two lines that cannot be considered correctly with the laser optical beacon. The muon time resid-
uals method has also been applied to measure corrections for the intra line timing constants first
determined using the system of LED optical beacons. The results show a slight improvement in the
quality of the reconstruction. The calibration explained here is applied in ANTARES analyses.
