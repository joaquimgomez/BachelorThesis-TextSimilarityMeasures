Abstract

A search for high-energy neutrino emission correlated with gamma-ray bursts outside the elec-
tromagnetic prompt-emission time window is presented. Using a stacking approach of the time
delays between reported gamma-ray burst alerts and spatially coincident muon-neutrino signa-
tures, data from the Antares neutrino telescope recorded between 2007 and 2012 are analysed.
One year of public data from the IceCube detector between 2008 and 2009 have been also investi-
gated. The respective timing profiles are scanned for statistically significant accumulations within
40 days of the Gamma Ray Burst, as expected from Lorentz Invariance Violation effects and some
astrophysical models. No significant excess over the expected accidental coincidence rate could be
found in either of the two data sets. The average strength of the neutrino signal is found to be
fainter than one detectable neutrino signal per hundred gamma-ray bursts in the Antares data
at 90% confidence level.

1 Introduction

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most
powerful sources in the universe, which makes
them suitable candidates for the acceleration of
the highest-energy cosmic rays. Unambiguous
evidence for the acceleration of hadrons in as-
trophysical environments can be provided by the
detection of neutrinos that would be coincidently
produced when accelerated protons interact with
the ambient photon field (see, e.g. [1],[2],[3] and
references therein). Searches for the emission
of neutrinos from GRBs have been performed
by a variety of experiments, for instance Super-
Kamiokande [4], AMANDA [5], Baikal [6], RICE
[7], ANITA [8], IceCube [9, 10] andAntares
[11, 12]. While covering a wide range of neutrino
energies these studies have so far focussed mainly
on the time window coincident with the electro-
magnetic signal of GRBs. Up to now no neutrino
signal could be identified by any neutrino detec-
tor during the prompt emission phases, and ana-
lytical models from [13] based on [2] have already
been excluded by the IceCube collaboration [10].
There has also been some effort to successively
extend the search time windows in the IceCube
data from [-1h,+3h] up to ±1 day [9, 10], and up

to ±15 days [14], to account for prolonged neu-
trino emission. However none of these searches
could bring compelling evidence for a GRB sig-
nal, since all detected events have been identified
with cosmic-ray induced air showers or were of
low significance because of the large time win-
dows.
While the search for a signal of neutrinos coinci-
dent with the emission of high-energy photons is
the most common ansatz, there are many models
that predict time-shifted neutrino signals, such
as neutrino precursors [15], afterglows (e.g. [16]),
or different Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV)
effects for photons and neutrinos on their way
to Earth [17, 18]. For instance, the possibility
that three low significance neutrino-like events
found in the IceCube data [10] could have been
produced by GRBs but arrived before the pho-
ton signal due to LIV effects is discussed in [19].
Probing such scenarios requires a new approach
to the search for correlated emission. Moreover,
in all aforementioned scenarios, the neutrino sig-
nal is simply shifted in time with respect to the
electromagnetic signal, and none of these mod-
els predict any considerably prolonged neutrino
emission. Hence the approach used in this paper
and described in section 3 aims at identifying a

3



presumably faint neutrino signal that is shifted
with respect to the electromagnetic GRB emis-
sion by an unknown time offset, while making no
assumption about the origin of such an offset.

2 Neutrino candidates and
GRB sample

Neutrino telescopes are arrays of photomultipli-
ers deployed in a very large volume of trans-
parent medium like Antarctic ice or deep-sea
water. They detect the Cherenkov light gen-
erated by the products of the interaction of a
high-energy neutrino in the vicinity of the de-
tector. The direction of the impinging neutrino
is reconstructed using the timing of signals from
photomultipliers, while the detected amount of
light gives an estimate of the neutrino energy.
TheAntares telescope [21] is located at a depth
of 2475 m in the French Mediterranean Sea off
the coast of Toulon, at 42◦48′ N, 6◦10′ E. It com-
prises 885 optical modules housing 10” photo-
multipliers in 17” glass spheres installed on 12
strings, representing an instrumented volume of
0.02 km3.
The following analysis focuses on the detection of
muon trajectories from below the horizon, which
are produced by muon-neutrino charged-current
interactions. This channel provides significantly
better directional reconstruction than neutral-
current interactions and charged current inter-
actions from the other neutrino flavors. In this
channel,Antares is the most sensitive detector
for sources in a large part of the southern sky up
to a few 100 TeV [22].

The sample ofAntares events used in this
analysis consists of 5516 neutrino candidates se-
lected from data collected between March 2007
and the end of 2012 [23]. From Monte Carlo

simulations the angular resolution, defined as
the median of the space angle δerr between the
true and reconstructed direction of neutrinos for
an E−2 differential spectrum, is 0.38◦, with a
contamination from atmospheric muons of 10%.
The right-ascension distribution of the neutrino
candidates is shown in Figure 1.
A suitable GRB sample was consolidated simi-
larly to the one used in [12]. It was built us-
ing catalogs from the Swift [24] and Fermi satel-
lites [25, 26], and supplemented by a table from
the IceCube Collaboration1 [27], with informa-
tion parsed from the GRB Coordinates Network
(GCN) notices. Since only the time and posi-
tion information (and the measured redshift, if
available) of each announced GRB was used, no
further selection on e.g. the quality of the spec-
tral measurements was required, leading to 1488
GRBs. Only GRB alerts were taken into account
that occurred both below the horizon of the neu-
trino telescope and during the covered neutrino
data collection period. The upper panel of Fig-
ure 2 shows the distribution of the selected neu-
trino candidates, which are homogeneously dis-
tributed in time. The lower panel displays the
accordingly selected GRBs in equatorial coordi-
nates and their measured fluence.

3 Principle of the search

Neutrino signatures are searched-for in an an-
gular cone around the direction of, and within
a maximum time offset from the time of each
GRB. For any such space and time coincidence,
the time difference with respect to the GRB
alert is recorded. In order to avoid any bound-
ary effect such as an artificial asymetry of neu-

trino candidates around a GRB alert close to
the beginning or end of neutrino telescope data
taking, GRBs detected during a period of half
the considered maximum time offset at the be-
ginning and end of the neutrino data sample
are excluded. The collected time differences are
stacked in a common timing profile. In the case
of no signal, only purely accidental spatial co-
incidences of the neutrino candidates with the
defined search cones around the GRB positions
would be expected. The observed time shifts
should then be distributed randomly, yielding
a flat stacked distribution where all shifts are
equally likely. Any neutrino emission associated
with the GRBs, even if faint, can give rise to a
cumulative effect in these stacked profiles, which
can then be identified by its discrepancy from the
background hypothesis. An optimal choice of the
search cone size δmax naturally depends on the
GRB’s position accuracy and the neutrino direc-

tion reconstruction uncertainty. The size of the
probed time window τmax should be defined as
the largest shift predicted by any of the models
under consideration. Such a procedure had al-
ready been proposed [28], where windows of ±1 h
around the GRB satellite triggers under study
were considered. The approach presented in the
following is extended to allow significantly larger
time windows and different origins of the time
shift. This method is intrinsically different from
those previously developed by the IceCube Col-
laboration [10][14], which focused on successively
widening symmetric search time windows around
the GRB alerts considering a flat temporal sig-
nal probability density function. In the case of a
time-shifted signal, these methods suffer from re-
duced significance due to the accumulated back-
ground in the increasingly large time windows.
In contrast, the technique presented here aims
at identifying a time-shifted signal as a peak on
top of flat background.

3.1 Potential physical delays consid-
ered

For maximum generality we perform a test for
a constant offset (τ = tν − tGRB) between the
(first) detected photon signal tGRB and the time
of a possibly associated neutrino candidate tν ,
for maximum generality. In the case of a con-
stant shift τem of the emission times of the neu-
trino with respect to photons at the source, it
translates into observed time delays at Earth τobs
that depend on the cosmological redshift z of the
GRB as:

τem = τobs/(1 + z) . (1)

To test for these intrinsic time shifts, the dis-
tribution of τz = τ/(1 + z) will be investigated.

Note that the redshift is only measured for ap-
proximately 10% of all GRBs, significantly re-
ducing the statistics of the stacked profile when
omitting all GRBs without determined redshift.

Effects due to LIV (see e.g. [17], [18] and [19])
can also yield different arrival times at Earth for
photons and neutrinos of high energy produced
by a GRB. In a variety of quantum spacetime
models, the velocity dispersion relation linking
the energy of the particle E and its momentum
p is modified by an additional term proportional
to an integer power of the ratio of the energy to
the Planck scale:

E2 − p2c2 = ±E2 · (E/MLIV)n , (2)

where MLIV is the scale at which the symmetry
is broken. The mass term m2c4 can be neglected
for neutrinos [18]. First-order terms with n=1
will be considered here as these exhibit the most
sizeable effects. Within this framework, the time
shift observed at Earth will depend on the energy
of the neutrino, the distance of the source D(z)
and the energy scale MLIV:

∆tLIV = (±1) · E/MLIV ·D(z)/c , (3)

where D(z) is the effective distance travelled by
the particles taking into account the expansion
of the Universe, and is defined according to [19]
as:

D(z) =
c

H0

∫ z
0

(1 + z′)dz′√
Ωm(1 + z′)3 + ΩΛ

, (4)

where z is the redshift, H0 is the Hubble con-
stant, and Ωm and ΩΛ are the relative matter
and dark energy densities of the Universe [20].
These effects are expected to appear in a stacked
histogram that accounts for both the estimated
neutrino energy Eest and the distance of the

6



source. Consequently, the variable to be probed
is defined as:

τLIV =
τ

Eest ·D(z)
, (5)

In case of a sizeable LIV effect, with a given value
of MLIV this yields

τLIV ∝ ±
E

Eest
·

1

MLIV · c
, (6)

and the time-stacked neutrino observations will
accumulate around a single value of τLIV. In
contrast, the distribution of events due to purely
accidental coincidences will peak around zero.

The ratio r = n+/n− of spatially coincident
events before and after the respective GRB alert
is a very simple measure to probe the distribu-
tions while making the fewest assumptions on
any model. Any effect leading to different arrival
times of neutrinos and gamma-rays from GRBs
is expected to yield either positive or negative
time shifts. This ratio is calculated if both n+
and n− are non-zero.

Consequently, in the search for an associated
neutrino signal from GRBs, three stacked time
profiles for the measures τ , τz and τLIV were gen-
erated for all neutrino candidates which matched
the coordinates of a reported GRB alert, and the
ratio r for the whole sample was computed.

4 Implementation of the
method and application
toAntares 2007-2012 data

The expected number of background events µb
increases with the solid angle of the search
cones Ω(δmax) around each GRB’s position and
with the considered maximum time delay τmax.
Hence, the choice of the search cone size and the

probed time window should be optimised under
reasonable physical considerations.

4.1 Search Cone

The determination of an optimally-sized search
cone for spatially coincident neutrino candidates
with a GRB alert was based on the maximi-
sation of the ratio of signal to square root of
background. Assuming a point-source-like sig-
nal at the GRB’s location, the reconstructed
neutrino directions approximately follow a two-
dimensional Gaussian profile of standard devi-
ation σν around this position. This approach
yields an optimum search cone size of 1.58 · σν
as derived for example in [30]. Note that the
neutrino telescope resolution is usually stated as
the median of the reconstructed direction error
m(δerr) (see for instance [31]). For angles in con-
sideration here, the relation m(δerr) ∼ 1.17σν
holds.

The effects of uncertainty in GRB location
∆err (sub-arc second for Swift/UVOT or ground
based telescopes, up to several degrees for
Fermi/GBM) is accounted for by extending the
search window whenever ∆err > σν . As the con-
tribution of random coincidences scales quadrat-
ically with ∆err, the background in the cumula-
tive profile might be dominated considerably by
a few bursts with very large satellite error boxes.
Consequently, a reasonable trade-off should be
found. On the one hand, the statistics should
not be reduced too much by excluding a large
number of badly-localised bursts. On the other
hand, the stacked timing profiles should not be
dominated by one burst with a large error box,
which naturally leads to many accidental spatial
coincidences. In order to limit this effect without
significantly reducing the data sample, a maxi-
mum search-cone size was chosen – based on the

7

box ∆err (orange). The cumulative distribution
is shown by the grey line. For GRBs with mea-
sured redshift, the distribution is shown in violet.

distribution of ∆maxerr shown in Figure 3 – such
that no GRB contributed more than an order
of magnitude more of uncorrelated background
than any other.

The search-cone size is consequently defined
as:

δcut = 1.58 ·max(σν , min(∆err,∆maxerr )) . (7)

Using theAntares pointing resolution of 0.38◦,
all bursts with error boxes larger than ∆maxerr = 1

◦

were consequently discarded from the search,
which reduced the sample by ∼ 54% while keep-
ing 74% of the total gamma-ray fluence of the
sample, yielding search-cone sizes in the range
[0.51◦, 1.58◦]. Note that Fermi-detected bursts
with a resolution of 1◦ are included.

4.2 Maximum Time Delay

The approach presented in this paper aims at be-
ing as model independent as possible. The max-

imum time shift anticipated from the astrophysi-
cal processes mentionned in section 3.1 is used to
set the time coincidence window. Intrinsic shifts
in the emission times of neutrinos were predicted
in [15] with neutrinos ∼ 100 s before the electro-
magnetic GRB signal. A precursor neutrino sig-
nal that might be emitted even tens of years be-
fore the actual GRB is derived in [32]. Since the
latter time scale exceeds the operational times
of the current neutrino telescopes, we will omit
this scenario. Early afterglow emission of neu-
trinos ∼ 10 s after the burst are predicted in
[16] and [33] and extended neutrino fluxes up
to 1 day after the prompt emission are derived
in [34]. These intrinsic time shifts between neu-
trino and photon signals are still well within the
time scopes that have already been probed, for
example in [10],[14] – without positive result.

Differences in arrival times induced by LIV ef-
fects would depend not only on MLIV , but also
on the energy of the particles and the distance
of the source. However, a maximum expected
time shift of neutrinos and photons can be in-
ferred from Equation 3 using the existing limit
on the LIV energy scale. The most stringent
limit within the theoretical framework used here
has been set to MLIV = 7.6·MPlanck based on the
Fermi/LAT data [35]. Using the distance D(z)
at a redshift of z = 8.5, which is the highest mea-
sured redshift in the selected GRB catalog, and a
maximum energy of ∼ Emax = 109 GeV account-
ing for the energy range at which a signal might
be observed, a maximum time shift of τmax = 40
days was derived. Even though the upper bound
was derived from quantum space-time models,
the search itself remains model independent.

A discretisation of the cumulative timing pro-
files into 150 bins was chosen, which allows time
scales down to 13 hours to be probed. Given
the low number of expected coincidences within

8



the allowed time window (see section 4.5), this
choice ensures that there will be much less coin-
cidences than bins, leading to a quasi-unbinned
approach [29].

4.3 Final GRB Sample

Having chosen the maximal search time window
and the largest angular search cone that should
be taken into account, the final samples associ-
ated with the neutrino telescope data set were
determined. The initially selected GRB cata-
log comprised 1488 bursts that had occurred be-
tween 2007 to 2012, which gives a detection rate
of 0.68 bursts per day. Out of these, 563 have
been selected for the search of associated neutri-
nos in theAntares data using the criteria out-
lined above, of which 150 have a measured red-
shift z.

4.4 Statistical tests

From the stacked histograms of τ , τz and τLIV,
test statistics are calculated that distinguish a
systematically time-shifted neutrino signal asso-
ciated with GRBs from the background-only hy-
pothesis of purely accidental coincidences. A
large number of background realisations pre-
serving the telescope’s acceptance are generated
from the existing data sets by scrambling the
time from the corresponding distribution of Fig.
1 and randomising the right ascension of de-
tected neutrino candidate events in accordance
with the flatness of the data distribution. The
significance, of an excess in the data is then given
by the p-value which is the probability to mea-
sure the test statistic in question (or more ex-
treme values) from the background-only distri-
bution.

The test statistic associated to the ratio r

will be the variable itself. For the stacked his-
tograms, the Bayesian observable ψ to estimate
the compatibility of a given stacked (and binned)
time profile with the expectations from back-
ground has been proposed in [28] and [29]. This
test statistic is proportional to the logarithm of
the probability p of an observation D under an

with n events in the histogram in total, dis-
tributed in k ∈ [1 . . .m] bins. The probability to
fall within bin k is pk; for a uniform background
distribution (i.e. in the case of the τ profile),
pk = 1/m is simply given by the total number of
bins m.For the non-uniform profiles τz and τLIV,
these probabilities have to be determined by a
large number of pseudo-experiments simulating
the background, of the order of 107 to estimate
the significance of a potential excess up to the 5σ
level. The value of ψ is calculated for each of the
τ , τz and τLIV profiles, correspondingly denoted
ψ, ψz and ψLIV.

4.5 Sensitivity

Around 1.4 · 107 pseudo experiments yielding
sky-maps of uncorrelated neutrino events were
generated to simulate the case of purely acci-
dental coincidences (background-only) between
theAntares neutrino data and the GRB cata-
logue. On average, 3.9 of the neutrino candi-
dates are expected to match the bursts’ search

windows in time and space, with 0.7 of them co-
inciding accidentally with the bursts with mea-
sured redshift.

To illustrate the performance of the pro-
posed technique to identify hypothetical neutri-
nos from GRBs, a test signal was generated by
associating neutrino candidates artificially with
a fraction of the GRBs at a hypothetical intrin-
sic time shift of tin with tin = 1, 5, 10 or 20
days. That is, taking into account the cosmo-
logical redshift z, a simulated signal delayed by
tν = tGRB + tin · (1 + z). Its strength was quan-
tified by the probability f ∈ [0, 1] that a GRB
produced a signal in the neutrino telescope. The
signal was consequently only simulated for those
bursts for which the redshift could be deter-
mined, and the variable which has the best sensi-
tivity to it will be τz since signal will accumulate
in one bin.

the 3σ level using the ψz test statistic as a func-
tion of the signal strength f (see text) and in-
trinsic time delay at the source for a signal as
described in section 4.5.

The discovery probabilityMDP at nσ signifi-
cance level for a given signal strength is given by

Figure 5: Detection probability MDP at 3σ
(solid) and 5σ (dashed lines) for the test statis-
tics ψ, ψz, ψLIV and r as a function of the mean

fz denotes the fraction of GRBs in the sample
with determined redshift z, whereas fall gives the
fraction of the whole sample.

the fraction of realisations that lead to values of
the test statistics (here r, ψ, ψz or ψLIV) above
a threshold corresponding to a p-value at the
nσ level on the background-only realisations. It
represents the efficiency of the analysis and the
specific test statistic to identify a signal being as-
sociated with a fraction of GRBs. The detection
efficiency of the ψz test statistic is independent
of the time shift of signal for delays up to 10
days, as can be seen in Figure 4. The evolu-
tion of the efficiencies for an example signal at
an intrinsic time shift of 5 days as a function
of the signal strength f is shown in Figure 5,

Figure 6: Probabilities P to measure values of
the test statistics above the median value from

ity is given by the signal fraction f where the

Note that the curves for ψz and ψLIV lie on top
of each other. Probabilities were derived using
theAntares data from 2007-2012.

and is hence representative of shifts from 0 to 10
days. Signal strength corresponding to discovery
probabilities are summarized in Table 1, for the
whole sample and for GRBs with measured red-
shift. For instance, using the ψ test statistics, if
only f = 1.3% of the GRBs would give rise to an
associated signal neutrino, it would produce an
excess of 3σ significance with 50% probability,
whereas a stronger signal in 2.4% of the bursts
would be identified at the 5σ level. For the sam-
ple of GRBs with measured redshift, the ψz test
statistic only needs a fraction fz = 4.5% which

is half of the signal fraction necessary with the
ψ test statistic for the same detection efficiency.

The introduced time-stacking technique is
consequently capable of robustly finding at the
3σ level an intrinsically delayed neutrino emis-
sion from GRBs as long as it is associated with
at least 3 of the 563 bursts.

The probability of measuring values of the
test statistics exceeding the median background
value for different signal strengths is shown
in Figure 6.The sensitivity at 90% (99%)
confidence-level (CL) is defined as the 90%
(99%) CL upper limit that can be placed on the
signal strength when observing the median back-
ground (see gray dashed line marking 90%). The
sensitivities at 90% and 99% CL of the proposed
analysis for the given test signal simulating neu-
trino emission delayed by five days at the source
in a mean fraction of all bursts are summarised
in Table 1. For instance, at 90% CL, considering
only the sub-sample of bursts with determined
redshift and the test statistics ψz and ψLIV, the
method is sensitive to a signal in only 1.1% of
the bursts.

5 Results and Discussion

The data collected by theAntares telescope
from the years 2007 to 2012 were analysed to
search for neutrinos within the predefined angu-
lar and timing search windows associated with
the GRB catalogue. None of the neutrino candi-
dates in the data matched these search windows,
where 3.9 would have been expected from back-
ground (0.7 coincidences were expected for the
GRBs with measured redshift z). The measured
values of the test statistics are thus zero, and the
ratio r = n+/n− is undefined. The probability
to observe no events coinciding with all GRBs

is relatively small, with P (0|3.9) = 1.2% (and
51.4% for GRBs with measured z).

We verified the under-fluctuation to be of sta-
tistical origin instead of intrinsic systematic ef-
fects in the search methodology or the software.
In particular, we derived the number of coinci-
dences when increasing independently τmax and
δmax. Using these enlarged coincidence windows,
the number of coincident data events is close to
the expected number of coincidences from ran-
domized data.

In Table 3, the probabilities P to measure test
statistics above the measurements and the ex-
pected values from the median background real-
isations are given. This results in 99% CL limits
of fall = 0.04% and fz = 2.6%, and a 90% CL
upper limit on fz of 1.1%. With the aforemen-
tioned under-fluctuation, the setting of a 90%
CL limit on fall defined according to section 4.5
is not possible. A conservative option would be
to set the limit equal to the sensitivity as in [36].
Since this method does not make use of the infor-
mation contained in the actual nonobservation,
the resulting 90% CL of fall = 0.6% is weaker
than the standard 99% CL of 0.04%, so the value
of 0.04% should be used for both 90% and 99%
CL.

We can state a sensitivity of m(f90%CLall ) =
0.6% of all GRBs (2.2% for those with measured
z), which is the median upper limit on the frac-
tion of bursts that contain a signal of the form
τs = 5 d·(1+z). Furthermore, we see that 99% of
all realisations with a signal fraction fall = 0.04%
would yield higher ψ than observed, so we can
exclude such a signal with 99% confidence. Re-
garding the sample of bursts with measured red-
shift z, the observation of zero events matched
the median expectation from background, so we
could exclude that 1.1% of them produced a sig-
nal neutrino with a delay shape τs = 5 d · (1 + z)

with 90% confidence, in accordance with the sen-
sitivity that had previously been derived.

5.1 Application to the IceCube IC40
Data Sample

The same parameter optimisation and search has
been performed with the public data sample2

from an analysis searching for neutrino pointlike
sources [37] of the IceCube observatory in its
40-string configuration. These data cover April
2008 to May 2009 and comprise 12877 neutrino
candidates. The selection procedure of neutrinos
and GRBs is the same as in 4. With a resolution
of 0.7◦ [38] it leads to 60 GRBs ( respectively
12 with measured z) 35 of which are expected
to be in coincidence with neutrinos (respectively
4). The different parameters summarising the
Antares and IceCube samples, including the
number of coincident events ncoinc that would
be expected if the neutrino data was completely
uncorrelated with the chosen GRBs (i.e., the
background-only hypothesis) are given in Table
2.
The IceCube GRB sample shows significantly
lower statistics, due to the fact that the pub-
lished data spans only around one year compared
to almost six years in the Antares sample. In
addition, because of the location of the detec-
tors on Earth, 87% of the sky is visible for the
Antares detector with unequal coverage, whilst
the IceCube experiment covers the northern sky
but at all times. It is also worth noting that, due
to the larger instrumented volume of the detec-
tor, the IceCube data set contains more neu-
trino candidates than the Antares one, while
covering a smaller time period in which less GRB
alerts were recorded. Both samples therefore ex-

plore different statistical regimes. In the end, 42
of the neutrino candidates fall within the search
windows, with 8 for the bursts with measured
z. This is a slight fluctuation above the expec-
tations from background, with p-values of 13.5%
(whole sample) and 5.1% (GRBs with measured
redshift), yielding excesses of moderate 1.5σ and
1.9σ significances, respectively. The observation
is compatible with no correlation of the Ice-
Cube data with the chosen GRB sample. More-
over, the timing profiles show no indication for
any preferred time delay. The measured and ex-
pected values as well as the corresponding signif-
icance of the different test statistics for the two
studied samples, are summarised in Table 4.

6 Conclusion

A powerful method has been presented to iden-
tify a neutrino signal associated with GRBs if it
is shifted in time with respect to the photon sig-
nal. The signal is distinguished from randomly
distributed data as a cumulative effect in stacked

timing profiles of spatially coincident neutrinos
in the data from the Antares and IceCube
neutrino telescopes.

Estimating the behaviour of the search for a
large number of simulated measurements using
randomised sky maps of the neutrino events, and
comparing these with the actual neutrino tele-
scope data, significances of the observations were
derived. Using data from the Antares neu-
trino telescope between the years 2007 and 2012,
a deficit of spatially coincident neutrinos with
the selected gamma-ray-burst catalogue was re-
ported, with 98.8% of the randomised data lead-
ing to more coincidences between the neutrino
data and the GRBs. The application of the
method to the public IceCube data in its 40
line configuration gives results compatible with
the expectation from background.

The presented approach could have identified
an intrinsically time-shifted signal even if only
of the order of one in a hundred GRBs would
have given rise to a single associated neutrino
in the Antares data. This is above the de-

fraction of background-only pseudo experiments that yield test statistics above and at and above
the measurement. Being 10 times the logarithm of two definite positive quantities, the ψ type
test statistics are usually expressed in dB [29]. Note that since there are no coincidences in the
Antares data sample, r is not defined

tectable neutrino signal predicted by the Neu-
CosmA model [39] that is on average only of the
order of ∼ 2 · 10−4 in theAntares detector, and
only the strongest individual burst yields a neu-
trino detection rate exceeding 0.01 [12].

In conclusion, novel analysis techniques have
been developed that increase the sensitivity of
existing neutrino searches from GRBs to mod-
els of delayed neutrino emission and Lorentz In-
variance Violation. They allow extending the
search for neutrinos from GRBs with time dis-
placements of up to 40 days. It confirms the ab-
sence of a significant neutrino signal being asso-
ciated with GRBs that has so far been measured
in the simultaneous time windows.
