Abstract

A search for cosmic neutrino sources using the data collected with the ANTARES neu-
trino telescope between early 2007 and the end of 2015 is performed. For the first time, all
neutrino interactions –charged and neutral current interactions of all flavours– are consid-
ered in a search for point-like sources with the ANTARES detector. In previous analyses,
only muon neutrino charged current interactions were used. This is achieved by using a novel
reconstruction algorithm for shower-like events in addition to the standard muon track recon-
struction. The shower channel contributes about 23% of all signal events for an E−2 energy
spectrum. No significant excess over background is found. The most signal-like cluster of
events is located at (α, δ) = (343.8◦, 23.5◦) with a significance of 1.9σ. The neutrino flux
sensitivity of the search is about E2dΦ/dE = 6× 10−9 GeV cm−2 s−1 for declinations from
−90◦ up to −42◦, and below 10−8 GeV cm−2 s−1 for declinations up to 5◦. The directions
of 106 source candidates and of 13 muon track events from the IceCube HESE sample are
investigated for a possible neutrino signal and upper limits on the signal flux are determined.

1 Introduction

Different types of astrophysical objects have been proposed as production sites of high-energy
neutrinos through the decay of charged pions, previously produced in the interactions of nuclei
with ambient matter or radiation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In contrast to charged cosmic rays, neutrinos
are not deflected by (inter-)galactic magnetic fields and point straight back to their production
sites. Finding sources of cosmic neutrinos would identify the sources of cosmic rays, whose origin
and acceleration processes are a long-standing astrophysical question. The results of the latest
search for point-like sources using the ANTARES neutrino telescope are presented in this paper.
For the first time, events which are selected based on the signal induced by electromagnetic or
hadronic showers are included. This has been achieved by using a new reconstruction algorithm
[6] which allows a median pointing accuracy between 2◦ and 3◦ for neutrinos with energies in
the 103 – 106 GeV range.

This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, the ANTARES neutrino telescope and the
event selection for this analysis are introduced. The search method is explained in Section 3,
the results of the analysis shown in Section 4 and the discussion on the possible effects due
to systematic uncertainties described in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are summarised in
Section 6.

2 ANTARES neutrino telescope and event selection

The ANTARES telescope [7], located in the Mediterranean Sea, is the largest neutrino detector
in the Northern Hemisphere. The detector comprises a three-dimensional array of 885 optical
modules (OMs), each one housing a 10” photomultiplier tube (PMT), and distributed over 12
vertical strings anchored at the sea floor at a depth of about 2400 m. The detection of light from
upgoing charged particles is optimised with the PMTs facing 45◦ downward.

Simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the detector. Atmospheric muons and
neutrinos are simulated with the MUPAGE [8, 9] and GENHEN [10, 11] packages, respectively.
For the simulation of atmospheric muons, the total amount of simulated events corresponds to
1/3 of the total livetime of the data set. The Bartol flux [12] is considered to represent the
atmospheric neutrino flux. The simulation of the amount of optical background (40K and biolu-
minescence) is performed according to the collected data in order to account for the variations
of the environmental conditions [13].

The data used for the analysis was recorded between 2007 January 29th and 2015 December
31st. During this period, which includes the commissioning phase, the detector operation with
at least five lines corresponds to a total livetime of 2423.6 days. The event selection is optimised
following a blind procedure on pseudo-data sets of data randomised in time (pseudo-experiments)
before performing the analysis. The selection criteria for tracks and showers are explained in
Section 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. These criteria have been optimised to minimise the neutrino
flux needed for a 5σ discovery of a point-like source in 50% of the pseudo-experiments. The
effective area for ↪ ↩νµ CC after the track selection cuts, and for ↪ ↩νe 1 CC and ↪ ↩νµ NC events after
the shower selection cuts can be seen in Figure 1.

contribution of other flavour neutrino events assuming a neutrino flux with an E−2 energy
spectrum. The scaling has been calculated after performing simulations of ντ events for a reduced
livetime. The obtained rates are the following: 0.09 of the Charged Current (CC) ↪ ↩νµ to take
into account the decay of the outgoing τ into a µ, 0.12 of the CC ↪ ↩νe to take into account the
decay of the τ into an electron, and 3.74 of the NC ↪ ↩νµ, which takes into account the ντ NC
interaction and the τ decaying into hadrons after a CC interaction.

2.1 Muon track selection

Muon tracks are reconstructed using a multi-step procedure that concludes with a maximum
likelihood method [14]. This likelihood takes into account the so-called hits. A hit is defined as the
digital information on the time and amplitude of a PMT signal, where the latter is proportional
to the number of detected photons. As in the previous publication [15], muon events are selected
applying cuts on the reconstructed zenith angle (cos θtr > −0.1), the estimated angular error
(βtr < 1◦) and the parameter that describes the quality of the reconstruction (Λ > −5.2). An
approximated evaluation of the energy deposited per unit of path length is used to estimate the
muon energy. An energy estimator, ρ, is defined using the hit charge, recorded by all PMTs used
to reconstruct the track, and the length of the muon path in the detector [16, 17]. The energy

4



estimator fails for events for which the muon energy is below the value of the critical energy
to produce significant energy losses due to radiative processes (∼500 GeV), and for tracks with
estimated track length, Lµ, below 380 m, yielding small values of ρ. Such events are excluded
from the analysis. Table 1 gives an overview of the selection cuts applied for the simulated track
sample. A total of 7629 neutrino candidates in the track channel are selected in data for this
search.

2.2 Shower selection

Shower events are reconstructed with a new algorithm based on a two-step procedure. In the
first step, the interaction vertex is obtained by the maximization of an M-estimator, Mest, which
depends on the time and charge of the hits. The direction of the event is estimated with a
maximum likelihood method, using the information of the reconstructed interaction vertex and
the detected amplitude of the OMs. Shower events are required to be reconstructed as up-going or
coming from close to the horizon (cos θsh > −0.1) with a restriction on the angular error estimate
(βsh < 30◦). The interaction vertex of each event is also required to be reconstructed inside or
close to the instrumented volume. To further reduce the background from mis-reconstructed
atmospheric muons, additional selection cuts are imposed. These cuts are based on the Mest
value, on a Random Decision Forest classifier value, RDF , made with parameters provided by
an alternative shower reconstruction [18], and on a likelihood, Lµ or muon likelihood, that uses
information of the hits in the event. A description of these cuts is given in Appendix A. Events
passing the muon track selection are excluded from the shower channel making the two samples
mutually exclusive. The full list of selection cuts is summarised in Table 2. The selection yields
180 shower events.

2.3 Comparison between data and simulations

Figure 2-left compares the distributions of the quality parameter Λ for different types of simulated
events with the data set for the track channel. Figure 2-right shows the comparison in the
reconstructed zenith angle for the shower channel. It is estimated that about 13% of the selected
muon tracks and 52 % of the selected shower events are atmospheric muons mis-reconstructed
as up-going. The simulation overestimates the number of events by 8 % (17 %) in the track
(shower) channel for the final set of cuts. This difference is well within the overall systematic

uncertainty on the atmospheric neutrino flux normalization [17]. A larger overestimation of
events is observed in the region where the background of mis-reconstructed atmospheric muons
is dominant. A global good agreement between data and Monte Carlo justifies the procedure
to optimise the selection criteria for the separation of signal and background using simulated
events.

3 Search method

While atmospheric neutrino events are randomly distributed, neutrinos from point-like sources
are expected to accumulate in spatial clusters. To find these clusters, a maximum likelihood ratio
approach is followed. The likelihood used describes the data in terms of signal and background
probability density functions (PDFs) and is defined as

event at an angular distance ∆Ψ around the direction of the source. It depends on the angular
resolution of the event sample. Figure 3 shows the cumulative distributions of the angular
distance between the reconstructed and true neutrino direction for track and shower events. The
PSFs are determined from Monte Carlo simulations of neutrinos with an E−2 energy spectrum.
The figure shows that about 50 % of the track (shower) events are reconstructed within 0.4◦ (3◦)
of the parent neutrino.

3.2 Background rate

The background rate B is described as a function of the declination, δ. Given the small expected
contribution of a cosmic signal in the overall data set, the background rate is estimated directly
from the measured data. Due to the Earth’s rotation and a sufficiently uniform exposure, the
background is considered independent of right-ascension, α. The rate of selected events as a
function of declination is shown in Figure 4.

3.3 Energy estimator

Neutrinos generated in the atmosphere have a much softer energy spectrum (∝ E−3.7) than
neutrinos from the expected astrophysical flux proportional to E−2. For this reason, the energy
estimator information is used in the likelihood to further distinguish between cosmic signal and
atmospheric background.

atmospheric muons in the sample.

For the shower channel, the number of hits (Nsh) used by the reconstruction algorithm is
employed as energy estimator.

A different and more elaborate approach is assumed for the track channel. In this case the
estimator ρ is used as a proxy for the energy of the neutrino event. The information of the event
angular error estimate βtr is also included. Moreover, the dependence of the energy estimator
on the declination of the event is taken into account by generating both the signal and the
background PDF in steps of 0.2 over sin δ.

3.4 Implementation

The significance of any observation is determined by a test statistic denoted as Q which is defined
from the likelihood as

Q = log Ls+b − log Lb. (2)

The Q distributions for different signal strengths are determined from pseudo-experiments. In
these, O

(
104 ∼ 105

)
of random sky maps are generated with a number of background events that

follow the declination-dependent event distribution as seen in the actual data. In addition, signal
events are injected according to the investigated spectrum. In equation (2) Lb corresponds to the
definition of Ls+b in equation (1) evaluated with the same parameters as the maximum likelihood
estimate but with the numbers of signal events set to zero: µtrsig = µ

sh
sig = 0 (background-only

case).

In the likelihood maximization, the position in the sky of the fitted source is either kept fixed
or allowed to be fitted within specific limits depending on the type of search (see Section 4).
Furthermore, the values of µtrsig and µ

sh
sig are left free to vary, and can indeed go below zero to

reflect the degree of absence of events around the probed coordinates. The declination-dependent
acceptance for a given sample, AS(δ), is defined as the proportionality constant between a given

9



flux normalization Φ0 = E2dΦ/dE and the expected number of signal events for this particular
flux. It can be expressed in terms of the effective area, Aeff,S(Eν , δ):

where the integral is over the livetime of all selected runs (2423.6 days) and over an energy
range large enough to include all potential events within the sensitivity of ANTARES. With the
assumed E−2 spectrum, 90% of the events are found in an energy range between 2·103 and 3·106
GeV for the track channel (between 5·103 and 4·106 GeV for the shower channel). Figure 5 shows
how the acceptances for tracks and showers depend on the declination.

4 Search for neutrino sources

The search for astrophysical neutrino sources presented in this paper is performed with four
approaches.

1 Full sky search. In the first method, the whole visible sky of ANTARES is scanned in an
unbinned way to search for spatial clustering of events with respect to the expected back-

10



ground.

2 Candidate list search. In the second approach, the directions of a pre-defined list of known
objects which are neutrino source candidates are investigated to look for an excess or (in
the case of null observation) to determine an upper limit on their neutrino fluxes.

3 Galactic Centre region. The third search is similar to the full sky search but restricted to a
region centred in the origin of the galactic coordinate system (α, δ) = (266.40◦,–28.94◦) and
defined by an ellipse with a semi-axis of 15◦ in the direction of the galactic latitude and a
semi-axis of 20◦ in galactic longitude. The motivation relies on the number of high-energy
neutrino events observed by the IceCube (IC) detector [19, 20] that appear to cluster in
this region. Furthermore, the HESS Collaboration recently discovered an accelerator of
PeV protons in the Galactic Centre [21] that could produce high-energy neutrinos.

4 Sagittarius A*. Finally, the fourth approach tests the location of Sagittarius A* as an extended
source by assuming a Gaussian emission profile of various widths.

Figure 6 represents the event sample in equatorial coordinates in the ANTARES visible sky.
The considered neutrino source candidates and the search region around the Galactic Centre are
also indicated.

4.1 Full sky search

In the full sky search, the whole visible sky of ANTARES is divided on a grid with boxes of 1◦×1◦
in right ascension and declination for the evaluation of the Q-value defined in Equation (2). This
value is maximised in each box by letting the location of the fitted cluster free between the 1◦×1◦
boundaries. Since an unbinned search is performed, events outside the grid boxes are indeed
considered in each Q-value maximisation. The pre-trial p-value of each cluster is calculated by
comparing the Q-value obtained at the location of the fitted cluster with the background-only
Q obtained from simulations at the corresponding declination. Figure 7 shows the position of
the cluster and the pre-trial p-values for all the directions in the ANTARES visible sky. The
most significant cluster of this search is found at a declination of δ = 23.5◦ and a right-ascension
of α = 343.8◦ and with a pre-trial p-value of 3.84× 10−6. To account for trial factors, this
pre-trial p-value is compared to the distribution of the smallest p-values found anywhere in the
sky when performing the same analysis on many pseudo-data sets. It is found that 5.9% of
pseudo-experiments have a smaller p-value than the one found in the final sample, corresponding
to a post-trial significance of 1.9σ (two-sided convention). The upper limit on the neutrino flux
coming from this sky location is E2dΦ/dE = 3.8× 10−8 GeV cm−2 s−1. The location of this
cluster is found at a distance of 1.1◦ from event ID 3 from the 6 year Northern Hemisphere
Cosmic Neutrino flux sample from IceCube [22]. 26 out of the 29 of these events are found in a
declination range between -5◦ and 30◦. By assuming a random distribution of 26 events within
this declination range, a random coincidence within 1◦ between at least one event and the most
significant cluster of the full sky search is ∼1%. The distribution of events of this cluster is shown
in Figure 8-top-left. It contains 16(3) tracks within 5◦(1◦) and 1 shower event within 5◦. The
upper limits of the highest significant cluster in bands of 1◦ in declination at a 90% Confidence
Level (C.L.) obtained using the Neyman method [23] are shown in Figure 9.

full sky search. For this map, a smaller grid size of 0.2◦× 0.2◦ was used.

(solid red line). The IceCube curve for energies under 100 TeV (solid blue line) is obtained from
the 3 years MESE analysis [25]. The limits of the most significant cluster obtained in bands of
1◦ in declination (dark red squares) are also shown.

4.2 Candidate list

The candidate list used in the last ANTARES point-like source analysis [15] contained neutrino
source candidates both from Galactic and extra-Galactic origin listed in the TeVCat catalogue
[26]. These sources had been observed by gamma-ray experiments before July 2011 in the 0.1–
100 TeV energy range and with declinations lower than 20◦. Furthermore, since the energy of
high energy gamma-rays of extra-galactic origin can degrade before they reach the Earth, extra-
Galactic candidates were selected also among the sources observed by gamma-ray satellites in the
1–100 GeV energy range. This paper updates the neutrino search for the 50 objects considered
in [15] with additional 56 galactic and extragalactic sources. The newly considered sources
include those detected in the 0.1–100 TeV energy range by gamma-ray experiments after July
2011 and some bright sources with declinations between 20◦ and 40◦ not considered in the past.

14



Additionally, the reconstructed direction of the IceCube multi-PeV track event [22] and the
2HWC sources which are not coincident with any known source [27] have been included. Finally,
seven more sources are added: the three blazars with highest intensity observed by the TANAMI
Collaboration that coincide with three events from the IceCube HESE sample [28, 29, 30], and the
four gravitationally lensed Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars with the highest magnification factor
analysed in a previous work [31].

The list of the astronomical candidates is shown in Table 3 along with their equatorial coor-
dinates, fitted number of signal events and upper limits on the flux.

The most signal-like cluster is found at the location of HESSJ0632+057 at (α, δ) = (98.24◦, 5.81◦),
with a pre-trial p-value of 0.16%. The second and third most significant sources correspond to
PKS1440-389 and PKS0235+164, with pre-trial p-values of 0.5% and 5%, respectively. To ac-
count for trial factors, the search is performed on the same list of sources using pseudo data-sets,
from which the distribution of the smallest p-value for a background-only case is obtained. It is
found that 13% of the pseudo-experiments have a smaller p-value for any source compared to the
one obtained for this location, corresponding to a post-trial significance of 1.5σ (two-sided con-
vention). The cluster contains 11(1) tracks within 5◦(1◦) and 2 shower events within 5◦ around
the source candidate. The distribution of events around this source is shown in Figure 8-top-
right. The sensitivities and limits calculated with the Neyman method at a 90% C.L. and the 5σ
discovery flux for this search (assuming an E−2 spectrum) are shown in Figure 9 as a function
of the declination. To prevent certain undesired effects of the Neyman construction [32], the
maximum between the median sensitivity and the limit for the particular location of the source
are reported, as is customary in the field [15, 24].

The 13 track candidates from the IceCube HESE sample classified as muon tracks [19, 20]
are considered in a separate candidate list search. Since those events have a non-negligible
angular error estimate, the direction parameters are not fixed but fitted within a cone of twice
their angular error estimate around the direction given by the IceCube tracks. The coordinates
of these events are shown in Table 4 together with their angular uncertainty (provided by the
IceCube Collaboration), fitted number of signal events and upper limits on the flux derived from
this analysis.

The muon track candidate from the HESE sample with the largest excess in fitted signal is the
IceCube track with ID 3 and µsig = 5.3. The fitted cluster is located at (α, δ) = (130.1◦,−29.8◦),
which is at a distance of 1.5◦ from the original HESE track at (α, δ) = (127.9◦,−31.2◦). The
observed post-trial p-value is 20% (significance of 1.2σ). The upper limit on the signal from this
candidate is Φ90 %0 = 2.1× 10

−8 GeV cm−2 s−1. The cluster is shown in Figure 8-middle-left.

4.3 Galactic Centre region

The restricted search region is defined as an ellipse around the Galactic Centre with semi-axes of
20◦ in galactic longitude and 15◦ in galactic latitude. Due to the smaller search area, the search
for astrophysical sources is more sensitive than a full sky search because it is less probable for
background events to randomly cluster together, mimicking the signature of a signal. Assuming
the usual E−2 spectrum, the most significant cluster found in this restricted region is located at
(α, δ) = (257.4◦,−41.0◦) with a pre-trial p-value of 0.09% and a fitted number of signal events
of 2.3. The post-trial significance of this cluster, calculated as in the full sky search but in the
restricted region around the Galactic Centre, is 60%. Other spectral indices (γ = 2.1, 2.3, 2.5) and
source extensions (σ = 0.5◦, 1.0◦, 2.0◦) are considered, yielding different most significant clusters.

The source extension is quantified by the σ of the gaussian distribution. For a spectral index of γ
= 2.5 and a point-source, the most significant cluster is found at (α, δ) = (273.0◦,−42.2◦), with
a pre-trial p-value of 0.02% and a post-trial significance of 30%. The distribution of events for
these two clusters is shown in Figure 8-middle-right and bottom-left. The positions of the most
significant clusters found for the remaining spectral indices and source extensions considered are
within 1◦ from the position of the latter.

The declination-dependent limit of such a restricted point-like source search is shown in
Figure 10, both for different energy spectral indices γ and different source extensions. The
upper limits increase with increasing values of γ and with the source extension. A softer energy
spectrum of cosmic neutrinos (larger values of the spectral index γ) is less distinguishable from
the spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos, as is a source with a larger extension. For a softer
spectrum, fewer neutrinos are emitted by the source within an energy range in which they can
be statistically separated from atmospheric neutrinos. The flux required at the normalization
point for a significant detection is therefore larger.

4.4 Sagittarius A*

Super-massive black holes are strong candidates to be accelerators of very-high energy cosmic rays
and therefore for cosmic neutrino production [33]. Additionally, due to the high concentration of
candidate sources and gas around the Galactic Centre (GC), it is probable that a diffuse signal
from that region will be detected before identifying individual point-like sources. For this reason,
Sagittarius A*, located at (α, δ) = (266.42◦,−29.01◦), is investigated as an extended source
with widths between 0.5◦ and 5◦. The cluster of events around Sagittarius A* reconstructed
by ANTARES is shown in Figure 8-bottom-right. The sensitivity and upper limits for the
assumption of different source extensions can be seen in Figure 11. The sensitivity degrades with
increasing extension but an improvement of up to a factor of 2.7 can be achieved by assuming

5 Systematic uncertainties

The effects of systematic uncertainties on the absolute pointing accuracy, angular resolution,
acceptance and the background rate distribution of events are evaluated.

Absolute Pointing Accuracy Uncertainty. An uncertainty of 0.13◦ and 0.06◦ on the horizontal
(φ) and vertical (θ) directions, respectively, was established in a previous study [34]. To take
this into account, randomly generated offsets have been added to the φ and θ variables of the
simulated events. The offsets are generated according to two Gaussian distributions with the
aforementioned uncertainties as sigmas.

Angular Resolution Uncertainty. The angular resolution of the track reconstruction algorithm
can be affected by the accuracy of the detected hit times. A smearing of these times was
performed in simulations leading to a 15% degradation on the angular resolution in the track
channel [14]. For neutrinos of the shower sample, the reconstruction of the direction depends
most significantly on the recorded charge. A smearing in the measured charges [35] leads to a
12% degradation of the angular resolution for the shower channel.

Acceptance Uncertainty. A 15% uncertainty on the acceptance has been considered for the
calculation of the reported fluxes. This uncertainty was calculated after performing simulations
with a reduction of the OM efficiency by 15% [14].

Background Uncertainty. In order to account for possible systematic uncertainties on the
background, the distribution of the background rates in Figure 4 are parametrised by two different
spline functions, R(δ) and B(δ) (the red and blue lines). The declination-dependent distribution
of background events of the pseudo-experiments is determined as B(δ) = B(δ)+r ·(R(δ)−B(δ)),
with r being a random number drawn for each pseudo-experiment from a uniform distribution
between -1 and 1.

It is found that not considering these uncertainties would improve the median sensitivity at
90 % C.L. and the 5σ discovery potential by less than 5 %.

6 Conclusion and outlook

Various searches for cosmic neutrino sources using combined information from the track and
shower channels have been presented. These searches provide the most sensitive limits for a
large fraction of the Southern Sky, especially at neutrino energies below 100 TeV. No significant
evidence of cosmic neutrino sources has been found. The IceCube HESE accumulation reported
near the Galactic Centre could neither be totally attributed to a point-like source nor to an
extended source.

The most significant cluster in the full sky search is located at (α, δ) = (343.8◦, 23.5◦) with a
post-trial significance of 5.9 % or 1.9σ.

Upper limits on the neutrino flux from 106 astrophysical candidates and 13 IceCube muon
tracks have been presented. The most significant source candidate is HESSJ0632+057 – located
at (α, δ) = (98.24◦, 5.81◦) – with a post-trial significance of 1.5σ. The upper limit on the signal
from this candidate is E2dΦ/dE = 2.40× 10−8 GeV cm−2 s−1.

The most significant cluster of events close to the Galactic Centre when assuming a point-like

19



source with an E−2 energy spectrum is located at (α, δ) = (−102.6◦,−41.0◦) with a post-trial
p-value of 60%.

Sagittarius A* as a possible extended source has been investigated. Upper limits for the
flux and number of events assuming a Gaussian morphology with different extensions have been
presented. The largest excess over the background is observed at an angular extension of 0◦ with
a pre-trial p-value value of 22%.

The KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino telescope [36], which is currently under construction, will
combine a cubic kilometre-sized detector with the same high visibility towards the Galactic
Centre as ANTARES. It is expected that this detector will be able to make definite statements
about a neutrino flux from several Galactic candidates within a few years of operation.

A Shower selection cut parameters

Additional details concerning some of the parameters referred to Table 2 used to define selection
criteria for the shower channel events are given in this section.

Interaction vertex. Reconstructing atmospheric muons with a shower algorithm often re-
sults in reconstructed vertex positions that lie far away from the instrumented volume of
the detector. This can be approximated with a cylindrical structure with a height of 350
m and a radius of 180 m. A cut on the radial distance of the reconstructed shower position
from the vertical axis of the detector (Rsh < 300 m) and on the vertical distance above the
centre of the detector (|Zsh| < 250 m ) are applied.

RDF. A different shower reconstruction algorithm was originally developed for diffuse flux anal-
yses [18]. Among all available quality parameters provided by this reconstruction chain, a
subset of five parameters that showed a high potential to separate atmospheric muon tracks
from shower events was chosen as input in a Random Decision Forest (RDF ) classification.

The distribution of the RDF parameter for cosmic neutrinos and atmospheric muons and
neutrinos after applying the cuts prior to the RDF cut is shown in Figure 12-left. Only
shower events with RDF > 0.3 are used in this analysis.

Muon likelihood. An additional likelihood function has been developed to discriminate be-
tween neutrinos that produce showers and the background of atmospheric muons. This
likelihood considers only hits that coincide with another hit on the same storey (which
contains a triplet of PMTs at the same position in the detector line) within 20 ns. Its prob-
ability density function is based on the time residual (time difference between the detected
and the expected hit from the assumption of a point-like light emission from the simulated

21



vertex position without photon scattering) tres of the hits, the number N of on-time hits
(−20 ns < tres < 60 ns) and the distance d of the hits to the reconstructed shower position.
The parameter to distinguish between showers and muons then is

Lµ =
∑
Hits

log{Psig/Pbkg},

with Psig = P (N, d, tres|ν) and Pbkg = P (N, d, tres|µ).
The distribution for this quantity plotted for atmospheric muons and cosmic showers after
all cuts prior to the muon likelihood cut is shown in Figure 12-right. Shower events with
Lµ < 50 are excluded from the analysis. This method further reduces the number of
atmospheric muons by more than two orders of magnitude.
