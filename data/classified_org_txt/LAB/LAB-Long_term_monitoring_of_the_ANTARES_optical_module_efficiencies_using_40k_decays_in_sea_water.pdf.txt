Abstract

Cherenkov light induced by radioactive decay products is one of the
major sources of background light for deep-sea neutrino telescopes such
as ANTARES. These decays are at the same time a powerful calibration
source. Using data collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope from
mid 2008 to 2017, the time evolution of the photon detection efficiency
of optical modules is studied. A modest loss of only 20% in 9 years
is observed. The relative time calibration between adjacent modules is
derived as well.

1 Introduction

The ANTARES neutrino telescope [1] aims at the exploration of the high-energy
Universe by using neutrinos as cosmic probes. Three main search methods are
exploited. The first one refers to searches for steady neutrino sources, through
the identification of an excess of events from a given sky direction [2]. The second
one searches for an excess of high-energy cosmic neutrinos over the background
of atmospheric events [3]. The third method looks for temporal and/or spatial
correlations with transient events observed through other probes. An example
of this last method is offered by the searches for neutrinos in concomitance with
GW170817 [4]. In addition, the ANTARES detector is used for particle physics
studies, such as neutrino oscillations [5], search for magnetic monopoles [6], and
indirect searches for dark matter [7, 8].

For all these studies, a continuous monitoring of the positioning of all parts
of the detector is needed in order to preserve the precision on the reconstruction
of neutrino-induced events. Moreover, it is necessary to check the stability of the
optical sensors as a function of time, in order to guarantee an equable estimate
of the energy released by charged particles. Studies on the performance as well
as on the stability of optical sensors of this kind have been discussed also by
other Collaborations (e.g. [9, 10]). The originality of the present paper relies
on the use of a natural calibration tool offered by the presence of radioactive
elements dissolved in sea water.

The ANTARES neutrino telescope is located in the Mediterranean Sea,
40 km off the coast of Toulon, France, at a mooring depth of about 2475 m.
The detector was completed in 2008. It is composed of 12 detection lines, each
one equipped with 25 storeys of 3 optical modules (OMs), except line 12 with
only 20 storeys of OMs, for a total of 885 OMs. The horizontal spacing among
the lines is ∼60 m, while the vertical spacing between the storeys is 14.5 m. Each
OM hosts a photomultiplier tube (PMT), whose axis points 45◦ downwards (see
Figure 1). The PMTs are 10-inch tubes from Hamamatsu [11]. The relative po-
sition of each OM in the detector is monitored in real time by a dedicated
positioning system [12]. All signals from the PMTs that pass a threshold of 0.3
single photoelectrons (hits) are digitised and sent to the shore station [13, 14].

for the OMs, which contain one PMT each, facing 45◦ downwards.

The decay products of radioactive elements dissolved in sea water consti-
tute the principal source of background light for deep-sea neutrino telescopes.
Among these isotopes, potassium-40 (40K) is the most abundant. Other ra-
dioactive decays (mainly from the U/Th chain) induce Cherenkov photons on
the permille level compared to 40K decays and can be neglected. This process
constitutes an important calibration tool as well. If a 40K nucleus decays near a
storey, the resulting Cherenkov light can be recorded by two OMs almost simul-
taneously. Such coincidences are used to derive the relative photon detection
efficiencies [15] and for time calibration between OMs in the storey.

The document is organised as follows: in Section 2 the 40K decay rate in sea
water is computed and its stability is discussed; the method for the OM pho-
ton detection efficiency computation using 40K decays is described in Section 3,
together with the data sample employed, while the results of the analysis are
presented in Section 4. A brief explanation on the use of the 40K decay mea-
surements for the time calibration of the detector is given in Section 5, while in
Section 6 conclusions are presented.

2 40K decay rate at the ANTARES site

The main decay channels of 40K are:

40K→ 40Ca + e− + νe (89.3%)

4



40K + e− → 40Ar∗ + νe (10.7%)

↪→ 40Ar + γ
The electron produced in the β-decay channel, with an energy up to 1.3 MeV,

leads to the production of Cherenkov light when traveling in water. In the elec-
tron capture channel, fast electrons with subsequent Cherenkov light emission
are produced by Compton scattering of the 1.46 MeV photon, released by the
excited Ar nuclei.

The detection rate, Rs, of Cherenkov photons from products of
40K decays

on an ANTARES optical module can be factorised as:

Rs = Bq · Vs, (1)

with Bq the
40K decay rate per unit volume and Vs the effective volume around

a single OM for detecting a single photon from a 40K decay. As there is no
preferred decay direction, Vs can be calculated in a semi-analytical way, by
integrating over the decay positions around the OM. One obtains, for a given
wavelength λ, a factorisation into a wavelength-dependent effective area A(λ)
and the corresponding photon absorption length Labs(λ) of sea water. Vs can
then be written as:

Vs = As · L0abs, (2)

with As =
∫
A(λ)Φ(λ)Labs(λ)dλ/ΦtotL

0
abs, with Φ(λ) containing the — arbi-

trarily normalised — λ dependence of the Cherenkov photon flux (close to 1/λ2),
Φtot its integral over a given wavelength range and L

0
abs the absorption length

at some reference wavelength. A(λ) is determined by simulating an isotropic
photon flux around an OM and depends on the OM properties such as the size
of its photocathode, its quantum efficiency, and its angular acceptance. The
PMT quantum efficiency depends on the photon wavelength and it is deduced
from the product sheet as reported in [11]. The absorption length depends on
the photon wavelength as well as parameterized in [16].

The integration to evaluate As is carried out in the wavelength range 300-
600 nm, yielding As = 420 ± 50 cm2. The total uncertainty is dominated by
uncertainties on the mentioned PMT properties (in particular, photocathode
size and angular acceptance).

If a 40K nucleus decays near a storey, the associated Cherenkov light can be
recorded by two OMs almost simultaneously: this kind of signal is referred to
as genuine coincidence. Its rate can be written as:

Rc = Bq · Vc, (3)

where Vc is an effective volume around a pair of OMs for the detection of a
coincident signal from a single 40K decay. The value of Vc is derived from Geant-
3 simulations, modelling 40K decays around a pair of OMs and propagating the
decay products through the sea water with a full tracking of electrons, including
multiple scattering and velocity dependent emission of Cherenkov light. These
simulations yield Vc = 1100 ± 370 cm3. The relative uncertainty of Vc is
significantly larger compared to As for two reasons. Firstly, uncertainties from
two OMs contribute to Vc whereas only one OM contributes to As. Secondly,
as the axes of adjacent OMs are separated by 75.5◦, the uncertainty on the OM

5



angular acceptance has a much larger influence for Vc. The calculation of As,
on the other hand, only depends on its integral value.

Whereas 40K decays can contribute to the rate of a single OM, Rs, up to
a distance of ∼ L0abs, contributions to the rate of genuine coincidences, Rc, are
confined to a small volume in the vicinity of the storey, with 90% occuring within
3 m. At such a distance, the effect of absorption is below 5% and the associated
uncertainties become negligible. The dominating error for Rc originates from
the uncertainties on the OM properties. Therefore the measurement of the
coincidence signals can be directly related to the OM efficiencies. Due to the
large uncertainty of Vc, only relative efficiencies are determined in the following.

Both Rs and Rc depend on Bq, with:

Bq = rs · rK · rI · ρ ·
ln 2

τ1/2
·
NA
A
, (4)

whereNA is the Avogadro number, A = 39.96 [17] and τ1/2 = 1.25×109 years [18]
are the atomic mass and lifetime of 40K, and ρ = 1.038 g/cm3 is the density
of deep-sea water at the ANTARES site, which is derived from in situ mea-
surements of pressure, temperature and salinity, rs. The parameter rK is the
potassium fraction in Mediterranean Sea salt and rI is the isotope fraction
of 40K. The last three quantities can be considered stable over the lifetime
of ANTARES with variations smaller than 1%. The salinity is monitored di-
rectly with the ANTARES instruments and found to be rs = 3.844%, while
rK = 1.11% from [19] and rI = 1.17 · 10−4 from [20].
This yields Bq = 13700 ± 200 s−1m−3.

With this value, Rs = 35 ± 8 kHz and Rc = 15 ± 5 Hz are the single and
genuine coincidence rates obtained from simulations. The observed single pho-
ton rates in ANTARES OMs are about 55 kHz, due to additional light from
bioluminescence that cannot be filtered out at the single photon level. This
phenomenon can result in variations of the single photon rates. Occasionally,
this can produce short bursts (lasting few seconds) with single photon rates
up to several orders of magnitude higher than due to 40K decays [21]. On the
contrary, no variability on similar time scales is observed for the genuine coin-
cidence rates. This seems in agreement with the fact that bioluminescence is
emitted from the reaction of luciferase enzyme occurring at level of single pho-
ton emission only; in any case, bioluminescence does not produce a significant
amount of correlated photons on the nanosecond level in our OMs.

Coincidence signals from low-energy muons do not exceed 1% compared to
the 40K.

3 Detection efficiency calibration using 40K

Data collected from mid 2008 to December 2017 have been analysed in this
work. The 40K trigger selects coincident photons in adjacent OMs if they are
detected within a narrow time window of 50 ns.

From the completion of the detector in May 2008 until November 2009,
dedicated runs with 40K triggers have been taken once per week, with a down-
scaling factor of 4 in order not to saturate the readout data acquisition system.
Runs of the same month have been merged together. In November 2009 the 40K

6



trigger has been integrated into the standard data-taking setup with a down-
scaling factor of 200. Now, each month of data taking has been divided into five
periods each providing a data sample of similar statistics as before.

Both the genuine coincidences induced by the same 40K decay process and
random background coincidences, which are due to distinct 40K decays as well
as to bioluminescence effects, contribute to hit pairs on adjacent OMs with
small time differences ∆t. Figure 2 shows an example of the distribution of
the time difference between hits on two adjacent OMs. A Gaussian peak from
genuine coincidences is clearly visible on top of a flat pedestal from uncorrelated
coincidences.

Figure 2: Example of the detected hit time differences, ∆t, between two adjacent
OMs. The fitted parameters are listed as well (see Equation 5 for details). The
plot refers to one pair of OMs in the same storey (Line 7, Storey 7, OM 0 - OM
1) for one of the periods considered in the analysis.

The distribution of the coincidence signals is fitted with a Gaussian distri-
bution added to a constant:

f(t) = p+ a · exp(−
(t− t0)2

2σ2
), (5)

where p is the baseline, a the amplitude of the Gaussian peak due to genuine
coincidences, σ is the peak width and t0 the residual time offset between the
hits on adjacent OMs. A value of σ ∼ 4 ns is expected, mainly due to the
distance between the OMs and the spatial distribution of detected 40K coinci-
dences around the storey. A simple estimation can be obtained by considering
the difference in the distance traveled by two photons emitted at the same po-
sition and detected by two different PMTs. In ANTARES the distance between
the centers of photocathodes of two PMTs of the same storey is l = 1.0 m (see

7



Figure 1), while the photocathode diameter d is about 25 cm. Therefore, ne-
glecting light scattering, the maximum traveled path difference for two photons
is l + d = 1.25 m. Given the Cherenkov light velocity of vg = 0.217 m/ns, the
corresponding time difference is about 5.8 ns. By averaging over all the 40K
disintegration positions which yield a genuine coincidence, a value of σ = 4 ns
is obtained, compatible with Figure 2.

For perfectly calibrated OMs, t0 would be expected at 0 ns. Deviations from
the expected value of t0 are mainly due to different PMT transit times. This
makes the 40K method an integral part of the time calibration procedure, as
will be discussed in more detail in Section 5.

It has been verified that the parameter p is slightly positively correlated with
the parameter a, but not with the product a · σ. In addition, both a · σ and p
parameters are not correlated with t0.

The fit parameters can be used to estimate the number of events correspond-
ing to the peak area, as:

R =
a · σ ·

√
2π

∆τ
, (6)

where ∆τ = 0.4 ns is the bin width used for the histogram.
For each storey three coincidence rates are measured (R01, R12 and R20).

These quantities are directly related to the photon detection efficiency of the
three OMs (�0, �1 and �2):

Rij = R
∗
c · �i · �j , (7)

where R∗c is the rate for two nominal OMs with efficiencies equal to 1. A value
of R∗c = 15 Hz is used. This value is obtained as an average detector coinci-
dence rate at the beginning of the analysed data set, and coincides with what is
found in simulation. Solving the system of three equations, the corresponding
efficiencies are derived:

�i =

√
1

R∗c

Rij ·Rki
Rjk

. (8)

When an OM in a storey is not working for a given period, only one coinci-
dence rate is measured, which is not sufficient to determine the two efficiencies.
In this case, equal efficiencies for the two working OMs are assumed, namely:

�i = �j =

√
Rij
R∗c

. (9)

If two OMs in a storey are inactive no coincidences can be measured. In
this case the average efficiency value of the line hosting that particular storey
is assigned to the working OM for this period.

All coincidence histograms for all periods have been fitted according to Equa-
tion 5. Data quality selection criteria have been applied, to ensure stable and
reliable input for the subsequent efficiency calculation. A cut on the number of
entries on each histogram, Nentr, excludes from the analysis all those cases for
which the fit fails due to lack of statistics. This includes the cases, for instance,
in which one of the two OMs is only partially active. Taking into account that
there are four fitted parameters and 120 bins in each histogram, a χ2 of 116 is

8



expected for a good fit. Histograms with χ2 > 200 are excluded. Additional
cuts on the fitted amplitude value and its uncertainty, ∆a, have been applied
to ensure a clear signal above the background. Furthermore, expected values of
the Gaussian mean and width are known, thus cuts on these parameters have
been applied. All the selection criteria applied are reported in Table 1.

Accepted Values
Nentr > 2000
χ2 < 200
a > 0.1 Hz
∆a/a < 0.1

1.5 ns < σ < 6.5 ns
|t0| < 20.0 ns

Table 1: Values of data selection criteria applied in the analysis. The parameter
nomenclature corresponds to the one used in Equation 5.

After applying these cuts, the efficiency can be determined on average for
77% of those OMs which are active in a given period. The efficiency of the
remaining working OMs is derived from adjacent OMs or from the average of
the corresponding detection line as described above.

4 Results

Histograms passing the quality criteria are then used to compute the OM photon
detection efficiency, as described in Section 3. Figure 3 shows the photon detec-
tion efficiency as a function of time for one OM as an example. The uncertainty
on the resulting photon detection efficiency of each OM has been calculated
from the uncertainty on the fitted parameters and it is found to be around 3%
for all analysed periods. The total uncertainty is dominated by the statistical
error. The systematic uncertainties (discussed later in this section) contribute
on average only about 20% of the total uncertainty.

Figure 3: Photon detection efficiency as a function of time for one ANTARES
OM (Line 2, Storey 6, OM 0). Error bars correspond to statistical (black) and
statistical plus systematic (red) contributions.

In order to monitor the status of the whole detector over several years, the
average photon detection efficiency � as a function of time has been determined.
For each period, the average � is computed over all OMs with non-zero efficiency.
The result is shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that, after a decrease over
several years, the OM photon detection efficiency has finally stabilised over the
last years. An overall modest detection efficiency loss of 20% is observed over
the whole analysed time period. In 2010, 2012 and 2013 a particular pattern
is observed. The average OM photon detection efficiency drops by 5-10% in
spring and partly recovers in the second half of the year. This might be related
to the formation of dense deep-sea water through a process known as ”open-
sea convection” [22]. As a consequence of such an exchange of deep sea water,
sedimentation as well as biofouling processes might impact the OM photon
detection efficiencies in these periods.

The distribution of the detected charge is regularly monitored for all PMTs
and if either a significant broadening or a shift from the nominal position of the
peak due to a single photoelectron is noticed a recalibration is performed by
means of high voltage tuning (HVT). The HVT procedure adjusts the effective
gain of individual PMTs to the nominal one; the procedure thus prevents de-
tection effeciency losses due to a low gain and bias on the trigger logics. The
effects of the HVT procedure, which is performed once or twice per year, are
evident on the time dependence of � shown in Figure 4. From 2014 on, the
observed pattern is clearly correlated to the HVT campaigns and the modest
annual photon detection efficiency loss is fully recovered every year.

Figure 4: Relative OM efficiency averaged over the whole detector as a function
of time. The blue arrows indicate the periods in which high voltage tuning of
the PMTs has been performed, while error bars indicate the statistical error
σmean on the mean efficiency.

When averaging the efficiencies of individual PMTs over the whole detector,
two statistical quantities are considered: the standard deviation and the error
on the mean. The standard deviation is given by:

σstd =

√
1

N − 1
∑
i

(�i − �)2, (10)

where N is the total number of considered OMs for a given period and �i is the
efficiency of OM i in that particular period. Thanks to the HVT procedure, the
σstd remains stable at the order of 10%, as can be seen in Figure 5, where this
quantity is shown for all analysed periods. This justifies the fact that we used
the average efficiency of the OMs on a given line for those working OMs whose
efficiency cannot be computed through the 40K calibration.

Figure 5: Standard deviation σstd of the relative photon detection efficiency as
a function of time. The blue arrows indicate the periods in which high voltage
tuning of the PMTs has been performed.

The statistical error shown in Figure 4 is the error on the mean, defined as:

σmean =
σstd√
N
. (11)

This quantity is typically of the order of 1%.
Possible systematic uncertainties on the individual OM efficiencies, based on

the assumption on the Gaussian shape for the distribution of the coincidence
rates, have been considered as well. In addition to the intrinsic width of the co-
incidence peak due to the arrival of photons from a 40K decay process, the shape
of the distribution is also affected by photon scattering and the time response
of the PMTs. In order to account for these effects, the analysis considers an
additional Gaussian term with a larger width compared to that already shown
in Equation 5. Using as genuine coincidence rate the sum of the areas under the
two Gaussians, the systematic uncertainty has been evaluated as the difference
between the resulting efficiencies from the two procedures. Generally it is found
that the area under the leading Gaussian is equal to the one of the one Gaussian
fit, and the area under the second Gaussian is compatible with zero within its
error.

It is worth mentioning that the effects due to some known artefacts from
a typical PMT response [11], such as delayed hits, remain undetectable in the
narrow time window used in this work. The calculated efficiencies exclude these
hits, which are later added in the ANTARES simulation chain.

5 Time calibration

In order to meet the target angular resolution of the detector, a time syncro-
nisation between all detector components better than 1 ns is required [23]. To
achieve such precision a master clock system, located onshore, provides a com-
mon reference time to all the offshore electronics, via a network of optical fibers.
Further calibration is needed for the delay between the time when the hit is de-
tected and the photon arrival time at the photocathode of the PMT. These time
calibrations were performed during the detector construction and are continu-
ously monitored on a weekly basis [23]. Two systems of external light sources
are used: LED beacons located on four storeys on each detector line, and laser
beacons located on the base, at the bottom of several detection lines. They allow
to perform both inter-line and inter-storey time calibrations [24]. Reconstruc-
tions of tracks from downward going muons created in cosmic-ray interactions
in the atmosphere are used as well to determine inter-line and inter-storey time
calibrations [25]. The 40K method completes the time calibration chain by pro-
viding intra-storey timing. All three methods combined assure a precision level
of 0.5 ns for each individual PMT.

In Figure 6 the distribution of the fitted time offset, t0, obtained from the
40K coincidence histogram of one OM pair is shown as a function of time.

Figure 6: Fitted time offset as a function of time for one OM pair (Line 2,
Storey 6, OM 2 - OM 0). The blue arrows indicate the periods in which high
voltage tuning of the PMTs has been performed.

It can be seen that between subsequent HVT procedures the time difference
between two adjacent OMs is stable and its value can be monitored to better
than 0.5 ns. These values, which are produced for each OM pair, serve as input
for the intra-storey calibration procedure.

The standard deviation of the time offset distribution, averaged over the
whole detector, is illustrated in Figure 7. The apparent trend is an increase of
the standard deviation as a function of time (from ∼ 2 to ∼ 4.5 ns in 9 years).
This increase could be correlated to the HVT procedure, which is performed in
order to keep the OM detection efficiency at their best. This procedure, in fact,
adjusts each individual PMT gain by affecting their transit time, resulting in
an overall increase of the standard deviation.

6 Conclusions and outlook

Using data collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope with a dedicated 40K
trigger, the photon detection efficiencies for all OMs have been computed from
mid 2008 to the end of 2017. The paper presents the stability of a PMT based
detector in the hostile environment of the deep-sea, for the longest period ever
recorded. It demonstrates that future underwater experiments can remain in
operation for timescale of at least a decade without major efficiency degradation.
An average decrease of the OM efficiency by 20%, as observed from 2008 to 2017,
implies a loss of only 15% in the detection efficiency of an astrophysical signal
with a full sky E−2 spectrum. The effect of PMT ageing is surely present. The
best way to test the biofouling development is the recovery the the OMs, which
is planned at the end of the ANTARES physical operation, around 2020.

The results of this study serve as input for detailed Monte Carlo simula-
tions of the ANTARES detector, which include a realistic simulation of the OM

efficiencies in each data taking run. The 40K method is also part of the time
calibration of the detector.

This procedure can be also exploited in KM3NeT, the next-generation neu-
trino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea [26]. KM3NeT will consist of two
main detectors, ARCA in Sicily, devoted to high energy astroparticle physics,
and ORCA in France, focused on few-GeV atmospheric neutrino studies. They
both use a configuration similar to the one of ANTARES, but with 31 instead
of three PMTs on each storey. This will allow to collect not only double coinci-
dences from 40K decays, but also higher multiplicities, improving the technique
to determine the photon detection efficiencies.
