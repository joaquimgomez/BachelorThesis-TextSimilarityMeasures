Evidence of Cnidarians sensitivity 
to sound after exposure to low 
frequency underwater sources

Jellyfishes represent a group of species that play an important role in oceans, particularly as a food 
source for different taxa and as a predator of fish larvae and planktonic prey. The massive introduction 
of artificial sound sources in the oceans has become a concern to science and society. While we 
are only beginning to understand that non-hearing specialists like cephalopods can be affected by 
anthropogenic noises and regulation is underway to measure European water noise levels, we still don’t 
know yet if the impact of sound may be extended to other lower level taxa of the food web. Here we 
exposed two species of Mediterranean Scyphozoan medusa, Cotylorhiza tuberculata and Rhizostoma 
pulmo to a sweep of low frequency sounds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed injuries in 
the statocyst sensory epithelium of both species after exposure to sound, that are consistent with the 
manifestation of a massive acoustic trauma observed in other species. The presence of acoustic trauma 
in marine species that are not hearing specialists, like medusa, shows the magnitude of the problem of 
noise pollution and the complexity of the task to determine threshold values that would help building 
up regulation to prevent permanent damage of the ecosystems.

From an ecological point of view, the Coelenterates (Cnidarians and Ctenophora) play a central role in marine 
ecosystems and are key as a food source for different taxa1,2, as well as a predator of eggs, fish larvae, small plank-
tonic and nektonic prey3,4. Coelenterates may also help maintaining high biodiversity by preventing the monop-
olization of biomass by extremely successful competitors5. Between Cnidarians, coral reef provide an habitat to 
a rich diversity of animals, some of them commercially fished species, including crustaceans and other inverte-
brates, fish, algae and seaweed. Unfortunately, some activities with a huge economic impact as scuba tourism and 
a large worldwide trade in coral for aquariums and jewellery have resulted in the destruction of many of these 
resources. In addition, some Scyphozoan medusa are targeted by major fisheries with a strong economic signifi-
cance6,7. Cnidaria are used as a model in evolutionary and developmental biology, ecology and morphology. Their 
structural simplicity, due their basic position on the Metazoan tree, allows revealing basic questions on Cnidaria, 
which could be treated as a paradigm of general issues, impossible to perform otherwise on more evolved taxa5.

Many factors, both from natural or artificial origins, may alter the role of medusa in the marine food web and 
may have a direct effect on the oceanic environment and economic interests. The effects of influential factors, 
like the temperature, salinity and food availability on the development of organisms in marine environment have 
been well described in the literature8–13. Recently, levels of introduced anthropogenic underwater sounds have 
increased significantly over the last century and anthropogenic noise is now recognized as a significant stressor for 
marine and freshwater fauna. In particular, the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) 
has introduced noise (and other source of energy) in the list of eleven descriptors of the Good Environmental 
Status of the Ocean14. While the noise descriptor does not yet address the effects of noise on marine organisms 
but provides a standardized protocol to measure and monitor noise levels in EU waters, there is an urgent need 
to define and quantify the added spatial-temporal variability of acoustic pollution from different sources and 
identify the resulting short, medium or long-term changes and effects on marine fauna. However, we face the 
relative lack of information on the sound processing and analysis mechanisms in most marine animals15,16. While 
advances have been made in understanding the effects on marine mammals17–21 and fishes22–24, data on the effects

on marine invertebrates is still scarce. Much remains to be learned about the hearing or sound-producing capabil-
ities of invertebrates and how they respond to, and are potentially affected by, man-made sounds. However, a few 
studies on invertebrate sensitivity to noise and possible negative effects after sound exposure have been recently 
published25–34. A detailed literature review on these effects can be found in recent publications35–37.

Ctenophores38 and Cnidarians, both in the polyp and the medusa stage, poses sensory organs able to detect 
vibrations in water associated to prey movement. Hydrozoan and Cubozoan polyps have different types of cells 
bearing specialized cilia as well, which are located in their tentacles and act as mechanoreceptors39–42. Their func-
tion is to inform the animals of the changes in their surrounding environment.

Medusa present receptors that respond to light, touch, gravity, chemicals, sound pressure waves, direction, 
vibration, and hydrostatic pressure43. Sensitivity to sound pressure waves and vibration, which detection is medi-
ated by directionally sensory ciliary hairs, has been inferred from behavioural observations on Aurelia labiata 
under turbulent water. It was shown that the stimulus for this behaviour was vibration or sound pressure waves 
from the turbulent water above them44. Scyphozoan medusae (disc-shaped or “true” jellyfish) are some of the 
most primitive forms of life to develop pelagic medusa stages with marginal sense organs bearing statocysts45. 
Each Scyphozoan medusa forms numerous small crystals, which are collected in sac-like statocyst located at 
the distal ends of their rhopalia (Fig. 1). Rhopalia are complex sensory organs, which have been associated with 
pulsing, swimming and orientation and that act as gravireceptors, which enable medusae to position themselves 
in an upright posture after tilting46. The chemical composition (bassanite calcium sulphate hemihydrate)47, the 
crystallography and the morphology of the crystals (statolith) contained in the statocysts have been examined in 
some species of Scyphozoan medusa; their differential features were used for taxonomical relationships identifi-
cation of jellyfish and had led to the development of an age-determination method for jellyfish48–50.

Rhopalia are sensitive bodies located around the bell margin in Scyphozoan medusae with a number typically 
being in multiples of four51,52. The structure of scyphozoan rhopalia can be seen in Fig. 1. Each rhopalium pre-
sents a statocyst at its terminal end (Fig. 1) containing many refractive crystals. The statocyst role is relevant for 
the gravity-sensing function of the rhopalium; the statocyst together with the adjacent sensory areas work as a 
gravity organ in Scyphozoan rhopalia53–57 When the medusa is tilted, gravity pulls up the statocyst, bending the 
body of the rhopalium, so that cilia on the sensory cells in the sensory plate make contact with or are removed 
away from the overlying epithelium (hood). The mechanical stimuli trigger the upright positioning behaviour, 
which occurs by asymmetric contraction of the swimming muscle to restore the balance against the gravitational 
force46.

The aim of the present study was to contribute to a better understanding of the sensitivity to human-generated 
noise of Scyphozoan medusa by comparatively describing the ultrastructure of two species presents in the 
Mediterranean Sea (Cotylorhiza tuberculata (Cepheidae) and Rhizostoma pulmo (Rhizostomatidae) statocyst sen-
sory epithelium after exposure to sound.

Results
Cotylorhiza tuberculata and Rhizostoma pulmo rhopalia morphology. In C. tuberculata, between 4 
and 8 rhopalia were present in each individual depending on its diameter at the bell margin, hanging downwards 
between the clefts of the marginal lappets. In all studied R. pulmo individuals, 8 rhopalia were present for each 
individual. The rhopalium of the two species consisted of a proximal bulb and a distal statocyst containing the sta-
tolith crystals (Figs 1A, 2 and 3). The statocyst was covered by a layer (hood) situated in the area between the bulb 
and the statocyst. There are two densely ciliated sensory areas on the epithelium which cover the statocyst, one 
nearest the hood and other on the opposite proximal side of the statocyst (Figs 1A, 2 and 3). On the most distal 
part of the statocyst (Fig. 4A–C), coinciding with the area occupied by statolith (Fig. 5A–C), the sensory cells are 
more scattered and less abundant. Sensory areas are characterized by hair cells carrying nonmotile kinocilia on 
their surface. Each long straight kinocilium is surrounded by a short crown (“a sort of folded crater”) of stereocilia 
around the central shaft (Figs 6A–C, 7A–C and 8B-C). The rhopaliar canal, containing the rhopalia, has inner 
totally covered by a ciliated epithelium (Fig. 4D–F).

As in other rhopaliophoran medusae, the statocysts of these two Sciphozoan medusae are found to be com-
posed of bassanite (calcium sulphate hemihydrate), Fig. 5C. The elemental analysis performed by EDX showed 
mainly the presence of calcium, sulphur and oxygen, indicating the presence of calcium sulphate. Statocysts 
mostly consist of an accumulation of single crystals (statoliths) of small size surrounded by gastrodermal cells in 
both examined species (Fig. 5A,B).

Numerous cnidocysts (organelle used for capture of prey and defense, consisting of a cylindrical capsule, 
which releases a long tubule upon triggering) covered the marginal lappets and the surface of the C. tuberculata 
and R. pulmo rophalium. Two types of cnidocysts, haplonemes and euryteles, were present in the two Sciphozoan 
medusa species (Fig. 5D,E).

Ultrastructural analysis of the statocyst sensory epithelium. This study characterized some of the 
ultrastructural changes that took place following acoustic damage to the Cnidarians statocyst sensory epithelia. 
Regardless of the species, all exposed individuals presented the same lesions in the statocyst sensory epithelium 
and the same incremental effects versus time. Damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented bent, 
flaccid or missed kinocilia and stereocilia.

Cotylorhiza tuberculata sensory epithelium. After sound exposure (Figs 6D–F and 7D–Q) in comparison with 
the same tissues from control animals (Figs 6A–C and 7A–C), damage was observed on the sensory epithelium 
by SEM analysis.

On animals sacrificed 48 h after sound exposure (Figs 6D and 7D,E,H,K,M), the sensory epithelium presented 
hair cells partially (showing their swollen apical pole) or totally ejected from the sensory epithelium. The apical 
ciliated apex and part of the cellular body were extruded above the sensory epithelium into the statocyst cavity 
(Fig. 6D). A considerable number of hair cells had totally lost the unique kinocilium or exhibited bent or swollen 
kinocilia (Figs 6D and 7M) and the crown of stereocilia surrounding the large kinocilium was lost or totally fused 
(Fig. 7H,K). The hair cells presented large bubbles (Fig. 7D) onto moderate swollen apical poles (Fig. 7E).

On animals sacrificed 96 hours after sound exposure (Figs 6E,F and 7F,G,I,J,L,N–Q) the lesions reported in the 
sensory epithelia of the previous groups of exposed animals were present and the effects incremented versus time. 
Some hair cells presented spherical holes (Fig. 7G) and rupture of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7F) at the base of 
kinocilia, probably due to the swelling and extrusion of the cellular body. The sensory epithelia presented totally 
extruded or ejected hair cells (Fig. 7N–Q) leaving large extensions of holes on the sensory epithelia (Fig. 6E,F).

The remaining cells exhibited bent or flaccid kinocilia or had lost them (Figs 6E and 7L). The crown of stereocilia 
of the sensory cells was lost or totally fused (Fig. 7I,J,L).

Rhizostoma pulmo sensory epithelium. Serious damage was found in the sensory epithelium from 48 h (Fig. 8H) 
until 96 h (Fig. 8D–G,I,J) after sound exposure in comparison with the same tissues from control animals 
(Fig. 8A–C).

Forty eight hours after sound exposure (Fig. 8H), a rupture of the plasma membrane, due the extrusion of 
the internal cellular material could be seen at the base of the hair cells. As a consequence, ciliated hair cells were 
partially ejected from the sensory epithelium. Some individuals showed bent and flaccid or lost kinocilia in their 
hair cells. Sometimes, the crown of stereocilia was found to be fused or totally lost and the epithelium showed 
remaining holes. The extrusions of hair cells were most evident and the extruded hair cells body was visible on the 
surface of the sensory epithelium.

On the individuals sacrificed 96 h after sound exposure (Fig. 8D–G,I,J) the same lesions were present, but 
in addition, the protrusion of large fragments of sensory epithelia left extremely interesting images where the 
remaining (and almost) extruded hair cells showed bent and flaccid or lost kinocilia (Fig. 8D–G). Large exten-
sions of the epithelium presented holes as a consequence of the total hair cells extrusion (Fig. 8I). Some individu-
als presented some bent, flaccid microvilli showing swollen tips (Fig. 8J).

Image and Data analysis. The abnormal features we identified on the surface of sound-exposure epithelia 
included damaged hair cell (kinocilium or surrounding sterocilia partially or entirely missing or fused), extruded 
(hair cell partially extruded of the epithelium) and missing hair cell (hole in the epithelium caused by the total 
extrusion of the hair cell). The number of damaged, extruded and missing hair cells was computed for each image. 
In both species, the number of damaged, extruded and missing hair cell increased with time (Fig. 9A,C).

Damage was chosen to be quantified as the percentage of extruded and missing hair cells because these are 
well-defined and easy-to-compare categories. The presence of extruded cells showed the start of severe damage 
after sound exposure. All control animals were in good health status (not showing extruded or missing hair cells 
on the sensory epithelia) and all exposed animals had various degrees of damage; no statistical analysis was there-
fore performed to test the difference between the two groups. We concluded that statocyst epithelium was affected 
by exposure to sound in both species (Fig. 9B,D).

After performing statistical tests, the quantification analysis showed that the severity of the lesions, quanti-
fied as number of extruded/missing hair cells, increased with time in C. tuberculata and R. pulmo (p =  0,001) 
(Fig. 10A,D). The severity of the lesions, quantified as number of extruded/missing hair cells, increased with time.

Regarding the differences between regions, we compared the 5% and 25% regions of the two species 
(Figs 2C and 3D). The results show that there was no difference in damage between 5% and 25% regions in ani-
mals observed 48 h after sound exposure (p =  0,07), nor 96 h after sound exposure in C. tuberculata (p =  0,14) 
(Fig. 10B,C). In the case of R. pulmo, there was no difference in damage between 5% and 25% regions in animals 
observed 48 h after sound exposure (p =  0,66), but there was a difference between 5% and 25% regions in animals 
observed 96 h after sound exposure (p =  0,001) (Fig. 10E,F).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study shows the first published SEM images of the C. tuberculata and R. pulmo 
statocyst sensory epithelium. No previous ultrastructural studies have been carried out on these two species. 
As in other Sciphozoan medusa like P. periphylla48 or Nausithoe punctata55, we show that the sensory areas are 
characterized by nonmotile kinocilia surrounded by a crown of stereocilia that projects in the sea water towards 
the opposite side of the fold in which these cells lie. As in P. periphylla48 the density of these ciliated sensory 
areas differs along the rophalia. There are two densely ciliated sensory areas on the epithelium, which cover 
the rhopalia, one nearest the hood and other on the opposite proximal side of the statocyst. On the most distal 
part of the statocyst, the sensory cells are more scattered and less abundant. Since the publication of the first 
comparative study on the evolution of the statocyst sensory epithelia by Horridge55, which described a unique 
kinocilium surrounded by a crown on stereocilia in different species of Cnidarians, until the description of the 
most evolved sensory systems among the invertebrates, which present sensory bundles of kinocilia on hair cells

in cephalopods58–61, it appears that the role of the kinocilium as a transducer of the sensory signal is fundamental 
for the mechanoreception process. Some studies analysed the structure and function of the nervous plexus in 
Sciphozoan51,54,62 and Cubozoan medusa62,63. Chapman54 hypothesized the neurite origin on the intraepithelial 
flagella in A. aurita. The structure, function and evolution of the statocysts and the role of three types of sensory 
receptors were described by Aglanta digitale (Hydromedusae)64,65. Further analysis at different live stages, includ-
ing the period of development and aging, are needed for a better description of these sensory ultrastructures in 
C. tuberculata and R. pulmo.

Some authors previously reported that statolith of ropaliophoran medusa are composed of basanite (calcium 
sulphate hemihydrate)47,57,66,67. We confirmed that the chemical composition on the C. tuberculata and R. pulmo 
statocyst is basanite. In these two species, the statolith mostly consists of an aggregation of single crystals. This sta-
tolith structure is common among Scyphozoan medusa1,47. The statolith crystals are surrounded by gastrodermal 
cells in Scyphozoan medusa. As in P. periphylla48 the whole statocyst is filled with gastrodermis cells that contain 
the statolith. The same statolith chemical composition (basanite) was found in other Scyphozoan medusa47,48,64. 
Calcium sulphate hemihydrate is, to date, known only in rophaliophoran medusa. It makes it a very specific  
feature with an important taxonomic value.

Cnidocyst nomenclature is based on the structure of the tubule and its armature68–70. We found only two types 
of cnidocysts, haplonemes and euryteles covering the marginal lappets and the surface of the C. tuberculata and 
R. pulmo rophalium. Haplonemes were egg-shaped, with a regularly coiled tubule inside and had an operculum 
that split off from the capsule during discharge. In euryteles, which is thought to be related with the function of 
predation49, the capsules opened without the operculum splitting off and comprised round to ovoid capsules 
containing an irregularly tubule inside49. Recent studies identified eurytele and birhopaloid (type II) cnidocysts, 
having broad and prominent shafts in C. tuberculata68–70. Specific studies have shown that Rhizostoma pulmo has 
four types of cnidocysts, which according to the classification of Mariscal71 were indicated to be heterotrichous 
microbasic euryteles, holotrichous isorhizas, atrichous a-isorhizas and atrichous-isorhizas72. In Rhizostoma octo-
pus planula only one cnidocyst type, atrichous haplonema, and heterotrichous microbasic euryteles in polyps, 
ephyrae, and medusa were observed49. The presence of the only two types of cnidocyst in our specimens is proba-
bly due to the concentration of our observation to the rhopaliar area because of our interest in the effects of sound 
in the sensory epithelium of the statocyst.

Our study shows the first ultrastructural images, which characterize some of the changes in the Cnidarians 
statocyst sensory epithelia after sound exposure. We also show that increased damage takes place with time after 
sound exposure and it is greatest in the same region where significant hair cell extrusion and loss occur. Intact 
hair cells maintained the kinocilia structure, whereas damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented 
bent, flaccid or missed kinocilia and stereocilia. The mechanism by which sound induces such damage has yet 
to be determined. In cephalopods, it was shown that the vibration of the whole animal body exposed to sound, 
encompassed the vibration of the statolith, which is located in the cephalic cartilage73. Here, in the case of medusa, 
statocysts are directly exposed to the surrounding environment and it could be anticipated that propagating 
vibrations directly triggers movements of the statoliths induced by the external sensory epithelia, independently 
of the main body vibration.

In terrestrial vertebrates, exposure to very high sound pressure levels may result in the destruction of sensory 
hair cells of the inner ear leading to a permanent hearing loss74,75. The same pathology could be caused by expo-
sure to lower levels for longer periods that also lead to the death of sensory cells76. Some research reported dam-
age on sensory cells in ears of some fish species after exposure to pure tones or seismic air gun77–80. Other studies 
suggest that fish sensory epithelia could regenerate after damaged caused by sound exposure81–84 and evidenced 
a tonotopic organization in teleost saccule, which is thought to be the primary auditory receptor in this group of 
fishes84. Morphological effects on sensory epithelia could lead to temporary deafness that could result on the fish 
incapacity to respond to presence of predators and to locate preys and mates. Due the differences in fish species 
hearing systems, the limited data of precise stimulus (pressure and/or particle velocity) and frequency compo-
nents of the signals, it is necessary to be extremely cautious when extrapolating results.

Further work is needed to determine whether tonotopic mapping of frequencies takes place in Cnidarians 
statocyst sensory epithelia, as it was determined in zebrafish83 and goldfish84 saccule. Several factors could be 
involved in the mechanism that contribute to tonotopic mapping in the fish saccule: the differential vibration of

the otolith in function of the differential frequency85, the characteristics themselves of the sensory cells84,86,87, its 
mode of attachment to the otolithic membrane88 and the central processing of the sensory stimulus88–90 between 
others. Similar features were suggested to be vital for sound processing in cephalopods58,60,61, but no tonotopic 
mapping studies on any invertebrate species has been yet conducted.

In invertebrates, the data of the morphological and physiological effects of noise exposure in sound detection 
systems are scarce and limited. Our previous works on cephalopods presented the first morphological and ultra-
structural evidence of a massive acoustic trauma induced on individuals belonging to four cephalopod species 
(S. officinalis, O. vulgaris, L. vulgaris and I. coindetii) by low frequency sound Controlled Exposure Experiments 
(CEE), in laboratory conditions35–37. The consequences of such CEE were permanent and substantial alterations 
of the sensory hair cells of the statocysts. In laboratory experiments35–37, cephalopod statocyst sensory epithelia 
presented similar lesions to those described here in medusae.

These results support the idea that vibration or sound pressure waves detection is mediated by directionally 
sensitive ciliary hairs55,91 located in the cnidarians statocyst. Behaviour observations92 suggested that Aurelia sp. 
have a distance sensing ability. Sensitivity to sound pressure waves appears to be the only known sensory system 
that might participate in distance sensing Pelagia noctiluca also appears to have a distance sensing ability that

helps them avoiding stranding. Turning and swimming down were also found to be elicited when ebb tides swept 
A. labiata over the gravel bar at the entrance to Roscoe Bay44. The effective stimulus may have been tumbling in 
turbulent water, vibration, or sound pressure waves. Swimming down has to be modulated by stimuli indicating 
the depth of the water column. Feedback from the statocysts would be needed to guide downward swimming in 
the turbulent water24.

As for the location of the observed damage, it was located on the distal part of the rhopalia, mainly coincident 
with statocyst position (5–25% of the total rhopaliar length). The lack of any lesion in statocyst control animals, 
together with the similarity of the injuries found in previous experiments with cephalopods after exposure to

the same acoustic stimulus, allow us to conclude on a common cause-to-effect relationship between sound and 
trauma in all exposed individuals.

In addition with the statocyst sensory system, mechanoreceptors associated with cnidocysts may also con-
tribute to vibration and sound pressure wave sensitivity. Cnidocysts of cnidarians contain mechanoreceptors 
that along with chemoreceptors modulate the sensitivity of nematocysts. There are neural connections between 
cnidocysts93. Cnidocysts are distributed over most of the surface of Aurelia sp. mediating its somatosensory sen-
sitivity92. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to suggest that the mechanoreceptors associated with the cnidocysts of 
Aurelia sp. send axons into the central nervous system and sub-serve a somatosensory function66. Further studies 
also needed to determine the effects of sound exposure on cnidocysts and its role on vibration and sound pressure 
wave detection.

The structure of pelagic ecosystems can change rapidly due to climate change, eutrophication, overfishing, 
translocations and habitat modification. In these changing habitats, the increasing introduction of noise certainly 
represents an additional pressure to the ecosystems and it may dramatically affect ocean soundscapes. Regulation 
is not including marine invertebrates in the list of species that are sensitive to human-generated noise and that 
need to be considered for mitigation. The presence of acoustic trauma in marine species that are not hearing 
specialists, like medusa, shows the magnitude of the problem of noise pollution and the complexity of the task to 
determine threshold values that would help building up management actions to understand and prevent perma-
nent damage of the ecosystems.

Methods
Twelve individuals from C. tuberculata (bell diameter 10–22 cm) and six R. pulmo (bell diameter 13–20 cm) were 
obtained from the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean Sea) and kept in a closed system of recirculating natural 
seawater (at 18–20 °C, salinity 35‰ and natural oxygen pressure) consisting of 2 mechanically filtered fiberglass 
reinforced plastic tanks with a capacity of 2000 L, that were connected to each other (LAB-UPC, Vilanova i la 
Geltrú) (Fig. 11). This included a physicochemical self-filtration system with activated carbon and sand, driven 
by a circulation pump. Individuals were maintained in the tank system until the exposure. Several specimens

(see below) were used as controls and were kept in the same conditions as the experimental animals until being 
exposed to noise.

Sound Exposure Protocol. Sequential Controlled Exposure Experiments (CEE) were conducted on indi-
viduals of C. tuberculata (n =  8) and R. pulmo (n =  4). An additional set of individuals of C. tuberculata (n =  4) 
and R. pulmo (n =  2) was used as a control. Individuals were maintained in the tank system (tank A) until the time 
of exposure. The exposure consisted of a 50–400 Hz sinusoidal wave sweeps with 100% duty cycle and a 1-second

sweep period for two hours. The sweep was produced and amplified through an in-air loudspeaker while the level 
received was measured by a calibrated B&K 8106 hydrophone (RL =  157 ±  5 dB re 1 μ Pa with peak levels up to 
SPL =  175 dB re 1μ Pa). Some of the animals were used as controls and were kept in the same conditions as the 
exposed animals until the latter were exposed to noise, in an independent tank (C). The sacrificing process was 
identical for controls and exposed animals. After the exposure, the individuals were placed in tank B (see Fig. 1136 
and sequence of sacrifices below). The independent experimental tank (C) was located in a separate location, 
acoustically isolated from tanks A and B. Following exposure, the samples (Fig. 11) were obtained from the indi-
viduals (exposed and controls) at 48 h and 96 h after sound exposure.

Removal of statocysts. In all experiments, the whole rhopalia, containing the statocyst, were detached and 
chemically fixed for observation and analysis. Between four and eight rhopalia were obtained for each individual 
depending on its diameter. Each rhopalium was cut open and flattened out to expose the sensory epithelia sur-
rounding the statocyst structures and special care was taken to prevent mechanical damage to the tissues.

Light microscopy (LM). Previous to the individual statocyst dissection from the rhopalia some light 
microscopy images of the whole structure were taken to clarify the morphology and location of the statocyst. The 
result section will thus concentrate on a qualitative ultrastructural description of the rhopalia sensory structures.

Scanning electron microscopy. Forty eight statocysts from 12 C. tuberculata and 24 statocysts from 6 R. pulmo  
were used for this study. Fixation was performed in 2, 5% glutaraldehyde for 24–48 h at 4 °C. Statocysts were 
dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions and critical-point dried with CO2 in a Bal-Tec CPD 030 unit (Leica 
Mycrosystems, Austria). The dried rhopalia were cut, open and flattened out to expose the statocyst structures 
and then mounted on specimen stubs with double-sided tape. The mounted tissues were gold-palladium coated 
with a Polaron SC500 sputter coated unit (Quorum Technologies, Ltd.) and viewed with a variable pressure 
Hitachi S3500N scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Ltd, Japan) at an accelerating 
voltage of 5 kV in the Institute of Marine Sciences of the Spanish Research Council (CSIC) facilities. The chemical 
composition of the statolith crystals were additionally analysed with a Quantax Energy Dispersive Spectrometer 
(EDS) (Bruker AXS). The software used to analyse the spectra was Esprit 1.8 (Bruker AXS).

Quantification and Data analysis. We considered for the analysis the region comprising the sensory 
areas of the statocyst. The length of the area comprising hair cells was determined for each sample, and 900 μ m2 
(30 ×  30 μ m) sampling squares were placed along the centre length of the area at 5, 25, 50, and 75% of the length 
on axe of the statocyst (Figs 2 and 3). The hair cell bundle densities at the most proximal tip of the area (from 75% 
-in C. tuberculata- and 50% -in R. pulmo- of length measured) were too high to accurately quantify; therefore, we 
chose not to attempt quantification of hair bundle density and damage in this area. The area quantified is coinci-
dent with the position of the statocyst into the rhopalium.

Hair cell damage was analysed by classifying the hair cells as intact (hair cell undamaged), damaged (kinocil-
ium or surrounding sterocilia partially or entirely missing or fused), extruded (hair cell partially extruded of the 
epithelium) and missing (hole in the epithelium caused by the total extrusion of the hair cell).

Damage was quantified as the percentage of extruded and missing hair cells. The damaged category included 
a wide range of different types of lesions with different severities; this makes direct comparison between animals 
more difficult. The extruded and missing categories are well-defined and are easier compared and the presence of 
extruded cells shows the limit of severe damage after sound exposure.

Damage due to sound exposure was tested using permutation tests. Data was summed over all regions. 
Damage was measured as the percentage of extruded and missing hair cells. Permutation tests were repeated 
multiple times with N =  1000. The influence of recovery time after sound exposure in groups of animals sacrificed 
48 h vs 96 h after sound exposure was tested using permutation tests repeated multiple times with N =  1000. The 
difference in damage between regions was measured as the percentage of extruded and missing hair cells per 
region 5% vs 25% region at 48 h and 96 h after sound exposure using permutation tests repeated multiple times 
with N =  1000.

The original version of this Article contained errors.

The Title,

“Evidence of Cnidarians sensitivity to sound after exposure to low frequency noise underwater sources”

now reads:

“Evidence of Cnidarians sensitivity to sound after exposure to low frequency underwater sources”

The author José Manuel Fortuño, was incorrectly given as José Manuel Fontuño.

In addition, the legend of Figure 5:

The broken crystal allows to see the inner structure of the statolith. (C) Chemical analysis of statolith shows the 
mainly presence of calcium, sulphur and oxygen. Au and Pd peaks appears because sample was previously coated 
with Au-Pd. (D)R. pulmo discharged eurytele cnidocyst. The operculum is bent up after discharge of the tubule. 
The shaft bears long. Insert in (D) R. pulmo discharged haploneme cnidocyst. The operculum split off from 
the capsule during the discharge of the tubule. (E) C. tuberculata discharged eurytele cnidocyst (c: capsule, o:-
