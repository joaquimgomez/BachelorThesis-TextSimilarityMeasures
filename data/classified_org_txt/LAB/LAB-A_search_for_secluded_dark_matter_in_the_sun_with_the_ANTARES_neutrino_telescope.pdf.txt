Abstract

A search for Secluded Dark Matter annihilation in the Sun us-
ing 2007-2012 data of the ANTARES neutrino telescope is presented.
Three different cases are considered: a) detection of dimuons that re-
sult from the decay of the mediator, or neutrino detection from: b)
mediator that decays into a dimuon and, in turn, into neutrinos, and
c) mediator that decays directly into neutrinos. As no significant ex-
cess over background is observed, constraints are derived on the dark
matter mass and the lifetime of the mediator.

1 Introduction

There is strong cosmological and astrophysical evidence for the existence of
Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe. The observations indicate that DM,
about 26% of the total mass-energy of the Universe, is non-baryonic, non-
relativistic and not subject to electromagnetic interactions [1]. In the frame-
work of the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) paradigm, the
visible baryonic part of a galaxy is embedded in the DM halo. In the most
common scenario, WIMPs can scatter elastically with matter and become
trapped in massive astrophysical objects such as the Sun[2]. There, DM
particles could self-annihilate, reaching equilibrium between capture and
annihilation rates over the age of the Solar System. The standard scenario
assumes that the products of DM annihilation are Standard Model (SM)
particles, which interact with the interior of the Sun and are largely ab-
sorbed [3]. However, during this process, high-energy neutrinos may be
produced, which can escape and be observed by neutrino detectors, such
as ANTARES. Limits on WIMP DM annihilation in the Sun have been re-
ported already in ANTARES [4], and in other neutrino telescopes: Baksan
[5], Super-Kamiokande [6] and IceCube [7, 8].

An alternative hypothesis is based on the idea that DM is “secluded”
from SM particles and that the annihilation is only possible through a
metastable mediator (φ), which subsequently decays into SM states [9, 10,
11, 12, 13]. These models retain the thermal relic WIMP DM scenario while
at the same time explain the positron-electron ratio observed by PAMELA

[14], FERMI [15], and measured recently by AMS-II with improved accuracy
[16, 17]. In the Secluded Dark Matter (SDM) scenario, the presence of a
mediator dramatically changes the annihilation signature of DM captured in
the Sun. If the mediators live long enough to escape the Sun before decay-
ing, they can produce fluxes of charged particles, γ-rays or neutrinos [18, 19]
that could reach the Earth and be detected. In many of the secluded dark
matter models, φ can decay into leptons near the Earth. The signature of
leptons arising from φ decays may differ substantially from other DM mod-
els. Assuming that the DM mass (∼ 1 TeV) is much greater than the φ mass
(∼ 1 GeV) the leptons are boosted. If these leptons are muons, which is the
less constrained case to explain the positron-electron ratio [20, 21, 22], the
signature in the vicinity of the detector would be two almost parallel muon
tracks. In Ref. [23] this possibility is discussed and the expected sensitivity
for the IceCube neutrino telescope is calculated. Why a neutrino telescope
generally interprets the dimuon signature as a single muon, the different
energy deposition can help to discriminate this case from a muon induced
by a neutrino interaction [24]. On the other hand, even for short-lived me-
diators that decay before reaching the Earth, neutrinos from the products
of mediator decays could be detected in neutrino telescopes as well. Finally,
another possibility is that mediators may decay directly into neutrinos [25].
In this case, the neutrino signal could be enhanced significantly compared
to the standard scenario even for quite short-lived mediators. The medi-
ators will be able to escape the dense core of the Sun where high-energy
neutrinos can interact with nuclei and be absorbed. The fact that the solar
density decreases exponentially with radius facilitates neutrinos injected by
mediators at larger radii to propagate out of the Sun.

In this work an indirect search for SDM using the 2007-2012 data recorded
by the ANTARES neutrino telescope is reported. The analysis treats the
different mediator decay products:

a) direct detection of dimuons

b) neutrinos from decays of dimuons produced by mediators that decay
before reaching the Earth

c) neutrinos produced by mediators that decay directly to neutrinos and
antineutrinos.

The analysis procedure is similar to the previous ANTARES search for DM
annihilation in the Sun [4], but optimising the search for the expected signal
in the case of SDM. In the following, neutrino will mean neutrino plus anti-
neutrino, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

2 The ANTARES neutrino telescope

The ANTARES neutrino telescope [26] is located in the Mediterranean Sea,
at a depth of 2.5 km, about 40 km offshore from Toulon (France). It is
presently the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern hemisphere and
consists of 885 Optical Modules (OMs) arranged in a three-dimensional ar-
ray. The operation principle is based on the detection of the Cherenkov
light induced by relativistic charged particles produced in interactions of
high-energy neutrinos in the surroundings of the detector. The OMs are
installed along 12 lines anchored to the sea floor and kept vertical by a sub-
merged buoy. The length of the lines is 450 m and the distance between the
lines is 60–75 m. The OMs are grouped in triplets in order to reduce the
effect of optical background produced by Potassium-40 decays and biolumi-
nescence. A line comprises 25 triplets separated by a vertical distance of 14.5
m. The position [27, 28] and time [29] information of the photons detected
by the OMs are used to determine the muon direction. The reconstruction
algorithm is based on the minimisation of a χ2−like quality parameter of
the track reconstruction, Q, which uses the difference between the expected
and measured times of the detected photons, taking into account the effect
of light absorption and scattering in the water [30]. Fig. 3 of Ref. [4] shows
the distribution of reconstruted events as a function of Q.

The installation of the detector was completed in 2008, although during
2007 five lines were already installed and data taking begun. In this analysis
data recorded between the 27th of January 2007 and the 31st of October 2012
are used, corresponding to a total livetime of 1321 days, without taking into
account the visibility of the Sun. During this time, the detector consisted
of 5 lines for most of 2007 and of successively 10 and 12 lines from 2008 to
2012.

3 Signal and background estimation

Dimuon and neutrino-induced candidates are events reconstructed as upgo-
ing. The duty cycle of this search for events from the Sun corresponds to
50% of the detector livetime. Two main sources of background are present
in the ANTARES data: 1) Downgoing atmospheric muons resulting from
the interaction of cosmic rays in the atmosphere. These background events
are strongly reduced by the deep sea location and by the reconstruction al-
gorithms that are optimised for upgoing events. Cuts on the quality of the
tracks are also applied to reject downgoing muons mis-reconstructed as up-

5



going. 2) Atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic rays. These neutrinos
can traverse the Earth, so they can be detected as upgoing tracks and can-
not be rejected on an event-by-event basis. Both kinds of background have
been simulated and good agreement with data has been found [4]. Never-
theless, the background estimation is performed using scrambled data, by
randomising the time of selected events, to reduce the effect of systematic
uncertainties (efficiency of the detector, assumed atmospheric fluxes, etc.).

To evaluate the sensitivity of ANTARES to the signal from SDM models
for the case a) in which dimuons are detected directly, a new tool for dimuon
signal generation (DiMugen) has been developed [31]. DiMugen generates
and propagates dimuons produced by the decay of mediators resulting from
DM annihilation. For this analysis, the mediator arrives from the Sun’s
position during the period under study. Different DM masses in the range
between 30 GeV to 10 TeV have been simulated, using in most cases a
typical mass of 1 GeV for the mediator φ. Once the muons are generated
in the vicinity of the detector, simulations of the travel and interactions of
muons are performed, as well as the detection of the Cherenkov light by the
optical modules. Triggering and reconstruction algorithms are also included
in the process in order to evaluate the global efficiency for the detection of
dimuons as a function of the quality parameter, Q, and the half-cone angle
from the Sun direction, Ψ.

To evaluate the ANTARES sensitivity for the cases where the neutrino is
the final decay product that arrives at Earth, the ANTARES effective areas
for neutrinos as a function of the Q and Ψ according to neutrino simulations
have been used. For this, it is necessary to know the energy spectra of
neutrinos arriving at the detector. In case b) the neutrino spectra have been
obtained from Michel’s spectra of neutrinos from muon decay and taking into
account the boost [31]. For scenario c) and assuming long mediator lifetimes
with respect to the time required to exit from the Sun’s core, the neutrino
spectra are almost flat in the energy range under study [25]. For these cases
the assumption that after oscillations all neutrino flavours arrive at Earth
with the same proportion has been made. For case b), this results in a
factor of 2/3 for the muon neutrinos with respect to the parent muons, since
a muon neutrino and an electron neutrino result from a muon decay, and
these neutrinos are spread to all flavours. There is not any change in the
neutrino flavour composition of case c) due to oscillations since it is assumed
that all kinds of neutrinos result from the mediator decays.

4 Optimisation of the event selection criteria

In order to avoid any bias in the event selection, a blinding policy has been
followed using as observables the angular separation of the track with respect
to the Sun’s direction and the track quality parameter Q. The values of
the cuts have been chosen before looking at the region where the signal is
expected. The best sensitivities for dimuon (or neutrino) fluxes and cross
sections are extracted using the Model Rejection Factor (MRF) method
[32]. It consists of finding the set of cuts which provide, on average, the
best flux upper limit taking into account the observed background and the
efficiency for a possible signal flux. The procedure to obtain the sensitivity
for a neutrino flux coming from DM annihilations in the Sun is described in
Ref. [4]. The detection of a couple of muons arising from the decay of the
mediators is performed using the same reconstruction technique described
in Ref. [4] and used for single muons. A couple of parallel muons with
relative separation smaller than the distance of strings in the detector yields
a number of Cherenkov photons practically indistinguishable from that of a
single muon. For this reason, the case a) is treated in the same way as cases
b) and c).

Then, the MRF is used to determine the best value for the cut on the half-
cone angle around the Sun (Ψcut) and the track quality cut parameters (Qcut)
for the different cases (a, b, c) and the different DM masses studied. Since in
most cases the difference in flux sensitivities between different optimisations
is not large, it was decided to limit the optimisations to four different sets of
cuts, see Table 1, that were representative of all possible situations, within
a few percent sensitivity difference from the optimal one [31]. There are
three optimisation sets corresponding roughly to lower, intermediate and
larger DM masses for the dimuon detection case. For the neutrino detection
cases, the latter set is also used for larger DM masses and another additional
optimisation is used for lower and intermediate DM masses. Sensitivities to
the particle flux at Earth,Φ, obtained for the different cases studied are
shown in Figure 1.

5 Results and discussion

After the optimisation of the flux sensitivities using the MRF with scram-
bled data, the data coming from the Sun direction was unblinded. As an
example, Figure 2 shows the distribution of events detected for Q < 1.8
as a function of the angular distance from the Sun. Good agreement be-

tween data and the expected background obtained from scrambled data is
observed. The green line indicates the angular cut selected for this analysis.
Table 1 summarises the number of events observed and expected from back-
ground for the different sets of cuts. Since no significant excess is observed,
the 90% Confidence Level (CL) upper limit values in the Feldman-Cousins
approach [33] are used to constrain the model.

Taking into account the upper limits obtained in Table 1 and the cor-
responding effective areas, the upper limits on the dimuon and neutrino
fluxes at Earth, Φ, are derived, which almost coincide with the sensitivities
shown in Figure 1. Following the arguments given in Ref. [23], the dimuon
(or neutrino) flux at Earth can be translated into DM annihilation rate in
the Sun for scenarios a) and b). Assuming a 100% branching ratio for the
φ → µ+ + µ− decay channel of the mediator, and taking into account the
solid angle factor and the decay probabilities, the following relationships be-
tween the annihilation rate, Γ, and the dimuon and muonic neutrino fluxes,
respectively Φµµ and Φν [31], are obtained:

where d is a characteristic distance related to the detector size, D is the

and L is the mediator’s decay length, L = γcτ , i.e. the product of the
mediator’s lifetime, τ , the speed of light, c, and the relativistic boost factor
γ = mDM/mφ.

For the case in which mediators decay directly into neutrinos, only the
situation in which the mediator lifetime is long enough has been considered,
so that the absorption of neutrinos in the Sun becomes negligible. If the
lifetime of the mediator is small, the final energy spectrum of neutrinos
would be quite similar to the case of typical DM searches [25]. For long-
lived mediators, (L > 105 km), in this scenario, the relationship between Γ
and Φν is [31]:

Constraints on the annihilation rates as a function of mediator lifetime
and dark matter mass have been obtained. For example, Figure 3 shows
the ANTARES exclusion limits for the SDM scenarios for DM masses of
0.5 (left) and 5 (right) TeV using the typical φ mass of 1 GeV. Blue lines
indicate the exclusion region in the di-muon case, either by direct detection

(dotted-dashed line) or through detection of neutrinos (solid line). For large
decay lengths L (L > D), i.e. long mediator lifetime, the direct detection
of dimuons is more efficient than neutrino detection for small DM masses,
whereas the opposite holds for larger masses. The transition is around 0.8
TeV in DM mass. Naturally, for small L (L� D) neutrino detection is much
more efficient. Green lines indicate the exclusion regions of the parameter
space for the scenario of SDM with mediator decaying into neutrinos. More
stringent constraints are obtained in this scenario mainly due to the harder
neutrino energy spectrum.

Limits on the DM-nucleon interaction can also be derived for these cases.
Assuming that, as expected, there is equilibrium of the DM population in
the Sun, i.e., the annihilation balances the DM capture, Γ = CDM/2 , and
that according to [34] the capture is approximately

where, σSD and σSI are the spin-dependent (SD) and spin-independent (SI)
cross sections, respectively, and Mχ is the DM mass. The limits on the SD
and SI WIMP-proton scattering cross-sections are derived for the case in
which one of them is dominant. The sensitivity in terms of annihilation
rates depends on the lifetime of the mediator φ. To assess the potential to
constrain these models, lifetime values for which the sensitivities are optimal
have been assumed. For the dimuon case, the lifetime has to be long enough
to assure that the mediator reaches the vicinity of the Earth, so mediators
with a decay length of about the Sun-Earth distance are shown. In both
neutrino cases the lifetime of the mediator for best sensitivity has to be long
enough to ensure that the mediator escapes the Sun, but not so long that it
decays before reaching the Earth. Figure 4 shows the ANTARES nucleon–
WIMP cross section limits for the SDM scenario with the products of DM
annihilation in the Sun through mediators decaying into: di-muons (blue)
and directly into neutrinos (green) for the selected mediator’s lifetimes. For
sufficiently long-lived, but unstable mediators, the limits imposed to these
models are much more restrictive than those derived in direct detection
searches for the case of spin-dependent interaction. In the case of spin-
independent interactions, the direct detection search is more competitive for
low and intermediate masses, but the SDM search becomes more competitive
for larger masses (> 1 TeV).

The limits derived here are the first experimental limits on SDM models
established by a neutrino telescope. Compared to other indirect detection

Figure 4: ANTARES 90% CL upper limits on WIMP-nucleon cross section
as a function of WIMP mass. The left panel refers to spin-dependent and the
right one to spin-independent WIMP interactions. Two favourable mediator
lifetimes are considered. The current bounds from PICO [35, 36, 37], LUX
[38] and XENON [39, 40] are also shown.

methods, such as those using gamma-rays, the limits derived here are in
general competitive for large DM masses and favourable mediator lifetimes
(L ≈ 1011 m). However, the comparison is not straightforward, since the
results are usually given in terms of the < σv > parameter, and several
astrophysical assumptions have to be made. Therefore, the different indirect
searches can be considered complementary.

6 Conclusions

An analysis of 2007-2012 ANTARES data for the search of Secluded Dark
Matter annihilation from the Sun has been presented. Lately, this kind of
models has increased in popularity, since SDM could help to interpret the
energy spectrum of the positron/electron ratio measured recently by Pamela,
Fermi-LAT and AMS-II. Assuming that DM can be annihilated through
a mediator that has a long lifetime, three different situations have been
considered: a) detection of dimuons that result from the mediator decay,
or neutrino detection from: b) mediator that decays into a dimuon and, in
turn, into neutrinos, and c) a mediator that decays directly into neutrinos.
No significant excess over background has been observed for these searches,
and limits to these models have been derived. This is the first time that
these models are constrained with dedicated searches in neutrino telescopes.
The limits are the most restrictive available for a wide range of DM masses,
and mediator lifetimes, and in particular for the case of spin-dependent
DM-proton interaction.
