ABSTRACT

Aims. We search for muon neutrinos in coincidence with GRBs with the ANTARES neutrino detector using data from the end of 2007 to 2011.
Methods. Expected neutrino fluxes were calculated for each burst individually. The most recent numerical calculations of the spectra using the
NeuCosmA code were employed, which include Monte Carlo simulations of the full underlying photohadronic interaction processes. The discovery
probability for a selection of 296 GRBs in the given period was optimised using an extended maximum-likelihood strategy.
Results. No significant excess over background is found in the data, and 90% confidence level upper limits are placed on the total expected flux
according to the model.

1. Introduction

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short and very intense flashes
of high-energy gamma rays, which occur unpredictably and
isotropically over the sky (Meegan et al. 1992). Over timescales

of the order of a few seconds, they release as much energy as
the Sun in its entire lifetime (see Woosley & Bloom 2006, for a
review). The doubly peaked distribution of burst durations mea-
sured by the BATSE satellite led Kouveliotou et al. (1993) to the
classification of GRBs into two types (see also Paciesas et al.
1999). The sub-class of long bursts (with durations >∼2 s) has
been shown to be associated with supernovae of type I b/c (see
e.g. Galama et al. 1998). For the short bursts (<∼2 s duration) it is
much harder to measure the fast-fading afterglow emission and
thereby obtain information about their origin. However, they are
now widely accepted to originate from the merging of two com-
pact objects, for example neutron stars and black holes (Eichler
et al. 1989; Nakar 2007).

In the fireball model (as proposed by Mészáros & Rees
1993), the observed electromagnetic radiation is explained by
highly relativistic outflows of material, most likely collimated

in jets pointed towards the Earth. Shock fronts emerge in these
outflows in which electrons are accelerated (Rees & Mészáros
1992). The synchrotron emission of these relativistic electrons
and subsequent inverse Compton-scattering of the emitted pho-
ton field causes the observed gamma-ray radiation (Mészáros
2006). Within the framework of the fireball model, protons can
also be shock-accelerated, which yields emission of high-energy
neutrinos accompanying the electromagnetic signal of the burst
(Waxman 1995a, 2000; Waxman & Bahcall 1997). The detec-
tion of neutrinos from GRBs would be unambiguous proof for
hadronic acceleration in cosmic sources, and could also serve to
explain the origin of the cosmic-ray flux at ultra-high energies
(Waxman 1995b).

Several limits over a wide range of energies have been
placed on the neutrino emission from GRBs, for instance from
experiments such as Super-Kamiokande (Fukuda et al. 2002),
AMANDA (Achterberg et al. 2008), Baikal (Avrorin et al. 2011),
RICE (Besson et al. 2007), and ANITA (Vieregg et al. 2011).
Very-large-volume neutrino telescopes such as ANTARES and
IceCube are sensitive to neutrino fluxes above approximately
100 GeV; since they simultaneously observe at least half the
sky, they are ideal instruments to search for any high-energy
neutrino flux from GRBs. The data from ANTARES in its con-
struction phase in 2007 with the first five detection lines de-
ployed (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2013) and from IceCube in its
IC 22, IC 40, and IC 59 detector phases from 2007 to 2010
(Abbasi et al. 2010, 2011, 2012) have previously been analysed
in searches for this emission, with corresponding limits set in the
TeV to PeV energy range. Due to its location at the South Pole,
the IceCube detector has sensitivity for Northern Hemisphere
sources, whereas the ANTARES detector, being situated at a lat-
itude of 43◦, has sensitivity for Southern Hemisphere sources.

In this paper we present a search for prompt GRB neutrino
emission in the period from the end of 2007 to 2011 with the
ANTARES telescope using 296 bursts, out of which 90% have
not been included in the previously mentioned references. In
contrast to previous analyses, this search has for the first time
been optimised for a fully numerical neutrino-emission model,
based on Hümmer et al. (2010, 2012).

This paper is organised as follows: in Sect. 2, the ANTARES
neutrino telescope is briefly introduced. A description of how
the burst parameters are obtained and how the final sample is
selected is given in Sect. 3. Models for the expected neutrino
spectra within the fireball paradigm are described in Sect. 4,
including the numerical model NeuCosmA, which is used for
the optimisation of the analysis. In Sect. 5, we describe Monte
Carlo simulations of GRB neutrino events that yield the detec-
tor response to the signal. The background distribution is esti-
mated from data, as reported in Sect. 6. From these distribu-
tions, pseudo-experiments were generated that, by exploiting an
extended maximum-likelihood ratio method, were used to opti-
mise the search to obtain the highest discovery potential for the
neutrino flux – this is presented in Sect. 7. In Sect. 8, we investi-
gate whether the discovery potential can be improved by limiting
the analysis to an optimised sub-sample of the bursts. Results of
the analysis and the derived limits are provided in Sect. 9.

2. ANTARES detector and data taking

The underwater neutrino telescope ANTARES (see Ageron et al.
2011) is primarily designed for detecting relativistic muons from

charged-current interactions of cosmic muon neutrinos1 with
matter in or close-by to the detector. The passage of these
muons through the seawater induces the emission of Cherenkov
light that is then detected by an array of photo-multiplier tubes
(PMTs). Using the time and position information of the photons,
the muon trajectory is reconstructed. The original neutrino direc-
tion is then inferred from the measured muon direction – at the
energies considered here, the uncertainty introduced by the scat-
tering angle is negligible compared to the detector’s resolution.

The ANTARES telescope is located in the Mediterranean
Sea at a depth of 2.4 km. The detector consists of twelve ver-
tical “strings” anchored to the seabed, each of which is held up-
right by a buoy at the top. They are separated from each other
by a typical distance of 70 m. The twelve strings, each with a
length of 450 m, are equipped with 25 triplets of PMTs, build-
ing a three-dimensional array of 885 PMTs in total2. The triplets
have a vertical spacing of 14.5 m between them, whereas the
first triplet is placed at a height of 100 m above the seabed.

Bioluminescence and radioactive decay of 40K produce
a random optical background that can vary between 50 and
300 kHz per PMT, depending for example on the time of the
year or the sea current. A multi-level online triggering proce-
dure is applied to select possible particle signatures – see Aguilar
et al. (2007) for a more detailed description.

In addition to the cosmic neutrino signal that the ANTARES
experiment is searching for, there are other processes that can
produce muon tracks in the detector that are considered as back-
ground events. Air showers are generated when high-energy
cosmic rays hit the Earth’s atmosphere. Among other particles,
muons and neutrinos are produced in these showers. Since only
the (weakly interacting) neutrinos are capable of traversing the
Earth, it can effectively be used as a “shield” against all particles
but neutrinos. By searching only for upgoing particles therefore,
the atmospheric downgoing muon background can be rejected.
Nevertheless, muons from above can also produce signals in the
detector that appear as upgoing events. Using quality cuts on
the reconstruction parameters, these falsely reconstructed atmo-
spheric muon tracks can be suppressed to a rate of 0.4 events per
day.

Atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic rays below the
horizon can also traverse the Earth, and represent the main back-
ground component (∼three events per day after quality cuts, see
Adrián-Martínez et al. 2012) to the cosmic neutrinos.

In the analysis presented in the following, the requirement
of temporal and spatial coincidence with a recorded GRB re-
duces the number of expected background events to ∼O(10−4)
per GRB (see Sect. 6), and an extended likelihood method is
furthermore used to distinguish between signal and background
events. Data collected between December 6, 2007 and the end
of 2011 were analysed. The first six months of this period com-
prised the last phase of construction of the apparatus, after the
deployment of detection lines 6 to 10, with the last two lines
installed in May 2008. In that period, the instrumented volume
of the detector increased from 0.008 to 0.011 km3 at full size.
The corresponding average effective area to muon neutrinos as
a function of the energy is shown in Fig. 1 for different decli-
nation bands. The huge increase of effective area with energy, a
common feature of neutrino telescopes, is due not only to the
increase of the neutrino cross-section, but also to that of the
muon range, which can reach several kilometres at the highest

energies. The total integrated livetime of the data in coincidence
with the selected 296 GRB search-time windows is 6.6 h.

3. GRB selection and parameters

The GRB parameters needed for the search and the simulation
of expected neutrino fluxes are primarily obtained from differ-
ent tables provided by the Swift (Gehrels et al. 2004) and Fermi
(Atwood et al. 2009; Meegan et al. 2009) collaborations. This
information is then supplemented using a table supplied by the
IceCube Collaboration (Aguilar 2011), which is created by pars-
ing the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN) notices3. In
Appendix A, we specify how these tables are merged, how of-
ten burst parameters are taken from each of them, and how the
search-time windows are defined.

For the final sample, GRBs are required to meet certain cri-
teria as specified in Table 1 – short bursts, for instance, are ex-
cluded as this class is much less understood. A total of 296 bursts
pass these selection cuts, of which 10% are also included in
the most recent gamma-ray-burst search from IceCube (Abbasi
et al. 2012). The distribution of the selected bursts in equa-
torial coordinates is shown in Fig. 2. Out of this selection,
GRB 110918 outshines all others by at least half an order of
magnitude in the expected neutrino flux (see Sect. 4). It is at
the same time one of the most intense bursts ever observed by
the Konus-Wind instrument (Aptekar et al. 1995; Golenetskii
et al. 2011). Unfortunately, both Swift and Fermi satellites were
Earth-occulted at the time of the burst (Krimm et al. 2011), but
Swift could still observe the afterglow emission after ∼30 h.
The measured parameters for this exceptional burst are given in
Table A.2.

stantaneous field of view of the ANTARES detector is 2π sr; within a
period of 24 h, the sky up to a declination of 47◦ is visible.

4. Calculation of neutrino spectra

To calculate the expected neutrino spectra, we focused on the
recently developed fully numerical NeuCosmA model (Hümmer
et al. 2010, 2012). In addition, we also present the widely used
analytical approach of Guetta et al. (2004) in the following.

4.1. Analytic approaches

Waxman & Bahcall (1997) were the first to calculate the ex-
pected neutrino flux in coincidence with the electromagnetic
GRB in the framework of the standard fireball internal shock
model, using averaged burst parameters as measured by the
BATSE instrument on board the CGRO satellite (Band et al.
1993). Their calculation was based on the assumption of Fermi-
accelerated protons in the relativistic ejecta of the burst inter-
acting with the associated photon field to produce pions via the
∆-resonance. The subsequent decay of charged pions and muons
leads to the emission of high-energy neutrinos. The authors de-
rived a doubly broken power-law spectrum for the neutrinos.
Their model is referred to as the standard Waxman-Bahcall GRB
neutrino flux, and is for instance used to set limits with the
BAIKAL (Avrorin et al. 2011) and AMANDA (Achterberg et al.
2008) experiments. Guetta et al. (2004) modified the formulae of
Waxman and Bahcall to calculate individual neutrino fluxes for
the bursts. Such individual burst predictions are used in recent
searches with IceCube (Abbasi et al. 2010, 2011, 2012), RICE
(Besson et al. 2007), and ANITA (Vieregg et al. 2011). Note in
particular that the most recent IceCube limit was a factor of 3.7
below predictions made using this model. This could either in-
dicate the need for rejection of the model, a modification of the
parameters upon which it is based, or for more detailed mod-
elling of the neutrino emission within the fireball paradigm.

To calculate the analytic spectrum as shown in Fig. 3a,
blue solid line, the formulae given in Abbasi et al. (2010,
Appendix A) were applied.

In principle, Guetta et al. (2004) predicted different break
energies for νµ and ν̄µ (see Guetta et al. 2004, Eqs. (A.10)
and (A.11)), yielding three breaks in the combined νµ + ν̄µ spec-
trum (or in the single νµ spectrum when taking oscillations into
account) as shown in Fig. 3a, blue dashed – in the previous
ANTARES analysis (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2013), this effect
has been accounted for.

4.2. NeuCosmA model

Monte Carlo algorithms such as SOPHIA (see Mücke et al.
2000) have improved the calculations of photohadronic interac-
tions in astrophysical processes. Hümmer et al. (2012) showed
that a more detailed treatment of the particle physics involved
in calculating the neutrino spectra greatly changes the result-
ing neutrino flux predictions compared with those described
in Sect. 4.1. Using their neutrinos from cosmic accelerators
(NeuCosmA) code, the authors pointed out how the full photo-
hadronic interaction cross-section, individual treatment of sec-
ondary particles (including energy losses), and neutrino mixing
affect the predicted neutrino flux (Hümmer et al. 2010, 2012;
Baerwald et al. 2012). Owing to these effects, the doubly peaked
structure of the spectrum from muon and pion decays now fea-
tures an additional high-energy component from K+ decays.
Moreover, the authors discussed several problems with the older
neutrino flux estimations, such as using the real average pho-
ton energy instead of the peak energy of the photon distribution,
taking the full width of the ∆-resonance into account, and sim-
ulating the energy losses of secondary particles as well as the
energy dependence of the mean free path of protons (see also
He et al. 2012). The combination of all these effects gives rise
to a prediction for the neutrino yield that is about one order of
magnitude below the result of Guetta et al. (2004).

Note that the NeuCosmA model, however, does not intro-
duce any new assumptions on the nature of GRBs in general, but
applies known physics in greater detail within the paradigm of
the fireball model. Hence, limits on these predictions will first
of all constrain parameters governing the fireball model (such as

the boost factor Γ of the jet), and might later on probe the fireball
paradigm itself.

Predictions made by the NeuCosmA model are used to op-
timise this analysis. In Fig. 3a, a comparison between the pre-
dicted neutrino spectra from Guetta et al. (2004) and from
NeuCosmA is shown exemplarily for GRB 110918. Figure 3b
shows all individual numerical neutrino spectra and their sum.

5. Simulation and signal probability density
function

For each GRB in the selection, neutrino events were generated
with high statistics to simulate the predicted NeuCosmA spec-
trum. They were then reconstructed to compute the acceptance
of the detector. Their distribution gives the signal probability
density function (PDF) labelled S(α) = dN(α)/dΩ, with α being
the space angle between the reconstructed track direction and the
gamma-ray-burst’s coordinates.

Firstly, the passage of neutrinos from the direction of a GRB
through the Earth was simulated. If they interacted with mat-
ter sufficiently close to or in the detector, the resulting hadronic
shower from the break-up of the target nucleon was gener-
ated. The secondary particles were then propagated through the
medium, inducing the emission of Cherenkov photons on their
trajectory. The response of the PMTs to the emitted Cherenkov
light was then simulated, taking into account the detector and
environmental conditions at the time of the GRB occurrence.
For a more detailed description of the simulation scheme, see
Adrián-Martínez et al. (2012).

For each GRB, 4 × 109 muon neutrinos were simulated. No
background events were generated, as the background rate was
estimated using the data themselves (see Sect. 6).

The applied track reconstruction algorithm is the same as
used in Adrián-Martínez et al. (2012). It is based on a multi-
step algorithm to maximise the likelihood of an assumed track
hypothesis. The reconstruction returns two quality parameters,
namely the track-fit quality parameter Λ and the estimated an-
gular uncertainty on the muon track direction β. Cuts on these
parameters can be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. To
ensure a good directional reconstruction of the selected neutrino
candidates, we required β < 1◦. For a sample of track candidates
with high reconstruction quality (Λ > −5.2), this cut has been
shown to remove most of the remaining atmospheric muons that
were falsely reconstructed as upgoing without significantly af-
fecting the neutrino signal: atmospheric muons are reduced by
a factor of 1.2 × 10−5, while atmospheric neutrinos are reduced
by 0.19. The total background due to atmospheric events is de-
creased by 10−6 (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2012). In this analysis,
the same cut combination would leave ∼60 . . . 70% of a typical
GRB signal. However, the narrow time windows (typically a few
tens of seconds, see Table 2 for per-GRB values) yield intrinsi-
cally low background in coincidence with each GRB, allowing
one to loosen the cuts on the Λ parameter. These were then opti-
mised for each burst individually.

To account for the satellite’s uncertainty on the direction
of the GRB, the reconstructed space angle was additionally
smeared with a Gaussian of the appropriate width.

The resulting distribution of events relative to the GRB di-
rection for each cut on Λ was then fitted with the function

the sum and mean of the values for all 296 GRBs at 3σ is given. The

which the burst occurred. The full table is available at the CDS.

with the free parameters A, B, α0, andσ as shown in Fig. 4. In the
final analysis, events with an angular distance of up to 10◦ from
the burst positions were included in the maximum-likelihood
search.

An investigation of shower-like events (e.g. from neutral cur-
rent interactions of νµ) revealed that these contribute only negli-
gibly to the signal PDF up to 10◦, as the original neutrino direc-
tion cannot be adequately reconstructed because of the spherical
signatures of these interactions.

6. Background estimation

Upgoing atmospheric neutrinos constitute the main background
component for each GRB, with a smaller contribution coming
from misreconstructed downgoing atmospheric muons. To es-
timate the mean number of background events µb for each Λ
cut for each burst as realistically as possible, data were used.
However, as the number of upgoing events is very low (∼four
per day, see Adrián-Martínez et al. 2012, Table 1), long time
periods are needed to yield sufficient statistics, which in turn re-
quires averaging over different data-taking conditions (in partic-
ular because of seasonal variations of the optical background).
To compensate for this, we first estimated the average rate of re-
constructed events in the GRB’s direction 〈n(θ, φ)GRB〉all runs in
local coordinates zenith θ and azimuth φ using data from the en-
tire 2007 to 2011 period, then adjusted it for varying data-taking
conditions (for a detailed description, see Appendix B).

For the final search, the number of background events in co-
incidence with each burst and within a search cone of 10◦ around
its position was evaluated to be of the order of 10−4. The back-
ground PDF, B(α), was considered to be flat in Ω within this
cone, as shown in Fig. 4 for GRB 110918.

7. Pseudo-experiments and extended
maximum-likelihood ratio

In the following, we show how pseudo-experiments were gener-
ated to compute the significance of a measurement, then how the
cut on the reconstruction quality parameter Λ was optimised for
each GRB to yield the highest discovery probability for a signal
according to the NeuCosmA model.

For the pseudo-experiments, signal and background events i
with space angle αi were drawn randomly from the normalised
signal S(α) and background B(α) PDFs corresponding to each
chosen cut on Λ. For each pseudo-experiment with a total num-
ber of events ntot, the test statistic Q was calculated as follows:

Q = max
µ′s∈[0,ntot]

 ntot∑
i = 1

log
µ′sS(αi) + µbB(αi)

µbB(αi)
− (µ′s + µb)

 . (2)
This is the so-called extended maximum-likelihood ratio
(Barlow 1990) with an a priori knowledge of the expected
number of background events µb (as evaluated in Sect. 6 and
Appendix B). Higher values of Q indicate that the measurement
is more compatible with the signal hypothesis. The signal con-
tribution µ′s is scanned between 0 and ntot, its value correspond-
ing to the maximum of the sum in Eq. (2) returns the estimated
signal µests .

In the following, hns (Q) denotes the distribution of Q-values
for ns injected signal events with a Poisson-distributed number
of background events with expectation value µb. The signifi-
cance of a measurement is determined by its p-value4, which
is given by the probability to yield Q-values at least as high
as that observed if the background-only hypothesis were true.
Hence, using the background-only distribution h0(Q), the low-
est Q-value Qthresp that is necessary to claim a discovery with a
certain p-value can be calculated with

P(Q ≥ Qthresp | µb) =
∫
∞

Qthresp
h0(Q) dQ = p. (3)

The probability distributions hns (Q) for different ns are shown in
Fig. 5, with the threshold Q-values indicated by the grey dashed

5.7 × 10−7.

with the Poisson distribution P(ns| µs) giving the probabil-
ity of observing ns events from a mean number of expected
events µs. The integral of P(Q| µs) gives the model discovery po-
tentialMDP; it is the probability to make a discovery assuming
that the model was correct:

MDP = P(Q ≥ Qthresp | µs) =

The value of the Λ cut at a given significance level is then cho-
sen as that which maximises theMDP for the value of µs pre-
dicted by the NeuCosmA model (see Sect. 4.2). Figure 6 shows
MDP(µs) of GRB 110918 for 3σ, 4σ, and 5σ versus an arbi-
trary number of signal events. The distribution P(Q| µs) from
Eq. (4) was also used to set upper limits on the number of signal
events when no discovery is made. For example, when the fi-
nal analysis returns Qmeas, we set a 90% confidence level (C.L.)
upper limit µ90%s on the signal by rejecting all event expecta-
tions µs that would lead to values Q > Qmeas in 90% of all
pseudo-experiments:

P(Q ≥ Qmeas| µ
90%
s ) =

∫
∞

Qmeas
P(Q| µ90%s ) dQ = 0.9. (6)

When no event was measured (Qmeas = 0), a 90% C.L. upper
limit was set at 2.3, the lowest possible value5.

For each number of injected signal events ns, 105 pseudo-
experiments were generated6 to derive the signal distributions
hns (Q). Using this procedure, the model discovery potential was
calculated for any given µs, and the final cut on Λ for each GRB
was found.
5 The value derives from Poisson statistics, since the probability to
detect at least one event at a mean rate of 2.3 is exactly 90%.
6 Far more background-only pseudo-experiments are required to allow
determining Qthresp at p-values as low as p5σ/296 ∼ 2 × 10

8. Search optimisation

In the following, the best trade-off between an increased sample
and the associated statistical penalty is investigated. In general,
a weighting factor, wi, could be assigned to each GRB accord-
ing to the predicted flux from the model. However, this would
result in the search being very sensitive to the combined uncer-
tainty from the NeuCosmA model and especially to the parame-
ters upon which it is based. An alternative approach is to include
only the NGRB most promising candidates, where to maintain the
same overall probability of making a false discovery, the p-value
for each burst must be divided by the total trial factor NGRB.
By ordering the bursts from highest to lowestMDPi, the most
promising NGRB can be chosen to maximise the combined prob-
ability of making a significant discovery from any of them. The
total model discovery potential is then calculated via

MDP(NGRB) = 1 −
NGRB∏
i = 1

(1 −MDPi). (7)

The resulting distributions ofMDP(NGRB) as a function of the
size of the considered sub-sample of GRBs are shown in Fig. 7
for 3σ, 4σ and 5σ (thick lines). The 3σMDP distribution rises
to a maximum of 0.059 at a sample size of 106 GRBs, but is rel-
atively flat around its highest value. For a search optimised for
3σ it is therefore reasonable to take the whole set of GRBs, as it
does not decrease theMDP significantly (around 3.4%) and the
search remains less model-dependent. The 5σ MDP distribu-
tion, on the other hand, is prominently peaked at NGRB = 1, with
NGRB = 2 being almost equivalent (MDP(1) = MDP(2) =
0.025) – the model discovery potential then decreases for larger
samples. Even for NGRB = 2, the second strongest GRB con-
tributes only a small fraction to the discovery potential.

For comparison, the distributions for a simple counting
search (in which all events passing the cut criteria carry equal
weighting) are also shown in Fig. 7 (thin lines). To mimic this
search, a radius cut αcut for each GRB was calculated from the
known background µb at fixed reasonable quality cuts (Λ >
−5.5, β < 1◦) and the given significance level p/NGRB. Applying
this search radius cut on the signal PDF S(α), the expected num-
ber of signal events µs can be estimated and consequently the
MDPi evaluated as the probability of detecting more than zero
events.

As expected, the MDP curves for a counting analysis are
well below those for the likelihood method, showing the advan-
tage of the search method used in this analysis. The shapes of the

curves, on the other hand, are quite similar, and the same con-
clusions can be drawn from them, namely that using the whole
sample gives the best discovery probability at 3σ and using only
the individual GRB 110918 at 5σ.

Based on these results, we decided to optimise the quality cut
on Λ for a likelihood search on the whole sample of 296 GRBs
at the 3σ significance level. Because 3σ is not enough to claim
a discovery, we predefined a cut on Λ that was optimised for a
5σ discovery, which was then used for a separate search for the
emission from GRB 110918 only.

Optimised cuts Λcut for the final analysis as well as the ac-
cordingly expected number of background and signal events,
the median angular resolution, and the search-time window are
shown in Table 2 for the ten most promising GRBs. A full list
for the 296 selected bursts can be found at the CDS.

9. Results and discussion

Using the strategy outlined above, we analysed ANTARES data
from the end of 2007 to 2011 searching for neutrino events in co-
incidence with the search-time windows and within 10◦ around
each GRB. No data events passed this selection within the accu-
mulated search duration of 6.6 h. Hence, the measured Q-value
is zero.

In total, 0.06 neutrino events from GRBs are expected from
the NeuCosmA model, where only a small contribution of 4.6 ×
10−5 events is not due to particle tracks produced by muon neu-
trinos – the Guetta model predicts 0.5 signals from muon neu-
trinos. The overall background in the 10◦ cones is 0.05 events.
The 90% C.L. upper limits on the expected number of sig-
nal events µs from each model are thus set to 2.3 events, and
the corresponding limits on the muon neutrino flux, Fν, from
GRB 110918 as well as on the cumulative flux from the whole
sample are shown in Fig. 8. The simple treatment of the Guetta
model is represented here (see Fig. 3 a, solid line). For the
NeuCosmA model, the limit on the total flux lies a factor of 38
above the expected spectrum (4.4 for Guetta). The right-hand
axis of Fig. 8b represents the limits translated into limits on the
inferred quasi-diffuse neutrino flux:

where ν = νµ + ν̄µ, assuming that each analysed sample rep-
resents an average burst distribution and that the annual rate of
long bursts is 667 per year.

The first ANTARES limit (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2013) ob-
tained for 40 GRBs during the construction phase of the detec-
tor in the year 2007 is also shown in Fig. 8b. That analysis was
based on the Guetta model (accounting for different break ener-
gies of νµ and ν̄µ) and employed a counting method searching for
neutrino events in a two-degree cone around each burst. Using
the data from the IC 40 and IC 59 detector phases in 2008 to
2010, IceCube recently published a more stringent limit on the
neutrino emission as predicted by the “simple” Guetta model
(Abbasi et al. 2012), which is also shown in Fig. 8b.

Because of the larger effective area of the IceCube detec-
tor, the new ANTARES limit presented in this paper does not
set additional constraints on the Guetta emission model. Note,
however, that both detectors have complementary sky coverage
and therefore the analysed sample of GRBs differs significantly.
90% of the analysed bursts have not previously had their neu-
trino emission constrained. When comparing limits obtained in
different analyses, however, one should keep in mind that the
precise shapes of the spectra – and thus, of the limits – depend
on the actual selected sample, the measured parameters of the
individual bursts and their uncertainty, the set of default param-
eters and on the chosen model.

10. Conclusion

Using data from the ANTARES detector, a search for muon neu-
trinos in coincidence with 296 GRBs occurring between the end
of 2007 and 2011 has been performed. No events passed the se-
lection criteria and limits on the neutrino flux were derived. For
the NeuCosmA model, a limit on E2Fν of 0.35−5.6 GeV cm−2
in the energy range from 7.5 × 104 GeV to 1.0 × 107 GeV was
derived and compared with limits obtained in previous analyses.

This work is the first analysis based on an advanced numeri-
cal calculation of GRB neutrinos: the NeuCosmA code includes
full photohadronic interaction cross-sections, energy losses of
secondary particles, and flavour mixing. The neutrino flux has
been shown to be an order of magnitude below that predicted by
previous analytic approaches. This helps to resolve the tension
between the non-observation of a neutrino signal and the most
stringent experimental constraint currently available (Abbasi
et al. 2012), which was a factor of 3.7 below the predictions
made by the Guetta model.

Hence, existing limits do not yet constrain realistic neu-
trino emission models based on an internal shock scenario.
Nevertheless, the collection of more data with active experi-
ments such as ANTARES and IceCube, as well as with the
planned neutrino telescope KM3NeT, will certainly allow the
widely established fireball paradigm for GRBs to be probed in
the near future.

Appendix A: GRB selection

The table of the Swift satellite7 contains data from the three on-
board instruments BAT (gamma rays), XRT (X-rays), and UVOT
(ultraviolet), ordered with increasing position-measurement ac-
curacy from arcminutes to sub-arcseconds. The information pro-
vides BAT spectral measurements in the energy range from 15
to 150 keV. The Swift BAT2 Catalogue (Sakamoto et al. 2011)8
provides re-analysed Swift data, so the spectral information
therein is considered to be more accurate. The Fermi GBM Burst
Catalogue9 (Goldstein et al. 2012; Paciesas et al. 2012) supplies
the best spectral information in the energy range from 10 keV
to 1 MeV: the peak flux spectrum and the spectrum averaged
over the burst duration (which is eventually used for the neu-
trino spectrum calculation) is fitted with four different spectral
functions. The angular resolution is of the order of degrees. The
IceCube Collaboration also provides a table with GRB parame-
ters10 (Aguilar 2011), which is created by parsing the Gamma-
ray Coordinates Network (GCN) notices11. This table is used to
fill up missing parameter values for GRBs that have been found
in at least one of the other tables.

When merging the information on the GRB parameters, we
assigned priorities to the measured values according to their
considered accuracy. The priorities of parameters are shown in
Table A.1 in square brackets, as well as the percentage of how
often information was obtained from each source.

When a parameter could not be measured, standard values as
given in Table A.2 were used to calculate the spectra. The form
of the photon spectrum is determined by the spectral indices α
and β with the break energy �peak giving their transition. The
isotropic luminosity Liso can be calculated from the redshift z and
the total measured fluence in gamma rays F (given in the energy
range from Emin to Emax) via Liso = 4πd2L

with the luminos-

ity distance dL. In case of unknown redshift z, we took the de-
fault value of Liso. T90 is the time in which 90% of the fluence is

emitted. The other parameters such as the jet Lorentz boost fac-
tor Γ, the fraction of jet energy in electrons �e and in the magnetic
field �B, the ratio of energy in electrons and protons fe, the av-
erage fraction of proton energy transferred to a pion 〈xp→π〉 and
the variability of the gamma-ray light curve tvar are not present in
the tables and hence were taken as default. The standard values
are the same as given in Aguilar (2011), with some differences to
the IC 22 (Abbasi et al. 2010) default values: z = 2.0, Γ = 300,
Liso = 1051 erg s−1. Baerwald et al. (2012) give a very elaborate
overview about the NeuCosmA spectra changing with the input
parameters.

The parameters of the extraordinarily strong GRB 110918
are presented in Table A.3.

The time window of the search, Tsearch, for emission from
each burst is delineated by the start and stop times as measured
by the satellites or, when these are not provided in the cata-
logues, as T90 ± 30%. Additionally, we accounted for the detec-
tor’s data acquisition uncertainty (0.4 s), the satellite time given
in integer seconds (1 s), and the light propagation from a satel-
lite through Earth to the detector (0.5 s) by adding another ±2 s
to the search-time window.

Appendix B: Background estimation

We estimated the background event rate for each GRB sepa-
rately. First, the time-averaged reconstructed event rate in the
data from late 2007 to 2011 from the direction of the GRB was
estimated. Either the rate averaged over all data-taking runs at
the GRB’s position (θ, φ)GRB was used, or – if resulting in a
higher rate – the mean of the corresponding time-averaged rates
within a 10◦ cone around this position. This establishes a con-
servative background estimate, accounting for non-uniformity of
the background in the vicinity of the GRB’s position.

To take into account the varying efficiency of the detector
with time, this average rate was then scaled by a correction
factor ci for each data-taking run i of ∼2.5 h. Each ci was

calculated by the ratio of the total number of events (in all
directions) in the corresponding run ni to the average to-
tal number of events for the respective run duration ti (see
Eq. (B.1)). As ni may be very small for short runs, the 90%
C.L. upper limit was used instead. Additionally, factors for
specific run periods cperiod were applied taking into account
differences between longer phases of similar run conditions.
These values were obtained by fitting the background rate
in certain periods separately. This approach assumes that the
total number of events – dominated mostly by downgoing
atmospheric muons – is proportional to the number of upgoing

events. To test this assumption, we determined the measured and
estimated rates of upgoing events in longer time periods of a few
days, excluding data-taking runs in which GRBs occurred. The
measured rate was always found to be µmeas < 1.5 µest, thus we
conservatively increased the estimate by 50%. Consequently, the
expected number of background events in coincidence with each
GRB search-time window Tsearch was calculated via
