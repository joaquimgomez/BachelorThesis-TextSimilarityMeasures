for the first phase of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. About 7000 photomultipliers have been
characterised for dark count rate, timing spread and spurious pulses. The quantum efficiency, the
gain and the peak-to-valley ratio have also been measured for a sub-sample in order to determine
parameter values needed as input to numerical simulations of the detector.

1 Introduction

KM3NeT is a large research infrastructure that will consist of a network of deep-sea neutrino
detectors in the Mediterranean Sea [1–3]. The main scientific goals are neutrino astroparticle
physics — the study of astrophysical objects by detecting their high-energy neutrino emission
— and the investigation of neutrino properties by measuring atmospheric neutrinos. The ARCA
(Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) detector of KM3NeT, optimised for high-energy
neutrino studies, will be located off-shoreCapoPassero (Italy) at 3500mbelow sea level. TheORCA
(Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) detector, dedicated to low energy neutrino studies,
will be located off-shore Toulon (France) at 2500m below sea level. The KM3NeT location in the
deep sea also offers interdisciplinary opportunities for continuous, real-time measurements, e.g. for
marine biology, oceanography or environmental sciences.

Both detectors comprise arrays of thousands of Digital Optical Modules (DOMs). The DOMs
are arranged along flexible strings, called Detection Units (DUs), kept vertical by a submerged buoy.
During the first stage of the KM3NeT construction 24 DUs for the ARCA and 6 DUs for the ORCA
detectors will be installed. The DOMs will detect the Cherenkov light induced in the sea water by
charged particles originated in neutrino interactions. Each DOM comprises 31 3-inch PMTs hosted
inside a 17-inch glass sphere.

The characteristics of the PMTs affect the detector event reconstruction accuracy. The re-
quirements for the KM3NeT PMTs are summarised in table 1. The Hamamatsu R12199-02 PMT
is the photodetector chosen for the first phase of the KM3NeT detector. It is a 80-mm diameter
hemispherical PMT with 10 dynode stages and standard bi-alkali photocathode.

Given the key role played by the PMT performance in the neutrino event detection and re-
construction, the KM3NeT Collaboration has decided to perform dedicated studies on critical
parameters for PMT performance and operation, including a measurement of Quantum Efficiency
(QE) and calibration of time over threshold, and to fully characterise a large sample of devices as to

timing and noise pulses. The results of the measurements presented in this paper will be used has
input to the numerical simulations of the detector response.

The paper is organised as follows: in section 2 the setup and the method used for the measure-
ment of the QE are presented; in section 3 the gain and Time over Threshold (ToT) dependence on
the high voltage are discussed; finally in section 4 the results from the test of about 7000 PMTs are
summarised.

2 Quantum efficiency measurements

The photocathode quantum efficiency is measured in DC-mode, without any amplification and with
100% collection efficiency. A voltage of −280V is applied to the photocathode. A dedicated
base is used to connect the dynodes to the input of a picoammeter. The PMT is illuminated
with a xenon lamp whose light, after passing through a monochromator, produces a 1 cm spot on
the photocathode. The light intensity is determined using a reference photodiode, calibrated by
Hamamatsu in the wavelength range of 200÷800 nm, in steps of 10 nm with a precision of 0.1%.
Reference measurements are repeated hourly. The scheme of the test setup for QE measurements is
shown in figure 1. The quantum efficiency is calculated as the ratio between PMT and photodiode
photocurrents weighted with the known QE of the photodiode. QE is measured in the wavelength
range of interest, 280÷700 nm, in steps of 5 nm. More details on the method and on the possible
systematics associated with the measurement can be found in ref. [4].

The photocathode QE has been measured for 56 PMTs chosen randomly from different produc-
tion batches, in order to cross-check the measurements performed by the manufacturer on the full
production. The results are presented in figure 2. Green lines represent QE curves for individual
PMTs. The continuous black curve is the mean value with one standard deviation at each measured
wavelength. For the wavelengths indicated in the KM3NeT specifications, the mean QE values with
one standard deviation are: (26.9 ± 1.2)% (@404 nm) and (21.6 ± 1.5)% (@470 nm). The results
are in agreement with the requirements.

3 Gain and high voltage calibration

The manufacturer provides for each PMT the nominal high voltage (HV) needed to achieve the gain,
defined as the ratio between anode and photocathode currents, of 3 × 106. However, in KM3NeT
application, PMTs are not used in current, but in pulse mode. The majority of the detected pulses
are due to single photoelectrons (spe). A charge distribution of spe pulses is shown in figure 3. The
first peak is the so-called pedestal, the baseline signal from the PMT in absence of photon induced
pulses; the red line is a Gaussian fit to the spe distribution. The gain is calculated as follows

G = (< SPE > − < PED >) × (vgain/50) × τstep/(Again × e)

where < SPE > is the mean value of spe distribution; < PED > is the mean value of the pedestal;
vgain is the ADC scale expressed as Volt per ADC channel; 50 (expressed in Ohm) is the ADC
load resistor, i.e. the oscilloscope input impedance; τstep is the sampling time step in seconds; Again
is the amplification of the PMT signal performed with an amplifier; e = 1.6022 × 10−19 C. The
following set of values has been used to obtain the plot shown in figure 3: vgain = 2.21× 10−3 V per
ADC channel; τstep = 10−9 s; Again = 10. For (< SPE > − < PED >) ' 125 ADC channels the
corresponding gain is then ∼ 3.45 × 106.

Given the different methods to measure the gain, in current mode by Hamamatsu and in pulse
mode by KM3NeT, differences in nominal voltages are expected. Therefore, a method of HV tuning
in order to get the 3 × 106 gain in pulse mode has been developed.

other dynodes, as specified by the manufacturer. In a dark box the whole PMT surface is uniformly
illuminated by fast LED pulses (460 nm central value with a 800 ns FWHM) at 1 kHz frequency.
Light from the pulser is delivered to the dark box via an optical fiber. A diffusor is installed at the
fiber output at a distance of ∼1m from the PMT. The pulser amplitude is tuned to obtain a mean
number of ∼0.1 photons per pulse detected by the PMT. The signal is amplified ten times and sent
to a LeCroy Waverunner 6100 oscilloscope. The latter is triggered with the sync signal from the
pulser and the waveforms of PMT signals are saved with a sampling rate of 109 samples per second.
The gain is calculated integrating the signal within a gate of 20 ns and fitting the distribution with a
Gaussian function. Measurements of the gain are performed at seven different voltages in steps of
25V around the HV value provided by the manufacturer. These results are used to fit the gain-HV
linear dependence in a double logarithmic scale (gain slope). The HV value corresponding to a
gain of 3 × 106 is calculated from the fit with 1V precision.

determined high voltage values and those provided by the manufacturer to achieve a 3 × 106 gain.

In figure 4-left the histogramwith the gain slopes is shown. TheHVvalues to achieve the 3×106

gain derived from these measurements have been compared to those provided by the manufacturer.
The difference between these two values is presented in figure 4-right. The systematic difference
can be explained with the different methods used for gain measurement. The peak-to-valley ratio
has been measured for same sample of 66 PMTs using the new set of HV values determined in
pulse mode. The definition of the peak-to-valley ratio is shown in figure 5-left. This parameter
is connected to the capability of a PMT to discriminate single photoelectron signals, larger values
corresponding to a better discrimination. The measured distribution of the peak-to-valley ratio is
shown in figure 5-right.

A dedicated base has been developed for operating the PMTs inside the KM3NeT DOMs [5].
These bases are equipped with current amplifiers, whose output is proportional to the charge of the
initial pulse. Amplified signals have a long trailing tail with lengths proportional to the amplitude.

Spe pulses after the amplification have an amplitude of ∼500mV. A tunable threshold discriminator
on the base provides a rectangular ToT signal which is sent to the Central Logic Board (CLB) of the
DOM for digitisation. In normal operation, only ToT signals are digitised and the base dissipates
only 3.3mW. The base allows also to read out the amplified analogue signal. In this case the power
consumption increases, but this feature allows for threshold and ToT calibration in the laboratory
where the power consumption is not critical. Both analogue and ToT are generated as differential
signals. An example is shown in figure 6.

A correct interpretation of the ToT is needed for a correct usage of the data collected by the
PMTs in the apparatus. A threshold-ToT calibration has been therefore performed on a sub-set
of 5 of the 66 calibrated PMTs, equipped with the KM3NeT active bases. The procedure works
as follows. The derived HV for the 3 × 106 gain is applied and a few spe data sets are taken

with different thresholds set on the bases. Using the amplitude distribution of the analogue signal,
thresholds are derived and then expressed as a fraction of spe. The value of 0.3 spe is chosen as a
default threshold. This level of the threshold allows detection a large fraction of spe signal and at
the same time is well separated from the noise. The final measurement at nominal HV and default
threshold has been performed. The derived ToT distribution is peaked at 26.4 ns, see figure 7. This
value has been chosen as a nominal ToT for spe.

4 Timing properties and noise pulses

A special device (DarkBox) has been developed [6] to calibrate a large sample of PMTs and validate
the manufacturer production. The PMTs are tested as prepared for integration in the DOMs, i.e. they
are equipped with their bases and coated with the same insulating varnish used for the bases [7]. The
DarkBox is shown schematically in figure 8. It consists of a wooden box equipped with removable
trays designed to hold the PMTs under test. A time calibrated electrical cabling system has been
made to connect PMTs to the data acquisition system placed outside the box, maintaining the same
time signal delay for all PMTs. The data acquisition system is built replicating the electronics
system of the DOMs, which includes for each set of 31 PMTs a control board equipped with
two signal collection boards (the ‘octopuses’ in figure 8) interfacing the PMTs. Subnanosecond
synchronisation of the control boards is achieved by means of White Rabbit [6]. A picosecond
accuracy laser and a calibrated optical splitting system are used to illuminate all PMTs at spe
level. Details on the mechanics, the electronics and the laser calibration system as well as on its
performance can be found in [6].

Hereafter the results obtained by testing 6960 PMTs are presented.
The accurate, but time consuming, HV tuning procedure described in section 3 is not possible

for the PMTs installed in the apparatus and is not viable when testing a large number of PMTs. For
this case, the PMT gains are equalised based on the indirect observable of the ToT value. For each
PMT the HV value is set in order to have the peak value of the time over threshold distribution at
26.4 ns, for a spe signal at 0.3 spe threshold. These values are referred to as the “tuned HV”.

During a run with laser, the ToT distribution of the first hit is collected. This distribution has a
peak in the range 26–27 ns confirming the reliability of the automatic HV calibration tuning.

The results discussed in the following sections have been obtained with tuned HV.

4.1 Dark count rates

The dark counts are random noise pulses that can be measured at the anode of a PMT even in total
darkness. The most significant source of random noise for a PMT is the spontaneous thermionic
emission of electrons by the photocathode. Pulses that result from this process correspond mainly
to a spe. The rate at which these pulses are observed is proportional to the photocathode area and
varies considerably depending on the photocathode material. Bialkali photocathodes (as those used
in KM3NeT PMTs) have the lowest ratio per unit area. Another source of dark pulses is the natural
radioactivity in the structure of the PMT itself. The most important components are usually 40K
and Th contained in the glass envelope. β particles emitted in radioactive decays will give rise to a
flash of Cherenkov radiation that can produce photoelectron emission from the photocathode [8].

Once the PMTs are fed with the tuned HV, dark count rates are monitored for 9 hours. During
this time, the PMT recover from the initial exposure to the light and the dark count rate becomes
stable. The measured rate is the average over the last 100 s of the run for each PMT. The results are
shown in figure 9. The average dark count rate is about 1300 cps, while the fraction of PMTs above
2000 cps is 7.1%. These PMTs were tested again after a longer darkening (48 hours) reducing the
fraction of PMTs not to be integrated in the KM3NeT DOMs to 3.5%. The average dark count rate
of good PMTs is about 700 cps.

The effect of the artificial light on the dark count rate has been also studied. Two different
artificial light sources have been used: fluorescent tube lamps and LED lamps. The dark count
rate for six PMTs was initially measured in the DarkBox after several weeks of darkening. For
all of them the measured dark count rate was below 200 cps. These PMTs were then exposed for
two hours to a fluorescent tube lamp light before the dark count rate measurement started. It took
about a week of darkening to stabilise the dark count rate at the value previously measured. The

same measurement was then performed after a two hour exposure to a LED lamp light.1 It took 4
hours to stabilise the dark count rate at the value previously measured initially. Therefore, it can be
concluded that laboratories where PMTs are handled should ideally be equipped with LED lamps.

4.2 Measurement of PMT time characteristics and of spurious pulses

Unlike dark counts, spurious pulses are time-correlated with the expected PMT response to light.
Indeed, they can come early or can be delayed by a characteristic time with respect to the electron
transit time through the PMT.They are usually classified as prepulses, delayed pulses and afterpulses.
The tests illustrated in this section have been made by collecting 10-minutes runs while illuminating
the PMTs with a 470 nm laser, after the needed darkening time. The laser trigger frequency was set
to 20 kHz and its light output tuned so as to operate the PMTs in the spe regime (0.1 photoelectron
per pulse). These data have been analysed to estimate PMT timing performances and measure the
fraction of spurious pulses.

Timing distribution. Time characteristics of PMTs have been measured by detecting and
analysing the so-called first photon hits, i.e. pulses detected in a window of 200 ns around the
expected arrival time of the PMT signal. The distribution of arrival time of the first hits for a typical
PMT is shown in figure 10a. The main peak of the distribution corresponds to the PMT transit time
(TT) and the transit time spread (TTS) is defined as the FWHM of this peak. The distribution of
the TTS is shown in figure 11. All values are below 5 ns.

Determination of prepulses and delayed pulses. To evaluate the average probability of occur-
rence of spurious pulses the arrival time distributions of all PMTs have been shifted by subtracting
the transit time, normalised and then summed up. The resulting distribution, normalised as to

1LED lamps with color in the range 3000–6000K lead to similar results.

obtain the average probability for spurious pulses, is shown in figure 10b. Prepulses, that arise from
a direct photoeffect on the first dynode due to photons that pass through the photocathode without
interacting [9], appear as a non Gaussian tail on the left side of the main peak.

For a 3-inch PMT the prepulse arrival time is in the range 10 ÷ 60 ns before the main pulse.
However, a more conservative approach has been adopted and a range 10 ÷ 60 ns before the main
pulse has been considered. The percentage of prepulses is defined as the ratio of the hits in the
window [Tpeak − 60.5 ns,Tpeak − 10.5 ns] over the number of the first hits; Tpeak corresponds to the
centre of the maximum bin (transit time peak).

Prepulses

Delayed pulses are due to elastic scattering of photoelectrons on the first dynode [9]. A pho-
toelectron hitting the first dynode may be backscattered without liberating any secondary electron.
Backscattered photoelectrons on the first dynode are decelerated by the electric field and then ac-
celerated again towards it, extracting secondary electrons. Thus, also delayed pulses are detected
as the response of the PMT to a light event. Delayed pulses do not have a random time distribution,
but they tend to accumulate around a time that is twice the photocathode to the first dynode transit
time. Therefore, delayed pulses distort the falling edge of the main peak and give rise to a bump at
∼ 35 ns as shown in figure 10b. The percentage of delayed pulses has been calculated as the ratio
of the first hits in the window [Tpeak + 15.5 ns,Tpeak + 60.5 ns] over the number of all first hits.

The distribution of the delayed pulses measured for the tested PMTs is shown in figure 13.
98.5% of the total sample has a delayed fraction below 5.5%. The average delayed pulse fraction
is 3.2%.

Determination of afterpulses. Afterpulses are noise pulses that follow the main PMT response
to a detected light event. They can be classified as early (Type I) or late (Type II) afterpulses. Type
I afterpulses are due to the emission of light from the stages of the multiplier structure, which can
reach the photocatode producing further photoelectrons. In general PMTs exhibit Type I afterpulses
in the time window 10 ÷ 80 ns after the primary pulse. Type II afterpulses are caused by residual
gases that can be ionised by the passage of electrons in the space between the photocathode and the
first dynode and also through the multiplier structure. The positive ions that are formed will drift
backward and some can find a path back to the photocathode. Since the drift velocity of the positive
ions is low, the time taken to return to the photocathode can range from hundreds of nanoseconds to

tens of microseconds. It also depends on the type of ions, on the position where they are generated
and on the supply voltage.

In a 3-inch PMT, Type I afterpulses arrive within ∼ 20 ns after the first hits.Since the KM3NeT
front-end electronics does not allow for a separation of consecutive hits with a time difference
.26 ns, no direct measurement of early afterpulses is possible with the current setup.

Afterpulses were studied by analysing the ToT versus transit time correlation (figure 14). In
this plot four regions with long transit time and ToT exceeding the spe signal can be identified.
These events are due to the residual gases inside the PMT. Given the typical drift velocity of each
ion, the one located at transit time of ∼ 1 ÷ 1.5 µs is presumably produced by CH4 ions, the one
at ∼ 3 ÷ 4 µs by Cs ions. Other regions located below 1 µs transit time are due to hydrogen and
helium ions. The percentage of Type II afterpulses is determined as the ratio of afterpulses in the
time window [Tpeak + 100.5 ns,Tpeak + 10 µs] over the total number of hits.

The percentages of spurious pulses of all types are corrected taking into account the dark noise
hits that contaminate both first hits and spurious pulse distributions.

The histogram of the afterpulse fraction measured for the whole PMT sample is shown in
figure 15. 92.4% of the total sample has an afterpulse fraction below 15%. The average afterpulse
fraction is 7.1%.

5 Conclusions

A large sample of PMTs, consisting of about 7000 3-inch Hamamatsu type R12199-02, has been
fully characterised and calibrated in order to assess its performance with a high degree of accuracy.
In order to check the quality of the supplied detectors, at first we randomly selected PMTs and
measured quantities that routinely monitored by the manufacturer. Therefore, for a sub-sample of
about 60 PMTs also the QE, the gain and the peak-to-valley ratio have been measured and the results

found in agreement with the expectations. The results of these measurements will be used as input
to numerical simulations of the KM3NeT detector.

For a full characterisation of the sample in terms of the main parameters such as dark counts,
TTS and spurious pulse fractions, a fast and reliable procedure has been set up to measure these
quantities and measurements have been performed on almost 7000 tubes. These tests allowed to
identify a small fraction (∼ 7%) of PMTs that do not comply with the specifications given by the
KM3NeT Collaboration.
