Abstract

There is a considerable lack of information concerning marine invertebrate sensitivity to sound exposure. However,
recent findings on cuttlefish and octopi showed that exposure to artificial noise had a direct consequence on the
functionality and physiology of the statocysts, sensory organs, which are responsible for their equilibrium and
movements in the water column. Owing to a lack of available data on deep diving cephalopod species, we conducted
a noise exposure comparative experiment on one Mediterranean squid, Illex coindetii, and on the European squid
Loligo vulgaris. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed similar injuries in the inner structure of the statocysts,
as those found in cuttlefish and octopi. In addition to the ultrastructural description of the lesions, we publish here the
first images of the crista-cupula system and inner statocyst cavity of I. coindetii.

Introduction

Although marine mammals [1–6] and fishes [7–10] have
originally attracted most of the research attention on the effects
of noise on the oceanic ecosystem, invertebrate sensitivity to
noise and possible negative effects after sound exposure has
also been addressed by several authors [11–19]. A detailed
literature review on these effects can be found in recent
publications [20,21].

It was suggested [20,21] that cephalopods sensory organs,
the statocysts, were presumably the best candidates to injury if
exposed to loud sound sources. Indeed, all cephalopods have
two statocysts generally located within the cephalic cartilage
(Figure 1). The statocyst morphology and its functions have
been extensively described elsewhere by different authors
[22–28]. The statocysts are specialized balloon-shape bodies
filled with endolymph that contain the sensory hair cells. These
cells lie on the inside wall of the inner sac and are grouped into
two main areas of the sensory epithelium: the macula-statolith
system and the crista-cupula system. These systems have
clear similarities to the analogous vertebrate vestibular system
and present a weight-lending mass and an epithelial layer

containing small supporting cells as well as large sensory hair
cells [28]. However, unlike ciliated cells of the latter species,
the cephalopods’ statocyst sensory cells carry multiple
kinocilia. Surrounding the base of the kinocilium are microvilli.
Kinocilia and microvilli form elongated bundles. Each bundle
represents a single hair cell. Adjacent accessory structures
(statolith, statoconia, cupula) are responsible for sensory
perception. When there is a stimulus, tiny deflations occur in
the hair bundles, resulting in cell body depolarization and
subsequent transmission of information to the sensory nervous
system. Within the central nervous system, the sensory input of
the statocysts is used to regulate a wide range of behaviours,
including locomotion, posture, control of eye movement and of
the pattern of the body coloration, and are suspected to be
responsible for the reception of the low frequency sound waves
[25,29,30]. The sensory epithelia of the gravity receptor
system, in resemblance to the vertebrate auditory apparatus
[31] have, in addition to primary hair cells, secondary sensory
hair cells, which are unidirectional morphologically and
physiologically polarized, first-order afferent neurons, and
efferent nerve fibres. The efferent fibres of the statocyst

terminate both on hair cells and the axons of afferent neurons
[32,33].

When exposed to relatively low intensity low frequency
sounds, Controlled Exposure Experiments (CEE) revealed
lesions which took place in the sensory epithelia of the
statocysts’ inner structures of the common Mediterranean
cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and common octopus ( Octopus
vulgaris) [20,21]. The aim of the present study was to
contribute to a better understanding of the effects of noise on
marine invertebrate sound reception by comparatively
describing the ultrastructure of Loligo vulgaris and Illex coindetii
statocyst sensory epithelium after exposure to the same
stimuli.

Since L. vulgaris (Family Loliginidae) and I. coindetii (Family
Ommastrephidae) are decapod cephalopods, the ultrastructure
of their statocyst is indeed very similar to S.officinalis [21]. The
ecology of these species is, however, very different. S.

officinalis, a benthic species, can reach a maximum depth of
200m while L. vulgaris, a neritic species, descends down to
550m. I. coindetii usually lives at depths of between 100 and
400m, but is commonly found deeper, at 1100m [34]. Would
this difference in behavior and physiology, in particular the
resistance to high pressures, be reflected in the ultrastructure
of these squid sensory cells? And would noise affect them
similarly as described in S. officinalis?

Materials and Methods

Cephalopod specimens
Nine individuals from L. vulgaris (mantle length 15-25 cm

corresponding to 7 adults and 2 sub-adults) and four I. coindetii
(mantle length 10-13 cm, all adults), were obtained from the
Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean Sea) between February of
2008 and August of 2010, and kept in a closed system of

recirculating natural seawater (at 18-20°C, salinity 35‰ and
natural oxygen pressure) consisting of 2 mechanically filtered
fiberglass reinforced plastic tanks with a capacity of 2000L, that
were connected to each other (LAB - UPC, Vilanova i la Geltrú)
(Figure 2). This included a physicochemical self-filtration
system with activated carbon and sand, driven by a circulation
pump.

Individuals were supplied with live crab (Carcinus maenas)
food ad libitum and were maintained in the tank system until
the exposure. Several specimens (see below) were used as
controls and were kept in the same conditions as the
experimental animals until being exposed to noise [21].

Sound Exposure Protocol
Sequential Controlled Exposure Experiments (CEE) were

conducted on adult individuals (n=5) L. vulgaris and (n=2) I.
condietii. An additional set of 2 adult and 2 sub-adult
individuals of (n=4) L. vulgaris and (n=2) I. condietii was used
as a control. The same sequential CEEs were conducted as
with other cephalopods spp. studied in this project [20,21]. The
difference here is that, since the results from the analysis with

S. officinalis showed lesions immediately after noise exposure,
and incremental effects up to 96 hours (longest period of
observation), we concentrated the study on animals sacrificed
immediately after and 48 hours after exposure, thus reducing
the number of specimens used in the experiments.

Individuals were maintained in the tank system (tank A) until
the exposure. The exposure consisted of a 50-400 Hz
sinusoidal wave sweeps with 100% duty cycle and a 1-second
sweep period for two hours. The sweep was produced and
amplified through an in-air loudspeaker while the level received
was measured by a calibrated B&K 8106 hydrophone (RL =
157±5 dB re 1 μPa with peak levels up to SPL = 175 dB re 1
μPa). Some of the animals were used as controls and were
kept in the same conditions as the experimental animals until
the latter were exposed to noise, in an independent tank (C).
The sacrificing process was identical for controls and exposed
animals. After the exposure, the individuals that were not
immediately sacrificed were placed in tank B (see Figure 2 and
sequence of sacrifices below). The independent experimental
tank (C) was located in a separate location, acoustically
isolated from tanks A and B. Following exposure, the samples

(Figure 2) were obtained from the individuals (exposed and
controls) at the above intervals.

As stated in previous publications [20,21], it must be
reiterated here that the experiment was not set up to find
specific threshold levels, but designed to investigate if these
two squid species would present similar acoustic lesions, as
found in S. officinalis and O. vulgaris, when they were exposed
to low frequency sounds. Indeed, the non-even distribution of
sounds in the experimental tank associated tothe free
movement of the exposed animals made impossible to define
proper received levels during exposure. In addition, particle
motion was not measured, for its importance in the acoustic
trauma mechanism could not be determined. Particle motions
associated with the acoustic pressures in the experimental
setup were most likely higher than the particle motions that
would be found accompanying similar acoustic pressures
produced in natural sea conditions. Therefore, the measured
levels during the experiment cannot immediately be taken as
reference values triggering lesions in these species. Future
research should map in-tank acoustic pressures, quantify
particle motions and reproduce the experiments in open ocean
conditions before a definitive conclusion is drawn on the
relationship between sound source levels and observed
acoustic trauma.

Removal of statocysts
In all experiments, isolated head preparations were obtained

by decapitation. The experimental protocol strictly followed the
necessary precautions to comply with the current ethical and
welfare considerations when dealing with cephalopods in
scientific experimentation [35]. The statocysts with their
surrounding cartilage were extracted and fixed for observation
and analysis. For fixation, the statocyst cavity was opened and
special care was taken to prevent mechanical damage to the
inner tissues. The analysis was performed on tissues obtained
from left and right statocysts.

Imaging Techniques
The same imaging techniques were used as with S.

officinalis and O. vulgaris [20,21]: individuals were processed
according to routine SEM procedures. No quantification of the
lesions was performed since no reference values, both in terms
of acoustic pressure and particle motion, were available (see
above sound exposure protocol section): because of the non-
evenly distribution of the acoustic pressure into the tank, the
specimens were probably exposed to different levels of
acoustic pressure (and particle motion) therefore no results are
presented here on the corresponding fraction of hair cells that
were damaged; on the number of kinocilia that were lost; nor
on the number of cells exhibiting swollen endoplasmic reticula.
The results section will thus concentrate on a qualitative
ultrastructural description of the sensory epithelia.

Light microscopy (LM)
In addition to the statocysts extraction, a routine necropsy

was conducted, to collect samples of different tissues from
controls and exposed individuals, which were further fixed in
10% formalin, sectioned, stained with methylene blue, covered

with Durcupan and observed using Olympus CX41 light
microscope. This analysis was conducted to determine the
presence of lesions in mantle surface epithelia, inner muscular
fibers of collagen, various organs of the digestive tract, the
circulatory, nervous, sensory, respiratory, reproductive and
excretory systems and the ink gland complex.

Scanning electron microscopy
Eighteen statocysts from 9 L. vulgaris and eight statocysts

from 4 I. coindetii were used for this study. Fixation was
performed in glutaraldehyde 2, 5 % for 24-48h at 4°C.
Statocysts were dehydrated in graded alcohol solutions and
critical-point dried with liquid carbon dioxide in a Leica
EmCPD030 unit (Leica Mycrosystems, Austria). The dried
statocysts were cut open and flattened out to expose the
statocyst structures and then mounted on specimen stubs with
double-sided tape. The mounted tissues were gold-palladium
coated with a Polaron SC500 sputter coated unit (Quorum
Technologies, Ltd.) and viewed with a variable pressure Hitachi
S3500N scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-
Technologies Co., Ltd, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of
5kV in the Institute of Marine Sciences of The Spanish
Research Council (CSIC) facilities.

Results

Light microscopy (LM)
None of the organs showed any post-mortem artifacts nor

any specific lesion except light hemorrhaging in two individuals
(not shown here), at mantle level, probably due to impacts
against the tank walls during handling operations. Apart from
statocysts (see data below), the systematic comparison of the
histological preparations between exposed individuals and
controls did not reveal the presence of pathology associated
with sound exposure in any of the tissues analyzed.

Structural and ultrastructural investigations of the
statocyst sensory epithelium

Regardless of the species, all exposed individuals presented
the same lesions in the statocyst sensory epithelia and the
same incremental effects versus time

Loligo vulgaris and Illex coindetii macula
Just after sound exposure (Figure 3 A-D) in comparison with

the same tissues from control animals (Figure 3G), damage
was observed on the macula statica princeps (msp) sensory
epithelium, by SEM analysis. The hair cells were partially
ejected from the sensory epithelium. There were spherical
holes on the base of the hair cells and a rupture of the plasma
membrane, probably due to the extrusion of the internal cellular
material. Some hair cells had lost a number of kinocilia or
showed bent and flaccid kinocilia.

On animals sacrificed 48h after sound exposure (Figure 3 E-
F), the sensory epithelium of the msp presented hair cells
partially or totally ejected from the sensory epithelium. The
apical ciliated apex and part of the cellular body were extruded
above the sensory epithelium into the statocyst cavity. Some

hair cells had totally, or in a considerable number, lost the
kinocilia and remains of their roots were visible within the
damaged epithelium or exhibited bent kinocilia. Large
extensions of msp epithelium presented rupture of the plasma
membrane on the base of the kinocillia probably due to the
swelling and extrusion of the cellular body. The spherical holes
observed in animals sacrificed right after the exposure were
more pronounced here, confirming the extrusion of the internal
cellular material.

presented the center of the msp free of hair cells (Figure 3 E-

base of the hair cells arranged in rows, as well as rupture of the
plasma membrane, due to the extrusion of the internal cellular
material. As a consequence, apical ciliated hair cells were
partially ejected from the sensory epithelium. The damage on

kinocilia was not extensive to all the individuals but some
individuals showed bent and flaccid kinocilia in their hair cell
rows.

One individual of I. coindetii presented the cupula partially
adhered to the inner surface of the statocyst (Figure 4B), in
comparison with the same tissue from control animals (Figure
4A, C, D). In the same animal, giant cilia (typical on terrestrial
animals exposed to sound) are formed by the fusion of the
anchored cilia in an area of the inner statocyst epithelium
located between two crista-cupula segments (Figure 5C,
Inserts in C).

Lining epithelium of Illex coindetii statocyst
Figure 6 shows the lining epithelium of I. coindetii. Its

features are similar to the other Decapod species inner
statocyst structure: flat hexagonal cells carry cilia on the outer
side, which project into the cavity. Microvilli are present with
less density than in L. vulgaris and surround the epithelium
cells (Figure 6 E). Other inner statocyst areas near of the
macula from I. coindetii show very high density of cilia covering
all the surface of the flat hexagonal cells of the lining epithelium
(Figure 6 F).

Apart from the specific sensory areas (msp and crista), in
comparison with the same tissues from control animals (Figure
6), the individuals showed acoustic trauma, affecting a wide
range of statocyst inner ciliated areas (Figure 7), even on
individuals immediately sacrificed after exposure (not shown)
but particularly on the individuals sacrificed 48h after exposure
(Figure 7). All exposed groups showed lesions in some areas
of the lining epithelium of the cavity which consists of flat
hexagonal cells with oval nuclei. In some areas of the
statocyst, bundles of cilia emerge between the epithelial cells
(Figure 6). The lesions in this epithelium consisted basically in
the extrusion of the cellular material into the statocyst cavity. In
individuals sacrificed at 48 hours after sound exposure there
was a massive extension of holes following the extrusion of
inner cellular material. The cilia and microvilli were bent flaccid
and disorganized in almost all the samples (Figure 7 A-C). In
individuals sacrificed 48h some individuals presented some
bent, flaccid and expoiled microvilli (Figure 7D).

Discussion

Images of Illex coindetii
This study shows the first published images of the macula,

crista-cupula system and inner statocyst cavity of I. coindetii.
No previous studies have been carried out on this species.
Further analysis of different live stages of Illex are needed for a
better description of these ultrastructures. As in other
decapods, in some parts of its inner cavity the flat hexagonal
cells carry cilia on the outer side, which project into the cavity,
microvilli are present with less density than in L. vulgaris and
surround the epithelium cells. The inner statocyst area near the
macula shows very high density of microvilli covering the whole
surface of the flat hexagonal cells of the lining epithelium. The
cupula of I. coindetii attached to the crista presents a
filamentous structure similar to the other decapods. Model of
the I. coindetii statocyst liner epithelium is shown next to the
hair cell rows that surround the main rows of crista. Microvilli
grow in some of the liner epithelium cells.

The observation of the statocyst ultrastructure of Illex
showed a non-previously described feature in cephalopods: the
center of the macula princeps presented no hair cells. In other
species, it was hypothesized that the macula grows by adding
rings of sensory cells from the center to the periphery of the
sensory epithelium [36]. Here, I. coindetii presents the ciliary
groups of the hair cells of the macula statica princeps (msp)
arranged in regular lines, which follow the shape of the
epithelium. The microvilli surround the base of the kinocilia.
Cilia and microvilli form elongated groups. Each group
represents a single hair cell. Every hair cell is arranged in line
with an adjacent hair cell only at the macula periphery (Figure 3
E-F).

The present results suggest there are no hair cells in the
center of the macula during the whole Illex life. Alternatively, or
additionally, rings of hair cells would grow from the periphery to
the center of the macula in this species,

Acoustic Impact
In terrestrial vertebrates (including humans) exposure to very

high sound pressure levels may result in permanent hearing
loss because the sound destroys sensory hair cells of the inner
ear and fractures the bones of the middle ear, in case of blast
overpressure [37,38]. Exposure to lower levels for longer
periods can also lead to permanent hearing loss due to the
death of sensory cells [39].

Data on the effects of exposure to sound on fishes is very
limited compared with data for terrestrial vertebrates. Some
research reported that sound can damage sensory cells in ears
of some fish species [40–43]. However, no study has yet
determined the relationship between the damage of hair cells
and permanent hearing loss in fishes. On the contrary, a post-
embryonic recovery of hair cells after noise exposure in some
species showed that fish hair cells do regenerate [44,45].

The work of Enger conducted by SEM [40] found that some
sensory cells lost their ciliary bundles in the ears of cod (Gadus
morhua) after 1-5h exposure to pure tones (100-110 dB above
threshold in its most sensitive hearing frequency range.
Hastings [41,42] reported damage to auditory hair cells in
hearing (Carasius auratus) happened after exposure to
continuous tones (120-140 dB above threshold in its most
sensitive hearing frequency range) for approximately 2h, and in
oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) after 1h of continuous exposure to
a 300 Hz pure tone. In this last case the damage was only
visible in animals that were alive four days after sound
exposure, which allows the conclusion to be drawn that
damage caused from exposure to sound takes some time to
become visually apparent. Using electron microscopy,
McCauley [43] showed destruction of hair cells in ears of pink
snapper (Pagrus auratus), a sedentary species, after exposure
to sound of a seismic air gun. The damage observed in these
four species was only a visual manifestation of what may have
been a much greater effect. Temporary deafness could result
in a fish being unable to respond to presence of predators and
to locate preys and mates. It is relevant to mention that several
studies showed no damage after exposure to very intense
sounds produced by seismic movements [46], and sonar
exercices [47]. It was shown that damage to sensory hair cells

Statocyst Damage after Sound Exposure

in fish after very loud pile driving only occurs at sound levels
much louder than those that cause other damage to the fish
[48].

Because of the very scarce data available in the literature, it
is necessary to be extremely cautious when extrapolating
results between fish species or received signals, because of
the differences in hair cells and hearing systems, the limited
data of precise stimulus (pressure and/or particle velocity) and
the time course and frequency components of the signals.

The same considerations may be applied to the studies on
the effects of sound on sensory epithelia of cephalopod
statocyst. No reference data was available before the current
study. This work presents the same morphological and
ultrastructural evidence of a massive acoustic trauma induced

on individuals belonging to other cephalopod species (S.
officinalis and O. vulgaris) by low frequency sound CEE. The
consequences of such CEE are permanent and substantial
alterations of the sensory hair cells of the statocysts, the
structures responsible for the animals’ sense of balance and
position [20,21].

Interestingly, Illex, being an epi-mesopelagic species
appeared to be affected at a same level. This would mean that
the response to low frequency noise would equally alter
sensory organs of any species of cephalopods, no matter their
foraging ecology. However, because the experimental
conditions placed the animals very close to the surface and no
variation in pressure levels was performed, the question

and some cells exhibit holes (arrows). B: Note the holes (arrowheads) in the epithelial cells and the bending cilia (arrows) on an

remains whether this species would also be equally affected
when exposed to noise at greater depths.

The lack of any lesion in control animals, or in other organs
than the statocyts in exposed individuals, together with the
similarity of the injuries found in cuttlefish and octopi after
exposure to the same acoustic stimulus, allow us to conclude
on a common cause-to-effect relationship between sound and
trauma in all exposed individuals. Nevertheless, the acoustic
pressure (received) levels reported in this paper cannot be
taken as reference values triggering the described lesions,
since the laboratory experimental protocol did not include
particle motion measurements, nor a precise acoustic mapping
of the experimental tank. Future research must address these
issues to better understand and define the physics behind the
onset of acoustic trauma when cephalopods are exposed to
noise.
