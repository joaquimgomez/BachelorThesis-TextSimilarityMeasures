ABSTRACT
The cephalopod statocyst and lateral line systems are sensory organs
involved in orientation and balance. Lateral lines allow cephalopods
to detect particle motion and are used for locating prey or predators in
low light conditions. Here, we show the first analysis of damaged
sensory epithelia in three species of cephalopod hatchlings (Sepia
officinalis, Loligo vulgaris and Illex coindetii) after sound exposure.
Our results indicate lesions in the statocyst sensory epithelia, similar
to what was found in adult specimens. The novelty is that the severity
of the lesions advanced more rapidly in hatchlings than in adult
animals; i.e. the degree of lesions seen in hatchlings immediately
after noise exposure would develop within 48 h in adults. This feature
suggests a critical period of increased sensitivity to acoustic trauma in
those species as has been described in developing mammalian
cochlea and avian basilar papilla. The hair cells in the lateral lines of
S. officinalis followed the same pattern of damage occurrence, while
those of L. vulgaris and I. coindetii displayed a decreasing severity of
damage after 24 h. These differences could be due to dissimilarities
in size and life stages between the three species.

INTRODUCTION
There is a considerable lack of information concerning the
cephalopod’s reception of sounds (Packard et al., 1990; Bleckmann
et al., 1991; Bullock and Budelmann, 1991; Budelmann et al., 1995;
Hu et al., 2009; Kaifu et al., 2008;Mooney et al., 2010). Cephalopods
are sensitive to vibration stimuli and are able to perceive these stimuli
through the statocyst receptor and the lateral line analogue systems
(Budelmann et al., 1997; Budelmann and Bleckmann, 1988). Several
authors have addressed studies on invertebrate sensitivity to noise and
possible negative effects after sound exposure (Budelmann and
Bleckmann, 1988; Lagarder̀e, 1982; Regnault and Lagardere, 1983;
Lovell et al., 2005, 2006; Fewtrell and McCauley, 2012; Aguilar de
Soto, 2016; Carroll et al., 2017). A detailed literature review on the

inner structure of the statocyst and the effect of sound on its sensory
epithelia can be found in recent publications (André et al., 2011; Solé
et al., 2013a,b, 2016, 2017).

Many cephalopods have lines of ciliated cells on their head
and arms which are considered invertebrate analogue to the
mechanoreceptive lateral lines of fish and aquatic amphibians.
This is an example of convergent evolution between a
sophisticated cephalopod and a vertebrate sensory system
(Budelmann and Bleckmann, 1988). The ciliated cells of this
lateral line system are sensitive to local water movements and are
able to perceive hydrodynamic pressure. The lines of epidermal
hair cells running over the head and arms of the cephalopod are
shown to be able to detect local water movements generated by a
vibrating sphere (Budelmann and Bleckmann, 1988; Komak et al.,
2005). Stimulation of the lines with artificial water displacements
of defined frequency and amplitude evoke receptor potentials with
features very similar to the lateral microphonic potential of fish
(Bleckmann et al., 1991; Budelmann et al., 1997; Budelmann and
Bleckmann, 1988).

The epidermal lines are present in the late embryonic stages and
hatchlings of cephalopods (Naef, 1928; Sundermann, 1982, 1983;
Lenz et al., 1995; Lenz, 1997; Villanueva and Norman, 2008). This
sensory system consists of ciliated primary sensory hair cells that
carry kinocilia with an internal 9×2+2 tubules content (Sundermann,
1983; Hanlon and Budelmann, 1987) and non-ciliated accessory
cells, running in an anterior-posterior direction, located on the arms,
head, anterior part of dorsal mantle and funnel. Cuttlefish and squid
show eight epidermal lines on their head (four on each side), two
dorsally- and two laterally-positioned lines (one above and one below
the eye), which continue on the arms (except the line below the eye,
Fig. S1), an additional paired, short, fifth line on the ventral side of the
head (Sundermann, 1983) and a broad band of ciliated cells on the
ventral funnel surface.

In Octopus vulgaris hatchlings, the unique single funnel line is
located along its midline. The other epidermal lines (dorsal,
dorsoventral, ventrolateral and ventral) are paired occupying both
sides of the head and right and left arms (Fig. S1). As opposed to
cuttlefish and squid, the epidermal lines found in octopus paralarvae
have not been reported in adult octopi.

Each epidermal line consists of ciliated cells that carry
approximately 100 kinocilia per cell, each 10–20 µm in length.
Each hair cell is surrounded by several smaller supporting cells that
carry only microvilli (Sundermann, 1983). Each hair cell is
polarized in one direction, according to the orientation of the
cilia’s basal feet and the 9×2+2 tubules content (Budelmann et al.,
1997). The cells are primary sensory hair cells and their axons run
underneath them (Sundermann, 1983).

The effects of sound on the functionality and the physiology of
the cephalopods statocyst, as a consequence of an exposure to
artificial noise, are reviewed in previous publications (André et al.,
2011; Solé et al., 2013a,b, 2017). However, despite some referencesReceived 28 February 2018; Accepted 2 August 2018

in the literature on the effects of sound exposure on the lateral lines
of fish, no mention could be found of the analogous lateral line of
cephalopods. The lateral line system of fish consists of a set of
receptors, located at the body surface, which detect water motion
close to the fish. The lateral line has been shown to be important to
predatory fish in locating prey and to prey fish in mediating escape
behaviour (Coombs and Montgomery, 1999). Although Hastings
et al. (1996) suggested there were no effects on sensory cells of the
lateral line of Astronotus ocellatus after sound exposure, Denton and
Gray (1993) showed that mechanical stimulation of the lateral line of
clupeids may cause damage by decoupling the cupulae from the
neuromasts (sensory structures with hair cells) of the lateral line. A
loss of the attachment between the cupula and the neuromast would
result in a dysfunction of the lateral line system.
Data on the effects of sound on fish larva are very scarce as well.

Kostyuchenko (1973) reported damage on neuromasts of the lateral
line system in cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic herring (Clupea
harengus) larva under seismic air-gun sound exposure. Booman
et al. (1996) investigated the effects of seismic air guns on eggs and
larva in different marine species (Atlantic cod, herring, saithe).
These authors also described damage to neuromasts of the lateral
line system and other organ systems. Advanced studies adressing
the effects of sound on the lateral line in fishes and cephalopods,
specially on larvae are necessary.
Here, we conducted controlled exposure experiments on the

Mediterranean S. officinalis, L. vulgaris and I. coindetii hatchlings
to look at potential effects of sound overexposure on the ciliated
primary sensory hair cells in both the epidermal lines and in the
statocyst of the three species.

RESULTS
Structural andultrastructural analysisof theepidermal lines’
sensory epithelium
As shown in the literature, S. officinalis hatchlings display eight
epidermal lines on their head, two dorsally- and two laterally-
positioned lines, which continue on the arms. There are an
additional pair of L5 short lines on the ventral side of the head
and a band of ciliated cells on the ventral funnel surface (Fig. 1).
The whole body of L. vulgaris hatchlings presented a variety of

hair structures, many of them related to sensory function (Fig. S2).
In addition to the epidermal lines (Fig. S2A–E), the animals
exhibited rows of hair cell lines covering the mantle (Fig. S2H–J).
Additional highly developed structures (olfactory organs) were
visible on these individuals (Fig. S2F,G).
This study shows the first published images of the epidermal lines

of I. coindetii paralarvae (Fig. 2). The epidermal lines, which present
the same distribution as other decapodiforme species [Fig. S1B (Lenz
et al., 1995), i.e. five pairs of bilaterally symmetrical lines in the head
and arms, and an additional unique line on the ventral funnel surface],
are highly dense and reveal different kinocilia distribution and density
on the hair cells (Fig. 2A–G).
As in L. vulgaris hatchlings, the animals exhibited hair structures

covering the whole mantle (Fig. 2H,I). In this case, the hair cells are
distributed in bundles over the whole surface (Fig. 2H,I). Additional
highly developed structures (lip chemoreceptors) were visible on
these individuals (Fig. 2G).

The effects of sound on the epidermal line sensory epithelium
Just after sound exposure (Figs 1E–F; 3C–E; 4C,H–J), in
comparison with the same tissues from control animals (Figs 1A–
D; 3A,B; 4A,B,E), damage was systematically observed on the
epidermal lines by SEM analysis. Zones previously occupied by

hair cells exhihited damage in the epithelium. Some hair cells had
dramatically lost almost all kinocilia and the remaining kinocilia
were bent and flaccid or fused (Figs 1E–F; 3C–E; 4C,H,J). In some
cases the kinocilia on the bundles show blebs as a consequence of
sound exposure (Fig. 4I).

In S. officinalis hatchlings euthanised at 24 h, the same lesions
described above were found with an increase in the severity of
expression (Fig. 1G–H). In most samples from L. vulgaris and
I. coindetii hatchlings euthanised 24 h after sound exposure (80%
and 90% respectively) (Figs 3F,G; 4D,F,G), the epidermal lines
showed a healthy appearance with upright kinocilia on the hair cells
arrangements, although some hair cells exhibited fused kinocilia
(Fig. 3F).

Structural and ultrastructural analysis of the statocyst
sensory epithelium
As described in adult animals, hatchlings of S. officinalis present
two statocyst inner sensory systems. The macula-statolith system
(gravity receptor system) of the two statocyst cavities is divided into
three subunits [macula statica princeps (msp), superior macula
neglecta (smn) and inferior macula neglecta (imn)] (Fig. S3).
Equally, the crista-cupula system (angular acceleration receptor)
shows four rows of different sizes of sensory hair cells (Fig. S3H,I).

The largest unit (msp) of the macula-statolith system is visible in
L. vulgaris hatchlings (Fig. S4). The crista-cupula system (angular
acceleration receptor) is also composed of four rows of different
hair-cell types (Fig. S4H,I).

This study shows the first published images of statocyst inner
morphology in I. coindetii paralarvae (Fig. 5). Here, as opposed to
adult animals, only the largest unit (msp) of the macula-statolith
system is present in L. vulgaris hatchlings (Fig. 5A,D). The
epithelium of the crista-cupula system shows only one row of hair
cells, versus the normal distribution of four rows normally seen in
adult specimens (Fig. 5B,C).

The effect of sound on the statocyst sensory epithelium
In all samples of S. officinalis and I. coindetii hatchlings, crista
epithelium showed obvious signs of damage, including bent
kinocilia and cellular material extrusion after exposure to sound.
The epithelium was fractured in-between some of the four rows that
integrate the crista epithelium. Some hair cells had their apical poles
partially, or totally extruded (Fig. S3J; Fig. 5C). No lesions were
detected in the smaller subunits of the macula-statolith system (smn
and imn, Fig. S3D–G) in S. officinalis.

In comparison with the same tissues from control animals
(Figs 6A–B; 7A–B; 5A,D,E), damage was systematically observed
in the msp by SEM analysis, just after sound exposure (Figs 6C, 7C,
5F). Some hair cells had totally lost their kinocilia or showed bent,
flaccid or fused kinocilia and a large number of hair cells had their
apical pole extruded above the sensory epithelium into the statocyst
cavity, and the expulsion of the cellular material left holes in the
base of hair cells (Figs 6C, 7C, 5F).

In animals euthanised 24 h after sound exposure (Figs 6D–F, 7D,
5G) the same lesions described above were found with an increase
in their severity.

See Table S1 for a summary description of the observed effects
on the different sensory systems and species.

Quantification and data analysis
In the three species, the number of damaged cells (extruded and
missing hair cells) increased with time in the statocyst msp sensory
epithelium (Fig. 8A). The presence of extruded cells showed the

start of severe damage after sound exposure. In the lateral line
sensory epithelium, the damage increased with time in the case of S.
officinalis hatchlings; however, in the other two species, after the
initial increase in the lesions in comparison with control animals,
the severity of the lesions decreased with time (Fig. 8B). Their
severity was quantified as a number of damaged cells compared to
control specimens. The deviation in damage was tested (Wilcoxon

rank sum test) in control animals at 0 h and twice at 24 h, as well as
recovery if the damage at 0 h was higher than at 24 h. The P values
were all either very close to 0 or to 1 and are given below.

Test 1: difference between control and exposed individuals
In all cases, the severity of the lesion between control animals and
exposed individuals observed at 0 h differed significantly for both

epithelia (the medians were not equal to the median of the macula/
lateral line control at 0 h, P<0.001). We conclude that statocyst and
lateral line sensory epithelia were affected by exposure to sound in
the three species.

Test 2: difference in numbers between individuals observed
at 0 h and 24 h after exposure
The quantification analysis showed that the severity of the lesions,
which were quantified as the number of extruded/missing hair cells,
increased with time for the three species (Fig. 8A). In all cases, after
performing statistical tests, the lesions in the msp after 24 h were not
significantly less than at 0 h (the macula did not show more damage
at 0 h, P=1.000).
Regarding the differences in the lateral line sensory epithelia,

we obtained different results depending on the species. In the case
of S. officinalis the lesion number in the lateral line after 24 h was
not significantly lower than at 0 h (the lateral line did not show
more damage at 0 h, P=1.000). In the cases of L. vulgaris and
I. coindetii, the lesion number in the lateral line after 24 h was

significantly lower than at 0 h (P<0.001). For these cases, the
lesion number at 24 h was tested against the control and was found
to be significantly different (the median of the lateral line control
was not found to be equal, P<0.001). We conclude that in
S. officinalis hatchlings there was an increase in the severity of
the lesions with time. The other two species, L. vulgaris and
I. coindetii, presented a decrease in the severity of the lesions with
time in the lateral line sensory epithelium. Despite this decrease in
the severity of the lesions 24 h after sound exposure, there were
still significant differences in the number of lesions compared with
the control animals (P<0.001).

DISCUSSION
Description of hatchling sensory structures
Literature on cephalopod hatchlings and embryonic stadia sensory
systems, including statocyst and lateral line, is scarce [see as a
review, Villanueva and Norman (2008)]. The neural basis of the
ability of some coleoid cephalopods’ embryonic stadia to respond
to a variety of sensory stimuli during early development in the

egg capsule was assessed by the analysis of the emergence
sensory structures within the developing epidermis (Buresi et al.,
2014). Lateral lines and statocyst structures seem to be present
from the initial stadia of the developmental process (Buresi et al.,
2014), highlighting their fundamental role in the animal’s
survival.
In addition, some typical ciliated structures that are not linked to

sound perception (e.g. chemoreceptors) such as the olfactory organ
with high cilia density that is located near the funnel in Loligo
paralarvae, were visible on all groups of samples. No lesions
were visible there. The early differentiation of the olfactory organ
(Fig. S2F,G) in L. vulgaris hatchlings and the peculiar development
of the epidermis together with its sensory cells allow comparing
developmental processes within the molluscs phylum (Buresi et al.,
2014; Polese et al., 2016). These results confirm that the statocyst
and the lateral line sensory epithelia are specialised in sound
perception, and thus can suffer acoustic trauma when exposed to

loud sound sources while the other observed sensory epithelia are
not affected.

The distribution of epidermal lines in I. coindetii paralarvae is
very similar to other described decapodiforme species such as
Sepiola affinis [Fig. S1B (Lenz et al., 1995)], S. officinalis and
L. vulgaris (five pairs of bilaterally symmetrical lines in head
and arms, and an additional unique line on the ventral funnel
surface).The epidermal lines present different kinocilia distribution
and density in the hair cells. The animals exhibited bundles of hair
cells covering the mantle surface.

We showed in I. coindetii, additional sensory ciliated structures
like lip chemoreceptors (Fig. 2); ciliated receptors and sensory cells
are also described on the finger-like papillae that distally fold the
muscular lip around the beaks in O. joubini (Emery, 1975).
Although their presence in octopus paralarvae has not yet been
described (Villanueva and Norman, 2008) we were able to identify
them in I. coindetii (Fig. 2).

On the other hand, the inner sensory epithelia of the I. coindetii
statocyst was also shown for the first time (Fig. 5). In contrast with
S. officinalis (Fig. S3) and L. vulgaris (Fig. S4) hatchlings that
exhibit all the inner statocyst sensory structures present on adult
individuals, I. coindetii shows only the largest unit of the macula–
statolith system (msp) and a short row of hair cells on the crista
epithelium. Compared to the other two hatchling species studied
here, which – as is found in adults – present four rows of different
types of hair cells on the crista epithelium, in I. coindetii paralarvae
statocyst, only one row of scarce, sensory hair cells is visible
(Fig. 5B,C). This feature is probably due to the fact that the
hatchlings of I. coindetii are still in early larval stages and will
evolve a greater number of more complex structures later in their
development.

Effects of sound on hatchling statocyst
In previous studies, it was shown that the exposure to sound resulted
in permanent and substantial alterations of the sensory epithelia of
the statocysts. This morphological and ultrastructural evidence of
massive acoustic trauma was assessed in adult individuals of four
cephalopod species subjected to low-frequency controlled-exposure
experiments in laboratory (André et al., 2011; Solé et al., 2013a,b)
and offshore (Solé et al., 2017) conditions. Few studies summarize
the effects of the external environmental events on statocyst of

cephalopod hatchlings (Zumholz et al., 2007; Colmers et al., 1984;
Kaplan et al., 2013). Some results (Colmers et al., 1984; Kaplan
et al., 2013) reported behavioural effects characterized by the
inability to control orientation while swimming, caused by the
abnormalities of the statocyst neuroepithelial suprastructures
(absence or malformation of statolith or cupula) as a consequence
of environmental causes (temperature and chemical composition of
the sea water, rearing systems, genetic causes, ocean acidification)
(Colmers et al., 1984; Villanueva, 2000; Hanlon et al., 1989;
Zumholz et al., 2007; Kaplan et al., 2013). This study provides the
first analysis of the effects of sound on inner epithelia of statocyst
and lateral line structures in Cephalopod hatchlings.

In the hatchling cephalopod species, lesions were described in the
macula statica princeps and crista, both statocyst inner sensory
epithelia. The effects of sound exposure on the statocyst epithelia
summarized here are similar to previous results (André et al., 2011;
et al., 2013a,b, 2017) in adult cephalopod specimens: bending,
flaccid fused or lost kinocilia, cellular material extrusion, some hair
cells had their apical poles partially or totally extruded above the
sensory epithelium. However, these lesions presented a different
incremental severity over time, since in hatchlings we quantified a
similar effect as found in adults after 48 h, almost immediately after
exposure. Regenerative processes potentially due to cell division
and/or differentiation were not observed, similarly to what was

found in adult cephalopod statocyst sensory epithelia euthanised
after 96 h after sound exposure (Solé et al., 2013a).

Effect of sound on hatchling lateral lines
Although fish lateral lines are shown to act as displacement
detectors and are potentially stimulated by particle motion
components of sound sources (Higgs and Radford, 2013), the
capacity of cephalopods to sense local water movements is still
under discussion. In 1928, Naef (1928) first mentioned 4–5 pairs of
regularly arranged lines of epidermal cells on the head and on the
arms of embryonic cephalopods. Sundermann (1983) described
these cells as ciliated sensory cells and Budelmann et al. (1991)
demonstrated that these lines of cells served to detect small water
movements. These analogue lateral lines are involved in prey and
predator detection.
While the controls showed no lesions in the epidermal lines, all

the exposed individuals displayed acoustic trauma, but its evolution
over time was different depending on the species. In L. vulgaris and
I. coindetii paralarvae, the damage was observed in the epidermal
lines immediately after exposure. A high number of hair cells had
lost kinocilia or presented fused, bent and flaccid kinocilia. But, in
contrast with what was observed in statocyst structures, in the

paralarvae epidermal lines lesions were not gradually more
pronounced after 24 h. Surprisingly, some randomly distributed
areas of the epidermal lines of the exposed animals showed high cell
density. We could only find fused kinocilia that remained in some
hair cells even 24 h after sound exposure.

In S. officinalis juveniles, damage was also observed in the
epidermal lines immediately after exposure. A high number of hair
cells had lost kinocilia or presented fused, bent and flaccid kinocilia
and the lesions in the juveniles epidermal lines were gradually more
pronounced in individuals after 24 h as in the case of the statocyst
lesions. The different evolution in S. officinalis juveniles and
L. vulgaris and I. coindetii paralarvae could be due to the different
sizes of hatchlings from the three species, which would correspond
to different live stages and strategies. The larger size of cuttlefish
hatchlings is consistent with the fact that cuttlefish become a benthic
species immediately after hatching, whereas the other two species
present a planktonic phase before they sufficiently grow to become
juveniles. These differences may involve changes in the typology of
the lesions produced by noise impact due to variations in sound
perception in different water layers.

In the avian cochlea and vestibular organs, and in the vestibular
organ of mammals, post-traumatic hair cell regeneration was shown

to occur after either acoustic trauma or drug poisoning, when
apoptosis is not involved (Corwin and Cotanche, 1988). Several
mechanisms are believed to be involved in such regeneration,
including proliferation followed by differentiation of non-sensory
epithelial cells, direct transdifferentiation of supporting cells into
hair cells, and reparation of damaged hair cells. In the sameway, fish
are capable of regenerating sensory hair cells in the inner ear after
acoustic trauma (Schuck and Smith, 2009). Mechanosensory hair
cells within zebrafish larvae and other fish species’ lateral lines
spontaneously regenerate after being damaged or destroyed by
acoustic or ototoxic exposure (Ma et al., 2008; Mackenzie and
Raible, 2012; Monroe et al., 2015). These processes generally occur
within one to several weeks after the hair cells’ death. In the present
study, the survival time of individuals was no more than 24 h
following the sound exposure, which is too short a period of time to
observe possible regenerative processes due to cell proliferation.
This survival time was not related to the exposure to sound, but to
the food reserve limit that the hatchling receives from its vitelline
sac. The present results cannot state, therefore, whether the exposure
to sound induced permanent lesions in the exposed individuals.

These results constitute a basis for future research to determine
whether some of the epidermal lines are more sensitive than others
to sound, and this could also be linked to the mechano-reception
role of these sensory organs versus their sensitivity to acoustic
pressure.

Critical periods of susceptibility to acoustic trauma in
cephalopod hatchlings
Previous experimental studies onmammals (Lenoir et al., 1979, 1986;
Uziel, 1985) and birds (Cousillas and Rebillard, 1985) demonstrated
critical periods of increased susceptibility to acoustic trauma in young
animals. During such critical periods, the same sound exposure
appears to be more traumatic in young animals than in adults (Falk
et al., 1974; Price, 1976; Jensen et al., 2015). These critical periods
generally coincide with the last stages of cochlear anatomical
development, when the organ has just acquired its adult functional
properties level (Lenoir et al., 1979; Uziel, 1985; Lenoir and Pujol,
1980). During such periods of increased sensitivity to sound, noise
exposure can damage the cochlea at physiological and histological
levels (Lenoir et al., 1979, 1986; Lenoir and Pujol, 1980).

The anatomical damage in the hair cells of young avian basilar
papilla is similar to those classically described in the literature
regarding adult birds (Saunders and Tilney, 1982) – absence
of cilia, disorganization of their structure, reduction in size of
cuticular plates, enlargement of supporting cells, presence of
sensory cells with giant cuticular plate, growth of microvilli on the
cuticular plate – and outer hair cells in the cochlea of
mammals (Hunter-Duvar, 1977; Robertson and Johnstone,
1980). In chicks, the developmental change seems to end at
post-natal day 1, which also corresponds to the end of the
anatomical and functional maturation of the basilar papilla
(Cousillas and Rebillard, 1985).

The present results of the lateral line and statocyst of cephalopod
hatchlings showed similar anatomical effects after sound exposure.
All exposed cephalopod hatchlings displayed acoustic trauma, but
its evolution over time was different depending on the species.
L. vulgaris and I. coindetii paralarvae presented a high number of
hair cells that had lost kinocilia or presented fused, bent and flaccid
kinocilia in lateral line and statocyst immediately after sound
exposure. While statocyst anatomy showed an increase in damage
with time, the lateral line did not follow the same pattern 24 h after
sound exposure. According to the literature on mammals and birds,
we can hypothesize a similar critical period of susceptibility to
acoustic trauma for the L. vulgaris and I. coindetii paralarvae lateral

lines that would not continue after hatching. But, as in these two
species, the lesions in the statocyst structures were more
pronounced after 24 h, thus we can suppose that the critical
period of susceptibility to sound does not coincidewith time. These

results point to a major susceptibility of the statocyst, possibly
due to a later completion of the anatomical differentiation of
the statocyst structures, consistent with its greater structural
complexity.

In S. officinalis juveniles, statocyst and lateral line structural
damage was observed immediately and the lesions were gradually
more pronounced 24 h after sound exposure. The larger size of
cuttlefish hatchlings and their benthic stage would indicate a higher
level of development in this species, which would be consistent with
their potentially complete anatomical differentiation during the
embryonic phase, prior to hatching. This could be responsible for
the different evolution in the anatomical damage that is more
consistent with the evolution of the effects on sensory epithelia
in adults.

Conclusion
Our study devised a novel approach to quantify and compare damage
in the sensory systems responsible for acoustic perception (statocyst
and lateral lines) in cephalopod hatchlings, by examining hair cells,
which enabled meaningful comparison across a broad number of
samples. In particular, our estimate of the proportional damage to
the whole hair-cell surface provided a general idea as to the
mechanoreceptor’s sensitivity and allowed the first qualitative and
quantitative analysis of sound-exposure damaged sensory epithelia in
cephalopod hatchlings. Our results indicate an increase in the severity
of the lesions in the statocyst sensory epithelia with time, common to
all species. In hatchlings the severity of these lesions was shown to
increase much faster than in adults, but due to the limited survival
time of the studied individuals (related to the vitelline sac reserve) we
could not properly assess the consequence of these lesions with their
capacity to grow over time. Nevertheless, if we relate this acoustic
trauma to what was observed in adults, who stopped eating and
breeding after sound exposure, it is likely that hatchlings exposed to
noise could not eat properly and would eventually die.
On the other hand, the different evolution of the sound exposure

damage in the lateral line of S. officinalis juveniles and L. vulgaris
and I. coindetii paralarvae could be explained by the different life
styles and size of hatchlings, corresponding to different life stages.
In addition, this difference in damage evolution could be associated
with critical periods of enhanced sensitivity for acoustic trauma;
linked to the end of the anatomical and functional maturation of
their sensory structures, as reported in the mammalian cochlea and
avian basilar papilla. It is therefore essential to better understand
the sensory-structure development phases in these species to link
them to possible critical periods of supranormal susceptibility to
acoustic trauma.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cephalopod individuals
Hatchlings of S. officinalis, L. vulgaris and I. coindetii were used in this
study. S. officinalis and L. vulgaris eggs were obtained by local fishermen
from the Catalan coast (north-west Mediterranean Sea). I. coindetii
hatchlings were obtained from the Institute of Marine Sciences (CSIC)
installations, from experiments described by Villanueva et al. (2011) using
in vitro fertilization techniques. All hatchlings were kept in a closed system
of recirculating natural seawater (at 18–20°C, salinity 35 and natural oxygen
pressure). Some of these hatchlings were used as controls and were kept in
the same conditions as the experimental animals until we exposed the latter
to noise in an independent tank, euthanizing them following the same
sequential process as with the sound-exposed group.

Ethics
The experimental protocol strictly complied with the current ethical and
welfare considerations when dealing with cephalopods in scientific
experimentation (Moltschaniwskyj et al., 2007; Fiorito et al., 2015). This
process was also carefully analysed and approved by the Ethical Committee
for Scientific Research of the Technical University of Barcelona,
BarcelonaTech (UPC).

Sound exposure protocol
The eggs were kept in a rearing tank until they hatched, which ranged from a
few hours to a few weeks, the protocol then included exposing the
experimental individuals to sound. Sequential controlled exposure
experiments (CEE) were conducted on hatchlings of S. officinalis (n=80),
L. vulgaris (n=80) and I. coindetii (n=40). An additional set of the same
number of hatchlings of the same species were used as control and
sequentially processed (same procedure as with noise-exposed individuals)
right after being hatched, before and after the CEE. The exposure consisted of
a 50–400 Hz sinusoidal wave sweeps with 100% duty cycle and a 1 s sweep
period for 2 h. The sweep was produced and amplified through an in-air
loudspeaker while the level received was measured by a calibrated B&K 8106
hydrophone (RL=157±5 dB re 1 μPa with peak levels up to SPL=175 dB re
1 μPa). The euthanasia process was identical for controls and exposed
animals. After the exposure, the individuals not euthanised immediately were
placed in a maintenance tank [see tank characteristics in Solé et al. (2013a)
and André et al. (2016)]. The independent experimental tank was located in a
separate location, acoustically isolated from themaintenance tanks. Following
exposure, the samples were obtained from the individuals (exposed and
controls) at 0 h and 24 h after sound exposure and were processed for routine
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) procedures.

Imaging techniques
In all experiments, half of the total number of individuals were used for
analysing the statocyst and the other half were devoted to the lateral line
analysis. For the statocyst analysis, isolated head preparations were obtained
by decapitation. The hatchling heads with opened statocyst were fixed for
observation and analysis. For fixation, the statocyst cavity was opened and
special carewas taken to prevent mechanical damage to the inner tissues. For
the lateral line analysis, the whole body was fixed and processed according
to routine SEM procedures. At this step, some light microscopy images were
obtained to clarify the sensorial hatchling sensory structures.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
80 statocysts of S. officinalis, 80 of L. vulgaris and 40 of I. coindetii from the
following hatchling exposed specimens were used in this study: 40
S. officinalis (mantle length 1–1.25 cm), 40 L. vulgaris (mantle length
2–3 mm), 20 I. coindetii (mantle length 1.3–1.5 mm), in addition to the
whole body (the two lateral line L1 were observed) of 40 S. officinalis
(mantle length 1–1.25 mm), 40 L vulgaris (mantle length 2–3 mm), and 20
I. coindetii (mantle length 1.3–1.5 mm). One half of the total number of
individuals were euthanised at 0 h and the rest at 24 h after sound exposure.
The same number of statocysts from exposed and control animals were fixed
and processed for the analysis. Fixation was performed in 2.5%
glutaraldehyde for 24–48 h at 4°C. Hatchling heads and whole body
samples were dehydrated in graded alcohol solutions and critical-point dried
with liquid carbon dioxide in a Leica CPD030 unit (Leica Microsystems,
Vienna, Austria). The dried samples were mounted on specimen stubs with
double-sided tape. The mounted tissues were gold-palladium coated with a
Q150R5 sputter coated unit (Quorum Technologies, Ltd., Laughton, UK)
and viewed with a variable pressure Hitachi S3500N scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at an
accelerating voltage of 5 kV at the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM) of the
Spanish Research Council (CSIC) facilities.

Quantification and data analysis
We considered, for the quantification of the lesions on lateral lines, the
region comprising the sensory area of the pair of lateral lines L1. Between
the different lateral lines that compose the system we chose this structure
because its dorso-central position allowed us the best visualization of the
sensory epithelium.

For the quantification of the inner statocyst epithelia (although we
observed the presence of lesions on other inner statocyst epithelia, like
crista) we only considered the region including the whole sensory area of the
macula statica princeps. This structure was chosen because it represents
the largest subunit of the macula-statolith system, and due to its anterior
location and relative flat structure, it appeared to be the best to visualise the
sensory epithelium. Finally, the generally small size of this structure in

cephalopod hatchlings allowed us to quantify lesions on the whole surface
of the macula.

Although we observed the presence of abnormal features on the
surface of sound-exposed epithelia (e.g. bundle of kinocilia partially or
entirely missing, bent or fused) as well as differences in hair cell
appearance, hair cell damage was quantified by classifying the hair cells
as intact (hair cell undamaged) or extruded/missing (hair cell partially or
totally extruded of the epithelium/hole in the epithelium caused by the
total extrusion of the hair cell) because these are well-defined categories
and easier to compare. The presence of extruded cells determined our
threshold of a severe lesion after sound exposure. For all animals, the
lesions were assessed for both macula statica princeps and the two lateral
L1 lines. The lesions were measured as the number of extruded or
missing cells divided by the number of total cells on the inspected
surface. The two measurements per system, per animal, were then
averaged for statistical tests, resulting in 20 values for the macula
and lateral line of the S. officinalis and L. vulgaris and 10 values
for I. coindetii (for each system, statocyst and lateral line).

For each area/species/sample we had extruded/missing cell count/area
and total cell count/area values. For these two, counts were divided to
compute the ratio of missing cells. We had two ratios per animal, these were
averaged. We then used rank sum tests (standard Matlab command, either
one- or two-tailed depending on testing for difference only, or difference in a
specific direction) to test the means. P-values were rounded to two decimals.

The data (Table S2) in general did not follow normal distributions (tested
with Anderson-Darling) and a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon rank sumwith
\alpha=0.05) was selected to explore a change in lesions after sound
exposure. Two tests were performed, one to test for a difference in lesions
between control and exposed animals at 0 h, and one to test changes in the
lesions ratio after 24 h.
