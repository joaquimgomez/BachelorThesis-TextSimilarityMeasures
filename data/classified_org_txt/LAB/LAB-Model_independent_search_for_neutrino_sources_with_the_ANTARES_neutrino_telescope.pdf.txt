1. Introduction 

Since the recent discovery of a diffuse high-energy astrophysical

neutrino flux by the IceCube Collaboration [1–3] , neutrino astron-

omy has established itself as a new discipline. Due to the statistical

limitations implied by a new observational tool that has just over-

come its initial detection threshold, the spectral and spatial prop-

erties of the discovered flux are still not well constrained. 

The high-energy starting event (HESE) analysis [2] , which is

most sensitive to the Southern sky but has a poor spatial reso-

lution, measures a best-fit diffuse signal of dN ν / dE ∝ E � with � =
−2 . 5 [4] . The flux observed from the Northern Sky with a higher
energy threshold of about 200 TeV in the muon channel exhibits a

harder spectral index of about � = −2 . 13 ± 0 . 13 [5] . 
A first analysis has shown that the spatial distribution of HESE

events is consistent with an isotropic distribution [6] . 

While there seems to be some evidence for an excess at low

galactic latitudes [7] , favouring a galactic contribution with a softer

spectrum and an extragalactic contribution with a harder spectrum

[8] , the origin of the various contributions remains open. 

Several analyses with the goal to reveal the origin of the astro-

physical neutrinos have been performed. Time-integrated searches

for point-like and extended bright sources by ANTARES [9] , Ice-

Cube [10] as well as a joint search [11] exclude the possibility that

the flux can be generated by a small number of bright sources. A

rst search employing a two-point correlation function with data

rom the ANTARES neutrino telescope [12] has neither found sig-

ificant deviations from isotropy in the full-sky neutrino distribu-

ion nor shown evidence for correlations with catalogues of various

strophysical objects. Likewise a two-point correlation and multi-

ole analysis of IceCube skymaps confirmed that the assumption of

 small number of bright sources is excluded [13] . Therefore, a dis-

ribution of many faint point-like or unexpected extended sources

onstitutes a promising hypothesis at this stage. 

ANTARES [14] is the largest operational neutrino telescope

n the Northern Hemisphere, located in the Mediterranean Sea

42 ◦48’N, 6 ◦10’E) at a depth of 2475 m. Due to its location, it
ainly observes the Southern sky in the upgoing muon channel

nd provides an excellent view of the Galactic Centre. Despite its

uch smaller instrumented volume compared to IceCube, it has

n effective area for muon neutrinos which is comparable to that

f the IceCube HESE analysis for energies around 100 TeV and even

urpasses it for energies below about 60 TeV [15] . 

This paper introduces three independent new methods and the

esults obtained with them. The first two algorithms enhance the

ata selection and reconstruction process, while the third is a

ovel analysis method, referred to as multiscale method in the fol-

owing, that uses the arrival directions of upgoing muon neutrinos

ecorded with the ANTARES neutrino telescope in 6 years of data

aking.

limit for the perfect combination of direction reconstruction algorithms. It is the 

performance if for every event the best available single reconstruction was chosen 

and the true angular uncertainty was used for the selection. All performances have 

been evaluated for a neutrino flux following an E −2 energy spectrum. Efficiency is 
defined with respect to all triggered events where at least one direction reconstruc- 

tion succeeded. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,

The goal of this analysis is to identify the most significant, spa-

ially confined excess over the background of atmospheric neutri-

os without relying on assumptions of any emission model of po-

ential neutrino sources. The analysis method is sensitive to a clus-

ering of events in an extended sky region, and its sensitivity in-

reases with the size of the signal region. The multiscale method

oes not rely on any property derived from modelling or simula-

ions, but computes all required estimates from the observed data.

ompared to other searches for potential extended sources, it has

he benefit of not being restricted to a given template. In contrast

o other model-independent searches, like e.g. a two-point corre-

ation analysis, it identifies the region of a dense clustering. The

ethod is designed to yield a first indication of a candidate source

egion significantly deviating from the expected background distri-

ution, but not to provide a detection with maximum significance

r to interpret the nature of a candidate cluster. 

. Data selection and reconstruction 

.1. Signal identification 

In order to distinguish events resulting from genuine neutrinos

rom the background of atmospheric muons that reach the tele-

cope from above and generate about 10 6 times more events, cuts

re placed on the direction reconstruction to select those that are

onsistent with an “upgoing” particle entering the telescope from

elow. 

In this analysis a multivariate classification technique called

Random Decision Forest” (RDF) 1 [17] is used in addition to cuts

n the reconstruction quality to allow for less strict cuts, increas-

ng the available statistics. The RDF operates on variables describ-

ng the topology and timing pattern of the light observed within

NTARES [18] . The output of this algorithm for a recorded event is

n assignment to a predefined class. In this application the classes

re “upgoing” and “downgoing”. The algorithm is trained on Monte

arlo simulations that incorporate the observed time-dependent

ata-taking conditions [19] . To improve the accuracy of the results,

 two-step classification is used, where the first classification re-

ects only clearly downgoing signatures, while the second step is

rained specifically to filter out those atmospheric muon events

hat generate patterns similar to the desired upgoing muon neu-

rinos. This technique reaches a rejection rate of 99.85% ± 0.12% for

owngoing atmospheric muons while preserving 81.7% ± 1.3% of all
harged current muon neutrino events (all numbers with respect

o all triggered events, calculated for a spectrum following E −2 . 0 ).
ompared to a single stage RDF classification with a similar effi-

iency for upgoing neutrino events it reduces atmospheric muons

y a factor of 20. Fig. 1 shows the efficiency for upgoing muon

eutrinos as a function of the neutrino energy. The classification

.2. Direction reconstruction 

A novel method called “Selectfit” is used to reconstruct the

irection of neutrino candidates. Instead of applying one recon-

truction algorithm for all neutrino candidates, Selectfit combines

he results of multiple direction reconstruction algorithms, aim-

ing to select the most precise result for each event. It combines

four reconstruction algorithms previously used by ANTARES [20–

22] . While the reconstruction schemes of the algorithms that are

combined are similar, each algorithm performs best for a differ-

ent energy range or has different prerequisites for a successful re-

construction, allowing Selectfit to improve the overall result. The

selection is again performed by a Random Decision Forest using

the reconstruction results (zenith and azimuth angle) as well as

all available quality-related output parameters of the considered

reconstruction algorithms as input variables. It tries to identify

the most accurate reconstruction result. The output class number

hence determines which algorithm is used for an event. 

In order to estimate the accuracy of the reconstruction for each

event in a comparable way, Selectfit cannot just rely on the quality

variable of the chosen algorithm. Instead it combines the results

and quality parameters of all considered algorithms using a RDF.

The output of this second RDF are classes corresponding to bins of

angular error ( < 0.1 ◦, < 0.2 ◦, < 0.4 ◦, < 0.8 ◦, ...). 
As illustrated in Fig. 2 , Selectfit either allows the angular error

for a sample of neutrinos to be reduced or it can be used to in-

crease the sample size for a given angular error. It increases the

available statistics by at least 11% for any given accuracy. The ben-

efit for small angular errors is mainly due to the improved esti-

mation of the angular error, whereas for less accurate reconstruc-
ions, the main benefit results from the event-wise selection from

he four reconstruction methods [18] . 

Since a search for extended sources does not necessarily require

he same angular precision as a point source search, a looser cut

n the uncertainty of the reconstruction is applied. For a flux of

uon neutrinos with an energy spectrum of E −2 these cuts result
n a median angular uncertainty of 0.46 ◦. The cut for this analy-
is was chosen to yield a high statistics sample of muon neutrino

he following section. In Fig. 3 the effective area reached with this

ethod is compared to the effective area obtained with the de-

he looser event selection in this analysis also results in a higher

ackground from misreconstructed atmospheric muons in the final

ample of neutrino candidates (29.7% instead of 10% in [9] ). 

. Model-independent multiscale source search 

The model-independent multiscale source search aims to iden-

ify the region of arbitrary position, size, shape and and distribu-
ion of neutrino events within the region with the most signifi-

ant excess of neutrino events in the sky with respect to the back-

round expectation. 

The method itself 2 is independent from the ANTARES neutrino

elescope or the fact that the analysed data are neutrino candi-

ates. The only assumption made in this method is that the den-

ity of background events at any declination is approximately in-

ependent of the right ascension. Unlike many techniques known

rom image processing, it is designed to operate also on the sparse

dataset of neutrinos. While many other fields of astronomy can op-

erate on image-like measurements, these neutrino data would fill

only very few grid points of a skymap. Hence many methods suc-

cessfully used in other experiments are not applicable here. 

The search method consists of eight subsequent steps applied

to the measured neutrino sky map, described in subsections 3.1–

3.8. These steps have been defined such that they are independent

from assumptions on signal topology or spectrum. They implement

measures to suppress background and reduce fluctuations, to iden-

tify regions that stick out from the background, and to determine

topology and significance of a possible signal. They are the result

of an extensive investigation and optimisation of different methods

and options, as described in [18] . Since the resulting algorithm is

highly complex and not targeted at a specific signal configuration,

however, it is impossible to explore whether it is optimal in the

full phase space of all possible analysis methods. 

Compared to the standard ANTARES point-source searches [23] ,

the multiscale method has been estimated to require a typically

20–100% higher neutrino flux in order to make an equally sig-

nificant discovery for a point source, depending on the assumed

source spectrum. However, these previous searches all target spe-

cific hypotheses of neutrino production and are not designed to

detect unexpected sources or distributions of sources. 

3.1. The search grid 

In the first step a spherical grid is defined that allows for de-

scribing the sky map in terms of sets of integers assigned to the

grid points (see subsequent steps). The distance of adjacent grid

points is chosen to be 0.5 ◦, commensurate with the angular reso-
lution of reconstructed neutrino-induced muon tracks in ANTARES

(see Fig. 2 ). The grid consists of 165016 grid points. Figs. 4 –6 show

the spherical grid, with grid points in blue and 120 0 0 randomly

generated neutrino events in white. This number of neutrinos is

close to the expectation for the data analysis and they are dis-

tributed according to the visibility of ANTARES. In order to bet-

ter illustrate the steps of the analysis method, two artificial point

sources with 12 and 18 events, respectively, have been added at a

declination of −70 ◦, see Figs. 6 and 7 . 

3.2. Counting 

In this step, a set of integers is determined for each grid point

by counting the neutrino events located in rings of different radii
round that point; these integers will be analysed in the following

sing Poissonian statistics. The inner ring radius is referred to as

he search scale , while the outer radius is 0.5 ◦ larger. The search
valuates 180 scales, i.e. 180 different regions with increasing an-

ular radius from 0 ◦ up to 90 ◦ in steps of 0.5 ◦. This choice yields
ensitivity to source regions up to an extension of twice the maxi-

al search scale, i.e. 180 ◦. The counting is performed for each grid
oint and for each search scale. The results are stored on an in-

ependent spherical grid for each search scale. A visualisation of

he counting scheme is depicted in Fig. 8 . For three scales the re-

ults for the example from Fig. 6 are shown in Fig. 9 . Note that,

nless stated otherwise, in these and all following similar figures,

he colour code is readjusted between the different scales to match

he full range of values present on each sphere. 

.3. Poisson probabilities 

Poissonian probabilities P ( N , λ) are now used to infer a mea-
ure for the probability that the event numbers N from the previ-

us step exceed the background expectation. The expected mean

umber λ for each grid point is estimated by pseudo-experiments
sing scrambled events. The scrambling is achieved by randomly

huffling the event times before converting from local to equato-

ial coordinates. This results in randomised distributions that pre-

erve the characteristics of the actual data taking, for instance the

istribution of the declinations or the efficiency of the data taking

ersus time. From the P ( N , λ), the parameter

s calculated. Subsequently, a low-pass filter 3 is applied to the Q

alues on the spheres to reduce the influence of statistical fluctu-

tions. These smoothed Q values are called R and serve as input

or the next step. The search spheres after these computations are

hown in Fig. 10 . 

.4. Segmentation I 

The next step aims to focus on potentially relevant informa-

ion and to remove background fluctuations. In general, this task,

ere it is performed using a simple threshold θ . Values below the
hreshold, e.g. less pronounced fluctuations, are set to zero. The

hreshold θ is derived and applied for each search scale indepen-
ently, based on the histogram of the R values calculated for this

cale. Fig. 11 illustrates the details how the threshold is obtained.

hile multiple other options to determine a threshold from the

istogram would be possible, no method could be identified to be

ignificantly better than the others. 

The outcome of this step at a grid point p is given by:

he resulting S maps after the segmentations are shown in Fig. 12 .

.5. Remapping 

The S maps clearly show indications of the signal, but in a re-

ocalised way – for example, point sources are mapped to circles

ith the radius corresponding to the search scale. The next step

s to reconstruct the original location of the neutrinos that caused

he remaining high values of S on the spheres. Since the values for

 given search scale d originate from neutrinos that are between

 and d + 0 . 5 ◦ away from the grid points where the values are
tored, the following approach is used: let Set p be the set of N p 
rid points with a distance between d and d + 0 . 5 ◦ around a grid

This step maps the information back to all potential origins, mean-

ing all grid points where the neutrinos contributing to the value

could have been located. Results of these computations are shown

in Fig. 13 . A higher density in the original neutrino distribution is

now encoded in the overlapping pattern of the remapped circles

as seen in the middle and bottom pictures of Fig. 13 . Note that

the halos around the original source positions are unavoidable ar-

tifacts of this method, which reduce its sensitivity for point-source

searches but less so for extended sources. 

3.6. Summation 

So far, all calculations have been made independently for each

search scale. In order to derive information on size and topology of

potential signal regions without imposing a distance or size scale,

the results for the different search scales need to be combined.

Having evaluated multiple approaches to exploit the information

available in the multitude of scales, a simple sum of the maps as-

signed to all scales of a given spherical grid was found to yield the

most robust evaluation. Since the influence of random fluctuations

is high for the smallest scale, it is not included in this sum. The

input for the final steps is calculated as: 

 p = 
180 ∑ 
i =2 

T p,i , (4)

where the index i denotes the distance scale, given by d = (i − 1) ·
0 . 5 ◦. This index has been omitted in the previous equations as all
computations have been restricted to the same distance scale. The

result of the summation according to Eq. (4) , applied to the full

data set and all scales, can be seen in Fig. 14 . 

3.7. Segmentation II 

A further segmentation is performed to isolate potential signal

regions from background fluctuations. The same procedure which

was used before for the histograms of R values (see Section 3.4 )

is used here for the single histogram of U values. In this step,

however, different thresholds θβ are used, obtained by scaling the
difference between the minimum non-zero value found on the
phere, U min , and θ , the threshold computed as in the previous
egmentations, by a factor β ∈ R : 

β = U min + β(θ − U min ) . (5)
he variable threshold θβ serves to adjust the sensitivity of the
egmentation step. The result of the segmentation using β for each
rid point p is given by: 

 p = 
{

U p , U p ≥ θβ
0 , U p < θβ

(6)

ower values for β result in lower thresholds θβ , allowing more
xtended structures to be found, while higher values only preserve

he high peaks, favouring smaller morphologies. The results are fi-

ally filtered using a two-dimensional median filter 4 to suppress

otential artefacts (e.g. single grid points). The effect of different

hresholds for the segmentation can be seen in Fig. 15 . Choosing

he value of β is the first step in this analysis where an explicit
ias for any source property is included. Based on an evaluation of

 variety of simulated sources, two values are used: β = 0 . 75 and
= 1 . 11 . These values are chosen to be more sensitive to extended

han to small (or point-like) structures. This choice is motivated by

he objective to perform a search that complements the previous,

ocation-independent ANTARES searches for point-like sources [23] .

.8. Significance 

A possible signal of the analysis will manifest itself as a con-

ected group of grid points, all with values above θβ ; such an ob-
ect is called a “cluster”. 

The final step is to distinguish potentially significant clusters

rom random accumulations. Since the exact size, shape, position

nd composition of a cluster is highly unlikely to be reproduced

sing pseudo-experiments, more generic metrics must be used to

valuate the significance of a cluster. Many metrics have been de-

igned and tested on a multitude of simulated sources [18] , each

ith different sensitivities to different sources. No single metric

ouring grid points and itself. 

 

t  

i  
an be maximally sensitive to all potential sources. Motivated by

he focus on extended sources, the metric “clustersize”, given by

he number N c of grid points in a cluster, has been chosen, per-

orming best for extended source topologies. The quantity N c is

ainly correlated wit the size of the signal region. Some informa-

ion on the density of neutrinos within a cluster is nevertheless

etained, because the average value of U in a given cluster, and

ence the cluster size, grows with the neutrino density. 

The significance for a cluster is derived from pseudo-

xperiments with scrambled events as explained in Section 3.3 .

or each threshold θβ the distribution obtained from the pseudo-
xperiments has to be treated independently, as e.g. the distri-

ution of the sizes of clusters depends on the used threshold. A

re-trial p-value and hence a pre-trial significance is computed

or each observed cluster using the corresponding distribution. The

istribution of the values obtained for the metric “clustersize” (in

rid points) for a threshold using β = 0 . 75 is shown in Fig. 16 . An
xponential function a · e bx with free parameters a and b is fitted to
he tail of the distribution. This function is used instead of the his-

ogram if the significance determination would be limited by the

vailable statistics. For each pseudo-experiment, only the highest

re-trial significance of any cluster from any threshold is consid-

red the result of this pseudo-experiment. The post-trial signifi-

ance is then obtained by a comparison of the measured pre-trial

ignificance of an observed cluster with the distribution obtained

rom pseudo-experiments. 

.9. Application to extended sources and general considerations 

To illustrate the behaviour of the method for a simulated ex-

ended source, the configuration shown in Figs. 17 and 18 has been

nvestigated. As shown in Fig. 19 , the location and size of the sim-

ulated signal are approximated reasonably well. For the result ob-

tained with the lower β value, however, additional filaments ex-
tend from the actual shape to regions where random accumula-

tions of background neutrinos occurred. 

The sensitivity of this method for deviations from a homoge-

neous spatial distribution is different compared to previously used

algorithms. For instance, tests with the same simulated pseudo-

experiments showed that the two-point correlation analysis [24] is

more sensitive to scenarios where many faint sources with the

same extension are distributed evenly throughout the sky. On the

other hand, the multiscale search described here is more sensitive

in scenarios that include a spatial clustering of these faint sources.

It also benefits more from the presence of one or more dominant

sources. 

The additional information reported in [18] (pp. 95–98) verify

an important aspect of the method: It only requires an increase in

the number of excess events by a factor of six for an increase of

S  
he signal region from (2 degrees) 2 to (20 degrees) 2 . Since a factor

f ten would be expected for a constant signal-to-noise ratio, it can

e concluded that the multiscale search is most sensitive to large-

cale clusterings and thus has a unique sensitivity characteristic,

learly different from most other search methods. 

More examples of sources, also for asymmetric shapes, and

ore details on the quantitative effect of neighbouring sources can

e found in [18] . 

While the true nature of the sources of high-energy cosmic

eutrinos is still unknown, this algorithm offers a high sensitiv-

ty for a wide range of possible scenarios, including ones in which

any faint sources dominate the observed diffuse flux [25] .

as excluded from the final sample. 

.1. ANTARES 

Using the methods described in Section 2.1 and 2.2 , the eval-

ation of the ANTARES data from 2007 to 2012 results in 13,283

andidates for charged current muon neutrino events, with an ex-

ected number of background neutrinos of 13078 ± 362 (statis-
ical error) from interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere.

his corresponds to a background expectation of 0.634 neutrino
andidates/degree 2 . The multiscale search method described in

ection 3 yields the result shown in Fig. 20 . Using the higher

egmentation threshold β = 1 . 11 , no cluster with a significance
bove 0.8 σ has been found. With β = 0 . 75 a very large structure is
ound. After accounting for all known systematic effects, the large

tructure, called “the cluster” from here on, has a post-trial sig-

ificance of 2.5 σ . The investigation of the systematic effects can
e found in [18] . The size of the cluster is 13,312 connected grid

oints, equivalent to about 3328 degree 2 or 8% of the sky. 

The region contains about 200 events in addition to the about

100 events expected from background. This corresponds to an ex-

ess of 0.06 ± 0.015 neutrino candidates/degree 2 . These numbers

are derived assuming no subclustering within the cluster. Any sub-

clustering (e.g. by embedded smaller clusters) would result in the

same significance for a smaller average neutrino excess density.

This localized event excess would not have been noticed by the

two-point correlation analysis [24] nor the point source analysis

and does not violate the existing bounds and observations from

ANTARES and Icecube on the astrophysical diffuse flux. 

Even if not significant on its own, this structure constitutes an

interesting feature in the data which is worth further studies. It

can be noted that the cluster contains the Galactic Centre, which

is located in the centre of the presented skymaps in galactic coor-

dinates. More details on the inner structure of these clusters can

be seen in Fig. 21 , which shows the result of the summation of

all scales before the segmentations. It should be noted that with

the limited available statistics, random fluctuations do influence
the results. r  
.2. IceCube IC40 

In order to perform an independent cross check of the result

btained using ANTARES data, the publicly available IC40 dataset

26] published by the IceCube Collaboration has also been anal-

sed. This analysis searches specifically for an excess in the area of

he large cluster found in ANTARES data. To achieve this, it only

onsiders clusters found in the IC40 data that overlap with the

NTARES cluster by at least 51% of their area. The value of 51% is

hosen here because this means that they are more related to the

luster from ANTARES than to other regions. On the other hand,

equiring an overlap of close to 100% would exclude e.g. clusters

hat extend beyond the shape of the ANTARES cluster. 

Since the requirement for overlap implicitly confines the size of

he cluster, the clustersize in grid points, N c , is no reasonable met-

ic to assess the significance of a cluster in this evaluation. There-

The result obtained by this adapted search on the IC40 dataset

s shown in Fig. 22 . A cluster is found within the expected shape

ith a post-trial significance of 2.1 σ . The position of the found
luster overlaps with the search template by 78% of its size. 

The observation that not all features in the skymaps in

igs. 21 and 22 match exactly is to be expected, as ANTARES has its

ighest sensitivity at lower energies compared to IceCube. More-

ver, random fluctuations of atmospheric neutrinos do influence

he results. 

. Conclusions 

This paper presents three original and unpublished tools that

ave been used for a search for cosmic neutrino sources of arbi-

rary location and morphology by detecting the most pronounced

eviation from the background-only expectation. The study is fully

ata-driven, without relying on any model for neutrino emission

nd input derived from simulations. 

The first tool (see Section 2.1 ) is a multivariate classification

echnique used to increasing the available statistics of ANTARES

ata. The second (see Section 2.2 ) enhances the directional re-

onstruction of charged-current muon neutrino candidates. The

hird tool is a model-independent multiscale method (described in

ection 3 ) that represents the core of this study. 

Due to the fact that the method is independent of neutrino

mission models or assumptions on the topology of emission re-

ions, this analysis is not intended to discover potential sources

ith the highest achievable significance, nor to analyse the prop-

rties of a candidate source region. Instead, it aims at indicating

he clustering in the data least expected from the background-only

ypothesis and thus to initiate more specific investigations. 

Applied to ANTARES data recorded between 2007 and 2012, this

nalysis found a large structure with a post-trial significance of

.5 σ . This result is consistent with a random fluctuation of the
ackground of atmospheric neutrinos. Using this method to anal-

se public data from IceCube resulted in an excess located within

he overlap between the cluster from the ANTARES data and the

eld of view of IceCube. This observation has a significance of 2.1 σ .
Even though a general, model-independent analysis cannot be

s sensitive as a dedicated search due to the high trial factors, this

ethod provides a good way to become aware of the most promi-

ent and even unforeseen structures in data and can be regarded

s a trigger for more specific investigations. Despite the high trial-

actor, it can outperform standard point-source and two-point cor-

elation analyses in a scenario of unknown extended structures.
