Quantitative radar studies are an important component of studying the movements of 
birds. Whether a bird, at a certain distance from the radar, is detected or not depends 
on its size. The volume monitored by the radar is therefore different for birds of dif-
ferent sizes. Consequently, an accurate quantification of bird movements recorded by 
small-scale radar requires an accurate determination of the monitored volume for the 
objects in question, although this has tended to be ignored.

Here, we demonstrate the importance of sensitivity settings for echo detection on 
the estimated movement intensities of birds of different sizes. The amount of energy 
reflected from a bird and detected by the radar receiver (echo power) depends not only 
on the bird’s size and on the distance from the radar antenna, but also on the beam 
shape and the bird’s position within this beam. We propose a method to estimate the 
size of a bird based on the wingbeat frequency, retrieved from the echo-signal, inde-
pendent of the absolute echo power. The estimated bird-size allows calculation of size-
specific monitored volumes, allowing accurate quantification of movement intensities. 
We further investigate the importance of applying size-specific monitored volumes to 
quantify avian movements instead of using echo counts.

We also highlight the importance of accounting for size-specific monitored volume 
of small scale radar systems, and the necessity of reporting technical information on 
radar parameters. Applying this framework will increase the quality and validity of 
quantitative radar monitoring.

Introduction

The lowest two kilometres of the atmosphere host huge quantities of animal move-
ments, often invisible to the human eye (Liechti and McGuire 2017, Reynolds et al. 
2017), and there is an increasing interest to investigate the function and importance 
of the aerial habitat (Chilson et al. 2017, Bauer et al. 2019). There are several methods 
to monitor the movements of animals in the airspace (Drake and Bruderer 2017),

with radar being the predominant technology when it comes 
to quantifying biomass flows (Chilson  et  al. 2017). Radar 
systems provide an ideal tool to monitor the temporal and 
spatial patterns of animal movements locally (Bruderer 1997, 
Fijn et al. 2015, Hu et al. 2016, Nilsson et al. 2018), as well 
as on a large scale (Gauthreaux  et  al. 2003, Chilson  et  al. 
2012, Dokter  et  al. 2018, van Doren and Horton 2018, 
Nilsson et al. 2019). Therefore, the significance and demand 
for quantitative radar studies of animal movements in the 
context of ecological or environmental impact assessment 
studies has increased considerably (Bridge et al. 2011, Bauer 
and Hoye 2014, Bauer et al. 2017).

An accurate quantification of animal movements requires 
an adequate, but not easily accessible, knowledge of the mon-
itored volume of the radar used (Schmaljohann et al. 2008, 
Drake and Reynolds 2012, Larkin and Diehl 2012). In prin-
cipal, radars transmit electromagnetic waves that propagate 

in a three-dimensional beam along a main axis. The shape 
and extent of the beam defines the volume of air monitored 
by the radar. In addition to the characteristics of the radar 
system, the detection range, and thus, the monitored volume, 
depends strongly on the size of the object and its properties 
for reflecting the electromagnetic waves (Knott et al. 2004, 
Schmaljohann et al. 2008). Large objects are detected at far-
ther distances and at wider angles from the beam axis than 
small ones (Fig. 1a). Because the energy density decays at a 
known rate with distance from the radar antenna (power law 
of four, see below Eq. 1), we can correct the echo power for 
its distance and estimate an object size defined by its reflec-
tive properties, its so-called radar cross section (RCS). This 
apparent RCS corrects for the distance along the main axis, 
but only refers to true RCS for objects that pass through the 
centre of the beam. Because the echo strength decreases with 
increasing angle from the beam axis, objects illuminated 

Figure 1. Research scheme. (a) Most radar studies assume a maximum detection distance (monitored volume, grey disk) for all detected 
objects (filled symbols), irrespective of their size (object size: blue > red). However, many small objects remain undetected (open symbols) 
within the maximum detection distance (red-open symbols within the grey circle). (b) Radars detect echoes with large RCS further away 
than echoes with small RCS (maximal detection distance Dmax indicated by the vertical dotted line with the respective colour). Because the 
apparent RCS of objects decreases with increasing distance from the beam axis, the RCS of objects of different size overlap in the low ranges. 
Therefore, the actual size cannot be directly measured, but (c) the wingbeat frequency (WBF) can be used to separate large from small birds 
(Pennycuick 2001). The upper range of the RCS distributions should be closest to the true RCS due to individuals flying across the centre 
of the beam and serve as a reference RCS (RCSref) for object of similar size. (d) Applying RCSref results in size-specific detection monitored 
volume (blue and red disks).

in the periphery of the beam will appear smaller than an 
object of the same size detected in the beam centre (Fig. 1b). 
Therefore, the apparent RCS is a minimal measure of the 
true RCS, or the true object size, respectively. True RCS can 
hardly be measured directly by radar.

The frequency at which birds flap their wings is highly cor-
related with their body size, with larger birds flapping slower 
than small ones (Pennycuick 2001, Bruderer  et  al. 2010). 
This relationship has also been shown in several insect groups 
(Greenewalt 1962, Drake and Reynolds 2012). With respect 
to radar signals, the wingbeat frequency (WBF) of a bird can 
be estimated from the variation in echo intensity over time 
(echo signature) (Eastwood and Rider 1966, Bruderer and 
Joss 1969, Bruderer et al. 2010). Therefore, we can use the 
wingbeat frequency to estimate the size of the bird, indepen-
dently from the apparent RCS (Fig. 1c). By assigning a given 
wingbeat frequency to a distinct RCS, we can estimate a bird-
specific monitored volume (Fig. 1d).

In this study, we analysed six million echoes detected with 
a vertical-looking radar system (Nilsson et al. 2018), located 
at a range of sites along the African-Eurasian avian migra-
tory flyway (from Sweden in the north, United Kingdom in 
the west, to Israel in the south-east), sampling birds from a 
wide geographic range. We used features of the echo signa-
ture to classify each echo into four echo-types (‘passerine’, 
‘wader’, ‘unidentified-bird’, and ‘non-bird’), and estimated 
the WBF (Zaugg et al. 2008). We first investigate how non-
bird echoes, mainly insects, can be excluded from our sample 
by applying distance-dependent RCS-filters, and what the 
consequences are for the monitored volume. We then esti-
mate the object sizes of birds with similar wingbeat patterns, 
and test whether the estimated object sizes are consistent 
across large geographical ranges that likely differ in the spe-
cies composition of migratory birds. Finally, we highlight the 
importance of accounting for size-specific monitored volume 
in order to accurately quantify the height distributions of ani-
mal movements aloft. Our results highlight the importance 
of considering the size-specific monitored volume for each 
echo, and is an important step towards a more accurate quan-
titative estimate of animal movements using radar systems.

Methods

Radar physics in brief

Radar equation, RCS, and sensitivity filters
The radar equation describes the fundamental relationship 
of how the power registered by the receiver (Pr) can be 
determined as a function of the transmitted power (Pt), the 
distance (D) and the properties of the reflecting object (RCS). 
For point targets the radar equation can be formulated as 
follows (Drake and Reynolds 2012, Eq. 3.14a):

Apart from the wave-length (λ), the received power also 
depends on how the energy is distributed in space due 
to the characteristics of the antenna and how the energy 
reflected by an object is concentrated by the antenna. Thus, 
the shape of the antenna has a two-fold impact, which is 
defined as the antenna gain (G0 [dB]). The received power 
Pr is the only object-specific quantity measured. We can 
rearrange the Eq. 1 to calculate a distance-corrected mea-
sure of the target size, the RCS (radar cross section) (Drake 
and Reynolds 2012, Eq. 4.1):

The minimal RCS (standing for ‘object size’) detectable at a 
given distance increases with the 4th power of the distance. 
As a consequence, the minimal RCS detectable at 10 m is 
100 million times smaller than the one at 1 km. Hence, at 
close range a radar is much more sensitive than at farther 
distances. To exclude undesired echoes at short range, like 
reflections from ground (clutter), air turbulences or insects, 
most radar systems apply two different filters (Fig. 3a). 
A threshold based filter excludes all targets below a given 
received power Pr. Such a filter works independent of the 
distance and simply reduces the sensitivity of the radar sys-
tem to exclude background noise in the system. A second, 
distance-dependent filter, named sensitivity time control 
(STC), supresses small targets at close range. The character-
istics of an STC-filter can be defined by the distance at which 
a minimal RCS is still detectable, e.g. a 300 m STC-filter 
indicates that any object with an RCS only detectable up 
to 300 m will be excluded, while any larger object will be 
detected also within this distance.

Monitored volume and migratory traffic rates
Any quantitative monitoring is defined in time (duration) 
and space (detection range). The simplest non-directional 
antenna would propagate the same amount of energy in 
all directions and thus, the monitored volume would only 
depend on the reflecting properties of an object (RCS). 
However, almost all radars use antennas concentrating the 
emitted energy in a specific direction (Eastwood 1967, 
Drake and Reynolds 2012). The simplified radar equation 
presented in Eq. 1 describes the decay of the signal power 
along the beam axis. In order to estimate the monitored vol-
ume of a radar, it is further necessary to take into account for 
the decrease in echo power with increasing angle from the 
beam axis. The volume monitored for an object of given size 
(expressed as RCS) is defined by the maximum detection dis-
tance and the RCS specific beam angle (Fig. 2). Briefly, the 
radar equation (Eq. 1) can include the radar’s beam pattern 
function D (θ) as follows:

The angular beam width θthresh depends on the detection 
threshold Prthresh, the detection distance D and the RCS. 
Therefore, the volume monitored for an object of given 
RCS is defined by the maximum detection distance and the  
RCS specific angular beam width θthresh.

Migration traffic rate (MTR) is a standardised measure of 
bird movements that describes the number of birds crossing a 
virtual transect line of one kilometre within one hour (Lowery 
1951, Liechti et al. 1995). The MTR therefore accounts for 
RCS and distance-dependent variation in monitored volume. 
For an object of a given RCS, we can estimate the width of 

the beam at its detection distance. The ratio between a one 
kilometre transect and the beam width serves as the correc-
tion factor to calculate MTR (hereafter referred as to MTR 
factor FMTR):

The MTR of a period between t1 and t2 is the sum of the

Echo detection, classification and wingbeat frequency

We used a modified X-band marine radar (Bridgemaster©, 
25 kW, 9.4 GHz, wavelength ca 3.2 cm) with a vertical-
looking 20 dB Horn antenna (17.5° nominal beam angle 
at –3 dB; Swiss BirdRadar Solution AG, swiss-birdradar.
com). We used 70 ns short-pulse emission for a range reso-
lution of 10 m and a maximal detection range of 1500 m. 
An automated software detects objects passing through the 
beam, and digitises the detected echo signals (sampling fre-
quency = 425–450 Hz). The digitizer converts the received 
signal into dBm based on calibration measurements with 
a signal processing unit (Test Set 75, Gigaset) and a ref-
erence power of 1 mW. The echo signature describes the 
temporal variation of the echo power. The echo power is 
greatest when objects transit closest to the beam centre. 
The echo power also varies in relation to changes in the 
aspect of the object, such as the wingbeat movements of 
birds. To remove the small variations in echo intensity 
induced by changes in aspect, we apply a low pass filter 
(Chebyshev type I filters of order 5 with nominal band-
pass limit set to 0.5 Hz) on the echo signature to iden-
tify the maximal echo power (hereafter referred to as echo 
power [dBm]). Because the intensity of the backscattered 
signal decays by distance at a known rate, we standardise 
the echo power with a distance correction given by the 
radar equation (Eq. 2).

This distance-corrected echo power is directly related to 
the RCS [m2]. For a given object size, the RCS is maximal 
when the object passes through the beam axis, and minimal 
at the detection threshold at the periphery of the beam. We 
therefore referred to the measured RCS as apparent RCS. 
The echo power and its related RCS can strongly depend 
on the aspect of the animal in relation to the beam orienta-
tion (Edwards and Houghton 1959, Bruderer and Joss 1969, 
Mirkovic  et  al. 2016). Since vertical-looking radars illumi-
nate animals from below (‘ventral aspect’), the influence of 
aspect variation in a low-pass-filtered RCS is low and thus 
neglected in this study.

We used supervised learning to automate manual echo 
classification and manual assessment of wingbeat frequency 
(WBF). A band-pass filter (Chebyshev type I filters of order 5 
with nominal band-pass limits set to 4 and 180 Hz) removed 
high frequency signal oscillations partly due to the 0.8 Hz 
rotation of the antenna. We used features derived from the 
echo signature (detailed features in Supplementary material 
Appendix 1 Table A1) and trained random forest classifiers 
to group the echoes into four echo-types (‘passerine’, ‘wader’, 
‘unidentified-bird’, and ‘non-bird’; Zaugg et al. 2008). Class 
probabilities are calculated for each echo, and the class with 
the highest probability is assigned to the echo. We re-classified 
echoes with class probabilities for passerine-type and wader-
type lower than 0.5 as unidentified-bird-type. Non-bird 
echoes are insects and other non-determined objects. We 
assessed the WBF [Hz] with a random forest regression 
model trained with manually confirmed WBF values, and 
features extracted from band-pass echo signatures (detailed 
features in Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A1). 
For each estimated WBF, a credibility factor is provided as 
the proportion of regression trees reaching close consensus. 
Cross validation of estimated WBF with manually deter-
mined WBF based on expert knowledge produced a Pearson 
correlation coefficient of 0.976 (on a subset of echoes with 
credibility factors ≥ 0.5). Because of the low-band pass filter, 
the trained classifier cannot determine WBF below 4 Hz. We 
restricted the WBF range to 25 Hz for birds (maximal known 
WBF for European birds, Bruderer et al. 2010) and to WBF 
with credibility factors larger than 0.5.

(United Kingdom (UK), year round). During the course of 
these monitoring campaigns, the deployed radars registered 
6  460  205 echoes, of which 660  200 were ‘passerine-type’ 
echoes (79.5% with WBF), 96 337 were ‘wader-type’ echoes 
(97.8% with WBF), 1 136 481 were ‘unidentified-bird-type’ 
echoes (44.1% with WBF), and 4 567 187 echoes were clas-
sified as ‘non-bird-type’. This latter category undoubtedly 
consisted largely of insects, which at times can be hugely 
abundant in the atmosphere (Drake and Reynolds 2012, 
Hu et al. 2016). We also note that wader-type echoes may 
include echoes from bats (Bruderer and Popa-Lisseanu 
2005). The WBF of bats range between 5 to 12 Hz (similar 
values to the bird species classified as wader-type), and bats 
follow similar WBF-body size relationship as birds (Bullen 
and McKencie 2002, Norberg and Norberg 2012). Further 
knowledge on cross-validated echo signatures may enable 
disentanglement of wader-type bird-echoes from bat-echoes. 
The monitoring campaigns differed in sensitivity settings: 
STCdist ranged from 100 to 500 m, and detection threshold 
Prmin  ranged from –100 to –90 dBm.

Analyses

Influence of sensitivity settings on monitored volume and on 
sample size
Radar users can adjust two detection sensitivity settings: the 
RCS-dependent filter (STC) and the detection threshold. 
We investigated how changes in these two sensitivity settings 
influence 1) the number of non-bird echoes, mainly insects, 
from the sampled data, and 2) the monitored volume. We 
used all echoes monitored with 300 m STC and –93 dBm 
detection threshold. We then applied post-hoc (after detec-
tion) the following sensitivity settings: STC 500 m, detec-
tion threshold –90, –87, and –83 dBm. In our study, a STC 
increase from 300 to 500 m increases the minimal RCS by 
a factor 7.7. An increase of three dB (a logarithmic scale) of 
the detection threshold corresponds to a two-fold increase in 
the required echoed energy for detection. We report changes 
in number of echoes detected for the following echo-types: 
passerine and non-bird.

We then illustrate the consequences of adjustable sensitiv-
ity settings (detection thresholds Prthresh : –93 dBm, –87 dBm) 
and reference RCS (0.002 or 0.02 m2) on the monitored vol-
ume, especially on the maximum detection distance (Dmax), 
and on MTR factors. Based on the radar equation, we esti-
mate the monitored volume with an R-script (Supplementary 
material Appendix 5) and the following parameter: DSTC 300 
m, Pt 20 kW, and waveguide attenuation 0 dB. We report the 
median of MTR-factors per 50 m distance bin.

Determination of reference RCS using wingbeat frequency
The only measure of the object size registered by radar is 
given by the apparent RCS, although the apparent RCS of 
objects decrease with the distance of the object from the 
beam axis (see above ‘Radar physics in brief ’). Because the 
estimation of the monitored volume requires knowledge of 
the object’s RCS (Eq. 4), we form groups of birds of similar 

size using the echo type and the WBF to assign reference RCS 
to these birds. We use the distribution of the apparent RCS 
of all echoes per echo type and WBF interval to estimate a 
reference RCS. We report the 0.90- and 0.95-quantiles of the 
RCS distribution for each echo-type and 2-Hz WBF inter-
vals. We used the results to estimate the MTR factors for each 
echo (see next section).

The species composition likely differs between the dif-
ferent geographical areas, and during spring and autumn 
migration events. We investigated whether the geographi-
cal region influences the observed RCS distributions. We 
used passerine-type echoes only because they are classified 
with high credibility, are abundant at each site and cover 
the entire range of WBF. We tested the dependency of the 
0.9-quantile of the RCS (square-root transformed; using the 
0.95-quantiles lead to similar results) on 2-Hz WBF inter-
val (as ordered factors), adding the site identity as a random 
intercept in linear mixed-effects models as implemented in 
the ‘lme4’ R-package (Bates et al. 2015, R ver. 3.4.3), assum-
ing a Gaussian distribution of the residuals.

Distance distribution corrected for size-specific monitored 
volume
To demonstrate the influence of MTR-factors on the esti-
mate of migration intensity, we compared the distance distri-
bution of the detected echoes with the distance distribution 
of MTR-factors. For each type of bird echo and WBF, we 
used the reference RCS determined by the 0.90-quantile dis-
tribution of RCS (analyses with the 0.95 quantile were quan-
titative similar). The calculation of MTR-factor for each echo 
is based on the radar equation (Eq. 1) and requires the fol-
lowing information: reference RCS (Supplementary material 
Appendix 2 Table A2), the distance (echoes are binned into 
50 m distance intervals), the two sensitivity settings Prthresh  and 
DSTC, the transmitted power Pt specified by the radar type, 
and the radiation pattern as provided by the antenna manu-
facturer (Supplementary material Appendix 5, R-function 
‘funMTRfactor’). We calculated the MTR-factors for all bird 
echoes registered with maximum Prthresh of –93 dBm and DSTC 
of 300 m, so that echo detection is based on a radar beam of 
the same shape.

Results

Influence of sensitivity settings on monitored volume 
and on sample size

An increase of the detection threshold by 6 dB reduced the 
effective beam area (planar projection of the monitored vol-
ume along the distance axis) by about 50% (Fig. 2: Prthresh –93 
dBm vs –87 dBm, see also Supplementary material Appendix 3

Table A3). In particular, the maximal detection distance Dmax 
decreased from 1361 m ( Prthresh  –93 dBm) to 949 m ( Prthresh  –87 
dBm) for objects of 0.02 cm2 reference RCS, and from 765 m  
( Prthresh –93 dBm) to 527 m ( Prthresh –87 dBm) for objects  
of 0.002 cm2 reference RCS (Supplementary material 
Appendix 3 Table A3, Fig. 2). In contrast, an increase of DSTC 
from 300 to 500 m had only a minor effect on the beam area 
(< 10%, Table 3) and does not affect the maximum detection 
distance as long as the object is large enough to be detected 
within the STC range.

The MTR-factors are inversely proportional to the beam 
width. Setting higher detection threshold Prthresh  reduces the  
maximal detection distance Dmax, and the MTR-factors  
above Dmax are undefined and set equal to zero. Within Dmax, 
setting a higher detection threshold or STC reduces the 
beam width, therefore increasing the MTR-factors at a given 
height. Similarly, at a given height, the MTR-factors of large 
objects are smaller than the MTR-factors of small objects.

An increase of the detection threshold and STC low-
ers the measurement sensitivity and reduces the number of 
detected echoes (Table 2, Fig. 3). Obviously, a reduction of 
the sensitivity increases RCSmin (Table 2). By increasing the 
STC, small objects, especially echoes classified as non-bird 
type (Fig. 3), are reduced considerably. The proportion of 
non-bird echoes decreases from 59% (Table 2: STCdist 300 m,  
Prmin –93 dBm) to less than 20% of the detected echoes  
(Table 2: STCdist 500 m, Prmin –93 dBm). This 200 m increase 
of STC excluded 89% of the non-bird echoes, but only 
28% of the passerines-type echoes. Increasing the detection 
threshold not only excludes small objects, it also reduces the 
monitored volume for any given object size. An increase in 
the detection threshold (–93 to –90 dBm; Table 2) decreases 
the proportion of non-bird echoes to 42% by excluding 67% 
of theses echoes, but this also leads to an exclusion of 30% of 
the passerine-type echoes.

Determination of reference RCS using wingbeat 
frequency

The apparent RCS decreased with increasing WBF for all 
three types of bird echoes (Fig. 4). Considering echoes with 
similar WBF, the median RCS is smallest for passerine-type, 
generally highest for wader-type, whereas unidentified birds 
tend to show intermediate median values. The 0.90-quantile 
distributions of apparent RCS parallel the 0.95-quantile dis-
tributions. We hereafter denominate the 0.90-quantile as the 
reference RCS, and we report the square-root of the reference 
RCS, since it approximates the size of birds at a tangible scale.

Wader-type echoes with low WBF (4–10 Hz) typically 
had reference RCS of 10–13 cm. The wader-type echoes with 
11 ± 1 Hz WBF had a smaller reference RCS than echoes 
with 13 ± 1 Hz WBF (Fig. 4). The relatively few wader-
type echoes with WBF larger than 13 Hz only occurred in 
non-rotation mode and mostly occurred during night time. 
Passerine-type echoes with low WBF (4–12 Hz) had reference

RCS of 6–7 cm. We observed a marked decrease in reference 
RCS between 11 Hz and 13 Hz WBF intervals. The reference 
RCS of passerines with WBF > 12 Hz decreased steadily to a 
minimal square-root value of 3.5 cm. Unidentified-bird-type 
echoes showed a steeper decrease in reference RCS between 5 
and 13 Hz WBF intervals than between 13 and 25 Hz WBF 
intervals.

The reference RCS per 2 Hz WBF intervals for passerine-
type echoes showed no differences between study sites (using 
the 0.95 RCS quantiles led to similar results). Between-site 
variance (0.17 ± 0.65) is about 20 times smaller than the 
averaged site value (Intercept 4.06 ± 0.07) and 10 times 
smaller than the decrease in RCS per two-Hertz (–2.08 ± 
0.16; see also Supplementary material Appendix 4 Fig. A3).

Distance distribution corrected for object-size 
dependent beam width

For each bird type and WBF interval we determined a refer-
ence RCS by the 0.90-quantile of the apparent RCS distribu-
tion (Fig. 4). We calculated the beam-width and monitored 
volume for each reference RCS values (Supplementary mate-
rial Appendix 2 Table A2) in order to derive an MTR-factor 
for each echo. Weighing each echo by it’s MTR-factor con-
siderably increased the proportion of low-flying birds (Fig. 5). 
Fifty percent of the echoes were detected below the first 428 
m (0.25-quantile: 266 m; 0.75-quantile: 597 m, Fig. 5a), 
whereas 50% of the MTR occurred within the first 306 

m (0.25-quantile: 167 m; 0.75-quantile: 499 m, Fig. 5b). 
According to the reference RCS per taxa, Dmax of large pas-
serines (passerine-type with WBF < 12 Hz) is 858 m, and 
Dmax of small passerine echoes (passerine-type with WBF > 
12Hz) is 723 m (Fig. 5). Beyond 723 m, the MTR-factors 
of passerine-type echoes with WBF > 12 HZ equals zero, 
and therefore beyond this limit movements of small-passerine 
were ignored.

Discussion

Inexperienced researchers using radar systems to quantify 
bird movements often assume that the coverage of a radar 
is related to the distance at which some birds can still be 
detected. This study provides a framework for the accurate 
quantification of avian movements with radar, taking into 
account the size-specific monitored volume. Using data col-
lected from distinct areas across Europe, and a broad variety 
of flying animals, we estimated the size of a bird based on the 
WBF, independent of the echo power.

Influence of sensitivity settings

In this study, we assess the effects of adjustable sensitivity set-
tings on the detection of echoes of diverse types. Increasing 
the STC effectively removes the numerous non-bird echoes of 
little power (2/3 of all detected echoes). A small probability

of miss-classification of these non-bird echoes (insects) can 
produce high number of bird-type echoes, misleading sub-
sequent analyses. The STC also has the advantage of acting 
only within the distance set by the STC, so it does not reduce 
the maximal detection distance of the target objects. In con-
trast, increasing the detection threshold significantly reduces 
the object-size specific monitored volume, in particular the 
maximal detection distance. Therefore, although a radar 
would detect large birds up to 2 km distances, the echoed 
power of smaller birds falls below the detection threshold at 
much smaller distances.

When possible, sensitivity settings should be selected to 
maximise echo detection. For a quantitative monitoring of 
avian migration, sensitivity settings (i.e. STC and detection 
threshold) should be appropriately selected in order to moni-
tor movements of the smallest targeted bird taxa. Setting high 
STC values post-hoc can remove echoes from small birds in 
studies that focus on large birds only (e.g. geese). Therefore, 
adjusting the STC is an effective tool to match the specific 
aim and target object of radar monitoring. Furthermore, the 
appropriate radar parameters are required to correct for dif-
ferences in the monitored volume.

Knowledge of radar parameters (wavelength, peak of 
transmitted power, antenna gain, waveguide attenuation, 
and the radiation pattern) and adjustable sensitivity set-
tings (detection threshold and STC) are a prerequisite for 
any quantitative radar monitoring. Moreover, regular cali-
bration will ensure registering of accurate information on 
standardised echo properties such as the echo power and its 
derived RCS (Atlas 2002, Schmaljohann et al. 2008, Drake 
and Reynolds 2012, May  et  al. 2017, Urmy and Warren 
2017). Unfortunately, popular radar systems operating with 
built-in analysis software may not provide information on 

radar parameters and adjustable sensitivity settings to the 
end-users. In addition, some end-users can only monitor 
the radar display, not being able to register any quantitative 
information on the echo power (Nilsson et al. 2018). Such 
black-box radar systems render any quantitative assessment 
of animal movements difficult. As demonstrated in this study, 
the striking effects of adjustable sensitivity settings on the 
number of detected echoes per echo-type render the calibra-
tion and report of these sensitivity settings essential for any 
quantitative radar measurement.

Determination of reference RCS using WBF

We estimated the reference RCS from the echoed RCS for 
each echo-type (passerine-type, wader-type, and unidentified-
bird-type) and WBF (2 Hz intervals). The smaller reference 
RCS of echoes with high WBF compared to echoes with 
lower WBF corroborate the negative correlation between 
body size and WBF defined in allometric flight models 
(Pennycuick 2001, Bruderer et al. 2010). The fact that the 
reference RCS are independent from the study site and sea-
son provides support to the general validity of using WBF to 
estimate the object size.

Using the 0.90- or 0.95-quantile of the RCS distributions 
provides bird size estimates close to experimental measure-
ments of birds measured on the broad side (Edwards and 
Houghton 1959, Bruderer and Joss 1969, Vaughn 1985). 
Deviation from the relationship between the WBF and the 
related bird size can occur because of variation in flight 
behaviour. For instance, many passerine-type echoes with 
WBF lower than 8 Hz may originate from swallows perform-
ing flap-gliding flight instead of flap-bounding flight, result-
ing in WBF lower than expected (Rayner 1985, Liechti and 

Figure 5. Distance distributions of (a) echoes and (b) MTR. Colours indicate echoes of different echo-types: red for passerine-type, grey for 
unidentified-bird-type, and blue for wader-type. The vertical black lines indicate the 0.25- and 0.75-quantiles, the dots indicate the median 
of the distance distributions. The horizontal red dashed lines indicate the maximal detection distances Dmax ( Prthresh  = –93 dBm, Pt = 20 kW, 
waveguide attenuation = 0 dB) for small passerine type (square-root reference RCS = 4.2 cm), large passerine type (square-root reference 
RCS = 5.7 cm), and large unidentified birds (square-root reference RCS = 11.9 cm). Above these lines, the MTR-factors equal zero for the 
respective echo groups.

Bruderer 2002, Tobalske 2007). Passerines contribute to the 
large majority of inland avian migration fluxes (Hahn et al. 
2009), and probably the majority of the unidentified-bird-
type echoes are from passerine birds. Changes in the orienta-
tion of the bird’s body within the beam can induce important 
changes in echo intensity, masking the regular modulation of 
the echo intensity due to the wingbeat patterns. Unidentified-
bird-type echoes do not show a clear wingbeat type and less 
than 50% of the echoes had a credible WBF. Nevertheless, 
compared to passerine-type echoes, the upper RCS distribu-
tion of unidentified-bird-types is larger, probably because 
unidentified-bird-type echoes also include echoes from large 
soaring birds and bird flocks, shifting the RCS distributions 
to larger quantiles. Consequently, the over-estimation of the 
0.90 RCS quantiles for unidentified-bird-type echoes leads 
to smaller MTR-factors, and an underestimation of the stan-
dardised movement intensity (MTR). The maximal WBF of 
wader-type birds reaches 12 Hz, with the notable exception of 
quails Coturnix coturnix (16 Hz, Bruderer et al. 2010), while 
some echoes with WBF > 12 Hz might be misclassifications.

The apparent RCS used in this study is not corrected 
for the decay in echo intensity with increasing distance 
from the beam axis. The rotation of the antenna on a slight 
nutated axis can allow the estimation of the angle between 
the entry- and exit-point of the object in the beam in rela-
tion to the beam centre. Assuming a straight flight, this 
angle can be used to calculate the closest distance between 
the object and the centre of the beam, and thus to correct 
the RCS accordingly (Drake and Reynolds 2012). This 
requires an accurate estimation of the beam width, and has 
not yet been implemented in the radar system used in this 
study. We here propose a method to determine the RCS 
according to the WBF, independently of the position of the 
object within the beam.

A similar approach could estimate the monitored volume 
for insects. Insects also show strong relationships between 
WBF and body size (Greenewalt 1962, Drake and Reynolds 
2012). However, this relationship only holds within par-
ticular taxonomic groups, as insect taxa differ very much in 
size and wing shape. The estimation of insects’ RCS based 
on WBF thus requires more detailed echo classification, or 
knowledge on flight phenology.

Distance distribution corrected for object-size 
dependent beam width

After correction for the monitored volume, the height (i.e. 
distance for a vertical looking antenna) distribution of the 
migration intensity is lower than if only reporting the height 
distribution of detected echoes. The differences in the height 
distribution of echoes and MTR highlight the potential mis-
leading evaluation of collision risks of animals with human 
made structures such as wind turbines, bridges or power 
lines. In that regard, it is crucial that impact assessment stud-
ies accurately quantify the intensity of animal movements.

This article quantifies the importance of reporting stan-
dardised movements such as MTR to avoid detection biases. 

Equally important is to report the maximal detection ranges 
(Fig. 5) because important migration intensity can occur 
at high altitude (reviewed by Bruderer and Peter 2017, 
Bruderer et al. 2018), far above the maximal detection range 
of a particular monitoring scheme. Quantitative informa-
tion on high migration events can be retrieved using longer 
pulse emission, available in many small radar systems, that 
increase the maximal detection distance. Alternatively, the 
increasing availability of weather radar data can complement 
height distribution retrieved from small scale radar systems 
(Nilsson et al. 2018).

Conclusions

Radar systems are valuable tools for the monitoring of aerial 
animal movements, but the results may suffer from important 
biases when the registered data is not processed adequately. In 
line with recent publications which detail adequate proce-
dures (Schmaljohann et al. 2008, Drake and Reynolds 2012, 
Larkin and Diehl 2012, May et al. 2017, Urmy and Warren 
2017) we hope that this publication will help to improve the 
scientific quality of radar monitoring.

We demonstrate the importance of accurately quantifying 
animal movement intensities, in particular for impact assess-
ment studies of human-made structures (Aschwanden et al. 
2018), or more generally to ecological studies of bioflows 
(Hu  et  al. 2016, Dokter  et  al. 2018). Fixed-beam radar 
systems have the great advantage of being able to retrieve 
detailed information on the registered echoes, such as the 
WBF. We show how the WBF can be used as an indepen-
dent measure of the body size of the animal, and how this 
taxa-specific RCS provides the most accurate estimation of 
the monitored volume. When information on WBF is miss-
ing, citizen science data or expert knowledge on the body 
size of the birds involved in the investigated movements can 
allow the estimation of the monitored volume. Together with 
specific information on radar parameters (transmitted power, 
antenna gain, wavelength, radiation pattern) and sensitivity 
parameters (detection threshold, STC), information on the 
taxa specific RCS are essential for any quantitative monitor-
ing of animal movement and should always be made available 
and reported.
