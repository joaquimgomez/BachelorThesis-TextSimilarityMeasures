INTRODUCTION

Cetaceans and, in this particular case, harbour
porpoises Phocoena phocoena, rely on hearing for
vital activities, and any perturbations to sound per-
ception can have significant impacts on their sur-
vival. Harbour porpoise cranial sinuses, and specifi-
cally peri bullar sinuses, are parasitized by the

nematode Stenu rus minor (Metastrongyloidea:
Pseudaliidae), Kühn, 1829 with high prevalence
(Deliamure 1955, Arnold & Gaskin 1975, Brosens et
al. 1996, Faulkner et al. 1998, Siebert et al. 2001,
2006, Kijewska et al. 2003, Lehnert et al. 2005,
2014). At present, the effect of S. minor on the
hearing ability of harbour porpoises is still contro-
versial.

ABSTRACT: Peribullar sinuses of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena are parasitized with high
prevalence by the nematode Stenurus minor. The effect of S. minor on the hearing ability of this
species is still undetermined. Here, we review the occurrence of S. minor in the inner ear of har-
bour porpoises recovered from strandings in the North and Baltic Seas. In particular, we present
the results from ears collected in German and Danish waters from 2002 to 2016 and from Dutch
waters from 2010 to 2016. While the prevalence of S. minor in pterygoid and peribullar sinuses
and tympanic cavity was high in harbour porpoises (66.67% in our cases), its prevalence in the
cochlea was rare. Only 1 case out of 129 analysed by either histology, electron microscopy or
immunofluorescence showed the presence of a nematode parasite morphologically consistent
with S. minor at the most basal portion of the right cochlea. This individual also had severe haem-
orrhage along the right cochlear spiral, which was likely caused by ectopic S. minor migration.
Although this animal might have had impaired hearing in the right ear, it was otherwise in good
body condition with evidence of recent feeding. These findings highlight the need to study the
effect of parasites on hearing, and other pathological changes that might impair appropriate pro-
cessing of acoustic information.

Parasite infection could negatively affect hearing
(Kijewska et al. 2003) and potentially contribute to
mass strandings (Dailey & Walker 1978). However, S.
minor infection could also be less important in terms
of clinical disease and mortality, as it has been found
in otherwise presumably healthy by-caught animals.
Mild inflammatory reaction of the soft tissue lining
the tympanic cavity (i.e. place where middle ear ossi-
cles are located) was associated with these parasites
in a few strandings (Siebert et al. 2001). Although S.
minor was present in the tympanic cavity, its occur-
rence in the inner ear was suspected by Kijewska et
al. (2003) and to our knowledge, has not been shown
conclusively in prior studies.

Here, we review the occurrence of S. minor in
the inner ear of harbour porpoises recovered from
strandings in the North and Baltic Seas. In particular,
we present the results from ears collected in German
and Danish waters from 2002 to 2016 and from Dutch
waters from 2010 to 2016.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples and procedures

The harbour porpoises in this study were submitted
for necropsy to (1) the University of Veterinary Med-
icine Hannover in Germany, or (2) the Faculty of Vet-
erinary Medicine (Utrecht University) in The Nether-
lands. The animals were not killed for the purpose of
this study, but were found dead or were by-caught
in Dutch, German and Danish waters of the North
and Baltic Seas. The ears were collected from post
mortem case material as part of an investigation into
the cause of death, and analysed following different
techniques depending on their origin.

Germany (coastline of Schleswig-Holstein) and
Denmark

Both tympano-periotic complexes (TPCs) from 34
porpoises and 1 TPC from 3 porpoises (n = 71 ears
in total) were fixed in 10% neutral buffered forma-
lin, following the protocols described by Siebert et
al. (2001). The TPCs of 21 animals were decalcified
in 0.27 M disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) for approximately 7 wk, dehydrated
in a graded ethanol series and embedded in cel-
loidin as described previously (Jepson et al. 2006).
The tissue was then sectioned serially (20 µm)
 parallel to the modiolus, giving a total of about

800− 1200 sections per ear. Every tenth section was
stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The
cochlear area of the TPCs of 13 individuals was
cut into 2 mm slices using a diamond band saw,
decalcified in 0.27 M EDTA for approximately 3 to
4 wk and subsequently embedded in paraffin wax
ac cording to standard laboratory procedures. Tissue
sections were cut at 3 µm thickness and stained
with HE.

The Netherlands

Since 2010, 58 inner ears from 38 harbour por-
poises have been analysed. In all cases, post mortem
examination was undertaken at the faculty of Veteri-
nary Medicine, Utrecht University, according to pro-
tocols (Kuiken & García Hartmann 1993). As part of
the investigation, oval and round windows of both
inner ears were perfused with 10% neutral buffered
formalin (Morell & André 2009).

The periotic bone surrounding the cochlea was
decalcified using either 14% EDTA tetrasodium salt
(Morell et al. 2017) or RDO® according to a previ-
ously optimized protocol (Morell et al. 2009).

The prevalence of parasites in the inner ear could
be determined during the dissection while the
cochlea was processed for immunofluorescence (n =
13) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, n = 39),
among other techniques.

SEM

Decalcification of the periotic bone was stopped
when the vestibular scala and the stria vascularis of
the cochlea were visually apparent. The cochlea was
subsequently dissected, dehydrated in a graded
etha nol series, critical point dried and coated with
gold−palladium or platinum−palladium (Morell et al.
2015, 2017). The samples were evaluated with a
Hitachi S-3500N SEM at the Institute of Marine Sci-
ences, Spanish National Research Council, Spain, or
with an S-4700 SEM at the University of British
Columbia (UBC) Bioimaging Facility, Canada.

Histology

One sample from The Netherlands (left ear from
UT 1317) was processed for histology. The periotic
bone was completely decalcified by using 14%
EDTA for 51 d.

Tissues were dehydrated through a graded series
of alcohols to xylene using an automated tissue
processor (Tissue Tek), embedded in paraffin, sec-
tioned at 5 µm and 3 consecutive sections retained
every 100 µm. The slides were stained with HE.

Nematode sampling

Parasites were isolated from cranial sinuses and
tympanic bullae, cleaned and preserved in 70−90%
ethanol (or in 10% neutral buffered formalin for indi-
vidual UT 1317). Prevalence (Bush et al. 1997) and
level of parasitic infection was determined macro-
scopically and semiquantitatively during necropsy
as: none (no parasites observed), mild, moderate or
severe (Siebert et al. 2001, Lehnert et al. 2005).
Nematodes were cleared in glycerol or lactophenol
and identified based on morphological characteris-
tics according to the scientific literature (Arnold &
Gaskin 1975).

RESULTS

Examination of the tympanic cavity, peribullar and
pterygoid sinuses during necropsy from all samples
combined revealed 43 ears of porpoises with no par-
asites, 19 cases of mild, 31 cases of moderate and 36
cases of severe parasite infection.

Investigation of 71 inner ears collected from har-
bour porpoises recovered from Germany and Den-
mark did not identify Stenurus minor, whereas, in
1 case out of 58 ears analysed from The Netherlands,
the right ear from a juvenile male harbour porpoise
(UT 1317) presented with a parasite morphologically
consistent with S. minor in the cochlea. Because of its
significance, we will address in detail this particular
case below.

The index case, individual UT 1317, was by-caught
in a gillnet in Dutch waters on 3 July 2014. Approxi-
mately 15 h elapsed between the time of net deploy-
ment, retrieval, collection of the entangled animal
and ear perfusion. Gross examination revealed a har-
bour porpoise in moderate to good nutritive condi-
tion. Externally, small sharp incisions were present
bilateral on pectoral fins, fluke and the dorsal side of
the tailstock, and linear imprints on the rostrum were
observed; all external findings were consistent with
by-catch. The animal showed signs of very recent
feeding prior to death, based on both partly digested
and undigested prey present in the stomach and
undigested sandeels Ammodytes tobianus in the oral

cavity and oesophagus. The lungs had severe bi -
lateral oedema and mild bilateral nematodiasis, with
moderate verminous pneumonia confirmed by histo -
pathology. The gross and microscopic findings were
consistent with entanglement and asphyxiation
(Moore et al. 2013). In addition, the animal had gen-
eralized lymphadenopathy. Severe aggregates of
parasites were also found in both peribullar cavities,
and nematodes were morphologically consistent with
S. minor. Chronic enteritis and subacute interstitial
nephritis were also confirmed microscopically.

Right ear from UT 1317

On gross dissection, the inner ear was diffusely red
black (Fig. 1a). Throughout the cochlear spiral, there
was severe haemorrhage in the lumen as well as
overlying and obscuring the apical aspect of the
organ of Corti (Fig. 1a−c). In the most basal portion of
the cochlea, a nematode parasite morphologically
consistent with S. minor was identified (Fig. 1a,d−f).
The extent of haemorrhage within the lumen of the
cochlea precluded ultrastructural assessment of the
inner and outer hair cells of the cochlear spiral by
SEM.

Left ear from UT 1317

Histopathology of the left ear revealed no signifi-
cant lesions (Fig. 2a−c). The changes in the stria vas-
cularis, organ of Corti and supporting cells and tecto-
rial membrane displacement were consistent with
autolysis and sectioning artefact. At the lower apical
turn of the cochlea, there was minimal luminal haem-
orrhage in the tympanic scala (Fig. 2d). Although a
minor portion of the vestibule could not be evaluated,
there was no evidence of cochlear helminthiasis in
this ear.

DISCUSSION

This represents the index case of ectopic cochlear
infection of Stenurus minor in a cetacean and in
 particular for harbour porpoises. S. minor was not ob -
served in 128 ears examined from 74 harbour por-
poises by histology, electron microscopy or immuno -
fluorescence. An additional 47 harbour porpoise ears
were used for establishing decalcification protocols
(Morell et al. 2009) and, although the ears were not
processed for optic or electron microscopy, there

were no parasites or associated haemorrhage ob -
served on gross examination. Consequently, the
involvement of S. minor in the cochlea of harbour
porpoise is rare, with an incidence of 0.57% for our
cases of Germany, Denmark and The Netherlands
combined. Therefore, while the prevalence of S.
minor in pterygoid and peribullar sinuses and tym-
panic cavity is high in harbour porpoises (66.67% in
our cases), its prevalence in the cochlea is rare.

In UT 1317, the acute haemorrhage was attributed
to physical irritation of the organ of Corti caused by
ectopic nematode parasite migration. The parasite
likely penetrated from the tympanic cavity through
the round window to access into the cochlea. Al -
though cochlear haemorrhage may be related to
anthropogenic activities, the lack of other systemic
gross or microscopic lesions suggests ectopic parasite
migration as the cause of this process. The haemor-

rhage and intact cochlea confirm that parasite migra-
tion occurred ante-, rather than post mortem.

Since this individual was by-caught, the possibility
of haemorrhage secondary to gas decompression type
syndrome from rapid ascent in the net, blunt force
trauma incurred on impact with the net or some other
process cannot be excluded. In addition, haemorrhage
in the inner ear may also be attributed to blast injury,
degenerative and other disease processes. In human
divers, spontaneous haemorrhage within the inner
ear has been associated with haemorrhagic diathesis
or coagulopathies (Schuknecht 1993).

The contribution of the cochlear infection due to
the nematode as comorbidity and eventually to the
animal’s death remains unknown. Haemorrhages in
the cochlea have been associated with cases of sud-
den sensorineural hearing loss in humans (Salomone
et al. 2008). In addition, massive inner ear haemor-
rhage has been identified in humans as a cause for
sudden deafness in cases associated with leukaemia
(Schuknecht et al. 1965), Buerger’s disease (Kirikae et
al. 1962) or metastatic malignancy of the inner ear
(Hoshino et al. 1972). Thus, in the case presented
here, the infection of S. minor and haemorrhage over-
lying the organ of Corti (Fig. 1) may have impaired
hearing in the right ear. There was recently ingested
fish within the oral cavity, oesophagus and stomach,
which suggests that the animal was able to success-
fully forage; however, since this was a by-caught ani-
mal, it cannot be excluded that the animal was not
able to detect the gillnet. Since we do not have infor-
mation on the time period of the parasitic presence in
the cochlea, we should also consider the possibility
that S. minor migrated to the inner ear during the
struggling of the animal in the gillnet prior its death.

While there is still a current controversy on the
effects of S. minor on the tympanic cavity (Dailey &
Walker 1978, Siebert et al. 2001, Kijewska et al.
2003), where the middle ear ossicles are located, our
study shows that if the nematode parasite migrates to
the inner ear, it would impair hearing.

The collection and analysis of the inner ear is not
yet common practice among all stranding networks.
This case highlights the need to investigate parasite
infections, the effect of parasites on hearing and
other pathological changes that might impair ade-
quate processing of acoustic information, a funda-
mental process in cetaceans for their survival.
