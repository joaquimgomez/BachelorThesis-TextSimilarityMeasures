Abstract

The source(s) of the neutrino excess reported by the IceCube Col-
laboration is unknown. The TANAMI Collaboration recently reported
on the multiwavelength emission of six bright, variable blazars which
are positionally coincident with two of the most energetic IceCube
events. Objects like these are prime candidates to be the source of
the highest-energy cosmic rays, and thus of associated neutrino emis-
sion. We present an analysis of neutrino emission from the six blazars

using observations with the ANTARES neutrino telescope.The stan-
dard methods of the ANTARES candidate list search are applied to
six years of data to search for an excess of muons — and hence their
neutrino progenitors — from the directions of the six blazars described
by the TANAMI Collaboration, and which are possibly associated with
two IceCube events. Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response
to both signal and background particle fluxes are used to estimate the
sensitivity of this analysis for different possible source neutrino spectra.
A maximum-likelihood approach, using the reconstructed energies and
arrival directions of through-going muons, is used to identify events
with properties consistent with a blazar origin.Both blazars predicted
to be the most neutrino-bright in the TANAMI sample (1653−329 and
1714−336) have a signal flux fitted by the likelihood analysis corre-
sponding to approximately one event. This observation is consistent
with the blazar-origin hypothesis of the IceCube event IC14 for a broad
range of blazar spectra, although an atmospheric origin cannot be ex-
cluded. No ANTARES events are observed from any of the other four
blazars, including the three associated with IceCube event IC20. This
excludes at a 90% confidence level the possibility that this event was
produced by these blazars unless the neutrino spectrum is flatter than
−2.4.

1 Introduction

Since the initial report of the observation of two high-energy (∼PeV)
neutrino-induced cascades by the IceCube Collaboration [Aartsen et al.,
2013], further observations using the high-energy starting-event (HESE)
analysis have revealed an excess of events consistent with an isotropic,
flavour-uniform flux of astrophysical neutrinos [IceCube Collaboration,
2013, Aartsen et al., 2014a,b]. The small number of excess events (37
total, with an estimated background of 15), and directional resolution
of typically 10◦ or worse for cascades, makes it difficult to resolve po-
tential features of this flux, such as a spectral downturn above PeV
energies, a steeper spectral index, and/or a contribution from one or
more point-like sources of neutrinos. Consequently, many suggestions
for the nature and origin(s) of this flux have been put forward. Of par-
ticular note is the suggestion of a point-source near the Galactic Centre
producing the observed excess in that region [Razzaque, 2013], a hy-
pothesis already constrained by the ANTARES Collaboration [Adrián-
Mart́ınez et al., 2014a].

The TANAMI Collaboration has recently reported observations of
six bright, variable blazars in positional coincidence with the range of
possible arrival directions of the two PeV IceCube events IC14 and

4



IC20 [Krauß et al., 2014]1. Using a simple calculation based on the
observed 1 keV to 10 GeV photon flux, the authors estimate that
1.9 ± 0.4 electron neutrino events at PeV energies would be expected
in 662 days of IceCube data. This estimate compares well with the two
observed events IC14 and IC20. Even taking this only as an order-of-
magnitude indication of the expected event rate, a higher-resolution
follow-up study of these objects is of great interest. Here, we present
such an analysis using six years of data from the ANTARES neutrino
telescope.

2 Target blazars and possible neutrino fluxes

The six blazars associated with the IC14 and IC20 fields by Krauß
et al. [2014] are listed in Table 1. All exhibit prominent high-energy
photon emission, and all but one are classified as flat-spectrum radio
quasars (FSRQs) [Véron-Cetty & Véron, 2006]. The predictions of the
expected number of detected electron neutrino events were made by
assuming a neutrino energy Eν = 1 PeV and a flavour-uniform flux,
with total energy flux equal to that in high-energy photons. Active
galactic nuclei (AGN) of all classes have long been proposed as sites of
hadronic interaction, and are potential sources of the highest-energy
cosmic rays and, hence, neutrinos [Berezinskii & Smirnov, 1975, Hillas,
1984, Stecker & Salamon, 1996, Padovani & Resconi, 2014]. Predictions
for the neutrino flux depend on the nature of the AGN considered, the
cosmic-ray composition and flux, and the assumed densities of target
hadronic matter and magnetic and photon fields [Szabo & Protheroe,
1994, Mannheim, 1995, Waxman & Bahcall, 1999, Atoyan & Dermer,
2001, Kelner et al., 2006, Becker Tjus et al., 2014, Dermer et al., 2014].

The emphasis on the two PeV events [IC14 and IC20; see Aartsen
et al., 2014b, for a full list] comes from the fact that these two highest-
energy events have only a negligible probability for an atmospheric ori-
gin. While IC14 and IC20 are assumed to be νe charged-current (CC)
events, and the most common production mechanism (photo-pion pro-
duction) produces a flux which is almost uniform in neutrino flavour
at Earth, a flavour-dependent flux is predicted by different initial neu-
trino production mechanisms [Kistler et al., 2014, Anchordoqui, 2015],
and/or by invoking new physics during propagation [Beacom et al.,
2003, and references therein].

The IceCube observations allow for the possibility of a sub-PeV
flux of neutrinos from the sample blazars, in that four other events
are positionally associated with the blazar sample (see Table 1). This

1The paper was released before the third PeV event, IC35 (‘Big Bird’), was made
public. A search for possible blazar associations with this event is in preparation by the
TANAMI Collaboration.

is also consistent with the prediction of two νe charged-current (CC)
events, since the low flavour-dependence of the IceCube HESE effec-
tive area at the highest energies means an equal number of νµ and
ντ events would be expected from a flavour-uniform flux, but with a
lower deposited energy. IceCube data are currently compatible with a
flavour-uniform flux above 35 TeV [IceCube Collaboration et al., 2015],
but a significant excess or deficit of track-like (mostly νµ CC) events
in the cosmic diffuse flux cannot be excluded. Thus while these addi-
tional four events do not represent a significant excess above a diffuse
background, the possibility that they may originate from the blazars

pected sensitivity

ANTARES is an underwater neutrino telescope located in the Mediter-
ranean Sea off the coast of Toulon, at 42◦48′ N, 6◦10′ E [Ageron et al.,
2011]. Consisting of an array of photomultiplier tubes, it is designed
to record the induced Cherenkov light from the passage of energetic
charged particles to infer the interactions of neutrinos.

The ANTARES candidate list search (CLS) methodology is de-
scribed in Adrián-Mart́ınez et al. [2012], with the latest results using
six years of data (1338 days effective livetime) presented in Adrián-
Mart́ınez et al. [2014a]. The search uses only up-going muons (i.e.,
those originating from below the horizon), with cuts placed on the fit
quality of the muon track reconstruction and the estimated angular
error. The long range of relativistic muons in seawater and the Earth’s
crust extends the effective detection volume to well beyond the phys-
ical size of the detector, in contrast with a HESE-like analysis. The
six-year sample consists of 5516 events, with an estimated atmospheric
muon contamination of 10%, and an estimated median angular resolu-
tion of 0.38◦. A maximum-likelihood method is then used to estimate
the relative contributions of signal and background fluxes, based on
both the reconstructed event arrival directions and the fitted number
of photon hits (a robust proxy for energy). We note that this method
results in a non-integer number of signal events Nsig being estimated,
since the signal and background fluxes maximising the likelihood of a
given observation can take any normalisation. We also note that it is
optimised assuming an E−2ν source spectrum, and it is sensitive almost
exclusively to muon neutrinos. The ability of the ANTARES CLS to
constrain the origin of the IceCube events is therefore dependent on
the flavour ratio, which may vary according to the neutrino-production
scenarios discussed in Sect. 2. Hereafter, sensitivities and limits will be
shown for a uniform flavour ratio, from which results for non-uniform

flavour fluxes can readily be derived.
The ability of the ANTARES CLS to probe the PeV-neutrino blazar-

origin hypotheses of Krauß et al. [2014] can be seen from Fig. 1,
which compares the time-integrated, flavour-averaged exposures of the
ANTARES CLS (Adrián-Mart́ınez et al. [2014a]; 1338 days, using one
third of the effective area to muon neutrinos) at the characteristic de-
clinations of the six blazars considered here, to that of the IceCube
HESE analysis, averaged over the southern hemisphere (IceCube Col-
laboration [2013]; now updated to 998 days by Aartsen et al. [2014b],
averaged over all three neutrino flavours). It can be seen that below
approximately 100 TeV, ANTARES has a greater sensitivity to a neu-
trino flux from the six blazars at the given southern declinations than
the recent IceCube HESE analysis.

The predictions for the number of IceCube-detected PeV neutrino
events by Krauß et al. [2014] were based on equating the neutrino flux
at 1 PeV to the integrated photon flux between 1 keV and 10 GeV.
While the expected neutrino-flux shape is highly model-dependent (as
was discussed in Sect. 2), the prediction that the total neutrino energy
flux Fν (GeV cm

−2 s−1) is approximately equal to the total high-
energy photon flux Fγ is relatively robust, at least when attributing
this emission to a 100% hadronic origin. The black-dashed line in Fig.
1 is proportional to neutrino energy Eν and normalised to the IceCube

flux Fν . For constant Fν , it is clear that the IceCube HESE analysis
is most sensitive to a flux at a few hundred TeV, while the ANTARES
CLS is most sensitive near 30 TeV.

The range of potential neutrino spectra, Φν(Eν) (dNν/dEν), are
characterised by generic power-law spectra with spectral index −sν :

The relative numbers of events expected to be observed by ANTARES
compared to IceCube for such spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (right). The
required energy in such fluxes to produce a single detectable event in
ANTARES is calculated in Appendix A, and plotted in Fig. 2 (online
only). In the range −2.5 < −sν < −1.5 , it is comparable with the
total blazar photon flux calculated by Krauß et al. [2014] (see Table
1).

Having established a wide range of plausible neutrino flux scenarios,
and the sensitivity of the ANTARES CLS to neutrino fluxes over a
broad range of energies, we therefore perform the standard ANTARES
CLS for an excess of neutrino emission from the six candidate blazars.

4 Results and discussion

The results of the ANTARES analysis of the six blazars are given in
Table 4. For four of the six targets, no source-like neutrinos were iden-
tified (Nsig = 0), allowing relatively strong upper limits to be placed on

an E−2ν flux. Blazars 1653−329 and 1714−336 were each fitted as hav-
ing approximately one nearby signal-like event, with Nsig of 1.1 and 0.9
respectively2. This observation is well within the expected background
fluctuations, however, with pre-trial p-values (probability of the likeli-
hood procedure fitting a stronger signal flux to background-only data)
of 0.10 and 0.04, respectively3. Nonetheless, it must be noted that
these two blazars have the highest predicted neutrino fluxes, and that
from Fig. 1 (right), neutrino fluxes with spectral indices between −2.5
and −2.3 producing one IceCube event would be expected to produce
between one and two ANTARES events. Therefore, when the calcula-
tion of Krauß et al. [2014] is extended to include power-law neutrino
spectra, the result of the analysis is consistent with the sample blazars
being neutrino sources with fluxes in proportion to their observed high-
energy photon flux (Fγ in Table 1), even if the result is also consistent
with background.

Limits at a 90% confidence level (C.L.), Φ90ν , on the spectra from
Eq. 1 are generated from the ANTARES observations as a function of
sν over the approximate predicted range (between 1.5 and 2.5), using
the method of Neyman [1937]. All are upper limits and are given in
Fig. 3 (left) (online only). The confidence level is given at 100 TeV,
because it is both the approximate energy at which the ANTARES
and IceCube analyses have equal exposures and where the flux limit is
least sensitive to sν .

The flux limits correspond to a maximum expected number N90ν,IC
of events observed by IceCube; where this number is less than the

cussed in Sect. 3.

here, and 55 trials from other analyses using the CLS [Adrián-Mart́ınez et al., 2014a,b]

number of IceCube events of blazar origin, using the exposures shown in
Fig. 1 and the limiting fluxes. Since the limits from 0235−618, 0302−623,

limits also apply to the summed flux from all three of these blazars, and
hence only one line is shown, and is labelled ‘IC20 TANAMI blazars’.

observed number of events, a blazar origin can be excluded at 90%
C.L. This is shown in Fig. 3 (right) (online only). Any given number
of IceCube events is therefore only consistent with a blazar origin for
neutrino spectral indices flatter than certain value; minimum values of
−sν are given for 1–4 events in Table 4 and should be compared to the
possible associations in Table 1. For the IC14 field for instance, the
possibility that blazar 1759−396 could be responsible for three or more
associated IceCube events is excluded at 90% confidence for neutrino
spectra steeper than −2.1. For spectra steeper than −2.4, we can ex-
clude that 1759−396 is responsible for any IceCube events. The limits
for 1653−329 and 1714−336 are weaker because of a possible physical
association with the two signal-like ANTARES events. Regardless of
the association, we can rule out the possibility that the cluster IC14,
IC2, and IC25 arose from a single considered blazar with a spectrum
steeper than −2.4. For the IC20 grouping, the non-observation of
any event from the three candidate blazars means that the δ ≈ −61◦
limit applies both to the individual blazars, and the group as a whole.
Therefore, ANTARES observations can rule out a neutrino spectrum
steeper than −2.2 as being responsible for both IC20 and IC7, and a
neutrino spectrum steeper than −2.4 being responsible for only one
of them. That is, if IC20 does indeed originate from the three asso-
ciated TANAMI blazars, the neutrino spectral index must be flatter
than −2.4.

5 Conclusion

We have tested the hypothesis of Krauß et al. [2014] that the first
two PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube, IC14 and IC20, are of
blazar origin, by performing a candidate list search (CLS) for an excess
muon neutrino flux from the six suggested blazars using six years of
ANTARES data. We are not able to either confirm or rule out a blazar
origin of these events, although constraints have been placed on the
range of source spectra which could have produced them, particularly
in the case of IC20. These constraints assume that muon neutrinos
constitute one third of the neutrino flux, and strengthen or weaken
proportionally with this fraction. While approximately two ANTARES
events were fitted as being more signal-like than background-like by
the maximum-likelihood analysis, such a result is completely within
the expected background fluctuations, with pre-trial p-values of 10%
and 4% for the blazars in question (1653−329 and 1714−336). It is
interesting to note that these two blazars were predicted by Krauß
et al. [2014] to have the strongest neutrino flux, and that such a result
is within expectations for the ANTARES event rate for an E−2ν to
E−2.3ν neutrino spectrum given that IceCube observes two such events,
and E−2.3ν to E

−2.5
ν for a single event of blazar origin. Given these

considerations, the TANAMI candidate blazars should be included in
all future analyses.

A Calculation of neutrino energy flux

For each spectral index −sν and source declination δ, the required
neutrino flux Φ∗ν(Eν , δ) expected to produce a single ANTARES event
can be found from the expression∫ ∞

where Aeff(Eν , δ) and teff are respectively the ANTARES effective area

infinite, the energy over the sensitive range of ANTARES can be cal-
culated by defining characteristic energies Emin(δ, sν) and Emax(δ, sν)
such that: ∫ Emax
