Abstract

The ANTARES detector is at present the most sensitive neutrino
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. The highly significant cosmic
neutrino excess observed by the Antarctic IceCube detector can be
studied with ANTARES, exploiting its complementing field of view,
exposure, and lower energy threshold. Searches for an all-flavor dif-
fuse neutrino signal, covering 9 years of ANTARES data taking, are
presented in this letter. Upward-going events are used to reduce the
atmospheric muon background. This work includes for the first time
in ANTARES both track-like (mainly νµ) and shower-like (mainly
νe) events in this kind of analysis. Track-like events allow for an
increase of the effective volume of the detector thanks to the long
path traveled by muons in rock and/or sea water. Shower-like events
are well reconstructed only when the neutrino interaction vertex is
close to, or inside, the instrumented volume. A mild excess of high-
energy events over the expected background is observed in 9 years of
ANTARES data in both samples. The best fit for a single power-law
cosmic neutrino spectrum, in terms of per-flavor flux at 100 TeV, is
Φ

1f
0 (100 TeV) = (1.7± 1.0)×10

−18 GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1 with spectral
index Γ = 2.4+0.5−0.4. The null cosmic flux assumption is rejected with a
significance of 1.6σ.

Introduction - A diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos – here, and in the rest of
this paper, the world neutrino refers to both ν and ν̄ – might originate from
the ensemble of unresolved sources, too faint to be individually detected,
and/or from the interactions of high-energy Cosmic Rays (CRs) as they
propagate over cosmic distances. CRs can produce neutrinos when they
inelastically interact on nucleons or photons. In the first case, the so-called
pp reaction, a large amount of secondaries is produced, including also short-
lived mesons decaying into neutrinos [1]; the second case is described by
photo-production processes, where the pγ reaction produces a ∆-resonance
which gives pions. Neutrinos and γ-rays originate in the decay chain of these

3



mesons [2]. High energy photons, however, can interact with thermal protons
and photons. These processes, in turn, create photons of lower energies,
distorting the original γ-ray spectrum. Neutrinos are weakly interacting
particles and consequently do not suffer from significant absorption processes
due to the presence of matter and radiation fields. Thus, their spectral
energy distribution is not degraded.

The observation of a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos, i.e. the measure-
ment of its spectrum and flavor composition, would provide information
on the CR production, acceleration and interaction properties. Neutrinos
should follow the energy spectrum of their parent CRs, ∝ E−Γ with Γ ∼ 2
according to the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism [3]. Under the as-
sumption that neutrinos are produced in charged meson decays, their flux
at the source has a flavor composition as νe : νµ : ντ = 1 : 2 : 0. Vacuum
oscillations over cosmic distances produce equipartition in the three flavors
at Earth.

Searches for a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos by the IceCube collab-
oration have yielded the observation of an excess of events over the ex-
pected atmospheric background [4, 5, 6]. The measured flux can be mod-
eled with a single power law dNν/dEν = Φ0E

−Γ
ν . Assuming an isotropic

astrophysical neutrino flux at Earth in flavor equipartition, the best-fit
spectral index is Γ = 2.50 ± 0.09 and the normalization at 100 TeV is

10−19 GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1 and Γ = 2.13 ± 0.13 [6]. The latter is sensitive
to neutrinos of energies larger than 100 TeV because of the more abundant
atmospheric background, while the former, all-flavor searches, have lower
energy thresholds. The tension between the two measurements could hint
at multiple cosmic contributions to the IceCube signal [7].

The ANTARES telescope [8] can provide valuable information on the
study of this signal, especially in the case of the presence of a Galactic con-
tribution. Because of its lower energy threshold, ANTARES can constrain
such a contribution, which is expected to be more intense at lower energies
with respect to extragalactic signals. This applies both for point-like sources
[9] and for extended emission regions [10, 11]. Past searches for a diffuse
flux of cosmic neutrinos with ANTARES data were below the sensitivity for
detecting a signal at the level of the flux observed by IceCube [12, 13, 14].
The analysis presented in this letter is based on improved reconstruction
techniques and, for the first time, on an all-flavor search. The livetime of

4



the analyzed data sample is also largely extended with respect to previous
analyses.

Detector and data sample - The ANTARES underwater neutrino tele-
scope [8] is located 40 km off-shore Toulon, France, in the Mediterranean
Sea (42◦ 48′ N, 6◦ 10′ E). It consists of a three-dimensional array of 10-inch
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) distributed along 12, 450 m long, vertical
lines, anchored to the sea-bed at a depth of about 2500 m and kept taut by
a top buoy.

Neutrino detection is based on the observation of Cherenkov light in-
duced in the medium by relativistic charged particles. Cherenkov photons
can produce signals in the PMTs (“hits”). The position, time and collected
charge of the hits are used to infer the direction and energy of the incident
neutrino. Triggers based on combinations of local coincidences are applied
to discard events produced by environmental light emitters like inorganic
40K decays and organic bioluminescence [15].

Charged Current (CC) interactions of muon neutrinos produce a track
signature in the detector. For these events, a median angular resolution as
low as 0.4◦ is achieved [9]. All-flavor Neutral Current (NC) as well as νe and
ντ CC interactions produce electromagnetic and hadronic showers with an
almost point-like emission of Cherenkov photons. These events are recon-
structed when the neutrino interacts close to, or inside, the instrumented
volume [16] with a median angular resolution of the order of 3◦ and a rela-
tive energy resolution as low as 10% in the case of CC νe interactions above
some tens of TeV.

Data collected from 2007 to 2015 are considered, corresponding to an
equivalent livetime of 2450 days. In order to avoid biases in the optimization
of the event selection, the analysis follows a blind policy, according to which
all cuts are optimized on Monte Carlo only, with 10% of the data used to
check the agreement with simulations. Since the data acquisition conditions
in the deep sea are variable, the simulation of the apparatus follows the
data-taking conditions [17].

Search method - The search strategy follows a two-step procedure. First,
an event selection chain is defined to overcome the large background of at-
mospheric muons. Second, since the cosmic signal has a harder energy spec-
trum and becomes more intense than the atmospheric one at high energies,
an energy-related selection maximizes the sensitivity of the search. Thus,
the Model Rejection Factor (MRF) procedure [18] based on the Feldman
and Cousins upper limit estimation [19] is applied.

An isotropic flux over the whole sky is assumed for cosmic neutrinos,
equally distributed into the three neutrino flavors and between ν and ν̄, and

5



with single power law energy spectrum. Two possible spectral indexes are
considered for the optimization of the event selection: Γ = 2.0 and Γ = 2.5.

The most abundant background comes from penetrating atmospheric
muons reaching the apparatus. The MUPAGE simulation code [20, 21]
is used to produce samples of atmospheric muon bundles deep underwater.
The Earth can be used as a shield to reduce the influence of these muons, by
discarding events that are reconstructed as downward-going. Nonetheless, a
certain amount of atmospheric muon events could still be mis-reconstructed
as upward-going. A selection based on the event reconstruction quality
parameters (see below) allows for a significant reduction of their amount.

Atmospheric neutrinos are produced together with muons and cannot
be shielded by the Earth. Two spectral components contribute to the total
atmospheric neutrino flux, namely the conventional and the prompt compo-
nent. The former comes from neutrinos produced in the decays of pions and
kaons; the latter originates from the decays of charmed hadrons. Charmed
hadrons are much shorter-lived than pions and kaons and they almost imme-
diately decay, producing a harder neutrino energy spectrum. In this work,
the conventional component is described according to the calculations in
Ref. [22], while the prompt component follows the prescription of Ref. [23].
Different assumptions in the description of atmospheric neutrino fluxes are
accounted for as systematic effects.

Track-like events are reconstructed through a multi-step procedure based
on likelihood fits [9] using hits registered by the PMTs. The discrimina-
tion between downward-going atmospheric muons and high-energy neutrino
induced events is accomplished by applying, a priori, a cut on the recon-

structed zenith angle (θtrack > 90◦). Neutrino induced events are then
selected against wrongly reconstructed muons, keeping events with low an-
gular error estimate and good track quality parameter [24]. An energy-
related variable such as the number of hits used in the track reconstruction
is considered as well to reduce the number of background events. The re-
sulting atmospheric neutrino rate in the track channel is about 1 event/day,
with a contamination from atmospheric muons below the percent level in
this sample.

Since the energy cannot be directly measured in the case of CC νµ track-
like events, a proxy for the event energy must be used. An algorithm based
on Artificial Neural Networks [25] is used for this purpose. Figure 1 (top)
shows the energy estimator distribution for the selected neutrino sample.
The vertical line and arrow show the optimal selection cut obtained with the
MRF procedure. Above the cut value EANN > 5, a total of 13.5 background

6



neutrino events are expected, and about 3 – 3.5 events should be produced
by an IceCube-like signal. This depends on the spectral index and flux
normalization resulting from the different best-fit values described above.

The event selection chain described in Ref. [16] is used in this work to
obtain a high-purity sample of shower-like events. No explicit veto on atmo-
spheric events is applied; events reconstructed up to 10◦ above the horizon
are considered and events entering into the final track-like sample are ex-
cluded. The muon-rejecting procedure leaves about 8×10−3 atmospheric
muons per day in the sample. The resulting atmospheric neutrino rate
in the shower channel is 0.1 events/day. However, the rejection of atmo-
spheric muon events is more difficult at the highest energies, where the con-
tamination is larger. The final selection is obtained after rejecting events
with reconstructed shower energy below 20 TeV. This value arises from the
MRF optimization to obtain the best sensitivity to the IceCube cosmic neu-
trino signal flux. The reconstructed shower energy distribution is shown in
Fig. 1 (bottom). After the energy-related selection, 10.5 background events
(6.5 neutrinos and 4 atmospheric muons) are expected. Assuming a cosmic

flux proportional to E−2 (E−2.5) with normalization Φ

0 (100 TeV) = 10

−18

(1.5×10−18) GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1, compatible with the flux measured in Ref.
[5, 6], 3 (3.5) signal events are expected.

Results - The unblinding of the two samples yields a total of 33 events (19
tracks and 14 showers), as shown in Fig. 1. The expectation from Monte
Carlo simulations for the background is 24 events (13.5 tracks and 10.5
showers), with an estimated uncertainty of ±7 events. The uncertainties
related to the atmospheric neutrino fluxes, to the detector efficiency and
to the water properties have been accounted for. A ±25% uncertainty on
the normalization of the conventional atmospheric neutrino component is
considered [26]; the highest and lowest predictions from the computations of
Ref. [23] have been used as uncertainty on the prompt component. It should
be noted that IceCube measurements strongly constrain the predictions of
prompt neutrino fluxes [6]. The effect of the H3a [27] model of the CR
energy spectrum and composition around the knee is also considered.

Uncertainties on the background due to wrongly reconstructed atmo-
spheric muons are taken into account, allowing for changes in the normal-
ization by ±40% [28]. The effect is negligible in the track channel, because
of the low contamination in this sample, but represents around 50% of the
total uncertainty on the background for shower-like events.

Finally, the effect of the uncertainty on the detector response on sig-
nal and background is evaluated by varying input parameters in the Monte

Carlo simulations. Water properties and the efficiency of the optical mod-
ules are varied according to the known uncertainties on the values used for
the simulation. The corresponding effect is around 20% at high energies and
induces a change of shape in the energy estimation, accounted for in the fit-
ting procedure presented below. The overall uncertainty on the background
coming from all the effects mentioned above is of the order of ±4 events
for each sample. Uncertainties coming from independent sources are added
in quadrature in the overall estimation, while correlated uncertainties are
summed-up linearly.

Once these effects are taken into account, the observation can be trans-
lated into a 68% confidence interval (C.I.) and a 90% confidence level (C.L.)
upper limit (U.L.) according to the method of Ref. [29]. The results are re-
ported in Table 1, together with the sensitivity of the analysis as estimated
from the MRF procedure. These limits and sensitivities are valid in the
energy range 40 TeV – 7 PeV (30 TeV – 1.5 PeV) for spectral index Γ = 2.0
(2.5), where 90% of the combined track and shower signal is expected. The
observed excess does not translate into a significant observation of a cosmic
signal, even though a null cosmic flux hypothesis can be excluded at 85%
C.L. .

The observed distributions of the energy estimators, after the final se-
lection, are fitted using a maximum-likelihood method as done in Ref. [5].
Monte Carlo simulations are used to create templates of the cosmic signal
and of the atmospheric backgrounds, considering different normalizations
and spectral indexes for the signal. Binned distributions of energy estima-
tors of data and of the Monte Carlo templates are considered. The final

9



likelihood L is given by the product of the individual likelihoods Li,S com-
puted for each bin i of the energy estimator distribution for the shower (sh)
and track (tr) samples S separately. The distribution of data and templates
are compared considering Poisson statistics, with a Gaussian penalty factor
to account for systematic effects on the Monte Carlo input parameters τ∗j :

where µi is the expected number of events in the i-th bin from the simulated
templates, NS is the number of bins in the energy estimator histogram for
each event sample and ki,S is the number of events observed in data for
that event sample in that bin. The nuisance parameters τi,S,j considered
here are: the atmospheric neutrino background normalization; the resid-
ual atmospheric muon background, relevant in the shower analysis only;
an energy-scale shift, which can be produced by the uncertainty on wa-
ter properties and optical module efficiencies, as well as on the response of
the PMTs. The considered effects modify the expected µi in the simulated
templates analogously to what has been reported above. The atmospheric
normalization is fitted simultaneously for the two samples, assuming that
the background fluxes should follow the same modeling. The possible energy
shift is considered separately for cascades and tracks. The 2D log-likelihood
profile, after having fixed the nuisance parameters to the best-fit values, is
shown in Fig. 2. The 68% and 90% C.L. contours from this analysis are
shown together with the best-fit results from IceCube analyses.

The likelihood profile shows a flat minimum region, which does not al-
low for constraining significantly the properties of the cosmic signal, but
excludes extremely hard spectra or intense fluxes. The best-fit cosmic flux
from ANTARES data yields a single-flavor normalization at 100 TeV of
Φ

0 (100 TeV) = (1.7± 1.0)× 10

−18 GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1 and a spectral in-
dex Γ = 2.4+0.5−0.4, when profiling the likelihood at the 68% C.L. . The best-fit
value for the atmospheric neutrino normalization is 25% higher than the
Monte Carlo simulations according to the predictions of Ref. [22], as also
observed in Ref. [30]. This agrees with the event rates observed below the
analysis energy threshold, where the sample is dominated by atmospheric
events. An energy scale shift of −0.12 in the logarithm of the shower energy
estimator provides the best-fit results; for the track energy estimator, a null
shift is found. The same results are found when fitting the low-energy part

Figure 2: 2D log-likelihood scan of the diffuse cosmic flux normalization and
spectral index. The 68% and 90% confidence contours are shown as black
lines. The empty circle is the best-fit point from this analysis, compared to
the IceCube best fits from the all-sky combined analysis [5] (full square) and
the diffuse flux analysis using tracks [6] (full triangle). The color gradient
represents the log-likelihood difference with respect to the best-fit point.

of the energy distributions only, under the assumption that a cosmic signal
would not be visible there.

Both IceCube best-fit points lie in the 68% C.L. contour of this analy-
sis. Not shown here are the 68% C.L. contours from Ref. [5] and [6], which
would also entirely be inside the 68% C.L. contour depicted in Fig. 2. The
hypothesis of a null cosmic flux is excluded at 1.6σ, assuming the best-fit
hypothesis in a likelihood-ratio test. Even though this significance is not
large, this result leans towards the observation of a cosmic neutrino flux
compatible with the one observed in the IceCube data.
