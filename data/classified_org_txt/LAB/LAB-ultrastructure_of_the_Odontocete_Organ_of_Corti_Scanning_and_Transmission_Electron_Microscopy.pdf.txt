ABSTRACT
The morphological study of the Odontocete organ of Corti,

together with possible alterations associated with damage

from sound exposure, represents a key conservation

approach to assess the effects of acoustic pollution on

marine ecosystems. By collaborating with stranding net-

works from several European countries, 150 ears from 13

species of Odontocetes were collected and analyzed by

scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron micros-

copy. Based on our analyses, we first describe and compare

Odontocete cochlear structures and then propose a diag-

nostic method to identify inner ear alterations in stranded

individuals. The two species analyzed by TEM (Phocoena

phocoena and Stenella coeruleoalba) showed morphological

characteristics in the lower basal turn of high-frequency

hearing species. Among other striking features, outer hair

cell bodies were extremely small and were strongly

attached to Deiters cells. Such morphological characteris-

tics, shared with horseshoe bats, suggest that there has

been convergent evolution of sound reception mechanisms

among echolocating species. Despite possible autolytic arti-

facts due to technical and experimental constraints, the

SEM analysis allowed us to detect the presence of scarring

processes resulting from the disappearance of outer hair

cells from the epithelium. In addition, in contrast to the

rapid decomposition process of the sensory epithelium

after death (especially of the inner hair cells), the tectorial

membrane appeared to be more resistant to postmortem

autolysis effects. Analysis of the stereocilia imprint pattern

at the undersurface of the tectorial membrane may provide

a way to detect possible ultrastructural alterations of the

hair cell stereocilia by mirroring them on the tectorial mem-

brane. J. Comp. Neurol. 000:000–000, 2014.

The ecological and physiological significance of noise

effects on toothed whales (order Cetacea, suborder

Odontoceti) has recently been recognized (Richardson

et al., 1995) because of their vital dependence on

acoustic information and their role as apex marine

predators. Although some of the physiological damage

caused by sound has been observed in organs not

directly related to the acoustic pathways (Jepson et al.,

2003), most lesions are expected to affect hearing, par-

ticularly the organ of Corti and its associated hair cells

(Lurie et al., 1944).

In previous studies on terrestrial mammals, structural

alterations of the organ of Corti have been found as a

consequence of sound exposure. These consist of: 1)

changes in the hair cell stereocilia (mainly fusion, size

reduction, buckling, formation of “giant” hairs, and dis-

appearance of hairs; Bredberg et al., 1972; Engstrom

et al., 1984); 2) degeneration of sensory cells (karyor-

rhexis, karyopyknosis, and necroptosis; Hu et al.,

2000); 3) increased numbers of synaptic vesicles in

medial efferent nerve endings and swelling of the affer-

ent nerve endings on the inner hair cells (IHCs) with

incipient retrograde nerve degeneration (Spoendlin,

1971); and in more severe cases, 4) complete degener-

ation of the organ of Corti (Bredberg et al., 1972). At

the level of the tectorial membrane, morphological

changes on the outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia

imprints have also been shown (Morisaki et al., 1991)

after acoustic overstimulation. These changes are coin-

cident with a transformation from circular to oval or

irregular shape, fusion of adjacent concavities to form a

larger concavity, and occasionally the appearance of fil-

amentous material. Such modification of the imprints

has remained for as long as a year, after sensory hairs

have disappeared.

Cetaceans include the suborder odontocetes, or

toothed whales, comprising approximately 80 different

species. Their adaptation to the marine environment has

led to the evolution of an echolocation system (Au, 1993;

Thomson and Richardson, 1995; Ketten, 2000) that oper-

ates at very high frequencies (20–180 kHz), which they

use for orientation, foraging, and probably communica-

tion among members of the same social group.

Previous morphological studies on the odontocete

inner ear by light microscopy can be found in the litera-

ture. A detailed description of cochlear morphology was

conducted for the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus

(Wever et al., 1971a–c) and the Pacific white-sided dol-

phin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens (Wever et al., 1972).

Also, cochlear fibers in diverse species (Gao and Zhou,

1992), as well as features of the basilar membrane and

osseous spiral lamina in different odontocete species

have been compared and related to their hearing capa-

bilities (Ketten and Wartzok, 1990; Ketten, 1992, 1994,

2000). However, ultrastructural descriptions of hearing

structures in odontocete species using electron micros-

copy are still lacking, primarily due to the difficulty of

obtaining suitable quality material and reliable protocols

for analysis.

Detailed characterizations of the organ of Corti in

echolocating horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus rouxi) using

scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron micros-

copy have been published (Vater and Lenoir, 1992;

Vater et al., 1992; Vater and K€ossl, 2011). Special fea-

tures of the very high frequency hearing species were

described, such as the very robust attachment between

the OHC cuticular plates and the Deiters cells, and the

very well developed cup formation of the Deiters cell

bodies that house the bottom of the OHC. Because of

the similar functionality of the biosonar in bats, we

focused on the same hearing structures in odontocetes

to investigate possible morphological similarities among

these echolocating species, using both SEM and TEM.

The objectives of this study were 1) to describe

structural features of the organ of Corti in several odon-

tocete species that can be further correlated with their

respective hearing sensitivities; and 2) to conduct a

morphological analysis of the cochlea to investigate

possible structural alterations as a consequence of

sound exposure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Extraction and fixation
A total of 150 ears from 13 odontocete species (Pho-

coena phocoena, n 5 71; Stenella coeruleoalba, n 5 30;

Stenella frontalis, n 5 12; Tursiops truncatus n 5 9; Del-

phinus delphis, n 5 11; Kogia simus, n 5 2; Kogia brevi-

ceps, n 5 3; Globicephala macrorhynchus, n 5 1;

Globicephala melas, n 5 3; Steno bredanensis; n 5 2;

Lagenodelphis hosei, n 5 1; Hyperoodon ampullatus,

n 5 2; and Ziphius cavirostris, n 5 2) that stranded in the

Mediterranean Sea, Spanish North Atlantic, and North

Sea were extracted following the protocol presented at

the European Cetacean Society Conference in Istanbul

(Morell and Andr�e, 2009), and adopted at the Necropsy

Workshop, Liège, 2009 (see Table T11 for more details).

After extraction, the samples were fixed with 10%

buffered formalin or 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phos-

phate buffer (pH 7.3–7.4). Thirty-six were perfused

through the oval and round window replacing the peril-

ymph with the fixative solution.

Decalcification
Because cetacean cochleas are surrounded by very

dense periotic bone, it is necessary to decalcify the

samples to gain access to inner ear structures.

Although different solutions were tested (Table 1), most

samples were decalcified by using the commercial

agent RDO
VR

(Apex Engineering Products, Aurora, IL) as

described in Morell et al. (2009). RDO is a rapid decal-

cifier based on hydrochloric acid. Depending on the

tympanic–periotic complex volume (Morell et al., 2007),

it can take from a few hours to a few days to decalcify

the bone tissue. Better control of the decalcification

endpoint was obtained by using 50% RDO (diluted in

distilled water) and changing to 25% RDO after 24

hours (Morell et al., 2009). Other samples were decalci-

fied by using 14% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid

(EDTA) tetrasodium salt at pH 7.4 and 7.6 either at

room temperature (changing the solution once per

week; Callis and Sterchi, 1998) or in a microwave oven

(Leica [Nussloch, Germany] AM AMW, 45�C, 30 W, at

the Regional Center for Cellular Imaging Resources

(CRIC), Montpellier, France; and a Milestone [Shelton,

CT] Ethos Plus, 45�C, at the Technical Research Service

of Girona University, Spain).

Transmission electron microscopy
Only the freshest samples that were perfused with

2.5% glutaraldehyde with 0.1 M phosphate buffer were

used for morphological description by TEM. These were

completely decalcified, and the endpoint was deter-

mined by using the weight loss/weight gain procedure

(Mawhinney et al., 1984; Hornbeck et al., 1986; Sand-

erson et al., 1995) and X-ray imaging. Specifically, the

TEM samples presented here were taken from: 1) an

adult striped dolphin (S. coeruleoalba) ear recovered in

the North of Spain, fixed for 5 hours and 30 minutes

postmortem and perfused with the same fixative solu-

tion 9 hours postmortem 2) a juvenile harbor porpoise

(P. phocoena) stranded on the Belgian coast, perfused

with fixative 22 hours and 10 minutes postmortem 3)

an adult harbor porpoise perfused for at least 3 hours

and 15 minutes postmortem 4) a neonate harbor por-

poise perfused for less than 4 hours postmortem and

5) a juvenile harbor porpoise perfused for less than 12

hours postmortem (Table 1). Individuals 3, 4, and 5

were stranded on The Netherlands coast.

The samples from individuals 1–3 were postfixed for

1 hour with buffered 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated

with increasing concentrations of ethanol, and embed-

ded in EPON resin by using an automatic microwave tis-

sue processor (Leica AM AMW) for electron

microscopy. Semithin sections were examined under a

light microscope and ultrathin sections under the Hita-

chi H-7100 TEM (at CRIC, Montpellier, France).

The samples from individuals 4 and 5 were postfixed

with 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with increasing

concentrations of ethanol, and then embedded in

SPURR resin using a Pelco (Ted Pella, Redding, CA)

microwave. Semithin and ultrathin sections were cut,

and the latter were examined by using the Hitachi

H7600 TEM (University of British Columbia Bioimaging

Facility, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and the FEI Tecnai G2

Spirit (Department of Cellular and Physiological Scien-

ces, University of British Columbia).

Scanning electron microscopy
The decalcification of the periotic bone was stopped

when the vestibular scalae and the stria vascularis of

the cochlea were uncovered. A total of 64 cochleas

and their tectorial membranes were dissected, dehy-

drated through ethanol, critical point dried with CO2,

and then coated with gold–palladium (Table 1). The

samples were observed by SEM for morphological

description and for possible acoustic trauma assess-

ment. Imaging was done on a Hitachi S-3500N (at the

Institute of Marine Sciences, Spanish National Research

Council, Barcelona, Spain), a Hitachi S-4000 (at CRIC,

Montpellier, France), a Jeol JSM 5600 (at the Techno-

logical Center of Vilanova i la Geltr�u, Spain), a Hitachi

S-570 (at the Autonomous University of Barcelona,

Spain), and a Hitachi S-4700 (University of British

Columbia Bioimaging Facility).

Image processing
Brightness and contrast of images were adjusted in

Adobe (San Jose, CA) Photoshop CS3. Several dimen-

sions in the cochlear structures were measured (see

Fig.F1 1 for details), either by using specific tools in the

electron microscope software or in ImageJ
VR

.

RESULTS

This section presents the TEM and SEM analysis of

the general morphology of the organ of Corti. This

structure was typically formed by one row of IHCs and

three rows of OHCs. In a harbor porpoise, some addi-

tional OHCs were observed forming a fourth row in the

lower apical turn.

Transmission electron microscopy
The average cochlear dimensions based on TEM and

light microscopy analysis are presented in TablesT2 2 and

T3 3. FigureF2 2 shows reconstructions of the spiral course

of the basilar membrane performed with Adobe Illustra-

tor from SEM pictures, and indicates the positions that

were analyzed by TEM. The most interesting features of

each structure are presented below.

Basilar membrane
The basilar membrane (Fig. 1A,B) increased in width

(i.e., the distance between the foramen of the habenula

perforata and the spiral ligament) and decreased in

thickness toward the apex, being especially narrow and

thick in the lower basal turn. In striped dolphin, the

basilar membrane ranged from an average of 112 to

377 mm in width and 14 to 5 mm in thickness, while in
harbor porpoise the average values ranged from about

83 to 394 mm in width and 12 to 7 mm in thickness
(Table 2). Contrary to this general trend, in the harbor

porpoise the basilar membrane width ranged from 412

mm in the apex to 53 mm at approximately 3 mm from
the base, but increased again to 118 mm the first
2 mm. There was no information about the most basal

region of the cochlea in the striped dolphin (Fig. 2B).

Spiral ligament
The spiral ligament was large in the lower basal turn

(maximum of 359 mm in striped dolphin and 488 mm in
harbor porpoise; Fig.1A). Interestingly, it persisted up to

the apical turn in both species.

Sensory cells: outer hair cells.
The ultrastructure of the OHCs is illustrated in Figure F33.

Measurements of cell body length in over 60 OHCs

showed that OHCs of the lower basal turn (Fig. 3A)

were very small (striped dolphin: 9.96 mm; harbor

porpoise: 10.36 mm, with extreme values of 7.8 mm).
They reached a maximal length of 22.1 mm in the apical
turn of the striped dolphin and 18.47 in the upper api-

cal turn of the harbor porpoise. The OHCs were also

very narrow, increasing in diameter while approaching

the apex of the cochlea (from 5.2 to 13.1 mm in striped
dolphin and from 4 to 7.1 mm in the lower apical turn
in harbor porpoise).

Stereocilia and cuticular plates
Stereocilia were not very well preserved, and only par-

tial data could be extracted. They were generally of

very short length, being longer in the apical cochlear

end (1.8 mm in striped dolphin and harbor porpoise)
than in the lower basal turn (0.8 mm in harbor por-
poise). OHCs had three rows of stereocilia. Cuticular

plates of OHCs established tight junctions with the

outer pillar cells and phalangeal processes of the three

rows of Deiters cells. These attachment zones were

extremely long in the OHCs of the basal turn, forming

two “arms” (asterisks in Fig. 3A,C).

Subsurface cisternae
OHCs presented a single layer of subsurface cisternae

(white arrows in Fig. 3F), which started just below the

cuticular plate and continued down to the beginning of

the synaptic region, below the nucleus.

Sensory cells: inner hair cells
IHCs were very poorly preserved, and were only

observed in the lower apical turn in the striped dolphin

and in the lower basal turn in the harbor porpoise.

They presented the typical pear shape (Fig. 3E) with

a cuticular plate thickness of 1.57 mm. The tallest ster-
eocilia of these cells were 2.97 mm in length and
308 nm in diameter.

Supporting cells
Pillar and Deiters cells, especially at the base of the

cochlea, presented an extremely well-developed micro-

tubular cytoskeleton (Fig. 3A,G,H). The phalangeal pro-

cess of Deiters cells and outer pillar cells had

exaggerated long contact zones with the OHCs. This

feature was especially evident on the basal turn of

odontocete cochlea (asterisks in Fig. 3A,C).

The lower parts of the OHC bodies were completely

surrounded by a large cup formed by the Deiters cells.

The ultrastructure of the Deiters cup attachment is

shown for the lower basal turn in harbor porpoises

(black arrows in Fig. 3A). This feature was not observed

in apical locations as is the case in other mammalian

species like rats (Fig. 3B, courtesy of Marc Lenoir). In

ID: jwweb3b2server Time: 12:55 I Path: //xinchnasjn/01Journals/Wiley/3b2/CNE#/VOL00000/140141/APPFile/JW-CNE#140141



the lower basal turn of the cochlea, this cup reached

up to 45% of the total length of the OHCs.

Innervation
Along the entire cochlea of both odontocete species

that we analyzed, the OHCs were contacted by nerve

fibers, which passed between the Deiters cells. These

fibers were clearly identified as afferent fibers by the

abundant microtubule content of their cytoplasm (Fig.

F4 4C). In contrast, there were no signs of either vesicu-

lated terminals below OHCs or fibers crossing the

upper middle region of the tunnel of Corti, belonging to

the medial efferent system, in any of the cochlear

regions. Additionally, there were no remains of postsy-

naptic cisterns in the basal pole of the OHCs or medial

efferent terminals (Fig. 4A).

The nerve fibers of the inner spiral bundle (below

IHCs) showed many postmortem changes (Fig. 3E), with

complete loss of nerve terminals.

Morphometric information was extracted on the

nerve fibers passing in the habenula and spiral lamina,

including the diameter of the fibers, the thickness of

the myelin sheath, the number of myelin layers, and the

number of rows of nerve fibers (Table 3).

The density of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) was esti-

mated by manually counting the SGCs from many trans-

verse sections of different regions of the cochlear spiral

of known area, using light micrographs. The SGC den-

sity was expressed as the number of cells per 10,000

mm2 in Rosenthal’s canal. The data in Table 3 suggest

an increased density toward the apex, but when all

data were considered (not shown here) high variability

masked any clear tendency. However, the density of

SGC in harbor porpoises (from 6.8 to 8.1 SGCs/10,000

mm2) was systematically higher than in striped dolphin
(from 4.4 to 5.8 SGCs/10,000 mm2).

The SGCs were well preserved (Fig. 4D) and very

large in size in both species. In the striped dolphin,

they ranged from 37 to 46 mm at their longest axis,
and from 22.4 to 29.7 mm at their shortest axis. By
comparison, these dimensions measured 34.8–45 mm
and 22.2–25 mm, respectively, in the harbor porpoise.

Scanning electron microscopy
Surprisingly, the best preserved regions observed by

SEM in all cochleas were the apical end, apical turn,

and, in some cases, part of the upper basal turn. Con-

sequently, we present all results from these particular

locations. There were no significant differences among

the measurements of the apical poles of the sensory

and supporting cells within the different measured posi-

tions; thus, values in Table 4 are averaged.

Sensory cells: outer hair cells
The OHCs had narrow, wing-shaped cuticular plates

that ranged in length from 5.0 to 6.2 mm (Fig. F55A,B)
and were separated from each other by 500–880 nm

within a given row (Table 4). The innermost row (OHC1)

and the middle row (OHC2) were distinctly separated

by the large hexagonal heads of the outer pillar cells. In

contrast, there was very little space between the mid-

dle (OHC2) and the outermost (OHC3) rows of OHCs,

which were significantly different in both harbor por-

poise (P< 0.001) and striped dophin (P< 0.001).

The OHCs appeared to have three rows of stereocilia

(Fig. 5B), but more studies with better preserved sam-

ples should be conducted to confirm this result. Lateral

links between stereocilia were observed in some cases

(Fig. 5C). A few cells forming a fourth row of OHCs in

the apical region (Fig.F6 6B) were only found in one har-

bor porpoise.

The total number of OHCs was estimated taking into

account their average density (175.37 OHCs mm
21

of

cochlea for striped dolphin and 147.67 OHCs mm
21

for

harbor porpoise), and extrapolating it to all averaged

cochlear lengths (26.878 mm for striped dolphin and

24.813 mm for harbor porpoise). This resulted in a total

of 15,012 and 11,405 OHCs, respectively.

The cochlear length was calculated from flat SEM

images, performed along the limit of the first row of

OHCs with the inner pillar cells. The cochlear length

measurements of juvenile individuals were not taken

into account for this study.

Even though the samples were not well preserved, it

was possible to determine the shape of OHC cuticular

plates. It was also possible to determine whether scars

were present resulting from the growth of supporting

cells after the death of OHCs (Fig. 5D; see a schematic

of the scar formation process in Fig. 5F). Moreover, in

the case of one of the harbor porpoises, around 420

mm of the apical portion of the cochlea was full of
scars (Fig. 5E).

Sensory cells: inner hair cells
The IHCs were rarely well preserved in any of the sam-

ples analyzed. The IHC cuticular plates were of oval

shape (Fig. 6A). The average maximum length in striped

dolphin IHC was 8.4 mm, and 4.5 mm was the minimum
average length. In the harbor porpoise, the lengths

were 8.2 and 5.2 mm, respectively, and the IHCs were
found to be separated by 1.15 mm; this latter distance

was observed to be larger than the separation distance

of OHCs in the same row.

The total number of IHCs was estimated following

the same procedure as explained for the OHCs, result-

ing in a total of 3,127 IHCs in harbor porpoise.

Tectorial membrane
Despite the poor preservation of the organ of Corti, the

tectorial membrane was relatively well preserved. Figure

F77 shows the imprints of stereocilia that were found in

the tectorial membrane of different species. Even in a

sample of one of the bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon

ampullatus) where there were no remains of the organ

of Corti present in the sample, the imprints of the OHC

stereocilia were observable in the tectorial membrane

(Fig. 7C). By counting the number of imprints, it was

possible to estimate the number of the longer stereoci-

lia per OHC, and, assuming that each OHC contained

three rows of stereocilia (Fig. 5B), it was possible to

estimate the total number of stereocilia. This estimate

ranged from 130 to 168, depending on the species

(Table T55).

Impressions of the IHC stereocilia were detected in

the very basal partition of the tectorial membrane

(arrows in Fig. 7G,H) in one of the common dolphins.

DISCUSSION

Rapid postmortem decomposition of the organ of

Corti combined with the difficulty of obtaining very

“fresh” cochleas made our analysis challenging. In addi-

tion, decalcification artifacts could make data interpre-

tation difficult. Despite these potential problems, we

were able to describe, for the first time, the general

ultrastructure of the odontocete cochlea using electron

microscopy. This section will discuss our findings at

each structural level of the organ of Corti, based on

SEM and TEM observations and in the context of other

echolocating species of mammals.

Sensory cells
In general, the pear-shaped form of IHCs and the

cylindrical shape of OHCs in odontocete cochlea resem-

ble the typical forms of these receptor cells in other

mammals (see Lim, 1986 for review), although differen-

ces in dimensions of the OHCs deserve further com-

ment. Typically, OHCs in terrestrial mammals are

between 20 and 70 mm (Pujol et al., 1997). However,
the OHCs of echolocating bats are somewhat smaller:

12–15 mm at the base to 28–30 mm at the apex in the
horseshoe bat, a high-frequency hearing specialist

(Vater et al., 1992), and 8–15 mm in bicolored round-
leaf bats (Hipposideros bicolor; Dannhof and Bruns,

1991). Light microscope measurements revealed that

OHC length ranged from 8 to 17 mm in the bottlenose
dolphin (Wever et al., 1971a), from 10 to 22 mm in the
striped dolphin, and from 8 to 18.5 mm in the harbor
porpoise (present study).

A linear relationship exists between frequency and

OHC length in terrestrial mammals (Pujol et al., 1991;

Dannhof et al., 1991). Indeed, the length of the OHCs

increases while the apex is approached. Because the

absolute length of OHCs may play a role in an intrinsic

tuning mechanism (Pujol et al., 1991), the small size of

odontocete OHCs is consistent with a morphological

adaptation to high-frequency hearing. These results con-

firm that odontocetes, together with bicolored roundleaf

bats, present the shortest OHC ever described in mam-

mals and reflect the higher frequency hearing capabil-

ities of these animals. Harbor porpoises, for example,

can hear up to 180 kHz (Kastelein et al., 2002) and

roundleaf bats up to 200 kHz (Neuweiler et al., 1984),

whereas most echolocating bats hear up to 150 kHz

(Grinnell, 1995). Interestingly, a comparison of OHC

length in the odontocetes we studied and the codified

frequency of these particular cells in other species

shows that these odontocetes do not follow the rela-

tionship described by Pujol et al. (1991) and Dannhof

et al. (1991); in fact, we found that OHCs were much

shorter than expected all along the cochlear spiral. The

reason for this discrepancy is not yet clear.

In addition to their short length, the OHCs also had

relatively small diameters. Unlike terrestrial mammals,

in which OHC diameter is approximately constant at 7

mm, in the species in this study OHC diameter ranged
from 3.9 to 5.4 mm. The smaller OHC dimensions in
these odontocetes might coincide with a decrease in

the OHC lateral membrane surface and a decrease in

the membrane cell capacitance, thus increasing con-

ductance and sensitivity to high frequency (Housley and

Ashmore, 1992). The total numbers of IHCs (2,842) and

OHCs (10,367), estimated here for harbor porpoise,

and OHCs (13,405) for striped dolphin were consistent

with previous results for other odontocete species. For

example, 3,272 IHCs and 12,899 OHCs were calculated

for the Pacific white-sided dolphin (Wever et al., 1972),

and 3,451 IHCs and 13,933 OHCs for the bottlenose

dolphin (Wever et al., 1971a). The magnitude of these

hair cell estimations is similar to what was reported by

Retzius (1884) for the human ear (3,475 IHCs and

11,500 OHCs), which has about the same cochlear

length.

Stereocilia
The number of stereocilia on the outermost row per

OHC was high and seemed to be constant along the

cochlear length. If the cells have the same number of

stereocilia in all rows, the number on each cell would

range from 130 in harbor porpoise to 168 in striped

dolphin (Table 5), but further research is needed to

confirm these results. In some terrestrial mammals the

number of stereocilia changes along the basoapical axis

and between the OHC rows. For example, in humans

the number of OHC stereocilia varies from 50 to 120

between the apical and basal turns (Kimura et al.,

1964); in chinchillas the number of OHC1 and OHC2

stereocilia remains quite constant (100–110 stereocilia

in the basal turn and 90–100 in the apex), whereas in

the OHC3 the number of stereocilia varies from 80 in

the basal turn to 18–40 in the apical turn (Lim, 1986).

The large number of stereocilia in cetaceans may have

at least two consequences: 1) to improve the functional

relationship between the tectorial membrane and the

organ of Corti; 2) to increase the number of ion chan-

nels that would facilitate depolarization of the cell and

enhance its sensitivity (Assad et al., 1991).

Scarring process
In the case of a harbor porpoise in which we observed

extensive scar formation in the OHC region of a large

portion of the upper apical turn (Fig. 5E), scarring dam-

age would affect the hearing in the lower frequency

range. Once the cochlear frequency map for a species

is resolved, it will be possible to estimate the acoustic

characteristics of a source that may have caused dam-

age by acoustic overstimulation. This is possible

because “the greatest hearing-loss occurs at a fre-

quency about half an octave above the exposure tone”

(Davis et al., 1950). The frequency range of the suspect

source could correspond to several anthropogenic

marine activities, for example, shipping, pile driving, or

seismic operations. However, other causes cannot be

ruled out. For example, this particular animal was rela-

tively old, and studies of age-related hearing loss in

other mammals have shown that the base of the coch-

lea is consistently affected, as well as, in some cases,

a small region of the apex (Johnsson and Hawkins,

1972; Spongr et al., 1997). Nevertheless, although the

basal turn of the cochlea was not well preserved, thus

preventing determination of the possible influence of

aging in the analysis, we could clearly distinguish

between disappearance of hair cells prior to death and

damage to hair cells due to autolysis. In the first case,

the stereociliary bundle was missing and a scar was

made by neighboring epithelial cells. In the second

case, the stereocilia were generally missing, but the

cuticular plate of the hair cells remained and the epi-

thelial mosaic was retained.

Subsurface cisternae
In the horseshoe bat (Vater et al., 1992), Mexican free-

tailed bat (Vater and Siefer, 1995), rats, mice, and

human (Arnold and Anniko, 1990) there is only one

layer of subsurface cisternae. In contrast, guinea pig

OHCs display multiple layers of subsurface cisternae,

especially in the apical region (Saito, 1983). Subsurface

cisternae are believed to play an important role in OHC

motility by releasing Ca
21

(Schulte, 1993; Tolomeo

et al., 1996; Oghalai et al., 1998; Koyama et al., 1999).

The present study showed that the harbor porpoise and

the striped dolphin present the same pattern as the

horseshoe bat (Vater et al., 1992).

Deiters and Pillar cells
In the basal turn of the cochlea in odontocetes as

well as echolocating bats, the exaggerated thickness

of the reticular lamina, made of both Deiters cell pha-

langes and heads of outer pillar cells, may provide an

advantage for motion at high frequencies (Vater

et al., 1992). The Deiters cells, Deiters cups, and pil-

lar cells in the basal cochlear turn of the species

evaluated in our study showed robust cytoskeletal

structures (Fig. 3G,H), suggesting that the mechanical

anchorage of the OHCs is reinforced and extremely

stiff compared with the arrangement in the apical

turn or throughout most of the cochlea of other mam-

mals. Significantly, the disposition of Deiters cups

found in odontocetes is also found in the organ of

Corti of the basal turn in echolocating bats (Henson

and Henson, 1979; Dannhof and Bruns, 1991; Vater

et al., 1992; Vater and Siefer, 1995). This feature

may therefore be relevant for high-frequency process-

ing (Reysenbach de Haan, 1957; Wever et al., 1971c,

1972; Vater et al., 1992).

Innervation
Medial efferent innervations
Nerve endings were found connecting with the base of

the OHCs (Fig. 4A). We interpret these nerve terminals

as afferents (type II), because the OHCs were lacking

postsynaptic cisternae and we did not observe thick

upper crossing fibers in the tunnel of Corti. Studies in

humans have shown that the efferent nerve endings

and postsynaptic cistern are very resistant to anoxia,

and usually remain present, even when the OHCs are in

a very advanced decomposition stage (Bruns and

Schmieszek, 1980; Lavigne-Rebillard and Pujol, 1988,

1990). Thus, we could not find evidence that these spe-

cies receive medial efferent innervation onto the OHCs.

A lack of medial efferent innervation was also shown

in echolocating horseshoe bats, in bicolor and Indian

roundleaf bats (Bruns and Schmieszek, 1980; Aschoff

and Ostwald, 1988; Bishop and Henson, 1988; Dannhof

and Bruns, 1991; Vater et al., 1992), and in the mole

rat Spalax ehrenbergi (Raphael et al., 1991), a species

specialized for low-frequency hearing (Bruns et al.,

1988). This evidence supports the notion that the

medial efferent innervation of the OHCs may be a regu-

lating system for the mid-frequencies, and may not be

needed at extremely high and low frequencies (Vater

et al., 1992). However, other studies on the echolocat-

ing species Mexican free tailed bats (Tadaria brasilien-

sis) and Parnell’s mustached bats (Pteronotus parnellii)

showed the presence of medial efferent innervation

onto the OHCs (Bishop and Henson, 1988; Vater and

Siefer, 1995). Thus, there is no straightforward func-

tional explanation for the absence of medial efferent

innervation in some echolocating species (Vater et al.,

1992).

Spiral ganglion cells
The density of SGCs, as measured by the number of

cells per cross-sectional area, in Rosenthal’s canal

(4.4–8 SGCs/10,000 mm2) in the odontocetes studied
here is similar to that in guinea pigs (8 SGC/10,000

mm2; Jin et al., 2006), but much lower than in Mongo-
lian gerbils (28.1 SGC/10,000 mm2; Fujita et al., 2007)
or mice (between 36.3 in the apex and 39.6 SGC/

10,000 mm2 in the base; Sato et al., 2006). Considering
that the bottlenose dolphin has three times, and the

Pacific white-sided dolphin almost twice as many SGCs

as the human (Wever et al., 1971a, 1972), we expected

a higher density of SGCs in the odontocetes in our

study. However, the SGCs of the harbor porpoise and

striped dolphin were much larger in size (maximum 45

3 25 mm and 46 3 30 mm, respectively, Table 3) than
those found in rodents (for example, 13–18 mm in rats;

Bichler, 1984), and even larger than those in bottlenose

dolphins, in which basal turn SGCs were 38.4 3 25.2

mm and middle turn SGCs were 34.4 3 21.1 mm
(Wever et al., 1971a). In fact, odontocetes increase the

number of SGCs by increasing the space occupied in

Rosenthal’s canal. There are some differences between

species. For example, the number of SGCs in a trans-

verse section of Rosenthal’s canal ranged from 128 to

152 in the striped dolphin, and from 122 to 182 in the

harbor porpoise (not illustrated here), but was only 81–

88 and 57–67 in gerbils (Ruttiger et al., 2007). Our

results are consistent with the large ratio of SGCs to

hair cells found by Wever and colleagues (1971a), sug-

gesting “unusual capabilities in the utilization of audi-

tory information.” Considering that the peripheral

process of each neuron contacts one IHC, it could be

inferred that, in the cochlea of the odontocetes ana-

lyzed in this study, IHCs have many more afferent syn-

apses than IHCs in cochleas of terrestrial mammals. In

turn, this rich afferent innervation should provide func-

tional advantages to these odontocetes, possibly

increasing sensitivity and/or dynamic range.

Basilar membrane
The width and thickness of the basilar membrane

have been measured in several mammalian species

(Nadol, 1988; Roth and Bruns, 1992; Sato et al., 1999;

Keiler and Richter, 2001). A clear gradient in width and

thickness has been reported in most species as well as

in the odontocetes analyzed in this study: narrower,

thicker, and relatively stiff in the base, and broader and

thinner in the apex.

The basilar membrane was wider and thinner in

approximately the first 2 mm of the cochlea. A

decrease in basilar membrane thickness in the basal

hook was previously described in Parnell’s mustached

bat and the greater horseshoe bat (Bruns, 1976; K€ossl

and Vater, 1985), and an increase in width in bicolored

roundleaf bat (Dannhof and Bruns, 1991). The func-

tional role of the basilar membrane is not very well

understood. In the case of the bottlenose dolphin, the

width of the basilar membrane increased by about 14

times from the base (25 lm) to the apex (350 lm;
Wever et al., 1971b), whereas the thickness diminished

by five times (from 25 to 5 lm). However, the basilar
membrane in humans showed an increase in width of

only about four times (from 125 to 500 lm) and a
threefold decrease in thickness from the base (7 lm)
to the apex (2 lm) (Schuknecht, 1993; Ketten, 1998).

The values obtained for the harbor porpoise and the

striped dolphin (Table 2) did not show an increasing

trend, as in the bottlenose dolphin, even though the

striped dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin have similar

hearing sensitivities. It is possible that this difference in

dimensions could result from a lack of information on

the extreme locations of the cochlea (first and last milli-

meters; Fig. 2), or because the criterion to establish

the limits of the basilar membrane was different. Fur-

ther comparative research should be conducted to

investigate differences between these species. In odon-

tocetes, the basilar membrane is very stiff at the base

of the cochlea, fixed to both sides by a very well-

developed inner and outer osseus spiral laminae that

confers an adaptation for very high-frequency hearing

(Wever et al., 1971b; Ketten and Wartzok, 1990; Ket-

ten, 1992, 1994).

Tectorial membrane
Despite the very fast autolysis processes after death,

the tectorial membrane was less affected than other

structures, perhaps because it is composed of an

extracellular matrix (Slepecky et al., 1992). The high

resistance of this structure to anoxia would allow the

diagnosis of possible alterations in the OHC stereocilia

due to acoustic trauma (Morisaki et al., 1991), even if

the cochlea was fixed after more than 20 hours post-

mortem. In all our samples, the imprints of stereocilia

on the tectorial membrane were regular. Because the

shape of these imprints mirrors the initial organization

of the stereocilia in the OHCs, there was no evidence

of acoustic trauma. That is not to say that acoustic

trauma did not occur in some other specimens, as sug-

gested by the presence of epithelial scars seen in SEM

(Fig. 5E). We detected the presence of IHC stereocilia

impressions in the very basal region of a common dol-

phin tectorial membrane (Fig. 7G,H) for the first time in

odontoces; this feature has been previously described

in rats (Lenoir et al., 1987) and bats (Vater and Lenoir,

1992). However, Matsumura (2001) was unable to dem-

onstrate a direct physical attachment between IHCs

and the tectorial membrane in most mammalian spe-

cies. We believe that this characteristic was difficult to

observe in all our samples because of the degraded

state of the organ of Corti.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS

This study has, for the first time, described the ultra-

structure of the organ of Corti of odontocetes. The two

species of odontocetes analyzed by TEM had morpho-

logical characteristics that support high-frequency hear-

ing, including: 1) a short length of OHCs; 2) a thick

cuticular plate in OHCs, Deiters cells, and outer pillar

cells; 3) robust cup formation of the Deiters cell body;

4) a highly developed cytoskeleton in Deiters and pillar

cells; and 5) a high thickness of the basilar membrane.

All these features, in addition to a common molecular

design of prestin (Li et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010), an

OHC motor protein (Zheng et al., 2000), and a parallel

evolution of other auditory genes related to hair cell

bundle motility, hair cell activity, and nerve transmission

(cadherin 23, protocadherin 15, otoferlin, transmem-

brane cochlear-expressed gen1, and pejvakin; Davies

et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2012), are also shared by

echolocating bats (for review, see Vater and K€ossl,

2011), suggesting a convergent evolution among echo-

locating species.

An additional goal of this study was to use morpho-

logical features of the inner ear to detect structural

alterations that might result from sound overexposure.

This proved to be difficult, because delays in tissue fixa-

tion from stranded animals resulted in cochlear decom-

position that prevented us from diagnosing acoustic

trauma from changes in hair cell stereocilia (Bredberg

et al., 1972; Engstrom et al., 1984), or other alterations

at the sensory cell (Hu et al., 2000) or innervation lev-

els (Spoendlin, 1971). However, the presence of scars

(Fig. 5D,E), which indicates premortem hair cell disap-

pearance, could be clearly distinguished from autolysis

artifacts. In fact, in one case (harbor porpoise; Fig. 5E),

the lesions would be consistent with an acoustic

trauma.

The tectorial membrane appeared to be more resist-

ant to postmortem autolysis and remained in accepta-

ble condition for analysis when the cochlea was fixed

more than 20 hours postmortem. The analysis of the

stereocilia imprints on the tectorial membrane has pro-

vided insights into odontocete hair cell stereocilia orga-

nization. In addition, because of the difficulties of

obtaining and analyzing fresh samples of cetacean ears

immediately after stranding, our results suggest an

alternative approach using image analysis of the tecto-

rial membrane, a procedure not yet common, as a diag-

nosis to detect possible lesions due to noise

overexposure.

The results presented in this study show that the

combination of the two complementary imaging techni-

ques is necessary to document whether an odontocete

has suffered from an acoustic trauma: first an overview

by SEM to localize possible lesions along the cochlear

axis, focusing on the presence of scars and irregular-

ities of the imprints of the tectorial membrane; and sec-

ond, a more detailed analysis by TEM to characterize

the lesion on a transverse view that contains informa-

tion on all the cochlear cells involved.

We present scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy

micrographs of the ultrastructure of the organ of Corti of odontocete spe-

cies. The species of odontocetes analyzed by TEM presented morphological

characteristics, shared with horseshoe bats, suggesting that there has been

convergent evolution of sound reception mechanisms among echolocating

species.
