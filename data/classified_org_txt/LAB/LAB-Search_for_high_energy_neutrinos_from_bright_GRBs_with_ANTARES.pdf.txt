ABSTRACT
Gamma-ray bursts are thought to be sites of hadronic acceleration, thus neutrinos are expected
from the decay of charged particles, produced in pγ interactions. The methods and results of
a search for muon neutrinos in the data of the ANTARES neutrino telescope from four bright
GRBs (GRB 080916C, GRB 110918A, GRB 130427A and GRB 130505A) observed between
2008 and 2013 are presented. Two scenarios of the fireball model have been investigated: the
internal shock scenario, leading to the production of neutrinos with energies mainly above
100 TeV, and the photospheric scenario, characterised by a low-energy component in neutrino
spectra due to the assumption of neutrino production closer to the central engine. Since no
neutrino events have been detected in temporal and spatial coincidence with these bursts,
upper limits at 90% C.L. on the expected neutrino fluxes are derived. The non-detection allows
for directly constraining the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet Γ and the baryon loading fp.

Key words: neutrinos – acceleration of particles – gamma-ray bursts: individual: GRB
080916C – gamma-ray bursts: individual: GRB 110918A – gamma-ray bursts: individual:

1 INTRODUCTION

The existence of hadronic acceleration mechanisms in Gamma-Ray
Bursts (GRBs) would be unambiguously proven by the identifica-
tion of high-energy neutrinos in temporal and spatial coincidence
with the prompt emission of the burst. The detection of a single
neutrino event would allow to identify this type of sources as a
candidate for the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) pro-
duction, whose origin is still under investigation (Blasi 2014). In
order to test different scenarios, including those in which GRBs
are able to reproduce the magnitude of the UHECR flux observed
on Earth (see for instance Waxman 1995, Vietri 1995, Wang et al.
2008, Murase & Takami 2008 and Globus et al. 2015), a multi-
messenger approach can be adopted. For this purpose, the search
for a possible neutrino counterpart can be crucial. Indeed, neutrinos
are ideal candidates in the search for distant astrophysical sources,
as they are electrically neutral, stable and weakly interacting parti-
cles.
GRBs are transient sources, which release energies between 1051
and 1054 ergs in a few seconds (see Piran 2004, Mészáros 2006
and Zhang & Kumar 2015 for detailed reviews). Such extremely
energetic events are probably related to the formation of a black
hole, through the collapse of a massive star or the merging of a bi-
nary system (Piran 2004). The origin of GRB prompt emission is
still under debate: the current theoretical understanding concern-
ing the production of the γ-ray spectrum observed in the major-
ity of GRBs is referred to as the standard fireball model (Piran
1999), which naturally produces a non-thermal spectrum. The gen-
erally accepted picture is the Internal Shock (IS) scenario (Rees &
Mészáros 1994, Kobayashi et al. 1997 and Daigne & Mochkovitch
1998); nevertheless, the Photospheric (PH) scenario has also been
widely discussed in literature (Paczýnski 1986, Thompson 1994,
Mészáros & Rees 2000 and Zhang & Kumar 2013). They both as-
sume that internal shocks take place when a faster shell of plasma
catches up with a slower one: such a mechanism dissipates a large
fraction of the kinetic energy of the flow, provided that the inter-
nal engine is highly variable. A fraction of this energy is expected
to be transferred to accelerated particles: acceleration takes place
on a very short timescale at the shock front, leading particles to
ultra-relativistic speeds. Accelerated electrons subsequently radiate
a fraction of their energy through synchrotron and inverse Comp-
ton processes. This radiation field constitutes the target for pho-
tohadronic interactions: from the collision of accelerated protons

with the dense radiation field of the jet, mesons are produced, which
then decay, producing neutrinos and γ-rays.
The main channel goes through the production of the ∆+ and its
subsequent decay into pions, according to:

In this dense environment, also kaon contribution becomes relevant
to γ-ray production, because of the energy losses before their de-
cay, and to neutrino production, especially at high energies. The
treatment of neutrino production models from the prompt emission
of GRBs was first given by Waxman & Bahcall 1997 and in more
detail by Guetta et al. 2004.
ANTARES (Ageron et al. 2011) is the largest undersea neu-
trino telescope on the Northern hemisphere, sensitive to neutri-
nos mainly with energies above hundreds of GeV. It is an array of
photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs), anchored at a depth of 2475 m in
the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Toulon (France). Neutrinos are de-
tected through the Cherenkov radiation induced by ultra-relativistic
particles created from a neutrino interaction. Track-like signatures
are provided by muons, mainly produced by charged-current νµ
interactions. Previous searches for neutrinos from GRBs with both
the ANTARES (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2016, Adrián-Martínez et
al. 2013a and Adrián-Martínez et al. 2013b) and IceCube (Aart-
sen et al. 2015, Aartsen et al. 2016) detectors did not measure any
significant excess of neutrino events over the expected background
and have placed limits on GRB parameters. However, recent works
on the IS model (Baerwald et al. 2015 and Bustamante et al. 2016)
suggest a GRB multi-zone production model for both neutrinos,
gamma-rays and cosmic rays, which significantly lowers the neu-
trino expected flux with respect to previous predictions, indicating
that such a flux may have been overestimated in earlier works.
In this paper, a search for astrophysical neutrinos from bright GRBs
with ANTARES data is presented. Bright sources represent promis-
ing targets, assuming that the neutrino flux scales with the γ-ray
flux. In Sec. 2, four bright GRBs used in the search for neutrinos
are introduced. Then, in Sec. 3, the internal shock and photospheric
scenarios of the fireball model are briefly reviewed and the corre-
sponding neutrino flux expectations are presented. Since the pre-
dicted signals are expected in different energy ranges, the analyses

Search for high-energy neutrinos from bright GRBs 3

are performed using different data samples and specific features, as
reported in Sec. 4, where the analysis methods are outlined. The
results are discussed in Sec. 5. Because of the fact that no neutrino
has been observed in coincidence with the GRBs, constraints on the
parameter space of the models are given in Sec. 6: such constraints
are derived for each GRB individually. Finally, the implications of
such results on models for GRB neutrino production are examined
in Sec. 7.

2 GRB SELECTION

The search for point-like neutrino sources consists of the identi-
fication of an event excess over the expected background from a
given position in the sky, where the source is located, as illustrated
in Adrián-Martínez et al. 2014. In the case of GRBs, since the de-
tected γ-ray emission is limited in time, also a temporal coinci-
dence is required. In this way, it is possible to reduce the back-
ground contribution. The flux of atmospheric muons from above
the detector comprises the largest part of the background, with a
flux several orders of magnitude larger than any expected signal.
The shielding effect of the Earth is exploited applying a geometri-
cal cut on the reconstructed direction of the muon tracks. Select-
ing only upward going particles, the contamination by the atmo-
spheric muons is largely reduced: since muons cannot cross the
entire Earth, this cut rejects all atmospheric muons except for a
small contamination due to mis-reconstructed events. In the study
of transient sources, the requirement of temporal and directional
coincidence allows to relax the cuts such that the dominant com-
ponent is composed by mis-reconstructed atmospheric muons and
atmospheric neutrinos, which represent an irreducible background
for the cosmic signal. Therefore, an extended likelihood method is
used to distinguish among signal and background events. For the
search and simulation of neutrino fluxes, the brightest GRBs ob-
servable with ANTARES between 2008 and 2013 and the required
γ-ray parameters are selected as described in Sec. 2.1. Both the
theoretical IS and PH models have been used to predict neutrino
fluxes.

2.1 GRB and γ-ray parameter selection

GRBs with high observed γ-ray fluence, namely bursts with
Fγ > 1 × 10−4 erg cm−2 (the average value of fluence ranges
between 10−6 and 10−5 erg cm−2), were selected. It is also
required that the progenitors of such bursts have the redshift mea-
sured, in order to estimate their intrinsic luminosity, and that they
were in the field of view of the ANTARES telescope at the trigger
time, i.e. located below the horizon. Four bright GRBs fulfill
these criteria: GRB 080916C, GRB 110918A, GRB 130427A and
GRB 130505A. In order to compute neutrino spectra, some input
parameters are needed. However, some of them, which mainly
concern the mechanism through which the jet kinetic energy is
converted into internal energy, cannot be directly inferred from
measurements. As a consequence, default values are assigned to
these inputs: the ratio fp between internal energy in protons and
electrons (also called baryonic loading) is fixed to fp = 10; the
fraction of internal energy in electrons �e and that in magnetic
field �B are assumed equal because of energy equipartition, with
�e = �B = 0.1; the average fraction of proton energy transferred to
a pion is 〈xp→π〉 = 0.2; and the Lorentz factor of the overall jet,
more commonly denoted as bulk Lorentz factor, is Γ = 316. Also,
when not explicitly mentioned, the minimum variability time is

assumed to be tvar = 0.01 s for long bursts: this parameter affects
the evaluation of neutrino expectations, since it is directly related
to the morphology of the internal source (Golkhou et al. 2015).
Below the selection of the γ-ray parameters, as collected from the
Gamma-ray Coordinate Network (GCN) Circular Archive1 and
reported in Tab. 1, is described and the search strategy applied
burst per burst is presented.

GRB 080916C triggered γ-ray satellites at 00:12:46 UTC on
September 16th, 2008, with a right ascension RA = 119.87◦ and
declination DEC = −56.59◦. In a joint Fermi GBM and LAT
analysis (Abdo et al. 2009) five time bins are defined, relying on
the γ-ray spectral parameters. The relevant parameters for each bin
in the burst are reported in Tab. 1. In particular, in bin B a 3 GeV
photon was detected, followed by a 13.2 GeV photon in bin D:
such high-energy emissions could be an indication of the hadronic
origin of the radiation (Asano et al. 2011). Moreover, the redshift
of the progenitor was identified at z = 4.35, while a minimum
variability time scale of tvar = 0.23 s was obtained from its light
curve. Since neutrino production is directly linked to the GRB
activity periods, our time dependent search is optimised in each of
the five time bins defined by Fermi GBM and LAT analysis. The
model expectations are therefore computed in each time bin and
these contributions are summed up in order to obtain the expected
signal from the burst.

GRB 110918A started at 21:26:57 UTC on September 18th, 2011,
located at RA = 32.58◦ and DEC = −27.58◦ with a redshift
z = 0.98. Its local position in the ANTARES sky at the trigger
time implied that neutrinos traveled up to the detector crossing the
Earth quite horizontally, so that a negligible effect can be attributed
to the Earth-absorption; this fact, together with the burst proximity
in redshift, makes GRB 110918A a very promising candidate for
a neutrino search with our detector. A time-dependent search is
performed on this burst, based on data in three time bins given
from the Konus-Wind satellite (Frederiks et al. 2013), as reported in
Tab. 1. Frederiks et al. 2013 also estimate the minimum variability
time tvar = 0.25 s.

GRB 130427A enlight up the γ-ray sky on April 27th, 2013,
at 07:47:07 UTC. From this burst two high-energy photons, of
95 GeV and 73 GeV, were detected by the Fermi LAT satellite
(Ackermann et al. 2014). The source position was reconstructed
at RA = 173.14◦ and DEC = 27.71◦ with a redshift z = 0.34.
Its minimum variability time was measured to be tvar = 0.04 s.
The Konus-Wind Collaboration provided the time-dependent
spectral parameters of the main emission episode. For this burst,
an absence of neutrinos associated to the electromagnetic emission
was announced by IceCube2 and then discussed in Gao et al. 2013.

GRB 130505A happened on May 13th, 2013, at 08:22:27 UTC and
RA = 137.06◦, DEC = 17.49◦ at z = 2.27. Since the light curve
of this burst is characterised by a main emission episode, a time
average search was performed, relying on the spectral parameters
released by Konus-Wind on the GCN. For this burst, the default
value of tvar will be used in the following.

3 THE INTERNAL SHOCK AND THE PHOTOSPHERIC
MODELS

In GRB models, neutrinos are produced from the interaction be-
tween the accelerated protons and the jet radiation field. The pre-
dicted observable neutrino flux follows the primary spectrum; since
both the internal shock and the photospheric models assume a dif-
ferential energy spectrum for protons in the form of an unbroken
power law with spectral index s = −2 (according to the stan-
dard diffusive shock acceleration mechanism in the test-particle
regime), also the energy of neutrinos will be distributed accord-
ing to a power law spectrum. Two breaks are expected to modify
the simple power law behavior of neutrino energy distribution, both
due to synchrotron cooling of charged particles. The former reflects
the break in the photon spectrum due to energy losses of accelerated
electrons: it directly affects the neutrino spectrum since neutrinos
result from photo-production processes. The latter break is due to
the synchrotron losses from secondary mesons. The main differ-
ence between the two scenarios is the radius at which acceleration
takes place, since it affects the optical depth τpγ of pγ interaction
(Waxman & Bahcall 1997 and Zhang & Kumar 2013):

τpγ = 0.8

where Γ is the bulk Lorentz factor, R is the distance between the
central engine and the neutrino production site which defines the
fireball radius, Liso is the isotropic γ-ray luminosity of the burst
and Eγ is the energy at which the γ-ray spectrum has a break (of
the order of 100 keV typically). In the IS scenario the radius of
collision is (Baerwald et al. 2015):

where c is the light speed, tvar is the minimum variability time scale
observed in the light curve of the burst and z is its redshift. The
PH scenario predicts that particle acceleration occurs at a radius
RPH (Zhang & Kumar 2015) in such a way that γ-rays are unable

to escape due to high optical depth of electron-photon scattering
(defined through the Thomson cross section σT ):

The photospheric model considers a baryonic dominated outflow,
given the presence of the proton massmp in Eq. 4: this assumption
justifies the choice of the standard value fp = 10 for the baryonic
loading in the prediction of neutrino spectra. Other formulations
of the PH model exist in literature: Murase 2008 supposed that
jets might also be dominated by pairs. In this case, the energy is
mainly carried by radiation and a generally lower baryonic loading
is assumed (fp ' 1). Outflows with a huge neutron loading could
also be considered, as in Murase et al. 2013: neutrinos in the energy
range of tens of GeV are expected in this model, which makes
these searches challenging for high-energy neutrino telescopes.
For characteristic values of GRB parameters, Eq. 3 and Eq. 4
give RPH < RIS: τpγ in the PH model is enhanced by a factor
RISRPH compared to the IS model (see Eq. 2). Consequently, the
neutrino production is more efficient in a dissipative photosphere
than in standard internal shocks. Finally, as the neutrino energy
breaks depend on the radius (Zhang & Kumar 2013), in such a
way that increasing the collision radius moves neutrino energy
breaks to higher energies, the resulting PH model produces
neutrinos at lower energy 100 GeV− 10 TeV than in the IS model
100 TeV − 1 EeV. Therefore, the neutrino signal predictions are
very different between the two models, as shown in the following.

3.1 Neutrino flux expectations

In this section, the methods used for the computation of the
expected neutrino fluxes from each GRB are presented: they

Search for high-energy neutrinos from bright GRBs 5

3.1.1 Internal Shock Model Case

Detailed calculations of the GRB neutrino spectra in the IS con-
text are performed, through the numerical code NeuCosmA. Based
on SOPHIA (Mücke et al. 2000), it simulates the particle physics
with a pre-defined proton and photon spectrum (here a GRB Band
spectrum, Band et al. 1993) and takes into account the full pγ cross
section (firstly derived in Murase & Nagataki 2006), including not
only the ∆+ resonance but also higher mass resonances and kaon
production. This yields an additional high-energy component in
the νµ spectrum, typically at EeV energies. Moreover, it consid-
ers individual energy losses of secondary particles and neutrino os-
cillations during their propagation from the source to the Earth.
The normalization of the neutrino spectrum is linearly scaled to
the baryonic loading factor and to the per-burst γ-ray fluence. The
algorithm produces the expected neutrino spectrum, assuming the
measured values of the γ-ray parameters, as reported in Tab. 1 for
each emission episode of the bursts. The resulting muon neutrino
spectra are given as solid lines in the left panel of Fig. 1.

3.1.2 Photospheric Model Case

To compute the PH neutrino spectra the general formalism devel-
oped by Zhang & Kumar 2013 was adopted, which adds a cor-
rection factor f to the normalization to take into account the fact
that only a fraction of the accelerated protons will produce neu-
trinos via pγ interactions. No pp interaction is considered in the
Zhang & Kumar (2013) model. These fluxes are shown as solid
lines in the right panel of Fig. 1. Because the energy range of inter-
est for this search is below 10 TeV, special features that could offer
a better ANTARES sensitivity in the lower energy range have been
used in this analysis: a sample of unfiltered data, a low-energy opti-
mised reconstruction algorithm and a directional filter, as described
in Sec. 4.1.

4 METHODOLOGY

Two different data samples are used in order to match the neutrino
energy range expected from the two models, each with specific fea-
tures concerning the track reconstruction algorithms, background
evaluation and search time windows, as reported in Sec. 4.1. The
same optimisation method is used for both models and is described
in Sec. 4.2.

4.1 Data samples and specific analysis features

The ANTARES Data Acquisition (DAQ) system (Aguilar et al.
2007) is designed following the "all data to shore" concept: all pho-
ton signals are recorded above a threshold of 0.3 photo-electrons by
the optical modules. They are then sent and buffered in the shore
station where a filtering is performed. In some special cases, such
as a GRB alert, the full unfiltered buffer can be saved on disk. The
ANTARES detector receives the the GCN alert, which contains the
position of the burst and its main features. In 90% of the cases
the delay between the detection of a GRB by the satellite and the
time of the alert message distributed is below 200 s (with a typ-
ical delay around 10 s). The GRB unfiltered data sample also in-
cludes unfiltered data buffered before the alert message reception.
The overall size of the unfiltered data sample is about 2 minutes,
so that data cover the majority of the burst duration (Bouwhuis
2005). To increase the sensitivity to low-energies, unfiltered data

are used for the PH model, while filtered data are used for the IS
one. The unfiltered data recorded are analysed with a dedicated al-
gorithm, searching for space-time correlations restricted in a small
search cone centered to the position of the considered GRB. A less
strict filter condition with respect to the standard online triggers
is applied. This algorithm yields more detected events in the tar-
get direction. A dedicated reconstruction algorithm (Visser 2015),
optimised for energies below 1 TeV, is also applied to this spe-
cific data set. Through these new features and following the same
search method presented in Sec. 4.2, but with a dedicated muon
background estimation, the sensitivity improves by a factor of two
at energies between 100 GeV and 1 TeV, where most of the neu-
trino flux is expected according to the PH model. The analysis per-
formance is compatible with the one of the IS analysis at higher
energies.

4.2 Analysis method

In order to simulate the per burst expected signal, the standard
ANTARES Monte Carlo simulation chain has been used. It accu-
rately describes the data taking conditions and the detector response
during each GRB. The background for each burst is evaluated with
data: upgoing atmospheric neutrinos are the main background com-
ponent, with a smaller contribution coming from mis-reconstructed
downgoing atmospheric muons. The number of background events
µb expected in a defined angular and temporal window around the
burst location is therefore assumed to be known a priori. The search
time window in the IS analysis is chosen to be equal to each burst
duration T (obtained as the sum of the time-bin durations) with a
symmetric extension of 2 seconds. To be conservative, this exten-
sion is much larger than any effect due to the light propagation time
from the satellite to our detector and to uncertainties in the DAQ
system. In the PH case, instead, the time window depends on the
unfiltered data buffer duration. Since GRBs are transient sources,
the angular window of the search can be enlarged with respect to
that normally used in a steady source search (Adrián-Martínez et
al. 2014): the search cone around the burst is fixed with an aperture
equal to 10◦. Given the short duration time window, this value still
allows to have a rate of expected signal generally higher than the
estimated background in the same search region, as will be shown
later.
The analysis is optimised independently for each burst, as de-
scribed in Adrián-Martínez et al. 2013b, through the computation
of pseudo-experiments with ntot total number of events, based on
an extended maximum likelihood ratio test statistic Q (Barlow
1990):

Q = max
µ′s∈0;ntot

(

where αi is the angular distance between the GRB position and the
reconstructed muon direction, Sαi is the signal probability den-
sity function, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations, and Bαi is
the background probability density function, assumed flat in the
solid angle of the cone. In order to extract the distribution ofQ as a
function of the injected signals, more than 108 pseudo-experiments
have been performed. Signal and background events are randomly
extracted from their normalised distributions and the test statistic
evaluated, returning the estimated signal µ′s as the one maximising

Q . The significance of a measurement is given by its p-value3, that
is the probability of getting values for Q at least as high as that ob-
served if the background only hypothesis were true.
This procedure is repeated for different cut value of the track qual-
ity parameter (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2012): the finally selected
value for this parameter is the one that maximises the probability to
observe an excess with a p-value lower than the pre-defined thresh-
old at a given statistical accuracy, assuming the expected signal flux
from the model.

5 RESULTS

Both analyses are optimised for the track quality cut yielding the
maximum detection probability for a 3σ significance, with the
background event rate µb evaluated as in Adrián-Martínez et al.
2013b. The results of the optimised IS analyses on the four bursts
are summarised in Tab. 2. From these results, it is evident that for
three bursts (GRB 110918A, GRB 130427A and GRB 130505A)
the estimated background µb is smaller than the expected signal
µs.
After the analyses have been optimised for each burst, the differ-
ent track quality cuts have been applied. In the PH case, the strat-
egy described in Sec. 4.1 was applied on the unfiltered data files
recorded in coincidence with GRB 130427A and GRB 130505A
(since for GRB 080916C and GRB 110918A unfiltered data were
not available). No events have been detected in spatial and tempo-
ral coincidence with any of these bursts in any of the time windows
selected for the searches. 90% C.L. upper limits on the expected
signal fluences are derived and reported in Fig. 1. Defining the dif-
ferential neutrino fluence φν , our limits are E2νφν between about
0.1 − 10 GeV/cm2 for both models. Concerning the IS scenario,
the closest upper limit to the expected flux is derived for GRB
130505A. This may also be related to the fact that it is the only
burst of the sample for which the default value of minimum vari-
ability time scale has been used, because it was not directly mea-
sured. GRB 110918A and GRB 130427A give quite similar results:
the better limit is on GRB 110918A, given the better effective area
of the detector at the local position of this burst; the upper limit on
GRB 080916C is on the other hand limited by its high redshift. For
the PH scenario limits on the bursts for which unfiltered data were
not available are obtained assuming no detection and using the op-
timised cuts of the IS analysis.
The individual limits derived for these bright GRBs are consistent
with the limits shown in previous ANTARES stacking searches
(see Fig. 8b in Adrián-Martínez et al. 2013b), which refer to the
IS model only. In the standard approach fp and Γ are assumed
to be the same for all the stacked sources, respectively equal to
fp = 10 and Γ = 316: this assumption leads bright GRBs to be the
main contributors to the total neutrino flux, even when numerous
but fainter GRBs are added to the search.

6 CONSTRAINTS ON GRB MODELS

The obtained 90% C.L. limits on the neutrino fluence allow the free
parameters that significantly impact the neutrino flux to be con-
strained both in the framework of the IS and PH model. Since the

measured γ-ray fluence Fγ , the bulk Lorentz factor Γ and the bary-
onic loading factor fp mainly affect the neutrino yield from GRBs,
the use of bright GRBs is justified when assuming that such sources
have broadly similar values of Γ and fp. However, it is also essen-
tial to constrain the much larger sample of faint sources, since they
could contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux with their cumulative
effect. In Fig. 2 and 3 the 90% and 50% C.L exclusion limits are
shown in the Γ − fp plane regarding the IS model predictions for
all GRBs in the case of the IS and PH models, respectively. It is
assumed that 1 ≤ fp ≤ 200 and 10 ≤ Γ ≤ 900 and that the two
parameters are not correlated.

6.1 Internal Shock Model Case

For the high-z burst GRB 080916C the derived constraints do not
significantly challenge the internal shock model since values of
Γ above 100 cannot be excluded. At low Lorentz factor regime
Γ < 100, values of fp in the range from 10 to about 30 are ex-
cluded but do not go beyond the default value of fp. In the case of
this GRB, the constraints are strongly limited because of the large
distance to the source.
For the two bursts closest to the Earth GRB 130427A (z = 0.34)
and GRB 110918A (z = 0.98) more stringent limits can be in-
ferred. Low relativistic jets Γ < 50 are completely excluded and a
baryonic loading factor is highly constrained to 10 < fp < 20 for
50 < Γ < 100. For 100 < Γ < 200 values of fp greater than its
benchmark value are excluded, while in the region with Γ > 200
fp is barely constrained .
The most severe constraints are derived for GRB 130505A, start-
ing to significantly challenge the IS scenario up to Γ ∼ 200. This
occurs mainly because GRB 130505A is much more energetic than
GRB 130427A. In addition, because a short variability time scale
was assumed (see Tab. 1), its internal shock radius (RIS ∝ tvar) is
much smaller (which means that the pγ optical depth is enhanced)
than that of GRB 110918A. However, contrary to GRB 110918A
and GRB 130427A, this burst is much farther away (z = 2.27)
which explains the poorest constraints on fp at the very low Γ
regime. Using a different value for the variability time scale, as
tvar = 0.1 s, the constraints are less restrictive and become of the
same order of those from GRB 110918A and GRB 130427A.

6.2 Photospheric Model Case

The photospheric model is not sensitive to the bulk Lorentz fac-
tor because of the fact that in correspondence of the photosphere
the optical depth of pγ interaction is greater than unity and there-
fore does not depend anymore on Γ. Thus the neutrino spectrum
is mainly affected by the γ-ray fluence (and distance effects) and
the baryonic loading factor of the sub-photospheric jet. For these

reasons less stringent constraints on fp could be derived for GRB
130505A, GRB 080916C and GRB 110918A. For what concerns
GRB 130427A, the closest and the most fluent burst, a high bary-
onic content (i.e. fp > 100) in its jet has been ruled out.

7 CONCLUSIONS

A search for muon neutrinos in spatial and temporal coincidence
with the prompt emission of four bright GRBs has been performed
using ANTARES data. Events satisfying the optimised selection
criteria have been considered in two independent analyses, with
the purpose to test and constrain the parameters of both the in-
ternal shock and the photospheric scenarios of the fireball model.
Concerning the internal shock model, the analysis has been opti-
mised in order to give the highest model discovery potential for
each burst, relying on the numerical model NeuCosmA. For the
photospheric model the search strategy has been adapted using a
dedicated data sample, able to enhance the sensitivity of the de-
tector in the neutrino energy range between 100 GeV and 1 TeV,
and optimised in the same way. No signal events have been de-
tected in any of the searches, so that 90% C.L. upper limits on
E2νφν are derived. For the internal shock model, they are placed
between 10−1 GeV/cm2 and 10 GeV/cm2 in the neutrino energy
range going from 3 × 104 GeV to 2 × 107 GeV. For the pho-
tospheric model they stand in the same interval, but in the lower
neutrino energy range from 1 × 102 GeV to 3 × 104 GeV. This
search extends the ANTARES neutrino detection capability from
GRBs into the low-energy regime; compared to what was shown
in previous ANTARES searches for muon neutrinos in coincidence
with 296 GRBs during four years of data (Adrián-Martínez et al.
2013b), it also confirms the sensitivity in the high-energy regime,
i.e. above 100 TeV. Existing limits cannot rule out the theoreti-
cal models investigated here. It is worth recalling, however, that
the expected neutrino fluence is normalised to the detected γ-ray
emission: this allows to constrain the parameters affecting the GRB
emission mechanism. In particular, limits on the bulk Lorentz factor
and on the baryonic content of the GRB jet according to the IS/PH
scenarios have been derived for each source. Assuming the internal
shocks, for the closest burst the results suggest a low neutrino pro-
duction efficiency because of the high Γ region still allowed. Such

a picture is supported by the Lorentz factor estimation performed
for the selected energetic bursts: Γ = 870 for GRB 080916C (Abdo
et al. 2009), Γ = 340−450 for GRB 130427A (Hascoët et al. 2015
and Vurm et al. 2016) and Γ = 340 for GRB 110918A (Frederiks et
al. 2013). This fact may work against the detection of high-energy
neutrinos: the high neutrino production expected in the jet of the
most fluent GRBs seems to be compensated by a high Lorentz fac-
tor and possibly by a low baryonic loading. Models that assume that
a low fraction of the GRB kinetic energy is transferred to protons
(low fp) if Γ is high are the most difficult to constrain using neu-
trino telescopes, as evident from both Fig. 2 and 3. The constraints
do not exclude the hypothesis that, for a given jet energy, high val-
ues of Γ imply small values of fp, as suggested by Sari & Piran
1995. This effect (low fp if Γ is high) goes against the intuitive
idea that the most energetic bursts (and generally the most fluent
ones) are the best targets for individual neutrino detection. In the
case of the photospheric scenario, on the other hand, less stringent
constraints could be placed and most of the parameter space is still
available.
The same constraints can in principle provide information on the
allowed energy range and on the composition of primary particles.
The connection between constraints in neutrinos and CR measure-
ments indicates that a multi-messenger approach is a suitable strat-
egy in the framework of testing the paradigm of GRBs as UHECR
sources. Current neutrino telescopes have a small probability to de-
tect neutrinos from GRBs, as shown in Tab. 2: further investiga-
tions of this scenario will be possible with the incoming generation
of neutrino detectors, such as KM3NeT-ARCA (Adrián-Martínez
et al. 2016) and IceCube-GEN2 (Aartsen et al. 2014).
