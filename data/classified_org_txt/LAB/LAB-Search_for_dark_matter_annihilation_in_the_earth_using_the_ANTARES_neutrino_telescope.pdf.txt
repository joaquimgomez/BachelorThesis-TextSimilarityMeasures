Abstract

A search for a neutrino signal from WIMP pair annihilations in
the centre of the Earth has been performed with the data collected
with the ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to 2012. The event
selection criteria have been developed and tuned to maximise the sen-
sitivity of the experiment to such a neutrino signal. No significant
excess of neutrinos over the expected background has been observed.
Upper limits at 90% C.L. on the WIMP annihilation rate in the Earth
and the spin independent scattering cross-section of WIMPs to nucle-
ons σSIp were calculated for WIMP pair annihilations into either τ

+τ−,

W+W−, bb or the non-SUSY νµν̄µ as a function of the WIMP mass
(between 25 GeV/c2 and 1000 GeV/c2) and as a function of the ther-
mally averaged annihilation cross section times velocity 〈σAv〉Earth of
the WIMPs in the centre of the Earth. For masses of the WIMP close
to the mass of iron nuclei (50 GeV/c2), the obtained limits on σSIp are
more stringent than those obtained by other indirect searches.

1 Introduction

The Universe consists of a large fraction of dark matter (DM)[1][2][3]. DM
particles do not interact electromagnetically, are stable on cosmological time
scales, cannot be dominantly baryonic, and must move with non-relativistic
speeds already at the structure formation epoch. The DM relic abundance
today as a result of thermal production requires a particle with a thermally
averaged annihilation cross-section of about

〈σAv〉 = 3 · 10−26 cm3s−1 , (1)

which is the natural scale at which a weakly-interacting particle [4] would be
expected. The hypothetical Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)
are therefore widely regarded as excellent DM candidates. Such particles
arise in different theories, such as supersymmetric (SUSY) models [4] (the
fact that SUSY predicts a particle with the right properties is often referred
to as the ‘WIMP miracle’) or models with extra dimensions [5]. WIMPs from

3



supersymmetric models, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Extension of
the Standard Model are widely regarded as the most promising dark matter
candidates. In most cases the lightest supersymmetric particle is the lightest
neutralino.

WIMPs can be detected either in collider experiments by observing miss-
ing energy and momentum in particle collisions, directly via the observation
of the nuclear recoils from the scattering of WIMPs off nuclei [6][7][8][9] or
indirectly [10] via the observation of products from WIMP self-annihilations.

Most indirect experiments rely on the fact that DM particles present
in the Galactic halo may lose energy by interacting with nuclei of massive
objects, as for example the Sun and the Earth itself, and may accumulate in
the centre of these bodies under their gravitational potential. As shown in
Section 2, the accumulated DM particles may then self-annihilate. Among
the final-state particles of the decay products, neutrinos can almost freely
escape the massive objects, reaching neutrino telescopes located near the
surface of the Earth. The energy spectrum of the produced neutrino flux
depends on the specific nature of DM particles [11] (in the following, the
WIMP scenario will be assumed), the DM annihilation channel and mass.
The expected neutrino event rates are also a function of the DM local density
and velocity distribution and of the chemical composition of the celestial
trapping object.

Searches for neutrinos from the direction of the Sun [12][13][14][15][16] of
the Galactic Centre [17][18] and of the Earth core [19][20] have already been
carried out by neutrino telescopes and other neutrino experiments [21][22].

WIMPs become gravitationally bound to the Earth if their velocity is
smaller than the escape velocity from Earth, which ranges from 11.1 km/s
to 14.8 km/s (at the surface and at the centre respectively). The velocity
of WIMPs follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the canonical value
for the velocity dispersion is 270 km/s (this value is subject to considerable
uncertainty [4]). Under these conditions, only a small fraction of WIMPs
would lose enough energy to become captured if there is a large difference
between the mass of the WIMP and the mass of the nucleus the particle is
scattering on. Capture of WIMPs in the Earth is expected to be dominated
by spin-independent elastic scattering on the most abundant heavy nuclei,
mainly iron and nickel.

In this paper, an indirect search for DM towards the centre of the Earth
using data collected in 2007 – 2012 by the ANTARES neutrino telescope is
presented. In section 2, the WIMP capture process in the Earth is explained
and quantified. In section 3, the ANTARES neutrino telescope, the back-
ground events and the potential signal events for this search are presented.

The event reconstruction methods, the selection criteria and their optimisa-
tion are described in section 4. In section 5, the results of the analysis are
presented and discussed.

2 Capture and Annihilation of WIMPs in the Earth

The process of WIMP annihilation in the centre of the Earth produces stan-
dard model particles (such asW+W−, τ+τ−, bb pairs) that include neutrinos
in their final-state decay products. Muon neutrinos (in the following, ‘neu-
trinos’ refers to the sum νµ + νµ) can be detected via up-going muons from
their interaction with matter.

According to [4], the WIMP annihilation rate ΓA(t) in the Earth can be
written as (here and in the following, c was set to 1):

Here N(t) is the total number of WIMPs at time t after the formation of
the Earth. The equilibrium time scale τ determines the time needed for
WIMPs to reach equilibrium between capture and annihilation in the core
of an astrophysical object. It depends on the annihilation factor CA and on
the capture factor CC . It can be shown that equilibrium is generally not
reached in the case of Earth. CA is defined [23] as

CA =

Here 〈σAv〉Earth is the thermally averaged annihilation cross-section times
speed, mχ is the WIMP mass and V0 is the effective volume of the Earth,
taken from [23]. The capture factor CC depends on the unknown WIMP
mass and cross-section for interactions with Earth nuclei, the velocity of
WIMPs in the halo and their local mass density. It can be written as

CC =

The local halo mass density ρ
χ
0.3 is estimated from observations and it is

expressed in units of 0.3 GeV/cm3; the WIMP velocity dispersion v̄270, ex-
pressed in units of 270 km/s, can be estimated through simulations. The
WIMP cross-section depends on the chemical composition of the Earth and
on the scattering cross-section of WIMPs to protons and neutrons. The

5



dominant process is due to spin-independent elastic scattering of WIMPs
to nucleons, whose cross-section is usually referred to that of the WIMPs
to protons, denoted as σSIp . In fact, for neutralinos and most other WIMP
candidates, the spin-independent scattering cross-sections on protons and
neutrons are roughly identical [24]. The Earth composition enters in the
factors F ∗i (mχ) and whose sum is taken over all kinds of nuclei present in
the Earth.

and annihilation rates in the Earth reach equilibrium. The annihilation
rate ΓA(t) then does not depend on 〈σAv〉Earth anymore and Eq. 2 simply

Assuming in Eq. 3 a thermally averaged annihilation cross-section 〈σAv〉Earth

equal to Eq. 1, i.e. the same as during the freeze out of WIMPs, the equilib-
rium condition is not generally satisfied. Under this condition, τ ∼ 1011 y,
while the age of the Earth is t∗ ∼ 4.5 · 109 y. In the case of non-equilibrium,

The annihilation rate (and thus the flux of neutrino-induced muons) depends
quadratically on the capture factor and linearly on the annihilation factor.

The results presented in this paper assume spherically distributed DM
with a Gaussian velocity distribution (standard halo model). The main
astrophysical uncertainty that affects our result arises from the existence of
a co-rotating structure made from materials accreted into the disc, known
as dark disc [26][27]. As reported in [28], simulations show that the local
density of the dark disc could range from a few percent up to ∼ 1.5 times
the density of the local dark matter halo, and with velocity distribution that
varies for different scenarios. The presence of a dark disc with high phase
space density at low velocities enhances WIMP capture rates in the Earth
up to a factor of 30 [29]. As the muon flux in a neutrino telescope depends
on the annihilation rate (Eq. 7) and thus from the square of the capture

rate, CC , the presence of a dark disk could enhance our signal up to three
orders of magnitude. For similar searches of DM signal from the Sun, the
increase is an order of magnitude, as the muon flux depends on CC . Direct
searches are affected in a different way from this uncertainty, as scattering
rate simply increases with the local density. In addition, as direct detection
looks for energetic scattering of WIMPs, they are sensitive to WIMPs with
high-velocity (less affected by the presence of the dark disc), while indirect
detection techniques are sensitive to the low part of the velocity distribution.
Thus, limits expressed in the following sections are very conservative with
respect to the presence of a dark disk.

3 Signal and background modelling in the ANTARES
neutrino telescope

The ANTARES neutrino telescope is a deep sea water Cherenkov detec-
tor, located 40 km offshore from Toulon [30]. The detector is anchored at
the seabed, at a depth of about 2475 m. It consists of 885 optical modules

7



(OMs) [31]. Each optical module houses one 10” photomultiplier tube look-
ing downward with an angle of 45◦. The OMs are arranged in storeys, with 3
OMs per storey. The storeys are connected by a flexible cable [32] and form
lines, with 25 storeys per line and 12 lines in the detector1. The vertical
distance between storeys is 14.5 m, the length of a line is about 450 m, and
the horizontal spacing between the lines is 60− 70 m.

The detection principle of ANTARES is based on the observation of
Cherenkov photons, induced by charged secondary particles produced in
interactions of neutrinos around or inside the instrumented volume.

The study presented in this paper is based on muons from charged cur-
rent νµ + νµ interactions. WIMP masses between 25 GeV and 1000 GeV
are considered. Concerning the annihilation channels, several cases have
been studied: the bb channel (which gives a soft spectrum of neutrinos), the
τ+τ− or W+W− channels (which give a hard spectrum of neutrinos) and
the monochrome, non-SUSY, νµν̄µ channel. In each case, a 100% branching
fraction is assumed. The neutrino flux from DM annihilations in the Earth
is simulated and propagated to the detector using WimpSim [33][34]. The
code includes neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations in a complete
three-flavour treatment (the values θ12 = 33.58

2 are used). The ex-

pected neutrino fluxes in ANTARES for some cases are shown in Figure 2,
as a function of zenith angle and energy. It can be noticed that most of the
signal is expected from around the nadir.

The primary sources of background in this analysis consist of muons and
neutrinos which have their origin in interactions of cosmic rays with the
atmosphere of the Earth. The atmospheric muons are simulated with the
MUPAGE [35] package, which uses parametric formulae of the fluxes of muon
bundles [36]. For the background from atmospheric neutrinos, only charged-
current νµ + νµ interactions contribute significantly. For the conventional
neutrino flux, the parameterisation of [37] is used with a prompt contribution
according to [38]. For atmospheric neutrinos, oscillations are taken into
account in a two-flavour scenario (using the same values for ∆m231 and θ23
as reported before).

High quality data runs, defined according to environmental and data
taking conditions, are selected for this work (analogously to [39]). A detailed
Monte Carlo simulation is available for each data acquisition run [40].

Two different methods of event reconstruction are employed. The first
is a fast muon track reconstruction algorithm called Qfit [41]. It is based

on the minimisation of a χ2-like quality function which uses the differences
between expected and measured arrival times of the photons at the OMs
(time residuals). Qfit is well suited for low energy events, which are often
only detected by the OMs of a single line.

The second method is a more sophisticated muon track reconstruction
algorithm called Λfit [39]. It is based on the maximisation of a likelihood
function which again uses time residuals. Λfit is better suited for higher
energetic events.

4 Event selection and reconstruction

For this paper, data collected with the ANTARES neutrino telescope from
2007 to 2012, with a livetime of 1191 days have been analyzed. As shown
in Figure 2, the flux from dark matter annihilations is restricted to cer-
tain (narrow) cones from the centre of the Earth and to a certain energy
range. As the background increases quadratically with the search cone, the
size of the cone which maximizes the signal-to-background ratio is deter-
mined for different WIMP mass intervals. Furthermore, the energy range
in which neutrino candidates are searched for is determined as a function of
the WIMP mass and annihilation channel. The event selection criteria are

9



therefore chosen in a way that they restrict the minimal zenith angle and
maximal energy of the events. The former is done by selecting events which
are reconstructed by either Qfit or Λfit with a high zenith angle θQ and θΛ,
respectively. The latter is estimated by evaluating the muon range, as de-
scribed below. By discarding muons for which the estimated range exceeds
a certain threshold, events which are not likely to be signal are discarded.

To reduce the background from atmospheric muons, an additional re-
quirement strictly selects reconstructed zenith angles close to the vertical di-
rection. The criterion imposes that the hits are compatible with the expected
signature from muons arriving from a direction close to the vertical. For each
photomultiplier, a hit is defined by the arrival time of the first photon and
the number of photons (amplitude). For those events the vertical muon
range Rproj can be calculated as the distance between the highest (NH) and
lowest (NL) storey which registered a hit: Rproj = (NH−NL)×14.5 m. Near
the nadir, Rproj approaches the muon range, that is a proxy for the muon
energy, and consequently a proxy of the parent neutrino energy. Due to lim-
its of the detector geometry and reconstruction method, 3 ≤ NH−NL ≤ 24.
Rproj is used to select low energetic muons by requiring Rproj to be less or
equal to a given cut value.

Figure 3 shows the fraction of surviving events as a function of the true
neutrino energy and of the maximum estimated muon range. For example, if
one discards all events with a reconstructed vertical muon range > 217.5 m,
more than 99% of the vertical neutrinos of energy below 40 GeV would be
accepted. Using this kind of information, the signal acceptance for a given
WIMP mass and annihilation channel is estimated by folding the energy-
dependent fraction of surviving events with the energy-dependent flux of the
signal neutrinos.

The fraction of remaining background due to atmospheric neutrinos as
a function of the reconstructed vertical muon range is shown in Figure 4.
The cut on the reconstructed vertical muon range is particularly efficient
to enhance the signal-to-noise background for low WIMP masses and an-
nihilation channels with softer neutrino spectra. For instance, requiring
Rproj ≤ 217.5 m (the same value as in the example above), rejects more
than 20% of the neutrino background. For small WIMP masses and soft
annihilation channels, an additional selection criterion is used by requiring
that the lowest storey of the detector did not register a hit. This reduces
the background due to those atmospheric muons passing outside the instru-

just below it. Such events can produce upward going charged mesons [42]
and mimic vertically upward going muons entering the detector from below.

Figure 3: The simulated fraction of remaining events (coloured scale) as a
function of the true energy of the neutrino and the cut on the reconstructed
vertical muon range. Only events which are reconstructed with a zenith
angle of at least 175◦ are considered. The coloured scale can be understood
as the probability that a muon, originating from a neutrino with a certain
energy (y-axis), is accepted given a certain cut (x-axis) on its reconstructed
vertical range.

A final cut requires that the uppermost storeys of the detector did not
register any hit. This removes high-energy passing muons. As expected
(compare with Figure 2), harder zenith angle cuts and looser energy cuts
are more efficient for higher WIMP masses as presented in Figure 5. The
event selection criteria have been chosen with the approach for unbiased cut
selection for optimal upper limits [43]. The cut parameters have been tuned
individually for each annihilation channel and several WIMP masses in the
considered mass range. The WIMP annihilation rate ΓA(t) has been used
as scaling parameter of the source flux.

5 Results

In most ANTARES analyses, a signal-free control region of the same detector
acceptance can be defined (see for instance [44]). This is not possible for
this particular analysis. Consequently, the background estimate in the signal
region can only be derived from simulations. The reliability of the Monte
Carlo is verified by comparing the simulations and data in a test region that
presents almost the same detector response as the signal region, a similar
background, but contains only a minimal residual fraction of the signal.
Based on the results of WimpSim, this region corresponds to the interval of
reconstructed zenith angles between 160◦ and 170◦.

After the cuts, no simulated atmospheric muons were survive while atmo-
spheric neutrinos represent the irreducible background. The residual number
of atmospheric neutrinos after the application of cuts defined for the four
considered WIMP annihilation channels as a function of mχ are reported
in Figure 6. The same plot shows the number of selected events. When
comparing the signal to the background, some excess of events is observed
for certain channels and mχ. The uncertainty used in the computation of
the upper limits are due to the uncertainty on the background estimation
and on the detector acceptance. The latter affects both the number of signal
and background events. According to [45], a systematic uncertainty of 30%
on the atmospheric neutrino flux can be assumed. This is in agreement with
the ANTARES measurement of the atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum
[46], in which the overall normalization factor for atmospheric muon neu-
trinos is increased by ∼ 25% to match data. Concerning the uncertainties
related to the detector acceptance and efficiency, a systematic uncertainty
of 15% is assumed, following [47][48]. This overall 15% effect is mainly due
to the uncertainties on water properties, on the uncertainty on the optical
module (OM) angular acceptance and on OM efficiencies. The effect on sig-
nal and background was derived using dedicated Monte Carlo simulations
with modified water and OM parameters. To be conservative, in the upper
limit computation only the increases of the background level were consid-
ered. Finally, no atmospheric muon survives the cuts and their contribution
to the background is assumed to be equal to zero in all considered channels.
Because the number of simulated atmospheric muons corresponds only to
1/3 of the trigger rate, the uncertainty associated with this non contribution
to the background corresponds to 6.9 events, i.e. three times the 90% C.L.
upper limit assuming Poisson distribution. This is the most conservative
approach for setting upper limits.

When considering the above uncertainties, no significant excess of events

computes confidence intervals for the rate of a Poisson process with the
considered background and efficiency uncertainties using a fully frequentist
approach with the profile likelihood method [50].

Here ns is the number of expected signal events for this experiment in the
2007 – 2012 data according to simulations, assuming an annihilation rate
ΓA ≡ Γ0 = 1 annihilation/s. The values of ΓA,90% as a function of the WIMP
mass and annihilation channel are shown in Figure 7.

From the limits on the annihilation rate, limits on σSIp are derived as
described in section 2 assuming the natural scale (see Eq. 1) for the thermally
averaged annihilation cross-section times velocity. In this case, equilibrium
is not reached and only SUSY-allowed annihilation channels are considered.
The upper limits derived with this search on the spin-independent cross-
section σSIp as a function of the WIMP mass mχ are shown in Figure 8.
They are compared with limits from other indirect and direct dark matter
searches. The results presented here set the most stringent limits for indirect

capture factor is enhanced due to the heavy composition of the Earth.

In addition, a scenario where 〈σAv〉Earth is enhanced compared to the
value during the freeze out of WIMPs has also been considered. In this
case, the non-SUSY νµνµ annihilation channel is also considered. The upper
limits on σSIp as a function of 〈σAv〉Earth are shown in Figure 9, assuming
mχ = 52.5 GeV. This corresponds to a mass where the capture of the
WIMPs in the Earth is strongly enhanced due to the presence of the iron
resonance (Figure 1).

6 Conclusion

In this paper, the results of a search for neutrinos from dark matter annihila-
tion in the centre of the Earth using data taken with the ANTARES neutrino
telescope from 2007 to 2012 (corresponding to a lifetime of 1191 days) have
been presented. The number of neutrinos observed from the direction of the
centre of the Earth is compatible with the background expectation from at-
mospheric events. Assuming the natural scale for 〈σAv〉, the 90% C.L. upper
limits on the WIMP self-annihilation rates have been set as a function of
the WIMP mass. WIMP pair annihilation into either τ+τ−, W+W−, bb or
(non-SUSY) νµν̄µ channels have been considered. These are translated into
limits on the spin independent scattering cross-section of WIMPs off pro-
tons. A scenario where the annihilation cross-section for dark matter in the
Earth is enhanced compared to the value during the freeze out of WIMPs
has also been considered. The limits derived by this search are competitive
with other types of indirect dark matter searches. In particular, the results
presented here set the most stringent limits for indirect searches in the mass
interval from about 40 to 70 GeV.
