The development and broad use of passive acoustic monitoring techniques have the potential to help
assessing the large-scale influence of artificial noise on marine organisms and ecosystems. Deep-sea
observatories have the potential to play a key role in understanding these recent acoustic changes. LIDO
(Listening to the Deep Ocean Environment) is an international project that is allowing the real-time long-
term monitoring of marine ambient noise as well as marine mammal sounds at cabled and standalone
observatories. Here, we present the overall development of the project and the use of passive acoustic
monitoring (PAM) techniques to provide the scientific community with real-time data at large spatial
and temporal scales. Special attention is given to the extraction and identification of high frequency ceta-
cean echolocation signals given the relevance of detecting target species, e.g. beaked whales, in mitiga-
tion processes, e.g. during military exercises.

1. Introduction

The sea environment has always been filled with noise (from
animals and physical processes), although the last hundred years
have seen the introduction of many anthropogenic sources that
are currently contributing to the general noise budget of the
oceans. The extent to which noise in the sea impacts and affects
marine ecosystems has become a topic of considerable concern
to the scientific community. Anthropogenic noise, including acous-
tic signals necessary to study the marine environment, can inter-
fere with the natural use of sound by sea organisms. For
geophysicists, seismologists and oceanographers, sound is the
most powerful tool available to determine the geological structure
of the seabed and to look for oil and gas reserves deep below the
seafloor. As far as defense is concerned, sound is also used to detect
long-range targets. On the other hand, unnecessary or uninten-
tional noise sources, i.e. sources that are associated to specific
activities but contain no information (shipping for instance) are
constantly introduced in the marine environment.

The question is whether human-generated noise may interfere
with the normal use of sound by the marine animals (i.e. chronic
effects that may affect the long-term ability of marine animals to
develop their normal activities, reproduce, and maintain sustain-
able populations) or cause physical harm to them (i.e. acute effects
that may compromise the short-term ability of these animals to
survive).

Sound is a primary means by which many marine organisms
learn about their environment and is also, for many species of mar-
ine mammals and fish, the primary means of communicating, nav-
igating, and foraging. Biological sounds are equally diverse as
anthropogenic sources and can be emitted intentionally or unin-
tentionally by numerous organisms. Unintentional sounds could
comprise those produced by schools of fish swimming through
the ocean or the release of air by large groups of fish as they adjust
their buoyancy. Intentional sounds, including whale calls, dolphin
echolocation signals, and fish vocalizations, are believed to be pro-
duced in various species for communication, echolocation, and
perhaps even acoustic imaging of their environment.

To help managing the marine ecosystem environment and mit-
igating adverse effects of anthropogenic noise, there is a need to
understand more about the role of sound production and reception
in the behavior, physiology, and ecology of these species and to
provide insights into important aspects of their biology. This
understanding, in turn, previously requires the detection and iden-
tification of the sound sources of interest under real conditions.

Many cetacean species can be identified by their specific calls.
The recording of these signature acoustic signals can reveal their
presence in monitored areas. Since sound propagates efficiently
in water, the detection range of these signals can be quite large,
exceeding 100 km in favorable conditions for low-frequency calls
(e.g. Stafford et al., 1998; Simard et al., 2008), far above visual
detection methods. This acoustic potential to non-intrusively de-
tect and monitor cetacean species in their environment gave rise
to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques, for which re-
search is very active (review by Mellinger et al., 2007) as reveals
the series of biennale international workshops dedicated to this

rapidly evolving field since 2003 (Desharnais, 2004; Adam, 2006;
Moretti et al., 2008; Pavan, 2009). Localizing whales from their
sounds in their habitats was initiated by Watkins and Schevill
(1972) in the 1970s. This was rapidly applied to tracking whales
over large distances (e.g. Cummings and Holliday, 1985; Clark
et al., 1986). Advances in electronics, computers and numerical
analysis now make this PAM technology more accessible and
affordable to small research budgets. Various systems have been
used, including radio-linked systems, drifting buoys, and arrays
of autonomous recorders for versatile and long-term deployments
(c.f. Refs. in Simard et al., 2008). The goal of such PAM systems, is
the continuous mapping of presence and distribution of whales
over ocean basins (e.g. Greene et al., 2004; Sirovic et al., 2007; Staf-
ford et al., 2007; Mas et al., 2008) and assessing their densities, (e.g.
Ko et al., 1986; McDonald and Fox, 1999; Clark and Ellison, 2000),
sometimes in quasi real-time (e.g. Tiemann and Porter, 2004; And-
ré et al., 2005, 2007a,b; Delory et al., 2007). Their performance in
effectively accomplishing these tasks depends on the characteris-
tics of the targeted cetacean acoustic signals, the environment,
the type of equipment used, its deployment and configuration. This
performance may significantly vary from case to case.

However, in any case, PAM’s success first depends on the capac-
ity to isolate the target signals from the rest of sounds in which
they are embedded, especially for distant sources and low signal
to noise ratios (SNR). The acoustic signal source level, propagation
loss, and local background noise levels determine detection ranges
(c.f. Sirovic et al., 2007; Stafford et al., 2007; Simard et al., 2008).
Moreover, cetacean sounds vary considerably in time–frequency,
from infrasonic calls of baleen whales to ultrasonic clicks of
toothed whales, and in amplitudes among species and within a
species’ vocal repertoire (e.g. André and Kamminga, 2000; van
der Schaar et al., 2007a,b; Mellinger et al., 2007). Ocean noise level
also exhibits considerable variability in space and time, caused by
fluctuating natural sources, such as wind, ice, rain, sounds pro-
duced by various organisms, and anthropogenic sources such as
shipping (c.f. review NRC, 2003). Sound speed structures over the
water column can focus sounds from distant sources into sound
channels. The 3D spatial arrangements of the sources and the
hydrophones, their depth relative to the sound channel are there-
fore relevant to the PAM configuration.

In addition to the development and broad use of PAM tech-
niques, another challenge is to obtain long-term access to data
for the assessment of the large-scale influence of artificial noise
on marine organisms and ecosystems. Understanding the link be-
tween natural and anthropogenic acoustic processes is indeed
essential to predict the magnitude and impact of future changes
of the natural balance of the oceans. Deep-sea observatories have
the potential to play a key role in the assessment and monitoring
of these acoustic changes.

The Laboratory of Applied Bioacoustics (LAB) is currently lead-
ing an international project titled ‘‘Listen to the Deep Ocean Envi-
ronment (LIDO)’’ (LIDO, 2008) to apply and extent developed
techniques for passive acoustic monitoring to cabled deep sea plat-
forms and moored stations (André et al., 2008). The software
framework, called S-SONS, is currently active at the ANTARES
(http://antares.in2p3.fr/) neutrino observatory, the OBSEA (http://
www.obsea.es) shallow water test site, the NEPTUNE Canada
(http://www.neptunecanada.ca/) observatory, the JAMSTEC
(http://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/) network of underwater observato-
ries and at the NEMO (http://nemoweb.lns.infn.it/) site after the
observatory has been redeployed. Part of the system is being tested
for suitability on autonomous gliders in collaboration with the
NURC (Dassatti et al., 2011). The software contains several inde-
pendent modules to process real-time data streams. Among these,
there are dedicated modules for noise assessment, detection, clas-
sification and localization. To summarize the LIDO system, it takes
as input an acoustic data stream and produces as output the char-
acterization of the acoustic events that were detected in the data
(written to an XML file), spectrograms for quick visualization and
compressed audio. These outputs are then made available on the
Internet where they can be viewed with a specific application.
The public interface can be found at http://www.listentothe-
deep.net. It should be noted that the compressed audio is provided
to allow users to listen to a sound stream with minimal bandwidth
usage; but it is specifically not intended for scientific analysis. The
raw data is optionally stored locally if there is an interest in subse-
quent research.

Here we present the LIDO real-time acoustic data concept and
management, illustrated by several results from the above obser-
vatories, with a special attention given to the extraction and iden-
tification of cetacean echolocation signals (ultrasonic cetacean
clicks), including beaked whales’ and delphinids’, noise from ship-
ping and sperm whale clicks, for their relevance in mitigation
processes.
2. Objectives

Through the use of the information provided by the existing
and future underwater observatories where the automatic detec-
tion, classification and localization (DCL) processes are applied,
the purpose of the LIDO framework is to (1) evaluate the human
and natural contributions to marine ambient noise and describes
the long-term trends in ambient noise levels, especially from hu-
man activities; (2) outline the research needed to evaluate the
impacts of ambient noise from various sources (natural, biologi-
cal, commercial, offshore, and acoustic-based ocean research) on
marine species, especially in biologically sensitive areas; (3) re-
view and identify gaps in existing marine noise databases and
recommend research needed to develop a model of ocean noise
that incorporates temporal, spatial, and frequency-dependent
variables.

Although LIDO concentrates primarily on the effects of noise on
marine mammals, it also considers other species as well (e.g. fish)
that are part of the ecosystem and food web on which marine
mammals depend. The frequency band to be studied ranges from
1 to 200,000 Hz (200 kHz) depending on the acoustic sensor char-
acteristics, since this is the entire bandwidth that various marine
organisms are capable of detecting. An important requirement
for the LIDO system is that measurements and analysis results
are obtained in real-time, or at least without the need to physically
recover submerged hardware. The results are then readily available
for mitigation procedures when monitoring is performed in an area
with active sea-operations such as construction or ocean acoustic
tomography.

The following key issues are considered to be essential to
achieving these objectives and to evaluating the human and natu-
ral contributions to ocean noise:

� to develop quantitative relationships between man-made noise
and levels of human activity;
� to establish a long-term ocean noise monitoring program cover-

ing, depending on hydrophone sensitivity, the frequency band
from 1 to 200,000 Hz;
� to conduct research on the distribution, migration patterns,

characteristics, identification and classification of marine bio-
logical sounds and organisms, especially marine mammals;
� to monitor ocean noise in geographically diverse areas with

emphasis on marine mammal habitats and allow comparison
at large temporal and spatial scales;
� to examine the impact of ocean noise on nonmammalian spe-

cies in the marine ecosystem.

The design and implementation of research on the effects and
control of man-made noise in the marine environment must be
an interdisciplinary enterprise. Contributions and expertise are
needed from electronics experts on the choice and calibration of
transducers for monitoring natural, biological and anthropogenic
sound sources, from physical acousticians to process signal/infor-
mation provided by the observatories, from marine biologists to
identify species sound-related behavior and seasonality and large
scale data, from psychoacousticians to assess species related hear-
ing sensitivities and from statisticians for the initial design, data
analysis and presentation.

3. System description and performance

3.1. Automated real-time monitoring of acoustic events and noise

PAM has the potential to be implemented continuously and
over long time periods, resulting in large and representative data-
sets. However, this inevitably leads to a high rate of audio data
acquisition that could be problematic when the data need to be
transmitted, stored, or analyzed. For observatories with a limited
power supply or bandwidth, e.g. radio-linked autonomous buoys,
transmission, storage, or additional data processing (e.g. auto-
mated classification, data compression) has to be optimized,
which may imply the loss of potentially interesting information.
For cabled observatories where power and communication are
not an issue, limitations arise with storage. In any case, on the
one hand, there is a need for immediate mitigating actions when
facing potentially harmful acoustic events; on the other hand,
there is a necessity for long-term monitoring of noise. This calls
for the development of a robust technique that provides both his-
torical statistical data on noise and alarms on specific acoustic
events, i.e. a fully automated real-time detection and classifica-
tion system that provides this information while minimizing
technical costs (storage, computation time). The approach pro-
posed here divides the recording bandwidth in frequency bands
that cover the acoustic niche of most species and applies a series
of detectors and classifiers. The information from the detection
and classification modules is then used by localization and track-
ing algorithms in order to monitor the presence and activity of
cetacean species. This allows assessment of the short-, medium-
, and long-term contributions of noise sources in these acoustic
niches (André et al., 2010; Houégnigan et al., 2010; Zaugg et al.,
2010).

The detection module contains triggers for short transient
sounds (such as echolocation signals from toothed whales, but also
cavitation sounds from ship propellors or explosions from air
guns), short tonal signals (such as dolphin whistles, depth sound-
ers, calls from baleen whales) and constant tonal sounds (constant
frequencies that can be caused by artefacts from electrical interfer-
ence or shipping traffic). Other characteristic sounds that are not
covered by these detectors are being added when encountered at
platforms.

The classification module is built to function on the output of
the detector. Currently, it operates on transient sounds. The focus
is on transients since these signals can come from a much larger
number of different sources than other types of signals. When de-
tected, transients are isolated from the data stream and a number
of features are extracted (detailed below). The features are used as
inputs to a neural network classifier. Based on training sets, radial
basis function networks are created capable of distinguishing be-
tween classes.

The localization module is specifically designed to be used with
small hydrophone arrays, such as those that are available at NEMO
or ANTARES, and performs localization on detected transient
sounds. Due to the array limitations, it primarily computes a bear-
ing estimate. Range estimates are under consideration based on
tracking a particular classified source with known source levels,
but these are not yet implemented. As the system needs to operate
in real-time, not all transients that are detected are always pro-
cessed; especially shipping traffic can create large numbers of im-
pulses in a short time period. Priority is given to signals that were
classified and originated from a source of interest.

3.2. The LIDO DCL architecture

Fig. 1 shows an overview of the processing done in the LIDO
framework. Phase 1 and 2 are preliminary steps that must ensure
the real-time process of the data. In undersea recordings back-
ground noise is always present (sea noise). The first phase of the
system detects broad classes of events. The second phase classifies
segments into more specific classes. Most of the time this sea-noise
presents little interest but fills terabytes of unnecessary storage.
The challenge is here to be able to find a reliable set of filters or
detectors able to extract the interesting information that would
be included with the background-noise, like dolphin calls and so-
nar, sperm and beaked whale clicks, or noise produced by ship en-
gine. A detector is an algorithm that accepts a segment of acoustic
data as input and gives a single number as output. The output
number is usually designed such that (1) it is equal or close to zero
if only sea-noise is present in the segment (2) it takes larger values
if an additional signal is present. By applying a threshold on the
output number, the detector can take a decision, that is: automat-
ically label the segments as ‘‘sea-noise-only’’ vs. ‘‘presence of inter-
esting signal’’. The concept of the broad categories returned by
Phase 1 is to narrow the amount of data supplied to the more
sophisticated algorithms of Phase 2. These Phase 2 algorithms
are slightly slower. Hence, narrowing the input in quantity allevi-
ates the slowness and improves the overall robustness by having a
well-defined input.

The system’s modules can be run independently, thereby allow-
ing to implement smaller and faster versions, aimed at specific
classes of sounds or mitigation scenarios, like the detection of
beaked whales and delphinid species. New modules can be incor-
porated into the system.

Although LIDO considers the whole bandwidth and a series of
detectors and classifiers (see Sections 3.4 and 3.5), this paper espe-
cially pays attention to the extraction of ultrasonic cetacean clicks
(UCC), belonging to beaked whales and delphinids from sperm
whale clicks (SWC) and Impulsive Ship Noise (ISN). The frequency
bands of interest here are the following (assuming a 96 kHz sam-
pling rate):



M. André et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 63 (2011) 18–26 21
3.2.1. 1–5 and 5–20 kHz bands
Impulsive Ship Noise, broadband shipping noise and ambient

noise are generally more intense at lower frequencies and can
mask some other impulse sources. A better detection will be per-
formed in the band 5–20 kHz. However, distant/off-axis sperm
whale clicks have most energy below 5 kHz and would be better
detected in the band 1–5 kHz.

3.2.2. 20–46 kHz band
This band is aimed at detecting ultrasonic impulses (e.g. beaked

whales and delphinid sonar).

3.3. Noise measurement module

The noise measurement module computes statistics on fixed
length intervals, such as sound maxima, RMS level and third octave
levels, especially following the recommendations of the European
Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC). In particular,
the Descriptor 11.1 (Tasker et al., 2010) focuses on high amplitude
impulsive anthropogenic sound within a frequency band between
10 Hz and 10 kHz, assessed using either sound energy over time
(Sound Exposure Level SEL) or peak sound level of the sound
source, while the Descriptor 11.2 addresses background noise
without distinguishable sources that can lead to masking of biolog-
ical relevant signals, alter communication signals of marine mam-
mals, and through chronic exposure, may permanently impair
important biological functions. This latter indicator requires a set
of sound observatories to enable trends in anthropogenic back-
ground noise to be followed (noise within the 1/3 octave bands
63 and 125 Hz, center frequency).

Fig. 2 shows an example of noise measurements conducted dur-
ing a full day at the ANTARES observatory (RMS level of the whole
bandwidth, and in the bands 1–5, 5–20, 20–110 kHz) allowing to
extract the contribution of sources in different bandwidths, and
their relationship with the presence of sperm whales and dolphins
during the same time period.

3.4. Detection module

Detection of acoustic events are handled by two different algo-
rithms, one for impulsive sounds and one for short tonal sounds.
Details on these algorithms are described in Zaugg et al. (2010).
Fig. 2. Noise measurements and indicators of sperm whale and dolph
The impulse detector processes the data in a configurable num-
ber of frequency bands: e.g. 0–500 Hz, 500–1, 1–5, 5–20 kHz,
above 20 kHz. This separation is used to allow different configura-
tion parameters specifically designed to trigger on longer low fre-
quency or shorter high frequency impulses, covering from baleen
whale calls to beaked whale ultrasonic clicks. The left image in
Figs. 3 and 5c show example detections obtained in the band above
20 kHz on ultrasonic cetacean echolocation signals (single clicks
and buzzes) and Fig. 5(a–c) show detections obtained in the same
band on sperm whale clicks and shipping impulses.

The short tonal detector is configured to detect whistle like
sounds from dolphins or tonal calls produced by various baleen
whale species. For the LIDO system detection is usually done in
three different frequency bands: below 5, 2–20 kHz and above
20 kHz. The lowest band is aimed at baleen whales, the middle
band at dolphins (including orcas). The highest band has not been
triggered by biological events so far, but it can be triggered by spe-
cific anthropogenic sources, such as the line localization echo
sounder at ANTARES. The right image in Fig. 3 shows detection
on vocalizations of a humpback whale. On the various platforms
where the LIDO system has been running this detection procedure
has so-far been sufficient as there were not many other sources
that produce these particular sounds. The detector is configured
in such a way that it almost functions as a classifier by itself (e.g.
Fig. 3). As an example, at the ANTARES site, the echo sounder that
is used for localization of the lines often triggers the short tonal
detector. As these are in frequencies over 20 kHz, they are easily
separated from dolphin whistles, which have a specific detector
operating in the range between 2 and 20 kHz.

For real-time consideration, both algorithms operate in con-
stant time, regardless of the number of detections that are encoun-
tered. The execution time does depend on the bandwidth that the
detector operates on. The currently implemented version evaluates
all detections (4-impulse and 3-short tonal bandwidths) in a 22 s
segment of data sampled at 96 kHz in under a second on a single
core from an Intel XEON X3360 (2.8 GHz).

3.5. Classification module

For feature extraction and classification of the sources a more
complex approach was adopted (Fig. 4). The current classification
algorithm that is used in the LIDO system is a continuation of an
in presence at the ANTARES observatory on May the 7th, 2010.

interference lines; on the right the short tonal detector acting on humpback whale vocalizations (detected regions are shown as horizontal black bars).

algorithm described in Zaugg et al. (2010). This proposal suggests
defining classes for sperm whale echolocation signals, ultrasonic
cetacean impulses (beaked whale and dolphin echolocation sig-
nals), shipping impulses, dolphin whistles and baleen whale vocal-
izations. More classes may be added on demand, but to allow
generalization it requires a set of training data of sufficient quality.

A short piece of audio (21 ms) centerd on the impulses that are
detected in Phase 1 is extracted and used to extract features. In this
process, impulses are characterized by their temporal and spectral
shape (noted E(xi) where xi represents either time-bins or fre-
quency-bins) with the following descriptors:

A measure of location : m1 ¼

These descriptors are evaluated both in the time and frequency
domains leading to nine features (location is not used for the tem-
poral shape). In addition, sequences of transients are characterized
by inter-pulse intervals, as some sources can produce much more
stable sequences than others.

Then, the features obtained for an impulse enter an RBF neural
network and give as output: p(SWC), p(ISN) and p(UCC), which are
the estimated probabilities of being a SWC, ISN or UCC. The compu-
tation of the features takes a small amount of time, but much less
than the time necessary for the detection modules. Classification as
it runs on current LIDO servers can be considered instantaneous.
Fig. 4. Overview of the classification procedure applied to ultrasonic cetacean
clicks. A short frame centerd on a detected impulse is automatically identified by a
detector stage. This frame is used to extract nine features. These features are passed
to a trained RBF neural network, which returns the estimated probability that the
impulse is an ultrasonic cetacean click, short p(UCC).
3.5.1. Assessment of classification performance
The detection and classification at the level of individual im-

pulses are illustrated with examples. The plots in Fig. 5, show spec-
trograms of recordings with (Fig. 5a) impulses from ship noise
(ISN), (Fig. 5b) sperm whale clicks (SWC) and (Fig. 5c) a regular
train of ultrasonic cetacean clicks (UCC) embedded in ISN. In a first
phase, detection was performed in the band 20–46 kHz. The de-
tected position of impulses is shown as black crosses (arbitrarily
plotted at 24 kHz). In a second phase, the automated assignment
of p(UCC) was obtained for each detected impulse via a neural net-
work. The values of p(UCC) are represented by the vertical position
of the white dots (plot floor: p(UCC) = 0, plot ceiling: p(UCC) = 1).
Many of the ISN and SWC had energy above 20 kHz, hence they
were detected in the first phase. The second phase processing by
the neural network recognized true UCCs by assigning them values
of p(UCC) close to 1 while most of the SWCs and ISN were assigned
values close to 0. The final output, NUCC, which represents a whole
segment of 22 s, was obtained via a weighted sum of the p(UCC)
that were larger than 0.5.

Shown in Fig. 6 are the results of the detection and classification
of impulses at the level of 22 s segments. These results were ob-
tained on data from the NEMO-ONDE deep-sea observatory (Mig-
neco et al., 2008; Riccobene et al., 1995), which is bottom
mounted at �2000 m depth east of the Sicilian coast. A neural net-
work was trained with a data set recorded in May and tested with a
data set recorded in August 2005 (a) and vice versa (b). Each dot
represents a segment of 22 s of audio containing almost exclu-
sively impulses from one of the three classes: impulses from ship
noise (ISN, squares), sperm whale clicks (SWC, circles) and ultra-
sonic cetacean clicks (UCC, triangles). The class UCC includes clicks
from delphinids and beaked whales. Upper subplots: the number
of detected impulses (Ndet) in the 20–46 kHz band is shown. Many
ISN and SWC and all but on UCC segments triggered this detector.
Lower subplots: the final output is NUCC, the estimated number of
UCCs per segment. When a threshold was set at a value of 2 (gray
line), the percentage of correctly detected UCC segments from all
UCC segments was 97% and 100%, respectively for test data from
August (a) and May (b). The false detection rate, that is, the per-
centage of detected non-UCC segments from all non-UCC segments
was 6% and 17%, respectively. A a posteriori scrutiny of non-UCC
segments with a NUCC > 2 revealed that most contained UCCs that
had been missed during manual assignment of the segments to
the three classes. The resulting corrected false detection rate was
2% and 1%, respectively.
3.6. Localization module

In principle, precise source localization requires detailed knowl-
edge of the marine environment (sea state, sound speed profile,

etc.) and hydrophone array configuration (calibration, position,
dimensions with regard to the frequency content of the signals of
interest, etc.). Where detection and classification can be general-
ized to work on most archived data (perhaps with the help of a fil-
ter that is applied before analysis to remove specific sound
characteristics that complicate the analysis), the multichannel
and space–time nature of localization protocols create additional
difficulties. When the LIDO system is used in combination with
compact hydrophone arrays, the primary objective is to compute
a real-time estimate of the bearing of a source. Once more informa-
tion becomes available about the source (e.g. the class, the track), a
range indication can be made based on the received signal, source
level estimates and the track.

The algorithms used for bearing estimation in the LIDO system
are described in Houégnigan et al. (2010). High real-time perfor-
mances were obtained with the steered response power algorithm
(space–time correlation between hydrophones) in combination
with the generalized cross correlation (ROTH or SCOT filters).
Fig. 7 is reproduced from Houégnigan et al. (2010) and shows
localization of an example impulse, a sperm whale track with
slowly varying azimuth and the track of a ship where the azimuth
changes much faster (sources were manually identified).

The latest implementation of this module was optimized for
tetrahedral arrays and more generally for a compact array, but it
can also provide bearing estimations for arrays with less than four
hydrophones. The performance of the algorithm being linked to the
number of hydrophones and array geometry, the quality of the
estimation has to be evaluated case by case, for example in that
case, e.g. a single line towed array will providing bearing estimates
with a lesser accuracy.

A current implementation of the SRP algorithm combined with
a SCOT filter processes 50 impulses in under 2 s on the same sys-
tem as described in the detection section. In a real-time situation
the number of impulses that are localized are limited by setting
a maximum number of seconds that the algorithm is allowed to
run. When there are many impulses, preference will be given to
classified biological impulses.
4. Discussion and conclusion

4.1. Real-time detection and classification of cetacean clicks

The classification of ultrasonic cetacean clicks showed that
many segments with sperm whale clicks and impulsive shipping
noise did not trigger the high frequency detector at all. This is be-
cause these two classes of impulses often do not carry energy
above 20 kHz. On the other hand, almost all segments with ultra-
sonic cetacean clicks were clearly detected. Hence, the detection
stage allowed for a significant reduction in the data volume passed
to the subsequent classifiers by selecting only segments with po-
tential ultrasonic cetacean clicks. It is also clear that this detector

is not suitable to detect sperm whale clicks or impulsive shipping
noise, since it processes the band 20–46 kHz. For these two classes,
similar detectors and classifiers have been developed in the band
1–20 kHz.

The separation of ultrasonic cetacean clicks from sperm whale
clicks and impulses from ship noise is an easy task for a human
operator due to the higher frequency location of the ultrasonic
cetacean clicks. The interest of the presented modules lie in their
ability to perform this classification in a fully automated way with
a very high accuracy and to work reliably over time periods of at
least several months.

The detection stage returned an accurate estimation of the im-
pulse’s location. We showed here that this estimated location can
be effectively used by the second stage classifiers. The automated
location could also be directly used by other second stage algo-
rithms. For example, by sequence analysis procedures that auto-
matically estimate the inter click interval of regular click trains,
which could enable to draw conclusions on the taxonomic group
that emitted the clicks (e.g. delphinids, beaked whales).

The feature extraction performed before the classification is a
computationally intensive step and should only be performed
when necessary. Clicks from cetaceans are generally produced in
relatively rapid trains and in a segment of 22 s, we typically expect
to find several dozens of clicks. Time can be saved by classifying
only segments with a sufficiently large number of detected im-
pulses. In this way segments with isolated detections will not be
processed at all by the second stage modules.

The simplicity and modularity of the method enables it to be
easily adapted to other classes of impulsive sounds. For example,
the method has been used with success to separate sperm whale
clicks from impulsive shipping noise. In the future, it could be
adapted to separate cetacean species.

In a scenario of real time mitigation, for example during navy
exercises or seismic surveys, the recorded data stream can be ex-
pected to be contaminated with a relatively constant background
of impulsive shipping noise. The detection of cetacean echolocation
clicks is especially important for taxa that produce little or no tonal
calls such as beaked whales or the sperm whale. In this context, a
real time detection method such as the one presented here repre-
sents a very promising option, since it is able to accurately detect
ultrasonic cetacean clicks with a very small false detection of ship-
ping impulses.

4.2. Data distribution

One of the problems with continuous data acquisition is that the
data is not well accessible for research. Large amounts of data are
recorded that have little interest, and often a research objective
only includes a very specific acoustic event. Automatically scanning
all data for this particular event is possible, but time consuming and
requires all data to be copied or made accessible from stored hard
disks or tape. Real-time monitoring and analysis as presented in
this paper not only gives the opportunity to store those parts of
the data that may be of interest for future research, leading to much
smaller storage requirements, but also maintains a complete data-
base of events that occurred in an area, which in turn gives imme-
diate insight in the local acoustic conditions and allows those
interested to directly select data that is of possible research interest
(assuming that it was included for detection, otherwise a specific
detection module can always be added to a monitoring platform).

It is expected that the database will help building and understand-
ing long-term trends in migration patterns, distribution and rela-
tionship with noise of large cetacean species.

4.3. Underwater observatories

The needs for a network of ocean observing systems cross many
applied and research areas of earth and marine science. Many of the
science areas that can be examined using such systems have direct
impacts on societal health and well being and our understanding of
ocean function in a changing climate. In particular, the European
Seas Observatory NETwork (ESONET) Network of Excellence has
been evaluating observatory design requirements, data manage-
ment needs, standardization and interoperability, social implica-
tions, outreach and education, as well as financial and legal
aspects of developing such a system. Additionally, several demon-
stration missions are being carried out, in part, to evaluate various
technical options and the implementation of standardized data
management approaches. Observatory networks have great poten-
tial to address a growing set of Earth science questions that require
a broad and integrated network of ocean and seafloor observations.
ESONET NoE activities are also importantly integrating researchers
in the European Community, as well as internationally.

There is now wide recognition that research addressing science
questions of international priority, such as understanding the po-
tential impacts of climate change or geohazards like earthquakes
and tsunamis, and the effects of noise pollution, should be con-
ducted in a framework that can address questions across adequate
temporal and spatial scales.

The LIDO (Listening to the Deep-Ocean Environment) objectives
in terms of acoustic monitoring of noise and marine mammals di-
rectly converge to answer key questions on the evolution of the
oceans. They offer a unique opportunity to redesign research pro-
tocols, optimize the analysis, give open access to long-term time
series of data to the scientific community, reducing costs, improv-
ing our understanding of sound source interactions and mitigating
adverse effects of anthropogenic noise.

LIDO modular architecture of real-time acoustic data manage-
ment has been built to be easily adaptable not only to a great diver-
sity of supports (cabled observatories, radio-linked autonomous
buoys, towed arrays, gliders, ROVs, AUVs, etc.) but also to diverse
situations and configurations that take into account changes of
background noise, topography, oceanographic paramaters as well
as the changing presence of marine mammal species in areas of
interest.

4.4. A mitigation tool for the offshore industry

The LIDO acoustic detection, classification and localization
(DCL) system can be integrated in a series of expandable radio-
linked autonomous buoys that are timely deployed during offshore
operations. In that case, the DCL is performed at buoy level. A mesh
network allows buoy-to-buoy communication and an alert service
provides the ship/offshore platform with the DCL analysis: the
real-time continuous monitoring of cetacean presence.

The advantages are relevant:

� The LIDO DCL is automated and performed no matter sea state
or light conditions.
� No expertise is needed onboard the survey vessels/offshore

platforms since the alert service informs on the identification
and position of cetacean species that is displayed on a user-
friendly interface.
� The real-time continuous monitoring of cetaceans allows deter-

mining areas of exclusion depending on the sound source and
the species involved.
� The decision-taking regarding the management of the offshore
activity in presence of cetaceans falls under scientifically con-
trasted, objective and standardized procedures that ensure the
sustainable development of the activity.

The LIDO contribution to the real-time assessment of noise
interactions with cetaceans as well as to the long-term manage-
ment of anthropogenic sound sources represents a step toward
an improvement of the acoustic ecology status for marine
organisms.
