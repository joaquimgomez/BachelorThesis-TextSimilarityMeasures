Abstract

Advanced LIGO detected a significant gravitational wave signal (GW170104) originating
from the coalescence of two black holes during the second observation run on January 4th,
2017. An all-sky high-energy neutrino follow-up search has been made using data from the
Antares neutrino telescope, including both upgoing and downgoing events in two separate
analyses. No neutrino candidates were found within ±500 s around the GW event time nor any
time clustering of events over an extended time window of ±3 months. The non-detection is
used to constrain isotropic-equivalent high-energy neutrino emission from GW170104 to less than
∼ 4× 1054 erg for a E−2 spectrum.

1 Introduction

The first two confirmed observations of gravita-
tional waves (GWs) produced by the merger of
binary black holes (BBHs) were recently made
by the Advanced LIGO interferometers during
their observation run O1 [1, 2]. The second ob-
servation run of Advanced LIGO (O2) began
in November 2016 and stopped on August 25th,
2017. A BBH signal, GW170104, was recorded
during O2 on January 4th, 2017 at 10:11:58.6
UTC [3]. The false alarm rate corresponding to
the signal produced by this event is less than
one event over 70 000 years. The signal was pro-
duced by the coalescence of two black holes of
inferred masses of 31.2+8.4−6.0 M� and 19.4

+5.3
−5.9 M�

at a luminosity distance of 880+450−390 Mpc. The
GW source location was constrained to within
1608 deg2 of the sky at 90% credible level (re-
gion hereafter denoted as GW error box) by the
LALInference reconstruction algorithm [3].

Black holes with accretion disks can trigger
relativistic outflows where high-energy (TeV–
PeV) neutrinos (HENs) can be produced, if
hadronic particles are accelerated within the jets
[4, 5, 6]. Such an acceleration process can take
place if magnetic fields and a long-lived debris
disk remain from the stellar evolution of the

black-hole progenitors or if the binary system
resides in a dense gaseous environment (see e.g.
[7, 8, 9, 10]). Since the presence of an accretion
disk was not excluded in the case of GW170104,
the search for muon HENs emitted before or af-
ter the merger could bring valuable information
about the formation of relativistic outflows.

The Antares Collaboration has joined the
follow-up program of LIGO/Virgo detections
and has received GW alerts during the whole
O2 run period. The angular resolution of the
Antares neutrino telescope (∼0.4◦ at ∼10 TeV
for muon neutrinos) compared to the size of the
GW error box offers the possibility to drastically
reduce the size of the region of interest in case
of a coincident muon neutrino detection.

The Antares field-of-view (FoV), when re-
stricted to upgoing events, enclosed 51% of the
GW170104 error box provided by LIGO/Virgo
at the alert time. Coincidences in time and direc-
tion between the GW signal and reconstructed
muon HEN candidates were searched for in a
datastream of about 1.2 events per day, selected
from a total of O(100) upgoing neutrino track
candidates triggered by ANTARES per day [11].
No neutrino counterpart was found and the re-
sults of this real-time analysis were transmitted
via the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN)

3



circular #20370 [12] to the LIGO/Virgo follow-
up community in less than 24 hours after the
release of the alert. The results provided by
the Antares Collaboration were the only real-
time neutrino follow-up related to this event.
The absence of neutrino candidates both tem-
porally and spatially coincident with GW170104
allowed for deriving a preliminary upper limit on
the spectral fluence emitted in neutrinos by the
source at 90% confidence level (CL). This up-
per limit is expressed as a function of the loca-
tion of the source in equatorial coordinates and
assuming a standard neutrino spectral model
dN/dE ∝ E−2. This result was transmitted
to the LIGO/Virgo follow-up community in the
GCN circular #20517 [12].

The results of an updated high-energy neu-
trino follow-up of GW170104 using the Antares
neutrino telescope are presented in this paper.
The search for a transient neutrino counterpart
has been extended to the full sky with different
energy thresholds for events originating from be-
low and above the Antares horizon, and to a
larger emission timescale. The search described
hereafter was performed with the most recent
offline-reconstructed dataset, incorporating ded-
icated calibrations of positioning [13], timing [14]
and efficiency [15]. The analysis has been op-
timized to increase the sensitivity of the de-
tector at the time of the alert. Two neutrino
spectral models were assumed: a generic model
dN/dE = φ0E

−2 typically expected for Fermi
acceleration and a model with a high-energy

cutoff dN/dE = φ0E
−2exp

[
−
√

(E/100TeV)
]
.

The second model is expected for sources with
exponential cutoff in the primary proton spec-
trum [16]. Finally, systematic errors affecting
the corresponding upper limits on neutrino emis-
sion are accounted for.

The capabilities of the Antares detector and
the search procedures are summarized in Section
2. The constraints on the neutrino fluence and
total energy emitted in neutrinos derived from
the non-detection of a neutrino counterpart for
GW170104 are presented in Section 3. The con-
clusions are reported in Section 4.

2 High energy neutrino search

Antares [17] is an underwater neutrino tele-
scope located in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore
Toulon (France). It is composed of an array
of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), anchored at
a depth of 2475 m under the sea level. Neu-
trinos with energies above ∼ 102 GeV are de-
tected through the Cherenkov light induced by
relativistic particles created from the interaction
of neutrinos with matter. In addition to as-
trophysical neutrino signals, both atmospheric
muons and neutrinos can lead to detectable light
in the detector and are considered as background
events. However, only neutrinos can traverse the
Earth. Looking at upgoing particles in the detec-
tor reference frame allows for removing a large
part of the downgoing atmospheric muon back-
ground. Remaining mis-reconstructed downgo-
ing muons are further rejected by applying cuts
on the reconstruction quality parameters. In ad-
dition, the intense background of downward go-
ing atmospheric muons is drastically reduced by
the requirement for a joint time and space coin-
cidence with the GW time and spatial error box.
This allows for searching for a neutrino counter-
part for GW170104 in both upgoing and downgo-
ing datasets, which consist of events originating
respectively from below and above the Antares
horizon.

Considering the refined location probability

4



provided by the LIGO/Virgo LALInference soft-
ware [18], there is a 52% chance that the GW
emitter was below the Antares horizon where
any neutrino events from this part of the sky
would be seen as upgoing in the detector frame.
This corresponds to a 45% probability for the
source to be located inside the GW error box and
below the Antares horizon (see Fig. 1). To ex-
tend the overlap between the Antares FoV and
the GW error box, downgoing events have been
added to the search in an independent analysis.

All-sky Antares data have been searched for
track events produced by νµ and ν̄µ charged cur-
rent interactions coincident with GW170104 us-
ing a time window of ±500 s around the GW
transient (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). This time win-
dow was adopted as the standard search win-
dow for previous joint GW-HEN searches [19],
for instance in the case of GW150914 and
GW151226 [20, 21]. A search for a neutrino
counterpart within an extended time window of
±3 months has also been done using the online
datastream of Antares (Section 2.3).

2.1 Search below the Antares horizon

A binned search for coincident upgoing neu-
trinos was performed following a blind proce-
dure. The track reconstruction algorithm com-
putes both the neutrino direction, together with
an estimated error β, and a quality parameter
Λ [22]. This sample is dominated by background
events from mis-reconstructed downgoing atmo-
spheric muons, which deposit energy in the de-
tector through stochastic processes. The dataset
was reduced by adjusting Λ such that any event
passing the search criteria and located within
the GW error box, below the Antares hori-
zon, would lead to a detection with a significance
level of 3σ. This optimization was carried out on

Figure 1: Visibility map of GW170104 in equa-
torial coordinates. The sky regions below and
above the Antares horizon at the alert time
are shown in blue and white respectively. Events
that originate from the blue (white) region will
be seen as upgoing (downgoing) in the detector
frame. The red and black contours show the re-
constructed probability density contours of the
GW event at 50% and 90% credible level respec-
tively.

data outside the 1000 s time window used in this
search. A Monte Carlo simulation of the detec-
tor response [23, 24] at the alert time allows for
estimating the relative contribution of the atmo-
spheric neutrinos and the mis-reconstructed at-
mospheric muons to the background rate below
the Antares horizon and within ±500 s. A total
of 2.2×10−2 atmospheric neutrino candidates are
expected while the number of mis-reconstructed
downgoing muons amounts to 3.7× 10−2 events
over 2π sr.

After unblinding of the dataset, no event tem-
porally coincident with GW170104 was found.

2.2 Search above the Antares horizon

A search for coincident neutrino candidates de-
tected above the Antares horizon was carried
out by selecting downgoing events with β smaller
than 1◦. The cuts are optimized on a com-
bination of Λ and the number of hits used in
the reconstruction, where a hit corresponds to
a PMT signal above a given threshold. The
number of hits can be considered as a proxy
of the muon/neutrino energy. Indeed, downgo-
ing atmospheric muons are less likely to produce
a number of hits as large as that produced by
very high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Anew, the
selection criteria were optimized such that one
event occurring within the signal time window
of 1000 s and located inside the GW error box
located above the Antares horizon would lead
to a detection with a significance level of 3σ. The
final set of cuts is chosen as the one maximizing
the fraction of surviving signal events. The fi-
nal sample is mostly composed of atmospheric
muons with a total of 8.2 × 10−2 background
events expected above the Antares horizon
within ±500 s. The median neutrino energy that
would be detected by Antares for a E−2 signal
spectrum is about a factor of 10 higher for this
analysis compared to the search below the hori-
zon described in Section 2.1.

After unblinding of the dataset, no event tem-
porally coincident with GW170104 was found.

2.3 Extended time window search

The time window of ±500 s was chosen by as-
suming that if compact binary mergers are re-
lated to gamma-ray bursts then the neutrino sig-
nal should occur close in time to the GW emis-
sion. This time window is large enough to catch
potential precursor neutrino emission and time

offsets with respect to the GW signal [19]. For
completeness, to probe non-standard propaga-
tion scenarios similar to those described in [25],
a search for shifted and/or longer-lasting emis-
sion over ±3 months around the GW alert was
performed by looking for time clustering of up-
going neutrino events.

The events selected from the online datas-
tream used in the Antares real-time alert pro-
gram [11] are investigated for time clustering.
The spatial clustering of the events and their co-
incidence with the GW error box were investi-
gated a posteriori.

An unbinned likelihood search was performed
following the methodology applied in previous
analyses [26, 27]. For each combination of two
events a and b, a signal probability for the ith

event is defined as:

S
a,b
i =

H(tb − ti)H(ti − ta)
tb − ta

, (1)

with H the Heaviside function1 and ta and tb,
the detection time of events a and b (with ta <
tb). The background time probability for the i

th

event, Bi, is derived directly from the probability
density function (PDF) of the downgoing recon-
structed events. In this way, the background dis-
tribution reflects the evolution of the event rate
due to the variability of the data taking condi-
tions.

Given a dataset of N events, the likelihood
function La,b(ns) for a given pair of events oc-
curring at times ta and tb is defined as:

La,b(ns) =
N∏
i=1

[ns
N
S
a,b
i +

(
1−

ns
N

)
Bi

]
, (2)

where ns is the unknown number of signal events.
For each pair of events occurring at times ta and

1H(0) is defined as 1.

6



tb, the likelihood is maximized with respect to ns
to provide the best-fit number of events n̂s. The
test statistic (TSa,b) is computed from the likeli-
hood ratio of the background-only (null) hypoth-
esis over the signal-plus-background hypothesis
as:

TSa,b = −2 · log
[

T

tb − ta
L(ns = 0)
La,b(n̂s)

]
, (3)

where the term T
tb−ta

in the square brackets
is a trial factor. This quantity is needed to
correct for the fact that there are many more
independent small time windows than large
ones, which tend to favour very short flares.
The parameter T corresponds to the dataset
livetime. Given a sample of N events,

N(N−1)
2

values of TS were computed (one for each pair of
events a and b). The cluster that maximizes the
TS is finally considered as the most significant
one.

To compute the p-value of the most signifi-
cant cluster, O(10 000) pseudo-experiments were
generated, each of them consisting of N events
drawn randomly from the time PDF of the back-
ground. The fraction of trials for which the TS
value is larger than the one obtained from the
data is referred to as the p-value.

The most significant time cluster has been
found to contain n̂s=8.3 fitted signal events, oc-
curring between tmin(MJD)=57682.73398 and
tmax(MJD)=57685.62900 (tmax − tmin =2.89
days). It leads to a post-trial p-value of 70%
and is thus consistent with the background-only
hypothesis. In addition, the Antares events
contained in this time window are not spatially
compatible and do not overlap with the GW er-
ror box.

3 Astrophysical constraints

The non-detection of joint GW and neutrino sig-
nals is used to constrain neutrino emission from
the GW source. Upper limits on both the flu-
ence and the total energy emitted in neutrinos
are presented in the form of skymaps since the
sensitivity of Antares depends on the source
direction.

3.1 Constraints on the neutrino spec-
tral fluence

Upper limits at 90% CL on the neutrino fluence
from a point source within ∆t = ±500 s were
calculated using the null result and the detector
acceptance, estimated via a Monte Carlo simu-
lation of the detector response at the time of the
GW signal. This simulation is produced on a
run-by-run basis [23, 24] to account for the vari-
ation of the data taking conditions under the sea.
The two spectral models described in Section 1
were considered.

The number of neutrino events expected to be
observed by Antares from a point source at
declination δ and with a neutrino flux dN/dE
(in GeV−1 cm−2 s−1) in a time window ∆t is
given by:

Nevents = ∆t

∫
dN

dE
(E)Aeff(E, δ)dE, (4)

where Aeff(E, δ) is the effective area of Antares
at the alert time which take into account the ab-
sorption of neutrinos by the Earth and depends
on the neutrino energy E, the source declination
δ and the applied cuts.

The upper limit on the fluence, φ90%0 , is de-
fined as the fluence value that on average would
produce 2.3 detected neutrino events. Assuming

7



a dN/dE = φ0E
−2 neutrino spectral model, it is

derived as:

φ90%0 =
2.3

∆t
∫
E−2Aeff(Eν , δ)dE

, (5)

where the denominator refers to the instanta-
neous acceptance of the Antares detector at
the time of the alert computed between 1 GeV
and 100 PeV. Equation 5 also applies for the sec-
ond spectral model considered in this study. The
same methodology is used to derive φ90%0 in the
case of the second considered spectral model and
on the search above the horizon.

Fig. 2 shows the neutrino spectral fluence up-
per limit (φ90%0 ) for GW170104 as a function
of the source direction for both spectral mod-
els. Computed from the Monte Carlo simula-
tion, the energy range corresponding to the 5%–
95% quantiles of the neutrino flux below the
Antares horizon is equal to [3.2 TeV; 3.6 PeV]
for the dN/dE = φ0E

−2 spectral model and
[1.4 TeV; 270 TeV] for the model with exponen-
tial cutoff at 100 TeV. Above the Antares hori-
zon, the 5%–95% quantiles of the neutrino flux
are respectively equal to [120 TeV; 22 PeV] and
[53 TeV; 950 TeV].

The systematic uncertainties on the fluence
upper limits have been estimated by summing
quadratically i) the systematic error on the ac-
ceptance of the detector and ii) the uncertainty
related to the ability of the Antares run-by-run
Monte Carlo approach to accurately reproduce
the variable data taking conditions on short time
scales. This latter effect can become dominant
when looking for transient neutrino sources.

The systematic error on the acceptance has
been computed by reducing the efficiency of each
optical module by 15% in the detector simula-
tions. This leads to a 15% uncertainty on the
acceptance as detailed in [22].

respectively. Skymaps are defined in equatorial
coordinates.

The second source of uncertainty has been
constrained by quantifying the ability of the run-

by-run Monte Carlo to accurately reproduce the
evolution of the event rate observed in the data
from one run to another. Due to the low number
of events passing the optimized quality cuts, the
run-by-run agreement between data and Monte
Carlo can only be assessed by loosening the cuts,
on a data sample dominated by atmospheric
muon events. The variations of the muon rate
are well reproduced with a median relative varia-
tion between data and Monte Carlo smaller than
20%. In addition, the short-timescale fluctua-
tions of the event rate are smaller for signal neu-
trinos with a E−2 spectral model than for atmo-
spheric muons. This was expected since the de-
tector geometry is optimized for upgoing events.
Thus, the systematic error of 20% is considered
a conservative value.

The resulting total systematic uncertainty on
the fluence upper limits, which applies for both
upgoing and downgoing event searches, is 25%.

3.2 Constraints on the total energy
emitted in neutrinos

The GW signal contains also information on
the source distance which can be reconstructed
around the GW error box [28]. This information
can be used to derive an upper limit on the total
energy radiated in neutrinos as a function of the
direction as performed in [21].

The most likely value D(~x) of the distance
for each direction ~x is used to calculate the up-
per limit on the total isotropic-equivalent energy
emitted in neutrinos by the source as:

spectral models. The spectrum is integrated over
the range [100 GeV; 100 PeV]. The upper limits
as a function of source direction are shown in
Fig. 3 for the region corresponding to upgoing
events for Antares. It can be seen in Fig. 3
that the derived constraints depend on the posi-
tion on the sky as both the fluence upper limits
and the distance constraints do. The 5%–95%
range of values is [1 × 1054; 4 × 1054] erg and
[6× 1053; 4× 1054] erg, for the E−2 and the 100
TeV cutoff models respectively. The strongest
constraint is obtained at declination δ ∼ −17◦
with E < 5 × 1053 erg for a E−2 spectrum and
E < 3 × 1053 erg for the spectral energy distri-
bution with cutoff at 100 TeV. These values are
about 10% of the total energy of ∼ 3.6×1054 erg
emitted from GW170104 in gravitational waves.
The results obtained for downgoing events are
not provided since the neutrino fluence upper
limits are much weaker. The uncertainty on the
total energy emitted in neutrinos is estimated by
accounting for both the systematic error on φ90%0
(computed above) and the 1σ standard deviation
on the distance provided by the LIGO/Virgo
GW event reconstruction, leading to an average
value of ∼ 40%.

4 Conclusion

No neutrino emission associated with the third
confirmed binary black hole merger, GW170104
was detected in the Antares data. This
non-detection was used to derive an upper limit
to the total neutrino emission from GW170104
of ∼ 4×1054 erg, for a generic E−2 neutrino
spectrum and for a high-energy cutoff spectrum

magnitude as the ones previously published for
GW150914, LVT151012 and GW151226. The

strongest constraint, obtained at a declination
δ ∼ −17◦, shows that if the GW source is
located at this position on the sky, the total
energy emitted in neutrinos from GW170104 is
not more than 10% of the total energy emitted
in gravitational waves.
