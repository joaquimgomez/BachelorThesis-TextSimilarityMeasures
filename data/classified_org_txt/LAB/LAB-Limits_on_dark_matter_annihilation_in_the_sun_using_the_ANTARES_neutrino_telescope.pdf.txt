Abstract

A search for muon neutrinos originating from dark matter annihilations in the Sun is performed using the data recorded by
the ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to 2012. In order to obtain the best possible sensitivities to dark matter signals, an
optimisation of the event selection criteria is performed taking into account the background of atmospheric muons, atmospheric
neutrinos and the energy spectra of the expected neutrino signals. No significant excess over the background is observed and 90%
C.L. upper limits on the neutrino flux, the spin–dependent and spin–independent WIMP-nucleon cross–sections are derived for
WIMP masses ranging from 50 GeV to 5 TeV for the annihilation channels WIMP +WIMP→ bb̄,W+W− and τ+τ−.

1. Introduction

A number of independent observations in cosmology and
astrophysics point to the existence of large amounts of non–
baryonic matter in the Universe [1, 2]. These observations in-
dicate that there is approximately five times more of this dark
matter than of ordinary baryonic matter.

A well-motivated hypothesis is that dark matter is composed
of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that form ha-
los in which galaxies are embedded. There are different can-
didates for these WIMPs, amongst which, those provided by
supersymmetric models are currently the focus of the attention
of a large variety of searches. In the case of the minimal su-
persymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), the
lightest new particle is stable due to the conservation of a quan-
tum number, the R-parity, that prevents its decay to ordinary
particles [3]. If this lightest supersymmetric particle is also
electromagnetically neutral, it is a natural WIMP candidate for
dark matter. This lightest particle can annihilate into pairs of
standard model particles. Neutrinos, in particular, are the final
product of a large variety of decay processes, being therefore a
good candidate for an indirect search for dark matter. WIMPs
tend to accumulate in celestial objects due to scattering with
ordinary matter and the gravitation pull of these objects. This
is why indirect searches for dark matter concentrate on massive
astrophysical bodies such as the Earth, the centre of our Galaxy,
galaxy clusters or, as in this case, the Sun.

In this letter, an indirect search for neutrinos coming from
WIMP annihilations in the Sun is presented, using data
recorded by the ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to
2012. Different quality cuts on the data have been used to re-
duce the atmospheric background and optimise the sensitivity
of the analysis. Sensitivities to the signal neutrino flux, Φν,
and the spin–dependent and spin–independent WIMP-nucleon
cross–sections, σ

p
SD and σSI, are derived using three different

annihilation channels.

2. The ANTARES neutrino telescope

The ANTARES detector [4, 5] is an undersea neutrino tele-
scope anchored 2475 m below the surface of the Mediterranean
Sea and 40 km offshore from Toulon (France) at 42◦48′ N
and 6◦10′ E. ANTARES consists of 12 detection lines with 25
storeys per line and 3 optical modules with 10′′ photomultipli-
ers per storey. The detection lines are 450 m long and 60-75
m apart horizontally. Data taking started in 2007, when the first
five lines of ANTARES were installed. The detector installation
was completed in May 2008.

The main channel through which neutrinos are detected is via
the muons produced from high–energy muon neutrinos interact-
ing inside, or in the vicinity of, the detector. These muons move
at relativistic velocities and induce the emission of Cherenkov

light that is then detected by the optical modules. In this analy-
sis, only muon neutrinos detected this way will be considered.
In the following any mention of ‘neutrinos‘ will refer to muon
neutrinos and muon antineutrinos.

The flux of atmospheric muons from above the detector com-
prises the largest part of the background, with fluxes several
orders of magnitude larger than any expected signal. In order
to reduce the number of atmospheric muons, a cut on the el-
evation of reconstructed muon tracks is applied, ensuring that
only events that have been reconstructed as upgoing are used.
Since muons cannot cross the entire Earth, this cut rejects all
atmospheric muons except for a small fraction of misrecon-
structed events. The atmospheric neutrinos represent the irre-
ducible background for this search.

Atmospheric neutrinos from 10 GeV to 20 TeV are gener-
ated in the simulation using the standard ANTARES simulation
chain [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

The expected neutrino energy spectra from WIMP annihila-
tions in the Sun are calculated with the WIMPSim simulation
package [12]. The code takes into account the absorption of
neutrinos in the solar plasma and the neutrino oscillation inside
the Sun and on their way from the Sun to the detector. Neu-
trino spectra are calculated for 15 WIMP masses ranging from
50 GeV to 5 TeV and three annihilation channels assuming a
branching ratio of 100%:

WIMP +WIMP→ bb̄, τ+τ−,W+W−. (1)

As shown in [13], the distribution of the number of muon
neutrinos arriving at the Earth per pair of WIMPs self-
annihilating in the Sun’s core provides hard spectra for the τ+τ−

and W+W− and a soft spectrum for bb̄. Limits calculated for
dark matter candidate models will lie between these three chan-
nels, depending on their branching ratios. The energy spectrum
of each channel (see Figure 2 in [13]) is used to calculate the
acceptance for the particular annihilation channel in Equation
1. The acceptance is the neutrino effective area convoluted with
the energy spectrum corresponding to a given WIMP mass (see
Section 3).

Two reconstruction algorithms are used in this paper. The
first one is based on the minimisation of a χ2-like quality pa-
rameter, Q, of the reconstruction which uses the difference be-
tween the expected and measured times of the detected pho-
tons, taking into account the effect of light absorption in the
water[14]. The second algorithm consists of a multistep pro-
cedure to fit the direction of the muon track by maximising a
likelihood ratio, Λ, which describes the quality of the recon-
struction [15]. In addition to the Λ parameter, the uncertainty
of the muon track angle, β, is used for the track selection. These
two algorithms are respectively called here QFit and ΛFit. In
order to reach the best efficiency of reconstruction in the en-
tire neutrino energy range QFit is used for muon events recon-
structed in a single detection line (single-line events), and ΛFit
for muon events reconstructed on more than one detection line
(multi-line events).

Extensive comparisons between data and simulations have
been made elsewhere [16].

3. Analysis strategy

The search for WIMP annihilation in the Sun is performed
based on a maximum-likelihood analysis method. The max-
imisation of this likelihood function, which is fed with the
known information about the characteristics of the expected
background and signal, provides an estimate of the amount of
signal in the data. The extended likelihood function used for
ΛFit is

L(ns) =e
−(ns+Nbg)

Ntot
∏

i=1

(

nsS (ψi,Nhit,i, βi) + NbgB(ψi,Nhit,i, βi)
)

,

(2)

where Nbg is the expected number of background events, Ntot
is the total number of reconstructed events, ns (the variable that
changes during the maximisation process) is the number of sig-
nal events in the likelihood function, S and B are functions that
calculate the likelihood of an event to be either signal or back-
ground, ψi is the angular distance of the i-th event to the Sun,
Nhit,i is the number of hits used in the reconstruction of the i-th
event, which is used as an energy estimate and βi is the value
of the angular error estimate for the i-th event. S is calculated
from the simulation and B is calculated from time–scrambled
data.

For the QFit analysis the likelihood function looks different
since for that analysis only single–line events have been used.
For these events the azimuth angle can not be determined, so
that the difference between the zenith angle of the events and
the Sun has to be used instead of ψ:

L(ns) =e
−(ns+Nbg)

Ntot
∏

i=1

(

nsS̄ (θi, N̄hit,i,Qi) + Nbg B̄(θi, N̄hit,i,Qi)
)

,

(3)

where N̄hit,i is the number of hits summed up per storey used
for the reconstruction and θi is the difference in zenith angle
between the i-th event and the Sun. S̄ and B̄ are analogous to S
and B in the likelihood function used for the ΛFit data.

The angular resolution, which is used in S , is limited by the
kinematic angle between neutrino and outgoing muon [16].

In this analysis a blinding protocol is applied for optimising
the event selection. Blinding is achieved by using simulations
to calculate the sensitivities, and time–scrambled data for cal-
culating the background estimate.

In order to compute sensitivities and limits, 104 pseudo–
experiments are performed for each combination of WIMP
mass, annihilation channel and reconstruction strategy and for
each considered value of ns (ns ∈ {0, 1, 2...20}). In a pseudo–
experiment, a random distribution of background events is sim-
ulated according to the features of the recorded data by ran-
domising the right ascension of the events. Simulated signal
events are introduced into these pseudo–experiments. These
events are generated using the PSF and the signal characteris-
tics for a given reference flux, which are also used in the like-
lihood function. For each pseudo–experiment, ns is varied to

maximise the likelihood function (when ns = nmax). The test
statistic (TS) is then calculated as

TS = log10

(

L(nmax)
L(0)

)

. (4)

Distributions of TS values are generated for different num-
bers of injected signal events. The overlap of TS distributions
with inserted signal events and the TS distribution with only
background is a measure of the likelihood to mistake pure back-
ground for an event distribution with a certain amount of signal
in it. From this, the 90% C.L. sensitivities in terms of detected
signal events, µ90%, are obtained using the Neyman method
for generating limits [17]. The so-defined µ90% quantity cor-
responds to the lowest number of signal events so that 90% of
pseudo-experiments provide TS values above the median of the
TS distribution of the pure background case.

Event selection consists of cuts on the quality parameters Λ
and Q of the two reconstructions that are used in this analysis.
These cuts are optimised with respect to the sensitivities (i.e.
the model rejection factor). The optimum cuts for the relevant
mass ranges are Λ > −5.4 and β < 1◦ for ΛFit and Q < 0.8 for
the QFit analysis.

The sensitivities in terms of neutrino fluxes are calculated
using the acceptance, defined as

and T jeff is the effective live time for the j-th detector configu-
ration period. The effective area is defined as a 100% efficient
equivalent area which would produce the same event rate as the
detector. It is calculated from simulation. Throughout the life-
time of ANTARES the number of available detector lines has
changed. The acceptance for the whole lifetime Ā is calculated
as the sum over the acceptances for all detector configuration
periods.

The 90% C.L. sensitivities on the neutrino fluxes are then
calculated as

Φ̄νµ+ν̄µ,90% =

where µ̄90% is the 90% C.L. sensitivity obtained from the like-
lihood function.

4. Results and discussion

In Figure 1 it can be seen that there is no excess of events
large enough to be identified as signal by the likelihood func-

3



tion. The median of the PSF used in the likelihood function is
for most masses below 2 degrees. The observed TS is used to
extract 90% C.L. upper limits from the absence of signal. How-
ever, since the observed value of the TS turns out to be smaller
than the median of the TS distribution of pure background for
all masses and channels, the sensitivity has been considered as
the limit.

In Figure 2 the limits on the neutrino flux from the Sun as a

Λ Fit results are combined. Λ Fit gives the best flux limits in the
W+W− decay channel at all WIMP masses, for MWIMP > 100
GeV in the τ+τ− channel and for MWIMP > 250 GeV in the bb̄
decay channel.

Figure 2: Limits on a neutrino flux coming from the Sun as a function of the
WIMP masses for the different channels considered.

The limit on the total number of neutrinos from WIMP anni-
hilations in the sun per unit of time Cn is calculated by

Cn = 4πd
2
Sun,rmsΦνµ+ν̄µ,90%, (7)

where Φνµ+ν̄µ,90% is the limit on the neutrino flux and d
2
Sun,rms is

the mean squared distance from the detector to the Sun. From
this, the annihilation rate is calculated by dividing Cn by the
average number of neutrinos per annihilation, as obtained by
WIMPSim. The sensitivities on the spin–dependent and spin–
independent scattering cross–sections are calculated from this
annihilation rate assuming an equilibrium between annihilation
and capture via scattering [18]. This means that the capture
rate is twice as high as the annihilation rate. For the calcula-
tion of the capture rate a Maxwellian velocity distribution of
the WIMPs with a root mean square velocity of 270 m · s−1

and a local dark matter density of 0.4 GeV · cm−3 is assumed
[19]. Therefore, once the average number of neutrinos per an-
nihilation is known, the annihilation rate and consequently the
capture rate and the scattering cross–sections can be calculated.

All results are shown in comparison to the results of other
experiments in Figures 3 and 4 and summarised for reference
in Table 1. Recently an update on the spin–dependent cross–
section limits from the IceCube collaboration has been released
[20]. These new limits show an improvement of up to a factor of
4 with respect to the previous limits by using the energy infor-
mation of the events in the likelihood function. In the analysis
presented here the inclusion of further event parameters (e.g.
Nhit, β and Q in Equations 2 and 3) leads to an improvement
of a factor of up to 1.7. At WIMP masses of up to a few 100
GeV, the consistent strengthening of the flux limit with increas-
ing WIMP mass (see Figure 2) determines the behaviour of the
cross–section limits. Above a WIMP mass of a few 100 GeV
the factor of M−2WIMP in the conversion from neutrino flux to the
scattering cross–sections dominates the behaviour of the cross–
section limits and causes a rise with the WIMP mass. As a
result, the cross-section limits show a minimum at a few 100
GeV.

The possible uncertainties on the background have been cir-
cumvented by using time–scrambled data for generating the
background function B in the likelihood function. The largest
systematic error is an uncertainty of 20% on the angular ac-
ceptance of the PMTs [28] and leads to a degradation of the
detector efficiency (i.e. the acceptance) of 6% [13]. This effect
has been taken into account for the limits presented here.

5. Conclusion

A new analysis searching for a signal of dark matter anni-
hilations in the Sun has been conducted using the ANTARES
data from 2007 to 2012. The unblinded data showed no signifi-
cant excess above the background estimate and 90% confidence
level exclusion limits have been calculated for the three annihi-
lation channels WIMP+WIMP→ bb̄,W+W−, τ+τ− and WIMP
masses ranging from 50 GeV to 5 TeV.
