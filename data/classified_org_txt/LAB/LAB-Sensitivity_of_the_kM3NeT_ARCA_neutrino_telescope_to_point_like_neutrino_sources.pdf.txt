Abstract

KM3NeT will be a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediter-
ranean Sea. The KM3NeT/ARCA detector, to be installed at the Capo
Passero site (Italy), is optimised for the detection of high-energy neutrinos
of cosmic origin. Thanks to its geographical location on the Northern hemi-
sphere, KM3NeT/ARCA can observe upgoing neutrinos from most of the
Galactic Plane, including the Galactic Centre. Given its effective area and
excellent pointing resolution, KM3NeT/ARCA will measure or significantly
constrain the neutrino flux from potential astrophysical neutrino sources. At
the same time, it will test flux predictions based on gamma-ray measure-
ments and the assumption that the gamma-ray flux is of hadronic origin.
Assuming this scenario, discovery potentials and sensitivities for a selected
list of Galactic sources and to generic point sources with an E−2 spectrum
are presented. These spectra are assumed to be time independent. The re-
sults indicate that an observation with 3σ significance is possible in about
six years of operation for the most intense sources, such as Supernovae Rem-
nants RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr. If no signal will be found during this
time, the fraction of the gamma-ray flux coming from hadronic processes can
be constrained to be below 50% for these two objects.

1. Introduction

Neutrinos are an optimal probe to observe high energy astrophysical phe-
nomena, since they interact only weakly with matter and are not deflected by
magnetic fields. Therefore, they point back to their origin, can bridge large
distances without absorption, and may provide information on processes in
dense sources, which can be opaque to the electromagnetic radiation. They
are unique messengers from the most violent and highest energy processes
in our Galaxy and far beyond. The discovery by the IceCube Collabora-
tion of a high-energy neutrino flux of extra-terrestrial origin [1, 2, 3] has
thus opened a new observational window on our Universe and initiated a
new era of neutrino astronomy. KM3NeT1 is a large research infrastruc-
ture that will consist of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the
Mediterranean Sea. KM3NeT will include two detectors with the same tech-
nology but different granularity, KM3NeT/ARCA and KM3NeT/ORCA (As-
troparticle and Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss, respectively)
[4]. While KM3NeT/ORCA, installed at the KM3NeT-France site offshore
Toulon (France), will study oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos with the pri-
mary objective to determine the neutrino mass ordering, KM3NeT/ARCA
will be dedicated to high-energy neutrino astronomy, including the investi-
gation of the cosmic neutrino flux discovered by IceCube. KM3NeT/ARCA
is being installed at the KM3NeT-Italy site offshore Capo Passero (Italy)
and will have cubic-kilometer scale size, suited to measure neutrinos in the
TeV–PeV energy range. KM3NeT/ARCA will have a wider and complemen-
tary field of view with respect to IceCube. One of its primary targets is the
detection of Galactic sources visible also at relatively low energy around tens
of TeV for which the IceCube sensitivity to muon neutrinos is low.

In KM3NeT, neutrinos are detected by measuring the Cherenkov light
induced by charged secondary particles emerging from a neutrino interaction
in the sea water, which serves as target material and Cherenkov radiator as
well as a shield for downgoing atmospheric muons. The light is detected by
photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs) arranged in glass spheres that withstand the
water pressure (digital optical modules, DOMs [5, 6]). Each optical module
houses 31 3-inch PMTs optimising the photo-cathode area, the directional
sensitivity, the angular coverage per DOM, and the photon counting capabil-
ity. The DOMs of the KM3NeT/ARCA detector are arranged along flexible

strings with a total height of about 700 m. KM3NeT/ARCA will consist of
two building blocks of 115 strings each, with 18 DOMs per string, vertically
spaced by 36 m. Each block will have a roughly circular footprint with an
average distance between strings of about 90 m. The two blocks together
will cover an instrumented volume of about 1 km3. They will be deployed
and anchored in the Capo Passero site located at 36◦ 16’ N 16◦ 06’ E, at
a depth of 3500 m, and will be connected to the shore station via a 100
km electro-optical cable to transfer power and data between shore and the
detector.

Different populations of Galactic astrophysical objects have been pro-
posed as production sites of neutrinos up to the TeV–PeV range. Supernova
Remnants (SNRs) are the best motivated candidates in our Galaxy [7]. They
are often addressed as the main contributors to the flux of Galactic Cosmic
Rays (the so-called SNR paradigm on the origin of GCR). Evidence for the
acceleration of protons in the remnants was provided in 2013 when Fermi-
LAT reported an indication of the pion-decay signature from the SNRs W 44
and IC 443 [8]. However, being model dependent, this measurement is not a
conclusive proof. Being a smoking gun for hadronic acceleration, neutrinos
could contribute to the challenge of unveiling cosmic-ray accelerators.

In the last decades, very high energy (VHE: Eγ > 100 GeV) emission from
a large number of Galactic SNRs has been identified by γ-ray telescopes.
The observed γ-ray spectra can extend up to tens of TeV, proving that these
objects are efficient particle accelerators. These particles could be protons
yielding γ-rays via inelastic production of neutral pions, but could also be
electrons which emit VHE γ-rays via Inverse Compton scattering on ambient
low energy photons. The observation of high-energy neutrinos from these
sources would establish an unambiguous proof that hadronic processes are at
work; due to strong model dependences, this proof cannot easily be achieved
with the current γ-rays observations.

Another class of Galactic objects observed in TeV γ-rays comprises Pulsar
Wind Nebulae (PWNe), in which emission of non-thermal radiation is pow-
ered by the relativistic outflows from a pulsar, i.e. a rapidly spinning, strongly
magnetised neutron star. The interaction of the pulsar wind with the slower
supernova ejecta or with the interstellar medium creates a termination shock
where particles can be accelerated to very high energies. Even though the
TeV emission of PWN is usually interpreted in a purely leptonic scenario
[9], some authors [10] also consider the presence of a hadronic contribution,
which could be tested with neutrino telescopes.

The scientific potential of KM3NeT/ARCA to detect neutrino point-like
sources in our Galaxy and beyond is discussed in this paper. This subject
has already been covered in Ref. [4]. However, since then, the event recon-
struction and analysis methods have been improved significantly, leading to
new results presented in this paper. Moreover, the recent publication of new
and more precise γ-ray observations [11, 12] has also allowed for updated
neutrino flux predictions. In addition, an extended set of potential neutrino
sources is now investigated, including several candidate sources for measur-
able neutrino signals. A stacking analysis of SNRs with the most intense
VHE γ-ray flux is also presented.

The recent detection by IceCube of a high-energy neutrino event coin-
cident in direction and time with a γ-ray flaring state of the blazar TXS
0506+056 is reported in Ref. [13]. This observation suggests that blazars
[14] are likely sources of extra-galactic high-energy neutrinos. In addition,
an investigation over the full IceCube neutrino archive has shown an ex-
cess with more than 3σ significance of high-energy neutrino events at the
position of this blazar compatible with a neutrino flux with E−2 energy de-
pendence [15]. ANTARES has also searched for neutrinos from this source
[16] but no evidence has been found. To illustrate the detection capabili-
ties of KM3NeT/ARCA for this type of extragalactic sources, the sensitivity
of KM3NeT/ARCA to a E−2 neutrino flux from a point-like source is also
discussed.

The analysis focusses on charged-current interactions of muon-neutrinos,
producing a high-energy muon in the final state. Due to its path length of
up to several kilometres in water, the direction of the muon and thus – at
sufficiently high neutrino energy – the neutrino direction can be measured
with good accuracy (see Section 4). Such track-like events therefore provide
the dominant contribution to the sensitivity for point-like sources [4]. The
main backgrounds are due to atmospheric neutrinos and muons produced by
the interaction of cosmic rays with nuclei in the atmosphere. To eliminate
atmospheric muons, only events reconstructed as upgoing or coming from
slightly above the horizon are selected since the Earth or the slant water layer
traversed absorbs all particles except neutrinos. The cosmic neutrino signal
is observed as an excess on the background of atmospheric neutrinos and of
remaining atmospheric muons falsely reconstructed as upgoing. Given the
latitude of the detector, KM3NeT will detect upgoing neutrinos from about
3.5π sr of the sky, including most of the Galactic Plane. The visibility of a
given candidate source (i.e. the fraction of time it is observable) depends on

7



its declination, δ, and on the angular acceptance above the horizon, see Fig. 1.
In particular, note that the region of full visibility extends to δ . −45◦ if
events up to 10◦ above the horizon are included, as in the present analysis
(see Section 5).

In this paper, neutrino fluxes expected from a selected list of Galactic
γ-ray sources are estimated assuming a hadronic scenario for the γ-ray pro-
duction and transparent sources. This topic is discussed in Section 2. The
details of the simulation codes are described in Section 3 and the reconstruc-
tion performances in Section 4. The analysis procedure and the results are
presented in Section 5. Section 6 is devoted to the KM3NeT/ARCA sensi-
tivity and discovery potential for a generic E−2 flux. The effect of systematic
uncertainties is discussed in Section 7, and the conclusions are summarised
in Section 8.

2. Selected Galactic sources and estimated neutrino fluxes

Galactic candidate sources have been selected from the TeVCat catalogue
[17] on the basis of their visibility, the γ-ray intensity and the energy spec-
trum. In particular, it was required that the γ-ray flux is measured up to
a few tens of TeV. The selected sources are: RX J1713.7-3946, Vela X, Vela
Jr, HESS J1614-518, the Galactic Centre and MGRO J1908+06 (see Table 1
for the individual references). The visibility of these sources is indicated in
Fig. 1. Except for MGRO J1908+06, all the sources have a visibility above
70%.

For all the sources (with the only exception of MGRO J1908+06), the
neutrino flux is derived from the measured γ-ray flux using the method de-
scribed in Refs. [18, 19] and references therein. Another method has been
tested [20], using as a test case the source RX J1713.7-3946, obtaining com-
patible results. All neutrino fluxes are estimated for the νµ

2 channel, assum-
ing that, due to oscillation, for cosmic neutrinos the flavour ratio at Earth
will be νe : νµ : ντ = 1 : 1 : 1 [21]. For all cases a 100% hadronic emission
and a transparent source are assumed, but the results can also be interpreted
in terms of the percentage of hadronic emission, provided that the hadronic
and non-hadronic contributions have the same energy spectrum. If ξhad is
the percentage of the γ-ray flux that has hadronic origin, the neutrino fluxes

observed by H.E.S.S. in several campaigns, in the years 2003-2005 [26, 27, 22]
and in 2011 and 2012 [11]. The reported spectrum extends up to about
100 TeV, suggesting that the hadronic particle population may have energies
up to several PeV if the γ-ray production is hadronic.

The origin of the TeV γ-ray emission from RX J1713.7-3946 has been a
matter of active debate. A detailed discussion of the interpretation of the
H.E.S.S. data in hadronic or leptonic scenarios can be found e.g. in Refs.
[11, 27] and references therein. Fermi-LAT reported an observation of GeV
γ-ray emission from RX J1713.7-3946 [28]. While the hard spectrum at GeV
energies reported by the Fermi Collaboration is generally interpreted as an
argument in favour of a leptonic scenario, some authors argue that both
hadronic and leptonic scenarios can reproduce the data under certain as-
sumptions (e.g. Ref. [29]). On the other hand, the observation of molecular
clouds in the vicinity of the source [30, 31] could provide an additional hint in
favour of the hadronic scenario. In Ref. [32], a detailed numerical treatment of
the SNR shock interaction in a non homogenous medium has been reported,
consistently describing the broadband GeV–TeV spectrum of RX J1713.7-
3946 in terms of a hadronic model. In Ref. [11], the X-ray, the Fermi-LAT
and the updated H.E.S.S. data are combined to derive in both scenarios the
particle spectra from the SNR spectral energy distribution. The data can be
fit both with hadronic and leptonic models so neither of the two scenarios
can currently be excluded.

Previous KM3NeT results [4] were derived from H.E.S.S. data in Ref. [22].
These are superseded by a most recent H.E.S.S. publication [11] which shows
a softer spectrum at the highest energies compared to the previous paper.
This new spectrum is based on a new analysis which makes use of more data,
refined calibration and data analysis methods. The results presented in this
publication are based on the data reported in Ref. [11]. In Table 1 only the
flux derived with the method in Refs. [33, 18, 34] is reported.

2.2. Vela X

Vela X is one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae and is associated with the
energetic Vela pulsar PSR B0833-45. Even if PWNe are generally considered
as leptonic sources, interpretation of TeV γ-ray emission from Vela X in terms
of hadronic interactions has been discussed [10, 35].

11



The VHE γ-ray emission from Vela X was first reported by the H.E.S.S.
Collaboration [36] and was found to be coincident with a region of X-ray
emission discovered with ROSAT as a filamentary structure extending south-
west from the pulsar to the centre of Vela X. The first result of H.E.S.S. has
been updated [23] with data from the 2005–2007 and 2008–2009 observation
campaigns and using an improved method for the background subtraction.
The new data are characterised by a 25% higher integral flux above 1 TeV and
a harder energy spectrum and are used here to derive the neutrino spectrum.

2.3. Vela Jr

RX J0852.0-4622, commonly referred as Vela Junior (Vela Jr in Table 1
and Fig. 2) is a young shell-type SNR with properties similar to RX J1713.7-
3946. Vela Junior emits γ-rays up to energies of few tens of TeV [12]. Also
for this source the γ-ray emission has been interpreted both in the hadronic
and leptonic scenarios (see Ref. [12] for an overview on the arguments). In
particular, a recent analysis [37] reports a good spatial correspondence be-
tween the TeV γ-rays and interstellar hydrogen clouds, suggesting a hadronic
interpretation of the origin of the observed γ-rays from this source.

2.4. HESS J1614-518

The γ-ray high energy emission of the source HESS J1614-518 has been
observed by H.E.S.S. up to about 10 TeV [24] and was studied in terms
of morphological, spectral and multi-wavelength properties and classified as
candidate shell-type SNR. The γ-ray flux from the source HESS J1614-518
has been fitted in Ref. [24] as a pure power law and the neutrino flux derived
from it is indicated in the following as HESS J1614-518 (1). To test the effect
of a possible cutoff in the spectrum, in this study the H.E.S.S. γ-ray data
were fitted also with a power law with exponential cutoff. The neutrino flux
derived from this γ-ray flux is referred as HESS J1614-518 (2).

2.5. Galactic Centre

Recently, the H.E.S.S. Collaboration has reported γ-ray observations of
the region surrounding the Galactic Centre [25]. The γ-ray flux reported is
derived for two regions: a point source with radius 0.1◦ (PS) HESS J1745-
290 centred on Sgr A* and a diffuse emission (DF) from an annulus between
0.15◦ and 0.45◦. The strong correlation between the brightness distribution
of diffuse VHE γ-ray emission in the wider vicinity of the Galactic Centre
and the locations of molecular clouds points towards a hadronic origin of

12



the γ-ray emission [25]. Since the DF γ-ray data are consistent with a hard
power-law, the spectrum of the parent protons should extend to PeV energies.
The neutrino spectra expected from the two regions PS and DF have been
evaluated in Ref. [19], where a few possible neutrino spectra are proposed
starting from plausible γ-ray fluxes and exploring different energy cutoffs.
The flux considered here is the sum of the PS and DF regions, choosing as
flux for the PS area the one derived from the γ-ray flux with Ecut,γ = 10.7
TeV and for the DF region the one from Ecut,γ = 0.6 PeV. For simplicity, the
source shape is approximated as a homogeneous disk of radius 0.45◦.

2.6. MGROJ1908+06

The source MGRO J1908+06 has been detected both by air Cherenkov
telescopes (H.E.S.S. [38] and VERITAS [39]) and extensive air-shower detec-
tors (Milagro [40, 41, 42], ARGO-YJB [43] and HAWC [44]). The nature of
this source is currently unclear. It could be a PWN associated with the pul-
sar PSR J1907+0602 [45]. Its large size and the lack of softening of the TeV
spectrum with distance from the pulsar, however, are uncommon for TeV
PWNe of similar age, suggesting that it could also be a SNR [39, 46]. Using
the measured γ-ray spectra, the prospects for detecting neutrinos from this
source with IceCube are discussed in Ref. [46]. Three possible assumptions
on the γ-ray flux are considered, with a spectral index Γγ = 2 and cutoff
energies Ecut,γ = 30, 300, 800 TeV. The corresponding neutrino fluxes derived
in Ref. [46], listed in Table 1 as (1), (2) and (3), respectively, are used in
this analysis. The source position and extension are taken from the H.E.S.S.
results [38].

3. Simulations

For this analysis the Monte Carlo (MC) chain discussed in Ref. [4] is
used. Neutrinos and anti-neutrinos of all flavours are considered, and both
charged and neutral current reactions are simulated. For the generation
equal fluxes of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are assumed. Since neutrino and
anti-neutrino interactions cannot be distinguished in KM3NeT on an event-
by-event basis, the lepton symbols (ν, µ, e, and τ) denote both particles and
anti-particles in the following. Neutrinos are generated over the full solid
angle to simulate the background of atmospheric neutrinos. Neutrinos from
the specific sources described in Section 2 are simulated as originating from
homogeneous disks centred at the declination shown in Table 1 and with a

13



radius given in the same table. Events are generated in the energy range
between 102 and 108 GeV according to an E−1.4 spectrum and subsequently
reweighted to different flux models. The neutrino interactions are simulated
using LEPTO [47] with the parton distribution functions CTEQ6 [48] (for
deep inelastic scattering). The muon produced at the interaction vertex is
propagated through rock and water with MUSIC [49].

The Cherenkov photons induced by charged particles traversing the water
are propagated to the DOMs. To save CPU time, this is done using tabu-
lated photon propagation probabilities based on full GEANT3.21 [50] sim-
ulations and taking into account the DOM properties (effective area, quan-
tum efficiency and collection efficiency of the photomultipliers; transmission
probability through glass and gel), the DOM orientation with respect to the
incident direction of the photon and the optical water properties measured
at the KM3NeT-Italy site [51]. For each event, the PMTs measuring a signal
are determined, each signal (“hit”) being characterised by the photon arrival
time and the signal amplitude (deposited charge). The hit data are con-
verted to digitised arrival time and time-over-threshold (ToT), i.e. the time
the analog signal exceeds a predefined threshold.

Optical background due to the presence of 40K in salt water is simulated
by adding an uncorrelated hit rate of 5 kHz per PMT. Moreover, the proba-
bility of two-, three- and four-fold hit coincidences on a DOM from a single
40K decay have been estimated by GEANT simulations and are included with
rates of 500, 50 and 5 Hz per DOM, respectively. Both the single and coin-
cidence rates are in agreement with the results from the prototype detection
unit of the KM3NeT detector deployed at Capo Passero [52]. The effect of
bioluminescence light is negligible at the KM3NeT-Italy site [53].

At the end of the simulation chain, trigger algorithms are applied in
order to select potentially interesting events that will be reconstructed and
analysed with the statistical methods described below. The trigger is based
on the L1 hits, i.e. hits on more than one PMT of the same DOM in a time
window of 10 ns. Events pass the trigger condition if there are at least 5
causally connected L1 hits. Details on the trigger and trigger efficiency are
given in Ref. [4].

3.1. Atmospheric neutrinos and muons

Only a very small fraction of the high energy neutrino flux arriving at
the detector is of astrophysical origin. The dominant contribution is due
to atmospheric neutrinos from extended air showers caused by cosmic ray

14



interactions with nuclei in the atmosphere. However, at sufficiently large
energies, the astrophysical flux will dominate that of atmospheric origin. The
atmospheric neutrino flux has two components: the conventional one due to
the decay of charged pions and kaons and the prompt one due to the decay
of charmed hadrons, produced in the primary interaction. The atmospheric
neutrino flux is simulated assuming the conventional atmospheric model as
in Ref. [54] and the prompt component as described in Ref. [55]. Corrections
due to the break in the cosmic ray spectrum (knee) are applied as described
in Ref. [56]. Also other models of prompt neutrino fluxes [57, 58, 59] have
been tested, but they leave the final results essentially unaltered.

In addition to atmospheric neutrinos, cosmic ray interactions in the at-
mosphere also produce atmospheric muons. Each initial interaction creates a
number of muons that are collimated and coincident in time (muon bundle).
Atmospheric muons are simulated using the MUPAGE event generator [60].
In the analysis presented here two simulated muon event samples are used,
one with muon bundle energies Eb > 10 TeV, corresponding to a livetime of
about 3 months, the other with Eb > 50 TeV, equivalent to about 3 years of
livetime.

4. Event reconstruction performances

The neutrino induced events are observed in two topologies, track-like
and cascade-like events, each class requiring specific event reconstruction
algorithms.

Track-like events are due to charged-current νµ interactions that, for
Eν & 1 TeV, produce in the final state muons with track lengths of the
order of kilometres and trajectories almost colinear with the parent neutrino
direction. Also ντ charged-current interactions can produce a high-energy
muon in the final state through a muonic decay of the final-state τ with a
branching ratio of about 17%. The reconstruction algorithm used for track-
like events is described in Ref. [61]. The muon direction is reconstructed
from the sequence of Cherenkov photon hits on the PMTs, taking advantage
of the fact that photons are emitted along the particle track at an angle of
about 42◦. The reconstruction algorithm starts by a prefit scanning the full
solid angle. Then, starting from the twelve best fitted directions in the prefit,
a maximum likelihood search is performed. The likelihood is derived from
a probability density function depending on the position and orientation of
the PMTs with respect to the muon trajectory and on the hit times. Among

15



these intermediate tracks, the one with the best likelihood is chosen. A re-
construction quality parameter is defined as Λ = − logL − 0.1Ncomp, where
logL is the log-likelihood of the fit and Ncomp is the number of intermediate
tracks during the reconstruction within 1◦ from the chosen one.

The angular resolution, calculated as the median angle between the re-
constructed track and the neutrino direction, is smaller than 0.2◦ at Eν >
10 TeV. The energy is reconstructed from the spatial distribution of hit and
non-hit PMTs. The resolution is better than 0.3 units in log10(Ereco/Eµ),
where Ereco is the reconstructed and Eµ the true muon energy at the detec-
tor level.

All neutral-current reactions, as well as charged-current reactions of νe
and most ντ , produce cascade-like event topologies. Particle cascades evolve
from the hadronic final state and the final-state charged lepton (e) or its
decay products (τ , except in muonic decays). These cascades are typically
several metres long and therefore small compared to inter-DOM distances.
The reconstruction for such cascade-like events has an angular resolution
worse than the track-like case and is described in [61].

Track-like events are of particular relevance for the search for point-like,
i.e. very localised sources of neutrino emission, since they allow for fully ex-
ploiting the large effective area and the good angular resolution of KM3NeT/-
ARCA. The analysis discussed in this paper therefore focusses on track-
like events, and consequently the event reconstruction specific for track-like
events is applied to all events, including cascade events. Only events with
sufficient reconstruction quality are retained.

5. Galactic sources: Search method and results

Since the neutrino signal from any point source must be identified on
top of a large background of atmospheric muons and neutrinos, statistical
techniques are required to quantify a possible excess of events around the
source position. The two quantities used to describe the detector performance
are the discovery potential and the sensitivity. The discovery potential refers
to the flux that could produce a significant (e.g. 3σ or 5σ) observation with
probability 50%. The sensitivity refers to the flux that can be excluded at a
given confidence level (90% in this paper), if no significant signal is observed
(see Section 5.3).

The search for Galactic point-like neutrino sources is performed in the
following steps:

16



• Selection cuts are applied to reduce the background events (Section 5.1).

• A multivariate analysis employing a Random Decision Forest algorithm
[62] is performed on the remaining events to distinguish signal from
background events (Section 5.2).

• An unbinned likelihood method is used to determine the discovery po-
tential and the sensitivity (Section 5.3).

5.1. Selection cuts

For signal events, only charged-current interactions of νµ and of ντ (with
subsequent τ → µνν decay) are considered since the remaining event classes
(other decays of ντ producing cascades, charged-current νe and all neutral-
current interactions) are almost completely rejected by applying track re-
construction quality criteria. For atmospheric neutrinos, both charged- and
neutral-current νµ and νe events are taken into account.

The loose selection cuts applied are:

1. A zenith cut at about 10◦ above the horizon to reduce the background
of atmospheric muons (see Section 1), slightly optimised for each can-
didate source taking into account its maximum elevation (see Table 2).

2. A cut on the angle α between the reconstructed track direction and
the nominal source position. A cut α < 10◦ has been selected as a
compromise to reduce the background without reducing significantly
the efficiency for selecting signal events.

The numbers of signal events after these selection cuts, expected from the
different sources for the flux assumptions from Table 1, are reported in Ta-
ble 2.

5.2. Random Decision Forest training

A multivariate analysis employing the Random Decision Forest algorithm
is performed to distinguish three classes of events: neutrinos coming from the
source, atmospheric neutrinos, and atmospheric muons. More specifically we
use the extremely randomised trees classifier from Ref. [63].

The features used in the training to characterise the events are: the angle
α between the reconstructed track direction and the nominal source posi-
tion; the reconstructed zenith angle θ; the reconstructed muon energy at the
detector level; the numbers of hits used at different stages of the reconstruc-
tion; the error estimate on this fit β; and the track reconstruction quality

reconstruction; after zenith cut; and after the α cut (see text). The sum of νµ and ντ
events is shown, where the ντ contribution is between 8% and 10%.

parameter, Λ, defined in Section 4. The distributions of the most important
of these features are shown in Fig. 3 for the three event classes. Note that α
is the convolution of the source extension and the angular resolution.

In a first step the algorithm is trained on a sample of events to optimise its
performance in distinguishing the different event classes. The trained classi-
fier has then been applied to a separate event sample to test its performance.
For each event the classifier returns the probability to belong to each one of
the three classes. The distributions of the probability to belong to the signal
class (Fig. 4) are used for all events as probability density functions in the
subsequent analysis step.

An example of the distribution of the simulated neutrino energy at the dif-
ferent stages of the analysis is shown in Fig. 5 for the source SNR RX J1713.7-
3946 (see Table 1). The energy distribution for all the reconstructed events,
those passing the selection cuts (see Table 2) and those passing the cuts of
the “cut-and-count” analysis (see [64] for a description of this method) is
shown. In latter case, the output of the Random Decision Forest classifier is
used a as variable to cut on. This is shown here to illustrate the energy of
interest of these kind of analyses, typically peaking around 10 TeV. However,
the cut-and-count method is not used for the results described in the next
sections.

5.3. Unbinned method

In order to test the compatibility of the data with two different hypotheses
H0 and H1, a test statistic is defined. The test statistic can in principle be
any function of the data but is optimally selected such that its distributions
under the two competing hypotheses are maximally separated. In the search
for neutrino point sources the hypothesis H0 = Hb refers to the case in which
the data set consists of background events only. Hypothesis H1 = Hs+b refers
to the case where events from a cosmic source are present in addition to the
background. To calculate the test statistic, a likelihood ratio [65] has been
defined as the ratio of the probabilities to obtain the data assuming the

where n is the total number of recorded events in a given period of time
and ns is the expected number of signal events in the sample of n events;
ns is a free parameter constrained to be non-negative. Note that the source
position is assumed to be known and is not determined from the data. For
each sample, LR is maximised. The maximum value of LR is used as the test
statistic and will be denoted with the symbol λ. The variable x in Eq. (3)
is the probability that the event belongs to the “signal” class as calculated
by the Random Decision Forest classifier. As an example the PDFs for the
source RX J1713.7-3946 are shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 5: Distribution of the generated neutrino energy for the source RX J1713.7-3946 at
reconstruction level (red line), after the selection cuts θ > 78◦ and α < 10◦ (blue line) and
after the cuts of the cut-and-count analysis (green line), that corresponds to an additional
cut on the Random Decision Forest output greater than 0.92.

The output of the algorithm is the λ value and the corresponding fitted
ns value. The distribution of 2λ for the background-only case is expected
to follow a half-χ2-distribution as defined in Ref. [66] and can be used to
estimate the pre-trial p-value.

In order to estimate the distribution of the test statistic for the background-
only assumption, the algorithm is applied to several thousand samples of
background events sampled from the simulated atmospheric neutrino and
muon events. For each sample, the maximum value of LR, λ, is recorded.
The normalised distribution of λ, g(λ|b) is then determined. Selecting the
required significance and the corresponding two-sided Gaussian probability,
e.g. 3σ and 2.7× 10−3, a critical value λ3σ is calculated from∫ ∞

λ3σ

g(λ|b)dλ = 2.7× 10−3 . (4)

Subsequently, the procedure is repeated adding the poissonian expecta-
tion, Ns, of one simulated signal event to the background sample, then the
poissonian expectation for two signal events, and so on. For each Ns, λ
is again calculated and its normalised distribution will be indicated with

21



g(λ|Ns + b). The “power” P (Ns) is calculated as:∫ ∞
λ3σ

g(λ|Ns + b)dλ = P (Ns). (5)

Let n3σ be the value of Ns for which P (Ns) = 0.5. Then n3σ is the number
of expected signal events that would lead to a detection with a significance
of at least 3σ in 50% of the cases.

If the analysis has been performed with a model for the source that pre-
dicts a flux Φs and a mean number of signal events 〈ns〉, the discovery po-
tential will be given by

Φ3σ = Φs ·
n3σ
〈ns〉

. (6)

The sensitivity is calculated as the 90% confidence level median upper
limit by using the Neyman method [65]. The procedure is similar to that
described previously but in this case a reference value λ90 is calculated as the
median of the g(λ|b) distribution. The power is evaluated as in Eq. (5) but
with λ90 instead of λ3σ. The number of events needed to reach the required
sensitivity, n90, is the number of events such that P (Ns) = 0.9.

As in Eq. (6), the sensitivity flux Φ90 is calculated as:

Φ90 = Φs ·
n90
〈ns〉

. (7)

5.4. Results

The results are shown in Figs. 6, 7. Figure 6 refers to the source MGRO
J1908+06 with the three neutrino flux assumptions listed in Table 1, while
the results for the other sources are shown in Fig. 7. The fluxes corresponding
to the discovery potential at 3σ, Φ3σ, are shown in the left plots of Figs. 6 and
7 and the sensitivity at 90% confidence level, Φ90, is shown the right plots. In
Figs. 6, 7 both Φ3σ and Φ90 are reported as a ratio over the flux expectation Φν
of each source, given by Eq. (1) and shown in Table 1. Therefore Φ3σ/Φν = 1
indicates the time needed for a 3 sigma detection of the source for ξhad = 1.
If Φ3σ/Φν < 1, Φ3σ/Φν = y gives the time needed to observe the source at
3σ for the case ξhad = y. The same notation applies to the sensitivity.

Note that, by definition, Φ3σ and Φν have the same spectral shape (see
Eq. (6) so the ratio between the two fluxes corresponds to the ratio between
their normalisation constants and does not depend on the energy.

22



The sensitivity to exclude the predicted fluxes at 90% confidence level is
reached for all the sources after about 5 (7) years for ξhad = 1 (ξhad = 0.8). For
MGRO J1908+06, a 3σ discovery is possible after about 5.5 years (7.5 years)
if the cutoff in the γ-ray spectrum is Ecut,γ = 800 TeV (300 TeV) and if
ξhad = 1. In the case of a cutoff at much lower energies, however, longer
observation time would be necessary, e.g. 27 years for a cutoff at 30 TeV. For
RX J1713.7-3946, 5 years of observation time are sufficient to constrain the
hadronic fraction to ξhad < 0.5. Even though hadronic scenarios for Vela X
are disfavoured, it is worth noting that KM3NeT/ARCA could constrain the
hadronic contribution to ξhad < 0.6 (ξhad < 0.2) in about 1 year (5.5 years).

Figure 6: Ratio of the discovery potential Φ3σ (left) and sensitivity Φ90 (right) to the
expectation flux Φν as a function of the observation time for the three fluxes assumed for
the source MGRO J1908+06 (see Table 1). The fluxes (1), (2) and (3) correspond to a
γ-ray spectral index Γγ = 2 and cutoff energies of Ecut,γ = 30, 300, 800 TeV, respectively.

It should be noted that the results for a given neutrino flux degrade
with increasing extension of the source. This effect depends mainly on the
source radius, but also on the source spectrum. Studies concerning this
effect have been reported by the ANTARES Collaboration [67, 68] and other
authors [69]. To quantify the impact of the source extension, the discovery
potential and the sensitivity have been determined for two sources, assuming
that they are point-like instead of having finite extension. For RX J1713.7-
3946, with a radius of 0.6◦, Φ3σ is reduced by about 25% and Φ90 by about
20%. For MGRO J1908+06 (0.34◦ radius and a harder spectrum), the relative
reduction is about half as large. Systematic effects from the uncertainties of
the source extensions or possible inhomogeneities of the neutrino emission
from the source region are expected to be negligible.

Figure 7: Ratio of the discovery potential Φ3σ (left) and sensitivity Φ90 (right) to the
expectation flux Φν as a function of the observation time for the first seven source fluxes
listed in Table 1.

A stacking analysis has been performed for the two most intense SNRs,
RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr. The analysis is similar to the one described
above for single sources, with the PDFs in Eq. (3) obtained as weighted sums
of the PDFs of the single sources, both for the signal and the background,
using as weight the number of events expected in each case. Since these
sources are quite distant in the sky (about 80◦), there is no overlap between
the selected events around the two sources. It is therefore possible to use the
original classifier designed for each source as PDF for the stacked search.

In Fig. 8, the resulting values of Φ3σ/Φν and Φ5σ/Φν are shown as a
function of the observation time. Note that in this case Φν indicates the sum
of the fluxes of the two stacked sources. An observation at 3σ is possible
after 3 years and at 5σ after 9 years.

6. Generic point sources with E−2 spectrum

The sensitivity to astrophysical neutrino sources lacking a specific neu-
trino flux prediction based on γ-ray measurements is performed assuming a
generic, unbroken power law energy spectrum proportional to E−2. This as-
sumption is in agreement with the recent IceCube findings [15] and provides
a benchmark scenario that can be compared with other detectors (see e.g.
the corresponding results from ANTARES [67] and IceCube [70]).

In this case no specific source generation is performed. Instead of a spe-
cific training for each possible source location in the sky, only one training
is performed assuming as “signal” an event sample generated with a E−2

Figure 8: Ratio of the discovery potentials Φ3σ and Φ5σ to the expectation flux Φν as a
function of the observation time for the stacking analysis including RX J1713.7-3946 and
Vela Jr. The neutrino fluxes assumed for the individual sources are listed in Table 1. In
this case, Φν is taken as the sum of the fluxes of the two sources.

spectrum and imposing the experimental point spread function. Only tracks
reconstructed below the horizon and up to 10◦ above the horizon are consid-
ered. The features used for the training are the same as for Galactic sources,
except that in this case the distance from the source position is not used
at this stage of the analysis. The output of the Random Decision Forest
classifier is used as a cut variable in the analysis.

The likelihood ratio in Eq. (3) is built in this case from the PDFs that
describe the reconstructed directions and energies of the events, following a
procedure widely used by the ANTARES Collaboration (see e.g. [67]). More
precisely,

f(xi|s) = f(ψi|s) f(Ei,rec|s) (8)

where f(ψi|s) is a parameterisation of the point spread function, i.e. the prob-
ability density function of reconstructing event i at an angular distance ψi
from the true source location, and f(Ei,rec|s) is the probability density func-
tion for signal events to be reconstructed with an energy Erec. For the back-
ground, the spatial part of the PDF depends only on the event declination
δi while the probability in right ascension is uniformly distributed, so

f(xi|b) = f(δi|b)/(2π) f(Ei,rec|b) (9)

Here, f(δi|b)/(2π) is the probability density for background events as a
function of the declination and f(Ei,rec|b) is the probability density function
for background events to be reconstructed with an energy Erec.

The resulting sensitivity and 5σ discovery flux are shown in Fig. 9 as a
function of the source declination. An observation time of 6 years has been
used, which is similar to IceCube results reported in Ref. [70].

Previously [4], the 5σ discovery flux was reported for an observation time
of three years. The present analysis leads to a 25% improvement with respect
to Ref. [4] in the 5σ discovery flux.

Figure 9: Sensitivity, defined as the median upper limit at 90% confidence level (left), and
discovery flux at 5σ (right) for sources with a generic, unbroken neutrino flux proportional
to E−2, as a function of the source declination. An observation time of 6 years is assumed.
For comparison, the corresponding IceCube [70] and ANTARES [67] results are also shown.
Note that the IceCube discovery potential [70] follows the one-sided gaussian probability
convention, while in this paper the two-sided one is used. For the KM3NeT results the
difference deriving from using one or the other convention has been evaluated to be less
than 4%, within the line thickness of the figure.

7. Systematic uncertainties

A detailed investigation of the systematic effects for point source searches
has been reported in Ref. [4]. The main contribution comes from the un-
certainty on the normalisation of the conventional part of the atmospheric
neutrino flux, which is around ±25% [54]. The corresponding variations of
the discovery fluxes reported here are in the range of about +15% to −5%.

The uncertainties on the scattering and absorption lengths of Cherenkov
light in the deep-sea water and on the geometrical acceptance of the optical
modules, which represents the major uncertainty in the response of a DOM
to incident photons, have negligible effects. Also, the deterioration of the
event reconstruction due to uncertainties on the position calibration is found
to be small.

8. Conclusions

The search for Galactic point-like neutrino sources is one of the prime
goals of the future KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino telescope. For a selected sample
of Galactic sources the detection perspectives of KM3NeT/ARCA have been
investigated, using several parameterisations of the expected neutrino fluxes
derived from the measured γ-ray fluxes. A new event reconstruction method
[61] and an improved multivariate analysis allowing for the distinction of
three event classes have been applied, improving upon the results of Ref. [4].

Most of the Galactic sources considered can be observed by KM3NeT
within a few years if their γ-ray emission is of purely hadronic origin. As
an example, Vela Jr can be observed with a 3σ significance within 6 years,
and RX J1713.7-3946 within 5.5 years. If no signal is observed after about 5
years, the hadronic contribution to the γ-ray emission can be constrained to
be less than 50% for both sources.

The search for extragalactic neutrino sources is strongly motivated by the
recent observation of a high-energy neutrino event coincident in direction and
time with a γ-ray flaring state of a blazar [13]. In this respect, the perfor-
mance of the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope have been investigated for a generic
E−2 neutrino flux. The sensitivity and 5σ discovery potential for sources
with an unbroken E−2 spectrum for an observation time of 6 years are in the
ranges E2Φ = 0.2÷0.4×10−9 GeV s−1 cm−2 and 0.5÷1×10−9 GeV s−1 cm−2,
respectively, for the full declination range −1 ≤ sin(δ) . 0.8. These values
are similar to the results, based on a similar exposure, reported by IceCube
for the Northern hemisphere and by more than one order of magnitude better
for the Southern hemisphere.
