visualize noise-induced hearing loss 
in mass stranded cetaceans

Assessment of the impact of noise over-exposure in stranded cetaceans is challenging, as the lesions 
that lead to hearing loss occur at the cellular level and inner ear cells are very sensitive to autolysis. 
Distinguishing ante-mortem pathology from post-mortem change has been a major constraint in 
diagnosing potential impact. Here, we outline a methodology applicable to the detection of noise-
induced hearing loss in stranded cetaceans. Inner ears from two mass strandings of long-finned pilot 
whales in Scotland were processed for scanning electron microscopy observation. In one case, a juvenile 
animal, whose ears were fixed within 4 hours of death, revealed that many sensory cells at the apex of 
the cochlear spiral were missing. In this case, the absence of outer hair cells would be compatible with 
overexposure to underwater noise, affecting the region which transduces the lowest frequencies of 
the pilot whales hearing spectrum. Perfusion of cochlea with fixative greatly improved preservation 
and enabled diagnostic imaging of the organ of Corti, even 30 hours after death. This finding supports 
adopting a routine protocol to detect the pathological legacy of noise overexposure in mass stranded 
cetaceans as a key to understanding the complex processes and implications that lie behind such 
stranding events.

There is an urgent need to develop methods for assessing the effects of underwater man-made noise on cetaceans. 
High intensity active sonar, and other loud noise sources, for example those from gas exploration, seismic surveys, 
etc., have the potential to cause lesions to exposed animals. Depending on the distance from the source, injuries 
can be lethal. As hearing is fundamental to cetaceans, changes to their hearing system may have a large impact on 
their ability to carry out vital activities. Deriving a forensic protocol to be able to detect if stranded cetaceans have 
suffered from noise-induced hearing loss is however key to understanding the physiological impact of anthropo-
genic noise on these species.

Previous studies on terrestrial mammals using electron microscopy demonstrated structural alterations of 
the organ of Corti as a response to mechanical and metabolic fatigue of the sensory cells, in turn a result of high 
intensity and long duration sound exposure1. Studies on humans showed that similar pathological alterations can 
be caused by exposure to ototoxic drugs, genetic factors, bacterial and viral infections or age2. These alterations 
include changes in the sensory cell stereocilia and degeneration and loss of the entire hair cell, amongst others3–5. 
When a mammalian cochlear hair cell dies, the neighbouring supporting cells actively participate in the process 
of hair cell elimination and scar formation. This process, termed “scarring” throughout this paper, comprises the 
simultaneous expansion and sealing of the reticular lamina1,6 as a rapid protective response to hair cell apoptosis, 
and is not to be confused with the more general use of “scar” as a slow healing mechanism involving collagen 
formation after injury. The presence of scarring among hair cell rows is therefore an important criterion that can 
be used to assess any possible history of noise-induced hearing loss and these lesions can be differentiated from 
artefacts that may develop as a consequence of tissue autolysis7.

The stereocilia of outer hair cells (OHCs) are in close contact with the tectorial membrane, which is depressed 
by the tips of the hairs. These depressions in the tectorial membrane are termed imprints. Experimental acoustic

overstimulation in guinea pigs resulted in morphological changes in OHC stereocilia imprints on the under-
surface of the tectorial membrane8. These changes were coincident with a transformation from circular to oval 
or irregular shape, fusion of adjacent concavities to form a larger concavity and, occasionally, the appearance of 
filamentous material. Such modifications of stereocilia imprints were found to remain for a minimum of one year 
in guinea pigs, long after sensory hairs had disappeared.

Quantifying the pathological changes in stranded marine mammals is very challenging due to the sensitivity 
of the organ of Corti epithelium to autolysis and the numerous potential causes that can lead to similar alterations.

Hearing loss in cetaceans due to age9–12, possible ototoxic drug administration13,14 or associated with hydrocephaly15  
have been reported in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, evidence of inner ear damage, com-
patible with noise-induced hearing loss, has not yet been described in a cetacean mass stranding event.

Long-term research has been undertaken to describe the ultrastructure of the normal organ of Corti in 
toothed whales with electron microscopy7. The best described species to date are harbour porpoise and striped 
dolphin. Describing the morphology of the most apical cells in the organ of Corti (i.e. cells at the tip of the coch-
lear spiral) is particularly challenging. OHCs in the apex are not firmly supported by Deiters’ cell bodies and the 
cuticular plate of the OHCs is not enlarged as found in the base or closer to the stapes7. This suggests that apical 
OHCs may be more sensitive to post-mortem decomposition.

Here we present the methodology and findings from analysis of inner ears recovered from two mass stranding 
events (MSE’s) that occurred in Scotland; in September 2012 and in June 2015. In both cases, to assess potential 
acoustic causes and auditory pathology, inner ears from the freshest cases were analysed using scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM).

Methods and Materials
Individual long-finned pilot whales involved in both MSE’s were necropsied as soon as possible after death. Both 
ear bones were dissected from the skull, removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Investigation into 
both MSE’s was coordinated by the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) with assistance pro-
vided from the Cetacean Stranding Investigation Programme, Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) and Moredun 
Research Institute.

Five teeth were collected from the mid-section of the left mandible of each sampled individual and preserved 
in 10% normal buffered formalin. Age was estimated for each individual using methods adapted from Lockyer16. 
Results from teeth aging can be found in Table 117.

2012 MSE. On September 2nd 2012, 21 long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) live stranded and died 
in shallow rocky foreshore between Anstruther and Pittenweem, East Scotland (56.2147–2.7190). Gross necrop-
sies were carried out on site on all 21 animals over the following 24–48 hours17. Six of the freshest samples from 
a total of 29 ears were extracted and fixed with 10% buffered formalin and considered for analysis (Table 1). 
Specifically, these were dissected from two juveniles, two sub-adults and two adult individuals. The periotic bone 
surrounding the cochlea was decalcified using RDO® (Apex Engineering Products Corporation, Aurora, Illinois, 
USA), a rapid decalcifier based on hydrochloric acid (see decalcification times in Table 1). Concentrations of 50% 
RDO for the first 24 hours and 25% RDO in the following days were used, according to a previously optimized 
protocol18.

2015 MSE. On the 2nd June 2015, 22 long finned pilot whales stranded on Brogaig beach, a steeply shelving, 
pebble and sand beach on the Trottenish peninsular of Skye (57.6374–6.2255). In total seven animals died or 
were euthanized by a trained marksman on welfare grounds, and a full necropsy was possible on six cases. One 
of the animals stranded was observed to be a pregnant female in significant distress and subsequent examination 
indicated a dystocia with a dead calf in utero. Recovery of carcasses for necropsy was logistically challenging.

However, extraction and fixation of the ears from all cases were prioritized. Details for the cases are given in 
Table 1.

In contrast to the 2012 protocol, the cochlea were perfused with 10% neutral buffered formalin via the round 
and oval windows prior to the ears being immersed in the fixative. This followed the protocol implemented by 
Morell and André19. Both ears were collected and depending on the extent of post mortem change, one ear per 
individual or both in case of M161.1/15 that was well preserved, was selected for ultrastructural analysis (Table 1).

The periotic bone surrounding the cochlea was decalcified using 14% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 
tetrasodium salt hydrate at pH 7.4 at room temperature (changing the solution once every 7–9 days20; see decal-
cification times in Table 1).

Dissection and processing for SEM. The decalcification of the periotic bone was stopped when the ves-
tibular scala and the stria vascularis of the cochlea were exposed. Subsequently, the cochleas and their tectorial 
membranes were dissected, dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, critical point dried with CO2, 
and then coated with gold-palladium or platinum-palladium. The 2012 samples were observed with an SEM at 
the Institute of Marine Sciences, Spanish National Research Council, Barcelona, Spain (Hitachi S-3500N). The 
2015 samples were observed with an SEM at the University of British Columbia Bioimaging Facility, Canada 
(Hitachi S-4700).

The same process was followed in all the samples except individual M280.2/12, which was discarded after 
observing macroscopic advanced autolysis.

To map the findings of our analysis we divided the cochlea into several regions, with the base of the cochlea 
closest to the stapes and the apex or apical region at the tip of the spiral.

Results
2012 and 2015 necropsy results. A detailed post-mortem investigation was performed to assess likely 
factors causal or contributory to both MSE’s. Gross and histopathological investigation of all animals did not 
find any indication of specific disease processes although several animals involved in the 2012 MSE were in poor 
general health. Toxin burden from harmful algal blooms (HAB) and heavy metal analysis also did not find levels 
sufficiently elevated to explain the stranding17. The observed behavioural response to the apparent dystocia in 
M161.6/15 was considered a significant factor in the initial stranding of 22 animals in the 2015 MSE.

Inner ear results: 2012 MSE. Based on SEM, we determined that all the cochleas fixed later than 18 hours 
post-mortem (Table 1) were in an advanced state of decomposition that prevented clear observation of the organ 
of Corti. However, the ear from a case fixed within 4 hours post-mortem (M280.1/12) was suitably well preserved; 
the organ of Corti was present throughout the cochlear spiral (Fig. 1). Although not perfectly intact, OHCs were 
clearly visible (Fig. 1A–D). However, in the apex of the cochlea, there were missing OHCs in the first 380 μ m 
(arrows in Fig. 1E).

In contrast to the rapid decomposition of the sensory epithelium after death, the tectorial membrane was 
shown to be more resistant to post-mortem autolysis and remained in acceptable condition for analysis when the 
cochlea was fixed within 18 to 22 hours post-mortem. The tectorial membrane showed regular OHC stereocilia 
imprints on the undersurface along the cochlear spiral (Fig. 2A,B) in all cases analysed, but there was no evidence 
of imprints in the apical region in any of the individuals sampled.

Inner ear results: 2015 MSE. The organ of Corti was found to have varying degrees of decomposition in 
all the samples (Fig. 3). Not all sensory cells were intact. However, their morphology was clearly visible and there 
was no conclusive evidence of scarring potentially indicative of noise-induced hearing loss. In general, the ears of 
the 2015 mass stranding were much better preserved than the 2012 cases, even M161.6/15, whose right ear was 
perfused 30–36 hours post-mortem (Fig. 3C).

The apical part of the tectorial membrane did not reveal imprints (Fig. 3E), but when apparent in other regions 
they were regular (Fig. 3F).

Discussion
Ears extracted from case M280.1/12 showed missing OHCs from the epithelium (arrows in Fig. 1E) in the apex 
of the cochlea. OHCs are responsible for enhancing auditory sensitivity and frequency selectivity. These missing 
OHCs would impair the lowest frequency hearing component of the hearing spectrum in M280.1/12. In addition 
to noise overexposure, the absence of hair cells can be due to several alternative causes, such as age, ototoxic drug 
administration, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposure, congenital or immunological disorders, or species 
and individual variability in apex morphology1,21–25.

Tooth analysis estimated this animal to be 2.5 years old, hence the absence of OHCs is unlikely to be a function 
of age. Furthermore, age related hearing loss is observed to primarily affect the high frequencies21, encoded at 
the cochlear base, whereas in this case the OHCs of the base of the cochlea were present with no scarring evident 
(Fig. 1B). Ototoxic drugs (e.g. gentamicin or amikacin) are similarly known to impair hearing at high frequencies22,  
but it is highly unlikely that the observed cell loss was due to exposure to these compounds, as no medication was 
administrated to these animals after stranding.

According to studies performed with rats, developmental exposure to PCBs results in severe hearing loss with 
corresponding mild to moderate loss of OHCs in the upper-middle and apical turns23–25. Samples from our 2012 
case were analysed for 25 individual PCB congeners using an internationally standardized methodology26,27. This 
animal yielded a total concentration of 5.24 mg/kg 25PCBs (on a lipid basis), well below the threshold considered 
to cause physiological derangements26,28, thus excluding overexposure to PCBs as a plausible cause for OHC

death. Other possible, but highly unlikely, causes such as developmental defects or possible immunological disor-
ders should be considered, however these are not yet detectable in routine necropsy protocols.

Very little is known about the common disposition of hair cells in the apex of the pilot whale cochlea. 
Our analysis of the best preserved pilot whale cochlea from the mass stranding in 2015 (M161.1/15, perfused 
15–16 hours post-mortem) did not show this pattern of missing OHCs at the apex (Fig. 3A). The sensory cells had 
lost their stereocilia at the apex but the cellular integrity was retained and it was possible to differentiate all 3 rows 
of OHCs. However, studies on terrestrial mammals show a high degree of individual and species variability in api-
cal morphology29. More research is needed to establish patterns of morphological normality in pilot whales and 
other cetacean species. Our preliminary results on harbour porpoises show that some cases there are intermittent 
missing cells in the third row of OHCs in the first ~200 μ m from the apex (Fig. 4) that could be attributed to nor-
mal apical variability since the phalangeal processes of the third row of Deiters cells are also missing (Fig. 4B). 
Although the relatively large area without OHCs observed in the 2012 case M280.1/12, together with the fact 
that OHCs of the first and second row are affected, is possible evidence of a lesion, individual apical variability in 
“healthy” animals cannot be ruled out as an alternative explanation.

In the case of noise-induced hearing loss, the sound sources responsible for such scars in individual 
M280.1/12 would mainly contain low frequency components. Studies of terrestrial mammals showed “the great-
est hearing-loss occurs at a frequency about half an octave above the exposure tone”30. As the missing OHCs 
were found in the apex region of the cochlea, the frequency range of the potential sources that could have caused 
the trauma may correspond to several anthropogenic marine activities, for example, pile driving, geo-physical 
experiments, or seismic operations. No seismic surveys with sufficient spatio-temporal overlap, that could be con-
sidered influential, were reported in the days leading up to the stranding17. We have no information on potential 
sound sources that the individual may have been exposed to at an earlier time.

As expected and previously described in other odontocete species7, the tectorial membrane appeared to be 
more resistant to post-mortem decomposition than the organ of Corti epithelium. The stereocilia of the OHCs 
fit into depressions or imprints on the tectorial membrane, therefore, any change at the stereocilia level should be 
reflected in the morphology of the undersurface of the tectorial membrane8, although other authors obtained dif-
ferent results when chinchillas were exposed to kanamycin31 or noise32. The observation that stereocilia imprints 
throughout the cochlear spiral of all processed individuals were regular (Figs 2 and 3F) except at the apex, would 
indicate that the OHCs were undamaged before death. This shows there was no evidence of hearing loss in the 
high frequencies. There were no imprints found in the apex of any tectorial membrane from the 12 samples 
analyzed. In some cases, its undersurface was not properly exposed when mounted since the tectorial membrane 
tends to coil during SEM processing, but in other cases, the imprints were not apparent. This result suggests that 
either 1) pilot whales have a different tectorial membrane apical morphology than terrestrial mammals33 where 
OHC stereocilia might be in close proximity, but not integrated into its undersurface or, more likely, 2) we could 
not observe the imprints due to the highly fibrous Hardesty membrane of the undersurface of the tectorial mem-
brane (Fig. 3E).

In terms of the 2012 MSE, a scenario where some of the pod was acoustically compromised in their ability 
to communicate or navigate would offer one explanation for the stranding, but as only animal M280.1/12 was 
diagnostic along entire cochlear spiral, any causality on the mass stranding cannot be made. Inclusion of accu-
rate inner ear perfusion in the 2015 samples yielded a considerable improvement in preservation of ultrastruc-
tural features of the inner ear sensory epithelium. Without perfusion, fixation of pilot whale ears after 18 hours 
post-mortem did not adequately preserve the organ of Corti cells for ultrastructural evaluation. However, the 
post-mortem interval of perfused inner ears can extend up to 24–30 hours in pilot whales with adequate retention 
of ultrastructural detail (Fig. 3A–E). Importantly, this makes the technique applicable to necropsy examinations 
in a field situation, where logistical constraints often result in a delay between death and ear extraction.

Although many stranding networks are now implementing extraction and fixation of the inner ear in cetacean 
mass stranding necropsies, it is not yet common practice universally. The results presented here show that an 
appropriate protocol to recover and analyse ears from suitable candidates is available and may provide essen-
tial information to understand the complex processes involved in these acute events. This methodology can be 
applied to single strandings as well if the time from death to fixation is under 30 hours. Our results reinforce a

recommendation presented at the International Whaling Commission workshop on cetacean stranding (San 
Francisco, December 2015) that carcases are triaged for necropsy, with the tissues most sensitive to post-mortem 
decomposition, such as the ears, removed first.

Overall, this demonstrates a method whereby ultrastructural changes in the ears of cetaceans can be accurately 
imaged in wild, dead stranded cetaceans. In turn this allows for quantification of any hearing impairment and, 
potentially, identification of the frequency range of noise overexposure responsible for ante-mortem hearing 
loss. This finding is of particular relevance to stranding network responders interested in collecting the ears for 
potential noise-induced hearing loss diagnosis. In turn this has important implications for policy making and 
ocean management, especially in those cases when overexposure to anthropogenic sounds may be linked to the 
cause of a stranding event.

Conclusions
There is strong demand from the public to establish the reason for cetacean mass strandings. Thorough investiga-
tion relies on considering a large number of potential factors with the aim of establishing, when possible, the most 
probable cause. In many cases the information available may not permit definitive conclusions to be drawn and 
the significance of a factor or factors has to be interpreted with care so as not to speculate. The inner ear analysis 
of 2012 and 2015 mass stranding of pilot whales in Scotland revealed that:

(1) SEM was particularly useful for detecting lesions or abnormalities in the organ of Corti cuticular plate beyond 
the first μ m from the apex, which can be associated with anthropogenic noise exposure.

(2) Perilymphatic perfusion of the cochlea greatly improved preservation of the inner ear ultrastructure, and 
extended considerably the diagnostic time window in which noise-induced hearing loss could be evaluated 
in pilot whales.

(3) Further research following the methodology presented here on normal apical morphology and the creation 
of cochlear frequency maps for pilot whales will be essential to distinguish between lesions and normal mor-
phology. In cases of noise-induced hearing loss, these maps will ultimately provide information on the causal 
sources of such lesions.
