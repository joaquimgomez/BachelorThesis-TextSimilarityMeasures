Abstract. While noise is now considered a marine hazard that 
can directly affect cetaceans and induce a stranding, no 
clinical approach has yet introduced the detection of a possible 
hearing loss at a stranding site as a necessary practice. Here 
we present the second generation of an autonomous and 
portable auditory screening system for cetacean clinical and 
research purposes. This system is composed by two 
independent and autonomous modules that build a more 
versatile, lighter and interference  isolated system. The 
improvement relies on the isolation between modules and their 
independency on many situations. The system is separated in 
two modules. The first one contains the low voltage 
biopotential amplification system and the acustic signal 
transmiter . The second module will activate only when needed 
for some frequencies and levels driving high voltage to the 
transducers thus avoiding interferences with the first module 
containing the low voltage amplifications system. The tool has 
been successfully tested for research purposes in captive 
dolphins and calibrated for a stranding site diagnoses 
operation.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Acoustic trauma and other noise related lesions have 
now been added to the list of potential causes of 
cetacean stranding [1][2]. 
 
A first generation of an Auditory Evoked Potentials 
autonomous acquisition unit was developed to help 
decision taking by testing on site the hearing 
functionality of stranded animals [3]. The evolution of 
that first generation system is presented featuring higher 
transducing capabilities while minimizing noise 
interferences, size and weight. The system is separated 
in two modules: a low voltage and a high voltage unit. 
The main module, the Low Voltage Unit features extra 
security that eliminates the presence of high voltages in 
the system that could generate hazards to patient/user 
from power leaking. It also includes a Transducer Signal 
Amplifier, designed for capacitive loads that ensures 
enough current driving capacity while it shows a strict 
stability, overheading the limitations given by the NI-
6062E card with a 48V and 240mA driving power.  The 

attenuator is integrated in the system allowing an 
accurate attenuation of the output level followed by a 
transient filtering system to avoid high level clicks at 
start-up. This is of extreme importance as pulse due to 
manual changes in the system configuration could cause 
injuries or stress to the diagnosed animal. Visual and 
electronic feedback of the voltage drived to the 
transducer is monitored through the data acquisition card 
(PCMCIA format)and visually displayed in an analog 
indicator allowing a fine calculation of the levels emitted 
through the software interface and providing analog 
visual information to the user. 
The electrode connectors feature full IP67 protection 
with no electromagnetic discontinuity in the case cover 
avoiding possible interferences due to shield 
discontinuities. The electrodes are gold plated, 
embedded in a suction cup with mechanical protection 
against sudden pulls out or swim away behaviors that 
often happen in captive animals. The system is thought 
to be improved though: it has therefore been designed in 
a modular way that allows an easy replacement of the 
integrated boards in case of failure or a need of 
upgrading.

The secondary High Voltage Unit features a switching 
power supply providing noise leakage minimization via 
physical separation of the two units. This system is ready 
to work only in case it is needed (Fig 2.), when high 
levels are required, e.g. in the case an animal presents a 
severe hearing loss at a certain frequency band. The use 
of different transducers, depending on their sensitivity in 



the high frequency band, minimizes the need of 
frequently requesting this high voltage unit.

CONCLUSION 

This portable system is more stable, independent and 
noise isolated than its previous first version. It’s small 
size and small weight allows an easy carriage and 
maneuver.
