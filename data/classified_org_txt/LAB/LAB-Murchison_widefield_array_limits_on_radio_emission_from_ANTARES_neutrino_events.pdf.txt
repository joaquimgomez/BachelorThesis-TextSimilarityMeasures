ABSTRACT
We present a search, using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), for electromagnetic counterparts to

two candidate high energy neutrino events detected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope in 2013 November
and 2014 March. These events were selected by ANTARES because they are consistent, within 0.◦4, with
the locations of galaxies within 20 Mpc of Earth. Using MWA archival data at frequencies between 118 and
182 MHz, taken ∼ 20 days prior to, at the same time as, and up to a year after the neutrino triggers, we look
for transient or strongly variable radio sources consistent with the neutrino positions. No such counterparts
are detected, and we set a 5σ upper limit for low-frequency radio emission of ∼ 1037 erg s−1 for progenitors
at 20 Mpc. If the neutrino sources are instead not in nearby galaxies, but originate in binary neutron star
coalescences, our limits place the progenitors at z & 0.2. While it is possible, due to the high background
from atmospheric neutrinos, that neither event is astrophysical, the MWA observations are nevertheless among
the first to follow up neutrino candidates in the radio, and illustrate the promise of wide-field instruments like
MWA to detect electromagnetic counterparts to such events.

1. INTRODUCTION

Neutrinos are believed to be emitted by a range of astro-
physical sources (Chiarusi & Spurio 2010; Anchordoqui &
Montaruli 2010), including transient sources such as gamma-
ray bursts (GRBs), core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGNs), or microquasars. Neutrinos pro-
vide a powerful probe of high-energy astrophysical environ-
ments, because they are unaffected by magnetic fields, and
are extremely unlikely to be absorbed by material between
the source and observer. These same properties make them
very challenging to detect, even by the largest of the current
generation of neutrino observatories, and contaminating back-
ground signals are high. However, if their directions can be

localized, they have the potential to point directly back to the
astrophysical accelerators in which they are created.

Even so, typical positional uncertainties from neutrino tele-
scopes are large enough to encompass many potential elec-
tromagnetic (EM) counterparts. A solution to dramatically
decrease association ambiguity is to search for transient EM
emission that is spatially and temporally consistent with neu-
trino events. However, aside from neutrinos from the Sun,
the only astronomical source so far associated with a neu-
trino detection (in the tens of MeV energy range) is SN 1987A
(Pagliaroli et al. 2009; Bionta et al. 1987; Hirata et al. 1987;
Alexeyev et al. 1988) — although recently Kadler et al. (2016)
reported a blazar outburst coincident with a PeV-energy neu-
trino event. Timely multi-wavelength follow-up of neutrino
candidates is key in order to attempt to identify the progeni-
tors of astrophysical neutrinos.

The two most sensitive neutrino telescopes currently op-
erating are ANTARES (Ageron et al. 2011) and IceCube
(Achterberg et al. 2006). Both search for Cherenkov radia-
tion from secondary particles produced from cosmic neutri-
nos with energies > 100 GeV. For IceCube (IceCube Collab-
oration 2013), located at the South Pole, neutrinos from the
southern sky are observed as downward-going. Below a PeV,
these neutrinos are selected with a vetoing technique that fa-
vors the detection of showering events, for which the detector
has an angular resolution of only 10◦ − 15◦.

ANTARES, located 40 km off the southern coast of France
in the Mediterranean Sea, views the southern sky via upward-
going neutrino-induced muon tracks, with a characteristic
resolution (50% error circle) of 0.◦4 (Adrián-Martínez et al.
2014). The detector produces the best limits on neutrino emis-
sions for point-like objects in most of this southern sky region,
and hence EM follow-up efforts are concentrated there. A
dedicated alert system, TAToO (Ageron et al. 2012), is trig-
gered when a candidate special neutrino event is detected: a
single high-energy neutrino; a neutrino in the direction of a
local galaxy; or at least two neutrinos coincident in space and
time (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2015b).

In this analysis, we searched the MWA archives for obser-
vations that were coincident in time and position with neu-
trino triggers from ANTARES from mid 2013 to mid 2015.
Two events, ANT 131121A and ANT 140323A, were found
to occur within the MWA field of view (Table 1), when the
MWA happened to be observing the trigger position just prior
to, during, and immediately after the trigger time.

A brief description of the two events and optical follow-
up is given in Section 2. The MWA follow up is presented
in Section 3. Limits on progenitors, as well as prospects for
future work, are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

2. ANTARES NEUTRINO EVENTS AND OPTICAL FOLLOW-UP

ANTARES detects 2 − 3 neutrino candidates per day on av-
erage. From mid 2013 to mid 2015, more than 60 ANTARES
events satisfied one of the three special triggers discussed
above, and a TAToO alert was issued. For many of these
alerts, a network of robotic optical telescopes started obser-
vations as soon as possible (prompt strategy) and continued
up to two months (long-term strategy) after the neutrino de-
tection. These strategies are well-suited to the search for
rapidly-varying transient sources, such as GRB afterglows,
and slowly-varying sources, such as CCSNe.

Both triggers with simultaneous MWA observations were
among the∼ 30 selected with the ANTARES directional trig-
ger between mid 2013 and mid 2015. Such triggers have di-

rections consistent (< 0.◦4) with the positions (White et al.
2011) of galaxies within 20 Mpc of Earth. Two galaxies
match in each case: NGC 1374 and ESO 358-015 match
ANT 131121A, and ESO 499-037 and PGC 29194 match
ANT 140323A. PGC 29194 (the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy), at a
distance of 1.3 Mpc, is located just 6′ from the neutrino posi-
tion.

Both neutrino events also had optical follow-up. For
ANT 131121A, 12 observations of 6 images were performed
with the 0.25-m TAROT telescope in Chile from 2 − 61 days
after the trigger. Optical images were analyzed with an image-
subtraction pipeline (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2015b). No tran-
sient was identified, to a limiting magnitude of ∼ 19 (Adrián-
Martínez et al. 2015a). For ANT 140323A, a total of 8 images
were taken with ROTSE 3b in Texas (starting ∼ 15 hr after
the trigger) according to the prompt strategy, and 10 images
with TAROT Chile up to 45 days after the trigger according
to the long-term strategy. No transient counterpart was found
(Adrián-Martínez et al. 2015a,b), to limiting magnitudes of
16.4 (prompt) and 18.7 (long-term).

3. MWA FOLLOW-UP OF ANTARES EVENTS

The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), situated in West-
ern Australia, is the Square Kilometre Array precursor at low
(80 − 300 MHz) radio frequencies (Lonsdale et al. 2009; Tin-
gay et al. 2013). The MWA is often used to undertake surveys,
for a range of science goals including dedicated (e. g. , Bell
et al. 2014; Murphy et al. 2015) and commensal (e. g. Rowl-
inson et al. 2015; Tingay et al. 2015) transient searches, but
it has also been used for triggered follow-up of transients at
other wavelengths (e. g. , Kaplan et al. 2015). Its huge field
of view (700 square degrees at 150 MHz) also means that
archival observations have a much larger chance, compared
to most other radio telescopes, of serendipitously covering
an event of interest. This capability is particularly valuable
for follow-up of neutrino or gravitational wave (Singer et al.
2015) candidates, which have rather large position uncertain-
ties.

We obtained MWA archival data for both ANTARES trig-
gers, from periods before (Section 3.2) and at the time of (Sec-
tion 3.1) the trigger, in a search for prompt emission. We also
searched for data over a longer range of time to look for late-
time emission (Section 3.3).

Flagged CASA (McMullin et al. 2007) measurement sets
were produced using the MWA preprocessing pipeline COT-
TER (Offringa et al. 2015). These were then processed by our
custom imaging pipeline, which used WSCLEAN (Offringa
et al. 2014) with 40,000 CLEAN iterations to produce XX
and YY polarization images with 3072×3072 0.′9 pixels. The
images were amplitude and phase self-calibrated, and primary
beam corrected to produce Stokes I images which formed the
basis for our analysis. Catalogs were generated using Aegean
(Hancock et al. 2012) and cross-matched across snapshots.

3.1. Search for Prompt Emission

For each of the two triggers, we retrieved 34 MWA datasets,
in addition to observations of nearby bright radio calibrators
(Pic A for ANT 131121A and Hyd A for ANT 140323A). Ex-
posure times were 112 s, and snapshots were taken approxi-
mately every 2 min, from ∼ 10 min before the neutrino trig-
ger to 1 hr after (sufficiently long to probe dispersion mea-
sures > 104 pc cm−3). For ANT 131121A, the central fre-
quency for each observation was 154.255 MHz, and the band-
width was 30.72 MHz, divided into 768 channels of 40 kHz.
ANT 140323A had the same bandwidth and channels, but the
central frequency was 182.415 MHz. The MWA synthesized
beam is ∼ 2′×2′ at 154 MHz.

One of the 34 snapshots for ANT 131121A failed to image
adequately and was discarded. Comparison by eye of the re-
maining snapshot images for each trigger showed no obvious
transients to be present in or near the ANTARES 90% error
circles, which are 1◦ in radius (Adrián-Martínez et al. 2014).
Additionally, no transients (sources ≥ 5 times brighter than
the background fluctuations) were present in catalogs corre-
sponding to a single snapshot within the ANTARES error cir-
cles.

We extracted square image cutouts 5◦ on a side centered
on the trigger positions, and combined these, taking the me-
dian value at each pixel position, to create a deep image for
each trigger (center panels of Figure 1). We also measured the
RMS flux density in the object-subtracted background sky,
σsky (which corresponds to the sensitivity), in the 5◦ × 5◦
regions centered on each trigger. The flux density for the
faintest detectable source was set at 4σsky.

The mean σsky of the 33 ANT 131121A prompt snapshot
images was 48 mJy beam−1, and the standard deviation of σsky
for these images was 4 mJy beam−1. The 34 ANT 140323A
prompt snapshots had σsky = 87 ± 7 mJy beam−1. For
ANT 131121A, σsky for the deep image made from the
33 snapshots should naively correspond to 48/

√
33 =

8 mJy beam−1. After the snapshots have been median com-
bined (i.e. the median at each pixel is used), however, the mea-
sured σsky is somewhat higher (18 mJy beam−1) than the naive
expectation, due to the presence of sidelobes and confused
sources (Wayth et al. 2015). Similarly, for ANT 140323A we
obtained 47 mJy beam−1 for the deep median-combined im-
age. The difference in sensitivity between the two fields is
partly because of the difference in frequencies, and partly be-
cause ANT 140323A is closer to the edge of the MWA pri-
mary beam than ANT 131121A, resulting in higher σsky.

3.2. Pre-trigger Comparison Images
We also retrieved archival MWA data from ∼ 20 days prior

to each trigger. For ANT 131121A we obtained 30 observa-
tions at 154 MHz from UT 2013 Nov 1. For ANT 140323A
we obtained 31 observations at 182 MHz from UT 2014 Mar
2. These were analyzed in the same manner as described
above. Deep images made from combining the ∼ 1 hr of ob-
servations for each trigger are shown in the left panels of Fig-
ure 1. Comparison of the pre-trigger and prompt deep images
by eye again showed no obvious transients.

We used the matched snapshot catalogs (independently for
the pre-trigger and prompt datasets) to measure the mean
(S̄) and standard deviation (σS) of the flux densities of ra-
dio sources detected in our data. For all sources detected
in at least 10 of the ∼ 30 snapshots, we computed variabil-
ity statistics (reduced chi-squared, χ2ν , and fractional modu-

the comparison challenging, but if a trigger was associated
with strong variability in an existing radio source, we might
expect to see an outlier with high χ2ν and fractional modula-
tion in the prompt dataset, but not in the corresponding pre-
trigger dataset.

The majority of points in our variability plots occupy a
contiguous region of parameter space, with brighter sources
tending to be detected in more snapshots, and having higher
χ2ν , as would be expected given improved signal to noise for
these sources. Very few well-detected sources (those seen in
∼ 30 snapshots) exhibit σS/S̄ & 50%, with the exception of
the largest (i.e. brightest) two points in the ANT 131121A
prompt plot, which have σS/S̄ = 0.59 and 0.55 respectively.
Both have χ2ν ≈ 10, suggesting that they are indeed strongly
variable. However, both are coincident with the lobes of For-
nax A, and while variability of an AGN core is possible on
short timescales, variability of extended lobe emission is not.
We conclude therefore that the apparent variability here is
caused by the difficulty of fitting point source models to ex-
tended emission. Variations in sensitivity and image quality
result in different fits at each epoch, which is also why these
sources do not appear in the same position in the top left panel
of Figure 2. In any case, Fornax A is too far from the trigger
position, given the ANTARES positional uncertainties, to be
the neutrino source (likelihood of association ∼ 5×10−4).

The plots for ANT 140323A show fewer sources, due to
the poorer sensitivity associated with the location of this can-
didate towards the edge of the primary beam. Nevertheless
there are no well-detected sources that appear as outliers in

the prompt data and not in the pre-trigger data. We conclude,
therefore, that our observations did not convincingly detect
any strong AGN flares associated with the neutrino triggers.

3.3. Search for Late-Time Emission
The MWA observing strategy, in particular changes in pro-

grams from one season to the next, somewhat restricts our
ability to obtain a long-timescale follow-up of any given posi-
tion of interest by simply searching the archive (as opposed to
undertaking a dedicated follow-up campaign). Nevertheless,
we were able to retrieve observations for both triggers that
can be used to constrain late-time emission. We searched the
archive for observations evenly distributed in log(time): 1, 2,
4, . . . , 8192 hr after the trigger. In most cases we were able to
find data close in time to the desired epoch (Table 2). When
no suitable data were present in the archive that were closer in
log(time) to a given epoch than to the previous or next epoch,
that epoch was skipped.

Images were produced in the same manner as described
above. Snapshot image sensitivity (which can be sensitive
to the inclusion of relatively small amounts of poor quality
data), σsky, ranged from 49 − 373 mJy beam−1 (Table 2). Once
again, we made deep images (right panels of Figure 1) by
median-combining snapshots. Since the snapshots were taken
over a wide range in time (see Table 2) the median will de-
emphasize sources which vary with a characteristic timescale
� 1 yr. These images nevertheless provide good sensitivity
to long-timescale transient or variable sources associated with
the neutrino.

Once again, neither trigger had an obvious transient coun-
terpart, either in the snapshots, or the deep images.

4. LIMITS ON PROGENITORS

ANTARES detects ∼ 2 atmospheric neutrinos per day with
energies comparable to our two events (& 1 TeV). However,
both candidates were generated by the ANTARES directional
trigger (Section 2), having positions coincident with galax-
ies within 20 Mpc. Such coincidences represent ∼ 2% of the
background from atmospheric events (Adrián-Martínez et al.
2015b). If we assume the ANTARES neutrinos are indeed as-
trophysical, rather than due to terrestrial backgrounds, we can
use our data to place some of the first low-frequency radio
limits on EM counterparts to neutrino events. If the nearby
galaxies are the hosts of the neutrino progenitors, this allows
us to place limits on the luminosity of any EM counterpart.

Using 5σ upper limits of 90 − 340 mJy (based on σsky
for the deep images in Table 2, which ranges from 18 to
68 mJy beam−1), we obtain L150 MHz . 1029 erg s−1 Hz−1 (.
1037 erg s−1) for progenitors at 20 Mpc. These limits are
not strongly constraining of late-time emission from even
the most luminous radio supernovae or GRBs at these dis-
tances; during the first∼ 100 days after the event, radio emis-
sion at MWA frequencies would be expected to be . 1028 erg
s−1 Hz−1 (Soderberg et al. 2010). Our limits are better (.
1027 erg s−1 Hz−1) if ANT 140323A is associated with the
Antlia Dwarf at 1.3 Mpc, but this still does not provide a
strong constraint on progenitors. In fact, due to synchrotron

self-absorption at low radio frequencies, late-time emission
tends to be faint in general (e.g. Metzger et al. 2015), further
emphasizing the need for rapid response or simultaneous ob-
servations to search for brighter prompt radio emission.

For GRBs or CCSNe at distances < 20 Mpc, we consider
whether counterparts should have been seen in the optical
observations (Section 2). At 20 Mpc, the optical limit of
18.7 mag corresponds to absolute magnitudes brighter than
−13, sensitive enough to detect all but the faintest (e.g. Pas-
torello et al. 2007) supernovae, although this does not account
for dust obscuration in the host galaxy. We also consider a
scenario where the nearby galaxies are chance alignments,
and the progenitors are in fact at larger distances. Considering
the possibility that the neutrinos might be from binary neutron
star coalescences such as those modeled by Pshirkov & Post-
nov (2010), our upper limits for prompt emission, with their
Equation 8 and assuming an efficiency scaling exponent γ = 0,
would place such progenitors at distances & 1 Gpc (z & 0.2).

5. OUTLOOK

Although the MWA has excellent capabilities for these
kinds of serendipitous searches due to its wide field of
view, the use of archival data has limitations. Neither trig-
ger was optimally placed within the MWA field of view:
ANT 131121A was ∼ 8◦ from the pointing center, and
ANT 140323A was∼ 17◦ away. Particularly in the latter case,
the fall-off in primary beam response means that noise in the

region of the image near the trigger position is higher than
is ideal. Going forward, we intend to trigger pointed obser-
vations soon after a neutrino detection. The region of sky
seen from the MWA is well-matched to where ANTARES
has good sensitivity, meaning that around 40% of ANTARES
upward-going events are accessible to rapid MWA follow-up.
ANTARES can generate triggers in a few seconds, and MWA
can point at the trigger position within another 10 s, allowing
us to probe dispersion measures as low as 100 pc cm−3 (Ka-
plan et al. 2015), sufficiently fast to detect even minimally-
dispersed events from the nearest galaxies. The MWA’s wide
field of view also means that targeted follow-up observations
easily probe the entire error circle of ANTARES events with
optimal MWA sensitivity.

It is notable that Fornax A, one of the brightest radio
sources in the sky (associated with NGC 1316 at a distance of
∼ 20 Mpc) is close (∼ 3◦) to the position of ANT 131121A,
although it is strongly ruled out as the progenitor given the
positional uncertainties of the ANTARES trigger. However,
this region of the sky is densely populated with galaxies (in-
cluding∼ 10 bright members of the Fornax Cluster within the
neutrino error circle), illustrating the importance of EM ob-
servations coincident in time with neutrino triggers to resolve
ambiguity as to the progenitor.

Although we found no strongly varying radio counterpart
to the two triggers discussed here, MWA data at the posi-
tions of additional ANTARES triggers exist in our archive,
albeit not simultaneous in time with the triggers. We defer
the analysis of late-time and pre-trigger observations of these
events to a future paper. Additionally, future rapid follow-up
(a capability already demonstrated at MWA), combined with

an increase in sensitivity (due to a decrease in the confusion
limit from the recently approved MWA expansion), mean that
MWA is well placed to follow up promising neutrino candi-
dates over the next few years.
