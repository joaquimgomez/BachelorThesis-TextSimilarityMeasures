Abstract. ANTARES is currently the largest neutrino telescope operating in the Northern
Hemisphere, aiming at the detection of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources.
Neutrino telescopes constantly monitor at least one complete hemisphere of the sky, and are
thus well-suited to detect neutrinos produced in transient astrophysical sources. A time-
dependent search has been applied to a list of 33 X-ray binaries undergoing high flaring
activities in satellite data (RXTE/ASM, MAXI and Swift/BAT) and during hardness transi-
tion states in the 2008–2012 period. The background originating from interactions of charged
cosmic rays in the Earth’s atmosphere is drastically reduced by requiring a directional and
temporal coincidence with astrophysical phenomena. The results of this search are presented
together with comparisons between the neutrino flux upper limits and the neutrino flux pre-
dictions from astrophysical models. The neutrino flux upper limits resulting from this search
limit the jet parameter space for some astrophysical models.

1 Introduction

X-ray binaries are binary systems composed of a compact object (neutron star (NS) or stellar
mass black hole (BH) candidate) and a companion non-degenerate star. Due to the strong
gravitational attraction, matter expelled from the companion is accreted by the compact
object. Depending on the mass of the companion star and the process of matter accretion, X-
ray binaries are separated into two classes: Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB) which contain
an evolved companion star of spectral class later than B transferring matter to the compact
object through Roche lobe overflows; and High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB) consisting of a
massive O or B star developing intense stellar winds, a fraction of which is accreted by the
compact object. While some of these objects are seen as persistent sources, most of them
exhibit occasional outbursts, making them transient sources, in particular in the radio and
X-ray domains.

Recent detections of GeV–TeV gamma-ray signals from some X-ray binaries confirm that
they can produce outflows containing particles accelerated away from the compact object up
to relativistic speeds [1]. At the moment, it is not clear whether the high-energy particle ac-
celeration is a common process occurring in X-ray binaries but observed only in some systems
with preferred (geometrical) characteristics with respect to the line of sight, or whether it is
powered by a different mechanism at work only in some specific systems.

The theoretical mechanisms of gamma-ray production from X-ray binaries generally
assume (very-) high-energy photon emission from the interaction of a relativistic outflow
from the compact object with the wind and radiation emitted by the companion star. The
outflow can take different shapes. In microquasars [2] the high-energy emission is due to
accretion energy released in the form of a collimated relativistic jets, detected in the radio
domain through synchrotron emission. On the contrary, in other binary systems, high-energy
emission can occur in a wide-angle shocked region, at the interface between pulsar and stellar
winds [3]. They are probably the sites of effective acceleration of particles (electrons and/or
protons) to multi-TeV energies but the nature of the high-energy emission is still unknown,
and leptonic or hadronic origin is still debated nowadays [4–6].

Even if a rich variety of binary systems seems to be cosmic accelerators, some major
issues are still open: are jets a common feature of X-ray binary systems? What is the
particle acceleration mechanism at work in these systems? Is it unique? Constraining the
jet composition and its baryonic content will help answering these questions. Indeed, the jet
composition should be affected by the outflow-launching processes. For instance, jets powered
by an accretion disk are likely to contain baryons [7] while jets which get their power from
black hole spin are expected to be purely leptonic [8]. Up to now, a hadronic component has
been identified in only two X-ray binaries (SS 433 and 4U 1630-472) [8, 9] while a population
of cold baryons present in the relativistic jet of CygX-1 has been proposed [10].

Hadronic models of jet interactions with the winds of massive stars were developed these
last decades. The dominant hadronic contributions are expected from the photo-hadronic (p-
γ) interactions between relativistic protons and synchrotron photons in the jet or coming
from external sources [11, 12]), and from the hadronic (p-p) interactions between relativistic
protons from the jet and thermal protons from the stellar wind [13–16]. In the absence of a
jet, neutrinos can be produced through p-p processes between the accelerated protons in the
the rotation-driven relativistic wind from the young neutron star and the circumstellar disk
in the case of Be type stars [17, 18]. The detection of high-energy neutrinos from an X-ray
binary system would definitively confirm the presence of relativistic protons in the outflow,
and thus further constrain the particle acceleration mechanism.

The ANTARES Collaboration completed the construction of a neutrino telescope in the
Mediterranean Sea with the connection of its twelfth detector line in May 2008 [19]. The
telescope is located 20 km off the Southern coast of France (42◦48’N, 6◦10’E), at a depth
of 2475 m. In the ANTARES telescope, events are primarily detected by observing the
Cherenkov light induced by relativistic muons in the darkness of the deep sea. Owing to their
low interaction probablility, only neutrinos have the ability to cross the Earth. Therefore, an
upgoing muon is an unambiguous signature of a neutrino interaction close to the detector.
To distinguish astrophysical neutrino events from background events (muons and neutrinos)
generated in the atmosphere, energy and direction reconstructions have been used in several
searches [20, 21]. To improve the signal-to-noise discrimination, the arrival time information
can be used to significantly reduce the effective background [22].

In this paper, the results of a time-dependent search for cosmic neutrino sources using
the ANTARES data taken from 2008 to 2012 is presented. This extends a previous ANTARES
analysis [23] where only six sources and the first three years of data-taking were considered.
It is also complementary to a previous IceCube transient analysis [24] which considered few
X-ray binary systems. However, the ANTARES location in the northern hemisphere, and its
lower neutrino energy threshold in comparison with IceCube, make it well-suited to study
neutrino emission from such galactic sources. Neutrino emission has been searched-for during
outburst periods of X-ray binaries characterised by the variability of their soft and hard X-
ray flux density [25]. Jet emission, probably linked to particle acceleration and thus potential
neutrino emission, usually occurs during periods of high levels of hard X-ray flux density
(called hard states) and during transition periods (intermediate states) between a hard state
and a soft state. Sections 2 and 3 present the selection of outburst periods selection from
X-ray light curves, during hard and intermediate states respectively. Section 4 details the
statistical approach used to perform the analysis, while results are provided and discussed in
Section 5. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

2 Selection of outburst periods

The time-dependent analysis described in the following sections is applied to a list of X-ray
binaries exhibiting outburst periods in their light curves. In the following, particle acceleration
is assumed to take place in the XRB and neutrino emission is assumed to be correlated with
hard X-ray outbursts. This is generally the case for microquasars exhibiting relativistic jets.
Indeed, a correlation is expected between hard X-ray outbursts (usually produced by both
synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms) and compact jet emission where cosmic ray
acceleration may occur [26]. It can be noticed that larger Lorentz factors and potentially larger
neutrino emission might be expected during transition states, when transient outbursts are
observed. These specific states of microquasars will be treated in Section 3.

However, most of the X-ray binaries included in our sample are not classified as micro-
quasars. This might not prevent neutrino emission, in particular during hard X-ray outburst
phases. For instance, the LMXB GRO J0422+32 does not present any clear evidence of a rel-
ativistic jet although hard X-ray flares are observed [27]. During these outbursts, cosmic rays
might be accelerated through magnetic reconnection in the corona (where hard X-ray photons
are produced) surrounding the black hole, as suggested by [28]. X-ray binaries containing a
magnetized NS do not usually exhibit relativistic ejection of matter. However, as observed in
systems such as Cir X-1 [29], transient jets can be produced upon a sufficiently low (. 108 G)
magnetic field magnitude at the surface of the NS [30], based on a similar accretion/ejection
mechanism as microquasars. In supergiant fast X-ray transients (HMXB composed of a NS
and exhibiting rapid hard X-ray flux evolution) magnetic field decay could also allow for rela-
tivistic particle injection when large clumps of matter are accreted by the NS [31], producing
again a potential correlation between hard X-ray flares and particle acceleration.

Finally, when the magnetosphere of an accreting NS penetrates the decretion disk of the
compagnon star (as observed in HMXB composed of a Be type companion star), intense hard
X-ray emission is expected [32]. Meanwhile, in the case of magnetized NS, the magnetosphere
may develop electrostatic gaps where protons could be accelerated along the magnetic field
lines, thus allowing for neutrino production [33].

Light curves used for the selection of outburst periods are obtained mainly using the
Swift/BAT telescope1. These data are complemented by those from other instruments:
RXTE/ASM2 and MAXI3. A maximum likelihood block (MLB) algorithm [34] is used to
remove noise from the light curve by iterating over the data points and selecting periods dur-
ing which data are consistent with a constant flux within statistical errors. This algorithm is
applied independently to all the light curves from all the satellites. Depending on the time
period and the availability of the different instruments, outbursts are better observed in one
apparatus compared to others. As the energy range and the sensitivity of these telescopes
are different, it is not easy to combine measurements into a single time-dependent function to
describe the light curve. The value of the steady state (i.e. baseline, BL) and its fluctuation
(σBL) are determined with a Gaussian fit of the lower part of the distribution of the flux.
The baseline is subtracted from the light curve and the amplitude is converted to a relative
amplitude by dividing by σBL. Finally, the relative light curves from different instruments
are merged, as can be seen for the sample source 4U 1705-440 in Figure 1. This is used to

Figure 1. Light curves for 4U 1705-440 as seen by Swift/BAT, RXTE/ASM and MAXI during the
studied period. The estimated baseline emissions, BL, (red lines) and BL+1σBL (magenta lines) are
also shown. Histograms correspond to the light curves treated with the MLB algorithm. The blue
histograms represent the selected flaring periods of each light curve, merged to produce the time PDF
(bottom). Green histograms show periods of each light curve not selected for this analysis.

The flaring periods are defined from the blocks of the light curve characterised by the
MLB algorithm in three main steps. Firstly, seeds are identified by searching for blocks with
an amplitude above BL + 8σBL. Then, each period is extended forward and backward up
to an emission compatible with BL + 1σBL. A delay of 0.5 days is added before and after
the flare in order to take into account that the precise time of the flare is not known (one-day
binned light curve) and the potential delay between the X-ray and neutrino emissions. Finally,
spurious flares are discarded if they are not visible by at least one other instrument. The final
list includes 33 X-ray binaries: 1 HMXB (BH), 11 HMXB (NS), 8 HMXB (BH candidate),
10 LMXB (NS) and 3 XRB (BH candidate), as reported in Table 1. Table 2 summarizes for

3 Selection of transition state periods

Spectral transition states of XRB are difficult to define: there are no regular observations
with X-ray satellites, and statistics are very low due to the inaccurate measurement of the
hardness ratio, defined as the ratio of counts in different X-ray wavebands. Considering the
difficulties of an extensive coverage of the transition states of XRB, the selection of the these

periods, are shown in Table 3. Considering the lack of information on the time variation of

4 Time-dependent analysis

The ANTARES data collected between 2008 and 2012, corresponding to 1044 days of lifetime,
are analysed to search for neutrino events around the selected sources, in coincidence with
the time periods defined in the previous sections. The statistical method adopted to infer the
presence of a signal on top of the atmospheric neutrino background, or alternatively set upper
limits on the neutrino flux is an unbinned method based on an extended maximum likelihood
ratio test statistic. It has been previously used to search for neutrinos from gamma-ray flaring
blazars [35]. The likelihood, L, is defined as:

lnL(NS) =

(
N∑
i=1

ln[NSSi +NBBi]

)
− [NS +NB] (4.1)

where Si and Bi are the probabilities for signal and background for an event i, respectively,
and NS (not known) and NB (known) are the number of expected signal and background
events in the data sample. N is the total number of events in the considered data sample.
To discriminate the signal-like events from background, these probabilities are described by
the product of three components related to the direction, energy, and timing of each event.
For an event i, the signal probability is:

Si = Sspace(Ψi) · Senergy(dE/dXi) · Stime(ti + tlag) (4.2)

Here, Sspace is a parametrisation of the point spread function, i.e., Sspace(Ψi) is the
probability to reconstruct an event i at an angular distance Ψi from the true source loca-
tion. The energy PDF, Senergy, is the normalised distribution of the muon energy estima-
tor, dE/dX, of an event according to the studied energy spectrum. To cover the majority
of the range allowed by the models [12, 36] accessible to the ANTARES sensitivity, three
neutrino-energy differential spectra are tested in this analysis: E−2, E−2 exp(−E/100 TeV)
and E−2 exp(−E/10 TeV), where E is the neutrino energy. The shape of the time PDF,
Stime, for the signal event is extracted directly from the gamma-ray light curve parametrisa-
tion, as described in the previous sections, assuming proportionality between gamma-ray and
neutrino fluxes. A possible lag of up to ±5 days has been introduced in the likelihood to allow
for small lags in the proportionality. This corresponds to a possible shift of the entire time

– 7 –



PDF. The lag parameter is fitted in the likelihood maximisation together with the number of
fitted signal events in the data. The background probability for an event i is:

Bi = Bspace(δi) · Benergy(dE/dXi) · Btime(ti) (4.3)

where the directional PDF, Bspace, the energy PDF, Benergy, and the time PDF, Btime, for the
background are derived from data using, respectively, the observed declination, δi, distribution
of selected events in the sample, the measured distribution of the energy estimator, and the
observed time distribution of all the reconstructed muons.

The goal of the unbinned search is to determine, in a given direction in the sky and at
a given time, the relative contribution of each component, and to calculate the probability to
have a signal above a given background model. This is done via the test statistic, λ, defined as
the ratio of the probability for the hypothesis of background plus signal over the probability
of only background:

λ =

N∑
i=1

ln
L(NS)
L(NS = 0)

(4.4)

The evaluation of the test statistic is performed by generating pseudo-experiments sim-
ulating background and signal in a 30◦ cone around the considered source according to the
background-only and background plus signal hypotheses. The performance of the time-
dependent analysis is computed using toy experiments. For time ranges characteristic of
flaring activity, the time-dependent search presented here improves the discovery potential by
on-average a factor 2-3 with respect to a standard time-integrated point-source search [20],
under the assumption that the neutrino emission is correlated with the X-ray flaring activity.

5 Results and discussions

5.1 Results

Only one source exhibited a significant signal excess during an X-ray flare: GX1+4, with
287 days of flare duration included in the analysis, shows a p-value of 4.1% with a fitted
signal of 0.7 events and a lag of −4 days, which is obtained with the 100 TeV cutoff energy
spectrum. This result is due to one (three) events in a cone of 1 (3) degrees in coincidence
with X-ray outbursts detected by RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT. Figure 2 shows the light
curve of GX1+4 with the time of the neutrino candidates, the estimated energy distribution,
and the angular distribution of the events around the position of this source. The post-trial
probability, computed by taking into account the 33 searches, is 72%, and is thus compatible
with background fluctuations. In the hardness transition state analysis, no significant excess
has been found, with a 77% post-trial probability for the full analysis.

In the absence of a discovery, upper limits on the neutrino fluence, Fν , the energy flux,
F , and the differential flux normalisation, φ0, at 90% confidence level are computed using
5-95% of the energy range as:

Fν = ∆t · F = ∆t
∫ Emax
Emin

dE · E · φ0 · S(E) = ∆t · φ0 · I(E) (5.1)

where S(E) is the dimensionless neutrino spectrum, e.g. for the E−2 spectrum,dN/dE =
φ0 · S(E) = φ0 · (E/GeV)−2. The limits are calculated according to the classical (frequentist)
method for upper limits [37] and are summarised in Table 4. Figure 3 displays these upper

In the following, the fluence upper limits derived above are discussed in the light of the-
oretical models of neutrino production in X-ray binaries. Microquasars are considered first,
followed by X-ray binaries that do not exhibit relativistic jets.

5.2 Discussion on the microquasar case

Neutrinos can be produced in microquasars either in p-γ [12, 38] or p-p interactions [13, 14],
as discussed in the introduction. However, both p-γ and p-p models usually assume that
the magnetic energy is in equipartition with the kinetic energy in the jets, leading to large
magnetic field intensities. In this context, Reynoso et al [40] find that pions and muons pro-
duced close to the compact object can be strongly affected by synchrotron losses, decreasing
significantly the expected high-energy neutrino flux. However, in high-mass microquasars,
where the companion star present a strong wind, the interaction of energetic protons in the
jet with matter of dense clumps of the wind could produce detectable neutrino fluxes [40],
but still below the current sensitivity of ANTARES (see figure 11 of [40]).

Furthermore, Bednarek [41] considers a binary system composed of a compact object
orbiting a Wolf-Rayet star, in which nuclei accelerated in the jet efficiently lose neutrons
as a result of photo-disintegration process. Consequently, they claims that these neutrons
can produce neutrinos in collisions with matter from the accretion disk and/or the massive
companion star[41]. However, this model principally applies to Cyg X-3 which is not covered
in the present analysis.

Recently, it was shown that the non-thermal emission of Cyg X-1 can be explained by a
static corona model which is supported by magnetic pressure, and does not imply the presence
of a relativistic outflow [42]. Upon this model, the neutrino emission driven by the injection of
relativistic particles into that strongly magnetized corona was studied [16]. Their predictions
are shown in Figure 4 and compared to the ANTARES upper limits. Unfortunately, the
location of Cyg X-1 in the Northern hemisphere, does not enable to further constrain this

the expectations [16] for the microquasar Cyg X-1 at different times after the rise of the neutrino
flare.

U.L. imposed by ANTARES allow to constrain the most favorable hadronic models for
microquasars. Hereafter, the neutrino energy flux predictions, Fpred, has been computed for
seven microquasars according to the photohadronic model [12], based on a previous work
Levinson & Waxman [11]. Since they are less stringent, the energy flux upper limits of the
transition states are not discussed in the following. Thus, in the following, only the neutrino
energy flux upper limits related to the hard state periods are considered. Using the latest
measurements of their distance and of the jet parameters, the model predicts the neutrino
energy flux based on the radio luminosity of the jets observed in radio during flares. The
derived neutrino energy flux depends on the fraction of jet kinetic energy, Ljet, converted
respectively to relativistic electrons and magnetic field, ηe, and protons ηp, and the fraction
of proton energy converted into pions, fπ, which depends in turn on the energy to which
protons are accelerated. Resolved and unresolved sources are considered separately. In the
following, resolved sources refer to microquasar jets resolved by radio interferometry which
enables the physical parameters of the jet to be probed (Table 5).

For resolved sources, the neutrino energy flux is estimated from the radio flux density,

– 11 –



Sf , at frequency f , the distance of the source, d, the size of the emitting region, l, the jet
Lorentz factor, Γ, the jet velocity, β, the angle, θ, between the line of sight and the jet,
and the jet opening angle, ψ. The ratio of the minimum and maximum electron Lorentz
factors, respectively γmin and γmax, is assumed to be equal to 100, while ψ is taken equal to
a conservative value of 20◦ except in the case of Cyg X-1 [43]. All the other parameters have
been retrieved from the literature and are listed in Table 5 along with their uncertainties and
references. When θ is not observationally constrained, all the values between 0 and 90◦ are
considered. Similarly, if the bulk Lorentz factor, Γ, of the jet is poorly known, all the potential
values are tested. These uncertainties, together with the error on the other jet parameters,
are taken into account to derive the range of neutrino energy fluxes Fpred satisfying the model
which is linearly dependent on ηe/ηp.

The resulting predictions are compared with the upper limits obtained with ANTARES
data under the hypothesis of a cutoff at 100 TeV in the neutrino flux, to account for limits
in the acceleration process included in the model [12]. As an example, Fig. 5 shows how the
predicted flux compares with this result as a function of the jet parameter β for resolved
microquasars Cyg X-1, Cir X-1 and MAXI J1659-152 5. Comparing the predicted flux and
the ANTARES neutrino energy flux upper limits, upper limits at 90% C.L. on ηp/ηe are set.
These limits have been derived taking into account the discrepancy between Lorentz factors
reported in radio observations, and uncertainties on the opening angle of the jet, the distance
of the source, and on the inclination angle between the line of sight and the jet. Results are
given for Cyg X-1, Cir X-1 and MAXI J1659-152 in Fig. 5 and in Table 5.

However, the potential variability of the Lorentz factor during a burst and between
the periods of activity of the source are not taken into account in this calculation. Thus,
constraints on baryon loading may have different implications: the proton component in the
jet can be negligible in comparison with the electromagnetic component, the proton energy
fraction converted to pions can be less significant than the values considered [12], and/or the
jet Lorentz factor is lower than the constraints set by radio observations.

For unresolved sources, the jet kinetic power is evaluated from the jet synchrotron lumi-
nosity derived from the flux density, Sfbreak , at the frequency break, fbreak, between optically
thick and optically thin radio emission, and the spectral index, αR [12]. These values are
reported in Table 6. When no spectral index value is provided in the literature, αR = 0 is
assumed as given by the standard jet radio emission theory [44]. Again, the neutrino energy
flux is linearly dependent on fπ and ηe/ηp. The predicted neutrino energy flux ηe/ηpFpred and
the upper limits on ηp/ηe are given in Table 6. The results for both resolved and unresolved
sources are summarised in Figure 6.

In [45], the authors have provided a calculation of the high-energy neutrino emission
from GX339-4 in the hypothesis that the primary spectrum of the injected particles in the
jets has spectral indexes −1.8 > α > −2.0 and that the ratio between proton and electron
energy is equal to 1 and 100 (Figure 7). The model with a ratio ηp/ηe equal to 100 is excluded
by the present limit.

5The energy flux upper limit obtained for H 1743-322 is around 2 orders of magnitude higher than the
expectations [12]. Thus, this source is not included in Fig. 5.

5.3 Discussion on the case of X-ray binaries without relativistic jet

As stated in Section 3, a large part of the known sample of galactic X-ray binaries does
not exhibit relativistic jets but neutrino production may take place though. For example,
significant potential drops can develop into the magnetosphere of an accreting neutron star
as the one hosted by 1A 0535+26. Protons, accelerated in these gaps to energies greater than
100 TeV, can impact onto the accretion disk, finally producing high-energy neutrinos under
specific conditions of disk density [33]. As seen in Figure 8, the current upper limits do not
enable to challenge this model which predicts a very low neutrino flux above 1 TeV.

Furthermore, Bednarek [47] has considered a photo-hadronic emission model in which
hadrons are accelerated within the inner pulsar rotating magnetosphere. Hadrons conse-
quently produce gamma-rays and neutrinos in collision with thermal radiation from hot spots
on the neutron star surface. Although ANTARES cannot confirm this model yet, it might be
constrained by kilometer-scale detectors such as KM3NeT [48].

plied to a list of 33 XRB sources, 8 of them during hardness transition periods. The search did
not result in a statistically significant excess above the expected background from atmospheric
neutrino and muon events. The most significant correlation during X-ray flares is found for
the source GX1+4, for which 3 neutrino candidate events were detected in time/spatial co-
incidence with X-ray emission. However, the post-trial probability is 72%, thus compatible
with background fluctuations. A comparison with predictions from several models shows that
for some sources, the upper limits start to constrain the parameter space of the expectations
from hadronic jet emission models. Therefore, with additional data from ANTARES and with
the order of magnitude sensitivity improvement expected from the next generation neutrino
telescope, KM3NeT [48], the prospects for future searches for neutrino emission from X-ray
binaries are very promising.
