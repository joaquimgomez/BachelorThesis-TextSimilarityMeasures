Abstract
The main objectives of the KM3NeT Collaboration are (i) the discovery and
subsequent observation of high-energy neutrino sources in the Universe and
(ii) the determination of the mass hierarchy of neutrinos. These objectives are
strongly motivated by two recent important discoveries, namely: (1) the high-
energy astrophysical neutrino signal reported by IceCube and (2) the sizable
contribution of electron neutrinos to the third neutrino mass eigenstate as
reported by Daya Bay, Reno and others. To meet these objectives, the
KM3NeT Collaboration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure con-
sisting of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean Sea.
A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the
access to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the syner-
gistic opportunities for the Earth and sea sciences community. Three suitable
deep-sea sites are selected, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo Passero
(Sicily, Italy) and Pylos (Peloponnese, Greece). The infrastructure will consist
of three so-called building blocks. A building block comprises 115 strings,
each string comprises 18 optical modules and each optical module comprises
31 photo-multiplier tubes. Each building block thus constitutes a three-
dimensional array of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov
light produced by relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions.
Two building blocks will be sparsely configured to fully explore the IceCube
signal with similar instrumented volume, different methodology, improved
resolution and complementary field of view, including the galactic plane. One
building block will be densely configured to precisely measure atmospheric
neutrino oscillations.

1. Executive summary

The main objectives of the KM3NeT53 Collaboration are (i) the discovery and subsequent
observation of high-energy neutrino sources in the Universe and (ii) the determination of the
mass hierarchy of neutrinos. These objectives are strongly motivated by two recent important
discoveries, namely: (1) the high-energy astrophysical neutrino signal reported by IceCube
and (2) the sizeable contribution of electron neutrinos to the third neutrino mass eigenstate as
reported by Daya Bay, Reno and others. To meet these objectives, the KM3NeT Colla-
boration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure consisting of a network of deep-sea
neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean Sea. A phased and distributed implementation is
pursued which maximises the access to regional funds, the availability of human resources
and the synergistic opportunities for the Earth and sea sciences community. Three deep-sea
sites are selected for the optical properties of the water, distance to shore and local infra-
structure, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo Passero (Sicily, Italy) and Pylos (Pelo-
ponnese, Greece).

The infrastructure will consist of three so-called building blocks. A building block
comprises 115strings, each string comprises 18 optical modules and each optical module
comprises 31photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs). Each building block thus constitutes a three-
dimensional array of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov light produced by
relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions. Two building blocks will be spar-
sely configured to fully explore the IceCube signal with comparable instrumented volume,
different methodology, improved resolution and complementary field of view, including the
galactic plane (GP). Collectively, these building blocks are referred to as ARCA: Astro-
particle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss. One building block will be densely configured
to precisely measure atmospheric neutrino oscillations. This building block is referred to as
ORCA: Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss. ARCA will be realised at the Capo
Passero site and ORCA at the Toulon site. Due to KM3NeT’s flexible design, the technical
implementation of ARCA and ORCA is almost identical. The deep-sea sites are linked to
shore with a network of cables for electrical power and high-bandwidth data communication.
On site, shore stations are equipped to provide power, computing and a high-bandwidth
internet connection to the data repositories. The readout of the detectors is based on the ‘All-
data-to-shore’ concept, pioneered in ANTARES. The overall design allows for a flexible and
cost-effective implementation of the Research Infrastructure and its low-cost operation. The
costs remaining to realise ARCA and ORCA amount to €95M. The operational costs are
estimated at about €2Mper year, equivalent to less than 2% of the total investment costs.

The whole project is organised in a single Collaboration with a central management and
common data analysis and repository centres. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for
the first phase (Phase-1), covering the currently available budget of about €31M, has been
signed by the representatives of the corresponding funding agencies. During Phase-1, the
technical design has been validated through in situ prototypes; data analysis tools have been
developed; assembly sites for the production of optical modules and strings have been setup;

and deployment and connection of strings in the deep sea are being optimised for speed and
reliability. During the next phase (Phase-2.0), the Collaboration will complete the
construction of ARCA and ORCA by 2020. The ultimate goal is to fully develop the
KM3NeT Research Infrastructure to comprise a distributed installation at the three foreseen
sites (Phase-3) and operate it for ten years or more. The phased implementation of the
KM3NeT Research Infrastructure is summarised in table 1. The Collaboration aspires to
establish a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) hosted in The Netherlands.

The first part of this document focuses on the technical design of the infrastructure. As a
preview to the science objectives presented later in this document, figure 1 shows the sig-
nificance as a function of time for the detection of a diffuse, flavour-symmetric neutrino flux
corresponding to the result reported by IceCube. Thanks to the purity of the event sample, a
high-significance detection of this neutrino flux will be possible for both track-like and
cascade-like events within one year of operation. The excellent angular and energy resolu-
tions, combined with the large effective mass, provide for a significant discovery potential to
find neutrino sources in the Universe. Figure 2 shows the significance as a function of
observation time for the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy (NMH). A determi-
nation of the NMH with at least 3-sigma significance can be made after three years of
operation, i.e. as early as 2023. This precedes results of other experiments and provides timely
input for experiments aiming at a measurement of the CP-violation phase with high sensi-
tivity. In addition, ORCA will provide improved measurements of some of the neutrino
oscillation parameters.

2. Detector design and technology

The successful deployment and operation of the ANTARES neutrino telescope [1] has
demonstrated the feasibility of performing neutrino studies with large volume detectors in the
deep sea. The detection of neutrinos is based on the detection of Cherenkov light produced by
relativistic particles emerging from a neutrino interaction. The same technology can be used
for studying neutrinos from GeV (for KM3NeT/ORCA) to PeV energies and above (for
KM3NeT/ARCA).

Figure 1. Significance as a function of time for the detection of a diffuse flux of
neutrinos corresponding to the signal reported by IceCube, for cascade-like events (red
line) and track-like events (black line). The black and red bands represent the
uncertainties due to the conventional and prompt component of the atmospheric
neutrino flux, respectively. The blue line indicates the result of the combined analysis.

The goal of the KM3NeT technology is to instrument, at minimal cost and maximal
reliability, the largest possible volume of seawater with a three-dimensional spatial grid of
ultra-sensitive photo-sensors, while remaining sensitive to neutrino interactions in the target
energy range. The KM3NeT design builds upon the ANTARES experience and improves the
cost effectiveness of its design by about a factor four. All components are designed for at least
ten years of operation with negligible loss of efficiency. The system should provide nano-
second precision on the arrival time of single photons, while the position and orientation of
the photo-sensors must be known to a few centimetres and few degrees, respectively. The
photo-sensors and the readout electronics are hosted within pressure-resistant glass spheres,
so called digital optical modules (DOMs). The DOMs are distributed in space along flexible
strings, one end of which is fixed to the sea floor and the other end is held close to vertical by

a submerged buoy. The concept of strings is modular by design. The construction and
operation of the research infrastructure thus allows for a phased and distributed
implementation.

A collection of 115 strings forms a single KM3NeT building block. The modular design
allows building blocks with different spacings between lines/DOMs to be constructed, in
order to target different neutrino energies. The full KM3NeT telescope comprises seven
building blocks distributed on three sites. For Phase-2.0, three building blocks are planned:
two KM3NeT/ARCA blocks, with a large spacing to target astrophysical neutrinos at TeV
energies and above; and one KM3NeT/ORCA block, to target atmospheric neutrinos in the
few-GeV range.

Figure 3 indicates the location of the KM3NeT deep sea sites and the location of the
various institutes which are currently involved in the PMT testing, the DOM integration, the
string integration and the deployment of strings for KM3NeT Phase-1.

2.1. KM3NeT/ARCA: deep sea and onshore infrastructures

The KM3NeT-Italy infrastructure is located at 36 16’ N 16 06’ E at a depth of 3500 m,
about 100 km offshore from Porto Palo di Capo Passero, Sicily, Italy (figure 4, left). The site
is the former NEMO site and is shared with the EMSO facility for Earth and Sea science
research.

The ARCA installation comprises two KM3NeT building blocks. Figure 4 right illus-
trates the layout. The power/data are transferred to/from the infrastructure via two main
electro-optic cables. In addition to the already operating cable serving the Phase-1 detector a
new cable will be installed. This Phase-2 cable will comprise 48 optical fibres. Close to the
underwater installation the cable is split by means of a Branching Unit (BU) in two branches,

each one terminated with a cable termination frame (CTF) (figure 5, left). Each CTF is
connected to secondary junction boxes, 12 for the ARCA block 1 and 16 for the ARCA
block 2. Each secondary junction box allows the connection of up to 7 KM3NeT detection
strings. The underwater connection of the strings to the junction boxes is via interlink cables
running along the seabed. For the ARCA configuration, the average horizontal spacing
between detection strings is about 95 m. On-shore each main electro-optic cable is connected
to a power feeding equipment located in the shore station at Porto Palo di Capo Passero.
Power is transferred at 10 kVDC and is converted to 375 VDC at the CTF for transmission,
via the secondary junction boxes, along the interlink cables to the strings. The shore station
also hosts the data acquisition electronics and a commodity PC farm used for data filtering.

In December 2008, the first main electro-optic cable was deployed. A CTF and two
secondary junction boxes were successfully connected in summer 2015.

2.2. KM3NeT/ORCA: deep sea and onshore infrastructures

The KM3NeT-France infrastructure is located at 42 48’N 06 02’ E at a depth of 2450 m,
about 40 km offshore from Toulon, France (see figure 6, left). The site is outside of the French
territorial waters and about 10 km west of the site of the existing ANTARES telescope.

Figure 6 right illustrates the layout of the full ORCA array; a single KM3NeT building
block of 115 strings. The power/data are transferred to/from the infrastructure via two main
electro-optic cables comprising 36/48 optical fibres and a single power conductor (the return
is via the sea).

The strings are connected to five junction boxes (figure 7, left), located on the periphery
of the array. Each junction box has eight connectors, each of which can power four strings
daisy chained in series (figure 7, right). Some daisy chains include calibration units, which
incorporate laser beacons and/or hydrophone acoustic emitters. In the baseline design, five
connectors on the junction box are dedicated for the neutrino array and one is dedicated for
Earth and Sea science sensors and two are spares. The underwater connection of the strings to
the junction box is via interlink cables running along the seabed. For the ORCA configura-
tion, the average horizontal spacing between detection strings is about 20 m.

Due to the shorter transmission distance involved in the ORCA configuration power is
transferred in alternating current (AC). The power station, dimensioned for a single building
block (92 KVA) is located at the shore end of the main cable near the ‘Les Sablettes’ beach.

Power is transferred at 3500 VAC The offshore junction boxes use a AC transformer to
convert this to 400 VAC for transmission along the interlink cables to the strings. The control
room is located at the Institute Michel Pacha, La Seyne-sur-Mer, and hosts the data acqui-
sition electronics and a commodity PC farm used for data filtering.

In December 2014, the first main electro-optic cable was successfully deployed by
Orange Marine. Once ANTARES is decommissioned, its main electro-optic cable will be
reused for ORCA. The first junction box was connected in spring 2015.

2.3. Detection string

The detection strings [2] (figure 8) each host 18 DOMs. For KM3NeT/ARCA, each is about
700 m in height, with DOMs spaced 36 m apart in the vertical direction, starting about 80 m
from the sea floor. For KM3NeT/ORCA, each string is 200 m in height with DOMs spaced
9 m apart in the vertical direction, starting about 40 m from the sea floor. Each string com-
prises two thin (4 mm diameter) parallel Dyneema® ropes to which the DOMs are attached
via a titanium collar. Additional spacers are added in between the DOMs to maintain the

ropes parallel. Attached to the ropes is the vertical electro-optical cable, a pressure balanced,
oil-filled, plastic tube that contains two copper wires for the power transmission (400 VDC)
and 18 optical fibres for the data transmission. At each storey two power conductors and a
single fibre are branched out via the breakout box. The breakout box also contains a DC/DC
converter (400–12 V). The power conductors and optical fibre enter the glass sphere via a
penetrator.

Even though the string design minimises drag and itself is buoyant, additional buoyancy
is introduced at the top of the string to reduce the horizontal displacement of the top relative to
the base for the case of large sea currents.

For deployment and storage, the string is coiled around a large spherical frame, the so-
called launcher vehicle, in which the DOMs slot into dedicated cavities (see figure 9). The
anchor at the bottom of the string is the interface with the seabed infrastructure. It is external

to the launcher vehicle and is sufficiently heavy to keep the string fixed on the seabed. The
anchor houses an interlink cable, equipped with a wet-mateable connectors, and the base
container. The base container incorporates dedicated optical components and an acoustic
receiver used for positioning of the detector elements.

A surface vessel (figures 10 (left) and 11 (left)), with dynamic positioning capability, is
used at each site to deploy the launcher vehicle at its designated position on the seabed with
an accuracy of 1 m. A remotely operated vehicle (figures 10 and 11, right) is used to deploy
and connect the interlink cables from the base of a string to the junction box. Once the
connection to the string has been verified onshore, an acoustic signal from the boat triggers
the unfurling of the string. During this process, the launcher vehicle starts to rise to the surface
while slowly rotating and releasing the DOMs. The empty launcher vehicle floats to the
surface and is recovered by the surface vessel. The use of compact strings allows for trans-
portation of many units on board and thus multiple deployments during a single cruise. This
method reduces costs and also has advantages in terms of risk reduction for ship personnel
and material during the deployment. It also improves tolerance to rough sea conditions.

In May 2014, a prototype string comprising three active DOMs was successfully
deployed and connected to the KM3NeT-Italy site and operated for more than one year [3].
This test deployment validated many aspects of the deployment scheme. The first ORCA-
style string will be connected to KM3NeT-France infrastructure spring 2016.

2.4. Digital optical module

The DOM [4] (figure 12 left) is a transparent 17 inch diameter glass sphere comprising two
separate hemispheres, housing 31 PMT and their associated readout electronics. The design of
the DOM has several advantages over traditional optical modules using single large PMTs, as
it houses three to four times the photo-cathode area in a single sphere and has an almost
uniform angular coverage. As the photo-cathode is segmented, the identification of more than
one photon arriving at the DOM can be done with high efficiency and purity. In addition, the
directional information provides improved rejection of optical background.

is the acoustic piezo sensor (left). Exploded view of the inside of a DOM (right).

14



The PMTs are arranged in five rings of six PMTs plus a single PMT at the bottom
pointing vertically downwards. The PMTs are spaced at 60° in azimuth and successive rings
are staggered by 30°. There are 19PMTs in the lower hemisphere and 12 PMTs in the upper
hemisphere. The PMTs are held in place by a 3D printed support. The photon collection
efficiency is increased by 20%–40% by a reflector ring around the face of each PMT. In order
to assure optical contact, an optical gel fills the cavity between the support and the glass. The
support and the gel are sufficiently flexible to allow for the deformation of the glass sphere
under the hydrostatic pressure.

Each PMT has an individual low-power high-voltage base with integrated amplification
and tuneable discrimination. The arrival time and the time-over-threshold (ToT) of each PMT,
are recorded by an individual time-to-digital converter implemented in a FPGA. The
threshold is set at the level of 0.3 of the mean single photon pulse height and the high voltage
is set to provide an amplification of 3×106. The FPGA is mounted on the central logic
board, which transfers the data to shore via an Ethernet network of optical fibres. Each DOM
in a string has a dedicated wavelength to be later multiplexed with other DOM wavelengths
for transfer via a single optical fibre to the shore. The broadcast of the onshore clock signal,
needed for time stamping in each DOM, is embedded in the Gb Ethernet protocol. The White
Rabbit protocol has been modified to implement the broadcast of the clock signal. The power
consumption of a single DOM is about 7W.

The specification for the PMTs are summarised in table 2. Prototype PMTs from
Hamamatsu and ETEL have been developed and satisfy the requirements (see figure 13). The
PMTs have a photo-cathode diameter of at least 72 mm and a length of less than 122 mm. The

reflector effectively increases the diameter to about 85 mm. The PMT has a ten-stage dynode
structure with a minimum gain of 106. The front face of the PMT is convex with a radius
smaller than the inner radius of the glass sphere. Due to the small size of the PMT, the
influence of the Earth’s magnetic field is negligible and a mu-metal shield is not required.

The optical module also contains three calibration sensors: (1) the LED nano-beacon,
which illuminates the optical module(s) vertically above; (2) a compass and tilt-meter for
orientation calibration; (3) an acoustic piezo sensor glued to the inner surface of the glass
sphere for position calibration.

In May 2013, a prototype DOM was successfully installed on an ANTARES detection
line and operated in situ for over a year [5] . Starting in spring 2014, three prototype DOMs
were operated for over a year at the KM3NeT-Italy site [3]. In December 2015, a first
production string of 18 DOMs was successfully operated at the KM3NeT-Italy site.

2.5. Fibre-optic data transmission system

The KM3NeT fibre-optic data transmission system performs the following functions:

• Transfers all the data to shore: the bandwidth per DOM is 1 Gb s−1. The observed singles
rate, dominated by 40K, is typically 6–8 kHz per PMT [3, 5] or 190–250 kHz per DOM,
which amounts to 9–12Mb s−1 per DOM. Additional contributions from biolumines-
cence can be accommodated up to levels of a factor of 10 compared to 40K.

• Provide timing synchronisation: relative time offsets between any pair of DOMs are
stable within 1 ns.

• Provide individual control for each DOM: setting the HV of a PMT, turn off/on a single
PMT, turn on/off nano-beacon, update soft- and firmware.

• Provide individual control for each base of a string: turn string power on/off, control
optical amplifiers, monitor AC/DC converter.

• Provide slow control for the junction boxes.

The slow-control system is implemented via a broadcast mechanism (same as that of the
clock), in which control information for all strings is sent on a single common wavelength. If
it is a message for just a single string or DOM it is ignored by all the others. The commu-
nication from offshore exploit a dense wavelength division multiplexing technique. The
return signals for the slow control are transmitted on 34 wavelengths via the slow-control
fibre(s). The data return path is based on a 50 GHz spacing system with a 72 wavelengths
uplink. Each DOM of four strings produces a unique wavelength that is combined on one
fibre. EDFA optical amplifiers are introduced onshore and at the base of a string to maintain
the optical margins above 10 dB.

2.6. Data acquisition

The readout [6] of the KM3NeT detector is based on the ‘all-data-to-shore’ concept in which
all analogue signals from the PMTs that pass a preset threshold (typically 0.3 photo-electrons)
are digitised and all digital data are sent to shore where they are processed in real time. The
physics events are filtered from the background using designated software. To maintain all
available information for the offline analyses, each event will contain a snapshot of all the
data in the detector during the event. Different filters can be applied to the data
simultaneously.

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

16



The optical data contain the time of the leading edge and the ToT of every analogue
pulse, commonly referred to as a hit. Each hit corresponds to 6 B of data (1 B for PMT
address, 4 B for time and 1 B for ToT). The least significant bit of the time information
corresponds to 1 ns. The total data rate for a single building block amounts to about
25 Gb s−1. A reduction of the data rate by a factor of about 105 is thus required to store the
filtered data on disk. In addition to physics data, summary data containing the singles rates of
all PMTs in the detector are stored with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz. This information is
used in the simulations and the reconstruction to take into account the actual status and optical
background conditions of the detector.

In parallel to the optical data, the data from the acoustics positioning system are pro-
cessed and represents a data volume of about one third of that of the optical data.

2.6.1. Event trigger. For the detection of muons and showers, the time-position correlations
that are used to filter the data follow from causality. In the following, the level-zero filter (L0)
refers to the threshold for the analogue pulses which is applied off shore. All other filtering is
applied on shore. The level-one filter (L1) refers to a coincidence of two (or more) L0 hits
from different PMTs in the same optical module within a fixed time window. The scattering
of light in deep-sea water is such that the time window can be very small. A typical value is
D =T 10 ns. The estimated L1 rate per optical module is then about 1000 Hz, of which about
600 Hz is due to genuine coincidences from 40K decays. The remaining part arises from
random coincidences which can be reduced by a factor of two by making use of the known
orientations of the PMTs. This is referred to as the level-two filter (L2). Separate trigger
algorithms operate in parallel on this data, each optimised for a different event topology.

A general solution to trigger on a muon track event consists of a scan of the sky
combined with a directional filter [7]. In the directional filter, the direction of the muon is
assumed. For each direction, an intersection of a cylinder with the 3D array of optical
modules can be considered. The diameter of this cylinder (i.e. road width) corresponds to the
maximal distance traveled by the light. It can safely be set to a few times the absorption length
without a significant loss of the signal. The number of PMTs to be considered is then reduced
by a factor of 100 or more, depending on the assumed direction. Furthermore, the time
window that follows from causality is reduced by a similar factor54. This improves the signal-
to-noise ratio (S/N) of an L1 hit by a factor of (at least) 104 compared to the general causality
relation. With a requirement of five (or more) L1 hits, this filter shows a very small
contribution of random coincidences.

The field of view of the directional filter is about 10°. So, a set of 200 directions is
sufficient to cover the full sky. By design, this trigger can be applied to any detector
configuration. Furthermore, the minimum number of L1 hits to trigger an event can be
lowered for a limited number of directions. A set of astrophysical sources can thus be tracked
continuously with higher detection efficiency for each source.

For shower events, triggering is simpler, since the maximal 3D-distance between PMTs
can be applied without consideration of the direction of the shower.

A maximum distance traveled by the light can be assumed, limiting the maximum
distance D between hit PMTs. This reduces the number of PMTs to be considered and the
time window that follows from causality. Hence, an improvement of the S/N ratio compared
to the general causality relation can be obtained.

54
Only the transverse distance between the PMTs should be taken into account because the propagation time of the

muon can be corrected for.

17



Alternative signals with different time-position correlations, such as slow magnetic
monopoles, can be searched for in parallel. It is obvious but worth noting that the number of
computers and the speed of the algorithms determine the performance of the system and
hence the physics output of KM3NeT.

2.6.2. Performance. The performance of the online data filter can be summarised by the
effective volume, the event purity and the time needed to process a time slice of raw data. The
effective volume is the volume in which a neutrino interaction would trigger the event to be
written to disk and the event purity is the fraction of events that contain a neutrino interaction
or atmospheric muon bundle. The effective volume of the ARCA and ORCA detectors are
presented in section 3.2 and 4.2.2, respectively.

To process the data, the concept of time slicing is applied. In this, the data from each
optical module are stored in a frame corresponding to a preset time period. All data frames
corresponding to the same time period are sent to a single CPU core based on IP level 2
switching. A complete set of data frames is referred to as a time slice. Data corresponding to
subsequent time periods are sent to different CPU cores until the number of available CPU
cores is exhausted. The first CPU core should then be ready to receive and process the data
from the next time period.

In the following, the performance of the online data filter is presented for one ARCA and
one ORCA building block. In this, different triggers are operated in parallel. The typical
trigger settings correspond to a L1 time window of D =T 10 ns, a maximum space angle
between the PMT axes of 90°(L2), and a minimum number of L1 hits of 4 or 5. The detection
threshold thus corresponds to 8 or 10 photons. The trigger rate due to random coincidences
and the number of CPU cores are shown in figure 14 as a function of the singles rate.

The typical singles rate due to radioactive decays in the sea water is about 6–8 kHz per
PMT [3, 5], including the dark count rate. In addition, there are occasional bursts of
bioluminescence. To limit the effect of excursions of the singles rate, short bursts of
bioluminescence can be filtered in real-time. The probability of the occurrence of
bioluminescent bursts depends on the site and is found to be correlated with the velocity

Figure 14. Trigger rate due to random coincidences (left) and required number of CPU
cores (right) as a function of the singles rate for one building block of ARCA (black
circles) and ORCA (red squares).

18



of the sea current [8, 9] presumably due to the influence of bioluminescent organisms induced
by turbulence or impacts on the infrastructure. An enhanced level of bioluminescence has
been observed in the ANTARES detector during the spring period of some years [9].
Averaged over the live time of the ANTARES detector, the overall inefficiency due to
bioluminescence is about 10%. Due to the slender design of KM3NeT, it is expected that the
turbulence and impacts on the infrastructure are significantly less and so is this inefficiency.

As can be seen from figure 14, the number of CPU cores needed to process the data in
real time is less than 50 up to singles rates of 20 kHz (three times the nominal rate). It should
be noted that the number of CPU cores may be larger than one for a modern PC. So, this
result provides for a cost-effective implementation of the ‘all-data-to-shore’ concept.
Moreover, the trigger software is the same for the ARCA and ORCA detectors; only the
settings of the trigger parameters are adjusted to optimally detect neutrinos with the targeted
energies.

3. Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss

3.1. Introduction

The main science objective of KM3NeT/ARCA is the detection of high-energy neutrinos of
cosmic origin. Since neutrinos propagate directly from their sources to the Earth, even modest
numbers of detected neutrinos can be of utmost scientific relevance, by indicating the
astrophysical objects in which cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated, or pointing to places where
dark matter particles annihilate or decay. The prospect of such fundamental physics dis-
coveries have led the astroparticle and astrophysics communities to include KM3NeT as a
high priority in their respective European road maps (APPEC/ASPERA, AstroNet) and the
European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) to include it in their list of
priority projects. The KM3NeT Research Infrastructure will also provide user ports for real-
time, long-term Earth and Sea science measurements in the deep-sea environment.

One priority goal of KM3NeT/ARCA is indisputably to find neutrinos from the CR
accelerators in our Galaxy. In a neutrino telescope the two simplest event topologies that can
be identified are: a ‘shower’ topology that includes the NC interaction of all three neutrino
flavours, the CC interaction of ne, and a subset of nt interactions; and a ‘track’ topology that
indicates the presence of muons produced in nm and nt CC interactions (see section 3.2.4 for a
detailed explanation).

The preferred search strategy is to identify upward-moving muons, which unambigu-
ously indicates neutrino reactions since only neutrinos can traverse the Earth without being
absorbed. A neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea is ideal for this purpose, since most
of the potential Galactic sources are in the Southern sky; in contrast, the IceCube detector at
the South Pole is much less sensitive to these individual sources, at least in the energy range
where the signal is expected (a few TeV to a few tens of 10 TeV—see section 3.3.6). The
KM3NeT/ARCA design has been carefully optimised to maximise the sensitivity to these
Galactic sources. One of the findings in this process is that the overall sensitivity is not
reduced if the neutrino telescope is split into separate building blocks, provided they are large
enough, at least 0.5 cubic kilometres each [10]. It has thus been decided to make a distributed
infrastructure, thereby maximising the influx of regional funding and human resources.
Furthermore, the concept of independent building blocks complies with the technical speci-
fications for the construction and operation of the Research Infrastructure.

Currently, the KM3NeT Collaboration is proceeding with the first construction phase
(Phase-1). Until 2017, 31strings equipped with 558 optical modules (see section 2) will be

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

19



assembled and deployed. Of these, 24strings will be configured for ARCA and deployed at
the Italian site. The resulting array will provide the equivalent of 10%–20% of the size of the
IceCube detector. The recent experience from a combined analysis of ANTARES and Ice-
Cube data [11], increasing the sensitivity to point-like neutrino sources by up to a factor of
two with respect to the individual analyses, indicates that Phase-1 will already have a decent
discovery potential and provide significant new data.

3.1.1. Cosmic neutrinos. A new situation has emerged since IceCube has presented evidence
for a neutrino signal of cosmic origin. This signal includes upward- and downward-going
events with neutrino energies from a few 10 TeV to above 1 PeV. Even though the signal is
statistically very significant, its astrophysical implications are not yet clear. This signal is the
first high-energy extra-terrestrial neutrino signal ever observed and thus marks a major
turning point in the history of neutrino astronomy. Detailed studies have been and are being
conducted to estimate the sensitivity of KM3NeT/ARCA to a neutrino flux with the reported
properties, to investigate the consequences of a re-optimisation of the detector for such a
signal (in particular in terms of geometry parameters and building block size) and to evaluate
the prospects of Phase-2.0. Results of these studies are presented in the following.

IceCube’s HESE analysis [12] has now observed 54events with a reconstructed energy
above 30 TeV, 39 of which are identified as cascades and 14 as track events [13]55. Most of
the observed events originate from the Southern hemisphere, corresponding to down-going
neutrinos in the IceCube detector. Due to the different topologies of the events, the angular
resolution is roughly 10°–15° for cascades and 1° for muons. The expected background due
to atmospheric muons and neutrinos is about 12 and 9 events respectively, resulting in a
significance of over s5 for the observation to be incompatible with the background. This
significance has been obtained by applying designated event selection cuts using the outer
layers of the detector as veto against incoming charged particles. The best constraints on an

(assumed diffuse) astrophysical spectrum come from a maximum likelihood analysis using
both HESE and other event samples [14], finding a neutrino flux proportional to -E 2.5,
disfavouring at s2.1 an -E 2 spectrum with a cutoff at a few PeV. The distribution of the
neutrino directions combined with the angular resolution does not (yet) allow for the
identification of one or more point sources. Deviations from flavour-uniformity are only
weakly constrained [15], and tau neutrino events have not yet been identified [16, 17].

The prime physics case for KM3NeT Phase-2.0 ARCA is to measure and investigate the
signal of neutrinos observed by IceCube with different methodology, improved resolution and
a complementary field of view.

3.1.2. Assumptions. The basic assumption in the following studies is that the ARCA
detector will comprise two KM3NeT building blocks, providing an instrumented volume of
about one cubic kilometre, i.e. of similar size as the IceCube detector. All analyses reported in
this document are performed for a horizontal distance between strings of 90 m and vertical
distance between adjacent optical modules of 36 m. The footprint of one block is shown in
figure 15. To estimate the dependence of the sensitivity on the geometrical detector
configuration, an alternative layout with 120 m distance between strings but unchanged
vertical distances is being investigated; this configuration corresponds to an increase of the
instrumented volume to 1.7 km3. In both cases a water depth of 3.5 km and a latitude of

 ¢36 16 N were assumed, corresponding to the Italian KM3NeT site (KM3NeT-It, see
section 2.1).

The following sensitivity studies are discussed in the following:

• Cascade events from a diffuse flux, including high-energy starting muon tracks. This
analysis includes all neutrino flavours. Owing to an efficient suppression of the
atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds (see below), a p4 angular coverage has
been achieved.

• Up-going, diffuse flux of muon (anti-)neutrinos. This analysis is usually referred to as the
‘conventional’ diffuse flux analysis. Traditionally, it does not include the upper
hemisphere, with the exception of a small zenith region above the horizon.

• Muon (anti-)neutrinos from a diffuse GP flux. Up-going muon track events are used for an
analysis covering an extended region of the GP near the Galactic centre in the
Southern sky.

• Up-going flux of muon (anti-)neutrinos from point sources. In order to quantify the
sensitivity of KM3NeT Phase-2.0 to extragalactic and Galactic point sources of neutrinos,
both a generic -E 2 spectrum from point sources and spectra with energy cut-off for
specific Galactic sources with non-zero radial extension have been considered.

• Cascade events from point sources. KM3NeT/ARCA’s resolution in the cascade channel
will allow us to use these events in point-source searches. The sensitivity of such an
analysis is evaluated against generic -E 2 point-sources.

The background of atmospheric neutrinos assumed in these analyses corresponds to the
so-called Honda flux [18] with a prompt component as calculated by Enberg [19]. A
correction taking into account the ‘knee’ of the CR spectrum has been applied to both
conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrino fluxes according to the prescription in [20] and
references therein. The Honda parameterisation includes an anisotropy caused by the Earth’s
magnetic field, while the prompt component is assumed to be isotropic in the full solid angle.
Moreover, in the sensitivity studies the effect of the uncertainties on the atmospheric neutrino
flux has been estimated. An uncertainty of ±25% was assumed for the intensity of the

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

21



conventional Honda flux. For the prompt component, the uncertainty band estimated in [19]
has been used.

Recently, new calculations of the prompt neutrino component have been reported in [21–
23]. The calculation of [23] followed that in [22], from which it differs mainly in the use of
different input, in particular the parton distributions functions (PDFs). The PDFs in [23] were
further constrained by taking into account LHCb measurements at 7 TeV.

In figure 16 the different components of the atmospheric neutrino flux are reported for ne
and nm; see section 3.2 for details on the background from atmospheric muons.

It should be noted that the results reported in the following are preliminary and some
analysis details are not yet fully completed and optimised. Also, the analyses reported above
do not reflect the full physics potential of ARCA; the event resolutions shown in section 3.2.4
can be used to characterise ARCA’s ability to probe any assumed extraterrestrial neutrino
fluxes.

3.2. Simulations

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been used to simulate the detector response to particles
incident on the detector, their interaction with the medium surrounding the detector and
subsequent Cherenkov light production, and the detector response in terms of the PMT data
sent to shore. The software packages described in this section have mostly been developed in
the ANTARES Collaboration and then adapted to KM3NeT. The simulation is based on the
nominal detector geometry described in section 3.1.2 and figure 15—see section 2.1 for
further details. Each of the two ARCA blocks are treated identically and independently—
simulations are performed for a single block, and the effective lifetime (event rate) is mul-
tiplied by two. The effects of position and orientation calibration uncertainties are estimated
using dedicated simulations, as described in section 3.4.

3.2.1. Event generation. The relevant volume for Cherenkov light production is defined as a
cylinder with height and radius of about 3 absorption lengths larger than the instrumented

volume (the ‘can’), limited by the seabed below. The first step in the simulation chain is the
generation of particle fluxes incident on the can—neutrinos from astrophysical sources, and
the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds—within which a detailed description of
particle behaviour and Cherenkov light production is required.

Astrophysical and atmospheric fluxes of (anti-)neutrinos of all three flavours (ne, nm, and
nt) are simulated with a code propagating neutrinos through the Earth (density profile from
[24]) and generating their interactions in rock and sea water. For reactions outside the can,
long-range interaction products (muons and taus) are subsequently propagated to the can.
Both neutral-current (NC) and charged-current (CC) reactions are simulated. The deep
inelastic scattering (DIS) cross-sections, which are dominant in the energy range relevant to
this study, are implemented using the LEPTO code [25]. The CTEQ6D table of parton
distribution functions is used, and the resulting behaviour—especially in the small-x region—
validated up to 10PeV. Quasi-elastic scattering and resonance production are also taken into
account, by using RSQ [26] below 300 GeV. Reactions of ne with electrons in the atmosphere
are relevant in the energy regime of resonant W production (‘Glashow resonance’) around
6.3 PeV and are simulated according to the leading-order electroweak cross sections. The
propagation of muons in rock and water is performed with MUSIC [27]. Tau leptons, which
have a life time of ´ -2.9 10 13 s and thus typically travel only very short distances before
decaying, are propagated by assuming them to be minimally ionising particles, and decayed
using TAUOLA [28].

Atmospheric muons, produced in CR interactions in the atmosphere, can penetrate to the
detector volume if their energy at the sea surface is in the TeV range or above. This is
frequently the case, both for single muons, and muon ‘bundles’ up to several hundred muons
from a primary CR event. Atmospheric muons therefore establish an important, high-rate
background that is simulated using MUPAGE [29, 170]. Single and multiple atmospheric
muon events are generated using a parameterisation of the flux of muon bundles at different

(track-like), for both the IceCube diffuse flux [14] and atmospheric spectra;
atmospheric μ events; and cosmic ray (CR) events from CORSIKA, as a function of
neutrino/muon-bundle/cosmic-ray energy E. The lifetimes for other neutrino channels
(ne and nt) are similar to that of nm NC, except for the atmospheric nt events, which
have effectively infinite lifetime (since the estimated flux is very small).

depths and zenith angles. In the present analysis, three simulated atmospheric muon event
samples are used, with muon bundle energies exceeding 1 TeV, 10 TeV, and 50 TeV,
respectively, in order to provide sufficient coverage in the high-energy regime. The
corresponding lifetimes of these and the neutrino productions are shown in figure 17.

The correlated flux of atmospheric neutrinos and muons from the same primary CR
interaction is simulated with CORSIKAv7.4001 [30], in order to investigate the ‘self-veto’
effect [31] for high-energy studies. GHEISHA [32] and QGSJET01 [33] were respectively
used to model low- and high-energy hadronic interactions, and the curvature of the Earth was
accounted for. Both muons and neutrinos are recorded at sea-level; muons are propagated to
and through the can with MUSIC, while one neutrino from each event is forced to interact.
The intention was to estimate the effect of accompanying muons on high-energy atmospheric
neutrino events (section 3.2.9)—thus, only events with at least one muon at can level, and one
neutrino above 10 TeV, are kept, which excludes all up-coming neutrino events56. The
resulting event sample forms only a small fraction of all atmospheric muon bundles, but a
significant fraction of all down-going atmospheric neutrino background events above 10 TeV.
Therefore, analyses using CORSIKA events down-weight the standard atmospheric neutrino
events to avoid double-counting. Additionally, CORSIKA underestimates the expected
atmospheric neutrino flux at high energies [18, 19], and this is corrected for as per [34].

3.2.2. Detector response. A quantity often used to characterise the detector response for
neutrino telescopes is the neutrino effective area, Aeff , defined here such that the rate, Rtrig, of
particles being detected at trigger level is equal to the flux of particles through Aeff . Here, Aeff
is calculated as a function of neutrino flavour, ℓ, and energy, nE ℓ, relative to the flux Φ incident
upon the Earth, i.e.:

º
F

For a point-like source, Aeff is calculated relative to the rate Rtrig (s
−1 GeV−1) and flux Φ

(m−2 s−1 GeV−1) from that source, while for a diffuse flux, the solid-angle-integrated values
of Rtrig and Φ are used. Along with the detector efficiency, Aeff also includes the neutrino
cross-section, and the probability for neutrinos to be absorbed in the Earth, resulting in a
smaller value of Aeff than the physical cross-sectional area of the instrument.

The generated particles propagated to the can level, or generated inside the can volume,
are then tracked in the sea water using tabulated results from full GEANT 3.21 simulations of
relativistic muons and electromagnetic cascades to generate the number of Cherenkov
photons detected by the KM3NeT PMTs. The light production from hadronic or mixed
hadronic/electromagnetic cascades is scaled to that from purely electromagnetic cascades
according to the energy and type of constituent particles. The program takes into account the
full wavelength dependence of Cherenkov light production, propagation, scattering and
absorption; and the response of the PMTs as described in section 2 and modelled in [35],
including absorption in the glass and optical gel, the PMT quantum efficiency (QE), the
reduced effective area for photons arriving off-axis, and the effect of the reflecting expansion
cones [36].

Hits from background photons (mostly due to 40K decays in the sea water) in an event are
simulated by adding random noise hits with a rate of 5 kHz per PMT. Correlated hits over
multiple PMTs on the same optical module from single 40K decays are also included, with
2, 3, 4{ }-fold coincidences at rates of 500, 50, 5{ } Hz per DOM. The singles and

Events with only a neutrino or atmospheric muon bundle are already simulated using standard methods.

coincidence rates as well as the angular dependence are in reasonable agreement with the
results from the prototype detection unit (DU) deployed at the KM3NeT-It site [3]. An
example of the simulated time-distribution of photons detected by a KM3NeT PMT from a
1 TeV muon 50 m from the track is given in figure 18.

KM3NeT PMT hits are recorded via the start time and the duration of the signal above a
predefined threshold (ToT). This scheme is implemented in the detector simulation, with the
simulated response of individual PMTs to photon hits being based on laboratory
measurements. The full transit-time distribution is implemented on a per-photon basis,
corresponding approximately to a 2 ns Gaussian smearing for the majority of photons. Hit
amplitudes are smeared, and the start time and ToT are calculated by accounting for
sequences of photo-electrons on PMTs that cannot be resolved in time, saturation effects at
around 40 simultaneous photoelectrons, and a maximum ToT readout of 255 ns. After this
step, each event contains a complete and unbiased snapshot of all hits recorded during a time
window around the event, representing a part of the stream of data sent to shore.

The final stage is to simulate on-shore triggering, as described in section 2.6.1. This
process takes filtered L1 hits (photon hits on multiple PMTs within a short time window on
the same OM) and generates a trigger if multiple nearby OMs record such events at causally
connected times within a spherical (cascade) or cylindrical (track) geometry. Trigger
parameters have been tuned so as to minimise false triggers on optical backgrounds, while
registering all reconstructible physics events. In the case of ARCA, the real-time trigger rate is
dominated by down-going atmospheric muons, and trigger settings were set to keep the
corresponding data rate manageable.

The trigger settings correspond to a coincidence (L1) time window ofD =T 10 ns, and a
minimum number of 5 L1 hits for both the shower trigger and the muon trigger. Only MC
events which pass either trigger condition are available for further analysis, as is the case for
the on-shore trigger. The resulting effective areas are given in figure 19.

shock front) of photoelectrons detected by a KM3NeT PMT from a 1 TeV muon track

(red) and away (blue) from the track. The optical background rate is also shown for
comparison. The PMT response (time-smearing of ∼2 ns) is not included.

Following equation (1) to evaluate the number of detectable events from a specific
neutrino source that maximises the significance (see section 3.3) these effective areas have to
be corrected for the number of events that survive the cuts of the analysis.

The simulation times per event for different stages are shown in figure 20. The simulation
time is dominated by event reconstruction and light propagation, which can reach up to a few
seconds per event at high energies. The cascade reconstruction time does not reduce quickly
at low energies, since it includes in the likelihood fit PMTs which have no detections.

The MC events simulated with the described codes have been compared with the data
from a prototype of the string that was deployed at the Italian site and that took data for about
one year [3]. The very good agreement between the data and the MC simulation have
demonstrated the high reliability of the MC simulation chain.

3.2.3. Further improvements. The simulation chain for ARCA is mature, but not complete,
and several additions will be required for future data analysis. These are:

• The simulation of tau (anti-)neutrinos is performed using some simplifications. CC tau
interactions within the Earth are treated as absorbing the neutrino, i.e. the tau
‘regeneration’ effect is not included. Additionally, only two- and three-body tau decay
modes (approximately three quarters of all decays) are currently implemented—the
branching ratio of ∼17.4% for the decay to a muon is kept constant, while other modes
are re-normalised to the remaining 83.6%, and result in almost identical event topologies
at high energies.

• The MUPAGE package for generation of atmospheric muons does not contain a prompt
component originating from charm decays in CR-induced air showers. The flux of
atmospheric muons with energies above roughly 10 TeV is therefore underestimated,
although likely only by a small amount. A refined simulation has recently been provided
in the CORSIKA [30] framework, where the correlations between conventional and
prompt muon and neutrino fluxes are adequately included at the event-by-event level.
While a production with the new CORSIKA v7.4005 has begun, the high CPU demand
has so far prevented this simulation from being fully processed through the MC chain and
used for analysis.

• Atmospheric muon events which coincidentally arrive simultaneously with neutrino
events have not been simulated, since it is anticipated that resolving multiple components
will prove feasible for ARCA. An explicit production of coincident muon events will
need to be produced in order to verify this.

3.2.4. Event reconstruction. Two broad event classes can be identified in a high energy
neutrino telescope: track-like events and cascade-like events:

• The track-like events are generated by muons that are produced in the matter inside or
surrounding the detector through CC interactions of nm (nm) and nt (nt). CC reactions of nt
(nt) produce a muon with a branching ratio of 17%, when the emerging τ decays into a μ.

• The cascade-like events are produced in the matter near or inside the detector volume
through CC interactions of ne (ne) and nt (nt) and in NC interactions of neutrinos of all
flavours. CC nt (nt) interactions produce cascade events with a branching ratio of 83%.

These two events classes produce very different time-space hit patterns in the detector.
The cascade-like events are characterised by a very dense hit pattern close to the neutrino
interaction point. A significant fraction of the neutrino energy is released in a hadronic shower
(and, in the case of ne (ne) CC interactions, the rest in an electromagnetic cascade), thus
allowing for a good estimate of the neutrino energy. A track-like event is characterised by the
Cherenkov light from the emerging muon that can travel large distances through Earth rock
and sea water. The spatial hit pattern in this case is closely related to the muon direction, thus
allowing for a precise measurement of the latter. Typical hit patterns for track-like and
cascade-like events are shown in figure 21.

Starting from the ANTARES experience, algorithms that reconstruct direction, energy
and interaction vertex of the neutrinos from the muon tracks or the showers have been
developed. These have been optimised for ‘pure’ track events (nm CC events far from the
detector, where only a single energetic muon is observed) and for cascade events (ν NC and ne

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

27



CC events, where only a cascade is observed), respectively. Thus their performance on more
complicated event topologies is not optimal; prospects for improvements are discussed at the
end of this section.

3.2.5. Track reconstruction. Muons with energies above 1 TeV can reach track lengths of the
order of kilometres and have a direction that is nearly collinear with that of the parent
neutrino. To reconstruct the muon direction—and consequently the neutrino direction—an
algorithm is used that maximises the likelihood that the observed space–time PMT hit pattern
is consistent with Cherenkov emission from the fitted muon trajectory. An initial hit selection
exploits hit coincidences between PMTs in the same optical module or between different

event (right), showing only DOMs with a total ToT (summed over all 31 PMTs) of
more than 30 ns in a narrow time window. In both cases, the incoming neutrino is
indicated by the red line, and the outgoing lepton (muon or neutrino) by the green line.
The colour scale gives the hit times with respect to the time of the neutrino interaction,
while the size of the circles are proportional to the total ToT on each DOM. DOMs
without hits are shown by grey dots.

optical modules to remove uncorrelated hits from background photons, mostly from K40

decays. The reconstruction of the muon trajectory starts with a linear fit, followed by three
consecutive fitting steps, each using the results of the previous one as starting point. A
pseudo-vertex position is also estimated, which, however, usually is related to the entry point
of the muon in the detector rather than to the location of the interaction vertex; this quantity is
useful for background rejection. In addition to the track information (direction and pseudo-
vertex) an estimator of the fit quality, Λ, and the number of hits associated with the final track
fit, Nhit, are determined. The Λ parameter is used in the analysis to reject badly reconstructed
events, in particular atmospheric muons mis-reconstructed as up-going. The Nhit parameter is
related to the muon energy and is used to reject low-energy events that are mainly due to
atmospheric neutrino background. A very good angular resolution of about 0.2 is achieved
for neutrinos above 10 TeV, see figure 22 (left).

The amount of light collected by the PMTs when a muon travels inside the detector is
correlated with the muon energy. To estimate the muon energy, a method exploiting this
dependence by means of an artificial neural network has been developed. The first step is the
selection of events with a reconstructed muon track travelling inside the detector for an
adequate distance. The second step is the evaluation of several quantities related with the total
event ToT and with the number of DOMs hit. These quantities are used to feed the neural
network. The energy resolution obtained for well reconstructed (cut on Λ applied) and
contained events is0.27 units in mElog10( ) for  mE10 TeV 10 PeV (see figure 22 right);
without containment requirement, the resolution slightly worsens to 0.28 units. Further
details on the track reconstruction code can be found in [37].

This energy reconstruction method must be trained on appropriate samples of MC events
and is not yet fully integrated in the reconstruction software for ARCA. A simple energy
reconstruction using the Nhit parameter is embedded in the reconstruction software and gives
results of almost equivalent quality. This method is used for the sensitivity studies presented
in the following.

3.2.6. Cascade reconstruction. The length of a cascade event depends logarithmically on the
cascade energy and is of the order of 10 m in the energy range relevant for ARCA analyses.
At the length scale of typical distances between optical modules, cascades thus produce
almost point-like signatures, characterised by vertex position, direction, and energy. CC
interactions of nm and nt, if they happen in the detector volume, also produce cascades, but the
outgoing μ, τ, or τ decay products produce a more complex signature. Hence, cascade
reconstruction is optimised for ν NC and ne CC interactions, and then the performance is
assessed on the latter class. Three independent algorithms have been applied to reconstruct
cascade vertex position, direction and energy. The first has been specifically developed for
ARCA, and exhibits the best performance. The second and third have been adapted from
ANTARES analyses and have outputs which prove useful in event classification and
background discrimination. All three are described here, although only the performance of the
first is shown.

The first algorithm (algorithm 1) has been specifically developed to exploit the
information provided by the KM3NeT multi-PMT DOM. The hit selection is designed to
be simple and to allow for a fast reconstruction. Hits on the same PMT within 350 ns are
merged using the time of the first hit, and coincidences of two merged hits within 20 ns on a
single DOM are used for the vertex fit. This fit minimises time-residuals assuming a
spherically expanding shell of light about an assumed cascade maximum. The offset of this fit
from the MC true vertex position in the longitudinal direction (figure 23 left) mostly measures

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

29



the shower elongation, while the offset in the lateral direction (figure 23 right) measures the
accuracy, reaching a precision well below 0.5 m in the high-energy regime.

The direction and energy are reconstructed using maximum-likelihood methods, applied
to the merged hits as described above. All PMT hits within −100 ns to +900 ns of the
expected Cherenkov light-front from the vertex fit are used. Thus each PMT only has a 0.2%
chance of receiving a random hit from the optical background. Rather than fitting the ToT
(∼charge) measurement from each PMT, the algorithm simply fits the probability of a PMT
recording one or more photons within this time-window, making the procedure highly robust.
This probability is estimated from simulations as a function of PMT distance and pointing
direction to the shower, angle from the shower axis to the PMT position, and electromagnetic-
equivalent cascade energy. The strong geometrical dependence in hit probabilities allows for
a very high reconstruction quality: nearby PMTs facing towards the cascade, close to the

Cherenkov angle, will tend to have a hit probability of unity, while distant PMTs facing away
from the cascade, far from the Cherenkov angle, will tend to have a hit probability of zero.

For contained events above 50 TeV, the s1 energy and median direction resolutions
achieved with this method are roughly 10% and 2° respectively, with no loss of efficiency.
The resolutions after the selection cuts described in section 3.3.1 are shown in figure 24. For
energy above 60 TeV, corresponding to the approximate low-energy threshold of the cut-and-
count diffuse-flux analysis (see section 3.3.1), the s1 energy resolution is characteristically
5%, while the median directional resolution is 1.5 . This energy resolution is close to the limit
imposed by variations in the hadronic cascade component (mostly due to the variable
inelasticity), which yields less Cherenkov light (∼90% at 100 TeV) than the electromagnetic
component [38].

The second algorithm fits the vertex position from the positions and the arrival times of
the PMT hits using an M-estimator procedure and applies selection cuts on the resulting
quality parameters. The cascade direction is determined from the average direction of hits
with respect to the vertex position, the energy is estimated from the observed ToT values,
taking into account the expected relative intensities at given PMT positions. The third
algorithm starts from a simple vertex estimation based on large-amplitude hits, followed by a
hit selection using this vertex and causality relations and finally by two sequential,
independent log-likelihood fits yielding first the vertex position and then the energy and
direction of the event. The algorithms yield similar accuracy and are fully efficient for events
passing the cuts. While they are less precise than algorithm1, they exhibit different responses
to non-cascade events, and their output is useful for background suppression. More details on
the cascade reconstruction codes presented here can be found in [39].

3.2.7. Prospects for improved reconstruction. The main reconstruction goal of ARCA is to
precisely determine the parameters of track-like and cascade-like events, and the methods
presented above have been developed with this in mind. New reconstruction algorithms tuned
on nm CC and ne CC events are in the testing phase and first results are very promising. Also
reconstructions tuned for different event classes that present more complex topologies are in
the development phase. In particular:

• Improved track and cascade reconstructions.
The track and cascade reconstructions described above are first-generation algorithms
developed for ARCA, and there are good prospects for improvements in both. In fact,
when the reconstruction algorithms were developed the full PMT response was not yet
being implemented in the simulation chain. Reconstructions based on a more-detailed
knowledge of the detector are currently in development or in the testing phase.
In particular, the best current cascade reconstruction (algorithm 1) uses very little timing
information to fit the cascade energy and direction, and no information from individual
PMT signal magnitudes (all ToT values treated equally). A new cascade reconstruction
algorithm that exploits this information in detail is under development. First estimates
indicate that a cascade resolutions of 1° may be attainable with improved efficiency.
Additionally, a new track reconstruction algorithm has recently been developed. From
initial values obtained by a rigorous scan of the full solid angle, the likelihood is
maximised using a multi-dimensional probability distribution function (PDF) of the
arrival time of Cherenkov light from the muon. In figure 25, the angular resolution
reached for nm CC events is reported, showing that an angular resolution better than 0.1
is reached for events with energy higher than 100 TeV.

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

31



However, these reconstructions have not yet been processed through the full MC chain
described in section 3.2, and hence are not used in the analyses presented here. However,
since the atmospheric background for point-source studies (section 3.3.6) reduces with
the square of the angular resolution, using these reconstructions is expected to
significantly improve the sensitivity of such studies in the near future.

• τ ‘double-bang’ events.
A τ produced in a nt CC interaction will on average travel 4.89 cm TeV

−1 before
decaying. If the decay is not into a μ (~83% probability), the decay products will create a
cascade-like signature offset from the first interaction vertex. At sufficiently high energies
(E 100 TeV), this second cascade will be offset from the first by distances significantly
larger than the precision of the cascade reconstruction, creating a ‘double bang’.
Identifying such double-bang events would be a clear signature of the flavour of the
neutrino primaries.
A preliminary investigation, conducted assuming an initial hadronic cascade (‘bang’)
energy of = ntE E0.21 , an outgoing tau of energy =t ntE E0.8 , a tau decay length

=t tℓ E4.89 m 100 TeV· ( ), and a second ‘bang’ energy of = tE E0.672 , showed that
cascade reconstruction algorithm1 could identify both events when separated by 10 m or
more, i.e. for nt at ∼ 250 TeV and above. It is expected that an even closer separation will
be resolvable.

• Starting track events.
A nm CC interaction in the detector volume will produce a cascade at the interaction
vertex, and an outgoing μ; nt CC events with subsequent t mnn decays will produce a
similar signature. Such interactions typically do not manifest themselves as either well-
reconstructed cascade or track events, due to the presence of the other component. An
optimal reconstruction method would separate both components and reconstruct them
simultaneously, allowing for improved energy and direction resolution on the neutrino
primary, and a better event selection.

Figure 25. ARCA resolutions for nm CC events using the new track reconstruction
algorithm. The black line shows the median value; dark blue shaded regions give the
90% range, while light blue shaded regions give the 68% range. Quality cuts that
remove most of the atmospheric muons are applied.

32



• Muon bundles.
Groups of muons from the core of an extended air shower (EAS) exhibit a signature very
similar to that of a single high-energy muon in the detector. However, their stochastic
energy-loss pattern is much more uniform, and their lateral spread is non-negligible at the
characteristic spatial resolution scale of ARCA. Currently, muon bundles are
reconstructed using a single-muon hypothesis. Identifying such events can be used to
reduce the background for studies searching for an excess of single energetic down-going
muons, either from an astrophysical nm flux, or from the prompt decay of charm particles
in EAS.

• Coincident EAS.
The rate of down-going μ from EAS above ARCA that produce a detectable signature in
the detector is expected to be about 50 Hz. With a typical event duration of 5 μs,
approximately one in 4000 events will have a coincidental muon present, corresponding
to a double coincidence every 80 s. Current simulations only model particles for
individual EAS, and current reconstruction methods only return at most a single track or
cascade event. Observe that this effect is much less important for ARCA than it is for
IceCube: the increased detector depth reduces the rate of coincident down-going muonic
background, and the better time-resolution afforded by the low scattering in sea water
allows photons from different sources to be separated within a much narrower time
window.

3.2.8. Background suppression. Backgrounds from atmospheric muons, as well as random
coincidences of hits from K40 decays, are reduced to acceptable levels by applying selection
cuts on the event reconstruction quality, the reconstructed zenith angle for track-like events
and quantities related to the event energy (such as the number of hits) or event topologies (e.g.
using boosted decision tree (BDT) techniques— see section 3.3). For point-source studies, the
main method of reducing the background event rate of both muon and neutrino events is via
the excellent angular resolution afforded by seawater, since the background rate reduces with
the square of the resolution. However, in particular for studies of a diffuse flux, the most
problematic remaining source of background is the atmospheric neutrino flux.

3.2.9. Self-veto of down-going atmospheric neutrinos. The interactions of CR with the
atmosphere generates extensive air showers (EASs) where both neutrinos and muons are
produced. Despite the ∼ 3 km overburden of water, muons with an energy in the TeV range
and above can reach the detector, either singly, or in multiples (muon ‘bundles’), particularly
under low zenith angles. These muon bundles can be used to ‘veto’ any accompanying
neutrinos, allowing for a strong reduction of the down-going atmospheric neutrino
background. This technique has been proposed in [31], where it is predicted in the context
of an IceCube-like detector that atmospheric neutrinos above 10 TeV and with zenith angles
less than 60° can be vetoed with almost 100% efficiency. More detailed calculations in [40]
suggest a somewhat lower, but still significant, veto probability.

Events simulated by CORSIKA (see section 3.2) have been used to estimate the self-veto
probability, and some preliminary results for the high-energy diffuse analysis using the
cascade channel (see section 3.3.1) are shown in [34]. In the case of ARCA, accompanying
muons make neutrino-induced cascade events less cascade-like, so that while these events are
not explicitly vetoed (as would be the case with IceCube), their topology is such that they
appear more background-like than signal-like in sensitivity studies targeting down-going
cascade events (see section 3.3). An example of such an event is given in figure 26.

33



An effective ‘veto’ effect can be demonstrated by using the (less sensitive) ‘cut-and-
count’ analysis method, as shown in figure 27. Shown are the distributions of atmospheric ne
CC events in the event selection both before (left) and after (right) the self-veto effect has
been taken into account. The total effect is a reduction of the down-going atmospheric
neutrino events in the selection by a factor of about two, or ∼ 25% in the all-sky background,
with higher-energy events close to the zenith being more efficiently rejected. It is difficult,
however, to compare this estimate with those of [31, 40] due to the different event samples,

a total ToT (summed over all 31 PMTs) of more than 30 ns in a narrow time window
are shown. The colour scale gives the hit times relative to the shower core impacting
the sea surface—only some of the muons at sea level (shown as blue lines) penetrated
to the detector depth. The size of the circles are proportional to the total ToT on each
DOM. DOMs without hits are shown by grey dots.

rejection methods, and detector depths. It should also be noted that the current estimate
suffers from low statistics, and that the analysis was not optimised with the self-veto effect
being taken into account. Hence, the final self-veto efficiency is expected to be higher, and
improvements of the results for searches of both diffuse and point-like astrophysical neutrino
fluxes in the cascade channel are anticipated.

3.3. Sensitivity studies

In this section, studies of the sensitivity of ARCA to diffuse fluxes and point-like sources are
presented. All the analyses take into account (anti-)neutrinos of all flavours (nm, ne, and nt) in
equal proportions and their CC and NC interactions, as simulated according to section 3.2.
Each analysis proceeds in the following steps:

(1) A preselection of the events to reject most of the atmospheric background, mostly by cuts
on parameters that are provided by the reconstruction algorithms or that are related to the
total ToT or number of hits.

(2) A multivariate analysis based on the BDT from the ROOT TMVA package [41], applied
to the preselected events for a more stringent background rejection. This step is not
applied in all analyses. When it is used, the exact input observables vary with each
analysis, but always consist of a subset of the reconstructed event directions, energies,
and positions from the track and the three cascade reconstruction methods described in
section 3.2.4. Additionally, quality parameters related to the fit procedures, such as the
log-likelihood of each fit, are included, as are measures of the photon arrival time
distribution about the light front—see section 3.2.4, and [39, 42], for further details.

(3) A ‘cut-and-count’ analysis method for a fast evaluation of the discovery potential and a
rough estimate of the number of events from background and signal. This method
consists of maximising of the model discovery potential (MDP) (see e.g. the methods of
[42, 43]) by placing cuts on simulated observables to obtain clean event samples.

(4) A maximum likelihood method applied to the event sample resulting from step2 to
calculate the discovery potential at different significance levels. All quoted significances
arise from this method—however, since only loose cuts are applied for the likelihood
maximisation in order to retain the maximum possible information, the resulting event
sample is very broad. Therefore, the expected numbers of events passing cuts are quoted
using the cut-and-count method above, reflecting the number of high-quality signal
candidate events.

is employed, where nsig is the estimated number of signal events, n is the total number of
events (and hence, implicitly, - =n n nsig back is the number of background events), and Psig
and Pback are the PDFs for signal and background events, respectively. The LR is maximised
by altering nsig to obtain LRmax . The PDFs are functions of one or more parameters X, such as
the BDT output if it is applied, and/or other parameters related to the specific analysis.

Pseudo-experiments (PEs) are performed and LR is maximised for each PE. The dis-
tributions of LRmax when simulated signals events are present are compared to distributions
in the background-only case to evaluate the significances of each simulated observation.

Unlike in the high-energy starting event (HESE) analysis of IceCube [12], no explicit
veto to remove atmospheric muon contaminations is used for KM3NeT/ARCA. Rather, the
methods of steps (2) and (4) above assign to each event likelihoods based on the observed
event topology, which is well-preserved in sea water due to the low light scattering.

3.3.1. Isotropic diffuse neutrino flux. The detection and detailed investigation of the
astrophysical flux observed by IceCube is one of the main physics goals of ARCA during
KM3NeT Phase-2.0. In the following, an estimate of the time to detect this flux at the s5 level
is presented.

This study has been optimised assuming that the IceCube signal originates from an
isotropic, flavour-symmetric neutrino flux following a power law spectrum with a cut-off at a
few PeV. The cutoff—or a steeper spectrum—is implied by the observation of events with a
deposited energy exceeding 1 PeV and the absence of events at about 6.3 PeV associated with
the Glashow resonance (W production in scattering of ne on electrons). The single-flavour
energy spectrum has been parameterised as:

Since the first IceCube discovery [12], several new analyses with updated event samples and
different event selection strategies have been published [15, 20, 44]. In these analyses various
compatible parameterisations for the cosmic neutrino flux have been proposed. To check the
robustness of our results with respect to the diffuse neutrino flux assumed we have also
calculated the significance of the KM3NeT/ARCA observation to the following diffuse flux
from [45], which is similar to the results recently reported in [14]:

equation (4) (dashed blue line) as a function of the neutrino energy. For comparison the
atmospheric neutrino fluxes are also reported (Honda flux [18] for the conventional

Note that for this steeper spectrum, a cut-off to suppress the Glashow resonance signature is
not necessarily required by observations, but is kept here in order to avoid biasing the analysis
by maximising the selection of such events. In figure 28 these fluxes are presented together
with the atmospheric neutrino fluxes for comparison.

In the following, the sensitivity studies for diffuse fluxes are presented for the cascade
channel and for the track channel.

3.3.2. Cascade channel. Events simulated as described in section 3.2 have been
reconstructed with the three available cascade reconstruction codes discussed in section 3.2.4.

The first selection cut requires the containment of the reconstructed vertex in a cylindrical
volume around the detector centre, with radius <r 500 m and height <z 200 m. The effect
of this cut is illustrated in figure 29. It rejects most of the atmospheric muons which, coming
from above, have the reconstructed vertex in the upper part of the detector. The containment
cut reduces the fiducial volume by about 20% with respect to the instrumented volume,
although this is compensated for by the included region below the instrumented volume.

from the detector centre) for atmospheric muon events (left top) and ne CC events (right

The red line shows the selected fiducial volume defined by <r 500 m and <z 200 m.

The corresponding rejection efficiency is reported in figure 30 (red line). A further
reduction of the background is obtained by removing low-energy events. The event ToT, i.e.

= å =ToT ToTk
N

kevt 1 with N being the number of causally connected hits selected by the
cascade reconstruction algorithm, is related to the energy deposited in the detector. The
cumulative ToTevt distribution is shown in figure 29 (bottom left panel). A cut m>ToT 12 sevt
is applied and rejects most low-energy atmospheric muons and a large part of the atmospheric
neutrino background, which is concentrated at lower energies. The corresponding rejection
efficiency is reported in figure 30 (green points).

As shown in figure 30 (left panel) the number of reconstructed atmospheric muons is still
too large. To further reduce this background, a BDT algorithm was applied to the preselected
event sample. As input for the BDT training, several quality parameters from the available
shower and track reconstruction algorithms are used. The BDT is then trained to discriminate
tracks from showers using simulated datasets of atmospheric muons and ne CC events as
training samples. The cumulative distribution of the resulting discrimination parameter ρ and
the cut applied on ρ are shown in figure 29 (right bottom panel).

A first estimate of the discovery potential, obtained with the cut-and-count approach,
yields final event selection cuts of r > 0.5 and > »E 10 GeV 50rec 4.7 TeV. The
corresponding rejection efficiency is reported in figure 30 (blue line). With these cuts the
background due to atmospheric muons is almost completely rejected for the presently
available simulation live-time of three years at high energies. Table 3 reports the number of
events per 5 years for ARCA at each step of the analysis for the different event samples. Most

of the selected events are ne and nt events, due to the higher cascade energy deposition of the
CC interactions as compared to the NC channel, and because the BDT identifies nm CC events
as less ‘shower-like’ due to the presence of the outgoing muon. With these event rates, a s5
discovery of the IceCube flux in the cascade channel can be achieved with 50% probability
after 1.3 years of ARCA operation. The MC neutrino energy distribution for the final cut-and-
count event sample is shown in figure 31. The final cuts preferentially select events in the
neutrino energy range from about 50 TeV to about 2 PeV ( < <nE10 GeV 10 GeV4.7 6.3 ).

To further improve the evaluation of the discovery potential, the maximum likelihood
method (step (4) above) has been applied to the preselected events. The PDF functions in
equation (2) are functions of the reconstructed energy Erec and the BDT output ρ. The
resulting significance is reported in figure 35 as a function of the number of observation years.
With the KM3NeT/ARCA detector the assumed signal flux will be detectable at s5 in the
cascade channel in about one year of observation time.

The estimate of the significance depends on the assumed background and in particular on
the model assumed for the description of the conventional and the prompt components of the
atmospheric neutrino flux (see section 3.1.2). For the cascade channel the maximum variation
of the significance, reported as a red band in figure 35, has been obtained assuming the
maximum and minimum flux values of the prompt atmospheric neutrino component reported
in [19]. Moreover, the significance has also been estimated taking into account the new
prompt calculation reported in [23] (see section 3.1.2). In this case, the time to discover the
diffuse flux is reduced by about 30%.

3.3.3. Track channel. Since energetic muons can have very long tracks (a 10 TeV muon has
a path length of »5 6– km in water), muon neutrinos with interaction points far from the
instrumented volume can be detected, thus making the effective volume much larger than the
geometrical detector volume. The main challenge in using the track channel is to distinguish
these events from atmospheric muons. Here we follow the traditional approach to reject
atmospheric muons by using the Earth as a shield, and select track-like events that come from

neutrino energy for events with the MDP cuts. The black vertical lines show the energy

below the horizon, or a few degrees above it. In this analysis a cut on the reconstructed zenith
angle q > 80rec is applied.

In figure 32 the ratio of the numbers of selected events and triggered events is reported
(red lines) for atmospheric muons (left panel) and nm CC events (right panel). The atmospheric
muon rate at energies below 106 GeV is reduced by more than one order of magnitude. Most
of the remaining atmospheric muons are mis-reconstructed as up-going or are near the
horizon.

To remove the mis-reconstructed events an additional cut on the quality parameter Λ (see
section 3.2.4) was applied. In figure 33 (left panel) the cumulative Λ distribution is shown for
atmospheric muons (black line), for atmospheric neutrinos (dashed line) and cosmic neutrinos
(solid line), for events with q > 80rec . For L -6 the atmospheric muon background is
reduced to the level of the astrophysical neutrino signal.

To reduce the background due to atmospheric neutrinos, a cut on the number of hits
associated with the fitted track, Nhit, is applied (see section 3.2.4). Nhit is related to the muon
energy loss in the detector and thus to the primary neutrino energy. The cumulative Nhit
distribution is presented in figure 33 (right panel).

the track analysis (see text) for atmospheric muons (left) and nm CC neutrino reactions

indicate the final cut values applied in the analysis (see text).

The final cut values, obtained by maximising the MDP for 5 years of observation time,
are L > -5.8 and >N 591hit . The resulting numbers of events and the selection efficiencies
are reported in table 4 and figure 32, respectively. The number of atmospheric muons
surviving the final cuts has been extrapolated from the present statistics (see figure 17). The
MC neutrino energy distribution for the event sample after final cuts is shown in figure 34.
The cuts select events in the neutrino energy range from about 80 TeV to about 3 PeV. A
discovery at s5 with 50% probability is achieved in about 3.2 years.

As in the cascade analysis, the maximum likelihood method was applied to the
preselected event sample (q > 80rec and L > -5.8) to further improve the sensitivities. The
likelihood ratio (equation (2)) was calculated for signal and background using PDFs that were
mono-dimensional functions of Nhit. The resulting significance is reported in figure 35 as a
function of the observation time. The assumed signal flux can be detected with KM3NeT/
ARCA at s5 in the track channel in about 1.6 years of observation time with 50% probability.

For the track channel, the maximum variation of the significance (reported as a grey band
in figure 35) has been obtained with the assumed uncertainties in the intensity of the
conventional atmospheric neutrino flux (see section 3.1.2).

3.3.4. Combined analysis. To combine the results of the cascade and track analyses, up-
going and down-going events were analysed separately. For down-going events, where the
atmospheric background is very high, only contained events are considered (same
preselection cuts as in the cascade analysis). For up-going events, preselection cuts on the
reconstructed vertices and ToTevt are used to reject atmospheric muons that are wrongly
reconstructed as up-going. BDT discrimination cuts are then applied to both samples of
preselected events. The BDTs use parameters coming from both the track and shower
reconstruction algorithms and are optimised to reject atmospheric muons. The BDT outputs
are used together with the cascade energy estimate in a maximum likelihood approach based
on equation (2). The final result is reported in figure 35 (blue line) as a function of the
observation time. Combining the results of the track and cascade analyses, KM3NeT/ARCA

is expected to observe the IceCube flux (equation (3)) in about 6 months with a significance of
s5 with 50% probability.

To investigate the sensitivity of these results to the assumed form of the IceCube diffuse
flux, both the cascade and track analyses were repeated for signal fluxes according to
equation (4) both with and without the 3 PeV cutoff. In each case, the flux normalisation
constant, F s5 , required for a s5 discovery after 1 year of observation time, was calculated.
The results are reported in table 5 in terms of their ratio to the flux normalisation reported by
IceCube, FIC

0 . Values larger (less) than unity indicate a s5 discovery time of more (less) than
1 year. The results show that for flux assumptions with a softer spectrum and the same cut-off
the main results of our analysis do not change, and in fact a small improvement (»10%) is
expected.

3.3.5. Diffuse neutrino flux from the GP. One of the most promising potential source regions
of a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux is the GP. Neutrinos are expected to be produced in
the interactions of the galactic CRs with the interstellar medium and radiation fields, with a
potentially significant excess with respect to the expected extragalactic background. The
observation of diffuse TeV γ-ray emission from the GP [46, 47], which is expected to arise
from the same hadronic processes that would produce high-energy neutrinos, strongly
supports this hypothesis. Also Fermi-LAT observes, after the subtraction of known point-like
emitting sources, a broad diffuse emission from the GP, with a spectrum consistent with a
significant hadronic component [48].

Recently, also related to the observed IceCube high-energy neutrino events, new
phenomenological models for the diffuse galactic neutrino emission have been proposed [49–
53]. In particular, in [54] a non-uniform CR transport model with a radially dependent
diffusion coefficient has been adopted to explain the high-energy diffuse γ-ray emission along
the whole GP, as well as the hardening of CR spectra measured by PAMELA and AMS-02
around 250 GeV and two possible CR cut-offs, at 5 PeV and 50 PeV, compatible with
KASKADE and KASKADE-Grande observations. In [51], these authors estimate that the
astrophysical flux detected by IceCube in both the HESE [13] and diffuse muon [55] analyses
is still dominated by an extragalactic diffuse component, with galactic emission respectively
accounting for 15% and 10% of events. Using this model, a detailed prediction of the neutrino

emission from the inner GP, i.e. for < l 30∣ ∣ and < b 4∣ ∣ (b and l being the Galactic latitude
and longitude, respectively) has been obtained (see figure 4 of [54]). This flux is adopted here
to estimate the performance of the KM3NeT/ARCA detector in searching for neutrinos from
the GP. The selected region is entirely located in the Southern Hemisphere. The estimated
one-flavour neutrino flux has been parameterised as:

An analysis similar to that described for the all-sky diffuse track channel has been performed
to estimate the KM3NeT/ARCA sensitivity to this flux. Events were preselected requiring the
zenith angle to be q > 80rec and to point to the sky region with < l 30∣ ∣ and < b 4∣ ∣ . This
sky region is visible to the KM3NeT/ARCA detector for events up to 10° above the horizon
for about 77% of the time. The final cut values, obtained by minimising the MDP, were
L > -5.8 and >N 181hit . The numbers of events from the selected GP region are found to
be 2.8 background events (muons and neutrinos) and 3.4 from the source flux of equation (5)
in one year of ARCA operation. The significance as a function of the observation time has
been evaluated by the maximum-likelihood method and is reported in figure 36 (left panel). A
discovery at s5 with 50% probability can be achieved in about 5 years of observation time
with the KM3NeT/ARCA detector. The discovery flux at s5 and s3 is reported as a function
of the observation time in figure 36 (right panel). As for the diffuse flux analysis, a reduction
on the number of the observation years is expected if the cascade channel is included in the
analysis. This work is at the moment on-going.

3.3.6. Point-like neutrino sources. Due to its good angular resolution, KM3NeT/ARCA is a
very promising instrument for the detection of point-like sources. In particular, its location in
the Northern Hemisphere will allow the study of most Galactic sources, as well as
extragalactic sources (which are expected to be approximately uniformly distributed over the
sky) using up-going muon track events. In this section the sensitivity of the ARCA detector to
point-like sources will be discussed. In particular the two following physics cases will be
analysed:

• Neutrino emission by the supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713 and the pulsar wind
nebula (PWN) Vela-X, which are at present the Galactic objects exhibiting the most
intense high-energy emission [56–58]. For these sources, the zenith position, angular
extension, and neutrino flux parameterisation are extracted from the measured high-
energy γ-ray spectra. In both cases, the expected neutrino spectra are evaluated from the γ
spectrum under the hypothesis of a transparent source and 100% hadronic emission.
Although PWN are commonly assumed to be powered by e-/e+ winds, they will entrain
ions from the ambient medium, possibly accelerating them to very high energies.

• Sources without significant angular extension, emitting a benchmark -E 2 neutrino
spectrum. These can be viewed as characteristic of extragalactic sites of hadronic
acceleration (e.g. AGN) with cut-offs expected at very high energies. While the actual
spectra of individual neutrino sources is not expected to follow a simple -E 2 power-law,
and may exhibit features such as a peak at PeV energies, or a harder spectra extending to
EeV energies [59], the projected sensitivity to an -E 2 flux gives a good indicator of
ARCA’s ability to study such extragalactic sources with higher-energy fluxes.

For the detection of neutrinos from point-like sources, the best performance is expected
from a search for track-like events. In fact, as discussed in section 3.2.4, with long muon
tracks an angular resolution of about ~ 0.2 can be achieved. To remove the unavoidable
down-going atmospheric muon background, events are selected that contain tracks
reconstructed as up-going.

At the latitude of the Mediterranean Sea, selecting tracks that are reconstructed below or
a few degrees above the horizon implies a reduction of the visibility for source declinations
above - 40 , as shown in figure 37. On the other hand, it is possible to view Northern-sky
sources below + 50 of declination, giving a total of p»3.5 sr sky coverage.

track analysis, for p2 downward coverage, i.e. tracks below the horizon (black line);

(red line).

3.3.7. Galactic sources. SNR RX J1713.7-3946 (short: RX J1713) is a young shell-type
supernova remnant that has been observed by H.E.S.S. in several campaigns [60, 61]. The γ
rays are emitted from a relatively large circular region with a radius of about 0.6 and a
complex morphology, with an energy spectrum that extends up to 100 TeV. The source, at a
declination of -  ¢39 46 , is visible for 80% of the time when selecting tracks with
reconstructed zenith angle q > 78rec . For the present analysis, homogeneous emission from a
circular region around the measured declination with a radial extension of 0.6 has been
assumed. The neutrino flux adopted has been derived from the measured γ-ray spectrum and
has been parameterised following [62]:

Since the maximum elevation for a source at the declination of RX J1713 is~ 14 , and to
maximise the signal-to-background ratio, events were preselected requiring that the
reconstructed track has a zenith angle q > 78rec and a radial distance from the centre of
the source of a < 10 . The numbers of events at reconstruction level and after the
preselection cuts are shown in table 6. Even after the preselection, the numbers of events due
to neutrino and muon atmospheric background largely exceed the number of expected signal
events from the source. The atmospheric muons can be efficiently removed by imposing a cut
on the Λ parameter as shown in figure 39. Finally, a BDT trained to discriminate signal events
from neutrino background is applied.

The MDP is then maximised by adjusting the cut on the BDT output value. The number
of events per 5 years of observation time surviving these cuts is indicated in table 6, together
with the number of events expected at each step of this analysis. The ratio between these

event numbers and the number of triggered events is reported as a function of the neutrino
energy for nm CC interactions in the right panel of figure 40.

The significance has been evaluated with an unbinned method [63] by maximising the
likelihood ratio of equation (2), with PDFs expressed as functions of the BDT output
(figure 41). The result shows that a 3σ significance can be reached in about 4 years of
observation time.

The same analysis has been applied to Vela-X, which is one of the nearest and most
intense PWNe, and has been extensively studied in TeV γ rays by the HESS Collaboration
[64, 65]. Vela-X is located at a declination of -  ¢45 36 . The neutrino spectrum has been
estimated from the differential energy spectrum using the prescription in [66–68] for an
integration radius of 0.8 around the source centre and was parameterised as:

This spectrum is shown in figure 38 (red line). The source has been simulated as a
homogeneously emitting disk of 0.8 radius.

The expected sensitivity of ARCA to Vela-X is shown in figure 42 as a function of the
observation time. Owing to the good visibility of the GP, a significance of s3 can be reached
in less than 3 years of observation time. The bands show the variation of the significance due
to the uncertainty on the normalisation of the conventional part of the atmospheric neutrino
spectrum (see section 3.1.2).

calculated for a generic point-like source with a spectrum µ -E 2. In the preselection sample
only events with q > 80rec have been selected. In this analysis, at present, the BDT
procedure has not been applied, since the larger difference in the slopes of the atmospheric
and source neutrino energy spectra eases discrimination between them.

After the preselection, an unbinned method has been applied that maximises the
likelihood ratio of equation (2), with PDFs as functions of the two parameters Nhit (related to
the energy of the neutrinos) and α, the angular distance from the source centre. The s5
discovery flux is reported in figure 43 as a function of the declination for 3 years of
observation time, corresponding to the exposure for the current IceCube result. The upper
limit of ANTARES is also reported for comparison.

ARCA’s expected resolution on cascades of ~ 1.5 (see section 3.2.6) allows us to also
use this channel for a point-source search, as recently demonstrated by ANTARES [71]. Since
discriminating down-going cascade events from the muonic background is easier than for
tracks, cascade searches have a p4 sr coverage, making this detection channel especially
important for sources with an otherwise limited visibility. First preliminary results for the
cascade channel for generic point-like sources with an -E 2 spectrum will also be presented in
this section.

The sensitivity of KM3NeT/ARCA to point-like sources has been evaluated using
cascade events. In this analysis all simulated events have been reconstructed with both the
track and cascade reconstructions. To remove the atmospheric muons, which are the main
source of background, a preselection of events was performed, leading to the two event
samples:

• Sample A: events reconstructed as down-going with the track reconstruction. Cuts similar
to the cascade diffuse analysis have been applied:
– geometrical containment cuts <z 250 m and <r 500 m (see figure 29);
– reconstructed track zenith q < 80 ;rec
– m>ToT 6 sevt (see figure 29);
– L < -5.8.

• Sample B: events reconstructed as up-going with the track reconstruction. The following
cuts are applied:

discovery potential for the IceCube detector [69] (blue line), and upper limits on
particular sources for the ANTARES detector [70] (blue squares) are also shown.

– geometrical containment cuts <z 324 m and <r 450 m (see figure 29);
– reconstructed track zenith q > 80 ;rec
– m>ToT 4 sevt (see figure 29).

The containment cuts mainly select cascade events that have the interaction vertex inside
the detector volume and remove track-like events. Remaining track-like events are rejected by
the Λ cut in sampleA (removing well-reconstructed atmospheric muons) and with the ToT
cut that removes lower-energy tracks with the vertex inside the instrumented volume. In both
samples, most of the selected source events are cascade-like events, the track ‘contamination’
being of order 10%.

Since the cut-and-count method has not been applied in this case (i.e. no cut on the
distance between the reconstructed direction and the source centre has been applied, with
events reconstructed closer to the source appearing more source-like), the unweighted number
of signal and background events passing the above cuts is not meaningful, and is not reported.

The same BDT procedure described in section 3.3.1 for the diffuse cascade analysis, to
discriminate tracks from showers, has been applied to the two samples. An optimal cut on the
BDT output variable was found to be r > 0.5.

The discovery potential has been obtained by performing an unbinned log-likelihood
search. The likelihood takes into account the energy and directional information of each event
reconstructed with the cascade reconstruction. In order to take into account the two different
event samples, the following likelihood ratio, similar to that one of equation (2), has been
considered:

In figure 44 (left panel) the relative percentage of events, dC ( ), of the two selected samples

The discovery flux at the 5σ level is reported in figure 45 as a function of the declination
(red line) for 3 years of observation time, and is compared with the discovery flux obtained for
the track analysis. For declinations higher than 50°, where the visibility for up-going tracks is
very poor or null, a competitive value w.r.t. the present IceCube value can be obtained (see
figure 43).

The cascade angular resolution of the preselected events for d = 45 is reported in
figure 44 right panel, and shows that an average angular resolution of about 2° can be
reached. This includes all events passing the cuts described above (no cuts on reconstructed
angle to the source), showing that a very good angular resolution is obtained.

Similarly to the diffuse analysis, improvements in point-source sensitivity are expected
when combining the events from the track and cascade channels, especially for sources
located in the Northern sky.

3.3.9. Potential improvements in point-like-source searches. An improvement in the
sensitivity for the search for neutrinos from point-like sources is expected when the two
new reconstruction algorithms (one for track and one for cascade events, see section 3.2.4),
that are being tested, will be applied to the MC data set. Additionally, the first tests indicate a
higher number of reconstructed events (higher efficiency) in addition to a better angular
resolution.

The search for neutrino sources can be also improved by grouping potential sources
together in a procedure that is known as ‘source stacking’. This is usually applied to sources
of the same class. In our case, several potential sources otherwise too weak to be investigated
individually are present in the Galactic and extragalactic region. This technique has not been
yet applied, but an improvement is expected both for the search of Galactic PeV sources
(SNR, PWN, etc) and for extragalactic sources (AGN).

analysis is also shown (blue curve).

3.3.10. Further physics opportunities. In addition to the central science targets of neutrino
astronomy, i.e. investigating high-energy cosmic neutrinos and identifying their astrophysical
sources, KM3NeT/ARCA will offer a wide spectrum of further physics opportunities, of
which a selection is sketched in the following. Corresponding physics analyses have been
pioneered by the IceCube and ANTARES collaborations.

• Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
There is strong evidence that long-duration GRBs are produced from relativistic jets
formed in the collapse of a massive star [72]. Shocks generated either within the jet, or
when the jet collides with surrounding material, are potential CR acceleration sites, with
an associated neutrino flux from subsequent interactions and decays [73]. The short
duration of GRBs (seconds to minutes) allows a narrow neutrino-search time-window,
effectively reducing the background when compared to a standard point-source search.
This has allowed ANTARES and IceCube to constrain the properties of GRB jets
[74, 75]. KM3NeT/ARCA will increase the sensitivity of such searches similarly to that
for -E 2 point-sources (section 3.3.8).

• Multi-messenger studies
KM3NeT/ARCA will be part of a global alert system able to tag synchronous
observations of different experiments, observing e.g. γ rays or gravitational waves, that in
themselves are not significant but become so when combined. Another branch of multi-
messenger studies is the creation of alerts for optical, radio or x-ray telescopes to follow
up ‘suspicious’ neutrino observations, such as a doublet of events from the same celestial
direction during a short time period. As per the ANTARES TAToO program [76],
KM3NeT/ARCA will monitor more than half the sky, and will be able to generate alerts
with high angular precision within seconds. As ultra-high-energy CRs are also expected
to retain some directional information, correlation studies with the arrival directions of
events detected by e.g. the Pierre Auger Observatory will also be possible.

• Cosmic ray physics
KM3NeT/ARCA will register a huge number of high-energy atmospheric muons that
reflect the direction of impact of the primary CR particle with sub-degree precision. This
data set will allow us to investigate inhomogeneities of the CR flux and to complement
the corresponding sky maps by IceCube and dedicated CR experiments.
A further opportunity might be the detailed investigation of muon bundles that could, via
their multiplicity and divergence, be related to the chemical composition of CRs.

• Particle physics with atmospheric muons and neutrinos
The high-energy end of the atmospheric muon and neutrino spectra are expected to be
dominated by prompt processes, i.e. the production of charm or bottom hadrons in the
primary CR reactions in the atmosphere and their subsequent fast decay to leptons. Little
is experimentally known about these reactions, and theoretical modelling is difficult since
it involves QCD processes at the border line of the non-perturbative regime. Identifying
and measuring the muons and neutrinos from these processes would shed light on the
underlying reaction mechanisms.

• Tau neutrinos
The capability to identify tau neutrino reactions at energies beyond a few 100 TeV (see
section 3.2.4) will not only allow for constraining the flavour composition of high-energy
cosmic neutrino fluxes, but might also provide an additional handle to investigate prompt
neutrino fluxes (see above), which are the only CR reactions for which a significant
production probability for tau neutrinos is expected.

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

52



A further interesting phenomenon of tau neutrinos is their regeneration after CC
reaction in the Earth through the subsequent tau decay (relevant for energies above a few
10 TeV). The observation of this phenomenon would be interesting in itself, but might in
addition signal new particle physics, e.g. in the context of supersymmetry.

• Dark matter
Even though the existence of dark matter is considered proven and its particle nature very
likely, there is no direct or indirect evidence for the properties of these particles. Should
they have masses in the TeV range or above, neutrinos from self-annihilation reactions
could be the first dark matter signal ever detected. ANTARES and IceCube have already
proven the ability of neutrino telescopes to significantly constrain dark matter properties,
with searches targeting accumulations in the Sun [77, 78], the Galactic Centre [79, 80]
and halo [81], and nearby galaxies [82]. The corresponding investigations with
KM3NeT/ARCA data will—as with all indirect searches—be particularly sensitive to
dark matter particles with spin-dependent scattering cross sections on nuclei. The study of
neutrino fluxes from the Galactic centre and halo, nearby galaxies and Galaxy clusters
could also provide constraints on scenarios that invoke the decay of very heavy (∼PeV)
dark matter to explain the high-energy neutrino excess observed by IceCube [83–86].

• Exotics
There is a variety of hypothesised stable or quasi-stable particles that would leave an
identifiable, characteristic signature when crossing the detector. Amongst these are
magnetic monopoles (for which ANTARES and IceCube have already performed a
search [87, 88]), strangelets, Q-balls, and nuclearites.

• Violation of Lorentz invariance (LIV)
LIV could lead to oscillation-like interference patterns of atmospheric neutrinos in the
energy range of TeV and above. Additionally, LIV would produce a time-delay between
neutrinos and photons from distant, time-variable sources (in particular, GRBs), allowing
LIV to be tested by multi-messenger studies.

3.4. Investigation of systematic effects

The simulation chain described in section 3.2 assumes standard values for the detector
geometry, water optical properties, bioluminescent rates, and also a perfectly calibrated
detector. In the context of KM3NeT/ARCA sensitivity studies, the term ‘systematic effects’
is used broadly to cover all potential deviations from the standard simulated dataset, and this
section describes a series of dedicated studies aiming to estimate their potential influence on
ARCA event reconstruction and sensitivity to astrophysical neutrino fluxes.

Each systematic was simulated using a data-set of 10% that of the standard simulation,
with the systematic being inserted at the latest possible point in the chain to ensure the least
influence of random variation between the sets. For example, changing the water scattering
length required re-simulating the hit-time distribution on the PMTs, while reducing the PMT
effective area was performed by keeping 90% of the detected photons from the standard
simulation. Most systematic effects were simulated as a 10% change, and thus did not reflect
the expected size of the resulting effect, but rather were used to estimate the change dX/dSys
in some relevant quantity X as a function of the systematic Sys.

In each case, the effects of the systematics were first analysed using the ‘golden channel’
approach, i.e. by applying the track reconstruction of section 3.2.4 to nm CC events, and
applying the cascade reconstruction algorithm 1 of section 3.2.4 to ne CC events and with the
cut-and-count method. Only when a significant effect was found was the systematic applied to

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

53



the full analysis chains: the point-like track analysis of section 3.3.6, and the diffuse cascade
analysis of section 3.3.1.

Similar effects have been considered for KM3NeT/ORCA, particularly in the case of
reconstruction (section 4.4.6). However, the effects of systematics on the mass hierarchy
sensitivity of KM3NeT/ORCA are treated via the inclusion of nuisance parameters in the
calculation described in section 4.6, rather than using fully resimulated data.

3.4.1. Optics: water properties and DOM response. The absorption and scattering of light in
seawater has been measured at the KM3NeT-It site to within an accuracy of approximately
10% [89]. The dominant uncertainty is the contribution due to particulates, whereas the
scattering and absorption from pure seawater (salt and water) is well-determined. To simulate
this effect, the particulate contribution only has been varied so that the scattering/absorption
lengths (lscat andlabs respectively) vary by ±10% at wavelengths near 400nm. It is expected
that in situ measurements using the KM3NeT calibration system [90] will be able to
significantly improve on this knowledge.

The major uncertainty in the response of a DOM to incident photons is the total effective
area, Aeff , to Cherenkov photons. This is modelled in GEANT simulations with a high degree
of accuracy, as described in [35], and has been measured using K40 coincidences in situ with
a precision of ∼1% [3]. In order to model a significant effect, simulations were produced with
Aeff varied by ±10% for all photon wavelengths and incident angles.

The effects of these systematic uncertainties on reconstruction accuracy are summarised
in table 7, showing the change in reconstruction variables for each percent systematics
uncertainty. The most significant effect for the cascade channel is on the energy
reconstruction due to a change in labs, since in the high-energy regime, only after a large
distances do PMTs cease to become saturated, so that the energy reconstruction depends on
the response after several absorption lengths. In no case was the direction reconstruction
affected, since the Cherenkov peak (which contains most of the directional information)
remains unobscured by these effects.

In the case of muon reconstruction, changes in absorption and PMT efficiency have
similar effects on energy reconstruction, which is smaller than in the case of cascade
reconstruction due to the inherent uncertainties. Systematic effects on direction reconstruction
depends on the muon (∼neutrino) energy. The difference in the track direction w.r.t. the

standard value is constant above »1 TeV (values quoted in the table), and increases with
decreasing energy below 1 TeV (» - 0.1 0.2 at 100 GeV) as expected, since here the
reconstruction is photon-limited. Unlike the case of cascade reconstruction, an increase in
water quality, or a larger effective area of the PMTs, improves the directional reconstruction,
by increasing the number of Cherenkov photons directly reaching the PMTs.

The effects given in table 7 describe the best estimates of future systematic effects as a
function of future uncertainties in the quantities shown. Another relevant measure is: what
range of future performances of ARCA is possible given the current uncertainties in these
parameters? For this, the systematic effects above were propagated through the simulation
chain, allowing reconstructions, cuts, etc, to be re-optimised, i.e. assuming the new value of
the changed parameter is known. Effects were analysed in the context of the diffuse flux
search using cascades, and the RX J1713 source search using the track channel. Results are
given in table 8. Note that for the diffuse analyses, the effects are small, since detection
efficiency to both signal and background are affected equally.

3.4.2. Detector calibration and alignment. The suite of calibration and alignment systems
described in [90] have a finite accuracy, and differences from the true DOM positions and
orientations might reduce the precision of reconstruction.

Due to the mechanical structure of KM3NeT DUs, the major degrees of freedom for
DOM motion are the position in the horizontal plane, and rotation about the vertical axis. The
accuracy of acoustic positioning (position in the horizontal plane) is expected to be 20cm
(corresponding to a hit time uncertainty of about 1 ns in water), while the internal compass for
each DOM will measure the rotation angle to within 3°.

To simulate each effect, a false detector was generated with each DOM randomly
deviated using Gaussian distributions of width equal to the expected accuracies above, and
these were used by reconstruction routines on events generated with the standard simulation
chain.

No detectable effects were observed in the accuracy of either the cascade or track
reconstruction. This is partially due to the accuracy of the calibrations, partially the uniform
coverage of the DOMs (which make errors in the pointing direction less relevant), and
partially the robust nature of the reconstruction algorithms themselves. In the case of
orientation angle, the uncertainty was artificially increased until, at 9° (three times the
expected uncertainty), negligible degradation (too small to be measured) in the angular
reconstruction accuracy of track-like events was observed. Hence, no further investigation
was undertaken.

Note. E.g., a reduction in labs of 10% is expected to increase the one-year s5 discovery flux of the
diffuse cascade analysis by 3.5%.

55



3.4.3. Ageing effects. As KM3NeT ages, some loss of performance due to the degradation or
loss of key parts is expected. The effects of PMT ageing are covered by the Aeff estimate
above. An additional simulation was performed to estimate the effect of both lost DOMs and
entire DUs, with the standard simulation re-run once with a random 10% sample of DOMs
turned off, and once with DUs randomly removed. The effects on both reconstruction and
future sensitivity were estimated assuming that the failed units were known, which will be the
case due to continual monitoring. The results are shown in tables 7 and 8. In general, the
effects are most important for low-energy muon tracks.

3.5. Detector geometry studies

The chosen geometry of KM3NeT ARCA building blocks, with approximately 90 m hor-
izontal spacing between DUs, and 36 m vertical spacing between DOMs, was optimised in
preliminary studies to target Galactic sources such as RX J1713. While some limits on the
final layout are imposed through engineering considerations—in particular, the maximum
length of DUs—the horizontal spacing between DUs can be increased or decreased within a
relatively broad range. The discovery by IceCube of a diffuse flux extending above 100 TeV
[12] now motivates revisiting the question of the optimal horizontal spacing. In particular, a
larger spacing would be expected to be more optimal when targeting high-energy events.

In order to characterise the effects of a larger spacing, the analyses described above have
also been performed by considering a detector block with 120 m spacing between the DUs,
giving an approximate 78% increase in detector volume. The results are tentative since the
analyses have not been fully re-optimised to the alternative geometry. Non-etheless, the
change in performance gives an indication of the utility of increasing the horizontal spacing.

These tentative results are summarised in table 9. They have been performed with 10% of
the data set, using the fast cut-and-count method. An improvement of about 20%–30% in the
discovery flux is observed in the search for a diffuse flux for both channels for the detector
layout with increased string spacing. Note that in the cascade channel the sensitivity gain is
significantly below the increase of the instrumented volume; one of the reasons is a decrease
of the signal detection and reconstruction efficiency with increasing string distances. For
Galactic sources, which present a lower neutrino energy spectrum, the change is of the same
order, but as expected, in the reversed direction.

It is therefore expected that the final optimum, taking into account all channels and their
physics priorities, is in or close to the range explored in this first geometry investigation.
Clearly, the choice of optimum configuration depends on the targeted science goals—a larger

spacing is better for high-energy diffuse fluxes, and smaller spacings for point-like sources
with a low-energy cutoff. Given that ARCA is in a unique position to study Galactic point-
like sources of neutrinos, and that the detection of such sources is the most challenging of the
sensitivity studies presented here (see figure 42), the 90 m horizontal spacing has been
retained for the two ARCA building blocks in KM3NeT Phase-2.0.

4. Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss

4.1. Introduction

Important progress has been made in the past two decades on determining the fundamental
properties of neutrinos. A variety of experiments using solar, atmospheric, reactor and
accelerator neutrinos, spanning energies from a fraction of MeV to tens of GeV, have pro-
vided compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations, implying the existence of non-zero
neutrino masses (see e.g. [91] and the review by Nakamura and Petcov in [92] for recent
insights on the subject).

In the standard n3 scheme, the mixing of the neutrino flavour eigenstates (ne, nm, nt) into
the mass eigenstates (n1, n2, n3) is described by the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata
(PMNS) matrix U which is a product of three rotation matrices related to the mixing angles
q12, q13 and q23 and to the complex CP phase

Oscillation experiments are not sensitive to the absolute value of neutrino masses but they

while the other impacts the atmospheric neutrino sector (D ´ -m 2.5 10 eVatm
2 3 2).

At present, the values of all mixing angles and squared-mass differences in the n3
oscillation scheme can be extracted from global fits of available data with a precision better
than 15%, the largest remaining uncertainty being currently on qsin2 23 and its possible octant
(i.e. whether q23 is smaller or larger than p 4) [93–95]. Table 10 summarises the best fit
values of the oscillation parameters and the associated s3 uncertainties as published in [93]58.

The recent observation of ne disappearance in several short-baseline reactor experiments
[96–98] has provided the first high-significance measurement of the mixing angle q13 which
drives the n n-m e transition amplitude with large mass splitting. The relatively large value of
this parameter, q sin 2 0.12 13( ) , is an asset for the subsequent searches for the remaining
major unknowns in the neutrino sector, and in particular for the determination of the NMH.

The ordering of neutrino mass eigenstates has indeed not been determined so far. After
fixingD = D >m m 021

2 2
sol( ) , two solutions remain possible depending on the sign of Dm31

2 :
the normal hierarchy (NH: < <m m m1 2 3) and the inverted hierarchy (IH: < <m m m3 1 2),
as can be seen from figure 46.

From a theoretical point of view, the determination of the NMH is of fundamental
importance to constrain the models that seek to explain the origin of mass in the leptonic
sector and the differences in the mass spectrum of charged quarks and leptons [99]. More
practically, it has also become a primary experimental goal because the NMH can have a
strong impact on the potential performances of next-generation experiments with respect to
the determination of other unknown parameters such as the CP phase δ (related to the
presence of CP-violating processes in the leptonic sector), the absolute value of the neutrino
masses, and their Dirac or Majorana nature (as probed in neutrinoless double beta decay
experiments, or nbb0 ). From the astrophysical point of view, the NMH impacts, e.g., neutrino
flavour conversion in supernovae [100, 101]. Finally, the NMH also affects the precise

determination of the PMNS matrix parameters, as can be seen from table 10, which sum-
marises the current best fit values and their 3σ uncertainties under both hierarchy hypotheses.

While the combination of nbb0 and direct neutrino mass experiments with cosmological
constraints on Sn nm might have an indirect sensitivity to the NMH, most of the efforts
currently focus on the determination of NMH via neutrino oscillation experiments (see e.g.
section 3.1 of [91] for an overview of the subject). One option uses medium-baseline
(∼50 km) reactor experiments such as JUNO and RENO-50, which probe the ne oscillation
probability at low energies (∼MeV) where matter effects are negligible [102]. These
experiments may be sensitive to the NMH through the interference effects arising from the
combination of the fast oscillations driven byDm31

2 andDm32
2 . Such a measurement however

requires an extreme accuracy both in the energy resolution and in the absolute energy scale
calibration.

Another appealing strategy consists in probing the impact of matter effects in both the nm
survival probability and in the rate of n n«m e appearance at the atmospheric mass scale. As
will be detailed in the next subsection, this option requires long oscillation baselines and
matter effects that essentially affect the ne-component of the propagation eigenstates, making
it possible to determine whether the n1 and n2 states are lighter or heavier than n3. The ne
appearance channel is the main focus of current (such as NOvA [103] and T2K [104]) and
next-generation (such as CHIPS [105], LBNE [106], LBNO [107] or more recently DUNE
[108]) accelerator neutrino experiments. In atmospheric experiments, such as ICAL at INO
[109], Hyper-Kamiokande [110], PINGU [111] and ORCA, both channels are important due
to the much longer baselines providing stronger matter effects. This strategy has been
extensively discussed both for magnetised detectors [112–124] and for water-Cherenkov
detectors [118, 125–131], including more recently the specific case of the Mton-scale
underice/sea detectors PINGU and ORCA [132–143].

In the n3 framework, the n n«m e and n n«m m transition probabilities in vacuum can be

where Eν is the neutrino energy and L stands for the oscillation baseline. These relations
establish the direct link between the transition probabilities and the value of q ;13 they also
show that the transitions in vacuum are actually insensitive to the sign of Dm31

2 .
This sign can however be revealed once matter effects come into play along the neutrino

propagation path [144, 145]. Contrarily to the other flavours, the ne component can indeed
undergo CC elastic scattering interactions with the electrons in matter and consequently
acquire an effective potential = A G N2 eF , where Ne is the electron number density of the
medium, GF is the Fermi constant and the + -( ) sign is for ne (ne). In the case of neutrinos
propagating in a medium with constant density, the transition probabilities now read (adapted

where A is positive for neutrinos and negative for antineutrinos. Both the amplitude and the

happens for the case of the NH (IH) in the neutrino (antineutrino) channel at the energy:

where ρ is the matter density of the medium. For neutrinos passing through the Earth’s mantle
(core) the resonance will appear around 7 GeV (3 GeV), which explains why atmospheric
neutrinos are an appropriate probe for these effects, in association with the large baselines
available.

As an illustration, oscillation curves n n mP x( ) (x = e, μ) obtained with the ORCA
software tools (using the PREM model [147] of the Earth density layers) are shown in
figure 47 for various zenith angles θ (i.e. various baselines) as a function of the neutrino
energy, both for neutrinos and antineutrinos. In each case, both NMH hypotheses are
represented. The strongest impact of the NMH to the oscillation probabilities is in the
resonance region ~ -nE 4 8( ) GeV. In the region q -cos 0.85 and <nE 7GeV, the effect
of the resonant enhancement of the oscillations [112, 125–127, 133, 148–156] for the neu-
trino trajectories crossing the Earth’s core can also be seen. Above ∼15 GeV, the n n me

transition probability becomes very small and differences from distinct NMHs tend to dis-
appear as well59.

Figure 47 shows that to first order, the effect for neutrinos in the NH scheme is the same
as for antineutrinos in the IH scheme. Nevertheless, and even in the case of non-magnetised
detectors (such as ORCA) which do not distinguish νʼs and nʼs event-by-event, a net
asymmetry in the combined (n n+ ) event rates between NH and IH for a given flavour can
be observed. This mainly comes from the fact that in the GeV energy range relevant for
atmospheric neutrinos, the CC cross section is different (by about a factor of 2) for neutrinos
and antineutrinos, as can be seen from figure 48. The relative contribution of ne and nm in the
steeply falling atmospheric neutrino spectrum, as shown in figure 49, also affects the number
of events of each flavour that can be expected at the detector level.

Convoluting the oscillation probabilities with the atmospheric neutrino fluxes and the
neutrino-nucleon cross section, one can construct bidimensional plots of event rates as a
function of the neutrino energy Eν and cosine of the zenith angle θ. Such an ‘oscillogram’ is
represented in figure 50 for n n+m m, for both NMH hypotheses. Integrating over energies
above 4 GeV, one typically expects of the order of 4650 nm-induced events and 2850
ne-induced events per year in a 1Mton detector. The phase space region where the differences
between NH and IH are most visible clearly depends on the three ingredients mentioned here
above; but other factors also come into play, related both to intrinsic effects (such as the
physics of the neutrino interaction) and to the detector performance (such as energy and
angular resolutions), that will blur the oscillogram patterns and partly wash out the asymmetry
effect.

An intrinsic uncertainty in the neutrino energy and direction arises from the kinematics of
the neutrino interaction. At the relevant energies, the out-coming lepton can no longer be
considered as collinear with its parent neutrino, as can be seen from60 figure 51. This
smearing can conveniently be expressed in terms of the Bjorken inelasticity parameter

antineutrinos (right) for (anti)neutrino energies of 10 GeV. The distributions are

59
This justifies the approximation of a two-flavour n nm t oscillation scheme adopted by high-energy atmospheric

neutrino experiments so far [157, 158].
60

Note that the angle and energy resolutions can be improved by combining information from the leptonic and
hadronic parts of the interaction to better reconstruct the kinematics.

where l stands for a charged lepton and which represents the fraction of energy transferred to
the associated hadronic shower. Since the cross section for neutrino and antineutrino behave
differently as a function of y, measuring the inelasticity of the neutrino interaction could
provide some statistical separation between the ν and n channels and therefore enhance the
sensitivity to the NMH [135]. This effect could be best exploited in the muon channel, where
the lepton track and the hadronic shower can in principle be more easily identified than in the
other channels; the difference in the muon angular spread for 10 GeV nm and nm is illustrated in
figure 52. Preliminary studies performed for ORCA using flavour identification tools are
presented in section 4.5 and could be the starting point for a statistical separation between nmʼs
and nmʼs, providing additional enhancement of the sensitivity to NMH in the track and in the
shower channel.

The kinematic smearing described here is only one among other sources of systematics
directly related to the physical processes at play; fluctuations in the development of the
particle cascades, and in the production and propagation of the associated Cherenkov light,
must also be taken into account. These effects are discussed in more detail in [160].

Uncertainties in the neutrino oscillation parameters can also degrade the sensitivity to the
NMH. These uncertainties are taken into account when evaluating the ORCA sensitivity to
the NMH (see section 4.6.1). Other sources of systematics such as the uncertainties on the
atmospheric spectra, the uncertainties of the Earth matter density profile, or the unknown dCP
phase are further discussed in section 4.6.8. Detector-related effects, and in particular the
energy and angular resolution, are presented along with the description of the event selection
and reconstruction performances in section 4.3.

In order to identify, for each flavour, the phase space region where the effects are larger
and therefore the discrimination more powerful, asymmetry variables can be defined such as

where NNH and NIH are the number of expected events at a given angle and energy for NH
and IH respectively.¢ essentially reflects the asymmetry of oscillation probabilities and does
not depend on the effective mass of the detector, while is useful to provide an estimation of
the significance of the hierarchy measurement by summing over all oscillogram entries, as
proposed by [132]. This approach should however be taken with care as it typically
overestimates the discrimination power of the experiment. Alternative approaches discussed
in [140, 161–163], and providing a more rigorous statistical treatment, are followed in
section 4.6.

An example of asymmetry plots (following the definition of equation (19)) for nm and ne
obtained with ORCA software tools and a smearing on energy and angle is shown in
figure 53. It is clear that the region where the asymmetry is more evident is above 5 GeV. The
plots also indicate that comparable levels of asymmetry are reached in both nm and ne CC
interaction channels. Most first-stage studies have concentrated on the nm channel (and on the
detection of the associated muon) to determine the sensitivity to NMH, anticipating on the
larger statistics in the muon channel and the worse angular resolution of deep sea (/ice)
Cherenkov detectors for shower-like events (as produced by ne) [111, 131, 132, 134, 136].

In the course of the study it has however been pointed out that this approach may have
been too conservative and that the shower channel, and in particular the ne-induced events,
could also provide a significant contribution to the total sensitivity to NMH61. To first order,
the atmospheric flux of ne of energy Eν which reach the detector after crossing the Earth along
a given trajectory, qFn nE ,e ( ) is given by [126, 127]:

As can be seen from figure 49, the ratio r is close to 2 around 2 GeV and below, which
tends to suppress the oscillations. This is referred to as the ‘screening effect’ in [132].
However, in the energy range of a few GeV the ratio increases, which could on the contrary
enhance the asymmetry as stated in [133]. The final asymmetry level in the ne channel will
also depend on the value of the mixing angle q ;23 it could in particular be further enhanced if
q23 is found to be in the second octant (i.e. q > 4523 ). The status of electron neutrino studies
within ORCA is summarised in section 4.4.

61
Experiments like Super-Kamiokande and the proposed Hyper-Kamiokande have indeed mainly focused on the

electron neutrino channel, because of the good resolutions they can achieve for this topology in the few GeV energy
range [110, 164].

4.2. Simulations

4.2.1. Benchmark detector. The detector geometry used in the MC simulations for
KM3NeT/ORCA follows the design as described in section 2.2. The simulated ORCA
detector corresponds to one building block of 115 string DUs with 18 DOMs each. The
DOMs are made of glass spheres that are designed to resist the hydrostatic pressure of the
deep sea environment, each one containing 31 PMTs of 3 inch diameter and the related
electronics.

The ORCA simulated detector characteristics rely on reasonable assumptions based on
the expertise acquired in the KM3NeT collaboration. To reduce the energy threshold, both the
vertical and the horizontal spacing must be reduced with respect to the high-energy KM3NeT
design (KM3NeT/ARCA). Vertically this can essentially be done at will whereas
horizontally there are limitations due to the deformation of the lines by the sea currents
and the unfurling procedure of the strings. For a line with 6 m vertical spacing and 18
modules the maximum deviation at the top of the line is about 10 m (corresponding to a sea
current of about 30 cm s−1). In addition, the accuracy with which a string can be placed on the
sea bottom is from ANTARES experience a few meters. A 20 m distance is therefore assumed
to be feasible.

The collaboration therefore decided to start the simulation study with a detector
consisting of 2070 optical modules distributed on 115 DUs placed at a distance of about 20 m
from each other (accounting for the positioning uncertainty at deployment), in a circular
pattern of radius 106 m (figure 54). The detector is located at the KM3NeT-France site
(2450 m depth). The DUs host 18 DOMs with 6 m vertical spacing. In this geometry, the first
floor is 50 m distant from the seabed and the detector has a total instrumented volume of
about ´3.6 10 m6 3 (equivalent to ∼3.7 Mt for sea water). Larger vertical inter-DOM
spacings have been investigated as well using a masking technique described insection 4.2.4.
The results obtained in terms of detector performances for the NMH discrimination indicate
an optimum inter-DOM distance of about 9 m (see section 4.6.1).

4.2.2. Event generation and characterisation. This section describes the software packages
used for the generation of MC events. Additionally, a selection of event observable
distributions is used to characterise their typical fundamental and detector physics
phenomenology.

The employed software packages generate atmospheric muons and atmospheric
neutrinos. Several codes have been developed for the KM3NeT project and older codes,
that were developed by the ANTARES collaboration, have been modified to take into account
the KM3NeT DOM characteristics. The codes simulate the particle interactions with the
medium surrounding the detector, light generation and propagation as well as the detector
response. In the simulation chain a volume surrounding the instrumented volume, called
‘can’, is defined. The can volume is a cylinder with height and radius exceeding the
instrumented volume by about 3 absorption lengths for the atmospheric muon background
simulation and by 40 m for the neutrino generation. Generated particles are propagated inside
the can and Cherenkov light is generated.

Neutrino and antineutrino induced interactions in sea water in the energy range from 1 to
100 GeV have been generated with a software package based on the widely used GENIE
[165–167] neutrino event generator. Electron and muon neutrino events are weighted to
reproduce the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux following the Bartol model [168].

All particles emerging from a neutrino interaction vertex are propagated with the
GEANT4 based software package KM3SIM [169] that has been developed by the KM3NeT
collaboration. It generates Cherenkov light from primary and secondary particles in showers
and simulates hits taking into account the light absorption and scattering in water as well as
the DOM and PMT characteristics.

The background due to down-going atmospheric muons is generated with the MUPAGE
[29, 170] program. MUPAGE provides a parameterised description of the underwater flux of
atmospheric muons including also multi-muon events. The parameterised muon flux was
obtained starting from full simulations with HEMAS [171] and CR data. These muons are
tracked inside the can with the code KM3 which generates and propagates the light produced
by the muons and their secondary particles, taking into account the optical properties of the
water. For the photon propagation, the code uses tables containing parameterisations obtained

number of PMTs with hits (left) and DOMs with at least one hit (right) generated by a

from a full GEANT3 simulation. The code simulates the PMT hit probabilities and the
response of the PMTs. The PMT photocathode area, QE and angular acceptance, as well as
the transmission of light in the optical module glass sphere and in the optical gel are taken
into account.

In order to reproduce the randomly distributed background PMT hits due to the
Cherenkov light from β-decays of 40K, single photoelectron hits can be added to the hits
induced by charged particles inside a chosen time window. Also the hits in coincidence due to
40K between two PMTs inside the same DOM are taken into account.

First measurements of the optical background rate indicate a single PMT noise rate of
8 kHz and twofold coincidence noise of about 340 Hz, for details see [5]. For the simulation
results described below a conservative optical background light estimation has been used. An
uncorrelated hit rate of 10 kHz per PMT and time-correlated noise on each DOM (500 Hz
twofold, 50 Hz threefold, 5 Hz fourfold and 0.5 Hz fivefold) was added. The simulated time-
correlated noise rates due to 40K decays have been verified with a complete simulation based
on GEANT4.

Figure 55 shows linearly increasing distributions of the total number of hit PMTs and
DOMs as a function of the muon energy for events for which almost all produced light is
contained within the instrumented volume. Also shown is a comparison of the simulated light
yield for the older KM3 and the more recent KM3SIM code. Both simulations agree
quantitatively very well. Roughly 15 detected photons, i.e. PMT hits, and eight different hit
DOMs can be expected per GeV of a contained muon. About 2/3 of the DOMs are hit by
scattered light, 1/3 by direct light, while 40% of all hit PMTs register unscattered light.

Figure 56 compares the number of hit PMTs (DOMs) due to the Cherenkov light
emission from a muon, an electromagnetic and a hadronic shower as a function of their
respective energy. An electromagnetic shower will cause roughly 12 hits per GeV while a
hadronic shower is, as can be expected due to the Cherenkov thresholds of the comparably
massive hadrons involved, much dimmer with seven hits per GeV, i.e. an electromagnetic
shower of about 5 GeV energy is almost as bright as a hadronic shower with 10 GeV. The
DOM hit multiplicity scales in a similar manner, but somewhat more favourably for hadronic
showers due to the on average greater opening angle as compared to electron positron pair
cascades.

The inelasticity parameter y of a neutrino interaction on the nucleon critically determines
the reaction kinematics as can be seen in figures 57 and 52. At energies below 10 GeV the
different strengths of the different interaction channels, quasi-elastic, resonant and deep
inelastic, are visible in the y-distributions and result in a higher average inelasticity for

neutrinos (< > »y 0.5) compared to antineutrinos (< > »y 0.35). The scattering angle fn m,
between the incoming neutrino and the outgoing muon shows a strong dependency and
increase with increasing reaction inelasticity. The lower average inelasticity for antineutrinos
leads to on average also lower scattering angles. This indicates the discrimination potential of
this parameter and the importance to get access through event reconstruction.

4.2.3. Muons from hadronic showers. Employing detailed GEANT3 based simulations, the
muon production within the hadronic shower has been studied. A significant contribution of
muons with path lengths in excess of the hadronic shower extension, i.e. with energies of at
least one or several GeV, could complicate and probably deteriorate the particle flavour
identification capabilities (see section 4.5). However, as is shown in [172] and summarised in
the following, GeV muons from hadronic showers affect only about 1% of the events.

In figure 58 the Cherenkov photon emission positions along and perpendicular to the
hadronic shower direction are shown for simulated shower energies of »E 5 GeVhad (left)
and »E 20 GeVhad (right). Each Cherenkov photon is weighted with its wavelength
dependent detection probability taking into account the PMT QEs and the absorption and
scattering in sea water. In total 3400 (4000) ne CC events with < <nE8 GeV 12
( < <nE30 GeV 50) are used to extract and superimpose their hadronic showers. For both
cases only a few muon tracks can be seen to emit light significantly beyond the hadronic
shower extension.

Most muons in the hadronic shower come from pion decays. However, pions with
energies in the GeV range will likely interact before they decay, as the hadronic interaction
length for pions in water is approximately 1 m. In order to study the muon production from
charged pions in greater detail, 104 charged pions with energies of =pE 2, 5, 10 GeV have
been simulated in sea water. The mean number of muons mN⟨ ⟩ and the fraction of simulated
events with at least one muon mN 1 are summarised in table 11. The energy spectrum and
cumulative energy distribution of the most energetic muon is shown in figure 59. For all three
pion energies the fraction of events producing a muon with more than 1 GeV (2 GeV) is
below 2% (1%).

energetic muon from charged pion p simulations with energies of

visible at »mE 250 MeV is due to the decay of kaons produced at rest in pion induced
hadronic interactions.

4.2.4. Implementation of different vertical spacings. Different detector configurations have
been investigated with the same footprint as the benchmark detector (see figure 54) but
different vertical spacings: 6, 9, 12 and 15 m. All these configurations rely on the same
simulation of the neutrino signal, performed on the benchmark detector described in
section 4.2.1. The different vertical spacings are achieved by masking parts of the detector:

• for 6 m vertical spacing, all simulated DOMs in the benchmark detector are used;
• for 9 m vertical spacing, every third DOM on each DU is masked, thus alternating vertical
spacings of 6 and 12 m. The DUs are masked in three different schemes (1st scheme:
masking DOM 1, 4, ...; 2nd scheme: masking DOM 2, 5, ...; and 3rd scheme: masking
DOM 3, 6, ...);

• for 12 m vertical spacing, every second DOM on each DU is masked;
• for 15 m vertical spacing, five different masking schemes are used that alternate vertical
spacings of 1 and 18 m.

In the 9 and 15 m configurations, neighbouring DUs use different masking schemes in
order to make the masked detector as homogeneous as possible. Doing so the instrumented
volume stays the same for all detector configurations, but the DOM density changes. In order
to compare the effective volume of the different detector configurations assuming the same

number of DOMs for each vertical spacing, the effective volumes of the masked detectors are
scaled accordingly (factor of 1/1.5/2/2.5).

It should also be noted that the surface to volume ratio for the masked detectors is larger
than it would be for a full detector with 18 DOMs per DU. Therefore, the presented results
overestimate possible surface-related effects.

4.2.5. Triggering. As described in section 2.6.1, muon and shower events are extracted from
the real-time data stream using causality conditions. In the case of ORCA, with a simulated
10 kHz uncorrelated single noise rate per PMT and about 500 Hz time-correlated noise from
40K decays on each DOM, the estimated L1 rate (coincidences on the same DOM in a short
time-window) per optical module is about 1.5 kHz.

The trigger algorithms described in section 2.6.1 were optimised for ORCA by
considering the effective volume and the event purity. The effective volume is the volume in
which a neutrino interaction would trigger the event to be written to disk and the event purity
is the fraction of triggered events that contain a neutrino interaction or at least one
atmospheric muon. The trigger rate from neutrino interactions is  mHz( ) and is negligible
compared to the rate from atmospheric muons ( 40 Hz( )).

The trigger settings correspond to a L1 time window of D =T 10 ns, a maximum angle
between the PMT axes of 90°(L2), and a minimum number of L1 hits of three for the shower
trigger and four for the muon trigger62. Both triggers run in parallel and one of them or both
must fire to flag an event (logical OR). For the different considered vertical spacings the
distance parameters (R and D) of the muon and shower triggers have been adjusted such that

Muon and shower triggers with larger minimum numbers of L1 hits in conjunction with larger distance

parameters R and D have also been studied. However, these triggers show smaller effective volumes than those used
in this document.

72



each of the triggers has a rate of ~10 Hz from pure noise. Note that this adds up to a rate of
∼20Hz from pure noise for both triggers. The rate of atmospheric muon events is evaluated at
a depth of 2450 m using the simulations described in section 4.2 and amounts to about 36 Hz
(6 m) – 55 Hz (15 m) depending on the vertical spacing of the ORCA detector.

In order to estimate the trigger rates, dedicated simulations for each vertical spacing have
been performed, i.e. the detector masking described in section 4.2.4 has not been applied.
Trigger rates from pure noise and atmospheric muons are summarised in table 12 for the
various vertical spacings. The trigger event purity is 65%–73%.

It should be noted that during periods of high bioluminescence [9], the trigger conditions
(minimum number of L1 hits and distance parameters R and D) can be tightened in order to
reduce the output data rate and match the available data transfer bandwidth.

The effective volume at trigger level for 6 m vertical spacing is shown for different
neutrino flavours in figure 60 (left) as a function of neutrino energy. Events are weighted to
reproduce the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux following the Bartol model [168] and
only up-going neutrinos are considered. The effective volume is smaller for and
than for events as the outgoing neutrinos are invisible to the detector. For n me,¯ CC
events the effective volume is larger than for n me, CC due to the lower average inelasticity and
the resulting higher average light yield (at the considered energies hadronic showers have a
smaller average light yield than electromagnetic showers). The effective volume depends also
on the neutrino direction as figure 60 (right) shows for ne CC events. Other neutrino flavours
exhibit a similar zenith angle dependency. For vertical up-going events ( q » -ncos 1) the
effective volume rises more steeply with energy than for horizontal events ( q »ncos 0) as
more PMTs are oriented downward than upward in an DOM and the density of DOMs is
higher in vertical than in horizontal direction.

The effective volumes at trigger level for and events for different vertical
spacings are shown in figure 61 as a function of neutrino energy. For 9 m, 12 m and 15 m
vertical spacing the simulation of the benchmark detector with a 6 m spacing is masked and
the resulting effective volumes are scaled to the same number of DOMs per DU as described
in section 4.2.4. Further details on the triggering studies can be found in [172].

4.3. Muon neutrino studies

This section presents the strategy adopted to reconstruct muon neutrino CC events with
ORCA, and its current performance. All results shown in this section are based on the MC
simulations presented in the previous sections.

4.3.1. Muon direction reconstruction. The track reconstruction algorithm presented here
permits to estimate muon (and consequently neutrino) directions using the combined
information of the PMT spatial positions and the Cherenkov photon arrival times. The
reconstruction code used is based on the strategy developed for the ANTARES telescope and
described in reference [173]. This algorithm has been modified to exploit the multi-PMT
peculiarities taking into account the directional sensitivity of the KM3NeT optical module.

After an initial hit selection, requiring space–time coincidences between hits, the
reconstruction proceeds through four consecutive fitting procedures, each using the result of
the previous one as starting point. Each fitting stage improves the result, but the last fit
produced, that provides the most accurate result, works well only if the input parameters of
the muon track are not too far from the true track parameters. Moreover, the efficiency of the
algorithm is improved with a scanning of the entire sky in steps of 3° starting from the prefit
track, thus generating 7200 tracks. A scheme of the overall procedure is shown in figure 62.

As described in section 4.2, the optical background induced by 40K decays has been
simulated adding an uncorrelated hit rate of 10kHz per PMT and a time-correlated hit rate of
500Hz per DOM (two coincident hits in different PMTs inside the same DOM). To remove
the hits from 40K decays, the requirement of space–time coincidences between hits is used,
since hits due to optical background are mostly uncorrelated.

In particular, the hit selection proceeds by first selecting all the local coincidences, i.e.
coincidences of hits within the same DOM, in a time window of 10ns and for which the
PMTs involved are less than 90° apart. Among them, a cluster is selected such that any hit in
the cluster is causally related to all the remaining ones, according to the following causality
relation:

D < +t d c 20 ns, 23water∣ ∣ ( )

whereDt is the time difference between the two hits, d is the distance between the two PMTs
and cwater is the group velocity of light in water. The cluster of hits obtained is further
extended by including the yet unselected hits which fulfil all the following conditions:

algorithm as a function of the interacting neutrino energy.

74



• are causally connected to at least 75% of all the hits in the cluster,
• are closer than 50 m to at least 40% of all the hits in the cluster,
• are all causally connected among them. The latter extension procedure is iterated twice.
The resulting performance of the hit selection for nm-CC events in terms of efficiency and
purity is shown in figure 63, where the efficiency is the fraction of signal hits selected
among all the signal hits, whereas the purity is the fraction of signal hits among all the
selected ones. The resulting set of hits is referred to as Selected hits in the following.

The Selected hits serve as input of the first step of the track reconstruction procedure,
referred to as ‘linear prefit’, which is a linear fit through the positions of the hits. Once a first
estimate of the track is obtained, the evaluation for each hit of the expected angle of incidence
qi of the photon on the PMT is possible. An ‘angular selection’ is then applied discarding all
the hits with q > -cos 0.5i . The prefit is then repeated with the new hit set.

Additional starting tracks are obtained by rotating the prefit track by step of 3 over the
whole sky. For each starting track, the two fits called M-estimator fit and Pdf fit are
performed. These fits are based on the maximum likelihood method and use PDFs that
depend on the time residuals, i.e. the difference between the time of the hits and the expected
times according to the track hypothesis and Cherenkov light emission.

The M-estimator fit, is a maximum likelihood fit based on a function that describes the
data for small time residuals. The behaviour of this function for large residuals is a trade-off
between a reproduction of the data and the ease of finding the global maximum. The input set
of hits, called M-estim hits is chosen among the Selected hits with conditions on the time
residual and the orthogonal distance from the starting track and discarding all hits with

q > -cos 0.5i . The PDF used for the Pdf fit has been parameterised by fitting a set of spectra
obtained from MC simulations of muons traversing the detector without including
background hits. The input track is the track resulting from the M-estimator fit and the
input hits are chosen among the M-estim hits with conditions on the time residual and the
orthogonal distance from the M-estimator track and discarding all hits with q > -cos 0.5i .
Once the fitting procedures are performed for each starting direction, the solution with the
highest likelihood per degree of freedom is chosen as the best one. A further adjustment of the
track direction is then achieved with the Final fit, using the best track as starting point. This fit
relies on the maximum likelihood method and the PDF is obtained taking into account the
contributions from both the background hits and the signal hits. The quality of the final
reconstructed track is estimated by the quantity:

-N 5

( )

where Nhits is the number of hits used in the final fit and  is the maximum value of the
likelihood.

4.3.2. Neutrino energy estimate. The neutrino energy estimation is performed in two steps:
first the muon energy is estimated by reconstructing the muon track length and the interaction
vertex, then the neutrino energy is estimated depending on the reconstructed muon length and
the number of hits used by the track reconstruction algorithm. These two procedures are
described in detail in the following sections.

4.3.2.1. Reconstruction of the muon track length and the interaction vertex. A dedicated
algorithm for the muon energy estimate has been developed relying on the length of the
reconstructed muon track. In case of events interacting sufficiently close to the instrumented

75



volume, this algorithm also reconstructs the neutrino interaction vertex as the starting point of
the reconstructed muon track.

The estimate of the track length and of the vertex position proceeds through different
phases:

(1) The detected photons are projected back to the track according to the Cherenkov angle.
The first track length estimate, ¢ml is then defined as the distance between the position of
the first and last projected photon on the track. The first projected photon is the first
vertex estimate ¢V . If the muon is generated inside or near the instrumented volume, ¢V is
an estimate of the interaction vertex, otherwise it indicates the first photon seen by the
detector. For these reasons in the following the vertex estimate will be referred to as the
‘pseudo-vertex’ estimate.

(2) Some specific features of the hits from the hadronic shower are identified and used to
select a set of hits around the first pseudo-vertex estimate.

(3) The selected hits are fitted with the hypothesis that they originate isotropically from a
single point. This fit gives a second pseudo-vertex estimate V and a second track length
estimate ml .

(4) The final pseudo-vertex estimate V is chosen between the first and the second according
to the likelihood value of the fit. The corresponding lμ is kept.
In the following each stage is described in details. The reader only interested in the
obtained performances can jump to section 4.3.3.

The procedure to estimate ¢V and ¢ml is sketched in figure 64. It is assumed that the track
direction has already been reconstructed and a subset of hits correlated to the track, called
track-hits, have been selected. From the position Pi and the time ti of each hit, the
corresponding photon emission point ¢Pi and the emission time ¢ti can be easily calculated. The
emission points ¢Pi are ordered on the basis of their occurrence time ¢ti , and the first point ¢P0 is
the first pseudo-vertex estimate ¢V . If ¢Pn is the last emission point identified, ¢ - ¢P Pn 0∣ ∣
corresponds to the first track length estimate ¢ml . Due to the contamination of the optical
background and hadronic shower photons, a strict selection is needed to identify the track-
hits. The following conditions are applied to perform this hit selection:

• a maximum orthogonal distance from the reconstructed track of 50 m;

indicate the reconstructed muon trajectory, the open circles the PMTs which recorded a
hit and the solid dots their projections on the muon trajectory according the Cherenkov
hypothesis.

• a time residual with respect to the reconstructed track in the interval [−10;10] ns;
• q <cos 0i , where qi is the expected angle of incidence of the photon on the PMT
( q = -cos 1i corresponds to a photon hitting head-on the PMT);

• a minimum density of one point ¢Pi for each 2 meters along the track segment ¢ ¢
¾¾
P Pn0 .

The percentage of background hits contained in the set of track-hits is below 2%. The set
of track-hits contains 60%–70% of the total amount of hits coming from the track. On the
other hand, the contamination due to the hits produced by the hadronic shower increases with
the inelasticity y. For low values of y, the largest part of the neutrino energy is transferred to
the muon and almost all the selected hits are hits produced by the true muon track. In this case
the purity of the track-hits reach about 98%. When »y 1 the hadronic shower takes almost
all the neutrino energy and most of the detected hits are due to the shower. Consequently, the
purity of the selection decreases to about 20%, the track length is overestimated and the
estimated vertex position is some meters away from the real interaction vertex. In such a case,
the particles produced at the vertex may even travel backwards with respect to the muon
direction. To overcome this problem, a study of the distribution in time and space of hits
produced at the interaction vertex has been performed, with the goal of identifying specific
features in the reconstruction phase which could be used to distinguish hadronic shower hits
among hits due to the optical background and to the muon.

The parameters analysed are the distance d from the estimated pseudo-vertex to the hit
position, the transverse and longitudinal projection of d with respect to the reconstructed
muon track direction, called k and l respectively. Moreover, the time evolution of the shower

muon track on the left (track hypothesis) and with respect to the reconstructed vertex on
the right (shower hypothesis). For the blue curve, the peak at =timeresidual 0 is less
sharp due to the lower resolution of the vertex reconstruction at low Bjorken y
interactions, caused by the lower amount of light emitted at the interaction vertex.

77



hits can also be studied. Under the simplistic assumption that all the hits are emitted from the
vertex at a time tV, a hit with distance d from the vertex should occur at a time +t d vV , if v
is the speed of light in the medium. A ‘time residual’ can be thus defined as
D = - +t t t d vi V( ), where ti is the time of the hit. Finally, the conditions applied to
select hits from the shower are: <l 120 m, <k 100 m, D <t∣ ∣ 50 ns, and - > -k l k( ) 2. The
first two conditions are intended to reject the optical background hits and identify a region

where the shower is likely to be. The other two are used to distinguish the shower hits from
the hits due to the muon track.

The used cuts are chosen in order to distinguish as much as possible shower hits from
muon and background hits but trying to keep the few hits that are produced by the shower at
low energy. Hits selected in this way are called shower-hits. In this hit set the contamination
due to the background hits is around 2-3%. The purity of the shower-hits increase with the
inelasticity reaching about 75% when ~y 1. The set of shower-hits contains about 50% of
the total number of hits coming from the shower. To find the vertex position a maximum
likelihood fit applied to the selected shower-hits. A function obtained from theDt distribution
for the simulated shower hits is used as PDF and the final estimate of vertex position is chosen
among the first emission point and the result of the fit. Once the vertex has been identified, the
track length is scaled according to the distance from the estimated vertex and the last back
projected photon on the track. The muon energy is estimated as = mE l0.24R

rec GeV, if the
estimated track length ml

rec is expressed in meters.
A selection of the events based on containment conditions is needed for this analysis.

Such conditions are based on the results of the reconstruction. In particular, all the events for
which the muon reconstructed vertex lies within a volume defined by <z 52 m∣ ∣ and
<r 107 m, which roughly corresponds to the instrumented volume, are selected.

4.3.2.2. Bjorken y estimation. The Bjorken y is estimated on the basis of the distribution of
the time residuals of the selected hits (see section 4.3.1) with respect to the reconstructed track
and with respect to the reconstructed vertex, according to a track and a shower hypothesis
respectively (figure 65). The simulated angle between the outgoing muon and the outgoing
hadronic shower flep,had is shown in figure 66 for neutrinos with »nE 10 GeV. The rationale
for this approach relies on the fact that a different repartition of the total neutrino energy
among the hadronic shower and the muon influences the distribution of the time residuals.
The estimation is performed among four Bjorken y intervals: 0–0.25, 0.25–0.50, 0.50–0.75
and 0.75–1. For each interval, the log-likelihood of the time residuals is calculated for a track
hypothesis, if the tested Bjorken y is<0.5, or a shower hypothesis, if the tested Bjorken y is
>0.5. The Bjorken y interval corresponding to the highest likelihood is chosen. The
performance of the algorithm is shown in figure 67.

4.3.2.3. Neutrino energy estimation. The estimation of the neutrino energy is obtained by
combining the estimated track length and estimated Bjorken y with the number of hits used by
the muon track reconstruction. Depending on the reconstructed track length, the true neutrino
energy can be related to the number of hits used by the track reconstruction (nhits

fit ), or
equivalently the number of degrees of freedom of the fit = -nNDoF 5fit hits

between NDoFfit and the energy of the interacting neutrino, for a certain interval of
reconstructed muon track length, is obtained by fitting the median distribution of nE as a
function of NDoFfit. In order to further improve the accuracy, two different estimations are
used, taking into account the reconstructed Bjorken y being higher or lower than 0.5.

4.3.3. Performance. The simulations have been performed with the 3.7 Mt benchmark
detector presented in section 4.2.1. The performances of the reconstruction algorithm have
also been studied with configurations that mimic vertical spacings of 9, 12 and 15 m
according to the masking procedure described in section 4.2.4. The instrumented volume is
the same for all the mentioned configurations.

Figure 68 shows the performances for events reconstructed as up-going, whose vertex is
reconstructed within the instrumented volume, with quality cut of the reconstruction
algorithm of L > -5.0 (see equation (24)). The top left plot shows the median distance
between the true and estimated vertex position, distance P P,vertex

neutrino energy. The value of the distance P P,vertex

vertex

all reconstructed events. The top right plot in figure 68 shows the resolution on the
reconstructed neutrino zenith angle and the bottom plot shows the fractional energy
resolution, which is defined as -n nE E Erec∣ ∣ .

Another parameter needed to evaluate the reconstruction performance as well as to
calculate the sensitivity for the measurement of the NMH is the detector effective volume.
The effective volume Veff can be defined as the volume of a 100% efficient detector for
observing neutrinos that interact within that volume, for a set of specified quality cuts. In the
simulation adopted, described in section 4.2, all the neutrinos interacting within a volume
larger than the instrumented volume and surrounding the detector, that can be referred to as
generation volume Vgen, are kept for the subsequent steps of the simulation and, eventually,
the reconstruction. The effective volume is then obtained by scaling Vgen with the ratio of the
reconstructed events Nrec (or selected according to a given criterion) and the generated events

Assuming a seawater density of 1.025 g cm−3, the effective volume is converted into an
effective mass Meff . The Meff calculated for events with a quality parameter L > -5.0 and
whose vertex is reconstructed within the instrumented volume is plotted in figure 69 as a
function of the neutrino energy and for various intervals of the direction of the incoming
neutrino.

4.4. Electron neutrino studies

This section describes the methodology and performance of a reconstruction strategy that has
been developed for NC and CC shower-like events in ORCA [172]. Electron neutrino events
will play a crucial role for the envisaged mass hierarchy measurement, good angular and
energy resolutions are therefore mandatory.

4.4.1. Phenomenology of shower events. CC interactions of electron (anti)neutrinos with
nucleons constitute a very important signal class for the NMH measurement. They result in a
particle shower:

ð26Þ
where N refers to the target nucleon and h to the hadronic system in the final state. The
outgoing electron initiates an electromagnetic shower while the hadronic system develops
into a hadronic shower with a possibly complex structure of hadronic or electromagnetic sub-
showers, depending on the decay modes of individual particles in the shower.

In the following, the energy Ehad and momentum

by the difference of the respective energy and momentum of the neutrino and the electron:

In events induced by the NC weak interaction of a neutrino on a nucleon only a hadronic
shower is visible.

4.4.1.1. Kinematics. The kinematics for n CCe interactions is similar to that presented in
figure 66. The angle is minimal for y=0.5 with a mean value of roughly 25 . For y 0
( y 1) the angle between the incoming neutrino and the outgoing hadronic shower (lepton)
becomes larger, leading to larger flep,had. For increasing neutrino energies the angle flep,had
becomes smaller.

4.4.1.2. Light production in showers. Some information about the Cherenkov light
production of showers can be found in the literature, e.g. in [174] and references therein.
Mostly, however, previous studies have focused on energies well above those relevant for
ORCA. Therefore, the most important characteristics of showers, as obtained from MC
simulation studies, in the relevant energy range for ORCA are briefly summarised in the
following.

In general, an electromagnetic shower consists of a cascade of e emitting photons via
bremsstrahlung, which interact with matter and again produce e -pairs via pair production.
The evolution of a hadronic shower is similar but the initial particles are hadrons and the
developing cascade will show significantly larger fluctuations as it is dominated by particle

effective area of a PMT for the photon wavelength. The Cherenkov ring from the

the z-direction.

decays. In water the electromagnetic and nuclear interaction lengths are roughly 36 cm and
83 cm [92], respectively. Therefore, compared to muon tracks, showers appear in first
approximation as a point-like burst of light in the detector. The light is emitted by charged
particles with energies above their Cherenkov threshold.

The longitudinal and transverse light emission profile of electromagnetic and hadronic
showers can be seen in figure 70. For the energies of interest the brightest point of a shower is
offset roughly 1–2 m in the shower direction. The longitudinal extension of the showers
increases with Elog( ). In spite of the larger interaction length the longitudinal offset for
hadronic showers is smaller than for electromagnetic showers with the same shower energy

=E Ee had, since they are initiated by several hadrons, each with an energy below Ehad, and
the initial hadrons have different directions reducing the longitudinal extension when
projecting onto the shower axis. The transverse extension of the showers is negligible
compared to the longitudinal.

Although an electromagnetic shower consists of many e -pairs with rather short path
lengths and overlapping Cherenkov cones, the small pair opening angle preserves the
Cherenkov angle peak of the effective angular light distribution which results in a single
Cherenkov ring in a projection onto a plane perpendicular to the shower axis. Similarly, each
hadronic shower particle with energy above the Cherenkov threshold will produce a
Cherenkov ring. Therefore, hadronic showers show a huge variety of different signatures due
to the various possible combinations of initial hadron types, their momenta and the diversity
of their hadronic interactions in the shower evolution.

Two simulated electron neutrino event examples with »nE 10 GeV and »y 0.5 each
are shown in figure 71. The Cherenkov photon ring from the electron is clearly visible
together with fainter rings from hadronic shower particles. Due to the large scattering length
in water, the angular profile of the emitted light is well conserved over large distances, which
leads to the different visible, distinct Cherenkov rings.

While electromagnetic showers show only negligible fluctuations in the number of
emitted Cherenkov photons and in the angular light distribution, hadronic showers show
significant intrinsic fluctuations in the relevant energy range. These intrinsic fluctuations of
hadronic showers and the resulting limitations for the energy and angular resolutions have
been studied in detail, see [160].

In hadronic showers also muons can be produced via charged pions, which can lead to a
wrong flavour classification of the event (see section 4.5). The relevance of muons leaking out
of hadronic showers and their energy distribution has been studied in detail, see section 4.2.3.

The averaged angular light distribution for electromagnetic and hadronic showers is
shown in figure 72 for = =E E 5 GeVe had . For both shower types the probability to detect at
least one photon within one DOM (DOM-hit probability) is maximal at the Cherenkov angle
of 42°, but it is more peaked for electromagnetic than for hadronic showers. At smaller
distances the Cherenkov peak becomes washed out due to the extension of the shower in
conjunction with the small lever arm for the definition of the angle with respect to the shower
direction. Note that the light distribution for a single hadronic shower event will not be as
smooth as shown in these plots due to the distinct Cherenkov rings from each hadron.

4.4.1.3. Sensitivity to the reaction inelasticity y. Electromagnetic and hadronic showers
induced by neutrino interactions in the energy range relevant for the NMH measurement show
slightly different light emission characteristics in the detector. Due to the large scattering
length in water these differences are conserved over sufficiently large distances, so that
information from a large detector volume can contribute to the discrimination between the
two shower types. In electron neutrino CC events, in which both an electromagnetic and a

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

84



hadronic shower are present at the same time and partly overlapping, the angular separation
fe,had of both showers can help to distinguish between them. This can make an estimation of
the reaction inelasticity y in events feasible. Additionally, it might allow for a partial
separation of and NC events on a statistical basis.

However, with an ORCA-like detector63 it seems impossible to distinguish a shower
induced by a single electron from a shower induced by a single hadron, since both resulting
Cherenkov light cones will be of the same intensity for the same particle energy. Figure 71
(bottom) shows a simulated example event, in which the electron ( =E 4.77 GeVe ) and the
pion ( =pE 3.71 GeV) induce Cherenkov rings of similar intensity.

The most intense Cherenkov ring in events is seen in most cases from the electron,
as can be inferred from the distribution of the inelasticity parameter y in section 4.2 and
keeping in mind that the hadronic shower energy Ehad is often shared between many hadrons.
A measure for the intensity of a Cherenkov ring Ex

Generically, the measurable inelasticity y is given by - nE E1 tot

expected that all measured events will show an inelasticity of y 0.8, as nE E 0.2totcher for
all neutrino interaction types (see figure 73). This is even the case for NC events, which are in
principle very similar64 to events with the same neutrino energy as the hadronic energy
in the NC events and an inelasticity of y = 1.

4.4.2. Shower reconstruction algorithm. A neutrino-induced shower-like event is
characterised by 8 free parameters: vertex position


xvtx and time tvtx, energy E, direction eŝ

and inelasticity y. The shower direction is characterised by 2 angles.
The shower reconstruction is performed in two steps. In the first step the vertex is

reconstructed based on the recorded time of the PMT signals, commonly called hits, and in
the second step the direction, energy and inelasticity are reconstructed based on the number of
hits and their distribution in the detector. In both steps a maximum likelihood fit is performed
for many different starting shower hypotheses and the solution with the best likelihood is
chosen.

This factorisation of the fitting procedure works well due to the homogeneity of water
and its large scattering length which allows for a precise vertex reconstruction independent of
the shower direction.

4.4.2.1. Vertex reconstruction. The majority of the Cherenkov light from electromagnetic
and hadronic showers is emitted within a few metres around the neutrino interaction vertex,
see section 4.4.1. Therefore, direct hits from a shower are characterised by a small time
residual tres:

= - -t t t d c , 30res hit vtx water ( )

where d is the distance between the vertex position

xvtx and the PMT position, tvtx is the

vertex time and cwater is the speed of light in water. The vertex position and time are here
defined as the brightest point and its corresponding time in the shower evolution and not by
the neutrino interaction itself, because the brightest point is what is actually seen by the
detector.

The vertex reconstruction is performed in two successive maximum likelihood fits. For
both fits, the likelihood for the vertex hypothesis

The first vertex fit (prefit) is designed to be very robust against noise hits and an
imprecise initial vertex hypotheses. The initial hit selection is optimised for low energetic
shower-like events and is described below together with the choice of the initial vertex
hypothesis. In the prefit, the following function g is used:

= +g t t1 4 ns . 32res res 2( ) ( ) ( )

Based on the initial hit selection in total 15 starting vertex hypotheses for the prefit are
generated. The fitted vertex with the best likelihood is chosen as result of the prefit.

The second vertex fit is more precise but needs a hit selection with higher signal purity
and a good starting vertex hypothesis. The result of the prefit is used to generate in total 10
starting vertex hypotheses (result of the prefit and 9 vertex hypotheses around it with time
shifts of 25 ns and position shifts of 5 m in a random direction). A rather pure signal hit
selection is achieved by selecting hits according to the following criteria:

• < <d10 m 80 m
• - < <t50 ns 50 nsres
• y- < <1 cos 0.1( )

where ψ is the angle between the PMT direction (vector normal to the photocathode plane)
and the vector from the vertex to the PMT, i.e. only PMTs which are orientated towards the
vertex and can be hit by unscattered photons are taken into account. The fit uses a function
g tres( ) obtained from simulated events, and which is dependent on the distance d. Such
distributions are shown for three different distances d in figure 74. With increasing distances
the peak of direct hits becomes broader due to scattering and dispersion, and the hit
probability decreases due to absorption leading to a relative increase of the noise level.

The fitted vertex with the best likelihood and within 10 m and 50 ns around the result of
the prefit is chosen as final vertex.

and the PMT, obtained from simulations of fully contained n CCe and n CCe¯ events with

shower. The distributions are normalised so that the maximum is 1.

87



4.4.2.2. Initial hit selection for first vertex fit. For the initial selection of shower-like hits the
following hit patterns are defined:

L1 coincidence between hit times of two PMTs on the same DOM in a time
window Dt 10 ns.

L2 L1 with an angle between the hit PMTs smaller than 90 , note that these are the same
definition as used in the triggers, see section 4.2.5.

L3 coincidence between hits on three PMTs on the same DOM in a time
window Dt 10 ns.

V2L2 coincidence between two L2 hits on different DOMs which are closer than 35 m and
within a time window D +t t10 ns D, where tD is the time required by the light to
travel the distance D between the two DOMs.

T0L0 coincidence between two hits on adjacent or next-to-adjacent DOMs on the same
string in a time window D +t t10, ns D.

The general strategy is to find first a reference hit that is very likely a signal hit and close
to the neutrino interaction vertex. The position/time of this reference hit is then used as an
initial vertex hypothesis to select additional hits based on their time residual and further
requirements to suppress noise hits.

Firstly, the largest cluster of causally connected L2 hits is selected by requiring
D +t D c 10 nswater for all L1 hits within the cluster. From these causally connected L2

hits the subset of hits that additionally satisfy the L3 or V2L2 criteria is selected. These L3 or
V2L2 hits are ranked according to their hit multiplicity (number of coincidences on the same
DOM) as well as the number and multiplicity of causally connected hits in the vicinity of
25 m. The most signal-like hit is chosen as ‘reference hit’.

Secondly, all hits around the reference hit are selected that are closer than100 m, within a
time window of- < <t250 ns 10 nsres and causally connected with most L3 or V2L2 hits.
The loose lower time cut allows for distances up to about 50 m between the true neutrino
interaction vertex and the reference hit, e.g. because the neutrino interaction is outside the
detector volume. The drawback of this relatively large time window is a contamination with
noise hits. Therefore, hits are discarded that do not satisfy the L1 criterion, or are either
causally connected with an adjacent L3 or V2L2 hit on the same string or fulfil the T0L0
criterion in addition to being causally connected with a L3 or V2L2 hit in the vicinity of 25 m.
The hits selected by this procedure are used in the first vertex fit and the position/time of the
15 most signal-like hits are used as initial vertex hypotheses.

4.4.2.3. Reconstruction of energy, direction and inelasticity. Once the shower vertex is fixed,
the remaining parameters which can be fitted are the shower energy E, direction eŝ and the
reaction inelasticity y. In principle all of these parameters can be inferred from the angular
light distribution (see figure 72): the shape is sensitive to the inelasticity y, the integral is in
first order proportional to the energy (as the light yield is in first order proportional to the
shower energy) and the direction in which this angular light emission profile is present gives
the shower direction.

In the following, the shower energy E, direction eŝ and inelasticity y are reconstructed
using a maximum likelihood fit based on the probability that the hit pattern is created by a
trial shower hypothesis a =

 
t x E y e, , , , svtx vtx( ˆ ).

As discussed in section 4.4.1, the electron mostly is the dominant particle in n CCe events
and produces the brightest Cherenkov ring. Therefore, the reconstruction is designed to find
the electron direction eê and not the neutrino direction.

88



The final hit selection, the definition of the likelihood function and the fitting procedure
are described in the following.

4.4.2.4. Final hit selection. Based on the result of the vertex fit, hits are selected according to
the following criteria:

• < <d10 m 80 m
• - < <t25 ns 25 nsres
• y- < <1 0.1

For simplification65, all PMT-hits on the same DOM are merged and the times of the
individual hits are not taken into account, so that the event is quantified by Nhits

DOM for each
DOM. For the fit all DOMs with < <d10 m 80 m are taken into account, that includes also
the DOMs without any selected hit.

4.4.2.5. Likelihood. Ignoring shower-to-shower fluctuations, the probability P Nhits
DOM( ) to

detect Nhits
DOM on a given DOM depends on: E, y, the distance d between the vertex and the

DOM, the angle θ between shower direction eŝ and the vector

d from the vertex to the DOM,

and the DOM orientation. The DOM orientation can be described by a single angle β between
d and the DOM direction, because the angular acceptance of the entire DOM (sum of all PMT
angular acceptances) shows in first order a rotational symmetry due to the multi-PMT
structure, see section 2. All of these quantities are illustrated in figure 75.

The likelihood is computed as follows:

 q b a=


To define the probability P Nhits
DOM( ) two auxiliary quantities are introduced: the number of

expected photons gN⟨ ⟩ and the variance gNvar(⟨ ⟩) of the gN⟨ ⟩ distribution. To take fluctuations

Figure 75. Illustration of the quantities relevant for the probability P Nhits
DOM( ).

65
Besides reducing the computation time for the fit, this simplification is justified by the fact that each DOM in

principle measures the intensity of the shower event at a given position. As the PMTs on the same DOM are nearly at
the same position and direct light from a shower arrives at the DOM nearly at the same time, the information of the
individual PMTs—which PMT is hit at which time—is not needed. Of course, the multi-PMT structure is needed to
estimate the shower intensity from the number of hit PMTs Nhits

DOM.

89



in the hadronic shower into account, the variance of the expected number of photons has been
introduced.

The dependency on the DOM orientation and the distance are parameterised. For the
number of expected photons the dependency on the DOM orientation is assumed to follow
the angular acceptance of the entire DOM. For the final hit selection, the attenuation of gN⟨ ⟩
with distance is well described by l- -d d dexp att 2( ( )) · , where the first term describes the
effective attenuation due to absorption and scattering and the latter term describes the
geometrical reduction of solid angle coverage of the DOM on a sphere with radius d. The
effective attenuation length has been derived from a fit to the MC simulations and can be
parameterised as l = +d a b datt ( ) · with =a 32.2 m and b = 0.034.

Taking these parameterisations into account, gN⟨ ⟩ and gNvar(⟨ ⟩) depend on qE y d, , ,( ).
Although the d dependency is already taken into account via the parameterisation above, the
shape of the θ distribution changes with distance (see figure 72) so that a coarse binning in d
is needed.

The probability density function P Nhits
DOM( ) depends on gN N, , varhits

DOM( ⟨ ⟩ bgN ,(⟨ ⟩) ). The
quantities gN⟨ ⟩, gNvar(⟨ ⟩) and the probability P Nhits

DOM( ) are obtained from MC simulations of
events.

An example distribution of the expected number of photons gN⟨ ⟩ as a function of the
angle θ for different inelasticity y intervals is shown in figure 76. As the angle θ is defined
with respect to the electron direction, a clear Cherenkov peak of the electron at 42 is visible.
With higher inelasticity y this peak becomes fainter due to less energetic electrons, while the
number of expected photons in the ‘off-peak region’ ( q 60 ) increases due to the more
energetic hadronic showers. Therefore, these PDF tables gain sensitivity to the reaction
inelasticity y from the ratio of the peak to the off-peak region.

shower direction (which is the electron direction) and the vector from the vertex to the

4.4.2.6. Fitting procedure. For technical reasons, each event is fitted with nine different fixed
inelasticity y assumptions66 ( = - -y 0 0.1, 0.1 0.2 ,...,[ - -0.7 0.8, 0.8 1]). For each
fixed y the likelihood maximisation is performed for 5 different starting shower hypotheses.
The initial shower hypothesis is calculated from the selected hits. The direction is estimated
by the sum of all vectors from the vertex to the DOM weighted by Nhits

DOM and the energy is
estimated empirically by å -N 20 4hits

DOM( ) . The other four seeds are randomly chosen
perpendicular to the first starting shower hypotheses with the same energy.

Finally, the result with the best likelihood of all 45 fits is selected. Thus, the final result
has a discrete value for the reconstructed inelasticity y.

4.4.3. Event selection. The final event selection criteria are:

• >E 1 GeVreco ;
• result of both vertex fits is similar in space and time: distance <4 m and time
difference <20 ns;

The final hit selection (including also hits with <d 10 m) must again also fulfil the

shower trigger, see section 4.2.5. The coverage covx is defined as the fraction of directions on
a cone with the opening angle x around the reconstructed direction at the reconstructed vertex
position that satisfy the following containment condition: >L 20 minVol , where L inVol is the
path length inside the instrumented volume for distances away from the vertex between 10
and 70 m.

This coverage cut is introduced to ensure that a reasonable fraction of the expected hit
pattern from the reconstructed shower is contained in the instrumented volume. Therefore the
coverage cut is in principle a containment cut for the reconstructed vertex depending on the
reconstructed shower direction.

4.4.4. Reconstruction performance. The performance of the shower reconstruction is studied
on MC simulations described in section 4.2 and events are selected according to the criteria
described in section 4.4.3. The vertical spacing between the DOMs is 6 m if not stated
otherwise. For all following results the events are weighted to reproduce the conventional

Effective volume: the effective volume for up-going n CCe and n CCē events is shown in

figure 77 as a function of neutrino energy for different neutrino zenith angle ranges.
Depending on the zenith angle the plateau reaches 3.8 Mm3 (horizontal), 3.6 Mm3 (vertical
up-going) and around 3.7 Mm3 for all up-going ne and nē. The turn-on is slightly steeper for
vertical up-going than for horizontal events as more PMTs are oriented downward than

upward in a DOM. 90% of the plateau is reached around =nE 8 GeV 7 GeV( ) for ne (nē). The
turn-on is slightly steeper for nē than for ne due to the lower average inelasticity.

Vertex resolution: the distance between the neutrino interaction position and the
reconstructed vertex position is shown figure 78 (left) for all selected events in the energy
range of = -nE 2 30 GeV.

The distance is split in a longitudinal and a perpendicular component with respect to the
neutrino direction. An offset in neutrino direction is clearly visible and expected, since the
brightest point of the shower is reconstructed and not the interaction vertex position. As
discussed in section 4.4.1, the brightest point of the shower is offset by -0.5 m 2 m in the
relevant energy range (see figure 70). The longitudinal and perpendicular distances are fitted

distributions and the Gaussian fits are shown for < <nE6 GeV 7 GeV and < <y0.2 0.4 in

The mean of the Gaussian fit to the distribution of the longitudinal distances corresponds
to the shift between the brightest point and the neutrino interaction. The vertex resolution

and is dominated by the longitudinal vertex resolution. This precise vertex reconstruction
justifies the factorisation of the shower reconstruction into a vertex reconstruction and a
shower energy, direction and inelasticity reconstruction.

The fitted mean longitudinal vertex shift (in meter) is shown in figure 79 as a function of
Eν and Bjorken y. The increasing distance of the reconstructed shower bright point from the
interaction vertex with increasing neutrino energy is clearly visible.

Direction resolution: the median neutrino direction resolution (the angle between
reconstructed direction and neutrino direction) as a function of neutrino energy is shown in
figure 80 for different neutrino zenith angle ranges and for ne and nē separately. For events
weighted with the Bartol flux model the median directional resolution is better than 10 for
energies above 8.5 GeV for n CCe and above 5.5 GeV for n CCē events. The resolution is
slightly better for vertical up-going than for horizontal neutrinos as more PMTs are oriented
downward than upward in a DOM.

As the reconstruction is designed to find the electron direction, the resolution is better for
nē than for ne due to the smaller average inelasticity for nē leading on average to a smaller
intrinsic scattering angle between the neutrino and the electron. The median intrinsic
scattering angle, the median resolution with respect to the electron direction and the neutrino
direction as a function of neutrino energy are shown in figure 81. For the relevant energy
range the median electron direction resolution is smaller than the intrinsic scattering angle and
the median neutrino direction resolution, verifying that the reconstruction actually has the
ability to find the electron in events.

Figure 82 shows the median electron direction resolution as a function of electron energy
for different true inelasticity y ranges. The reconstruction of the electron direction is only
slightly affected by the additional light from the hadronic shower up to »y 0.5. For y 0.6
the reconstruction can additionally be confused by high energetic particles in the hadronic
shower producing a brighter Cherenkov ring than that from the electron. Due to momentum
conservation the most energetic particles produced in neutrino interactions tend to have
smaller scattering angles with respect to the neutrino direction. Therefore, by sometimes
reconstructing the dominant particle from the hadronic shower the median neutrino direction
for n CCe events is slightly better than the intrinsic scattering angle between neutrino and
electron for neutrino energies above ~5 GeV, as can be seen from figure 81.

Inelasticity resolution: the resolution on the inelasticity y for a low, medium and high y
range is shown in figure 83 (left) for < <nE6 GeV 12 GeV. The distributions of the

reconstructed inelasticity yreco and true inelasticity ytrue for n CCe and n CCē events are shown
in figure 83 (right) for < <nE6 GeV 12 GeV.

The absence of >y 0.8reco can be explained by dominant particles in the hadronic shower
mimicking a lower inelasticity as discussed in section 4.4.1. The accumulation of events at
low yreco is larger than expected from the MC inelasticity distribution and visible for n CCe and
n CCē events. This is a feature of the reconstruction algorithm.

Due to the sensitivity to y the yreco distribution is different for ne and n CCē events leading
to a separation power between both channels. This sensitivity to y can also be used to separate

events from events.
Energy resolution: in figure 84 (left) the reconstructed energy is shown as a function of

the neutrino energy for events weighted according to the Bartol flux model. The
reconstructed energy is systematically higher than the neutrino energy. Therefore, an energy
correction depending on the reconstructed zenith angle qreco, inelasticity yreco and
reconstructed energy Ereco is applied. The corrected reconstructed energy Ereco

MC such that the median reconstructed energy is equal to the neutrino energy assuming a
Bartol flux model. The corrected reconstructed energy as a function of the neutrino energy is
shown in figure 84 (right).

The difference between reconstructed and neutrino energy in different neutrino energy
bins is shown in figure 85 for n CCe and n CCē events separately. These distributions are very
well described by Gaussians.

The median fractional energy resolution—given as - n nE E Ereco∣ ∣ —is better than 18%
for neutrino energies above 5 GeV for up-going n CCe and n CCē events and is shown as a
function of neutrino energy in figure 86. The relative energy resolution—given as the RMS of

- nE Ereco( ) distributions (see figure 85) over neutrino energy—is better than 26% (24%) for
neutrino energies above 7 GeV for up-going ne (nē) CC events and is shown as a function of
visible energy Evis in figure 87 (left) together with the resolution for the other shower-like
neutrino interaction channels. For events the visible energy is equal to the neutrino
energy. The resolution is better for n CCē events than for n CCe events due to the lower average
contribution from the hadronic shower which shows larger fluctuations than electromagnetic
showers [160]. Figure 87 (right) shows the mean relative offset between the mean
reconstructed energy and the visible energy. At energies corresponding to the effective
volume turn-on region the reconstructed energy is overestimated for n CCē and n CCe events as
only events pass the event selection criteria that appear more energetic than they actually are.
Above ~9 GeV the reconstructed energies are slightly overestimated (underestimated) for nē
(ne) CC due to the smaller light yield of hadronic showers compared to electromagnetic
showers.

4.4.4.2. Performance for shower-like neutrino events. The performance of the shower
reconstruction is evaluated separately on different shower-like neutrino interaction event
samples: ne and nē CC events, n me and n mē NC events, nt and nt¯ CC events where the τ lepton
decays in an electron or hadrons.

The effective volume for up-going shower-like neutrino events is shown in figure 88
(left) as a function of neutrino energy. The turn-on is much less steep for and
events than for events, as the outgoing neutrinos are invisible to the detector. For
events the turn-on is steeper than for events as on average the visible energy in
events is larger than in events. In nNC events the average inelasticity is higher than in
nNC¯ events leading to more energetic hadronic showers and a steeper turn-on.

The median directional resolution is shown in figure 88 (right) as a function of neutrino
energy. The directional resolution for and events is clearly worse than for
events as the information of the outgoing neutrinos is unavailable. As the angle between the
hadronic shower and the neutrino is smaller for nNC than for nNC¯ events due to a higher
average inelasticity, the directional resolution is better.

The relative energy resolution—given as RMS over visible energy Evis—for up-going
shower-like neutrino events is shown as a function of Evis in figure 87 (left). Evis is defined as
the difference between the energy of the incoming neutrino and the outgoing neutrino(s) from
the primary neutrino interaction (NC events) or τ-decay ( events). The resolution is
worse for events with higher average contribution from hadronic showers which show larger
fluctuations [160].

Due to the smaller light yield of hadronic showers compared to electromagnetic showers,
the ration E Ereco vis⟨ ⟩ is different for each neutrino interaction channel and energy dependent.
This can be seen in figure 87 (right). The higher the fraction of electromagnetic shower

component in the event the higher is the mean reconstructed energy. This leads also to
different turn-on behaviours in the effective volume for both shower types, and consequently
to different compositions (in terms of electromagnetic and hadronic shower components) of
well reconstructed neutrino events. The latter explains the behaviour below E 10 GeVvis .

The distribution of the reconstructed inelasticity yreco for events with hadronic
shower energies of < <E6 GeV 12 GeVhad is shown in figure 89. As expected, the yreco
distribution for NC events looks similar to the distribution for events with < <y0.8 1
(see figure 83), but different to the other y ranges, leading to a separation power between
shower-like events from and events.

4.4.5. Performance for different vertical spacings. The different detector configurations
studied in this section are described in section 4.2.4. The performance for different vertical
spacings is studied on up-going events weighted according to the Bartol atmospheric
neutrino flux model. Events are selected according to the same criteria as described in
section 4.4.4. For each detector configuration the respective energy correction is applied (see
section 4.4.4).

The effective volumes for the masked detectors with different vertical spacings are
shown in figure 90 (top left). For all detector configurations a similar plateau value is reached,
but the turn-on is less steep for smaller DOM density (larger vertical spacing). Assuming the

same number of DOMs for each vertical spacing, these effective volumes can be scaled
accordingly as shown in figure 90 (top right). The ratio of effective volumes for n CCe and
n CCē is shown in figure 90 (bottom).

In figure 91 the resolutions for the different vertical spacings are summarised. The
resolution on both the neutrino direction and energy deteriorates slightly. The performance for
other shower-like neutrino events for different vertical spacings is similar as described
previously.

4.4.6. Effect of variation in water/PMT properties and noise level on reconstruction
performance. The reconstruction performances have been studied for a variation in water
properties, PMT QE and optical background noise. For this purpose, the absorption and
scattering lengths labs andlscat have been changed by ±10%, while the QE has been changed
by-10%—a fuller discussion of these parameters is given in section 3.4. To test the influence
of the optical background, the single noise rate is increased from an already conservative
10 kHz to 20 kHz in the whole detector. Bioluminescence does not produce correlated noise
apart from random coincidences and can be simulated by increasing single noise rates.

4.4.6.1. Effect of known parameter variations. It is assumed that the true water, PMT and
noise properties are known so that they can be accounted for in the reconstruction. The trigger
conditions are unchanged compared to the nominal values67 and events are selected according
to the same criteria as for the nominal values. This study has been performed for the detector
with 6 m vertical spacing—similar effects are expected for larger spacings.

The energy and direction resolution for a known variation in water, PMT and noise
properties is shown in figures 92 and 93 together with the performance for the nominal values.
For all studied variations the direction resolution is unaffected, as the direction resolution is

properties (labs and lscat) and quantum efficiencies (QE) for up-going n CCe and n CCe¯

For 20 kHz single noise rate the trigger rate from pure noise would be too high, so that the trigger conditions

would have been tightened. However, the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the robustness of the reconstruction
with respect to an increased noise rate.

dominated by the intrinsic scattering angle and not by detector effects. The energy resolution
deteriorates slightly for a lower number of detected photons, i.e. reduced labs or QE.

For 20 kHz single noise rates the resolutions are as good as for 10 kHz, confirming the
good S/N ratio due to small time windows in the hit selections (see section 4.4.2) allowed by
the large scattering length in water.

The effective volumes are shown in figure 94. For all studied variations in water, PMT
and noise properties a similar plateau value is reached, but the turn-on is less steep for less
detected photons, i.e. reduced labs or QE. For 20 kHz single noise rates the effective volume
is only slightly lower compared to a 10 kHz noise rate.

The negligible deterioration in direction and energy resolution in conjunction with the
relatively modest loss in effective volume for an increase in single noise rates by a factor of
two68 compared to the nominal assumed rate of 10 kHz demonstrates the robustness of the
reconstruction against higher noise rates. Consequently, it is expected that the assumed
performance can be achieved for most of the data taking time.

4.4.6.2. Effect of undetected parameter variations. While the direction and energy
resolutions are unaffected, figure 95 depicts the ratio of the mean reconstructed energy for
nominal and varied water and PMT properties. Variations of the same properties and
magnitude as above have been used for this study, but the underlying assumption is now that
the variation relative to the nominal values is not known and not accounted for in the
reconstruction. An exemplary±10% variation in scattering length has a negligible effect on
the mean reconstructed energy, while the same variation in the absorption length induces a
corresponding shift in reconstructed energy of±8%. A decrease in QE of 10% results in a
corresponding downward shift in energy of 10%.

4.5. Flavour identification and muon rejection

The determination of the NMH requires a precise estimate of the neutrino energy and zenith
angle and a high-purity event sample. In addition, since neutrino events of all flavours are
reconstructed, the discrimination between neutrino flavours is necessary. In this section an
event type discrimination algorithm is developed and its performance is outlined. The
algorithm is conceived with the distinction between three classes of events in mind. These
classes are ‘atmospheric muons’, ‘shower-like’ and ‘track-like’ neutrino events. In particular
the atmospheric muon event class is induced by the passage of downward-going muon
bundles coming from a cosmic-ray air shower which is misreconstructed as upward-going, i.e.
neutrino induced, event. Track-like events are those that are induced by charged current muon
neutrino interactions, having the signature of a straight track passing through or nearby the
instrumented volume. Finally, shower-like events are those coming from all other neutrino
interaction channels and flavours: all NC interactions and the CC interactions of electron and
tau neutrinos69.

4.5.1. Methodology. In order to optimally exploit the information imprinted in the light
emission of the events, several machine learning algorithms, so called classifiers, have been
evaluated. Finally, a classification algorithm known as random decision forest (RDF) [175]
has been used in this study.

This is even a factor of 2.5 compared to the measured 8 kHz, see section 4.2.

A RDF consists of many decision trees that individually categorise an event into different
classes. Each decision tree consists of several nodes. During classification a number of
features, i.e. observables contributing discrimination power, are calculated for an event. At
each node a decision in favour of a class is taken and the event is pushed to a child node
according to the result of the decision. The individual node decisions in a tree are found by a
cut on one of the calculated features. The cuts are chosen so that they maximise performance
key figures such as the signal class purity. In this way the event is classified as more likely to
be a track, a shower or an atmospheric muon. The decision process is repeated until the event
reaches a leaf, a node without children, and the classification into one of the classes is
finished.

A decision tree is trained on MC event data. A major disadvantage of single trees,
however, is the low ability to generalise the trained tree, i.e. the ability to not only reproduce
the features in the training sample. Several methods are proposed in the literature to improve
the performance of single decision tree methods and we use the RDF approach. For an RDF
many of the above described decision trees are trained simultaneously, a total of 101 in our
study. Instead of using all features at once, for each tree a predefined fraction of features and
events is selected. Finally, the classification is done by a majority decision of the trees as
described above. The purity and efficiency of the classification can be set by defining cuts
different from a simple 50% majority decision.

4.5.2. Event preselection. Even if the detector will be located under more than 2000m of sea
water, the number of atmospheric muons arriving at the detector and being triggered (see
section 4.2.5) is larger than that of atmospheric neutrinos by several orders of magnitude.
However, since the atmospheric muon flux is fully shielded by the Earth, looking at upward
going events will allow to search for neutrinos. Nonetheless, Cherenkov photons from
atmospheric muons can produce a hit pattern in the detector such that reconstruction
algorithms still reconstruct the event as upward-going. A pre-selection of events is necessary
before training the RDF, since in any case it would not be able to handle such a large

contamination of atmospheric muons. Both the reconstruction strategies described in the
previous section can produce a proper rejection of the atmospheric background without
significantly reducing the amount of good neutrino events.

At first each event is requested to be reconstructed as upward going. This holds both for
the track and the shower reconstruction algorithm. Then two different sets of quality criteria
are applied, one for the muon and one for the shower reconstruction method. The logical ‘OR’
of the two chosen criteria is used to define the input sample for the RDF.

Concerning the shower reconstruction algorithm, a preliminary event selection is
implicitly done in the reconstruction itself, see section 4.4.3. Through-going atmospheric
muons release a large amount of light in the detector and can easily be separated from low

energy neutrino showers. This is done by requiring a proper hit selection in the shower
reconstruction itself. This is not the case for the muon track reconstruction algorithm, for
which both the signal and the background events show the same hit topology. For bright
reconstructed shower events it is required that the hit pattern is compatible with a point-like
emission. Here, bright events are defined as events with more than 15 causally connected L2
hits (defined as in section 4.4.2) and the compatibility with a point-like emission is evaluated
based on the time residuals of these L2 hits with respect to the reconstructed vertex. If the
difference between the 80% and 20% quantiles of the time residuals is smaller than 15 ns, the
event is considered as a shower event candidate. This requirement results in a preselection of
shower event candidates and efficiently focuses the time-consuming part of the shower
reconstruction to neutrino-like events. Additionally, the shower reconstruction algorithm
provides many different event-by-event quality parameters, which provide further rejection
power for atmospheric muons and are used as features in the RDF.

As far as the track reconstruction is concerned, the Λ parameter described previously can
provide a first rejection of atmospheric muons; however, acting on this parameter alone would
also suppress a large part of the neutrino sample at lower energy if high purity is requested.
Adding also the reconstructed track starting point information allows an improved rejection of
wrongly reconstructed atmospheric muon tracks. Figures 96 and 97 show the distribution of
the reconstructed track starting point for atmospheric muons and low energy ( nE < 20 GeV)
atmospheric muon neutrinos. A variable nR , the radius of a ‘fiducial cylinder’, has been
defined and, in combination with the Λ quantities, has been tested in order to achieve a
preliminary selection cut. The chosen value for nR is equal to the radius of the instrumented
volume, i.e. 106 m. The number of wrongly reconstructed atmospheric muons can be reduced
by more than three orders of magnitude when applying a preliminary selection cut on nR and
the track quality parameter Λ.

4.5.3. Classification input. As described above, a decision tree relies on cuts on observables,
so called features, that are chosen to discriminate well between the different classes and that
are calculated for each event. In the following, the best performing features are ranked
according to their discrimination power and very briefly explained.

The ranking is done using the overall classification rate under a majority decision of
50%. For the ranking, the trees of the RDF are trained with each individual feature and the
overall RDF performance is evaluated. In the next step the algorithm adds one more feature to

the best one and does the training once more. This is done for every possible configuration.
The best configurations are chosen to do more iterations in the same way and this process
iterates as long as the performance increases. In table 13 the ranking of the best features used
in the classification is listed.

4.5.4. Classification performance and results. In the following the performance of the
classification algorithm is evaluated using all events passing the selection criteria shown
above.

Definitions. It is desirable to maximise the number of correctly classified events for all
channels. The following definition is used to evaluate the performance of the classification
algorithm. The fraction of correctly classified events RAcorr of class A is defined as the ratio of
correctly classified events with succeeded reconstruction NAcorr,rec with respect to the total
number of events in this class NAall:

Classification results. Figure 98 shows the result of the RDF classification. The fraction of
correctly classified events per interaction channel is plotted versus the MC neutrino energy.
Here the majority vote of the RDF was set to 50% as this was the best compromise between
all classes. Each colour depicts the result for neutrinos and antineutrinos of one flavour in one
interaction channel.

The left plot in figure 98 shows the fraction of events classified as track-like for the
different flavours and interaction channels versus the MC neutrino energy. The shown results
are obtained for all events used in the last classification step. Classification results for CC tau
neutrino interactions are shown without distinction between track-like and shower-like decay
topologies of the resulting tau lepton70. The high energy range shows an expected increase in
identification power for long-track muons from muon neutrinos undergoing a CC interaction.
As can be seen, antineutrinos can be identified more easily than neutrinos. This is expected
due to the different reaction inelasticities for neutrinos and antineutrinos. The fraction of
interactions with a resulting shower signature wrongly identified as track-like falls below 20%
above 10 GeV. Electron neutrinos undergoing a CC interaction are identified more easily as
shower-like than NC reactions as they yield more light.

In the right plot the fraction of events recognised as showers is depicted. Most efficiently
recognised are electron neutrino CC interactions. Above a neutrino energy of 15 GeV the
fraction of correctly classified events reaches more than 90%. At 6 GeV the fraction reaches

85%. Charged current muon (anti-)neutrino events are falsely classified at a rate of 35%
(15%) at 10 GeV.

The results for the configuration with a spacing of 9 m (figure 99) show a drop of around
5% in the identification power for track-like events. The general shape of the distribution
remains. The fraction of misclassified shower events stays nearly the same. However, shower
events need more energy now to result in a clear signature and successful classification as
shower-like events. Therefore, the response curve is shifted by 5 GeV to higher energies.

Figure 100 shows the particle identification performance for a detector configuration with
12 m vertical spacing. The identification power for the charged current muon neutrinos drops
significantly. The fraction of misclassified shower events stays below 20%. Again a shift to
higher energies of the response curve for shower-like events is observed.

The contamination of atmospheric muons in the neutrino sample, i.e. downward-going
atmospheric muons which are reconstructed as up-going and classified either as neutrino
induced tracks or as showers is of the order of a few percent. These wrongly identified muons
have equal probability of ending up either in the ‘showers’ or ‘tracks’ sample. This surviving
background is taken into account in the subsequent calculation of the ORCA sensitivity.

4.6. Sensitivity studies for the NMH

4.6.1. Global fit. This section describes the main mass hierarchy sensitivity calculation based
on PEs and log likelihood ratios. It is divided into three parts. First, the modelling of the
physics and detector is detailed. This model is used to calculate the expected event rates for
given values of the oscillation parameters and systematics. Then, the statistical method for the
mass hierarchy sensitivity calculation is described. Finally, an overview is given of the current
results using this method. An independent study based on Asimov-sets is described at the end
of this section.

4.6.2. Rate calculation. KM3NeT/ORCA’s data will consist of observed event rates as a
function of the reconstructed neutrino energy and zenith angle. By comparing these to the
expected rates it will be possible to distinguish between the two mass hierarchy cases. The
rate computation is separated into two parts. First the expected neutrino interaction rate at the
detector site is calculated as a function of the true neutrino energy and zenith angle. Secondly,
the response of the detector itself is modelled, leading to the rates of reconstructed events as a
function of the reconstructed energy and zenith angle.

As shown in sections 4.3 and 4.4, KM3NeT/ORCA is sensitive to the inelasticity
(Bjorken y), potentially adding a third dimension to the rate histograms. At the moment, the
inelasticity is not yet included in the sensitivity study. Doing so will likely improve the mass
hierarchy significance, due to its power to discriminate neutrinos and antineutrinos on a
statistical basis.

The whole computation chain is summarised in figure 101. Each step is described in
detail in the following paragraphs.

4.6.2.1. Detector-independent part. The first half of the simulation chain (leading to
intermediate result (c) in figure 101) can be summarised as:

• Ra is the interaction rate per unit volume at the detector site of (anti)neutrinos of flavour a
as a function of the neutrino energy and direction.

• The initial flavour b is summed over ne, nm, nē and nm¯ .
• Fb

atm is the atmospheric neutrino flux for neutrinos of flavour b.
• Pa b,

osc is the oscillation probability for a neutrino passing through Earth.
• sa is the CC neutrino-nucleon cross section for a neutrino of flavour a.

A consistent binning is used throughout the calculation. The energy axis is binned
linearly in Elog10( ) from 2 to 100 GeV in 40 bins. The zenith angle axis is binned linearly in

qcos( ) from −1 to 0 in 40 bins, where we use the convention that q = -cos 1( ) corresponds
to vertically up-going neutrinos.

The atmospheric neutrino fluxes are modelled by the HKKM2014 simulations [176]. The
given flux values are tabulated as a function of energy and zenith angle, averaged over the
azimuth angle. In order to deal with the rather coarse binning the values are interpolated. To
be more precise, a two-dimensional spline interpolation is made of the cumulative tables. The
spline’s derivatives then yield a bin-integral conserving interpolation of the flux tables. The
chosen tables are for the Fréjus site (without mountain) at solar minimum, since the Fréjus site
is expected to be most similar to the KM3NeT/ORCA detector site.

The oscillation probabilities depend on the mixing parameters (including the hierarchy)
and the Earth density profile. They are calculated by evaluating the neutrino propagation time
evolution operator in a constant density medium (see [177]) at small steps along the
trajectory. The Earth’s density profile is given by the preliminary reference Earth model
(PREM) [147]. To speed up calculations the model is approximated by 42 constant-density
shells. The electron density (an ingredient for the oscillation probability calculation) is
approximated to be half of the nucleon density.

We use the CC and NC neutrino-nucleon cross sections from the GENIE MC generator
[166, 167] for an oxygen nucleus and two protons.

The results of the first half of the simulation chain (i.e. at intermediate result (c)) are eight
histograms of neutrino interaction rates per unit volume at the detector as a function of the
true energy and zenith angle: six for the CC interactions (three flavours, neutrinos and
antineutrinos) and two for NC interactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Throughout the
simulation, NC events are approximated as equal for all three flavours.

4.6.2.2. Detector-dependent part. The second part of the simulation chain models the
detector response to neutrino interactions. Each step is based on the results presented in the
previous sections of this document.

The energy- and zenith angle-dependent effective mass determines how many of the
interacting events can be reconstructed. This is step (3) in the flowchart. It is derived from MC
simulations as

r´ ´M V N N , 37eff gen. water sel. gen.≔ ( )

where Ngen. is the total number of generated events in a large generation volume Vgen.. Events
that are successfully reconstructed by either one of the two reconstruction algorithms are
counted in Nsel.. The density of sea water rwater is assumed to be 1025 kg m

−3. The effective
mass is binned as a function of the true neutrino energy and zenith angle, and is evaluated for
each of the eight event classes separately.

At this step an additional histogram is created, representing the expected background
from misreconstructed atmospheric muons. As shown in section 4.5, the contamination of
such events can be effectively reduced to a few percent by applying cuts. Due to the high

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

110



suppression efficiency it is increasingly difficult to generate high statistics samples for this
type of background. Therefore, the distribution from a looser cut is used and rescaled to the
total number of events found for a stricter cut. This is a conservative estimate as for looser
cuts the event distribution turns out to be mostly centred around our signal area (up-going,
around 10 GeV) while the distribution becomes more uniform as we apply stricter cuts.

At the end of this step there are a total of nine histograms.
The next step ((4) in figure 101) is particle identification. Each input histogram is the

basis for two new ones, representing events identified as ‘tracks’ and ‘showers’, respectively.
The identification probabilities are based on the RDF study described in section 4.5, and
depend on the true neutrino energy only. Neutrino events identified as atmospheric muons are
discarded. The probability for atmospheric muon background events to be identified as a
track/shower has not been determined due to lack of statistics; a simple 50/50 separation is
applied. After this step we have eighteen histograms.

In the final step ((5) in figure 101) the energy resolutions and angle resolutions are
applied. They are implemented as response matrices filled from simulated data. First the
zenith angle is ‘smeared out’ using a three-dimensional response matrix that provides binned

qcos reco( )-distributions as a function of qcos true( ) and Etrue. Then a two-dimensional energy
response matrix providing Ereco-distributions as a function of Etrue is used to smear the
energy.

The resolutions are evaluated separately for each of the sixteen neutrino event classes.
We have, for example:

• nm CC interactions identified as tracks;
• nē CC events identified as showers;
• NC ν events identified as showers;
• ne CC events misidentified as tracks;
• K

Each is smeared using dedicated response matrices. In particular, neutrinos and
antineutrinos are smeared differently. So are correctly and wrongly identified events.

The response matrices use a coarser binning than the rate histograms. Depending on the
available MC statistics, the number of bins is reduced from 40 to 20 or 10 to avoid artefacts.

After reconstruction all histograms are combined in two final event histograms
representing the track channel and the shower channel, respectively.

4.6.3. Sensitivity calculation. The sensitivity to the mass hierarchy is calculated using
likelihood ratio distributions from PEs. The procedure works as follows:

(1) Pick a set of true values for the oscillation parameters and other systematics.
(2) Calculate the expected number of events for a given period of data taking, using the

simulation chain described above.
(3) Generate pseudo-data by randomly drawing a detected number of events for each bin

based on Poisson statistics. The two histograms thus attained constitute the PE.
(4) Find the best-fit likelihoods NH and IH for the NH and IH assumption, by maximising

the likelihood with respect to the other free parameters in both cases.
(5) Calculate the log likelihood ratio  LLR log NH IH≔ ( ). This discriminating variable

indicates which hierarchy is favoured by the PE.

The likelihood  of the PE given the model is defined as

is the Poisson probability to observe n events when the expectation value is λ. The expected
event numbers mi depend on the parameter values (oscillation parameters and systematics) so
that maximising the likelihood corresponds to finding the parameter values that best fit
the PE.

The default parameter settings are summarised in table 14. It shows the true parameter
values used to generate PEs. Most of these are fixed at some nominal value. The initial values
are those used as starting values by the minimiser in the fitting procedure that finds the
likelihood maximum. These values are chosen randomly for each PE to avoid systematic
biases. Most parameters are fitted, meaning they are left free in the minimiser. The likelihood
is multiplied by Gaussian priors for some parameters (see table 14). The mean and width of
the Gaussian priors correspond to those of the matching initial value distributions. Two
parameters (q12 and dm2) are treated as nuisance parameters. This means that, rather than
leaving them free in the fit, a random ‘best fit’ value from the initial value distribution is
assigned to each PE. It emulates the fact that these parameters will be constrained almost
exclusively by external measurements.

The first six parameters listed in table 14 are the oscillation parameters, where the large
mass-squared difference DM2 is defined as

The last five entries in the table are systematics. The overall flux factor and NC scaling simply
scale the total number of (NC) events by an energy- and zenith-independent factor. The skew
parameters introduce an additional asymmetry in the ratio of one event type to the other,
while conserving the total number of events. They relate to the ratio of neutrinos to
antineutrinos and the ratio of μ-flavour events to e-flavour events. Finally, the energy slope α
introduces an energy-dependent scaling of the number of events of the form aE .

Because q23 generally has two likelihood maxima, special steps are taken to avoid ending
up in the wrong one. The likelihood maximisation is repeated several times, starting from a
different q23 value each time. Only the best-fit result is considered for either hierarchy.

The distributions for each parameter are uncorrelated and based on the current world
uncertainties [93, 95, 178].

fit of the distributions.

The final figure of merit is the median significance, computed by comparing LLR
distributions for true NH and true IH PEs. An example is shown in figure 102. The further
these two distributions are apart, the higher the significance. We quote the significance with

Figure 104. The mass hierarchy sensitivity for the true normal (left) and inverted (right)
hierarchy. The horizontal axis indicates the true value of q23. The vertical axis indicates
the ‘alternative’ value of q23: the value belonging to the hypothesis that is being
rejected. The diagonal dashed lines indicate the position where the alternative q23 is the
same as the true one. Along these lines the mass hierarchy sensitivity according to the
original method can be read off. The solid red and blue lines show the most likely
alternative value for each true q23. They are the most likely value when fitting q23 under
the wrong hierarchy assumption. Along these lines the mass hierarchy sensitivity
according to the new method can be read off.

Figure 105. Comparison of the mass hierarchy sensitivity calculated using the old
method (dashed lines) and the new method (solid lines). In the former, the significance
is calculated to reject the other hierarchy at the same q23, whereas in the latter the
alternative hypothesis has a different q23. The differences are rather small, but there is a
noticeable decrease in the second octant IH mass hierarchy sensitivity. This is for the
9 m spacing and three years of operation time, using the default settings
(particularly, d = 0CP,true ).

which the ‘wrong hierarchy (WH)’ can be excluded at the median of the ‘true hierarchy (TH)’
LLR. In all our simulations the LLR distributions can be excellently approximated by
Gaussians. This allows the median significance to be expressed in the following simple form:

S . 41NH

IH
≔ ( )

This gives the median significance in σʼs to exclude the IH, given true NH, where the μʼs and
σʼs here refer to the means and widths of the LLR distributions. This number can be
interpreted as the minimum significance in σʼs with which the WH can be excluded in at least
half of the PEs.

4.6.4. Alternative hypothesis. Initially, the mass hierarchy sensitivity was calculated by
comparing LLR distributions generated with identical true oscillation parameter values (other
than the hierarchy). However, this approach does not take into account the strong correlation
between the measurement of q23 and the hierarchy. From simulations it follows that the best-
fit value of q23 depends strongly on the assumed hierarchy. In many cases, the best-fit values
for the two hierarchy assumptions are not in the same octant. In the actual measurement we
therefore have to distinguish between two cases: NH with some best-fit value q23

NH and IH with
a different best-fit value q23

IH. Since the two values can be very far apart, the mean and width of
the corresponding LLR distributions can be noticeably different, leading to a different mass
hierarchy sensitivity. Note that this effect does not occur for the other parameters, which
typically have very similar best-fit values for the two hierarchy assumptions.

To take this effect into account the following procedure was adopted. For each true
hypothesis (true hierarchy TH with q23,true) the most likely alternative hypothesis (other
hierarchy OH with q23,alt) is determined from the q23 best-fit distribution of PEs generated
with the true hypothesis and fitted assuming the OH. The median significance to reject the
alternative hypothesis is then calculated:

This includes a fit of q23, DM 2, dCP and the five systematics. The left plot shows its
dependency on q23 for two values dCP for three years of operation time whereas the
right plot illustrates its improvement over time for two selected values of q23
and d = 0CP .

A technical issue arises because the LLR distributions were only simulated for certain given
values of q23, while the alternative hypothesis q23ʼs can take any value. To overcome this we
notice that the LLR distributions’ fitted widths and means as a function of q23 look rather
smooth, so that they can be reasonably approximated by interpolating between the already
calculated values. This is shown in figure 103. This method enables us to calculate the mass
hierarchy sensitivity for any value of the true and alternative q23. Figure 104 illustrates the
values of the alternative q23 and the effect on the mass hierarchy sensitivity. All the LLR-
method mass hierarchy sensitivity results in this document are produced using this method,
unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Figure 105 shows the effect of the new method on the mass hierarchy sensitivity.

4.6.5. Results. Figure 106 shows the latest mass hierarchy significance plot. The expected
significance depends strongly on the true value of q23 and dCP. Without CP-violation, the
NMH can be measured with more than 3σ in three years at the current world best fit values
of q23

4.6.6. Spacing studies. Whereas the LLR method (described above) provides the most
accurate description of the planned experiment, its application to certain problems might
sometimes be prohibitive due to the large number of PEs to be generated. Therefore a
simplified approach is used to answer dedicated questions.

The starting point is again the set of two histograms (for tracks and showers) in the
reconstructed quantities qE ,reco reco. In each bin i, the expected number of events mi

TH( ) for a
given TH hypothesis is calculated. A c2 minimisation is performed assuming the WH
marginalising over the parameters given in table 14. Contrary to the description in table 14,

q q,12 13 and Dm2 are fixed to their true values, whereas all other eight parameters are fitted
unconstrained, i.e. without adding any priors. The true value of the CP-phase is fixed to 0. As

which determines the probability to refute the WH hypothesis. It can be simply expressed as

It has been verified, that the results obtained with this method are generally rather close to
those from the full LLR treatment. The simplified method is used to optimise the vertical
distance of the DOMs on the DUs. Whereas the horizontal spacing between DUs is
determined by deployment constraints (20 m distance between DUs is considered a
minimum), the vertical distance is a free parameter with little constraints from a technical
point of view. Simulations have been performed with DOM distances of 6, 9 and 12 m. The
detector performance for these different setups have been shown before. Figure 107 shows the
expected NMH sensitivity after three years of data taking for both hierarchy hypotheses as
function of the true mixing angle q23. An optimal distance is found close to 9 m, as both for 6
and 12 m the NMH sensitivity degrades, at least in some regions of the parameter space.

4.6.7. Measurement of ΔM2 and θ23. The derivation of measurement contours for the
oscillation parameters is done as well with the simplified procedure, which had been used
already for the spacing study. The same set of nuisance parameters is applied. Optionally an
energy scale shift is added as additional systematic uncertainty. It is implemented as a free
scaling of the neutrino energy in all detector related distributions such as effective mass,
particle identification, angular and energy resolution. All nuisance parameters are fitted
unconstrained, i.e. without priors. Both DM2 and q23 are determined under the assumption
that the correct NMH has been already identified. The s1 measurement contours obtained
after three years of data taking for three test points (D = -M 2.45 10 eV ,2 3 2

q =sin 0.42, 0.50, 0.582 23 ) are shown on figure 108. They are compared to current world

best measurements [104, 179] as well as to extrapolations of final results from NOvA and
T2K [104, 180], to be expected around 2020. For T2K, the extrapolation is performed by
exploiting the published likelihood shape of the present measurement [104] assuming the
planned complete beam exposure of 7.8 1021 protons on target. A precision of 3% inDM2 is
reached after three years which can be reduced to 2% when suppressing the energy scale
uncertainty. The precision in q23 varies between 4% and 10%, depending on its true value and
the NMH.

4.6.8. Systematic uncertainties. A substantial list of possible uncertainties is already taken
into account while fitting the NMH by marginalising over the related nuisance parameters, as
indicated in table 14. Some of these parameters—such as q23 and DM2—can be determined
together with the NMH with high accuracy, as shown above.

It is crucial to determine reliable priors for the chosen nuisance parameters. The currently
used priors are listed as well in table 14. However, it has been verified that loosening the prior
conditions or even totally suppressing them has only a small impact on the final NMH
sensitivity. Therefore, in future studies some of them might by treated as unconstrained fit
parameters, i.e. without priors.

Contributions to the uncertainties come from the neutrino flux [176], cross section [159]
and from the detector performance. For the latter, a main contribution is expected from the
uncertainty in the photon detection efficiency by the PMTs and the related readout electronics.
However, as demonstrated in ANTARES and also with the KM3NeT prototype module [5],
the measurement of 40K coincidences between adjacent PMTs of the same DOM allows the
photon detection efficiency to be monitored in real time with high precision. The variable
nature of optical noise due to bioluminescence is controlled by sampling it for each individual
PMT with a frequency of 10Hz. The results of these measurements are directly injected into
the simulation, as is done in ANTARES. This excludes bioluminescence as a source of
systematic uncertainty of any measurement. Apart from the optical noise due to
bioluminescence, sea water is a very stable and homogeneous medium, as monitored over
many years by ANTARES. Current knowledge of its light propagation properties are
discussed in section 3.4. The residual uncertainties of quantities such as absorption and
scattering length have less effect (due to the closer spacing) for ORCA than for ARCA, and
are well-covered by the nuisance parameters discussed above, so no separate investigation has
been performed.

Additional systematic uncertainties, not yet included in the present study, comprise
systematic shifts in the reconstructed energy and zenith angle. These will be considered in the
near future. However, it is believed that the energy scale is well-constrained through the
knowledge of the absolute PMT efficiency and the water parameters. The angular resolution
of neutrino telescopes in sea water is excellent, and it remains better than 10° down to the
energies relevant for the NMH determination. Systematic angular offsets are at most in the
sub-degree region, as shown by the study of the moon shadow in the CR signal in
ANTARES. A deterioration of the angular resolution due to the movement of the detector
elements in the sea current is excluded by permanently re-calibrating them via an acoustic
positioning system. Such a system provides a precision of better than about 10 cm for all
detector elements, which makes its influence on the angular resolution of reconstructed
neutrino events negligible.

The energy and angular resolutions are a crucial input to the sensitivity calculation. Both
are estimated from simulations which are subject to uncertainties on their own. These can be
parametrised by applying a scaling (i.e. broadening or narrowing) to these resolution
functions, as is planned for the near future.

Finally, an independent study has been performed to study the variations of the Earth
model [147] on the NMH sensitivity. Both the thickness and density of each individual layer
have been varied within the tolerance of the model, as well as the sharpness of the layer
boundaries. The impact of these variations is found to be negligible for the present study and
is therefore ignored as a relevant systematic effect.

4.7. Outlook

The previous sections provide details on the performances of the KM3NeT/ORCA detector
in establishing the neutrino mass ordering and improving the precision on the oscillation
parameters in the atmospheric sector. While the results obtained so far rely on full MC studies
and incorporate the leading systematic effects, possible refinements have already been
identified and will be scrutinised in the near future. This includes notably the usage of the
achieved sensitivity to the interaction inelasticity as a statistical tool to discriminate between
neutrino and antineutrinos and to further reject the background from NC interactions. As a
detailed and ongoing investigation shows, see [160] for first results, event-by-event fluc-
tuations intrinsic to the development of the hadronic system resulting from a neutrino
interaction on a nucleon or nucleus limit the achievable resolutions on direction, energy and
inelasticity for a given detector geometry. However, some improvements, in particular for the
reconstruction of the reaction inelasticity, can still be expected to arise from the development
of new reconstruction strategies. Envisaged lines of work comprise e.g. an attempt to identify
the leading particle in the hadronic system to constrain its overall momentum, a combined fit
of the hadronic shower and the charged lepton in CC interactions, improved energy esti-
mation techniques, etc.

In addition to the oscillation measurements discussed in the previous section, the size and
energy range covered by the KM3NeT/ORCA detector allow for the search of CC interac-
tions of tau neutrinos produced in the oscillation of atmospheric electron and muon neutrinos.
While these events can hardly be distinguished on an event-by-event basis, their presence
could be revealed by a statistical excess of cascade-like events over the baseline from
atmospheric NC interactions and electron neutrino CC interactions. This effect is expected to
be seen with high confidence level and statistical power within the first years of operation, but
a precise study remains to be carried out. The energy and flavour distributions of observed
events in the ORCA detector could in principle also reveal sizeable discrepancies from
expectations due to non-standard physics interactions (NSIs) [181, 182]. While strong
deviations from expectations (e.g. enhanced CP violation effects) might deteriorate the sen-
sitivity to the NMH, a more likely scenario is that KM3NeT/ORCA will be able to invalidate
many NSI processes.

The studies presented here indicate that the current unknown value of the Dirac CP
violating phase in the neutrino sector mildly impacts the sensitivity to the neutrino mass
ordering. However, the knowledge of the mass ordering could reversely bring sensitivity to
the CP phase in the (0.2–1)GeV regime [141]. This would imply a denser instrumentation
than what is currently envisaged for ORCA, but considering the importance of measuring the
CP phase, sensitivity studies could be performed for a further step of the ORCA project. In
the same spirit, sensitivity studies for both the NMH and the CP phase have been proposed
relying on a putative upgraded neutrino beam to be sent to ORCA from Protvino [183, 184].
Such a strategy would in particular allow for a confirmation of ORCA-only results on the
NMH with high statistical power on a short (< 1 yr) timescale [185]. It would require a new
beam-line to be setup but would offer the advantage to rely on an already built detector.

With its low energy threshold the KM3NeT/ORCA detector offers the possibility to
extend searches started with ANTARES (e.g. [77, 79]) (and likely to be pursued with
KM3NeT/ARCA as well) for extra-terrestrial neutrinos as a signature of the presence of dark
matter in the centre of the Earth, the Sun and the central region of the Galaxy for which the
detector is particularly well located. The low energy threshold of KM3NeT/ORCA is par-
ticularly well suited to constrain low-mass weakly interacting massive particle dark matter
models. All neutrino flavours could be used for such studies, considering the encouraging first
performances in the shower reconstruction channel.

GeV neutrinos are also likely to be emitted by several classes of astrophysical objects like
low-energy GRBs [186] or colliding wind binaries [187]. Another promising topic is the
ability of KM3NeT/ORCA to detect neutrinos from supernovae (SN) explosions. The use of
segmented optical modules closely placed to one another indeed offers new detection cap-
abilities: asking for coincidences of many phototubes on individual storeys is expected to
strongly reduce the optical background potentially providing high sensitivity to SN up to few
tens of kpc. These results will possibly be incorporated in an update of the present document,
together with the prospects for several other physics studies that can be undertaken with
KM3NeT/ORCA. These span a wide range of scientific fields, including the Earth and Sea
Sciences which are not addressed here but are part of the scientific scope of deep-sea neutrino
observatories. As an example, a detailed study of the neutrino energy and angular distribu-
tions could provide tomographic information on the electron density [188–190], and thus on
the composition, of the different Earth layers traversed. Such an approach is complementary
to the standard methods used in geophysics, which do not univocally constrain the chemical
composition of the Earth, in particular of its innermost layers (mantle and core).

5. Organisation

KM3NeT federates and unifies the various smaller European efforts in the field of Neutrino
Astronomy. The process of convergence was supported by an EU funded Design Study
(2008–2009) and Preparatory Phase (2008–2012). The KM3NeT consortium has now formed
a collaboration with an elected management. The funding agencies (or funding authorities)
involved have installed the Resources Review Board (RRB) which oversees the project. The
RRB is advised by an international Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC). A
project organisation is setup with the objective to implement the first phase (Phase-1) of the
KM3NeT Research Infrastructure. To this end, a MoU, covering the total available budget of
about €31M, has been signed by the members of the RRB. The purpose of this MoU is to
define the programme of work to be carried out for this phase and the distribution of charges
and responsibilities among the Parties and Institutes for the execution of this work. The MoU
sets out (i) the organisational, managerial and financial guidelines to be followed by the
collaboration, (ii) the external scientific and technical review processes and (iii) the user
access policy. At present, the collaboration consists of more than 240 persons from 52
institutes. The first phase has already started and comprises the final prototyping and pre-
production, engineering, construction, calibration, transportation, assembly, installation and
commissioning of the elements which form the basis of the KM3NeT neutrino detector and
the seafloor and shore station infrastructures as well as the operation of the installed neutrino
detectors. The installation is proceeding in two places, off-shore Toulon, France and off-shore
Capo Passero, Italy. A third suitable site is available off-shore Pylos, Greece. The con-
struction of the Phase-1 detector has already started with the successful deployment of the
first string off-shore Capo Passero and will be completed by 2017.

The Collaboration will offer open access for external users to the KM3NeT Research
Infrastructure (Article 15 of the MoU). The KM3NeT Research Infrastructure will also
provide user ports for continuous Earth and Sea science measurements in the deep-sea
environment. The needs for the Earth and Sea sciences are partly incorporated in the present
KM3NeT MoU and other needs will be detailed in designated MoUs between KM3NeT and
individual Earth and Sea science groups or more generally with EMSO.

The Phase 1 MoU is a first step towards the intended establishment of a European
Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). The collaboration has agreed to host the
KM3NeT ERIC in The Netherlands. The neutrino signal recently reported by IceCube has led
the KM3NeT Collaboration to propose an intermediate phase (i.e. Phase-2.0). The required
actions for the next phase(s) are being taken which include the preparation of requests for
additional ERDF funds in France, Italy and Greece as well as requests for national funds.
Other support options, e.g. within the framework of Horizon 2020, will also be explored.

Recently, the KM3NeT and ANTARES Collaborations have agreed to organise each
general assembly jointly (typically 3–4 times per year). This agreement fosters the scientific
progress and the exchange of know-how and limits travel times and expenses. Following a
sequence of joint meetings between ANTARES (Mediterranean Sea), IceCube (South Pole),
Lake Baikal (Russia) and KM3NeT (Mediterranean Sea), a MoU for a Global Neutrino
Network (GNN) has been signed on 15 October 2013 by the representatives of each project.
This step formalises the active collaboration between these projects. Once infrastructures of
similar scale are operational on the three continents, the stated aim of the GNN is a worldwide
Global Neutrino Observatory.

6. Data policy

The KM3NeT Collaboration has developed a data policy based on the research, educational
and outreach goals of the facility. The first exploitation of the data is granted to the colla-
boration members as they build, maintain and operate the facility and to priority users.
Accordingly, each collaboration member has full access rights to all data, software and know-
how. Access for non-members is restricted, as long as methods and results have not yet been
published. The prompt dissemination of scientific results, new methods and implementations
is a central goal of the project, as is education. High-level data (event information enriched
with quality information) will be published after an embargo time of two years under an open
access policy on a web-based service. Exceptional access rights that correspond to these goals
can be granted.

The Collaboration has developed measures to ensure the reproducibility and usability of
all scientific results over the full lifetime of the project and in addition 10 years after shut-
down. Low-level data (as recorded by the experiment) and high-level data will be stored in
parallel at central places. A central software repository, central software builds and operation
system images are provided and continuously maintained until the end of the experiment.

The storage and computing needs of the KM3NeT project are highly advanced. The
Collaboration has developed a data management plan and a corresponding computing model
to answer those needs. The latter is based on the LHC computing models utilising a hier-
archical data processing system with different layers (tiers). Data are stored on two main
storage centres (CCIN2P3-Lyon, CNRS and CNAF, INFN); those large data centres are fully
interfaced with the major European e-Infrastructures, including GRID-facilities (ReCaS,
HellasGRID provide resources to KM3NeT). The main node for processing of the neutrino
telescope data is the computer centre in Lyon (CCIN2P3-Lyon). A corresponding long-term

J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 43 (2016) 084001 S Adrián-Martínez et al

121



and sustainable commitment has already been made by CNRS, which is consistent with the
needs for long-term preservation of the data. A specialised service group within the Colla-
boration will process the data from low-level to high-level and will provide data-related
services (including documentation and support on data handling) to the Collaboration and
partners. WAN (GRID) access tools (e.g. xrootd, iRODS, and gridFTP) provide the access to
high-level data for the Collaboration. The analysis of these data will be pursued at the local
e-Infrastructures of the involved institutes (both local and national). The chosen data formats
allow for the use of common data analysis tools (e.g. the ROOT data analysis framework) and
for integration into e-Infrastructure common services.

The central services are mainly funded through CNRS and INFN that have pledged
resources of their main computing centres to the project. Additional storage space and its
management are provided by the partner institutes (e.g. INFN has provided 500 TB of disk
space for KM3NeT at the ReCaS GRID infrastructure, the Hellenic Open University has
pledged 100 TB of disc space and 300 cores to the project).

In addition to the major storage, networking and computing resources provided by the
partner institutions and their computing centres, grid resources have been pledged and will be
used by KM3NeT (ReCaS, HellasGRID). These will provide significant resources to be used
for specialised tasks (as e.g. for special simulation needs). The major resources, however, will
be provided by the partners. External services are employed to integrate the KM3NeT
e-Infrastructure into the European context of the GRID—in the fields of data management,
security and access; services will be implemented in collaboration with EGI.

One of the aims of the KM3NeT data management plan is to play an active role in the
development and utilisation of e-Infrastructure commons. KM3NeT will therefore contribute
to the development of standards and services in the e-Infrastructures both in the specific
research field and in general. In the framework of the GNN, KM3NeT will cooperate with the
ANTARES, IceCube and GVD collaborations to contribute to the open science concept by
providing access to high-level data and data analysis tools, not only in common data analyses
but also for use by citizen scientists.

In the framework of the ASTERICS project, KM3NeT will develop an interface to the
Virtual Observatory including training tools and training programmes to enhance the scien-
tific impact of the neutrino telescope and encourage the use of its data by a wide scientific
community including interested citizen scientists. Data derived from the operation of the
experiment (acoustics, environmental monitoring) will be of interest also outside of the field.
Designated documentation and courses for external users will therefore be put in place to
facilitate the use of the repositories and tools developed and used by the KM3NeT
Collaboration.

7. Cost and time schedule

The investment budget for the construction of the first phase (Phase-1) of the KM3NeT
research infrastructure, which is fully funded, amounts to about €31M. During 2015-2017, 31
strings equipped with 558 optical modules will be assembled and deployed at the French and
Italian sites. The overall size of the initial Phase-1 arrays corresponds to about 0.2 building
blocks.

The next phase (i.e. KM3NeT 2.0) comprises a complete ARCA and ORCA detector,
consisting of 2 and 1 building blocks, respectively. The additional budget for KM3NeT 2.0 is
estimated at €95M. The cost estimates of KM3NeT 2.0 are based on the actual prices of
Phase-1 and thus can be considered accurate.

The breakdown of the cost amongst the major items is illustrated in figure 109. They are 
consistent with the estimations stated in the KM3NeT Technical Design Report published in 
2011 and represent a factor of four cost reduction compared to that previously achieved for 
the ANTARES detector. The cost of a single KM3NeT string is about €230 k, an additional 
€90 k is needed for the interlink cable, the string deployment and the ROV connection.

Once the funds for Phase-2.0 are available, the array could be constructed within three
years. Thus, if funds were forthcoming in 2017, the full array could be completed in 2020.
Note that physics studies would already be possible as the array is being constructed, thus
reducing the overall time needed to obtain a specified precision. The cost for operation and
decommissioning of the infrastructure have been evaluated and amount to about €2Mper
year and €5M, respectively. Hence, the total cost for 10 years of operation and decom-
missioning of the KM3NeT 2.0 infrastructure adds about 25% to the total budget.
