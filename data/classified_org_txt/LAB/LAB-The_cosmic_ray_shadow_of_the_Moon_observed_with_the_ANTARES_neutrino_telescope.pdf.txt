Abstract One of the main objectives of the ANTARES
telescope is the search for point-like neutrino sources. Both
the pointing accuracy and the angular resolution of the detec-
tor are important in this context and a reliable way to evaluate
this performance is needed. In order to measure the point-
ing accuracy of the detector, one possibility is to study the
shadow of the Moon, i.e. the deficit of the atmospheric muon
flux from the direction of the Moon induced by the absorp-
tion of cosmic rays. Analysing the data taken between 2007
and 2016, the Moon shadow is observed with 3.5σ statistical
significance. The detector angular resolution for downward-
going muons is 0.73◦ ±0.14◦. The resulting pointing perfor-
mance is consistent with the expectations. An independent
check of the telescope pointing accuracy is realised with the
data collected by a shower array detector onboard of a ship
temporarily moving around the ANTARES location.

1 Introduction

The detection of cosmic neutrinos is a new and unique meth-
od to study the Universe. The weakly interacting nature of
neutrinos makes them a complementary cosmic probe to oth-
er messengers such as the electromagnetic radiation, γ -rays,
gravitational waves and charged cosmic rays. Neutrinos can
travel cosmological distances, crossing regions with high
matter or radiation field densities, without being absorbed.
They allow the observation of the distant Universe and the
interior of the astrophysical sources.

A milestone has been set with the first evidence of a cosmic
signal of high-energy neutrinos [1] by the IceCube detector
[2,3]. The ANTARES telescope [4], although much smaller

a e-mail: tommaso.chiarusi@bo.infn.it
b e-mail: matteo.sanguineti@ge.infn.it

than the IceCube detector, is the largest undersea neutrino
telescope currently in operation. One of its main goals is the
search for astrophysical point-like sources of neutrinos. To
this aim, the pointing accuracy of the detector is important
and an evaluation of this performance is required.

The interaction of cosmic rays in the atmosphere pro-
duces downward-going muons that can be recorded by under-
ground, underice or underwater experiments. Atmospher-ic
muons represent a large source of background for cosmic
neutrino detection, but at the same time they can be used to
calibrate the detector. Due to absorption effects of cosmic
rays by the Moon, a deficit in the atmospheric muon event
density (expressed as number of events per square degrees)
in the direction of the Moon, the so-called Moon shadow,
is expected. With this approach, the Moon shadow has been
already measured and reported by MACRO [5], SOUDAN
[6], L3+Cosmics [7] and by IceCube [8] Collaborations.
It is worthy to mention here that other experiments, like
CYGNUS [9], TIBET [10], CASA [11], ARGO-YBJ [12],
and recently also HAWC [13] measured the Moon shadow
by exploiting surface arrays detectors.

This work presents the first measurement of ANTARES
angular resolution with atmospheric downward-going muons
and the detector pointing performance making use of a
celestial source for calibrations. A complementary estima-
tion of the telescope pointing accuracy has been performed
by means of a surface array of particle detectors arranged
onboard a ship deck. The ship was temporarily routing above
the ANTARES detector, allowing to correlate the signals
from the detection of atmospheric showers with the signals
induced by downward-going muons in the underwater tele-
scope.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 the
ANTARES detector is introduced together with the moti-
vations of the present analysis; in Sect. 3 the Moon shadow
analysis is described; the surface array analysis is presented
in Sect. 4 and the conclusions are reported in Sect. 5.

2 The ANTARES neutrino telescope

The ANTARES detector is deployed 40 km offshore from
Toulon, France (42◦48′N, 6◦10′E) anchored at a depth of
about 2475 m. The telescope detects the Cherenkov light
stimulated in the medium by relativistic particles by means
of a three dimensional grid of optical modules (OMs), pres-
sure resistant glass spheres each containing one 10′′ pho-
tomultiplier tube (PMT). The OMs are arranged in triplets,
forming a storey, along twelve vertical lines, for a total of
885 OMs [4]. The lines are anchored on the sea bottom and
kept taut by a buoy at the top. Each PMT is nominally ori-
ented 45◦ downward with respect to the vertical direction.
This orientation enhances the efficiency for the reconstruc-
tion of upward-going tracks, but still allows the detection
of downward-going muons with smaller efficiency. A tita-
nium cylinder in each storey houses the electronics for read-
out and control, together with compasses and tiltmeters. The
total length of each line is 450 m, without any instrument
along the lower 100 m. The distance between storeys is 14.5
m and the distance between two lines ranges between 60
and 75 m. The lines are connected to a central junction box
which, in turn, is connected to shore via an electro-optical
cable. Due to sea currents, a positioning system comprising
hydrophones, compasses and tiltmeters is used to monitor
the detector geometry [14]. Finally the absolute orientation
is provided by the triangulation of acoustic signals between
lines and the deployment vessel at the sea surface using GPS
[14,15]. The first detection line was deployed in 2006; the
detector was completed in 2008.

The recorded information of each photon detected on a
PMT is referred to as hit, and consists of the detection time,
the amount of electric charge measured on the PMT anode
and the PMT identification. The ensemble of hits contained
in a certain time-window, identified after some trigger con-
dition, is called event. Muon candidates are identified by
requiring spacetime causality between the hits of one event
[16,17]. The quality of the reconstruction of muon trajecto-
ries depends on the goodness of such spacetime correlation.

3 The Moon shadow analysis

Atmospheric muons are a valuable resource for validating
the detector performance and characterising some of the pos-
sible systematics associated to the experimental setup. The
muons produced in the interactions of primary cosmic rays

in the upper layers of the atmosphere can traverse several
kilometres of water equivalent; for this reason only down-
ward-going atmospheric muons can be measured [18–20].
For those primary cosmic rays absorbed by the Moon, a
deficit in the flux of the secondary muons can be measured,
being directly correlated to the position of the Moon in the
sky.

The energy threshold for muons detectable at the depth
of the ANTARES telescope is about 500 GeV when they
are at the sea surface level, most of them with energy above
1 TeV. Primaries which are progenitors of such highly ener-
getic muons are practically not affected by the Earth geomag-
netic field. This assumption of large rigidity holds also for
the secondary muons detected by the ANTARES detector,
thus they can be exploited in the study of the Moon shadow
without introducing any bias. The smearing of muon direc-
tion with respect to the primary cosmic rays due to pion
transverse momentum and pion decay is limited by the large
Lorentz factor [21]. The analysis presented in this paper cov-
ers the data-taking period spanning from 2007 to 2016, cor-
responding to a total live-time of 3128 days. Figure 1 shows
the position of the Moon in the horizontal coordinate system
of the detector for such a period. The Moon altitude ranges
above the horizon up to about 75◦.

The analysis is performed in three steps, described in
Sect. 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. First, quality cuts are defined to reduce
the number of candidate atmospheric muon events to a sam-
ple which provides the best sensitivity for this search. The
second part concerns the estimation of the telescope angu-
lar resolution for atmospheric muons by studying the mono-
dimensional profile of the Moon shadow. In the third part, the
pointing precision is determined evaluating a possible shift
of the measured direction of the Moon with respect to the
nominal values provided by astronomical libraries [24].

3.1 Optimisation of quality cuts

A dedicated Monte Carlo (MC) production is used to opti-
mize the selection criteria applied to the reconstructed muon
tracks. The MC generation of the atmospheric muon sam-
ple is performed with the MUPAGE code [25], which was
proved to reliably reproduce this background source in sev-
eral ANTARES analyses, such as reported in [26–28] .
MUPAGE implements parametric formulas for the flux, the
radial distribution, the multiplicity and the energy spectrum
of muons at a given depth, allowing for a fast production of
both single and bundle muon events. Muons are generated
on the surface of a cylinder-shaped volume of water, 650 m
high, with a radius of 290 m, containing the detector. This
volume is larger than the instrumented volume and corre-
sponds to the region in which muons can produce detectable
signals. The generation of the MC sample is subdivided in
different batches corresponding to the periods of data-taking,

Fig. 1 The visible and invisible sectors of the position of the Moon for
ANTARES with respect to the detector horizontal coordinate system.
The occurrences of the Moon position are computed at each hour in the
period 2007–2016 with the library SkyField [22]. The map is arranged

according to the Mollweide equal-area view obtained with the use of
the HEALPIX package [23], setting the parameter NSI DE = 64 (i.e.
49152 pixels)

referred to as runs. The simulation reproduces the effective
data taking conditions of the ANTARES detector, which can
vary on a run-by-run basis [29]. The simulation includes the
generation of Cherenkov light stimulated by the muon and
its propagation up to the PMTs on the basis of the measured
characteristics of light propagation [30]. Optical background,
caused by bioluminescence and radioactive isotopes (mainly
40K) present in sea water, is also added according to the mea-
sured rate. This technique allows to correlate the actual time
of each run to the position of the Moon in the sky. In partic-
ular, it is possible to assign an absolute time-stamp, gener-
ated randomly within the period of each considered run, to
each MC event reconstructed as a downward-going muon.
A detailed production compliant with the actual live time is
used to generate, reconstruct and select the MC sample of
events within the restricted area of 10◦ around the nominal
position of the Moon at the time of each event. In order to
evaluate the contamination of mis-reconstructed events in the
proximity of the Moon, a smaller MC sample, with 1/3 of the
actual live time, is generated over the whole visible sky.

The detector response is then simulated taking into
account the main features of the PMTs and of the electronics
[31,32]. Finally, the PMT signals are processed to reconstruct
the atmospheric muon tracks with the standard ANTARES
algorithm for track-like events. This is a robust track-fitting
procedure based on a likelihood maximisation [17]. Figures
of merit are determined by means of two quality parameters:
Λ, which varies linearly with the logarithm of the recon-

structed track likelihood, and β, the angular error associated
to the reconstructed direction.

Two different MC simulation sets are prepared: the sam-
ple S1 considering the shadowing effect of the Moon and the
sample S0 without this effect. In the sample S1, the Moon
shadow is obtained by removing the muons generated within
the Moon disk, assuming a radius of 0.26◦. The information
from all the considered simulated runs is combined to obtain
statistical evidence of the Moon shadow. For each of the two
MC samples, S1 and S0, a one dimensional histogram is built
with the distribution of events as a function of the angular
distance δ with respect to the Moon, up to 10◦. Such a his-
togram is subdivided into 25 bins, each one sized Δδ = 0.4◦
and corresponding to an annulus of increasing radius cen-
tered on the Moon. The content of each bin is normalised to
the corresponding annulus area, resulting in an event density.

The cuts on the quality parameters Λ and β are chosen to
achieve the best sensitivity for the Moon shadow detection.
The approach of the hypothesis test is used: the null hypoth-
esis H0 relates to the case of atmospheric muons without
the Moon shadow, while the alternative hypothesis H1 cor-
responds to the presence of the Moon. The used test statistic

is defined as λ = −2 log LH1LH0 , with LH0 and LH1 the likeli-
hoods obtained under the H0 and H1 hypotheses. Assuming
that the event population in each bin follows a Poisson proba-
bility distribution, using the χ2 definition in [33], the chosen

fied. The shaded area quantifies the expected median significance (here

where ni stands for the measurement in the i-th bin to be
compared with the expectations Ni,H under the H0 and H1
hypotheses. The following reduced expression for λ is used:

, (3)

where for simplicity the expected counts Ni,H0 and Ni,H1 are
renamed as νi and μi , respectively. The two possible distribu-
tions of λ, f (λ|H0) and f (λ|H1), valid separately under the
hypotheses H0 and H1, respectively, are obtained by means
of pseudo-experiments (PEs). The number of events in the
i-th bin ni is determined by extracting 10

6 random values
generated according to a Poisson distribution with expecta-
tion values equal to νi and μi .

Several hypothesis tests are performed assuming differ-
ent selection criteria for Λ and β. For each set of values,
the distributions f (λ|H0) and f (λ|H1) are compared. The
median of f (λ|H1) is taken as the critical value for λ, i.e.
as the threshold to separate the two hypothesis. The set of
best cut values of Λ and β corresponds to that for which the
two f (λ|H) distributions have the minimal overlap. Figure 2
shows the distribution f (λ|H0) (black curve) and f (λ|H1)
(red curve) for the optimised quality cuts Λcut = −5.9,
βcut = 0.8◦, and the critical value is λ = −6.15. The dashed
area below f (λ|H1) represents the fraction of PEs where the

tance δ from the Moon. Data histogram is shown with statistical errors;
the smooth line is the best fit according to Eq. (4); the shaded area
corresponds to the apparent radius of the Moon (0.26◦)

Moon shadow hypothesis is correctly identified; the filled-
coloured area below f (λ|H0) corresponds to a p-value equal
to 3.6 × 10−4, or equivalently 3.4 σ . This is the expected
median significance of the Moon shadow effect with the MC
data set.

3.2 Deficit significance and angular resolution

The optimized quality cuts reported above are applied to
the data sample collected in the period 2007–2016, selecting
9.6 × 105 events out of the pre-cuts collection about three
times larger. Figure 3 shows the resulting distribution for the
muon density as a function of δ in the range of 0◦ ≤ δ ≤ 10◦
with bin size of Δδ = 0.4◦. A clear deficit of events is evident
in the region around the Moon position (δ < 1.2◦).

For the estimation of the angular resolution, the Moon
shadowing effect is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribu-
tion with standard deviation σres , which corresponds to the
detector angular resolution itself. This is motivated by the
fact that the apparent size of the Moon in the sky is suffi-
ciently small compared to the expected value of the detector
angular resolution, affecting the estimation by less than a few
percents. A similar approach has already been followed by
[5,8,34]. The number of expected events is evaluated by fit-
ting the distribution in Fig. 3 with the following function [6]:

dn

dδ2
= k

(
1 − R

2
Moon

2σ 2res
e
− δ2

2σ2res

)
. (4)

The two free parameters are k, the average muon event
density in the H0 scenario, and σres . The Moon radius RMoon
is fixed to 0.26◦.

The angular resolution for downward-going atmospheric
muons resulting from the fit is σres = 0.73◦ ± 0.14◦, with

123



1006 Page 6 of 9 Eur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78 :1006

the fitted value of k = 2376 ± 3 events per square degrees.
The goodness of the fit is found to be χ2/dof = 23.5/23.

The significance of the shadowing is evaluated using
a χ2 test comparing the measured event density with the
flat distribution dn

dδ2
= k. Such χ2 test leads to a p-value

equal to 4.3 × 10−4 corresponding to a significance of the
Moon shadow effect of 3.3 σ . This value is compatible with
the expected significance of the Monte Carlo previously
described.

3.3 Absolute pointing

The procedure for evaluating the pointing accuracy of the
Moon shadow is partially inspired by [5]; it is based on
determining the statistical significance of the selected data
set under the assumption of the Moon in a given direction.
All possible placements are considered within a field of view
(FoV) centered on the nominal position of the Moon. This
work differs from [5] in the way the significance of the results
is evaluated.

The event distribution of the detected muons, compliant
to the determined quality cuts, is represented as function of
x = (αμ − αMoon) × cos(hμ) and y = hμ − hMoon ; here
(αμ, hμ) and (αMoon, hMoon) are the horizontal coordinates
of the track and the Moon, respectively, at the time of the
event.

The FoV is limited in both x and y within the range
[−10◦, 10◦], and it is subdivided in a grid of 0.2◦ × 0.2◦
squared bins. The used test statistic is again λ as reported in
Eq. (3), but now the sum is evaluated on all 100×100 square
bins.

The expectations under H0 are obtained parameterising
the event distribution of the measured atmospheric muons
which fall in the FoV relative to the position of the Moon
four hours before the timestamp of each event. The param-
eterisation is done with a second degree polynomial of the
form:

p2(x, y, k|H0) = k0 + k1x + k2x2 + k3y + k4y2, (5)
with the fitted parameter array k ≡ {93.6±1.8, 0.19±0.16,
(−8.2 ± 3.1) × 10−3, 3.98 ± 0.17, (5.60 ± 0.32) × 10−2}.
The goodness of the fit is χ2/dof = 9993/9995 for this set
of values k, corresponding to a p-value ≈ 0.5; it validates
the modelling of the event distribution in the absence of the

Figures 4a, b represent the projection of the event distri-
bution in the FoV onto the x and y axes in the absence of
the Moon shadow, also called marginal distributions. The
marginal distribution for x is almost flat, compliant with
the expected lack of any significant structure in the atmo-
spheric muon flux along the azimuth. On the contrary, the
marginal distribution for y shows an almost linear ramping

The expectations under H1 are then obtained by subtract-
ing from p2(x, y, k|H0) a bi-dimensional Gaussian point
spread function:

In Eq. (6) the same spread is assumed in both dimensions, so
that σx = σy ≡ σres . The σres is fixed to value of the angular
resolution found in the previous sub-section. The array of
free parameters θ is composed of the amplitude of the Moon
deficit A and the assumed position of the Moon (xs, ys) in
the FoV.

For each bin in the FoV, the value of the test statistic λ
is minimised finding the best estimation of A. The smallest
value λmin is found equal to −17.05, for the fitted deficit
amplitude Amin = 20 ± 5, in the bin with center in x = 0.5◦
and y = 0.1◦. Such coordinates are taken as the best esti-

Fig. 5 Measured distribution of the test statistic λ from Eq. (3) in the
field of view around the Moon nominal position O ≡ (0◦, 0◦), indicated
by a white cross. The white dot refers to the coordinates (0.5◦, 0.1◦)
where the test statistics reaches the minimum (λmin = −17.05)

mation of the position of the Moon. The test statistic λO in
the nominal position O ≡ (0◦, 0◦) is found equal to −13.37
for the corresponding amplitude AO = 19 ± 5. At each bin,
−λ follows the distribution of a central χ2 with one degree
of freedom, assuming H0 as true. This allows to estimate the
discrepancy of the measured data from the assumption of the
absence of the Moon. ConsideringλO , ap-value of 2.6×10−4
is obtained, which corresponds to a significance of 3.5 σ , in
agreement with what is reported in the above Sect. 3.2. Fig-
ure 5 shows the λ distribution in the FoV. It can be interpreted
as a bi-dimensional profile-likelihood, with A treat-ed as the
nuisance parameter. The interval corresponding to a desired
confidence level (CL) is obtained for λ ≤ λcut = λmin + Q,
where Q is the quantile accounting for two degrees of free-
dom and confidence level CL [35].

An additional strategy is used to cross-check the confi-
dence intervals found with the method reported above. This
is done by exploiting the PE technique. In each bin of the
FoV, a reference number of events {ni }re f is computed using
the superposition of Eqs. (5) and (6). For this purpose the
Moon is assumed to be in O , σres = 0.73◦ and A = AO .
For each PE, a corresponding data set {ni }PE is extracted
as Possionian fluctuations of the reference set {ni }re f . Using
105 PEs, the distribution of the best value of λ j is determined
at the j-th bin of the FoV.

For each λ j distribution, the range
(
−∞, λCLj

]
is consid-

ered, where λCLj is the value of λ j such that its cumulative

distribution is F(λCLj ) = CL; the j-th bin is included into
the confidence interval if λmj ≤ λCLj .

Figure 6 shows the estimation of the confidence regions
for CL ≡ {68.27%, 95.45%, 99.73%} using both the meth-

Fig. 6 Contour plots corresponding to different confidence lev-
els (cyan/dashed: 68.27%; green/dot-dashed: 95.45%; red/dotted:
99.73%), computed with the two methods described in the text. In the
zoom, the dot represents the position in the FoV where λmin = −17.05.
The cross indicates the nominal position of the Moon

ods explained above. The contours found with the first and the
second methods are indicated by colours and lines, respec-
tively. The contour plots of the two approaches are in excel-
lent agreement.

The statistical significance of the apparent shift with
respect to the Moon nominal position is determined using
PEs. The method relies on the probability density function
of the test statistics Θ = λO−λmin , with λO and λmin defined
as before. The Θ test statistic is interpreted as a profile like-
lihood whose distribution asymptotically tends to that one of
a χ2 with two degrees of freedom.

In Fig. 7 the normalised distribution of the Θ test statis-
tic is shown, where the measured value of the test statistic
Θmeas = 3.68 is indicated for reference by the red-dashed
line. Integrating the Θ distribution for values larger than
Θmeas , a p-value = 0.23 is obtained, corresponding to a sig-
nificance of 1.2 σ . This indicates that the shift is compatible
with a statistical fluctuation.

4 Analysis of data collected with a surface array

The pointing performance of the ANTARES telescope is
cross-checked in a completely independent way, exploiting
the measurements made with a surface array detector. The
device was temporarily onboard of a ship circulating around
the position of the telescope, synchronised to a GPS refer-
ence. The surface array was composed of a set of 15 liquid
scintillator detection units, designed for the measurement of

atmospheric showers, placed over an area of about 50 m
× 14 m on the ship deck. Each scintillator unit included
a polyethylene-aluminium box filled with linear alkylben-
zene doped with wavelength shifters. The scintillation light
was detected using 2′′ PMTs, one per unit. Each scintilla-
tor unit had a single rate of around 100 Hz. The pointing
accuracy of the ANTARES detector is inferred by com-
bining the data from the surface array and the undersea
telescope.

Two different sea campaigns were performed: a first cam-
paign of seven days in 2011 and a second campaign of six
days in 2012. Given the area covered by the ship routing
above the ANTARES telescope, the range of the muon zenith
θ is limited to 2◦ ≤ θ ≤ 27◦. Figure 8 shows the recorded
positions on the sea surface of the ship during these two peri-
ods.

The shower array is used to trigger the possible time-
correlations with the ANTARES events. The typical trigger
rate of the surface array is around 1 Hz requiring coinci-
dences in at least 3 detection units in a 650 ns time window.
The rate of reconstructed muons is ∼ 0.25 Hz when apply-
ing cuts on the quality parameters Λ ≥ −6 and β ≤ 0.6◦.
The coincidence time-window between the surface array and
the underwater telescope is set to 10 μs. The rate of coinci-
dences is about 40 per day, with an expected rate of random
coincidences of about 0.2 events per day.

The direction of the atmospheric shower is estimated by
correlating the GPS position of the ship with the ANTARES
barycentre. An uncertainty of 25 m, about one half of the
ship deck hosting the shower array, is assumed for the shower
position detected by the array. An error of 70 m is considered
for the possible displacement of the muon/muon bundle axis
inside the detector volume. Considering only the ship routes

Fig. 9 Left: the difference between the zenith angles of the shower axis
(determined as the direction of the ship with respect to the ANTARES
location) and of the reconstructed muon underwater. Right: the same for
the azimuth angles. Fit results: Δθmean = −0.07◦ ± 0.22◦; Δφmean =
−0.5◦ ± 0.8◦

with radius larger than 500 m, the estimated resolutions are
∼ 3◦ in zenith and ∼ 8◦ in azimuth.

The results of the two campaigns are shown in Fig. 9:
the represented Δθ (left) and Δφ (right) are the differences
between the directions of the shower axis and the recon-
structed muon underwater.

According to the Gaussian fit of the two distributions in
Fig. 9, the absolute pointing appears to be consistent with
the nominal expectations, i.e. with a null systematic shift in
both zenith and azimuth within the errors (see caption of Fig.
9). The large uncertainty in the azimuth estimation is due to
the low zenith angle tested during the campaigns, as can be
derived from Fig. 8. The results of the surface array analysis
are in good agreement with the pointing performance found
with the Moon shadow analysis.

5 Conclusions

This paper describes the estimations of the pointing perfor-
mance of the ANTARES telescope using the Moon shadow
effect and a dedicated surface array.

The selected events from the data recorded in the 2007-
2016 period with altitude angles 0◦ ≤ h ≤ 75◦, allowed
the identification of the Moon shadow with 3.5 σ statistical
significance. The corresponding detector angular resolution
for downward-going atmospheric muons is 0.73◦ ± 0.14◦.

The pointing accuracy of the detector is consistent with
the expectations.
