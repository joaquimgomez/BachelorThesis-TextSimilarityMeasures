ABSTRACT

We report on the discovery of a new fast radio burst, FRB 150215, with the Parkes
radio telescope on 2015 February 15. The burst was detected in real time with a
dispersion measure (DM) of 1105.6±0.8 pc cm−3, a pulse duration of 2.8+1.2−0.5 ms, and
a measured peak flux density assuming the burst was at beam center of 0.7+0.2−0.1 Jy.
The FRB originated at a Galactic longitude and latitude of 24.66◦, 5.28◦, 25 degrees
away from the Galactic Center. The burst was found to be 43±5% linearly polarized
with a rotation measure (RM) in the range −9 < RM < 12 rad m−2 (95% confidence
level), consistent with zero. The burst was followed-up with 11 telescopes to search
for radio, optical, X-ray, γ-ray and neutrino emission. Neither transient nor variable
emission was found to be associated with the burst and no repeat pulses have been
observed in 17.25 hours of observing. The sightline to the burst is close to the Galactic
plane and the observed physical properties of FRB 150215 demonstrate the existence
of sight lines of anomalously low RM for a given electron column density. The Galactic
RM foreground may approach a null value due to magnetic field reversals along the
line of sight, a decreased total electron column density from the Milky Way, or some
combination of these effects. A lower Galactic DM contribution might explain why
this burst was detectable whereas previous searches at low latitude have had lower
detection rates than those out of the plane.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond duration
pulses identified in high time resolution radio observations
(see Petroff et al. 2016, and references therein). Like radio
pulses from pulsars, FRBs experience dispersion due to
ionised matter which can be quantified by a dispersion
measure (DM); observationally this is seen as a frequency-
dependent time delay of the radio pulse across the observing
band. FRBs have DMs well in excess of the expected
contribution from free electrons in the interstellar medium

(ISM) leading to theories that they have an extragalactic
origin (Katz 2016). If a significant population of FRBs
originate at redshift z & 1.0 they may be useful as powerful
cosmological probes (Deng & Zhang 2014; Gao et al. 2014;
Macquart et al. 2015). Twenty-one FRB sources have been
reported to date1; however, a rapid population growth is
expected in the near future due to new instruments and
ongoing surveys (Keane et al. 2016; Caleb et al. 2017; Ng
et al. 2017; van Leeuwen 2014).

The nature of FRB progenitors remain highly debated

and progenitor theories currently outnumber published
bursts. Only FRB 121102 has been seen by several tele-
scopes to repeat, ruling out cataclysmic progenitors for this
particular FRB (Spitler et al. 2016; Scholz et al. 2016). This
burst was localized to a dwarf galaxy at a redshift z = 0.19,
at a distance of approximately 1 Gpc (Chatterjee et al. 2017;
Tendulkar et al. 2017). The small host galaxy also contains
a radio source co-located with the position of the FRB
(Marcote et al. 2017). A convincing model for the source
of the millisecond radio bursts from FRB 121102 remains
unknown although extreme neutron star progenitors such as
a millisecond magnetar (Metzger et al. 2017) have recently
been invoked. Repeat bursts from this source are highly
clustered in time and some pulses are several times brighter
than the original burst detection. No such behaviour has been
seen yet for other FRBs despite, in some cases, hundreds of
hours of follow-up, or from known magnetars in the Galaxy.
It remains unknown whether FRB 121102 is typical of the
FRB population as no other FRBs have been localised to
their host galaxies from their detected radio pulses

Other attempts at FRB localization have relied on
multi-wavelength follow-up to search for coincident transient
emission. Radio imaging following the real-time detection of
FRB 150418 by Keane et al. (2016) revealed a variable radio
source dropping rapidly in flux density on a timescale of a few
days post-burst, possibly associated with the FRB, although
this case remains contested. Long-term radio imaging has
revealed that the radio source varies in flux density (Williams
& Berger 2016; Johnston et al. 2017) consistent with an
active galactic nucleus (AGN) (Akiyama & Johnson 2016).
Although Williams & Berger (2016) have argued against an
association, new data from Johnston et al. shows that the
probability of coincident detections is ∼ 8%. However, the
variable radio sky is poorly understood at ∼ 100 µJy levels
on these timescales. The unusual variability seen for this
radio source may or may not be related to the progenitor
of the FRB and it may be that, much like the early days of
short gamma-ray bursts (Berger 2014), this source remains
a borderline case at least until similar follow-ups have been
performed for a large number of FRBs.

Other recent follow-up efforts have produced exciting
results. DeLaunay et al. (2016) have reported a 380-s γ-ray
transient detected weakly by the Swift satellite temporally
coincident with FRB 131104. They propose an association
between this transient and the FRB, implying an extremely
energetic engine. Further follow-up with radio imaging by
Shannon & Ravi (2017) in the field of FRB 131104 revealed a
variable AGN at a different position from the γ-ray transient.
Ultimately, neither source can be precisely attributed to the
progenitor of the burst at present, and more data will be
needed.

Here we present the discovery of FRB 150215 close to
the Galactic plane with the Parkes radio telescope. This
burst was detected in real time with recorded polarization
and multi-wavelength follow-up, including observations with
the H.E.S.S. telescope at TeV γ-ray energies and the first
limits on neutrino flux coincident with a FRB from the
ANTARES neutrino detector. In Section 2 we briefly describe
the Parkes telescope observing setup; in Section 3 we present
FRB 150215 and the polarization properties of the burst.
Section 4 presents the multi-wavelength data taken after the
FRB detection. We discuss the results of our observations

in Section 5 and compare these to results from previously
detected bursts.

2 OBSERVATIONS

The results presented in this paper are from observations
taken as part of the 4-year project “Transient Radio Neutron
Stars” at the Parkes radio telescope (Parkes PID 786).
The purpose of this project was to study rotating radio
transients (RRATs), pulsars that emit irregularly and are
best found through their bright single pulses rather than
through periodicity searches (McLaughlin et al. 2006). New
candidates found in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey
(PMPS) and the High Time Resolution Universe survey
(HTRU), both conducted at Parkes (Manchester et al. 2001;
Keith et al. 2010), were re-observed and confirmed. Known
RRATs were monitored regularly to obtain period and period
derivative measurements when possible (Keane et al. 2011;
Burke-Spolaor et al. 2011).

Observations between June 2011 and October 2013 used
only the central beam of the 13-beam Parkes multibeam
receiver (Staveley-Smith et al. 1996), totalling 207 hours.
From October 2013 until the conclusion of the project in
March 2015 all 13 beams were used both as a coincidence
check to reduce spurious candidates from terrestrial radio
frequency interference (RFI) and to use all 13 beams to search
for FRBs; a further 311 hours of observations were performed
in this configuration. The majority of the observations for this
project were at low Galactic latitudes where the population
of pulsars is larger.

All data were recorded with the Berkeley Parkes
Swinburne Recorder (BPSR; Keith et al., 2010) as time-
frequency data cubes in filterbank format2. The BPSR system
records 1024 frequency channels over 400 MHz of bandwidth
centered at 1382 MHz; approximately 60 MHz (15%) of the
total bandwidth is discarded at the highest frequencies due
to satellite interference. The system records 8-bit data with
a sampling time of 64 µs which is then downsampled to
2-bit for storage to disk, preserving only total intensity. For
single pulse processing, all data have been searched for single
pulses with the heimdall3 software. As early as June 2013
it was possible to view streaming data from the telescope via
an online interface through the BPSR web controller. The
capability to search through incoming data in real-time for
FRBs was implemented in March 2014 and this search is
run for all observations taken with the BPSR backend. The
data are searched for single pulses with 1.5 × DMGalaxy 6
DM 6 2000 pc cm−3, where DMGalaxy is the modeled DM
of the Milky Way along the line of sight from the NE2001
electron density model (Cordes & Lazio 2002). While the
real-time search is being performed, 120 seconds of 8-bit data
are stored in a ring buffer connected to the BPSR system.
If a pulse is found in any beam which matches the criteria
for an FRB candidate, the 8-bit data for all 13 beams are
saved to disk and can be calibrated to obtain the Stokes
parameters from the full polarization information. Further

et al. (2015a).

3 FRB 150215

FRB 150215 was detected in an outer beam (beam 13) of
the Parkes multibeam receiver at UTC 2015 February 15
20:41:41.714, the time of arrival at 1.382 GHz. The burst
has a best-fit DM of 1105.6±0.8 pc cm−3 and observed
pulse duration of 2.8+1.2−0.5 ms, as shown in Figure 1; it was
detected in only a single beam of the receiver with an
observed peak flux density of 0.7+0.2−0.1 Jy and a fluence of
2.1+2.0−0.7 Jy ms. The burst was detected in a beam centered

at the position RA 18h:17m:27s Dec −04◦:54′:15′′ (J2000),
at Galactic coordinates (`, b) = (24.66◦, 5.28◦). The beam
half-power half-width is 7′ which we take as the uncertainty
on position along the inner dimension; however, since it was
detected in an outer beam the position is not well constrained
on one side. As such the above quoted flux density and fluence
are to be interpreted as lower limits. The full properties of the
event are given in Table 1, including derived cosmological
parameters based upon the DM excess from the NE2001
model by Cordes & Lazio (2002) (see Petroff et al. 2016, for
a full discussion of these calculations).

The burst was found approximately 25◦ from the
Galactic Center, the smallest angular separation for any
burst to date, at a low Galactic latitude. The estimated DM
contribution from the Milky Way along this sightline is 427
pc cm−3 from the NE2001 model (Cordes & Lazio 2002)
but 275 pc cm−3 from the YMW model, lower by 40% (Yao
et al. 2017). We take the difference in these two estimates as
an indication of the uncertainty in this parameter4. Despite

4 It should be noted that these models have high uncertainty,

perhaps 50% or more, when estimating the electron density in

Table 1. Observed and derived properties of FRB 150215. Derived

cosmological parameters are upper limits only and are highly model
dependent; here we have used the DM excess from the NE2001

model, H0 = 69.6 km s

2006).

having travelled through a larger fraction of the ionised Milky
Way than any other burst except FRB 010621 (Keane et al.
2012), FRB 150215 shows neither significant scattering nor
scintillation, as shown in Figure 2.

In December 2014 a radio frequency interference monitor
was installed at the Parkes telescope site. This monitor
enabled perytons, seemingly frequency-swept signals that
resembled FRBs in many ways (Burke-Spolaor et al. 2011),
to be traced back to their source, the on-site microwave
ovens, through the detection of coincident out-of-band RFI
(Petroff et al. 2015b). No correlated out-of-band RFI was
detected coincident with FRB 150215.

3.1 Polarization

The real-time detection system in operation at the Parkes
telescope detected the burst less than 10 seconds after it
occurred. The detection triggered a recording of 4.1 seconds
of full-Stokes data centered on the time of FRB 150215. A
calibrator observation was taken 1.5 hours after the detection
of the burst allowing for a polarized pulse profile to be
constructed. FRB 150215 was found to have high linear

the Galactic halo or in regions of low pulsar density (Deller et al.

2009).

√
Q2 + U2, with very

low circular polarization, V = 3±1%, shown in Figure 3.
Flux calibration was performed using a calibrator dataset
taken 6 days after the FRB during which time no receiver
or cabling changes were made. The uncertain position of
the FRB in the beam may affect the detected polarization
level. Studies of the polarization attenuation due to source
location in a Parkes beam were done by Ravi et al. (2016)
after the detection of FRB 150807 and it was shown for this
particular burst that even at the best-fit location for the burst
far off beam centre (in a non-central beam of the receiver)
the recovered polarization for a test pulsar was consistent
with the published profile. Even in the extreme case that
the true position of FRB 150215 is significantly offset from
the beam center, then, we may expect that the polarization
profile recovered in our observations is a reasonably accurate
measurement of the intrinsic polarization properties.

Only four FRBs have previously published measure-
ments of their polarized profiles and no two look alike.
FRB 140514 shows only significant circular polarization
(V = 21± 7%; Petroff et al. 2015a), FRB 150418 shows only
low level linear polarization (L = 8.5 ± 1.5%; Keane et al.
2016), FRB 110523 shows both linear and possible circular
polarization (L = 44± 3%, V = 23± 30%; Masui et al. 2015)
and FRB 150807 shows extremely high linear polarization
(L = 80± 1%; Ravi et al. 2016). The presence of significant
polarization of any kind on such short timescales is indicative
of coherent emission, much like the polarized pulses seen from
pulsars (Lyne & Graham-Smith 2012). The two bursts from
this sample with the highest levels of linear polarization,
FRBs 110523 and 150807, show significant rotation measures
(RMs); however, the RM of FRB 150807 is consistent with
that of a nearby pulsar indicating that a significant fraction
of the Faraday rotation may be produced in the Galaxy.

The linear polarization data for the burst reported here
were examined for the effects of Faraday rotation using the
implementation of rotation measure synthesis described in

Macquart et al. (2012) (see also Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005).
After accounting for RFI, the ∼ 289 MHz of usable bandwidth
centered on 1357.5 MHz with 0.39 MHz channels yielded a
RM spread function with a half-power at half-maximum
width of 92 rad m−2. A search over the range [−8000, 8000]
rad m−2 detected a 9-σ signal with a RM of +1.6 rad m−2

for which the associated 2-σ confidence interval spans the
range [−9, 12] rad m−2, consistent with zero.

The low measured RM for this FRB is unexpected. Given
that FRB 150215 was seen along a sightline approximately
25◦ from the Galactic Center, one might expect a considerable
RM contribution from the Galactic foreground (> 50 rad
m−2), making a zero total RM unlikely.

3.2 Rotation measure of the Galactic foreground

The RM contribution of the Galaxy can be estimated in a
variety of ways. Here we discuss three possible methods for
determining the foreground Galactic contribution: nearby
polarized extragalactic sources, rotation measure maps, and
rotation measures from nearby pulsars.

The rotation measure foreground from the Galaxy can
be estimated from the measured RMs of nearby sources from
the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Taylor et al., 2009). The
extragalactic sources in the region have largely positive RMs
but the nearest source to the FRB, approximately 0.2 degrees
away on the sky, NVSS J181647-045659, shows a deviation
and has a low RM = −6.3± 15.1 rad m−2 consistent with
zero, as shown in Figure 4.

This is also seen by Oppermann et al. (2015) who present
a smoothed map of the Galactic foreground produced using
a large sample of RMs from extragalactic sources. Based on
these maps the expected RM at the position of FRB 150215 is
−3.3± 12.2 rad m−2, consistent with our measurement from
RM synthesis. However, within the larger map of Galactic
Faraday rotation, the FRB lies in what appears to be a small

size corresponding to magnitude for positive (light blue, +) and
negative (red, open) on a log scale. The RMs are overlaid on the

CHIPASS radio continuum map at 1.4 GHz (Calabretta et al.

2014). FRB 150215 is at the position of the black cross, with the
black circle at the center corresponding to the size of the Parkes

beam. The source nearest to the FRB is NVSS J181647-045659

which has an RM = −6.3± 15.1 rad m−2. The position of pulsar
PSR J1820–0427 (RM = +69.2 rad m−2) is also shown with a
white filled circle.

(< 1 degree) region of low RM surrounded by several much
larger regions of high positive RM.

The third possible method for determining the Galactic
RM foreground is from the rotation measures of Galactic
pulsars along nearby sightlines. The closest pulsar to
FRB 150215 with a measured RM is PSR J1820–0427
of +69.2±2 rad m−2 (Hamilton & Lyne 1987), drastically
different from the RM of the FRB. This pulsar is offset from
the location of FRB 150215 by approximately one degree
and lies within a region of expected positive RM from the
Oppermann et al. (2015) map where the predicted value
integrated through the entire Galactic sightline is RM =
+80(50) rad m−2. It is also worth noting that the pulsar
samples only the local field and cannot measure the RM
along the full sightline through the Galaxy.

The combination of these three methods points to
the conclusion that the position where FRB 150215 was
discovered may lie in a small null region in the Galactic RM.
Rapid foreground variations in RM are known to exist along
sightlines at low Galactic latitude due either to turbulence or
to magnetic field reversals along spiral arms (Han et al. 2006).
The null in RM along this line of sight could also indicate a
void in the Galactic ISM, reducing the Galactic contribution
to the burst’s total DM and increasing the derived distance
even further. Variations in the Galactic ISM on these scales
cannot be seen in current electron density models such as
NE2001 or the YMW model (Cordes & Lazio 2002; Yao et al.
2017).

FRB 150215 is also located near the base of the North
Polar Spur (NPS), a large extended structure in the radio

sky. The NPS is known to contribute significantly to the
Galactic foreground RM (Sun et al. 2015), but has been more
extensively studied at higher Galactic latitudes (b > 20◦)
where measurements are less entangled with other Galactic
contributions. As outlined above, small-scale variations in
the foreground are difficult to constrain, particularly if, as
might be the case for the NPS, the foreground is due to a
supernova remnant or turbulent wind (Sun et al. 2015).

The low RM of FRB 150215 does not preclude the
presence of an intrinsic RM imparted on the burst at the
source. The presence of high fractional linear polarization
suggests an ordered magnetic field at the progenitor. However,
if the progenitor is at high redshift, then the observed RM
from the host is reduced compared to the rest-frame value
by (1 + z)2; for FRB 150215 at an estimated redshift of
z 6 0.56 this could attenuate a significant rest-frame RM
contribution (RM ∼25 rad m−2) from the host so that
it becomes undetectable within our measurement errors.
However a rest-frame RM value of ∼180 rad m−2 like the
one for FRB 110523 would still be present at a detectable
level in the data. Additionally, Oppermann et al. (2015) show
a typical observing-frame extragalactic RM contribution of
∼7 rad m−2 which is consistent with both an attenuated host
RM contribution at high redshift and our measurement for
FRB 150215 if one accepts that there is a low foreground RM.
In summary, given the RM of the FRB, and the foreground,
any host contribution to the RM must be low: . 25 rad m−2

in the rest-frame of the FRB.

4 MULTI-WAVELENGTH FOLLOW-UP

In addition to polarization capture, the real-time detection of
FRB 150215 enabled the triggering of telescopes across the
electromagnetic spectrum to search for longer-lived multi-
wavelength counterparts to the FRB. A detection trigger
was issued through the follow-up network developed as part
of the SUrvey for Pulsars and Extragalactic Radio Bursts
(SUPERB; Keane et al., 2016) two hours post-burst and in
the subsequent weeks the location of the burst was observed
with eleven telescopes. This effort included radio telescopes
searching for repeating bursts, radio imaging campaigns to
search for highly varying radio sources in the field, wide-
field optical imaging in several wavebands, two epochs of
infrared imaging in the field to penetrate the significant
extinction encountered at optical wavelengths, X-ray imaging
with space-based missions, high energy γ-ray imaging, and a
search for associated neutrinos.

The searches and follow-up strategy in these different
wavelength regimes are described in the following sections and
a summary of all observations is provided in Table 2. Detailed
information about the observing setup, sensitivity, and other
specifications for each telescope are given in Appendix A.

4.1 Radio pulse search

Immediately after the detection of FRB 150215 the field was
monitored for two hours with the Parkes telescope until the
field set. These observations place the best limits on repeating
pulses from the source assuming that the progenitor of the
burst was in a phase of outburst or activity as has been seen
for the progenitor of FRB 121102 (Spitler et al. 2016). No

additional pulses were seen in these early observations down
to a S/N of 8, a peak flux density of 0.4 Jy.

In total, the field of FRB 150215 has been re-observed
for 17.25 hours to search for repeating pulses either at the
same DM or for other FRB-like events at a different DM up
to 5000 pc cm−3 with the the Parkes radio telescope (10 hrs)
and the Lovell radio telescope (7.25 hrs). No new bursts were
detected with pulse width 6 32.7 ms at any DM above a
peak flux density of 0.5 Jy, and no new pulses were detected
within 10% of the DM of FRB 150215 above a peak flux
density of 0.4 Jy. A non-detection in follow-up observations
does not preclude a repeating source. Repeating pulses from
the source may be clustered in time, similar to FRB 121102,
and the source may have been active when the location was
not observed or repeat pulses may be too weak to be detected
with the current sensitivity of the Parkes or Lovell telescopes,
as has been suggested by Scholz et al. (2016). The location
of the burst continues to be monitored through on-going
projects at the Parkes telescope.

4.2 Radio imaging

The first radio imaging of the field of FRB 150215 was
done less than five hours after detection through a target of
opportunity (ToO) campaign with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA). Images of the entire Parkes beam
encompassing the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 14.4′

were recorded at 5.5 GHz and 7.5 GHz. Sensitivity in the
field was limited by an elongated beam shape due to the
high declination of the field; the first radio images reached
3-σ limiting fluxes of 280 µJy at 5.5 GHz, and 300 µJy at
7.5 GHz.

Analysis of the first ATCA images in the days after they
were recorded revealed ten radio sources, nine of which were
associated with known sources from the NRAO VLA Sky
Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998). The tenth source (here-
after ATCA 181811−045256), located at RA=18h:18m:11.s4
Dec=−04◦:52′:56.′′6, was the focus of additional initial follow-
up with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) due to its lack
of archival counterpart. The first observations with the VLA
were performed on 2015 March 01, 14 days after FRB 150215,
centered on the position of ATCA 181811−045256. In total
nine epochs of VLA data were taken over the course of 60
days from 2015 March 01 to 2015 April 29 under program
code VLA/15A-461. All observations were taken in the B
configuration of the array in X-band (8.332 – 12.024 GHz)
and a synthesized beam size of 1.03′′ × 0.72′′ at a position
angle of –6.2◦.

An integrated image was produced using all epochs of
VLA observations which yielded an RMS sensitivity of 2.3
µJy at the center position of the observations and 16 µJy near
the edge of the image, shown in Figure 5. In this integrated
image seven sources were detected (labeled with letters A–G
in the VLA analysis) including the primary target ATCA
181811−045256. Three of the sources were detectable in
individual epochs: ATCA 181811−045256 (labeled as VLA-
A), VLA-C, and VLA-F which appears to be an extended
core-jet object. Due to the very limited field of view of
the VLA images, the only ATCA source visible in the field
is ATCA 181811−045256. The three sources visible in all
observations were monitored for intensity variations but were

all seen to remain relatively stable in flux throughout the
observing campaign, as shown in Figure 6.

Additionally, a ToO campaign began with the GMRT
9 hours after the detection of FRB 150215 centered on the
position of the Parkes beam center. Subsequent images were
taken 1.3 and 4.3 days post-burst, all with a center frequency
of 610 MHz and an observing bandwidth of 64 MHz. All
images achieved an RMS sensitivity of ∼ 100 µJy and
encompassed a 1 square degree field of view. In total 61
sources were detected in the GMRT images above the 7-
σ level and 30 of these sources were found to have NVSS
counterparts. All ATCA sources were detected with the
exception of ATCA 181811−045256. The large discrepancy
between the number of GMRT sources and the number of
NVSS sources may be due to the imaging resolution of the
two systems, i.e. a double-lobed source feature identified as
two sources in the GMRT image may be only seen as on in
the NVSS source catalogue. The higher sensitivity and lower
observing frequency of the GMRT relative to the NVSS may
also contribute to this discrepancy.

Longer-term studies of source variability in the field
were conducted using the data from the ATCA. In total, 8
epochs of observations at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz were recorded
with the ATCA with 6 observations between 2015 February
16 and 2015 March 24 and two additional epochs of data
taken one year later in 2016 March. Where possible, the
de-biased modulation index for each source was calculated
using Equation 3 from (Bell et al. 2015) as

md =

where S is the mean flux density, Si is the flux density values
for a source in n epochs and σi is the inverse of the error
in the individual flux measurement. This modulation index
quantifies the strength of variability for a given source with

significant variability defined as md > 50%. Two sources in
the field were unresolved due to differences in observing
configurations between epochs, making analysis of their
variability impossible. An additional two sources were badly
affected by artifacts in most epochs similarly hampering
analysis. For the remaining six sources, including ATCA
181811−045256, md was calculated and none were seen to
vary significantly, i.e. md > 50%. The light curves for these
six sources are shown in Figure 7.

The presence of a radio source in the field not identified
in the NVSS survey is not entirely surprising. The NVSS
survey was designed to be 50% complete at the S =
2.5± 0.4 mJy level at 1.4 GHz (Condon et al. 1998). ATCA
181811−045256 was first detected with a flux of S5.5 = 2.04
mJy and S7.5 = 1.22± 0.4 mJy, implying a slightly negative
spectral index although consistent within the 3-σ errors
with a flat spectrum. Such a source may be below the
sensitivity limit of the NVSS. Although the appearance of a
new radio source in the field post-burst would be tantalizing,
the detection of a variable radio source in the field would
not necessarily imply a direct connection between the source
and the FRB. This has since been shown by the unrelated
highly variable source in the field of FRB 150418 (Williams
& Berger 2016; Johnston et al. 2017) and the detection of
a fairly stable persistent radio source associated with FRB
121102 (Chatterjee et al. 2017; Marcote et al. 2017). However,
if FRB 150215 is seen to repeat in the future and can be
localized via single pulses, the reference images now available
from ATCA, GMRT, and the VLA can quickly confirm or
refute the presence of an associated radio source like the one
seen for FRB 121102.

4.3 Optical and infrared imaging

71 days to search for transient sources on longer timescales.
The first images were taken approximately 12 hours after the
FRB detection at 2015 February 16 09:01:36 UTC with the
Dark Energy Camera (DECam; Diehl & Dark Energy Survey
Collaboration 2012) instrument on the 4-m Blanco telescope
at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Within
two days of FRB 150215 additional observations were taken
with the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope (TNT) located at Doi
Inthanon National Park in Thailand and the 6.5-m Magellan
Baade telescope at las Campanas Observatory in Chile.

The low Galactic latitude of the field resulted in
significant extinction, with an average E(B − V ) = 0.24
(Schlegel et al. 1998), which significantly reduces our limiting
magnitudes in all images. To minimize extinction effects
observations were primarily taken with longer wavelength
filters: r, i, and V R (a custom-made broad filter with high
transmission at 5000 – 7000 Å between the traditional V =
5500 Å and R = 6580 Å bands) on the DECam instrument,
R-band for observations with TNT, and J-band in the near-
infrared using the FourStar instrument on Magellan (Persson
et al. 2013).

Figure 8. DECam VR-band image of the FRB 150215 field. The
blue circles represent the Parkes radio telescope beam (7.5′, inner,
solid line) and extended (15.0′, outer, dashed line) positional error.
The circles are centered on the pointing of the Parkes beam upon
detection of FRB 150215. No transient event was found in the
i-band stacked images within the region.

The most sensitive limit on optical transients comes
from the five epochs of observations taken with the DECam
instrument in the i-band. For an exposure time of 750s and
a seeing FWHM of 1.′′3 the 5-σ limiting magnitudes in each
band were i = 24.3, r = 24.8, and V R = 25.1; however
extinction significantly affects the sensitivity in the field and
the extinction corrected limiting magnitudes were i = 22.2,
r = 21.6, and V R = 21.3, all in the AB system. Due to the
crowdedness of the field and the limited resolution of the dust
maps the variation in extinction is difficult to quantify and
may be as great as several magnitudes in some regions. The
nightly-stacked images were searched for transients using the
SExtractor software and no transient sources were detected.
However, calibration and background estimation in this field
are extremely difficult due to the large number of sources
(see Figure 8) and a verification of the SExtractor results
was performed using an early version of the Mary pipeline
(Andreoni et al., submitted). Many sources were seen to vary
between epochs but no transients were detected in the region
of the Parkes beam above a 5-σ significance threshold.

More limited transient searches were performed using the
two available epochs each from Magellan in J-band and from
TNT in R-band. Magellan observations were taken 1.5 and
2.5 days post-burst achieving 5-σ limiting magnitudes of 18.6
and 19.1, respectively. An analysis similar to that performed
on the DECam observations returned no significant transients.
Observations with the TNT were taken 25 hours and 58 days
post-burst and achieved a limiting magnitude of R = 21.3
(AB), this being the magnitude of the faintest source which
could be reliably extracted. Again, no transient sources were
detected in a SExtractor analysis of the images.

The shortest time baseline on which we are sensitive to
optical transients is approximately 12 days, between the first
two epochs of deep DECam images, and the longest time
baseline is over 70 days. Based on these observations we can
rule out some fairly common optical transients such as a Type
Ia supernova out to z < 0.32 (Wang et al. 2003), or Type
IIp supernovae at z < 0.15 (Sanders et al. 2015). We can
also place limits on optical transients generated by proposed
progenitors to FRBs such as kilonovae (Niino et al. 2014)

and long GRBs associated with superluminous supernovae
(SLSNe; Metzger et al. 2017). Due to their faint emission
we can only place weak limits on a kilonova associated with
FRB 150215 to z < 0.045 or z < 0.11 (for Metzger et al.
2015; Kasen et al. 2013, respectively). However, from the
DM the estimated redshift of FRB 150215 of z < 0.56 we can
place strong limits on temporally associated emission from
a traditional long GRB optical afterglow, which is highly
disfavored.

Given the depth and cadence of the DECam images we
are also able to place strong constraints on a temporally
coincident SLSN. The DECam data are sensitive in depth
and time to an event M ∼ −19.9 at z = 0.56 (the estimated
DM of FRB 150215). Although supernovae have a wide
range of rise and fade times the spacing of the optical epochs
provides detection limits for supernovae at these epochs in
the observed frame. SLSNe evolve slowly with rise and fade
times of ∼30-100 d and ∼100-500 d, respectively. As such,
the DECam observations are well spaced to catch any type
of SLSN near peak luminosity, assuming the SLSN outburst
is associated with the FRB. Thus, the DECam data can
rule out a coincident SLSN to z . 0.75 using the most
conservative definition of a SLSN (M . −20.5; Quimby et al.
2013) and to z . 0.95 using the canonical definition (M .
− 21; Gal-Yam 2012). However, these estimates neglect the
variation in extinction across the field that could obscure
closer events in regions of higher Galactic extinction. We
note that a detection in only one epoch would not confirm
the supernova nature of an event (superluminous or not).
Thus, the practical sensitivity of the DECam data is roughly
0.5-1.0 mags fainter, i.e., i ∼ 21.2− 21.7 and, thus, sensitive
to events brighter than M ∼ −20.4 to −20.9 to z ∼ 0.56
(or M ∼ −19.9 to z ∼ 0.36) in order to observe a sufficient
magnitude change over multiple detections to discern its
evolution and confirm the event.

However, limits on temporally associated optical tran-
sients may be of little use if the engine for the FRB is a
repeating source embedded in a supernova remnant as has
been suggested recently (Metzger et al. 2017; Beloborodov
2017). In this case, the optical transient may have occurred
decades prior to the detection of the FRB and any optical
identification of the progenitor would require localization of
the source from repeating FRBs.

4.4 X-ray observations

Six epochs of X-ray data were taken in the week after FRB
150215: five epochs from the Swift X-ray telescope and one
from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. All observations with
Swift used the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) in photon counting
mode between between 0.3 − 10 keV. All observations were
centered the location of the Parkes beam center at the time
of the FRB detection. The 23.′6 × 23.′6 field of view covered
the field beyond the FWHM of the Parkes beam. The first
observation occurred 19 hours post-burst and subsequent
observations occurred on 2015 February 16 − 21. Integration
times with the XRT for these observations ranged from 800
− 3900 s resulting in a range of sensitivities given in Table 2.
In our analysis of these observations no convincing transient
sources were identified.

A single epoch of X-ray data was also collected with
the Chandra X-ray Observatory using the High Resolution

c© 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000



FRB 150215 9

Camera (HRC, Murray et al. 2000), a 30′ × 30′ imager,
between 0.08 − 10 keV. The observation with the HRC-I
imaging mode was centered on the location of the Parkes
detection beam. Two sources were detected in this image near
the center of the field separated by 34′′. Both sources have
observed fluxes in the 0.3 − 8 keV range of approximately 5
× 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 if they have a soft thermal spectrum
and their positions are consistent with the known nearby M-
dwarfs PM J18174-0452 and PM J18174-0453. No variability
analysis of these M dwarfs is possible with the single epoch
of Chandra data, and these sources were not detected in any
epochs taken with Swift.

It should also be mentioned that the Swift Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) was not looking in the direction of FRB
150215 at the time of the radio detection, therefore no limits
can be place on the occurrence of a coincident γ-ray transient
of the type reported in DeLaunay et al. (2016).

4.5 High energy γ-ray searches

Follow-up observations of the field of FRB 150215 were
performed with the H.E.S.S. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescope array to search for associated high energy γ-ray
photons. The first observations were taken several days after
the FRB when the field became visible at the H.E.S.S. site in
Namibia on 2015 February 22 at 02:53 UTC, 6.3 days post-
burst, and lasted for 28 minutes. In total two observations
were taken of the field, each using a hybrid observing setup
with four 12-m telescopes and one 28-m telescope which
combine to create a 3.5 × 3.5 square degree field of view.
Observations from both epochs were combined to obtain 0.7
h of data under good conditions.

The Li & Ma significances were calculated for the data
(Li & Ma 1983) and the distributions of significances were
compared for the full field and in the case where a circular
region of diameter 14.4′ around the position of the FRB
is excluded. The two distributions were found to be fully
compatible. Therefore, we conclude that no significant γ-ray
flux was detected from the direction of FRB 150215. From
these observations we derive an upper limit on the γ-ray flux
assuming an E−2 energy spectrum as Φγ(E > 1 TeV) <
6.38× 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 (99% confidence).

4.6 Neutrino searches

Searches for a possible neutrino counterpart signal to FRB
150215 were conducted with the ANTARES telescope in
the Mediterranean Sea (Ageron et al. 2011). The discovery
of a high-energy neutrino signal is of a great interest as it
may help to pinpoint the origin, leptons and/or hadrons,
of the accelerated particles emitting the radio burst. The
datastream was searched for up-going track events from a
point-like source in the following three time windows ∆T1
= [T0-500s ; T0+500s], ∆T2 = [T0-1h ; T0+1h], and ∆T3
= [T0-1day ; T0+1day], where T0 is the FRB trigger time.
The searches were performed on a 2◦ region of interest (ROI)
centered on the position of the Parkes beam center at the
time of the FRB detection. The short time window search
was optimized for the case of a short transient associated
with the FRB such as a GRB (see Baret et al. 2011). The
longer timescale searches were done to take into account

unknown scenarios for neutrino production associated with
the FRB. No neutrinos were detected coincident with the
FRB in any of the time bins searched, a result which is
consistent with the neutrino background expectation.

From this non-detection we compute limits on the
neutrino fluence of FRB 150215 based on the instantaneous
acceptance of ANTARES at the time of the FRB: Fν <∫ Emax
Emin

dN/dE · EdE. These upper limits are computed
for two standard neutrino energy spectra defined by a
power law function dN/dE ∝ E−Γ with spectral indices
Γ = 1.0 and 2.0. The limits are computed in the energy range
[Emin-Emax] = [10

3.4-106.4] GeV and [Emin-Emax] = [10
5.4-

107.9] GeV for the soft E−2 and the hard E−1 spectrum,
respectively. Each range has been derived from detailed
Monte Carlo simulations and corresponds to the 5-95% range
of the energy distribution of events passing the applied quality
criteria for the corresponding spectrum. As a result for FRB
150215, F 90C.Lν < 1.4 × 10−2 erg cm−2(. 8.7 GeV cm−2)

5. We consider three distance

scenarios: a local galactic environment with d = 50 kpc, an
extragalactic, non-cosmological distance at d = 100 Mpc and
a cosmological origin at z = 0.56. For a E−2 source model,
the limits are Etotν < 8.2× 1045, 1.6× 1052, 1.4× 1055 erg,
respectively. If the process which produced FRB 150215 also
produces neutrinos ANTARES significantly constrains the
galactic and near extragalactic distance scenarios. However,
the cosmological scenario remains unconstrained according
to the ANTARES sensitivity.

4.7 Follow-up summary

No transients were detected at any wavelength temporally
associated with FRB 150215. Our follow-up places the
strongest limits on long GRB and SLSN-type emission
through optical follow-up with the DECam instrument
described in Section 4.3. Follow-up was challenging due to the
large diameter of the Parkes beam and the poor localization
of the FRB. If the source of FRB 150215 is seen to repeat
in the future the source may be localized through the FRB
single pulses similar to FRB 121102 (Chatterjee et al. 2017).
In such a scenario our observations across the electromagnetic
spectrum provide valuable deep reference images which can
be used immediately to say more about a potential host
galaxy and the existence of a possible radio counterpart to
compare this source with FRB 121102. Radio pulse searches
are ongoing with the Parkes telescope; however, monitoring
of the field of FRB 150215 with FRB search pipelines on new
wide-field interferometers such as UTMOST (Caleb et al.
2016), CHIME (Ng et al. 2017) and Apertif (van Leeuwen
2014) as part of all-sky surveys is highly recommended as
these instruments will provide improved localization.

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Detectability of FRBs at low Galactic
latitudes

In addition to adding a new burst to the current population,
FRB 150215 also presents some interesting new information
on the detectability of FRBs, particularly at low Galactic
latitudes. Previous searches at low and intermediate Galactic
latitudes have been unsuccessful at finding FRBs (Burke-
Spolaor & Bannister 2014; Petroff et al. 2014; Rane et al.
2016). No viable physical mechanism has yet been presented
that explains how the Galaxy could effectively mask or hinder
FRB detection in this region given that current searches are
sensitive to FRBs out to extremely high DMs and even if
a large amount of scattering is present (Bhandari et al., in
prep.). FRB 150215 may have traveled through a small RM
null in the Galactic foreground, potentially also representing
a line of sight where the total Galactic electron column
density is lower than its surroundings.

The P786 project spent a total of 518 hours surveying the
regions of RRATs and candidates with the BPSR observing
system. Over 460 of these hours were spent at Galactic
latitudes below 20◦. From this survey and the single FRB
detection an approximate FRB rate can be calculated as
RFRB = 3.4

+13
−3 × 10

3 FRBs sky−1 day−1 (95% confidence
level, 0.13 < F < 5.9 Jy ms), consistent within large
uncertainties with previous estimates from Champion et al.
(2016) and Rane et al. (2016).

5.2 Galactic or extragalactic origin?

A preponderance of proposed progenitors place the origin of
FRBs outside our own Galaxy. Many posit cosmological dis-
tances. No precise location was determined for FRB 150215;
however, the observational evidence from the burst itself
is consistent with an origin outside the Milky Way. The
burst shows no obvious pulse broadening due to the effects
of scattering despite the large overall DM and despite having
traveled through the potentially significant scattering screen
of the Galaxy, see Figure 2. The NE2001 model predicts
pulse broadening by the Galaxy along this line of sight at
1.4 GHz of 0.01 ms; however, using the scattering-DM relation
from Bhat et al. (2004) the expected pulse broadening is ≈5
ms at 1.4 GHz. The NE2001 value may be highly biased or
inaccurate in this region due to the sparsity of pulsars but the
true value likely lies somewhere between these two models.
The lack of significant scattering may be consistent with
the expected Galactic effects, but in the case of a sightline
with strong scattering (where the Bhat et al. model is more
applicable) FRB 150215 is out of place.

The lack of scattering for FRB 150215 is consistent
with the larger population of FRBs which show scattering
seemingly randomly without any correlation with total DM
(Cordes et al. 2016). Such a distribution could be explained
if the burst originates far outside the Galaxy such that the
effect of the Galactic material is down-weighted compared to
a scattering screen halfway between source and observer (the
‘lever arm effect’; Lorimer et al. 2013) and the scattering seen
in some profiles is instead due to traveling through halos of
intervening galaxies.

If the source of FRB 150215 was a Galactic pulsar this

FRB 150215 11

would require an extreme overdensity in the Galactic electron
content along the line of sight, perhaps attributable to a dense
Hii region. Such a scenario has been proposed for FRB 010621
(Bannister & Madsen 2014) although the overdensity fraction
was much smaller. In the case of FRB 150215, a Hii region
capable of producing the fractional DM excess would require
an enormous density, producing a substantial emission
measure (EM ∼ 1010 pc cm−6), and a measurable fourth
order effect on the DM. Such a high emission measure would
be bright in Hα, but no such emission is seen in the images
of the region from the WHAM survey (Haffner et al. 2003).
A region of this density would also be inconsistent with the
observed RM properties of the burst unless there was an
implausibly low magnetic field strength within the region to
cancel out the effects of such enormous density.

We find no compelling physical evidence of a Galactic
origin for FRB 150215 and therefore propose an extragalactic
origin as being the favorable explanation for the excess DM
and other observed properties of the burst. The consistency
between the FRB RM and the estimated foreground RM
also indicates that the FRB is most likely located outside of
the Milky Way.

5.3 Comparison with FRB 150418 and
FRB 131104

The follow-up of FRB 150215 revealed no transient or variable
source in the field at any wavelength. Of particular interest
are the observations conducted with the ATCA following
FRB 150215 as they were very similar in cadence to those
conducted for FRB 150418 in which it was argued that a
rapidly fading radio source was observed in the days after
the burst (Keane et al. 2016; Johnston et al. 2017). The
observations with the ATCA for FRB 150215 were, however,
significantly less sensitive due to the high declination angle
of the source field. The result was an elongated beam shape
and a higher noise floor for these observations. The best
RMS noise achieved in any ATCA observation during this
follow-up campaign was 120 µJy at 5.5 GHz, 160 µJy at
7.5 GHz, as such a source like WISE J071634.59190039.2
(the source which had been proposed to be related to FRB
150418) which varies below the 100 µJy level could not be
detected.

Radio imaging follow-up was also conducted for
FRB 131104 with the ATCA (Shannon & Ravi 2017). A
strongly variable radio source in the field, AT J0642.9–5118,
was observed to brighten coincident with the burst, reaching
a peak brightness of 1.2 mJy at 7.5 GHz in the week
following the the FRB. Shannon & Ravi have identified the
source as a radio-bright AGN at a redshift of z = 0.8875,
consistent with the redshift for the FRB inferred from its
redshift. While AT J0642.9–5118 reached a peak brightness
an order of magnitude higher than the AGN in the field of
FRB 150418 it too would have been below the detection
threshold for the follow-up conducted for FRB 150215 with
the ATCA.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we present the new fast radio burst FRB 150215
discovered in real-time with the Parkes radio telescope in

February 2015. Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger follow-
up was triggered at 11 telescopes. Full Stokes information was
preserved for this burst and the FRB was found to be 43±5%
linearly polarized with a rotation measure −9 < RM <
12 rad m−2 (95% confidence level). We find this rotation
measure to be consistent with the Galactic foreground as
the burst sightline may coincide with a spatially compact
null in the Galactic RM, perhaps also corresponding to a
lower than average electron column density contribution
to the total dispersion measure. This also implies that no
rotation measure &25 rad m−2 in the rest-frame of the
host is imparted by the progenitor or a host galaxy, in
contrast to FRB 110523 (Masui et al. 2015) implying that
not all FRBs are produced in dense, magnetised regions. The
burst was found within 25◦ of the Galactic Center at low
Galactic latitude (b = 5.28◦) with a dispersion measure DM
= 1105.6±0.8 pc cm−3, more than 2.5 times the expected DM
from the NE2001 model. This excess in the DM may be higher
if the RM null value also corresponds to an underdensity in
the ionized interstellar medium along this sightline.

Follow-up observations were conducted with telescopes
at radio, optical, and X-ray wavelengths, as well as at TeV
energies with the H.E.S.S. γ-ray telescope and with the
ANTARES neutrino detector. Several steady sources were
detected in the field of FRB 150215, but no transient or
variable emission was observed coincident with the burst
and it is unclear which, if any, of the steady sources may be
related to the FRB. No repeating pulses from FRB 150215
were found at DMs up to 5000 pc cm−3 in 17.25 hours of
radio follow-up, although monitoring of the FRB field is
ongoing. The burst properties favour an extragalactic origin
although the distance to the progenitor cannot be determined
with available observations.

A MULTI-WAVELENGTH FOLLOW-UP: OBSERVING DETAILS

A.1 The Lovell Telescope

Observations to search for single pulses from FRB 150215 were taken with the Lovell telescope at a center frequency of 1532
MHz with 800 frequency channels over 400 MHz of bandwidth of which approximately 20% is masked due to RFI. The sampling
time of the data was 256 µs and the diameter of the Lovell beam is 12′. In this configuration the 1-σ sensitivity limit for a
pulse width of 1 ms is 35 mJy.

The data were initially cleaned by applying a channel mask to remove bad frequency channels, next a median absolute
deviation (MAD) algorithm was applied to remove additional channels affected by RFI. The data were then dedispersed
using SIGPROC dedisperse all around the DM of the FRB, from 1050 – 1150 pc cm−3, after which we used SIGPROC
seek with the single pulse option to detect single pulses at each DM trial. No significant candidates were found above a
threshold of 10-σ. As a verification, the data were also searched for single pulses using PRESTO. We dedispersed the cleaned
data using prepsubband (with the zero DM option) for the same DM range used in the SIGPROC search and the same
DM step size calculated by dedisperse all (∼4 pc cm−3). We then searched the resulting time series for single pulses
using single pulse search.py (using the nobadblocks flag to stop the code from removing strong bursts). Again, we found no
significant candidates above 10-σ.

A.2 The Australia Telescope Compact Array

To cover the full field of view of the Parkes beam with the ATCA required 42 pointings in a mosaic mode at 5.5 GHz and
7.5 GHz. The data were reduced using the standard steps in miriad (Sault et al. 1995). At every observing epoch the 42
pointings were imaged and individually self-calibrated before being combined using linmos to form a mosaic. The miriad
source finding task imsad was used to find sources above a threshold of 6-σ at both center frequencies and the task imfit was
used to fit Gaussian components for flux estimation. The details of the ATCA observations are given in Table 3.

Of the ten sources detected in the images at 5.5 GHz, two (NVSS J181647–045659 and NVSS J181647–045213) were
unresolved in all 8 epochs because of different resolutions for different configurations, and two (NVSS J181733-050830 and
NVSS J181822-045439) are badly effected by artifacts, especially in Epochs 4, 5 and 6. These four source have been excluded
from the variability analysis presented in Section 4.2 and Figure 7. Further details of the variability analysis for the remaining
six sources are given in Table 4.

A.3 Jansky Very Large Array

The observations with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) were made in standard imaging mode, centered on the position of
a single ATCA detection at RA 18h:18m:11.s51, Dec –04◦:52′:46.′′84 (J2000). The standard VLA calibrator 3C286 was used for
flux and bandpass calibration for all observations and J1812–0648 was used for phase calibration. All epochs were observed
with 2 MHz channels across the full frequency range (8.332 – 12.024 GHz), and 2 s sampling intervals. At each epoch, we spent

an average net time of ∼20 minutes on-source. We performed standard VLA calibration and imaging procedures for each epoch.
Concatenating the data over all epochs produced the image in Figure 5 in the main text. The synthesized beam for this image
subtends 1.′′03× 0.′′72 at a position angle of –6.2◦, and provides a RMS sensitivity of 2.3µJy at the observation center, and
16µJy near the edge of the VLA primary beam. The fluxes and positions of each source in the integrated image are detailed in
Table 5.

A.4 The Dark Energy Camera

For the follow-up observations of FRB 150215 the full DECam imager was used which covers 3 square degrees allowing for
coverage of more than 4.5 times the uncertainty radius of the Parkes telescope beam, shown in the main text in Figure 8.
Details about the observing dates, filters, and exposure times for the DECam observations are given in Table 6.

A.5 Thai National Telescope

FRB 150215 was followed up with the ARC 4K camera mounted on the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope (TNT), located at Doi
Inthanon National Park, Thailand. The field-of-view is 8.8′ × 8.8′, and six tilings were used to observe the field at each epoch.
In total 40 minutes was spent observing the field in the first epoch on 2015 February 16 and each tile was observed several
times in the R-band, with individual exposure times of 60 seconds. The same six tiles were observed again 57 days later on
2015 April 14, enabling a comparative analysis of sources. The effective overlapping area observed on both occasions was 18.′4
in RA by 12.′4 in Dec centered on 18h:17m:40s –04◦:51′:55′′.

The images were de-biassed and flat-fielded, aligned and stacked for each tile, calibrated astrometrically using
astrometry.net (Lang et al. 2010), and finally source catalogues were extracted using SExtractor Catalogues (Bertin
& Arnouts 1996). All point-like sources detected for each epoch were compared to search for variability and for transient
objects which appear in the first observations but not in the second. Unfortunately the observing conditions for the first epoch
were poor, with seeing of 3′′, and in both epochs the fields were observed at high airmass (>1.5). The faintest reliable sources
we could extract were R = 21.3 (AB), and we consider this the detection limit.

& Ma (1983). Right plot: Distribution of significances (black histogram) compared to the distribution obtained by excluding a circular

distribution.

A.6 The Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT)

Observations were taken with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) and the data (target ID: 00033640) and XRT products were
built and analyzed using the data analysis tools on the Swift website (Evans et al. 2007, 2009). Using standard settings, these
tools identified no convincing transient sources and we obtained a count rate upper limit for each observation epoch at the
position of the FRB. These count rate limits were converted to flux limits using a Galactic HI column density estimate from
HEAsoft tool nH at the position of FRB 150215 of 3.04 × 1021 cm−2, with a negligible intrinsic component, and assuming
that the FRB has the spectral index of a gamma-ray burst-like event. The average GRB spectral index over the energy range
of the XRT for all GRBs in the catalogue on the Swift website (Evans et al. 2009) was found to be 2.0 ± 0.4; we use a value of
2.0 in our analysis as the spectrum of the FRB afterglow is not known but may be GRB-like. The 0.3 – 10 keV fluxes were
then calculated using the HEAsoft tool WebPIMMS4 for each observation and are provided in Table 2.

A.7 H.E.S.S.

The H.E.S.S. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope array is situated on the Khomas Highland plateau of Namibia
(23◦16′18′′ South, 16◦30′00′′ East), at an elevation of 1800 m above sea level. The current telescope array, completed in 2012, is
comprised of four 12-m telescopes and one 28-m telescope sensitive to cosmic rays and γ-rays in the 10 GeV to 100 TeV energy
range. With its current sensitivity the telescope array is capable of detecting a Crab-like source close to zenith at the 5-σ level
within < 5 minutes under good observational conditions (Aharonian et al. 2006). The observatory has a field-of-view of 3.◦5.

Both observations of the field of FRB 150215 performed with the H.E.S.S. telescope were performed with a hybrid setup
including all five telescopes in the array. Combining both observations and after correcting for acceptance effects, a total
effective live time of 0.7 h was obtained under good conditions but with relatively high zenith angles ranging between 54◦ and
64◦. The data were analyzed using the Model Analysis (de Naurois & Rolland 2009) with standard gamma-hadron separation
and event selection cuts. The background has been determined using the standard “ring background” technique (Berge et al.
2007) in combination with an acceptance estimation exploiting the radial uniformity of the acceptance across the field-of-view
of the system.

No significant γ-ray flux has been detected from the direction of FRB 150215. The distribution of γ-ray events exceeding
the background is shown for the full region of interest (ROI) in the left plot of Fig. 9. The middle plot of Fig. 9 shows the map
of the Li & Ma significances (Li & Ma 1983) and the right plot shows the corresponding distribution of significances (black
histogram). The distribution obtained by excluding a circular region of diameter 14.′4 around the FRB position is shown in red.
They are fully compatible with the background expectation.

A.8 The ANTARES neutrino telescope

The ANTARES neutrino telescope is currently the most sensitive neutrino telescope operating in the Northern hemisphere. It
aims to primarily detect up-going neutrino-induced muons (above 100 GeV) that produce Cherenkov light in the detector. By
design, ANTARES mainly observes the Southern sky (2π steradian at any time) with a high duty cycle. As a consequence,
ANTARES is perfectly suited to search for a neutrino signal from FRB candidates detected at the Parkes observatory.

The number of atmospheric background events, µb, was directly estimated from the data using a time window ∆Tback

FRB 150215 17

= [T0-12h ; T0+12h], where T0 is the time of FRB 150215. The detector stability has been checked by looking at the
event rates detected in time slices of 2 hours within ∆Tback. We did not find any significant variability in the event rates
which guarantees the stability of the detector. Within the three time windows, no neutrino event was found in correlation
with FRB 150215. The expected numbers of background events, integrated over the three time windows in a ROI of 2◦, are
µB = 3.5× 10−5, 2.5× 10−4 and 6.1× 10−3, respectively. Thus, the Poisson probability of observing zero events knowing the
different background noises is greater than 99%. From these considerations, the null result is compatible with the neutrino
background expectation.
