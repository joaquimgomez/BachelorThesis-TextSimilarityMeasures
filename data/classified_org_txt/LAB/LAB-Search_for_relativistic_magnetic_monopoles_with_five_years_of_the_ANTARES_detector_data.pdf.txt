Abstract

A search for magnetic monopoles using five years of data recorded
with the ANTARES neutrino telescope from January 2008 to Decem-
ber 2012 with a total live time of 1121 days is presented. The analysis
is carried out in the range β > 0.6 of magnetic monopole velocities us-
ing a strategy based on run-by-run Monte Carlo simulations. No signal
above the background expectation from atmospheric muons and atmo-
spheric neutrinos is observed, and upper limits are set on the magnetic
monopole flux ranging from 5.7×10−16 to 1.5×10−18 cm−2· s−1· sr−1.

Keywords : Magnetic monopole, Neutrino telescope, ANTARES

1 Introduction

The concept of a particle with a magnetic charge (the magnetic monopole,
MM in the following) was introduced by P. A. M. Dirac in 1931 [1] to
explain the quantization of the elementary electric charge, e. The Dirac
basic relation between e and the magnetic charge g is

eg

c
=
n~

−→ g = k · gD = k ·
e

2α
, (1)

where gD is the unit Dirac charge, k is an integer and α ' 1/137 is the fine
structure constant. The existence of magnetic charges and currents would
symmetrize the Maxwell’s equations. However, the symmetry would not be
perfect, as gD is numerically much larger than e. In 1974, G. ’t Hooft [2] and
A. M. Polyakov [3] showed that the electric charge is naturally quantized
in Grand Unification Theories (GUTs). MMs appear at the phase transi-
tion corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of the unified group into
subgroups, one of which is U(1), describing electromagnetism.

While there is no indication of the mass of the Dirac’s magnetic monopole,
in the context of GUTs the MM mass M is related to the mass of the
X-boson carrier of the unified interaction (mX ∼ 1015 GeV/c2), yielding
M & mX/α ' 1017 GeV/c2. MMs with masses M ∼ 105 ÷ 1012 GeV/c2

(called intermediate-mass MMs) are predicted by theories with an interme-
diate energy scale between the GUT and the electroweak scales and would
appear in the early Universe at a considerably later time than the GUT
epoch [4]. More recently, it has been proposed [5] that solutions yielding
MMs could arise within the electroweak theory itself. This Cho-Maison, or
electroweak MM, would be expected to have a mass of the order of several
TeV.

Guided mainly by Dirac’s argument and their predicted existence from
spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanisms, searches have been routinely
made for MMs produced at accelerators, in cosmic rays, and bound in matter
[6, 7]. Eq. (1) defines most of the MM properties, as they are assumed as
point-like particles, of magnetic charge equal g, with unknown mass and
with unknown relic cosmic abundance. To date, there are no confirmed
observations of exotic particles possessing magnetic charge.

MMs at the electroweak scale with M < 10 TeV are very good candi-
dates for searches at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The ATLAS
collaboration [8] searched for MMs as highly ionizing particles produced in
proton-proton collisions, leading to new cross section upper limits for spin
1/2 and spin 0 particles. MoEDAL is a dedicated experiment searching for
MMs produced in high-energy collisions at the LHC using stacks of nuclear-
track detectors and a trapping detector. Recently, limits on MM production
cross sections have been reported both for the 8 TeV and 13 TeV LHC
runs [9, 10].

GUT MMs are very massive and composite objects, well beyond the
reach of any existing or foreseen accelerator. They could have been produced
in a phase transition in the early Universe [11], and appeared as topological
defects, about one pole for each causal domain. This would lead to a present-
day overabundance [12]: the reduction of the number of MMs in the Universe
was one of the motivating factors for cosmological inflation in Guth’s original
work [13].

As the Universe expanded and cooled down, the energy of MMs de-
creased: they would have reached a speed β = v/c ∼ 10−10 during the
epoch of galaxy formation (v is the MM speed and c is the speed of light
in vacuum). After the gravitationally-driven galaxy formation epoch, galac-
tic magnetic fields developed through the dynamo mechanism. Then, MMs
were re-accelerated by these magnetic fields, yielding an isotropic intergalac-
tic flux of relatively high-energy MMs. A magnetic field B acting over a
length ` increases the MM kinetic energy by a quantity gB`. The final
speed depends on galactic magnetic field strength, on the coherent length
` and on MM mass and magnetic charge. For the typical values in our

4



Galaxy, i.e. B ∼ 3 10−6 G and ` ∼ 300 pc = 1021 cm, MMs of g = gD are
relativistic up to M ∼ 1011 GeV/c2. Then, their velocity decreases to reach
the value β ' 10−3 for M & 1017 GeV/c2. In models in which the cosmic
magnetic field, instead of being uniformly distributed, is strongly correlated
with the large scale structure of the universe, MMs are relativistic up to
∼ 2× 1013 GeV/c2 for g = gD [14].

The above MM acceleration process drains energy from the galactic mag-
netic field. An upper bound on the flux of MMs in the galaxy (called the
Parker bound [15]) has been obtained by requiring the rate of this energy
loss to be small compared to the time scale on which the galactic field can
be regenerated. With reasonable choices for the astrophysical parameters
[6], the Parker bound corresponds to

Search strategies are determined by the expected interactions of MMs
as they pass through matter. These would give rise to a number of peculiar
signatures. A complete description of the techniques used for the search of
these particles is in [7], and a complete list of the results in [6].

Several searches were carried out also using neutrino telescopes. The
ANTARES neutrino telescope [16] was completed in 2008 and the collected
data can be used to search for MMs with energies high enough to yield light
emission. The results of the analysis published in [17] using a data set of
116 days live time, lead to upper limits on the flux in the range between
1.3 × 10−17 and 5.7 × 10−16 cm−2· s−1· sr−1 for MMs with β > 0.6. The
IceCube collaboration has set upper limits on the flux for relativistic MMs
ranging from 1.55× 10−18 to 10.39× 10−18 cm−2· s−1· sr−1 [18].

In this paper, a new analysis is presented, based on an enlarged ANTARES
data set of 1121 days collected from 2008 to 2012, increasing by a factor of
∼10 the live time of the previous published result. This analysis is based
on a new selection of cuts, yielding a better separation of the MM signal
from the background of atmospheric muons and neutrinos. Further, it relies
on a new simulation strategy that reproduces each data run individually,
allowing for an accurate reproduction of the data taking conditions.

The paper is organized as follows: a brief description of the ANTARES
telescope and the MM expected signatures are given in sections 2 and 3,
respectively. The simulation and reconstruction algorithms are described in
sections 4 and 5. The MM-sensitive observables, the selection strategy and
the upper limit calculation are discussed in sections 6 and 7. Finally, the

5



results are presented and discussed in section 8.

2 The ANTARES telescope

The ANTARES detector [16] is an undersea neutrino telescope anchored
2475 m below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea and 40 km offshore from
Toulon (France). It consists of 12 detection lines with 25 storeys per line and
3 optical modules (OMs) with 10-inch photomultipliers (PMTs) per storey.
The detection lines are 450 m long and spaced 60−75 m apart horizontally.
The main channel for neutrino detection is via the muons produced from
high-energy muon neutrinos interacting inside, or in the vicinity of the de-
tector. These muons move at relativistic velocities and induce the emission
of Cherenkov light along their paths, detected by the optical modules. PMT
signals corresponding to a charge above a threshold of 0.3 photo-electrons
are integrated with a time window of 40 ns, digitised and denoted as hits.
The readout of OMs is performed in the storey’s Local Control Module,
which collects the data in packages of 104 ms. These packages are sent to an
on-shore farm of computers for further data processing and filtering. Each
detector storey has one local clock that is synchronized to the on-shore mas-
ter clock [19]. Furthermore, at the computer farm a system of triggers is
applied on the data (see section 5), selecting signatures which may corre-
spond to the passage of relativistic particles.

3 Detection of magnetic monopoles

The signature of a MM in a neutrino telescope like ANTARES is similar
to that of a highly energetic muon. Thus, as in the case of electrically-
charged particles, magnetically-charged particles induce the polarization of
the dielectric medium. Coherent light emission (Cherenkov effect) is in-
duced by the restoring medium if the particle travels with a speed above
the Cherenkov threshold βth = 1/n, where n is the refractive index of the
medium [20]. In water the threshold is βth ≈ 0.74. The number of pho-
tons emitted from a MM with magnetic charge g in a small interval of path
length, dx, and in the range dλ of wavelength, for β ≥ βth can be expressed
as

where nγ is the number of photons emitted and λ is their wavelength; the
remaining quantities are already defined in Eq. (1). For a given velocity,

6



the Cherenkov radiation yield by a MM is a factor
(

larger than that

from a particle with electric charge Ze. Thus, for the refractive index of sea
water, fast MMs with g = gD are expected to emit about 8550 times more
Cherenkov photons than relativistic muons.

In addition to the direct Cherenkov radiation, MMs can knock off atomic
electrons (δ-ray electrons) that can have velocities above the Cherenkov
threshold, contributing to the total light yield. The production of δ-electrons
is described by the differential cross-section of Kasama, Yang and Goldhaber
(KYG) [21] or by the more conservative (in terms of photon yield) Mott cross
section [22]. The contributions to the light yield from these mechanisms are
shown in Fig. 1. In both cases, some commonly accepted assumptions for
the quantum-mechanical aspects of the interaction between a MM and an
electron are used that must be implemented in the simulations. In this work,
the Mott cross section is used, starting for the minimum velocity of β =
0.5945: this allows a simpler application in the Monte Carlo simulation of
the spectrum of the produced δ-ray electrons, yielding a safer estimate of the
light yield. Contributions from radio-luminescence of water, pair production,
Bremsstrahlung and photo-nuclear reactions induced by relativistic MMs are
negligible compared to the direct and indirect Cherenkov light presented in
Fig. 1, and are not taken into account in this analysis.

In neutrino telescopes, the background of atmospheric muons dominates
the solid angle region corresponding to down-going events. In particular,
muons in bundle can easily be misidentified with the passage of a relativistic
highly ionizing particle. On the opposite, the solid angle region correspond-
ing to up-going events is almost background free, apart from the events in-
duced by atmospheric neutrinos and the surviving down-going atmospheric
muons misreconstructed as up-going. Due to the energy spectrum of at-
mospheric muon neutrinos, they usually induce minimum ionizing muons
that can be easily distinguished from fast MMs. In order to suppress the
irreducible background of atmospheric muons, only up-going MMs were con-
sidered.

The request of up-going MMs reduces the range of masses M that
can be observed in a neutrino telescope. The stopping-power defined by
S. P. Ahlen [23] has been used to estimate the absorption and energy loss of a
MM when crossing the Earth. This work has established for MMs the equiv-
alent of the Bethe-Bloch formula that describes the energy loss in the passage
of a heavy electric charge by ionization and excitation in a non-conductive
medium. Thus, the stopping-power of a MM crossing the Earth could be
estimated using the simplified density profile established by Derkaoui et
al. [24]. Despite the high energy loss, MMs would remain relativistic and
detectable as up-going events if M & 1010 GeV/c2 (see for instance Fig. 3
of [7]). As discussed in Section 1, the MM speed depends on the character-
istic of the galactic magnetic fields and on the mass M . Within reasonable
astrophysical considerations, only MMs with a mass M . 1014 GeV/c2 can
be expected in neutrino telescopes as an up-going event with a speed ex-
ceeding the Cherenkov threshold. Thus, the limits presented in this paper
hold for MM in the mass range 1010 GeV/c2 .M . 1014 GeV/c2.

4 Monte Carlo simulation

In this section, the simulation of the MM signal and the atmospheric (neu-
trino and muon) background events are discussed.

4.1 Magnetic monopole simulation

Up-going MMs with one unit of Dirac charge, g = gD, have been simulated
using nine equal width ranges of velocity in the region β = [0.5945, 0.9950].
The nine intervals of the velocity are defined in the first column of Table 1.

MMs have been simulated using a Monte Carlo program based on GEANT3 [25].
The simulation is independent of the MM mass and the incoming direction of

8



MMs was distributed isotropically over the lower hemisphere. The propaga-
tion and detection of emitted photons is processed inside a virtual cylindrical
surface surrounding the instrumented volume around the detector. A radius
of 480 m is chosen to take into account the large amount of light emitted by
MMs.

4.2 Background simulation

The main source of background comes from up-going muons induced by
atmospheric neutrinos and down-going atmospheric muons wrongly recon-
structed as up-going tracks. The simulation of atmospheric muons is carried
out using the generator MUPAGE [26] based on the parametrisation of the
angle and energy distributions of muons under-water as a function of the
muon bundle multiplicity [27]. MUPAGE produces muon events on the
surface of the virtual cylinder.

Up-going atmospheric neutrinos from the decay of pions and kaons are
simulated using the package GENHEN [28, 29] assuming the model from the
Bartol group [30, 31] which does not include the decay of charmed particles.
The analysis presented in this paper is based on a run-by-run Monte Carlo
simulation [32], which takes into consideration the real data taking condi-
tions of the detector (e.g. sea water conditions, bioluminescence variability,
detector status).

5 Trigger and reconstruction

The applied triggers are based on local coincidences defined as the occurrence
of either two hits on two separate optical modules of a single storey within
20 ns, or one single hit of large amplitude, typically more than 3 photo-
electrons. The trigger used for this analysis is defined as a combination of
two local coincidences in adjacent or next-to-adjacent storeys within 100 ns
or 200 ns, respectively. In this analysis, only events passing such a trigger,
well suited for MMs, are considered.

The event reconstruction has been done with a slightly modified version
of the algorithm described in [33]. By default, it assumes that particles
travel at the speed of light. In order to improve the sensitivity for MMs
travelling with lower velocities, the algorithm was modified such as to leave
the reconstructed velocity of the particle βfit as a free parameter to be
derived by the track fit.

The algorithm performs two independent fits: a track fit and a bright-
point fit. The former reconstructs particles crossing the detector, while the

9



latter reconstructs showering events, as those induced by νe charged current
interactions. Both fits minimize the same χ2 quality function, thus, two
parameters defining the quality of these reconstructions are introduced, tχ2

for the track fit, and bχ2 for the bright-point fit.
Some basic quality cuts have been applied to the data to ensure good

data taking conditions [34]. To avoid any experimental bias, the search
strategy is based on a blind analysis. The selection cuts applied on the
analysis are established on Monte Carlo simulations and using a test data
sample of about 10% of the total data set, equivalent to 109 days out of the
total 1121 days of live time. These runs are not used later for setting the
limits.

In the following comparisons between the test data sample and simula-
tion, the full collection of Monte Carlo runs is used, and the 10% of test
data is scaled to the total live time. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the re-
constructed velocity βfit for MM events, atmospheric muons and neutrinos
and compared to the test data sample. The neutrino distribution repre-
sents electron neutrinos and muon neutrinos for both neutral and charged
currents.

trino and atmospheric muon fluxes are discussed in section 8. Accordingly,
the event distributions of these two channels shown in this paper suffer from
an overall normalization uncertainty of about 30% and 35%, respectively.

Additional cuts on the track fit quality parameter are implemented to
remove misreconstructed atmospheric muon tracks. In particular, the re-
quirement tχ2 ≤ bχ2 is applied to favour events reconstructed as a track
rather than those reconstructed as a bright point. The further event selec-
tions were optimized for different MM velocities. A different event selection
was performed for each of the nine bins of β reported in the first column of
Table 1.

The modified reconstruction algorithm which treats βfit as a free pa-
rameter was used only in the regions of low velocities between β = 0.5945

11



and β = 0.8170 (five bins). Thus, MMs with these velocities could be
distinguished from particles traveling with the speed of light (βfit = 1).
For each of the five low beta bins, only events reconstructed with βfit in
the range of simulated β were used in the final selection. For example,
at the range β = [0.5945, 0.6390], only events with reconstructed velocity
βfit = [0.5945, 0.6390] were selected. In the high velocity interval ranging
from β = 0.8170 to β = 0.9950 (four bins), the βfit is not a discriminant
variable anymore. However, MMs emit a large amount of light compared to
that emitted from other particles, which allows them to be distinguished.

In the used reconstruction algorithm, the hits from the optical modules
belonging to the same storey are summed together to form a track hit. The
coordinates of its position are coincident with the center of the storey, the
time is equal to the time of the first hit and the charge equal to the sum of
the hits charges. For all velocity bins, the number of storeys with selected
track hits Nhit, is used as a powerful discriminant variable since it refers to
the amount of light emitted in the event (see Fig. 4).

velocities, Nhit provides a good discrimination for MM signals after applying
the cuts zenith ≤ 90◦ and tχ2 ≤ bχ2.

A second discriminative variable is introduced to further reduce the
background, in particular for the velocities below the threshold for direct
Cherenkov radiation where the light emission is lower. This variable, named
α, is defined from a combination of the track fit quality parameter tχ2 and
Nhit following [33]:

α =
tχ2

1.3 + (0.04× (Nhit −Ndf ))
2
, (4)

where Ndf is the number of free parameters in the reconstruction algorithm.
It is equal to 6 when βfit is included in the reconstruction, and 5 when
the velocity is not reconstructed. Example of α distribution is shown at
Fig. 5. This parameter has the advantage of including the track fit quality
parameter balanced with the brightness of the events, avoiding that bright
events get cut by the condition applied on the tχ2 variable.

7 Optimization of cuts

The following step to suppress the atmospheric background is to use specific
cuts on the Nhit and α parameters in order to maximize the signal-to-noise
ratio. In Fig. 6, the event distribution of α as a function of Nhit is shown for
one range of MM velocity. This distribution indicates that a good separation
of MM signal from background is achievable. The horizontal and vertical
lines show the effect of the cuts. The signal region corresponds to the left
upper quadrant.

Figure 6: Two-dimensional distribution of α and Nhit, for atmospheric
muons, atmospheric neutrinos, and MMs simulated in the velocity range
[0.7280, 0.7725]. The cuts zenith ≤ 90◦ and tχ2 ≤ bχ2 have been applied, as
well as the cut βfit = [0.7280, 0.7725]. The vertical and horizontal lines show
the cuts applied after optimization. No neutrinos survived at this range of
β.

The 90% confidence level interval µ90(nb, nobs), where nb is the number
of background events is the 90% confidence interval defined by the Feldman-
Cousins approach [35]. It depends on the number of observed events nobs
which is not known at this point because of the blind approach. Instead,
the average confidence interval µ̄90(nb) is calculated, from which the sensi-
tivity of the analysis can be derived, by assuming a Poissonian probability

14



distribution for the number of observed events nobs. The selection cuts are
optimized by minimizing the so-called Model Rejection Factor (MRF) [36]:

MRF =
µ̄90(nb)

nMM
, (5)

where nMM is the number of signal events remaining after the cuts, assuming
an isotropic MM flux with φ0MM = 1.7 · 10

−13 cm−2· s−1· sr−1. In addition
to the specific values of the cuts, nMM depends on the detector acceptance
Seff (cm

2 · sr) and on the time period over which data was collected T (s).
In order to compensate for the lack of statistics in the remaining sample

of atmospheric muon background, an extrapolation has been performed in
the region of interest for the signal. An example of extrapolation performed
is shown in Fig. 7. After fitting the Nhit distribution for muons with a Lan-
dau type function (red), the latter is extrapolated to the region of interest
(pink), then the number of muons remaining after the final cut on Nhit is
given by the sum of the events from the muon histogram (blue) and the
extrapolation (pink). Columns 3 and 4 of Table 1 shows the background

8 Results and discussion

The unblinding was performed on the total set of data collected by the
ANTARES telescope during five years, which corresponds to 1012 active
days live time after subtracting the 10% burn sample. No significant excess
of data events is observed over the expected background, and the upper
limits on flux have been found using Eq. (6). Table 1 summarizes, for each
of the nine bins of β, the selection cuts, the number of expected background
and observed events, and the 90% C.L. upper limits on the MM flux.

The computation of the 90% C.L upper limits through Eq. (6) includes
the statistical uncertainties on the expected atmospheric muon events in col-
umn 3 of Table 1. These uncertainties are dominant over the uncertainties
related to the detector response. The effects on the muon and neutrino rates
due to the detector uncertainties are widely discussed elsewhere, particularly
in [34, 37, 38, 39]. For the atmospheric neutrinos, the systematic uncertain-
ties as a function of the energy are detailed in [38]. As shown in Table 1, the
contribution of atmospheric neutrinos is almost negligible with respect to
atmospheric muons and the effects of these uncertainties have been ignored.
Concerning atmospheric muons, the dominant detector effects are connected
to the angular acceptance of the optical module [40] and to the absorption
and scattering lengths in water [41]. The maximum ±15% uncertainty on
the optical module acceptance and the ±10% on the light absorption length
in water over the whole wavelength spectrum yields an overall +35%−30% effect
on the expected muon rate [37]. However, as already stated, in this case the
dominant effect (in most cases, with effects larger than ±50% on the num-
ber of events) is due to the lack in the statistics of the surviving muons and
to the procedure for the background extrapolation, as described in Fig. 7.
The values reported in column 3 represent the overall uncertainties on the
surviving muon background in each β bin.

The effect of a third uncertainty, due to the use of the Mott cross-section
instead of the KYG (as discussed in Section 3) has not been considered. In
this case, a more conservative choice in terms of photon yield has been made.
The outcome is to neglect a possible larger photon yield, that has the effect

16



of decreasing the detection thresholds towards smaller values of β in Fig. 1.

Table 1: Results after unblinding of the data (1012 active days live time
corresponding to 5 years of data taking). The selection cuts, the number of
expected (muons and neutrinos) background and observed events and the
upper limits on the flux are presented for each range of velocity (β). The
table was divided into two parts to distinguish the first five bins where βfit
was assumed as a free parameter from the four bins where βfit = 1.

In the first five bins, the reconstructed velocity βfit was restricted to
be compatible with the range of the MM velocity. Therefore, the event
samples in these ranges are exclusive and must be added. As shown in
Table 1, the sum of background events in the first five ranges adds up to 5.4
events whereas only one event has been observed. This indicates a rather
conservative method of extrapolating the atmospheric muon sample into the
region defined by the final cuts. For the last four bins, βfit = 1 and cuts on
α and Nhit are tightened from bin to bin, that means bin 7 is a subset of
bin 6 and so on. Thus, the total background is given here by bin 6 already.

In Fig. 8 the ANTARES upper limits as a function of β are presented,
together with other experimental results from IceCube [18], MACRO [42]
and Baikal [43], as well as the previous result from ANTARES [17] and the
theoretical Parker bound [15]. The MACRO experiment was sensitive also

17



to down-going candidates, surviving the ∼3000 meters of water equivalent
of the Gran Sasso mountain overburden. Thus, their limit holds for MMs
of lower mass (starting from 106 GeV/c2). For MMs that have to cross
the Earth, as in the case of the present paper, the limit is valid for M >
1010 GeV/c2. After applying the final cuts to the unblinded data, two

and zenith = 27.4◦ which passes the cuts optimized of two bins of β. It is
identified as a bright well-reconstructed neutrino event regarding its physical
properties, compatible with the total background observed at this range of
high velocities. The second event with β ≥ 0.728 is consistent with a down-
going (zenith = 108.1◦) atmospheric muon yielding a bright shower.

9 Conclusion

A search for relativistic MMs with the ANTARES neutrino telescope has
been performed, using data collected during five years (from 2008 to 2012)
and corresponding to a total live time of 1012 days. No signal has been
observed above the atmospheric background expectation and new upper
limits on the MM flux have been set.

Above the threshold for direct Cherenkov radiation β ≥ 0.74, the limits
found are better than those of other neutrino experiments. Below Cherenkov
threshold, direct comparison is not straightforward due to the model of cross
section used.

Neutrino telescopes are well suited for the search for MMs. The future
detector KM3NeT [44] will improve the sensitivity to the detection of MMs
due to its large volume and high detection performance.
