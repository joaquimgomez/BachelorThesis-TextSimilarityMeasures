Abstract

The data taken with the ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to 2010, a total live time of 863 days, are used to
measure the oscillation parameters of atmospheric neutrinos. Muon tracks are reconstructed with energies as low as
20 GeV. Neutrino oscillations will cause a suppression of vertical upgoing muon neutrinos of such energies crossing
the Earth. The parameters determining the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos are extracted by fitting the event rate as
a function of the ratio of the estimated neutrino energy and reconstructed flight path through the Earth. Measurement
contours of the oscillation parameters in a two-flavour approximation are derived. Assuming maximal mixing, a mass
difference of ∆m232 = (3.1 ± 0.9) · 10

−3 eV2 is obtained, in good agreement with the world average value.

Keywords: neutrino oscillations, neutrino telescope, ANTARES

1. Introduction

A measurement of the quantum mechanical phenomenon of neutrino oscillations provides important information
on the mass differences of the neutrino mass eigenstates and their mixing angles. The effect was discovered by
Super-Kamiokande [1] on neutrinos produced in the Earth atmosphere. In this paper, the first observation of neutrino
oscillations by a high energy neutrino telescope is presented. As this measurement addresses a higher neutrino energy
range, the analysis presented here is complementary to previous measurements. In particular, the selection procedure
for νµ events, on which the oscillation parameters are measured, is different with respect to a similar analysis at lower
energies. Whereas the separation of νµ charged current events from νe and neutral current events becomes much easier,
handling the background from misreconstructed downgoing muons is more challenging (see Section 6).

The main goal of the ANTARES deep sea neutrino telescope [2] is the observation of high energy neutrinos
from non-terrestrial sources. The telescope is optimised for the detection of Cherenkov light induced by the passage
of upgoing muons produced in charged current interactions of neutrinos at TeV energies, for which the muon can
traverse completely the equipped detector volume. At lower neutrino energies, both the cross section and the muon
range are smaller resulting in a decrease of the detection efficiency. For the analysis presented here, the lowest energies
of detectable muons from neutrino interactions are about 20 GeV. For upgoing atmospheric neutrinos which traverse
the Earth, this threshold is low enough for the observed flux of νµ induced events to be significantly suppressed by
neutrino oscillations. By studying the observed upgoing muon rate as a function of the ratio of the reconstructed muon
energy and zenith angle, constraints on the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters are derived.

The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 the phenomenology of atmospheric neutrino oscillations is intro-
duced and the method used to extract the oscillation parameters is discussed. The ANTARES telescope is described
in Section 3. The data set and the Monte Carlo simulations are explained in Section 4. The methods to reconstruct
the neutrino direction and energy are discussed in Section 5 followed by details of the event selection in Section 6. A
discussion on systematic uncertainties is given in Section 7 and the final results are presented in Section 8.

where L is the travel path (in km) of the neutrino through the Earth and Eν, its energy (in GeV). Uαi is the 3×3 PMNS-

The present analysis is restricted to L < 12800 km and Eν > 20 GeV, for which the term sin

not exceed 3.7 · 10−3 when using ∆m221 from [3]. This term can safely be ignored as well as differences between ∆m

Results could in principle be extracted in terms of |Uµ3|
2 and ∆m232 which are the two oscillation parameters in Equa-

tion 2. To maintain compatibility with earlier results, a mixing angle sin2 θ23 = |Uµ3|
2 is defined, ignoring the 2.4%

deviation from 1 of cos2 θ13 = 0.976 [4]. This leads to the usual two-flavour description

For upgoing tracks L is in good approximation related to the zenith angle Θ by L = D · cosΘ where D is the Earth
diameter. The transition probability, P, depends now on only two oscillation parameters, ∆m232 and sin

2 2θ23, which
determine the behaviour for the atmospheric neutrino oscillations.

With ∆m232 = 2.43 · 10
−3 eV2 and sin2 2θ23 = 1 from [3] one expects the first oscillation maximum, i.e. P(νµ →

νµ) = 0 for vertical upgoing neutrinos (cosΘ = 1) of Eν =24 GeV. Muons induced by 24 GeV neutrinos can travel up
to 120 m in sea water.

The observed number of events in bin i, Ni, of a given variable can be compared to the number MCi of expected
Monte Carlo events in the same channel

where µi is the number of the background atmospheric muon events in channel i and the sum gives the number of
atmospheric neutrino events in channel i weighted by the event dependent oscillation probability from Equation 3. As
the oscillation probability P(νµ → νµ) depends on Eν/ cosΘ, the natural choice for a variable in which the channel
i can be defined is the ratio between a quantity which depends on the neutrino energy and the reconstructed zenith
angle, ΘR. As explained in Section 5, the energy-dependent variable is the observed muon range in the detector. The
oscillation parameters are extracted by a χ2 minimisation which is detailed in Section 7.

3. The ANTARES Detector

A detailed description of the ANTARES detector can be found in [2]. The detector consists of 12 lines, equipped
with photosensors, and a junction box which distributes the power and clock synchronization signals to the lines and
collects the data. The junction box is connected to the shore by a 42 km electro-optical cable. The length of the
detection lines is 450 m, of which the lowest 100 m are not instrumented. Their horizontal separation is about 65 m
and they are arranged to form a regular octagon on the sea floor. They are connected to the junction box with the help
of a submarine using wet-mateable connectors. Each line comprises 25 storeys each separated by a vertical distance
of 14.5 m. The lines are kept taut by a buoy at the top of the line and an anchor on the seabed. The movement of the

3



line elements due to the sea currents is continuously measured by an acoustic calibration system with an accuracy of
10 cm [5].

Each storey contains three 45◦ downward-looking 10” photomultiplier tubes (PMT) inside pressure resistant glass
spheres - the optical modules [6]. Some of the storeys contain supplementary calibration equipment such as acoustic
hydrophones or optical beacons [7].

The signals of each photomultiplier are readout by two ASICs. The charges and arrival times of the PMT signals
are digitised and stored for transfer to the shore station [8]. The time stamps are synchronised by a clock signal
which is sent at regular intervals from the shore to all electronic cards. The overall time calibration is better than
0.5 ns [9]. Therefore the time resolution of the signal pulses is limited by the transit time spread of the photomultipliers
(σ ∼1.3 ns) [10] and by chromatic dispersion for distant light sources. All data are sent to the shore station. With the
observed optical background rate of 70 kHz per PMT at the single photon level this produces a data flow of several
Gbit/s to the shore. In the shore station a PC farm performs a data filtering to reduce the data rate by at least a factor
of 100 [11]. Several trigger algorithms are applied depending on the requested physics channel and on the observed
optical noise.

4. Data and Simulations

The present analysis is based on data taken with the ANTARES detector between March 2007 and December
2010. Until December 2007 ANTARES operated in a 5-line configuration, followed by several months of operation
with 10 installed detector lines. The detector construction was completed in May 2008. All physics runs taken under
normal conditions have been used. The events selected by two tight trigger conditions are used [2]. The analysed
sample consists of 293 million triggers, dominated by atmospheric muons, corresponding to a detector live time of
863 days.

Downgoing atmospheric muons were simulated with the program MUPAGE [12, 13] which provides parametrised
muon bundles at the detector. Upgoing neutrinos were simulated according to the parametrisation of the atmospheric
νµ flux from [14] in the energy range from 10 GeV to 10 PeV. The Cherenkov light, produced inside or in the vicinity of
the detector instrumented volume, was propagated taking into account light absorption and scattering in sea water [15].
The angular acceptance, quantum efficiency and other characteristics of the PMTs were taken from [6] and the overall
geometry corresponded to the layout of the ANTARES detector [2]. The optical noise was simulated from counting
rates observed in the data. At the same time, the definition of active and inactive channels has been applied from
data runs as well. The generated statistics corresponds to an equivalent observation time of 100 years for atmospheric
neutrinos and ten months for atmospheric muons.

5. Reconstruction

The algorithm used for the muon track reconstruction is described in [16]. It assumes a simplified detector geom-
etry composed of straight vertical detection lines. The method combines a strict selection of direct Cherenkov photon
hits which are grouped around “hot spots” at each detector line with a χ2-like fitting procedure. A hot spot corresponds
to a signal of at least 4 photoelectrons seen on two adjacent storeys of the same detector line within a narrow time
window of less than 100 ns. Only hits on detector lines with such a hot spot are used in the track fitting. If the selected
hits occur only on one detector line, a single-line fit is performed. No azimuth angle is determined in this case due to
the rotational symmetry of the problem. This does not affect the present measurement, as the oscillation probability
does not depend on the azimuth angle (see Equation 3). If selected hits occur instead on several detector lines, a
multi-line fit is performed which provides both the zenith and azimuth angles of the track. The inclusion of single-line
events is a special feature of the reconstruction method and allows to significantly lower the energy threshold of the
final atmospheric neutrino sample. Whereas for multi-line events the threshold energy of the final neutrino sample is
about 50 GeV due to the 65 m horizontal gap between lines, single-line events are reconstructed down to 20 GeV for
nearly vertical tracks, accessing events with Eν/L values close to the first oscillation maximum.

The neutrino energy is estimated from the observed muon range in the detector. The selected hits are sorted
according to their vertical position, z. The z-coordinates of the uppermost and lowermost hits, zmax and zmin, together

4



with the reconstructed zenith angle, ΘR, allow to define an approximate muon range

S = (zmax − zmin)/ cosΘR. (5)

When considering the geometry of the Cherenkov light cone, Equation 5 is exact only for strictly vertical tracks. It has
been verified that the use of a more sophisticated range definition does not improve the precision of the measurement
for the oscillation parameters. S is used to estimate the muon energy by taking into account the ionisation energy loss
of 0.2 GeV/m for minimum ionising muons in sea water [3]

ER = S · 0.2 GeV/m. (6)

The derived energy from the visible muon range in the detector can be considered as a lower limit of the actual
neutrino energy. The presence of a hadronic shower at the neutrino vertex is ignored, as well as the fact that the muon
might leave or enter the detector, making only a fraction of its actual range available for measurement. The normalised
difference between the true neutrino energy, Eν, and ER is shown in Figure 1 for all selected simulated events (see
Section 6) with Eν < 100 GeV. The mean value of 0.45 illustrates the fact that ER measures on average about half of
the neutrino energy. The RMS of the distribution is 0.22.

6. Event Selection

Downgoing atmospheric muons dominate the ANTARES event sample on the trigger level as illustrated in Table 1.
Neutrinos contribute less than 10−4 here. In principle a simple cut in the reconstructed zenith angle should be enough
to separate both classes. But as seen from Table 1, this is not sufficient. Atmospheric muons are often seen as bundles
and they can be accompanied by hard stochastic processes such as bremsstrahlung. Both effects complicate their
correct reconstruction and a certain fraction of downgoing atmospheric muon events are misreconstructed as upgoing.
Some cuts on the quality of the reconstructed tracks are needed to reduce this contamination and derive reliably
neutrino oscillation parameters from the data set. The goodness of the track fit is measured by the “normalised fit
quality” as introduced in [16], a quantity equivalent to a χ2 per number of degrees of freedom (NDF). The selection
cuts, which are described below, have been obtained from a blind analysis. The single-line data sample has been kept
blind, thereby masking a possible oscillation signature.

For the multi-line selection, only events which have hits on more than 5 storeys are kept to allow a non-degenerate
track fit. Further, the fit must not converge on a physical boundary of any of the fit parameters. As the contamination
of misreconstructed atmospheric muons is particularly strong close to the horizon, a further condition, cosΘR > 0.15,
is imposed, i.e. tracks closer than 9◦ to the horizon are excluded.

Figure 2: Normalised fit quality of the final multi-line (left) and single-line (right) samples. Data with statistical errors (black) are compared to
simulations from atmospheric neutrinos with oscillations assuming parameters from [3] (red) and without oscillations (green) and atmospheric
muons (blue). For a fit quality larger than 1.6 (multi-line) or 1.3 (single-line) the misreconstructed atmospheric muons dominate. The arrows
indicate the chosen regions.

The distribution of the normalised track fit quality of the resulting multi-line event sample for data and simulations
is shown in Figure 2 (left). The neutrino Monte Carlo samples are scaled down by an overall normalisation factor
r = 0.86 as obtained from the fit (see Section 8). This is well within the uncertainty of the atmospheric neutrino
flux model [17]. Figure 2 (left) shows that a cut on the normalised fit quality allows to cleanly separate the upgoing
neutrinos from the downgoing muons. In order to have a contamination of misreconstructed atmospheric muons below
5%, a cut value of 1.3 is chosen.

For the single-line selection, events which have hits on more than 7 storeys are kept. This yields a minimal track
length for a vertical upgoing muon of about 100 m, which can be produced by a muon of 20 GeV. Further cuts are
identical to the multi-line selection.

The distribution of the normalised track fit quality of the resulting single-line event sample for data and simulations
is shown in Figure 2 (right). The neutrino Monte Carlo samples are again scaled down by a factor r = 0.86. Figure 2
(right) shows that also for this data set a cut on the normalised fit quality allows to cleanly separate the downgoing
muons from the upgoing neutrinos. In order to have a contamination of misreconstructed atmospheric muons below
5%, a cut value of 0.95 is chosen.

Table 1: Event reduction due to the cuts used. Statistical errors are given for the final data set. The effect of oscillations with parameters from [3]
is taken into account only for the values given in the very last row.

The effect of the different selection cuts in the two channels is detailed in Table 1 for data and the Monte Carlo
sets. Satisfactory agreement between data and Monte Carlo numbers is observed at all cut levels.

Events from νe charged current (CC) interactions as well as neutral current (NC) interactions produce cascade-like
event topologies. The spatial extension of these cascades, which are composed of the hadronic and electromagnetic

6



showers at the neutrino interaction vertex, does not exceed more than a few meters. This is in contrast to the lowest
energetic selected muons, which have still a range of at least 100 m in sea water and therefore a distinct topology.
The above described selection cuts, tuned to suppress the atmospheric muon background, reduce efficiently also the
contribution from νµ NC and νe interactions. Their contribution to the final event sample is estimated to be less than
one event in the multi-line channel and 6 events in the single-line channel. Both numbers are significantly smaller

The zenith angle of the final neutrino sample is reconstructed with a precision of 0.8◦ for multi-line events and

Figure 3: Distribution of Eν/ cosΘ for the selected events of the atmospheric neutrino simulation. The solid lines are without neutrino oscillations,
the dashed lines include oscillations assuming the best fit values reported in [3]. The red histograms indicate the contribution of the single-line
sample, in blue the multi-line events.

distribution in Eν/ cosΘ for the simulated selected atmospheric neutrino samples is shown in Figure 3. The expected
event numbers are shown for the actual detector live time of 863 days. The effect of neutrino oscillations is seen by
comparing the Monte Carlo curves with and without oscillations. The importance of the inclusion of the single-line
events is evident. The expected deficit due to neutrino oscillations for Eν/ cosΘ < 200 GeV amounts to 143 events,
the majority of which (91 events) are in the single-line sample. These oscillated events are mainly converted into
ντ and might produce muons by a ντ CC interaction followed by a decay τ

− → µ−ν̄µντ (or charge conjugate). To
estimate the appearance of muons from ντ interactions in the final event sample, the energy dependent cross section
ratio σ(ντCC)/σ(νµCC), about 0.5 for Eν = 25 GeV, the 17% branching ratio of the muonic τ-decay and the soft
energy spectrum of the resulting muons have to be considered. It is found that the expected deficit due to oscillations
is reduced by less than 5 events.

7. Systematic Uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties lead to a correlated distortion of the ER/ cosΘR distribution. They are implemented as
pull factors in the χ2 function to be minimised:

R. (7)

The sum extends over the bins in ER/ cosΘR with Ni the observed number of events in bin i whereas MC
1L
i and

MCMLi denote the expected event numbers from simulations in the single-line and multi-line channel respectively and
σi is the corresponding statistical error of bin i. The simulated event numbers depend on the oscillation parameters
according to Equation 4. The quantities ǫ and η are two pull factors which allow to renormalise the two channels. The
variations of ǫ and η are constrained by σR, which is introduced below.

7



A large class of uncertainties modify the overall normalisation, i.e. they act on ǫ and η in the same way. The
normalisation of the neutrino flux model as well as the uncertainty on the absolute neutrino detection efficiency of the
ANTARES detector fall into this class. Equation 7 does not constrain such uncertainties, as indicated by the absence
of terms such as ǫ2/σ2ǫ or η

2/σ2η, i.e. the relative overall normalisation between data and simulations is left totally free
in this analysis.

A second class of uncertainties might change the shape of the ER/ cosΘR distribution. Single-line events have
typically lower Eν/ cosΘ values (and thus correspondingly lower observed ER/ cosΘR values) than multi-line events
(see Figure 3). A change in the ratio of the total number of events in each sample, R0 = N

1L/NML, would therefore
reflect a shape change of the ER/ cosΘR distribution. In terms of the pull factors this can be written as R(ǫ, η) =
R0(1 + ǫ)/(1 + η) ≈ R0(1 + ǫ − η). Therefore R(ǫ, η) varies with ǫ − η if both pull factors are small.

Several simulations have been performed with modified input parameters which may affect in a slightly different
manner vertical and horizontal events (thereby acting on cosΘR) as well as low and high energy events [18]. The
average quantum efficiency of the phototubes was changed by ±10% as well as their angular acceptance. The water
absorption length of sea water was also varied by ±10%. Further, the cuts in the normalised fit quality were varied in
two steps of 0.05 around the chosen values thereby testing the stability of the analysis procedure. The spectral index
of the atmospheric neutrino flux was varied by ±0.03 as suggested in [19]. As a result a set of values of R was derived.
It was observed that R remains stable within 5% of its original value, R0. This value σR = 0.05 is used in Equation 7
to constrain relative variations of ǫ and η. This accounts for the maximal variation of the shape of the ER/ cosΘR
distribution due to the considered systematic effects.

8. Results

After applying the cuts defined in Section 6 the final event numbers obtained are given in Table 1. Figure 4 (left)
shows the resulting ER/ cosΘR distribution for data and simulations. Figure 4 (right) shows the fraction of measured
and simulated events with respect to the non-oscillation Monte Carlo hypothesis and indicates a clear event deficit for
ER/ cosΘR < 60 GeV, as expected assuming atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Restricting the χ

Figure 4: Left: Distribution of ER/ cosΘR for selected events. Black crosses are data with statistical uncertainties, whereas the blue histogram
shows simulations of atmospheric neutrinos without neutrino oscillations (scaled down by a factor 0.86) plus the residual background from atmo-
spheric muons. The red histogram shows the result of the fit. Right: The fraction of events with respect to the non-oscillation hypothesis. Same

parameters in the physically allowed region yields the red curve of Figure 4 with ∆m232 = 3.1 ·10
−3eV2 and sin2 2θ23 =

1.00. The corresponding pull factors are ǫ = −0.138 and η = −0.142. This is used as an overall normalisation
parameter r = 0.86 in Figures 2 and 4. The fit is performed in 25 bins: the 24 bins shown in Figure 4 plus one overflow
bin which contains 299 events with ER/ cosΘR > 140 GeV. The fit yields χ

2/NDF = 17.1/21. When imposing the
world average oscillation parameters, ∆m232 = 2.43 · 10

−3 eV2 and sin2 2θ23 = 1 from [3], χ
2/NDF = 18.4/21 is

found.

For the non-oscillation hypothesis, i.e. sin2 2θ23 = 0, χ
2/NDF = 31.1/23 is obtained. The pull factors in this case

are ǫ = −0.302 and η = −0.196. The event deficit in the single-line channel is seen here as ǫ becoming lower than η.
Requiring in addition ǫ = η the χ2 increases further to χ2/NDF = 40.0/24, which has a probability of only 2.1%.

Figure 5: 68% and 90% C.L. contours (solid and dashed red lines) of the neutrino oscillation parameters as derived from the fit of the ER/ cosΘR
distribution. The best fit point is indicated by the triangle. The solid filled regions show results at 68% C.L. from K2K [20] (green), MINOS [21]
(blue) and Super-Kamiokande [22] (magenta) for comparison.

C.L. sin2 2θ23 > 0.70 is found and ∆m
2
32 is constrained to values in the range [2.2, 4.2] · 10

−3eV2. If maximal mixing
is imposed (sin2 2θ23 = 1), the obtained range of ∆m

2
32 is

∆m232 = (3.1 ± 0.9) · 10
−3eV2. (8)

The results are in agreement with other measurements from K2K [20], MINOS [21] and Super-Kamiokande [22].

9. Conclusions

Based on data taken by the ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to 2010, constraints on the neutrino os-
cillation parameters sin2 2θ23 and ∆m

2
32 have been derived. If maximal mixing is assumed, a value ∆m

2
32 = (3.1 ±

0.9) · 10−3eV2 is obtained. The result agrees well with current world data and demonstrates a good understanding of
the performance of the ANTARES telescope at its lowest accessible energies. It is the first such measurement by a
high energy neutrino telescope and underlines the potential of future low energy extensions of the existing neutrino
telescopes for such physics.
