Abstract: Studying atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the few-GeV range with a multi-
megaton detector promises to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy. This is the main sci-
ence goal pursued by the future KM3NeT/ORCA water Cherenkov detector in the Mediter-
ranean Sea. In this paper, the processes that limit the obtainable resolution in both energy
and direction in charged-current neutrino events in the ORCA detector are investigated.
These processes include the composition of the hadronic fragmentation products, the sub-
sequent particle propagation and the photon-sampling fraction of the detector. GEANT
simulations of neutrino interactions in seawater produced by GENIE are used to study
the effects in the 1–20GeV range. It is found that fluctuations in the hadronic cascade in
conjunction with the variation of the inelasticity y are most detrimental to the resolutions.
The effect of limited photon sampling in the detector is of significantly less importance.
These results will therefore also be applicable to similar detectors/media, such as those in
ice.

1 Introduction

It has recently been suggested that the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined with
multi-megaton neutrino detectors in water and ice by measuring the flux of atmospheric
neutrinos that have passed through the Earth [1]. Due to the influence of matter on neu-
trino oscillation during propagation through the Earth, the expected interaction rate of
neutrinos in the energy regime of ∼ 1–20GeV differs between the normal and inverted
hierarchies. This is the main science goal pursued by KM3NeT/ORCA, the densely in-
strumented component of KM3NeT 2.0 being built off the southern coast of France [2]. In
its current design, ORCA will consist of a 3D array of 2070 optical modules, each hous-
ing 31 3-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), with about 20m horizontal and 9m vertical
spacing between optical modules, instrumenting in total a volume of about 5.5× 106m3 of
seawater. The PINGU infill array of the IceCube detector at the South Pole has also been
proposed to perform this measurement [3]. Additionally, such detectors are expected to
further constrain neutrino-oscillation parameters, and have been proposed to study sterile
neutrinos, non-standard interactions, dark matter, supernovae, and the internal structure
of the Earth.

In order to resolve the mass hierarchy, detectors must determine the neutrino energy
and arrival direction1 — the latter defining the neutrino path through the Earth — and
identify the type of interaction, as electron-neutrino charged current (CC), muon-neutrino
CC, or neutral current (NC).2 With ORCA, this will be done by studying the Cherenkov
light signature using an array of PMTs. A first estimate of the accuracy of reconstruction
methods targeting the primary outgoing lepton (e or µ) in CC interactions is given in the
Letter of Intent for KM3NeT 2.0 [2].

Improving reconstruction methods will require using the hadronic component of CC
interactions, in particular since it has been suggested to resolve the inelasticity y of the in-
teraction to further add to the mass hierarchy sensitivity [4]. However, the instrumentation
density of the ORCA detector will likely be insufficient to identify the Cherenkov cone of
each individual particle (as with Super-Kamiokande [5]), or measure the paths of particles
as a tracking detector. Effects causing fluctuations in the Cherenkov light signature will
therefore limit the achievable reconstruction accuracy.

In this paper, the limits imposed by these intrinsic physical fluctuations on the energy
and direction resolution of hadronic cascades are derived (as per section 2) by analysing
the output of simulations for seawater in section 3. Limits on resolutions of muon tracks
and electromagnetic cascades are much smaller and hence less significant, and are derived
in appendices B and C. Combining these fluctuations produces limiting resolutions for
the neutrino in ↪ ↩ν e and ↪ ↩νµ CC interactions, as presented in section 4.3 The effects of
these limits on the reconstruction of the inelasticity in ORCA are investigated in section 5.
Section 6 compares the derived limits to the reconstruction performance of ORCA using a
full detector simulation, discusses their applicability to reconstruction in ice-based detectors
(i.e. PINGU), and their implications for published estimates of experimental sensitivity

1Although only the neutrino zenith angle is relevant for the neutrino mass hierarchy measurement, the
space angle for direction resolutions is always considered in this paper.

2At these energies, the much-rarer ↪ ↩ν τ interactions will resemble one of these classes.
3Since the mean inelasticity of ν and ν interactions differ, throughout this paper the notation ↪ ↩ν refers

to “both ν and ν”, while ν and ν refers exclusively to neutrinos and antineutrinos, respectively.

to the neutrino mass hierarchy. The outcomes of this investigation are summarised in
section 7.

2 Methods

2.1 Definitions

With the exception of scattering on atomic electrons, all neutrino interactions in the GeV
range produce hadronic cascades, although the ‘cascade’ may only consist of a few particles
emerging from the neutrino interaction. There are several possible definitions of the energy
and momentum of such a hadronic cascade, ph = (Eh, ~ph), which may or may not include
the target momentum, any sub-relativistic nuclear remnant, and may also weight outgoing
particles by their expected Cherenkov light yield. The convention chosen here is to define
ph as the momentum transfer q, i.e. through four-momentum conservation applied to the
neutrino interaction vertex in the laboratory frame, as shown in figure 1. Thus,

ph ≡ q = pν − p`, (2.1)

where pν is the original neutrino four-momentum, and p` the four-momentum of the outgo-
ing lepton. Similarly, the inelasticity y (nominally, Bjorken y) of the interaction is defined
as

y ≡
Eh
Eν

=
Eν − E`
Eν

. (2.2)

These definitions are chosen because they are most relevant for reconstructing the neutrino
interaction properties. By not including the (unobservable) target four-momentum, vari-
ations in this contribution between interactions with the same ph will be included in the
fluctuations due to different hadronic final states.

In ORCA and like detectors, events are reconstructed by measuring the number of
emitted photons, their arrival times and their spatial distribution. Unlike detectors using
a dense array of PMTs on a 2D plane, such as Super-Kamiokande [5], the sparser 3D
layout of ORCA makes it difficult to distinguish Cherenkov cones from individual particles.
Therefore, it is assumed that signatures from the outgoing e, µ in ↪ ↩ν e,µ CC interactions can

– 3 –



be distinguished from the accompanying hadronic cascade as demonstrated in ref. [2], but
that individual particles within the hadronic cascade cannot be identified.

Moreover, while the elongation of the cascade is important for a dense detector con-
figuration, effects due to this elongation are not studied here, and only fluctuations in the
emission direction and number of photons are considered. Furthermore, it is assumed that
only unscattered photons retain directional information. Therefore, the total number of
detected photons can be used to estimate the cascade energy Eh, while the emitted di-
rections of photons that are detected before being scattered can be used to estimate the
cascade direction, ~uh (= ~ph/ |~ph|).

Fluctuations in reconstructed energy and direction are considered according to the
following scheme:

• Hadronic-state fluctuations. Hadronic final states with identical ph can differ in the
number and type of particles, and in their energies and directions. This will result
in different photon signatures, and hence fluctuations in reconstructed quantities.

• Propagation fluctuations. The stochastic nature of energetic particle propagation
implies that even identical initial particles will produce different photon signatures.

• All-photon limit. Even in the case that every emitted photon is detected, the above
two effects will combine to give the all-photon limit to reconstruction accuracy.

• Photon-sampling fluctuations. Sampling only a fraction of the emitted photons will
further limit the ability of reconstruction methods to determine event properties.

• Overall limit. The combination of hadronic-state, propagation, and photon-sampling
effects results in the overall limit to reconstruction accuracy.

Values of the relative energy reconstruction error, ∆E/E, and the direction recon-
struction error, ∆θ, will be derived for each of these cases.

The total and unscattered sampled photon fractions are characterised only by the
wavelength-dependent probability of detecting each photon, given in figure 2 for the ORCA
benchmark detector studied in ref. [2]. Note that this detector has a 6m vertical spacing
between optical modules, while a 9m spacing was found to be optimal for the neutrino
mass hierarchy determination.

As all sources of fluctuations are independent, the all-photon and overall limits are
calculated by adding their component contributions in quadrature.

2.2 Simulations

The simulation methods used in this paper to calculate limiting resolutions differ signifi-
cantly from reconstruction methods based on full detector simulations. As the goal is to
derive limiting resolutions in a robust manner, the following simplifications are used when
compared to full simulations of ORCA [2]. In all cases, these are intended to be optimistic,
to ensure that the resulting limits are indeed limiting.

• PMT response ignored. The precise number and arrival times of photons are assumed
to be measured. This ignores the specifics of PMT response and readout, timing-
and charge-calibration uncertainties, and imperfections in reconstruction methods.

tionally not scattered (blue), calculated from in-situ measurements of the inherent optical properties
of deep-sea water [6], and the optical module effective area and density for the KM3NeT/ORCA
benchmark detector design [2]. The peak near 440 nm arises from the absorption minimum.

• Generalised detector geometry. Detected photons are randomly sampled according to
wavelength-dependent probabilities only. This ignores the specifics of the detection
geometry, such as partially contained events, and that PMTs are located in ‘clumps’
(i.e. optical modules) at specific positions. This simplified geometry is equivalent to
a detector composed of an infinite number of infinitely small detection elements, and
thus ignores the non-uniform and correlated photon-detection induced by ‘clumpi-
ness’.

• Known photon origin. Photons from the hadronic cascades and the outgoing lepton
in a CC interactions are assumed to be distinguishable, and background photons
from atmospheric muons and natural light sources are ignored.

• No simulation uncertainties. It is assumed that neutrino interactions, particle prop-
agation, and Cherenkov light production can be modelled perfectly, and reconstruc-
tions are based on perfect simulations.

Initial hadronic states are taken from simulations of neutrinos interacting in seawater
using gSeaGen [7], which implements GENIE 2.8.4 [8]. Samples of 1000 such states for
each of several discrete energies between 1GeV and 20GeV were selected in a sufficiently
unbiased manner (see appendix A.3 and table 1 for further details). Variations about the
mean properties of each sample characterise the hadronic-state fluctuations.

Each state was simulated 1000 times with an implementation of GEANT 3.21 [9] in the
standard ANTARES simulation package [10]. Cherenkov emission was generated over the

– 5 –



300–710 nm range via the Frank-Tamm formula [11] using the wavelength-dependent phase
velocity in seawater [12].

Variations between simulations of the same cascade are used to characterise fluctu-
ations due to propagation. Implementations of both GHEISHA (‘G-GHEISHA’) [13] and
FLUKA (‘G-FLUKA’) [14, 15] were used for hadron tracking, with differences (discussed in
appendix A.2) serving as a measure of systematic uncertainties. In most cases, this dif-
ference was found to be small. Neutrino resolutions presented in section 4 use G-GHEISHA
results.

For each simulation of each hadronic final state, the properties of all emitted photons,
and a sample randomly selected according to the detection probabilities of figure 2, are
recorded, and used to estimate corresponding reconstruction errors as described below.
Distributions of parameters related to reconstructed energy are approximately Gaussian,
and fluctuations are characterised by their root-mean-square (RMS). Those related to
direction reconstruction tend to have large tails due to individually significant scattering
events, and are characterised using 68.27% quantiles in space angle.

In case of neutrino resolutions, the Monte Carlo truth values of pl and ph are taken
from gSeaGen. The errors in reconstructing them are calculated by considering the leptonic
and hadronic components separately, i.e. it is assumed that the photons from the lepton
can be identified. Correlations between energy and direction errors for each component
are accounted for. A brief investigation has shown correlations with other properties of
neutrino interactions to be very small (appendix A.3), so they are ignored in this work.

A further approximation is required when Eh or Ee,µ do not equal one of the discrete
simulated energies. In such cases, the expected properties of ∆E/E and ∆θ are interpolated
for E > 1GeV, and extrapolated for E < 1GeV. Thus, neutrino resolution limits depending
on components — especially hadronic cascades — with E < 1GeV should be interpreted
with care.

3 Hadronic cascade reconstruction

3.1 Energy resolution

An example of the fluctuations in the photon yield for a hadronic cascade with Eh = 5GeV
is given in figure 3. The effect of different hadronic states is asymmetric, with relatively
many events producing a large number of photons. A brief investigation suggests that
these are hadronic cascades with a large electromagnetic component (γ, e±, π0). Particle
propagation effects however are more symmetric and centrally-peaked. Their combined
effect in the all-photon limit is compared to a Gaussian fit.

The hadronic cascade energy Eh can be estimated from the total number of detected
photons, with fluctuations therein producing fluctuations in the estimated energy. Since
the total number of emitted photons is not linearly proportional to hadronic cascade energy
(as in the case of electrons), the hadronic cascade energy is estimated using a fit to the
total number of photons, Nγ,h. This can be expressed as a fraction fh relative to that
from electromagnetic cascades of the same energy, Nγ,e (appendix C), i.e. Nγ,h(Eh) =
fh(Eh)Nγ,e(Eh). The fit,

photon number, ∆Nγ/Nγ , in hadronic cascades with Eh = 5GeV. Shown are the contributions
from hadronic state (purple), particle propagation (green), and their combined effect in the all-
photon limit (black). A Gaussian fit (black line) to the all-photon limit is shown to illustrate its
appropriateness in characterising these fluctuations.

uses the same functional form as ref. [16], and is shown in figure 4 (black solid line). The
energy dependence of fh means that a deviation in the number of photons will have a
non-linear effect on the reconstructed energy. The relative error in reconstructed energy

where the coefficient of ∆Nγ/Nγ is the energy error reduction factor and is also shown
in figure 4. As fh is an increasing function, the resulting relative errors in reconstructed
energy tend to be smaller than the intrinsic relative Nγ fluctuations. For hadronic state
and propagation fluctuations, variation in the Monte Carlo values of all Nγ about the mean
value are used for ∆Nγ , while for photon sampling, the Poisson variation in the number of
detected photons, Ndetγ , is used:(

The resulting relative energy errors, calculated by applying eq. 3.2 to relative variations
in photon number from simulations (e.g. figure 3), are shown in figure 5. In the all-photon
limit, fluctuations in hadronic state dominate over the whole energy range. The effect due
to photon sampling is relatively small, so that the overall limiting resolution is only slightly
larger than the all-photon limit.

The light yield of hadronic cascades (figure 4) and its intrinsic fluctuations (figure 5)
were also investigated by ref. [16] down to 10GeV, with broadly similar results.

(eq. 3.1). Cascades simulated with G-GHEISHA (G-FLUKA) are shown in black (blue). Also shown
for G-GHEISHA is the resulting error reduction factor as defined in eq. 3.2 (black dotted line).

3.2 Direction resolution

A robust method to estimate the mean hadronic cascade direction is to use the mean
direction of detected unscattered photons — the validity of this method is discussed in
appendix C.2. In the all-photon limit, this estimate will be made using all emitted photons,
while for photon sampling, only the detected unscattered fraction is used. An illustration
of the resulting effects on the direction resolution is given in figure 6 for a single hadronic
final state. The distributions of direction errors for Eh = 5GeV are illustrated in figure 7.

Limiting direction resolutions for hadronic cascades between 1GeV and 20GeV are
presented in figure 8. Below ∼ 2GeV, variation in the initial hadronic state dominates the
direction resolution in the all-photon limit, while above this energy particle propagation
effects dominate. Over the entire energy range, their combined effect in the all-photon
limit is less significant than the effects of photon sampling, so that the overall limiting
resolution is worse. The relative difference in results between the G-FLUKA and G-GHEISHA
cases is less than ∼ 10%.

4 Resolutions of muon- and electron-neutrino charged-current events

Using the results for hadronic cascades of the previous section, and adding results for
muon tracks and electron cascades from appendices B and C, limits on the reconstruction
accuracy of ↪ ↩νµ and ↪ ↩ν e CC events in the 1–20GeV range can be deduced.4

4The accuracy for NC events of all flavours can be deduced from the interaction kinematics and the
limiting resolutions for hadronic cascade reconstruction (section 3), while the more complex, and much

Figure 5. Relative errors (RMS) in reconstructed energy for hadronic cascades, due to hadronic
state (purple), particle propagation (green), their combined effect in the all-photon limit (black),
and the additional variation introduced due to photon sampling (blue) in the overall limit (red).
The mean is calculated from the average between the G-GHEISHA (larger) and G-FLUKA (smaller)
results, and the error bars cover the range between them.

The neutrino energy Eν and normalised direction, ~uν , can be reconstructed using the
interaction kinematics of eq. 2.1, i.e. by combining the reconstructed lepton properties with
that of the hadronic cascade:

Erecoν = E
reco
` + E

reco
h ,

~urecoν = w`
Ereco`
Erecoν

~ureco` + wh
Erecoh
Erecoν

~urecoh . (4.1)

Naively, the weights w` and wh could be set to unity, at which point eq. 4.1 closely resembles
eq. 2.1. However, there are several reasons for having w` and wh differ from unity. Firstly,
while the hadronic cascade momentum magnitude |~ph| is assumed not to be reconstructable,
it can be estimated using the reconstructed value of Eh and the expected ratio Eh/|~ph|,
which is plotted in figure 9. Fluctuations in this ratio can be considered as an additional
hadronic-state contribution to neutrino direction resolution, which is not included in either
the hadronic or lepton components.

A second factor influencing the weight is the relative accuracy of ~u` and ~uh. In general,
the best estimator of ~uν will be found by reducing wh and increasing w` to reduce the
influence of the much larger fluctuations in ~uh, even if this biases the resulting estimate in
the direction of the lepton.

rarer, ↪ ↩ν τ CC events can be approximated by combining electron, muon, and hadronic cascade resolutions
according to τ decay products.

Figure 6. Photon distributions from a hadronic cascade with Eh = 10GeV. The true cascade
direction is in the ~uz direction, at (θx, θy) = (0, 0) (green circle). The mean photon direction,
averaged over 1000 simulation iterations with the same hadronic final state, is given by the purple
star — the 3◦ offset from (0, 0) reflects the intrinsic bias for this particular state. The distribution
of all emitted photons for one particular propagation iteration is shown by the grey shading. The
mean direction of all these photons is given by the black plus sign — the 8◦ offset of this from
(0, 0) measures the total intrinsic variation in the case of the all-photon limit, while the 5◦ offset
from the purple star measures the variation due to random particle propagation only. A random
sample of unscattered photons, chosen according to the probabilities of figure 2, are shown by blue
triangles, along with their mean direction (red diamond). The 25◦ offset of the red diamond from
the black cross measures the variation due to photon sampling only, while the offset of 18◦ from
(0, 0) gives the overall variation.

A third and final factor is the use of eq. 2.1 to constrain the measured values of ph and
p`, both by requiring they add to a physical value of pν , and by imposing prior likelihoods
on the implied interaction kinematics.

The general situation of choosing arbitrary weights between ~u` and ~uh is illustrated
in figure 10. Ultimately, the optimum method would define weights based on the recon-
structed energies of both components, and the angle between them, to account for the
three aforementioned factors. However, such an optimisation is beyond the scope of this
paper.

In the following, three methods are investigated. The first method (section 4.1) is the
naive ‘four-momentum conservation’ approach using wh = w` = 1. This is motivated by
the momentum-magnitude and statistical down-weighting factors mentioned above tending
to cancel each other, and because it is simple and robust. The second method (section 4.2)

resolution, which are shown separately.

Figures 13 and 14 show the neutrino energy and direction resolutions for νe, νe, νµ
and νµ CC events as a function of neutrino energy integrated over the corresponding y
distributions. Both energy and direction resolutions are better for ν CC than for ν CC
events, since the former have on-average smaller y. Because the muon track length is a
more reliable energy estimator than the total light yield, the energy resolution for ↪ ↩νµ is
slightly better than for ↪ ↩ν e (see appendices B and C). For comparison, in case of measuring
only the lepton energy — and ignoring the hadronic cascade energy — the resolution is
nearly energy independent with ∆E/E ≈ 0.5 (0.3) for νe,µ (νe,µ) CC events. Also, note
that while the direction resolution for ν CC events is significantly better than the scattering
angle φν,` between neutrino and lepton, the direction resolution for ν CC events is slightly
worse.

4.2 Using the expected neutrino-lepton scattering angle

Using the hadronic cascade for neutrino direction reconstruction is limited predominantly
by the large error ∆θh on the direction of the hadronic cascade. Two secondary factors
are: the resolution of Eh, which leads to errors in ~uν through eq. 4.1; and the inability
to reconstruct |~ph|, which necessitates some assumption about Eh/|~ph|. An improvement
therefore might be made by only using ~uh to define the plane of the interaction, and

Figure 15 shows the neutrino direction resolution limits for ↪ ↩ν e CC events as a function
of Eν and y, relative to those shown in figure 12.5 For a large region of parameter space
in the Eν–y plane, this method provides a better neutrino direction reconstruction (ratio
< 1), with up to ∼ 25% improvement. It does not perform well at large y due to an
intrinsically large scatter in φν,`.

4.3 Treating electron neutrino charged-current events as a single cascade

If the detector is not able to distinguish between photons from the electromagnetic and
the hadronic cascade in ↪ ↩ν e CC events, the reconstruction must treat all photons as coming
from a single cascade. This corresponds to applying the method for hadronic cascades of
section 3 to entire ↪ ↩ν e CC events, using the approximate 2.5:1 ratio of atmospheric νe and
νe CC events in this energy range [18, 19].

5The resolutions for ↪ ↩νµ CC are very similar to those for ↪ ↩ν e CC events.

e± and hadronic cascade can be resolved. Due to the lack of knowledge about the source
of the photons, at Eν = 10GeV the energy resolution worsens from 16.8% to 19.3%. This
deterioration emphasises the importance of the capability to identify the electron in ↪ ↩ν e CC
events in order to allow for more advanced reconstruction procedures.

In the unresolved photon source case, contributions from different sources of variation
are separately shown in figure 16. The variation due to the unknown inelasticity of the
interaction is calculated by fixing the number of photons from the electron and hadronic
cascades to their mean values and varying y using the true distribution. The variation
due to photon sampling is given by the average Poisson error on Nγ (eq. 3.3), summed
over both components. The remaining variation is attributed to the contribution from the
hadronic state and propagation of the hadronic cascade, and is calculated by subtracting
both previously mentioned contributions in quadrature from the overall energy resolution.
In addition, when the photon source is unresolved, the energy resolution for a mixed
composition of νe and νe CC events becomes worse than a simple linear combination of
their individual results would suggest, since fluctuations of Nγ about the joint mean are
necessarily larger. The light yield of νe and νe CC events differs by ∼ 10% in the considered
energy range.

Variations in inelasticity affect the e± unresolved case by smearing the relation between
the neutrino energy and the expected Nγ . However, the effect is still non-zero in the e±

resolved case, where fluctuations in y imply that hadronic and electromagnetic energies
must be estimated independently. This is why the resolutions for both cases are identical

at low energies: when Eν is small, almost all light will come from the outgoing e±; Eh will
not be directly observable; and both cases will reduce to measuring Ee only, and relating
that to Eν based purely on the expected value of y.

In the case of direction resolution when the photon source is unresolved, mainly neu-
trino interactions with small inelasticity (y . 0.25) have a worse resolution. Without the
additional knowledge about the source of the photons, the neutrino direction resolution
degrades from 11.6◦ (9.2◦) to 11.8◦ (10.3◦) for νe (νe) CC at Eν = 10GeV.

5 Resolution of interaction inelasticity

The different differential cross sections of ν and ν interactions allow them to be statistically
separated, which will add significance to a neutrino mass hierarchy measurement [4]. The
energy resolutions obtained in section 3 and appendices B and C can be readily converted
into limiting resolutions on the interaction inelasticity y (eq. 2.2), using

Figure 17 shows the ytrue distributions for νµ and νµ CC events, and the yreco distributions

Despite the relatively poor resolution on Eh, the differences between the yreco and ytrue

distributions are small. Partly, this is due to the lack of structure in the y distribution,

caused by the finite muon mass. Due to a fraction of low-energy hadronic cascades producing very
few photons, the yreco distribution is shifted to the left, causing the excess in the first bin (as
yreco → 0).

particularly for νe,µ interactions, and partly because the error in yreco tends to zero with
both Eh and Ee, as can be seen from eq. 5.1.

The statistical resolution between the y distributions from neutrinos Pν(y) and an-
tineutrinos Pν(y) can be characterised using the correlation coefficient, c, by defining the
separation power s as

Perfect separation is indicated by s = 1, while no separation corresponds to s = 0. The
degradation due to limiting accuracies on a detector’s ability to distinguish between ν and
ν is given by comparing s calculated using ytrue and yreco. Following the same procedure as
in section 4.1, figure 18 shows the separation power as a function of neutrino energy both
with and without reconstruction errors. Above Eν = 5GeV, where the intrinsic separation
power is highest, the relative reduction in separation power for both all-photon and overall
limits is 5% or less.

6 Discussion

the confounding effects of the optical backgrounds, detector layout, PMT response, event
triggering and selection, and uses events that are not necessarily fully contained in the
detector.

Both ↪ ↩νµ and ↪ ↩ν e CC event reconstruction methods described in ref. [2] aim to identify
the direction of the outgoing lepton, with a limiting resolution for the neutrino direction
of the scattering angle θν,` (figure 14). Accounting for different presentation methods
(space angle vs. zenith angle, median vs. 68% quantile), the resulting direction resolutions
(figures 68, 81 and 82 in ref. [2]) are very close to this limitation. Thus, all prospects
for improving the resolution using information from the accompanying hadronic cascade
discussed in section 4 apply, and the resolution is not downgraded significantly in the case
of a detector with a larger spacing between photon sensors. Furthermore, it indicates
that the direction resolution of ORCA for µ and e is not significantly degraded by the
aforementioned confounding effects. Indeed, the electron direction resolution of ORCA
(figure 82 of ref. [2]) is close to the ‘1D’ limit (figure 28 in appendix C) presented in this
paper.

A comparison to the performance of the energy reconstruction for ↪ ↩ν e CC events is
shown in figure 19. Besides the resolution for the nominal event sample from ref. [2],
the influence of poorly contained events is eliminated by applying a strict containment
criterion based on Monte Carlo truth information. These resolutions are compared to both
the e± resolved and e± unresolved case of ↪ ↩ν e CC energy reconstruction limits described in
section 4. The event selection using strict containment cuts shows an accuracy comparable
to the limiting e± unresolved accuracy — this is not unexpected, since event reconstruction
in a real detector cannot perfectly differentiate between photons from the outgoing lepton
and from the hadronic cascade.

In the case of ↪ ↩νµ CC events, the length of the muon track makes it difficult to define
a fully contained event for a significant range of the parameter space, and the results are
currently too strongly affected by selection effects to make comparisons useful.

6.2 Applicability to in-ice detectors

The simulations in this paper have been performed in seawater, and assumptions on re-
construction methods are most applicable to the techniques proposed for ORCA. However,
since ice and seawater are predominantly composed of H2O, both primary neutrino in-
teractions and subsequent particle propagation are similar. The refractive index of ice
is also similar to that of seawater at optical and near-UV wavelengths (between 1.3 and
1.4) [6, 20]. Hence, limits due to different hadronic final states and particle propagation
(i.e. all-photon limits) will therefore be almost directly applicable to in-ice experiments.
Since ice has a lower absorption coefficient than seawater, the photon sampling effects
on the energy reconstruction of electrons and hadronic cascades will be significantly lower
than those presented here, though perhaps could be calculated with a simple scaling factor.
Limits on the neutrino energy resolution (figure 11) however are dominated by fluctuations
due to different hadronic states (cf. section 3.1) and not by limited photon statistics. For
direction reconstruction, the photon sampling effect in ice is difficult to estimate: a much
higher scattering coefficient reduces the number of unscattered photons, but as discussed
above, scattered photons do contain some directional information.

– 20 –



Therefore, it is expected that both all-photon and overall limits on the energy recon-
struction accuracy will apply equally well in ice, while direction reconstruction limits are
strictly applicable only in the all-photon case.

6.3 Comparison to estimates in the literature

The limiting resolutions derived here can be used to assess the validity of several estimates
of the sensitivity of PINGU, and hence approximately ORCA, to the neutrino mass hierar-
chy. Some, such as the calculations of refs. [21–23], use the published resolutions from the
experiments, for which the comparisons above apply. Others, in particular refs. [1, 24, 25],
use their own resolution estimates, or approximations of the published results. None of
these authors take into account the correlations between energy and direction resolutions,
or the differences between ν and ν interactions.

The neutrino direction resolutions from refs. [1, 24, 25] are compatible with the limits
presented in this work. However, direction errors are often [1, 25] assumed to be Gaussian
in zenith angle and not in space angle (the limits presented in this work are functions of
space angle).

The energy resolutions assumed by these authors [1, 25] range from 15% to 35%, and
tend to become incompatible with the limits (cf. figure 16) at low energies, i.e. they are
too optimistic in this range.

Effects governing neutrino resolution have also been investigated in ref. [24]. However,
the authors do not consider the fluctuations in hadronic cascades due to different hadronic
final states or particle propagation. Additionally, they overestimate the light yield of
hadronic cascades, assuming fh = 80% (eq. 3.1), independent of energy. This is significantly
too large for the considered energies (cf. figure 4). Consequently, they underestimate the
contribution due to variation in inelasticity y. Furthermore, the neglected effects contribute
significantly to the limiting resolutions on neutrino energy. As a consequence, the energy
resolutions assumed in ref. [24] are incompatible with the limits derived here.

6.4 Sensitivity to physical uncertainties

The logic of this paper is to assume that all physical processes are perfectly modelled,
and fluctuations within these models are studied. In particular, this applies to the use of
GENIE for neutrino interaction as well as hadronisation, and GEANT for particle propagation.
Deviations in this modelling from the truth will have two effects. Firstly, it may lead to sys-
tematic shifts between reconstructed and true parameters. These can only act to worse the
resolution, but might be accounted for through the use of nuisance parameters in global fits
(see e.g. section 4.6 in ref. [2]). Secondly, intrinsic fluctuations about the mean behaviour
could either increase or decrease, causing a corresponding worsening or improvement in
resolutions. The sensitivity of ORCA to this second effect can be gauged from the relative
effects of hadronic state, particle propagation, and photon sampling fluctuations.

As shown in section 3, the energy resolution on the hadronic cascade is dominated
by the intrinsic fluctuations in the emitted Cherenkov light due to effects of hadronic
state variations. Therefore, experiments such as ORCA might be sensitive to systematic
uncertainties in the neutrino interaction and hadronisation process in the range of a few
GeV. These processes are very difficult to model. GENIE [8] uses scaling methods [26] to
extend PYTHIA [27, 28] to this region. Nonetheless, there are several remaining discrepancies

– 21 –



between experimental data and theory, and work is ongoing to improve the performance of
both GENIE and other neutrino interaction simulation tools (see e.g. ref. [29], and references
contained therein). The impact of variation in PYTHIA parameters has been found to be
small for inelasticity measurements [29]. As discussed in section 5 however, inelasticity is
also relatively insensitive to intrinsic fluctuations, and so is not a good indicator of model
sensitivity. If experiments such as ORCA are affected by such systematic uncertainties,
then data collected with ORCA might also help to constrain the models.

Determining this sensitivity however would require dedicated studies, which would be
beyond the scope of this paper.

7 Conclusion

An investigation of the intrinsic limits on resolutions for neutrino events in the 1–20GeV
energy regime for the KM3NeT/ORCA water Cherenkov detector in the Mediterranean Sea
has been performed. Limits on the energy and direction resolution of muon tracks, and of
hadronic and electromagnetic cascades have been calculated. These have been combined
to derive limits on primary ↪ ↩νµ and ↪ ↩ν e CC resolutions, and the interaction inelasticity y.
The results indicate the best reconstruction accuracies achievable with the ORCA detector
under the assumption that Cherenkov cones from individual hadronic particles will not be
reconstructable. The results are presented for both the benchmark ORCA detector, and
in the theoretical case that all photons are detected, which also limits resolutions for a
detector with a significantly increased photocathode density.

It is found that the limits imposed by the methods described are close to the ORCA
resolutions for ↪ ↩ν e CC events obtained using full simulations, indicating that the influence
of effects such as natural optical background light and the time- and charge-resolution of
KM3NeT PMTs are at most small.

The main result is that the energy resolution of few-GeV neutrinos is primarily dictated
by intrinsic fluctuations in the number of emitted Cherenkov photons. The uncertainty
due to detecting only a small fraction of them plays only a minor role. Light yield fluctua-
tions are dominated by the fluctuations in the hadronic final state in conjunction with the
variation of the interaction inelasticity y, emphasising the importance of accurate neutrino
interaction models. The neutrino direction resolution is dominated by the large errors
in hadronic cascade direction reconstruction, which is mainly driven by detected photon
statistics. Due to the significantly worse resolutions for hadronic cascades than for muons
and electrons, the neutrino energy and direction errors, are strongly correlated via the in-
elasticity y. The methods allowing an optimum reconstruction which have been identified
in this paper thus also depend on y. This emphasises the importance of resolving the out-
going lepton in a ↪ ↩ν e,µ CC interaction — a capability which has already been demonstrated
for ORCA [2]. Such a result is also important for the statistical discrimination between ν
and ν using their different y distributions and, hence, increased mass hierarchy sensitivity.
Importantly, it has been shown that intrinsic fluctuations do not significantly degrade this
discrimination power.

The nature of these limits means that these conclusions will hold for neutrino detection
in ice, and for different detector configurations, up to the point that a Super-Kamiokande-
style reconstruction of the Cherenkov cone from each individual particle becomes possible.

– 22 –



The results of this investigations also explain why the resolutions for ORCA presented in the
Letter of Intent for KM3NeT 2.0 [2] do not significantly degrade for larger spacings between
optical modules. This motivates an increase in the nominal vertical spacing between optical
modules of the ORCA benchmark design from 6m to 9m. Moreover, the results allow the
broader community to make improved estimates of the potential sensitivity of ORCA to
the neutrino mass hierarchy, including for alternative detector layouts. Digitised results
are available as supplementary material in the online version of this article.

A Further simulation details

A.1 GEANT settings

GEANT was set to track electrons down to their Cherenkov threshold of 0.25MeV, and
photons down to 0.4MeV, at which the maximum energy of Compton knock-on electrons
is 0.25MeV. The simulation also allows the explicit production and tracking of δ-electrons
above 0.25MeV. To ensure the necessary accuracy of electron tracking at low energies, the
standard GEANT 3.21 routine ‘gtelec.f’ had to be modified (setting IABAN to 0) to avoid
the premature stopping of electrons. Additionally, slow neutrons with kinetic energies
below ∼ 100MeV were artificially removed from the simulation to avoid an unphysical
number of neutron captures and subsequent nuclei decays. The GEANT implementations of
both GHEISHA [13] and FLUKA [14, 15] were used for hadronic tracking.

A.2 G-GHEISHA vs. G-FLUKA

Hadron tracking in GEANT 3.21 can be performed by either GHEISHA [13] or a preliminary
version of FLUKA [14, 15], often respectively termed ‘G-GHEISHA’ and ‘G-FLUKA’ to distin-
guish their implementations in GEANT from independent distributions. A comparison of
these packages, both with each other, an independent version of FLUKA, and experimental
data was performed in ref. [30] in the relevant range around 1–100GeV. The most rele-
vant observed deviations from expected behaviour were the non-conservation of energy and
baryon number by G-GHEISHA in pion-nucleon interactions; and an underestimation of up

(G-GHEISHA accuracies were of order 10%).

In order to characterise the effects of the choice of G-GHEISHA or G-FLUKA, the resulting
distributions of the mean number of detected photons and its standard deviation have been
studied. For hadronic cascades with Eh = 10GeV, G-FLUKA shows on average a∼ 6% higher
light yield (cf. figure 4) and ∼ 10% less fluctuations than G-GHEISHA.

A.3 Selection of hadronic cascades

The chosen hadronic events were sampled from GENIE 2.8.4 simulations of ↪ ↩νµ CC events
with original neutrino energies between 1 and 100 GeV. The first thousand events having a
required hadronic energy Eh (defined according to eq. 2.1) within 1% of the nominal values
were chosen for each of the energies specified in table 1. Preliminary studies indicated that
for a fixed Eh, differences in event properties (mean light yield, particle content) due to a
different choice of primary neutrino (flavour, energy) were negligible, in accordance with
ref. [31].

In section 2.2, it is noted that more-detailed kinematical properties of neutrino events
(four-momentum transfer squared q2 for instance) may be correlated with energy and
direction reconstruction errors, and that this association is lost when selecting hadronic
final states using Eh only. It was found that the correlation between direction error and
q2 is small, with correlation coefficient |c| < 0.05. The correlation between Nγ (cascade
energy, section 3.1) and q2 is slightly larger, at c ≈ 0.15. This is still much smaller than
the correlation between Nγ and the direction error (c ≈ −0.5), which is accounted for in
the results of section 4. Figure 20 compares the neutrino direction resolution obtained
using the method of section 4 with that using the exact hadronic final state from each
interaction, i.e. accounting for any/all correlations, including that with q2. A very good
agreement is achieved.

Similarly, investigations have shown that the intrinsic energy and direction resolutions
for hadronic cascades induced by Z0 bosons are very similar to that induced byW± bosons
[17], with relative differences in all resolutions below 5% for Eh > 3GeV.

A further approximation is required when Eh or Ee,µ do not equal one of the simulated
energies of table 1, in which case the expected properties ∆E/E, ∆θ must be interpolated
between simulated values. When E < 1GeV, the values of ∆θ and ∆E/E were set to
their values at 1GeV. In the case of energy resolution in the overall limit (including photon
sampling), uncertainties due to photon sampling are extrapolated according to the photon

B Muon tracks

B.1 Energy resolution

In the considered energy range of 1–20GeV, muons behave very similarly to minimum
ionising particles: they experience a roughly constant energy loss per unit track length,
and travel in approximately straight lines. Therefore, their signature in water and ice
Cherenkov detectors is a straight track with a nearly uniform luminance.

This behaviour leads to two obvious methods of muon energy reconstruction: the track
length, and the total Cherenkov light yield.

Light yield. The same principles as for hadronic cascade energy reconstruction discussed
in section 3.1 are used, simplified by the number of emitted photons Nγ being almost
directly proportional to Eµ. Thus, relative all-photon energy reconstruction errors are
calculated as

The sampling errors are given by eq. 3.3, with Ndetγ = 22.0 × (Eµ − Ethµ )/GeV being the

emission of muons in seawater. These two sources of variation (all-photon and photon
sampling) are independent, and can be added in quadrature to find the overall uncertainty.

Track length. Assuming in all cases that the starting point of a muon track can be
resolved perfectly using information from the accompanying hadronic cascade, the general
strategy of a muon track length measurement is to detect the endpoint of a muon track using
information from unscattered photons, i.e. by back-projecting onto the track assuming the
Cherenkov angle.

In the all-photon limit, it is assumed that the track endpoint can be determined pre-
cisely. Fluctuations in the muon track length Lµ itself will then correspond directly to an
error in the energy reconstruction. If ∆Lµ(Eµ) is the fluctuation of Lµ, the relative energy
resolution in the all-photon limit is given by

. (B.2)

The distribution of the relative track length for 3GeV and 10GeV muons is shown in
figure 21.

In the overall limit, the relatively small number of sampled unscattered photons will
limit the resolution on the muon path. The muon track length measurement is then
determined by the distance from the starting point to the position where the last detected,
unscattered photon is emitted by the muon. The corresponding uncertainty, ∆Lsamplingµ , is
estimated from the variation about the mean offset between the position of last emission
and the true muon endpoint. For the assumed photon detection probability (figure 2),
this results in roughly 0.1GeV uncertainty on the muon energy. The overall limit on the
relative energy resolution is calculated by adding these components in quadrature.

Results. All-photon and overall limits on the relative muon energy resolution for both
discussed energy estimates are shown in figure 22.

In the case of the all-photon limit, fluctuations in total photon emission are almost
negligible, whereas those in the muon track length are not, so the total light yield method
is more accurate.

In the case of the overall limit, the additional fluctuations due to photon sampling in
the total light yield are significantly larger than the uncertainty due to detecting the track
endpoint, so that even when combined with intrinsic track length fluctuations, the muon
track length method is more accurate for this detector below 13GeV. Therefore, the track
length method is used when calculating results for ↪ ↩νµ CC throughout sections 4 and 5.

B.2 Direction resolution

In the case of the all-photon limit, under the assumption that the precise emission points
of each photon can be reconstructed, in theory it would be possible to measure the initial
direction of the muon track immediately after the neutrino interaction, giving perfect
direction resolution. Here, a single constraint is introduced to obtain intrinsic limits: that
the muon track fit assumes a linear muon path over its entire length, so that the linearity
of the track itself limits the accuracy of the direction fit.

The effects of photon sampling in the overall limit to the resolution is unclear, since
only a few unscattered photons (with perfect timing and position resolution) need to be
detected in order to fully constrain a track fit. It might be possible to obtain such limits
by considering the timing uncertainty of the PMTs, or the dispersion characteristics of
seawater. However, such limits will be very small indeed, as verified by the very good

from the straightness of a muon track itself will be considered, and applied equally to both

The slopes dx/dz and dy/dz from fits to the true muon path (which always begins
travelling along the z-axis) are used as the errors of such a muon track fit. Their distribu-
tions are fitted with Gaussians to derive their standard deviations, σx,y. This is shown for
3GeV and 10GeV muons in figure 23.

The resulting direction error, ∆θ =

and is shown as a function of muon energy in figure 24. Note that these direction errors
are dominated by multiple scattering, although the fitting procedure results in a different
direction error than more common measures of multiple scattering angles [33].

C Electron cascades

C.1 Energy resolution

The energy of an electron can be best estimated by counting all detected photons produced
by its subsequent cascade, which scales almost linearly with the electron energy Ee. The
resulting fluctuations can be calculated analogously to the total light yield method for
muons discussed in appendix B.1. For the all-photon limit, distributions of the total
number of detected photons Nγ for 3GeV and 10GeV electrons are given in figure 25. For
the overall limit, Poisson variation is calculated from the total number of detected photons
Ndete = 20.8× Ee/GeV.

C.2 Direction resolution

The method of estimating errors in the reconstructed direction of hadronic cascades pre-
sented in section 3.2 (‘2D’ method) is motivated by the intrinsic asymmetry of the light
pattern about the hadronic cascade axis. As this is not the case for a single electron, an al-
ternative (‘1D’) method is presented below, which is deemed most appropriate for electron
cascades.

Electron cascades tend to produce an azimuthally symmetric distribution of Cherenkov
light around the cascade axis, which can be described by a one-dimensional function of the
emission angle θ with respect to the cascade axis. A direction reconstruction can then fit
this function to trial cascade axes. Here, the direction error is characterised via fluctuations
in the mean values of the θ distributions. Distributions of θ, and of the mean values, are
shown in figure 27 for 5GeV electrons.

Results for the full energy range are shown in figure 28. For comparison, the direction
error resulting from the 2D method, as used for the hadronic cascade resolution in sec-
tion 3.2, is also shown. Errors due to photon sampling, and hence the overall limits, are
dominant over the entire energy range.

The 1D method underestimates fluctuations by using Monte Carlo truth information
to define an axis of symmetry, while the 2D method introduces artificial fluctuations in the
reconstruction of an azimuthally symmetric photon distribution by allowing a non-uniform
distribution in the azimuthal angle to influence the reconstructed direction.

For both the 1D and 2D cases, the errors in the all-photon limit are nonetheless small
compared to that due to photon sampling, so that the detected photon distribution will be
approximately azimuthally symmetric. This is in contrast to the case for hadronic cascades

(figure 8), where the large direction error in the all-photon limit is comparable to that due
to photon sampling. For electron cascades therefore, azimuthal symmetry (i.e. the 1D
method) could be used to reduce the error due to the small number of sampled unscattered
photons (∼ 10/GeV), while for hadronic cascades in this energy range it could not be,
and the 2D method must be used. The appropriateness of this choice of methods for both
electron and hadronic cascades has been verified by full (and computationally expensive)
likelihood reconstruction studies on subsets of data, producing results within O(10%) of
those shown here.
