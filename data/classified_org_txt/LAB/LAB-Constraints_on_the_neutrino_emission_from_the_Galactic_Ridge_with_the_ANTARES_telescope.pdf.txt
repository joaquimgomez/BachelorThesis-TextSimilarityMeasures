Abstract

Compelling evidence for the existence of astrophysical neutrinos
has been reported by the IceCube collaboration. Some features of
the energy and declination distributions of IceCube events hint at a
North/South asymmetry of the neutrino flux. This could be due to
the presence of the bulk of our Galaxy in the Southern hemisphere.
The ANTARES neutrino telescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea,
has been taking data since 2007. It offers the best sensitivity to muon
neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic ray interactions in this region
of the sky. In this letter a search for an extended neutrino flux from
the Galactic Ridge region is presented. Different models of neutrino
production by cosmic ray propagation are tested. No excess of events is
observed and upper limits for different neutrino flux spectral indices are
set. This constrains the number of IceCube events possibly originating
from the Galactic Ridge. A simple power-law extrapolation of the
Fermi-LAT flux to associated IceCube High Energy Starting Events is
excluded at 90% confidence level.

1 Introduction

Neutrino telescopes search for high-energy neutrinos produced by astrophys-
ical objects. The ANTARES detector [1] is the largest underwater neutrino
telescope. Its effective area, good angular resolution and good exposure to
the Southern sky has allowed the detector to produce the best limits on
neutrino emission from point-like objects at low declinations [2].

The existence of astrophysical neutrinos has been reported by the Ice-
Cube collaboration in various analyses [3, 4, 5, 6]. The observed flux is
compatible with the hypothesis of isotropy [7] and equipartition in the three
neutrino flavours [8]. Multiple conjectures have been made for the origin
of the observed signal and its features, some of which invoke a possible
asymmetry in the Northern vs Southern sky. Since the IceCube analysis
most-sensitive to the diffuse flux [3] is based on vetoing techniques to de-
tect contained downward-going events [9], the observed signal is dominantly
composed of shower-type events from the Southern Hemisphere, making the
analysis relatively insensitive to such an asymmetry. The directional resolu-
tion in the High Energy Starting Events (HESE) sample for shower events is
limited, and individual sources of the signal have not been identified so far.
For the ANTARES location, in the Mediterranean Sea, the Southern sky
is accessible via upward-going muon tracks, for which a sub-degree angular
resolution is achieved [10]. Consequently, an ensemble of individual point
sources, or an extended region with an enhanced emission, might appear
diffuse to IceCube but resolvable by ANTARES.

The central part of the Milky Way is considered a guaranteed extended
source of neutrinos that originate from the decay of short-lived particles pro-
duced by the interaction of primary cosmic rays (CRs) with the surrounding
matter. Though this flux is usually considered too low to explain the Ice-
Cube signal observed in the Southern sky [11], recent computations have
shown that a possible enhancement of the neutrino flux could be present in
the bulk of our Galaxy [12, 13].

In this letter, a search for neutrinos (νµ + ν̄µ) from the central region of
the Galactic Plane is presented, using ANTARES data from 2007 to 2013.
The motivation for this search in the context of the IceCube measurement
is discussed in § 2 and the ANTARES detector and the considered data set
are introduced in § 3. The search method and the optimisation procedures
based on Monte Carlo simulations are described in § 4. The results of the

4



analysis are presented and discussed in § 5 and § 6.

2 Neutrinos from our Galaxy and the IceCube sig-
nal

The IceCube data currently provide the sole observation of high-energy cos-
mic neutrinos. The first measurements [3, 4, 5] were consistent with an
isotropic distribution of the arrival directions and thus an extragalactic
origin. The overall best fit of the signal was modelled with power-laws
dNν/dEν = Φ0E

−Γ
ν , yielding relatively soft spectral indices (Γ > 2). The

value Γ = 2 is expected for neutrinos produced from primary CRs acceler-
ated by the simplest Fermi shock acceleration models [14, 15] and interacting
near their sources [16]. The recent IceCube analysis [7] using different data
samples excludes the E−2.0ν spectrum in the energy range between 25 TeV
and 2.8 PeV with a significance of more than 3.8σ, assuming that the astro-
physical neutrino flux is isotropic and consisting of equal flavours at Earth.
Under the same assumptions, the best-fit spectral index is Γ = 2.50 ± 0.09
and the normalization at the energy of 100 TeV (for all three neutrino

flavours, 3f) is Φ

−18 GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1. No
significant excess is found when searching for spatial anisotropies.

IceCube observes neutrinos from the Southern sky as downward-going
events. The HESE sample is selected with a vetoing technique that dis-
favours the detection of track-like events. As a consequence, the event sam-
ple is dominated by shower-like events, for which the detector has a typical
angular uncertainty of 10-20◦. Muon neutrinos coming from the Northern
hemisphere are detected as upward-going muon tracks from charged current
(CC) interactions [6], yielding a best-fit, single-flavour flux Φ

−19 GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1 and assuming Γ = 2.

The separate fit of the fluxes from the Northern and Southern hemi-
spheres [7] indicates a preference (although with small statistical signifi-
cance) for a harder spectrum in the Northern hemisphere. Moreover, some
authors have observed that events are concentrated near the Galactic Centre
and Galactic Plane regions in a way that seems inconsistent with an isotropic
neutrino distribution [17, 18]. Such a difference between the Northern and
Southern skies could potentially stem from the presence of a softer contri-
bution to the neutrino flux from the Galaxy in the Southern hemisphere
[19].

The isotropic distribution of extragalactic sources (such as active galactic
nuclei or γ-ray bursts) presumably dominating the signal from the Northern

5



hemisphere. Models generally foresee that neutrinos from these sources will
be generated via photo-hadronic interactions of high-energy protons with
low-energy photons of the background. These models are characterised by
relatively high-energy thresholds (due to charged pion production) and dis-
favour a soft neutrino spectrum [20, 21].

Neutrinos produced by proton-proton (or nuclei) interactions through
the decay chain of secondary charged mesons (mainly pions) have a spectrum
with a spectral index Γ close to that of the parent hadrons but with a lower
energy threshold [22]. Since in p-p interactions the number of charged pions
is approximately twice that of neutral pions (which decay to a pair of γ), the
neutrino flux can be constrained from the observed γ-ray flux. Due to the
high density of matter in the central part of the Galactic Plane, a neutrino
signal coming from this part of the sky, mostly located in the Southern
hemisphere, is expected to follow this emission scenario.

Fermi-LAT data provide the best measurement of the diffuse γ-ray flux in
the Galactic Plane up to ∼ 100 GeV [23]. Given certain model assumptions,
the fraction of this flux attributed to hadronic processes can be estimated,
allowing the derivation of the neutrino yield from CR propagation. Conven-
tional models of CR propagation in our Galaxy predict a much lower and
softer neutrino spectrum (Γ ' 2.7) [24, 25] than that measured by IceCube.

New predictions for the neutrino production due to CR propagation have
been presented recently. The authors of [12] start with the observation that
conventional models of Galactic CR propagation (in a medium normalised to
the locally observed one, and with the same diffusion properties in the whole
Galaxy) cannot explain the large γ-ray flux measured by Milagro [26] from
the inner Galactic Plane region and by H.E.S.S. [27] from the Galactic Ridge
region. To reconcile Fermi-LAT, Milagro and H.E.S.S. data, they have de-
veloped a phenomenological model characterised by radially-dependent CR
transport properties, which foresees a neutrino spectral index in the range
Γ ' 2.4 − 2.5. In [13], a sizeable neutrino flux is expected to be produced
by the interaction of fresh CRs, which are hadrons supplied by young accel-
erators and contained by the local magnetic field, with the ambient matter.
The authors of [28] note that IceCube observes 3 events in the Eν > 100 TeV
energy range with arrival direction compatible with a Galactic Ridge origin
(|`| < 30◦, |b| < 4◦). Furthermore, the corresponding neutrino flux matches
the high-energy power-law extrapolation of the spectrum of diffuse γ-ray
emission from the Galactic Ridge as observed by Fermi-LAT. This moti-
vates the hypothesis that these IceCube neutrino events and Fermi-LAT
γ-ray flux are both produced in interactions of CRs with the interstellar
medium in the inner Galactic region. All these models predict an enhance-

6



ment of the neutrino flux coming from a limited region close to the Galactic
Centre.

3 The ANTARES detector and dataset

The ANTARES underwater neutrino telescope [1] is located 40 km off the
Southern coast of France in the Mediterranean Sea (42◦ 48′ N, 6◦ 10′ E).
It consists of a three-dimensional array of 10-inch photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs). Neutrino detection is based on the observation of Cherenkov light
induced in the medium by relativistic charged particles. Some of the emitted
photons produce signals in the PMTs (“hits”). The position, time and
collected charge of the hits are used to infer the direction and energy of the
incident neutrino.

The study presented here focuses on track-like events, associated with
CC interactions of muon neutrinos. The muon direction is correlated with
that of the incoming neutrino, and a sub-degree angular resolution on the
neutrino arrival direction can be achieved by means of a maximum likelihood
fit [10].

Data collected from May 2007 to December 2013 constitute the data
sample for the present analysis, with an effective total livetime of 1622 days.
High quality data runs, defined according to environmental and data taking
conditions, have been selected for this work (analogously to [2]). A detailed
Monte Carlo simulation is available for each data acquisition run [29, 30].

4 The search method

An enhancement of the neutrino diffuse emission from a region of the sky
covering a small solid angle can be searched for by comparing the number
of events coming from the region (on-zone) to that of regions with no ex-
pected signal and the same acceptance to the background (off-zones). To
enhance the harder signal over the background of atmospheric neutrinos, a
cut selecting mainly high-energy events is defined. This approach has al-
ready been used to search for neutrino candidates from the region of the
Fermi Bubbles [31]. Optimising this method requires: 1) an efficient sup-
pression of atmospheric events; 2) the optimisation of the size of the search
region and 3) the subsequent definition of background-only regions, each
having the same exposure as that of the signal region. The analysis uses
Monte Carlo simulations only in the optimisation of the event selection; this
avoids biases in the estimation of the signal and background and reduces

7



systematic effects. Monte Carlo data sets are produced simulating real data
acquisition conditions, taking into account the actual detection efficiency of
the apparatus.

The signal is assumed to be a power-law diffuse flux with arbitrary nor-
malisation and spectral indices varying from Γ = 2.0 to 2.7. Motivated by
the IceCube best fit and models of neutrino production from CR propaga-
tion, the event selection criteria have been optimised in order to achieve the
best sensitivity for a signal with spectral index Γ = 2.4. They are identical
to those obtained for Γ = 2.5. The optimal cuts are found using the Model
Rejection Factor (MRF) minimisation technique [32].

The background component due to mis-reconstructed atmospheric muons,
which mimick upgoing neutrino events, has been simulated using the MU-
PAGE program [36]. This background is suppressed by cuts on quality
parameters of upgoing reconstructed tracks: Λ, which is related to the max-
imum likelihood of the fit, and β, which estimates the angular error. The
distributions of Λ and β for atmospheric neutrinos, atmospheric muons and
data are reported in [10]. It is found that the cut Λ > −5.0 and β < 0.5◦
optimises the MRF and suppresses the contamination from wrongly recon-
structed atmospheric muons in the upgoing sample to the level of 1%.

The remaining background consists of atmospheric neutrinos [33]. The
conventional component, coming from the decay of pions and kaons, has
been shaped according to [34] while the flux from [35] has been used for the
prompt component, expected from charmed hadron decays. This component
is reduced by imposing a cut on the estimated energy of the events, limiting
the event sample to the energy where the harder cosmic flux is expected
to emerge above the atmospheric background. For this analysis the energy
estimator EANN [37], derived from an artificial neural network algorithm,
is used. The standard deviation of the variable log10(EANN/Etrue), where
Etrue is the Monte Carlo true energy of the muon, is almost constant at
∼ 0.4 over the considered energy range. The MRF optimisation results in
EcutANN = 10 TeV as the best cut value. Above E

cut
ANN, only 6% of the selected

atmospheric neutrinos survive while 40% of the signal (for Γ = 2.4) passes
the cut.

Assuming a direct connection between the emission of γ-rays and neutri-
nos from pion decay in hadronic mechanisms [38], the γ-ray flux measured
by Fermi-LAT [23] is used to estimate the flux of galactic neutrinos. Though
this diffuse emission is extended over the whole Galactic Plane, it is much
brighter in the very central region; including non-central regions of the plane
in this search would mostly increase the atmospheric background. The MRF
method is used to determine the optimal search region for each spectral in-

dex. For a signal spectrum with Γ = −2.4, the signal region is represented
by the rectangle (enclosing the Galactic Centre) in galactic coordinates with
longitude |`| < 40◦ and latitude |b| < 3◦. This corresponds to a solid angle
of ∆Ω = 0.145 sr. Modifications to the longitudinal size of the signal region
do not significantly reduce the resulting sensitivity, while the latitude bound
has a larger effect - about 10% worsening per degree of increased size.

Off-zones are defined as fixed regions in equatorial coordinates, which
have identical size and shape as the signal region and are not overlapping
with it or each other. In local coordinates, off-zones span the same fraction
of the sky as the on-zone, but with some fixed delay in time, i.e. they differ
only in right ascention. They are shifted in the sky to avoid any overlap with
the Fermi Bubble regions [39], so that none of the possible signal events from
these areas enters into the background estimation. The maximum number
of independent off-zone regions is 9. The signal and background regions in
galactic coordinates are shown in Figure 1. Data from the signal region
were blinded until the event selection procedure was completely defined.
Off-zones can also be used to test the agreement between data and Monte
Carlo.

After the optimisation procedure, considering a signal flux with an en-
ergy spectrum with Γ = −2.4 (−2.5) the expected limit at 90% confidence
level (c.l.) for the considered data sample corresponds to Φ

expected detected signal.

5 Results

After the unblinding of the entire data sample, 3.7 events surviving cuts are
observed on average in the off-zone regions, while two are detected from the
Galactic Plane region. The distributions of the number of selected events in
the on-zone and off-zone regions as a function of the reconstructed energy
are reported in Figure 2.

A smaller number of events is observed in the signal region than the
expected background, and the Feldman and Cousins 90% c.l. upper bound

particular values of Γ. For each value of Γ, the one-flavour neutrino flux
from the considered region necessary to produce from 2 to 6 HESE is also
reported. The curves are computed on the basis of the effective areas re-
ported in [3] according to the prescription of [19]. All fluxes above the
horizontal black lines are excluded at 90% c.l. by ANTARES observation.
For instance, a flux with spectral index Γ = 2.5 that produces 3 or more
HESE in the signal region of ∆Ω = 0.145 sr is excluded. For the conven-

with expectations from models. The simple extrapolation [28] to IceCube
energies of the diffuse γ-ray flux measured by Fermi-LAT [23] is excluded
at 90% confidence level, assuming flavour equipartition. Models (KRAγ ,
Figure 4) that consider a harder CR spectrum in the inner Galaxy, and the

11



hardening of the CR spectrum measured by PAMELA and AMS-02 [12],
yield a neutrino flux (at 100 TeV) of a factor of two to three lower. Models
not including the CR hardening (KRA, Figure 4) yield neutrino fluxes one
order of magnitude smaller than that of the extrapolation from Fermi-LAT.

6 Conclusions and outlook

An enhanced neutrino production from the central part of the Galactic Plane
has been searched for using track-like events observed by the ANTARES tele-
scope from 2007 to 2013. No excess of events has been observed, and limits
on the contribution from this possible source to the astrophysical neutrino
signal observed by IceCube have been set as a function of spectral index.
For a neutrino flux ∝E−2.5 we exclude at 90% c.l. that 3 or more events
from the 3 year IceCube HESE sample are originating from this region. The
extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT γ-ray measurement to the IceCube neutrino
flux in the Galactic Plane area has also been constrained.

Data taking of the ANTARES neutrino telescope will continue at least
up to the end of 2016, increasing the νµ statistics available for this analysis.
In addition, a new reconstruction procedure for showering events has been
developed, with an angular resolution of 3-4 degrees in the TeV-PeV range
[41], which can be used to enhance the sensitivity for point-like sources and
diffuse emission from small regions of the sky. Preliminary results indicate
that using reconstructed cascades, the sensitivity to point sources with Γ=2
spectrum improves by about 30%. This suggests that at the end of data
taking the sensitivity of ANTARES will reach a level close to the prediction
of the model that includes a CR spectral hardening (KRAγ) [12].

Figure 4: ANTARES upper limit (magenta line) on the neutrino flux from
the Galactic Plane region (|`| < 40◦, |b| < 3◦) compared to expectations as
computed in [12], assuming a CR cut-off at 5×107 GeV, both with (KRAγ)
and without (KRA) spectral hardening. The neutrino flux (dot-dashed line)
extrapolated from the Fermi-LAT diffuse γ flux adapted from [28] up to
IceCube energies is shown. The implied flux from the three events from the
IceCube 3 years sample [4] is shown as black triangles.
