Abstract

Muons created by νµ charged current (CC) interactions in the water surrounding
the ANTARES neutrino telescope have been almost exclusively used so far in
searches for cosmic neutrino sources. Due to their long range, highly energetic
muons inducing Cherenkov radiation in the water are reconstructed with dedi-
cated algorithms that allow the determination of the parent neutrino direction
with a median angular resolution of about 0.4◦ for an E−2 neutrino spectrum.
In this paper, an algorithm optimised for accurate reconstruction of energy and
direction of shower events in the ANTARES detector is presented. Hadronic

2



showers of electrically charged particles are produced by the disintegration of
the nucleus both in CC and neutral current (NC) interactions of neutrinos in
water. In addition, electromagnetic showers result from the CC interactions of
electron neutrinos while the decay of a tau lepton produced in ντ CC interac-
tions will in most cases lead to either a hadronic or an electromagnetic shower.
A shower can be approximated as a point source of photons. With the presented
method, the shower position is reconstructed with a precision of about 1m; the
neutrino direction is reconstructed with a median angular resolution between
2◦ and 3◦ in the energy range of 1TeV to 1000TeV. In this energy interval,
the uncertainty on the reconstructed neutrino energy is about 5% to 10%. The
increase in the detector sensitivity due to the use of additional information from
shower events in the searches for a cosmic neutrino flux is also presented.

1. Introduction

ANTARES [1] is the world’s first deep sea neutrino telescope. The first
detector elements were deployed in March 2006 and data taking started soon
after. The construction was completed by mid-2008. Until recently, only muons
created by muon neutrino charged current (νµ CC) interactions in the water
that surrounds the detector or in the rock beneath it have been used in searches
for cosmic neutrino sources. Highly energetic muons induce Cherenkov radiation
in the water at a characteristic angle of ϑCh ≈ 42◦, which gets recorded by the
detector’s optical modules. The charge and timing information of the photon-
detections – referred to as hits – are used to reconstruct the direction of the
parent neutrino with a median angular resolution of ξtrack ≈ 0.4◦ for an E−2
spectrum [2]. However, muon tracks constitute only a part of the possible event
signatures of astrophysical neutrinos. Charged current interactions of electron
neutrinos (νe CC) create a shower of electrically charged particles. All neutrino
flavours can interact through neutral current (NC). In these interactions, only
a small fraction of the neutrino energy is transferred to a hadronic shower.
The residual energy is carried away by the neutrino. Furthermore, tau leptons
produced in ντ CC interactions decay with a branching ratio of 17% into the
muon channel, 65% into a hadronic and 18% into an electromagnetic shower.

Due to neutrino oscillation, the cosmic neutrino flux measured at Earth
should constitute a flavour ratio around Φνe : Φνµ : Φντ = 1 : 1 : 1 [3]. Espe-
cially in the light of the recent discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by the
IceCube experiment, where shower events provided the majority of the neutrino
candidates [4], it becomes much more important to increase the sensitivity to
channels that produce particle showers. A major advantage of showers com-
pared to muon tracks is their inherently low background: The main background
for neutrino telescopes is comprised of tracks by atmospheric muons which are
topologically different from showers. Misidentified muons and electron neutrinos
produced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere present the main background
in the shower channel. The rate at which electron neutrinos are produced in the

3



atmosphere at the energy of interest of neutrino telescopes (1TeV to 1000TeV)
is more than a factor of 10 less compared to atmospheric muon neutrinos.

High-energy muons can travel straight for several kilometres through the
rock and water surrounding the detector. Showers, on the other hand, de-
posit all their energy within a few metres from their interaction vertex. For
ANTARES they can be approximated as a point source that emits light in all
directions, though with more intensity at the Cherenkov angle with respect to
the direction of the parent neutrino. An early reconstruction method for show-
ers has been already used for the search of a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos [5].
However, the method provided insufficient angular accuracy for point-source
searches compared to the sensitivity level reached using track events.

In this paper, an algorithm optimised for accurate reconstruction of energy
and direction of shower events in the ANTARES detector (section 2) is pre-
sented. The reconstruction of the shower position is described in section 3,
while the directional and energy reconstruction and accuracy are presented in
section 4. The performances of the method are discussed in section 5. The re-
sults (section 6) justify adding the selected shower events to a combined search
for neutrino point-sources, as summarised in section 7.

2. The ANTARES detector

The ANTARES neutrino telescope is located in the Mediterranean Sea 40 km
off the coast of Toulon, France, at 42◦ 48′ N, 6◦ 10′ E. The detector comprises
12 vertical lines anchored at a depth of about 2475m and spaced such that
for each line, the closest neighbouring line is located at a distance between
about 60m. Each line is formed by a chain of 25 storeys with an inter-storey
distance of 14.5m. Every storey holds 3 optical modules (OMs) housing a single
10′′ photomultiplier tube (PMT) looking downward at an angle of 45◦. The
read-out achieves relative time-stamping precision of a nanosecond between the
OMs [6, 7]. At the ANTARES site, the transparency and transmission properties
of the sea water [8] allow for an excellent timing measurement of the Cherenkov
light induced by relativistic charged particles.

The ANTARES detector has been built in the deep-sea where all daylight is
blocked. However, it is not completely dark in these depths. Seawater contains
the radioactive isotope 40K which decays emitting a relativistic electron. This
process produces in each of the ANTARES PMTs a continuous, ubiquitous
background of around 40 kHz[9]. Additionally, microscopic life forms (mostly
bacteria and plankton) are emitting their own light. This effect is called biolu-
minescence and contributes to the almost constant baseline rate and also occurs
localised in short bursts of a few seconds. These bursts can cause count rates
of several megahertz.

To estimate the reconstruction performance and develop event selection cri-
teria, Monte Carlo simulations of the different signal and background channels
are employed. Atmospheric muons are simulated using the MUPAGE pack-
age [10, 11], whereas neutrinos are simulated with the GENHEN event gener-
ator [12]. The same sample of simulated events is used for atmospheric and

4



astrophysical neutrinos with an event-by-event weight to reflect the correspond-
ing neutrino fluxes. For the atmospheric component, the flux estimate from the
Bartol group is used [13]. The light propagation and the number of photons
arriving on the PMTs is simulated using the KM3 programme [14, 15] and the
optical background is extracted directly from the data following a run-by-run
approach [16].

The longitudinal development of an electromagnetic shower is a well-under-
stood process governed by the high-energy part of the shower. As described in
section 33 of [17], the mean longitudinal profile of the energy deposition in an
electromagnetic shower is reasonably well described by an analytic distribution.
This function is expressed in terms of the scale variable t = x/X0, in which
the propagated distance is measured in units of radiation length X0 (X0 ≈
36 g cm−2 for water). The shape of this distribution was reproduced by our
Monte Carlo simulations of electrons in water. The maximum of the shower
lies between about 0.6m (at 1GeV) and 7m (at 100PeV) from the interaction
vertex. Compared to the distances between the OMs in the detector, even the
most energetic showers are compact enough to be approximated by a point-
source of light. Since most charged particles created in the shower propagate
roughly towards the original neutrino direction, most of the photons are still
emitted under the Cherenkov angle ϑCh with respect to the parent neutrino
direction. This anisotropy in the number of emitted photons will be exploited
to reconstruct the direction of the shower and thereby to approximate the parent
neutrino direction as described in section 4.

3. Position reconstruction

A proper hit selection is crucial to filter out unwanted background hits caused
by the decay of 40K and bioluminescence. For the reconstruction of the shower
position, the subset of hits with the biggest total charge and causally compatible
with a common source of emission, is identified. Every pair of hits i, j has to
fulfil the following causality criterion:

|~ri − ~rj | ≥ cw · |ti − tj | , (1)

with:
~ri, the position of the PMT that recorded hit i,
ti, the time at which hit i was recorded and
cw, the speed of light in water.

To understand equation 1, imagine the position ~rshower exactly between two
PMTs i and j. Their ∆r = |~ri − ~rj | can be arbitrarily high but ∆t = |ti − tj |
is exactly zero. For a generic position ~rshower and two PMTs close together (∆r
about 0), they have to record their hits at the same time, and thus cw ·∆t must
be small as well. Thus, the time difference between two neighbouring PMTs
cannot be arbitrarily high if they see the same shower, but the time difference
between two arbitrarily distant hits can be zero. Under the above condition,

5



this common origin of emission – i.e. the shower position ~rshower and time tshower
– can be determined assuming the following system of quadratic equations:

(~ri − ~rshower)2 = c2w · (ti − tshower)2, (2)

with 1 ≤ i ≤ N , where N is the number of selected hits. The system of equations
is linearised by taking the difference between every pair of equations i and j:

(~ri − ~rj) · ~rshower − (ti − tj) · tshower c2w = 12 [|~ri|
2 − |~rj |2 − c2w(t2i − t2j)] (3)

for all i, j : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N . The resulting system of linear equations can be
written as:

A~v = ~b, (4)

with:
~v = (~rshower, tshower), the four-dimensional space-time vector of the shower

position,

The matrix A has M = N ·(N−1)/2 rows, therefore equation (4) represents
an over-constrained system of M equations that can be solved by the method
of linear least square fit:

~vl.s. = (A
T
A)−1AT~b. (5)

A subsequent fit is performed using a robust estimator with the previous fit
as starting point and minimising the so called M-estimator, a modified χ2-like
quantity, defined as:

MEst =

∑

i=1

)

, (6)

with qi, the charge of hit i and

tres i = ti − tshower − |~ri − ~rshower| /cw, (7)

6



the time residual of hit i.

Like the χ2 function, MEst behaves quadratically for small values of tres but
becomes asymptotically linear for larger values. Consequently, it is less sensitive
to outliers. The minimisation is performed by the TMinuit2 class within the
ROOT framework [18].

4. Direction and energy reconstruction

The procedure that determines the shower direction (direction fit) makes use
of a second dedicated hit selection performed on the full set of hits in the event.
In particular, the charges of all hits on a given PMT in a time residual window
of −200 < tres/ns < 500 with respect to the already performed position fit are
summed up to yield qi.

A likelihood function is defined to describe the probability P (qi) that a
hypothetical neutrino ν with energy Eν , direction ~pν and creating a shower
at position ~rshower causes hits with a total measured charge qi on a PMT i.
The measured charge is compared to the expectation value of the number of
photons on this PMT for such a shower. This expectation value depends on the
neutrino energy Eν , the distance di of the OM to the nominal shower position,
the photon emission angle φi from the neutrino direction and its incident angle
αi on the PMT photocathode1. A schematic overview of the geometric variables
that enter this signal part of the likelihood function is given in figure 1. The
likelihood also takes into consideration that the hit could be caused by ambient
background and evaluates the probability that a background event causes a
charge as observed on the PMT (Pbg(qi)). The PMTs that did not record any
hits which passed the hit selection are also taken into account (P (qi = 0)).

1Note that in case of scattering, a Cherenkov photon does not travel along the shortest
connection between the shower position and the OM, which defines the distance di (cf. fig-
ure 1). The angles φi and αi are defined w.r.t. the shortest connection, irrespective of the
actual path of a scattered photon.

∑

log {P (qi = 0|Eν , di, φi, αi)} , (8)

with N , the number of PMTs with hits, N ′, the number of PMTs with no hits.

4.1. The signal term – P (qi|Eν , di, φi, αi)
The signal term of the likelihood function is determined from a three-dimen-

sional table obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. It contains, for a given
distance between shower and OM di, photon-emission angle φi and photon-
impact angle αi, the expectation value of the number of photons on this PMT
for a 1TeV neutrino: N0(di, φi, αi). The number of emitted photons – and,
therefore, the number Ni of expected photons on the PMT – is proportional to
the neutrino energy. For energies different from 1TeV, the number of photons
is scaled accordingly:

Ni = N (Eν , di, φi, αi) = N0(di, φi, αi)× Eν/1TeV. (9)

The probability to detect n photons when N are expected is given by the
Poisson distribution:

P (n|N ) = N
n

n!
e−N . (10)

To first order, the chargeQ expected to be measured by an ideal PMT is assumed
to be proportional to the number of photons n detected by the PMT:

Q = n× pe, (11)

with pe (or photo-electron), the average charge measured by the PMT caused
by a single photon. However, this number of photons n cannot be measured
with absolute precision. In reality, the measured PMT charge q is affected by
an uncertainty in form of a Gaussian centred around the expected charge Q
with width proportional to

√
n. For simplicity, this smearing of the charge is

approximated by a continuous extension of the Poisson formula that uses the
Gamma function Γ, defined for real numbers q′ = q/pe:

P (q′|N ) = N
q
′

Γ(q′ − 1)
e−N . (12)

Moreover, the read-out electronics saturates at charges above about 20 pe pre-
venting the proper determination of the number of arriving photons for large
signals. For this reason, to obtain a reasonable probability for the measured
charge, measured charges and expected charges above 20 pe are treated as be-
ing at 20pe.

8



4.2. The non-hit term – P (qi = 0|Eν , di, φi, αi)
The probability to have a non-hit PMT i is simply the Poisson probability

to have zero charge while expecting Ni photons to arrive on the photocathode:

P (qi = 0|Eν , di, φi, αi) = P (qi = 0|Ni) = e−Ni . (13)

4.3. The background term – Pbg(qi)

The background term gives the probability that one of the uncorrelated
background sources – explained in section 2 – causes the observed charge qi.
Figure 2 shows the unbiased distribution of the charge caused by environmental
and atmospheric background. The average value for the shown distribution is
Qbg = 1.1 pe.

4.4. Implementation

The energy and direction fit is performed with the TMinuit2 class as well.
The probability density function (PDF) used in the fit is provided as a table
with discrete bins. The minimiser algorithms require the likelihood function to
have well defined derivative at each point. Therefore, the PDF is interpolated
with the method of trilinear interpolation. In order to find the global minimum
and avoid possible local minima in the likelihood landscape, the energy-direction
fit has been performed with 12 different starting directions, corresponding to
the directions of the corners of an icosahedron (as seen from its centre). In the
end, the fit with the maximum likelihood value is selected as the final energy-
direction estimate.

4.5. Error estimator

The direction fit also provides an angular error estimate βshower on the fit di-
rection. After the best direction has been determined, the likelihood landscape
around the fit is scanned along concentric circles of angular distances iteratively
increasing in one-degree steps. The largest angular distance for which the differ-
ence between the likelihood value of any of the test directions and of the best-fit
value is still smaller than 1 is used as the angular error estimate βshower.

5. Reconstruction performance

The performance of the reconstruction algorithm is evaluated applying it to
contained events for which the simulated neutrino interaction vertex lies inside
the instrumented detector volume (horizontal distance from the detector centre
ρMC < 90m and vertical distance from the detector centre |zMC| < 200m). A
cut on the angular error estimator was applied as well (βshower < 10◦).

5.1. Position reconstruction

Since the reconstruction assumes one common point of emission for all pho-
tons, it will most likely reconstruct a position along the shower axis and not the
actual neutrino interaction vertex. Instead, the shower position corresponds to
the intensity weighted mean position of the light emission spectrum for electro-
magnetic showers as parametrised in reference [17]. Figure 3 shows the longi-
tudinal and perpendicular offset of the shower position fit with respect to the
simulated neutrino interaction vertex. For νe CC and NC induced showers,
the reconstructed position along the shower axis agrees well with the expected
offset from the electromagnetic shower parametrisation. The median perpen-
dicular distance to the neutrino axis is of the order of half a metre for both
charged and neutral current events over a wide energy range.

◦). The purple line indicates the expected lon-
gitudinal offset from the neutrino interaction vertex for electromagnetic
showers. The error bars show the 68% spread of the distribution in each
energy bin.

5.2. Direction reconstruction

The shower angular resolution is defined as the median angle ξshower between
the simulated neutrino and the reconstructed shower directions. As shown in

figure 4 (left), for contained events and energies in the range 1 . Eν/TeV . 103

it reaches values as low as 2.3◦ with 16% of the events below 1◦. For neutrino
energies below 1TeV, there is not enough light produced to illuminate a suffi-
cient number of PMTs for a proper reconstruction. Above Eν ≈ 103TeV, the
read-out electronics is starting to saturate and the limited size of the ANTARES
detector prevents accessing higher energies with proper resolutions.

Since only a small fraction of the neutrino energy is transferred to the nu-
cleus in NC interactions, a hadronic shower created by a high-energy neutrino
has correspondingly less energy than an electromagnetic shower created by an
electron neutrino of the same energy in a CC interaction. For this reason, the
angular resolution for hadronic showers above 103TeV does not deteriorate as
quickly with increasing neutrino energy as for electromagnetic showers.

Right: Median ratio of the reconstructed energy and the Monte Carlo

(blue) showers after the containment and angular error cuts (ρMC < 90m,
|zMC| < 200m, βshower < 10

◦). The error bars show the 68% spread of the
distribution in each energy bin.

5.3. Energy

As shown in figure 4 (right), a statistical resolution of the shower energy
(which is equal to the neutrino energy only for νe CC events) of 5% to 10% has
been achieved. A systematic underestimation of about 20% in the reconstructed
energy can be observed over the whole energy range. This effect is corrected
by unfolding the reconstructed energy with the right plot of figure 4 so that
the median ratio between reconstructed and true Monte Carlo shower energy
is flat at 1 (see figure 5). This energy correction focuses entirely on νe CC
events and does not produce a reliable energy estimate for the neutrino energy
in NC events. The systematic effect of the energy estimation on a combined set

11



comprising NC and νe CC events can be accounted for in the specific analyses
using this method.

5.4. Angular resolution measured in data

The angular resolution of the shower reconstruction can also be measured
directly in data using a sample of atmospheric muons. Muons can induce electro-
magnetic showers through stochastic energy loss processes. These muon-induced
showers will have approximately the same direction as the muon. As the muon
is accurately reconstructed by the track fit, a sample of electromagnetic show-
ers of known direction can be isolated and the reconstructed shower direction
compared to the direction of the reconstructed muon track. Figure 6 shows the
result for a loose selection (i.e. containment, M-estimator, error estimator and
GridFit ratio [19] as explained in the next section and shown in table 1). A
clear population of well reconstructed showers is visible, with a resolution of
two to three degrees (maximum of the distribution). This peak is well modelled
in simulations of atmospheric muons, which implies that the Monte Carlo can
be reliably used to determine the resolution for showers of cosmic origin. A
cut of 5◦ on the angle between the directions of the simulated and the recon-
structed muon has been applied to ensure that the peak is populated with truly
well-reconstructed events.

6. Event selection and data – Monte Carlo comparison

The discrimination of the showers produced by astrophysical neutrinos from
the showers produced by the background of atmospheric muons and neutri-
nos is a challenging task. The main limitation is the worse angular resolution
compared to muon tracks [2] and the fact that muons can also induce electro-
magnetic showers along their track. The advantage is the much better energy
resolution.

In the following, the performances of the algorithm to discriminate cosmic
showers from the atmospheric background using Monte Carlo observable vari-
ables is described. The cosmic signal is characterised by a power law function

of the energy with a harder spectral index. The results obtained in this section
are only illustrative of the methods and can be adapted according to the specific
requirements of different analyses. In particular, the results of a first all-flavour
neutrino point-like source search using nine years of the ANTARES data are
already public [20]. The focus in the following is mainly on the reduction of the
atmospheric muon contamination, while maintaining the largest fraction of the
cosmic signal. In particular, the exact cut values have not been optimised (e.g.
for best sensitivity or discovery potential in the point-source search).

The effect of the cuts on different Monte Carlo samples are presented in
table 1. The first two columns indicate the name and the value of the applied
condition. Two of them are already presented: the “up-going” condition requires
that showers are reconstructed with cos(ϑshower) > −0.1; the “error estimate”
requires that the angular error estimate is βshower < 10◦. The other criteria
are described in the following. The effect on the atmospheric muon sample is
presented in column 3 (ǫatmµ ); that on the atmospheric neutrinos (either yielding
a shower or a muon) in column 4 (ǫatmν→any). The effect on a flux of cosmic
neutrinos with spectrum E−2 yielding showers of muons simulating a shower are
presented in column 5 (ǫE

−2

ν→shower) and 6 (ǫ
E

−2

ν→µ), respectively. After applying
these selection criteria to the ANTARES data set with an effective life time
of 1690 days, 172 shower events remain. Below, the description of the other
criteria applied to reduce the background is presented.

Containment+M-Estimator Reconstructing atmospheric muons with a
shower algorithm often produces “shower positions” that lie far away from
the detector boundary and have a largeMEst value (equation (6)). A rough
selection on position and reconstruction quality reduces the amount of
background by 70% already before the direction fit. The quantity ρshower
is the horizontal distance of the reconstructed shower position from the
detector’s centre and zshower is the vertical height above the detector’s
centre.

Track Veto To avoid an overlap between the track and shower samples, events
that pass the muon track selection are excluded from the shower channel.

13



GridFit Ratio The GridFit algorithm was developed for another, recent anal-
ysis [19]. It is used here to suppress down-going muon events. In a first
step, it segments the full solid angle in 500 directions. For each direction,
the number of hits compatible with a muon track from this direction is
determined. The GridFit ratio RGF is the ratio between the sum of the
compatible hits NGFR for all up-going and all down-going test directions:

RGF =
∑

up
NGFR

∑
down

NGFR
. A lower value, therefore, means a higher likelihood of

this event to be a down-going muon. A selection criterion combining the
GridFit ratio and the number of selected shower hits (see figure 7) was
devised to further suppress the atmospheric muon background.

Likelihood Muon Veto In order to improve the discrimination between cos-
mic showers and atmospheric muons, a dedicated likelihood function has
been developed. This likelihood considers only hits that coincide with
another hit on the same storey within 20 ns and its PDF is based on the
following parameters:

• time residual tres (equation 7) of the hits w.r.t. the reconstructed
shower position,

• number N of on-time hits (−20 < tres/ns < 60) and
• distance d of the hits to the reconstructed shower position.

The Likelihood is given by the following equation:

LµVeto =
∑

hits

[

log{Pshower/Pmuon}+ Pshower − Pmuon
]

, (14)

with Pshower = P (N, d, tres|shower) and Pmuon = P (N, d, tres|muon).
These PDFs are based on the same Monte Carlo simulations mentioned
in section 2 with an energy spectrum proportional to E−2 for the cosmic
neutrinos that induce the showers. The likelihood function shown in equa-
tion (14) was developed to achieve an optimal separation of the shower
and muon distributions. This likelihood parameter can be combined with
the zenith angle, reconstructed by the established muon-track fitting algo-
rithm [2]: On events that have been reconstructed as down-going a harder
likelihood ratio cut can be applied. The distribution for this quantity plot-
ted before and after the combined cut is shown in figure 8. This method
further reduces the number of atmospheric muons by more than one order
of magnitude. Even so, the majority of the remaining events consists still
of misreconstructed atmospheric muons.

Charge Ratio When the shower fit reconstructs a position along the muon
track, one would expect photons induced by the muon to also arrive earlier
than predicted by a point source hypothesis. Thus, the charge ratio be-
tween the “early” and “on-time” hits was investigated. The distribution of
the ratio of those two charge-sums is shown in figure 9. Here, Qearly is the
summed charge of all hits with a time residual of −1000 ≤ tres/ns ≤ −40

charge of all hits with time residuals of −30 ≤ tres/ns ≤ 1000.

After reducing the amount of atmospheric muons by six orders of magnitude,
just before the charge-ratio cut (see figure 9), the Monte Carlo simulations of
atmospheric muons do no longer well describe the data in the right part of the
plot. The discrepancy lies well out of the acceptance region wherein the data
agrees with the simulation of atmospheric neutrino events.

The event selection does not only reject unwanted background events but also
poorly reconstructed signal events. The direction resolution improves slightly
compared to what is shown in figure 4, particularly in the lower energy region.

efficiency after each step for atmospheric muons and neutrinos and cosmic
neutrinos creating a shower in the detector. The efficiencies are defined
as the ratio of the number of events that passed a cut and the number of

7. Conclusion

An algorithm to reconstruct underwater particle showers has been developed.
It makes use of the fact that the highly energetic, electrically charged particles
induce Cherenkov radiation mainly under one specific angle with respect to the
direction of the parent neutrino and that this emission profile is preserved over
large distances due to the good optical properties of the deep-sea water. The
showers can be approximated as point sources of photons which emit their light
at one given time. The shower position is reconstructed with a precision of
about 1m and for the neutrino direction resolutions of 2◦ to 3◦ are achieved. A
statistical uncertainty for the shower energy of about 5% to 10% is obtained.

Despite their much more compact event signature, the shower algorithm’s
angular resolution is only about a factor of five worse than that of the muon
channel. Combined with their inherently low background, shower events will
prove very valuable in the search for point-like and extended neutrino sources.
Our studies [20] showed that the shower channel contributes about 23 % of all
signal events for an E−2 energy spectrum corresponding to an increase of the
point-source sensitivity of about 10%. The sensitivity of the shower channel to
the ANTARES searches for a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos is almost equivalent
to that of the muon channel [5, 21], due to the better energy estimate and the
lower atmospheric background.
