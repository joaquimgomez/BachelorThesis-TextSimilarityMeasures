Abstract

The flux of very high-energy neutrinos produced in our Galaxy by the interaction of accelerated cosmic rays with
the interstellar medium is not yet determined. The characterization of this flux will shed light on Galactic accelerator
features, gas distribution morphology and Galactic cosmic ray transport. The central Galactic plane can be the site of
an enhanced neutrino production, thus leading to anisotropies in the extraterrestrial neutrino signal as measured by
the IceCube Collaboration. The ANTARES neutrino telescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea, offers a favourable
view on this part of the sky, thereby allowing for a contribution to the determination of this flux. The expected diffuse
Galactic neutrino emission can be obtained linking a model of generation and propagation of cosmic rays with the
morphology of the gas distribution in the Milky Way. In this paper, the so-called “Gamma model” introduced recently
to explain the high-energy gamma ray diffuse Galactic emission, is assumed as reference. The neutrino flux predicted by
the “Gamma model” depends of the assumed primary cosmic ray spectrum cut-off. Considering a radially-dependent
diffusion coefficient, this proposed scenario is able to account for the local cosmic ray measurements, as well as for
the Galactic gamma ray observations. Nine years of ANTARES data are used in this work to search for a possible
Galactic contribution according to this scenario. All flavour neutrino interactions are considered. No excess of events
is observed and an upper limit is set on the neutrino flux of 1.1 (1.2) times the prediction of the “Gamma model”
assuming the primary cosmic ray spectrum cut-off at 5 (50) PeV. This limit excludes the diffuse Galactic neutrino
emission as the major cause of the “spectral anomaly” between the two hemispheres measured by IceCube.

1 Introduction

The Fermi-LAT telescope obtained detailed measurements
of diffuse high-energy gamma ray emission along the
Galactic plane after the subtraction of point-like contribu-
tions [1]. Above a few GeV most of this observed diffuse
emission can be attributed to photons produced in neu-
tral pion decays coming from primary cosmic ray (CR)
interactions with the ambient medium (dust, molecular
clouds, etc). In these hadronic processes, a neutrino coun-
terpart emission is also expected from π+/− decays. The
good coverage of the Southern Hemisphere, as well as its
large effective area and good angular resolution, allows the
ANTARES neutrino telescope to probe models for this ex-
pected flux.

Detailed computations of the neutrino flux produced
in this context have been carried out. Using radially-
dependent CR diffusion properties, a novel comprehensive
interpretation of CR transport in our galaxy was used.
With this model the observed local CR features [2, 3, 4], as
well as the diffuse Galactic gamma ray emission measured
by Fermi-LAT [1], H.E.S.S. [5] and Milagro [6], can be re-
produced. The new model, developed under this scenario,
called “KRAγ” or “Gamma model” [7, 8, 9] is used in this
paper. It allows the prediction of the expected full sky
neutrino flux induced by Galactic CR interactions. Com-
pared to conventional scenarios where a homogeneous CR
transport is assumed for the whole Galactic plane [10],
an enhanced neutrino emission up to five times larger in
its central part is predicted [11]. The spectrum of pri-
mary interacting CRs of the “Gamma model” presents a
hardening around 250 GeV per nucleon as observed by
PAMELA [3] and AMS-02 [4] experiments. Above this
energy, the CR source spectra extend steadily up to an
exponential cut-off on the energy per nucleon Ecut. Two
representative values of this quantity have been consid-
ered, namely Ecut = 5 and 50 PeV, which – for the
“Gamma model” setup – match CREAM proton and he-
lium data [12] and roughly reproduce KASCADE [13] and
KASCADE Grande data [2]. While the KASCADE pro-
ton data favor the lowest cut-off (5 PeV), the highest one
(50 PeV) is favored by the KASCADE-Grande all-particle
spectrum.

The two different cut-off cases of the “Gamma model”
will be referred to as the two “reference models” in this
article. The morphological and energetic characteristics
of the neutrino fluxes computed from these models are
obtained by linking the DRAGON code [14] for Galactic
CR transport, using the gas 3D distribution described in
Ref. [15] for Galactocentric radii R < 1.5 kpc, and the gas
ring model used by the Fermi collaboration [1] for larger
radii.

In the last few years, the IceCube Collaboration has re-
ported a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos with
respect to the expected atmospheric background [16, 17,
18]. The spectral energy distribution obtained with 4 years
of “high-energy starting events” (HESE) through a full
sky analysis results in a one flavour normalisation factor
E2Φ(E) = 2.2(±0.7)·(E/100 TeV)−0.58×10−8 GeV cm−2

s−1 sr−1 with a fitted spectral index α = 2.58± 0.25 [17].
Nevertheless, a dedicated analysis with 6 years of muonic
neutrinos from the Northern Hemisphere shows a normal-
isation factor of E2Φ(E) = 0.90+0.3−0.27 · (E/100 TeV)−0.13×
10−8 GeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1 and a spectral index α =
2.13±0.13 [19] generating a non-negligible discrepancy be-
tween the measured neutrino spectral energy distributions
of the two hemispheres, the so-called “spectral anomaly”.

Different explanations have been put forth for the ten-
sion in the normalisation versus spectral index between
the two contributions leading to a relative enhanced emis-
sion in the Southern Hemisphere. One of them is a cut-off
in the spectrum as these two analyses have a different en-
ergy threshold. Another one comes from the position of
the Milky Way. As its central region is at negative declina-
tions, the sum of a Galactic and an extragalactic compo-
nent [20, 21] can result in different spectral behaviours in
the two hemispheres. From a statistical point of view, 50%
of the observed IceCube cosmic neutrino signal events are
compatible with a Galactic plane origin [22]. Conversely,
when considering the reference model with 50 PeV cut-off,
it is possible to account for a maximum of 18% of the full
sky HESE flux measured by IceCube, while in the con-
ventional scenario, only 8% of this flux can be related to
Galactic diffuse emission [7].

The ANTARES view of the Southern Sky, its exposure
towards the Galactic centre region and its very good an-
gular resolution makes it well suited to either detect the
neutrino flux predicted by the reference models over sev-
eral decades in energy, or place competitive upper limits
on the flux normalisation. In order to fully exploit the
particular morphology of the expected signal, as well as
the angular dependency of the energy spectrum, a maxi-
mum likelihood analysis is performed assuming the signal
events have the angular and energy distributions obtained
from the reference models. With this technique, a new
stringent upper limit is obtained on the neutrino flux over
three decades in energy based on 9 years of data taking.

The paper is structured as follows: A description of
the detector and the dataset is provided, followed by a
description of the maximum likelihood analysis and then
a discussion on the results. A very important consequence
of this paper is the strong disfavour of the diffuse Galactic
emission as the origin of the spectral anomaly observed
by IceCube.

2 The ANTARES detector and
data sample

The ANTARES neutrino telescope [23] is installed at
2475 m depth in the Mediterranean sea, 40 km off the coast
of Toulon, France. It is made of an array of photomulti-
pliers, which detect Cherenkov light induced by particles
created during high energy neutrino interactions. Two
detection channels are available for neutrinos above a few
tens of GeV: charged current interactions of muon neutri-
nos, with the subsequent Cherenkov emission by the out-

3



going muon, which constitute most of the so-called “track
events”. All other interactions, which produce electromag-
netic or hadronic showers in the detector, representing the
so-called “shower events”. For the former, the sub-degree
angular resolution and an energy accuracy of the order of
a fraction of a decade can be obtained; they benefit from
the kilometer-scale muon track length to enlarge the effec-
tive detection volume thereby increasing the event rates.
The latter type of events has an angular accuracy of a few
degrees, but an energy resolution of 10%; these perfor-
mances are achievable only in a smaller effective detection
volume, thus reducing the neutrino effective area.

A Monte Carlo simulation of electron and muon neutri-
nos and antineutrinos has been used in this analysis. The
contribution of tau neutrinos has been estimated by scal-
ing up in a consistent manner the number of electron and
muon neutrinos. The data used in this search was recorded
between the 29th of January 2007 and the 31st of Decem-
ber 2015 for a total livetime of 2423.6 days. Monte Carlo
simulations reproduce the time variability of the detector
conditions according to a “run-by-run” approach [24].

The background consists of atmospheric neutrinos and
downward-going muons created by CR-induced atmo-
spheric air showers. While atmospheric neutrinos cannot
be distinguished on an event-by-event basis from cosmic
neutrinos, the event selection aims at suppressing events
from downward-going muons by selecting events recon-
structed as upward-going. This procedure follows the
same steps as the one used for the search of point-like
sources in Ref. [25]. The selection of events in this analy-
sis maximizes the discovery power (defined in section 3) of
the flux predicted by the reference model with the 50 PeV
cut-off when using the search method described below.

An event is selected as track-like if it is reconstructed
by the tracking algorithm [26] as upward-going and if
it passes the selection cuts defined in the searches for
point-like neutrino sources [27]. This rejects most of
the background from CR-induced atmospheric muons.
Shower-like events are selected if they are not present
in the track sample and if the event is reconstructed
within a fiducial volume surrounding the apparatus with
high quality by the shower reconstruction algorithm [25].
These events must also be reconstructed as upward-going.
The dataset consists of 7300 tracks and 208 showers
events. The median angular resolution for tracks and
showers is 0.6◦ and 2.7◦ respectively, when considering
the reference model with the 5 PeV cut-off. For the
reference model with the 50 PeV cut-off, the median
angular resolution for tracks improves to 0.5◦ whereas the
one for showers does not change significantly.

3 Search Method

The analysis presented in this work is based on a likelihood
ratio test, widely used in neutrino astronomy, e.g. in the
search for neutrinos from individual point-like or extended
sources by ANTARES [28, 29, 30, 31]. It is adapted here

Figure 1: Probability density function of the reconstructed
direction of signal events MTsig, in equatorial coordinates
for shower-like (top) and track-like (bottom) events.

to a full-sky search where the signal map is built according
to the reference models mentioned above. A probability
density function of observables was defined according to
given expectations/models. Data are considered to be a
mixture of signal and background events, so the likelihood
function is defined as:

Lsig+bkg =
∏

T ∈{tr,sh}

∏
i∈T

[µTsig · pdfTsig(Ei, αi, δi)

+ µTbkg · pdfTbkg(Ei, θi, δi)]
(1)

where Ei is the reconstructed energy, αi and δi the right
ascension and declination (equatorial coordinates), and θi
the zenith angle of the event i. For each event topol-
ogy T (track or shower), given a total number of events
µTtot, the number of background events µ

T
bkg corresponds

to µTtot − µTsig. The number of signal events µTsig is fitted
by maximising the likelihood, allowing only non-negative
values. The signal and background probability density
functions of an event are defined as:

pdfTsig(Ei, αi, δi) =MTsig(αi, δi) · ETsig(Ei, αi, δi) (2)

pdfTbkg(Ei, θi, δi) =MTbkg(δi) · ETbkg(Ei, θi) (3)

whereMT are the probability density functions to recon-
struct an event in a given position in the sky. The proba-
bility density functionsMTsig, shown in Figure 1 (for the 5

4



PeV energy cut-off model) as obtained from Monte Carlo
simulation, depend on the differential neutrino fluxes pre-
dicted by the reference models folded with the detector
response to a given direction in the sky. The background
distribution MTbkg is obtained from the data, by scram-
bling the time of events which results in a randomisation
of the corresponding right ascension. This is a conserva-
tive estimate of the background. Moreover, provided that
the signal is weak enough (which is the case given the non
detection of a diffuse flux from the Galactic ridge [32]), this
procedure produces a background distribution which only
depends on the declination. This is due to the fact that
Earth’s rotation and uniform distribution of the time the
detector was operational imply a flat atmospheric back-
ground right ascension distribution. The parameter ET
is the probability density function of the reconstructed
energy. For the signal, ETsig depends on the equatorial co-
ordinates as the energy spectra of the reference models
depend on the position in the sky. The parameter ETbkg
depends on the corresponding local zenith θi to account
for potential reconstruction systematic effects due to the
detector response.

The test statistic Q is then defined as the logarithm of
the likelihood ratio:

Q = log10(Lsig+bkg)− log10(Lbkg) (4)

with Lbkg = Lsig+bkg(µshsig = µtrsig = 0).
The discovery power and sensitivity of the search are

computed by building the probability density functions
of the test statistic pdfΦ(Q) assuming different values of
the normalisation factor Φ of the reference model fluxes.
The discovery power is defined as the probability for a
given signal normalisation to yield a test statistic value
corresponding to a 3σ significance excess on top of the ex-
pected background. For a given value of the test statistic
Qobs compatible with background expectation, the 90%
upper limit will be defined as the highest signal normali-
sation which would yield a test statistic value above Qobs
90% of the time. The sensitivity of the search is then
defined as the average of the upper limits correspond-
ing to all possible Q values in the background hypoth-
esis (Φ = 0) weighted by their probabilities pdfΦ=0(Q).
Pseudo-experiments are thus produced, varying the num-
ber of signal events µsh+trsig accordingly. They are gener-

ated using the probability density functions MT and ET
defined above. A total of 105 pseudo-experiments are pro-
duced in the background case (µsh+trsig = 0) and 10

4 for

each value of µsh+trsig in the range [1,55] where the rate of
showers, taken from the Monte Carlo simulation, is ∼20%
of µsh+trsig . For each pseudo-experiment, the number of fit-

ted track (µtrfit) and shower (µ
sh
fit) events can be obtained.

The distribution of [µsh+trsig − (µtrfit + µshfit)] has a median
value close to zero and a standard deviation σ∗ = 13 for
the model with the 5 PeV cut-off and σ∗ = 12 with the
50 PeV cut-off. It is worth noticing that the value of σ∗

is related to the background fluctuation, which does not
change when varying the true number of signal events for a
given model. This means that, if the exposure increases by

a given factor, σ∗ increases less rapidly. The probability
density functions of Q for integer numbers of signal events

(Q) are obtained from pseudo-experiments. They
are linked to pdfΦ(Q), with Φ leading to a mean number
of detected signal events n, by:

pdfΦ(Q) =
∑
µ
sh+tr
sig

P (µsh+trsig |n) · pdfµsh+tr
sig

(Q) (5)

where P is the Poissonian probability distribution.
The systematic uncertainty on the acceptance of the

ANTARES photomultipliers implies an uncertainty of 15%
on the effective area [33]. To account for this, the number
of expected signal events n from a given flux is fluctuated
using a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of
15%. An uncertainty on the background distribution due
to statistical fluctuations in the data is also taken into
account by fluctuating MTbkg(δi).

The p-value for a given Q is defined as the probabil-
ity to measure a test statistic larger than this one in the
background-only case. It is given by the anti-cumulative
probability density function of Q with no injected signal
(Figure 2). Upper limits at a given confidence level are set
according to the corresponding distributions with injected
signal events.

For the model with the 5 PeV cut-off, 90% of signal
events are in the energy range [3.5 · 10−1,1.3 · 102] TeV
for track-like events and between [2.0,1.5 · 102] TeV for
shower-like events. For the 50 PeV cut-off, these energy
ranges are [4.0 · 10−1,2.3 · 102] TeV for the tracks and
[2.2,2.6 · 102] TeV for the showers. To avoid biasing the
analysis, the data have been blinded by time-scrambling.
Both the sensitivity and the discovery power of the
analysis are derived from this blinded dataset. The
sensitivity, defined as the average upper limit at 90%
confidence level, is 1.4 × Φ5ref when a cut-off for CR
primary protons at 5 PeV is set. A mean of µ∗ = 11.6

all neutrino flavours, as well as the previously published
ANTARES upper limit [32] (solid green line) and the 4
years of HESE reconstructed by IceCube (black triangles).
The diffuse gamma ray spectral energy distribution de-
rived from PASS8 Fermi-LAT data (red points) is also
presented here. These expectations and results concern
the inner Galactic plane region (|l| < 40◦ and |b| < 3◦).

signal events is expected from the model. It corresponds
to the sum of track-like and shower-like events, with
showers representing ∼20% of the total. The resulting
discovery power at 3σ confidence level is 7%. For the
model with a 50 PeV cut-off, the sensitivity is 1.05×Φ50ref
and µ∗ = 13.7 signal events are expected, resulting in a
discovery power of 14% for a 3σ confidence level.

4 Results

After unblinding, the test statistic of the data is computed.
The corresponding Q value is shown as the green line in
Figure 2. Table 1 presents the results for the two differ-
ent cut-off energies (column 1) considered by the models.
Column 2 reports the number of expected events, µ∗, and
column 3 the standard deviation of the distribution of the
number of fitted events, σ∗, which are defined in section 3.

For the data sample, the numbers of fitted track-like
events, µtrdata, and shower-like events, µ

sh
data, are reported

in columns 4 and 5, respectively. Their sum is smaller
than µ∗, but still compatible with the expected fluctua-
tions. These include the Gaussian fluctuations. due to
the background (which is within 1σ∗) and the Poissonian
fluctuations on the number of signal events.

Finally, using the anti-cumulative distribution of the
background test statistic, the p-value of the data – as
defined in section 3 – is computed and reported in col-
umn 6. The derived upper limits at 90% confidence level
on the reference models are reported in the last column of
Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the 90% confidence level upper limit of
this analysis that relies on the particular morphology and
energy spectrum of the reference model. The dotted blue
line refers to the reference model assuming a cut-off of 5
PeV for the primary protons, which produce neutrinos
when interacting with gas. Although full sky data were
used in this analysis, the expectations and the results
concerning the inner Galactic plane region (|l| < 40◦
and |b| < 3◦) are shown on this plot. This allows the
presented limit and the previous ANTARES constraint
on the neutrino emission [32] from the same region to
be compared. The diffuse gamma ray spectral energy
distribution derived from PASS8 Fermi-LAT data [34]
obtained after the subtraction of point-like components
comprised in this region is also shown for comparison.
And the red dashed line shows the predicted spectrum
from the conventional model with homogeneous CR
diffusion. The neutrino flux from the 4 year IceCube
HESE catalog for individual events with origin compatible
with this region is shown as black triangles. All flavour
neutrino fluxes are represented in this figure.

5 Conclusions

The study reported here is based on nine years of
ANTARES data collected from 2007 to 2015. It uses a like-

lihood ratio test to search for a diffuse Galactic-dominated
neutrino flux, characterised by the recently introduced
“Gamma model” used as reference model. As a result, a
neutrino flux with normalisation factor of 1.1×Φ5ref (resp.
1.2 × Φ50ref) is excluded at 90% confidence level when the
model with the 5 PeV cut-off (resp. 50 PeV) is considered.

Using neutrinos of all flavours as well as a larger amount
of data leads to an improvement in the sensitivity and
more stringent upper limits with respect to the previous
ANTARES analysis [32]. The new upper limits do not
extend above ∼200 TeV due to the significant softening
of the spectrum. The additional gain in sensitivity below
3 TeV with respect to the previous analysis results from
the usage of a new unbinned method that uses spatial and
energy information. At low energies, the limit obtained
from this analysis reaches almost the high-energy tail of
the Fermi-LAT sensitivity.

Noticing the enhanced Galactic hadronic emission pre-
dicted by the reference models with respect to a conven-
tional scenario, the obtained limits represent a strong con-
straint on a possible diffuse neutrino emission from the
Galactic plane.

Considering the flux upper limit with 90% confidence
level shown in Table 1 for the 50 PeV cut-off, at most 18%
of the cosmic neutrino events measured by IceCube with
the HESE dataset can originate from diffuse Galactic CR
interaction. This corresponds to about 5.2 out of the
28.6 HESE with energy above 60 TeV expected to be
cosmic neutrinos, as reported in Ref. [35]. This limit is
more restrictive than that allowed in Ref. [20, 22]. The
reference model produces a larger North/South asymme-
try than the conventional scenario: more than ∼80% of
the events are expected from the Southern hemisphere.
Nevertheless, the contribution of the diffuse Galactic
component to the difference between the observed number
of HESE arising from the two hemispheres cannot be
larger than 3.3 HESE, i.e. ∼10% of the full sky flux.
As a result, the neutrino flux produced by the Galactic
CR interaction with gas cannot explain by itself the
IceCube spectral anomaly. These considerations are even
more restrictive for the case of the 90% confidence level
upper limit corresponding to a primary CR cut-off of
5 PeV, as evident from the predicted flux given in Figure 3.
