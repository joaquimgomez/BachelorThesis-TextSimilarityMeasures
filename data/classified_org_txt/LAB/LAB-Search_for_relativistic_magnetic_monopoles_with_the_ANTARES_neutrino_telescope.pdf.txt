Magnetic monopoles are predicted in various unified gauge models and could be produced at intermedi-
ate mass scales. Their detection in a neutrino telescope is facilitated by the large amount of light emitted
compared to that from muons. This paper reports on a search for upgoing relativistic magnetic mono-
poles with the ANTARES neutrino telescope using a data set of 116 days of live time taken from December
2007 to December 2008. The one observed event is consistent with the expected atmospheric neutrino
and muon background, leading to a 90% C.L. upper limit on the monopole flux between 1.3 � 10�17
and 8.9 � 10�17 cm�2 s�1 sr�1 for monopoles with velocity b P 0.625.

1. Introduction

Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles first proposed
by Pierre Curie in 1894 [1]. In 1931 Dirac demonstrated that the
existence of magnetic monopoles naturally leads to and thus ex-
plains the quantization of the electric charge [2]. In 1974, ’t Hooft
and Polyakov discovered independently that, in certain spontane-
ously broken gauge theories, magnetic monopoles are not only a
possibility, but a requirement [3,4].

Despite intensive search efforts, no particles possessing magnetic
charge have been detected up to now [5], although some reports of
magnetic monopole detections have been claimed [6–8] and subse-
quently withdrawn [9,10]. Nevertheless, direct searches for
monopoles in cosmic rays over the past decade have provided
stringent flux limits below the original Parker bound UP �
10�15 cm�2 s�1 sr�1 [11] (cf. Section 2.1). The MACRO experiment
obtained a flux upper limit at the level of 1.4 � 10�16 cm�2 s�1 sr�1
for the monopole velocity range 4 � 10�5 < b < 1 [12]. For relativistic
magnetic monopoles (b J 0.8), stronger bounds were reported by
the Baikal and AMANDA neutrino telescopes. The Baikal neutrino
telescope NT200 has set an upper limit of 4.6 � 10�17 cm�2 s�1 sr�1
on the flux of monopoles for b ’ 1 [13], while the AMANDA-II limit at
b ’ 1 is 3.8 � 10�17 cm�2 s�1 sr�1 [14]. More recently, experiments
based on radio detection reported stronger upper limits for ultra-
relativistic magnetic monopoles. The RICE experiment at the South
Pole obtained an upper limit of 10�18 cm�2 s�1 sr�1 for Lorentz boost
factors 107 6 c 6 1012 [15] and ANITA improved the flux limit to
10�19 cm�2 s�1 sr�1 for 1010 6 c 6 1013 [16].

In this paper, a search for upgoing relativistic magnetic mono-
poles is presented for one year of data taking with the ANTARES
detector [17]. The outline of this paper is as follows: Section 2

2. Magnetic monopoles and their signal in a neutrino telescope

2.1. Magnetic monopoles

In his paper of 1931, Dirac introduced magnetic monopoles in
quantum theory and showed that the existence of a particle carry-
ing a magnetic pole leads to the quantization of electric charge [2].
In addition, the magnetic charges of the hypothetical monopoles
must be quantized according to the Dirac quantization condition
g = kgD, where gD ¼ �hc2e is the minimal magnetic charge, also called
the ‘‘Dirac charge’’, k is an integer and e is the elementary electric
charge.

In 1974, ’t Hooft and Polyakov independently discovered mono-
pole solutions in Georgi–Glashow gauge theories based on the SO
(3) group [3,4]. It was then realized that any unification model in
which the U (1) subgroup of electromagnetism is embedded in a
semi-simple gauge group and which is spontaneously broken by
the Higgs mechanism possesses monopole-like solutions. Mono-
poles appear as solitons that behave like particles in the classical
theory, with a mass of the order of Mmon � a�1K, where a is the
fine structure constant and K is the unification mass scale or the
intermediate mass scale of the underlying theory. Such magnetic
monopoles are predicted in any Grand Unified Theory (GUT) in
which a larger gauge group breaks down into a semi-simple sub-
group containing the explicit U (1) group of electromagnetism.
The mass predicted for the monopoles can range from 104 GeV to
1020 GeV depending on the specific model [18].

In such unified gauge models, magnetic monopoles would be
produced in the early Universe by the Kibble mechanism [19]. In
the case where monopoles were created at the GUT phase transi-
tion with a mass scale K � 1015 GeV, the inflationary scenario
strongly dilutes the monopole density, thereby solving the mono-
pole overdensity problem [20]. For monopoles produced in later
phase transitions in the early Universe below K � 1011 GeV, larger
fluxes of monopoles with mass 107 � 1013 GeV are expected [21].

The latter scenario may produce an observable abundance of the
so-called intermediate-mass monopoles if it occurs after cosmic
inflation. Magnetic monopoles have been proposed as candidates
for ultra-high energy cosmic rays provided that they do not cata-
lyze nucleon decay [22]. Many other alternative scenarios have
been put forward to solve the cosmological monopole problem
and thus the hypothesis that monopoles are still present in the
Universe is far from being dismissed. However, a stringent
phenomenological upper bound is given by the Parker limit, UP
� 10�15 cm�2 s�1 sr�1, which results from requiring the survival
of the galactic magnetic field [11]. A stronger bound derived from
the survival of a small galactic seed field and known as the
extended Parker bound is UP � 1.2 � 10�16 (Mmon/1017 GeV)
cm�2 s�1 sr�1 [23].

Measurements and estimates of cosmic magnetic fields suggest
that magnetic monopoles lighter than 1014 GeV could have been
accelerated to relativistic velocities, acquiring typical kinetic ener-
gies of 1015 GeV [24]. Magnetic monopoles are expected to lose en-
ergy significantly when crossing the Earth [25] due to their large
equivalent electric charge (gD ’ 68.5e). Using a simple Earth model,
calculations suggest, however, that magnetic monopoles with
mass below �1014 GeV would be detectable in a neutrino telescope
after crossing the Earth, despite their substantial energy loss [26].

2.2. Signal in a neutrino telescope

The detection of magnetic monopoles in a neutrino telescope is
based on the same principle as the detection of high energy muons.
Tompkins [27] showed that, as for electric charges, magnetically
charged particles produce Cherenkov emission when their velocity
is higher than the Cherenkov threshold bth = 1/n, where n is the
phase refractive index of the medium. The number of photons
emitted per unit length and wavelength, for b > bth, can be ex-
pressed as:

d2nc
dkdx

¼
2pa
k2

ng
e

where nc is the number of emitted photons and k their wavelength.
For the refractive index of sea water (n � 1.35), fast monopoles with
g = gD are expected to emit about 8550 times more Cherenkov
Fig. 1. Number of Cherenkov photons in the 300 � 600 nm wavelength range
emitted per cm in sea water from a monopole with g = gD (solid line) and from
d � rays produced along its path (dashed line) as a function of the velocity b of the
monopole. For comparison, the direct Cherenkov emission from a muon is also
shown (dotted line). The number of photons scales as the square of the monopole
charge.
photons than muons of the same velocity. Moreover, below the
Cherenkov threshold bth = 0.74, a magnetic monopole of velocity
b J 0.51 ionizes sea water leading to indirect Cherenkov emission
from knock off electrons (d � rays) produced along its path [28].
Fig. 1 shows the number of photons emitted per centimetre of track
length as a function of the velocity of the incoming monopole for
the wavelength range relevant in neutrino telescopes (300–
600 nm). The same quantity is also shown for a relativistic muon.
Contributions from radio-luminescence of water, pair production
and Bremsstrahlung induced by magnetic monopoles are negligible
compared to the direct and indirect Cherenkov light and are not
taken into account in this analysis.
3. The ANTARES neutrino telescope

The ANTARES detector is an underwater telescope immersed in
the Western Mediterranean Sea at a depth of 2475 m [17]. In the
final configuration the detector consists of 885 optical modules
(glass spheres housing a photomultiplier) on twelve mooring lines.
Each detector line comprises 25 storeys, each of them housing
three optical modules, and is connected via an interlink cable to
a Junction Box. The Junction Box itself is connected to the shore
station at La Seyne-sur-Mer by a 42 km long electro-optical cable.
During the construction of the detector, data were taken with a dif-
ferent number of lines in different periods.

The analysis has been performed using data taken from Decem-
ber 2007 to December 2008. Quality requirements are applied to
select data from periods with low levels of bioluminescent activity
and a well calibrated detector. After this selection the data is
equivalent to a total of 136 days of live time: 43 days with 12 lines,
46 days with 10 lines and 47 days with 9 lines.
4. Simulation and reconstruction

4.1. Monte Carlo simulations

Upgoing magnetic monopoles with one unit of Dirac charge
(g = gD) have been simulated using a Monte Carlo program based
on GEANT3 [29] for ten ranges of velocities in the region
b = [0.550,0.995], with a flat distribution inside each bin. The sim-
ulation is independent of the magnetic monopoles mass and the
incoming direction of monopoles was distributed isotropically over
the lower hemisphere. The number of direct Cherenkov photons
emitted by the magnetic monopoles is computed using Eq. (1),
with an emission angle with respect to the monopole direction de-
fined by cos(hc) = 1/bn. For photons emitted from d � rays, the
angular dispersion is calculated numerically [30] from the multiple
scattering of electrons in water [31]. Fig. 2 shows the angular dis-
tribution of Cherenkov photons from d – rays with respect to the
monopole direction for several values of the monopole velocity.

The simulation of emitted photons is processed inside a cylin-
drical volume surrounding the instrumented volume. A radius of
480 m (eight times the absorption length), four times larger than
that used for the standard ANTARES muon simulation, is chosen
in order to take into account the large amount of light emitted
by a magnetic monopole.

When searching for upgoing magnetic monopoles, the main
source of background events is due to upgoing muons induced
by atmospheric neutrinos and downgoing atmospheric muons
wrongly reconstructed as upgoing. The simulation of downgoing
atmospheric muons produced by the interaction of cosmic rays
with nuclei in the upper atmosphere is carried out using the CORS-
IKA air shower program [32] in combination with the QGSJET code
for the description of hadronic interactions [33]. The cosmic ray
spectrum is simulated according to the Hörandel model [34].



Fig. 2. Angular distributions of Cherenkov photons from d � rays produced by a
monopole with g = gD as a function of the emission angle hc between the photon and
the monopole. Distributions are shown for monopole velocities b = 0.55, 0.60, 0.70,
0.90 and 0.995.

S. Adrián-Martínez et al. / Astroparticle Physics 35 (2012) 634–640 637
Upgoing atmospheric neutrinos from the decay of pions and kaons
are generated assuming the Bartol atmospheric neutrino flux mod-
el [35,36] and are combined with neutrinos coming from the decay
of charm mesons as produced by the RQPM model [37].

In order to match the real detector conditions, the simulations
are performed separately for each detector configuration (9, 10
and 12 lines) with the dead channel mapping and optical back-
ground rates corresponding to each data taking period.
4.2. Trigger selection

The ANTARES data acquisition is based on the all-data-to-shore
concept [38]. In this scheme, all photomultiplier signals above a gi-
ven threshold equivalent to �0.3 photo-electrons are transmitted
to shore, where they are filtered using different trigger conditions
and finally transferred to mass storage.

For both the data and Monte Carlo simulation samples, pattern
recognition of the fired channels (hits) is performed within a time
window of 2.2 ls, the typical time that a relativistic particle with
b = 0.5 takes to cross the detector. Two standard pattern recogni-
tion templates based on local coincidences have been applied. A lo-
cal coincidence is defined either as an occurrence of two hits on
two separate optical modules of a single storey within 20 ns, or

described in Section 5 are applied.
one single hit of large amplitude, typically more than 3 photoelec-
trons. The first trigger (directional trigger) requires five local coin-
cidences within the triggering time window anywhere in the
detector that are causally connected. The second trigger (cluster
trigger) requires two so-called T3-clusters within the trigger win-
dow. A T3-cluster is a combination of two local coincidences in
adjacent or next-to-adjacent storeys within 100 ns or 200 ns,
respectively. When an event is triggered, the amplitude and time
of all hits are recorded during a window from 2.2 ls before the first
hit participating in the trigger until 2.2 ls after the last hit of the
trigger. More than 85% of monopoles with a velocity b > 0.58 that
produce at least six detected hits pass the above trigger conditions.

4.3. Reconstruction algorithm

The standard track reconstruction assumes that particles travel
at the speed of light. In order to improve the sensitivity for mag-
netic monopoles travelling with lower velocities, one of the AN-
TARES tracking algorithms [39] has been modified so as to leave
the velocity as a free parameter to be determined by the track fit.
This algorithm, based on the minimization of time residuals using
the least square method (see below), has a very stringent hit selec-
tion, which leads to a robust reconstruction with respect to back-
ground hits.

The modified algorithm performs two independent fits: a track
fit and a bright point fit. The former reconstructs the track of a par-
ticle crossing the detector at a velocity bfree, introduced as a free
parameter, while the latter reconstructs the event as a point-like
light source. Both fits minimize the same quality function Q de-
fined as:

Q ¼
XN
i¼1

ðtc � tiÞ
2

r2i
þ Ai

" #
ð2Þ

The first term on the right hand side is the sum for N hits of the
square of the time residuals, where tc is the expected time of a
hit, ti the measured time and ri the estimated time uncertainty
for hit i. The second term Ai � qidi is introduced to penalize hits with
large charge qi combined with a large distance of closest approach di
between the track and the detection line.

After imposing the final selection cuts described in Section 5,
the modified tracking algorithm yields to an approximately Gauss-
ian resolution rb on the magnetic monopole reconstructed velocity
of about rb ’ 0.025 for velocities lower than the Cherenkov thresh-
old. The resolution improves to rb ’ 0.003 for higher velocities.
The speed resolution is shown in Fig. 3 for magnetic monopoles
simulated in two different velocity ranges.

b = [0.775,0.825] (dashed line) are also shown with arbitrary absolute normaliza-
tion. Only tracks reconstructed using hits on at least two lines are considered in this
plot.

5. Event selection

The search strategy is based on a blind analysis in order to avoid
any experimental bias [40]. Both the first level selection cuts and
the final event selection based on the optimization of the Model
Discovery Factor (MDF) [41,42] were tuned on Monte Carlo simu-
lated samples. The background simulations have been verified
after each step of the event selection with a test sample of 15%
of the selected data, equivalent to 20 days out of the total 136 days
of live time.

5.1. First level selection

Both Monte Carlo events and data (the sample of 15%) have
been reconstructed with the modified algorithm introduced in Sec-
tion 4.3. The data were compared to the Monte Carlo expectation
over the full range of reconstructed track velocities, as shown in
Fig. 4. A normalization factor of 1.8 has been applied to the simu-
lated sample of atmospheric muons, which is consistent with the
expected uncertainties on the optical module angular acceptance
of Cherenkov light from downgoing particles and on parameters
of the atmospheric muon flux model, such as the primary cosmic
ray composition and the hadronic interaction models. Good agree-
ment between the simulation and experimental distributions is
observed in the region brec > 0.6, while the simulation underesti-
mates the data for lower velocities. Monte Carlo studies indicate
that the region below b = 0.625 is very sensitive to the time depen-
dence of the optical background, consequently events in this region
are not considered for further analysis.

Fig. 5 shows the zenith angle distribution of the reconstructed
tracks for simulated atmospheric muons and muons induced by
upgoing atmospheric neutrinos compared with the data sample.
Upgoing magnetic monopoles generated in two different velocity
regions are also presented.

Due to the large background from atmospheric muons in the
downgoing direction, only upgoing tracks with a zenith angle
smaller than 90� are selected. To reduce the number of poorly
reconstructed events, only those for which the track is recon-
structed using hits from at least two lines are kept. The third first
level selection cut rejects events that fit the bright point hypothesis
better than the track hypothesis, cf. Section 4.3. This suppresses
events dominated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers and
reduces by a large fraction the number of misreconstructed atmo-
spheric muons.

5.2. Final selection

The final event selection was performed by optimizing the Mod-
el Discovery Factor by cutting on discriminating variables. The first
discriminating variable is the number of hits associated to the
track used by the reconstruction algorithm. The large amount of
light emitted by a monopole compared to that of atmospheric
muons or muons induced by atmospheric neutrinos makes this a
particularly powerful discriminant. This is demonstrated in Fig. 6
where the distributions of the numbers of hits are shown for the
simulated atmospheric events and for magnetic monopoles simu-
lated in the range b = [0.775,0.825]. For all tracks in these distribu-
tions the reconstructed velocity is restricted to brec = [0.775,0.825].

A second discriminating variable was introduced in order to fur-
ther reduce the background, in particular for velocities below the
Cherenkov threshold where the light emission is less. Two different
track-reconstruction fits for each event are performed. In the first

where Qt(brec = 1) and Qt(brec = free) are the track quality parameters
for fixed and free brec, respectively. With this definition, it is ex-
pected that k is positive for monopoles and negative for atmo-
spheric events. This feature is confirmed in Fig. 7, where
distributions of k are displayed for events reconstructed in the
range brec = [0.775,0.825].

The selection cuts were optimized by minimizing the MDF for a
5r discovery at 90% probability. This minimization was performed
by varying the cuts on the number of hits and the k parameter for
each simulated velocity range. The cuts on Nhit and k resulting
from the optimization are indicated in Table 1 for the three detec-
tor configurations. In order to be less dependent on the Monte Car-
lo statistics, an extrapolation of the background distribution of
Nhit into the high Nhit region was performed. The number of
atmospheric background events expected for 116 days of data tak-
ing is finally indicated in Table 1 for each range of reconstructed
velocity.
6. Results

After unblinding, the remaining 85% of the data was first com-
pared to the simulated background after the first level selection
cuts discussed before and after applying the normalization factor
extracted from the 15% data sample. A good agreement was found
between data and simulation in respect to both the zenith and brec
distributions.

The number of observed events is given in Table 1 after the final
selection cuts are applied to the unblinded data sample. Only one
event passes all the selection criteria and was found to lie in the
range brec = [0.675,0.725]. Given the expected background of
s are indicated, as well as the number of background events expected for the total of
8 is also reported and the Feldman–Cousins 90% C.L. flux limit is given, assuming that

1.3 � 10�1, which requires five events for a 5r deviation, the obser-
vation is compatible with the background-only hypothesis. Consid-
ering the observed event as background, the Feldman–Cousins 90%
C.L. upper limits [43] on the upgoing magnetic monopole flux are
reported in Table 1, for g = gD, where systematic uncertainties are
included.

The dominant source of systematic uncertainty is the detector
efficiency for the monopole signal. The modelling of the detector
efficiency depends mainly on the assumptions for the optical mod-
ule angular acceptance and on the light absorption length in sea
water. The detection efficiency of an optical module is determined
with an uncertainty of ±15% for Cherenkov light from upgoing par-
ticles and the light absorption length in water is measured to ±10%
over the whole wavelength spectrum [44]. In order to estimate the
effect of the detection efficiency, 18% (quadratic sum of uncertain-
ties) of hits per event were removed randomly in the Monte Carlo
monopole simulation. Monopoles remaining after the selection
cuts were used in the calculation, leading to a deterioration of
the upper limit of 3% for velocities above the Cherenkov threshold
and 7% for velocities below the threshold. This limit is then consid-
ered as the final one. The statistical uncertainties are negligible.

The flux limit for upgoing magnetic monopoles is shown in
Fig. 8 as a function of the monopole velocity b. The limits reported
by MACRO [12] for an isotropic flux of monopoles, Baikal [13] and
AMANDA [14] for upgoing monopoles are also given, as well as the
theoretical Parker bound [11]. The flux limit obtained by this anal-
ysis improves by a factor of three the upper limits on the upgoing
monopole flux for velocities above the Cherenkov threshold and
extends these limits to lower velocities than limits obtained by
previous neutrino telescope analyses.

7. Summary

A search for relativistic magnetic monopoles has been per-
formed with 116 days live time of ANTARES data, yielding limits
on the upgoing magnetic monopole flux above the Cherenkov
threshold for 0.75 6 b 6 0.995 (c = 10) which are more stringent
than those obtained by previous experiments in this b range. Fur-
thermore, with a good identification of bright objects at low veloc-
ities thanks to the low light scattering in sea water, the analysis
improves the upper limits below the Cherenkov threshold for
0.625 6 b 6 0.75.
