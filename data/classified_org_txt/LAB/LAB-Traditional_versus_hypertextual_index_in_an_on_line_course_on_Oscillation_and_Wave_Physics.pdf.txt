Traditional versus hypertextual index in an on-line course on Oscillation and 

Wave Physics 

 

Abstract: We describe an on-line course on Oscillation and Wave Physics  

(https://ocw.upc.edu/webs/42254/Acustica_EN/), also used within a first-year subject 

on General Physics in our engineering college. Especially, we describe a new 

hypertextual index, based on a concept map, and the students’ response to this index as 

compared to a traditional index. 

Keywords: hypertext; concept map; on-line course design; blended representations; 

self-directed learning. 

Introduction 

We implemented an on-line course on Oscillation and Wave Physics intended as an 

introduction to acoustics, since it specifically addresses the wave nature of sound. This 

on-line course was also used in the framework of the compulsory first-year subject on 

General Physics in our engineering college. It is freely accessible as Open Course 

Ware of the first author’s university under the web address 

https://ocw.upc.edu/webs/42254/Acustica_EN/index.htm in English, with links to 

Spanish and Catalan versions. 

In the implementation of the on-line course, we took account of the need to face prior 

ideas or misconceptions and to conform to the current knowledge about effective 

writing for digital media. In addition, the on-line course has been provided with two 

alternative types of index for accessing the different items: a traditional linear index, 

and an hypertextual index based on a concept map.

The objective of this article is: 

• to describe the main features of the on-line course as learning environment, 

specially the two types of index, and 

• to report on the students’ response to the hypertextual index in comparison to 

the traditional one. 

No previous implementation of a hypertextual index for a physics learning web site is 

known to us. This is the reason for our interest in studying the students’ response.  

Rationale for the Design of the On-Line Course – Resulting Main Features 

Concerning the form, the on-line course web site was designed taking the known rules 

for building effective on-line courseware into account, including the use of hypertext 

whenever appropriate [1,2]. Particularly, the physics contents were divided into 

conveniently short web pages, so that, whenever possible, the main text fits the 

computer screen. In addition, a course unit should contain the main ideas and means to 

access more information on the content, instead of too many details resulting in the 

same students’ level of achievement but with a significantly longer duration of the 

preparation [3]. According to the last quoted author, another essential design principle 

is the chapter ordering of the contents. This led to the introduction of a traditional 

sequential index or table of contents, which should provide both an overall view and 

an access to the many web pages through the corresponding links (Figure 1). 

        [Insert Figure 1 about here] 

Concerning the contents, the on-line course web site was also designed under the 

viewpoint of the conceptual change pedagogies [4-6], which also aim to face prior 

ideas or misconceptions, about sound in our case [7].

The problem of misconceptions about sound has been addressed repeatedly even at 

college or university level [8,9]. At this level, the main misconceptions are related to 

the sound nature and the sound propagation model, because of considering sound 

caused by air or medium particles advancing in the space, instead of the oscillation of 

the air or medium particles which propagates to the neighboring particles [10].  

As a way to face this kind of misconceptions, some published remedial approaches 

have been implemented in our on-line course by means of multimedia resources right 

from the first web page. The first approach has been the use of bridging analogies in 

the form of blended representations, given the high efficiency reported by [11-14]. 

Some examples of blended representations are the graphic and mathematical 

descriptions of oscillations (Figure 2) and sound wave propagation (Figure 3). Other 

multimedia resources used are short own-produced videos of hands-on experiments, 

e.g. about resonance (Figure 4), and embedded applets taken from the web, which 

meet established evaluation criteria [15-17]. 

    [Insert Figure 2, 3 and 4 about here] 

An efficient complementary remedial approach consists of practical activities of 

ongoing self-assessment [18], which is also applied in our on-line course by means of 

problem solving (with hints and results) and multiple-choice questions.  

Another resource of the conceptual change pedagogies is the use of concept maps, also 

used to remedy misconceptions [19,20]. Concept maps are graphical tools for 

organizing and representing knowledge. They include concepts, usually enclosed in 

boxes, and relationships between concepts represented by connecting lines. Words on 

each line, referred to as linking words or linking phrases, specify the relationship

between the two concepts. The concepts are represented in a hierarchical structure, 

with the most general concepts at the top of the map and the more specific concepts 

arranged hierarchically below [21]. Experimental results show that concept maps are 

effective and useful for teaching concepts and increasing the students’ level of factual 

knowledge in spite of some difficulties [22-25]. Concept maps are also useful as 

assessment tool for conceptual understanding in different knowledge areas [26-28]. 

This suggested the possibility of giving the on-line course the structure of a fully 

hypertextual environment on the basis of a concept map about Oscillatory and Wave 

Physics for our engineering students. The linking phrases between nodes were 

implemented as guiding questions.  

This concept map was translated into a hypertextual index or table of contents (Figure 

5, with fully expanded index), where every concept map node corresponds to a theory 

item, i.e. a web page. The extension of the index can be adjusted by the user at will, 

according to the desired hierarchical level, clicking on the yellow cases with a plus or 

minus sign (for expanding or contracting, respectively). 

     [Insert Figure 5 about here] 

Hypertexts are known to have some advantages as learning environments. They allow 

the reader to develop a non-linear interaction with the content [29], including ways of 

navigating the content [30,31]. This interaction can foster a flexible and nevertheless 

deep learning [32] and increase readers’  comprehension skills [33]. Hyperlinks 

provide a high level of learners’ control over the order and selection of information 

through comprehension decisions [34,35]. A hierarchically structured arrangement 

helps to understand and to solve problems [36], and to understand the macrostructure

of the semantic relationships between contents that supports more coherent navigation 

and promotes the construction of a mental representation of the information structure 

of hypertexts [37].  

Traditional versus Hypertextual Index – Students’ Response 

As mentioned in the Introduction, the second objective of this article is to report on the 

students’ response to the hypertextual index in comparison to the traditional one. 

Specifically: 

a) Which advantages and drawbacks do students find in the hypertextual index in 

comparison with the traditional index? (qualitative comparison) 

b) Is there any relationship between the use of one or the other index and the  

performance in the exams? (quantitative comparison) 

Students’ Populations 

In a first phase covering four semesters, this on-line course on Oscillation and Wave 

Physics was an essential part of a wider on-line distance learning course on Acoustics. 

This part of the on-line course was accessible only through the hypertextual index 

(Fig. 5). The rest of course syllabus was related to more specialized areas like 

environmental acoustics, musical acoustics and architectural acoustics, and it was 

accessible only through a traditional index (similar to Fig. 1). This course was for 

senior students enrolled in different engineering programs, ranging from 

Telecommunication to Chemistry. These students, 45 in total, formed the population 

taken for the above question a).

Later, in a second phase, this on-line course was used in the framework of the 

compulsory first-year subject on General Physics in our engineering college, for the 

topic of Oscillation and Wave Physics. Specifically, it was used as environment for 

autonomous learning at home previously to the traditional face-to-face teaching in a 

sort of flipped classroom. So, the students had to learn the theory items scheduled for 

the corresponding class autonomously in advance to the class, using the on-line course. 

In the class itself, only unclear concepts were clarified and, especially, the problems 

and multiple-choice questions proposed in the on-line course itself were solved. Of 

course, the on-line course was also recommended as a learning support for reviewing 

the contents after the class and preparing the exam. From all the involved freshmen 

students, we discarded those who did not even take the exam or who reached less than 

10% of the maximum score, because it could be assumed that they had not worked 

minimally on the subject. As a result, 207 students in five semesters formed the 

population taken for question b) (96 in the first three semesters, plus 111 in the 

following two semesters). 

Methodology  

Concerning question a), at the end of each course in the first phase, students were 

asked to comment one or more aspects taken at will from a list of possible aspects of 

the on-line course. One of these aspects to comment just if desired was the comparison 

of the study using the web pages accessible through the hypertextual index with the 

study of the rest of the course using the web pages accessible through a traditional 

index. The freedom to comment this particular aspect should avoid that students feel 

compelled to make any stereotyped comments about such a difference, which probably

would not reflect their true learning experience. Indeed, only a limited number of 

students, 21 out of 45, made a comment on this specific aspect. Additionally, some of 

the comments were taken from the discussions within the working groups formed. 

Concerning question b), in the first three semesters of the second phase (96 students), 

only the traditional index was made available. In contrast, in the two subsequent 

semesters (111 students), only the hypertextual index was available. Then, we 

compared the performance in the five final General Physics exams with regard to the 

topic of Oscillations and Waves as a relevant part of these exams. 

As a measure of every student’s performance, which we call ‘Performance Rate’, we 

have taken the ratio of the sum of scores reached in each multiple-choice question or 

problem-solving item concerning Oscillations and Waves to the sum of the respective 

maximum scores. Each problem-solving item had a maximum score of 1, and each 

right answer to a multiple-choice question had a fixed score of 0.5 (-0.17 if wrong). 

Nevertheless, here we have taken 0 as score both for unanswered multiple-choice 

questions and wrong answers. 

Results for Question a) – Discussion 

Students as a whole do not clearly show a preference for the one type of index to the 

detriment of the other one, but they point out their advantages and drawbacks 

according to their learning experience. 

Advantages of the hypertextual index (with students’ literal expressions, translated 

into English):  

1) To raise the students’ curiosity and therefore their interest for the physics contents:

The order of the topics was chosen according to my curiosity […] (Electrical 

Engineering student).  

[…] one can gradually evolve and learn according to one’s own taste. In other 

words, choosing the order of topics by oneself makes it more entertaining, 

because it is always simpler to learn what one likes just then. (Industrial 

Engineering student). 

The main advantage of the hypertextual system is the alternative “playful” way 

of studying (discussion in one of the working groups). 

2) Efficiency of the guiding questions of the hypertextual index in guiding the student: 

The criterion [for the order to be followed] was to try to always follow the flow 

lines, in order to try to move forward in the theory without losing sight 

(Mechanical Engineering student). 

[…] the order I followed was very coherent, thanks to the help of the questions in 

black [guiding questions] and the flow lines, I must admit (Mechanical 

Engineering student). 

Once I have seen how the synoptic [hypertextual] index was structured, it was 

easier to choose the order […], always trying to follow one and the same line of 

knowledge, without going into items which could be more interesting a priori, 

but which diverted from a logical line […]. Once I understood the structure of the 

synoptic [hypertextual] index, I found it much easier and more pleasant to choose 

the items to be studied. The method of following a preset order [traditional

sequential index] makes the task much easier, although it takes away some of its 

attractiveness when studying the topics (Mechanical Engineering student). 

3) Freedom to pursue one’s own learning itinerary according to the personal leanings, 

so that physics becomes less hard or laborious: 

The detail that most attracted my attention was the freedom to choose the next 

item to be studied […] (IT Engineering student). 

[…] it is easier to follow a predetermined index, but it may become harder. It is 

more autodidactic to follow a synoptic [hypertextual] index, so you are choosing 

the way according to your needs (Mechanical Engineering student). 

[…] in the form of a synoptic chart, it offers more freedom so that one can 

organize the contents at will or according one’s interest (Electrical Engineering 

student). 

4) To learn to avoid any obsession with the order of items, as a convenient attitude in 

order to learn autonomously: 

[Concerning the study of the different contents,] sometimes my impression was 

that I was not doing it in the right order […], but afterwards I got used to 

understand it in a parallel way and not to become obsessed with an allegedly 

correct order (Telecommunications Engineering student).  

It is very constructive to learn in this way, because the doubts arise before the 

answers (Industrial Engineering student). 

Another advantage [or the hypertextual index] is the possibility of rectifying, that 

is to say, if one has chosen an item and afterwards one is not sure about it, one

can leave it and choose a more suitable one (discussion in one of the working 

groups). 

Drawbacks of the hypertextual index: 

1) Possible poor interpretation of the hierarchical order of items: 

We agree about the convenience […] of indicating somehow which items are the 

most important […] and which are minor (discussion in one of the working 

groups). 

2) Possibility of interpreting the guiding questions in an equivocal manner: 

The [guiding] questions should be as accurate as possible, allowing […] to get an 

idea of the contents […]. Everyone can interpret this guiding questions in a 

different way, obtaining a “pleasant” or “unpleasant” result once the content 

hidden in the item becomes disclosed (Telecommunications Engineering 

student). 

Although [the guiding questions] lead you towards which web page [you want to 

go], it is not clear enough what will be explained there and which background 

you need (discussion in one of the working groups).  

The help of the introductory questions was limited and, in practice, in order to 

know the content of an item, we rather tended to have a look at it, because in our 

opinion, a question can be misread (discussion in another working group). 

3) Uncertainty about whether the optimal item order is being followed (with the more 

or less implicit statement that the order proposed by the lecturer is the optimal one):

[…] but at the same time it created a sense of insecurity for me about whether the 

path chosen was the most suitable one  (IT Engineering student). 

[…] Instead, when we use the second method [traditional index], we are 

absolutely sure that the topics we address will be within our grasp, because the 

lecturer has scheduled the topics adequately (discussion in one of the working 

groups). 

[With the traditional index,] the student is assured that he or she will not take the 

wrong path, but all the pieces will fit together if he or she follows this index and 

if the author has done his or her work well (discussion in another working 

group). 

4) Possible waste of time when a topic must be left aside, for addressing a previous 

topic needed: 

[…] sometimes you can make a wrong choice and you have to turn to previous 

topics that would be already studied if you had used the second method 

[traditional index]. The second method is quicker, because you don’t need to 

search, turning to previous topics, and you have not so many doubts arising 

(Industrial Engineering student). 

For example, to solve problem 7.6 of the item “The decibel”, one needs to have 

seen the item “Sound intensity as a function of distance”, but I saw it later […]. 

To do some exercises, I had to know the theory that I would see afterwards. […] 

It is possible that, in order to understand a concept, one has to have previously

[…] it is difficult to deduce from a title what should be done first and what 

shouldn’t. So, I found myself studying topics for which other topics were needed 

on which I hadn’t worked  (Electrical Engineering student). 

Out of these possible drawbacks, the second one is unavoidable, because of the always 

limited information that a guiding question can convey, necessarily being a short 

question. However, these comments must be taken into account in order to put guiding 

questions which are not purely rhetorical but convey the maximum possible 

information on the content or approach of an item. 

The other drawbacks must be put into perspective, particularly the third one. The 

learning method using a traditional sequential index will always give a greater sense of 

security than the hypertextual index, because the freedom of choice very often has the 

price of uncertainty to a greater or lesser extent. This freedom of choice can be 

considered as a part of autonomous learning, and therefore, it is considered as a 

disadvantage by students, together with a greater workload [38]. Students are used to 

the teacher or lecturer as a provider of subject content who needs to fill the students 

with knowledge [39,40], and they find it hard to learn and work autonomously, 

developing their own responsibility for learning in tertiary and lifelong education 

[41,42]. However, self-directed learning throughout a lifetime should take the freedom 

of choice into account as an important value [41,43]. The freedom and choice features 

provided by new self-directed personalized learning environments should be 

maintained as a support of the constructivist approach and self-regulation, even while

sustaining the appropriated level of teacher’s or lecturer’s control and structural 

requirements of formal learning [44]. In addition, freedom and choice for learning is 

one of the factors leading to success or personal change. Indeed, in a study with self-

directed learners [45], personal freedom to learn was rated most important for success 

and personal transformation, and also choice was a key aspect of using open 

educational content. Choice or freedom to select the topic is also an essential 

motivational reason for self-directed informal learning, the freedom to learn being a 

key factor for its success [46]. Therefore, the perception of uncertainty resulting from 

the freedom to choose a personal path through the hypertextual index of contents 

cannot be considered a learning disadvantage with respect to the traditional index. 

Al other drawbacks reported were also taken into account for the final version of the 

hypertextual index used in the second phase. However, these drawbacks remain 

unavoidable to some minor degree. 

Results for Question b) – Discussion 

As a first result, we found no significant difference between the students’ performance 

rate as a whole using the traditional index and using the hypertextual index, with mean 

values and 95% confidence intervals of 0.52 ± 0.04 and 0.53 ± 0.04, respectively. 

However, a closer look at the individual results suggested that each performance rate 

could depend on the particular aspect of the Oscillations and Wave topic addressed by 

the corresponding individual multiple-choice question or problem-solving item. 

Therefore, we established the five subtopics of the Oscillations and Wave topic listed 

in Table 1. We found no significant difference between using the traditional index and

the hypertextual one for all subtopics, except for No. 3 and 4 in Table 1, where the 

respective mean performances and their 95% confidence intervals are given. 

       [Insert Table 1 about here] 

All performance rates are around 0.5, after excluding the students with an exam score 

under 10% of the maximum, as explained in the Methodology subsection above.  

For subtopics 1, 2 and 5, the absence of significant differences in the performance rate 

can be due to the lack of learning advantages of one type of index over the other one in 

these subtopics. Indeed, the different issues in these subtopics can be treated in a rather 

linear way, i.e. with no direct need to consider any relevant interrelationships with 

issues belonging to other subtopics. In this case, the traditional linear index should not 

be at a disadvantage compared to the hypertextual index, at least with regard to taking 

exams. 

In contrast, in subtopics 3 and 4 there are cross-linked relationships between different 

conceptual aspects, and these relationships should be addressed as explicitly as 

possible for a better understanding. This is obviously the case for the relationship 

between the wave as a whole and the local oscillations at the different points of a wave 

propagation medium, and it also applies for the close relationship between the local 

oscillation energy and the energy propagation in a wave, together with the resulting 

wave intensity in the case of acoustic waves. Here, the concept map which is behind 

the hypertextual index was most probably a relevant help for building deeper 

knowledge concerning these interrelationships, according to the considerations in the 

Rationale section, based on the literature about concept maps (especially [21-24]).

Another reason for the absence of significant differences in some performance rates 

could be the teaching method described in the Students’ Populations subsection. 

Indeed, in the sort of flipped-class approach applied, the autonomous learning using 

the on-line course was followed by a face-to-face class with complementary activities 

like clearing up of doubts or problem solving. This can be expected to have evened out 

the differences to some extent. However, for subtopics 3 and 4, the significant 

performance differences reveal that the use of the concept map in the form of an 

hypertextual index has probably led to a deeper assimilation or internalization of the 

above-mentioned interrelationships between conceptual aspects which could not be 

reached in the face-to-face class activities, according to the literature quoted above on 

conceptual maps. 

Conclusions 

In a first phase, the on-line course was used with the hypertextual index for the 

Oscillations and Waves topic as introduction to a wider subject on Acoustics, but using 

a traditional index for the rest of this subject. As a qualitative student response, we 

collected the free comments made (if desired) by students on the difference in using 

each type of index. Students found some advantages of the hypertextual index, e.g. the 

ability to rise curiosity increasing interest in the physics contents, or the building of a 

convenient attitude for learning autonomously. In contrast, the drawbacks perceived 

were e.g. the possible equivocal interpretation of the guiding questions, or the 

uncertainty about the optimal order of items to be followed.  

In the Discussion of these qualitative results, these perceived drawbacks have been put 

into perspective, as an unavoidable part of a more autonomous and self-directed

learning in comparison to the externally directed learning through a traditional 

sequential index, resulting in indirect advantages for a self-directed personalized 

learning, according to the literature quoted there.  

In a second phase, the on-line course was used for the topic of Oscillation and Waves 

within the first-year subject on General Physics, in a sort of flipped-class approach, 

where students had to learn the contents autonomously before the face-to-face class. 

The course version with only the traditional index was available in some of the 

semesters, while the course version with only the hypertextual index was available in 

the other semesters. As a quantitative student response, no significant overall 

performance difference in the exams was observed, if all Oscillations and Waves 

subtopics as a whole are considered. However, we found a not large but significant 

difference for two subtopics related to cross-linked relationships between different 

conceptual aspects, like the relationship between local oscillations at the different 

points of a wave propagation medium and the wave as a whole, and also between local 

oscillation energy and energy propagation in a wave, including wave intensity. The 

lack of a more extensive significant performance difference is compatible with a lack 

of advantage of one index over the other with regard to taking exams. It can also be 

explained by some evening-out effect of the complementary face-to-face activities. In 

contrast, for both above-mentioned subtopics, the significant performance differences 

can be explained by a deeper internalization of those above-mentioned cross-linked 

relationships through the concept map underlying the hypertextual index, according to 

the literature.
