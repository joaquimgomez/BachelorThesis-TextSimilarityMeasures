ABSTRACT

Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) produce complex, patterned
songs that are traditionally recorded on their breeding grounds. In this work, we
report results from the first continuous acoustic monitoring of a humpback whale
feeding ground off southern Chile, Corcovado Gulf. Using an autonomous contin-
uously recording system anchored to the seafloor and an automatic signal detector,
we used the units within a song to analyze the temporal distribution and diel pat-
terns of humpback whales. Acoustic recordings were made at the end of the austral
summer and autumn of 2012. Songs occurred over the entire 130 d monitoring
period, from 1 February to 15 June 2012. The percentage of units detected
increased throughout the monitored period with the highest detections in the last
recorded month (June), despite recording for fewer days that month. Furthermore,
songs were detected during all light regimes studied, but most frequently during
darkness. This study provides further evidence that, far from being rare or spo-
radic, humpback whale songs occur commonly at a feeding ground in high lati-
tudes over different light conditions and in all months, with a peak in autumn.

Key words: humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, feeding grounds, songs,
units, diel patterns, light regimes, southern Chile.

Communication is an integral part of social behavior in many taxa, such as insects,
frogs, fish, birds, and cetaceans (Wiley and Richards 1982, Bailey 1991, Richardson
et al. 1995, Zelick et al. 1999). Marine mammals have unique capabilities to both
generate and detect sounds since they depend on sound for foraging, reproduction,
communication, detection of predators, and even navigation (Richardson et al. 1995).
Given that light diminishes in the first few meters of the water column (Wartzok and
Ketten 1999) and that the propagation of sound in water allows sound waves to travel
long distances (Weilgart 2007, Moore et al. 2012), the main way in which marine
mammals relate to their environment is via auditory signaling. Marine mammal spe-
cies produce a large variety of sounds, from whales that generate low frequency

signals, i.e., below 20 Hz, to dolphins that generate high frequency signals, i.e., above
100 kHz (Richardson et al. 1995).

In recent years, the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has been extended
for acoustic detection of the presence of cetaceans (Clark and Ellison 1989, Frankel
et al. 1995, Charif et al. 2001, Oswald et al. 2003, Clark and Clapham 2004, Moore
et al. 2006, Mellinger et al. 2007, Stimpert et al. 2011). PAM devices are capable of
functioning over long periods of time, at day or night, in any weather condition
(although their reliability and range decrease when the weather and sea state deterio-
rate), and in any geographical area; thus, these tools have allowed for extensive mon-
itoring, far beyond that of visual surveys (Richardson et al. 1995, Au and Hastings
2008).

The song of the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) has been well-
documented through its duration, complexity, stereotypical sound, and repetitive
nature that can last for hours, initially by Payne and McVay (1971) and subse-
quently by many additional studies (i.e., Winn and Winn 1978; Guinee et al. 1983;
Mercado et al. 2003, 2005; Au et al. 2006; Green et al. 2011; Cholewiak et al.
2013). Multiple sounds or “units” occur in a stereotyped sequence called a phrase,
phrases are repeated to make a “theme,” and a series of themes, usually produced in
a particular order, define a song (Payne and Payne 1985). The acoustic units within
a song are highly variable in frequency, ranging between 100 and 4,000 Hz (Tyack
and Clark 2000), although other studies have found units with a fundamental fre-
quency below 30 Hz (Payne and Payne 1985) or a frequency oscillation over a band-
width of approximately 16–65 Hz (Cerchio and Dahlheim 2001) and harmonics
have been shown to extend beyond 24 kHz (Au et al. 2006). Songs are only sung by
male humpback whales (Winn and Winn 1978) and directly or indirectly related to
mating (Winn and Winn 1978, Tyack 1981, Darling and B�erub�e 2001, Smith
et al. 2008, Darling et al. 2012, Herman et al. 2013). Humpback whale songs occur-
ring in the same year and in the same geographic area tend to contain similar ele-
ments that are repeated in a consistent order (Winn and Winn 1978, Payne et al.
1983, Payne and Payne 1985). Humpback whales also produce many nonsong
vocalizations in both summer and winter areas, which include social and feeding
calls (Silber 1986, Dunlop et al. 2008), but few data exist regarding their variation
or behavioral significance (Herman 2016). Despite this knowledge, the behavior
associated with humpback whale song is still not well understood (Clapham 2000,
Herman 2016).

Seasonal and daily variation in the occurrence of vocalizations exists for a wide
range of species; examples of this include the dawn call of many birds (Brown and
Handford 2003) and the evening call of frogs and insects (Gerhardt and Huber
2002). There is also nocturnal vertical migration of zooplankton and fish species
(Brinton 1967). Largely due to the difficulty of following cetaceans for long periods
of time, the circadian rhythms of cetaceans in the wild have not been as well-
documented as those of terrestrial animals. Despite this, several factors that
influence circadian activity of marine species have been documented, including sleep
patterns, the need for respiration, lunar tidal fluctuations, and feeding requirements
(Palmer 1976). There are studies about diurnal and seasonal patterns in whale sing-
ing activity, e.g., in humpback whales (Helweg and Herman 1994, Au et al. 2000,
Cerchio et al. 2001) or blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whales (Balaenoptera
physalus) (�Sirović et al. 2004).

autumn–winter toward breeding grounds off Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, and
Costa Rica (Kellogg 1929, Mackintosh 1965, Fl�orez-Gonz�alez 1991, Rasmussen
et al. 2007). Feeding grounds for this population during austral summer–autumn
are: Antarctic Peninsula’s west coast (Kellogg 1929); western end of the Magellan
Strait (Gibbons et al. 2003, Acevedo 2005); and the Corcovado Gulf (Hucke-Gaete
et al. 2013). There is information concerning the connectivity between these feed-
ings areas and the migration from breeding regions to these feeding grounds
(Acevedo et al. 2006, 2013). There are no data available from the Corcovado Gulf
about the variability in the temporal presence off the humpback whales or from
behavior studies, as for example the singing activity. Such information is essential
for determining the abundance of this particular stock, understanding the migra-
tions routes or the behavior associated in a feeding area and to monitor the conserva-
tion status of this species. In this study, we conducted the first long-term
continuous recording of humpback whale songs in the Corcovado Gulf. We focus
on automatically detected acoustic units within a song with the objective to deter-
mine the temporal distribution and diel patterns of humpback whales in this feed-
ing area. The present study evaluates the frequency of occurrence of humpback
whale songs in this feeding ground with the aim of better understanding the pres-
ence and behavior of the eastern South Pacific population of humpback whales.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Acoustic Data Collection

In this study a marine autonomous recording unit (MARU) was moored to the
seafloor (200 m) near the island of Guafo North (43831.8890S, 074826.4880W) in
the Corcovado Gulf. The MARU was left to record ambient sounds from 30 January
until the 17 June 2012 (Fig. 1).

MARU is an archival bottom-mounted acoustic recording unit designed by the
Cornell University’s Laboratory of Ornithology Bioacoustics Research Program and
consists of an external hydrophone attached to a glass sphere containing batteries,
computer electronics, and internal memory storage (Calpuca et al. 2000, Clark et al.
2002, Clark and Clapham 2004). The hydrophone employed was the model HTI-
94-SSQ, with a frequency response of 2151.2 dB re 1 mPa from 2 to 300 kHz, a sen-
sitivity of 2198 dB re: 1 V/mPa, and a gain of 23.5 dB. We used a sampling rate of
2 kHz, resulting in a functional band width range of 0–1,000 Hz. humpback whale
acoustic units within a song often include frequencies inside this range, with domi-
nant frequencies below 500 Hz (Levenson 1969, 1972; Norris 1995). The MARU
was programmed to record continuously for 24 h. The recorded data were stored on
a hard drive and only accessible upon instrument recovery.

Automatic Detection/Acoustic Analyses

After the data were recovered, the sound files were analyzed using standard audio
processing software (especially Audacity and functions in Matlab) and Listening to
the Deep-Ocean Environment (LIDO) software. LIDO was developed by the Labora-
tory of Applied Bio-Acoustics at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Spain.
LIDO has several independent algorithms that allow for noise assessment and for
the detection and localization of acoustic sources. From the acoustic data flow,

ESPA ~NOL-JIM�ENEZ AND VAN DER SCHAAR: HUMPBACK WHALE SONGS 3



LIDO characterizes and locates detected sound events and produces spectrograms for
viewing the data (Andr�e et al. 2011).

In total, the recordings of 130 d were analyzed after the elimination of 2 d both
at the beginning and at the end of the recording; these days were removed to avoid
noise contamination from the installation and the recovery of the device. We identi-
fied the presence of complete songs of humpback whales through the stored spectro-
grams. A detection algorithm was configured to trigger on acoustic units that
exhibited characteristics unique to humpback whale song (i.e., frequency-modulated
signals or repetition in a rhythmic pattern) in a fundamental frequency range of
200–900 Hz. In this study, we will refer to these signals as units following the sug-
gestions made by Cholewiak et al. (2013). The original 15 min sound files were bro-
ken into segments of 32 s. The length of a segment is decided such that it is long
enough to include sufficient signals of a target species to allow its detection, while
being short enough to have a stationary background noise pattern; these patterns are
removed in denoising functions. In addition, it is preferred to use a power of two as
a segment length to optimize the processing speed (especially Fourier transforms).
The detection process for tonal sound under LIDO is described in detail in Zaugg
et al. (2012). Signals can be detected in multiple, specific time, and frequency scales,
allowing it to focus on the tonal vocalizations of a particular species if there are not
many other conflicting sources in the recordings, as was the case here, avoiding the
need for an additional classifier. The output of the detector (processing a segment)
is a value between 0 and 100, based on the detected signal with the highest inten-
sity: a single strong signal present in the segment can give a higher detector output

than multiple weak signals. The number of signals or acoustics units within a song
in each segment was not quantified. The presence analysis was always performed in
terms of segments, i.e., the number of segments in a day that were labeled positively
and with at least one humpback whale song unit. Once the detector was set up, its
efficacy was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The
ROC was used to determine the threshold or the cutoff point where detector
sensitivity was maximized. Furthermore, the ROC was used to determine the
discriminatory ability of the detector, i.e., the ability to differentiate between units
of humpback whale song and false signals (Cerda and Cifuentes 2012). In this study,
reliability and certainty were optimized to favor true positive detections (real hump-
back whale units within in a song) and accepting a higher number of false negative
detections. With these criteria, the number of true detections was likely reduced,
but false detections were also minimized.

Seasonality and Diel Patterns

In order to determine the seasonal patterns of the humpback whale, first we deter-
mined the total number of segments obtained for each month. Then, we quantified
the number of segments that were labeled positively, containing at least one hump-
back whale song unit. Following this, for each month we determined the percentage
of segments with at least one unit present out of the total number of segments
recorded. Finally, a chi-squared test was used to determine if the presence of seg-
ments with at least one acoustic unit differed by month (Quinn and Keough 2002).

To study the possible existence of a diel patterns in the humpback whale songs,
the recordings for each day were divided into three light regimes according to previ-
ously published studies (sensu Mussoline et al. 2012), for this, the altitude of the sun
was used to calculate the number of hours of daylight, darkness, dusk, and dawn
that each day possessed. The number of hours in the three light regimes was calcu-
lated based on the altitude of the sun using data from SEA-MAT (https://sea-
mat.github.io/sea-mat/). The day was divided into (1) light: the altitude of the sun
was greater than 08; (2) dark: the altitude of the sun was less than 2128; (3) twilight,
including dawn and dusk: the altitude of the sun was between 2128 and 08. From
this, the hours composing each regime were calculated for each month, taking into
account the local time and the summer/winter time change in May. Because the dif-
ferent light regimes did not cover the same number of hours, the number of seg-
ments with units were averaged for each hour of every month and for each period of
the day; multiple segments with units detected in the same hour were treated as
replicates. In order to study the differences between the percentages of segments
with at least one unit of a song in each regime for each month, chi-squared tests
were performed on the frequencies of segments (Quinn and Keough 2002).

RESULTS

Song Detections

The detected signals corresponded to units typically found in humpback whale
song, varying greatly in frequency between 200 and 900 Hz (Fig. 2); in some cases,
the units were repeated for hours.

Seasonality and Diel Patterns

The humpback whale detector’s accuracy was 85%, i.e., in 85% of the time the
automatic detection was a real signal of humpback whale song. Our validations con-
cluded a true positive rate of 0.68 and a negative positive rate of 0.08 (see Table 1
for more details). Evaluation of the percentage of segments that had at least one
humpback whale acoustic unit indicated the presence of humpback whale songs for
every month studied (Fig. 3).

In total, we studied 130 d divided in 332,836 segments of 32 s; 10,761 segments
included acoustic units typical of a humpback whale song. Differences were found
among months (n 5 10,761, v2 5 8,547.78, df 5 4, P 5 0.013): in February, we

obtained 321 segments with units from a humpback whale song, 676 in March, in
2,734 April, 3,903 in May, and in 3,127 June. The percentage of segments contain-
ing at least one acoustic unit increased throughout these months, despite June con-
taining only 15 d of sampling.

Examination of diel patterns indicated that songs (determined by the percentage
of segments with units within a song) occurred at all hours of the day (Fig. 4). There
were, however, significant differences among the months and light regimes (Fig.
4, Table 2). Thus, during the end of summer (February and March), more songs
were detected during twilight (0.9% and 1.3%) than in periods of light (0.5%
and 0.9%) and darkness (0.3% and 0.9%) (Fig. 4). In autumn (April, May, and
June) this pattern shifted, in periods of darkness more songs were detected
(5.6%, 9.2%, and 10%) than during twilight (5.3%, 4.7%, and 7.4%) or in
periods of light (1.7%, 3.6%, and 7.1%) (Fig. 4). Although songs occurred dur-
ing all three light regimes studied, the highest number of detections occurred
during periods of low light during darkness and twilight. The only exception

was February, where the number of songs was highest during periods of light
(Fig. 4, Table 2).

Two generalized linear models were constructed to determine which factors (light
regimes, month, and the interaction between light regimes and month) best
explained the variability of the data (Quinn and Keough 2002). The results indi-
cated that the model including the interaction between light regimes and month
explained the data best (Table 2). For this reason, we examined the differences
between months and light regimes and carried out a multiple comparison test
(Tukey) for each factor (month and light regimes) obtained by the generalized linear
model that included the interaction between light regimes and month (quasi-Pois-
son distribution) (Table 3). This statistical analysis indicated differences between
light-dark regimes but there were no differences with twilight. There were signifi-
cant differences in vocalizations between months except between February–March
and May–June (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

This study presents the first results of PAM of humpback whale (M. novaeangliae)
song in a feeding area in Chile. These observations demonstrate that, far from being
rare or sporadic, humpback whale songs occurred throughout the different light reg-
imens and during all the months of the study, with a peak in autumn. Because this
study was conducted on populations that had not previously been studied acousti-
cally, information from other populations from the Southern and Northern Hemi-
spheres were used to correctly identify the units within in a humpback whale song.
These constraints may have limited the number and type of signals that were identi-
fied. In addition, the instruments used in this study had a frequency range between
0 and 1,000 Hz and the detector was programed between 200 and 900 Hz; while
this range is sufficient to detect humpback whale signals, this species can sing at
higher frequencies (Payne and McVay 1971). We recommend that future studies
target the entire acoustic spectrum of this species. Still, the signals most frequently

detected in this study were among the most representative units that have been
described as parts of songs. Songs have been shown to occur within the frequency
range studied here and not at higher frequencies (Payne and McVay 1971).

Humpback whales detected in Guafo North, in the feeding area known as the
northern Chilean Patagonia, were constantly present from February to June. This
temporal presence coincided with sightings in the Magellan Strait (Acevedo 2005)
and Western Antarctic Peninsula (Mackintosh 1965). Humpback whales were
detected in summer and with a maximum in autumn. Our results support the idea
proposed by Hucke-Gaete et al. (2013) that a fraction of the eastern South Pacific
humpback whale population is using mid-latitudes waters to feed without migrat-
ing more south. If these whales migrate farther south to feed, they would arrive late
in the feeding season, making migration energetically inefficient with the short resi-
dence time that they could remain at the feeding grounds. Other studies have shown
a similar strategy where whales feed in mid-latitudes waters. For example, Best
(1995) and Barendse et al. (2010) show that some humpback whales use the mid-
latitude waters off Africa to feed, and thus do not complete the traditional migra-
tion entirely to more southern waters; rather, these whales remain in the productive
Benguela upwelling coastal system. Dawbin (1956) describes many humpback
whale sightings off the coast of New Zealand between January and March during
several consecutive years. These sightings were associated with a local concentration
of food, allowing Dawbin (1956) to conclude that humpback whales may remain in
such areas for relatively long periods of time without the need to migrate to Antarc-
tic waters. The high productivity in the Chilo�e marine ecoregion (Silva et al. 1995,
1997, 1998) would explain the permanence of humpback whales in this area at the
end of summer and autumn compared to their traditional migration patterns. There
are photo-identification, genomics, and satellites studies that confirmed the connec-
tion between the feeding area of the Magellan Strait with breeding areas in Colom-
bia, Costa Rica, and Panama (Acevedo et al. 2007, Capella et al. 2008, Guzman
et al. 2015) and between feeding areas in the Antarctic Peninsula with Ecuador,
Colombia, and Panama (Stone et al. 1990, Caballero et al. 2001, Stevick et al. 2004,
Acevedo et al. 2007, Guzman et al. 2015). These feeding areas and the Corcovado
Gulf are considered independent, without migratory movements of humpback
whales between these areas (Acevedo et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the migratory move-
ments of humpback whales feeding in Corcovado Gulf is unknown. We recommend
futures studies to identify the time of residence in this area and the migratory con-
nections between this northern feeding area and the breeding areas.

Humpback whale songs were detected throughout the acoustic range studied;
however, they mainly occurred at the high end of the detection range (500–900
Hz). Additionally, the detected segments composed patterns that were repeated for
hours and were constant from February to June though the presence of songs
increased as summer and autumn progressed. The detection of more segments con-
taining at least one unit is not an exact indication of a greater presence of whales;
rather it could represent more communication activity by the present whales. In
this study, we found complete humpback whale songs at high latitudes of Chile,
similar to what has been found in the North Atlantic (Mattila et al. 1987, McSwee-
ney et al. 1989, Clark and Clapham 2004, Stimpert et al. 2012, Vu et al. 2012).
Mattila et al. (1987) suggest that singing is cued by interaction of local whales with
whales that have come from other feeding areas. This hypothesis, however, would
not explain the results obtained here considering that movements or exchanges of
animals were not described between the three feeding areas of Chile (Acevedo et al.

ESPA ~NOL-JIM�ENEZ AND VAN DER SCHAAR: HUMPBACK WHALE SONGS 9



2013). Independent of whether humpbacks sing only when there are other whales
near, song is far more common during the feeding season than previously thought.
Similarly, there are other studies from humpback, blue, and fin whales (Croll et al.
2002, Moore et al. 2002, Clark and Gagnon 2004, Stimpert et al. 2012, Vu et al.
2012) singing during the feeding season.

Clapham (1996) suggested, from the observations of Mattila et al. (1987) and
McSweeney et al. (1989), that the occurrence of male songs at high latitudes during
summer, when humpback whales are not mating, could represent low-cost adver-
tisement by males as well as a way for females to possibly evaluate males as potential
mates. Similarly, songs in feeding areas have been linked to high rates of association
between females and males in summer (Clapham 1996); this, in turn, could be a
reproductive strategy in which males are in contact with many females during the
feeding season which could then create an advantage for them during the summer
breeding season. In this hypothesis, any male reproductive success gained from male
singers in high latitudes would occur during the mating season at low latitudes. An
alternative hypothesis is that singing during the feeding season is a way to ensure
immediate mating with sexually mature females who failed to conceive during the
previous breeding season, winter. Considering that humpback whales arrive at feed-
ing areas in high latitudes in early spring, Clark and Clapham (2004) suggest that
it is possible that some of the smaller fetuses were conceived in such areas; this
would imply that the breeding season is not restricted to low-latitude regions.
Although most sexual activity in humpback whale occurs in winter in the tropics,
male intersexual competitive behavior has been observed in autumn in feeding areas
(Weinrich 1995). Another hypothesis is that humpback whale song production is
related to the seasonal cycle of hormones (Clark and Clapham 2004, Wright and
Walsh 2010). Vu et al. (2012) suggest that their results of highest occurrences of
songs in spring or in late autumn coincide with elevated testosterone levels in
spring and autumn documented in feeding grounds. This relation is similar to hor-
monal control of the avian song control system (Brenowitz 1997); however, it has
not been thoroughly studied in humpback whales. Our results about songs detected
in autumn in the Corcovado Gulf for humpback whales supports the hypotheses
that singing is used as a reproductive strategy extending mating geographically and
temporally to autumn feeding, that it is an advantage for males courting females
who failed to conceive in the previous season, or that it is used to generate more con-
tacts with females to increase reproductive success in summer (as suggested by Clark
and Clapham 2004, Herman et al. 2013). Behavioral studies are needed before more
can be concluded about the purpose of these songs. Similarly, acoustic studies of the
timing and routes of migration could help to explain when and what type of hump-
back whales are found in the studied feeding area. These studies could also help to
determine how common these units are compared to units within in a song in other
humpback whale feeding areas.

In this study, the highest percentage of positive segments occurred during peri-
ods of low light at twilight and dark. This can be interpreted as more active acoustic
performance during periods of low light. This behavior is consistent with other
studies of humpback whales and other species (Au et al. 2000, Wiggins et al. 2005,
Munger et al. 2008, Cerchio et al. 2010, Mussoline et al. 2012, Risch et al. 2013,
Magn�usd�ottir et al. 2014), there are few studies where the behavioral changes were
not associated with light (i.e., Helweg and Herman 1994). Maximum singing has
been shown to be related to the daily migration in the water column of whale prey,
specifically copepods and euphausiids (Wiggins et al. 2005). The daily migration of

MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 00, 201810



krill, which aggregate at depth during the day, is believed to allow krill to avoid its
visual predators such as seals, fish, and birds (Brinton 1967). Thus, humpback whales
likely sing more at twilight, or dark because feeding is less efficient during those
hours when the krill are dispersed in the water column migrating to or from the
water’s surface. That is, the whales might sing less when they are busy feeding (during
the day when the krill are aggregated at depth) and sing more at night to announce
resources; this would be an example of songs associated with foraging, which has been
reported in other studies (Stafford et al. 2005, Wiggins et al. 2005, Magn�usd�ottir
et al. 2014). As discussed previously, if songs of male humpback whales are associated
with social interactions, singing could be the pursuit of females in estrus (Baker and
Herman 1984), or may reflect a switch to sexual advertisements as the primary male
mating strategy at this time (Au et al. 2000). If more whales are singing at night,
then fewer males may be engaging in direct competition for females. This farther sug-
gests that competitive group formation occurs primarily during the day, and that day-
light and vision play key roles in such intrasexual interactions (Au et al. 2000). Then
daily patterns of songs are potentially not only influenced by feeding alone but other
variables should also be considered to explain the more active behavior in hours of low
light. These variables could be the lack of visual cues for displaying competitive
behavior (Au et al. 2006), or the levels of marine ambient sound or a combination of
these possibilities. Whales are capable of communicating over hundreds of kilometers
under favorable conditions, but the success of communication is impaired in noisy
environments (Slabbekoorn et al. 2010). For this reason, we are currently studying the
dynamics of the sound environment in this region to determine the main sources of
sound and how these might affect humpback whale behavior. Additionally, intense
visual observations along with skin sample or biopsy collection will be needed for a
better understanding of the humpback whales’ behavior during the summer and win-
ter in this region.

These findings provide further evidence that singing is not confined to tropical
waters in winter, but occurs in a feeding area in high latitudes. These results empha-
size the importance of Corcovado Gulf for humpback whale conservation and the
need for continued research.
