ABSTRACT

been performed. Clusters of muon neutrinos over the expected atmospheric background have been looked for.
No clear signal has been found. The most signal-like accumulation of events is located at equatorial coordinates

R.A. = −46.◦8 and decl. = −64.◦9 and corresponds to a 2.2σ background fluctuation. In addition, upper limits on
the flux normalization of an E−2 muon neutrino energy spectrum have been set for 50 pre-selected astrophysical
objects. Finally, motivated by an accumulation of seven events relatively close to the Galactic Center in the
recently reported neutrino sample of the IceCube telescope, a search for point sources in a broad region around this
accumulation has been carried out. No indication of a neutrino signal has been found in the ANTARES data and
upper limits on the flux normalization of an E−2 energy spectrum of neutrinos from point sources in that region
have been set. The 90% confidence level upper limits on the muon neutrino flux normalization vary between 3.5
and 5.1 × 10−8 GeV cm−2 s−1, depending on the exact location of the source.

1. INTRODUCTION

The scientific motivation of neutrino telescopes relies on the
unique properties of neutrinos, which can be used to observe
and study the high-energy universe. Cosmic rays or high-
energy photons have intrinsic limitations: the mean free path
of gamma-ray photons strongly depends on their energy, while
magnetic fields deflect cosmic rays, diluting the information
about their origin. Neutrinos are stable, neutral, and weakly
interacting particles, and therefore they point directly back to
their origin. In addition, neutrinos are expected to originate
at the same locations where the acceleration of cosmic rays
and the associated production of high-energy photons take
place (Halzen & Hooper 2002; Stecker 2005; Bednarek et al.
2005). The first evidence of such a cosmic neutrino signal
has recently been reported by IceCube (Aartsen et al. 2013a,
2013c), including in particular a cluster of events close to
the Galactic Center. While this cluster is not statistically
significant, González-Garcı́a et al. (2013) have proposed they
may be due to a single point source. The better view of
the Southern Hemisphere afforded by the ANTARES neutrino
telescope, due to its location in the Mediterranean Sea, provides
an increased sensitivity to galactic sources of neutrinos with
energies <100 TeV. This is particularly important in order to
interpret the cluster of events observed by IceCube close to the
Galactic Center.

In this Letter, the results of the search for point sources with
the data gathered between 2007 and 2012 with the ANTARES
neutrino telescope are presented. After a brief description of
the apparatus, the data selection and the corresponding detector
performance are presented in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. In
Section 4, the search method is explained. The results of the full-
sky and candidate sources searches are presented in Section 5.
The implications on some recent interpretations of the IceCube
results are discussed in Section 6. Finally, the conclusions are
given in Section 7.

2. THE ANTARES NEUTRINO TELESCOPE
AND DATA SELECTION

ANTARES is an underwater neutrino telescope located 40 km
to the South of Toulon (France) in the Mediterranean Sea (42◦48′
N, 6◦10′ E) (Ageron et al. 2011). It is made of 12 slender lines
spaced by about 65 m, anchored on the seabed at 2475 m depth
and maintained vertical by a buoy. Each line of 350 m active
length comprises 25 floors spaced regularly, each housing three
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) looking downward at an angle
of 45◦. The detection principle is based on the observation of
the Cherenkov light induced by muons produced in charged
current interactions of high energy neutrinos inside or near the
detector volume. Some of the emitted photons produce a signal

in the PMTs (“hits”) with the corresponding charge and time
information. The hits are used to reconstruct the direction of
the muon. In addition, other neutrino signatures such as cascade
events are also detected and reconstructed. The current analysis
uses muon tracks only, which offer a better angular resolution
and larger volume than cascades caused by showering events.

High quality runs are selected from data between 2007
January 29 to 2012 December 31. This measurement period
corresponds to a total livetime of 1338 days, which is an
increase of 70% compared to the previous ANTARES point-
source analysis (Adrián-Martı́nez et al. 2012).

Triggered events are reconstructed using the time and position
information of the hits by means of a maximum likelihood (ML)
method (Adrián-Martı́nez et al. 2013). The algorithm consists
of a multi-step procedure to fit the direction of the reconstructed
muon by maximizing the ML-parameter Λ, which describes
the quality of the reconstruction. In addition, the uncertainty of
the track direction angle, β, is calculated. This calculation is
estimated from the uncertainty on the zenith and azimuth angles
drawn from the covariance matrix.

Neutrinos and atmospheric muons are simulated with the
GENHEN (Brunner 2003) and MUPAGE (Carminati et al. 2008;
Bazzotti et al. 2010) packages, respectively. Furthermore, the
propagation of the muon tracks is simulated with the KM3
package (Brunner 2003). A data versus simulation comparison
of the Λ distribution for zenith angles θ with cos θ < 0.1 can
be seen in Figure 1, where the atmospheric neutrino simulation
uses the Bartol flux (Agrawal et al. 1996).

Events are selected following a blind procedure on pseudo-
experiments before performing the analysis on data. The cuts on
reconstructed tracks (Λ > −5.2, β < 1◦, and cos θ < 0.1) are
chosen so that the neutrino flux needed to make a 5σ discovery
in 50% of the experiments is minimized. This selection leads to
a final data sample of 5516 events, which includes an estimated
10% background from mis-reconstructed atmospheric muons.

3. DETECTOR PERFORMANCE

For a neutrino energy spectrum proportional to E−2, the an-
gular resolution and acceptance for events passing the selection
cuts are computed.

An improved modeling of the PMT transit-time distribution
compared to Adrián-Martı́nez et al. (2012) has been used for the
simulation. As a result, the estimated median neutrino angular
resolution is 0.◦38, which corresponds to a 15% improvement.
Figure 2 (left) shows the cumulative distribution of the angle
Ψ between the reconstructed muon direction and the true
neutrino direction. The distribution is represented both for the
whole data set (blue line) and for the previous analysis (dashed
red line).

Figure 1. Cumulative distribution of the track reconstruction quality parameter,
Λ, for tracks with cos θ < 0.1 (mostly upgoing) which have an angular error
estimate β < 1◦. Larger values of the Λ parameter indicate a better track
reconstruction. A better track reconstruction is expected for muon-neutrinos
(no upgoing atmospheric muons are expected). The bottom panel shows the
ratio between data and simulation. The green (red) distribution corresponds to
the simulated atmospheric muons (neutrinos), where a 50% (30%) relative error
was assigned (Aguilar et al. 2010; Barr et al. 2006). Data errors correspond to
statistical errors only.

The “acceptance” is defined as the quantity that multiplied
by a given flux normalization, Φ0, gives the number of signal
events. This quantity is proportional to the detector response
and depends on the source energy spectrum and declination.
The acceptance for a source located at a declination δ is

where the time integration extends over the whole period of
1338 days, Aeff is the neutrino effective area, and a source
spectrum of (dΦ/dEν) = Φ0E−2ν is assumed. The acceptance
as a function of the declination δ is shown in Figure 2 (right).

4. SEARCH METHOD

Signal events are expected to accumulate in clusters over a
background of diffusely distributed atmospheric neutrinos. The
search for clusters is performed using an ML estimation, which
describes the data as a mixture of a signal and background
probability density functions (PDFs):

log Ls+b =

Both the background and the signal PDFs, Bi and Si, re-
spectively, depend on the reconstructed direction, xi = (αi , δi)
(where αi and δi indicate the reconstructed right ascension and
declination, respectively), for the ith event. The parameter ns
represents the expected number of signal events for a particular
source and N, the total number of events in the sample. The
signal PDF is defined as

where xs = (αs , δs) indicates the position of the source,
ψi(xs)

2 ≈ (αi − αs)2 cos2(δs) + (δi − δs)2 indicates the angular
distance to the source, and Ps(N hitsi , βi) is the probability for a
signal event i at a position xi to be reconstructed with an angular
error estimate of βi and a number of hits N hitsi . The number of
hits N hits

i
is a proxy for the energy of the event.

The background PDF is described as

Bi =
B(δi)

2π
Pb

(
N hitsi , βi

)
, (4)

where B(δi) is the probability to find an event at a declination δi
and Pb(N hitsi , βi) is the probability for a background event to be
reconstructed with a number of hits N hits

i
and an angular error

estimate of βi .
The significance of any observation is determined by the test

statistic, TS, which is defined as TS = log Ls+b − log Lb, where
Lb indicates the likelihood value for the background only case
(ns = 0). Larger TS values indicate a lower probability (p-value)
of the observation to be produced by the expected background.

5. FULL-SKY AND CANDIDATE LIST SEARCHES

A full-sky search and a search on a pre-selected list of
candidate sources are performed.

The light-blue markers show the upper limit for any point source located in the
ANTARES visible sky in declination bands of 1◦. The solid blue (red) line
indicates the ANTARES (IceCube) sensitivity for a point-source with an E−2
spectrum as a function of the declination. The blue (red) squares represent
the upper limits for the ANTARES (IceCube) candidate sources. Finally, the
dashed dark blue (red) line indicates the ANTARES (IceCube) sensitivity for a
point-source and for neutrino energies lower than 100 TeV, which shows that
the IceCube sensitivity for sources in the Southern hemisphere is mostly due to
events of higher energy. The IceCube results were derived from Aartsen et al.
(2013b).

(A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)

The full-sky search looks for an excess of signal events
located anywhere in the whole ANTARES visible sky. A pre-
clustering algorithm to select candidate clusters of at least 4
events in a cone of half-opening angle of 3◦ is performed. For
each cluster, Ls+b is maximized by varying the free parameters
xs and ns. In this analysis, the most significant cluster is found
at (α, δ) = (−46.◦8,−64.◦9) with a post-trial p-value of 2.7%
(significance of 2.2σ using the two-sided convention). This
direction is consistent with the most significant cluster found in
the previous analysis. The number of fitted signal events is ns =
6.2. A total of 6 (14) events in a cone of 1◦ (3◦) around the fitted
cluster center are found. Upper limits at the 90% confidence
level (CL) on the muon neutrino flux from point sources located
anywhere in the visible ANTARES sky are given by the light
blue-dashed line in Figure 3. Each value corresponds to the
highest upper-limit obtained in declination bands of 1◦.

The second search uses a list of 50 neutrino candidate-
source positions at which the likelihood is evaluated. The
list of sources with their corresponding pre-trial p-values and
flux upper limits is presented in Table 1. The largest excess
corresponds to HESS J0632+057, with a post-trial p-value of
6.1% (significance of 1.9σ using the two-sided convention). The
fitted number of source events is ns = 1.6. The limits for these 50
selected sources and the overall fixed-source sensitivity of the
telescope are reported in Figure 3. The 90% CL flux upper limits

and sensitivities are calculated by using the Neyman method
(Neyman 1937).

6. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE
RECENT IceCube RESULTS

Following the recent evidence of high energy neutrinos by
IceCube (Aartsen et al. 2013a), a point source close to the
Galactic Center has been proposed to explain the accumu-
lation of seven events in its neighborhood (González-Garcı́a
et al. 2013). The corresponding flux normalization of this hy-
pothetical source (α = −79◦, δ = −23◦) is expected to be
Φ0 = 6 × 10−8 GeV cm−2 s−1.

This hypothetical source might be located at a different
point in the sky due to the large uncertainty of the direction
estimates of these IceCube events. The full-sky algorithm with
the likelihood presented in Adrián-Martı́nez et al. (2012) is
used, restricted to region of 20◦ around the proposed location.
The trial factor of this analysis is smaller than in the full-sky
search because of the smaller size of the region. In addition to the
point source hypothesis, three Gaussian-like source extensions
are assumed (0.◦5, 1◦ and 3◦). As in the full-sky search, a half
opening angle of 3◦ is used for the pre-clustering selection for
source widths smaller than 3◦. In the case of the 3◦ source
assumption, the angle is of 6◦.

No significant cluster has been found. Figure 4 shows the 90%
CL flux upper limits obtained for the four assumed different
spatial extensions of the neutrino source as a function of
the declination. The presence of a point source with a flux
normalization of 6×10−8 GeV cm−2 s−1 anywhere in the region
is excluded. Therefore, the excess found by IceCube in this
region cannot be caused by a single point source. Furthermore,
a source width of 0.◦5 for declinations lower than −11◦ is also
excluded. For an E−2 spectrum, neutrinos with E > 2 PeV
contribute only 7% to the event rate, hence these results are
hardly affected by a cutoff at energies on the order of PeV.

7. CONCLUSION

In this Letter, the results of a search for neutrino point
sources with six years of ANTARES data (2007–2012) are
presented using two complementary analyses: first, a scan
for point sources of the ANTARES visible sky; second, a
search for correlations of events with a pre-selected list of
candidate sources for neutrino emission. In the first case,
the most significant cluster has a post-trial p-value of 2.7%
(a significance of 2.2σ ). In the case of the candidate list study,
the largest excess corresponds to HESS J0632+057 with a post-
trial p-value of 6.1% (1.9σ ). Both results are compatible with a
pure background hypothesis. The derived flux upper limits are
the most restrictive in a significant part of the Southern sky. The
possibility that the accumulation of seven events reported by
IceCube near the Galactic Center is produced by a single point
source has been excluded. These results show the potential of
neutrino telescopes in the Northern hemisphere, such as the
planned KM3NeT observatory (Leisos et al. 2013), to interpret
the increasing evidence of cosmic neutrino fluxes.
