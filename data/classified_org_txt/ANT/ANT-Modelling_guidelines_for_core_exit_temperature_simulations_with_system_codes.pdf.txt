Abstract

Core exit temperature (CET) measurements play an important role in the sequence of actions under
accidental conditions in pressurized water reactors (PWR). Given the difficulties in placing measurements
in the core region, CET readings are used as criterion for the initiation of accident management (AM)
procedures because they can indicate a core heat up scenario. However, the CET responses have some
limitation in detecting inadequate core cooling and core uncovery simply because the measurement is not
placed inside the core. Therefore, it is of main importance in the field of nuclear safety for PWR power
plants to assess the capabilities of system codes for simulating the relation between the CET and the peak
cladding temperature (PCT).

The work presented in this paper intends to address this open question by making use of experimental
work at integral test facilities (ITF) where experiments related to the evolution of the CET and the PCT
during transient conditions have been carried out. In particular, simulations of two experiments performed
at the ROSA/LSTF and PKL facilities are presented. The two experiments are part of a counterpart exercise
between the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 and OECD/NEA PKL-2 projects.

The simulations are used to derive guidelines in how to correctly reproduce the CET response during
a core heat up scenario. Three aspects have been identified to be of main importance: (1) the need for a
3-dimensional representation of the core and Upper Plenum (UP) regions in order to model the heterogeneity
of the power zones and axial areas, (2) the detailed representation of the active and passive heat structures,
and (3) the use of simulated thermocouples instead of steam temperatures to represent the CET readings.

1. Introduction

Core exit temperature (CET) measurements play an important role in the sequence of actions under
accidental conditions in pressurized water reactors (PWR). Given the difficulties in placing measurements
in the core region, CET readings are used as criterion for the initiation of accident management (AM)
procedures because they can indicate a core heat up scenario. Within the OECD countries, the CET
readings are used in: Emergency Operation Procedures (EOP) as a prevention of AM, the transition from
EOP to Severe Accident Management Guidelines (SAMG), in SAMG (mitigation AM) and, in some cases,
in emergency planning (Tóth et al., 2010). However, the CET responses may present some limitations in
detecting inadequate core cooling and core uncovery since the corresponding thermocouples (TC) cannot be
placed directly inside the core cavity for technical and operational reasons. Therefore, differences between
the CET and the peak cladding temperature (PCT) are expected. In fact, whenever the CET indicates the

presence of superheated steam it is always with certain delay and the steam temperature at the location
of the TC will be always lower than the actual maximum cladding temperature in the core. Therefore,
core uncovery will be unnoticed during a certain period of time. Considering these known limitations, it
is important for the safety of the PWRs, and in particular for the design of EOPs and SAMGs, to assess
the capabilities of system codes to simulate the relation between the CET and the PCT under accidental
conditions.

Experimental results obtained at the Large Scale Test Facility (LSTF) within the OECD/NEA ROSA-1
project (Suzuki et al., 2009) suggested that the response of the CET thermocouples could be inadequate to
initiate the relevant AM actions. In particular, during Test 6-1 (Takeda et al., 2006), a small break loss-
of-coolant-accident (SBLOCA), it was observed that core uncovery started well before CET thermocouples
reported sufficient high temperatures (Takeda et al., 2007). In order to address this issue, the Committee
on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (CSNI) launched activities to review the current state of knowledge
on the CET performance and related AM procedures. As a result, the CSNI delivered a report in 2010
with conclusions and recommendations on the issue (Tóth et al., 2010). The CSNI concluded that current
thermal-hydraulic system codes used to model and analyze the CET performance may not be sufficiently
validated and recommended to verify to what extent state-of-the-art system codes are able to reproduce
the delay and differences between rod surface temperatures and CET readings. The CSNI report concluded
that further research should be dedicated, among others, at the following activities:

• Assessment of physical models to predict heat transfer modes affecting CET behavior

• Development of a ”best practice guidelines” for the nodalization approach of the uncovered core section
up to the point of CET location

• Based on comparison results, assessment of the possible impact of 3-D effects not modelled in these
codes

• Investigate the problem of CETs issue ”scaling” (methods of extrapolating) from experimental facilities
size, like LSTF, to commercial PWR reactors

The work presented in this paper intends to address these open questions by making use of experimental
work at integral test facilities (ITF) where experiments related to the evolution of the CET and the PCT
during transient conditions have been carried out. Actually, following the recommendations of the CSNI
report, a link between two OECD/NEA projects (the ROSA-2 and the PKL-2 projects) was established with
the intention to carry out a counterpart experiment. Both the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 and the OECD/NEA
PKL-2 projects aimed to resolve key light water reactor thermal-hydraulics safety issues. The former con-
sisted of experiments at the ROSA/LSTF operated by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) while the
latter was based on experiments at the Primärkreislauf-Versuchsanlage (primary coolant loop test facility)
PKL operated by AREVA NP. In particular, Test 3 of the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 project and Test G7.1 of
the PKL facility were designed as counterpart experiments with the aim of studying the evolution of the
CET in comparison to the PCT.

The counterpart experiments represented a hot leg SBLOCA scenario with additional system failures,
namely: total failure of the high pressure safety injection (HPSI) system combined with no secondary side
anticipated cool down. In this scenario, AM measures are essential to prevent unacceptable core heat-up. In
the experiment, a secondary depressurization is employed as AM measure to restore the heat sink through
fast reduction of the primary pressure leading to a passive Accumulators (Acc) injection and followed by
the low pressure safety injection (LPSI). The AM is initiated by the observance of a high CET.

In addition to the differences in geometry, scale and design between the two facilities, the PKL facility
has a maximum allowed primary side pressure of 50 bars while the ROSA/LSTF facility operates at full
pressure of a PWR (160 bars). This limitation further complicated the definition of the counterpart boundary
conditions as this will be explained in Section 2 with more details.

1.1. Phenomenology

During a core heat up scenario, the fuel rod cladding temperature increases above the saturation tem-
perature due to insufficient core cooling. Some of the excess heat is transferred from the rod surface to the
surrounding fluid. The fluid continiously flow upwards by means of convection to the CET located above
the Upper Core Plate (UCP). In its way to the upper plenum (UP) plenum the fluid has a continuos heat
exchange to the metal structures (both heated and unheated). Heat is finally delivered to the CET sensor,
when the fluid reaches the UP. As a result, there will always be a time delay between the PCT occurrance
and its detection at the CET thermocouple. Another important aspect to consider in the process is the
thermal inertia of the internals which leads to a non-stationary heat transfer configuration between the core
cavity and the UP. Therefore, the temperature reading at the CET location will not only be delayed but
also dampened in comparison to the actual PCT.

Experimental studies have been carried out to assess the performance of CET measurements for PWRs
in several ITFs. Of particular interest is the review presented by Tóth et al. (2010) where results obtained
at the LOFT, PKL, ROSA/LSTF and PSB test facilities are summarized. The experimental work served
to analyze the phenomenology associated with the CET response to a core heat up scenario. The different
studies were conducted independently but reached similar conclusions on the physical phenomena that
influence the evolution of the CET as a function of the maximum cladding temperature in the core. The
study is used in this work to identify what are the needs for the correct simulation of a scenario where CET
response play an important role:

• The steam velocity distribution throughout the core cavity, which will depend on the break size and
location but also on the radial and axial details, the different pass-through areas throughout the core
and UP regions.

• The relatively weak heat transfer from the rod surface to the surrounding steam due to low steam
velocities during boil-off.

• Inside and above the core, the axial and radial core power profile and, to a lower extent, the effects of
core barrel and heat losses.

• Cooling effect of the unheated structures in the upper part of the core cavity and above.

• Mixing effects in the core and UP due to internals, grid spacers and nonuniform radial power distri-
bution.

• Water backflow from the hot legs during core heat up due to steam condensation in the Steam Genera-
tor (SG) tubes, pressurizer water fall down or water from hot leg ECC injection. These two phenomena
may lead to wetted or unwetted thermocouples.

One additional physical phenomenon not listed in the above mentioned reference but that could influence
the measurements above the upper core plate is thermal radiation from the fuel rods which can be significant
during the core heat up phase when fuel rod temperature may reach up to 1000 K.

In order to adequately capture all these phenomena, a detailed reproduction of the passive and active
heat structures must be provided. In addition, radial power and the steam velocities distribution should be
reproduced. Details on how to model these aspects with system codes are given in Section 4.

2. The OECD/NEA ROSA-2 and PKL-2 counterpart experiment

Following an agreement between the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 and PKL-2 projects two similar experiments
were conducted at the ROSA/LSTF and PKL test facilities, respectively, to result in a set of counterpart
experiments for the simulation at different scales and pressures of the same accidental configurations leading
to core heat up and reflooding sequences.

ROSA/LSTF is an experimental facility operated by JAEA, it is designed to simulate a Westinghouse-
type 4-loop 3,420 MWth PWR under accidental conditions (The ROSA-V Group, 2003). It is a full-height

3



and 1/48 volumetrically-scaled two-loop system with a maximum core power of 10 MW (14 % of the scaled
PWR nominal core power) and pressures scaled 1:1. Loops are sized to conserve volumetric factor (2/48)
and to simulate the same flow regime transitions in the horizontal legs (preserving L/

√

(D) factor). The
core power is distributed over 20 fuel assemblies with 3 different power peaking factors, all assemblies have
the same cosine-shaped axial power distribution.

PKL is an ITF that reproduces the entire primary system and most of the secondary system (except for
the turbine and condenser) of a 1300-MW PWR plant operated by AREVA (Kremin et al., 2001). It is based
on a 4-loop Siemens design (KWU), with elevations scaled 1:1 and volumes and power reduced by a factor
of 145. The number of rods in the core and the U-tubes in the steam generator has been divided by 145
as well, following the power to volume scaling criterion. The core is modeled by 314 electrical heater rods
with a flat axial power profile and homogeneous radial distribution. PKL simulates all four loops separately.
The operating pressure of the PKL facility is limited to 45 bars on the primary side and to 56 bars on the
secondary side. This nevertheless allows simulation over a wide temperature range (522K to 322K), while
requiring test procedure adaptations to address the high-pressure initial phase of typical PWR SBLOCA
sequences.

In addition to the differences in geometry, scale and design between the two facilities the difference in
the maximum allowed primary pressure between the two facilities further complicates the definition of the
counterpart boundary conditions because the core uncovery and increase of the CET typically occur in the
range of pressures from 60 to 80 bars. In order to model the event at the intended pressure and perform
a counterpart experiment with the PKL facility, Test 3 of the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 project was divided
in three phases: a high pressure transient as it would occur in a normal PWR, a conditioning phase to
bring the facility to a pseudo-steady state at around 50 bars, and a low pressure transient where the same
transient is reproduced once again at a lower pressure corresponding to the operational pressure of the PKL
facility. In turn, the initial conditions of the PKL facility were set to the same conditions as those of the
ROSA-2 Test 3 low pressure phase.

2.1. ROSA-2 Test 3

The boundary conditions of the counterpart experiment are shown in Table 1, the high pressure transient
was only performed in the ROSA/LSTF facility while the low pressure transient was carried out in both
test facilities. The test is initiated by opening a valve located in the upper side of the hot leg with a throat
opening of 1.5% of the cold leg area (Takeda et al., 2012). At the same time, loss of offsite power is assumed
thus leading to the shut down of the primary pumps and the unavailability of the HPSI and the main
feedwater system. Due to the loss of coolant, a steep depressurization of the primary system takes place
and the SCRAM signal is reached. As a consequence, the main steam isolation valves are closed causing an
increase of the secondary pressure. The set-points for the opening of the secondary side relief valves are soon
reached and the secondary pressure oscillates around these setpoints following the intermittent openings and
closings of the valve. Since HPSI is unavailable, the primary system is continuously loosing coolant. When
the coolant level in the system decreases below the hot leg connection to the UP, the break flow turns into
single phase steam flow. In this case the primary system pressure will decrease below the secondary pressure
and core boil off will initiate. An increase of the cladding temperature and the CET will follows thereafter.

A conditioning phase is carried out after the high pressure transient to bring the system to a stable
reflux condensation state at around 45 bars and a reduced primary coolant inventory equivalent to the
initial conditions of the PKL Test G7.1. The main steam relief valve set-points are modified to bring the
system towards these conditions. When the system is stabilized, the break valve is opened again and the
low pressure transient begins. Further actions during this phase are (the same actions are performed in the
PKL Test G7.1):

• Initiation of SG secondary-side depressurization by fully opening the relief valves, and initiation of the
auxiliary feedwater (AFW) system in both loops as AM action. These actions are performed when
the maximum core exit temperature reaches 623 K.

• Initiation of Acc injection when the primary pressure reaches 26 bars.

• Initiation of the LPSI when the pressure in the lower plenum of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV)
reaches 10 bars.

2.2. PKL Test G7.1

PKL G7.1 counterpart test reproduces the same conditions as in the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 Test 3 (Schoen
et al., 2012). The experiment starts with a filled primary system and nominal steady state conditions. A
conditioning phase is performed to reduce the primary mass inventory and bring the facility to reflux
condensation conditions at around 45 bars. The initial test conditions are reached after secondary side
pressurization. The primary level collapsed down to mixture state condition at SG chambers by temporarily
opening the break until the primary side mass inventory reaches 40%. The fill level of the SGs secondary side
is brought from 12 m down to 8 m for consistency with the ROSA/LSTF facility. The obtained steady state
conditions represent the PKL G7.1 counterpart of the ROSA/LSTF test conditions prior and correspond to
stable reflux condensation conditions.

The low pressure transient is started by opening the break simulator located on the hot leg. Since the
break is small, the reflux condensation conditions are maintained and the system pressure does not decrease.

The system however continuously losses coolant due to the unavailability of the HPSI. The primary system
pressure starts falling when the break flow turns into single phase vapor because the energy released through
the break becomes larger than the one generated in the core, in the same manner as it occurred in the high
pressure transient. This leads to the boil off of the core coolant and the subsequent core uncovery and CET
increase.

3. Simulation of the system behaviour of the counterpart experiment

The OECD/NEA ROSA-2 Test 3 has been simulated by making use of two distinct thermal-hydraulic
codes TRACE and RELAP5Mod3.3, both developed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(US-NRC) while, PKL Test G7.1 has been carried out only with the RELAP5Mod3.3 code. The TRACE
version used is TRACE V5.0 provided with in-house modifications to the choked flow model under single
phase steam conditions.

In the following sub-sections the nodalization and the results in terms of system behaviour are described.
Detailed explanations on the system code capabilities and modelling approaches related to the physical
phenomena listed in Section 1.1 will be provided in Section 4.

3.1. The ROSA/LSTF TRACE nodalization

The TRACE model of the LSTF has been developed by the Paul Scherrer Institut and has been validated
over the simulation of several ROSA/LSTF tests (Freixa and Manera, 2012, 2010; Freixa et al., 2013a). The
model (Figure 1) consists of a 3-Dimensional vessel component, two separate loops with two steam generators
and a pressurizer. The 3-D vessel component is composed of 22 axial levels, 4 radial rings and 4 azimuthal
sectors. The three inner rings cover the core region and the fourth ring represents the vessel Downcomer
(DC). The heater rods are simulated by means of 12 heat structures, one per sector in the radial plane.
The rods are grouped in three categories according to the power regions of the LSTF. 8 pipes were used to
represent the 8 control rod guide tubes (CRGTs). Details of specific modelling of the break and other code
options are listed in Table 2. Further details on the simulation of Test 3 with this nodalization were given
by Freixa et al. (2013b).

3.2. The ROSA/LSTF RELAP5 nodalization

The ROSA/LSTF RELAP5 nodalization has been previously qualified for the OECD/NEA ROSA-1
Tests 3.1 3.2 (Martinez-Quiroga et al., 2012a,b). The full model nodalization used in the present work is
shown in Figure 2. The core and upper plenum regions were updated in order to better reproduce the radial
power distribution in the core and other phenomena important for Test 3 of the ROSA/LSTF rig. The
core region is simulated by 13 parallel channels with 20 axial nodes (the last two cells represent the region
around the UCP). The 13 channels correspond to fuel assemblies or groups of fuel assemblies having the
same power. Cartesian crossflows were used to distribute them radially. The 8 CRGTs were modelled with 8
distinct pipes connected to the corresponding channel at the bottom and all connected to the same volume
that represents the Upper Head (UH). These modifications were reported in detail by Martinez-Quiroga
et al. (2014). Details of specific modelling of the break and other code options are listed in Table 2.

3.3. The PKL RELAP5 nodalization

The simulation of the PKL Test G7.1 experiment were conducted on a qualified RELAP5 nodalization
(Freixa et al., 2009). The core and upper plenum regions were renodalized with three parallel channels
(Martinez-Quiroga et al., 2014).

The PKL and ROSA/LSTF RELAP5 nodalizations have been cross-compared using a scaling methodol-
ogy presented by Martinez-Quiroga and Reventos (2014). The methodology was applied to the counterpart
experiment by (Martinez-Quiroga et al., 2014), thus demonstrating the equivalence of both nodalizations in
the reproduction of the thermal-hydraulics phenomenology during this transient. Details of specific mod-
elling of the break and other code options are listed in Table 2.

3.4. High pressure transient (ROSA/LSTF)

The most relevant results of the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 Test 3 are displayed in Figure 3 for the TRACE
calculation and in Figure 4 for the RELAP5 calculation. Both figures show the primary and secondary
pressures, maximum PCT, break flow and hot leg level and the RPV collapsed water levels.

The results obtained with both codes for the high pressure sequence are in quite close agreement with
the experimental data. The primary and secondary pressures follow a similar evolution as in the experiment
proving adequate performance of the choked flow in all its phases (subcooled, 2-phase and steam flow).

As can be seen in both figures, the water levels during this phase are well predicted by the two models
except for a slightly under-predicted DC level. The reduction of the core level is well predicted and occurs
almost at the same time as in the experiment thus allowing for a good prediction of the PCT increase.

Figure 5 shows the evolution of the PCT and the highest CET measurement during the time window
when core uncovery takes place. There is a slight time shift of the start of core uncovery although the
slope at which the PCT increases is very similar in all cases. There is a clear difference in the delay time
between the start of the PCT increase and the CET increase. While the experiment has a time delay of
approximately 70 seconds, the delay in the two calculations is of about 30 seconds. Another discrepancy is
observed when the core is largely uncovered, in this period the CET temperature in the TRACE calculation
increases faster than in the experiment.

3.5. Low pressure transient (ROSA/LSTF)

The general trends of the behaviour of the system are also well captured by both models during the low
pressure transient of ROSA/LSTF. The RELAP5 calculation for the low pressure transient presents slightly
better results. In the TRACE calculation, the distribution of the coolant in the primary system presents
some discrepancies with the experiment. Although the total mass inventory and system pressure are the
same at the start of the test, the water level in the DC is lower in the calculation which indicates a slightly

different distribution of coolant in the primary system. In the TRACE calculation, the initial phase (around
3200s) is characterized by an anticipated and longer duration of the two-phase flow conditions at the break
location. As the transient continues, one can observe a rather good simulation of the core and UP levels,
whereas the DC mass of coolant is underestimated.

All in all, the results are in quite close agreement with the experiment throughout the whole test per-
mitting an analysis in detail of the CET evolution as function of the PCT.

3.6. Low pressure transient (PKL)

The initial conditions in the calculation were achieved in accordance to the experiment. Figure 6 displays
the most relevant parameters in terms of system behaviour (primary and secondary pressures, PCT, break
mass flow and RPV water levels). The results follow closely the experimental data. Differences are observed
after the secondary depressurization is triggered.

In the RELAP5 calculation the depressurization is sufficient to ensure complete reflooding of the core,
a result not confirmed by the experiment where accumulator injection was needed in order to achieve this.
This difference however does not influence the evolution of the CET and the PCT during core uncovery,
which is the main purpose of the present study.

4. Methodology for the reproduction of the CET

This section presents the relevant aspects of the modeling approach that were implemented to analyze
the physical phenomena that play a significant role in the evolution of the CET as a function of the PCT
in the proposed experiments. In addition, the aspects where the code has limitations were identified.

In Section 1.1, the most relevant physical phenomena that the code should be able to represent have been
listed. The heat transfer packages of TRACE and RELAP5 have been widely validated with the support
of experimental data (The RELAP5 Code Development Team, 2001; United States Nuclear Regulatory

Commission, 2007; Aksan et al., 1993). Therefore, we can assume that both codes perform sufficiently well
to calculate the heat transferred between the fluid and the heat structures (heated and unheated). In this
sense, it is not the intention of the authors to address the adequacy of the heat transfer packages of the two
codes (to do so, the analysis of separate effect test data would be more indicated). The work is rather focused
on how to correctly simulate the complex flow velocity distribution and fluid-structure thermal interactions
in the upper part of the core cavity and upstream and around the TCs. This assumption simplifies the
problem to the reproduction of four aspects: the correct representation of the heat structures (heated and
unheated), the distribution of steam velocities in the region, the fluid mixing in the region, and the water
backflow from the hot legs.

Since the PKL Test G7.1 was carried out with flat axial and radial power profiles, the PCT took place
at the top of the core and at a rather short distance from the CET location. In addition, the distribution of
steam velocities and temperatures were rather homogeneous, therefore most of the following guidelines are
primarily related to the ROSA/LSTF pressure vessel nodalization.

4.1. 3-D representation of the core and UP regions and CRGTs

The steam temperatures and velocities at the core outlet during boil-off will have a heterogeneous radial
distribution. This is a consequence of the radial power profiles, the possible liquid flowback from the hot legs
and the non-homogeneous size of openings through the core. In order to capture these radial hetereogenities,
a 3-D representation of the simulation domain is essential.

In the opinion of the authors, the pseudo 3-D capabilities of current two-phase thermal-hydraulic system
codes, based on inviscid flow assumption (except for interactions with wall and phase-interfaces) should be
able to capture these details. The hydraulic simulation domain is indeed densely populated with internals
(e.g. fuel rods) thus reducing the importance of shear stress in the fluid below the UCP. In the lower part of
the UP, local secondary flow patterns should also be outplayed by the pressure gradient induced by the break
and the SG heat sink, by the stack effect due to the CRGTs, and by the liquid flowing back from the hot
legs. The nodalization must however be sufficiently detailed to take into account the different power zones
(or most relevant power zones), possible differences in hole sizes (and shape dependant singular pressure
loss coefficients) in the axial planes and non-uniform distribution of passive heat structures. The radial
nodalization of the RELAP and TRACE at the UCP elevation for the ROSA/LSTF facility are displayed
in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. Each box in the grid represents a vertical pipe which corresponds to the
actual geometry. The circles represent the actual openings at the UCP, the areas and hydraulic diameters
are calculated according to the correspondent geometry of each cell. As can be seen, the two nodalizations
are of comparable refinement and resulted in a more appropriate description of the distribution of holes
through the UCP. The openings of the UCP of ROSA/LSTF are very heterougenous in terms of size, and
this aspect will have a significant influence in the results. It is important to notice that a typical PWR UCP
presents a much more uniform distribution and size of orifices and therefore this effect might be secondary.
The same distribution of nodes in the radial plane shown in Figures 7 and 8 is used along the core and UP
regions.

4.2. Heat Structures

All passive heat structures should be accounted to describe the thermal inertia of this part of the vessel.
This includes, unheated fuel rods, support columns, UCP, the endbox and the CRGTs. The cylindrical
elements are modeled with a cylindrical geometry were the total volume and the total heat transfer area
(HTA) should be preserved. As for the modeling of the UCP, the authors suggest using two distinct heat
structures in order to account for the two possible heat transfer directions. The geometry of the UCP is
shown in Figure 9. The UCP transfers heat in two directions: axially from the top of the core to the UP
and in the radial plane from the holes inner surface to the holes flow path (red lines in Figure 9).

In order to model a passive metal structure in a system code, two important parameters should be
adequately described, namely the heat transfer area (HTA) and the total volume of metal. All the hydraulic
volume(s) that can exchange heat with the structure should also be defined. To do so, the UCP can be split
in two components. In the first component, which captures the heat transfer in the radial direction, the

HTA of the structure will be equal to the perimeter of the holes multiplied by the thickness of the plate.
As for the component describing the heat transfer in the axial direction, the HTA is equal to the area of
the slab minus the area of the holes. The structure associated to radial heat transfer is linked to the axial
level that represents the UCP thickness (were high fluid velocity are expected), while the flat slab is linked
to the axial level above and below the UCP.

In the present study, no heat is exchanged between the two structures and the UCP volume is split
proportionally between the two structures according to their respective value of the HTA:

Figure 10 displays the power transferred from the two UCP structures to the hydraulic cells in the radial,
downward and upward directions for the TRACE calculation of the ROSA-2 Test 3. During steady state,
the heat transfer in the holes region is zero because the structure is in thermal equilibrium with the linked
hydraulic cell. The bottom and top of the flat slab present positive and negative heat transfer because the
fluid in the top of the core is warmer than in the UP. But during the core heat up process of the high and
low pressure transients, the heat transfer in the radial direction is higher than in the axial direction, as a
consequence of the high steam velocities through the holes. Moreover, the UCP essentially absorbs heat
from all sides during the core heat up sequences, thus further dampening the transfer of heat up to the
locations of the TC. Therefore, these results emphasize the importance of using a proper nodalization of the
UCP in order to correctly capture important local thermal effects influencing the CET responses.

4.3. Effects of Thermal Radiation

The RELAP5 code does have a model to simulate thermal radiation effects between heat structures
in a defined enclosure. The surfaces that have a line-of-sight or a reflection path through which they can

16



communicate with each other can be considered to be in the same enclosure. The computation method used
in the RELAP5 code is a lumped-system approximation for gray diffuse surfaces contained in an enclosure.
Basically, the user must define the heat structures that compose the enclosure, the emisivity of each material
and the relative view factors. This model is only effective when high temperature differences between surfaces
are expected, therefore this will only represent heat tranfer between active and passive heat structures.

The authors of this work considered that this phenomenon will not play a significant role in the evolution
of the CET TC mainly because the TC is not in the same enclosure as the fuel rods. In the particular case
of LSTF, the following are some additional points that support this statement:

• Radiation intensity from rather low heater rod surface temperature with almost tangential angle to
the location of CET TC. The highest temperature portion (max.900 K)

• Influence of radiation absorption by dense steam under high pressure

• The CET measurement is located far from the top end of effective heating range of simulated fuel rods
(¿ 40cm)

• Obstructing components in between the top end of effective heating and CET TC: 1 spacer grid, the
endbox (2 cm thickness) and UCP of 8 cm. A detailed drawing of this region of LSTF can be found
in Figure 3.4.2-2 of ref. (Tóth et al., 2010).

• Solid angle from some (not all) of CET TC surface to heater rod surface. Some of TC do not face to
heater rod surface. A detailed description of the location of the CET TC in the LSTF can be found
in ref. (Suzuki et al., 2009)

• Color (very dark) of oxydized SUS surface through long-term exposure to high temperature water and
steam, causing very small light reflection

• Chopped-cosine power profile along the length (height) of the core leads to lower power at the top
portion of heater rods. This means that the highest cladding temperature occurs around 2 m far from
the CET TC

4.4. Steam Velocities

Another important aspect of the modeling of the CET response is to correctly predict the steam velocities
at the core cavity outlet, as this will determine the time of transit from the heated up region to the UP as
well as the convective heat transfer coefficient between the steam flow and the UCP. To do so, the exact
geometry of the holes should be described. Figures 7 and 8 display the distribution and size of holes of the
UCP, together with the radial distribution of the cells in the TRACE and RELAP5 nodalizations for the core
and UCP regions. One can notice that some radial sectors include very large holes, while in other sectors
the flow is nearly blocked by the UCP. The nodalization of the UCP openings was modified accordingly. As
shown in Figure 8 in the TRACE nodalization two zones have nearly no openings, these two connections
were nodalized with a null area.

The steam velocities will additionally be affected by the location and openings of the CRGTs because
the direct connection to the rather cold and stagnant flow conditions in the UH might accelerate the flow
in certain locations (stack effect).

4.5. Fluid Mixing

Fluid mixing in the region between the quench front and the CET location will have an impact on the
final steam temperatures detected by the CET measurement. This region will be filled mainly by pure
steam.

The fluid mixing in this area will be primarily driven by the axial and radial pressure gradients, which
will in turn be governed by the core power distribution, the geometrical details and the viscous stresses.
As discussed in Section 4.1, despite the known limitations of system codes with respect to the simulation
of complex 3-D flow configurations, the expected flow configuration in this region of the vessel should be
captured relatively well, through careful modeling of the geometry and power distribution.

4.6. Water Backflow and location of the CET measurement

Adams and Mccreery (1983) pointed out that during experiments at the LOFT facility, slow drainage of
liquid from the upper plenum coated the core exit TCs with a liquid film during core uncovery. Adams and
Mccreery (1983) mentioned that for a CET TC to respond to an inadequate core cooling condition, this film
had to be removed by one or more of the following mechanisms: additional heat flux to boil it off, primary
system depressurization to flash the film to vapor, or sufficient steam velocity to strip it off. Finally, it was
stated that only when this film was removed the CET TC were equal to the vapor temperatures at the core
exit. Often, the CET evolution is represented in system codes by plotting the steam temperature, a readily
available variable in the system codes. According to these findings, this assumption will not be correct when
liquid is present in the vicinity of the TC.

In the present study, instead of considering the steam temperature variable, the CET temperature
has been obtained by simulating the TC explicitly. Thus, considering that the TC should be in thermal
equilibrium with the outer wall of the sensor itself, therefore, one can simulate the TC by adding a heat
structure having the size and the thermophysical properties of a thermocouple. Such heat structure has
been included in each core exit node. The wall surface temperature of this heat structure is used as CET
reading instead of the steam temperature. A detail of the nodalization of this region is provided in Figure
11.

5. Results

Maximum cladding temperatures as function of the CET measurements for the two transient sequences
of the ROSA-2 Test 3 (the high and low pressure events) are shown in Figures 12, 13, 14 and 15. The
black circles show the experimental values obtained at the CET thermocouple that reported the highest
temperatures, and the black squares display the CET TC that showed the lowest temperatures. The TC
temperatures calculated in all the nodes just above the UCP are plotted in red. We can observe that
the CET(PCT) evolution is strongly dependent on the planar location. The 3-D approach was useful to
reproduce a spread of temperatures above the core.

One can observe that initially the curves depart from the equilibrium condition (PCT=CET) with a
nearly vertical slope. This represents the initial phase of the core uncovery and indicates an increase of the
PCT while the steam temperatures above the core remain at saturation conditions. During this phase the

operators would not see any indication (steam superheating) of the initiation of a core heat up. Indeed, the
superheated steam may be fully cooled by the passive heat structures before reaching the CET TC. Another
phenomenon that induces this initial vertical increase is the one related to the experimental observations
given by Adams and Mccreery (1983) who indicated that a film of liquid water forms around the TC and
superheating will not be detected until the film dries out. It can be seen that this initial vertical slope is
much longer in the experiment than in the calculations. The vertical lines in the RELAP5 calculations does
not depend on the location, as opposed to the TRACE calculation where the departure from the vertical
line is strongly dependent on the radial and azimuthal location.

After this initial increase, the curve slope of the PCT as a function of the hottest CET is similar in all
cases. Some of the TRACE curves are below the experimental data showing a slight overprediction of the
CET value and therefore would provide anticipated AM measures. The variability in the CET responses
as function of the radial location is also indicative of the importance of the selection of the locations of the
CET sensors with respect to the EOP.

Regarding the evolution of the cold CET spots, one can find similarities between the experimental and
the calculated values although the results are highly affected by uncertainties. The higher upward vertical
flow should take place in the zone with higher power whereas lower, colder (possibly downward) steam flows
may take place in the peripherical low power zones. As discussed in Section 4.1, system codes are not well
equipped to predict such complex 3-D flow patterns. Therefore, as observed in Figures 12, 13, 14 and 15,
larger discrepancies between calculation results and experiment are to be expected in the low power low
flow zones of the UCP.

It is important to highlight that some CET results obtained by TRACE kept unresponsive to the PCT,
thus indicating that the corresponding TC did not detect any superheated steam (vertical red lines in Figures
14 and 15). A plausible explanation is that sufficient liquid remained in the corresponding hydraulic cells
to keep the TC heat structures wetted. The void fraction distribution in the UP as obtained by TRACE
and RELAP5 for the high pressure transient are shown in Figure 16. Indeed, two cells above the core in
the TRACE nodalization remained with a considerable fraction of liquid, this two cells correspond to the
cells that are not directly connected to the core cavity below, representing the regions of the UCP with no
openings (see Figure 8 and Section 4.4). At these locations, the simulation of dedicated heat structures to
model the TC response is essential. Figure 17 compares steam temperatures and surface temperatures of
the corresponding TC heat structures in different locations right above the UCP. The black and red curves
correspond to the locations with zero opening to the core cavity. In these hydraulic cells the steam and
surface temperatures present very different behaviours. Since a small amount of liquid remains in the cell
which can neither be vaporised by upward flowing superheated steam from the core nor can flow down in
the core cavity, the code estimates it to form a thin layer around the heat structures Therefore the steam in
the cell is superheated while the surface temperature is at saturation conditions. The blue and green curves
in the bottom graph of Figure 17 correspond to locations where the cell has been completely dried out and
in these cases the surface and steam temperatures are almost equal. This results show that system codes,
provided with adequate nodalization, are able to reproduce the experimental observations pointed out by
Adams and Mccreery (1983).

Figure 18 shows the maximum cladding temperatures as a function of the CET for the PKL Test G7.1.
The calculated results are in close agreement with the experimental data. The initial vertical increase is
well reproduced and the slope that follows is also in accordance to the experiment results. As can be
seen, both the experiment and the calculation provided homogenous results at the core exit. This result
is not surprising due to the elongated shape of the pressure vessel of the PKL facility, combined with the
homogeneous perforation of the UCP (one opening per fuel rod simulator) and the uniform axial and radial
power distribution employd for the Test G7.1.In this sense, the study of Test G7.1 further confirms the
soundness and applicability of the nodalization principles to more homogeneous geometries and core power
distributions.

6. Conclusions

Two experiments, Test 3 of the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 and Test G7.1 of the OECD/NEA PKL-2 projects,
composing the counterpart exercise have been simulated by making use of the RELAP5 and TRACE system
codes. The main objective of the counterpart experiments and simulations was to analyze the performance
of the CET measurements during a core heat up scenario following an SBLOCA event. The nodalizations
were able to reproduce generally well the system behaviour of the two ITFs and thus were suitable for a
more detailed analysis of the relation between the CET and the PCT.

Following recommendations from Tóth et al. (2010), the simulations have been carried out with the
intention of defining a methodology to correctly reproduce the performance of the TCs located at the core
exit. The important physical phenomenology that the code should reproduce have been identified and
general guidelines on how to reproduce them with current system codes have been proposed. Three main
aspects were identified to be crucial to correctly model the CET temperature: (1) a detailed modelling of
the passive heat structures in the core and UP regions, (2) an accurate modelling of the geometrical aspects
of the core and UP regions including the CRGTs and (3) the simulation of the TCs by using dedicated heat
structures instead of the usage of the default steam temperatures provided by the code. When adopting these
principles, a 3-D representation of the region could provide a good account of the heterogeneous conditions
in the region. In this sense, both RELAP and TRACE system codes showed to be suitable to analyze the
CET-PCT issue.

The employed nodalization methodology produced heterogeneous results at the core exit in the same
manner as in the experiments. Uncertainties were seen to be specially high for the core exit zones that
reported lower temperatures. This promising results call for further assessment studies, possibly including
BEPU methods in order to better dissociate the nodalization effects discussed in this work, from the other
potential sources of uncertainties in the models.
