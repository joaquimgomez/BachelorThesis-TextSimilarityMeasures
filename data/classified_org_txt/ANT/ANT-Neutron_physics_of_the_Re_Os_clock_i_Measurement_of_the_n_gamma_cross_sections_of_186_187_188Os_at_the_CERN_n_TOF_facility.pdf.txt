The precise determination of the neutron capture cross sections of 186Os and 187Os is important to define the
s-process abundance of 187Os at the formation of the solar system. This quantity can be used to evaluate the
radiogenic component of the abundance of 187Os due to the decay of the unstable 187Re (t1/2 = 41.2 Gyr) and
from this to infer the time duration of the nucleosynthesis in our galaxy (Re/Os cosmochronometer). The neutron
capture cross sections of 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os have been measured at the CERN n TOF facility from 1 eV
to 1 MeV, covering the entire energy range of astrophysical interest. The measurement has been performed by
time-of-flight technique using isotopically enriched samples and two C6D6 scintillation detectors for recording the
prompt γ rays emitted in the capture events. Maxwellian averaged capture cross sections have been determined for
thermal energies between kT = 5 and 100 keV corresponding to all possible s-process scenarios. The estimated
uncertainties for the values at 30 keV are 4.1, 3.3, and 4.7% for 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION

The long half-life of 41.2 Gyr [1] makes 187Re an important
potential cosmochronometer. Originally proposed by Clayton
[2], this chronometer is particularly appealing because 187Re
can be attributed to the r process, which is believed to occur
in supernova explosions of massive stars. Since these stars
evolve quickly, the clock started early after galaxy formation.
This was confirmed by recent observations of very metal
poor stars, which exhibit remarkably consistent r-process
abundance patterns [3–5]. Another important feature of this
clock is that it can be almost completely analyzed in terms of
the nuclear properties of the mother/daughter pair 187Re/187Os.
Therefore, it represents a valuable independent complement to
other dating methods based on astronomical observations, i.e.,
for deriving the Hubble age [6], globular cluster ages [7],
or age estimates from analyses of the cosmic microwave
background [8].

The idea of the Re/Os clock is sketched in Fig. 1, which
shows the reaction paths in the W-Re-Os region. Abundance
contributions from the r-process region are indicated by
dashed arrows. The main s-process flow is defined by a
sequence of (n,γ ) reactions and β decays (solid line). The
unstable isotopes 185W and 186Re (circles) represent branching
points for the reaction flow, because their half-lives are
sufficiently long for neutron capture to compete with β decays.
If these branchings were negligible, 187Re could be considered
as a pure r-only isotope, which is shielding 187Os from the r-
process β-decay chains. Therefore, the radiogenic contribution
to the abundance of 187Os could be determined by subtraction
of the s-process component from the observed abundance
value. The branchings at 185W and 186Re require a corre-
sponding correction of the radiogenic component, which can
be determined by a detailed analysis of the s-process reaction
flow using a reliable set of stellar (n,γ ) cross sections [9–11].

Problems related to the Re/Os clock (apart from a realistic
model of galactic chemical evolution) were found to originate
from the dramatic temperature dependence of the 187Re half-

life, a possible minor s-process contribution to 187Re, and a
sizable correction for the s-process abundance of 187Os due
to thermal population of low-lying excited nuclear states. The
first issue could be settled by a measurement of the half-life of
fully stripped 187Re atoms [12] and by subsequent analyses,
which demonstrated that the astration effect related to the
destruction of 187Re in later stellar generations is not crucial
for the reliability of the clock [13]. Similarly, the s-process
contributions to 187Re due to the branchings at 185W and 186Re
were shown to have no significant impact either [9,11,14].

The remaining nuclear issues, which need to be addressed
for the improvement of the Re/Os clock, refer to the
determination of more accurate Maxwellian averaged cross
sections (MACS) for neutron capture on 186Os and 187Os. This
information is required for defining the s-process contribution
to 187Os via the local approximation, 〈σ 〉 Ns = const., which is
well satisfied in this mass region. Because 186Os is exclusively
produced by the s process, the s component of 187Os is given by

Ns,187 =
〈σ 〉186
〈σ 〉187

Ns,186, (1)

where 〈σ 〉i are the MACSs that can in principle be calculated
from experimentally measured (n,γ ) cross sections with only
a small correction of 0.4% for the fact that the s-process
reaction chain in the Os region is almost but not completely
in flow equilibrium.

Under stellar conditions, however, the MACS derived from
laboratory data must be corrected for the effect of thermally
populated excited states. The contribution of captures by the
excited states have to be obtained by theoretical calculations.
The corresponding corrections are the stellar enhancement
factors (SEF). In these calculations, additional knowledge of
the inelastic cross section is important to constrain the effect
of superelastic scattering by the excited states, where neutrons
gain in energy if the final state is lower in energy than the initial
one. The stellar enhancement effect is particularly important
for 187Os, where low-lying nuclear states at 9.75, 74.3, 75.0,
and 100.6 keV have to be considered. In 186Os, the SEF is
much smaller, because only the first excited state at 137.2 keV,
which is considerably less populated, contributes to the SEF
correction.

FIG. 1. (Color online) The reaction path of the s process in
the W-Re-Os region. The main s-process flow is sketched by solid
lines, circles correspond to branchings in the s path, and r-process
contributions from explosive nucleosynthesis are indicated by dashed
arrows. The decay of 187Re constitutes a cosmochronometer, which
can be analyzed because the radiogenic component of 187Os can
be determined by subtraction of the s-process component. This s
component is defined by the abundance of the s-only nucleus 186Os
via s-process systematics.

Previous measurements of the (n,γ ) cross sections for
186,187Os were reported in limited energy ranges only, from
2.75 keV to 2.65 MeV [15], from 1 to 135 keV [16], and from
5 to 90 keV [17]. Below 1 keV, experimental information is
rather incomplete [18], leading to large uncertainties in the
MACSs at the low thermal energies typical of the s process
during the interpulse phases of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars [19]. The MACS at low thermal energies are particularly
important because the interpulse phase contributes most of the
s-process neutron exposure via the 13C(α,n)16O reaction [20].
Among the available cross section sets, the MACSs of 186Os
exhibit some discrepancies, especially at energies close to the
first excited state of 186Os at 130 keV, where a pronounced
step in the cross section is expected. Consequently, improved
capture cross section measurements were required to resolve
existing discrepancies and to extend the energy range to lower
and higher energies.

In addition, the available measurements of the inelastic-
scattering cross section of 187Os [21–24] exhibit large uncer-
tainties that are limiting the reliability of the SEF calculations
and have a serious effect on the Re/Os age. Therefore, an
accurate independent measurement of the (n,n′) cross section
of 187Os is called for as well. Finally, refined resonance
analyses are important to obtain a consistent set of level
densities as well as neutron and γ -ray strength functions for
the cross-section calculation of excited states and the related
determination of reliable values for the SEFs.

This complex of information was obtained in high-
resolution measurements of (n,γ ) cross sections for
186,187,188Os at the CERN n TOF facility reported in this
contribution (Paper I). In a second experiment the neu-
tron inelastic-scattering cross section was determined at the
Karlsruhe 3.7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator (Paper II). In
addition, detailed resonance analyses of the n TOF capture
data were performed and used together with the (n,n′) data for
improved SEF calculations, which were carried out with the
Hauser-Feshbach statistical model for an updated assessment
of the Re/Os cosmochronometer (Paper III).

II. MEASUREMENT

A. The n TOF facility

At n TOF, neutrons are produced by spallation of 20 GeV/c
protons on a massive lead target. The beam is delivered by the
proton synchrotron accelerator (PS) of the CERN complex
in bunches of 4 to 7 × 1012 protons, with a pulse width
of 7 ns and typical repetition frequency of 0.4 Hz. About
300 neutrons/proton are produced by the spallation module.
The experimental area is 185 m away from the target station,
allowing for an energy resolution of 5.5 × 10−4 at 1 keV and
a flux of the order of 2 × 105 neutrons/pulse/energy decade in
the neutron energy range from 1 eV to 1 MeV [25].

Together with the neutrons, a cascade of ultrarelativistic
particles is generated in the lead target which could act as a
potential source of background. This background is suppressed
by massive concrete shielding along the beam line and by a
sweeping magnet at 145 m from the spallation target. Photons
and the residual relativistic particles generated directly by
the proton interactions and traveling inside the beam pipe
are easily separated from the neutrons by TOF and the
corresponding γ flash is actually used to mark the time zero
point in the TOF spectrum.

Most critical are photons generated by neutron capture in
the material surrounding the target, in particular by hydrogen
of the cooling water. These photons are mainly produced
in the interval from 1 µs to a few 100 µs after the proton
pulse hits the target and arrive in the experimental area
together with the neutrons of energies in the keV range. The
background produced by Compton scattering of these photons
in the sample is significant and requires careful subtraction.
A set of removable neutron filters of aluminum, tungsten,
molybdenum, silver, and cobalt at 135 m from the target is
used for measuring this background at the energies of so-called
black resonances, which are large enough that all neutrons of
that energy are removed from the beam.

B. Experimental setup

In the present measurement, the experimental setup con-
sisted of two C6D6 scintillation counters and a set of samples
mounted on the ladder of an automatic sample changer as
shown in Fig. 2.

The detectors were designed for the lowest possible neutron
sensitivity in order to avoid time-correlated background from
neutrons scattered in the samples [26]. This was achieved by
using a very light scintillator cell of carbon fiber that was
directly glued onto the photomultiplier, thus minimizing the
detector materials. To reduce the background due to in-beam
γ rays from neutron captures in the water moderator [25],
which are scattered by the samples preferentially in forward
direction, the detectors were mounted 9.5 cm upstream of the
samples.

Similarly, the sample changer was designed to avoid
background from scattered neutrons. It consisted essentially of
a ladder made from a carbon fiber strip for holding the samples.
The sample changer was remotely operated by a stepping
motor. The evacuated beam pipes were stainless steel tubes
(wall thickness 0.5 mm) with 25 µm thick Kapton windows.

FIG. 2. (Color online) Sketch of sample changer and detectors in
the experimental area at a flight path of 185 m.

A neutron monitor consisting of a 6Li layer 200 µg/cm2

in thickness evaporated onto a 1.5-µm-thick Mylar foil
was mounted about 3.5 m upstream of the capture samples
for additional flux measurements [27]. The products of the
6Li(n,α)3H reaction were recorded by four silicon crystals
surrounding the 6Li foil outside the neutron beam.

In total six samples were used in the measurement, the
186,187,188Os isotopes under study, a 197Au sample for flux
normalization, natural carbon and lead samples for determin-
ing the backgrounds due to scattered neutrons and in-beam
γ rays, and an empty container to correct for the capture events
in the aluminum. An empty position on the sample changer
served for measuring the ambient background. The osmium
samples consisted of enriched metal powder encapsulated in
0.1-mm-thick aluminum cans 15 mm in diameter. The samples
were glued onto a KAPTON foil sustained by a carbon fiber
frame outside of the neutron beam. The characteristics of the
samples are summarized in Table I.

C. Data acquisition

The detector signals have been recorded with fast digitizers
at a sampling rate of 500 MHz corresponding to time steps of

2 ns/sample. Triggered by the pick-up signal of the accelerator,
each neutron burst could be followed for 16 ms by intermediate
data storage in the 8-MB on-board memory of the digitizers.
The neutron energies covered in capture measurements with
C6D6 detectors was limited to a maximum of about 1 MeV due
to the opening of inelastic channels and to a minimum of 0.7 eV
due to the 16-ms time interval provided by the storage capacity
of the digitizers. The time zero point in the TOF spectrum was
derived from the γ flash. For events following the γ flash, TOF,
pulse height, and integrated charge were determined by an
off-line analysis routine. This raw information was converted
into preprocessed data by energy calibration of the scintillators,
verification of gain stability, selection of proper thresholds, and
rejection of coincident events as described in Ref. [28].

III. DATA ANALYSIS

The data analysis has been divided into the resolved reso-
nance region (RRR) and the continuum part. The parameters
of the resolved resonances have been obtained up to neutron
energies of 5, 3, and 8 keV for 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os as
described in Paper III [29].

The average capture cross sections in the continuum region
were analyzed starting at neutron energies slightly below the
upper limit of the RRR to check the consistency of the two
independent analyses. The cross sections in the continuum
have been obtained from the preprocessed capture data after
application of the pulse height weighting technique (PHWT),
background subtraction, and flux normalization.

A. Pulse height weighting

The experimental capture yields are obtained by applying
the PHWT [30], an a posteriori manipulation of the detector
response to ensure that the γ -ray efficiency increases linearly
with the detector signal. This is achieved by means of weight-
ing functions (WF), which are parameterized as polynomial
functions of the γ -ray energy. Each recorded detector signal is
multiplied with the proper WF to correct for the γ efficiency
of the detectors. The absolute efficiency obtained in this way
has been verified by comparison with the well known (n,γ )
cross section of 197Au at 25 keV as discussed in Sec. III C.

An accuracy of 2% was determined for the PHWT by a
detailed study of the possible sources of systematic uncertain-
ties, i.e., related to the corrections for multiple scattering and

self-shielding [25]. The PHWT requires coincidence rejection,
reliable energy calibration of the γ -ray detection, and a
detailed simulation of the experimental setup to determine
the weighting functions.

The WFs for the osmium and gold samples have been
determined independently using the simulation tools MCNP
[31] and GEANT3.21 [32]. The related systematic uncertainty
was estimated by the differences in the count rates obtained
with the two weighting functions, which were 1%, 0.4%, and
0.4% for 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os, respectively. A separate
WF for gold, which had been determined with the GEANT4
tool kit, was also reproducing the capture yield to �1%. These
systematic uncertainties partly compensate each other, because
the Os capture yields are obtained relative to gold.

B. Backgrounds

In the analysis of the osmium and gold spectra, all
backgrounds are treated by the PHWT as they were true capture
events. Therefore, the events of the lead and carbon samples
must be weighted using the same weighting procedure than
events from the respective Os sample.

Figure 3 shows the resulting TOF spectra for the 186Os
sample together with the spectra for background determi-
nation, which are representative for the energy and time
dependence of the background. Only a few narrow capture
resonances in the lead spectrum had to be excluded, whereas
the 34-keV 27Al resonance in the spectrum of the empty can
had to be considered for background subtraction. Apart from

FIG. 3. (Color online) TOF spectrum of 186Os together with the
(not yet normalized) spectra for background determination. In the
186Os spectrum the region of resolved resonances extends to several
keV. The low-neutron sensitivity of the setup is illustrated by the fairly
small difference between the spectra taken with the carbon sample
and the empty can. The background in the keV region is dominated
due to scattering of in-beam γ rays by the sample.

that resonance there is no significant difference between the
spectra of the empty position and of the empty can. In the
astrophysically relevant energy range between 1 and 300 keV
one finds that the background is dominated by the contribution
from in-beam γ rays.

The actual background level is experimentally determined
by the contributions measured with the empty position and
with the lead and carbon samples. Additional background
information was obtained in runs made with black neutron
filters and with detailed simulations of the scattering of
in-beam γ rays by the samples. Because the measurements
with the filters represent only a few energy points and because
the statistics at the bottom of the black resonances is in general
poor, Monte Carlo simulations were used to complement these
measurements. This technique was successfully applied in
other n TOF measurements as well [33,34].

An additional background component is due to (n,n′γ )
events in the samples and deuteron recoils in the scintillator.
In both cases this background starts to contribute only above
500 keV. Therefore, the analysis was repeated for all Os
isotopes using an energy-deposition threshold of 500 keV.
These results were then renormalized to the cross sections
determined with the common threshold at 200 keV.

The overall background was determined by a polynomial fit
of the dominant background components, i.e., of the ambient
part represented by the spectra of the empty can and the part
due to in-beam γ rays obtained from the lead spectra. The sum
of both components was normalized to match the background
level measured with the W and Al neutron filters at 18 eV and
at 34 and 90 keV, corrected for the γ -ray absorption in the
filters as shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 4.

An independent determination of the neutron- and γ -
ray-induced backgrounds was performed by Monte Carlo
simulations based on the neutron-scattering cross sections
and on the spectrum of in-beam γ rays produced near the
spallation target [25]. The corresponding interactions with the
samples were simulated using GEANT3.21 [35]. The result of
the simulation (dotted lines in Fig. 4) is in good agreement
with the experimental background. Due to the different
signal/background ratios in the spectra of the Os isotopes, the
remaining differences in the overall background are affecting
the cross sections of 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os by 2, 1, and 3%
around 30 keV, respectively.

Both approaches were eventually combined to determine
the background level with improved accuracy.

C. Absolute neutron flux

A relative normalization of the well-defined energy depen-
dence of the neutron flux [27,36] could be obtained for the
various runs via the 6Li neutron monitor. The absolute flux
was determined by means of the gold reference sample, using
the (n,γ ) cross section of 197Au as a standard.

The first gold resonance at 4.9 eV has been used for defining
the flux in the RRR using the saturated resonance method [37].
The absolute yield normalization was determined by a fit with

resonance is completely negligible compared to the capture
signal. In the keV region, the (n,γ ) cross section at 25 keV is
known with 1.5% uncertainty [39] and is often used as standard
in nuclear astrophysics. In this case, however, the background
subtraction is crucial, because the signal/background ratio at
this energy is about 4, two orders of magnitude lower than for
the 4.9 eV resonance.

The background for the Au spectrum was determined
analogously to the method applied in case of the Os spectra. An
additional verification could be obtained via the independent
flux normalizations at 4.9 eV and 25 keV as illustrated in Fig. 5.

the top of the 4.9 eV resonance in perfect agreement with the
SAMMY fit on the basis of the presently adopted resonance
parameters [18].

Although the absolute flux normalization was found in
perfect agreement, a systematic uncertainty of 2% has been
adopted for the energy dependence of the neutron flux, which
has been determined in n TOF measurements with the Si
monitor and a calibrated fission chamber [40].

D. Multiple scattering and isotopic impurities

In the unresolved region, neutron multiple scattering and
self-shielding corrections in the sample have been determined
with the SESH code [41]. In the RRR these corrections
were included in the SAMMY analysis. The results from the
continuum region and from the RRR are converging in the
neutron energy range from 1.5 to 3 keV within uncertainties.
The multiple-scattering corrections were below 4 and 5% for
the even and odd isotopes with uncertainties of about 10%.

Isotopic corrections have been applied by subtracting the
contributions from the contaminants at all energies. The effect
of the PHWT has been taken into account in the isotopic
correction by weighting the cross sections of the contaminants
with the ratio of the neutron separation energies of the
main isotope and of the contaminants. The code for isotopic
corrections was validated by tests with cross sections from
a database, which were artificially contaminated with several
impurities. The contributions of 190,192Os were considered by
the cross-section data of Browne and Berman [16], which have
been confirmed at 25 keV by a recent activation measurement
[42]. At higher energies, these data were extrapolated by
means of the energy dependence adopted from the JEFF-3.1
evaluation [43]. Because of their smaller cross sections 190Os
and 192Os contribute only a rather small part to the correction.
The more significant contribution of 189Os was obtained with

the cross sections of Winters et al. [44], which are in good
agreement with recent results between 5 and 90 keV [17].
The experimental data [44] were also extrapolated to higher
neutron energies by means of the JEFF-3.1 evaluation.

The related systematic uncertainties have been estimated by
variation of the cross section within uncertainties. On average,
the uncertainties due to isotopic corrections were 1.5, 0.7, and
0.7% for 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os, respectively.

IV. RESULTS

The (n,γ ) cross sections of 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os have
been measured with high resolution in the energy range from a
few eV to 1 MeV. The results for the resolved resonance region
up to a few keV, which has been analyzed with the R-matrix
code SAMMY, will be reported separately in Paper III [29]
together with the determination of Maxwellian average cross
sections and with the calculation of stellar enhancement factors
for the s-process analysis in the W-Re-Os region.

In the unresolved resonance region of interest here, the
results have been averaged over 20 bins per decade for
comparison with previous results [15–17] in Fig. 6. In case of
the 187Os cross section good agreement is found among all data
sets, but there are clear discrepancies in the results for 186Os
and 188Os, where the present values are significantly lower and
exhibit a more pronounced competition by inelastic-scattering
channels corresponding to the first excited states at 137 and
155 keV.

The 188Os cross section shows the largest discrepancies,
presumably because the high-energy part of the spectrum
was overweighted in the PHWT applications of the previous
measurements as outlined in Ref. [45]. To reproduce the
previous 188Os cross section values from our data would
require to reduce the background in the keV region by 30%,
far beyond any justifiable solution.

Numerical values of the data points in Fig. 6 are listed in
Table II.

A detailed account of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model
(HFSM) calculations performed for the Re/Os clock will be
presented in Paper III [29] with a discussion of the various
parameters deduced from the resonance analyses and from the
(n,n′) cross section measurement in Paper II [46].

V. MAXWELLIAN AVERAGES

The cross section results from the continuum region
(Table II) were complemented below 3 keV for 186Os and
188Os and below 2 keV for 187Os by average cross sections
with a resolution of 20 bins per decade, which were extracted
from the resonance parameters as reported in Paper III. From
these values, MACS have been calculated according to

for thermal energies from 5 to 100 keV.
At the lowest thermal energies, the results shown in Fig. 7

and summarized in Table III benefit from the fact that a
complete set of resonance parameters was available for the first
time. The total uncertainties of the MACS, which are below
4.3, 3.3, and 4.7% for 186Os, 187Os, and 188Os, respectively,
are clearly dominated by the systematic uncertainties given in
Table IV.

The comparison of the present results in Fig. 7 with
the recommended values of Bao et al. [47], which are
based on previously reported MACSs [15,16,48], shows large
discrepancies for 188Os as expected from the cross-section plot
in Fig. 6. Differences for the isotopes 186,187Os are smaller

FIG. 7. (Color online) Present Maxwellian averaged cross sec-
tions (solid circles with error bars) compared with the previously
recommended values of Bao et al. [47] (solid line). The insets focus on
the values at kT = 30 keV, which are commonly used for comparison.
At this energy the present uncertainties are 4.1, 3.2, and 4.7% for
186Os, 187Os, and 188Os, respectively. Experimental results refer to the
work of Winters et al. [15] (open circles), Browne and Berman [16]
(triangles), and Bokhovko et al. [48] (open square). The values of
Bao et al. [47] are indicated by shaded bars.

and are found mostly below thermal energies of 25 keV. This
is reflected by the values for kT = 30 keV, which are plotted
in the insets of Fig. 7. The significant difference in case of
187Os implies that the cross-section ratio 〈σ 〉186/〈σ 〉187 is now
11% smaller than obtained from the previously recommended

values [47]. At thermal energies around kT = 23 keV, where
the s-process abundances in thermally pulsing low-mass AGB
stars are actually shaped [20], the ratio is even 19% smaller
than recommended in Ref. [47].

Although the differences between the individual cross
sections and previous data are practically within the quoted
uncertainties, it was renounced to combine all existing results
in a single data set as one would do in a typical cross-section
evaluation. Instead of determining the cross-section ratio
〈σ 〉186/〈σ 〉187, which is in fact the relevant quantity required
for the Re/Os clock [Eq. (1)], after combining all existing
results into separate data sets, it is preferable to maintain
the internal consistency provided by the present experiment.
This offers the advantage that systematic uncertainties in the
measurement and data analysis may, at least partly, cancel out
in the cross-section ratio. In other words, the 5% uncertainty
of the cross-section ratio at kT = 25 keV obtained from the
MACS in Table III represents a safe upper limit.

In summary, the present MACS values are leading to a
considerable reduction of the s-process abundance of 187Os.
This reduction of the s-process part results in a larger
radiogenic component of 187Os and in a correspondingly older
187Re age.

A. Discussion of uncertainties

The statistical uncertainties are essentially determined by
the signal/background ratio in the TOF spectra (Fig. 3).
Due to the background from in-beam γ rays, the statistical
uncertainties are largest in the astrophysically relevant region
from 1 to 100 keV, but the corresponding contributions to the
total MACS uncertainties are always below 2.3%.

The systematic uncertainties have been discussed before
and are summarized in Table IV.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The present work (Paper I) is part of an experimental effort
for a revision of the Re/Os cosmochronometer. It describes
the measurement of the neutron capture cross sections of
186,187,188Os at the CERN n TOF facility with improved
accuracy and over a wide energy range of neutron energies
from 1 eV to 1 MeV. From these data Maxwellian averaged
cross sections were obtained with uncertainties between 3 and
4%. These results were complemented by a measurement of
the inelastic-scattering cross section of 187Os at KIT (FZK)
reported in Paper II and by a detailed resonance analysis of
the Os cross sections in Paper III. The combined information
represents a complete data set describing the neutron physics
part of the Re/Os clock.
