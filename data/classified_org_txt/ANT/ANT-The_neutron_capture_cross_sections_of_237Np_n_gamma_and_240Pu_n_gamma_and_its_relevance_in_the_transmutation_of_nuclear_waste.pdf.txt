Abstract. Neutron capture cross sections of actinides are of great relevance for the Transmutation of Nuclear Waste
in Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and Generation-IV reactors. The neutron capture cross sections of 237Np and
240Pu were measured at the n TOF facility with a Total Absorption Calorimeter. The data have been analyzed with the
SAMMY code. The corresponding covariance matrices have been generated. The final cross sections are presented
and compared to the previously existing ones.

1 Introduction

One of the solutions proposed for the management of
radioactive nuclear waste is the transmutation. This tech-
nology could reduce substantially (by a factor of 1/100 or
more) the radiotoxicity inventory of the long lived component
of the nuclear waste, mainly the trans-uranium actinides.
The detailed engineering designs, safety evaluations and the

detailed performance assessment of dedicated transmutation
ADS and critical reactors require more precise and complete
basic nuclear data [1].

237Np plays an important role because of two main rea-
sons. First, it has the largest capture ratio after 239Pu in a
typical ADS core loaded with a fuel highly enriched in Minor
Actinides (MA). Second, Np is the actinide element present-
ing the largest leakage probability from a deep underground
repository. 240Pu has also two main implications. First, 240Pu
is the second most abundant Pu isotope (after 239Pu) in the

irradiated fuel discharged from a commercial Nuclear Power
Plant. Second, 240Pu can be the most abundant Pu isotope in
the composition of the fuel for an ADS depending on the fuel
cycle (open or closed).

The capture cross section of these two isotopes was mea-
sured at the n TOF facility [2] during the 2004 campaign using
the Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) in the energy range
from 1 eV to 2 keV.

2 Measurement and experimental setup

The n TOF facility and its performance in terms of neutron
fluence, energy resolution, sources of background, etc., are
described in detail in [2]. The targets of 237Np (43.3 mg,
1.29 MBq) and 240Pu (51.2 mg, 458 MBq) used in the mea-
surements were sandwiched by two thin Al layers (total mass
<75 mg) and canned inside a 0.35 mm thick Ti canning with
ISO 2919 certification. Their isotopic purity was determined
by γ-ray spectrometry and was better than 99% for 237Np and
about 90% for 240Pu (with a 10% contamination of 239Pu).

The neutron capture detection system consists of a seg-
mented TAC made of 40 BaF2 crystals with

10B loaded
carbon fiber capsules and placed at 185 m flight path from
the spallation source. The TAC has nearly 100% detection
efficiency for capture events and good energy resolution. The
neutron sensitivity and the sample activity are reduced by
using a C12H20O4(

6Li)2 neutron absorber placed between the
sample and the cystals. The performance of the TAC has been
investigated both experimentally, with calibration sources and
the reference 197Au(n,γ) cross section, and by Monte Carlo
simulations [3,4].

The Data Acquisition system used in the measurements is
fully based on digital electronics, with 54 channels of high
performance 8 bits flash ADCs [5,6] (8 MBytes memory
and 500 MSamples/s) recording the full detector history for
neutron energy ranges between 0.3 eV and 20 GeV.

3 Procurement of the experimental capture yield

The experimental capture yield is defined as the fraction
of neutrons entering the sample which undergo a capture
reaction. It can be calculated as

Y(En) =
C(Esum,mγ, En)

εDT (En) Nintercepted φ(En)
(1)

where En is the neutron energy, Esum and mγ are deposited
energy and crystal multiplicity respectively, C(Esum, mγ, En)
stands for the number of counts detected under the analysis
conditions, εDT (En) is the detection efficiency taking into
account dead-time effects, Nintercepted is the fraction of the
beam intercepted by the sample (radiussample = 0.5 cm,
radiusbeam ∼2 cm) and φ(En) is the neutron fluence.

The best signal to background ratio in the data was found
selecting events with mγ > 2 and 2.5 < Esum (MeV) < 6.
Under these conditions, the detection efficiency of the TAC
drops down to ∼50% and shows a significant dependence
on the particular nuclear electromagnetic (EM) de-excitation
pattern and on the counting rate. The detection efficiency

and its uncertainty (lower than 3%) have been calculated as
a function of En for all the samples [7] by Monte Carlo
simulation using the GEANT4 package [8].

All background components were characterized from the
analysis of several dedicated measurements: background with-
out neutron beam, Ti-canning without sample (capture and
scattering in the Ti-canning), empty TAC with neutron beam
(capture and scattering in any element but the Ti-canning and
the sample) and natC (neutron scattering at the sample).

The 237Np elastic to capture cross section ratio is small
and therefore the neutron sensitivity due to the 237Np itself
was found to be below 1% at all neutron energies. For the
240Pu measurement there are isolated resonances for which the
neutron sensitivity can be as high as 3%. In both cases the total
background is characterized as a function of En and is taken
into account in the cross section analysis.

4 Cross section analysis

The measured capture yields of 237Np and 240Pu have been
analysed using the SAMMY code [9], following the iterative
SAMMY sequential fit method in the resolved resonance region
(RRR) [10,11]. The capture yields are analyzed together with
transmission, using the resulting resonance parameters and
covariance matrix of the fit to one data set as input for
the next one. The results are a set of resonance parameters
compatible with all data sets and a realistic covariance matrix.
The transmission data are fitted first because of their a priori
lower uncertainty in the normalization and background. If
necessary, the various absolute normalizations are allowed to
vary within their estimated uncertainties (5% for the n TOF
capture data) during the fits.

4.1 237Np cross section

In the RRR, below 500 eV, the 237Np capture yield was
analyzed together with the transmission data of Gressier et al.
[12] measured at GELINA [13], included in the latest evalua-
tions. The fits were performed in steps of 100 eV leaving the
normalization, constant background and resonance parameters
free for all resonances in the range under study. Figure 1 shows
an example of the SAMMY fits to the three data sets.

Due to the small 237Np level spacing, Df ittedJ=2−3 = 0.56± 0.02 eV, the resonances start to overlap above 140 eV.
Therefore, the average radiative width is calculated only from
resonances below 90 eV, resulting in 〈ΓRRRγ 〉 = 41.5±0.8 meV.
This value was set as initial value for all resonances before
the final sequential fit was performed, leaving Γγ = 〈ΓRRRγ 〉
fixed for the small resonances. The neutron strength function
S0 was calculated as the variation with energy of the reduced
neutron width Γ0n =

Γn√
E

, resulting SRRR0 = (0.99±0.09)×10−4.
The unweighted average capture cross section is calculated in
steps of 50 eV and compared to the evaluated cross sections in
figure 2. The n TOF σ(n,γ) agrees with the evaluations below
300 eV, but it is lower by 5–10% at higher energies, which is
also the case in the URR as discussed be low.

The n TOF capture yield above 500 eV is transformed
into capture cross section using the thin target approximation

(nat = 1.401×104 at/barn). The code FITACS [14], included
in SAMMY, was used to fit the average capture cross section
with average resonance parameters from the Hauser-Feshbach
calculation with width fluctuations. The values resulting
from the fit are 〈ΓURRγ 〉 = 40.1 ± 0.8 meV and SURR0 = (0.97 ±
0.09) × 10−4. These values agree within uncertainties with the
results found in the RRR.

Figure 3 shows the n TOF URR capture cross section
compared to the evaluations files, all of them based on the
measurements of Weston [15], and other experimental data.
The ENDF/B-VII, JEFF-3.1 and JENDL-3.3 cross section are
10–15% above the n TOF (as also happens in the 300–500 eV
range of the RRR). Such a discrepancy in the cross section of
the evaluated files is also observed in the values derived from
the transmission measurement of Gressier (∼10% uncertainty

the capture data from LANSCE (Esch et al.) [16]. However,
the LANSCE data show a different dependence with energy
from all other measurements. The capture data of Kobayashi,
also shown in the figure, are systematicaly above all other
measurements and evaluated data files.

4.2 240Pu cross section

The 240Pu capture yield was analyzed following same proce-
dure of the 237Np resonance analysis. The n TOF capture data
are analyzed together with the transmission data of Kolar and
Böckoff [17] (GELINA, 1968), also included in the work of
Bouland et al. [10] and the evaluated data files. The 240Pu level
spacing is D ∼ 12 eV and the resonances are well resolved up
to several keV.

The 240Pu sample used at n TOF was inhomogeneous.
This implies an uncertainty associated to the self-shielding
that has been studied with the well known resonance at
1.056 eV. This uncertainty amounts to 20% from 1 to 10 eV,
∼15–10% between 10 and 200 eV, ∼5% up to 500 eV and
negligible at higher energies. An accurate resonance analysis
has been performed in the region between 500 eV and 2 keV.

The resulting values are 〈ΓRRRγ 〉 = 32.4 ± 0.8 meV and
SRRR0 = 1.04 ± 0.05. Figure 4 shows the comparison between
the n TOF unweighted average capture cross section and
different evaluated files. The n TOF σ(n,γ) agrees with the
JENDL-3.3 and JEFF-3.1 libraries except for some resonances
around 800 eV, and is 5% to 20% larger than ENDF/B-VII.

5 Conclusions

The 237Np and 240Pu capture cross section have been measured
at n TOF in the range from 1 eV to 2 keV. The capture yield
was calculated in reference to the 197Au resonance at 4.9 eV.
All instrumental effects such as the detection efficiency of the

detector, dead-time losses, background, sample neutron sensi-
tivity, etc. have been corrected yielding an overall uncertainty
of 5%.

The capture yields have been analyzed using the SAMMY
sequential fit methodology, including transmission measure-
ments from GELINA, below 500 eV for the case 237Np and
below 2 keV for the 240Pu. The FITACS code has been used
for the analysis of the unresolved resonance region of 237Np
above 500 eV.

The n TOF 237Np σ(n,γ) is in agreement with the evalu-
ated data files below ∼300 eV and its is lower by 10 to 15%
up to 2 keV. This discrepancy with the evaluated data files is
also observed in the capture cross section derived from the
transmission measurements of Gressier et al.

In the case of the 240Pu σ(n,γ), the n TOF σ(n,γ) agrees
within uncertainties with JENDL-3.3 and JEFF-3.1, except

for a group of resonances around 800 eV. ENDF/B-VII data
are lower than n TOF and the mentioned evaluations, with
differences that increase with neutron energy up to 15–20%.
