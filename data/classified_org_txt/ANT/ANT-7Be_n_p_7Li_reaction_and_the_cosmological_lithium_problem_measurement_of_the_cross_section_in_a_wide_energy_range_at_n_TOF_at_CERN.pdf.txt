We report on the measurement of the 7Beðn; pÞ7Li cross section from thermal to approximately 325 keV
neutron energy, performed in the high-flux experimental area (EAR2) of the n_TOF facility at CERN. This
reaction plays a key role in the lithium yield of the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) for standard
cosmology. The only two previous time-of-flight measurements performed on this reaction did not cover
the energy window of interest for BBN, and they showed a large discrepancy between each other. The
measurement was performed with a Si telescope and a high-purity sample produced by implantation of a
7Be ion beam at the ISOLDE facility at CERN. While a significantly higher cross section is found at low
energy, relative to current evaluations, in the region of BBN interest, the present results are consistent with
the values inferred from the time-reversal 7Liðp; nÞ7Be reaction, thus yielding only a relatively minor
improvement on the so-called cosmological lithium problem. The relevance of these results on the near-
threshold neutron production in the pþ 7Li reaction is also discussed.

Big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is one of the key
elements of the big bang theory, as it describes the
production of light elements in the early stages of the
Universe [1,2]. A remarkable agreement is found between
BBN predictions and primordial abundances of D and 4He
inferred from observations of objects at high redshift and/or
in ionized hydrogen regions of compact blue galaxies.
On the contrary, model predictions seriously overestimate,
by more than a factor of 3, the primordial abundance of
lithium inferred from the observation of metal-poor stars

(the so-called Spite plateau [3]). Such a discrepancy is
known as the cosmological lithium problem (CLiP).
Various possible explanations of this problem have been
proposed in the last few decades, involving the fields of
astrophysics, astronomical observations, nonstandard cos-
mology, and new physics beyond the standard model of
particle physics, but at present a fully satisfactory solution
is still missing.
The primordial 7Li abundance is dominated by the

electron-capture decay 7Beþe−→ 7Liþνe after the BBN
phase of evolution of the early Universe. Therefore, a
higher rate for neutron- or charged-particle-induced reac-
tions on 7Be leads to a lower surviving 7Be fraction and,
ultimately, to a lower 7Li abundance. To investigate a
possible nuclear physics solution to the CLiP, several
measurements have been performed in recent years on

charged particle reactions responsible for the production
and destruction of 7Be. However, none of these measure-
ments have revealed a significant impact on 7Be production
or destruction [4]. More recently, an experimental cam-
paign has been undertaken to measure, in some cases for
the first time, neutron-induced reactions responsible for
the 7Be destruction. This is the case, in particular, for the
7Beðn; αÞ channel, where data in the neutron energy region
of interest for BBN were essentially missing. Recently,
both a direct measurement [5] and a time-reversal one [6]
have definitely excluded a possible contribution of this
reaction to the solution of the CLiP.
The 7Beðn; pÞ7Li reaction is responsible for a dominant

fraction of the destruction of 7Be. As a consequence, it plays
a key role within BBN models in the determination of
primordial lithium. Despite its importance, very few direct
measurements exist for this reaction. This cross section was
measured in the 1980s at the Joint Institute for Nuclear
Research (Dubna, Russia) from thermal to 500 eV neutron
energy [7], and shortly thereafter at the Los Alamos Neutron
Science CEnter (LANSCE) in Los Alamos, U.S., from
thermal to 13 keV [8]. Although the former is affected by
large statistical uncertainties that make a comparison diffi-
cult, the two data sets are somewhat inconsistent with each
other, showing a systematic difference of 30%, on average.
Furthermore, the extrapolation to higher energy of the
Los Alamos measurement seems to be inconsistent with
the cross section determined on the basis of the time-reversal
7Liðp; nÞ7Be reaction. In summary, at present a consistent
and accurate description of the 7Beðn; pÞ7Li reaction from
thermal neutron energy to the BBN region, i.e., up to several
hundred kilo–electron volts, is still missing. Considering the
important role of this reaction for the CLiP, new high-
accuracy data on this reaction, in a wide energy region,
would finally clarify the situation.
The main difficulties of direct measurements are related to

the high specific activity of 7Be (13 GBq=μg), and to the
small Q value of the reaction (1.64 MeV), leading to the
emission of low-energy protons. Both characteristics put
severe constraints on the total mass, areal density, and purity
of the sample, and in turn on the flux of the neutron beam
needed for a statistically significant measurement. In this
respect, the recently built high-luminosity experimental area
at n_TOF (EAR2) [9] is one of the few time-of-flight
installations where such a measurement could be performed.
The 7Beðn; pÞ7Li reaction was studied by combining

the capabilities of the two major nuclear physics
facilities operating at CERN: ISOLDE and n_TOF. The
sample material was produced at Paul Scherrer Institute
(PSI) in Villigen, Switzerland, by radiochemical separation
of 7Be from the SINQ cooling water (details on the sample
preparation and characterization are reported in Ref. [10]).
The freshly separated material was then implanted on an Al
backing at ISOLDE and immediately afterwards irradiated
with the pulsed, wide-spectrum neutron beam in EAR2 at

n_TOF. Although designed for the production and extrac-
tion of radioactive ion beams, the ISOLDE target unit can
accommodate imported activity for the efficient preparation
of isotopically pure radioactive samples [11,12]. A 7Be
implanted target of 1.03� 0.3 GBq total activity, corre-
sponding to≈80 ng in mass, was produced, with a purity of
about 99%, with the remaining 1% due to 7Li contamina-
tion. While the implantation was originally designed to
produce a uniform sample of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 area, the
obtained deposit was highly inhomogeneous. Two different
imaging techniques applied on the sample after the meas-
urement showed that the deposit had a Gaussian profile of
approximately 0.5 cm FHWM [10]. A correction for the
inhomogeneity of the sample therefore had to be applied in
the analysis (see below for details).
The main features of the n_TOF neutron beam in the

EAR2 measurement station are the wide neutron energy
spectrum, spanning from 2 meV to 100 MeV, the high
intensity of ≳107 neutrons=pulse at the sample position,
the low repetition rate, of less than 0.8 Hz, and the good
energy resolution (10−3 ≤ ΔE=E ≤ 10−2 in the energy
range of interest for this measurement). More details about
the EAR2 neutron beam can be found in Refs. [9,13].
The experimental setup consisted of a position-sensitive

telescope, made of two silicon strip detectors, of 20 μm and
300 μm thickness for ΔE and E detection, respectively.
Both detectors had a 5 × 5 cm2 active area and 16 strips.
The telescope was mounted at a polar angle of 90°, relative
to the beam direction, at a distance from the center of the
sample of 5 cm. To minimize the energy straggling of
emitted protons inside the 7Be deposit, the sample was tilted
relative to the neutron beam direction by 45°. The prompt
signal produced by γ-rays and relativistic particles, the so-
called γ-flash, was used as reference for the determination
of the neutron time of flight. Before the 7Be measurement,
the 6Liðn; tÞ4He reaction was measured in the same exper-
imental conditions. To this end, a sample of 1.1 mg of 6LiF
was used, with a surface of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2, to match the
envisaged size of the 7Be sample. The 6Liðn; tÞ reaction was
also used for calibrating the energy deposited in the
telescope, by means of the triton peak. More details on
the experimental setup can be found in Ref. [14].
The high purity of the sample, the use of a telescope for

particle identification, and the very high instantaneous
neutron flux of EAR2 resulted in a practically negligible
background—in particular, the one associated with the
natural γ-ray activity of 7Be. The only source of back-
ground affecting the measurement is related to the
14Nðn; pÞ reactions in the sample backing. This background
was identified and subtracted with a “dummy” sample, i.e.,
the backing without the 7Be deposit, and its contribution
was found to be important only for neutron energies
above ∼500 keV.

As previously mentioned, the deposit of 7Be turned out
to be highly inhomogeneous and with smaller dimension
than originally envisaged, thus being substantially different
from the 6Li sample used as reference. As a consequence,
the 7Beðn; pÞ cross section cannot be simply determined
from the rate of the 6Liðn; tÞ reaction, considering that
the fraction of the neutron beam intercepted by the two
samples is significantly different. The cross section can be
obtained by

σn;pðEnÞ ¼
CðEnÞ

ΦðEnÞ × ϵ × NS × fC
: ð1Þ

Here, CðEnÞ is the number of detected protons (inte-
grated over the whole measurement) in a given neutron
energy bin, ΦðEnÞ the total number of neutrons in that
energy bin, derived from Ref. [13], and ϵ the detection
efficiency, obtained from detailed GEANT4 simulations of
the experimental setup. NS is the total number of atoms in
the sample, and the factor fC, introduced to account for the
target inhomogeneity mentioned above, represents the
convolution of the normalized neutron beam spatial profile
and target nuclei distribution, and has a dimension of b−1

(inverse barns). The measured distribution of the sample
material [10] and the neutron profile obtained from GEANT4
simulations of the spallation process and subsequent trans-
port through the vertical beam line [15] were used for the
evaluation of fC. A consistency check of the method to
derive the cross section was carried out by analyzing the
6Liðn; tÞ data, with the efficiency and beam-sample con-
volution factor fC specifically calculated for the

6Li
sample. The obtained cross section agrees with the standard
[16] within 5%, in the whole neutron energy range from
thermal to 1 MeV.
The 7Beðn; pÞ cross section was extracted relative to that

of the 6Liðn; tÞ reaction, from the ratio of the number of
counts (normalized to the respective total neutron fluence),
and taking into account the ratios of the efficiencies and
beam-sample convolution factors. This method minimizes
the uncertainty, as the energy-dependent flux cancels out,
while systematic effects on the simulated efficiencies
mostly compensate each other, except at higher energies
(see below). Considering that the alignment of the sample
relative to the neutron beam is not known to better than a
few millimeters, and in view of the difference in the target
nuclei distribution of the 7Be and 6Li samples, an uncer-
tainty of 8% was estimated for the ratio of the fC’s. Since
all other factors in Eq. (1) are known with better accuracy,
this represents the major source of uncertainty of the
present results, up to a neutron energy of 50 keV.
A final remark concerning the detection efficiency is

that, contrary to the 6Liðn; tÞ case, for which the known
angular distribution above 1 keV was used in the simu-
lations, the emission of protons in the nþ 7Be reaction was
assumed to be isotropic at all energies. This assumption

was verified “a posteriori,” on the basis of the levels of 8Be
contributing to the cross section. In fact, as will be shown
later on, up to 50 keV the cross section is dominated by
negative-parity compound levels, favoring s-wave proton
emissions. Above this energy, this assumption may not
hold anymore, leading to an additional 10% systematic
uncertainty in the extracted cross section.
Figure 1 shows the background-subtracted reduced cross

section (i.e., the cross section multiplied by the square root
of the neutron energy) of the 7Beðn; pÞ7Li reaction, as a
function of neutron energy, compared with the two pre-
vious direct measurements and with the current ENDF
evaluation. In the figure only the statistical errors are
shown. The systematic uncertainty, mainly related to the
sample inhomogeneity, is 10% from thermal to 50 keV, and
could reach 15% above it, due to the estimated effect of the
angular distribution assumption. The present data are 35%
and 40% higher than those of Koehler et al. [8] and the
ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation [16], respectively, while they are
consistent with the results of Hanna [17], Gledenov et al.
[7], and Červená et al. [18] at thermal neutron energy. Our
experimental value is set at 52.3� 5.2 kb.
Even though the n_TOF measurement covers a wide

energy range up to ∼325 keV, in order to derive a rate on
the 7Beðn; pÞ7Li reaction at thermal energies of interest for
big bang nucleosynthesis calculations, the cross section of
the present measurement has been complemented by data
derived from the time reversal reaction, which provides
accurate information in the upper energy side of the energy
spectrum, from 35 keV to ≈2 MeV. To this end, the data of
the 7Liðp; nÞ7Be cross section from Sekharan et al. [19]
have been used in conjunction with the specific detailed-
balance relation:

where kp and kn are the incident proton and outgoing
neutron relative momenta in the center-of-mass systems. The
R-matrix single-level Breit-Wigner (SLBW) formalism,
which is appropriate for the present situation, has been used
for fitting the cross section in the full energy range, including
all nine states in 8Be above 18.899 MeV (the neutron
separation energy) and up to 22 MeV. The excitation energy
of each state, as compiled in the ENSDF library [20], has
been kept constant in the fit, while the neutron and/or the
proton widths have been allowed to vary, starting from the
values reported in the library. The final result is shown in
Fig. 2 by the red curve.
From the fitted data, the cross section averaged over the

energy distribution corresponding to the temperature of
interest in standard BBN model calculations has been
derived in the temperature range 0.001 ≤ T9 ≤ 10, where
T9 indicates the temperature in units of 10

9 K. The
resulting reaction rate can be accurately described by an
analytical expression (see the Supplemental Material [21]
for all details),

A comparison of the present reaction rate with other rates

commonly adopted in BBN calculations is shown in Fig. 3.
It can be seen that the present rate is significantly higher in
a wide range up to T9 ≈ 1.
We have performed standard BBN calculations using an

updated version of the ALTERBBN code [26], adopting a

neutron mean lifetime of τn ¼ 880.2 s andNν ¼ 3 neutrino
species. The remaining additional parameter of the adopted
standard cosmology is the baryon-to-photon number den-
sity ratio, η10 (η in units of 10

−10), determined either from
the CMB observation (η10 ¼ 6.09� 0.06) or as a range
considered to be allowed by other light nuclei observables
(5.8 ≤ η10 ≤ 6.6, 95% C.L.) [27]. We have adopted an
updated set of reaction rates [28] for the twelve most
important reactions (as defined in Ref. [22]), and details on
each individual rate are provided in the Supplemental
Material [21]. The results for the Li/H production are
shown in Table I. The uncertainty associated with the Li/H
yield in the present calculation is of the order of 8%,
evaluated adopting the upper and lower limits of the rate, as
shown in Fig. 3. The new results reported in this work
essentially lead to, at most, a 12% decrease in the lithium
production relative to previous estimations, a change that
does not have a significant impact on the cosmological
lithium problem.
The present data can also provide information on the

cross section of the 7Liðp; nÞ7Be reaction, one of the most
important reactions for neutron production at low-energy
accelerators, widely used for a variety of applications. In

particular, for proton energies slightly above the reaction
threshold, namely around 1912 keV, the forward-emitted
neutrons from thick 7Li targets show a quasi-Maxwellian
energy distribution that mimics the stellar neutron spectrum
at k; T ∼ 25 keV, a feature that makes this neutron source
very attractive for astrophysics-related studies [29]. The
excitation function of this reaction is of crucial importance
for an accurate estimate of the neutron yield and spectrum
in thick targets (see, for example, Refs. [30,31]). Direct
measurements of the 7Liðp; nÞ7Be reaction cross section
near the threshold (Ep ¼ 1880.3 keV) are difficult to
perform, due to the low energy of the emitted neutrons
(∼30 keV at the threshold), the need of a proton beam
of stable and well-calibrated energy, and the relatively
poor resolution related to the energy loss of protons inside
the target. For these reasons, discrepancies exist between
various data sets near threshold, as shown in Refs. [32,33].
On the contrary, the 7Beðn; pÞ data are not affected by those
experimental problems, and can therefore be used for a very
accurate determination of the excitation function through
Eq. (2). The results are shown in Fig. 4. Compared with
direct measurements, the extracted excitation function
shows a much faster rise above the threshold, as it is not
affected by the resolution problems of direct measurements.
The new data can be used for more accurate calculations
of the reaction yield and neutron spectrum in the near-
threshold 7Liðp; nÞ reactions.
In conclusion, a new measurement of the 7Beðn; pÞ7Li

reaction from thermal to ∼325 keV neutron energy has
been performed at n_TOF with a high-purity sample
produced at ISOLDE, demonstrating the feasibility of
neutron measurements on samples produced at radioactive
beam facilities. The cross section is higher than previously
recognized at low energy, by ∼40%, but consistent with
current evaluations above 50 keV. The new estimate of
the 7Be destruction rate based on the new results yields a
decrease of the predicted cosmological lithium abundance

of ∼10%, insufficient to provide a viable solution to the
cosmological lithium problem. The two n_TOF measure-
ments of ðn; αÞ and ðn; pÞ cross sections of 7Be can finally
rule out neutron-induced reactions, and possibly nuclear
physics, as a potential explanation of the CLiP, leaving all
alternative physics and astronomical scenarios still open.
