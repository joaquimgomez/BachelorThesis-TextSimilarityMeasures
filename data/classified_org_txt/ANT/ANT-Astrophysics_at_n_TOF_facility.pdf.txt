The n_TOF Collaboration          † (deceased) 

 

The neutron time of flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN is a neutron spallation source, its white 

neutron energy spectrum ranges from thermal to several GeV, covering the full energy range of 

interest for nuclear astrophysics, in particular for measurements of the neutron capture crtoss 

section required in s-process nucleosynthesis. This contribution gives an overview on the 

astrophysical program made at  n_TOF facility, the results and the implications will be reported.  

 

1. Stellar nucleosyntesis  

 

The origin of the elements is an important topic to understand the evolution of the universe. 

Hydrogen and helium, and small amounts of lithium, were formed in the period between about 100 

seconds and 20 minutes after the big bang [1]. This period of primordial nucleosynthesis was 

followed by galactic condensation and the formations of the stars. All elements heavier than 

lithium have been formed in stars, and the elements heavier than iron have been formed via neutron 

capture processes in the stars. The isotopic abundances in the solar system reflect the average 

composition of the galaxy as it was 5.5 x 10
9
 years ago. Spectral information of stellar 



environments and isotopic analyses of presolar dust grains provide important observation to 

validate stellar evolution models.  

 

1.1  The s-process  

 

Stellar nucleosynthesis has first been extensively reviewed in the reference work [2] and 

more recently in [3][4]. The isotopes up to 
56

Fe can be synthesized by fusion reactions during the 

different stages of the evolution of a star. It is nowadays well established that neutron capture 

processes in red giant stars and supernovae are responsible for the formation of nearly all isotopes 

with higher masses [1][5]. This was first recognized by the discovery of technetium in red giant 

stars [6].  

 
Figure 1.2 s-process path in the Sn region with s-only and r-only isotopes 

 

The neutron capture mechanisms are known as s- and r-processes, where “s”  stands for 

slow and “r” for rapid referring to the time scale of the -decay. The neutron source are manly the 
22

Ne(,n)
25

Mg and 
13

C(,n)
16

O reactions. The s- and r- processes are important for the stable and 

neutron reach isotopes. A thorough knowledge of the s-process, for which much more experimental 

data is available, constrains the possibilities of the r-process. A competing mechanism is the p-

process, referring to photodintegration reaction like (,n), (,p) and (,), they influence the 

abundances from the proton rich side. 

 
Figure 1.3: The chart of the nuclides showing the stable isotopes along the 

s-process, in black, and the s-only and r-only isotopes, in green and red 

respectively 



 

If the compound nucleus is unstable against the -decay, it may decay before it captures a 

second neutron. This is what happens in the s-process which is the principal process of synthesis in 

the red giant stars, where thousands of years may pass between two successive neutron captures on 

a nucleus. In this way many of the isotopes from 
56

Fe to 
209

Bi are formed. Heavier nuclei than Bi 

are unstable and cannot be formed by neutron capture anymore. The s-process path follows closely 

the valley of stability in the chart of the nuclei and ends at 
209

Bi. 

In the r-process the neutron capture process is much faster and occurs on much shorter time 

scales. The time between consecutive neutron captures is the order of seconds. In order to achieve 

the according extremely high neutron fluxes, the astrophysical site for the r-process is believed to be 

of explosive nature, like in a supernova. Neutron capture cross section are a key ingredient in the 

development of stellar models using the calculation of nuclear abundances in stellar environments. 

At the branching points uncertainties in the cross sections can propagate into large differences in the 

production of higher mass nuclei within a given model. 

In a very schematic quantitative description of the s-process, starting from the seed nucleus 
56

Fe and assuming constant temperature and neutron density, for a s-only nucleus the product of the 

average capture cross section kT,A and the abundance of the isotope Ns,A constant 
 

kT,A Ns,A = constant                (1.1) 
 

Indeed this is roughly the case, except for the nuclei with magic numbers (N = 28,50,82,126) 

around A = 88, 140, and 208, which have very low cross sections. These nuclei are bottlenecks in 

the s-process paths, and show up as abundance peaks. The s-only nuclei are shielded from r-process 

by stable isobars of nuclei with lower Z and which contributions from proton rich side of the valley 

of stability are commonly neglected. In the same way r-only nuclei have no contribution from the s-

process. 

In fig 1.3 a simplified part of the s-process is shown in the Z = 50 vicinity starting from 
120

Sn. Some stable nuclides, like 
124

Sn and 
130

Te are not reached by the s-process put but are 

shielded from r-process by the nuclei 
122

Sb, 
123

Sb and 
124

Sb. These are s-only isotopes. The about 30 

s- and about 40 r-only isotopes provide a means to distinguish between the two processes. They are 

given in figure 1.4 showing also the stable nuclides. 

 

2.  The n_TOF facility   

 

The n_TOF facility, based on an idea by Rubbia at all [7], locate at CERN Geneva 

Switzerland became fully operational in May 2002, when the scientific program has started. A 

detailed description can be found in ref [8]. Neutron are produced by spallation reaction induced by 

a pulsed, 6 ns wide, 20 GeV/c proton beam with up to 7x10
12

 proton per pulse, impinging on a 

80x80x60 cm
3
 lead target. A 5 cm water slab surrounds the lead target acting as a coolant and as 

moderator of the initial fast neutron spectrum. An isolethargic neutron flux distribution is produced 

over a wide range of energy (1 eV – 250 MeV). 

Neutron emerging from the target propagate in the vacuum pipe inside the time-of-flight 

tunnel 200 m long. Two collimators are present along the flight path, one of the diameter of 13,5 cm 

placed at 135 m from the lead target and one at 180 m with a diameter of 2 cm for the capture 

measurements. This collimation results in a Gaussian-shaped beam profile [9]. A 1.5 T sweeping 

magnet placed at 40 m upstream of the experimental area is used to deflect outside the beam 

charged particles travelling along the vacuum pipe. For an efficient background suppression, several 

concrete and iron walls are placed along the time-of-flight tunnel. 

The measuring station is located inside the tunnel, centered at 187.5 m from the spallation 

target. 



The neutron beam is monitored up to 1 MeV by a low-mass system, based on thin mylar foil 

with 
6
Li deposit places in the beam, surrounded by an array of silicon detectors place outside the 

beam. The detection by the silicon detectors of the triton and ’s produced in the 
6
Li(n,) reaction 

gives a direct measure of the neutron flux. The small amount of material in the beam ensures a 

negligible level of scattered neutrons. The scattering chamber is made in carbon fibre to minimize 

the neutron-induced  background. 

Measurements of neutron capture cross-sections in the first stage of the project were 

performed specifically made C6D6 detectors, and in the second stage of the measurements a 4 

calorimeter made of 40 BaF2 crystal has been used. 

The data acquisition system is based on flash ADCs with sampling rate up to 1 GHz for 

recording the detector signals during nearly 20 ms off-line analysis. This generate a high data rate 

but ensures an almost zero dead-time. 

In the first phase of the n_TOF project, neutron capture measurements were carried with an 

array of C6D6 liquid scintillator cells. These detectors have the advantage of being the less sensitive 

to scattered neutron. Specifically designed C6D6 where used at n_TOF, in order to reduce the 

neutron sensitivity all the material that could produce a neutron capture in the detector were 

removed or substituted, all the aluminum part were substituted with carbon fibre [10] and also the 

support material was minimized, allowing to perform measurement of isotopes with a large 

scattering to capture ratio. 

Due to the small solid angle coverage and the low intrinsic efficiency the C6D6 detectors, 

which result in an overall efficiency of  ~10%, only one -ray per event is detected from the de-

excitation cascade following neutron capture. For an accurate cross-section determination, the 

efficiency of the set-up has to be made independent on the details of the de-excitation cascade, in 

particular of the -ray multiplicity. 

To this end the pulse height weighting function (PHWF) has been used. It consists in 

suitably modifying by software the detectors response so that the efficiency  is proportional to the 

photon energy E. Under these conditions the efficiency for detecting a cascade becomes 

proportional to the known cascade energy Ec and independent of the actual cascade path. 

In the second phase of n_TOF project the neutron capture measurements have been 

performed with Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC). The design of the n_TOF TAC is based o 42-

fold segmentation consisting of 15 cm thick BaF2 crystal in the form of truncated pyramids. Each of 

the 12 pentagonal and 30 hexagonal crystals extends the same solid angle with respect to the sample 

centre. 

On average the crystals exhibit an average energy resolution of 14% at 662 keV and an 

excellent time resolution of about 500 ps.  

Due to the low cross-section of most the samples of Astrophysics interest measured at 

n_TOF, the C6D6 were preferred for these measurements since the background due to the in-beam  

for those detectors is lower. 

 

3.  Experimental campaign   

 

The Astrophysics experimental campaign was focus on neutron magic nuclei, which act as 

bottle neck for the flow of s-process, nuclei with A < 120, branching points isotopes and isotopes of 

special interest as the Os as a cosmic clock, in the following the description and results of the 

measurements. 

 

3.1 
151 

Sm(n,) cross section measurements  
 

The 
151

Sm is a branching point in the s-process path, in particular, this branching is sensitive 

to the temperature at which the s-process is taking place. The accurate determination of the neutron 



capture cross-section of this isotope can thus provide crucial information on the thermodynamics 

condition of the AGB stars. 

The measurement had been performed with the C6D6 liquid scintillator. The result obtained 

at n_TOF is <(n,)> = 3100±160 mb, a value much larger than previous estimated, all based on 

model calculation, which ranged from 1500 and 2800 mb. 

The firm estimate of the capture rate for the first time base on experimental value allowed 

reaching two important conclusions with respect to the s-process nucleosynthesis in this mass 

region: i) the classical model, based on the phenomenological study of the s-process fails to produce 

consistent result of the branching at 
151

Sm and 
147

Pm, ii) the p-process contribution to the 

production of 
152

Gd can amount up 30% of the solar-system observed abundance [11] 

 

3.2 
90,91,92,93,94,96

Zr and 
139 

La(n,)  cross section measurements  
 

The neutron capture measurement of these isotopes has a particular relevance in the nuclear 

astrophysics; since the Zr belongs to the first s-process peak in the solar abundance distribution at N 

= 50 while the La belongs to the second s-process peak at N = 82. The 
90

Zr and the 
139

La are 

neutron magic and are characterized, like the 
91,92,93,94

Zr, by a low neutron capture cross section and 

are predominately of s-process origin. The most neutron reach Zr stable isotope ,
96

Zr, is 

traditionally considered to be an r-only isotope with a small s-process admixture[12][13]. Its 

abundance is considered to be a strong indicator in the efficiency of the 
22

Ne neutron source during 

the He shell burning episodes of thermally pulsing AGB stars. The lanthanum acts as bottleneck 

between the abundant light n-capture element of the first s-process peak and the heavy elements 

from Sm up to Pb and Bi, it is very important for interpreting the element abundance patterns in 

very old,  metal poor stars. Since the La abundance is completely represented by 
139

La it can be 

used to distinguish the s-process components from the products of explosive r-process 

nucleosynthesis,  the s/ r ratio is of utmost importance for the galatical chemical evolution.  

The major motivation of these measurements was to reduce the uncertainties to a few 

percent, as required to improve the stellar s-process model. The results of the Zr isotopes 

measurements will be reported in more details in a dedicated proceeding of this conference. 

The capture cross section of the 
139

La in term of resonance parameter was measured in a 

large energy range from 0.6 eV up to 9 keV, these results [14] show sizeable differences with 

respect to the previous experimental data and allow to extract the related nuclear quantities with 

improved accuracy, in fig 3.1 is reported the comparison of the Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section 

(MACS) calculated with n_TOF data with other experimental results.

139

La MACS calculated with n_TOF data and FZK and Musgrowe 

data 



3.3 
204,206,207

Pb and 
209

Bi(n, measurements 
 

The Pb isotopes and the 
209

Bi have a special role in the nucleosynthesis, these isotopes 

represent the termination point of s-process nucleosynthesis, this point is reached since the -

recycling of Po and heavier Bi isotopes is always faster than further neutron captures. It is important 

to know the cross section information for the Pb and Bi isotopes with very high accuracy in order to 

determine more exactly the amounts and ratios of these isotopes being produced.   

Capture widths and radioactive kernels were determinate in a large range of energy for all 

isotopes. From these results the MACS have been derived and in many cases large discrepancy 

were found with values of the previous experiment, in figure 4 is reported the comparison between 

the 
204

Pb MACS calculated with n_TOF and the values reported by Bao [15],  

For all isotopes the systematic uncertainties could be improved by a factor two, this allowed 

to have a firm calculation of the abundances of the s-process component and to constrain the 

estimation of the r-process component, the results are reported in [16][17][18][19] 

 

Fig. 4. Comparison between the 
204

Pb MACS calculated with n_TOF data and Bao et al. 

 

3.4 
186,187,188

Os(n, measurements 
 

The time duration of the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements produced by neutron capture 

processes can be used to set limits on the age of the universe [20], among several cosmic clock 

based on the abundances of long-lived radioactive isotopes the 
187

Os/
187

Re is one of the more 

interesting. 

The clock is based on the extremely long half-life of 
187

Re(1/2=43.3Gyr) decay to 
187

Os and 

on the fact that 
186

Os and 
187

Os are shielded against direct r-process production. Then, thanks to the 

well established s-process abundances of the 
186

Os and 
187

Os, the Re/Os clock can be characterized 

by the enhancement in the abundance of 
187

Os due to 
187

Re →
187

Os decay.
