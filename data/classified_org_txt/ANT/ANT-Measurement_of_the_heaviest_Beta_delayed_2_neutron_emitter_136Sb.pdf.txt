Abstract. The β-delayed neutron emission probability, Pn , of very exotic nuclei is crucial for the
understanding of nuclear structure properties of many isotopes and astrophysical processes such as the rapid
neutron capture process (r -process). In addition β-delayed neutrons are important in a nuclear power reactor
operated in a prompt sub-critical, delayed critical condition, as they contribute to the decay heat inducing
fission reactions after a shut down. The study of neutron-rich isotopes and the measurement of β-delayed
one-neutron emitters (β1n) is possible thanks to the Rare Isotope Beam (RIB) facilities, where radioactive
beams allow the production of exotic nuclei of interest, which can be studied and analyzed using specific
detection systems. This contribution reports two recent measurements of β-delayed neutron emitters which
allowed the determination of half-lives and the neutron branching ratio of isotopes in the mass region above
A = 200 and N > 126, and a second experiment which confirmed 136Sb as the heaviest double neutron emitter
(β2n) measured so far.

1. Introduction
The study of the decay modes of unstable nuclei is
an important input to nuclear databases. It provides
information needed to develop applications, improve
simulations and calculations for theoretical models,
and to understand the properties of atomic nuclei
experimentally. In the neutron-rich region, β−-decay
is the dominant mode, however β-delayed one-neutron
emission, discovered by Roberts et al. [1] in 1939,
becomes the dominant decay channel for very neutron-
rich isotopes. The importance in measuring the decays
of neutron-emitting nuclei in certain regions of the
chart of nuclides has been emphasized by international
data evaluators experts [2,3] and by theoreticians, who
need more realistic inputs for levels above the neutron
separation energy, Sn , for their nuclear structure models,
and to reproduce astrophysical environments where the
r -process nucleosynthesis could take place [4–8]. In order
to obtain new experimental β-delayed neutron emission
probabilities, Pn-values, a new high efficiency 4π neutron
detector named BELEN [9,10] has been designed and

developed. Since 2009, BELEN has allowed the study of
the β-delayed neutron emission of many species, some of
them in regions with very little nuclear data information.
This study presents two measurements performed at the
GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research using the
Fragment Separator (FRS) in Darmstadt (Germany) [11]
and at the JYFL Accelerator Laboratory of the University
of Jyväskylä (Finland) using the JYFLTRAP Penning
Trap [12] at the IGISOL-4 facility. At GSI it was
possible to produce the heaviest β1n emitters measured
so far in the region of Hg and Tl with N>126, and in
Jyväskylä the first β2n emitter measured above A = 100,
136Sb, was extracted without isobaric contamination. Both
experiments provided new P1n- and P2n-values for the
isotopes studied.

2. β-delayed one neutron emission
beyond A > 200 and N > 126
Apart from a single measurement of 210Tl in the
sixties [13,14], the available information concerning
P1n-emitters reached only to masses below A = 150
[15–17]. In this nuclear data conference we presented
the results of a measurement in which we obtained,

for the first time, the P1n-values in the region be-
yond A = 200 and with N > 126 for several
isotopes [18]. These included the half-lives of 18 iso-
topes (204–206Au,208–211Hg,211–216Tl,215–218Pb,218–220Bi),
nine of them for the first time, and the neutron branching
ratios for those which are energetically allowed neutron
emitters (210–211Hg,211–216Tl).

This experiment was performed in 2011 using the
accelerator complex of GSI and the FRS facility with
similar settings used previously in experiments around
this region [19,20]. Nuclei from Pt (Z = 78) to Fr
(Z = 87) were identified thanks to a precise time-of-flight
measurement and ionization chambers on an event-by-
event basis. This region comprises the aforementioned
species of interest in the study with positive Qβn-values
and candidates for neutron emission [21]. The version
of the BELEN detector for this experiment consisted of
two rings of 3He counters, 10 in the inner and 20 in
the outer ring, embedded in a polyethylene matrix. The
neutron detector was placed at the end of the FRS beam-
line surrounding the Silicon IMplantation Beta Absorber
(SIMBA) detector [22,23]. SIMBA is a stack of stripped
silicon detectors based on SSSD and DSSSD technology,
and was used to detect the implants and the decays
of the nuclei, allowing the correlation analysis between
implanted ions, β-decays and neutrons. The results from
this measurement are published in Ref. [18], and a more
detailed publication has also been submitted.

3. β2n emission of 136Sb
The BELEN detector has also been used several times at
the IGISOL facility in Jyväskylä (Finland) between 2009
and 2014 [10,24]. This facility can produce radioactive
species of exotic nuclei by impinging a 25 MeV proton
beam on a Uranium target. The reaction fragments are
stopped in a buffer gas cell, extracted and accelerated
towards a mass separator magnet, which separates nuclei
according to the mass-over-charge, A/q, with a mass
resolution of approximately 350. The specific isotope of
interest is isolated using the JYFLTRAP Penning Trap
system (see top of Fig. 1) [12,25]. The extraction of
the isotopically pure beam, from the JYFLTRAP to the
implantation onto a moving tape close to the β-decay
plastic detector located at the end of the beam-line, was
through a tube in vacuum, which was surrounded by
BELEN (see bottom of Fig. 1). In this experiment, the
high-efficiency version of the BELEN detector consisted
of 48 3He proportional counters distributed in 3 rings.
We emphasize the high and constant neutron efficiency
around ε1n = 60% (ε2n = 36% for β2n emission) over
the energy range of interest (see Fig. 2). In addition, an
innovative self-triggered digital data acquisition system
was specifically developed for BELEN [26]. This allows
the registration of the neutrons coming after a β-decay,
including multiple neutron emission (β2n) events.

In this conference contribution we present a mea-
surement of 136Sb with the aim of determining its
double neutron emission probability (P2n-value). Apart
of this isotope, in the latest experimental campaign
at the IGISOL facility, many of the high-priority P1n-
values from the IAEA list [3] were remeasured with
high statistics [24]. In the particular case of 136Sb, the
motivation for measuring this isotope relates to the fact

that it is present in the freeze-out of the r -process
and contributes to the second abundance peak around
N = 82, in the A∼130 mass region. Furthermore it is
present in the fission mass distribution of several actinides.
A preceding measurement of the A = 136 isobaric chain
suggested this isotope to be a β2n emitter [27]. Although
the contamination from other isobars, the double neutron
emission branching ratio was determined to be P2n =
1.4 ± 0.2%, far from the theoretical model predictions
available from FRDM+QRPA which gives a branching
ratio of P2n = 6.2% [28].

In this experimental campaign the β1n branching ratios
for the P1n standards

95Rb and 137I were also measured,
and they were used for the calibration of our system. We
also confirmed the P1n-value of

136Te, which is the β-decay
daughter. Since this isotope is present in the decay chain of
136Sb, an accurate determination of its neutron branching
ratio is needed for the data analysis. Our preliminary value
for 136Te is in agreement with the ones previously reported
in Refs. [16,17]. Although the data analysis is ongoing, it

can be confirmed that a new P1n-value will be reported for
136Sb and that it is also a double neutron emitter. In Fig. 3
the β2n correlations observed during 6 days of beamtime
are shown. A total of 26 βnn net correlated events yield a
two neutron branching ratio of P2n <1%. This is a lower
value than those mentioned above.

4. Upcoming βn measurements
In the next few years, new measurements of β-delayed
neutron emitting isotopes are planned at the RIB facilities
of TRIUMF, Vancouver BC (Canada) and RIKEN,
Wako-shi, Saitama (Japan). At TRIUMF, the DEUterated
Scintillator array for Neutron Tagging (DESCANT)
detector [29,30] is ready to measure βn events. The system
allows one to measure βn events in correlation with the
γ -rays, from the excited states populated in the daughter
nuclei, with the GRIFFIN germanium array [31,32] (see
Fig. 4-left). At RIKEN, the BRIKEN campaign [33] is
expected to measure the most exotic neutron emitters ever
produced, including dozens of β1n, several β2n and, for
the first time, β3n emitters in the heavy mass region A>50.
Currently there are three experiments approved in the
regions around A = 130 [34], the doubly-magic 78Ni [35]
and in the region A= 100 ∼ 125 [36]. The BRIKEN array
is presently under commission and will take first data in the
fall of 2016. A picture of the setup is shown in Fig. 4-right.
