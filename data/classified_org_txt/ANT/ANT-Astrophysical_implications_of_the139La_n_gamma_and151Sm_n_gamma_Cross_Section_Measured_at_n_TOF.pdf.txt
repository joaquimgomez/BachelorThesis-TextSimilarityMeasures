The nuclear resonance parameters and the capture cross section of the neutron magic isotope 
139La and of the radioactive isotope 151Sm have been measured relative to 197Au in the energy 
range of 0.6 eV-1 MeV at neutron time-of-flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN. The description of 
the experimental apparatus is followed by the presentation of the data analysis procedures 
consisting in the efficiency correction by means of the Pulse Height Weighting Function 
technique, in the determination of different background components and in their subtraction. We 
extracted the resonance parameters and the related nuclear quantities such as the resonance 
integral, the average gamma width, the nuclear level densities and the neutron strength function. 
These results improve the accuracy of the existing data. The deduced values of the Maxwellian-
averaged capture cross section, together with the most recent spectroscopic observations in low 
metallicity stars, provide key indications for modelling the nucleosynthesis and the chemical 
evolution of heavy nuclei in the Galaxy.

1. Introduction 

Lanthanum and samarium assume a relevant role in nuclear astrophysics. 139La is a neutron 
magic isotope that belongs to the second slow neutron capture process (Ba to Nd). 
Consequently, it is particularly suited for monitoring the heavy s-process abundances from Ba 
up to Pb. Moreover, solar lanthanum is almost monoisotopic, being composed of 139La for 
99.91% and it is relatively easy to observe in stellar spectra.  

The 151Sm is one of the main branch point isotopes in the s process. The competition 
between neutron capture and β-decay leads to a split of the reaction path at 151Sm followed by a 
second branching at 154Eu. While the additional branch points 152, 155Eu and 153Gd are of minor 
importance, the branchings at 151Sm and 154Eu determine the abundances of the s-only isotopes 
152Gd and 154Gd, respectively. Since the β-decay rate of 151Sm depends on temperature this 
branching can be used to extract important information on the thermodynamic conditions during 
the s process from the local abundance pattern in this mass range [1].  

Since the 151Sm is radioactive, the previous experimental data were derived long time ago 
from transmission measurements by Pattenden [2] and by Kirouac and Eiland [3]. The 139La(n,γ) 
cross section has been measured at Oak Ridge [4] and JAERI [5] while a transmission 
measurement was performed several years ago at the Columbia University synchrotron [6]. In 
order to improve the accuracy of those data and to satisfy the various requests, those capture 
measurements have been performed in a wide energy range at the innovative neutron time-of-
flight facility (n_TOF) at CERN laboratories. 

2. Experimental Set-up and Data Analysis 

The neutron beam at n_TOF is produced by spallation of a 20 GeV/c proton beam from 
the CERN proton synchrotron onto a massive natural Pb target. The characteristics of the proton 
and the neutron beam are extensively illustrated in Ref. [7]. The set-up for the capture 
measurements consists of a low-mass neutron flux monitoring system based on silicon detectors 
used for the relative normalization of the spectra taken with the different samples under 
investigation [8], and two C6D6 scintillators which detect the capture γ-rays. The C6D6 used in 
the present measurement consisted of cylindrical cells 127.3 mm in diameter and 78 mm in 
length with an active volume of ∼1000 cm3. The low neutron sensitivity of the C6D6 was further 
minimized by coupling a thin carbon fiber cell directly to the EMI 9823QKA photomultipliers 
[9]. The innovative data acquisition system is based on fast digitizers, which records the full 
analogue waveform of the detector signal during the entire transit time of the neutron burst [10]. 
These signals are analyzed off-line by determining the corresponding information on TOF, 
charge, amplitude, and particle type [11]. Finally in Ref. [7], the characteristics (mass, 
dimensions and composition) of all samples and particularly of Sm2O3 are listed. It has to be 
noticed that the Sm2O3 sample contains several impurities of other samarium isotopes and of the 
152Eu (β-decay product of 151Sm).

The efficiency correction is based on the Pulse Height Weighting Function technique 
(PHWT). The PHWT [12] consists of modifying by software the detector response R(En ,ED ), 
being En the neutron energy and ED the energy deposited in the scintillator, so that the detection 
efficiency does not depend on the details of the cascade but only on the total capture energy. In 
order to calculate the weighting function necessary for such modification, different sets of 
Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT-3.21, GEANT-4 and MCNP packages were performed. 
The geometry and materials of the experimental set-up were carefully implemented and the 
distribution of the photon source points was assumed uniform in depth and gaussian in profile. 
From the simulated response distributions, the weighting functions, parameterized with a fourth 
degree polynomial, are obtained by the least square method (see Eq. 3 in Ref. [12]). 

 In order to perform accurate measurements of the cross section, a careful evaluation of the 
background is needed. In general, neutron capture measurements at n_TOF are affected by 
essentially three different sources of background: neutrons scattered by the sample, in-beam γ-
rays, and the ambient background. The ambient background is mostly generated by particles 
from the spallation target, which have passed the shieldings and the sweeping magnet. In the 
present case, an additional component, common to all samples and proportional only to the 
integrated neutron fluence, is caused by the cans of the samples (Aluminum for the 139La and 
Titanium for the 151Sm). The background related to neutrons scattered by the sample and 
captured in the walls of the experimental area, in the detectors, or in surrounding materials, was 
investigated by means of a natural carbon sample that was chosen to match the elastic scattering 
effect of the Sm2O3 sample. The effect of scattered neutrons was negligible because of the very 
low neutron sensitivity of the set-up (e.g. the carbon-fiber) and because materials with large 
capture cross sections had been completely removed from the experimental area. Finally a 
quantitative estimate of the in-beam γ-background for each sample is obtained scaling the 
contribution measured with a Pb sample, complemented by a detailed Monte Carlo simulation 
of the interaction of the in-beam γ-rays with the sample under study. The resulting yield 
distribution is scaled by the normalization factor kγ extracted from the simulations and then 
subtracted to the raw spectra of each sample. Finally minor corrections are also performed on 
the subtracted spectra through the estimations of several effects like: self-shielding, multiple 
scattering, Doppler broadening and the neutron beam resolution.   

3. Results and Implications 

The capture cross section of 139La is measured up to 9 keV and is expressed in terms of R-
matrix resonance parameters calculated in the Reich-Moore approximation by mean of the code 
SAMMY. The fit of the resonances is performed in different ways in order to check the reliability 
of the extracted parameters. The main step of the fitting procedure consisted in the extraction of 
the resonance parameters from the background-subtracted capture yields. The spin assignment 
of each level is carefully checked comparing the fitting results of the different assignments 
listed in the various nuclear data libraries: ENDF/B-VIII, JEFF-3.1 and JENDL-3.3. For many 
levels especially when Γn»Γγ, the best fit is extracted fixing the neutron width to the 
transmission values, while in few cases (Γγ »Γn) the γ-width is fixed to its average value. Figure

Figure 1: Left panel: the subtracted capture yield of the lanthanum sample is shown. The continuos 

curve represents the fit performed with SAMMY. Right panel: the 151Sm(n,γ) cross section in the 
unresolved resonance region is compared with the recent measurement at FZK [18] and with the JEFF-3.1 
data (dashed line). The corrections for isotopic impurities, self-shielding and multiple scattering are also 
indicated. 

 
The 151Sm(n,γ) cross section is calculated up to 1 keV by means of the resonance 

parameters, while between 1 keV and 1 MeV, the average cross section is provided [7], see 
Figure 1. All the levels are assumed to be s-waves and the main nuclear quantities are indicated 
as D0 = 1.49±0.07 eV S0 = (3.87±0.33)×10-4. The total accuracy for the 151Sm is estimated on 
average within the 6% and is mainly dominated by two systematical errors: neutron flux and 
PHWT and by statistical contribution. In the case of lanthanum the average uncertainty is 
around the 7% because of larger statistical contribution. According to the new capture cross 
section, the Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS) of both isotopes are accurately 
calculated. It is noticed that the MACS of 139La is in agreement with the recent activation 
measurements performed at Karlsruhe [14-15] while they are much smaller than the MACS 
estimated by the previous capture measurement [4]. Concerning the 151Sm, the previous 
estimations were based on the statistical model calculations and indicated a value at the 
temperature kT = 30 keV between 1.50 and 2.80 barn while the present estimation based on the 
n_TOF data indicates a value of 3.08 barn. 

Including the MACS calculated in the present work in the Thermally Pulsing  Asymptotic 
Giant Branch model [16], the main component of the s process makes 74.2% of the lanthanum 
solar abundance, about the same value estimated in O’Brien et al. (76.9%) [14] and in Winckler 
et al. [15] (70.0%), but higher than in Arlandini et al. [17] (64.2%) who used older and higher 
values for the MACS. Once the s-process abundance is accurately determined with respect to 
the solar lanthanum, the r-process contribution is completely fixed by its residual (Nr = 1 – Ns). 
This estimation is extremely important for the understanding of chemically unevolved stars in 
the Galactic halo where the heavy elements are essentially provided by short-lived massive stars 
through the r process as indicated in Figure 2.  

For the 151Sm, the investigated stellar model predicts an s process production of 78% for 
152Gd, 91% for 154Gd with respect to the solar abundances, see Table 1. Compared to the 
previous analysis [17] we obtain an 10% higher and a 4% lower abundance for 152Gd and 154Gd,

respectively. The missing fraction of the 152Gd abundance can in principle be accounted for by a 
22% contribution from the p-process, consistent with the abundances of the closest p-only 
isotopes 144Sm, 156Dy and 158Dy (for a discussion see the Ref. Wisshak et al. [18]). It is 
important to note that the theoretical stellar models of the p process predict a ~12% contribution 
to the solar 152Gd abundance [19]. To investigate possible variations within the present AGB 
models, the stellar enhancement factor [20] and the β-decay rate were changed within plausible 
limits. The results of this sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 1 where the standard case 
is listed in the second column. Variation of the β-decay rate and the MACS of 151Sm by 50% 
and 10%, respectively, gives obviously rise to a significant enhancement of the 152Gd abundance 
or even to an overproduction of this isotope. In contrast, variations of the β-decay rate and or 
the MACS of 153Sm affect only the small s-process contribution of 154Sm but do not contribute 
to the europium or gadolinium production. Similar changes of the parameters for 152Eu have no 
global effects on the final isotopic abundances. The last two columns of Table 1 are dealing 
with the s abundance of 154Gd, which is not fully accounted for. This deficiency can not be 
compensated by the p process, which is contributing only ≤ 2% to the abundance of 154Gd. Since 
the cross section of the unstable branch point 154Eu is obtained from statistical model 
calculations the 30% variation is certainly justified and almost sufficient to fully reproduce the 
missing 154Gd abundance.
