The newly built second experimental area EAR2 of the n_TOF spallation neutron source at CERN allows to
perform (n, charged particles) experiments on short-lived highly radioactive targets. This paper describes
a detection apparatus and the experimental procedure for the determination of the cross-section of the
7Be(n,α)α reaction, which represents one of the focal points toward the solution of the cosmological
Lithium abundance problem, and whose only measurement, at thermal energy, dates back to 1963.

The apparently unsurmountable experimental difficulties stemming from the huge 7Be γ-activity,
along with the lack of a suitable neutron beam facility, had so far prevented further measurements. The
detection system is subject to considerable radiation damage, but is capable of disentangling the rare
reaction signals from the very high background. This newly developed setup could likely be useful also to
study other challenging reactions requiring the detectors to be installed directly in the neutron beam.

1. Introduction

One of the current challenges in nuclear physics is related to
the measurement of neutron-induced reactions on short-lived
radioisotopes, which often exhibit very low cross-sections asso-
ciated with high specific activity. The newly built second experi-
mental area EAR2 of the n_TOF neutron-time-of-flight facility at
CERN allows to perform (n, charged particles) experiments on
short-lived highly radioactive targets, as low-mass samples can be
used thanks to the high neutron flux of about 107–108 n/cm2/s
obtained with the reduced flight path of 19 m with respect to the
185 m of the older EAR1 [1–3]. This paper describes the experi-
mental setup developed in order to perform one of these chal-
lenging measurements, namely the neutron capture reaction of
7Be, which is important for the so-called “Cosmological Lithium
problem” (CLIP), one of the most relevant problems in astrophysics
nowadays [4,5]. Among the key nuclear reactions, whose cross-
section could shed some light on the CLIP, the 7Be(n,α)α cross-
section has been awaited since more than fifty years. The only
measurement in literature for this reaction channel was per-
formed in 1963 by using thermal neutrons, thus very far from the
relevant astrophysical energy range [6]. The 7Be(n,α)α reaction
considered in this work has two alpha particles in the final state,
emitted back to back with a total kinetic energy of 16.6 MeV (there
are other 8Be levels that can decay through the two-alpha channel,
in particular at 3 and 18.9 MeV, but in the first case the alpha-
particles are emitted with a kinetic energy too small to be detected
in the particular experimental environment, while in the second
case the cross section is extremely low [6,7]). Detecting both alpha
particles with E8 MeV energy allows for an efficient background
suppression. As a consequence an isotopically pure 7Be target is
not strictly needed due to the uniqueness of the decay signature. It
has to be remarked that there is another reaction channel, namely
the 7Be(n,p)7Li, that has an extremely high thermal cross section
(36558 b) and produces a 1.44 MeV proton. One might wonder
about the possible burn-up of 7Be, but a simple calculation shows
that it is absolutely negligible with respect to the loss of 7Be due to
its natural decay (loss that has to be kept into account during the
measurement).

A major difficulty in performing the experiment lies in the
extremely high specific activity of the 7Be target (13 GBq/μg),
which decays by electron capture to the ground state of 7Li
(Branching Ratio E90%) or to the first excited state followed by
emission of a 478 keV γ-ray. Apart from representing a serious
radioprotection issue, this γ-ray load strongly affects the detection
system that has also to withstand the neutron beam. On top of
this, the huge γ-background is deteriorating the signal-to-back-
ground ratio, given the small reaction cross-section expected in
the range of hundreds of millibarn. Additional difficulties are the
background and the possible detector damage due to the intense
neutron beam accompanied by the so-called γ-flash, the large
prompt flux of γ-rays and relativistic charged particles produced

by the n_TOF spallation target.
The improved neutron-flux performances of the EAR2 facility,

and the perfectly matched n_TOF dynamic range, offer the op-
portunity to measure this cross-section in a wide energy range for
the first time. The advantage of EAR2, with respect to other neu-
tron facilities in the world, is the extremely high instantaneous
neutron flux delivered in a short time interval (about 10 ms) at the
sample position, which results in a favorable signal-to-background
ratio when measuring on small mass and/or highly radioactive
targets, as well as on isotopes characterized by a small reaction
cross-section. This experiment was made possible by pushing to
the limits all the relevant parameters: a shorter flight path and/or
a higher neutron flux and/or a higher mass sample would likely
hinder it.

In the following sections the detection technique, detectors and
mechanical structure are described, along with the challenging
requirements and the preliminary tests aimed at proving the
feasibility of the experiment. The measurement was performed
and its detailed physics results are going to be published soon [8].
2. The detectors

The specific detection setup design was conceived following
three main directives:

� large geometric efficiency;
� redundancy, by doubling the target-detection setup for a fast

and reliable characterization of systematic errors;
� α–α coincidence detection mode, for suppression of neutron- and

γ-induced backgrounds.

The most demanding tasks for the apparatus were:
(i) withstanding the radiation damage without major degradation
in detection performance; (ii) picking out the alpha signals from
the huge background. New wide band-gap semiconductor detec-
tors (e.g. GaN [9], SiC [10]) have recently shown very promising
performance in this respect, but so far there is no reliable solution
providing high quality samples with the required thickness and
large area at a reasonable cost. Therefore the chosen approach was
a more traditional setup based on off-the-shelf single pad Silicon
detectors.

Semiconductor detectors were chosen because of their absolute
energy response and low sensitivity to γ-rays and neutrons. In-
deed, low energy γ-rays and neutrons up to E1 MeV can only
produce low amplitude signals in Silicon, with an interaction
probability o10�3C10�4. For more energetic neutrons and γ-rays
the probability of higher energy deposition goes down to the order
of 10�5C10�6 [11]. The basic detector unit was a square pad, 3 cm
x 3 cm active area and 140 mm thick, produced by Micron Semi-
conductor Ltd [12]. Four such detectors were assembled in form of
two independent sandwiches, each one ready to host one 7Be
target. The distance between the two targets was 30 mm, the
distance between a target and the adjacent detectors was 7 mm
(Fig. 1). The sandwich configuration resulted in a large solid angle,
thus maximizing the detection efficiency and optimizing the usage
of the neutron beam. Moreover, the final state of the reaction
under study consists of two E8 MeV alpha particles emitted back-
to-back, which lose energy in the target itself and in air before
reaching the detectors, also depending on the emission angle (see
Section 4.2 for details about the targets). The energy deposited on
each Silicon ranges between 7.0 and 7.5 MeV in the best case
(emission toward the front side of the target) and between 5.5 and
6.8 MeV in the worst case (emission toward the thicker target
backing side). In any case the difference in the arrival time be-
tween the two alphas is much below 1 ns, therefore the huge
background can be strongly suppressed by suitable energy
thresholds and by a comfortable 50 ns time coincidence window
that makes up for possible small delays introduced by electronics
and cabling.

Furthermore, by analyzing the coincidences between detectors
from different sandwiches, one can estimate the rate of random
spurious events, thus optimizing the choice of the best threshold
values for the offline analysis. It has to be remarked that the range
of the expected alpha particles in Silicon is below 60 mm, thus
preventing cross-talk between the sandwiches. Finally, the use of
two independent setups, with targets produced by different
methods, allows to cross-check the results by verifying that they
lead to the same physical outcome. The differences, if any, provide
a hint of the systematic errors, and in the end one can sum the two
data sets, thus improving the statistics.

The energy resolution of the Silicon detectors of about 1% was
measured in vacuum with an 241Am source, a value that exceeds
the needs for the discrimination of the high energy alphas from
the background. However, as the expected fluence was
E1012C1013 neutrons, a clear degradation was expected during
the measurement, although still preserving a good discrimination
capability.

The detection efficiency of each sandwich was simulated by
means of a Monte Carlo code, taking into account the known XY
profile of the neutron beam (Fig. 2) as well as the spatial profile of
the 7Be deposit. As the detectors do not cover the full 4π solid
angle, the single α detection efficiency resulted 67%, whereas the
α-α coincidence efficiency is 39.7% for one target and 36.9% for the
other one. The reason of such a low coincidence detection effi-
ciency, in spite of the almost full coverage of the sandwich con-
figuration, is that the reactions are induced in the 7Be sample al-
most uniformly over the whole surface, which matches the
3�3 cm2 of the detectors, so that there is a considerable loss of
efficiency for the events occurring near the borders. For reactions
occurring in the peripheral region of the target at least one alpha
will almost certainly be detected whereas the other one is likely to
be lost.
3. The validation tests

In order to assess the feasibility of the measurement of the 7Be
(n,α)α cross section at n_TOF, the following four main issues had to
be addressed:

Q1. Would the detectors survive in the intense neutron flux of

EAR2 neutron beam dump.

EAR2?

Q2. Would the resolution degradation still allow to discriminate
the alpha particles from the background?

Q3. Could an electronic setup be fast enough to recover after the
γ-flash, in time to register events produced by neutrons of energy
up to E10 keV?

Q4. Would the detectors and the front-end electronics be capable
of detecting and discriminating the alpha particle signals when
exposed to the very intense γ-ray flux from the 7Be targets?

Therefore, the operational capability and radiation hardness
were tested by a long irradiation of two detectors with the neutron
beam at EAR2, followed by a test with a low activity 7Be sample at
PSI, and finally by a test with a 39 GBq 137Cs γ-source at INFN-LNS.

3.1. Test with neutron beam and 6LiF target

To answer question Q1, a test prototype sandwich was built
and mounted in the EAR2 beam line close to the beam dump, that
is in an extremely harsh environment. Between the two detectors
a neutron converter was inserted, namely a 105 mg/cm2 layer of 6LiF
deposited onto a 1.5 mm thick Mylar foil (Fig. 3). 6Li is a well-
known neutron converter, by means of the reaction

+ → ( ) + α( Μ ) ( )Li n H 2.73 MeV 2. 05 eV 16 3

which has a 940 b cross section at thermal neutron energy that
decreases with the usual 1/v behavior. The two particles are
emitted back to back in the center of mass reference frame.

This setup was exposed to the neutron beam with a total flu-
ence integrated over the detector surface of more than 1012 neu-
trons, i.e. about half the foreseen fluence for the real experiment.
The reverse current was periodically checked throughout this
period, and it increased as expected due to the progressive ra-
diation damage.

The increase in reverse current implies a decrease of the re-
sistivity, and causes a decrease of the effective voltage bias on the
detector. Therefore, the operating voltage had to be correspond-
ingly increased periodically in order to restore a correct bias on the
detectors, starting from the initial 20 V up to 50 V at the end of the
measurement. By the end of the irradiation period a reverse cur-
rent of about 300 nA was reached (Fig. 4), well below the opera-
tional limit of several microamps and in agreement with what has
been observed on the SIMON2D Silicon monitor after scaling for
the different thickness [13]. As the expected duration of the 7Be(n,
α)α measurement was about 45 days with a total fluence (in-
tegrated over the sample area) of E3 �1012 neutrons, the test
showed that the resistance of the detectors to radiation damage
was acceptable.

According to question Q2 the resolution of the setup under the
expected irradiation conditions has been checked using the se-
paration of the 2.73 MeV tritons from the 2.05 MeV alpha parti-
cles. If the two groups could still be resolved after the test irra-
diation, one could reasonably expect that by the end of the ef-
fective measurement the 8 MeV alphas emitted in the 7Be(n,α)

sandwich employed for the feasibility test in the EAR2 neutron beam. Both alpha
and triton peaks are clearly visible in the front detector spectrum (solid line). The
spectrum of the back detector is shifted towards lower energies due to the effect of
the Mylar backing, mostly affecting the alpha peak which is partly cut off by the
electronic threshold.

irradiation is clearly visible, the selection of the triton peak is still possible.

reaction could still be separated from any background events.
The energy spectra measured by both detectors at the begin-

ning of the irradiation are shown in Fig. 5. The front detector was
the one directly facing the 6LiF layer, the back one faced the Mylar
substrate. The threshold was set around 1.5 MeV to suppress the
huge background originating from the nearby beam dump. One
can immediately see that the triton peak in the back detector is
slightly shifted towards lower energy, as expected due to the
presence of the Mylar. For the same reason the alpha peak is al-
most completely shifted below the threshold. In Fig. 6 the spec-
trum of the back detector is shown, as measured at the beginning
and shortly before the end of the irradiation test. Even though a
degradation of the energy resolution due to neutron irradiation is
visible, it does not prevent the selection of the triton peak.

Q3 imposed the need for fast preamplifiers capable of
withstanding the γ-flash, whose exact structure and composition
is not well known due to huge amount of energy released that
paralyzes any detector and its electronics. The γ-flash physical
duration is of the order of a few tens of ns, and the effect on a
detector depends on its physical placement: a detector placed off-
beam watching the target will be greatly less affected than one
placed in the beam. The paralysis duration depends on the type of
detector and its electronics. The main factors ruling the behavior of
semiconductor detectors are the preamplifiers.

To identify time-of-flight signals corresponding to several keV
neutron energy, the preamplifiers had to recover from the γ-flash
as fast as possible. The maximum measurable neutron energy, on
the 19 m flight path of EAR2, was limited by the preamplifier re-
covery time. Table 1 lists a few reference values of the maximum
measurable neutron energy as a function of the detector recovery
time.

A few experimental observations of the waveforms during the
test irradiation showed that common charge sensitive pre-
amplifiers got paralyzed for few milliseconds. A working solution
was found with the linear-logarithmic preamplifier MPR-16-LOG,
produced by Mesytec, which has 12 ns rise time (at 0 pF input
capacity) and 10 ms decay time [14]. This preamplifier features a
nominal linear response up to 10 MeV and a logarithmic one above
this energy. The energy deposited in the detector during the γ-
flash was indeed very high, but due to the logarithmic response
the recovery was faster, r20 ms, even though for some time
during the recovery the preamplifier was in an intermediate state.
It has to be remarked that the data acquisition system at n_TOF
operates in waveform mode, and that the extraction of the useful
information from the signals undergoes a digital filtering to ac-
count for possible baseline shifts. However, the closer one gets to
the γ-flash, the more difficult (or even impossible) it becomes to

detector signals occur very close to the blinding γ-flash, resulting in an increasing
loss of useful signals. See the text for further details.

distinguish signals of the 7Be(n,α)α reaction from the tail of the γ-
flash. In order to provide a quantitative assessment of Q3, a two-
dimensional scatter plot was prepared showing the number of
counts as a function of the neutron energy and of the energy
measured by the back detector of the sandwich (Fig. 7). The triton
region is easily spotted as indicated by the dashed line. The tran-
sition from the linear to the logarithmic range of the preamplifier
occurs between 5 and 10 keV (corresponding to flight times of 15–
20 ms) as indicated by the down-bending of the triton locus. After
selecting triton events inside the dotted line in Fig. 7, a check was
done trying to reproduce the cross section of the reaction (1) by
normalizing to the known neutron flux in EAR2.

Fig. 8 shows that the standard cross section [15] is perfectly
reproduced up to a few keV, whereas it starts to be seriously un-
derestimated at energies above 10 keV.

3.2. Test with a low-activity 7Be sample

In response to question Q4 several tests have been performed
at the target laboratory of PSI and in a hot room at LNS. To de-
termine the counting rate from the 7Be γ-rays in the Silicon de-
tectors, a vial containing a low activity 7Be solution (40.3 MBq,

produced at PSI) was placed close to two Silicon detectors, namely
PIPS_450 (Canberra PD450-19-100, 450 mm2 active area, 100 mm
thickness) and PIPS_300 (Canberra PD300-19-100, 300 mm2 active
area, 100 mm thickness). After calibrating the detectors with a
239Pu–241Am–244Cm alpha source, the two energy spectra shown
in Fig. 9 were acquired.

On top of the decreasing distribution, one can observe in both
spectra the bump corresponding to the 478 keV gamma full en-
ergy peak from the 7Be decay. The observed overall counting rates
were 1.5 and 1.3 kcps, respectively. The geometrical efficiency of
PIPS_450 was E14%, and taking into account the 10% branching
ratio the γ-ray detection efficiency was estimated to be of the or-
der of E10�3. By upscaling this number to the final detector
configuration one could reasonably expect a counting rate of the
order of about 1C10 Mcps. Obviously, the chosen electronic chain
(preamplifier and amplifier) was not able to resolve single signals
at such a counting rate, as the average time between γ-events
would be about 0.1C1 ms, not compatible with the ordinary front-
end electronics for Silicon detectors. Two possible scenarios were
unfolding: either the preamplifier would be totally paralyzed or it
would produce a wide noise band due to the superposition of a
huge number of incoming low energy signals. In order to in-
vestigate this issue, and to provide a realistic answer to question
Q4, a test with a high intensity γ-source was needed.

3.3. Test with a high intensity γ-source

This final test was performed with a strong 137Cs γ-source
(39 GBq, 662 keV) available at LNS. The source is contained in a
cylindrical shield and can be extracted by means of an electro-
pneumatic actuator. In the setup of Fig. 10 the detector position
was tuned by means of a reference geiger counter such that about
109 γ-rays per second were impinging on the detector. This should
roughly correspond to 1C10 Mcps expected in each Silicon de-
tector from the 7Be samples during the real measurement, that
makes the expected presence of E1000 additional pulses
per second produced by protons from the 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction
totally irrelevant. As for the true event rate in the real experiment,
the expected counting rate for alphas was E10�2/s, therefore not
contributing at all to the overall counting rate.

Again, the ordinary charge sensitive preamplifiers were im-
mediately ruled out, as they were totally unresponsive due to the
overwhelming event rate, whereas the Mesytec lin-log MPR-16
preamplifier proved to be capable of withstanding the counting

rate even though showing a considerable noise. Under these
background conditions the spectrum was measured with the sig-
nals from an 241Am alpha source, placed (in air) on top of the Si-
licon detector, with and without the high intensity 137Cs γ-ray
source, as shown in Fig. 11. The presence of the huge γ-background
did not prevent the discrimination of the E5 MeV alpha particles,
only introducing a broadening of the peak and worsening the re-
solution by E200 keV. In the real experimental environment this
effect is less relevant, due to the lower energy of the γ-rays
(478 keV vs 662 keV) and to the higher energy of the alpha par-
ticles (6C7 MeV vs 5 MeV). A threshold around 2 MeV was
therefore considered sufficient for discriminating the expected γ-
ray background.

As for the radiation damage, no appreciable effect due to γ-rays
was observed on a time scale of one day, and the reverse current,
which jumped from 20 nA to 40 nA with the 137Cs source, went
back to the initial value after removing the γ-source. It is well
known, however, that the damage from neutrons is much more
relevant than the one from γ-rays.
4. Mechanical mounting and radioprotection issues

4.1. The chamber and the mechanical support

The mechanical structure of the detector sandwiches used for
the measurement of the 7Be(n,α) reaction at n_TOF was entirely
made of carbon fibre, supported by four short threaded rods
screwed to the base flange of the chamber (Fig. 1). Each sandwich
consists of seven U-shaped layers, of alternating width, thus pro-
viding slots for the two Silicon detectors and the target frame
(Fig. 12).

The design was such as to allow for the initial insertion and
assembling of the four Silicon detectors; then, after fixing the

detectors (a) and the target frame (b).
whole setup inside the chamber, the highly radioactive targets had
to be inserted in a hot cell by means of a remote manipulator. A
final flap, also in carbon fibre, was eventually latched via the
manipulator to fix the targets in place (Fig. 1d). Due to the highly
radioactive targets, the chamber containing the two sandwiches
was heavily shielded with Lead, and had to be closed before any
direct human intervention. The Lead shield was 1 cm thick, fol-
lowing a series of FLUKA simulations [16–18], as a tradeoff be-
tween outside dose rate, reasonable operating distance and time
near the chamber, and its weight. The expected dose rate at 30 cm
distance from a 50 GBq source of 7Be was evaluated to be below
1 mSv/h.

The chamber with its surrounding shield, sketched in Fig. 13,
was equipped with a pneumatic actuator in order to keep it open
during the insertion of the targets. Figs. 14 and 15 show the
chamber during setup and when ready for transport to the n_TOF
beam line.

4.2. The 7Be target

A major challenge in the measurement of the 7Be(n,α)α cross-
section was the availability of the 7Be in sufficient quantity. To
achieve good statistical accuracy, a target containing a few mi-
crograms of 7Be was needed, whereas in the only existing previous
measurement the target mass was much less than a microgram. At
PSI it is possible to extract and separate in one batch a relatively
large amount of 7Be (up to several hundred GBq) from the cooling
water of the SINQ spallation source [19].

Before proceeding with the real target, the preparation was
tested by producing a dummy target of stable Be with a trace
amount of 7Be. After purification from water and organic com-
pounds, the Be was electrodeposited onto an Aluminum backing,
with a loss of less than 0.05% as verified by means of γ-ray
counting.

In order to evaluate possible systematic errors, it was decided
to operate with a double setup, thus making use of two 7Be targets
in the neutron beam, each one with its own set of detectors, to
exploit the redundancy mentioned in Section 2. Therefore, the fi-
nal targets were produced with two different procedures. The first
one was electrodeposited onto a 5 mm Aluminum foil and had a
nominal activity of 18 GBq; the second one, with a nominal ac-
tivity of 17 GBq, was deposited by droplet vaporization onto a
0.6 mm thick polyethylene foil glued onto a carbon fibre frame. The
high 7Be activity required that all the operations, including target
production, were performed inside a hot-cell. A detailed descrip-
tion of the target production will be given in a separate paper [20].
It has to be remarked that employing a much higher target mass
would not likely improve the quality of the experiment: in such a
case the contribution of the gamma ray signals to the background
would become intolerable even to an improved preamplifier.
5. The experiment

Following the target production at PSI, the chamber was
transported to CERN for the experiment. The transport was orga-
nized using a certified container with an additional Lead shielding,
to reduce the external dose rate to below 1 mSv/h at contact with
the parcel. Once in n_TOF-EAR2, which is a Class A Laboratory, the
chamber was removed from the container and installed on the
neutron beam line, by means of a suitably prepared support
structure, with minimal human intervention (estimated duration
less than a minute). The cable connections to the prearranged
connectors were done in few seconds, thus minimizing the ab-
sorbed dose in full agreement with the safety regulations.

The experiment was successfully performed from mid-August

to the beginning of October 2015, with the detectors mostly be-
having as expected. The reverse current was constantly monitored
and, whenever needed, the voltage bias was raised in order to
keep the detectors in full depletion mode compensating for the
radiation damage and for the night/day temperature variations. A
considerable number of coincidence events was detected as ex-
pected, and an example of two real signals is shown in Fig. 16. The
experimental data analysis is currently being finalized and the
results will be published soon [8].
6. Conclusion

For the first time the 7Be(n,α)α reaction cross section could be
measured in the neutron energy range from thermal up to several
keV. Even though the energy range of astrophysical interest was
not fully reached, this is a remarkable achievement, considering
that the only previous information was at thermal energy pub-
lished in 1963. The further extension of the operational energy
range of the setup is being envisaged by developing a specialized
electronics capable of recovering much faster after the γ-flash,
likely allowing to reach the MeV neutron energy range. As the first
measurement looks promising, an improved setup could soon be
ready for a new measurement over a significantly extended energy
range.

The detection techniques, the test procedures studied, pro-
posed and developed for this work, the mechanical setup, the
radioactive target production and handling, and the availability of

the recently installed EAR2 neutron beam line, proved to be ex-
cellently working and could open the way to a new generation of
experiments so far impossible to pursue.
