Abstract. The n TOF neutron time-of-flight facility at CERN is used for high quality nuclear data
measurements from thermal energy up to hundreds of MeV. In line with the CERN open data policy, the
n TOF Collaboration takes actions to preserve its unique data, facilitate access to them in standardised format,
and allow their re-use by a wide community in the fields of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics and various
nuclear technologies. The present contribution briefly describes the n TOF outcomes, as well as the status of
dissemination and preservation of n TOF final data in the international EXFOR library.

1. Introduction
The CERN n TOF facility [1] is used since 2001 for high
quality nuclear data measurements. A considerable amount
of valuable experimental results have been obtained and
published, and new measurements are going on. These
results are important for the end-users of nuclear data,
in particular for the improvement of evaluated nuclear
data libraries. In line with global standards in data
preservation and Open Science, the n TOF Collaboration
takes actions to preserve its unique data, facilitate access
to them in standardised format, and allow their re-use
by a wide community in the fields of nuclear physics,
nuclear astrophysics and various nuclear technologies
for medical and energy applications. In the latter fields,
all evaluated nuclear reaction libraries are built from
the international EXFOR library [2], which has been
successfully developed and maintained for 50 years by
the International Network of Nuclear Reaction Data
Centres (NRDC). Accordingly, the n TOF Collaboration
strengthened the links with the IAEA Nuclear Data
Section and the NEA Data Bank to improve the
dissemination and preservation of its data through the
EXFOR library. The present paper describes the main
n TOF outcomes, and the status of data dissemination
activities.

2. The n TOF outcomes
The facility is based on the 20 GeV/c pulsed proton beam
from CERN’s Proton Synchrotron impinging on a lead
spallation target. A layer of water around the spallation
target moderates the initially fast neutrons down to a white
spectrum of neutrons covering the full range between meV
and GeV neutron energies.

During Phase-I when the first spallation target was
used from 2001 up to 2004, the water coolant also served
as moderator. Starting from Phase-II, after the installation
in 2008 of an upgraded spallation target, the latter was
enclosed with a separate cooling circuit followed by an
exchangeable borated water moderator.

Since 2001, neutron induced reactions are measured in
the experimental area EAR-1 [3] at approximately 185 m
from the spallation source. In 2014, a second experimental
area, EAR-2 [4], at about 18 m from the neutron source
has been constructed for Phase-III and is offering new
possibilities for demanding cross section measurements.
Table 1 gives an overview of the number of measurements
since 2001.

2.1. Phase-I (2001–2004) & Phase-II (2009–2012)

During the first phase from 2001 to 2004 capture
and fission data for a number of isotopes have been

taken. Capture measurements with C6D6 liquid scintillator
detectors concerned both stable and radioactive isotopes
of Mg, Fe, Zr, La, Sm, Os, Au, Pb, Bi, and Th. A
4π Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) [5] consisting
of 40 BaF2 crystals has been used for neutron capture
measurements of 197Au, 233U, 234U, 237Np, 240Pu, and
243Am. Fission cross sections were measured with the FIC
fission detectors [6] for 232Th, 233U, 234U, 235U, 236U, 238U,
237Np, 241Am, 243Am, and 245Cm. Other fission detectors
based on Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters (PPAC) [7,8]
were used in measurements of the fission cross sections of
nat Pb, 209Bi, 232Th, 237Np, 233U, 234U, 235U and 238U. The
full list of measured isotopes and reactions together with
the final or most relevant publication is given in Ref. [9].

During Phase-II in 2009–2012 mostly capture mea-
surements were performed, while new PPAC were used for
additional fission experiments, including the measurement
of the fission-fragment angular distributions [10]. The
(n,γ ) reaction was investigated on additional stable and
radioactive isotopes of Mg, Fe, Ni, and Zr. In order to
handle unsealed, but still encapsulated, highly radioactive
samples, EAR-1 was transformed in a type A laboratory.
After this transformation, measurements of the capture
reactions were performed for 236U, 238U and 241Am,
for the latter two with two different capture detector
systems (C6D6 and TAC). The TAC was also used in
combination with a Micromegas detector in a first attempt
to measure the 235U(n,γ ) reaction using a veto on the
fission reaction. In addition to these measurements several
other techniques have been tested and the full list of the
Phase-II measurements and their references are given in
Ref. [9].

*The numbers between parentheses correspond to additional approved

2.2. Phase-III (2014-. . . )

Since 2014, two experimental areas are available for
capture and fission measurements, and new challenging
experiments are now possible in EAR-2, such as 240Pu(n,f),
244Cm(n,γ ), 246Cm(n,γ ), 7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p). The list
of the 2014-2015 measurements is available in Ref. [9] and
an update is given in Ref. [11].

3. Data dissemination
Publication of results is obviously essential for knowledge
transfer and preservation, but this is not enough when
dealing with nuclear data for applications. Indeed, these
data should be usable and actually used. Hence, once the
data are finalized, published and fully exploited by the
n TOF Collaboration, it is essential to make them widely
available to all users.

In the field of nuclear technologies especially, the
EXFOR library is known as the “Mother of all libraries”
and is the ground for the development of all evaluated
nuclear reaction libraries for particle transport, activation,

dosimetry, standards, etc. Moreover, EXFOR has been
successfully maintained for decades and is continuously
updated by the NRDC network. These two reasons
make EXFOR an appropriate place for both an efficient
dissemination and preservation of n TOF data.

3.1. IAEA recommendations

The IAEA organised in 2013 a meeting on EXFOR
data in the resonance region and spectrometer response
functions [12]. Participants agreed on recommendations
and prepared templates for submission of time-of-
flight spectra to NRDC. The main recommendations for
experimentalists can be summarized as follows.

• Reaction yield or transmission should be reported in
addition to cross sections.

• Data should be reported vs. time-of-flight in
addition to the required neutron energy.

• Total uncertainty and uncorrelated uncertainty
components should be reported separately.

• Additional information necessary to reconstruct
the full covariance matrix should be reported if
correlations due to data reduction are significant.

• Additional quantities of interest should be reported,
such as the neutron flux distribution, energy-
dependent backgrounds and correction factors, as
well as the spectrometer response function to be
used with the data.

3.2. Dissemination of n TOF final data

The raw n TOF data are available on CERN computers,
whereas the final reduced data of interest to users are
generally only available from the physicists doing the
analysis. In order to release and preserve these final
data, the n TOF authors use the IAEA recommendations
and templates as guidelines for the information to be
supplied, with emphasis on data not already available in
the publications.

In order to quantify the status and progress of the
dissemination of n TOF data, one should distinguish
between various acceptable levels of completeness in
data reporting. After publication of the final results, it
is acknowledged that the necessary data to disseminate
and preserve are the main experimental quantities (such
as pointwise reaction yields, cross sections, cross-
section ratios) and the associated statistical/uncorrelated
uncertainty vs. energy with the best possible resolution.
The status of n TOF data available in EXFOR with
this necessary information is considered as acceptable.
The dissemination and preservation in EXFOR of more
comprehensive datasets is obviously encouraged, and
actually done on a case-by-case basis, depending on the
end-use of the data and interactions with expert users such
as evaluators.

Figure 1 and Table 2 illustrate the excellent data
dissemination status of n TOF data for fission. It shows
the strong commitment of the fission team, which took the
initiative early 2015 to make these data widely available to
the nuclear data community.

Figure 2 shows the progress for the dissemination of
capture data measured during Phase-I. The situation is
not as satisfactory as for fission yet, essentially because
capture measurements were performed by different teams,
which partly turned to other activities along the different

data. “Final” corresponds to datasets with a final publication;
“OK” to datasets available in EXFOR with all necessary data;
“OK + ongoing” includes also datasets under compilation by
NRDC.

n TOF phases. Nevertheless, the situation is improving and
contacts have been established with authors in order to
retrieve old data and complement current EXFOR entries.

Table 2 shows the global dissemination status of n TOF
data, as of March 2017. Overall, 75% of the datasets
with a final publication are available in EXFOR with an
acceptable status, i.e., all necessary data available. The
current objective is to reach dissemination values higher
than 80% for all reactions and phases. This should be
possible thanks to ongoing efforts to retrieve as much as
possible Phase-I capture yields from backups.

4. Outlook
Experimental data are useful and unique, accordingly they
must be usable, actually used, and preserved. In order
to improve the usability and long-term preservation of

n TOF outcomes, the data dissemination is continuously
monitored: new data are systematically released after the
final publication, whereas the backlog of final data not
available is being reduced. This is made possible thanks
to an improved organisation for the data dissemination,
and of course to the involvement of the whole n TOF
Collaboration, especially for the retrieval of old datasets.
A list of measurements since 2001 is available on the
n TOF public TWiki webpage [13]. That list includes
detailed information on the measured reactions: n TOF
phase, experimental area, detectors, energy range, data
status (preliminary or final), main publications and
corresponding EXFOR entries.
