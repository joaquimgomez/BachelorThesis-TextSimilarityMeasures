Abstract. The rapid neutron nucleosynthesis process involves an enormous amount of very
exotic neutron-rich nuclei, which represent a theoretical and experimental challenge. Two of the
main decay properties that a↵ect the final abundance distribution the most are half-lives and
neutron branching ratios. Using fragmentation of a primary 238U beam at GSI we were able to

measure such properties for several neutron-rich nuclei from 208Hg to 218Pb. This contribution
provides a short update on the status of the data analysis of this experiment, together with a
compilation of the latest results published in this mass region, both experimental and theoretical.
The impact of the uncertainties connected with the beta-decay rates and with beta-delayed
neutron emission is illustrated on the basis of r-process network calculations. In order to
obtain a reasonable reproduction of the third r-process peak, it is expected that both half-lives
and neutron branching ratios are substantially smaller, than those based on FRDM+QRPA,
commonly used in r-process model calculations. Further measurements around N ⇠ 126 are
required for a reliable modelling of the underlying nuclear structure, and for performing more
realistic r-process abundance calculations.

1. Introduction
The third r-process peak at A ⇠ 195, the platinum peak, seems particularly sensitive to both the
nuclear physics input and the conditions of the stellar environment as can be seen in the detailed
sensitivity study reported in Ref. [1]. Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) facilities have enabled the
production and measurement of several waiting-point nuclei directly on the r-process path from
N = 50 to N = 82. However all of the nuclei that lead directly to the formation of the third
r-process abundance peak still remain in the region of the terra incognita. To a large extent this
is due to the very low production cross sections, the limited primary beam intensities available
at present RIB facilities and also the challenging experimental conditions of large backgrounds
and very low production rates. This contribution focuses on the impact of half-lives and beta-
delayed neutrons on the formation of the third r-process peak, and how present theoretical
models compare with the experimental data available.

2. The r-process paradigm around N=126

The aim of this section is to describe briefly the latest experimental and theoretical results
in this mass region, and to explore the impact of the present uncertainties (or discrepancies) on
the nucleosynthesis of the r process. On the experimental side, special focus will be made on
the latest experiment performed at GSI, thus providing an update on the present status of the
data analysis and its future perspective.

As mentioned above, the nuclei which are directly in the path of the r process along
N = 126, approximately from gadolinium to tantalum, could not be accessed experimentally
yet. Nevertheless, one can try to measure neutron-rich nuclei in the higher Z neighbourhood, on
both sides of the N = 126 shell closure, and use such information as a benchmark for theoretical
models. In turn, such models can be applied more reliably to extrapolate the decay properties
of the r-path nuclei. Three independent experiments in the neutron-rich region around N = 126
have been carried out recently at the GSI facility for heavy ion research (Germany). The FRS
fragment separator [2] was used for selection and identification of the ions of interest. The high
energy available for primary beams at GSI, of up to 1 GeV/u, has an advantage over other
facilities in order to reduce ion identification di�culties related to the charged states of the
secondary fragments. Fragmentation of primary 238U and/or 208Pb beams on a beryllium target
was used for the production of secondary neutron-rich ion beams. These experiments are briefly
described below. For details the reader is referred to the cited publications. Only the main
results from each experiment are summarised here.

2.1. �-decay experiments around N⇠126
The first experiment [3, 4] used relativistic fragmentation of both 238U and 208Pb projectiles
for the production of a large number of new neutron-rich nuclei. Several isotopic species were

implanted in a stack of four double-sided silicon-strip detectors (DSSSDs) [5], which allowed
for the position and time measurement of both implant- and decay-events. �-Decay half-lives
were determined after developing a new numerical method [6], which was needed to account
for the high and complex background conditions. Half-lives have been published from 194Re
(N = 119) up to 202Ir (N = 125) [7, 8]. From this experiment, another isotopes have been also
analysed [9, 10], but they will not be considered in this contribution because they have not been
published yet.

New half-lives have been published recently beyond N = 126, for 219Bi and 211,212,213Tl [11].
In the latter experiment, in addition to a stack of three DSSDs for measuring ion-implants and
�-decays, the RISING array [12] of 105 HPGe detectors was used to detect �-rays following the
�-decays. As is nicely illustrated in Ref. [11], by means of high-resolution �-ray spectroscopy it
was possible to perform a validation of the numerical technique described in Ref. [6], which has
been applied in both works [8, 11].

Finally, the latest measurement in this mass region (N > 126) used a stack of six SSSDs
and three DSSSDs [13] surrounded by a prototype of the BEta deLayEd Neutron (BELEN)
detector [14]. The latter allowed for the experimental determination of neutron-branching ratios.
Technical details and a few preliminary results have been reported recently in Ref. [15]. In
summary, the N > 126 nuclei 208�211Hg, 211�215Tl and 214�218Pb were implanted with su�cient
statistics for a reliable analysis of their half-lives. As first approach, the numerical method [6] was
applied to the measured thallium isotopes. As reported in Ref. [15], the preliminary half-lives
thus obtained are compatible, within the error bars, with those reported by Benzoni et al. [11] for
the common Tl-nuclei. Alternatively, despite the large and complex background environment,
we have investigated the possibility of using the more conventional analytical approach based
on determining the half-life from implant-beta time correlations. This seems still feasible in
those cases with relatively large implant rates (see Fig. 2 in Ref. [15]). In the case of e.g. 212Tl,
an ion implant-rate of ⇠3⇥10�5 counts/pixel/s was achieved, being the average rate of �-like
events of about 4⇥10�4 counts/pixel/s. Using this nuclide as example for illustration purposes,
the corresponding implant-beta time correlations are shown in Fig. 1. The correlation area
comprises the pixel where the ion was implanted, as well as the eight neighbouring pixels.

In the spectra shown in Fig. 1 each implanted 212Tl ion was correlated with all following �-
decay events registered inside the aforementioned correlation area of 9 mm2. The time-window
for correlations spanned several times the expected half-life. The background was estimated in a
similar way, by performing backward ion-� time-correlations over the same DSSSD area. After
background subtraction the resulting time-spectrum was adjusted to a simple exponential decay
(the daughter nucleus 212Pb shows a half-life of 10.64 h[16]), as shown in Fig. 1. The preliminary
value obtained for the half-life of 212Tl was t

212T l
1/2 = 44(20) s. This value, although smaller than

the one obtained with the numerical method, is still in perfect agreement (within the quoted
error bars) with the half-life reported previously. From the 14 isotopic species implanted, we
expect that the analytical analysis method can be applied to derive the half-lives of at least
half of them, those showing high implant statistics. The remaining cases will be analysed, most
probably, by applying the numerical approach [6].

The results for the half-lives determined in these three experiments are displayed in Fig. 2-left.
The solid red circle shows the preliminary result discussed above for the half-life of 212Tl.

2.2. Theory versus experiment

Although still far from the r-process path, these measurements can be used to judge the
reliability of theoretical models in the heavy neutron-rich region around N ⇠ 126. Fig. 2-left
shows a comparison between the aforementioned experimental data, and the two main theoretical
calculations available in this region. The blue up-pointing triangles correspond to the model
of P. Möller [18], commonly used in many r-process network calculations. This approach is

based on the finite-range droplet mass model (FRDM) and uses the quasiparticle random-phase
approximation (QRPA) for the Gamow-Teller (GT) part of the �-strength function, whereas
the gross-theory is implemented to account for the first-forbidden (FF) part of the �-decay.
The pink down-pointing triangles correspond to the calculations by I. Borzov using the Fayans
energy-density functional (DF3 version) within a continuum QRPA framework [19, 20]. The
latter approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both allowed GT- and FF-transitions.
Although the contribution of FF-transitions can be neglected at the N = 50 and N = 82 shell
closures, it is expected that around N = 126 they contribute remarkably to the �-strength
distribution and even dominate it above Z�70, thus providing a remarkable shortening of the
half-lives in this mass region [19].

In comparison with the experimental data displayed on Fig.2-left the FRDM+QRPA
calculations [18], on average overestimate the measured half-lives by a factor of 24 (average
ratio of calculation/experiment) in the region N  126, and underestimate them by less than
40% beyond N = 126 (the average ratio is 0.62). The CQRPA+DF3 model [20] agrees better
with the experimental data in the region N  126, showing an average deviation of only a factor
of 2 in that region. The discrepancy becomes again .40%, in average, beyond the neutron shell
closure. As already noted in Refs. [10, 11], theoretical models seem to overestimate the half-lives
before the N = 126 neutron shell closure, and to underestimate them beyond it. The question,
however, is how well these models will perform when one uses them to extrapolate further o↵
stability, into the region of the waiting-point nuclei. To answer this question one can compare the
theoretical models among them. In particular shell-model calculations [21, 17], which became
recently available, seem quite helpful given the absence of any experimental information. Such
a comparison is shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 2, which has been adapted from Ref. [17].
As expected, the agreement of the di↵erent models near the neutron shell closure is much better
than toward the valley of stability (see Fig. 2-left), owing to the simplified nature of the shell
closure. Indeed, comparing the performance of the FRDM+QRPA model against large-scale
shell model calculations [17] one finds discrepancies, which range from ⇠30% up to a factor of
5, with an average deviation of “only” a factor of 2. In summary, one can conclude two things.
First, the uncertainties on the beta-decay half-lives along the shell closure itself are expected
to be less severe than in the N < 126, Z < 82 mass region covered by the r process during
freeze-out. Second, the latest measurements on both sides of N = 126 provide a very stringent
test for theoretical models indeed.

2.3. R-process nucleosynthesis

The impact of the variations in half-lives on the final abundances has been studied in several
works (see e.g. [22, 21, 1] and references therein). We have performed new network calculations
in order to illustrate the e↵ect of the aforementioned shortening of the half-lives along the
N = 126 waiting-point nuclei, as well as in the N < 126, Z < 82 neighbourhood. In these
calculations the so-called cold trajectory of Ref. [1] was used in combination with the single-
zone code of NucNet Tools [23, 24]. Rather standard parameters were used for the electron
fraction (Ye ⇡ 0.47) and the entropy (S⇡ 200kB/nuc). In order to accelerate the calculation of
the r-process phase of the expansions, we used Krylov-space iterative matrix solver routines [25]
as implemented in the freely-available software Sparskit2. The very sparse network matrix
that must be solved during the r-process phase is well-conditioned, so such iterative solvers
converge rapidly, and we found roughly a factor of ten speed up over the default sparse matrix
solver in NucNet Tools when we used these iterative solvers. The resulting abundances as a
function of the mass number are shown in Fig. 3-left. The dotted open circles represent the
r-process abundances in the solar system. The solid black curve shows a reference calculation
performed with the JINA REACLIB library [26]. In the latter database, beta-decay rates are
taken from Ref. [18] (FRDM+QRPA) where no data are available. The calculation provides a
reasonable description of the solar r-process abundance pattern in the region of the second and
third r-process peaks. Discrepancies such as the width of the peak or the region between both
shell closures are not relevant for the present discussion, where the aim is to illustrate rather
qualitatively the impact of reasonable half-life variations in this region. Reducing by a factor of
two the FRDM+QRPA half-lives of the N = 126 waiting-point nuclides, from gadolinium up to
tantalum, one obtains the abundances represented in Fig. 3-left by the red-dashed line. A small
shift towards higher masses is observed, similar to that reported e.g. in Ref. [21]. This seems
to be in contradiction with the solar r-process abundances, where the maximum appears at a
lower mass number around A ⇠ 195. Furthermore, as discussed above, the uncertainties on the
half-lives of the nuclei in the N < 126 region seem to be much larger than those at the shell

closure itself. Obviously, the uncertainty will depend on the complexity of each nucleus and
the di�culties of the model in reproducing the beta-strength distribution and the underlying
nuclear structure details. Since it is di�cult to assess an uncertainty on each particular nucleus,
let us see what is the e↵ect of a variation of the half-lives in that region by a constant factor,
which is of the same order-of-magnitude as the discrepancies found between experiment and
theory (FRDM+QRPA) discussed above. Assuming an average reduction of “only” a factor 12
(the average ratio theory/experiment found above was ⇠24) in the half-lives of the nuclei on the
left-hand side of N = 126, from N = 116 up to N. 125, one obtains a much stronger shift of the
third r-process peak, towards higher masses, as shown in Fig. 3-left by the blue dot-dashed line.
Additionally, the third r-process peak becomes narrower, an e↵ect that disagrees further with
the observed abundance pattern. Thus, one can conclude two things. First, a reduction of the
FRDM+QRPA half-lives in the N  126 region, which is indeed expected both from experiment
and theory, produces a shift of the third r-process peak which seems to go in the wrong direction,
i.e. toward higher masses. Secondly, with the data currently available, the impact on the final
abundances due to half-life uncertainties for nuclei in the region N < 126, may be even more
important than the uncertainties for the waiting-point nuclei themselves. From the nuclear

Figure 3. Abundance versus mass number. Dotted open circles represent solar r-process
abundances. The solid black curve corresponds to a reference calculation, where the decay rates
are essentially based on FRDM+QRPA [18]. (Left panel) The dashed red line shows the same
calculation with a factor of 2 reduction on the half-lives of the N = 126 waiting point nuclei.
The blue dash-dotted line shows the abundances obtained when the half-lives of the nuclei on
the left-hand side of the waiting points, from N = 116 up to N = 125, were shortened by a factor
of 12. See text for details. (Right panel) Dashed-dotted line shows the e↵ect of a reduction by
a factor of 10 on the neutron emission probabilities for nuclei in the 116 < N  126 region.
The blue dotted line corresponds to an enhancement, by a factor of 10, of the neutron emission
probabilities of the same nuclei. The blue dashed line shows the impact of a reduction by a
factor of 2 on the neutron branchings.

physics point of view, the discrepancy between shorter half-lives and the position (and width) of
the third r-process peak, may be counterbalanced by the e↵ect of �-delayed neutron emission.
Indeed, for a given Q� value, shorter half-lives usually correlate with a small neutron emission
probability. The impact of (smaller) neutron emission probabilities on the final abundances is
discussed in Sec. 3.

3. �-Delayed neutron emission around N⇠126
The emission of �-delayed neutrons plays an important role in the formation of the third r-
process peak [18, 1]. However, the situation in terms of experimental information becomes really
critical around N ⇠ 126, as demonstrated in Fig. 4-left. In the latter figure, nuclei where any
experimental information [16] is known about their beta-delayed neutron emission probability

are shown in red. For the sake of comparison, the r-process path at some stage of a network
calculation is also shown in the same figure. It is worth emphasising that beyond A ⇠ 150 there
is practically no experimental information available. The only data available around N ⇠ 126
are on 210Tl [27].

Motivated by this situation we used the BELEN neutron detector in the last experiment
performed at GSI around N & 126. The detector consisted of 30 proportional counters of
3He embedded in a polyethylene matrix which served as moderator. More details about this
measurement can be found in Ref. [15]. The analysis of the beta-delayed neutron emission
probabilities is still ongoing. Following the example shown before for 212Tl, the spectrum of
beta-delayed neutrons registered after the decays of 212Tl is shown in Fig. 4-right. These are
implant-�-neutron correlations, which could be observed mostly due to the high e�ciency of
BELEN, which was of ⇠40%. Using this kind of correlation analysis, we expect to obtain
neutron branching ratios (or upper limits) for all the implanted species.

Since there is no experimental information on neutron-emission probabilities in the mass-
region around N = 126, it is not possible to study reliably the capability of theoretical models
for predicting the e↵ect of neutron emission. However, one can again compare the predictions of
di↵erent models among themselves. One such comparison is shown in Fig. 17 of Ref. [17] for the
three models described above, FRDM+QRPA [18], DF3+CQRPA [20] and LSSM [17]. For the
waiting points with Z<69, the neutron emission probabilities predicted by the FRDM+QRPA
are, on average, a factor of 3 larger than the values calculated with the LSSM. This ratio becomes
⇠0.6 for the waiting point nuclei with Z�69, mostly due to the contribution of FF transitions.
It is not straight-forward to predict, what the uncertainties in the calculated neutron-emission
probabilities would be, in particular for the neutron-rich nuclei involved during the freeze-out
phase. In this case, variations of the neutron-branching ratios are rather arbitrary, but they
can still be used for a qualitative interpretation of the large uncertainties in these quantities.
In this respect, Fig. 3-right shows the e↵ect of neutron-branching variations in the mass region
116 < N  126. Final abundances obtained when the neutron emission probabilities are reduced
by a factor of 2 are shown by the blue dashed line. The red dash-dotted line shows the e↵ect of
a factor of 10 reduction in the neutron branching ratios. The blue dotted line corresponds to a
factor of 10 enhancement of the neutron branching ratios.

In summary, the discrepancy between shorter half-lives and the formation of the third peak
discussed in Sec. 2 could be compensated, at least to some extent, with a reduction of the
neutron emission probabilities. Clearly, new �-delayed neutron emission measurements are
needed around N ⇠ 126 in order to confirm such a hypothesis, and to reduce the still very large

contribution of the nuclear physics input uncertainties to the calculated r-process abundances.

4. Summary and outlook
In summary, both theory and experiment, indicate that half-lives in the N ⇠ 126 region near
the r-process path should be much smaller than those commonly used in r-process model
calculations (FRDM+QRPA model [18]). This, however, would imply a shift of the third
r-process peak towards higher masses, an e↵ect which is in contradiction with the observed
r-process abundances. From the nuclear physics input, such a discrepancy could be removed
if neutron emission probabilities were also smaller. This seems to be the case, as it has been
shown by recent large-scale shell-model calculations [17]. In the near future, first experimental
values for the neutron emission probabilities of several nuclei beyond N = 126 will become
available from the experiment performed at GSI with the BELEN detector. This will represent
a first test of the beta-strength distribution above the neutron separation energy, but clearly
new measurements are needed in the neutron-rich heavy-mass region.
