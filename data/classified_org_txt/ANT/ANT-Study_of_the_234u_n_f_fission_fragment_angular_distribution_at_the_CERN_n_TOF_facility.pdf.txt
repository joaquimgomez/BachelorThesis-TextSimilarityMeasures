Abstract
The angular distribution of the f ssion fragments (FFAD) produced in neutron-
induced reactions of actinides have been measured with a f ssion detection
setup based on parallel-plate avalanche counters (PPACs) at the Neutron Time-
Of-Flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN. The main features of the setup and pre-
liminary results are reported here for the 234U(n,f) reaction measurement show-
ing a high concordance with previous data, while providing new results up to
100 MeV.

1 Introduction

A deeper knowledge on the reaction cross sections related to the Thorium-Uranium fuel cycle, such as
the 234U isotope, is crucial for the development of New Generation nuclear reactors and the Accelerator
Driven Systems (ADS). An accurate cross section of this nucleus is required for a detailed investigation
of its f ssion barrier parameters, shedding some light on the Triple Humped Fission Barrier controversy.

The angular distribution of the fragments (FFAD) produced in the f ssion of an excited nucleus
plays a role to achieve more accurate measurements of the f ssion cross sections. This is also an important
observable to investigate the properties of transition levels close to the f ssion threshold [1, 2]. The
directional dependence of f ssion fragments (FF) as a result from a transition state is related with its
quantum numbers J, K and M (total spin and its projections on the nuclear symmetry axis and on a
space-f xed axis). Since the 234U has zero spin and the neutron spin is 1

2
, only two values of M are

allowed, which makes this nucleus a simple case to study.
The behaviour of the FFAD is of particular interest above several tens of MeV, where it has been

predicted almost isotropic similarly to the case of proton-induced f ssion. However, recent experimental
results [3] suggest a revision of this assertion.

In order to provide accurate data of neutron-induced reactions, a broad program of measurements
is being performed at the CERN Neutron Time-of-Flight (n_TOF) facility. As a part of this program,
measurements of neutron-induced reactions in 234U, 235U, 238U and 237Np have been carried out at the
last campaign (2012) using a f ssion detection setup based on parallel-plate avalanche counters (PPACs)
developed and built at the IPN-Orsay (France). Previous measurements with several isotopes were per-
formed during the Phase I (2002 to 2003) and the Phase II (2010 to 2011) of the n_TOF project [4, 5].
The angular arrangement of the detectors and targets has been modif ed for the Phase II experiments with
respect to the Phase I to cover all the angular range in the emission of the FF.

The results obtained for 232Th(n,f) with this new setup in the last campaigns of the Phase II con-
f rmed large variations of the anisotropy around the f ssion chances [6]. The 234U(n,f) cross section is
higher than the 232Th(n,f), which makes this isotope a good candidate to study the vibrational resonances
in the sub-threshold region, where the existing data show large anisotropy values. Above the threshold,
the bibliography is scarce and only Leachman provides information up to 15 MeV [7–11].

This work presents the preliminary results of the FFAD analysis of the 234U(n,f) data. The
anisotropy parameter has been calculated and compared with the available data up to 15 MeV, extending
the analysis up to 100 MeV.

2 Experimental setup

The Neutron Time-of-Flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN is characterized by a white neutron source pro-
duced by spallation on a lead target of 20 GeV/c protons provided by the Proton Synchrotron (PS),
covering the energy range from thermal up to 1 GeV. The long f ight path (183.4 m) from the spallation
target to the chamber containing the detectors and targets, located in the experimental area, offers the
possibility to obtain high resolution measurements. Charged particles produced in the spallation reaction
are removed from the beam using a sweeping magnet and two collimators are placed in the neutron path,
the second of which, for f ssion reactions measures 8 cm diameter, def ning the neutron beam prof le.
More detailed information about the n_TOF facility can be found in Ref. [12].

2.1 Parallel Plate Avalanche Counter detectors

The detection setup used to perform the measurements was constituted by parallel-plate avalanche coun-
ters (PPACs). Each PPAC consist in three electrodes, one central anode sided by two cathodes. The
3.2 mm gaps between the electrodes are f lled with the non f ammable gas Octaf uoropropane (C3F8) at
4 mbar pressure.

The electrodes are composed of 1.7 µm Mylar foils covered by an aluminum layer. The anode is
characterized by a very fast signal response, providing a time resolution better than 500 ps. Each cathode
is segmented in parallel aluminum strips connected to a delay line in order to provide information about
the position of the f ssion fragment hit in one dimension. Through the combination of two cathodes, with
the strips placed perpendiculary between them, we can reconstruct the two dimensional position of the
hit in the detector.

2.2 Targets

The targets used in this experiment consisted in a thin radioactive layer (∼ 0.3 mg/cm2) deposited as a
8 cm diameter disk in an aluminum foil of 2.5 µm (the f rst six targets) or 0.7 µm (the last three targets)
thickness built at the IPN-Orsay. The deposition of the samples compounds in the aluminum backing
was performed by electro-deposition. Three samples of 234U, one of 237Np and, as reference samples,
two of 235U and three of 238U were used in this campaign.

The thickness and the mass distribution of the thick backing samples were measured by α spec-
troscopy and by Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS).

Fig. 1: Schematic top view of the PPACs and targets (2012 campaign).

The f ssion chamber containing the ten PPACs and nine targets in between consisted in a stainless
steel cylinder f lled with the gas at low pressure. The detectors and targets inside the chamber were tilted
45◦ with respect to the incident neutron beam in order to cover all the angular range (from 0◦ to 90◦) and
placed in an aluminum bottom supporting them, which distribution is shown in Fig. 1.

3 Data Analysis

The f ssion event identif cation is determined by the coincidence detection of the two FF by the PPACs
f anking the target where the f ssion reaction takes place. The fast signal of the anodes is used for
this coincidence technique, which allows to discriminate the α background and the spallation reaction
products. The PPAC detectors are almost insensitive to gamma rays. The cathode signals were used to
calculate the emission angle of the FF by means of the knowledge of the hit position in the detector. As
was mentioned before, when the fragment reaches the cathode, the signal produced in one of the parallel
aluminum strips is directed to the delay line and propagated along it in both directions. Because every
PPAC is composed of two cathodes, with perpendicular strips between them, in the X and Y directions,
we can obtain the two dimensional position of the FF hit in the detector. Since each target is f anked by
two PPACs, knowing the points of both FF hits in each one of them and assuming that both fragments
are emitted with 180◦ between them, we can design a vector ~VFF , and the beam direction is def ned by
the vector ~Vbeam, see Fig. 2.

Fig. 2: Scheme of the reference frame used to reconstruct the trajectories of the FF, as is explained in Refs. [5, 6].

The assumption that both FF are emitted back to back with an angle of 180◦ between them is
valid because the error introduced by the momentum transfer in the angle measurement at large neutron
energies is negligible as explained in Ref. [6].

Hence, the emission angle of the FF can be expressed through its cosine (cosθ), which is calculated
as the scalar product of both vectors, as given by equation (1).

3.1 Fission Fragment Angular Distribution (FFAD)

The number of emitted FF with an angle θ for a particular neutron energy is given by the expression:

W (En, θ)emitted = Φ(En) ·N ·
dσ(En, θ)

dΩ
(2)

while the number of detected FF is def ned as:

W (En, θ)detected = Φ(En) ·N ·
dσ(En, θ)

dΩ
· ǫ(θ, φ) (3)

where Φ(En) is the time-integrated neutron f uence over the full measuring time, N is the num-
ber of atoms in the sample, dσ(En, θ)/dΩ is the differential cross section and ǫ(θ, φ) is the detection
eff ciency.

68



The FFAD for different energy intervals can be expressed in terms of cosθ, however to study the
angular behaviour, an accurate value of the detection eff ciency is required. Assuming that the eff ciency
is independent of the energy range and that the FFAD is isotropic in the resonance region, we can sub-
stract the dependence on the eff ciency factor in the last equation dividing the angular distribution for
each energy interval by that obtained below 1 keV.

The experimental FFAD (W(θ)/W(90◦)) can been f tted by a sum of Legendre polynomials:

W (θ)/W (90
◦
) = A0 ·



1 +
Lmax∑

L2

AL · PL(cosθ)



 (4)

where L is the order of the polynomial (only even terms are considered) and AL are the coeff -
cients, which are considered up to 4th order. The best f t to the data has been chosen for every energy
range depending on the X 2 value.

3.2 The anisotropy parameter

The angular distribution behaviour in the edges depending on the neutron energy can be studied by means
of the anisotropy parameter (W(0◦)/W(90◦)) which is def ned in this case as:

W (0
◦
)/W (90

◦
) =

1 +A2 +A4

1−

(5)

where the coeff cients are obtained from the previous Legendre polynomial f t to the FFAD data.
Although this parameter does not provide a complete description of the angular distribution, it is

a simple way of comparing our results with the existing experimental data.

The experimental FFAD f tted to the Legendre polynomials of 2th and 4th order are shown in

left panel corresponds to the energy range from 0.46 to 0.56 MeV. This distribution is side peaked,
showing a minimum at the cosine equal to one. Otherwise, in the energy range from 6.31 to 7.08 MeV,
the angular distribution is peaked at the cosine of the angle equal to one, which means that fragments are
predominantly emitted in the beam direction.

The anisotropy parameter has been calculated for neutron energies up to 100 MeV and compared
with other works, which provide data below 15 MeV, showing a good agreement with the previous
measurements, as can be seen in Fig. 4.

The comparison between the anisotropy parameter calculated in this campaign and the cross sec-
tion data obtained in the n_TOF Phase I previous measurement by C. Paradela et al. [4], is shown in the
Fig. 5. It can be seen that the main FFAD variations occurs at the openning of the f rst and second f ssion
chances.

5 Conclusions and outlook

The method used in the present analysis was successfully proved with 232Th by D. Tarrío et al. in the
earlier Phase II experiment at n_TOF [5, 6]. Preliminary results hold here correspond only to one target
of 234U, showing a good agreement with the literature, which provide data of the previous experimental
measurements up to 15 MeV, and extending them up to 100 MeV.

The analysis of the two 234U samples is in progress and it will continue with the 235U, 238U, and
237Np targets. The complete experimental data of the three 234U samples will increase the statistics
providing a more detailed description of the FFAD. This will allow us to obtain a more precise value of
the 234U(n,f) cross sections.

Experimental program on the thorium cycle isotopes will follow with the 231Pa measurement
which is planned for the next f ssion campaign. It is expected during 2015, depending on target manu-
facture.
