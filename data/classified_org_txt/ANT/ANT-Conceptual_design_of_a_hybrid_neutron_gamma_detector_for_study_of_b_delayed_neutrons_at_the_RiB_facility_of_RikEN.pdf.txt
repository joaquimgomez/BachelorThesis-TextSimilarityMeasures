Abstract: The conceptual design of the BRIKEN neutron detector at the radioactive ion beam
factory (RIBF) of the RIKEN Nishina Center is reported. The BRIKEN setup is a complex system
aimed at detecting heavy-ion implants, β particles, γ rays and β-delayed neutrons. The whole
setup includes the Advanced Implantation Detection Array (AIDA), two HPGe Clover detectors
and up to 166 3He-filled counters embedded in a high-density polyethylene moderator. The design
is quite complex due to the large number and different types of 3He-tubes involved and the additional
constraints introduced by the ancillary detectors for charged particles and γ rays. This article reports
on a novel methodology developed for the conceptual design and optimisation of the 3He-counter
array, aiming for the best possible performance in terms of neutron detection. The algorithm is
based on a geometric representation of two selected detector parameters of merit, namely, the
average neutron detection efficiency and the efficiency flatness as a function of a reduced number
of geometric variables. The response of the neutron detector is obtained from a systematic Monte
Carlo simulation implemented in Geant4. The robustness of the algorithm allowed us to design
a versatile detection system, which operated in hybrid mode includes the full neutron counter
and two clover detectors for high-precision gamma spectroscopy. In addition, the system can be
reconfigured into a compact mode by removing the clover detectors and re-arranging the 3He tubes
in order to maximize the neutron detection performance. Both operation modes shows a rather
flat and high average efficiency. In summary, we have designed a system which shows an average
efficiency for hybrid mode (3He tubes + clovers) of 68.6% and 64% for neutron energies up to 1 and
5MeV, respectively. For compact mode (only 3He tubes), the average efficiency is 75.7% and 71%
for neutron energies up to 1 and 5MeV, respectively. The performance of the BRIKEN detection
system has been also quantified by means of Monte Carlo simulations with different neutron energy
distributions.

1 Introduction

Beta-delayed neutron (βn) emission is a process that can occurwhen the neutron separation energy in
the daughter nucleus (Sn) is smaller than the energy window for the β-decay (Qβ). For neutron-rich
nuclei far from stability, β-delayed neutron emission is the dominant decay process. The probability
for a nucleus to emit a delayed neutron (Pn) yields information on both, the β-strength distribution
and the level structure of the daughter nucleus [1]. Most of the ∼3000 neutron-rich nuclei still
predicted to exist are expected to be β-delayed neutron emitters. In addition to the importance
for nuclear structure, Pn values are among the most important input parameters for calculations
of the synthesis of neutron-rich heavy elements by the astrophysical rapid neutron-capture process
(r-process) [2]. Determining many yet unmeasured Pn values is critical for testing the conditions of
the astrophysical environment, and to provide clues about the sites of the r-process. Consequently,
the measurement of β-delayed neutron emission probabilities provides unique information about
the nuclear structure in exotic nuclei and contributes to the understanding of the formation of the
heavy elements in the universe. Pn values are also important for nuclear technology applications.
β-delayed neutron emission plays an important role on the transient response of nuclear reactors

and the quantification of decay heat [3]. Therefore, future reactor designs using advanced fuel
compositions will benefit from the improvements on current uncertainties of Pn values.

The most common approach to measure Pn values consists in registering the β decays of a
specific nucleus in a β detector (Nβ) and the delayed neutrons in a neutron detector (Nn). Thus, for
single delayed neutron emission one can write [4]

P1n =
ε̄β

ε̄n

Nn
Nβ

. (1.1)

In this equation, ε̄β and ε̄n are the beta and neutron detection efficiencies, respectively, averaged
over all β and neutron energies.

Whenever the neutron background rate is comparable to or higher than the delayed neutron
rate, it is better to use the number of neutrons correlated with β particles (Nβn) instead of Nβ . In
that case eq. (1.1) became

P1n =
ε̄β

ε̄′
β
ε̄n

Nβn
Nβ

, (1.2)

where ε̄′
β
corresponds to the β efficiency averaged over the neutron unbound states and ε̄β is the β

efficiency averaged over all states.
Examination of equations (1.1) and (1.2) shows that the measured Pn values are strongly

dependent on the response of the beta and neutron detectors employed. One of the most common
methods to detect neutrons is based on the use of 3He-counters embedded in a moderator material
such as polyethylene or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) [5]. In this case, the response of the
system has to be optimized in such a way that εn becomes as insensitive as possible to the primary
neutron energy distribution. This condition needs to be fulfilled over a sufficiently broad neutron
energy range, comparable to the expected Qβn values involved in the β decays under study. In
addition, the average neutron detection efficiency needs to be maximized for the measurement of
very exotic species, whose production yields are typically very low. These two requirements can be
best accomplished if a sufficiently large number of 3He counters becomes available.

To this aim, an international collaboration has been established, which will enable an ambitious
programme for β-delayed neutronmeasurements at RIKEN (BRIKEN) [6]. The current programme
is focused on the first measurement of many single neutron emitters in the mass region from A∼50
to A∼150, high-accuracy Pn measurements of several known nuclei and the first measurements of
multiple neutron emitters (β2n, β3n, . . . ).

The radioactive nuclei of interest will be produced at the radioactive isotope beam factory
(RIBF) at RIKEN. At RIBF, 238U beams are accelerated by the Superconducting Ring Cyclotron
(SRC) up to energies of 345MeV/u and strike the production target at the entrance of the BigRIPS
fragment separator [7]. The first stage of BigRIPS consists of two dipole magnets and a wedge-
shaped achromatic degrader placed in between. This setup allows one to perform a first selection
of the fission residues according to the difference in magnetic rigidity (Bρ) before and after the
degrader (Bρ − ∆E − Bρ method). The particle identification is achieved in the second stage of
BigRIPS, through the TOF-Bρ-∆E method. This consists in the measurement, event-by-event, of
the time of flight (TOF), the magnetic rigidity and the energy loss (∆E) in order to deduce the
atomic number (Z) and the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q of the isotope [8, 9]. Finally, the secondary
beam is slowed down by means of a homogeneus aluminum degrader and stopped in a stack of

six double-sided silicon-strip detectors (DSSSD) called AIDA (Advanced Implantation Detector
Array) [10, 11]. The latter is axially surrounded by the BRIKEN neutron detector array, which
consists of more than 160 3He tubes of up to six different types, embedded in a large HDPE-block.
Two auxiliary HPGe clover detectors can be optionally inserted from both sides in order to measure
γ rays following the β decay. BRIKEN is the world largest system of its kind for the detection
of β-delayed neutrons. The BRIKEN detector builds upon the experience gained from previous
experiments, such as BELEN at JYFL (Finland) [4, 12] and GSI (Germany) [13], 3Hen at ORNL
(U.S.A.) [14, 15] and NERO at NSCL-MSU (U.S.A.) [16].

In order to cope with the large variety of constituents, the compactness and the geometrical
complexity of the full detection ensemble, a robust algorithm has been specially developed in order
to design and optimize the distribution of 3He counters inside the HDPE matrix. This article
describes a new topological method which is based on a geometric representation of two selected
parameters of merit, namely, the average neutron efficiency and the efficiency flatness as a function
of a reduced number of geometric degrees of freedom.

The present work is organized as follows. The main performance requirements and hardware
available for BRIKEN are summarized in section 2. Section 3 is devoted to describe the topological
algorithm, the simulation code and the figures of merit used within this work, together with the
symmetry aspects related to neutron transport in the HDPE moderator. Section 4 covers the
optimization study for the hybrid setup. The impact of the neutron energy distribution in the
detector response is quantified in section 5 by means of MC simulations corresponding to extreme
cases. A second iteration of the optimization for design of the compact mode is presented in
section 6. The selected configuration for the BRIKEN neutron detector is considered in section 7.
Finally, a discussion of the BRIKEN neutron detector compared to other 3He-based setups and the
main results and conclusions of this work are presented in section 8 and 9, respectively.

2 Main performance requirements and available materials

In a 4π neutron counter, the overall neutron efficiency (ε) is defined as the product of the geometric
efficiency (εG) and the neutron detection efficiency, which depends on the neutron moderation,
the geometry and the properties of the counter tube array. Thus, for the BRIKEN detector, the
maximum achievable overall efficiency is limited by the geometric efficiency of the moderator
(see figure 1), which is 98.5% for the compact setup and 97% for the hybrid setup, respectively.
Furthermore, the maximum average efficiency achieved in a β-delayed neutron counter reported
in the literature to date is 61%, corresponding to the TETRA detector, a hybrid setup using 80
3He counters [17]. Taking this into account, an average neutron efficiency of 60% is defined as
the minimum target value for the present design study. This value of neutron efficiency becomes
comparable to the β-detection efficiency of state-of the art β-detectors. Consequently, a design
with this characteristic mitigates a limitation of the overall detection sensitivity of the full system
due to a poor performance of the neutron detector.

For nuclei with large Qβn values populating states at high excitation energies in the daughter
nucleus, a strong dependence of the detector efficiency on the neutron energymay become important
for the measurement of the Pn value (see eqs. (1.1) and (1.2)). However, such transitions are readily
suppressed by the effect of the Fermi function. Therefore, according to previous experience [4],

a nearly constant efficiency up to neutron energies of ∼1MeV and small variations up to ∼5MeV
represent a reliable assumption. This premise will be confronted with extreme hypothesis for
neutron energy spectra (see section 5) in order to quantify its possible impact on the performance
of the final BRIKEN detection system.

A setup including high-precision gamma spectroscopy compatible with a flat and high neutron
efficiency will benefit several of the measurements proposed in the BRIKEN physics program. The
decay channels of the multiple neutron emitters accessible at RIBF can be selected by gating on the
measured neutron multiplicity and the characteristic γ rays of the daughter nuclei [14].

In summary, the main performance requirements for the BRIKEN neutron detector are:

1. Neutron efficiency higher than 60% up to 1MeV.

2. Flat response up to 1MeV and small variations of the efficiency up to 5MeV.

3. γ-ray detection capabilities compatible with a flat and high neutron efficiency.

To fulfill the requirements of high efficiency and flat response, a large number of 3He-filled
neutron counters is mandatory. 3He -filled tubes are very efficient counters for thermal neutrons
because of the high cross section of the capture reaction 3He(n,p)3H (σth = 5345 barn, Q =
764 keV) [18]. At epithermal or fast energies, neutron moderation is necessary to achieve high
detection efficiencies. The properties of the 3He tubes available in the BRIKEN collaboration are
listed in table 1. Some of these tubes have been used in previous setups for β-delayed neutron
detectors such as BELEN [4, 12, 13, 19], 3Hen [14, 15] and TETRA [17, 20].

A HDPE moderator is used for the BRIKEN detector. The moderator has a total size of
90 × 90 × 75 cm3 and is composed of 15 HDPE slices of 5 cm thickness. The slices are assembled
together by using stainless steel rods passing along the corners of each slice. Depending on the
experimental background conditions, the moderator will be shielded using additional HDPE slices,
cadmium layers and flexible boron rubber material. In addition to that, the use of veto NaI(Tl)
and/or plastic counters is also being considered, and will be tested during commissioning at RIKEN.

γ-ray detection capabilities are implemented at BRIKENby two large volumeHPGe segmented
detectors (clovers) embedded into the HDPE moderator. This operation mode is known as the

hybrid mode. The clover detectors are of the CARDS array type and allow for high-precision
gamma spectroscopy [21]. In the hybrid mode, each clover has a total photopeak efficiency of
∼ 1% at 1.33MeV. In general, the performance of HPGe detectors is affected by fast neutrons when
the total fluence on the detector is high enough. Resolution degradation has been observed for
fluencies higher than 109 n/cm2 [22]. For the BRIKEN detector, radiation damage on the clovers is
not expected due to the very low β-delayed neutron flux produced by the radioactive beams. A very
optimistic estimation of the total fluence is 106 n/cm2 achieved during all the expected campaigns
with the BRIKEN detector.

The neutron efficiency may be limited by the clovers embedded into the HDPE moderator.
Therefore, the flexibility to transform the hybrid mode into a 4π neutron counter is also a design
requirement of the BRIKEN detector. This flexibility is achieved by a mechanical setup allowing
the easy removal of the clover detectors in order to fill up the empty space with HDPE plugs and
additional 3He tubes. This operation mode is known as compact mode.

A special data acquisition system (DACQ) has been developed for the BRIKEN setup. A
detailed description of this system is provided in refs. [4, 23, 24]. The DACQ is a self-triggered
data acquisition system based on VME digitizers type SIS3302 (8 channels, 100MSamples/s, 16
bit) and SIS3316 (16 channels, 250MSamples/s, 14 bit), both from Struck Innovative Systeme [25].
The DACQ is able to handle multiple VME crates and up to 192 channels running independently.
By using the on-board processing capabilities of the digitizers, a timestamped readout with the
signal amplitude is obtained for each channel. The timestamp is provided by a common time
reference distributed to all involved detection systems (BRIKEN counter, AIDA and beam diagnosis
detectors).

3 The topological Monte Carlo optimization algorithm

Apart from the large number of detection elements, the precise geometric arrangement of the 3He
tubes represents the key feature to achieve both, high and flat neutron detection efficiency over
a broad neutron energy range. The optimization of a system combining different tube sizes and
diameters, and such a large number of counters is a rather complex and time consuming task.
Extensive MC simulations are required and the optimal solution is not necessarily unique. In
addition, technical constraints such as construction tolerances, minimum distance between tubes
for sufficient mechanical stability and tube alignment make the optimization problem even more
complex and challenging.

In order to deal with these difficulties, a methodology based on the optimization of a geometri-
cally parameterized counter array distribution is proposed. In first instance, the parameters of merit
are defined (see section 3.2) in order to guide the selection of the most convenient configuration,
according to some specific physics requirements. The shape of the array builds upon the symmetries
associated to the process of transport and moderation of neutrons in the HDPE (see section 3.3).
Secondly, a mathematical analysis is carried out (see section 3.4) in order to obtain an analytical
geometric description, which describes any feasible distribution of a certain number of 3He tubes
within a given HDPE volume. For this to become effective, the geometry model needs to have as
few parameters as possible, typically two or three.

The MC simulations have been implemented in Geant4 version 10.0.3 [28]. Data libraries
provided by default with this version have been used. The calculations were carried out on a desktop
computer running onUBUNTU14.04with g++ version 4.8.4. Currently,Geant4 calculations using
neutron proportional counters moderated with HDPE results in good agreement with calculations
using the standard code MCNPX (Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended, developed by Los Alamos
National Laboratory) and with experimental measurements [29]. In previous versions, there was a
systematic bias in the calculated efficiency due to bugs in the interpolation routines of the thermal
libraries [30]. Final corrections for these bugs have been introduced in versions 10.0 and later.
Benchmark calculations between Geant4 (10.0.3) and MCNPX (version 2.5) for a simplified
BRIKEN geometry have yielded relative differences in the efficiency of less than 1% [31].

The use of two large volume HPGe clover detectors implies that the hybrid configuration is the
most complex case in this study. Therefore, we start the design study with the hybrid configuration
(see section 4). Counters of type B to E (see table 1) have been used for this setup because their
diameter and length fit better to the geometrical constrains of the HDPE moderator. The response
of the optimized hybrid arrays is studied for different neutron spectra in order to identify the best
suited configurations for the compact mode (see section 5). Once a suitable hybrid setup has been
found, in a second iteration, the compact configuration design will be tackled (see section 6). In
this case, tubes of type N have been added to the optimal configuration for the hybrid mode. A
further optimization of type N tubes in the counter array is carried out in order to obtain an optimal
configuration for the compact setup.

3.1 Geant4 detector model and simulations

The generic geometry implemented in Geant4 is presented in figure 1. The HDPE moderator
matrix for the hybrid setup is shown in figure 1a. The central square holes are designed to host
both, the HPGe clover detectors and AIDA. Figure 1b and figure 1c show generic representations of
the counter array distributions for the hybrid and compact geometries, respectively. In the detector
model, the HDPE density is 0.95 g/cm3 and the room temperature is set to 293.6 K . The simulation
of 3He counters is implemented using active and passive volumes [29]. Thematerial and dimensions
for each tube type are defined according to the information provided by the manufacturer in the
data sheet. In the simulation, detected events correspond to energy deposition from 150 keV up to
900 keV inside the 3He active volume, this range corresponds to the typical energy window for the
3He counters. The Geant4 general particle source (GPS) has been used for the implementation of
a particle generator for mono-energetic neutrons. The generator is also able to reproduce the energy
distributions taken from data libraries or experimental data. The neutrons are emitted isotropically
from a point source placed at the center of the moderator (see figure 1). For the optimization of the
counter array, calculations have been carried out for a set of discrete neutron energies, namely

En = {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}, in MeV. (3.1)

3.2 Parameters of merit

For a neutron energy in the set En, the neutron efficiency is calculated from ε(Ei) =(Detected
events)/(Processed neutrons with initial energy Ei). Two figures of merit are defined as a function
of a maximum energy limit (Emax):

Uncertainties in the efficiency are estimated from the statistical errors. Uncertainties associated
with the flatness are estimated from error propagation for the quotient.

3.3 Symmetry aspects related to neutron transport

Neutrons in the moderator undergo a reduction of their initial energy by multiple scattering with
hydrogen nuclei. The capture reactions inside the 3He counters typically start to be significant
for moderated energies below ∼ 1 eV. The neutrons can also be captured in the moderator through
(n, γ) reactions with hydrogen and carbon nuclei. Capture reactions in the wall of the counters
are negligible given the small cross sections of the constituent materials (aluminum and stainless
steel). Some neutrons escape from the moderator without any capture reaction. As it can be seen
in figure 2, the main losses of neutrons take place through the holes and the adjacent region for the
HPGe clover detectors and AIDA, respectively. Thus, the internal geometry of the moderator and

(XY and ZY-projection) is shown on top and bottom, respectively.

the position of the counters in these regions become relevant for the optimization of the BRIKEN
detector performance.

In previous compact setups such as NERO, BELEN or 3Hen, the moderator has a central hole
to accommodate an implantation system and a β detector. For such a geometry, the counters have
been arranged in concentric rings around the central hole. This design concept is motivated by the
cylindrical symmetry around the axis hole arising from the moderation of neutrons.

In the BRIKEN moderator, the symmetry around the central hole is modified by the holes for
the clover detectors. In order to provide insights on how to arrange the 3He counters, a study of
the transport and slowing down of neutrons in the BRIKEN moderator has been carried out using
the tracking capabilities of Geant4. For the study, 4× 106 neutrons were processed for each initial
energies of 100 eV, 1.0MeV and 5.0MeV. The neutrons were tracked until they escaped or were
captured in the moderator. The last position of the neutron history in the moderator was used to
compute a neutron density, moderated energies less than 1 eV are considered for this computation.
The results of the study are presented in figure 2. The neutron density has been integrated along
the Z and X axis (XY and ZY-projection, respectively), and normalized to its maximum value for a
qualitative analysis. The effect on the symmetries of the moderation process of the clover holes and
the AIDA hole can be observed in figure 2 on the XY-projection and the ZY-projection, respectively.

In figure 2 there are two regions where the neutron density is symmetric: the regions on top and
bottom of the holes along the Y axis, and the zone adjacent to the holes in middle of the moderator.
In the top and bottom regions, the neutron density has an oval shape. At 100 eV, the neutron density
is peaked up to ∼ 4 cm from the border of the holes. In contrast at 5MeV, the peak of the density
is broadened up to ∼ 15 cm from the border. Beyond this region, the density decreases roughly to a
constant value in the external part of the moderator. Consequently, while the counters placed close
to the holes are critical to obtain a high efficiency, the counters distributed on the external parts of
the moderator are important for a flat response up to 5MeV. It is worth mentioning that for the first
group of counters placed in the internal region of the moderator, the separation distance from the
hole borders for AIDA and clovers will also play an important role. This is a consequence of the
high neutron density values in this region (see figure 2).

3.4 Parameterization of the counter array distribution

Around 5 to 10% of the BRIKEN tubes by type have been reserved as spares, to allow a fast
exchange of defective tubes during the experimental campaign. A total of 148 3He-tubes of type B
to E have been used in the counter array distribution for the hybrid mode. Including tubes type N,
a total of 166 tubes out of the 179 available (see table 1) have been used for the counter array in
compact mode.

The counter array distributions for the hybrid and compact modes are shown in figures 1b
and 1c respectively. For the purpose of visualization, only the active volumes are visible in these
Geant4 representations of the detector geometry. By symmetry arguments (see section 3.3), the
following has been assumed for the parameterization of the counter array distribution:

i. All counters are placed along the Z axis, i.e. in parallel with the AIDA hole axis.

ii. The counter distribution has an oval shape.

iii. The counter distribution is closely-packed around the AIDA hole. Consequently, 1 inch
counters are placed in the inner region of the moderator and 2 inch counters are used in the
external region. In addition, it is worth mentioning that placing larger-diameter tubes in the
peripheral region is a way to minimize the impact a sudden failure of these tubes on the
overall detector performance.

For the hybrid mode, as shown in figure 1b, tube types B to K (see table 1) are placed on the
top and bottom regions of the moderator. The shorter type E tubes are placed in the zone adjacent
to the holes in the middle of the moderator. These tubes are placed backwars and forwards of the
clover holes.

For the compact mode, the clover holes are filled up with HDPE. Collinear type E tubes are
put in contact at the central plane of the moderator. In addition, tubes of type N are placed next to
type E tubes in the central region, as shown in figure 1c. Tubes on top and bottom of the moderator
remain in the same position as for the hybrid mode.

To facilitate the assembly of the detector in hybrid mode, the tubes are aligned along the Z axis
5 cm from the moderator border. One of the 5 cm HDPE slices is used as the alignment reference
for this purpose. The only exception is for type E tubes, for which case the edge of the clover hole
is used as the alignment point.

Figure 3. Parameterized counter array distribution for the hybrid mode using 148 3He-tubes. The size of
the central hole is 11.6 cm. The counter array distribution is determined by a set of parametric functions
(~Ri) which depend on parameters h0 and fr . The parameterization is shown for parameters (a) h0 = 2 cm,
fr = 0.0; and (b) h0 = 2 cm, fr = 0.68. The parametric functions are depicted in (b) for the shell index
i : 0 . . . 15 using dotted lines.

Due to mechanical reasons, a tolerance of 2mm has been assumed for the cavities housing the
tubes in the moderator. In addition, a minimum distance of 5mm between each cavity has been
assumed to constrain the optimization of the counter array distribution.

The parametrization for the hybrid mode using 148 3He tubes is presented in figure 3. This
counter array distribution has been achieved by grouping the tubes in “shells” around the hole for
AIDA. Such shells are depicted using dotted lines in figure 3b for label index i : 0, . . . , 15. Therefore,
the position of the j th-counter in the ith-shell is determined in the XY -plane by parametric functions
with the form,

For i : 0, 1, 2 and j : 1, . . . , ni, in cartesian coordinates:

~Ri, j = ŷ · (P0,i + P1,i · fr + P2,i · i) + x̂ · (h0 + p0,i + p1,i · fr + ∆i, j · j) (3.4)

For i : 3, . . . , 15 and j : 1, . . . , ni, in polar coordinates:

~Ri, j = r̂ · (h0 + P0,i + (i − 3) · (P1,i · fr + P2,i)) + θ̂ · (p0,i + ∆i, j · j) (3.5)

Where P0,i, P1,i, P2,i, p0,i, p1,i, and ∆i, j are constants for the parameterization, ni is the number of
tubes in the ith-shell, h0 is the separation in cm from the inner moderator border to the first shell
next to the hole (see figure 3a), and fr is a dimensionless spacing parameter.

In general, for a given shell, the spacing between tubes depends on ni and fr . In addition, the
space between shells depends also on fr . Provided the setting of ni for each shell (

∑
i ni = 148

for the hybrid mode), the impact of fr on the tube spacing and shell separation for the proposed
parameterization is presented in figures 3a and 3b.

4 Hybrid BRIKEN design

Calculations of efficiency and flatness for the parametric counter array presented in section 3.4 have
been carried out. The calculations were done for the parameter space (h0, fr ). Constraining the
computations by the minimum separation between the tube housing cavities results in parameter
ranges for calculation of 0.19 ≤ fr ≤ 0.70 and 0.5 cm ≤ h0 ≤ 1.2 cm. The parameter space was
divided into a grid of 11 × 21 points. A total of 50000 neutron histories were processed for each
point in the grid and the set of discrete neutron energies in eq. (3.1). Such statistics allow one
to identify regions of interest in the parameter space, while keeping the total computational time
within a reasonable limit.

The results of the calculations are presented in figure 4. In these calculations, the typical
statistical uncertainty for the flatness values are ∆F (1 MeV) ≈ ±0.008 and ∆F (5 MeV) ≈ ±0.01.
For neutrons up to 1MeV, a very flat response (F (1 MeV) < 1.1) is obtained with the average
efficiency ranging from 58% up to 69%. For neutrons up to 5MeV, a compromise between the
average efficiency and flatness is observed, the greater the flatness the lower the efficiency. The
average efficiency ranges from 56% to 64%, while the flatness value is 1.13 < F (5 MeV) < 1.4.
Comparing calculations results up to 1 and 5MeV, three regions of interest for optimization have been
identified; (i) the region of flattest efficiency up to 5MeV, (ii) the region with a good compromise
between efficiency and flatness up to 1 and 5MeV, and (iii) the region of maximum efficiency up to
1 and 5MeV. These regions are depicted with dashed lines in figure 4.

Calculations with increased statistics (500000 neutron histories) were carried out for the config-
urations in the above mentioned regions of interest. By doing so the flatness uncertainty decreased
to a level, which was low enough for the optimization purpose (∆F (5 MeV) . ±0.003). Finally,
the optimized configuration for each region was obtained by maximizing the average efficiency and
minimizing the flatness value in the calculations up to 5MeV. The neutron responses for the three
optimized configurations are shown in figures 5a–c. The parameters of the optimized configurations
are reported in table 2.

5 Impact of the neutron energy spectrum

The response of the optimized configurations to different neutron spectra has been studied to identify
which configuration is better suited for optimization of the compact mode. With this in mind, the
efficiency has been calculated for two representative decays with a soft and hard neutron spectrum
for medium-heavy nuclei. The soft spectrum is shown in figure 6a and corresponds to the ENDF/B-
VII.1 spectrum of β-delayed neutrons in 88Br [18]. The hard spectrum is shown in figure 6b and
resembles the one measured for the decay of 84Ga with the VANDLE neutron detector [32, 33]. It
is important to emphasize that both spectra have a similar average energy (Ēn ≈ 250 − 300 keV),
although a significant portion of the hard spectrum extends beyond 1.5MeV in the 84Ga decay.

The efficiency for a 252Cf neutron source (figure 6c) has been also calculated. The neutron
energy distribution has been sampled from the prompt fission Watts spectrum [34]. This spectrum
is too hard for a β-delayed neutron emitter (sample mean Ēn = 2.28MeV), but it is commonly
used for calibration of neutron detectors based on moderated proportional counters. Thus, the
calculation of the 252Cf efficiency provides a conservative estimate of the maximal deviation due to
the hardness of the spectrum. In addition, it provides a reference of the expected efficiency for an
experimental characterization of the detector.

The results of the calculations are reported in table 2. For each optimized configuration, the
ratio of efficiencies ε(84Ga)/ε(88Br) (hard to soft spectrum) and ε(252C f )/ε(88Br) are presented.
In addition, estimates of the efficiency for single (ε1n) and double (ε2n) β-delayed neutron emission
are also presented. For single emission, ε1n corresponds to the efficiency averaged for 88Br and
84Ga. For double emission, the efficiency is estimated from ε2n = ε21n. Inspection of table 2 shows
that the methodology presented in this work has led to optimized configurations with a very flat
response for both representative β-delayed neutron spectra. Even for the harder spectra from a
252Cf source, deviations less than 10% are obtained for all the optimized configurations. When
comparing results for the ratio ε(84Ga)/ε(88Br), ε1n and ε2n in table 2, a poorer performance is
observed for the flattest efficiency configuration with respect to the others. Therefore, the flattest
efficiency configuration is excluded from the further analysis for optimization of the detector in
compact mode.

6 Compact BRIKEN design

The transformation from hybrid to compact mode is achieved by removing both clover detectors
and filling up the empty space with HDPE plugs. The Z position of concentric type E tubes
are modified by putting both ends in contact. As shown in figure 1c, additional tubes of type N
are placed in the central region of the moderator. A further optimization of the configuration of

these tubes has been carried out. For this purpose, the XY -positions of type N tubes have been
parameterized separately for the configurations good compromise flatness/efficiency and maximum
efficiency. These parameterizations introduce a new parameter (gr ) which defines the horizontal
separation between the tubes in the XY -plane. Along the Z axis, the active volumes of type N tubes
are centered with respect to the center of the moderator. Eighteen tubes have been used for the new
parameterization. Thus, a total of 166 3He tubes are used for the compact mode.

The parameter calculation range for the optimization of the compact mode was 0.21 ≤ gr ≤
0.81. The optimization procedure is similar to that used for the hybrid mode. Two optimized
configurations have been obtained for the compact mode. The optimized parameters are presented
in table 3. The neutron energy response for each optimized configuration is presented in figures 5d
and 5e. Examination of these results reveals that the transformation from the hybrid to compact
mode yields an improvement in the flatness of the neutron response and the magnitude of the
efficiency. In fact, for both configurations, the flatness value has a relative decrease of around 3%
and the neutron efficiency has an absolute increase of around 6%.

The responses of both optimized configurations to different neutron spectra have been also
studied. Results of these calculations are presented in table 3. The improvements of the flatness
and efficiency for compact mode are also reflected when comparing tables 2 and 3. In fact, there
is an increase of the ratio ε(252C f )/ε(88Br) towards unity for the compact mode. In contrast, the
ratio ε(84Ga)/ε(88Br) remains constant for both modes.

7 Selected configuration for the BRIKEN neutron detector

Two possible optimized configurations have been proposed for the BRIKEN neutron detection
system in hybrid mode. Both configurations can be transformed into the compact mode, which
yields an overall increase of the efficiency and a slightly flatter neutron response. The performance
of these two configurations, namely good compromise flatness/efficiency andmaximum efficiency, is
summarized in figure 5 and tables 2 and 3. The Good compromise flatness/efficiency configuration
has a flatter response thanmaximum efficiency configuration. However, a negligible impact is found
when comparing the performances for the two representative β-delayed neutron spectra (88Br and
84Ga) in either hybrid and compact modes. For the harder 252Cf fission spectrum, the efficiency
decreases less than 10% in relative terms for both configurations. When comparing the estimated
values for ε1n and ε2n, a clear advantage of the maximum efficiency configuration for the compact
mode is shown, which offers the possibility obtaining an efficiency close to 58% for double neutron
emission.

The BRIKEN collaboration has chosen the maximum efficiency configuration as the final setup
for the BRIKEN neutron detector. This decision has been made based upon the physics program,
the arguments outlined above and the technical advantages of each configuration. To summarize,
the neutron response of the final configuration for both operational modes are presented in figure 7.
An optional configuration for compact mode using only the 148 counters is also presented. This
configuration is the compact one just obtained without using type N tubes. As can be seen from
figure 7, by transforming the setup into the compact mode with 148 tubes, the efficiency is increased
in around 4.5% absolute from lower energies up to 1MeV, but the flatness is impaired. The addition
and optimization of type N tubes increases the efficiency up to 5MeV and helps to recover the flat
response.

8 Discussion

A review of the neutron performance of the BRIKEN detector in its final configuration and other
setups for β-delayed neutrons is presented in table 4. In addition, the average efficiencies for setups
separated into hybrid and compact modes are plotted in figure 8. For each detector, neutron response
functions from MC calculations have been reported in refs. [4, 15–17, 35]. These functions are
used for calculation of data presented in table 4. It is worth mentioning that this table summarizes
most of the setups using 3He counters for β-delayed neutron measurements reported during the last
fifteen years.

Each detector in table 4 has been designed addressing different technical requirement for the
geometric setup, efficiency and flatness. Nevertheless, as shown in figure 8, the roughly trend for
hybrid and compact setups is the greater the number of tubes, the greater the neutron efficiency.
The only exception to this trend is BELEN-20 detector, where the setup was optimized to enhance
the neutron detection efficiency [4]. Additionally, comparison of the BRIKEN compact-148 and
compact-166 configurations indicate that no important increase of the neutron efficiency can be
achieved by adding more counters to the configuration.

According to the publications, most β-delayed neutron detectors have been designed to have
a nearly flat response up to 1MeV. This is also reflected by the values of F (1 MeV) in table 4.
The flattest response for this energy range in the table corresponds to LOENI detector, which was
specially designed to have an energy-independent efficiency [35]. In second place appears the
BRIKEN detector with a F (1 MeV) value similar to LOENI, but an average efficiency up to 1MeV
four times higher. This fact highlights the impact of using a large number of neutron detectors and
the optimization methodology presented in this work.

One of the most interesting features of the BRIKEN neutron detector arises from examination
of the flatness up to 5MeV. The BRIKEN compact-166 and hybrid-148 configurations exhibit the
flattest response in this energy range in comparison with other detectors in table 4. The relative
difference in F (5 MeV) values is significant, starting from around 25% for LOENI and BELEN-20,
up to 72% in the case of the Mainz long counter. Moreover, the average efficiency up to 5MeV
of the BRIKEN detector is still the highest. Thus, the BRIKEN neutron detector is found to be
the best compromise between high efficiency and flat response on table 4. To summarize, the high
neutron efficiency, flat response up to 5MeV, γ-ray detection capabilities and the flexibility of the
setup make the BRIKEN neutron detector the state-of-the-art in detectors for β-delayed neutrons.

9 Summary and final remarks

The conceptual design of the BRIKEN neutron counter is reported. This new system has been
designed to measure β-delayed neutron emission properties of a large number of very neutron-rich
nuclei produced at the RIKEN Nishina Center in Japan. In order to facilitate the design of the
detector, a topological Monte Carlo optimization algorithm has been developed and implemented
in Geant4. This methodology is based on the study of the transport and slowing down of neutrons
in the HDPE moderator, the use of this information for parameterization of the counter array
distribution, and the optimization of the array for high efficiency and flat response.

The design concept of the BRIKEN neutron detector is flexible and allows the detector to
be operated in hybrid and compact modes, whilst keeping a high efficiency and a nearly constant
neutron response. In hybrid mode, the setup is composed of 148 3He tubes and two clover detectors
for high-precision γ spectroscopy (∼ 1% total photopeak efficiency at 1.33MeV for each clover).
In compact mode, the setup is composed of 166 3He tubes and operates as a 4π neutron counter.
The transformation from one mode to the other can be achieved easily between experimental runs.

The response functions for both operational modes are very flat up to 1MeV and decrease
slowly at higher energies. For example at 5MeV, the relative decrease of the efficiency is less
than 25%. Moreover, for two representative spectra such as the β-delayed neutron emitter 88Br
(Ēn = 251 keV) and the harder neutron spectrum from fission of 252Cf (Ēn = 2.28MeV), a relative
decrease in the efficiency of less than 10% is found. For such a flat neutron response, the estimated
efficiencies for single β-delayed neutrons in hybrid and compact mode are around 68.6% and 75.8%,
respectively. Thus, efficiencies as high as 57.5% can be obtained for double neutron emission. The
high efficiency of the detector is essential to allowmeasurements on very neutron-rich isotopes with
very low production rates.

The BRIKEN neutron detector is the result of a joint effort to build a state-of-the-art detector
for the most exotic β-delayed neutron emitters. This setup is going to be used for precise β-delayed
neutron measurements in very short-lived nuclei. For this purpose, a collaboration involving 20
institutions from different countries has been established. The HDPE moderator has been built
during the first quarter of 2016 based on the design reported in this work. The full assembly and
characterization of the BRIKEN detector has been completed by the end of 2016.
