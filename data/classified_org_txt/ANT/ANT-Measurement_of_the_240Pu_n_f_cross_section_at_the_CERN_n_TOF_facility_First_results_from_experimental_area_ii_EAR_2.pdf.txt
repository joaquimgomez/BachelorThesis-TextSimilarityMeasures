Abstract. The accurate knowledge of the neutron-induced fission cross-sections of actinides and other
isotopes involved in the nuclear fuel cycle is essential for the design of advanced nuclear systems, such
as Generation-IV nuclear reactors. Such experimental data can also provide the necessary feedback for the
adjustment of nuclear model parameters used in the evaluation process, resulting in the further development
of nuclear fission models. In the present work, the 240Pu(n,f) cross-section was measured at CERN’s n TOF
facility relative to the well-known 235U(n,f) cross section, over a wide range of neutron energies, from
meV to almost MeV, using the time-of-flight technique and a set-up based on Micromegas detectors. This
measurement was the first experiment to be performed at n TOF’s new experimental area (EAR-2), which
offers a significantly higher neutron flux compared to the already existing experimental area (EAR-1).
Preliminary results as well as the experimental procedure, including a description of the facility and the data
handling and analysis, are presented.

1. Introduction
The optimum design and development of advanced nuclear
systems requires the accurate knowledge of neutron
induced fission cross sections of plutonium isotopes and
other minor actinides [1,2]. More specifically, the 240Pu
isotope is included in the Nuclear Energy Agency’s (NEA)
High Priority Request List (HPRL) [3] as well as in
the NEMEA-4 meeting proceedings [4]. Requested target
accuracies are in the order of 1.6%–11.8% for the energy
region 0.454 keV–6.07 MeV compared to the presently
reported 3.9%–21.6%. The previous experiment carried
out at the n TOF’s Experimental Area 1 (EAR-1), was
unsuccessful due to detector deterioration caused by the
high alpha activity of the 240Pu samples in addition to
the long period needed to complete the measurement [5],
therefore the neutron induced fission cross section had
to be remeasured in the newly constructed experimental
area EAR-2, which offers a higher background suppression
and a significantly higher instantaneous neutron flux, thus
reducing the time needed to complete the measurement.
Similar recent measurements have also been performed at
GNEIS [6], LANSCE [7] and IRMM [8].

2. Experimental setup
2.1. The n TOF facility

The measurement was performed at CERN’s n TOF
facility [9–11], in the newly commissioned experimental
area EAR-2 [12]. The neutrons are produced by spallation,
occurring when a 20 GeV/c pulsed proton beam, delivered
by CERN’s Proton Synchrotron [13], impinges on a 40 cm
in length and 60 cm in diameter lead block, resulting in
a neutron energy spectrum that spans from the meV to
the GeV region. The proton pulse has a duration of 6 ns
RMS, a maximum repetition rate of 1 pulse per 1.2 s and
nominally carries 7 × 1012 protons. The 1.3 ton lead target
is surrounded by a 1 cm-thick layer of water as well as

a e-mail: athanasios.stamatopoulos@cern.ch

an additional 4 cm-thick layer of borated water (H20 +
1.28%H3 B O3, fraction in mass) which act as coolant
and neutron moderator respectively. Following the target
in the beam direction, a beam pipe of 182.3 m leads to
the first experimental area EAR-1. The new experimental
area EAR-2 is located 18.16 m above the spallation target,
perpendicular to the beam direction, offering a 25 −
30 times higher flux [14] and approximately 10 times
shorter time of flights compared to the existing area. The
high instantaneous flux, combined with the wide white
neutron spectrum (from thermal energies to the MeV
region), leads to the relative suppression of the contribution
originating from the high intrinsic α−background of the
samples, thus allowing for accurate measurements below
the fission threshold, where the fission cross section is low.

2.2. Samples

Three high purity (99.89% atomic abundance) plutonium
dioxide (PuO2) samples, prepared at IRMM (Belgium)
[15] for the previous measurement in EAR-1, were used
having a total 240 Pu mass of 2.288 mg (∼ 100 µgr/cm2
per sample) and a total α-activity of 19.219 MBq. The
oxide material was electro-deposited on a 250 µm-thick
aluminum backing with a diameter of 5 cm, while the
deposit itself had a diameter of 3 cm. In addition to the
plutonium samples, two targets were used as reference: a
235U and a 238U , with a mass of ∼ 0.6 mg and ∼0.8 mg
respectively. The impurities found in the samples, mainly
239 Pu, have a non-negligible contribution in the obtained
yields below 1 keV, which was thoroughly taken into
account in the analysis.

2.3. Detectors

The measurement was carried out using a set-up
based on the extremely compact, low mass Micromegas
(Micro-Mesh Gaseous Structure) gaseous detector [16–
18]. Its volume is divided into two parts by a thin,
35 µm pitched micro-mesh: a drift region (5 mm) and
a narrow amplification region (50 µm), in which a high

electric field causes an avalanche multiplication. Typical
operating electric fields are ∼ 1 kV/cm and ∼ 100 kV/cm
respectively depending on the gas, which in this case was
a mixture of Ar :C F4:isoC4 H10 (88:10:2) at atmospheric
pressure and room temperature. The detector set-up
consisted of 6 similar detectors in total (3 for the plutonium
samples, 2 for the uranium samples and 1 for monitoring
possible proton recoils from the surrounding materials), all
of which were housed in a cylindrical aluminum chamber
as shown in Fig. 1.

2.4. Data acquisition

The analogue detector signals were recorded using a high
performance digital acquisition system [19], operating at
a 500 MHz sampling rate with a resolution of 8 bits. To
minimize the amount of data recorded during acquisition,
a zero-suppression algorithm was applied.

3. Data analysis
An offline pulse shape analysis routine [20] parses the
raw data, determining, among others, the amplitude and
the position in time of every recorded signal. During
the experiment, beam-off data was obtained in order
to measure the contribution of the α-activity as well
as spontaneous fission. Monte Carlo simulations were
also performed, using the general purpose code FLUKA
[21,22] to study the behavior of the detectors. More
specifically, the pulse height spectra of α-particles and
fission fragments were reconstructed for all detectors,
making possible both the estimation of the detection
efficiency and the determination of the correction for the
signal amplitude threshold, which was found to be in
the order of 10%. A typical experimental pulse height
spectrum along with the simulated one, is shown in Fig. 2.

The proton interaction with the lead target, apart
from the neutron production, results in the generation of
prompt γ -rays and relativistic particles, that reach the
experimental hall at (nearly) the speed of light. This
burst of particles is commonly referred to in literature as
“γ -flash”. The γ -flash results in the formation of a high
amplitude pulse, comparable to the fission signals, which

typical pulse height spectra for 240 Pu. The direct simulated
output is calibrated and convoluted with the detector’s response
function.

lasts a few hundreds of ns and is followed by a baseline
oscillation in times of flight that correspond to energies in
the MeV region. To mitigate this effect, an average γ -flash
shape is derived for every detector, which is subtracted
individually from each γ -flash pulse, during the offline
raw data processing. A typical average γ -flash is shown
in Fig. 3.

The 240 Pu(n, f ) cross section was calculated using
the reference reactions 235U (n, f ) and 238U (n, f ) for
flux normalisation purposes. The detector dead time,
as well as the background contribution due to sample
impurities were taken into account during the analysis.
The final experimental cross section was derived from
the weighted average between the three individual cross
sections, calculated for each plutonium target. Preliminary
results are shown in Fig. 4 for the energy range 6 keV-
35 keV, while resonances can be resolved up to a few
tens of keV. The present preliminary data comparison
with the latest ENDF/B-VII.1 library [23,24], reveals that
the aforementioned resonances are not included in the
evaluations, as Fig. 4 demonstrates. Resonance analysis is
planned to be performed, using R-matrix calculations, to
characterize the resolved resonances.

In the energy range above 35 keV, data has been
obtained up to at least several MeV. Specifically in the
sub-threshold region between 100 keV and 600 keV, the
shape of the extracted cross section is in general agreement
with the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluations, as shown in Fig. 5.

between Class-I and Class-II states are visible, while resonances
can be resolved up to a few tens of keV. Data is shown using a
binning of 2000 bins per energy decade.

Resonance-like structures are also observed, which are
attributed to high transition states. Above 1 MeV, the
non optimized sample mass caused a high counting rate
which affects the normalisation, therefore analysis is still
ongoing.

4. Conclusion
The 240 Pu neutron induced fission cross section, is the first
measurement to be performed in the newly commissioned
experimental area EAR-2, at CERN’s n TOF facility.
Data was obtained over a wide energy range that spans
from thermal energies up to at least a few MeV. Most
remarkably, data in the sub-threshold region, shows
clear resonance structures which are not included in
the evaluated libraries. R-matrix calculations will be
performed to characterize these structures. In the MeV
region, preliminary data shows a general agreement with

the evaluations, yet further analysis is ongoing. The higher
instantaneous flux along with the stronger background
suppression, compared to the existing experimental area
EAR-1, are deemed crucial to the success of this
measurement, following which additional measurements
are planned that include the study of short-lived and rare
isotopes such as 230T h, 232U, 238,241 Pu and 244Cm.
