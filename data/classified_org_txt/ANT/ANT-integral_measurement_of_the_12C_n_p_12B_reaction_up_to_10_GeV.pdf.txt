Abstract. The integral measurement of the 12C(n,p)12B reaction was performed at the neutron time of
flight facility n TOF at CERN. The total number of 12B nuclei produced per neutron pulse of the n TOF
beam was determined using the activation technique in combination with a time of flight technique. The
cross section is integrated over the n TOF neutron energy spectrum from reaction threshold at 13.6 MeV
to 10 GeV. Having been measured up to 1 GeV on basis of the 235U(n,f) reaction, the neutron energy
spectrum above 200 MeV has been reevaluated due to the recent extension of the cross section refer-
ence for this particular reaction, which is otherwise considered a standard up to 200 MeV. The results
from the dedicated GEANT4 simulations have been used to evaluate the neutron flux from 1 GeV up to
10 GeV. The experimental results related to the 12C(n,p)12B reaction are compared with the evaluated
cross sections from major libraries and with the predictions of different GEANT4 models, which mostly un-
derestimate the 12B production. On the contrary, a good reproduction of the integral cross section derived
from measurements is obtained with TALYS-1.6 calculations, with optimized parameters.

1 Introduction

Neutron induced reactions are important for a variety of
research fields, from fundamental Nuclear Physics and Nu-
clear Astrophysics to applications of nuclear technologies
to energy production, nuclear medicine, material charac-
terization, cultural heritage, etc. Neutron induced reac-
tions on light nuclei – such as Carbon, Oxygen and Ni-
trogen – are of particular interest in nuclear medicine
due to their high abundance in the human body. Partic-
ularly significant in this respect are the reactions lead-
ing to the emission of charged particles. Among them,
the 12C(n,p)12B reaction – occurring at neutron energies
above the threshold of 13.6 MeV – may affect the dose dis-
tribution in hadrontherapy or conventional radiotherapy if
high energy secondary neutrons are produced during the
treatment delivery, since the 12C(n,p)12B reaction leads
both to the emission of protons and energetic electrons
(6.35 MeV average energy) from the decay of 12B. This
reaction is also important for calculations in radiological
protection, as well as for the design of shields and colli-
mators at accelerator facilities, spallation neutron sources
and fusion material irradiation facilities – such as MTS
and IFMIF – whose neutron spectrum shows an impor-
tant tail extending above the threshold of this reaction
[1]. Finally, the cross section of the 12C(n,p)12B reaction
is important for accurately simulating the response of di-
amond detector to fast neutrons [2,3].

Despite their importance, cross section data for this
reaction are scarce and largely discrepant. Figure 1 shows
the current status of experimental results. Below 20 MeV
four old measurements are present in literature [4,5,6,
7], all obtained with the activation technique, with short
pulses of monoenergetic neutrons inducing the reaction,
followed by long beam-off intervals for counting the 12B β-
decay. Recently, Pillon et al. measured a series of neutron-
induced reactions on carbon for neutron energies from 5
MeV to 20.5 MeV, by using a single crystal diamond de-
tector [3]. The measurements were performed at the Van
de Graaff neutron generator of the EC-JRC-IRMM, Geel,
Belgium. Thanks to the high energy resolution of the de-
vice, structures related to various neutron-induced reac-

tions on carbon could be distinguished in the detected
energy spectrum. The cross section was extracted from
the structures identified as due to the (n,p) reaction. The
results, shown in fig. 1, are consistent with those of ref. [6].
However, according to the authors, not all possible excited
states of the residual nucleus could be identified, thus re-
sulting in an underestimate of the cross section. Above 20
MeV only one data point from Kellogg [8] is present in
EXFOR, centered at 90 MeV, but with a poor resolution
in energy and a large uncertainty in cross section.

The discrepancy between existing data below 20 MeV,
combined with the scarcity of reliable data above 20 MeV,
is reflected in the differences between evaluated cross sec-
tions in various libraries, as well as in highly uncertain
theoretical predictions at all neutron energies. The cross
sections reported in the major libraries are shown in fig. 1.
Up to 20 MeV the latest versions of all libraries contain
the same cross section, based purely on the dataset from
Rimmer and Fisher [6]. Among older versions, TENDL-
2009 predicts a cross section a factor of three higher than
all other evaluations. For the reaction considered herein,
this library was based on TALYS calculations [9]. On the
other hand, a drastically lower evaluation is adopted by
TENDL-2010 and subsequent versions. Above 20 MeV

evaluations are based on theoretical estimates. In partic-
ular, ENDF/B-VII.1 has adopted calculations performed
with the Feshbach-Kerman-Koonin (FKK)-GNASH code
described in ref. [10], up to 150 MeV [11]. A completely
different cross section, based on calculations by Watanabe
et al., [12] is contained in the special high energy file of the
Japanese evaluated nuclear data library, JENDL/HE-2007
[13,14].

Models can be used in the main Monte Carlo codes
for neutron transport to estimate the cross section of this
reaction. In particular, the GEANT4 package [15] offers
various options for calculating the cross section of this re-
action, from threshold to several GeV. However, the trends
and values of the cross section largely vary, depending on
the selected model (as shown in later fig. 4). While, in
principle, these predictions can be checked against experi-
mental data below 20 MeV, with the current status of data
discrepancy it is practically impossible to decide which of
the various options is more reliable in simulating this par-
ticular reaction in GEANT4 or in any other Monte Carlo
code for neutron transport. Furthermore, due to the lack
of experimental data, nothing can be said about the va-
lidity of the calculations at higher neutron energies.

Considering the present status of experimental data,
evaluated libraries and model predictions, new accurate
data are highly desirable, covering a wide energy range
extending from the reaction threshold to the GeV region.
Time-of-flight facilities based on the spallation neutron
sources could, in principle, be used to this purpose, with
an experimental setup able to detect the emitted pro-
ton. In practice, however, such a measurement is compli-
cated by the presence of other competing reaction chan-
nels, in particular elastic and inelastic scattering, (n,d)
and (n,α) reactions [2]. A somewhat simpler, yet useful
approach, would be to perform an integral measurement
of the cross section by means of the activation technique
with a pulsed neutron beam of a low repetition rate and
with an energy spectrum extending much above the reac-
tion threshold. Both requirements are met by the n TOF
facility at CERN [16], characterized by a white neutron
spectrum extending up to ∼10 GeV, and a low repetition
rate (≤0.8 Hz). A new technique was applied at n TOF to
extract an energy-integrated cross section. The measure-
ment relied on the detection of the 12B β-decay within
the same neutron bunch in which the reaction takes place.
The main features of the measurement and its results have
been reported in ref. [17]. The main aim of the measure-
ment was to provide an information that could be used
as a benchmark for validating the evaluated cross sections
and the predictions of the model calculations.

In this paper the technique and the analysis proce-
dure are described in greater detail, with the result and
its physical implications being discussed at length. The ex-
perimental result is compared with various models avail-
able in GEANT4, from which the information on the re-
liability of these models is obtained. Furthermore, it will
be shown that the measured observable can be closely re-
produced by calculations based on the TALYS code, with
optimized parameters.

The paper is organized as follows: the experimental
setup is presented in Section 2, while the on-line activa-
tion technique and data analysis are discussed in Section 3.
Section 4 describes the method used to estimate this cross
section from GEANT4 simulations. Section 5 is dedicated
to the comparison between the experimental result and
the predictions of various models and evaluations. A com-
parison between the various experimental results and the
optimized TALYS-1.6 calculations is shown in Section 6.
Finally, Section 7 summarizes the main conclusions of this
work.

2 Experimental setup

The neutron beam at n TOF is produced by the proton-
induced spallation in the massive Pb target. The pulsed
beam of 20 GeV protons is provided by the CERN Proton
Synchrotron, delivering an average of 7 × 1012 protons
per pulse, with 7 ns spread, a repetition rate in multiples
of 1.2 s and a typical average frequency of 0.4 Hz. On
average, 300 neutrons are produced per incident proton.
Spallation neutrons are moderated passing through the
Pb block itself, through 1 cm of demineralized water and
4 cm of borated water surrounding the block. The borated
water significantly suppresses the production of 2.2 MeV
γ-rays from neutron capture on hydrogen, thanks to the
10B(n,α)7Li reaction. The outgoing neutron flux spans 12
orders of magnitude in energy – from thermal (∼10 meV)
up to ∼10 GeV.

An evacuated beam line leads to the Experimental
Area 1, at a distance of approximately 185 m from the
spallation target. The charged particles are removed from
the beam by a 1.5 T sweeping magnet at 145 m from a
spallation target, while the neutron beam itself is shaped
by a set of two collimators at 137 m and 178 m. Outside
the beam line, the flux of particles and radiation from the
spallation target is attenuated by massive concrete walls,
together with a 3.5 m thick iron shielding. A description
of the general features of the n TOF facility may be found
in ref. [16].

The neutron flux at n TOF is measured by multiple
detector systems, in order to reliably cover the whole en-
ergy range from thermal up to 1 GeV. In particular, the
flux between 10 MeV and 1 GeV, which is the energy range
of interest to this work, has been measured by the Parallel
Plate Avalanche Counters (PPAC [18,19]) relying on the
235U(n,f) reaction. The cross section of this reaction – as
the reference for the absolute normalization of the data
– is not considered a standard above 200 MeV. However,
the cross section reference for this reaction has recently
been extended up to 1 GeV [20], and the neutron flux
at these energies has been reevaluated accordingly (Sec-
tion 5.2). Dedicated GEANT4 simulation of a spallation
process were used to extend the flux evaluation up to 10
GeV, with the simulation results normalized to the ex-
perimental data around the transition point at 1 GeV. A
detailed description of the neutron flux measurements at
n TOF may be found in ref. [21].

The natural carbon sample used for the measurement
was 7.13 g in mass, 2 cm in diameter and 1 cm in thick-
ness. A high chemical purity of 99.95% was confirmed by
the chemical analysis performed at Paul Scherrer Insti-
tute, excluding the possibility of contamination by neu-
tron poisons.

For the detection of β-rays from a decay of 12B pro-
duced by the 12C(n,p)12B reaction, two C6D6 (deuter-
ated benzene) liquid scintillation detectors were employed,
which are commonly used at n TOF for neutron capture
measurements. The two detectors are referred to as Bi-
cron and FZK. The former is a modified version of the
commercially available Bicron detector, while the latter
was custom built at Forschungszentrum Karls-ruhe, Ger-
many. These detectors have been specifically optimized so
as to exhibit a very low neutron sensitivity [22]. They were
mounted 8.2 cm upstream of the sample and 6.8 cm from
the beam line axis. The backward position significantly
reduces the background of neutrons and in-beam γ-rays
scattered off the sample. The scintillation liquid volumes
amount to 618 ml and 1027 ml for Bicron and FZK, re-
spectively. Their energy calibration was performed using
standard 137Cs, 88Y and Am/Be γ-ray sources.

A high-performance digital data acquisition system –
based on 8-bit flash analog-to-digital converter units (FADC)
– was used for recording the electronic signals from the
measurements. The sampling rate of 500 MHz in combi-
nation with a 48 MB memory buffer allows uninterrupted
waveforms of 96 ms duration. Further details on the digital
data acquisition used at n TOF may be found in ref. [23].

3 Experimental data analysis

The integral measurement of the cross section of 12C(n,p)12B
reaction has been performed using the activation tech-
nique in combination with the time of flight technique
[17]. During the neutron irradiation of the natC sample,
the high energy section of the neutron beam (above the
reaction threshold of 13.6 MeV) causes the production of
12B nuclei in the sample, which undergo a β−-decay with a
half-life of 20.2 ms and a Q-value of 13.37 MeV. The highly
energetic β-rays – with a mean kinetic energy of 6.35 MeV
– are then detected by two C6D6 detectors. Though the
data have been measured within the time window of 96 ms,
due to the reduced statistics after the background subtrac-
tion at higher decay times, they have been analyzed only
up to 80 ms, which corresponds to four half-lives of 12B.
The intense γ-flash caused by the proton beam hitting the
spallation target was used as a reference point for the time
calibration. Due to the low repetition rate of the n TOF
beam, the decay of 12B is detected within the same neu-
tron bunch in which it is produced, without any possibility
of wrap-around background.

The measurements are affected by several sources of
background. One component is caused by the scattering
of in-beam γ-rays off the sample itself. This component
was measured with a Pb sample and was found to be neg-
ligible. The second component is caused by the neutron
beam crossing the experimental area. It was measured by

recording data with the beam in the experimental area,
but without any sample in place. The third component is
the ambient background, caused by the natural radioactiv-
ity and the neutron activation. It was measured by turning
off the neutron beam. All these components were properly
normalized and subtracted from the measured counts with
the natC sample. These background components have al-
ready been discussed in ref. [24].

The fourth and final component is referred to as the
neutron background, caused by the neutrons scattering off
the sample itself. To precisely identify this component, one
must rely on dedicated simulations, taking into account
the detailed geometric description of the detectors and
experimental surroundings, the full framework of the neu-
tron induced reactions and their complete temporal evolu-
tion. These simulations have been developed in GEANT4
[15] and described in detail in ref. [25]. A major portion
of the neutron background is caused by the detection of
γ-rays – mainly from the neutron captures inside the ex-
perimental area – with only a minor contribution from
β-rays coming from activation of the experimental setup.

A potential problem in the simulations of this back-
ground component is the lack of correlations between the
capture γ-rays from simulated γ-ray cascades, which alters
their energy distribution (relative to the real one), thus af-
fecting an average γ-ray detection efficiency. However, the
use of the Pulse Height Weighting Technique (PHWT) [26]
compensates for the lack of correlations, making the detec-
tion efficiency independent of the actual cascade paths, as
long as the energy is conserved in simulating the capture
γ-rays. In this case simulations become highly reliable,
as demonstrated in ref. [25] by the very good agreement
between the simulated and measured yield of natC in an
energy region where the neutron background dominates.
The details on the PWHT applied at n TOF may be found
in ref. [27].

After subtracting the experimentally determined back-
ground components, the weighted spectrum CW (t) of counts
per neutron bunch – as a function of decay time t – may
be expressed as:

CW (t) = W (E)⊗ Cγ(t) + 〈W 〉 × Cβ(t) (1)

Here W (E) is the weighting function from PHWT, de-
pendent on the energy E deposited in the detectors and
determined for each detector separately. Cγ(t) is the neu-
tron background – mostly composed of capture γ-rays –
while ⊗ symbolically denotes the operation of applying
the weighting function to the neutron background counts.
Cβ(t) are the β-ray counts, pertaining only to the β-rays
from the decay of 12B produced in natC sample. The β-
rays coming from other sources and reactions – including
the 12C(n,p)12B reaction outside the sample (e.g. from the
detector housing made of carbon fiber) – are all part of
the neutron background Cγ(t). In the case of β-rays – al-
ways emitted with unit multiplicity – the application of
the PWHT is equivalent to multiplying the overall spec-
trum by the average weighting factor 〈W 〉, which may be



5

expressed as:

〈W 〉 =
∫ Emax
Emin

Sβ(E)W (E)dE∫ Emax
Emin

Sβ(E)dE
(2)

where Sβ(E) is the deposited energy spectrum of β-rays
from the 12B decay. In order to determine the average
weighting factor 〈W 〉 from eq. (2), the spectrum Sβ(E)
extracted from simulations of the 12B-decay in the natC
sample was used (contrary to γ-ray cascades, there is no
difference between the simulated and measured spectrum
of the energy deposited by β-rays in the C6D6). The aver-
age value 〈W 〉 depends on the lower and upper thresholds
Emin and Emax set during the data analysis. In particular,
the lower threshold needs to be the same as the threshold
used for calculating the weighting functions from PHWT,
i.e. Emin = 200 keV. The upper threshold is set to Emax = 13.37 MeV,
which is the Q-value of the 12B decay. The weighted sim-
ulated neutron background Cγ(t) and the average weight-
ing factor 〈W 〉 – calculated from the simulated spectrum
Sβ(E) – are then used to invert eq. (1) and determine the
background-subtracted, unweighted β-rays spectrum:

Cβ(t) =
CW (t)−W (E)⊗ Cγ(t)

〈W 〉
(3)

The remaining spectrum corresponds to the time distri-
bution of 12B decays:

Cβ(t) =
εβN12B
τ

e−t/τ (4)

with τ = 29.14 ms as the lifetime of 12B and N12B as the
total number of 12B nuclei produced per single neutron
bunch. A final factor to be considered is the total β-ray
detection efficiency εβ . It was extracted from simulations,
as the ratio between the number of detected β-rays within
the energy thresholds used in the analysis (Emin = 200 keV
and Emax = 13.37 MeV) and the total number of

12B nu-
clei generated in the natC sample. For the Bicron detector
it was determined as εβ;Bicron = 4.3%, while for the FZK
as εβ;FZK = 6.8%.

A fit to the exponential form of eq. (4) – with N12B
as the only free parameter – yields the total number of
12B nuclei produced per neutron bunch. For the Bicron

detector the fit yields N
(Bicron)
12B

= 68.03 ± 0.66, while the
data from FZK detector yield N

(FZK)
12B

= 68.74± 0.44.
Figure 2 shows the experimental data for both detec-

tors, before and after subtracting the neutron background.
The top panel (a) shows the spectra uncorrected for the
β-ray detection efficiency εβ , in order to facilitate the vi-
sual separation of exponential fits. The bottom panel (b)
shows the data corrected for the β-ray detection efficiency,
emphasizing the consistency of results from two detectors.
It is evident from fig. 2 that after the background subtrac-
tion the time distribution of the detected counts follows
the expected exponential trend (with the expected life-
time), proving that no additional background components
are present in the results.

Fig. 2. Time distribution of the β-decay of 12B nuclei produced
by the 12C(n,p)12B reaction, measured by two C6D6 detectors
(Bicron and FZK). Total counts show the data after subtract-
ing all experimentally identified background components, with
the neutron background still remaining. After subtracting the
simulated neutron background, the purely exponential spectra
reveal the contribution from a β-decay of 12B. Top panel (a)
shows the detection rate (before correcting for the β-ray detec-
tion efficiency), while bottom panel (b) shows the decay rate
(after correcting for the β-ray detection efficiency).

According to the simulations, the contribution of β-
rays from 12B produced outside the sample by the scat-
tered neutrons is below 1%. Though their contribution has
been removed from the data through the neutron back-
ground subtraction, this source of uncertainty has been
assigned a systematic value of 2%. In addition, 13C con-
tent in natural carbon (with 1.1% natural abundance) also
contributes to the production of 12B and 13B (with decay
properties very similar to those of 12B) through the (n,p),
(n,d) and (n,np) reactions, whose cross sections are highly
uncertain. No attempt was made to decouple their con-
tribution from the measurements, except for the portion
already included in the neutron background. Therefore,
a 3% systematic uncertainty related to the contribution
of 13C has been assigned to the number of produced 12B
nuclei. Finally, a 6% systematic uncertainty was adopted
in order to account for the uncertainty in both the simu-
lated β-ray detection efficiency and the simulated neutron



6

background. Combining the results from both detectors,
the final value is N12B = 68.5± 0.4stat ± 4.8syst.

4 GEANT4 cross sections

It was already shown in Section 3 that GEANT4 simu-
lations play a central role in the experimental data anal-
ysis, in determining the weighting functions required by
the PHWT, of identifying the neutron background and
of determining the β-ray detection efficiency of the two
C6D6 detectors. As will be shown in Section 5, simula-
tions are also indispensable in bringing the number of
produced 12B nuclei into relation with the cross section
of the 12C(n,p)12B reaction and in exerting control over
the same procedure. In that, the (effective) cross sections
for 12C(n,p)12B reaction will play an important role. (By
effective we mean the cross sections which are not di-
rectly sampled from the preexisting data, but arise as
an end-product of the model calculations.) Five different
models from GEANT4 were considered in this work: HP
(High Precision) package, Binary cascade, Bertini cascade,
INCL++/ABLA model (INCL intranuclear cascade cou-
pled to the ABLA deexcitation model) and QGS (Quark-
Gluon-String) model [28]. GEANT4 version 9.6.p01 was
used for all models except for INCL++/ABLA, which
was run in GEANT4 version 10.0 (the only reason being
that the INCL++/ABLA model is not available in ver-
sion 9.6.p01). It should be remarked that the reliability of
the total and elastic scattering cross sections adopted by
GEANT4 is of crucial importance for the quality of sub-
sequent analysis, directly affecting both the self-shielding
and the multiple scattering factor discussed in Section 5.

The cross sections for all reactions of interest were ex-
tracted from GEANT4 by the following procedure. The
natC sample was irradiated in the simulation with neu-
trons following the exact energy dependence of the n TOF
flux. The occurrence Nr(En) of a given reaction r was
counted only if r was the first reaction to take place. In

ent GEANT4 models (see text for details).

parallel, the occurrence Ntot(En) of any reaction in the
sample was also counted. The probability for reaction r
without multiple scattering effects, i.e. the first-chance
yield Yr(En) at neutron energy En may be expressed as:

Yr(En) = (1− e−nσtot(En))
σr(En)

σtot(En)
=
Nr(En)

N0(En)
(5)

The first expression is given in terms of the reaction cross
section σr(En), total cross section σtot(En) and an areal
density n of the sample (in number of atoms per unit
surface, which for the used natC sample is equal to n =
0.114 atoms/barn). The second part of eq. (5) expresses
the probability as the ratio between the number Nr(En)
of times the reaction has occurred and the total number
N0(En) of incident neutrons with energy En. In order to
be able to evaluate the particular cross section σr(En),
the total cross section σtot(En) must first be determined
by inverting eq. (5), considering all neutron interactions
in the sample:

σtot(En) = −
1

n
ln

(

(6)

Ultimately, adopting σtot(En) from simulations (as op-
posed to any particular database) allows for the self-consistent
calculation of σr(En) of interest:

σr(En) =
Nr(En)

Ntot(En)
σtot(En) (7)

Figure 3 compares the total and elastic cross section
extracted from GEANT4 – by eq. (6) and eq. (7), respec-
tively – with those from ENDF/B-VII.1 [11] and ENDF/HE-
VI [29] library. It should be noted that the data in ENDF/B-
VII.1 are available for natC, while in ENDF/HE-VI for
12C. It is evident that the simulations closely reproduce
the tabulated cross sections. Therefore, these results may
be used with a high degree of confidence in identifying
both the self-shielding and the multiple scattering factor
described in the following Section.

The (effective) cross sections for the 12C(n,p)12B reac-
tion have also been calculated on the basis of eq. (7). They

are shown in fig. 4. In particular, the reconstructed cross
section from the HP package builds confidence that the
procedure was correctly performed, since the HP pack-
age adopts the cross sections from the ENDF/B-VII.1
database [11] (see fig. 1). It should be noted that the
cross sections for the 12C(n,p)12B reaction extracted from
GEANT4 are not of particular interest to this work, and
in some cases are clearly unreliable. For example, this
is the case of the one extracted from the quark-gluon-
string models, which clearly cannot be applied below sev-
eral GeV. Nevertheless, all of them extend over the whole
energy range from the reaction threshold up to 10 GeV,
which makes them useful in determination of the multiple
scattering correction discussed in Section 5, and in illus-
trating the robustness of these results against the wildly
varying cross sections.

5 Comparison with models and evaluations

The produced number of 12B nuclei per neutron bunch is
related to the 12C(n,p)12B reaction cross section through
the following expression:

N12B =

∫ 10 GeV
13.6 MeV

1− e−nσtot(En)

σtot(En)
η(En)φ(En)σ(En)dEn

(8)
where the energy range covered by the integral spans from
the reaction threshold at 13.6 MeV up to the highest neu-
tron energy provided by the n TOF beam, i.e. 10 GeV.
The product of the first term (consisting of the self-shielding
factor divided by the total cross section σtot(En); n being
the areal density of sample in number of atoms per unit
surface) with the cross section σ(En) represents the first-
chance reaction yield per incident neutron of energy En,
which does not take into account the multiple scattering
effect. This is accounted for separately, by the multiple
scattering factor η(En) which depends mostly on the elas-
tic cross section. Finally, the sample-incident neutron flux
φ(En) also has to be considered.

5.1 Self-shielding factor

The self-shielding factor, appearing as the numerator from
eq. 8, is central in defining the first-chance yield of the
12C(n,p)12B reaction. It determines the relative portion of
the neutron beam that is attenuated after passing through
the full length of the sample. Equivalently, it may be con-
sidered as a probability for a single neutron to initiate
any possible reaction in the sample – as reflected through
the adoption of the total cross section σtot(En) – and be
removed from the incident neutron beam. On the other
hand, the ratio σ(En)/σtot(En) represents the probability
that among all possible reactions, the particular one with
the cross section σ(En) is to take place. The reliability of
the total cross section adopted in GEANT4 has already
been confirmed in Section 4 (see fig. 3).

5.2 Neutron flux

The neutron flux φ(En) entering the experimental area
was measured up to 1 GeV by means of Parallel Plate
Avalanche Counters [18,19], relying on the 235U(n,f) re-
action. In Refs. [16,21] the n TOF flux was determined on
the basis of the standard cross section from the ENDF/B-
VII.1 evaluation [11] up to 200 MeV. Above this energy,
and up to 1 GeV, the JENDL/HE-2007 database [13] was
used. Recently, a new evaluation has been proposed by
IAEA as a reference cross section [20], now widely con-
sidered to be more reliable. Therefore, it was decided to
re-evaluate the experimental flux above 200 MeV using the
new IAEA cross section reference. Figure 5 compares the
cross sections from JENDL/HE-2007 library, used in the
past, with the newly extended reference from IAEA. The
ratio between them is also displayed in the figure. Previ-
ously evaluated flux simply had to be divided by this ratio
in order to obtain the reevaluated flux. Figure 6 compares
the new flux (incident on the sample) with the one used
in the past. The beam interception factor, required for
identifying the portion of the flux incident on the sam-
ple, was determined as a function of neutron energy from
FLUKA [30] simulations of the neutron transport after the
spallation process, and adjusted to the experimental data
at low energies using the saturated resonance technique
[31] applied to the 4.9 eV neutron capture resonance of
197Au. For clarity, the neutron flux from fig. 6 is shown
in units of lethargy, from which the flux per unit energy
may be obtained as:

Fig. 6. Sample-incident neutron flux between 10 MeV and

detector and normalized to the 235U(n,f) yield calculated from
the associated cross section. The flux above 200 MeV was
reevaluated, based on the recently extended 235U(n,f) reference
cross section from IAEA. In the energy range above 1 GeV the
normalized results from GEANT4 simulations are used. See
the main text for the details.

where Nper bunch is the number of neutrons per neutron
bunch, reaching the experimental area (in case of the eval-
uated flux) or impinging on the sample (in case of the
incident flux).

While the flux was measured up to 1 GeV, for the pur-
pose of this work it is necessary to consider the full energy
distribution of the n TOF beam, since all neutrons above
13.6 MeV contribute to the 12C(n,p)12B reaction and the
production of 12B nuclei. The neutron flux above 1 GeV
can be estimated by means of dedicated simulations of the
spallation process. It was found that the results from re-
cently developed GEANT4 simulations of the spallation
process [32] are in good agreement with the shape of the
flux around 1 GeV. For this reason, the GEANT4 sim-
ulations have been adopted for extending the evaluated
flux up to 10 GeV. In ref. [32] the results from several
different physics lists have been compared, namely from
FTFP BERT HP, FTFP INCLXX HP, QGSP BERT HP,
QGSP BIC HP and QGSP INCLXX HP. The QGSP INCLXX HP
list was found to better reproduce the absolute scale of the
neutron flux, within the overall energy range from thermal
up to 10 GeV. However, the FTFP BERT HP list provides
the best reproduction of the shape of the experimental flux
at high energies. For this reason, the FTFP BERT HP
physics list has been used in this work in order to extend
the evaluated flux beyond 1 GeV. These results have been
normalized so as to match the experimental flux at 1 GeV.
The normalized flux is also shown in fig. 6. It was also mul-
tiplied by the energy dependent beam interception factor,
in order to translate it into the sample incident flux.

5.3 Multiple scattering factor

The multiple scattering factor η(En) was determined from
GEANT4 simulations. We remark that in the simulations
it is of crucial importance to use a realistic flux, i.e. the

one shown in fig. 6, since – after the (in)elastic scatter-
ing – the neutrons of initially higher energy are feeding
the lower energy portions of the spectrum. In the simu-
lations the primary neutron energy E0 was recorded, to-
gether with the final energy En of the neutron giving rise
to the natC(n,p)12B reaction. The multiple scattering fac-
tor – increasing the 12B production at the neutron energy
En – was determined as the ratio between the number
N(En) of

12B nuclei produced by all neutrons of energy
En and the number N(En = E0) of those produced by
neutrons not previously affected by scattering (i.e. those
with the final energy equal to the primary one):

η(En) =
N(En)

N(En = E0)
(10)

In order to investigate the stability and reliability of re-
sults, the simulations were performed using 4 different
inelastic scattering models that extend over the full en-
ergy range of interest – Binary cascade, Bertini cascade,
INCL++/ABLA model and QGS model [28]. Model pre-
dictions are compared in fig. 7. It is evident that the mod-
els yielding substantially different effective cross sections
(see fig. 4) give very consistent multiple scattering correc-
tions up to 11% and 15%, depending in the model used.
This is due to the fact that the multiple scattering factor
is dominantly affected by the elastic scattering. The relia-
bility of the elastic scattering cross section from GEANT4
has already been confirmed in Section 4 (see fig. 3). Con-
sidering the consistency between the multiple scattering
factors from Bertini cascade and Binary cascade, their av-
erage value was adopted – shown in the inset of fig. 7 – that
yields a maximal multiple scattering correction of approx-
imately 11%, peaking around 20 MeV. Additional reason
for using the combination of these two cascade models is
that their combined result will later be shown to best de-
scribe the experimental n TOF data.

5.4 Weighting function

The product of all terms in eq. (8) – apart from the cross
section σ(En) – may be treated as a unique weighting func-
tion w(En) (which is not to be confused with the weighting
function from the PHWT):

w(En) =
1− e−nσtot(En)

σtot(En)
η(En)φ(En) (11)

This function was fitted to the fifth degree polynomial:

)m
(12)

with E0 = 1 MeV and w0 = 1 MeV
−1 mb−1. The fit pa-

rameters have already been reported in ref. [17]. However,
an oversight was made therein, which consists in report-
ing only 3 most significant digits. It was later found that
this was not a sufficient level of precision for a success-
ful reconstruction of the original weighting function and
that a minimum of 4 digits had to be used. In addition to
reevaluating the neutron flux, since reporting the results
in ref. [17], slight improvements were made to the simu-
lation of the multiple scattering factor (the latest results
being shown in fig. 7), leading to a change in the weighting
function. Globally, this change amounts to approximately
1%. The latest weighting function w(En) is shown in fig. 8,
together with the correct fit and the one produced by the
previous, less precise set of parameters from ref. [17]. The
parameters from both the latest polynomial fit and the
one from ref. [17] are now reported to a greater degree of
precision in table 1. The weighting function was assigned
5% systematic uncertainty due to the contribution from
the self-shielding and the multiple scattering factor, and
an additional 6% uncertainty due to the neutron flux, re-
sulting in an 8% total systematic uncertainty.

Having obtained the weighting function, the number of
produced 12B nuclei may be calculated for every GEANT4

model, starting from the known cross sections shown in
fig. 4. Furthermore, running the simulations (using any
of the models) with full geometric setup – i.e. irradiat-
ing the sample and subsequently detecting the β-rays by
two C6D6 detectors – one may perform exactly the same
analysis over the simulated data as was performed over
the experimental data. Therefore, for the same model the
number of produced 12B nuclei may be extracted both by
fitting the exponential decay spectra and by a direct inte-
gration of eq. (8), since the model cross section is known
in advance. This allowed to cross check the calculation of
the weighting function from eq. (11), since any error would
lead to inconsistent results. The combination of models
that best reproduces the experimental result is the com-
bination of Binary cascade below 30 MeV and Bertini cas-
cade above 30 MeV (a detailed list of the neutron physics
models used in this work may be found in ref. [25]; we
advise the reader that QBBC is in this sense the closest of

makes the smooth transition between the Binary cascade
and Bertini cascade around 1 GeV). All other currently
available models underestimate the number of produced
12B nuclei [17], in particular at low energy, while this par-
ticular combination maximizes it, as it can be also noticed
from the cross section in fig. 4. Figure 9 also demonstrates
this, by showing the cumulative number of produced 12B
nuclei:

5.5 Resonance integral

Another value that may be extracted from the experimen-
tal n TOF result is the quantity I12B analogous to the
resonance integral:

I12B =

∫ 10 GeV
13.6 MeV

σ(En)

En
dEn (14)

which is widely used in the nuclear reactor physics. It is
related to the number of produced 12B nuclei in a manner:

N12B ≈ κ× I12B (15)

where κ is the conversion factor. Evidently, the resonance
integral approach simplifies the comparison of the model
predictions of the 12C(n,p)12B cross section with the inte-
grated experimental result. The conversion factor may be
estimated from the weighting function itself, as:

κ ≈
∫ 10 GeV
13.6 MeV

w(En)dEn∫ 10 GeV
13.6 MeV

dEn
En

(16)

This procedure yields the value of κ = 1.565 mb−1. How-
ever, since this is just the first approximation, a different
method was used for finding κ, which relies on simula-
tions and allows to examine the stability and robustness
of the result against the varying cross sections for the
12C(n,p)12B reaction. Starting from the known cross sec-
tions for 4 different GEANT4 models extending through-
out the entire energy range between 13.6 MeV and 10 GeV
(fig. 4), the numberN12B of produced

12B nuclei was calcu-
lated for every model, according to eq. (8). The resonance
integral analogy from eq. (15) was also calculated from ev-
ery model’s cross section, yielding – in ratio with N12B –
the value of κ for each model separately. The combination
of Binary cascade and Bertini cascade was also included in
calculations, due to the integral result being closest to the
experimental value. For all models, the number of pro-
duced 12B nuclei, the resonance integral analogy values
and the conversion factors are listed in table 2. All these
values are assigned a relative uncertainty of 8%, inherited
from the systematic uncertainty in the weighting function

12B nulcei produced, the resonance

integral analogy I12B and the transition factor κ = N12B/I12B

signed a relative uncertainty of 8%, inherited from the system-
atic uncertainty in the weighting function w(En). Final results
from the analysis of the experimental n TOF data are also
listed.

w(En). The result from a combined Binary/Bertini model
was adopted as the final one, due to the closest agree-
ment with the experimental value for the number of pro-
duced 12B nuclei. The spread of results from all considered
models was used to determine the uncertainty in the final
conversion factor: κ = 1.86± 0.1 mb−1. From here follows
the value of I12B = 37 ± 3 mb for the resonance integral
analogy calculated from the experimental n TOF data.

6 TALYS-1.6 calculations

Since the cross sections of the reactions that can produce
12B nuclei in the natC sample – i.e. 12C(n,p), 13C(n,np)
and 13C(n,d) – have their maxima in the energy range
from 20 MeV to 40 MeV, it is not surprising that the 12B
production cannot be accurately described by a quark-
gluon string model, which is expected to work at incident
energies larger than a few GeV. Furthermore, whereas at
energies above ∼100 MeV the preequilibrium stage fol-
lows the one described by intranuclear cascade models,
at energies below ∼100 MeV the reaction proceeds di-
rectly through the preequilibrium models implemented in
Monte Carlo codes, which are by necessity (for perfor-
mance reasons) somewhat simplistic, when compared to
the fully quantum-mechanical calculations. Thus, we con-
sider it worthwhile to carry out cross section calculations
with the fully quantum-mechanical models contained in
the TALYS-1.6 [33,34] code, from 13.6 MeV – the thresh-
old energy of the 12C(n,p) reaction – up to 200 MeV, where
intranuclear cascade models are already considered to be
valid.

Total, elastic and inelastic cross sections have been
computed by means of an optical potential whose qual-
ity is shown in fig. 10, where the total and total inelastic
cross sections are compared with selected experimental
data for both 12C and natC. The theoretical total cross
section is in excellent agreement with measurements on
12C – such as those from Taylor and Wood [35], Bowen et
al. [36], Morales et al. [37] – and also with recent measure-
ments on natC, extended over the whole energy range of
interest, among which are those from Shane et al. [38] and
Abfalterer et al. [39]. In addition, fig. 10 shows that the



11

theoretical inelastic cross section also compares well with
the 12C measurements from Strizhak [40], Degtjarev [41]
and Shchebolev et al. [42], together with the natC mea-
surements in a larger energy range, from Voss and Wilson
[43], Zanelli et al. [44] and Ibaraki et al. [45].

In the energy range of interest, reactions leading to
emission of particles – such as (n,p), (n,α), (n,d) and
(n,2n) – have an important pre-equilibrium component,
which can be described either by a semi-classical exci-
ton model, or by a quantum-mechanical multi-step (com-
pound plus direct) model. In the latter option the impor-
tance of the multi-step direct (MSD) emission increases
quickly with increasing incident energy. The TALYS cal-
culations that closely reproduce the experimentally de-
termined number of produced 12B nuclei have been ob-
tained by means of a MSD model of Fesbach-Kerman-
Koonin type, described in detail in ref. [46]. The energy
dependent cross section from these calculations is shown
in fig. 11. Only one parameter, called M2constant in the
TALYS user manual [34] and used in the normalization of
the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) matrix
elements of the model, has been adjusted so as to repro-
duce the result of the integral measurement at n TOF,
as will soon be explained. The curve from fig. 11 is ob-
tained with M2constant = 0.45. For comparison, fig. 11
shows also the evaluated cross sections in TENDL-2009,
which was based on TALYS calculations with unoptimized
parameter. The main difference between the two calcula-
tions is above 20 MeV. Below 20 MeV the old and the
new TALYS calculations agree between each other and –
as shown in fig. 1 – with the experimental data near the
threshold energy from Kreger and Kern [5], Ablesimov at
al. [4] and Bobyr et al. [7]. This also goes in the direction
of confirming the conclusion by Pillon et al. [3], that their
cross section may be underestimated due to the difficul-

ties in identifying all possible excited states of the residual
nucleus. On the contrary, the peak predicted by the cal-
culations is much higher than the data from Rimmer and
Fisher [6]. The old datum at 90 MeV from Kellogg [8], af-
fected by a poor energy resolution, is somewhat underes-
timated by the computed values. A predicted high-energy
tail lower than the few available data appears also in com-
peting reactions – particularly in the (n,2n) cross section
– and might be due to an oversimplification of the MSD
model contained in TALYS-1.6, namely the use of macro-
scopic form factors in DWBA calculations. Resorting to
microscopic form factors based on the shell model would
go in the right direction and would improve the high en-
ergy behavior. As an alternative, one could try to adjust
in an ad hoc manner some important parameter, such as
the pairing energy. This has not been done in the present
work, aiming at reproducing the result of the integral mea-
surement at n TOF, rather than the high energy tail of
the differential cross section, which can only play a very
modest role in this respect.

In case of 12C as a target, the contribution comes from
the (n,p) reaction, while in case of 13C from (n,np) and
(n,d) reactions. The results we have obtained are listed in
table 3. The values for a natC target are obtained by a
weighted average based on the natural abundances of the
two isotopes – 98.9% for 12C and 1.1% for 13C.

A final consideration regards the contribution to the
two integrals from neutrons in the energy range from 200 MeV
to 10 GeV. This has been calculated with version 5.2 of the
INCL++ code [47], where the inclusion of multiple pion
production as described in ref. [48] makes it possible to ex-
tend the calculations up to incident nucleon energies of the
order of 12 GeV. By default, light nuclei like carbon iso-
topes undergo the decay known as Fermi break-up. In this
high energy range the evaluation of all the cross sections
of interest is expected to be quite reliable. The corrections
obtained for the natC target are also listed in table 3. The
final figures are N12B = 69.14, compared to the experi-
mental value 68.5± 0.4stat± 4.8syst, and I12B = 36.61 mb,
in comparison with the value of 37±3 mb, as derived from
the experiment.

7 Conclusions

The integral measurement of the 12C(n,p)12B reaction was
performed at the n TOF facility at CERN, from the reac-
tion threshold at 13.6 MeV, up to 10 GeV. The measure-
ment was performed using two C6D6 detectors, commonly
used at n TOF for neutron capture measurements. The
high energy of β-rays coming from the decay of 12B nu-
clei produced by neutron activation of 12C, allows them to
reach the scintillator and deposit inside it a large amount
of energy. The high instantaneous neutron flux and the
low repetition rate of the n TOF beam make the n TOF
facility well suited for such activation measurements, es-
pecially when the decaying nuclides are characterized by a
half-life below ∼100 ms. The measurements at n TOF are
affected by several sources of background. Most of them
– the background of scattered in-beam γ-rays, the one
related to the neutron beam crossing the experimental
area and the ambient background – have been measured
and subtracted. The remaining background component –
caused by the neutrons scattering off the sample itself –
has been studied by means of recently developed dedicated
simulations.

After subtracting all background components from the
natC measurements, the exponential spectra perfectly re-
produce the expected lifetime of 12B. After correction for
the efficiency, a fit of the time spectra to the exponen-
tial form yields the number N12B of

12B nuclei produced
per neutron bunch. The results from the two C6D6 detec-
tors were found to be highly consistent, yielding the final
result of N12B = 68.5 ± 0.4stat ± 4.8syst. The n TOF re-
sult has been compared with evaluated cross sections and
model calculations, in particular those used in GEANT4.
In all cases cross sections were folded with the n TOF
neutron flux and corrected for self-shielding and multiple

scattering effects. The neutron flux up to 1 GeV was mea-
sured in the past by the Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters
(PPAC), relying on the 235U(n,f) reaction, whose cross
section is considered a standard up to 200 MeV. Above
200 MeV the neutron flux has been reevaluated due to
the recent extension of the cross section reference for this
reaction. The reevaluation of the experimental data has
also affected the selection of the simulated results used to
extend the evaluation of the neutron flux up to 10 GeV.

For most evaluations the cross section of the 12C(n,p)12B
reaction is underestimated, as they are based on the data
of Rimmer et al. Among models in GEANT4, good agree-
ment is observed only with a combined Bertini-Binary cas-
cade model. A comparison was also performed with the-
oretical cross sections obtained by the TALYS-1.6 code,
whose parameters were optimized to reproduce the inte-
gral n TOF value. Since the theoretical model predicts the
integral value of the cross section, as well as its full en-
ergy dependence, the comparison with the n TOF result
can be used to extract the energy dependent cross section
up to 10 GeV.

The models and evaluations that yield the integral
value closest to the one from n TOF indicate that the cross
section for the 12C(n,p)12B reaction reaches its maximum
around 20 MeV. The few experimental data that cover
this energy range also seem to confirm this observation.
However, many of the evaluations based on these data
underestimate the integral value of the cross section, rel-
ative to the one from n TOF. Therefore, a renewed mea-
surement of the energy dependence of this cross section is
strongly encouraged by the latest n TOF result, in partic-
ular within the energy range from the reaction threshold
up to several tens of MeV.

Energy Communitys (Euratom) Seventh Framework Pro-
gramme FP7/2007-2011 under the Project CHANDA (Grant
No. 605203); by the Narodowe Centrum Nauki (NCN)
grant UMO-2012/04/M/ST2/00700; and by the Croatian
Science Foundation under Project No. 1680. We are grate-
ful to Drs. Arjan J. Koning and Davide Mancusi for valu-
able comments on the use of TALYS-1.6 and INCL++v5.2,
respectively. GEANT4 simulations have been run at the
