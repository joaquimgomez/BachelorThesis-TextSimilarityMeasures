An ambitious program to measure decay properties, primarily β-delayed
neutron emission probabilities and half-lives, for a significant number of
nuclei near or on the path of the rapid neutron capture process, has been
launched at the RIKEN Nishina Center. We give here an overview of the
status of the project.

DOI:10.5506/APhysPolB.49.417

1. Introduction

Most of the nuclei formed during the initial stages of the rapid (r) neu-
tron capture process will decay by β-delayed neutron (βn) emission. For
these nuclei, the separation energy of one or more neutrons in the daughter
nucleus Sxn is lower than the energy available for the decay Qβ , making the
process energetically possible. The half-life T1/2 of the decay determines the
initial abundances of the nuclei along the reaction path. The decay of these
nuclei towards stability is altered by the neutron emission process, since each
neutron emitted reduces the final mass number A by one unit. In addition,
the injection of fresh neutrons to the system, at the moment that the neu-
tron density is rapidly decreasing, can have a significant effect on the neutron
capture rate, increasing A by one unit per (n, γ) reaction [1, 2]. Thus, the
probability of x-neutron emission per decay Pxn shapes the final abundance
distributions. All of this underlines the importance of accurate decay data
for βn emitters in r process abundance calculations. However, obtaining
such data in the past has been hampered by the difficulty of accessing the
relevant isotopes, far from the valley of β stability. In fact, reaction network
calculations of the r process rely heavily on theoretical estimates for T1/2
and Pxn as well as for other relevant quantities such as the capture cross
sections σnγ and masses.

From the astrophysics point of view, in spite of the advances since the
general idea of the r process was laid out [3], there are still considerable un-
certainties. It is not clear what are the exact conditions of the astrophysical
environment such as temperature, neutron density, entropy, rotation speed
and magnetic fields, that lead to a successful r process. Where such events
actually take place is also unknown. Two sites have been actively inves-
tigated: (1) core-collapse supernova events (CCSN) occurring at the ends
of the lives of massive stars, and (2) the kilonova explosion ignited by the
merging of two neutron stars or a black hole and a neutron star (NSM). The
relative contributions of the two to the evolution of the Universe and the
observed abundances of elements in stars is also unclear. The very recent
results of combined observations of gravitational wave, γ ray, X ray, UV,
optical, infrared and radio emission from a two-neutron star merger confirm
in a spectacular way that NSM are a major source of r process elements [4]

and opens a new field for precision r process studies. In this situation, it
is fair to claim that a reduction in the uncertainty of the nuclear physics
input, in particular for values of Pxn and T1/2, is a key to the progress of
investigations in this area.

With that idea in mind the Beta-delayed neutrons at RIKEN (BRIKEN)
Collaboration [5] was established with the aim of exploiting the currently
unsurpassed radioactive beam intensities by in-fight production available at
the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) [6] and the powerful selec-
tion and identification capabilities of the in-flight separator BigRIPS, and
ZeroDegree spectrometer [7], by supplementing them with state-of-the-art
instrumentation that would allow us to study decay properties of very exotic
βn emitters.

2. Experimental setup

To determine neutron emission probabilities, we use a combination of
neutron counting and β counting, a widely used method. The BRIKEN
neutron counter is of the neutron moderation type, which uses a hydroge-
nous material, in our case high density polyethylene (HDPE), to bring down
the neutron energy from MeVs to meVs, and a detector that is very effi-
cient for detecting thermal neutrons, in our case a 3He filled proportional
counter. The energy deposited by the exothermic reaction 3He(n, p)3H
(Q = 0.76 MeV) induces a signal well-separated from the noise and with
a relatively small background, providing a high degree of selectivity. With
this detection scheme, one can also reach high detection efficiencies by assem-
bling a large number of tubes, a key feature for the study of weakly produced
isotopes. The fraction of initial neutrons effectively moderated and captured
depends on their initial energy and the geometry of the detector, resulting in
an energy dependence of the neutron detection efficiency εn. This is an un-
desirable effect since the energy distribution is a priori unknown for most of
the nuclei of interest. Thus, the arrangement of tubes to achieve maximum
detection efficiency and minimum energy dependence is a complex problem
that is best tackled using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

The optimization of the BRIKEN neutron counter was carried out us-
ing a parametric approach [8] taking into account the tubes available to the
collaboration, coming from ORNL, UPC-Barcelona, GSI-Darmstadt, JINR
and RIKEN, with varying gas volumes and pressures. One of the designs
investigated includes γ-ray detectors, more specifically two CLOVER-type
HPGe detectors. This option reduces the maximum achievable efficiency
and flatness of the efficiency curve, but was the one chosen because of the
enhanced research prospects provided by the significant gain in peak-to-
background ratio of β-neutron gated γ-ray spectroscopy [9]. The CLOVER
detectors are inserted perpendicular to the beam from opposite sides of the



420 J.L. Tain et al.

PE moderator and achieve a γ-ray detection efficiency of about 3.5% for
1 MeV γ rays. The configuration finally installed includes 140 3He tubes
(see Fig. 1, left panel), becoming the largest detector of its kind ever built
for βn measurements, with a rather constant efficiency of around 68% up
to 1 MeV, dropping to 59% at 3 MeV (see Fig. 1, right panel), according
to MC simulations. Given the large energy window for βn emission in ex-
otic neutron-rich nuclei, this variation can represent a source of systematic
uncertainty in Pxn values. However, we can use the number of neutrons de-
tected as a function of distance to the source, which carries information on
the neutron energy as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, to deduce de facto
the average detection efficiency for each decaying nucleus [10]. The simu-
lated neutron detection efficiency was verified with a strong uncalibrated
252Cf source using the neutron multiplicity counting method [11]. Due to
the close packing of 3He tubes, the mean time for moderation and cap-
ture in 3He is rather short, τ ∼ 30 µs. Thus, setting a time window for
neutron detection of ∆tn = 200 µs ensures close to 100% detection effi-
ciency. The signal from each tube, each HPGe crystal and other ancillary
detectors is digitized when it goes above a noise discrimination threshold
(self-triggering), processed with trapezoidal filters and stored in list-mode
files as time-amplitude pairs, using the Gasific digital data acquisition sys-
tem [12]. The resulting acquisition dead time is typically very small (less
than 1%).

The β counter also acts as the ion implantation detector, namely the Ad-
vanced Implantation Detector Array (AIDA) [13]. A total of six Si DSSDs
spaced by 10 mm were installed in the AIDA nose, which is inserted longitu-
dinally in the PE moderator. The stack of DSSDs is centered with respect
to the tubes and located between the two CLOVER detectors. Each DSSD
has 1 mm thickness and a size of 72 mm × 72 mm with 128 horizontal and
vertical strips on each side. Each strip is read out independently and pro-
cessed with both high-gain and low-gain electronic branches. This allows
one to measure precisely the low energy deposited by β signals shortly after
an implantation event which deposits a very high energy. A threshold is ap-
plied to each electronic channel to discriminate against the noise and reduce
data throughput. The threshold in the β branch ranges typically between
100 and 200 keV. The total data readout acquisition system stores the time
and signal amplitude of all strips that fired.

The identification of each implanted ion is provided by the BigRIPS
spectrometer. The ion velocity is measured by the time-of-flight between
thin plastic scintillators located conveniently along the particle trajectory.
The particle trajectory is reconstructed from the transverse position pro-
vided by two-dimensional parallel plate avalanche counters and combined
with the magnetic field in the dipole magnets to obtain the particle’s mag-
netic rigidity. Combining velocity and magnetic rigidity, one obtains the
mass-over-charge ratio A/Q. The energy lost by the ion in dedicated ioniza-
tion chambers provides its atomic charge Z. After identification of possible
charge states (ions which are not fully stripped of electrons), the two quan-
tities together provide a unique identification of the ion in an event-by-event
basis.

The data from the three independent DACQ systems, BigRIPS, AIDA
and BRIKEN, have to be merged for the data analysis. The merging is done
on the basis of the respective time stamps which are synchronized thanks
to the use of a common clock signal distributed to all three systems. The
synchronization between them is constantly monitored during the measure-
ment.

3. Experimental programme

Four measurement proposals have been approved until now. Altogether,
they span a very wide range of very neutron-rich isotopes from Co to Eu
(see Fig. 2). They cover the region of the 1st r process peak, Z = 27–35
and A = 75–95 [14], the region of neutron-rich deformed nuclei, Z = 35–48
and A = 95–130 [15], the region of the 2nd r process peak, Z = 45–55 and
A = 120–150 [16], and the region of deformed nuclei leading to the rare-
earth abundance peak (REP), Z = 55–63 and A = 150–167 [17]. The goal
is to measure in total 135 new P1n values, 85 new P2n values and 40 new
T1/2 values for nuclei relevant to r process calculations.

the chart covered by the four accepted BRIKEN proposals is roughly indicated by

The physics reach of the expected results extends beyond the astrophys-
ical interest. Half-lives and Pxn values give information on the β-strength
distribution Sβ(Ex) which carries information on the nuclear structure. T1/2
is mainly sensitive to the low excitation energy part of Sβ(Ex), while Pxn
values measure the fraction of Sβ(Ex) above Sxn. The combined information
provides constraints on the theoretical models calculating Sβ(Ex), thus im-
proving their predictive power for nuclei as yet unmeasured. Alternatively,
these two quantities together can provide information about the nuclear shell
structure [19] or about the deformation of the nucleus [20, 21]. Additional
nuclear structure information can come from the precise location of excited
states and their βn feeding intensity obtained with the CLOVER γ-ray de-
tectors. The background reduction provided by neutron gating [22, 23] will
push the limit of such studies to more exotic nuclei.

The process of βn emission itself is not fully understood. For example,
the competition between γ and neutron emission from neutron unbound
states populated in β-decay has just started to be studied in a more sys-
tematic way [24–28]. The competition between β-delayed one-neutron and
multiple-neutron emission channels has not been properly addressed [29],
the main reason being the scarcity of known βxn emitters. Currently, only
twenty three β2n, four β3n and one β4n emitters have been measured. As
mentioned above, we will substantially increase the database for β2n emit-
ters providing the ground for an extensive systematic study. It is also un-

clear whether the multiple emission process occurs sequentially, or through
the emission of a loosely bound neutron cluster, or as direct breakup into
the continuum [30]. Some insight into this problem may be obtained by
the measurement of angle-energy correlations between emitted neutrons, as
has been done in the case of β-delayed proton emission [31]. Because of
the neutron moderation process, the BRIKEN neutron counter can provide
such information only with limitations. However, given its large neutron
detection efficiency, it is worth to explore this possibility.

4. First measurements

The commissioning of the experimental setup took place in November
2016 parasitic to an experiment of M. Takechi and collaborators. The pri-
mary beam was 238U at an energy of 345 MeV/u. The BigRIPS setting for
the secondary radioactive beam was centered on 76Ni. In about 10 hours
of measurement, sufficient statistics were accumulated for 15 isotopes of Ni,
Cu, Zn and Ga which are β-delayed one-neutron emitters. This includes 475
78Ni events, enough to determine its Pn value by direct neutron counting for
the first time.

We observed a very large beam induced background in the neutron de-
tector which reached a value of 250 cps (counts per second), to be com-
pared with 0.4 cps from ambient background. This limits the sensitivity
of our setup to β-delayed neutrons. A similar issue was found during the
BELEN-30 experiment at the GSI Fragment Separator in 2011 [32]. There
the problem was solved, for isotopes with low statistics and sufficient long
half-life, using in the analysis only the decay data coming between beam
spills. This is not possible at BigRIPS given the continuum time structure
of the RIBF beams. However, we found that by vetoing neutrons coming
within ∆tn (200 µs) of the passage of ions through the plastic scintillator
at the end of the spectrometer, we effectively reduced the neutron detector
background. Reduction factors of about 4 for the one-neutron background
and about 15 for the two-neutron background were achieved. This proce-
dure introduces a few percent beam-rate-dependent reduction on neutron
statistics in the analysis.

In order to obtain the P1n value we build for each identified implant
the histogram of β-implant time differences, tβ − timplant, both without any
condition and with the condition that only one neutron comes within ∆tn
after the β (see Fig. 3). These spectra are corrected for uncorrelated and
correlated background and fitted with a function describing the evolution of
the decay activity of parent and descendant nuclei for all decay chains. The
fit function has the form of

bution. The number of decaying nuclei at each moment Nk(t) is obtained
from appropriate solutions of the Bateman equations [33] which take the

depending on the branch. All half-lives and descendant P1n values are kept
fixed, thus a simultaneous fit of both histograms provides directly the neu-
tron emission probability of the parent. The systematic uncertainty due to
uncertainties on the T1/2 and Pn values used is derived from the distribution
of results obtained by repeated fitting after varying the parameters within
uncertainties.

In the preliminary analysis, we assume that the neutron efficiency ε̄n is
isotope-independent. The common assumption that the efficiency ε̄β is also
independent of the decay requires the use of very low β thresholds [12]. This
is a challenging task in a complex detector such as AIDA. The effect was
verified by comparing the P1n values obtained for different ways of recon-
structing a β event with different nominal thresholds and sorting conditions.
Relative variations of up to 7% were observed when the β efficiency increases



The BRIKEN Project: Extensive Measurements of β-delayed Neutron . . . 425

from about 25% to about 40%. The preliminary results so far obtained show
a good agreement with previous literature values [34] for 76Cu, 77Cu, 79Zn,
80Zn and 82Ga. Significant differences are observed for 78Cu, 81Zn and 82Zn,
and more precise values are obtained for 79Cu and 83Ga. We obtain for the
first time Pn values for 76Ni, 77Ni, 78Ni, and 80Cu. Altogether, these results
demonstrate the excellent performance of the setup.

In May 2017, the first BRIKEN experiment took place. The measure-
ments in the region around 78Ni and for the formation of the 2nd r pro-
cess peak at A = 130–140 were completed. A partial measurement for the
heaviest elements relevant to the formation of the rare-earth peak was also
performed. All three experiments used a 238U beam at 345 MeV/u on a Be
target, and the primary beam intensity reached 50 pnA.

As an example of the success of the experiment, we highlight some re-
sults from the 78Ni region measurement. Figure 4 displays the combined
identification plot of implanted ions for the two BigRIPS settings used. The
figure indicates the current limits of measured T1/2 and Pn values. In about
95 hours of measurement 6.5 million ions of 86Ge were implanted, a total
of 7500 implants were identified as 78Ni ions, and more than 800 ions were
collected for the very exotic 92As.

A number of potential β2n emitters were measured for the first time.
In order to obtain the P2n value, another spectrum is added to the simul-
taneous fit. This histogram stores β-implant time differences when two,
and only two, neutrons come within ∆tn after the beta. The histogram
is corrected for correlated and uncorrelated backgrounds. In addition, the

ing when one of the neutrons escapes detection, is also taken into account.

5. Conclusions and outlook

The BRIKEN setup has been commissioned showing an excellent per-
formance and the first experiments have been performed successfully. The
next BRIKEN runs will take place in October–November 2017. During this
period, the experiment to study the region of neutron-rich deformed nuclei
with A = 95–130 will be performed. A second experiment will mainly focus
on neutron-gated γ-ray spectroscopy of 82Cu decay to study neutron single-
particle levels in the 78Ni region. The measurements to study the formation
of the rare-earth peak will be completed in 2018.

Additional experiments are planned in the near future. Three new pro-
posals have been presented. One aims to study the light mass neutron-
rich region Z = 9–16, A = 29–48 that includes a number of potential β3n
and β4n emitters. The second one concentrates on the medium-light nuclei
Z = 17–25, A = 47–67 around the shell gaps at N = 34 and N = 40. The
third challenging proposal aims at the heavy region Z = 72–83, A = 190–224
of importance for the formation of the 3rd r process peak, whose feasibility
at BigRIPS will be investigated.
