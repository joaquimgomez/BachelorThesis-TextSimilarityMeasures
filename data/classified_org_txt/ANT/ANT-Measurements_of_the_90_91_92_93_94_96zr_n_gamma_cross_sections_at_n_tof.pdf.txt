The n_TOF Collaboration 
 
Neutron capture cross sections for zirconium isotopes have important implications in the field of nuclear 

astrophysics as well as in the nuclear technology. In particular they play a key role for the determination of the neutron 
density in the He burning zone of the Red Giant stars. Zirconium is also largely used as structural materials of 
traditional and advanced nuclear reactors.  Neutron capture cross sections of the 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr have been measured at 
the spallation neutron facility n_TOF at CERN. The innovative features of the neutron beam, in particular its high 
instantaneous flux, the high energy resolution and low background, together with improvements of the neutron 
sensitivity of the capture detectors make this facility unique for neutron-induced reaction cross section measurements 
with much improved accuracy.  

 
1. Introduction 

 
The measure of the neutron capture cross section of 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr has relevance in nuclear astrophysics, since the 

Zr belongs to the first s-process peak in the solar abundances distribution around the neutron magic number N = 50. 
Accurate s-process analyses have recently attracted great interest over the last decade, thanks to the progresses in 
astronomical observations and in stellar interpretative models. The understanding of the s-process has advanced from a 
phenomenological description of the abundance distribution in the solar system towards a comprehensive picture, which 
includes the overall aspects of stellar and galactic evolution [1]. However the success of the stellar s-process models 
could only be achieved by significant improvements in the neutron capture cross section data, which reached 
uncertainties of only a few %. This accuracy turned out to be a prerequisite for this application of nuclear data in 
nuclear astrophysics. At present many cross section data are still missing, particularly in the mass region A≤100 as well 
as for neutron magic nuclei where cross sections are small and dominated by isolated resonances [2]. The 90,91,92,93,94Zr 
are characterized by a low neutron capture cross section and are predominately of s-process origin. The 96Zr is 
considered to be an r-only isotope with a small s-process admixture [1]. Branching in the reaction path, which occur at 
unstable isotopes, where neutron capture competes with β-decay, are a unique tool for constraining the physical 
conditions in the He burning zones near the stellar core. An important branching occurs at 95Zr.

The (n, γ) cross section of stable Zr isotopes are also of interest for technological reasons, since zirconium is widely 
present in structural materials of nuclear reactors. Moreover, the unstable isotope 93Zr is one of the major long-lived 
fission products.  

Existing (n, γ) cross sections of Zr isotopes in the relevant energy range from 0.1 to 500 keV exhibit uncertainties 
larger than 10 % and discrepancies up to a factor 2 between different measurements have been observed. The necessary 
improvement of these data was achieved using the unique features of the n_TOF facility, which combines excellent 
resolution, high instantaneous neutron flux and low background [3].  

 
2. Experimental set-up 

 
The measurements were performed with the n_TOF pulsed neutron beam. The neutrons are generated by spallation 

reactions induced by a pulsed beam of 20 GeV protons on a massive Pb target. Neutrons are slowed down in the lead 
and moderated in the surrounding 5 cm thick layer of cooling water. An evacuated neutron flight path with collimators 
at 135 and 175 m leads to the measuring station at a distance of 185 m from the spallation target. Background due to the 
fast charged particles is suppressed by a sweeping magnet, heavy concrete walls and a 3.5 m thick iron shielding.  

The experimental set-up consists of two C6D6 detectors with minimized neutron sensitivity [4], placed perpendicular 
to the neutron beam at a distance of about 3 cm from the beam axis. The background due to in beam γ-rays was reduced 
by placing the detectors 9.2 cm upstream of the sample position. The light output of the detectors was calibrated by 
means of 137Cs, 60Co and Pu/C γ-ray sources.  

The calibrated neutron time of flight was used to determine the neutron energy. 
The detectors signals were recorded with fast flash ADC using the standard n_TOF data acquisition system [5].  
Enriched Zr samples were prepared from oxide powder, pressed to pellets 22 mm in diameter, encapsulated in a thin 

aluminum can. Admixtures of Hf, Sn, Na, Mg, Al were also present in the samples. Even thought the presence of 
contaminants is very low, their influence can not be neglected. C, Au, Pb samples were used for flux and background 
measurements. The relevant sample characteristics are given in the Table.

3. Data analysis 
 

The quantity to be determined in a neutron capture experiment is the yield, which is defined as the fraction of 
incident neutrons undergoing (n, γ) reactions in the sample. The capture yield is directly linked to the capture and the 
total cross sections. Since the capture detectors have low efficiency and cover a restricted solid angle, the overall 
efficiency for the detection of capture events was ≈ 20 %. The absolute normalization of the capture yields has then 
been made referring to the well-known 4.9 eV saturated resonance of 197Au.  

 
The efficiency correction via the Pulse 

Height Weighting Technique (PHWT) [6] is 
based on the application of a pulse height 
dependent weight for each single registered γ-
ray to ensure that the detection efficiency is 
independent on the multiplicity distribution of 
the capture cascade. The respective weighting 
functions are very sensitive to the experimental 
set-up including the investigated sample. These 
functions were derived by detailed Monte Carlo 
simulations.  

Ambient and sample related backgrounds 
were subtracted by means of the spectra 
measured with an empty Al can and with the Pb 
sample.  
Fig. 1 shows the capture yield for the 91Zr 
compared to the total background.

Sn contamination in the sample.

Observed resonances were analyzed in the Reich-Moore approximation with the R-matrix code SAMMY [7]. For 
each resonance three parameters have been extracted: the resonance energy ER, the capture width Γγ and the neutron 
width Γn. The correction for Doppler broadening of resonance widths due to the thermal motion, for the energy 
resolution of the neutron beam, for isotopic and chemical sample impurities, and for self-shielding and neutron multiple 
scattering, are taken into account inside the code. The effect of potential scattering was theoretically calculated [8]. 

The neutron capture kernels obtained from the resonance parameters measured at n_TOF were compared to other 
experimental data. Previous experiments are in general old (mid-1970) and provide scarce information on resonance 
parameters. The capture kernels measured at n_TOF are in general (but the 94Zr) 10 - 20 % smaller than previous reported 
[8, 9]. This can be explained in terms of the systematic uncertainties that are significantly reduced by the improved n_TOF 
set-up. As an example one has to note that the use of fast flash ADCs provides an efficient way for n/γ discrimination. 
Other developments in favor of the present data are related to the very low neutron sensitivity of the n_TOF set-up and of 
the use of the well tested R-matrix code [7]. In this context, it should be noted that the low neutron induced background, 
obtained with the optimized experimental set-up and with the extremely small duty factor of the n_TOF facility, represents 
a strong improvements in measurements of small capture cross sections as in the case of Zr isotopes.  

 
4. Results 

 
Zirconium plays an important role in the determination 

of the s-process abundances of heavy elements. The s-
process occurs predominantly in thermally pulsing low 
mass Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, where 
neutrons are produced by a (γ, n) reactions on 13C and 
22Ne. Methods of converting experimental cross section 
data in stellar properties were suggested by Macklyn and 
Gibbons [10]. Among them, the definition of the 
Maxwellian averaged capture cross section (MACS) is 
strictly connected to the stellar neutron capture rate [2]. 
The MACS can then give information on the 
nucleosynthesis probability along the s-path. The 
calculation of MACS at typical s-process temperatures has 
to be carried out by folding the capture cross section with 
the thermalized stellar spectra over a sufficiently wide 
neutron energy range, starting at about 100 eV and 
extending to about 500 keV at the highest temperatures 
reached during carbon shell burning in massive stars.  

The MACS calculated with the present experimental 
data are in general lower than that listed in evaluated 
libraries [11]; this fact is a direct consequence of the 
weaker capture kernel values obtained in the present 
measurements. Fig. 2 illustrates the 90Zr example, where 
the MACS of these experiments are up to 10% lower than 
those obtained with previous available data.  

 
5. Conclusions 

 
The neutron capture cross sections of 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr have been measured at the CERN n_TOF facility. The 

optimized experimental conditions at n_TOF allowed to significantly improve the accuracy in the results, allowing for 
better face the s-process nucleosynthesis studies. The capture kernels obtained in this work are for all samples but the 
94Zr weaker than what reported in previous experiments. Consequently the MACS calculated with the present 
experimental data are in general lower than the values extracted by evaluation studies. This result can be explained in 
terms of the top performances of the facility, experimental set-up data acquisition and more accurate data analysis tools 
that allow a reduction of systematic uncertainties.
