Thin 33S samples for the study of the 33S(n,ùõº)30Si cross-section at the n_TOF facility at CERN were made by
thermal evaporation of 33S powder onto a dedicated substrate made of kapton covered with thin layers of copper,
chromium and titanium. This method has provided for the first time bare sulfur samples a few centimeters in
diameter. The samples have shown an excellent adherence with no mass loss after few years and no sublimation
in vacuum at room temperature. The determination of the mass thickness of 33S has been performed by means of
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. The samples have been successfully tested under neutron irradiation.

1. Introduction

The preparation of thin sulfur samples is a difficult task because
sulfur sublimates in vacuum at room temperature, adheres poorly or
only for a short time to most solid backings and it is very volatile [1‚Äì
4]. These difficulties are enhanced by the particularities required for
an accurate study of the 33S(n,ùõº)30Si cross-section as a function of
the neutron energy. The only two experiments with the goal of the
measurement of the 33S(n,ùõº)30Si cross-section in a wide energy range
reported different problems with the samples [5,6]. Thin deposits are
needed for a low energy loss and good detection efficiency of the
emitted alpha particles, but at the same time, the value of the cross-
section in some energy ranges is expected to be low, therefore an
adequate number of atoms per cm2 is required. On the other side, the
cross-section is expected to be high in the resonance region but for
resolving the resonances a pulsed neutron beam is mandatory entailing
a decrease of the neutron flux. With all of this in mind and with the
knowledge of the outstanding characteristics of the Experimental Area
1 (EAR1) of the n_TOF-CERN facility in terms of energy resolution and
instantaneous flux, it is also possible to take advantage of a higher
number of neutrons making use of the beam of 8 cm diameter during
the so-called fission campaign when the large collimator is installed [7].
This possibility implies an additional double challenge, the production
of large samples and their accurate characterization with an adequate
study of the homogeneity.

In spite of these difficulties, some problems have been solved by
different authors depending on the requirements of their experiments.
Watson developed a technique for making sulfur targets for the purpose
of proton capture studies [1]. The target was a thin layer of Ag2S but
only 10‚àí8 at/b were present, which is an order of magnitude lower than
the requirement for neutron-capture studies as those foreseen at n_TOF.
The same can be concluded for ion-implanted S targets performed by

different authors, as Schatz et al. [4]. That kind of targets has the
additional drawback of the small dimensions (2 cm diameter) that in
the case of the EAR1 at n_TOF would mean an important waste of
neutrons making impossible this measurement in a reasonable time.
Hedemann [2] showed a relatively good adherence of sulfur to form-
var foils and made a multi-sandwich target of formvar-carbon-sulfur.
However, migration and loss of sulfur was reported. Geerts et al. [3],
based on Hedemann‚Äôs work, produced a 33S sample using a sandwich
of formvar foils. No sulfur losses or migration was reported during
an irradiation of the sample with thermal neutrons [3]. As formvar
powder is usually diluted in a solution which is classified as dangerous
(carcinogenic and toxic) many formvar solutions should be disposed as
hazardous waste. Therefore, we decided to avoid using formvar in our
work.

All previous methods were based on the evaporation of sulfur
in different conditions or ion implantation. There have been more
attempts to prepare sulfur samples by deposition from a well-defined
solution [4]. However, this method provided samples with significant
inhomogeneities requiring large self-absorption corrections.

Regarding uncertainties, the characterization of the samples was
carried out by different techniques. In general around ¬±20% uncer-
tainty for the number of atoms were obtained, but no information
was provided for the homogeneity. In Ref. [4] an accuracy better than
¬±20% was obtained, but the adherence before and after the experiment
was not investigated and long tails in the alpha spectrum towards
lower energies were present due to significant inhomogeneities, which
entailed a degradation in separating the alpha-induced signals from the
background [4].

In this work, we present a method for making large 33S samples,
stable in vacuum and at atmospheric pressure, with no observable mass
loss over a period of few years and without cover layer. An accurate
determination of the number of atoms per cm2 is also presented. The
method is based on the evaporation in vacuum of 33S powder onto
a dedicated substrate and the characterization is based on Rutherford
backscattering spectrometry (RBS).

2. Preparation and characterization of 33S samples

As already pointed out, the production of 33S samples for neutron-
induced cross-section measurements is not straightforward. In addi-
tion to the mentioned factors, it was necessary to avoid the use of
materials with elements that under neutron irradiation could produce
charged-particles leading to undesirable signals in the spectra. Also, the
substrate must be made of a conductive material in order to use the
n_TOF experimental setup based on MICRO MEsh GAseous Structure
(Micromegas) detector [8] for taking advantage of its high efficiency,
low mass, and high neutron transparency that permits using several in-
beam detectors [9].

2.1. Sample coating

According to these requirements, several tests of the adhesion of
natural sulfur were carried out at the Vacuum, Surfaces and Coating
(VSC) group of the Technology Department at CERN. It was found
that sulfur showed good adherence to commercially available copper-
plated kapton foils at moderate deposition temperature (60 ‚ó¶C). A strong
bonding of S and Cu could be achieved due to the formation of a stable
compound, similar to the case of S and Ag [1]. The production procedure
of the final 6 samples is described in the following.

A commercially available 50 Œºm kapton foil with 25 nm Cr and
5 Œºm Cu served as starting material. The Cu thickness was reduced
for decreasing possible background from neutron-induced reactions on
Cu. To this end, the superficial layer was removed by chemical etching.
Then, in a magnetron deposition coating equipment a 10 nm Titanium
adhesion layer and a 200 nm Cu layer were deposited without intermedi-
ate air exposure. Once the substrate was prepared the evaporation of 33S
powder, with an enrichment higher than 99% [10] was performed in a
glass bell jar of 30 cm in diameter and 35 cm in height. Few milligrams
of powder were loaded in a molybdenum boat (Balzers BD 482 056)
with a Mo cover. The central hole of 5 mm in diameter was positioned
at 11.5 cm from the substrate. The substrate was heated at 60 ‚ó¶C during
1 h. The chamber was externally heated during the same time and at
the same temperature. The pressure was decreased to 6‚ãÖ10‚àí4 mbar with
a rotary vane pump by pumping through a cold trap filled with liquid
nitrogen (LN2). The 33S powder was completely evaporated passing a
current of 70 A through the Mo boat during 5 min. A collimator (9 cm
diameter) was used to fit the dimensions of the n_TOF neutron beam
during the EAR1 fission campaign (8 cm diameter) and for avoiding
possible edge effects. Once the evaporation was finished, the sample
and the chamber were kept at 60 ‚ó¶C during 1 h.

Fig. 1 shows the substrate before (top) and after (bottom) the
evaporation of 33S. The area in which the 33S reacted with Cu is clearly
noticeable by the dark color formation of a compound between Cu
and 33S. By evaporation of masses of 33S batches with 5 and 15 mg,
six samples of different thicknesses have been produced.

2.2. Rutherford backscattering analysis

The samples were characterized at the 3 MV Tandem Pelletron
accelerator at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA, Spain). At
CNA, an accelerator line is dedicated to different Ion Beam Analysis
techniques and in particular RBS [11]. The characterization of the
samples was performed with a mono-energetic beam of 3.5 MeV 4He++.
The scattered 4He ions were recorded in a Passivated Implanted Planar
Silicon (PIPS) detector of 300 mm2, positioned at a scattering angle of
165‚ó¶. For calibration purposes a reference sample containing 18‚ãÖ10‚àí9
at/b of Pt deposited over a thick (0.5 mm) Si substrate was used. The
sample holder was tilted by 7‚ó¶ with respect to the beam direction to
avoid channeling effects. In order to perform absolute RBS measure-
ments the number of incident ùõº-particles must be precisely known. For
this purpose and to suppress secondary electrons that can produce false
current measurements, the sample holder was electrically isolated and

area in the photo on the bottom corresponds to the 33S sample.

was kept at a potential of 200 V potential, thus acting as a Faraday cup.
In this way, the ùõº-current was measured directly at the sample, which
was in contact with the sample holder. In addition, the sample holder
is equipped with a XY stage using stepping motors with a precision of
100 Œºm. This allowed an accurate positioning of the sample in the beam.
The RBS spectra were analyzed using the SIMNRA package [12].

Because of the dimensions of the samples (8 cm diameter) and
the 4He++ beam spot (3 mm), several points were analyzed for each
sample. The samples were scanned from one edge to other, not in the
radial direction, passing through the center. The energy of the 4He++
was selected at 3.5 MeV because the scattering cross-section can be
chosen as Rutherford and a good separation of the backscattered alphas
by the different elements in the sample was achieved. Indeed, the energy
of the 4He-ion in the center-of-mass (ùê∏ùëêùëö in MeV) at which the scatter-
ing cross-section deviates by 2% from its Rutherford value vs. atomic
number (ùëç) is given by ùê∏ùëêùëö=0.041+0.232‚ãÖùëç [13]. In case of 33S, the
corresponding energy in the laboratory system is 4.2 MeV (higher than
3.5 MeV). This energy is higher for heavier atoms. Therefore, in our
simulations, we will use the Rutherford cross-section for the scattering
of 4Hùê∏++ in S, Cu, Cr and Ti. For the C, N and O, we will use the

evaluated (SigmCalc) cross section data from IBANDL database, IAEA,
2014 [14].

In order to perform an accurate and precise determination of the
number of atoms of 33S few points outside the area with sulfur were also
analyzed by RBS. This allowed the determination of the number of atoms
of the elements present in the substrate reducing the free parameters
of the SIMNRA fit of the experimental data. Fig. 2 shows one of these
points where the experimental RBS spectrum (black points) is compared
with the SIMNRA simulation (red line). The biggest peak from 2500 to
2800 keV corresponds to Cu, the second in energy to Cr and third in
energy to Ti. Then, below 1200 keV the different elements present in
kapton are detected. The simulation of the area without 33S provides
a very good fit of the experimental data for Cu, Cr and Ti giving their
number of atoms in the substrate. Below 500 keV the signals from the
lighter elements of kapton are not perfectly fitted. This is due to multiple
scattering effects at low energy which are difficult to simulate. Different
points of the substrate provided the same values of the number of atoms
per unit of area within uncertainty of each element.

Fig. 3 shows a RBS spectrum (black points) in comparison with the
SIMNRA simulation (red line) of a point with 33S. Between 2000 and
2200 keV the ùõº-particles backscattered by 33S are clearly detected with
a good separation from the rest of elements allowing the determination
of the total number of atoms of 33S. The SIMNRA simulation provides a
very good fit of the 33S peak.

From the comparison between Figs. 2 and 3 other differences could
be noticed. The Cr and Ti peaks are not resolved due to the presence
of 33S. This is described by the SIMNRA simulation and the fit of the
Cr‚ÄìTi peak remains very good. When sulfur is evaporated the Cu peak is
split, which means that the 33S only reacted with a part of the Cu layer
in depth. The part of the Cu peak at higher energies corresponds to Cu
that reacted with 33S and the rest of the peak corresponds to the Cu not
reacting with 33S. The latter has a higher number of atoms of Cu per
unit of area than the former. Also this fact is described by the SIMNRA
simulation.

In order to estimate the uncertainty, several simulations of each
point were carried out. Once the experimental data were fitted with
SIMNRA, the same simulation was performed varying the number of
atoms of 33S. The result of this study for each point demonstrated that
¬±2‚Äì3% difference in the number of 33S atoms meant that the peak due to
backscattered ùõº-particles by 33S was not fitted. Thus, in order to provide
a conservative estimation of the accuracy, 3% will be considered as a
relative uncertainty of the mass. The process of data taking and fitting
the experimental data with the SIMNRA code was performed for all the

the SIMNRA [12] simulation. From higher energy to lower energy the peaks
correspond to Cu, Ti‚ÄìCr, 33S and the elements of the kapton; see text for details.

points and samples. At least fifteen points of each sample were analyzed
allowing a detailed characterization of the 33S area. Points at equal
distance from the center showed an equal number of atoms per cm2

within uncertainties. Statistical uncertainty in the number of 33S atoms
ranges between 3‚Äì5% depending on the point. For each sample, the
number of atoms of 33S obtained from each point, normalized to the ùõº-
current, was almost the same, with a maximum difference of ¬±4‚Äì5%.
Therefore, we consider the samples as homogeneous with an additional
5% uncertainty in the number of atoms. Fig. 4 shows two RBS spectra
of the same sample illustrating its homogeneity. One spectrum (black
points) was obtained in the central area of the sample and the other
(red points) at 3 cm from the center.

Table 1 summarizes the results for all the samples. The number of
atoms per barn corresponds to the calculated total mass divided by the
area of the sample for a radius of 4 cm. Several RBS analysis of the
samples have been carried out throughout four years. The results of the
analysis showed the same values of the number of atoms per barn as
Table 1 within uncertainties.

reaction.

3. Performance of the samples under neutron irradiation

The 33S(n,ùõº)30Si reaction has a ùëÑ-value equal to 3493 keV with
no threshold [15]. Therefore, ùõº-particles of around 3.4 MeV can be
detected under the irradiation with low energy neutrons. In this way,
the performance of the samples for future experiments can be tested.
At CNA, an accelerator-based neutron source has been developed. In
particular, neutron beams practically following a Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann
distribution are produced for astrophysics studies [16] [17]. The energy
spectrum of such beams has its maximum probability at 30 keV. The
neutron flux can reach up to 108 n s‚àí1 cm‚àí2, which is adequate for a
test of the samples under neutron irradiation. The details of the neutron
production method can be found in [16,17].

Sample 1 was irradiated with a neutron field similar to a Maxwellian
at kT=30 keV and the emitted alpha particles were detected with a
setup consisting of three PIPS detectors (500 Œºm). The distance from
the sample to the neutron target was 3 cm and 4 cm from the sample
to the PIPS. Fig. 5 shows a pulse-height spectrum obtained during the
irradiation. The signals between 3.4‚Äì3.5 MeV correspond to the alpha
particles produced in the 33S(n,ùõº)30Si reaction, which shows that the
energy of the ùõº-particles is not significantly degraded by the sample.
Other signals correspond to electronic noise.

A second test was carried out at the Experimental Area 1 of the
n_TOF-CERN facility. One 33S sample and one sample without 33S (see
top photo in Fig. 1), were setup in the usual configuration of Micromegas
detectors at n_TOF [9,18]. The signals detected by the Micromegas
as a function of the time are shown in Fig. 6. Blue line corresponds
to the detector with 33S and red line to the detector without 33S.
Both detectors registered very low amplitude signals corresponding
to noise and background forming the so called baseline. One large
negative amplitude signal is shown in the detector with 33S, which
corresponds to an ùõº-particle. During the test, many signals with large
amplitude were detected in the Micromegas with 33S, meanwhile no
signals with amplitude larger than the baseline were detected in the
detector without 33S. Therefore, the test shows the adequate selection
of the substrate because of the lack of signals that could contaminate
those due to the 33S(n,ùõº)30Si reaction.

Fig. 6. Snapshot of the signals registered by two Micromegas detectors, one
with 33S (blue line) and one without 33S (red line). It can be clearly seen a
signal from an ùõº-particle below the baseline in the detector with 33S. (For

4. Conclusions

Six samples of 33S were produced at VSC-CERN for 33S(n,ùõº)30Si
cross-section measurements at the n_TOF-CERN facility. The characteri-
zation by RBS performed at CNA has allowed an accurate determination
(around 9% of uncertainty) of the number of 33S atoms per unit of area
present in the samples. From 2012 to present, the samples have been
stored the major part of the time in a clean laboratory with normal air.
During the different experiments presented in this work they were in
high vacuum (10‚àí6 mbar). Under these conditions the samples have
shown an excellent stability with no loss of mass. This was checked
by means of several RBS analysis of the samples throughout these
years. Therefore, we can conclude that for first time stable bare 33S
samples of large dimensions have been produced for 33S(n,ùõº)30Si cross-
section measurements. The developed method provides ùëûùë¢ùëéùë†ùëñ homoge-
neous samples and avoids the sublimation of 33S in vacuum at room
temperature. The tests carried out at CNA and CERN demonstrated the
good performance of the samples for future experiments with the aim
of measuring the 33S(n,ùõº)30Si cross-section.
