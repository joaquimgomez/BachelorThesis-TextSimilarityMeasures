Abstract. The reactions 13C(α,n)16O and 22Ne(α,n)25Mg are the primary sources of
neutrons for the astrophysical s-process. The feasibility of cross section measurements within
the respective Gamow windows is discussed in quantitative terms for a 4π neutron counter,
based on 3He tubes and a neutron moderator, placed in an underground lab.

1. Introduction
The astrophysical s-process is responsible for the production of about half of the abundance of
the elements beyond iron in the Universe. The process is described as a succession of neutron
captures followed by β-decay taking place along the valley of nuclear stability. Starting with
seed nuclei in the iron group, elements up to bismuth can be synthesized. Actually two processes
are distinguished [1]: the main s-process, reaching Pb-Bi, for which the abundance distribution
shows the characteristic pattern of formation through a steady flow of neutrons; and the weak
s-process, reaching A ∼ 90, for which the neutron fluence is much lower. The latter is associated
with the Red Giant phase of massive stars (M > 10M�), where the temperature can reach values
high enough to activate the reaction 22Ne(α,n)25Mg during the He burning (T ∼ 3× 108K) and
C-shell burning (T ∼ 109K) stages. This reaction becomes the source of neutrons for the
weak s-process. The main s-process takes place in thermally pulsing low mass asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars. Elements are synthesized at the He inter-shell, in the time interval between
recurrent ignition events (thermal pulse, TP). The reaction 13C(α,n)16O at T ∼ 108K provides
the source of neutrons. The so-called 13C pocket is formed by proton capture reactions on the 12C
formed during TP. In addition to this, during TP when the temperature reaches T ∼ 3× 108K,
the reaction 22Ne(α,n)25Mg is activated but contributes little to the final abundances. Although
the general picture is well established a detailed description that can be correlated with the
different stellar scenarios requires precise knowledge of both (α,n) reaction rates at the relevant
stellar temperatures. This question is one of the current key issues in nuclear astrophysics.

Experimentally the cross sections at the relevant energies (Gamow window) have not been
measured and currently they are estimated from extrapolations. The limiting factor in the
measurements has been the relatively high level of neutron background in comparison with the
weak reaction rates expected at these energies. All measurements up to now have been performed
at surface level, where the natural neutron background flux is about 10−2cm−2s−1. The major
part of the background has cosmic ray origin, mostly the final product of muon interactions.
Since the level of muon flux is reduced by several orders of magnitude underground it has been
proposed that future experiments should be pursued at an underground laboratory.

The measurement of these important (α, n) cross sections is the main objective of the project
to build a nuclear astrophysics facility at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain
[2]. The project foresees the installation of a MV electrostatic accelerator in a dedicated hall,
and the development of the specific instrumentation required for the measurements. As part
of this project we are studying the feasibility of the proposed measurements. Apart from the
generic argument related to the reduction in background the sensitivity that can be reached
with specific setups has not been discussed up to now, to our knowledge. In this contribution
we present the results of the work done so far and outline how the work will continue.

2. Measurement of very low neutron rates
Over the years a variety of different detection techniques have been applied to the measurement
of the 13C(α,n)16O and 22Ne(α,n)25Mg cross sections. They included: organic scintillation
detectors [3], plastic neutron time-of-flight detectors in conjunction with γ-ray detectors
(NaI) [4], BF3 neutron counters embedded in a graphite neutron moderator [5],

3He neutron
spectrometers [6] germanium γ-ray detectors, 3He neutron counters embedded in a polyethylene
(PE) neutron moderator [7, 8] and a 4π BaF2 γ-ray calorimeter with a cadmium loaded paraffin
neutron-gamma converter [9].

The lowest energy at which a cross section was measured in the case of 13C(α,n)16O [7] is
Eα ∼ 360 keV with a value σ ∼ 60 pb. In the case of 22Ne(α,n)25Mg [8] the lowest point is at
about 800 keV with a cross section of about 130 pb. In order to make some rate estimates one
can fix the goal reference cross section value for the future measurements at 1 pb, a reduction
of two orders of magnitude in the sensitivity limit. Using a realistic value of target thickness:
n = 10−6b−1 (equivalent to about 20 µg/cm2 or an energy loss of 50 keV in the target) and
alpha beam intensity: i = 5×1014s−1 (80 pµA), one obtains a reaction rate of 5×10−4s−1 or 1.8
per hour. In addition one has to consider the detection efficiency of the neutron detector. Since
in general the efficiency is quite sensitive to neutron energy, it is important to note the energy
range of the emitted neutrons. The 13C(α,n)16O reaction has a positive Q-value of 2.216 MeV.
Assuming the beam energy reaches up to about Eα = 1.2 MeV, the range of neutrons to be
detected will be around 2.2-3.5 MeV. In the case of 22Ne(α,n)25Mg the reaction has a negative
Q-value of -0.478 MeV and the neutrons will have an energy of less than 1 MeV.

The combination of 3He proportional counters with a neutron moderator has been the most
frequently used setup until now. In our opinion it is also the best candidate to reach the lowest
sensitivity limit because: a) The detection of the thermalized neutrons through the reaction
3He + n →3 H + n (Q=764 keV) provides a very distinctive signature of neutron detection, b)
Helium filled proportional tubes are rather insensitive to gamma radiation, c) Large detection
efficiencies (≥ 50%) can be achieved using a sufficient number of long 3He tubes surrounding the
source, and d) The detection efficiency can be made rather independent of neutron energy in
the range of interest by an appropriate spatial distribution of tubes. Such devices are commonly
used also to measure β-delayed neutron emission probabilities and in fact we have built and
used for this purpose one such detector (see Fig 1), named BELEN [10]. In the following we
investigate the suitability of the BELEN detector (or a similar one) for the measurement of very
low rate (α,n) reactions. The rate of natural neutron background detected in BELEN measured

at several surface labs is around 0.6-1.2 s−1. For comparison the detector of Ref. [8], which is
the most sensitive setup used until now, had a background rate of 2.8 × 10−2s−1. This very
low background rate was achieved thanks to the use of massive passive shielding and also an
active shield to veto cosmic rays. In order to evaluate the expected rate of detected background
neutrons for any experiment in the underground lab it is necessary to know accurately the
neutron background flux at the site. More importantly it is necessary to know the energy
distribution of the neutron background field, since the cross section for neutron interactions is
strongly energy dependent. Accordingly the first step in our work has been the measurement of
the neutron flux energy distribution at LSC. The results have been published already [11] and
are described briefly here.

The measurement was performed using six 3He tubes from the BELEN detector, each
enclosed in a PE block of different size (see Fig. 2). The size of the blocks varied between
4.5cm × 4.5cm × 70cm and 27cm × 27cm × 70cm. The setup was placed in the middle of Hall
A at LSC and the measurement lasted for four weeks. The set of neutron counters is treated
as a Bonner Sphere Spectrometer (BSS) [12]. The working principle of the BSS is based on the
dependence of the number of thermalized neutrons giving a signal in the 3He counter on both
the initial neutron energy and the thickness of the moderator. The tubes from BELEN have an
active volume of �2.5cm× 60cm and a pressure of 20 atmosphere. This provides a gain of two
orders of magnitude in sensitivity when compared with conventional BSS systems. The response
of the spectrometer was calculated using the MCNPX Monte Carlo simulation code [13] and
verified with calibration measurements using a 252Cf neutron source. The deconvolution of the
neutron rates measured in the six detectors with the spectrometer response allows the extraction
of the distribution of the flux as a function of the energy. Several codes were used in order to
check for systematic deviations. Figure 3 shows the solution obtained with two different codes
and corresponds to Fig. 6 of Ref. [11]. The distribution is relatively well determined between
1 eV and 10 MeV but it is rather uncertain at thermal energies and above 10 MeV. As explained
in Ref. [11] this reflects the lack of sensitivity of our setup to those energies and is a feature of
these kinds of ill-posed inverse problems. The energy integrated flux however is rather insensitive
and was determined to be Φ = 3.44(35)×10−6cm−2s−1 which is about four orders of magnitude
smaller than at earth’s surface. Having the flux versus energy distribution, it is now possible to
make a realistic estimation of the background rate in a neutron sensitive detector using Monte
Carlo simulations. We chose the MCNPX code for this work based on our positive experience
when comparing experiment and simulation. The geometry of the BELEN detector consisted
of a total of twenty 3He tubes distributed in two rings around a central longitudinal hole of

5.5 cm radius in the PE block. Eight tubes were placed at a radius of 9.5 cm and twelve tubes
at 14.5 cm. The PE block dimensions were varied to study the shielding effect on the incoming
background neutrons. The minimum size was 50cm× 50cm× 80cm (the actual PE size for the
BELEN detector is 90cm × 90cm × 80cm.) With this arrangement the efficiency for detecting
neutrons emitted randomly from the centre of the detector was calculated as a function of energy
as shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that for this configuration the efficiency is rather constant
up to 1 MeV, with a maximum value of 47%, and drops to 37% at 2.5 MeV. To calculate the
background rate in this detector, events are simulated with energy sampled from the flux versus
energy distribution and a random direction. The neutron initial position is randomly distributed
over all outer surfaces of the PE block. The result of the simulation was sensitive to the different
flux distributions obtained in Ref. [11]. We found that the rate for the minimal PE block size
varied between 6× 10−4s−1 and 9× 10−4s−1. Increasing the size of the PE block, which acts as
shielding for the background neutrons, has a significant impact. For example an extra layer of
20 cm surrounding the initial PE block reduces the detected rate to a range between 4×10−5s−1
and 1 × 10−4s−1 depending on the flux distribution used. For a 40 cm layer the rate is in the
range 8 × 10−6s−1 to 6 × 10−5s−1. Comparing these numbers with the expected rates for the
(α,n) reactions given above one can conclude that from the point of view of neutron background
a PE moderated 3He neutron counter array is capable of measuring cross sections of a fraction
of a picobarn.

One of the advantages of using the 3He tubes from the BELEN detector in this measurement
is that we have gained essential information about background signals with an origin different
from ambient neutrons. We show in Fig. 5 the count versus amplitude histogram recorded
during the whole measuring time for one of the detectors. We should mention that detector
operation was very stable during the four week period, except for sporadic sudden increases
of noise in some detectors. These noise signals are easily removed in the off-line analysis.
Superposed on the spectrum of Fig. 5 is the characteristic spectrum of signals due to thermal
neutron capture in 3He. The shape of this spectrum, measured with a neutron source, shows
the full absorption peak and the tail due to partial deposition of energy by either the triton
or proton when the capture happens very close to the walls (wall effect). Fitting this shape

to the measured spectrum provides the number of true neutron counts. As can be observed
there are many counts in the spectrum besides those attributable to neutron capture. It is more
instructive to look at the spectrum after subtraction of the neutron signals. This is done in Fig. 6
which shows the superposition of the rate spectra belonging to the six neutron detectors. The
peak visible in the spectra in the range between 1.6-2.0 MeV corresponds to a fixed frequency
(10 Hz) pulse generator signal which was used to measure the lifetime of the data acquisition
system (DACQ). It is to be noticed that the six spectra are very similar even if the PE blocks

differ greatly in size. This points to a similar origin for the signals which could be the tube itself
or the electronics. The counts below 100 keV are associated with electronic noise. We should
mention that the data was taken with the self-triggered digital DACQ developed for BELEN.
The signals from each counter (conveniently shaped) are sent to one channel of a 100 MHz
sampling digitizer. Trapezoidal filters implemented in the firmware are applied to derive time
and amplitude information for any signal above a given threshold. Typically the threshold is
adjusted to let a certain fraction of noise signals to pass. The counts observed above 800 keV
(a flat slightly increasing component) are related to α-radioactivity present in the walls and
other materials of the tube. If the emitter is sufficiently close to the surface, the α-particle
can enter the gas volume after losing part of its initial energy. This produces a continuum
component (indicated by the line in Fig. 6) which actually extends down to zero energy. The
steep component in the spectra between 100 and 200 keV could be related to the interaction
of γ-rays in the tube. The component extending between 200 keV and 800 keV above the flat
component is not readily explained and is of unknown origin. This region coincides with the
region of neutron signals. The total rate in this energy interval varies between 5× 10−4s−1 and
9 × 10−4s−1 depending on the counter. From this number about 20% could be attributed to
the flat α-component. Such a rate is too high to allow the measurement of the proposed (α,n)
reaction cross sections of interest. For a twenty tube neutron counter such as the one described
here the total background rate will be of the order of 10−2s−1. The origin of this intrinsic
background will be investigated further. However, it should be noted that it has already been
demonstrated [14] that 3He tubes with a very low intrinsic background can be built. The tubes

were fabricated using very low activity materials and special manufacturing processes, achieving
an intrinsic background rate about 1000 times smaller than the present tubes.

3. Summary and outlook
We have investigated the issue of the feasibility of the measurement of the important
13C(α,n)16O and 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction cross sections at energies in the region of the Gamow
window in an underground lab. For this we have measured the energy distribution of the
neutron background flux at LSC and used this information to make a realistically simulation of
the rate of background events in an existing neutron counter when placed underground. The
neutron detector consists of an array of 3He tubes embedded in a PE neutron moderator which
we believe is the best candidate for this type of measurement. The results show that this
type of detector when placed underground can provide two to three orders of magnitude better
sensitivity when compared with measurements at earth’s surface, thus allowing the measurement
of cross sections of a fraction of picobarn. We have also investigated the intrinsic background of
the 3He tubes from this detector and found that it must be strongly reduced if this application
is to be successful.

The work towards the development of a dedicated neutron detector will continue. We plan
to perform a new more accurate measurement of the neutron flux energy distribution at LSC.
The measurement will use a larger set of neutron detectors than before, including bare tubes
to enhance the sensitivity at thermal energies and neutron converter-multipliers to enhance
the sensitivity at high energies. A complementary measurement using low background liquid
scintillation detectors will be carried out. The issue of the intrinsic background in 3He tubes will
be further investigated. We plan to use detectors with different characteristics (size, pressure,
gas composition and manufacturer). In particular we will study the performance of a new
3He detector specially designed to have low intrinsic background rate. The walls of the tube
are internally covered with a thin carbon layer to prevent the penetration of charged particle
activity from the walls into the gas volume. In addition to this, the accelerator induced neutron
background will be investigated.
