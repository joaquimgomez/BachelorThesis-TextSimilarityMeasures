Abstract

Accurate and reliable neutron capture cross sections are needed in many re-
search areas, including stellar nucleosynthesis, advanced nuclear fuel cycles,
waste transmutation, and other applied programs. In particular, the accurate
knowledge of 234U(n,γ) reaction cross section is required for the design and
realization of nuclear power stations based on the thorium fuel cycle. We have
measured the neutron capture cross section of 234U at the recently constructed
neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF at CERN [2] in the energy range from
0.03 eV to 1 MeV with high accuracy due to a combination of features unique
in the world: A high instantaneous neutron fluence and excellent energy reso-
lution of the n TOF facility, an innovative Data Acquisition System based on
flash ADCs [3] and the use of a high performance 4π BaF2 Total Absorption
Calorimeter (TAC) as a detection device [4, 5].

In this paper, we will describe the experimental apparatus including the various
TAC components and its performance. We also will present results from the
234U(n,γ) measurement. A sample of 38.7 mg of 234U3O8 was pressed into a
pellet and doubly encapsulated between Al and Ti foils which were 0.15 mm
and 0.2 mm thick, respectively. Monte-Carlo simulations with GEANT4 [6] of
the detector response have been performed. After the background subtraction
and correction with dead time and pile-up, the capture yield from 0.03 eV up
to 1.5 keV was derived. Preliminary analysis of the capture yield in terms of
R-matrix resonance parameters is discussed.

KEYWORDS: Neutron capture cross section, neutron time of flight,
Monte-Carlo simulations, 4π BaF2 Total Absorption Calorimeter.

1. Introduction
Neutron capture cross sections are needed for many applications, in advanced nuclear fuel

cycles and nuclear-waste transmutation, and are essential for the development and optimized
design of these concepts. Many of the relevant isotopes have received less attention in the
past, and at present the existing measured data are still insufficient, incomplete or sometimes
even lacking. These isotopes with smaller relevance for the operation of present reactors will
play an important role in the neutronics of future transmuters and in the assessment of their
transmutation performance.

The neutron capture reaction cross section of 234U, among others isotopes, needs to be mea-
sured since only two experimental data sets are available. The first one is a measurement by
Muradyan et al. [7], the second one is a recent measurement performed at LANSCE [8].

For these reasons, in 2004 we have measured the neutron capture cross section of 234U at
the recently constructed neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF at CERN [2] in the energy range
from 0.03 eV to 1 MeV.

2. Experimental Setup
2.1 Features of the n TOF facility

The neutron Time of Flight(n TOF) facility at CERN is a neutron source with a wide energy
range, where neurons are generated by spallation induced by 20-GeV/c protons onto a solid
lead target. The proton beam has a time resolution of 6 ns (r.m.s.) and an intensity up to 7.1012

protons/pulse.
The lead spallation module has been designed in order to obtain the highest figure of merit

(ratio between the neutron flux and a time resolution parameter squared). This results in a
80x80x60 cm3 lead block with a 20-cm-deep niche in the entrance face. The target is water
cooled. The water also acts as moderator for the outgoing neutron beam, strongly enhancing
the neutron flux at low energies. At present the n TOF neutron beam has two operational
modes, one for capture and another for fission. This is achieved by interchanging the second
collimator, located just in front of experimental area. This collimator has a diameter of 8.0 cm
for fission measurements and 1.8 cm for capture.

2.2 234U sample
The sample of 38.7 mg of 234U3O8 (32.7 mg of 234U, 0.231 MBq) was pressed into a pellet

and doubly encapsulated between Al and Ti foils which were 0.15 mm and 0.2 mm thick,
respectively, in order to fulfill the ISO 2919 certification requested by the safety regulations at
CERN. It isotopic purity has been determinated by γ-ray spectroscopy and is ≥ 99%.

2.3 Data Acquisition System
The high instantaneous neutron flux at n TOF, represents a great advantage especially for

the measurements of small mass and radioactive samples as in our case, but it poses relevant
problems on signal processing and acquisition due to pile-up events and large dead times.
To overcome these problems, a Data Acquisition System (DAQ) based on fast digitizers has
been used in the measurements consisting in 54 channels of high-performance Flash Analog to
Digital Converter (FADC) with 8 bit resolution. Each channel has 16 Mbytes of memory and
was operated at a sampling rate of 500 MSamples/s, thus allowing to detect the fast component

in the BaF2 signals with sufficient resolution and recording of the full detector history for
the entire neutron energy range. The raw data are sent to CERN’s massive storage facility
CASTOR via several Gbytes links. The amount of data produced during the measurements
was about 2.5 Tbytes/day.

The n TOF DAQ is running without acquisition dead time, and allows to perform a sophisti-
cated signal analysis including pile-up discrimination, resulting in an excellent mechanism for
controlling all kinds of systematic uncertainties associated with the detector’s behavior.

2.4 Total Absorption Calorimeter
The design of the n TOF Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) [10–14] is based on 40 BaF2

crystals shaped as hexagonal and pentagonal truncated pyramids forming a spherical shell with
10 cm inner radius and 15 cm thickness. Each BaF2 crystal is covered by a teflon light reflector
layer and aluminum foil and a final cover with 10B loaded carbon fiber capsule. The TAC
has a high detection efficiency for for capture events near from 100% and an acceptable energy
resolution (10% at 661.5 keV and 6% at 6.15% MeV). The targets are placed at the center of the
TAC and surrounded by a neutron absorber made of C12H20O4(6Li)2. The neutron absorber and
the 10B loaded carbon fiber capsule reduce the sensitivity of the detector to neutron scattering
and do not reduce significantly the capture detection efficiency.

Energy calibration of each detector module are weekly performed by means of 137Cs, 60Co,
88Y and Pu+C γ sources. In the interval the energy drift is monitored using the α intrinsic
radioactivity of BaF2 crystals.

Figure 1: Left: Picture of one hemisphere of the n TOF TAC. The picture shows the neutron
beam pipes, the central neutron absorber, and the 10B loaded carbon fiber capsules. Right:
Same view as implemented in the GEANT4 simulation.

3. Data reduction procedure
The experimental yield, Y (E), is determined using the following formula:

Y (E) = N
S(E) − B(E)
ν(E) εTAC(E)

(1)

PHYSOR-2006, ANS Topical Meeting on Reactor Physics

C032     4/10



where

S(E) is the number of neutrons of incoming energy E captured by the 234U sample
seen by the TAC

B(E) is the background at the neutron incoming energy E
ν(E) is the number of neutrons of incoming energy E incident on the 234U sample

εTAC(E) is the (energy dependent) TAC efficiency to detect neutrons captured by the 234U
sample

N is a normalization coefficient (N ≈ 1)

3.1 Event selection criteria
In order to improve the signal to background ratio, one first needs to determine an optimal

event selection criteria for the TAC. In our case, the main sources of background are :

• The sample radioactivity.

• Scattered neutrons captured by the TAC studied by means of a carbon sample.

• Scattered in beam gammas interacting with the TAC studied by means of a lead sample.

Although the sample is surrounded by a neutron absorber, and crystal capsules are doped with
10B, above a few hundred eV the background is mainly due to scattered neutrons. This is
because our samples were encapsulated in between two titanium foils as described before, in
order to be ISO-2919 compliant. In order to minimize this component we keep only events
for which more than one cluster is present and where a cluster consists of a connection of
neighboring crystals that have been hit.

3.2 Background subtraction
The next step consists in determining the TAC energy response to a neutron captured by a

234U nucleus with the previously defined event selection criteria. This is realized by studying
the TAC response for a few resonances, as shown in figure 2 for the first resonance. To extract
the signal from background, three histograms are needed:

1. The TAC response with the 234U sample inside but without beam (radioactive back-
ground).

2. A bidimensionnal plot giving the TAC energy response at each time-of-flight bin with an
empty canning sample (“scattering component” background).

3. A bidimensionnal plot giving the TAC energy response at each time of flight bin with the
234U sample.

Then at each time-of-flight bin, the TAC response given by the last histogram, is decomposed
in 3 components by performing a linear fit using the first two histograms (at the same time-
of-flight for the “scattering component”) and the previously obtained TAC response to 234U
only.

3.3 Efficiency determination
Although the data acquisition system used for this experiment works without introducing

any dead time, the pulse shape algorithm used may fail to find a signal in the tail of another
one. Because the counting rate can be very high, up to tens of MHz for the whole TAC, this
efficiency loss has to be properly taken into account. To take care of this count rate dependence
the efficiency term εTAC(E) can be written:

εTAC(E) =
ε0 εcriteria
DT (E)

(2)

where

εcriteria is the efficiency of the event selection criteria, i.e. the probability to have more
than one cluster hit.

ε0 is the TAC overall efficiency, i.e. the probability to detect at least one γ of the
cascade.

DT (E) is the dead time correction factor.

In order to estimate the TAC overall efficiency and its count rate dependence a simulation has
been performed. This consists in a γ-ray cascade generator from Bečvář [15] coupled to the
GEANT4 [6] simulation toolkit. A dead time model has been included in the tracking package.
This model is adjusted to reproduce the experimental histogram of interval time between two
consecutive events in a given detector of the array. The dead time correction factor is then
obtained by comparing the simulated TAC efficiency with the given criteria (more than one
cluster) at various count rates to the one obtained without dead time effect.

Simulation also shows that the TAC overall efficiency, ε0, is about 99% when no dead time
effect is considered.

C032     6/10



Figure 2 shows the TAC energy response to the first resonance of 234U(n,γ) when all events
are considered (in red), and for events where more than one cluster are involved (in black). The
criteria efficiency, εcriteria, is given by the ratio of the number of counts of the two histogram
corrected by the dead time factor associated with the resonance. The deduced efficiency is
78±1%.

3.4 Time of flight to energy relation
The distance from the 234U sample to the target moderator is 184.9±0.1 m. We took the

“n TOF default” resolution function as defined in SAMMY 1.0.8 [16].

3.5 Flux determination
For the flux above 0.7 eV, in the present analysis we took the n TOF standard flux multiplied

by the fraction of beam seen by the sample. This latter quantity is computed by simulation and
the value found is 19.8%.

From 0.03 to 0.7 eV the flux seen by sample has been deduced from a gold capture measure-
ment performed in similar conditions as the 234U measurement.

3.6 Normalization
Finally the yield has been normalized in order to reproduce the ENDF/B-VI.8 [19] 234U(n,γ)

cross section in the thermal region i.e. below 0.1 eV.

4. Preliminary results and discussion
4.1 Yield in the thermal energy region

energy (En ≤10 eV).

Figure 3 shows the neutron capture yield on 234U from 0.03 to 10 eV. Black symbols are
our data. The red curve corresponds to a SAMMY simulation using ENDF/B-VI.8 resonances
parameters. And finally the blue curve gives the SAMMY fit on our data. Although our data
are normalized to reproduce the known cross section in a thermal spectra, one can clearly see
on figure 3 that the slope given the ENDF/B-VI.8 yield does not correspond to the one given
by our data. Table 1 shows a SAMMY fit on our data, compared to the ENDF/B-VI.8 adopted
values. The quoted errors are only statistical. One should add a 0.1% error for the resonance
energies due to the uncertainty in the flight path length. For the negative energy we found a
radiation width of 26 meV, in agreement with Mughabghab value [17], which also correspond
to the JENDL-3.3 [20] evaluation, and is smaller than the ENDF/B-VI.8 value. Nevertheless
one should note our negative energy and neutron width does not correspond to the value of
Mughabghab or JENDL. But since no differential measurement has been reported up to now
down to thermal energy for this reaction, the radiation width for the negative energy was taken

equal to that of the first resonance, and the other parameters being adjusted to reproduce the
maxwellian averaged thermal cross section.

On the contrary the radiation width for the first 234U(n,γ) resonance is close to the ENDF/B-
VI.8 value, but with a variance comparable to that of JENDL-3.3 or Mughabghab. Our neutron
width is about 8% lower than that of ENDF/B-VI.8. Nevertheless, as can be seen on figure 3,
our best fit is not able to fairly reproduce the shape of the first resonance. Several reasons can be
invoked to explain such a discrepancy. Firstly the free gas model, chosen in the present analysis
to take care of Doppler broadening, is probably not well suited to describe this phenomenon
for an oxide target. Secondly our sample description included in the SAMMY fit is inaccurate.
In reality our sample consists of different layers of Ti-Al-U3O8. In SAMMY it is treated as an
homogenous mixture of all these components. The impact of such a difference in the multiple
scattering effect has not yet been investigated. And at last, some systematics may still remain in
the data reduction procedure. The ongoing work consists in the comparison of the experimental
yield using several independent procedures.

4.2 Average radiation width
The main discrepancy between the various evaluations is the average radiation width. ENDF/B-

VI.8 gives a value of 40 meV based on the transmission measurement from James et al. [18]
On the contrary the evaluation of JENDL-3.3 follows Mughabghab and gives 26 meV.

In order to disentangle these two values we performed a SAMMY analysis leaving free the
radiation width of most of the resonances up to 200 eV. Above this energy our statistics is
too low to allow to fit this parameter. The results are shown in figure 4. The resonance at
23 eV is not seen in the present data, but the parameters for the 22 eV resonance are close to

the ENDF/B-VI.8 23 eV resonance instead of the 22 eV one. We see a resonance at 67.6 eV
that is not reported in others evaluations. For the others resonances, one can see a reasonable
agreement between our SAMMY fit and the ENDF/B-VI.8 evaluation.

The preliminary average radiation width found in the present analysis is 〈Γγ〉 = 36±1.5 meV.

5. Conclusion
A measurement of the neutron capture cross section of 234U has been performed at the n TOF

facility at CERN, using the newly constructed 4π BaF2 Total Absorption Calorimeter. A yield
from 0.03 eV to 1.5 keV has been extracted, that allows to give some preliminary results. New
parameters have been extracted to describe the cross section in the thermal energy domain. The
first resonance radiation width found is 39 meV in accordance with ENDF/B-VI.8 value. The
average radiation width for resonances below 200 eV is around 36 meV.
