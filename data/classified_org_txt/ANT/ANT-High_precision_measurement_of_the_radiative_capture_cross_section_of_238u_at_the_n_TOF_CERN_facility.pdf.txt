Abstract. The importance of improving the accuracy on the capture cross-section of 238U has been addressed
by the Nuclear Energy Agency, since its uncertainty significantly affects the uncertainties of key design
parameters for both fast and thermal nuclear reactors. Within the 7th framework programme ANDES of the
European Commission three different measurements have been carried out with the aim of providing the
238U(n,γ ) cross-section with an accuracy which varies from 1 to 5%, depending on the energy range. Hereby
the final results of the measurement performed at the n TOF CERN facility in a wide energy range from 1 eV
to 700 keV will be presented.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, nuclear energy represents one of a limited
number of options available at scale to reduce greenhouse-
gas emissions. In this framework, the design of new
nuclear reactors rests its foundations upon accurate and
precise nuclear data, a list of the most urgent requirements
of which has been compiled by the Nuclear Energy Agency
[1]. This includes, the measurement of the 238U(n,γ )
reaction cross-section because of its key role in the
design calculations of nuclear reactors, governing the
behaviour of the reactor core. In particular, in the fast
region of the neutron spectrum, which is fundamental for
the calculation of fast reactors, inconsistencies between
published experimental data can reach 15%, and the
most recent evaluations disagree with each other. The
assessment of nuclear data uncertainties for innovative
reactor systems shows that the uncertainty in the radiative
capture cross-section of 238U should be further reduced to
1-3% in the energy region from 20 eV to 25 keV.

To achieve these requirements, within the 7th frame-
work programme ANDES of the European Commission
three independent measurements have been carried out,
two at n TOF and one at JRC-Geel [2]. The final results
of the 238U(n,γ ) measurement performed at the n TOF
CERN facility will be here presented. It was carried
out with a detection system constituted of two liquid
scintillators. In the data analysis, special attention was
devoted to the identification of all sources of background
and to the accurate determination of the various systematic
uncertainties.

2. Experimental setup
At the neutron time-of-flight facility of CERN, n TOF,
neutrons are generated in spallation reactions by a pulsed
20 GeV/c proton beam impinging on a lead block. The
neutron source is surrounded by 4 cm of water plus 1 cm of
borated water, which serves as a coolant and as a moderator
of the originally fast neutron spectrum [3]. The resulting
white neutron beam ranges from thermal energies up to
1 GeV. The neutrons travel through a vacuum beam line
to the experimental area, located at the nominal distance
of 185 m from the spallation target. This very long flight
path provides an excellent energy resolution, allowing to
resolve closely spaced neutron resonances.

The experimental technique used for this measurement
is the Total Energy technique, which requires that the
efficiency of the detection system is directly proportional
to the total radiative energy emitted by the capture event.
To achieve this proportionality a low solid angle detection
system has been used, consisting in two C6D6 liquid

scintillators, one commercial BICRON and one custom
made (Forschungszentrums Karlsruhe−FZK) [4], placed
face to face at 90◦ with respect to the neutron beam
direction. Afterwards, the response of the detector has
been weighted applying the so-called weighting function,
which has been calculated by means of the pulse-height
weighting technique [5].

The 238U sample used is an extremely pure metallic
plate, approximately rectangular in shape, with an area of
1621.2 ± 0.1 mm2 and a mass of 6.125 ± 0.002 g. In order
to cover the same fraction of the neutron beam, the other
samples measured for background evaluation have been
prepared with the same geometry.

3. Data reduction
During the measurement, the stability has been checked
both for the neutron flux and for the scintillators, and
runs that showed a deviation in the counting rate of
more than 3.5% have been rejected. An accurate study of
the calibrations between the flash-ADC channels and the
energy deposited by the γ -rays in the detectors has been
performed on a weekly basis.

To calculate the weighting functions (WF) required by
the total energy detection technique, the detector responses
have been simulated with the GEANT4 toolkit [7] and
convoluted with the experimental resolution. Two WF have
been produced: one considering an homogenous emission
of the γ -rays, used for the analysis of both the resolved
and unresolved resonance region, the other considering an
exponential attenuation along the neutron beam direction
to take into account the effects of neutron transport within
the sample, not negligible in the saturated resonances that
are exploited to extract the normalization factor.

The capture yield is the observable quantity measured
in a capture reaction, and it is related to the weighted
counting rate C by [6]:

Yexp(En) = N
C(En) − B(En)

Aεφn(En)
, (1)

where B(En) indicates the contribution of the background,
ε the efficiency of the detection system, A the effective
area of the sample intercepted by neutron beam and φn
the incident neutron flux. To compare the experimental
yield to its expected value, the geometry of the whole
system (including the effective area of the sample) and the
absolute value of the neutron fluence are included into a
single and energy-independent normalization factor N .

To reach the aimed precision for the cross section,
a very accurate and precise characterization of the
background that affects the measurements is fundamental.

Figure 1. 238U(n,γ ) capture yield compared with the total
background and its individual components discussed in the text.
The yields have been obtained separately for each one of the two
detectors and summed afterwards.

Five different contributions have been identified and
characterized both through experimental measurement and
MonteCarlo simulations. In Fig. 1 these component are
shown with respect to the 238U capture yield. The time
independent component of the background, due to the
natural and sample radioactivity and to air activation,
have been evaluated in a beam-off measurement. The
background related only to the neutron beam has been
measured without any sample in-beam to take into account
all the sources of background in the experimental area.
Three background components have been associated to the
presence of the sample in-beam: first of all, the background
due to γ -rays coming from sample-scattered neutrons
captured in the environmental material (the so-called
neutron sensitivity). Although the detectors exploited for
this measurement have been optimized to minimize this
kind of background, its contribution cannot be neglected
since it follows the same energy dependence as the true
capture events and may therefore compromise the analysis
of the resonances. To properly evaluate it, GEANT4
simulations have been performed with a complete
description of the geometry of the experimental area [8].
Secondly, we evaluated the background contribution due to
in-beam γ -rays through a n+natPb measurement, properly
scaled to take into account the differences in areal density
and charge number between the uranium and lead samples.
The third sample-related background component comes
from the γ -rays emitted in both fission events and decays
of fission fragments. This has been evaluated by means
of a complete set of GEANT4 simulations describing the
experimental area and the sample.

To validate the background level, it has been
additionally evaluated with an independent method
exploiting the presence of Ag, W, Co and Al black-
resonance filters in beam. The resulting background has
been properly scaled to take into account the attenuation
of both the neutron beam and the in-beam photons. The
two background yields agree for 3 < En < 100 keV within
5% except near the big Al resonances, because the total
amount of aluminum in the windows of the beam line is
not precisely known.

The neutron flux for the n TOF facility has been
evaluated combining together the results of five different

2011 evaluated flux. The ratio is plotted in the bottom panel.

detectors, as described in Ref. [9]. For the 2012
measurement campaigns not all detectors were available.
However during the entire measurement the flux at the
sample position was controlled by a thin 6Li foil that is
placed in beam and viewed by a silicon detector [10]. As
can be seen in Fig. 2, the absolute value of the flux is 13%
lower in 2012 with respect to the evaluated flux, unless
a loss of efficiency occurred, possibly due to a change of
the position of the SiMON detector or to a degeneration
of the 6Li converter foil. Nevertheless, above 0.1 eV the
flux remains constant in shape within 2% (bottom panel of
Fig. 2). This constant behaviour allows to use the evaluated
flux to extract the yield for the 238U(n,γ ) measurement
from 0.1 eV neutron energy, providing that the difference
in intensity is taken into account in the normalization
procedure.

The 238U sample has been chosen in such a way that
the first three resonances (En = 6.67, 20.9 and 36.7 eV,
respectively) are saturated, and therefore the normalization
factor N can be extracted by applying the saturated
resonance method. The expected capture yield has been
evaluated through a least-squares adjustment of the
experimental data with the SAMMY code [11]. The two
detectors have been treated separately, and in Table 1 the
different results are shown. The final normalization factors
have been chosen as the average of the three resonances,
and the mean deviation of these factors of 1% has been
adopted as the normalization uncertainty.

4. Results
The Resolved Resonance Region (RRR) in this work is
limited up to 3 keV by the decrease of the signal-to-
background ratio with neutron energy together with the
limited counting statistics. Within this energy range a
resonance shape analysis of the s-wave resonances has
been performed by means of the multilevel multichannel

Figure 3. 238U(n,γ ) cross section from this work compared to
previous measurements by Ullman et al. [13] and Kim et al. [14],
and with the cross-section recommended by Carlson et al. [15].
The top panel shows neutron energies from 3 to 80 keV, while the
bottom panel from 80 to 700 keV. The evaluated cross sections
from JEFF-3.2 is plotted for comparison.

R-matrix code SAMMY [11], starting from the parameters
reported in the JEFF-3.2 evaluated library [12]. The
resonance kernels (defined as κ = g�n�γ /(�n + �γ ))
have been used in the comparison with evaluated libraries.
In particular, the statistical distribution of kernel ratios of
this work over JEFF-3.2 and this work over ENDF/B-VII.1
is gaussian peaked at 0.99 and 1.00 respectively, with a
sigma of 0.06, illustrating the good agreement between this
work and the evaluated libraries.

For energies from 3 to 700 keV, the capture cross-
section is obtained by applying to the experimental yield
a correction factor that takes into account the sample-
related effects, i.e. self-shielding and multiple scattering
followed by capture. In this Unresolved Resonance Region
(top panel of Fig. 3) from 3 to 80 keV data from this work
are in good agreement with previous measurements by
Ullman et al. [13] and Kim et al. [14], with the cross-
section recommended by Carlson et al. [15], and with
the JEFF-3.2 evaluated cross-section. In the high energy
region from 80 to 700 keV, the cross-section from this work
deviates by more than a 20% from both the cross-section
recommended by Carlson et al. and from the JEFF-3.2
evaluated cross-section, while it is still in fair agreement
with the cross section obtained by Ullman et al. [13].

5. Conclusions
The radiative capture cross-section of 238U has been
measured at the n TOF facility of CERN in the wide
energy range from 1 eV up to 700 keV.

The very careful data reduction, with particular
emphasis on the background evaluation and subtraction,
has allowed to extract the experimental yield with very low
correlated uncertainties.

The resonance shape analysis has been performed up
to 3 keV, showing in general fair agreement with the
evaluated libraries. In the URR results from this work
are in fair agreement with previous measurements and
evaluated libraries up to 80 keV, but are about 20% higher
from 80 to 700 keV.
