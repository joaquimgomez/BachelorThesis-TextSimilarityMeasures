The neutron capture cross sections of 90,91,92,94,96Zr, which play a key role for the determination 
of the neutron density in the He burning zone of the Red Giant stars, were measured over the 
energy range from 1 eV to 1 MeV at the spallation neutron facility n_TOF at CERN. Based on 
these data the capture resonance strength and the Maxwellian-averaged cross section at 30 keV 
were calculated.

1. Introduction 

The neutron capture cross sections of the Zr isotopes are particularly relevant, since 
zirconium belongs to the first s-process peak in the solar abundance distribution at A ≈ 90. 
Although there is no s-only Zr isotope, the abundance of the neutron magic isotope 90Z is 
predominantly of s-process origin because of its low (n, γ) cross section [1]. In a similar way, 
this holds for the other even Zr isotopes as well. The most neutron rich one, 96Zr, is traditionally 
considered to be an r-only isotope with a small but significant s-process admixture due to an s-
process branching at 95Zr [2, 3]. Since this branching is open only at comparably high neutron 
densities, it is considered to be an important indicator for the efficiency of the 22Ne neutron 
source during the He shell burning episodes of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch 
(AGB) stars [3]. 

The major motivation of the present measurement was to reduce the uncertainties of 
previous data for improving the abundance predictions by stellar s-process models. This will 
then allow for a more reliable interpretation of the abundance data from astronomical 
observations. This is important because AGB stars are cool enough that their atmospheres 
contain ZrO, which allows one to deduce isotopic patterns via the molecular ZrO bands [4]. 
Complementary information was obtained from analyses of single, presolar SiC grains, which 
witness the composition of s-processed material from the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars 
[5,6]. In both cases, the observed 96Zr/94Zr ratios are smaller than expected. Whether these 
results will have consequences for the stellar models can only be discussed on the basis of 
improved neutron capture cross sections.  

2. Experimental set-up 

The neutron capture cross sections of 90,91,92,94,96Zr have been measured with high 
resolution at the n_TOF facility at CERN. The experiment was carried out at a flight path of 185 
m, using two C6D6 detectors for recording the prompt capture γ-rays. The detectors, which are 
designed for minimized neutron sensitivity [7], were mounted perpendicular to the neutron 
beam at a distance of about 3 cm from the beam axis. The background due to in-beam γ-rays 
was reduced by placing the detectors 9 cm upstream of the sample position. The γ-response was 
calibrated by means of standard 137Cs, 60Co, and Pu/C sources. The data were acquired with fast 
flash ADC using the standard n_TOF data acquisition system [8]. The zirconium samples were 
prepared from oxide powder, which was pressed to pellets 22 mm in diameter and encapsulated 
in a thin walled aluminium can. The relevant sample characteristics have been reported pre-
viously [9]. 

3. Analysis and results 

The data analysis is based on an accurate calibration of the C6D6 detectors. Ambient and 
sample related backgrounds were subtracted by means of the spectra measured with an empty 
Al can and with a Pb sample. The absolute normalization of the capture yields has been made

with an accuracy of 3% via the spectrum measured with a Au sample The Pulse Height 
Weighting Technique (PHWT) [10] is applied to the C6D6 capture data in order to achieve a 
cascade detection independent of the particular de-excitation path. The respective weighting 
functions are sensitive to the experimental set-up, including the investigated sample. These 
functions were derived by detailed Monte Carlo simulations. Fig 1 shows the capture yield for 
the 96Zr sample compared with the background obtained with the empty aluminium can. The 
background measured with the Pb sample corresponds to the effect of in-beam γ-rays, which are 
predominantly produced by (n, γ) reactions in the water moderator surrounding the spallation 
target.

A resonance analysis of the experimental yield was performed with the R-matrix code 

SAMMY [11]. Due to the high energy resolution of the n_TOF facility many new resonances 
were found. The resonance parameters measured at n_TOF are for all the Zr samples in general 
10-20% smaller than previously reported. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the 
comparison of the neutron capture kernels gΓγΓn/Γtot for the 96Zr resonances with those reported 
in the JENDL3.3 database (wwwndc.tokai-sc.jaea.go.jp/jendl/). 

In order to study the s-process abundances, the Maxwellian averaged cross sections 
(MACS) are required over a range of thermal energies. Preliminary MACS at 30 keV are 
compared in Table 1 with recommended values derived from previous data [1].

In spite of the differences found in the capture kernels, the present MACSs of the lighter 

Zr isotopes are in fair agreement with the data of Ref.[1] but were determined with significantly 
better accuracy. For 94Zr and 96Zr, where rather accurate values were reported from an activation 
measurement [3], we find discrepancies far beyond the quoted uncertainties. These two isotopes 
are important, because their cross sections are decisive for the analysis of the s-process 
branching at 95Zr and for the final 96Zr/94Zr ratio. The present results favour an increase of this 
ratio, in contradiction to observations in the atmospheres of AGB stars [4] and in pre-solar 
grains [5, 6]. Therefore, it remains to be investigated whether the 95Zr branching can be 
consistently described by the s-process models for the He burning layers of AGB stars.  

 

3. Conclusions 

The neutron capture cross sections of 90,91,92,94,96Zr have been measured at the CERN 
n_TOF facility with high resolution and with an improved experimental set-up. In this way, 
systematic uncertainties could be significantly improved. In general, capture kernels were found 
to be systematically smaller than previously reported. In some cases, this effect was 
compensated by many new resonances, so that the MACSs in the relevant range of thermal 
energies remain almost unchanged. The results for 94Zr and 96Zr present a challenge for stellar 
models to explain the low values of the 96Zr/94Zr abundance ratios found in presolar grains.
