designs may be explored for those walls that would work as discrete limiters during the 

limiter phase [7][1]. Of course, since they feature thick tungsten armour the penalty for such 

HHF designs is an overall reduction of reactor tritium breeding ratio (TBR). However, for 

those areas of FW with a moderate HHF (i.e., >2MW/m
2
), a sufficient reactor TBR may be 

maintained by proposing a de-coupled concept based on splitting the wall into plasma-facing 

units or fingers. The work presented here is focused on this proposal. 

The following list of potential advantages justifies the effort of exploring the de-coupled FW 

design based on fingers: 

• Lower thermal stress compared to the baseline FW (the baseline being the integrated 
FW, which is the BB module box front face); 

• Lower eddy currents during disruptions; 

• Compatible with medium/high heat fluxes and keeping high TBR contribution behind 
the FW; 

• Presents the possibility of a non-Eurofer structural material (e.g. a Cu alloy), which 
could improve FW power handling; 

• The BB module is isolated from potentially destructive plasma events, and in the 
event of a failure of the FW the (high investment) BB module could be salvaged; 

• FW no longer needs to be designed for the in-box LOCA load case, which for the 
integrated FW can be a design driver; 

• Separation of the highly loaded FW and the tritium-containing BB could lead to an 
improved plant safety case. 

 

1.2. Overall FW requirements and design study approach 

A DEMO FW design proposal has to meet the following requirements: 

• Survive a high heat flux (to be determined, and depends on location around the wall); 

• Reduced activation materials and coolants; 

• Structural materials must maintain good strength properties under the expected 
radiation environment; 

• The plasma-facing armour material (here assumed to be tungsten) must offer good 
impurity control, low physical and chemical erosion and low tritium permeation; 

• Survive electromagnetic loads and transient events (e.g., disruption load case), 
magnitude and frequency to be determined; 

• Operating temperatures in structural material kept within material limits. For the 
purpose of this work we take the Eurofer allowable operating temperature range to be 

300 to 550°C. 

This list of requirements is broad, so at this stage it is necessary to develop a methodology 

that allows efficient exploration of different concepts. This requires analyses which are 

computationally inexpensive but sufficiently realistic to capture the design trends. 

Subsequently the most interesting proposals will be studied in more detail with specific 

assessments including consideration of a greater range of load cases and failure modes. 

Before describing the de-coupled FW design concept, an analysis tool supporting this activity 

is introduced in the following Section.

2. THAMES: Thermo-Hydraulic Analysis Model for heat flux Exposed Surfaces 

2.1. Tool description 

Correct thermo-hydraulic modelling is one of the key aspects in the design of a high heat flux 

plasma facing component (PFC). The final thermal and mechanical performance of the 

component is directly related to the definition of the coolant conditions and how the coolant 

properties evolve at each position of the cooling channels. Coolant medium, velocity, 

temperature, pressure at each position, pressure drop and heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) 

are all key variables for proposing feasible FW designs. 

A new tool has been developed to support the FW design activity by providing all the 

necessary thermo-hydraulic information and linking it with preliminary thermal and 

mechanical finite element analysis of each explored conceptual PFC design. This tool, called 

Thermo-Hydraulic Analysis Model for heat flux Exposed Surfaces (THAMES), is 

particularly suited to rapid exploratory design/scoping studies of different de-coupled FW 

options. It consists on a 1-D finite difference Python code where thermo-hydraulic 

correlations are used to calculate coolant parameters which are then used as boundary 

conditions in linked 2-D or 3-D FE analyses. The benefits are: 

• For a given geometry and coolant inputs, calculation of the coolant regime (pressure 
drop, temperature, velocity), heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) and the subsequent 

component temperature profile is handled in a single package; 

• Determination of pressure drop for liquid or gas cooling (variable density, fully 
turbulent flow, using user-specified wall roughness); 

• Rapid calculations to support exploratory studies and comparative analysis of FW 
PFC concepts. 

THAMES requires a number of design parameters as inputs, which define the geometry, 

materials, hydraulic conditions and operating conditions. Figure 1 portrays the geometric 

parameters which are used by THAMES. In summary, these are: 

• The overall FW panel height (HFW) and width (LFW) 
• The number of channels passing across the FW panel (N), and the number of channels 

per parallel cooling circuit (n, where n=3 is shown in Figure 1) 

• Number of channels per de-coupled FW finger unit (note this is different from n, 
above). 2 or 4 channels are possible; 2 channels per finger are shown in Figure 1 

• Rectangular or circular cross-section channels; both variants are illustrated in Figure 1 
• The complete definition of the channel size and position, and finger dimensions, in 2-

D cross-section (see Figure 1, right hand side).

example shown, n=3 and N=13.

Once the case to be studied is well defined, THAMES is able to launch the analysis in one of 

three different ‘modes’: 

• 2-D Analyser Mode: used for rapid geometric and coolant parameter exploration with 
a 2-D finite element model coupled with thermo-hydraulic analyses. Just one single 

run is executed for each set of fixed parameters in 2-D (using a uniform heat flux 

distribution). 

• 3-D Analyser Mode: if the geometry and coolant parameters are known ab initio, an 
analysis with a 3-D finite element model (again coupled with thermo-hydraulic 

analyses) can be run, which provides a more accurate coolant evolution along the 

cooling circuit and a realistic temperature distribution on the component with the 

option of a detailed non-uniform heat load map. Just one single run is executed for 

each set of fixed parameters in 3-D. 

• Optimiser Mode:  a design parameter of interest (e.g. outlet coolant temperature, wall 
thickness, heat load, etc.), can be studied by sweeping it and recording the response of 

the component performance. Parameters are defined with at least one degree of 

freedom. Several runs are executed sweeping the parameter under investigation. This 

mode of analysis is only available for 2-D configurations since it would not be 

practical using the more computationally expensive 3-D runs. 

Each single run of THAMES in fact consists of an iterative loop including determination of 

whether or not the coolant is working as liquid water with local boiling, which requires 

specific correlations for HTC and Critical Heat Flux (CHF) analysis. Inputs and post-

processing are connected to the ‘core function’ where the main analyses are run. Figure 2 

shows and schematic view of the THAMES functions and calculation routine.

2.2. Fluid properties evolution 

An important feature of THAMES is how pressure and general fluid properties are calculated 

along the cooling channel. This is performed by discretising the channel along its length and 

solving the mechanical energy equation at each small step, considering an incompressible 

fluid formulation even when gaseous (as the Mach number is low). However, in the case of a 

gas coolant, temperature and density may change significantly and so it is necessary to model 

the process including both conditions: incompressible formulation but with density change. A 

finite control volume approach is applied to every small section of the channel with density 

evolving from one section to the next. 

Combining the mechanical energy equation and the Colebrook formula for the friction factor, 

we arrive at the following non-linear system to be solved iteratively at each finite step.

As a consequence, pressure (P), temperature (T), velocity (u) and density () are found at 

every section of the cooling circuit for a given heat input rate (�̇�) (Figure 3).

2.3. Heat transfer correlations in THAMES 

Two possible fluid conditions are considered in THAMES, as listed below: 

a. Coolant with just one phase (gas or liquid with no local boiling). 

The HTC is calculated at every position of the cooling circuit, and saved as a table to be 

used as input for the FE analysis. The Gnielinski correlation is chosen:

Where:

b. Water as coolant with local boiling (two phases). 

If after running a FE analysis with liquid water, and significant local boiling is detected 

(wet wall temperature higher than saturated temperature at bulk pressure), the HTC is 

recalculated as a function of the wall temperature (with the appropriate correlations) and a 

new and final FE analysis is run. The methodology and correlations described in 

references [9] to [13] are followed. The non-linear Bergles-Rohsenow correlation is 

solved in order to get the temperature of onset of nucleate boiling (ONB).

regime (no local boiling), at every ‘x’ position (following the length of the cooling 

circuit) 

The final computation step is to check that the proposed coolant conditions (pressure, 

temperature and velocity), under the studied heat load, result in sufficient margin to avoid 

a critical heat flux event. The correlation Tong75 [11] is used for this purpose by 

evaluating the wall critical heat flux parameter (WCHF):

The accuracy of the Tong correlation is only +/- 20%, and experiments are usually 

required in order to obtain a correlation which well matches true observations. Due to the 

error and the uncertainties involved when extending the use of the correlation for 

different pressure, temperatures and water velocities, a CHF margin of 1.4 is considered 

and defined in order to avoid risk of melting [12]:

2.4. 3-D modelling in THAMES including use of a non-uniform heat load distribution 

The main goal of the de-coupled FW concept is to deal with heat loads carried by particles 

leaving the plasma and interacting with the surface due to magnetic field line intersection. 

This has two very significant consequences: a highly non-uniform heat load deposition on the 

component and a locally high heat flux [1]. THAMES is able to run quick estimations of the 

behaviour of the component with 2-D FE analysis under peaked loads; however this 2-D run 

has limited capability since the heat transfer along the third dimension may be significant in 

the case of non-uniform surface heat load deposition. For this reason a 3-D analytical module 

has been developed in THAMES, which is able to provide much more accurate thermo-

hydraulic results given complex input heat load maps.  

The structure of the 3-D Analyser mode is based on an iterative process where all the thermo-

hydraulic analyses are again run in Python (using the aforementioned capabilities for the 2-D 

Analyser module), connected to Ansys to perform the FE analysis (see Figure 4). This 

iterative process allows an accurate link between the thermo-hydraulic evolutions of the 

coolant properties along the cooling circuit with the temperature distribution on the 

component. Each cooling circuit is divided into sections where the heat through the wall is 

assessed. For each iteration the heat load at each section analysed with the 3-D FE model is 

used as an input to the thermo-hydraulic analysis that will provide not only the pressure and 

velocity evolution, but also the required HTC and bulk temperature at each position for the 

next FE run in the following iteration. Convergence is defined as a stable heat flow through 



9 

 

the channel wall between successive iterations (difference in heat flow between successive 

iterations is below a certain defined limit). Finally, the result is collected and plotted.

3. Applying THAMES for exploratory design studies 

This Section further develops the use of THAMES as a tool to rapidly explore different 

design options by modelling the thermo-hydraulic properties and combining with 2-D FE 

modelling (2-D THAMES mode).  

In seeking the optimum design, two different methods may be applied for improving the 

performance of a certain proposed design: 1) modifying the cooling channel arrangements, or 

2) modifying the flow turbulence. These two methods are addressed in turn below. 

3.1. FW performance improvement by modifying cooling channel arrangements 

The goal is to increase HTC by increasing the coolant velocity, thereby improving the heat 

flux removal performance. Two strategies are suggested (keeping constant the total number 

of channels ‘N’): 

• Strategy 1: Increasing the number of channels per cooling circuit (‘n’) and keeping 
same hydraulic diameter (Dh) leading to higher mass flow rate per circuit, higher 

velocity and, as a result, higher HTC. 

• Strategy 2: Keeping the same number of channels per cooling circuit (‘n’), decreasing 
the hydraulic diameter (Dh), but the same mass flow rate per cooling circuit and hence 

higher velocity and higher HTC. 

As an illustration of Strategy 2, Figure 5 presents the temperature distribution for two 2-D 

runs in which only the hydraulic diameter is varied. Reducing Dh (in this case by reducing the 

channel height by 3mm) increases the flow velocity and HTC, reducing the peak surface 

temperature (in this case by 30 ºC) and thus enabling a higher heat flux load before reaching 



10 

 

the 550 ºC design limit. This result is for the end of a finger, i.e., inlet/outlet region, although 

the code also provides results at the mid-plane of the panel. THAMES is also able to consider 

a design option based on four channels per finger; this option is presented and described in 

detail in Section 6. 

 
Figure 5. Temperature distribution with two different hydraulic diameters 

Figures 6 and 7 show the results from THAMES when different parameters are varied and the 

consequences on the component performance. 

Figure 6 shows the influence of the parameters ‘n’ and ‘Dh’ on maximum channel 

temperature and pressure drop, when 0.5 MW/m
2
 is used as the uniform surface heat flux. 

The goal is to maximise the coolant temperature (for power cycle efficiency) without 

excessive increase in pressure drop while keeping temperatures in the structure within the 

limits. In Figure 6, the horizontal dashed red line represents the upper temperature limit 

imposed by the Eurofer material, which is taken to be 550ºC because of the potential for 

creep failure. 

Figure 7 shows the influence of the parameters ‘n’ and ‘Dh’ on structural temperature when a 

coolant temperature rise from 300 ºC to 380 ºC is maintained. The goal is to maximise the 

peak heat flux without excessive increase in pressure drop while maintaining acceptable 

temperature in the structure (again, limited to 550 ºC). 

In conclusion, it is seen that the pressure drop is much more sensitive to the parameter ‘n’ 

(number of channels per cooling circuit) than to Dh (the hydraulic diameter). However, it is 

possible to improve the cooling performance by increasing slightly ‘n’ and/or by decreasing 

moderately the hydraulic diameter, and still keeping an acceptable temperature distribution in 

the component. An increase of 20°C on the outlet coolant temperature or an increase of 0.2 

MW/m
2
 are achievable (keeping a low pressure drop increase and 550°C as maximum 

structure temperature) by using n=2 and Dh=8.5mm. Any further increase in ‘n’ (i.e., n=3) 

would result in a prohibitive pressure drop increase.

3.2. FW Performance improvement by increasing turbulence 

THAMES is able to explore FW enhancement when the design includes features intended to 

increase channel turbulence, which increases the HTC but also the pressure drop. There are 

two main ways of increasing the turbulence: 1) by changing the channel technology, and 2) 

by increasing the surface roughness.  

As mentioned above, circular, rectangular and swirl tubes are included in THAMES as 

channel technology options, and these can be either smooth or given a specified wall surface 

roughness. Figure 8 presents contour plots obtained by running in THAMES two cases with 

both helium and water as coolant. The first case (Figure 8 left) is modelled with smooth 

channels while the second one (Figure 8 right) includes channels with a roughness of 0.046 



12 

 

mm (a typical value for as-received commercial steel pipes). A constant and uniform surface 

heat flux of 0.5MW/m
2
 is assumed in both cases. As it is seen, the reduction in temperature 

may be substantial when channel roughness is taken into account.

4. Design basis for the proposed FW ‘finger’ concept 

The present Section specifies the design parameters giving basis to the proposed concept 

described in Section 5. Section 6 presents results after analysis using 2-D and 3-D THAMES. 

The design parameters are classified as those that define the geometry, those that define the 

hydraulic conditions, and those that define the loading conditions. Further, it is necessary to 

define the coolant, the heat load map (for the refined 3-D analysis), and the materials. The 

parameters listed in Table 1 are chosen for analysis using THAMES, first in 2-D and then in 

3-D mode. 

The heat load map (heat flux density distribution over the FW finger surface) is proposed as a 

constant base of 0.5 MW/m
2
 with a peak of 2 MW/m

2
 at the edge (see Figure 9). This heat 

flux map is currently arbitrary since a DEMO wall load specification is still under 

development, but using such a non-uniform heat load will test the response of the component 

to peaked loads and how well the design is able to distribute heat from hotter areas to cooler 

areas. A highly peaked heat flux distribution is expected due to the nature of off-normal 

plasma events and the effect of gaps and assembly tolerances.

* Both helium and water are proposed as coolants of the different blanket concepts in the design of DEMO. 

Although water can achieve superior heat transfer rates, it causes corrosion of the Eurofer coolant channels, and 

the channel wall may need to be made significantly thicker (to give sufficient margin) than a helium cooled 

design. Indeed the corrosion rate from water in the nucleate boiling regime (in which the HTC is highest) may 

be highly aggressive, although appropriate R&D is needed to quantify this. Another advantage of helium as 

coolant is the typical coolant pressure adopted by designers is substantially lower than for pressurised water (80 

bar vs. 155 bar, respectively), which roughly halves the primary membrane stress in the FW structural material. 

Hence, helium being chemically inert and having a lower pressure both potentially allow for a thinner FW front 

face which enables a higher heat flux before reaching thermal limits. 



14 

 

 
Figure 9. Input heat flux map applied to the de-coupled FW finger (vertical axis: finger 

width, horizontal axis: finger length). 

Regarding the parameters in Table 1, the following rationale is applied. The total number of 

channels (88) is a consequence of the assumed FW size. The FW is hydraulically arranged 

with 2 channels in series as this simplifies the FW design, and we have shown that the n=2 

case increases HTC and outlet temperature without excessive penalty in terms of pressure 

drop (Section 3.1, above). The FW Eurofer front face thickness (i.e., distance between the W-

Eurofer bond and the inner channel wall) has a drastic influence on the maximum 

temperature reached in the Eurofer. A thin wall is needed to limit the peak temperature, but it 

has to be thick enough to withstand primary and secondary stresses. Since helium is chosen 

as coolant, 1 mm thickness is assumed as a good starting value for the present study. 

The armour thickness has been chosen to be 2 mm. This is an arbitrary value and further 

studies on plasma-wall erosion will be required for its definition. A typical channel roughness 

on commercial steels is assumed (0.046 mm). The inlet temperature is selected in order to 

avoid the shift of Eurofer DBTT under irradiation. The selected outlet temperature is 

relatively low in order to lower the Eurofer maximum temperature and hence maximise the 

allowable heat flux, although this is clearly a compromise as too low an outlet temperature 

would result in prohibitively large pressure drop. The nuclear heating is selected following 

reference [15]. 

5. Design Description of the proposed de-coupled FW finger concept  

5.1. Main features of the de-coupled FW finger design 

As described in Section 1.1, a key advantage of a de-coupled FW concept based on fingers is 

the reduction in thermal stress in the discrete components compared to a continuous 

(integrated) blanket-FW panel. To illustrate this, Figure 10 shows that an individual FW 

finger comprising two cooling channels (right) has a considerably lower thermal stress than 

the continuous integrated FW (left). This is a simple reference case (see [2]) with both 

designs having a 0.5 MW/m
2
 uniform surface heat flux and equivalent hydraulic conditions, 

but the key difference is that the integrated FW has symmetry applied to the lateral faces (and 



15 

 

constraints representing the blanket stiffening grids), whereas the de-coupled FW design has 

lateral faces which are free to expand and deform. 

 
Figure 10. Equivalent (Von Mises) stress comparison for an integrated FW (left) and de-

coupled FW (right) (contour units: MPa). 

A consequence of splitting the FW into a number of components is an increase in the number 

of edges exposed to particles coming from the plasma that could potentially cause damage. 

How these edges are protected is something that strongly depends on the orientation of the 

finger. Since, in the global sense, field lines follow mainly the toroidal direction, fingers 

orientated toroidally are strongly preferred. A gentle curvature is provided to each finger 

surface in the poloidal direction in order to shadow the edges of neighbouring fingers (see 

Figure 11). 

As outlined in Section 4, it is expected that 10 x 15 mm rectangular channels with two 

channels in series (n=2) maintains reasonable pressure drop while giving good thermo-

hydraulic performance. For symmetry of cooling performance across the width of the 

component, we use two cooling circuits per finger (see Figure 11). There are therefore four 

cooling channels per finger, with the two inlets in the centre and the two returns at each side. 

 

Figure 11. FW hydraulic arrangement: inlet/outlet in the left; closing caps (turning the flow 

direction 180°) on the right. 

The proposed design comprises three main components: fingers, transition piece and the 

manifold side boxes (see Figures 12 and 13). The manifold side box delivers coolant to and 

from the FW (see details in Section 5.3), while the transition piece links this manifold to the 

finger coolant channels. The cooling circuits are closed with one side connected to the 

transition piece via weld stubs (Figure 13), and with the opposite end welded to closing caps 

which arrest and turn the flow by 180° (Figure 11, right). This compact arrangement allows 
appropriate thermal expansion on the finger length direction (by using an appropriate 



16 

 

attachment design, presented in Section 5.2), and avoids the need for coolant feed pipes on 

both sides of the BB box (by using an appropriate manifold box design, presented in Section 

5.3). 

A detailed design proposal should of course consider a specific blanket location in the DEMO 

main chamber in order to choose the right FW panel size and loading conditions that would 

drive the FW finger design parameters. The design here proposed (and later analysed, in 

Section 6), follows the parameters described at Section 4 i.e., assuming 88 cooling channels 

and a FW size of 1x1.5m.

sectional view). 

5.2. Attachment design 

An attachment concept has been developed in conjunction with the manifold design. The FW 

is not designed to be remote handled inside the machine (unlike in ITER, where remote 

maintenance of the FW is planned). Instead the FW attachment design has to provide 



17 

 

capability for exchanging it in a hot cell environment (while preserving the BB). The current 

DEMO baseline design does not have a FW replacement capable hot cell. It would be an 

economic decision whether to include this capability in the hot cell or to replace the entire BB 

but it should be technically feasible. 

A strong driver is to eliminate the need for flexible (and easily damaged) components such as 

bellows whilst allowing the high heat flux component freedom to expand and deform (and so 

minimise thermal stress). The design consists of attachment lugs fitted to the breeder Blanket 

module (see Figures 14 and 15). The first lug (starting from the edge closest to the manifold) 

has a circular location hole to fix the high heat flux component with a pinned connection 

(Figure 13). All the other lugs onwards have slotted holes to produce a sliding joint. Since the 

finger is designed ending at the opposite edge to the manifold, as shown in Figure 15, this 

attachment concept allows the high heat flux component to expand and reduces thermal stress 

in the finger and manifold. Critically, the FW attachment scheme does not rely on preloading 

features, as on ITER, as such a preload would significantly decrease with time under 

exposure to the DEMO neutron environment. 

The design of the attachment is likely to be driven by the electromagnetic loads. Section 5.4 

presents a preliminary electromagnetic analysis exploring the mechanical loads that would be 

transmitted to the attachments.

5.3. Manifold design 

A manifold design concept has been proposed and is here described. The manifold will be 

used to route coolant from the blanket segment back supporting structure to the front of the 

Blanket, each providing the FW coolant inlet and outlet for a single finger. Figure 16 shows 

the main components of the manifold: manifold side box, transition piece, and weld stubs. 



18 

 

 

 
Figure 16. Manifold concept. A: finger inlet/outlet region and weld stubs; B: mainifold side 

weld stubs; C: transition piece; D: manifold side box. 

The function of the manifold side box is to transfer coolant to and from the back supporting 

structure to the high heat flux component with a minimum pressure drop. To facilitate this, a 

large rectangular cross section has been chosen (see Figure 16, D). There is an interspace 

between the inlet and the outlet chambers aiming to reduce heat transfer between them. A 

small pocket is machined into the outlet coolant chamber, and there is a small protrusion from 

the inlet chamber. The transition piece (Figure 16, C) is located and sealed using an interface 

fit on these protrusions/pockets. A perimeter electron beam weld is then completed. 

Regarding the manufacturability, the transition piece can be manufactured by either 3-D 

printing or using conventional machining. 

The weld stubs (Figure 16, B) enable the final connection between the high heat flux 

components and the manifold by using an orbital welding head. The weld stubs can be 

electron beam welded into the respective components before final assembly. During final 

assembly an orbital welder can make the final weld once each high heat flux component has 

been attached to the blanket module. 

The manufacturing concept is in its infancy and will need further refinement as the design 

activity progresses. In particular the clearances around each component may need to be 

increased to improve welding access, together with development of the inspection regime 

post welding for quality assurance. 

5.4. Preliminary EM analyses 

A preliminary electromagnetic analysis has been conducted to assess the feasibility of the 

proposed attachment design with respect to the possible forces as a consequence of 

electromagnetic events. Moreover, this preliminary analysis is an key factor in deciding the 

orientation of the fingers. 

Figure 17 shows the component under analysis, i.e., one finger with its corresponding 

manifold. The analysis was conducted with the finger oriented 1) toroidally (as in Figure 17) 

and 2) poloidally (rotated through 90
o
). The electromagnetic loads on the component were 

computed using both an analytical and numerical approach; the analytical model is applied on 

solid rectangular blocks of equivalent cross section and the numerical model (a FE analysis) 

is applied on the geometry shown in Figure 17 (albeit with some simplifaction applied to 

enable FW meshing, etc).

Figure 17. Finger and manifold box in toroidal orientation for the EM analysis. 

In order to estimate the mechanical loads generated during a disruption we considered the 

ITER scenario described in [16] as a reference, i.e., the poloidal field decaying linearly from 

1.8 T to 0 T in 30 ms (major upward disruption, which is the worst-case scenario and gives 

the largest radial torque). The toroidal magnetic field is assumed constant during the 

disruption and equal to 8.8 T. The radial field is assumed to be zero. The induced eddy 

currents were calculated assuming quasi-static (the displacement current term in Maxwell’s 

equations is neglected) and induction-less (the magnitude of the field generated by the 

induced currents is small compared to the applied field) approximations. The electrical 

conductivity of Eurofer was taken to be 𝜎 = 1.35 MS/m. The result is summarised in Table 2.

Analytical model 1319 Nm 557 Nm 

FE model 1230 Nm 398 Nm 

The main contributor to the radial torque is the current induced on the manifold box. When 

the finger component is oriented poloidally the manifold box presents a large poloidal-facing 

area were the poloidal field variation can induce large currents. However, when the finger is 

oriented toroidally the poloidal-facing area of the manifold is greatly reduced (because of the 

aspect ratio of the manifold cross section) and, as a consequence, the induced currents and the 

torques are considerably lower. Thus, we can conclude that the toroidal orientation (as in 

Figure 17) is preferable from the EM (disruption load) point of view as well as being 

preferable with respect to charged particle heat loads, as discussed above. 

6. THAMES results for the proposed de-coupled FW finger concept 

This Section demonstrates how the THAMES 2-D and 3-D Analyser modes have been used 

in combination to analyse the design of the de-coupled FW based on fingers as presented in 

previous Sections 4 and 5. As a result of the chosen parameters and design configuration, 

THAMES provides the 2-D and 3-D temperature distribution as well as the coolant properties 

evolution along the cooling circuits. Figures 18, 19 and 20 summarise the result, as described 

next.  



20 

 

Figure 18 shows 2-D analyser temperature results on a cross section at the inlet/outlet end of 

the finger. The input distribution of heat flux across the surface results in a temperature peak 

above the right-most (outlet) channel of 564ºC. With the 2-D assumption, the component is at 

(in fact slightly above) the design limit of 550ºC with the imposed loading. However, these 

results can be regarded as conservative, as is expected since the 2-D model does not simulate 

the longitudinal transfer of heat from a heat flux peak to the cooler region of the structure. 

Also presented in Figure 18 is the temperature field, at the same inlet/outlet station, from the 

3-D THAMES model (which uses the full heat flux map in Figure 9). This result 

demonstrates the response of the finger component to a heat flux peak (‘hot spot’) of 2 

MW/m
2
. The 3-D THAMES accounts for longitudinal as well as transverse heat dissipation, 

and the resulting temperature peak of 465ºC is well within the design limit of 550ºC. 

Consequently, the component may be able to sustain heat flux peaks of greater than 2 

MW/m
2
. This is a notable result, since we know in reality that the wall heat flux will be 

highly peaked (because of plasma behaviour and the effect of gaps/assembly tolerances) but 

from the results shown here we see that considerable localised peaks can be tolerated with 

respect to structural material temperature.  

Figure 19 shows the expected non-linear evolution of the He coolant temperature, which also 

means a non-linear evolution of the velocity (since the density decreases with the temperature 

and the mass flow rate is conserved). Both temperature and velocity increase faster where the 

higher heat flux is located, i.e., cooling circuit 2. For the same reason, circuit 2 receives the 

highest temperature and velocity in the outlet (note that the specified outlet temperature of 

350°C is the result of mixing both circuits flows). However, also in Figure 19 it is seen that 

the pressure evolves linearly without a peak due to the peak heat flux (one of the channels 

presents slightly higher pressure drop than the other due to the higher velocity). 

Figure 20 shows the temperature distribution on the Eurofer component, i.e., excluding the 

tungsten tiles. The ‘hot spot’ can be observed just under the area where the peak heat flux has 

been applied. Clearly, a structural material with higher thermal conductivity would improve 

the spatial distribution of this hot spot, increasing the heat transfer from the surface to the 

cooling channels and decreasing the maximum temperature.

analyses at the edge of the finger (excluding results on tungsten tile). N=4 and n=2.

Of course, the heat flux map assumed in this study is arbitrary, and the extent to which the 

design is robust to heat flux peaks must be further studied. Also critical is the structural 

performance of the design; structural analysis must be performed to understand whether 

structural failure modes (e.g., plastic collapse, fatigue, progressive deformation) give lower 

heat flux limits than the temperature limit used here. 

7. Conclusions and future work 

This paper has presented the concept of a de-coupled first wall for the European DEMO. The 

motivation for a FW de-coupled from the blanket system is to reduce FW thermal stress, 

hence raising the heat flux limit, and to protect the blanket modules from plasma off-normal 

events. The need to explore the design space of such a proposal has led to the development of 

a bespoke thermo-hydraulic calculation tool. This tool is called THAMES, and is able to 

quickly analyse different geometrical or fluid regime cases, allows sweeping of key 

parameters, and includes the capability to validate the concept with more sophisticated 3-D 

analysis accounting for a non-uniform surface heat flux map. Each THAMES run comprises 

thermo-hydraulic analyses deriving coolant property evolution from the inlet to the outlet, 

and a coupled thermal and structural FE analysis. 

The proposed de-coupled FW concept consists of individual helium cooled “fingers”. 

Although the use of Eurofer as structural material limits the heat flux handling capability to a 

modest level, it is shown that the design would be able to withstand considerable heat flux 

peaks or “hot spots”, potentially higher than 2 MW/m
2
. This is important as it is expected that 

the FW heat flux distribution will be highly peaked and it is vital to quantify what level of 

peaking can be tolerated by plasma facing components. A design concept of the de-coupled 

finger, its attachment to the blanket module, and solutions for coolant delivery are presented. 

A preliminary electromagnetic analysis has been reported in order to scope the loading 

conditions on the attachment, and confirms that a toroidal orientation of the fingers is desired. 

Future work on this concept will involve performing more detailed structural assessments 

against a range of failure modes to improve understanding of the engineering heat flux limit 

of these components. A computational fluid dynamics analysis should be performed to 

evaluate the pressure drop due to the complex fluid flow through the manifold-finger 

interface and the fully reversing coolant return feature of the finger.
