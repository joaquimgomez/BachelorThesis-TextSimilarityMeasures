Abstract 

The neutron time of flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN is a spallation source characterized by a 
white neutron spectrum. The innovative features of the facility, in the two experimental areas, 
(20 m and 185 m), allow for an accurate determination of the neutron cross section for 
radioactive samples or for isotopes with small neutron capture cross section, of interest for 
Nuclear Astrophysics. The recent results obtained at n_TOF facility are presented.

1. Introduction 

Neutron capture reactions are the main mechanisms for synthesizing elements heavier than 
Fe in stars. About half of the elemental abundances are produced by the rapid neutron capture 
process, or r-process. This process, associated to explosive stellar scenario, is characterized by 
very high neutron densities, higher than 1020 cm-3. In this process the reaction flow is driven 
towards the neutron rich side, since neutron captures are faster than radioactive decays. The 
other half of elemental abundances are generated in the slow neutron capture process, the s-
process, in which progressively heavier elements are produced by neutron captures and 
subsequent β-decays on seed nuclei as Fe and Ni.  The stellar environment in which s-process 
takes place is characterized by neutron densities between 106 and 1012 cm-3. In these sites, the 
nucleosynthesis path proceeds along the stability valley, since β-decays are usually faster than 
subsequent neutron captures on unstable species. Exceptions are the radionuclides with a 
relatively long half life, where β-decays and neutron capture may compete. Such nuclei are 
called branching points and their study can provide important information about the s-process 
environments.

2.The n_TOF facility 

To address the needs of new data of interest for Nuclear Astrophysics, as well as for basic 
and applied Nuclear Physics, a neutron time of flight facility, n_TOF, was proposed and built at 
CERN in 2001 [1]. The facility is a pulsed white spectrum neutron source covering a wide 
neutron energy range [2]. Neutrons are produced in a monolithic Pb-spallation target, where a 
pulsed 20 GeV/c proton beam provided by the CERN Proton Synchroton (PS) impinges with a 
maximum repetition rate of 0.8 Hz. The Pb-target is surrounded by a water layer acting both as 
coolant and moderator of the neutron spectrum.

At present two beam lines are in operation, one in the horizontal direction and the other 
one, recently built, on the vertical of the spallation target. A schematic drawing of the facility is 
shown in Fig. 1. The two insets depict the two spallation targets used up to now. The neutron 
flux in the two experimental areas, in units of lethargy, is shown in Figure 2.  

The strong suppression of the thermal neutron peak in EAR1 is due to the use of 10B- 
loaded moderator, whose main purpose is to suppress the γ-background related to neutron 
capture in water. The first experimental area (EAR1), operational since the start of the facility, 
is placed at a distance of approximately 185 m from the spallation target. More details on this 
area can be found in Ref. [4]. 

 

 

Figure 2 n_TOF neutron flux at EAR1 with normal (black) and borated (red) water as moderator 
compared with neutron flux at EAR2 (blue)  

The second neutron beam and experimental area (EAR2) has been operational since 2014. 
The flight path of this line is approximately 20 m. 

The long flight path of EAR1 results in a very high energy resolution, whereas the short 
flight path of EAR2 leads to a significantly higher neutron flux. The large gain in neutron flux, 
of about a factor of 25 relative to EAR1, allows one to perform measurements with samples of 
correspondingly smaller mass or in a shorter time. Most importantly, the combination of the 
higher flux and shorter time-of-flight, a factor of 10 relative to EAR1, is particularly convenient 
when measuring radioactive isotopes, as it results in an increase of the signal-to-background 
ratio of more than two orders of magnitude for the background related to the radioactive decay 
of the sample. As a consequence, in EAR2 it becomes feasible to perform challenging 
measurements on isotopes with half-life as short as a few years, offering the unique opportunity 
to address some open questions in Nuclear Astrophysics.

3.Measurements at the n_TOF facility and their implications 

The n_TOF experimental program for Nuclear Astrophysics is mainly focused on neutron 
magic nuclei, which act as bottle neck for the reaction flow of the s-process, nuclei with A < 
120, branching poins isotopes and isotopes of special interest, like the Os isotopes relevant for 
nuclear cosmochronology.  

Of particular interest are the branching points, i.e. radioactive isotopes of relatively short 
half-life for which a competition exists between neutron capture and β-decay. The neutron 
capture cross sections of these isotopes are poorly known, manly due to the difficulties in 
producing samples of sufficient mass and adequate purity, as well as due in handling and 
measuring samples of very high activity. For these reasons, before 2001 very few measurements 
existed for these isotopes, at a time-of-flight facility, despite the fact that they could provide 
very important information on the thermodynamical conditions of the stellar site in which s-
process occurs.  

In the following a description of the most recent measurements carried out in the two 
experimental areas is reported. 

3.1 171Tm(n,γ), 147Pm(n,γ) and 204Tl(n,γ) measurements   

The isotopes 171Tm, 147Pm and the 204Tl are important s-process branching points [5]. The 
unstable isotope 171Tm (half-life 1.92 years) represents a branching in the s-process path that is 
independent of stellar temperature and therefore suited to constrain explicitly the s-process 
neutron density in low mass AGB stars. Being Tm a rare earth element, the relative abundances 
of stable the isotopes are known with high accuracy. 

The isotope 204Tl (half life 3.8 years) decays in 204Pb, which produces 205Pb when 
undergoing neutron capture. The fact that both isotopes 204,205Pb are screened from the r-process 
by the stable isotopes 204Hg and 205Tl, makes 204Tl particularly interesting, indeed, its capture 
cross section is of crucial importance for understanding the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements 
in AGB stars, but it can also be used to provide chronometric information about the time span 
between the last s-process nucleosynthesis events that modified the composition of the proto-
solar nebula and the formation of solar system solid bodies [6]. 

The 147Pm isotope is a branching point in the mass region A=147-148, that is the Nd-Pm-
Sm region. A detailed analysis of this branching is important for modeling the AGB star 
evolution and to put accurate constraints on the interplay between metallicity and initial stellar 
mass, mixing processes or hot bottom burning effects [7]. 

All these isotopes are radioactive and with a relatively short half life.  As a consequence of 
the natural activity of the sample, the measurement of the neutron capture cross section requires 
a very large instantaneous neutron flux Anther big challenge is to find a sufficient amount of 
material with adequate purity. 

The samples were all produced at the Institute Laue Langevin ILL (Grenoble, France) high 
flux reactor, by irradiating for several weeks under the thermal neutron beam the stable 
progenitors with thermal neutrons.

Figure 3 Experimental capture yield of the 171Tm(n,γ) measurement  [8] 

The measurements were performed both in EAR1 and EAR2 with C6D6 liquid scintillator 
detectors. The data analysis is currently in progress [8,9], Fig 2 reports the preliminary results of 
the 171Tm(n,γ). When the analysis will be completed it will provide for the first time 
experimental information on the capture cross section of these isotopes. 

3.27Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) measurements 

One of most important unsolved problems of nuclear astrophysics is the so called 
“Cosmological Lithium problem” [10]. It refers to the large discrepancy between the 
abundances of primordial 7Li predicted by the standard theory of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis 
(BBN) and the value inferred from the so-called “Spite plateau” in halo stars. The predictions of 
the BBN theory reproduce successfully the observations of all primordial abundances except for 
7Li, which is overestimate by more than a factor of 3. 

In the standard theory BBN, 95% of primordial 7Li is produced by the decay of 7Be 
(t1/2=53.2 days). Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain the difference between 
calculations and observation. One possible explanation of the primordial 7Li problem is related 
to the BBN calculations on the production and destruction of 7Be. In particular, while the main 
reaction producing 7Be, the 3He(α,γ)7Be reaction, is relatively well known, the cross section for 
several reactions responsible for its destruction were still uncertain until recently.  To this end 
several measurements have been performed for charge-particle induced reaction on 7Be. The 
results have ruled out the possibility that reaction induced by proton, deuterons or 3He could be 
responsible for the destruction of 7Be during BBN.  

In the BBN scenario, neutron-induced reactions on 7Be also play a role. However, despite 
of their importance in the BBN context, very few and uncertain experimental data are available 
for these reactions. In 1988 the 7Be(n,p) cross section was measured at the LANCSE neutron 
facility, Los Alamos. The result excluded a significant impact of this reaction on the 7Li 
problem [11]. However, because of the limited energy range covered in that measurement, the 
estimation of the reaction rate at BBN temperature had still to rely on some assumption. 
Therefore a more precise measurement at temperature between kT=25-50 keV is needed to 
improve the reliability of the BBN calculations.

The contribution of the 7Be(n,α) reaction to the destruction of the 7Be has always been 
considered negligible in the BBN calculation, due to its much lower estimated cross section. 
However, this assumption has never been verified experimentally, so that an uncertainty of a 
factor 10 is typically assigned to this reaction in BBN calculation [12]. 

The lack of experimental data for this reaction is essentially due to the intrinsic difficulty 
of the measurement, related to the specific activity of 7Be (about 13 GBq/µg) and the 
availability of 7Be in sufficient quantity.  

The measurement was performed in EAR2. Two samples of 20 GBq each (corresponding 
to ~2 µg), were prepared at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, with 7Be extracted from 
the cooling water of the SINQ spallation source. In the 7Be(n,α)4He reaction, two α-particles are 
emitted back to back with a relatively high energy of approximately 9 MeV. The α-particles 
were detected in two Si-sandwiches-detectors with a sample of 7Bi in between. The two α-
particles were identified on the basis of their relatively high energy and by the coincident 
method. 

 

Figure 4 The partial 7Be(n,a) cross section measure at n_TOF [13] compared with estimated cross 
section and the previous measurement at thermal energy  [14]  

The energy-dependent cross section of this reaction was measured for the first time in a 
wide range of neutron energies, from thermal to 10 keV. More details on the results can be 
found in Ref. [13]. Figure 4 shows the partial 7Be(n,α) cross section compared with previous 
cross section data used for the BBN calculation. 

The present results are in good agreement at thermal neutron energy with the only 
previous measurement [14]. The total cross section has been estimated on the basis of the 
measured partial cross section and theoretical calculations of the Direct Radiative Capture 
(DRC) mechanism. The estimated total cross section is almost a factor of 50 higher than

previously thought at low energy, but it keeps decreasing at higher energy, being a factor of 10 
lower than previous evaluations in the range of interest for BBN. Although these results clearly 
show the inadequacy of the cross section estimates used so far for this reaction in BBN 
calculations, they unambiguously indicate that this reaction cannot solve the Cosmological 
Lithium Problem, whose solution should then be searched for in alternative physical scenarios. 

4.Conclusion 

Since 2001 the n_TOF facility at CERN has been providing valuable data on neutron 
capture reactions of interest for nuclear astrophysics, as well as for energy and medical 
applications. The unique features of high flux and resolution have allowed in many cases to 
reduce the uncertainties on cross sections of various isotopes involved in s-process 
nucleosynthesis. In particular, high accuracy data have been collected on radioactive nuclides 
around branching points, on bottleneck magic nuclei, or on isotopes available only in small 
amount, of the order of a few milligrams. The construction of a second experimental area at a 
shorter flight path has recently opened the way to even more challenging measurements of (n,γ) 
and (n,charged particle) reaction on isotopes of short half-life, low cross section and limited 
amounts (possibly down to a few micrograms). All this is expected to lead in the near future to 
exciting new results and significant advancements towards the refinement of models of stellar 
nucleosynthesis.
