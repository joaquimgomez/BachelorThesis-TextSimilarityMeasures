Abstract. The neutron capture cross sections of 186,187,188Os have been measured at the CERN neutron time-of-flight
facility, n TOF, in the neutron energy range from 1 eV up to 1 MeV. In this contribution, we report the results of the
analysis of the resolved resonance region (RRR). Resonance parameters have been extracted from a full R-matrix
fit of the capture yields with the SAMMY code. A statistical analysis has been performed and the related average
resonance parameters are derived. This information is crucial for a complete understanding and modeling in terms of
the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model of the capture and inelastic reaction channels, required for the evaluation of the
stellar reaction rates of these isotopes. Maxwellian average cross sections for the range of temperatures relevant
for s-process nucleosynthesis have been derived from the combined information of the experimental data in the
resolved and unresolved resonance regions. A brief account of the implications of this analysis in the estimation of the
s-process component of the 187Os abundance and the related impact on the estimates of the time-duration of
the galactic nucleosynthesis through the Re/Os clock is given.

1 Introduction

The nucleosynthesis of Os and Re (in the mass region A ≈
190) presents interesting aspects which have been object

of considerable attention in the past as well as at present.
While both 186Os and 187Os isotopes are synthesized only by
the s-process (they are “shielded” against r-process production
by two stable isobars), an important fraction of the observed
abundance of 187Os is due to the slow β-decay of 187Re

600 International Conference on Nuclear Data for Science and Technology 2007

(half-life: 41.2 Gyr). Clayton [1], proposed to use this situation
to estimate the time-duration of the galactic nucleosynthesis,
and hence, the age of the Universe (the Re/Os clock).

For the analysis of the Re/Os clock, essential nuclear data
are the accurate neutron capture cross sections of the 186Os
and 187Os isotopes, and the β-decay rate of 187Re under stellar
conditions. The latter information has been firmly established
by a measurement of the 187Re half-life for fully-stripped
atoms [2]. In the present work, we will address the question
of the neutron capture rates. In fact, in the classical s-process
picture, the abundance ratio of this isotopic pair is directly
related to the ratio of their neutron capture cross sections.

Stellar neutron capture rates are needed namely, cross
section averaged over a Maxwellian distribution of neutron
energies (MACS), for nuclei in their ground state, as well
as in low-lying excited states. In order to derive the stellar
MACS, theoretical calculations based on the Hauser-Feshbach
statistical model theory (HFSM) are currently performed.
It is well known that only with a sound experimental de-
termination of the parameters used in HFSM calculations,
acceptable prediction of the required accuracy can be ob-
tained. Among these, average resonance parameters such as
mean level spacings 〈D〉, average radiative widths 〈Γγ〉 and
neutron strength functions S are the most important quantities
which can (and should) be determined experimentally from
neutron capture cross section measurements to establish a
reliable parametrization of the HFSM calculation.

Additional constraints on the HFSM calculations can be
established from a measurement of the inelastic scattering
cross section. This quantity provides information on the neu-
tron transmission functions for excited nuclear levels. In fact,
this additional study has been performed in a measurement of
the inelastic cross section of 187Os, populating the first excited
state in this nucleus [3].

In this contribution we report on the RRR analysis of
the 186,187,188Os neutron capture cross section measurements,
aiming at improving the nuclear data requirements for the
Re/Os clock.

2 Capture measurements at the n TOF facility

2.1 The n TOF facility

The measurements have been performed using the n TOF
pulsed neutron beam. At n TOF, neutrons are generated by
spallation reactions induced by the 20 GeV protons beam of
the CERN PS accelerator complex impinging on a massive
lead target [4]. The low repetition frequency of the proton
beam driver, the extremely high instantaneous neutron flux,
the low background conditions in the experimental area, to-
gether with improvements of the neutron sensitivity of the
capture detectors make this facility unique for neutron induced
reaction cross section measurements, with much improved
accuracy [5]. The generated neutrons are slowed down in
the lead spallation target and moderated in the surrounding
cooling water. An evacuated flight path with collimators at
135 and 175 m leads to the measuring station at a distance
of 185.2 m from the spallation target. The available neutron
energy in the experimental area runs from 1 eV up to 250 MeV

with a nearly 1/E isolethargic fluence up to 1 MeV. The
neutron beam line extends for additional 12 m beyond the
experimental area to minimize the background from back-
scattered neutrons. Background due to fast charged particles is
suppressed by a 1.5 T sweeping magnet, heavy concrete walls,
and a 3.5 m thick iron shielding [5].

2.2 Experimental setup

The characteristics of the Os samples used in the present
measurements are listed in table 1. Enriched samples were
used, 14.9 mm in diameter, encapsulated in a thin aluminum
can. Additional samples of C, Pb, and Au were used for flux
and background measurements.

The measurement is based on the detection of the
γ-rays emitted in the de-excitation cascade following a neu-
tron capture event. Two γ-rays detectors, consisting of C6D6
liquid scintillator, with minimized neutron sensitivity [6], were
placed perpendicular to the neutron beam at a distance of
about 3 cm from the beam axis. The background due to in-
beam γ-rays [5] is strongly reduced by placing the detectors
9.2 cm upstream of the sample position. The light output of the
detectors was periodically calibrated by means of radioactive
137Cs, 60Co γ-ray sources and a composite source of the
α-emitter 238Pu and C, giving a 6.13 MeV γ-ray through the
13C(α, n)16O reaction. The calibrated neutron time of flight
was used to determine the neutron energy.

The relative neutron flux was measured upstream of the
capture samples with a low mass flux monitor consisting of a
Mylar foil 1.5 µm in thickness with a layer of 200 µg/cm2 of
6Li surrounded by four Silicon detectors outside the neutron
beam, measuring the charged particles of the 6Li(n,α)3H
reaction [7]. The stability of the experimental set-up and the
neutron beam was periodically checked.

2.3 Data analysis

The detector signals were recorded with fast flash ADC using
the standard n TOF data acquisition system [8].

The Pulse Height Weighting Function Technique
(PHWT) [9], by suitably modifying via software the response
function of the detector, allows to proceed in the data analysis
in an independent way from the γ-ray spectrum of the
prompt capture γ-ray cascade. The weighting functions for
the various samples have been calculated on the basis of
Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response [10,11].
The cross sections were obtained after a complete evaluation
of the background and normalization, i.e. a carbon sample
for the effect of scattered neutrons, a lead sample for the

scattering of in-beam γ-rays, a gold sample for the neutron
flux normalization and an empty position for obtaining the
ambient background component. The cross section and the
resonance parameters were extracted from the analysis of
the background-subtracted yields.

The analysis of the resonance-dominated yields were done
with the R-matrix code SAMMY[12] using the Reich-Moore
formalism and including corrections for self-shielding and
self-absorption. In the largest majority of cases, the neutron
widths (Γn) from transmission experiments [13,14] have been
adopted and the radiative widths (Γγ) and the neutron energy
(E) obtained from the R-matrix fit. The resonance parameters
are extracted for 186Os up to 3.4 keV, for 187Os up to 2.0 keV,
and for 188Os up to 5.0 keV.

The 186Os and 188Os levels belong to a single spin popu-
lation for s-wave (J = 1/2). In the case of 187Os, the ground-
state spin is I = 1/2, therefore two values of the total angular
momentum, J = 0 and J = 1, are possible for s-wave.

An illustrative example of the SAMMY fit of 186Os data
is shown in figure 1. All the observed resonances can be
confidently assumed to be s-wave, an assumption verified by
means of statistical methods.

3 Statistical analysis and average parameters

The required parameters for statistical model calculations,
〈D0〉, 〈Γγ〉 and S 0 are estimated with the parameter sets
obtained from the analysis of RRR. Several methods have been
used for these estimates as described here below.

Staircase plots, cumulative sums of numbers of resonances
as a function of the neutron energy are shown in figure 2.
Straight-line fits to the data are from a least square analysis
up to the neutron highest energy. From the inverse slope,
s-wave average level spacings 〈D0〉 are obtained and shown in
table 2. 〈D0〉 can also be obtained using a maximum-likelihood
estimate assuming a Wigner distribution for the level spacing.
The values obtained in this way are completely consistent
with those from the straight-line fit of the cumulative number
of levels. Histograms of the nearest-neighbor spacing for
each spectrum in comparisons with theoretical distri-
bution models are shown in figure 3. As expected, the Wigner

with s ≡ D/〈D〉, gives the best representation of the experi-
mental data. In comparison to previous experimental data [15],
the estimated average level spacings of 186Os and 188Os are
lower.

The evaluated averaged radiative widths 〈Γγ〉 with their
uncertainties (statistical) are shown in table 2.

The neutron width distribution is only slightly affected by
missing or spurious levels. As well known, a Gaussian dis-
tribution of reduced neutron width (Γ0n = Γn/

√
E) amplitudes

leads to the Porter-Thomas (P-T) distribution. In estimating
the average level widths, we have assumed that they obey
P-T distribution and the larger widths are accurately measured.
Moreover, the missing level estimator [16] is utilized to
evaluate 〈gΓ0n〉, here g = (2J + 1)/{2(2I + 1)} is the statistical
weight factor. This method is used to derive various moments
of the distribution of the reduced neutron width. Estimated
〈gΓ0n〉 are also shown in table 2.

The uncertainty in S 0 is derived assuming a P-T distribution
for the reduced neutron widths and a Wigner distribution for
the level spacing, respectively. The values thus obtained of
186Os and 188Os are in agreement with the values reported by
Mughabghab [13].

4 Implication on Re/Os clock

The results of the neutron capture cross sections measured at
n TOF including the unresolved resonance region (URR) [17]
can be used to analyze their impact on the estimation of
the age from the Re/Os clock. The capture cross section
ratio of the laboratory MACS at 30 keV for 186Os and 187Os
reported in ref. [17] is Rσ = 0.42 ± 0.02. This ratio needs to
be corrected for the stellar enhancement factor, SEF, arising
from the thermal distribution of the target states in a stellar
environment. The SEFs for the 186Os and 187Os capture cross
section have been calculated using HFSM theory on the
basis of the statistical parameters determined here for these
isotopes. The result implies a stellar cross section ratio of
R∗σ = 0.36 ± 0.02. Using a simple exponential model for
the chemical enrichment of 187Re over the galactic lifetime,
we can estimate the impact of the capture cross section
uncertainties on the nucleosynthesis time duration. This value
turns out to be of the order of 0.5 Gyr. In other words, the
uncertainty due to the nuclear physics input in the Re/Os clock
can be presently estimated to be of the order of 0.5 Gyr.

Of course, for the age and for its complete uncertainty es-
timates, a full analysis with appropriate galactic chemical
evolution modeling, as well as detailed calculation of the
s-process abundances based on thermally pulsed AGB stars
require a much more extended analysis which goes beyond
the scope of the present contribution.

A full new coupled-channel calculation based on the re-
sults of the present analysis is underway and will be presented
in further publications on the subject.

5 Conclusions

A preliminary statistical analysis of the resolved resonance
parameters for the 186,187,188Os neutron capture cross section
measurements performed at CERN n TOF has been com-
pleted and the results reported here. Maxwellian average
cross sections for the range of temperatures relevant for
s-process nucleosynthesis have been derived from the com-
bined information of the experimental data in the RRR and
URR. The implications of this analysis for the s-process
component of 187Os and the related estimation of the time-
duration of the galactic nucleosynthesis through the Re/Os
clock have been shortly outlined.
