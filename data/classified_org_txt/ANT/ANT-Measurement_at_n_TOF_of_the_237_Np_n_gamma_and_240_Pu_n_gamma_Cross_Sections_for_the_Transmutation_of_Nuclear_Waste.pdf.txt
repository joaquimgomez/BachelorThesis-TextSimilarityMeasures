Abstract 
The final design, safety assessment and precise performance analysis of transmutation devices 
such as Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) or Fast Critical Reactors, need accurate and reliable 
nuclear data. The cross sections of 237Np and 240Pu have been measured in 2004 at n_TOF with 
good accuracy due to a combination of features unique in the world: high instantaneous neutron 
fluence and excellent energy resolution of the n_TOF facility [1], innovative Data Acquisition 
System based on flash ADCs and the use of a high performance BaF2 Total Absorption 
Calorimeter as a detection device. 

KEYWORDS: nuclear data, neutron capture, cross sections, total absorption 
calorimeter, Monte Carlo simulation, neptunium, plutonium. 

 

1. Introduction 
The transmutation has been proposed as a way to reduce substantially (by a factor of 1/100 or 

more) the radiotoxicity inventory of the long lived component of the nuclear waste, mainly the 
trans-uranium actinides. Actinide transmutation takes place by fission in nuclear systems like 
critical reactors or subcritical Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS). Most of the scenarios consider 
the use of fast neutron energy spectra and fuels highly enriched in high mass trans-uranium 
actinides. The detailed engineering designs, safety evaluations and the detailed performance 
assessment of dedicated transmutation ADSs and critical reactors require more precise and 
complete basic nuclear data [2]. Of crucial importance is the composition of the fuels proposed, 
with a large concentration of minor actinides (MA) and high mass plutonium isotopes.  

 
The transmutation of 237Np plays an important role because of two main reasons. First, it has 

the largest capture ratio after 239Pu in a typical ADS core loaded with a fuel highly enriched in 
MA. Second, Np is the actinide element presenting the highest leakage probability from a deep 
underground repository. The case of 240Pu has also two main implications. First, 240Pu is the 
second most abundant isotope (after 239Pu) in the irradiated fuel discharged from a commercial 
Nuclear Power Plant. Second, depending on the fuel cycle (open or closed) 240Pu can be the most 
abundant Pu isotope in the composition of the fuel for an ADS. 
 

2. Measurement and Experimental Setup 
Isotopically enriched targets of minor actinides are available typically in amounts ranging 

from 1-100 mg. Even for such small values the activity of the samples adds major difficulties to 
both to the experimental techniques and the radioprotection aspects.

The targets of 237Np (43.3 mg, 1.29 MBq) and 240Pu (51.2mg, 458 MBq) used in the 
measurements were assembled as follows: the radioactive material was sandwiched by two thin 
Al layers (total mass < 75 mg) and canned inside a 0.35 mm thick Ti canning with ISO 2919 
certification (requested by the safety regulations at CERN). Their isotopic purity has been 
determined by γ-ray spectrometry and was better than 99% for 237Np and about 90% for 240Pu 
(with a 10% contamination of 239Pu). 

 
The neutron beam was 4 cm in diameter with an instantaneous fluence of ~105 

neutrons/cm2/pulse in the neutron energy range between 0.1 eV and 1 MeV. During the 
measurements, the repetition rate of the CERN proton synchrotron (PS) was on average 3 – 4 
proton pulses for a PS supercycle of 16.4 s. The resolution in neutron energy at the 185 m flight 
path was a few times 10-4 in the energy range of interest. 

 
Figure 1: Geometry of the n_TOF Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) as it is defined in the 

GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation code. 

 
 
The capture cross section measurements at n_TOF were performed relative to the standard 

capture cross section of 197Au(n,γ). Independent and highly accurate monitors were used 
permanently for a proper normalization between the 197Au(n,γ) yield and the measured data [3]. 

 
The Data Acquisition system (DAQ) comprised 54 channels of high performance flash ADCs 

[4-5]. Each channel has 8 Mbytes memory and was operated at a sampling rate of 500 
MSamples/s, thus allowing to record the full detector history for the neutron energy range

between 0.3 eV and 20 GeV. After zero suppression and data formatting, the raw data are sent to 
CERN's massive storage facility CASTOR via several Gigabit links [6]. In parallel, especially 
designed pulse shape analysis routines are run on a PC farm and extract from the digitized 
detector signals the necessary information for further data analysis. 

 
The n_TOF DAQ offers unique features such as an extremely low dead time (<10 ns) as well 

as good signal analysis and pileup discrimination, resulting in an excellent control of the 
systematic uncertainties associated with the detector. The quality of the reconstruction of capture 
events in the sample have been discussed already in [7]. 

 
The neutron capture detection system consists of a segmented Total Absorption Calorimeter 

made of 40 BaF2 crystals with 10B loaded carbon fiber capsules, which is placed at 185 m flight 
path from the spallation source. The TAC has a nearly 100% detection efficiency for 
electromagnetic cascades (i.e. capture events) and a good energy resolution (14% at 662 keV and 
6% at 6.1 MeV). The radioactive targets are placed at the geometric center of the TAC and are 
surrounded by a C12H20O4(6Li)2 neutron absorber inside the inner hole of the TAC. The neutron 
absorber and the 10B loaded carbon fiber capsules reduce the sensitivity for the detection of 
scattered neutrons, but do not reduce the overall detection efficiency (even though they lower the 
total absorption efficiency) and also help in attenuating the low energy component (10 - 100 
keV) of the sample radioactivity. 

  
Fig.1 shows a view of the experimental setup, as it is implemented in the code [8] used for the 

detailed MC simulations of the TAC. The performance of the TAC has been investigated both 
experimentally with calibration sources and via the reference 197Au(n,γ) cross section, and by 
Monte Carlo simulations [9-10]. Furthermore, all sources of background have been measured 
and are being simulated for performing the background corrections necessary for an accurate 
capture cross section analysis. 
 

3. Data Analysis and  Preliminary Results 
The major sources of systematic uncertainties associated to the data analysis have been 

investigated in detail. 

3.1 Detection Efficiency of the TAC  
As mentioned previously, the TAC has nearly 100% efficiency for the detecting gamma ray 

cascades. However, in the real experiments the conditions were such that the best signal to noise 
(i.e. background) ratio in the data was found after selecting events with a multiplicity larger than 
2 (i.e. number of individual crystals firing) and a total energy deposition in the TAC above 2 
MeV. Under these conditions, the detection efficiency of the TAC drops down to 60% and shows 
a non negligible dependence on the particular electromagnetic (EM) de-excitation pattern of the 
gamma ray cascades. Thus, the detection efficiency of the TAC and its uncertainty has to be 
calculated for all 197Au, 237Np and 240Pu samples. First, the energy deposition spectra for selected 
resonances in the three 197Au, 237Np and 240Pu capture measurements were compared. Besides a 
degradation of the energy resolution as a function of the counting rate, the shape was found to be 
the same and nearly independent on the resonance spin. Then, the response of the TAC to 
realistic (EM) cascades was calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. For this purpose, a cascade

generator was built combining all the available information of the level schemes at low energies 
and completed with a statistical model for the de-excitation of the nucleus at higher excitation 
energies. The parameters of the model, mainly the E1, M1 and E2 gamma ray strength functions, 
had to be tuned in order to reproduce the data. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the Monte Carlo 
simulated energy deposition spectra (in red) and the experimental data (in black) for various 
multiplicities. The reproduction of the data is excellent, thus allowing us to calculate the 
detection efficiency as a function of the multiplicity with an uncertainty below 3%. A similar 
situation was found for the 237Np and 240Pu samples.

3.2 Normalization to the  197Au(n,γ)  cross section 
As it has been mentioned already, the neutron capture cross section measurements at n_TOF 

are performed relative to the 197Au(n,γ) cross section. The shape of the neutron energy spectrum 

PHYSOR-2006, ANS Topical Meeting on Reactor Physics

at the sample position has been characterized accurately and is well known [1]. A 180 mg 197Au 
sample was irradiated in between the actinide measurements and the intensity of the neutron 
beam during the measurements was monitored with the Silicon Flux Monitor [3]. The non 
standard but well known 4.9 eV resonance integral in 198Au was used for normalizing the 
measurements. The uncertainty in its resonance parameters leads to a systematic uncertainty in 
the normalization below 1%, which has to be added to an uncertainty of 2% from possible 
geometric misalignment between the samples. 

 

3.3 The neutron sensitivity of the TAC 
Neutrons scattered at the sample can be captured by the TAC materials (mainly in the Ba 

isotopes) and misidentified as true capture events. Such a background, also called neutron 
sensitivity of the detector, can be harmful since it follows the resonant structure of the neutron 
elastic scattering cross section of the samples and can lead to an artificial broadening of the 
resonances. An upgraded version of the SAMMY code that allows one to define an arbitrary 
shape of the background has been used to estimate the effect of the neutron sensitivity [11]. A 
few resonances with particularly high Γn were selected in both Np and Pu data sets. The 
background spectra due to the neutron sensitivity were computed and included in the resonance 
analysis. Its effect on the resonance parameters is below 10%. In the final analysis, the neutron 
sensitivity will be included for every single resonance.

The Multilevel Breit Wigner formalism was used for facilitating a direct comparison to the 

evaluated resonance parameters found in the ENDFB 6.8 and JENDL 3.3 libraries. The final 
analysis is being performed however following the Reich Moore formalism. A large effort was 
made in developing the software tools that allowed the fast analysis of the data set in the entire 
energy range. In this way, the effect of the individual sources of systematic uncertainties can be 
computed systematically and used for the construction of the final covariance matrices. 

 
The 237Np data have been analyzed up to 100 eV. Despite the high level density in 238Np and 

the effect of the Doppler broadening, most of the resonances described in the literature were

identified. Fig. 3 shows the comparison between the ENDF, JENDL and preliminary n_TOF 
capture cross sections for the lowest lying and strongest resonances. It was found that there is a 
slightly better agreement with the JENDL 3.3 values than with the ENDFB 6.8 data. Indeed, the 
same trend has been observed over the entire energy range, including also the tabulated 
resonance energies. The n_TOF resonance integrals are on average, 6% below the ENDFB 6.8 
values and 3% below the JENDL 3.3 values. Such deviations are compatible with the 5% 
uncertainty in the mass of the 237Np sample used for the measurements. 

 
The 240Pu data have been analyzed up to 1 keV. The 239Pu contamination was included in the 

analysis and treated by the SAMMY code as an isotopic impurity. Fig. 4 shows the comparison 
between the ENDF, JENDL, and the preliminary n_TOF capture cross sections for the lowest 
lying and strongest resonances. It can be observed that there is a huge difference for the 1.06 eV 
resonance, where the n_TOF value is 42% lower than the evaluations. A smaller but sizeable 
difference for the 90.7 eV resonance is also visible; here, the n_TOF value is about 10% below 
the ENDF and JENDL evaluations.

The average deviations for 240Pu are slightly larger than for the Np examples and could be 

partly attributed to the uncertainty of the 240Pu mass and its 239Pu impurity. The effect is under 
investigation and will be answered in the final analysis. However, no systematic effect has been 
found, which could explain the huge difference between the n_TOF and evaluated cross section 
values at 1.06 eV. Thus, the preliminary conclusion is that indeed the 1.06 eV resonance is 
significantly weaker in the capture channel than reported previously. 
 

4. Summary and Conclusions 
 
The neutron capture cross sections of 237Np and 240Pu have been measured at the n_TOF 

facility at CERN. A high performance Total Absorption Calorimeter made of 40 BaF2 crystals 
was used in the measurements. The uncertainty in the data is dominated by the 5% uncertainty in 
the mass of the samples. A preliminary resonance analysis of both data sets has been performed 
with the SAMMY code.

The results for the 237Np data up to 100 eV show good overall agreement with the ENDFB 6.8 

and JENDL 3.3 evaluated cross sections. The n_TOF resonance integrals are on average 6% 
below the ENDFB 6.8 values and 3% below the JENDL 3.3 values. Such deviations are 
compatible with the 5% uncertainty in the mass of the 237Np sample used. The resonance 
integrals obtained from the 240Pu data up to 1 keV are on average 9% below the ENDFB 6.8 and 
7% below the JENDL 3.3 evaluated values. The deviations are slightly larger than for the Np 
case and could be partly attributed to the uncertainty of the 240Pu mass and its 239Pu impurity. 
However, the n_TOF value for the 1.06 eV resonance is 42% below both evaluated libraries, 
hence in total disagreement. Possible sources of systematic uncertainties in the data are being 
investigated but such a large difference can hardly be accommodated. Taking into account that 
the agreement at higher energies is rather good, the preliminary conclusion is that indeed the 
1.06 eV resonance is significantly weaker in the capture channel than reported previously.
