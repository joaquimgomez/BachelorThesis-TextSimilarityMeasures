Abstract. The commissioning of a new setup for β-delayed neutron measurements was
carried out successfully in November-2016, at the RIKEN Nishina Center in Japan. The
β-decay half-lives and Pn branching ratios of several isotopes in the 78Ni region were
measured. Details of the experimental setup and the first results are given.

1 Motivation

Beta-delayed neutron emission (βn) is a form of radioactive decay in which an electron, an
anti-neutrino and one or more neutrons are emitted. This process arises if the energy window of
the decay Qβ is greater than the neutron separation energy S n of the daughter. The probability in each
decay of emitting neutrons is called the Pn value.

This form of decay plays a key role in the synthesis of chemical elements in the Universe via the
rapid neutron capture process, or r-process [1]. The r-process proceeds far from the valley of nuclear
stability, and leads to very neutron-rich nuclei that then decay to the line of stability. Most of these
nuclei are βn emitters. The initial abundance distribution is shaped by the decay half-life T1/2, but the
neutron emission affects the final abundances in two ways: on the one hand it shifts the decay path to
lower masses and on the other hand it provides a source of neutrons for late captures that will shift it
in the opposite way[2]. Thus, a good knowledge of Pn and T1/2 values of the nuclei between the line
of stability and the r-process path is needed for a correct understanding of the observed abundances.

Besides the astrophysical interest, the measurement of new Pn values and half-lives is also useful
for refining nuclear structure models, constraining parameters of the models and testing β-strength
functions [3]. Our current understanding of the process of β-delayed multiple neutron emission, as
well as the competition between different open channels (gamma, one-neutron, two-neutron, etc), is
incomplete because of the scarcity of experimental data [4].

With these ideas in mind, the BRIKEN (Beta-delayed-neutron-measurements at RIKEN) [5]
collaboration was established, with the aim of greatly improving the quantity and quality of data
the decays of very neutron-rich nuclei close to the r-process path.

2 Experimental setup

A detection system for direct measurements of βn-decay has been installed at the Radioactive
Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) in RIKEN, which currently provides the highest intensities of the most
neutron-rich nuclei produced by in-flight fission.

The detection system is composed of the Advanced Implantation Detector Array (AIDA) [6], and
a neutron counter. It is placed at the F11 focal plane of the BigRIPS+ZeroDegree spectrometer [7],
which serves to identify the isotopes that are implanted in AIDA.

The mission of AIDA is to register ion implantations and the subsequently emitted β particles.
It consists of a stack of six Si DSSDs. There are two different electronic branches, for high- and
low-energy events respectively. Offline, after consistency checks, the high energy events are identified
as implants, and low energy events as β particles. The highly segmented silicon strip detectors grant a
high detection efficiency and minimize accidental implant-beta correlations. A digital eventless data
acquisition system (DAQ) reads out the individual strips (1536 in total) for further processing.

2.1 The neutron counter

The neutron counter surrounding AIDA consists of a large polyethylene (PE) matrix with an array
of 140 3He tubes, owned by several collaborating laboratories, including ORNL, UPC-Barcelona,
GSI-Darmstadt and RIKEN. The neutron energies are moderated in collisions in the PE and the
neutrons are absorbed by the 3He in an exothermic reaction. The energy deposited in the tube produces

The neutron counter surrounding AIDA consists of a large polyethylene (PE) matrix with an array
of 140 3He tubes, owned by several collaborating laboratories, including ORNL, UPC-Barcelona,
GSI-Darmstadt and RIKEN. The neutron energies are moderated in collisions in the PE and the
neutrons are absorbed by the 3He in an exothermic reaction. The energy deposited in the tube produces

a signal that is amplified and acquired by a digitizer working in self-triggering mode. The data are
recorded by the eventless DAQ system Gasific developed at IFIC-Valencia [8].

The PE moderator geometry was optimized [9] in order to reach a high detection efficiency, that is
as constant as possible for neutron energies from 1 keV to few MeV. The latter is required to minimize
systematic errors in the derived Pn for decays with different neutron energy distributions.

Given the very large number of 3He tubes and their different characteristics (length, pressure,
size) a parametrized Monte Carlo optimization algorithm was developed in order to determine their
best position inside the matrix, and achieve a high and flat neutron efficiency. The configuration
finally chosen includes also two Clover-type HPGe detectors. This adds high-resolution γ-ray
spectroscopy capability with the selectivity provided by neutron tagging, giving additional nuclear
structure information.

The GEANT4 [10] simulated efficiency was crosschecked using a 252Cf neutron source. The
experimental efficiency for this source is 61 ± 2%, which is in good agreement with the simulated
efficiency of 62%. This corresponds to an average efficiency of about 68% for neutrons below
1.5 MeV.

3 Measurements

The BRIKEN setup received the first radioactive beam on November 2016. A high intensity (40 pnA)
primary beam of 238U, with energy 345 MeV/u, hit a 5 mm Be target producing a secondary beam of
exotic neutron-rich nuclei. The BigRIPS spectrometer setting was centred on 76Ni. Figure 1 shows an
identification plot of the accumulated implants during the experiment.

Figure 1. Particle identification plot of
the implanted ions.The x-axis of the plot
represents the particle mass over its
charge, and the y-axis represents the
atomic number Z. Given the high energy
during the identification, the atoms are
completely stripped of their electrons and
their charge coincides with their atomic
number.

Using these data, specific software was developed using the ROOT package [11] for merging
offline the data from the three independently running but synchronized DAQs: BigRIPS, AIDA and
BRIKEN. This software sorts the input data by time stamp, and at the same time includes in the
output stream time-correlated data for preselected parameters; also, at this point the identification
(atomic number Z and mass over charge ratio A/Q) of the implant is assigned by time coincidence
with BigRIPS events. The output can be used directly in the analysis procedure where complex
correlations, vetoes and tags can be applied. Figure 2 shows some of the correlated spectra that can
be built using this software.

The Pn value, the number of parent decays, and eventually the half-lives, are obtained from a
simultaneous fit of the implant-decay curves using the solution of the Bateman equations [12]. The
neutron efficiency is a fixed input parameter. The usual assumption that the β efficiency is independent
of the species of nucleus in the decay chain, and thus can be ignored, was tested and it was found that
it requires a demanding minimization of thresholds for β signals in AIDA.

Figure 2. For each identified isotope
(here 82Ga), the implantation-decay
time histogram can be built from the
merger output without (top left) or
with β-neutron coincidence time
window (bottom left). Gamma-ray
energy spectra in coincidence with β
particles (top- and bottom-right) can
be built integrating over a range of
implantation-decay times.

4 Results and conclusions

A total of 15 Pn values could be determined for Ni, Cu, Zn and Ga isotopes. Good agreement
was found with values in literature [13] for 76Cu, 77Cu and 82Ga, where there are several existing
measurements, thus confirming the reliability of the data. For the first time Pn values were determined
for 76,77Ni and 80Cu. In the decay of 78Ni a total of 29 β-neutron correlations were detected for the first
time. More precise results were obtained for the remaining cases, some significantly different from
previously published values. Overall these results demonstrate the good performance of the setup.

In May-June 2017, the first experimental BRIKEN campaign took place successfully. It covered
part of the currently approved proposals. Although the data are still in the preliminary stages of the
analysis we can report that several tens of new P1n and P2n values will be determined for the first time.
Additional experiments will follow in the near future.
