The Photon Strength Function of 152Sm has been investigated at n_TOF by studying the γ-ray 
spectra from resonance neutron capture of 151Sm. The experimental apparatus consisted of two 
C6D6 liquid scintillator detectors. The measured spectra were compared with the predictions of 
the DICEBOX code, for different assumptions on the Photon Stregth Functions and on the 
Nuclear Level Density. For a meaningful comparison, the model calculations were filtered 
through a detailed software replica of the experimental apparatus, performed by means of three 
different Monte Carlo simulations. Preliminary results indicate that a reasonable reproduction of 
the experimental γ-ray spectrum is obtained by postulating the presence of a Scissors 
Resonance. Some hints on the most suitable models, developed in the most recent studies of the 
Photon Strength Functions and Nuclear Level Density, are also obtained.

1. Introduction 

The study of neutron induced reactions has recently gained a renewed interest in the 
Nuclear Physics community. Accurate data from neutron studies are needed in Nuclear 
Astrophysics to improve the knowledge of Stellar Nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the 
Universe, which proceeds mainly through neutron capture processes [1]. In addition new 
concepts in nuclear technology for energy production, radioactive waste transmutation [2] and 
nuclear medicine applications [3] require accurate new data on neutron cross sections for a 
variety of isotopes, many of which are radioactive. Neutron studies can also be very useful in 
fundamental Nuclear Physics studies. Photon Strength Functions (PSF) are among the nuclear 
properties that can be conveniently investigated in neutron-induced reactions. The advantage in 
this case consists in the possibility to extend the investigation to energies below the neutron 
separation energy, as well as to isolate and analyze the spectra from resonances characterized by 
different quantum numbers, i.e. orbital angular momentum l, spin S, total angular momentum J, 
and parity. Finally, neutron reactions may allow to investigate nuclei that would be difficult to 
access with other, more standard methods. 

The renewed interest in neutron studies for fundamental and applied Nuclear Physics has 
recently stimulated the construction of a pulsed white-spectrum spallation neutron source at 
CERN: n_TOF. The facility, based on the 20 GeV/c proton beam from the Proton Synchrotron 
(PS), is characterized by a very high instantaneous neutron flux, a high resolution, a low 
background, and a wide energy range. These features make n_TOF suitable for collecting new 
and accurate data, in particular on radioactive isotopes. A high performance detectors and a 
state-of-the-art data acquisition system based on fast Flash ADC have been set-up to match the 
innovative characteristics of the neutron beam. The n_TOF facility, the experimental apparatus 
and the DAQ have been described in details in previous publications [4, 5].  

The 151Sm(n,γ) reaction was among the first successful measurements performed at n_TOF. 
This isotope is a β- emitter with a relatively short lifetime, t1/2=93 yr, so that under stellar 
conditions a competition exists between neutron capture and β-decay, with the branching ratio 
depending on the thermodynamic conditions of the stellar site in which the capture process 
occurs. Its cross-section is therefore important for constraining the temperature during He 
burning in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. Data on the 151Sm(n,γ) reaction are also 
important for advanced reactor concepts, where it determines the transmutation rate of this long-
lived fission product.  Although the sample was highly radioactive (150 GBq), the measurement 
at n_TOF was characterized by a very large signal-to-background ratio, thanks to the high 
instantaneous flux of the neutron beam, and the large neutron capture cross-section of 151Sm. 
The results on the 151Sm(n,γ) cross-sections, and their implications on Nuclear Atrophysics and 
applications have been reported in Ref. [6, 7]. 

In consideration of the very high quality data collected at n_TOF, we have recently 
undertaken a study of the Photon Strength Function for 152Sm. This isotope belongs to a nuclear

region where the nuclei undergo a transition from spherical vibrator to axial rotor [8], the 
deformation of this nucleus being  β2 = 0.243 [9]. Moreover the 152Sm assumes a crucial 
importance because it is at the critical point of the phase transition. In this particular isotope, the 
study of low excitation energy levels are able to define the real nature of the transition and to 
determine the possible presence of some particular symmetries in the Nuclear Structure of those 
nuclei [10]. The variations of the nuclear properties are expected to influence both the nuclear 
level density and the Photon Strength Functions. This trend is observed in rare earth nuclei (Nd, 
Sm, Gd and Dy) for A~150 and is particularly evident in Sm nuclides because of the presence of 
several stable or long-lived isotopes which span a wide range of atomic masses between 142 
and 154. Probably the most important phenomenon from the point of view of decay properties 
of the deformed nucleus is the so called Scissors Mode. Firstly predicted by Lo Iudice and 
Palumbo [11] and observed by Bohle et al. [12], the strength of this mode, that significantly 
influences the decay, is assumed to be proportional to the square of deformation [13]. This 
dependence comes from Nuclear Resonance Fluoresence (NRF) measurements, but it would be 
desirable to verify such a dependence in other reactions [14]. The study of 152Sm produced by 
neutron capture reaction can provide interesting information on the presence of the Scissors 
Mode, as well as on other features of the PSF at γ-ray energies below the neutron separation 
energy (Bn=8.258 MeV). 

We report here the first attempt to extract information on the Photon Strength Function 
of 152Sm, by analyzing the γ-ray spectra from resonances in the 151Sm(n,γ) reaction, and 
comparing them with different model predictions of the radiative decay. The procedure and 
preliminary results are here described and some conclusions are drawn.  
 
 
2. Experimental technique 
 

The prompt capture γ-rays were detected 
with two C6D6 liquid scintillation detectors with 
an active volume of  ~1000 cm3 [15]. The 
scintillator is contained in a thin-walled carbon 
fiber cell directly coupled to an EMI 9823 QKA 
phototube. The detectors are positioned 90 mm 
upstream of the sample with the front being about 
30 mm from the beam axis as shown in the 
schematic sketch of the setup in Figure 1. The 
samples were mounted on a remotely controlled 
carbon fiber sample changer. In this 
measurement, a 206 mg Sm2O3 powder pressed 
to a solid pellet 10 mm in diameter, sealed inside 
a canning of natural titanium, was used.

The sample was chemically purified and prepared at Oak Ridge National Laboratory 2.6 yr 
prior to the n_TOF measurement. The isotopic composition was determined by mass 
spectrometry immediately. At the time of the measurement the enrichment of 151Sm was ~88% 
with respect to the number of samarium and europium atoms while the decay product 151Eu had 
grown to slightly more than 1.7%. An empty Ti can was used to determine the ambient 
background. Samples of C, Pb and Au were also measured for determining the various 
background components and for normalization purposes. More details on the experimental 
apparatus and data analysis procedure can be found in various publications from the n_TOF 
Collaboration [16-18]. 
 

2.1 Data analysis 

The present analysis relies on the accurate determination of the γ-ray spectra for selected 
neutron capture resonances from the 151Sm(n,γ) reaction. Due to the characteristics of the liquid 
scintillator, in which the dominant interaction mechanism is Compton scattering, the deposited 
energy  in the detector ED represents a fraction of the original γ-ray energy Eγ. The resulting 
spectrum is therefore a convolution of the original γ-ray spectrum with the response of the 
detector. The poor energy resolution of the C6D6 detectors makes it impossible to compare 
directly the measured spectrum with the prediction of theoretical calculations of the γ-ray 
cascade. As described later, a different procedure has to be followed, in which the model 
predictions are filtered through the detector’s response before being compared with the 
experimental results. 

Experimental γ-ray spectra have 
been constructed for selected resonances 
of the 151Sm(n,γ) reaction. Thanks to the 
good energy resolution of the n_TOF 
neutron beam, capture resonances are 
individually identified, rejecting those 
related to contaminants in the sample. 
Figure 2 shows some of the resonances 
selected in the present analysis. The 
energy range used in the analysis is 
between 1 and 400 eV. A further 
refinement in the analysis consists in the 
background subtraction. The ambient 
background and that related to the sample 
container were measured with an empty 
Ti-can, and subtracted from the capture 
events.

regions show some selected resonances for the 
analysis of the 152Sm Photon Strength Functions.

Figure 3 shows the spectra of the energy deposited in the C6D6 for the Sm2O3 sample and 
for the Ti-can. As evident in the figure, the background is negligible (two orders of magnitude 
lower than the capture events) for deposited energies below 5 MeV. At higher energies the 
signal-to-noise ratio becomes worse, although even at 8 MeV the background is still a factor of 
two lower than the signal. As mentioned before, the contribution of the sample radioactivity is 
negligible, thanks to the high instantaneous neutron flux of n_TOF. The residual contribution, 
dominated by low energy γ-rays (Eγ < 50 keV), is suppressed by the applied threshold. The 
background from neutrons scattered by the sample and captured in or near the detectors was 
estimated by means of the carbon sample, and was found to be negligible, as expected from the 
low neutron sensitivity of the experimental set-up (see Ref. [7] for more details). Another 
background component, associated to in-beam γ-rays scattered by the sample, was investigated 
by means of a natPb sample. In this case, a sizable background is observed only for neutron 
energies above 1 keV, while in the energy region here considered this component is negligible. 

In order to compare the experimental 
results with the model prediction, the measured 
γ-ray spectra were normalized to the total 
number of capture events selected in the 
analysis. To this end, we have used the official 
n_TOF neutron flux, measured with different 
systems to an accuracy of 3 % [5]. Since the 
sample was smaller than the beam profile, only 
a fraction of neutron beam concurs to the 
capture reactions. This fraction was estimated 
from a sample of Au of the same dimensions, 
by analyzing the standard 4.9 eV resonance in 
the Au(n,γ) reaction. The SiMon detector [19] 
was used for relative normalization of the 
neutron fluence between different samples. A 
correction was also applied to account for the 
dead-time of the detector, which amounts to ~1 
% only for the strongest resonances. 

The calibration of the deposited energy was performed with three γ-ray sources: 60Co, 137Cs 
and Pu/C, and periodically checked during the measurement with the same sources. 
 
 
3. Model predictions 

 
Despite the fact that the measured γ-ray spectrum from C6D6 detectors is heavily affected 

by the poor resolution of the detector, it may still carry valuable information about the decay

C6D6 detectors, corresponding to the 
151Sm(n,γ) resonances between 1 and 400 
eV. The red histogram represents the

similar to the one enclosing the sample.

properties of this nucleus. To this end, we have performed a comparison of the measured 
spectrum with the results of theoretical models using different assumptions on the Photon 
Strength Functions (PSF) and the Nuclear Level Density (NLD). The model calculations are 
subsequently filtered through the response of the detection apparatus, to account for the 
efficiency and experimental resolution. Finally, the filtered model predictions are compared 
with the measured γ-ray spectrum to obtain information on the most appropriate PSD and NLD 
models for the nucleus under investigation. 

Artificial decay spectra of 152Sm were simulated using the DICEBOX algorithm [20]. This 
algorithm simulates  decay within the extreme statistical model, embodying Bohr's idea of a 
compound nucleus [21], the paradigm of fragmentation of photon strength [22] and validity of 
the Brink hypothesis [23, 24]. The decay of highly excited nuclear states can be described in 
terms of two entities: (i) a set of PSFs for various types of multipolarities of the emitted  
radiation, and (ii) the NLD as a function of excitation energy and spin. A detailed description of 
the PSF and NLD models used in the DICEBOX simulations can be found elsewhere [25]. In 
brief, several combinations of different models for the PSF and for the NLD were tested, with 
different assumptions on some of the parameters.  

Three contributions were considered for the Photon Strength Function, related to the dipole 
(E1) and quadrupole (E2) electric transition and to the dipole magnetic momentum (M1). The 
E1 transition, which dominates the PSF, is closely linked to the Giant Dipole Electric 
Resonances (GDERs), built in accordance with the Brink hypothesis on the ground state, as well 
as on each excited nuclear level. From rich photonuclear data it is known that the ground-state 
GDERs of the vast majority of the medium-weight and heavy nuclei at γ-ray energies above the 
neutron binding energy are described by a Lorentzian above neutron separation energy [26]. In 
transitional and deformed nuclei the Lorentzian splits into two components. In this formalism, 
the E1 PSF is written in terms of the energy EG, damping width ΓG and maximum of the 
photonuclear cross-sections σG of the two individual components of the GDER. In the present 
work, the following values were adopted for 152Sm [26]: EG = 12.38 MeV, ΓG = 2.97 MeV, and 
σG = 176 mb for the lower component, and EG = 15.74 MeV, ΓG = 5.22 MeV, and σG = 234 mb 
for the higher component of the GDER. A natural question arises in the present analysis, 
whether the Lorentzian shape remains a reasonable approximation also below the neutron 
separation energy of 152Sm at Bn = 8.258 MeV. Due to experimental limitations, the shape of the 
GDERs at energies Eγ < Bn, cannot be easily determined in a straightforward way from the 
photoabsorption experiments, let alone the case of the GDERs built on excited levels, where 
these limitations are in principle insurmountable. Some data on the intensity of primary 
transitions from (n,γ) reactions with slow neutrons, collected for 148Sm and 150Sm [27, 28], 
indicated that the Brink-Axel model is probably not completely valid at energies below the 
neutron separation energy in spherical and transitional nuclei. These data spoke rather in favor 
of a model proposed by Kadmenskij, Markushev and Furman (KMF) [29] who worked it out 
using microscopic calculations within the frame of the semi-microscopic shell model approach,

based on the results of the theory of Fermi liquids. Their expression depends on the excitation 
energy of a final level, the pairing energy and the shell-model Liquid Drop parameter. This 
model was derived for spherical nuclei and it can be taken only as a low-energy approximation 
of the E1 PSF as it diverges for Eγ = EG. It is not clear how this model would perform when 
applied to transitional and deformed nuclei. In order to describe spherical and deformed nuclei 
within one model and to remove at the same time the divergence in the KMF model, Kopecky 
and collaborators suggested the phenomenological Enhanced Generalized Lorentzian (EGLO) 
model [30]. In this work, the same values for the parameters EG, ΓG and σG were used in the 
KMF and EGLO models, as in the BA model. Another model that connects the low-energy 
behavior given by the KMF model with the BA model at higher energies was suggested in Ref. 
[31]. This model (referred here as the BA+KMF models) employs the KMF model for γ-ray 
energies below a chosen value EL and the BA model above an energy EH. In between these 
energies the PSF is expressed as a linear combination of the BA and KMF strength functions. 
An analysis of several deformed nuclei in [31] led to the conclusion that reasonable values for 
EL and EH are 4.0 MeV and 8.0 MeV, respectively. Figure 4 shows the E1 Photon Strength 
Functions calculated with the different models. 

 

 
Figure 4: Photon Strength Functions calculated with different models. The symbols refer to 
photonuclear experimental data. 
 

For the M1 photon strength functions, we have used two widely employed models: the 
Single Particle (SP) and Spin-Flip (SF) model. According to the SP model the M1 PSF is energy 
independent, while in the SF model the strength functions is assumed to be described by a 
resonance structure, with Lorentzian shape, with parameters ESF = 8.95 MeV and ΓSF = 4 MeV. 
The last parameter σSF is determined considering data for neighboring nuclei or from the ratio of 
the E1 and M1 strength functions. Both these approaches can be applied also for determining 
the constant value of the M1 PSF in the case of the SP model. The SF model predicts very small 
M1 strength for Eγ < 5 MeV. Analysis of several nuclei with 95 < A < 170 using the method of 
Two-Step Cascades showed that this is probably not fully correct and that the M1 strength plays

a non-negligible role at lower γ-ray energies [31, 32]. There are some indications that a 
“composite” model, in which a SF resonance term is combined with a SP “background”, might 
be a good description for spherical nuclei. In transitional and deformed nuclei an additional 
resonance term, known as the Scissors Resonance (SR) should occur near 3 MeV. The strength 
of this mode is believed to be scaled with the square of the deformation of the nucleus. As 152Sm 
is almost well deformed this mode should play an important role in the decay of this nucleus. 
According to the phenomenological sum-energy rule [33] the total strength of this mode built on 
the ground state in well-deformed even-even nuclei is about 3μ2N. This strength was observed 
also in many NRF experiments [34] - for 152Sm it was 2.26(9)μ2N between 2.7 and 3.7 MeV [34, 
35] - although this value is in disagreement with that derived from the analysis of Two-Step 
Cascades spectra in odd 163Dy [36] where it was about 6μ2N. The shape of the SR is again often 
described as a Lorentzian, with a set of parameters ESR (~ 3 MeV) ΓSR = 0.6 MeV [36] and σSR ~ 
0.5 mb which yield a total strength of 3μ2N. 

For the E2 photon strength function, the single particle model was used in the calculations 
with the value of 10-10 MeV-5 (see Ref. [28]). Finally, for the Nuclear Level Densities, we have 
used two common, parity-independent expressions: the Constant Temperature Formula (CTF), 
and the back-shifted Fermi Gas (BSFG) model [37]. For 152Sm, the values of the parameters 
entering in the nuclear density expressions were determined from systematics [38]. The 
following parameters were adopted in the CTF model for the level density parameter a, 
temperature T and E0: a = 18.57 MeV-1, T = 0.559 MeV, E0 = -0.37 MeV. For the BSFG, E1 was 
set to 0.37 MeV, while the prescription of Ref. [39] was used for the spin cut-off factor. 
 
 
4. Discussion and results 
 

The γ-ray cascade for 152Sm, following neutron capture on 151Sm, were generated with 
the DICEBOX code for different combinations of the E1, E2 and M1 photon strength function, 
as well as for the two choices of the Nuclear Level Density. For each set of PSFs and NLD, 106 
capture cascades in ten different nuclear realizations were generated [20]. The cascades were 
then filtered through the experimental setup by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Three 
different Monte Carlo tools were used for this purpose, namely GEANT-3.21 [40], GEANT-4 
[41] and MCNP [42]. For each of them, a detailed software replica of the experimental 
apparatus was implemented, carefully reproducing the experimental geometry and the various 
material. The γ-ray cascade was generated uniformly inside the sample and according to the 
beam profile. The purpose of using three different Monte Carlo simulations was to gain a high 
degree of confidence on the  reliability of the results. In fact, as a first step of the analysis, it was 
checked that simulations performed with the three different codes for the same nuclear cascade 
gave very similar results. This was found to be the case in the whole energy range, except for a 
small difference around 500 keV, most probably due to minor differences in the implementation

of the beam line around the sample, which enhanced in some case the interaction of emitted γ-
rays by pair production. The observed differences are however small and do not affect the 
conclusions of the present work. The generally good agreement between the three Monte Carlo 
codes therefore provided confidence on the reliability of the simulations. A check was also 
performed to ensure that the results did not depend on the nuclear realization. Finally, we have 
investigated the effect of the choice of the resonance spin J. Experimental information about 
spins of individual resonances is not available in this measurement. However, the statistical 
analysis, reported in the Ref.[7], evidenced that all resonances detected up to 400 eV neutron 
energy have likely orbital angular momentum l = 0. Capture of s-wave neutrons on the Jπ = 5/2+ 
ground state of 151Sm can form Jπ = 2+ or 3+ resonances in the compound nucleus 152Sm. The 
statistics is too low to observe any significant difference among spectra from individual 
resonances. Nevertheless, the effect of the total spin on the γ-ray spectrum was studied by 
means of simulations, by comparing the theoretical γ-ray spectra for two different assumptions 
on the resonance spin J. The model predictions, filtered through the experimental set-up with 
GEANT-3.21, did not show appreciable differences in the final spectra. In any case, for the 
comparison with experimental spectra, both capturing states were produced in the model 
calculations, and mixed together with weights given by the statistical spin probability 
distribution function (spin cut-off σC=0.98A0.29). As the influence of the resonance spin on the 
γ-ray spectra is negligible, a more realistic spin distribution is not necessary in this work.  
 

 
Figure 5: Left panel: calculated γ-ray spectrum from the decay of 152Sm formed in the 
151Sm(n,γ) reaction (green histogram). The spectra obtained after filtering through the response 
of the experimental apparatus with three different Monte Carlo codes are also shown in the 
figure (black, blue and red histogram). Right panel: a comparison between the experimental 
data (black histogram) and model calculations (in red). A small bump is observed between 2 
and 3 MeV, probably related to the presence of the scissors mode in the PSF for this nucleus. 
 

The γ-ray spectra obtained from the simulations were finally compared with the measured 
spectra in the 151Sm(n,γ) reaction, obtained from the sum of the γ-ray spectra for all resonances

below 400 eV. The experimental and the simulated data are normalized to the same number of 
captured neutrons. Some combinations of the different PSF models could be immediately 
discarded by the visual comparison between predicted and measured spectra. The left panel of 
Figure 5 shows the original γ-ray spectrum generated with DICEBOX, for a reasonable choice 
of the PSF and NLD models, and the one obtained after filtering the model predictions through 
the experimental apparatus, with the three Monte Carlo codes used in the present analysis. In the 
right panel, the filtered predictions are compared with the measured γ-ray spectrum. Good 
agreement is generally observed at higher energy for most of the models. The study of all 
possible combinations has led us to conclude that the most sensitive region for comparison, in 
the present analysis, is below 4 MeV. A feature that can be observed in the experimental 
spectrum is a small bump at around 2.5 MeV. This evidence speaks in favor of the presence of 
the Scissors Resonance, since the bump is reproduced by the model calculations only when the 
SR is included in the model calculations. 

In Figure 6 two cases are shown in which different model predictions are compared with 
the experimental data: in the left panel, the KMF model was used for E1, the SF for M1, to 
which a Scissors Resonance was added, and the BSFG model for the nuclear level density. As 
evident, the agreement is quite poor up to 2 MeV (although it improves at higher energy).  

 

  
 

Figure 6: The experimental spectrum (black histogram) is compared with two different model 
calculations (red histograms). An improved agreement with the measured spectra is obtained by 
using the BA+KMF model for the E1 PSF and adding a constant term in M1. The presence of 
the Scissors Resonance is necessary in both cases to reproduce the behavior of the measured 
spectrum around 2.5 MeV.  

 
 We have observed that in this case, the use of the BA, the KMF or EGLO models for E1, 

lead to predicted spectra that do not agree well with the measured ones. We have also observed 
that the agreement with the experiment is generally better when using the BSFG model for the 
NLD, rather than the CTF one. However, this cannot be taken as evidence that BSFG model is

more reliable, since the shape of the γ-ray spectrum is a rather complicated interplay between 
the NLD and PSFs. 

In the right panel, the theoretical cascades were generated with other sets of PSF and NLD 
models: for the E1 PSF the BA+KMF model was used; for M1 the SF model was combined 
with a constant SP background, and with a SR of total strength 3μ2N, while the BSFG model 
was used for calculating the nuclear level density. In this case, the agreement is much better. 
The presence of the Scissors Resonance with strength 3 to 6μ2N leads in general to an improved 
reproduction of the experimental result, thus providing a hint of the importance of the Scissors 
mode in this deformed nucleus. We have also observed that the introduction of a constant 
background in M1 helps in obtaining better agreement between the model predictions and the 
measured spectra. 

While some preliminary conclusions can already be drawn on the PSF and, in particular, on 
the presence of the Scissors Resonance, a more refined analysis is currently in progress, in 
which a quantitative comparison is performed by calculating the reduced χ2 between the filtered 
model predictions and the experimental γ-ray spectra. Furthermore, a comparison is also 
performed for the average radiation width of the capture resonances Γγ, which for 152Sm was 
experimentally found to be 95(4) meV. 
 
 
5. Conclusions 
 

This paper reports on a first attempt to investigate the Photon Strength Function of 152Sm,  
by studying the γ–ray spectrum measured in neutron capture on 151Sm. The measurement was 
performed at the innovative neutron time-of-flight facility at CERN, with C6D6 liquid 
scintillator detectors. The aim of the present work was to gain information on the Photon 
Strength Functions and the Nuclear Level Densities of deformed nuclei in the transitional 
region. Model calculations performed with DICEBOX, and filtered through the response of the 
experimental set-up by means of Monte Carlo simulations have been compared with the 
experimental spectra of selected resonances in the capture yield of 151Sm. Thanks to the 
excellent features of the n_TOF facility, it has been possible to obtain experimental spectra with 
very low-background. The results, though preliminary, indicate the presence of a Scissors 
Resonance in M1. A combination of models for the E1 Photon Strength Functions is also found 
to be more appropriate to reproduce the data. A further analysis, based on a more quantitative 
comparison of the model predictions and experimental results, currently in progress, may be 
useful to put some constraints on the model parameters. 

This work is the first of a series of studies that can be performed on other isotopes 
measured at n_TOF. The high instantaneous neutron flux of the neutron beam and the excellent 
background conditions are of great advantage for studies of the Photon Strength Function below 
the neutron separation energy, in particular for nuclei that would be difficult to investigate with

other methods. A disadvantage of the method presented here is related to the characteristics of 
the experimental set-up. In fact the low efficiency and the poor energy resolution of the liquid 
organic scintillator, used in some neutron capture measurements, are strongly limiting the 
quality and the predictive power of the measured γ-ray spectra. This problem is to a large extent 
overcome with the use of the BaF2 total absorption calorimeter (TAC) [43, 44], which was set in 
operation in the last part of the measurement campaign at CERN, and that will allow more 
dedicated studies of the PSF in the future.
