Total absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the β-decay intensity to states above the neutron
separation energy followed by γ-ray emission in 87;88Br and 94Rb. Accurate results are obtained thanks to a
careful control of systematic errors. An unexpectedly large γ intensity is observed in all three cases
extending well beyond the excitation energy region where neutron penetration is hindered by low neutron
energy. The γ branching as a function of excitation energy is compared to Hauser-Feshbach model
calculations. For 87Br and 88Br the γ branching reaches 57% and 20%, respectively, and could be explained
as a nuclear structure effect. Some of the states populated in the daughter can only decay through the
emission of a large orbital angular momentum neutron with a strongly reduced barrier penetrability. In the
case of neutron-rich 94Rb the observed 4.5% branching is much larger than the calculations performed with
standard nuclear statistical model parameters, even after proper correction for fluctuation effects on
individual transition widths. The difference can be reconciled by introducing an enhancement of 1 order of
magnitude in the photon strength to neutron strength ratio. An increase in the photon strength function of
such magnitude for very neutron-rich nuclei, if it proves to be correct, leads to a similar increase in the (n; γ)
cross section that would have an impact on r process abundance calculations.

Neutron unbound states can be populated in the β decay
of very neutron-rich nuclei, when the neutron separation
energy Sn in the daughter nucleus is lower than the decay
energy window Qβ. Given the relative strengths of strong
and electromagnetic interactions these states decay prefer-
entially by neutron emission. Beta-delayed γ-ray emission
from states above Sn was first observed in 1972 in the decay
of 87Br [1]. Since then it has been observed in a handful of
cases: 137I [2], 93Rb [3], 85As [4], 141Cs [5], 95Rb [6], 94Rb
[7], 77Cu [8], and 75Cu [9]. The paucity of information is
related to the difficulty of detecting weak high-energy γ-ray
cascades with the germanium detectors that are usually
employed in β-decay studies. This problem also leads to a
systematic error, known as the pandemonium effect [10],
that displaces the apparent decay intensity towards low
excitation energies.
There is an analogy [11] between this decay process and

neutron capture reactions that populate states in the com-
pound nucleus that reemit a neutron (elastic channel) or

deexcite by γ rays (radiative capture). Indeed, the reaction
cross section is parametrized in terms of neutron and γ
widths Γn and Γγ, respectively, which also determines the
fraction of β intensity above Sn that proceeds by neutron or
γ emission. Radiative capture (n; γ) cross sections for very
neutron-rich nuclei are a key ingredient in reaction network
calculations used to obtain the yield of elements heavier
than iron in the rapid (r) neutron capture process occurring
in explosivelike stellar events. It has been shown [12–14]
that the abundance distributions in different astrophysical
scenarios are sensitive to (n; γ) cross sections. In the
classical “hot” r process late captures during freeze out
modify the final element abundance. In the “cold” r process
the competition between neutron captures and β decays
determines the formation path. Cross section values for
these exotic nuclei are taken from Hauser-Feshbach model
calculations [15], which are based on a few quantities
describing average nuclear properties: nuclear level den-
sities (NLD), photon strength functions (PSF), and neutron

transmission coefficients (NTC). Since these quantities
are adjusted to experiment close to β stability it is crucial
to find means to verify the predictions for very neutron-
rich nuclei.
The total absorption gamma-ray spectroscopy (TAGS)

technique aims at detecting cascades rather than individual
γ rays using large 4π scintillation detectors. The superiority
of this method over high-resolution germanium spectros-
copy to locate missing β intensity has been demonstrated
before [16,17]. However, its application in the present case
is very challenging, since the expected γ branching is very
small and located at rather high excitation energies. As a
matter of fact, previous attempts at LNPI [7] with a similar
aim did not lead to clear conclusions. In this Letter we
propose and demonstrate for the first time the use of the
TAGS technique to study γ-ray emission above Sn in β-
delayed neutron emitters and extract accurate information
that can be used to improve (n; γ) cross section estimates far
from β stability.
Neutron capture and transmission reactions have been

extensively used [18] to determine neutron and γ widths (or
related strength functions). An inspection of Ref. [18]
shows that in general Γn is orders of magnitude larger than
Γγ. In the decay of 87Br, which is the best studied case
[1,19–21], a dozen states emitting single γ rays were
identified within 250 keV above Sn collecting about
0.5% of the decay intensity to be compared with a neutron
emission probability of 2.6%. The observation of such
relatively high γ-ray intensity was explained as being due to
a nuclear structure effect: some of the levels populated
can only decay by emission of neutrons with large orbital
angular momentum l, which is strongly hindered. In
addition it has been pointed out [22] that a sizable γ-ray
emission from neutron unbound states can be a manifes-
tation of Porter-Thomas statistical fluctuations in the
strength of individual transitions. The role and relative
importance of both mechanisms should be investigated.
We present here the results of measurements for three

known neutron emitters, 87Br [23], 88Br [24], and 94Rb
[25], using a newly developed TAGS spectrometer. The
results for 93Rb, also measured, will be presented later [26].
The measurements were performed at the IGISOL mass
separator [27] of the University of Jyväskylä. The isotopes
were produced by proton-induced fission of uranium and
the mass-separated beam was cleaned from isobaric con-
tamination using the JYFLTRAP Penning trap [28,29]. The
resulting beam was implanted at the center of the spec-
trometer onto a movable tape, which periodically removed
the activity to minimize daughter contamination. Behind
the tape was placed a 0.5 mm thick Si detector with a β-
detection efficiency of about 30%. The Valencia-Surrey
total absorption spectrometer Rocinante is a cylindrical 12-
fold segmented BaF2 detector with a length and external
diameter of 25 cm, and a longitudinal hole of 5 cm
diameter. The separation between crystals is provided by
a thin optical reflector. The total efficiency for detecting a

single γ ray is larger than 80%. The spectrometer has a
reduced neutron sensitivity in comparison to NaI(Tl)
detectors, a key feature in the present application. It also
allows the measurement of multiplicities, which helps in
the data analysis. In order to eliminate the detector intrinsic
background and the ambient background we use β-gated
TAGS spectra in the present analysis. Nevertheless, other
sources of spectrum contamination need to be characterized
accurately.
In the first place the decay descendant contamination

was computed using the GEANT4 simulation toolkit [30]. In
the case of the daughter decay we use an event generator
based on the well known decay level scheme [23–25]. The
calculated normalization factor was adjusted to provide the
best fit to the recorded spectrum. The measurement of 88Br
was accidentally contaminated by 94Y, the long-lived
granddaughter of 94Rb, and was treated in the same manner.
The case of the contamination due to the β-delayed neutron
branch is more challenging. The decay simulation must
include the correct β-neutron-γ energy sequence. Neutrons
interact with detector materials producing additional γ rays
through inelastic and capture processes. An event generator
was implemented that reproduces the known neutron
energy distribution, taken from Ref. [31], and the known
γ-ray intensity in the final nucleus, taken from Refs. [23–
25]. The event generator requires the β intensity distribu-
tion followed by neutron emission Iβn, which was obtained
from deconvolution of the neutron spectrum. Another issue
is whether the interaction of neutrons with the detector can
be simulated accurately. We have shown recently [32] that
this is indeed the case provided that GEANT4 is updated
with the newest neutron data libraries and the original
capture cascade generator is substituted by an improved
one. The normalization factor of the β-delayed neutron
decay contamination is fixed by the Pn value. Another
important source of spectrum distortion is the summing
pileup of events. If more than one event arrives within the
same analog to digital converter (ADC) event gate, a signal
with the wrong energy is stored in the spectrum. Apart from
the electronic pulse pileup effect for a single detectormodule
[33] one must consider the summing of signals from
different detector modules. A new Monte Carlo (MC)
procedure to calculate their combined contribution has been
developed. The procedure is based on the random super-
position of two stored events within the ADC gate length.
The normalization of the resulting summing-pileup spec-
trum is fixed by the event rate and the ADC gate length [33].
Several laboratory γ-ray sources were used to determine

the energy and resolution calibration of the spectrometer.
The highest calibration point was at 4.123 MeV. The
measured singles spectra also served to verify the accuracy
of the spectrometer response simulated with GEANT4. The
use of β-gated spectra in the analysis required additional
verifications of the simulation. Because of the existence of
an electronic threshold in the Si detector (100 keV) the β-
detection efficiency has a strong dependence on β-endpoint

energy up to about 2 MeV. This affects the region of interest
(see Fig. 1). To verify that the MC simulation reproduces
this energy dependence we use the information from a
separate experiment [34] measuring Pn values with the
neutron counter BEta deLayEd Neutron (BELEN) detector
and the same β detector. Several isotopes with different
neutron emission windows Qβ − Sn were measured, result-
ing in variations of the neutron-gated β efficiency as large
as 25%. GEANT4 simulations using the above mentioned
β-delayed neutron decay generator are able to reproduce
the isotope-dependent efficiency within better than 4%.
Figure 1 shows the β-gated TAGS spectrum measured

during the implantation of 88Br ions. Also shown is the
contribution of the daughter 88Kr decay, the neutron decay
branch populating 87Kr, the summing-pileup contribution,
and the accidental contamination of 94Y. About 30% of the
emitted neutrons produce a signal (light gray filled histo-
gram). Most of the signals, concentrated below 1 MeV, are
due to inelastic scattering. Only 1.5% of the neutrons
undergo capture depositing energy up to 10 MeV. Notice
the presence of net counts beyond the neutron separation
energy, which can only be attributed to the decay feeding
excited states above Sn, which deexcite by γ-ray emission.
In this region the major background contribution comes
from summing pileup, which is well reproduced by the
calculation as can be observed. Similar pictures were
obtained for the decay of 87Br and 94Rb.
The analysis of the β-gated spectra follows the method

developed by the Valencia group [35,36]. The intensity
distribution Iβγ is obtained by deconvolution of the TAGS
spectrum with the calculated spectrometer response to the
decay. The response to electromagnetic cascades is calcu-
lated from a set of branching ratios (BR) and the MC
calculated response to individual γ rays. Branching ratios
are taken from Refs. [23–25] for the low energy part of the
decay level scheme. The excitation energy range above the
last discrete level is treated as a continuum divided into

40 keV bins. Average BR for each bin are calculated from
NLD and PSF as prescribed by the Hauser-Feshbach
model. We use NLD from Ref. [37] as tabulated in the
RIPL-3 library [38]. The PSF are obtained from generalized
Lorentzian (E1) or Lorentzian (M1, E2) functions using the
parameters recommended in Ref. [38]. The electromagnetic
response is then convoluted with the simulated response to
the β continuum. The spin parity of some of the discrete
states at low excitation energy in the daughter nucleus is
uncertain. They are however required to calculate the BR
from the states in the continuum. The unknown spin
parities were varied and those values giving the best
reproduction of the spectrum were adopted. There is also
ambiguity in the spin parity of the parent nucleus, which
determines the spin parity of the levels populated in the
continuum. Here, we assume that allowed Gamow-Teller
selection rules apply. Our choices, 3=2− for 87Br, 1− for
88Br, and 3− for 94Rb, are also based on which values best
reproduce the spectrum.
As an example of the results of the analysis we show in

Fig. 2 the Iβγ intensity obtained for
88Br. The spectrum

reconstructed with this intensity distribution reproduces
well the measured spectrum (see Fig. 1). The analysis for
the other two isotopes shows similar quality in the
reproduction of the spectra. We also include in Fig. 2
the intensity obtained from high-resolution measurements
[24], showing a strong pandemonium effect. The pande-
monium effect is even stronger in the case of 94Rb and
somewhat less for 87Br. The complete Iβγ and its impact on
reactor decay heat [39] and antineutrino spectrum [40]
summation calculations will be discussed elsewhere [41].
Here, we concentrate on the portion of that intensity located
in the neutron unbound region. A sizable TAGS intensity
is observed above Sn extending well beyond the first
few hundred keV where the low neutron penetrability
makes γ-ray emission competitive. For comparison,
Fig. 2 also shows Iβn deduced from the neutron spectrum
[31] as explained above. The Iβγ above Sn adds up toP

Iβγ ¼ 1.6ð3Þ%, to be compared with the integrated Iβn

(or Pn) of 6.4(6)%. From the TAGS analysis for the other
two isotopes we find a

P
Iβγ of 3.5(5)% (

87Br) and 0.53
(16)% (94Rb) to be compared with Pn values of 2.60(4)%
and 10.18(24)%, respectively. In the case of 87Br we find 7
times more intensity than the high-resolution measurement
[21]. The uncertainty quoted on

P
Iβγ is dominated by

systematic uncertainties. We did a careful evaluation of
possible sources of systematic effects for each isotope. The
uncertainty coming from assumptions in the BR varies
from 1% to 5% (relative value) depending on the isotope.
The impact of the use of different deconvolution algorithms
[36] is in the range of 2% to 10%. The uncertainty in the
energy dependence of the β efficiency contributes with 4%.
The contribution of uncertainties in the width calibration
ranges from 2% to 6%. A major source of uncertainty
comes from the normalization of the background contri-
bution, which at the energies of interest is dominated by the
summing pileup. We estimated that reproduction of spectra
could accommodate at most a �15% variation from the
nominal value, which translates into uncertainties of 6% to
22%. The integral value

P
Iβγ is affected also by the

uncertainty in the integration range. The Sn value is known
to better than 8 keV for all three isotopes and we estimate
that the energy calibration in this region is correct to about
one energy bin. This represents an additional uncertainty
ranging from 11% to 15%.
Figure 3 shows the ratio Iβγ=ðIβγ þ IβnÞ in the range of

energies analyzed with TAGS for all three cases. This ratio
is identical to the average ratio hΓγ=ðΓγ þ ΓnÞi over all
levels populated in the decay. The shaded area around the
experimental value in Fig. 3 serves to indicate the sensi-
tivity of the TAGS results to background normalization as
indicated above. The average width ratio was calculated
using the Hauser-Feshbach model. The results for the three
spin-parity groups populated in Gamow-Teller decay are
shown. The values for the NLD and PSF used in these
calculations are the same as those used in the TAGS
analysis. The new ingredient needed is the NTC, which
are obtained from the optical model (OM) with the TALYS-
1.4 software package [42]. OM parameters are taken from
the so-called local parametrization of Ref. [43]. Neutron
transmission is calculated for known final levels populated
in the decay [23–25]. In order to compute the average width
ratio we need to include the effect of statistical fluctuations
in the individual widths [22]. We use the MC method to
obtain the average of width ratios. The sampling procedure
is analogous to that described in Ref. [35]. Level energies
for each spin parity are generated according to a Wigner
distribution and their corresponding Γγ and Γn to individual
final states are sampled from Porter-Thomas distributions.
The total γ and neutron widths are obtained by summation
over all possible final states and the ratio is computed.
The ratio is averaged for all levels lying within each energy
bin. In order to suppress fluctuations in the calculated
average, the sampling procedure is repeated between 5 and
1000 times depending on level density. Very large average

enhancement factors were obtained, reaching 2 orders of
magnitude when the neutron emission is dominated by the
transition to a single final state.
In the case of 87Br 3=2− decay one can see in Fig. 3 that

the strong γ-ray emission above Sn can be explained as a
consequence of the large hindrance of l ¼ 3 neutron
emission from 5=2− states in 87Kr to the 0þ ground state
of 86Kr, as pointed out in Ref. [1]. In the case of 88Br 1−

decay a similar situation occurs for 0− states in 88Kr below
the first excited state in 87Kr at 532 keV, which require
l ¼ 3 to populate the 5=2þ ground state in 87Kr. For a more
quantitative assessment one should know the distribution of
β intensity between the three spin groups, which could be
obtained from β-strength theoretical calculations. The case
of 94Rb 3− decay is the most interesting. The final nucleus
93Sr is five neutrons away from β stability. The γ intensity
although strongly reduced, only 5% of the neutron inten-
sity, is detectable up to 1.5 MeV beyond Sn. The structure
observed in the average width ratio is associated with the
opening of βn channels to different excited states. Note that
the structure is reproduced by the calculation, which
confirms the energy calibration at high excitation energies.

In any case the calculated average γ-to-total ratio is well
below the experiment. In order to bring the calculation to
the experimental value one would need to enhance the PSF,
or suppress the NTC, or any suitable combination of the
two, by a very large factor. For instance, we verified that a
20-fold increase of the E1 PSF would reproduce the
measurement assuming a β-intensity spin distribution
proportional to 2J þ 1. An enhancement of such magnitude
for neutron-rich nuclei, leading to a similar enhancement
of (n; γ) cross sections, will likely have an impact on
r-process abundance calculations. Therefore, it will be
important to investigate the magnitude of possible varia-
tions of the NTC.
In conclusion, we have confirmed the suitability of the

TAGS technique to obtain accurate information on γ-ray
emission from neutron unbound states and have applied it to
three known β-delayed neutron emitters. A surprisingly
large γ-ray branching of 57% and 20% was observed for
87Br and 88Br, respectively, which can be explained as a
nuclear structure effect. In the case of 87Br we observe 7
times more intensity than previously detected with high
resolution γ-ray spectroscopy, which confirms the need of
the TAGS technique for such studies. In the case of the more
neutron-rich 94Rb the measured branching is only 4.5%
but still much larger than the results of Hauser-Feshbach
statistical calculations, after proper correction for individual
width fluctuations. The large difference between experiment
and calculation can be reconciled by an enhancement of
standard PSF of over 1 order of magnitude. To draw more
general conclusions it will be necessary to extend this type of
study to other neutron-rich β-delayed neutron emitters. Such
measurements using the TAGS technique are already under-
way and additional ones are planned.
