Abstract  
The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis describes the production of the lightest 
nuclides from deuterium to Li at the early stages of the Universe. While a 
general good agreement is found for most of the isotopes involved in the 
synthesis, a serious discrepancy between the predicted abundance of 7Li and 
the related experimental observations is still present. This discrepancy has 
been referred since several decades as Cosmological Lithium Problem. In one 
last attempt to find nuclear solutions to this longstanding conundrum, the 
7Be(n,α)4He and 7Be(n,p)7Li reactions, that affect predominantly  the 
production of  7Li via the destruction of his parent nucleus 7Be, have been 
studied. Here we present the 7Be(n,α)4He  and 7Be(n,p)7Li  reaction cross-
section measurements performed at the high-resolution n_TOF facility using 
the time-of-flight technique and high purity samples. The result of the 
experiments definitely rules out neutron induced reactions as a solution to the 
puzzle, thus indicating that explanations have to be sought out in other Physics 
scenarios. 

1 Cosmological Lithium Problem and Nuclear Physics 
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is one of the cornerstones for Big Bang Theory and at the same time 
it represents one of the few reliable links to the first seconds of the Universe having consequences 
directly observable nowadays. BBN theory yields precise predictions for the abundancies of primeval 
light elements and since its first formulation and following developments [1-2] it has been based on the 
firmly established physics background of Standard Model. While the predictions of BBN for D and 4He 
are in agreement with the primordial abundancies inferred by experimental observations at high red-
shift or in metal poor stars [3], a serious discrepancy is observed for 7Li, where a mismatch of a factor 
from two to three is observed between predictions. This discrepancy is now referred to as the 
Cosmological Lithium Problem (CLiP).  In order to solve this longstanding puzzle, a plethora of 



261 
 

solutions has been put forward, ranging from solutions in the fields of Astrophysics, Nuclear Physics, 
non Standard Cosmology and new physics beyond Standard Model. 

In standard BBN, the nuclear reactions chain begins when the temperature in the Universe has dropped 
down below 1 MeV allowing to reach the equilibrium between protons and neutrons. Subsequently, with 
temperature continuously decreasing, 16 well established  main reactions drive the formation of stable 
light nuclei up to mass number A=8.  In this scenario, 97% of 7Li is produced via electron capture beta 
decay of primordial 7Be (t1/2=52.3d), consequently the abundance of 7Li is intrinsically determined by 
the production and destruction of his father nucleus 7Be. As a matter of fact a nuclear solution to the 
Cosmological Lithium Problem is related to this isotope. 7Be is produced essentially via 3He(α,γ)7Be 
reaction that has been extensively studied and is accurately known [4-5], leaving no room for possible 
modifications in thermonuclear rate for 7Be production. On the other hand, while charged particle 
induced reactions responsible for 7Be destruction have been measured and the related significant 
contributions have been ruled out [6-9], data on reactions induced by neutrons have been so far scarce 
and incomplete, affecting the reliability of BBN calculations at the energy window of interest for the 
CLiP, i.e. 20-120 keV (or equivalently 0.23 T9 - 1.4 T9).  

According to BBN theory 7Be is destroyed via (n,α) and (n,p) channels, accounting respectively for 
2.5% and 97% to its destruction rate. The lack of experimental data for these reactions is essentially due 
to the intrinsic difficulty of the measurement, related to the extremely high specific activity of 7Be (13 
GBq/μg). Concerning 7Be(n,α)4He reaction, only one direct measurement performed at thermal energy 
(0.025 eV) was available in literature [10]. Therefore in BBN calculations data have been extrapolated 
to the relevant energy window assuming typically an uncertainty of a factor 10. On the other hand, 
previous data for 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction cross-section  extend on a wider range, from thermal energy up to 
13.5 keV [11], leaving nevertheless the BBN energy window uncovered.  

 

2 n_TOF program on Cosmological Lithium Problem 
In order to address this lack of data, the time-of-flight measurements of the 7Be(n,α)4He and 7Be(n,p)7Li 
reaction cross-sections have been performed at the newly built second experimental area (EAR2) of the 
n_TOF facility at CERN. The main features of the n_TOF neutron beam at the EAR2 measurement 
station are the wide neutron energy spectrum, spanning from 2 meV to 100 MeV, the high intensity of 
>107 neutrons/pulse at the sample position, the low repetition rate, of less than 0.8 Hz, and the good 
energy resolution (10-3≤ΔE/E≤10-2 in the energy range of interest for these measurements) [12]. All 
these features make EAR2 ideal for measurements on isotopes only available in very small amounts, 
with short half-lives, or both, as is the case for 7Be.  

2.1 The 7Be(n,α)4He cross-section measurement and its implication for CLiP 
The measurement of 7Be(n,α) 4He cross-section has been performed by means of a detection system 
capable of detecting in coincidence the two alpha particles emitted back-to-back in the reaction, whose 
Q-value is about 19 MeV. The detection system used consisted of two sandwiches of 140 μm thickness 
and 3x3 cm2 active area silicon detectors placed directly in the neutron beam. Each sandwich of silicons 
hosted in the middle part a sample with the 7Be deposit, providing a high coverage of solid angle [14]. 
The samples were produced by means of two different techniques, namely molecular plating and 
vaporization, at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) [13]: starting from a solution of Be(NO3)2, a total amount 
of ~40 GBq of 7Be was deposited on two thin backings, respectively 5 μm aluminum and 0.6 μm 
stretched polyethilene foil. Such thin backings permitted the high-energy alpha particles emitted in the 
reaction to reach the active area. The combination of the coincidence and time-of-flight techniques 
allowed to distinguish clearly the α-particles from the background due to the high activity of the samples 



262 
 

and to competing reactions, as shown in Fig. 1 where coincidences matrices for correlated detectors (i.e. 
detectors hosting the 7Be samples) and uncorrelated ones are reported.     

 

 
Fig. 1: Scatter plot for signal amplitudes in all possible pairs of detectors of the stack. Top left and 

bottom right plot refer to pairs hosting the 7Be sample, while the remaining panels show 
coincidence events for uncorrelated pairs of detectors 

The cross-section of the 7Be(n,α)4He reaction has been then determined in the energy range from 10 
meV to 10 keV and while at thermal energy it has been found in agreement with the previous 
measurement, it has indicated that at higher energy a substantial revision is needed. The  n_TOF  results 
combined with ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation lead to a change of the 7Be destruction rate due do this 
reaction, hinting nevertheless to a minor role of this channel in BBN and leaving therefore Cosmological 
Lithium Problem unsolved [15]. At a later time a second independent measurement performed at the 
Osaka Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) confirmed this conclusion, finally ruling out the 
possibility that the so far poorly known 7Be(n,α)4He channel could account for a significant 7Be 
depletion [16]. 

 

2.2 The 7Be(n,p)7Li cross-section measurement and its implication for CLiP 
The 7Be(n,p)7Li  reaction is featured by a relatively small Q-value, equal to 1.64 MeV, with low energy 
protons emitted with about 1.02 MeV and 1.40 MeV, according to the state in which the residual 7Li  
nucleus is left. Therefore, together with the availability of a sufficiently intense neutron beam, also 
strong constraints on the level of purity of the sample are set. The combination of the measurement 
capabilities on the n_TOF and ISOLDE [17] facilities at CERN allowed to perform the accurate 
measurement of the 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction cross-section from 0.025 eV to 325 keV neutron energy, hence 
fully covering for the first time in a direct measurement the energy range of interest for Big Bang 
Nucleosynthesis. In particular, a high purity 7Be sample was produced by ISOL technique at ISOLDE 
and shortly after exposed to the pulsed wide spectrum neutron beam at the n_TOF facility. The 7Be 
target preparation was carried out in two steps: 200 GBq of 7Be were extracted from the cooling water 
of the SINQ spallation source at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) [18] and deposited onto a suitable 
support in the form of a 7Be (NO3)2 colloid [19]. Afterward the solution was used to produce at ISOLDE 



263 
 

a 7Be beam that was implanted on a thin aluminium backing, resulting in a 1.1 GBq activity sample with 
a purity of about 99% (the remaining 1% was due to 7Li contamination) [18]. 

 

At n_TOF the measurement of the 7Be(n,p)7Li cross-section relied on the detection and identification by 
means of a silicon telescope of the protons emitted in the reaction. The telescope consisted of two silicon 
strip detectors of 300 µm and 20 µm thickness and 5x5 cm2 wide active area divided in 16+16 strips. 
Thanks to the high purity of the sample and the telescope technique, in combination with the time-of-
flight measurement at the high intensity pulsed neutron beam, the contributions of any source of 
background associated to the activity of the sample or to reactions induced on the sample backing could 
be heavily suppressed [19]. The n_TOF results of this measurement show that 7Be(n,p)7Li cross-section 
is higher than previously recognized at low energy, by ∼40%, but consistent with current evaluations 
above 50 keV [20].  

This new result, in combination with the n_TOF result on the 7Be(n,α)4He cross-section, has been used 
to calculate new BBN reaction rates and it has been found that it leads to, at most, a 10% decrease in the 
lithium production relative to previous estimations. Such a change does not have a significant impact on 
the Cosmological Lithium Problem, left therefore still unsolved. 

3 Conclusions 
The Cosmological Lithium Problem is one of the most important unresolved problems in Nuclear 
Astrophysics. The large discrepancy between the abundance of primordial 7Li predicted by the standard 
theory of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the value deduced from the observation of galactic halo dwarf 
stars. A few neutron-induced reactions are important in the processes leading to the formation of the 
first nuclides at the very beginning of our universe, amongst these, the (n,p) and (n,α) reactions on 7Be 
play a key role in the determination of the abundance of primordial lithium. Taking advantage of the 
new high intensity flux neutron beam line of the n_TOF facility at CERN the measurements of the 
7Be(n,α)4He and 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction cross-sections have been performed, in order to provide for the 
first time data in the neutron energy range of interest for Nuclear Astrophysics. The two n_TOF 
measurements finally rule out neutron-induced reactions, and possibly nuclear physics, as a potential 
explanation of the CLiP, leaving all alternative physics and astronomical scenarios still open.
