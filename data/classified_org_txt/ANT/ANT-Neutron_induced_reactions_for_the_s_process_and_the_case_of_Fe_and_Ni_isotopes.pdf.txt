Neutron capture cross sections are the key nuclear physics input to understand nucleosynthesis of
the slow neutron capture process (s process). At the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN
neutron capture cross sections of astrophysical interest are measured over a wide energy range.
A measurement campaign to determine the stellar (n,γ) cross sections of Fe and Ni isotopes is
currently being pursued. First results on the stellar cross section of 62Ni(n,γ) confirm previous
experimental results. The cross section of the radioactive s-process branching 63Ni was measured
for the first time at stellar energies and is about a factor of 2 higher than theoretical predictions.
Future facilities and upgrades will allow to access a number of other radioactive nuclides which
are crucial for understanding physical conditions of s-process environments.

Neutron induced reactions for the s process C. Lederer

1. The s process and the Fe/Ni mass region

The slow neutron capture process (s process) is responsible for forming about half of the el-
emental abundances between Fe and Bi. The s process takes place in stellar environments with
relatively small neutron densities of 106 − 1012 cm−3, therefore, the reaction path proceeds via
neutron captures and subsequent β -decays along the valley of stability on the nuclear chart. Two
different components are attributed to the s process, the weak component taking place in massive
stars (>13 M�) which dominantly produces elements between Fe and Zr, and the main component
taking place in thermally pulsing AGB stars (1− 5 M�), responsible for producing elements be-
tween Zr and Bi ([1], and references therein).
The key nuclear physics input for calculating s-process abundances are Maxwellian Averaged (n,γ)
cross sections (MACS), that is the energy dependent neutron capture cross section averaged over
the stellar neutron spectrum. Since the s process happens during different burning stages in stellar
evolution, stellar cross sections need to be determined for Maxwell Boltzmann distributions cor-
responding to different temperatures, i.e. kT values between 5 and 90 keV. For calculating the
s-abundance distribution a complete set of MACSs of isotopes between Fe and Bi is required. Ac-
curate MACSs are specifically important for weak s process abundances where neutron exposures
are low and the (n,γ) cross sections of a single isotope affects the abundances of all other isotopes
following in the reaction chain [2].

Figure 1: Path of the weak s process during He core burning (yellow) and C Shell burning (red) in massive
stars.

As mentioned before, a large fraction of nuclides in the Fe/Ni mass region is produced by the
weak s process. The weak s process occurs during two burning stages of massive star evolution,
first at the end of He Core burning, and subsequently during C Shell burning. Figure 1 shows an
excerpt of the chart of nuclides from Fe to Zn. The yellow line illustrates the s-process nucleosyn-
thesis that takes place during He Core burning, when temperatures are high enough to activate the

neutron source 22Ne(α,n). Neutron densities reach around 106 cm−3 and temperatures correspond
to kT = 26 keV. Neutron densities are not high enough to provide a sufficient neutron capture rate
on radioactive nuclides. The very same neutron source 22Ne(α,n) is later reactivated during C
Shell burning at temperatures of kT = 90 keV. This time, neutron densities are magnitudes higher
with peak densities of 1012 cm−3, resulting in a reaction flow up to 3 units away from the stability
valley as indicated by the red line in Figure 1. When 63Ni is produced, the main reaction flow
proceeds now via subsequent neutron capture to 64Ni, bypassing the production of 63Cu. All 63Cu
abundance produced in this second stage stems from radioactive decay of the 63Ni left after C Shell
burning and therefore, strongly depends on the 63Ni(n,γ) cross section [3].

Up to now, cross sections for the reaction 63Ni(n,γ) were measured only at thermal neutron
energies (0.025 eV) [4, 5, 6]. Hence, calculations of s process abundances rely on theoretical
predictions of the cross section at stellar neutron energies. Theoretical estimates for the MACS
at kT = 30 keV are ranging from 24 to 54 mb [7, 8, 9, 13, 14]. The recommended value by
KADoNiS-v0.3, the most recent compilation of (n,γ) MACSs, is 31±6 mb [11].

2. The time-of-flight technique

A method for determining stellar cross sections for a large range of kT values is the time-
of-flight technique. Neutron captures are measured by detecting the prompt γ-ray emission of the
excited compound nucleus. The energy of the neutron is determined by its time of flight, i.e. the
time from its creation to the time of the capture reaction. Neutrons with energies over several orders
of magnitude can be produced very efficiently by spallation or photofission reactions. Apart from
that, the 7Li(p,n) reaction is well suited for measuring stellar cross sections due to its high neutron
yield in the keV region. Currently, (n,γ) cross sections for astrophysics are measured at several
time-of-flight facilities, e.g. the DANCE setup of Los Alamos National Laboraty, GELINA at the
Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements in Geel, and the n_TOF facility at CERN. This
paper will concentrate on (n,γ) measurements for astrophysics which were performed at n_TOF.

The neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF located at CERN follows an extensive program for
measuring astrophysically relevant neutron capture cross sections [12]. Neutrons are produced via
spallation reactions of a highly energetic proton beam (FWHM=7 ns, Ep=20 GeV) impinging on a
massive Pb target. The target is surrounded by a water circuit for cooling and for moderating the
initially highly energetic neutrons. The resulting neutron spectrum ranges from thermal (0.025 eV)
up to several GeV of neutron energy. A very good energy resolution is obtained due to a long
flight path of 185 m while maintaining a high instantaneous neutron flux, since ≈ 1015 neutrons are
produced by each proton pulse. For measuring (n,γ) cross sections, two different detection systems
are installed, an array of BaF2 crystals in 4π geometry (Total Absorption Calorimeter), and a pair
of liquid scintillation detectors filled with deuterated benzene (C6D6). The C6D6 detectors are in-
house fabricated and have been optimized for a very low neutron sensitivity [10]. Therefore, they
are ideal for studying nuclides, where the elastic cross section is orders of magnitude higher than
the capture cross section.

3. Neutron capture measurements on Fe/Ni isotopes at n_TOF

In 2009, a campaign started to measure the (n,γ) cross sections of all stable Fe and Ni isotopes,
and additionally the (n,γ) cross section of the long-lived radionuclide 63Ni at n_TOF [15, 16]. Data
taking for 54,56,57Fe and 58,62,63Ni is finished and the data analysis is underway. To avoid back-
ground from (n,γ) reactions on impurities, highly enriched samples were used (between 96.06%
and 99.77% for the stable isotopes). The 63Ni sample was produced by irradiation of a highly en-
riched 62Ni sample in a thermal reactor [6, 17, 18], yielding a 63Ni/62Ni ratio of 0.123. All samples
had cylindrical shape with a diameter of 2 cm. The neutron capture cross sections were measured
using the C6D6 detectors, since in the mass region around Fe neutron scattering cross sections are
in general much higher than neutron capture cross sections. The neutron flux was measured using
reactions with well known cross sections: 6Li(n,α) and 10B(n,α) up to 150 keV and above that
energy 235U(n, f ). Since the sample is usually smaller than the neutron beam, the fraction of the
beam intercepted by the sample was determined with the saturated resonance technique [19]: A
Au sample of the same size as the investigated samples was measured. Its thickness was chosen
such, that the resonance at 4.9 eV absorbs all incoming neutrons (the resonance is saturated). Since
neutron capture for this resonance is much more likely than neutron scattering, the neutron cap-
ture yield can be approximated as being unity, and thus, that value gives a measure of the absolute
neutron flux at the resonance energy. The background independent of the sample was measured in
runs with an empty sample holder in the beam. The background coming from the radioactivity of
the 63Ni sample was measured in runs without neutron beam.

4. First Results and astrophysical implications

The resonances observed in the neutron capture cross section are fitted using the R-matrix
code SAMMY [20]. The resonance parameters obtained in this way can then be used to calculate
the Maxwellian Averaged Cross section over a wide range of kT values. The MACS of 62Ni(n,γ)
has been determined from kT = 5− 100 keV. There is a good agreement with most previous ex-
perimental values at kT = 30 keV, as well as with the MACS at kT = 30 keV recommended by the
KADoNiS-v0.3 compilation [11]. The n_TOF MACS at higher kT values (kT > 60 keV) become
systematically smaller, indicating a different energy dependence of the neutron capture cross sec-
tion than adopted in KADoNiS-v0.3. Therefore, our new results might have an important impact
on abundance calculations concerning the C Shell burning phase, where the neutron energy distri-
bution has its maximum at kT = 90 keV.
The 62Ni(n,γ) capture yield measured at n_TOF could furthermore be used to subtract the back-
ground in the 63Ni(n,γ) data, which represents the dominant impurity of the 63Ni sample. The
MACS for the reaction 63Ni(n,γ) was determined from kT = 5−100 keV and is about a factor of 2
higher than the currently recommended value in KADoNiS-v0.3. We investigated the impact of the
new cross section with a full stellar model for a 25 M� star. The abundance distribution after He
Core and C Shell burning was calculated for the n_TOF results and compared to the abundances
using the MACS of the KADoNiS-v0.3 compilation. The overall abundance distribution shows
only a small sensitivity (few percent change) to the change in cross section. However, significantly
affected are some species in direct vicinity of 63Ni, i.e. 63Cu, 64Ni and 64Zn. While the 64Ni abun-

dance is enhanced by about 20% relative to using the KADoNiS-v0.3 cross section, 63Cu and 64Zn
are depleted, changing the 63Cu/65Cu ratio of the s-process abundances. Since the 65Cu abundance
is not affected by this cross section change, a smaller absolute Cu abundance is expected to be syn-
thesized using the new cross section. This is especially of interest, since current models attribute
only 30% of the solar Cu abundance to processes other than the weak s process [3].
How efficient the s process products enrich the interstellar medium still needs to be further inves-
tigated. The final abundance distribution ejected into the interstellar medium can be affected by
later burning phases (e.g. a possible merging of shells on the last day prior to the supernova [2])
and during the Supernova explosion itself by explosive nucleosynthesis [21]. Our results provide
an important constraint to link the observed abundances in this mass region to the weak s process
distribution in stellar models.

5. Future opportunities

As mentioned in the introduction, a complete set of MACS from Fe to Bi is required for cal-
culating s process abundances. Furthermore, for understanding physical conditions in s-process
environments and the s-abundance distribution, neutron capture on radioactive nuclei plays a key
role as illustrated for the example of 63Ni(n,γ). Some relevant nuclides for the s process (e.g.
85Kr(n,γ), 79Se(n,γ) etc.) however, cannot be accessed by direct (n,γ) measurements at current
facilities yet. Usually the sample mass available is too small, and thus a higher neutron flux for ob-
taining sufficient statistics is required. Additionally, some neutron induced reactions (e.g. neutron
poisons in the s process like 12C or 16O) are challenging due to their very small cross sections (up
to 100-1000 times smaller than for typical s-process nuclei). Apart from s process studies, neutron
induced cross sections are also important for understanding observations of live radionuclides in
the cosmos, e.g. 26Al, where neutron induced reactions are the dominant destruction mechanism
[24].
In recent years, several new projects were developed for building highly intense neutron sources
for astrophysical measurements, e.g. SARAF at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center [22] or the
Frankfurt Neutron Source of Stern-Gerlach Zentrum FRANZ at the Goethe University of Frankfurt
[23]. Both facilities will generate a highly intense neutron flux in the keV region via the reaction
7Li(p,n) (FRANZ is expected to provide the highest neutron flux in the keV region world-wide).
Also at n_TOF the construction of a second experimental area is planned (EAR-2), with a distance
of only 20 m from the neutron spallation target [25]. EAR-2 will provide a neutron flux which is
about a factor of 25 higher than the flux at the longer n_TOF flight path of 185 m.
These upgrades and new facilities will provide opportunities for measurements on currently inac-
cessible isotopes and will allow to calculate s abundances with improved accuracy. Such infor-
mation is not only crucial for studying the s process itself, but also to give constraints on other
nucleosynthesis processes, like the rapid neutron capture process where stellar sites are yet un-
known.
