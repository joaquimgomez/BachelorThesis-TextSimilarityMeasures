In the framework of the nodalization qualification process and quality guarantee procedures and following the guidelines of
Kv-scaled analysis and UMAE methodology, further development has been performed by UPC team resulting in a scaling-up
methodology. Such methodology has been applied in this paper for analyzing discrepancies that appear between the simulations
of two counterpart tests. It allows the analysis of scaling-down criterion used for the design of an ITF and also the investigation
of the differences of configuration between an ITF and a particular NPP. For analyzing both, it applies two concepts ‚Äúscaled-up
nodalizations‚Äù and ‚Äúhybrid nodalizations.‚Äù The result of this activity is the explanation of appeared distortions and its final goal
is to qualify nodalizations for their use in the analysis of equivalent scenarios at an NPP scale. In this sense, the experimental
data obtained in the OECD/NEA PKL-2 and ROSA-2 projects as counterpart test are of a great value for the testing of the
present methodology. The results of the posttest calculations of LSTF-PKL counterpart tests have allowed the analyst to define
which phenomena could be well reproduced by their nodalizations and which not, in this way establishing the basis for a future
extrapolation to an NPP scaled calculation. The application of the UPC scaling up methodology has demonstrated that selected
phenomena can be scaled-up and explained between counterpart simulations by carefully considering the differences in scale and
design.

1. Introduction

Computational analyses of full-scale nuclear power plants
(NPP) have a wide and consolidated application on nuclear
engineering. Most of the uses of NPP nodalizations, related
to the support to plant operation and control, have been
extensively described in two different safety reports [1, 2] by
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [1, 2]. The
first one [1] is specifically devoted to detail the guidelines for
the development of power plant nodalizations by the use of
system codes. During the last 20 years, the Technical Univer-
sity of Catalonia (UPC) has completed several works in this
field following similar strategies as in [1]. The description of
some of these contributions can be found in [3‚Äì7] which deal
with the development and usage of NPP nodalizations in the
support to plant operation and control. This experience has
shown the usefulness and possibilities of this approach. One
of the major outcomes is that the continuous development

and improvement of NPP nodalizations are not only a
requirement but also a difficult task due to the large amount
of information contained in a full NPP nodalization. In that
sense, methodologies designed to qualify NPP nodalizations
take a key role and can be used to both provide an insight
in the quality of the produced analyses and, in addition, help
the developer in the detection of possible deficiencies in the
nodalization.

In a related paper [8], the UPC scaling-up methodology
was presented as a tool to contribute to qualifyingNPPnodal-
izations. The UPC scaling-up methodology is a systematic
procedure for qualifyingNPP nodalizations taking advantage
of the experience acquired through the posttest analysis of
integral test facility (ITF) experiments. It is devoted to the
nodalization qualification, which implies that the methodol-
ogy can only be applied to those phenomena that have been
well reproduced on ITF posttest analyses; and that the scal-
ing analyses are only performed through code simulations.

The two main factors that affect the scaling-up of the ITF
posttest simulations are the scaling-down criterion used for
the design of the ITF and the differences of configuration
between the ITF and the NPP. For analyzing both, the UPC
scaling-up methodology applies two concepts, ‚Äúscaled-up
nodalizations‚Äù and ‚ÄúHybrid nodalizations.‚Äù The so called
‚Äúscaled-up nodalizations‚Äù can be used to analyze the effect
of the ITF scaling criterion in a scaled-up calculation. On
the other hand, the ‚Äúhybrid nodalizations‚Äù are defined as
modified scaled-up ITF nodalizations in which some com-
ponents have been adjusted to resemble the configuration of
the NPP system.The aim of these nodalizations is to evaluate
the influence of each aspect of the configuration on the ITF
simulation results independently of the scale. A diagram
associated with the ‚ÄúUPC scaling-up methodology‚Äù is shown
in Figure 1, and further details on each step can be found in
[8].

In the present work, the UPC scaling-up methodology
is applied in order to check its capabilities for justifying
and detecting the discrepancies that may appear between
counterpart simulations performed with different nodaliza-
tions at different scales. For this purpose, the experiments
performed within the framework of the OECD/NEA ROSA-
2 and PKL-2 projects are used. These two projects are
related to experiments at the two correspondent ITFs: the
PrimaÃàrkreislauf (PKL) test facility [9] operated by AREVA
and the Large-Scale Test Facility (LSTF) [10] operated by
the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA). During 2011, a
link was established between the two projects in order to
perform a counterpart experiment with the two facilities.The
objective of the counterpart test was to represent the same
accident conditions with two different scaling criteria and at
different local geometries in order to evaluate their effect on
the evolution of the transient. In this work, the ROSA-2 Test

3 and the PKL-2 Test G7.1 (also known as counterpart tests)
will be simulated, qualified, and analyzed applying design
effect analyses and scale effect analyses which are part of this
particular methodology (see Figure 1).

2. Facilities and Test Description

2.1. LSTF. LSTF is an experimental facility operated by
JAEA; it is designed to simulate a Westinghouse-type 4-loop
3,420MWth PWR under emergency conditions. It is a full-
height and 1/48 volumetrically-scaled two-loop system with
a maximum core power of 10MW (14% of the scaled PWR
nominal core power) andpressures scaled 1 : 1. Loops are sized
to conserve volumetric factor (2/48) and to simulate the same
flow regime transitions in the horizontal legs (preserving
ùêø/‚àöùê∑ factor).

There is one SG for each loop respecting the same scaling
factors.They have 141 full-size U-tubes, inlet and outlet plena,
steam separator, steam dome, steam dryer, main steam line,
four downcomers, and other internals.

All emergency systems are represented and have a big
versatility referred to their functions and positions. Many
break locations (a total of 20) are available too.

LSTF test facility has about 1,760 measurement points
that allow an exhaustive analysis of the tests. There are two
types of data or measurements of interest: directly measured
quantities (temperature, pressure, and differential pressure)
and derived quantities (from the combination of two or more
direct measured quantities: coolant density, mass flow rate
etc.).

2.2. PKL. PKL is an ITF which reproduces the entire primary
system and most of the secondary system (except for the
turbine and condenser) of a 1300MW PWR plant operated
by AREVA. It is based on a four-loop Siemens design (KWU),
with elevations scaled 1 : 1 and volumes and power reduced by
a factor of 145. The number of rods in the core and the U-
tubes in the steam generator has been divided by 145 as well
following the power-to-volume scaling criterion. The core
has been modeled by 314 electrical heater rods. Unlike many
experimental facilities with only two available loops (one for
the broken loop and one to simulate the other three intact
loops) PKL simulates all four loops separately. This is very
important in order to analyze asymmetrical transients, for
example, with injection in two out of four loops.

The operating pressure of the PKL facility is limited to 45
bars on the primary side and to 56 bars on the secondary side.
This allows simulation over a wide temperature range (522K
to 322K) that is particularly applicable to the cooldown
procedures investigated, although it limits the simulation of
the high-pressure phases of some events, for instance, the
initial phase of an SBLOCA.

All emergency systems are represented and have a wide
versatility referred to their functions and positions.Thepump
injection system is available in all the hot and cold legs. Many
break locations are available too.

PKL test facility has about 1500 measurement points
that permit an exhaustive analysis of the tests. Sixty of

the measurement devices are identical to those that are used
in a commercial plant to simulate what an operator would

Major features of both power-to-volume scaled-down
facilities are detailed in Table 1.

2.3. PKL-2 and LSTF-2 Counterpart Test. In 2011, a counter-
part test was performed in LSTF and PKL test facilities as a
part of the OECD/NEA ROSA-2 and PKL-2 projects (test 3
and test G7.1, resp.). The objective of both tests was devoted
to analyze two aspects:

(i) core exit temperature (CET) measurement effective-
ness in accident management (AM) of NPPs;

(ii) scaling effects between PKL and LSTF test facilities.

The selected scenario was an upward oriented 1.5% hot
leg SBLOCA. System failures as no high-pressure safety
injection and no automatic secondary-side safety cooldown
were imposed.The particular test conditions are described in
the sections below.

2.3.1. ROSA-2 Test 3 Test Conditions. This test was divided
into three phases, a high-pressure phase, reproducing the
NPP scenario at full pressure; a low-pressure phase, repro-
ducing the same scenario at counterpart conditions with
PKL; and finally, an intermediate phase, with the purpose
of conditioning the LSTF conditions at the end of the high-
pressure phase to the PKL counterpart test conditions. Table 2
shows the list of imposed conditions for each phase.

Several parameters were adjusted from the PKL test
conditionswith the aimof having analogous behaviors during
the low-pressure phase of the transient. A scaling factor
ùêæV = 2.55 was applied for calculating the opening area of

the SG‚Äôs relief valves, the water volumes of the accumulators,
and the injection rates of the low-pressure injection (LPI)
system. Pressures in the primary and secondary systems
were adjusted 1 : 1 to the PKL test conditions during the
conditioning phase, and the mass inventory was reinstated
in order to have a similar hot leg liquid level as expected
to occur in the PKL test. Reflux and condenser conditions
were established in both facilities at the beginning of the
counterpart phase. Accumulators‚Äô set point was reduced to
2.6MPa for including their actuation in both facilities.

2.3.2. PKL-2 G7.1 Test Conditions. The PKL initial conditions
were adjusted at itsmaximumpressures in order to reproduce
as realistic as it can PWR SBLOCA reflux and condensation,
core dryout, and accident management phases. The test
conditions were set identical as those of LSTF low-pressure
phase conditions (see Table 2).

In relation to scaling, themass inventory in the secondary
side was adjusted using ùêæV factor in order to have the same
ratio between liquid and energy storage in the SG‚Äôs. The
Core power was slightly increased above the ùêæV factor to
compensate the differences present between both facilities in
the external heat losses.

2.3.3. Experimental Results. The results of the counterpart
phases showed a close agreement for reproducing the main
phenomena expected for the transient. Both facilities repro-
duced similarly the three parts of the transient (reflux and
condensation, vapor superheating, and accident manage-
ment; see Figures 2 and 3) obtaining a wide spectrum of
experimental data for analyzing the relationship between
CET and PCT and the effectiveness of the CET signal for AM
actuations.

Some differences were detected between the results of
both facilities.

(i) Core dryout: there is a delay of 280 s in the core
dryout (see Figure 4) which modifies the timing of
next phases of the transients.

(ii) CET versus PCT curve: the relationship between the
CET and the PCT measurements shows different
slope when the CET starts to increase (see Figure 5).
Because of that, there is a discrepancy of 55K in the
PCT of both facilities when the condition of the AM
action is achieved (ùëáCET > 623K).

(iii) Effectiveness of the SG depressurization takes place
at a different rate in each facility. Figure 6 compares
PCTs of both tests for the interval in which SG
depressurization and accumulators‚Äô injection take
place. Results show that for PKL facility rewetting
cannot be assured without the entrance of the passive
ECCS system.

structures (core barrel and unheated rods) linked to the same
volumes.The fuel wasmodeled with threeHSs, with the same
power ratio, and divided into 7 axial levels.

UPC PKL pseudo-3D nodalization had the core and
upper plenum (until the CET thermocouple level) divided
into three radial channels (see Figure 7), with one fuel HS for
each channel. The HSs for the passive internal metal struc-
tures were split for each channel proportionally to the flow
path of each one, and the core barrel was linked to the outer
zone. The radial flow paths between cells were modeled and
transversal momentum equations were activated following
the recommendations of reference [15]. The total number of
core axial meshes was increased to 14 and the upper plenum
cell heights were adjusted so that the center of the node
coincided with the elevation of the thermocouples in the test
facility.

The obtained results showed a quite close agreement for
both nodalizations reproducing the initial conditions (see

Table 3) as well as the general behavior of the transient
(Figures 8 and 9 show a close agreement of both nodal-
izations for reproducing depressurization rate during three
reported phases of the transient: reflux and condensation,
vapor superheating, and SG depressurization). The pseudo-
3D nodalization provided closer results for the main events
because it reduced the delay in the core uncovery (see
Table 4). This was seen to be a consequence because of a
higher vapor generation in the 1D nodalization during the
phases of reflux and condensation and vapor superheating.
It implied that, for similar break mass losses, liquid mass
inventory decreased faster and core uncovery started before.
In Figure 10, the differences between vapor generation and
breakmass flows are compared (the differences are calculated
by subtracting the values of the pseudo-3D nodalization to
the 1D nodalization).

Finally, the UPC PKL pseudo-3D nodalization was qual-
ified for reproducing the relationship between the CET and
the PCT. This nodalization solved instabilities in the simula-
tion of the overheated CET (Figure 11), obtaining close results
in the CET versus PCT curve (Figure 12). The pseudo-3D
nodalization reproduced the same slope of the experimental
data as well as the initial increase of the PCT.

On the other hand, the pseudo-3D nodalization was not
qualified for reproducing closely the core quenching after SG
depressurization action. Despite, the fact that core refilling
was simulated, in the calculation quench front achieved the
top level of the active core before accumulators‚Äô injection,
showing a discrepancy in experimental results. In Figure 11,
each CET curve is associatedwith a vertical line that indicates
the time at which the accumulators‚Äô injection starts.The com-
parison shows that for both simulations, the temperatures
dropped before accumulators‚Äô injection, unlike experimental
data, in which it did not occur.

3.2. LSTF Test 3 Posttest Analysis. A base case calculation was
performed using the UPC LSTF RELAP5mod3.3 nodaliza-
tion that had been qualified previously for the ROSA Test

3.1 and ROSA Test 3.2 transients [16, 17]. The major features
of the vessel nodalization were core and fuel modeled with
one channel and one heat structure, respectively; fuel axial
core power calculated as an average of the low, medium, and
high experimental core power profiles; 9 fuel mesh points;
characterization of passive heat structures simulating control
rods, core barrel, upper core support plate, instrumentation,
and external heat losses.

Results showed a quite good agreement for reproducing
initial steady state conditions andmain events of three phases
of the transient (see Tables 5 and 6). There was a slight
overestimation of the break mass losses when stratification
appeared in the hot leg, so the break was in two-phase
discharging mode (see Figure 13 from 750 s to 1500 s). As a
result of this, core uncovery occurred slightly earlier for both
phases of the transient (see Table 6), and consequently, the SG
depressurization signal related with the CET was activated in
advance as well (see Table 6 and Figure 14). In any case, the
main parameters were consistently reproduced (see Figures
14, 15, and 16).

Focusing on the relation between the CET and the PCT,
results showed a disagreement in the slope of the plots
(see Figures 17 and 18). These results suggested that UPC

LSTF nodalization should be improved following a similar
approach as the one (pseudo-3D modeling) applied in the
PKL analysis.

In that sense, a UPC LSTF pseudo-3D nodalization
was implemented splitting the core in 13 channels with 18
axial levels (see Figure 19). The low, medium, and high core
power axial profiles were simulated, arranging them in each
channel as in the experimental radial power distribution.
Cartesian crossflows were used for organizing them radially
and transversalmomentum equations were activated in order
to take into account the possible radialŒîP‚Äôs. Passive HSs were
split according to the geometries. Finally, the upper plenum
was modified simulating it with two channels, one hot chan-
nel, connected to the outlet of the hottest core channel, and
another one simulating the rest of the plenum. Transversal
momentum equations were activated too in order to consider
ŒîP‚Äôs in the vessel that could affect flow path to the hottest
channel during the upper plenumHPI injection.On the other
hand, HPI mass flow was modified in the conditioning phase
in order to match primary mass inventory at the beginning
of the low-pressure phase. This correction was justified for
the analysis of the following counterpart phases in which the
achievement of specified initial conditions is necessary.

Results of theUPCLSTFpseudo-3Dnodalization showed
a close agreement in the simulation of the CET versus
PCT relationship (see Figures 17 and 18). For both high-
and low-pressure transient phases, pseudo-3D nodalization
reproduces the same slope and correlation with a margin of
50 and 70K, respectively, over AM signal established for this
particular scenario (ùëáCET > 623K). Regarding core uncovery,
the adjustment of initial mass inventory at the beginning
of the counterpart phase solves the delay (see low-pressure
transient phase of Table 6), obtaining a closer agreement in
the simulation of reflux condenser, vapor superheating, and
AM phases (see Figure 20).

Scaling and design effect analyses are two merged steps of
the UPC scaled-up methodology (see Figure 1) in which the
analyst can evaluate how the scale and the design modify the
results of an ITF simulation. Both steps must only be applied
for those phenomena that have been validated for at least
two facilities with different scale and design.The effectiveness

of these techniques has been checked taking advantage of
the posttest calculations described above. In that sense, PKL-
LSTF counterpart test becomes useful in that it relates two
facilities to different scale and design (see Table 1).

Once the posttest analyses are described, the experimen-
tal differences reported in Section 2.3.3 must be checked in
order to guarantee the validation of the related phenomena
in the simulation. The following can be concluded.

(i) CET versus PCT correlation discrepancies: UPC
LSTF and PKL nodalizations were qualified for sim-
ulating CET versus PCT correlation in that they
reproduce the phenomenon with close results (see
Figures 12, 17, and 18).

(ii) Core dryout delay: once initial mass inventory was
readjusted in the LSTF pseudo-3D nodalization for
the low-pressure transient phase, the results of both
simulations showed a quite good agreement in the
reproduction of the core uncovery (see Tables 4 and
6), reproducing qualitatively well the timing of the
three phases of the transient in each case. The same
criteria were applied in both nodalizations for the
modelling of the core (which affects vapor generation)

and the break (which affects primarymass inventory);
therefore, both simulations were qualified showing a
qualitative consistency with respect to experimental
data in at least two different facilities.

(iii) SG depressurization effectiveness: results of the PKL
simulation showed the inefficacy of UPC PKL nodal-
ization for reproducing the effect of the SG depressur-
ization in the CET (see Figure 11). For this case, PKL
nodalization is not qualified and no further analysis
can be done.

4.1. Scaling Effect Analysis. The aim of the scaling effect
analysis step is to generate an idealized ITF scaled-up nodal-
ization in which the effects of the scaling are minimized.
ITF posttest calculation must be scaled to the size of the
analyzed facility/NPP nodalization following the scaling
criteria applied in the design of the experimental facility. The
reported distortions of the scaling criteria must be studied in
order to evaluate how they modify the results and in order to
generate an idealized input deck without their effects. Only
in the case where the scaling effects have been removed, the
design effects can be analyzed.

In the case of the PKL and the LSTF experimental
facilities, the power-to-volume scaling method was followed
for their design. For this criterion, scaling distortions are
mainly related to changes in hydraulic diameter, which affects
the external heat losses, energy storage in passive structures,
friction effects, and flow regime transitions (formore detailed
information see the related paper [8]). For analyzing scal-
ing effects of the counterpart test, PVST software (general
description in paper [8]) has been applied to the validated
UPC PKL pseudo-3D nodalization.

As a first step, a nodalization (named Sc-up nodalization
A) has been generated using the PKL-LSTF ùêæV factor sug-
gested by the PKL and LSTF operator agents. This nodaliza-
tion follows the power-to-volume (PtoV) scaling criterion, so
that a PKL nodalization has been obtained with the same size
in power and in volume as of those of LSTF. The comparison

between Sc-up nodalization A and the UPC PKL pseudo-
3D nodalization shows discrepancies in the system pressures
during reflux condenser and vapor superheating phases (see
Figure 21) despite having similar mass discharged through
the break (see Figure 22: the slight discrepancy is because
primary pressures are not equal). The secondary pressure
is higher for Sc-up nodalization A, pushing up the coupled
primary pressure during reflux condenser phase.

In order to analyze this distortion, a newnodalization, Sc-
up nodalization B, is generated. This is a PKL PtoV scaled-
up nodalization (as Sc-up nodalization A) in which the heat
impact of external heat structures has been preserved. The

nodalization A and Sc-up nodalization B confirms that a
distortion should be expected in the system pressures as
a result of the reduction in the external heat losses (see
Figure 21). Because the external heat losses are reduced when
PtoV scale is increased, part of this energy is stored in the
isolated secondary system, increasing pressures during reflux
condenser phase.

Once the external heat losses distortion is corrected, a
discrepancy appears in the timing of the SG depressurization
signal (see Figure 21). Taking into account that the aim
of the scaling effect analysis is to generate an idealized
PKL scaled-up nodalization in which scaling effects are
minimized, another scaled-up nodalization must be gener-
ated following the previous nodalizations. Therefore, a third
nodalization Sc-up nodalization C is produced based on
Sc-up nodalization B but with the additional preservation
of the ùêø/‚àöùê∑ quotient in the hot legs. Keeping this ratio
in the horizontal legs, the Froude number and the flow
regime transitions should be preserved. The comparison
between the PKL posttest calculation and the results obtained
by Sc-up nodalizations B and C shows that the hot leg
liquid levels in the broken loop are preserved for Sc-up
nodalization C during the conditioning phase of the PKL
transient (see in Figure 23 from ‚àí4000 s to ‚àí3500 s and from
‚àí2750 s to ‚àí2500 s intervals), thus providing similar break
mass flow rates as in the posttest calculation (see Figure 24).
This allows keeping the same primary mass inventory ratio
at the beginning of the transient, obtaining similar liquid
levels in the hot leg of the broken loop (see Figure 25) and
similar break mass flow rates (see Figure 26). This good
performance of themass discharging removes the delay in the
core uncovery obtaining a close agreement in the timing of
the SG depressurization (see Figure 27).

After removing the Froude number distortion, the main
parameters of the transient are compared between UPC PKL

sures (Figure 27), CET temperatures (Figure 28), and PCT
temperatures (Figure 29) display a close agreement between
the posttest and Sc-up nodalizationC. Since the discrepancies
to be analyzed between PKL and LSTF simulations are the
core uncovery delay and the CET versus PCT correlation,
no further scaling effect analysis will be necessary. Friction
effects or hydraulic diameters in components where mixing
or interface drag occurs (i.e., SG and vessel downcomers)
could be studied until a perfect idealized scaled-up nodal-
ization is obtained, but as for this transient, they will not
add any relevant scaling effect in the reported LSTF-PKL
discrepancies, it would suppose an unnecessary extra work

4 loops into 2 loops, and adjusting the hot leg geometries
in order to preserve the LSTF ùêø/‚àöùê∑ factor and finally by
removing the compensating heaters during the transient
as in the LSTF conditions. The comparison between the 3
nodalizations shows that the external heat losses and the
different hot leg geometries do not justify the delay between
both nodalizations (see Figure 32).

For analyzing the discrepancy, components with different
configuration that could affect the mass inventory and distri-
bution have been studied. Those are as follows.

(i) Pressurizer and surge line: PKL surge line is not
connected at the bottom of the pressurizer as in LSTF
facility.During the blowdown, somewater can remain
stagnant below the connection anticipating the core
dryout.

Four hybrid nodalizations are performed in series adding
one to one these LSTF components to the PKL hybrid
base nodalization. The aim is to analyze, one by one and
globally, how they modify the timing of the core dryout. The
nodalizations are

(i) PKL Hybrid A nodalization: PKL Hybrid base nodal-
ization + LSTF PZR;

(ii) PKL Hybrid B nodalization: PKL Hybrid A nodaliza-
tion + LSTF U-tubes surface;

(iii) PKL Hybrid C nodalization: PKL Hybrid B nodaliza-
tion + LSTF HL-to-DC bypass;

(iv) PKL Hybrid D nodalization: PKL Hybrid C nodaliza-
tion + LSTF vessel passive HS.

The results of hot leg liquid levels andCET (Figures 33 and
34) show that there are no changes in the core dryout timing
despite adding LSTF components to the PKL hybrid base
nodalization. It demonstrates that these design differences do
not have an effect on the reported discrepancy.

Finally, the vessel characteristics have been compared
between both nodalizations, showing relevant differences in
the configuration of the downcomer, the simulation of the
core bypass flow path, and, specially, the amount of water
between the bottom of the hot leg and the top of the core
(these features are described in Table 7). Hence, a Hybrid
E nodalization is generated adding to the ‚ÄúPKL Hybrid D
nodalization‚Äù hydrodynamic components, HSs, and material
properties of the LSTF vessel nodalization.The PKL fuel rods
HSs are not modified. The results obtained with this new
nodalization show that, for an identical amount of water in
the hot legs at the beginning of the transient (for having the
same PKL experimental initial conditions despite the changes
in the nodalizations), the core dryout occurs at the same time
as that of the LSTF posttest calculation just changing the
water distribution of the PKL vessel with that of the LSTF
vessel (see Figures 35 and 36). It demonstrates that delay

curves are mainly due to the different power distributions of
PKL (uniform) and LSTF (cosine). As modifications between
hybrid models have been implemented in a serial process,
just when PKL core power profile is modified (PKL hybrid
nodalization G), the slope of the curve becomes similar to
the LSTF posttest CET versus PCT slope. On the other hand,
previous changes (models E and F) do not show significant
modifications in the CET versus PCT correlation.

Finally, CET of the last nodalization (PKL Hybrid G
nodalization) is compared (Figure 38) with the nodalization
that justifies the delay in the core dryout (PKL Hybrid E
nodalization). Results show that new modifications do not
add distortion, justifying the consistency of the procedure.

5. Conclusions

The UPC scaling-up methodology has been applied for
analyzing discrepancies that appear between the simulations
of two counterpart tests.The conclusions related to the quality
assurance of system codes modeling can be divided into two
blocks, one related to the relevance of the ITF simulations and
posttest analyses and the other one related to the guidelines
of the proposed methodology for relating counterpart NPP
scaled calculations (also known as ùêæV-scaled analysis; see
[18]) and ITF posttest simulations.

In regard to the simulation of ITF tests, the present paper
has demonstrated that posttest analyses and counterpart sim-
ulations are unavoidable in order to qualify the NPPs model-
ing criteria which the analyst applies for characterizing the
NPP nodalization. Experimental data give the opportunity
to improve ITF nodalizations for selected phenomena and
scenarios, and, on the other hand, counterpart tests permit
studying their consistency over different scales and designs.
Only those phenomena that have been well reproduced using
the same modeling criteria at different ITFs can be used
for establishing modeling conclusions for qualifying and
improving NPP nodalizations. About this point, the results
of the present paper show how the LSTF-PKL counterpart
tests have allowed the analyst to define which phenomena
could be well reproduced by their nodalizations (CET versus
PCT correlation) and which not (quenching during SG fast
depressurization), in this way establishing the basis for a
future extrapolation to an NPP scaled calculation.

In addition, the UPC scaling-up methodology has been
checked over two counterpart simulations that were previ-
ously qualified with experimental data. The application of
the scaling effect and design effect analysis described in [8]
has demonstrated that selected phenomena can be perfectly
scaled up between counterpart simulations by carefully
considering the differences in scale and design. In relation



Science and Technology of Nuclear Installations 17

to this, scaled-up and hybrid nodalizations can be used in
order to scale results and predict the source of the possible
discrepancies.

Future work will be devoted to show an application of
the UPC scaled-upmethodology for qualifying a commercial
NPP nodalization over selected phenomena of LSTF-PKL
counterpart tests.
