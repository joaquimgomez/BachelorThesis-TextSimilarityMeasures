The β-delayed neutron emission probability, Pn, of very neutron-rich
nuclei allows us to achieve a better understanding of the nuclear structure
above the neutron separation energy, Sn. The emission of neutrons can be-
come the dominant decay process in neutron-rich astrophysical phenomena
such as the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). There are around
600 accessible isotopes for which β-delayed one-neutron emission (β1n) is
energetically allowed, but the branching ratio has only been determined for
about one third of them. β1n decays have been experimentally measured
up to the mass A ∼ 150, plus a single measurement of 210Tl. Concerning
two-neutron emitters (β2n), ∼ 300 isotopes are accessible and only 24 have
been measured so far up to the mass A = 100. In this contribution, we
report recent experiments which allowed the measurement of β1n emitters
for masses beyond A > 200 and N > 126 and identified the heaviest β2n
emitter measured so far, 136Sb.

1. Introduction

Neutron-rich nuclei usually decay by β decay alone. However, there are
cases where the neutron separation energy, Sn, of the decay daughter is
within the β-decay window. In this case, the emission of a neutron is al-
lowed and the final nucleus is lighter by one unit of mass. This decay mode
is called β-delayed one-neutron emission (β1n) and it was discovered in 1939
by Roberts et al. [1]. This phenomenon is very important in terms of nuclear
structure if we are to understand its contribution above the separation en-
ergy to the decay strength function and to study states populated after the
neutron emission [2, 3]. It has also an important role during the freeze-out of
the r-process path, when the neutron-rich material decays back to stability,
and the emitted neutrons can be re-captured by other nuclei in the environ-
ment. This produces a smooth shift to lower masses in the final elemental
abundance curve [4]. Furthermore, the β-delayed neutrons are fundamen-
tal in a nuclear power reactor operated in a prompt sub-critical, delayed
critical condition, and they are responsible for part of the decay heat after
shut down due to induced delayed fission reactions. Currently, there is a
strong interest in improving our knowledge of βn emitters in several regions
of the nuclei chart, see Ref. [5]. These were the reasons for the design and
construction of a high efficiency 4π neutron detector, based on 3He coun-
ters, named BELEN [6]. It was originally foreseen as part of the DESPEC
campaign within the NUSTAR Collaboration in the future RIB facility of
FAIR. Meanwhile, in order to test and improve its design, several branching
ratios of neutron-rich nuclei have been measured since 2009 at the IGISOL
facility in Jyväskylä (Finland) [7] and at GSI, Darmstadt (Germany) [8].

2. β-delayed neutron emission measurements in the A > 200
and N > 126 region at GSI Darmstadt

An experiment performed at the RIB facility of the GSI Helmholtz Cen-
ter for Heavy-Ion Research using the Fragment Separator (FRS) allowed the
production of several neutron-rich nuclei with masses beyond A > 200 in the
region of N > 126. The isotopes of interest were produced using a 1 GeV/u
238U beam with an average intensity of 2×109 ions/spill (1 s spill), impinging
on a 1.6 g/cm2 beryllium target at the entrance of the FRS, where fission and
fragmentation products were produced. The ions of interest were selected
via the Bρ–∆E–Bρ method [8]. They were identified by several tracking de-
tectors including plastic scintillators and ionizing chambers, which provided
their time of flight and the energy loss, respectively. With this information,
it was possible to identify the mass and charge of the ions that were arriving
in the experimental area [8]. The detection system, installed at the end of
the beam line, consisted of the BELEN neutron detector [11] and a stack

of silicon SSSD and DSSSD detectors, called SIMBA [9, 10]. During the
measurement, a cocktail beam was implanted into the DSSDs of SIMBA
where the isotopes decayed and the emitted β particles were recorded. This
information allowed the use of the implant-decay correlations to determine
the half-lives. The BELEN is a 4π neutron detector based on two rings of
3He proportional counters embedded in a polyethylene matrix surrounding
SIMBA. The detection of a neutron in BELEN within a given time-window
after a β decay in SIMBA allowed one to perform βn time correlations to
obtain the neutron branching ratio (Pn) [8]. In summary, in this experiment,
the half-lives of 204−206Au, 208−211Hg, 211−216Tl, 215−218Pb, and 218−220Bi
were determined, 9 of them for the first time, together with the first β1n
branching ratios in this region for 210,211Hg and 211−216Tl [8]. This repre-
sents the first Pn-values measured beyond A = 150, apart from the 210Tl
measurement [13, 14].

3. The β2n-emitter 136Sb

To overcome the challenge to measure multiple β-delayed neutron emis-
sion beyond A > 100 requires a high efficiency neutron detector, and a pure
intense beam without contamination from other species. In a previous exper-
iment [15], β2n events were registered from the A = 136 isobaric chain and
136Sb was assigned as the probable origin. The authors derived a value of
1.4±0.2% for the branching ratio, which is lower than the theoretical predic-
tion from the FRDM+QRPA model (6.2%) [16]. The aim of the study pre-
sented in this contribution is to determine the P2n value for 136Sb. The iso-
topically pure production of this isotope was possible thanks to the IGISOL
Penning trap facility [18] at the cyclotron of the University of Jyväskylä
(Finland).

The IGISOL facility can produce the isotopes of interest with a proton
beam at 25 MeV impinging on a 238U target. The system transports the
reaction products to a mass separator with a helium gas catcher to filter with
the mass of interest. After this process, the isobars enter the JYFLTRAP
system where the particular isotope of interest is selected and implanted
into a moving tape collector [17]. This moving tape collector was inside an
evacuated tube (see Fig. 1 (left)) and at the implantation region, a plastic
detector was placed in order to detect the β decays. This is the same method
used in previous experiments with a similar setup [7]. In this study, the
neutron detector was an upgraded version of the BELEN detector [6, 11],
which consisted of 48 3He counters distributed in 3 concentric rings inside a
polyethylene matrix, as shown in Fig. 1 (right). For the β2n measurements,
it was optimized to enhance the neutron detection efficiency, obtaining a
P1n efficiency of around ε1n = 60%, and ε2n = 36% in the energy range of
interest (see Fig. 2 (left)).

In this experiment, ions of 136Te, 136Sb, 95Rb and 137I, the latter two for
calibration purposes, were implanted and measured. This completed a list
of isotopes measured in the same experimental campaign at IGISOL, which
included high-precision P1n measurements for 95Rb, 95,98,98mY, 136,138Te,
137,140I and 135,137Sb, all of them in the top priority list from IAEA recom-
mendations [12]. The P1n values of the measured calibration isotopes, 95Rb
and 137I, agreed perfectly with previous experimental values [19, 20]. The
136Te was also implanted in order to confirm its P1n value and to include it
in the analysis of the 136Sb decay chain. Regarding the analysis of 136Sb, a
new P1n value will be provided as well as its P2n value, the latter for the first
time with a pure beam measurement. As shown in Fig. 2 (right), 26 corre-
lated βnn events have been identified after 6 days of beam time, from which
a P2n value < 1% can be extracted, which clearly disagrees with the result
of 1.4% derived from Ref. [15]. The analysis of the data is ongoing and the
results will be published soon.

4. Summary and outlook

The status of β-delayed neutron measurements is expected to be im-
proved drastically in the next few years thanks to several experimental cam-
paigns and devices developed recently and ready for use. In this conference,
two projects were mentioned. The DEUterated Scintillator array for Neu-
tron Tagging (DESCANT) detector at TRIUMF (Vancouver, Canada) is
based on liquid scintillators [21, 22] and can be coupled with the GRIFFIN
germanium array [23, 24]. It aims to measure β-delayed neutrons and their
energies, allowing coincidences with β decays and the γ rays in the final
nucleus.

Another project, presently under commission, is the BRIKEN campaign
at RIKEN Nishina Center in Japan [25]. This project aims to perform
measurements of more than a hundred β1n, and dozens of β2n and β3n
emitters, many of them for the first time. These isotopes will be the most
neutron-rich species measured so far due to the high beam intensities of very
exotic neutron-rich nuclei provided at RIKEN, and the superior efficiency of
this setup of ε1n ∼ 70% in combination with a state-of-the-art implantation
detector AIDA [26].
