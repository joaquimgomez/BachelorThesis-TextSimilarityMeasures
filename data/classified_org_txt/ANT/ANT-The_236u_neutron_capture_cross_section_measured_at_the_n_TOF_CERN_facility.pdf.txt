Abstract. The 236U isotope plays an important role in nuclear systems, both for future and currently operating
ones. The actual knowledge of the capture reaction of this isotope is satisfactory in the thermal region, but it is
considered insufficient for Fast Reactor and ADS applications. For this reason the 236U(n, γ ) reaction cross-
section has been measured for the first time in the whole energy region from thermal energy up to 1 MeV
at the n TOF facility with two different detection systems: an array of C6D6 detectors, employing the total
energy deposited method, and a 4π total absorption calorimeter (TAC), made of 40 BaF2 crystals. The two
n TOF data sets agree with each other within the statistical uncertainty in the Resolved Resonance Region up
to 800 eV, while sizable differences (up to � 20%) are found relative to the current evaluated data libraries.
Moreover two new resonances have been found in the n TOF data. In the Unresolved Resonance Region up
to 200 keV, the n TOF results show a reasonable agreement with previous measurements and evaluated data.

1. Introduction
236U plays an important role in nuclear systems, both
innovative or already in use. In the current reactors based
on U/Pu it is important in the neutron balance in the core
and in the equilibrium fuel composition. Regarding the
future reactors based on the Th/U cycle, 236U plays the
same role as 242Pu in the traditional fuel cycle, therefore
its contribution to the fraction of absorbed neutrons is
relevant. The actual knowledge of the capture cross-section
of 236U is considered satisfactory in the thermal region,
but insufficient for Fast Reactors and ADS applications;
in these cases the target accuracy is 10% [1], which is
therefore the aim of the present measurement.

Major data libraries are based on a few experimental
measurements characterized by poor accuracy and
resolution and covering incomplete energy ranges. Apart
for the low-energy 1/v region, where the major evaluations
like JENDL-4.0, ENDF/B-VII.1 and JEFF-3.2 show a
smooth trend and are in agreement between each other
within a few percent, discrepancies are observed between
evaluated data and experimental results, in particular in
the Resolved Resonance Region (RRR), which are well
above the required accuracy. Moreover, the RRR is limited
to 1.5 keV in most of the libraries, while it extends up
to 4.0 keV in JENDL-4.0. In the Unresolved Resonance
Region (URR), evaluated cross-section below 200 keV are
consistent to each other, although experimental data show
some discrepancies, while above 200 keV both evaluations
and experimental data show large variations.

The present situation is therefore unacceptable for
future nuclear applications. This situation motivated
a new measurement of the capture cross-section of
236U at the CERN n TOF facility [2]. To reduce
systematic uncertainties, the measurement was carried out
with two independent detection techniques based on a
Total Absorption Calorimeter [3] and a pair of C6D6
detectors [4].

2. The experimental setup
The C6D6 detectors, characterized by a low neutron
sensitivity and γ -ray effciency, are mounted at 135◦ with
respect to the sample; they rely on the use of the Pulse
Height Weigting Technique [5] which requires that at
most one γ -ray per capture event is detected. The second
detection system (TAC), made of 40 BaF2 crystals and
characterized by high geometric and intrinsic effciciency,

allows detection and reconstruction of the full γ -ray
cascade of the capture event. However, due to its large
sensitivity to neutrons and to the γ -flash, it was not
possible to collect data above a few tens of keV.

The uranium sample consists of a high purity pressed
disk pellet 99.85% enriched in 236U3O8 with a total mass
of 399 mg. Known contaminants are 0.05% of 235U and
0.1% of 238U. The pressed pellet is placed inside a disk
shaped capsule made of high purity and normal aluminum.
A capsule without sample inside, called “dummy”, was
built with the same dimensions of the aluminum capsule.
The sample was inserted between two thin kapton foils and
this assembly was glued on a carbon fiber frame mounted
on the remotely-controlled sample exchanger together
with other samples used for the determination of the
background: an “empty” sample, made of just the kapton
foils, the dummy sample, a nat Pb sample for in-beam γ -
rays and a natural gold sample used for normalization
purposes. All samples were made with the same diameter
as the U3O8 pellet.

3. Results
3.1. The resolved resonance region

The background-subtracted capture yield measured with
the C6D6 setup is shown in Fig. 1. The resolved
resonance region was analyzed by means of the R-matrix
code SAMMY. The yield has been parametrized via
the Reich-Moore approximation; experimental effects as
Doppler broadening, sample scattering, isotopic correction
for contaminants, self-shielding and n TOF resolution
function are properly taken into account within the
SAMMY code.

In the SAMMY fit a residual constant background was
considered that was probably due to an underestimated
contribution of the aluminum capsule. However, in the
Resolved Resonanance Region, this component is only
� 0.04% in the extracted capture yield.

In the fitting procedure for the Resonance Shape
Analysis (RSA), the resonance energy (ER) and both
partial widths (�γ and �n) were allowed to vary. While the
resulting 236U resonance parameters are not very accurate,
this procedure provides an accurate value for the capture
kernel, g�γ �n/�. As a starting point for the SAMMY fits,
the resonance parameters from the JENDL-4.0 data library

TAC analysis.

Although structures are present, the lower statistics
of C6D6 comparated to the TAC data does not allow
to analyze resonance above 800 eV with a statistical
uncertainty on the capture kernel below 40%. An example
of the fitted yield of C6D6 data is shown in Fig. 2.

Two structures at 76.7 and 362.9 eV not present in
major data libraries have been found in the C6D6 data
set, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, and were confirmed by
the TAC measurement. A possible candidate is a 237Np
contamination in the sample as a result of the capture

reaction on 236U(n, γ )237U followed by β-decay. However,
since there is no evidence of other, stronger resonances of
237Np in the analyzed energy range, these resonances could
be attributed to 236U.

The capture kernel is sensitive to systematic effects
related to the experimental setup, in particular to the
neutron sensitivity. In the present analysis, these effects
have been correctly taken into account, as demonstrated
by Fig. 5, where the ratio between the capture kernels
calculated from the resonance parameters obtained from
C6D6 and from the TAC data is shown. The good
agreement between the two datasets and the resulting
average difference of less than 1% confirms that the

capture yield in both independent analyses was consistent
and reliable.

A comparison of the capture kernels measured at
n TOF with the ones calculated from data libraries (see
Fig. 6) shows a deviation of 16% relative to JENDL-4.0
and of 23% relative to ENDF/B-V.II.1. Between 800 eV
and 1.5 keV, the resonance analysis has been performed
only on the TAC data. Structures above 1.5 keV are present

in both data sets, confirming the structures in the evaluated
cross section of JENDL-4.0. However, in this case the low
statistics makes it difficult to perform a resonance analysis
above 1.5 keV neutron energy.

3.2. The unresolved resonance region

Regarding the unresolved resonance region, a comparison
between the C6D6 average cross-section data and major
data libraries shown in Fig. 7 reveals that in this energy
range the present results agree to better than 5% with major
evaluations up to 700-800 keV. Due to the prompt γ -flash
and inelastic reactions, data above this energy range are not
very reliable.

The two structures in the data at 5.9 and 34.7 keV
are not due to the 236U(n, γ ) reaction, but are consistent
with the 27Al(n, γ ) reactions in the capsule, which are
affected by a sizable uncertainty. This result and the
constant background found in the RRR, indicate that the
contribution of the aluminum capsule to the total capture
yield is underestimated.

A comparison with previous results shown in Fig. 8,
indicates that the present data, apart from the discrepancies
due to the aluminum structures, agree better than 7% with
most of the previous measurements up to 700–800 keV.

As a final remark, it should be considered that the
present data, affected by a systematic uncertainty around
7%, are certainly the most accurate obtained so far in
this energy region that is particularly important for the
development of fast reactors.
