Among the main missions of mod-
ern radioactive isotope facilities is the 
exploration of properties of yet un-
known isotopes on the neutron-rich 
side of the chart of nuclides. However, 
going more neutron-rich also means 
that the neutron separation energy de-
creases until it reaches the dripline at 
Sn = 0 MeV. If the neutron separation 
energy gets lower than the β-decay 
energy window (Qβ value), a new de-
cay mechanism can occur: the emis-
sion of neutrons after β-decay. These 
“β-delayed neutron” (βn) emitters 
play a crucial role in nuclear structure, 
nuclear astrophysics, and for nuclear 
reactor applications. 

For neutron-rich nuclei far from 
stability, β-delayed neutron emission 
becomes the dominant decay process. 
The neutron emission probability (Pn 
value) helps to verify the modeled 
β-strength distribution and the level 
structure of the daughter nucleus. Also 
the β-decay half-life of the parent nu-
cleus can be determined via β-delayed 
neutron emission.

Explosive astrophysical scenarios 
in neutron-rich environments like the 
“rapid neutron-capture” (r) process 
are responsible for the creation of 
about half of the stable isotopes be-
yond iron. In core collapse supernova 
explosions or the merging of neutron 
stars with a neutron star or a Black 
Hole, neutron densities in excess of 
>>1020 cm–3 can be reached, and ig-
nite the r-process nucleosynthesis for 
a few seconds. Fast subsequent neu-
tron captures and β-decays create very 
neutron-rich, heavy isotopes, most of 
which have not yet been discovered. 
When the temperature and neutron 

density drop rapidly due to the rapid 
expansion of the r-process rich ma-
terial, the so-called “freeze-out” al-
lows the neutron-rich material to de-
cay back to stability via long β-decay 
chains. 

βn-emitters in these decay chains 
can influence the neutron budget 
in the late-time evolution of the r-
process in two ways: the emission of 
neutrons leads to a transfer of material 
into β-decay chains with lower mass 
number, and the emitted neutron can 
be thermalized and recaptured by the 
decaying material. Thus an accurate 
knowledge of the neutron-branching 
ratio and half-lives of as many βn-
emitters as possible is a crucial prereq-
uisite for improving theoretical mod-
els to achieve a better understanding 
of r-process nucleosynthesis models.

In fission reactors the longer re-
sponse time of βn allows keeping 
the system in a controlled subcritical 
state. Although their number (delayed 
neutrons per fission event) is only in 
the order of 1% of the total neutron 
yield, they have a long enough effec-
tive lifetime to insert or withdraw rods 
containing neutron absorbing materi-
als to control the reactor.

Out of the 2,451 isotopes listed in 
the latest Atomic Mass Evaluation 
(AME2016) [1], 621 are β-delayed 
neutron emitters. However, for only 
298 of them (48%) a measurement of 
the one-neutron branching ratio (P1n 
value) exists (Figure 1). For β-delayed 
multiple-neutron emitters, this ratio 
drops to less than 8%, and so far only 
one β-delayed four-neutron emitter 
(β4n) has been measured, 17B.

There are two main reasons for the 
low number of measurements:

●  The communities were so far fo-
cused on “easy” to reach nuclei, 
thus light nuclei with A < 30, 
and fission fragments around A 
= 90 and A = 135.

●  The production rate for more 
neutron-rich isotopes at current 
radioactive beam facilities falls 
approximately by one order of 
magnitude per mass unit.

Setups using moderated proportional 
neutron counters, such as 3He- or BF3-
filled tubes, are the most efficient way 
to detect β-delayed neutrons. Previous 
setups have reached (one-) neutron 
detection efficiencies of up to 60% 
(see Figure 2). To further increase the

detection efficiency despite the dras-
tically increased prize for 3He, the 
merging of tubes from existing neu-
tron detectors is the most cost-effec-
tive solution. 

The BRIKEN project was initiated 
in 2012, after the successful cam-
paigns of the BELEN collaboration 
at GSI Darmstadt, Germany [2] with 
the BELEN-30 detector, and at the 
IGISOL facility in Jyväskylä, Finland 
with the BELEN-20 and BELEN-48 
detectors [3–5]. For the detection of 
ion and beta particles the state-of-the-
art “Advanced Implantation Detection 
Array” (AIDA) was used, which was 
developed by the University of Edin-
burgh, University of Liverpool, STFC 
Daresbury Laboratory, and STFC 
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory  
[6, 7].

The “Beta-delayed neutrons at 
RIKEN” project was born with the 
goal to design the world’s most ef-
ficient neutron detector array and set 

it up at the presently most powerful 
facility to produce neutron-rich iso-
topes. By 2013 the size of the collabo-
ration had doubled, and the setup with 
the originally 52 3He tubes provided 
by UPC Barcelona, IFIC Valencia, and 
GSI Darmstadt (from the BELEN de-
tector), had almost quadrupled to up 
to 179 available 3He tubes. The ad-
ditional tubes were provided by Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory (81 coun-
ters from 3Hen) [8, 9], JINR Dubna 
(20 counters from VASSILISSA) [10], 
and RIKEN (26 counters). In addi-
tion, γ-ray detection capabilities were 
implemented by the addition of two 
large-volume HPGe clover detectors 
from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 

Between 2013 and 2016 an ex-
tensive conceptual design study was 
carried out for two versions of the 
BRIKEN array: a “hybrid mode” 
including the two clover detectors 
(BRIKEN-148H) and a high-effi-
ciency “compact mode” (BRIKEN-

148C and BRIKEN-166C) [11]. The 
hybrid setup can be easily transformed 
into a compact design with 166 coun-
ters, which increases the average de-
tection efficiency for single neutrons 
up to 1 MeV from 68.6% to 75.7% 
(BRIKEN-166C).

For very neutron-rich nuclei with 
a large βn-energy window, a strong 
dependence of the detector efficiency 
on the neutron energy might hamper 
the respective measurement of the 
neutron branching ratios. Thus special 
care was taken in these simulations 
to design a neutron detector that has 
a relatively constant and high neutron 
detection efficiency up to 1 MeV with 
small variations up to 5 MeV (Figures 
2 and 3). 

A comparison of the design effi-
ciencies for the hybrid and compact 
versions of the BRIKEN array and 
other existing neutron detectors for 
β-delayed neutron experiments is 
shown in Figure 2. 

The presently most powerful facil-
ity for the production of neutron-rich 
isotopes is located at RIKEN Nishina 
Center in Wako, Japan. At the “Radio-
active Ion Beam Factory” (RIBF) a 
238U beam with 345 MeV per nucleon 
is impinging on a production target, 
and the neutron-rich fragments are 
filtered out by the BigRIPS fragment 
separator and the Zero-Degree Spec-
trometer, and are then stopped in the 
stack of six double-sided silicon-strip 
detectors (DSSSDs, wafer size 8 × 
8 cm2) in the implantation detector 
AIDA, which serves as an ion and beta 
counter. AIDA is surrounded by the 
respective BRIKEN neutron/gamma 
detector array.

The BRIKEN project relies fully 
on digital electronics systems. The 
GASIFIC triggerless DAQ—devel-
oped by IFIC Valencia for the BELEN 
detector [5]—has been upgraded, and 
a set of software tools for data analysis 
have been developed.

tectors with the BRIKEN setups at average neutron energies of 1 MeV (black

The setup has been installed and 
commissioned in 2016. For the fi rst 
phase of the BRIKEN campaign in 
2016/17 the hybrid setup with 140 
counters and two clovers was used, 
with a detection effi ciency that closely 
resembles the one given for BRIKEN-
148H in Figure 2. 

Two experimental proposals have 
very successfully been carried out in 
the fi rst campaign, focusing on βn-
emitters around and beyond the shell 
closures at N = 50 and N = 82. In addi-
tion, the preparatory phase of another 
proposal aiming the measurement of 
β-decay properties at the N = 104 mid-
shell closure was completed. 

The fi rst experiment produced and 
implanted a world record number of 
7,500 doubly magic 78Ni nuclei (Z 
= 28, N = 50), about three orders of 
magnitude more than in a previous ex-
periment at NSCL [12]. In the region 
between 75Co and 96Br in total about 
30 β1n- or β2n-branching ratios were 
measured, many of them for the fi rst 
time, as well as 20 β-decay half-lives.

The second experiment focused 
on the region around the N = 82 shell 
closure, which is of particular interest 
for astrophysics. The solar abundance 
curve shows an abundance peak at A 
≈ 130, which is directly connected 
to neutron-rich βn-emitters at N = 82 
produced by the r-process. About 30 
new neutron-branching ratios were 
measured in a region at or very close 
to the r-process path predicted by 
some astrophysical models, including 
some of the heaviest β-delayed mul-
tiple neutron emitter.

The third experiment is focused on 
deformed βn-emitters, which are criti-
cal for understanding the formation 
of the rare-earth abundance peak at A 
≈ 160 during the r-process. Presently 
there is a large gap between 150La (Z = 
57) and 210Hg (Z = 80) with no mea-
sured neutron-branching ratios. The 
preparatory phase of this experiment 
was completed in June 2017 by veri-
fying the production cross-sections. 
Although only a small fraction of this 
experimental program was carried 
out, already 10 P1n values and β-decay 
half-lives were measured for the fi rst 
time.

The BRIKEN collaboration (Fig-
ure 5) has carried out the second 
phase of measurements in fall 2017. 
The  previous statistics for the A = 
80 region could be tripled, and many 
new beta-delayed neutron emitters 
in the  A = 100–125 region could be 
added. For this phase, an adaption of 
the hybrid setup was used to increase 
the gamma-detection effi ciency of the

two clover detectors. In the fi rst phase 
each clover was 68 mm away from the 
implantation area. In the new design 
this distance was reduced to 38 mm, 
which allowed doubling the effi ciency 
and reaching a value that is roughly 
half of that of the EURICA array. 

After these successful fi rst experi-
ments, the BRIKEN collaboration 
is planning to continue their mea-
surements until at least 2019. With 
this setup, the largest investigation 
of β-delayed neutron emitters so far 
is being carried out, measuring well 
over a hundred β1n-, β2n-, and β3n-
emitters, and in the future also β4n-
emitters, in the mass region between 
A = 10 and 210, many of them for 
the fi rst time. This effort will help to 
better understand β-delayed neutron 
emission, the dominant decay mecha-
nism of neutron-rich nuclei.
