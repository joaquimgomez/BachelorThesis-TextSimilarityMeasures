Abstract. The n_TOF facility operates at CERN with the aim of addressing the request
of high accuracy nuclear data for advanced nuclear energy systems as well as for nu-
clear astrophysics. Thanks to the features of the neutron beam, important results have
been obtained on neutron induced fission and capture cross sections of U, Pu and minor
actinides. Recently the construction of another beam line has started; the new line will
be complementary to the first one, allowing to further extend the experimental program
foreseen for next measurement campaigns.

1 Introduction

The development of new systems in nuclear technology has raised the need for high-accuracy neutron
cross-section data on a variety of isotopes. At present, available data are insufficient for new medical
and industrial applications, and in particular for the development of innovative concepts for safer
energy production and nuclear waste incineration, such as Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS), Gen
IV fast reactors or reactors based on Th/U fuel cycle.

The neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF was built at CERN more than ten years ago with the aim
of providing new and accurate cross sections of neutron-induced reactions of interest for fundamental
and applied nuclear science. The experimental activity is focused mostly on the measurement of
capture and fission reactions relevant to nuclear technology [1] as well as on neutron capture reactions
involved in stellar nucleosynthesis [2]. n_TOF is a white neutron source, where neutrons are produced
by spallation of a 20 GeV proton beam on a massive lead block and subsequently moderated by either
natural or borated water. The neutron beam in the current experimental area, located at 185 m from
the spallation target, is characterized by a unique combination of high luminosity, wide energy range,
high resolution and low duty cycle (Table 1). As a consequences of the high instantaneous flux, the
facility is particularly suitable for measurements involving low cross section, radioactive isotopes and
samples available in small quantity.

2 Experimental setup

Different detection systems have been developed and used by the n_TOF Collaboration for fission and
capture cross section measurements as well as for the accurate determination and monitoring of the
incident neutron flux [3].

Prompt γ-rays from the de-excitation of compound nucleus formed in capture reactions are de-
tected with two systems: a pair of low neutron sensitivity C6D6 liquid scintillator detectors [4] and
a Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC), made of 40 BaF2 crystals [5]. The intrinsically low neutron
sensitivity of C6D6 detectors allows to minimize the background induced by scattered neutrons which
typically affects capture measurements. The TAC instead is characterized by high geometric and in-
trinsic efficiency that allow to detect and reconstruct the full γ-ray cascade from the capture events,
thus discriminating them from fission reactions and from various sources of background. However the
device is affected by a large neutron sensitivity. For these reasons, accurate cross sections on a given
isotope at n_TOF are often obtained by combining results from the two complementary detection
systems.

Fission cross-section measurements are routinely carried out with different detector systems. In
the past Fission Ionization Chambers (FIC) [6] have been used. More recently, the FICs have been
replaced with high performance MicroMegas detectors [7]. The detector is composed of a gas volume
separated into two small regions by a thin micromesh; it has several advantages, such as high radiation
hardness, a high signal-to-noise ratio and a good discrimination of α-particles from fission fragments.
Another method used at n_TOF relies on the detection of both fission fragments in coincidence, by
means of a stack of position-sensitive Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters (PPACs) [8], with the fissile
sample placed in between two detectors. The position sensitivity of the device allows to measure,
together with the cross-section, the angular distribution of fission fragments.

3 Results and perspectives

The accuracy of neutron cross-sections for a great number of isotopes, many of which of interest for
nuclear technologies, has been improved thanks to data collected at n_TOF during the two experi-
mental campaigns performed so far (2001-2004 and 2009-2012). Some of the most important results
obtained are mentioned hereafter.

High accuracy results have been obtained on the radiative capture of 232Th and fission of 233U,
both of fundamental importance for the development of the Th/U fuel cycle: 232Th(n,γ) cross section
has been determined from 1 eV to 1 MeV with a 5% accuracy [9, 10] and in the Unresolved Res-
onances Region (URR) a long standing discrepancy of 40% between previous data has been finally
solved; similarly high quality results have been obtained on 233U(n,f) [11, 12] from thermal to 20
MeV. High accuracy fission cross-sections have been obtained also on 237Np and 240Pu [13, 14], two
of the minor actinides most abundantly produced in current reactors. These data are needed in trans-
mutation projects or for the design of Gen IV fast nuclear reactors. Recently capture cross section of
238U, 236U, 241Am and fission cross section of 240Pu and 242Pu have been measured with the aim of
reaching unprecedented accuracy.

In Figure 1 preliminary results on the radiative capture cross section of 236U measured at n_TOF
with two detection systems are shown and compared with ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluation or previous ex-
perimental data. At n_TOF 236U(n,γ) cross-section has been measured for the first time in the whole
energy region from thermal energy up to 1 MeV. In the Resolved Resonance Region (RRR), the
n_TOF results indicate that the evaluated library need some refinement on both the strength and en-
ergy of the resonances (left panel), while in the Unresolved Resonance Region (URR) the new data
finally rule out some previous results, confirming current evaluations (right panel).

To expand the potentiality of the facility a new beam line and corresponding experimental area are
being constructed and will be completed in May 2014. The shorter flight path of 20 m will ensure a
25 times higher neutron flux in this new experimental area and a factor 250 in the signal/background
ratio. Although with a loss in energy resolution (due to the shorter flight path), the extremely high
instantaneous neutron flux will allow to perform a new set of measurements which are not feasible at
the moment, particularly those on radioactive isotopes with lifetime as short as a few years.
A rich experimental program is foreseen at n_TOF for the next years, both in the far (200 m, EAR1)
and in the near (20 m, EAR2) experimental areas. Among them several measurements are being
planned of interest for Nuclear Astrophysics, Nuclear Medicine and Basic Nuclear Physics. New mea-
surements of interest for nuclear technology are foreseen in EAR1, such as the simultaneous capture
and fission cross section of 233U, the fission of 231Pa and capture of 242Pu, while in the new experimen-
tal area the Collaboration is planning challenging measurements such as 238,241Pu(n,f), 244Cm(n,f),
232U(n,f) and 245Cm(n,γ).
