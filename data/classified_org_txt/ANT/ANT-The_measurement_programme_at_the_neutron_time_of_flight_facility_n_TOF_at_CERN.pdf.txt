Abstract. Neutron-induced reaction cross sections are important for a wide variety of research fields ranging
from the study of nuclear level densities, nucleosynthesis to applications of nuclear technology like design,
and criticality and safety assessment of existing and future nuclear reactors, radiation dosimetry, medical
applications, nuclear waste transmutation, accelerator-driven systems and fuel cycle investigations. Simula-
tions and calculations of nuclear technology applications largely rely on evaluated nuclear data libraries. The
evaluations in these libraries are based both on experimental data and theoretical models. CERN’s neutron
time-of-flight facility n TOF has produced a considerable amount of experimental data since it has become
fully operational with the start of its scientific measurement programme in 2001. While for a long period a
single measurement station (EAR1) located at 185 m from the neutron production target was available, the
construction of a second beam line at 20 m (EAR2) in 2014 has substantially increased the measurement
capabilities of the facility. An outline of the experimental nuclear data activities at n TOF will be presented.

1. Introduction
Nuclear data in general, and neutron-induced reactions
in particular, are important for a number of research
fields. Evaluated nuclear reaction data play an essential
role in calculations and simulations for design and
operational studies of nuclear technology systems. For
this purpose they have to contain all reactions and all
energy regions, even where experimental data are missing,
insufficient or inconsistent. Applications of nuclear data
are usually based on evaluated nuclear data libraries
like JEFF, ENDF, JENDL, CENDL, BROND and several
others. While these libraries have started historically
with a focus on nuclear fission reactors, nowadays
they are general purpose libraries and intended to be
universal.

Experimental data form an important source of
information for evaluated nuclear data. The EXFOR
library [1,2] is the international storage and retrieval
system for experimental results. It contains data that
are often not available numerically in publications and
laboratory reports. The measured quantities including
detailed experimental conditions have nowadays become
the standard quality for EXFOR submission.

Contributions to nuclear data come from a variety
of experimental facilities, including the pulsed white
spallation neutron source n TOF at CERN, which has
been recently upgraded with its second beam line [3,4].
Each facility has its own unique and often complementary
characteristics. A more complete overview of the nuclear
data measurements and their references performed at
n TOF since the start of its scientific measurement
programme in 2001 is given in Ref. [5].

2. The neutron time-of-flight facility
n TOF at CERN
The neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF was constructed
following an idea proposed by Rubbia et al. [6] and
has become fully operational after a commissioning
programme [7]. The facility is based on the 6 ns
wide, 20 GeV pulsed proton beam from CERN’s Proton
Synchrotron (PS) with typically 7 × 1012 protons per
pulse, impinging on a lead spallation target, yielding about
300 neutrons per incident proton. A layer of water around
the spallation target moderates the initially fast neutrons
down to a white spectrum of neutrons covering the full
range of energies between meV and GeV.

The neutron bunches are spaced by multiples of 1.2 s,
a characteristic of the operation cycle of the PS. This
allows measurements to be made over long times of flight,
reaching to low neutron energies, without any overlap into
the next neutron cycle. In this way it is possible to measure
neutron energies as low as about 10 meV, with the neutron
spectrum free of slow neutrons from previous cycles. The
large energy range that can be measured at once is one of
the key characteristics of the facility.

Another important feature of n TOF is the very
high number of neutrons per proton burst, also called
instantaneous neutron flux. In case of cross section
measurements on radioactive samples in the neutron beam,
this results in a favourable ratio between the number of
signals due to neutron-induced reactions and those due to
radioactive decay events contributing to the background.

Two different target-moderator assemblies have been
used up to now in the operation of n TOF. A first
spallation target was used from 2001 up to 2004 during

Figure 1. Impression of the n TOF facility with its two neutron beam lines (drawn in blue) ending in the experimental areas EAR1 and
EAR2. The neutron source, on the left lower part of the drawing, is a lead spallation target on which the proton beam (in green) impinges.
In the direction of EAR1 a separate neutron moderator is located. The two different targets that have been used up to now are shown in
the top insets (surrounding cooling water omitted, see text).

phase-I. The water coolant of the target also served as
a neutron moderator. The spallation target was a block
of lead of dimensions 80 × 80 × 60 cm3. During phase-II,
after the installation in 2008 of an upgraded cylindrical
lead spallation target 40 cm in length and 60 cm in
diameter, the target was enclosed with a separate cooling
circuit resulting in a 1 cm water layer in the neutron
beam direction, followed by an exchangeable moderator
with a thickness of 4 cm. Demineralized water has been
used as a moderator, as well as water with a saturated
10B-solution in order to reduce the number of 2.223 MeV
gamma rays from hydrogen capture, which otherwise
forms an important contribution to the background due
to in-beam gamma rays. The 10B-loaded moderator,
strongly suppressing thermal neutrons, affects the energy
distribution of the neutron flux only noticeably below 1 eV.

Since the construction of EAR2 in 2014 two neutron
beam lines are in operation. In Fig. 1 a sketch of
the two beam lines is shown, together with insets
showing the two spallation targets used up to now. The
corresponding neutron fluxes, per unit of lethargy, are
shown in Fig. 2. The higher flux density of EAR2
compared to EAR1, a factor of about 25 with the flux
expressed in neutrons/eV/pulse, opens the possibility for
measurements on targets of low mass or for reactions with
low cross section within a reasonable time. The shorter
flight distance of about a factor 10 also results in a 10 times
shorter time interval for a same energy region. Therefore,
the combination of the higher flux and the shorter time
interval results in an increase of the signal to noise ratio
of a factor 250 (flux expressed in neutrons/ns/pulse) for
radioactive samples, at cost of lower energy resolution.
The strong suppression of the thermal neutron peak in
EAR1 due to the 10B-loaded moderator is clearly visible
in Fig. 2. The horizontal neutron beam line, collimated
and guided through an evacuated tube over a distance
of approximately 185 m, has been in use since the start
of the facility. It leads to an experimental area (EAR1)

where samples and detectors can be mounted and neutron
induced reactions are measured. A second neutron beam
line and experimental area (EAR2), has been constructed
and has been operational since 2014. This flight path is
vertical and about 20 m long, viewing the top part of the
spallation target. In this case the cooling water circuit acts
as a moderator.

3. Nuclear data measurements at n TOF
A substantial number of nuclear data measurements has
been performed at n TOF. For a full list with references,
see Ref. [5]. One of the major issues to overcome is the
availability of radioactive samples in a suitable form for
neutron time-of-flight measurements [8,9].

During phase-I from 2001 to 2004, data have been
taken for a number of nuclides in capture and fission
experiments. These include neutron capture measurements
on the nuclei 24,25,26Mg, 56Fe, 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr, 139La,
151Sm, 186,187,188Os, 197Au, 204,206,207,208Pb, 209Bi, 233U,
234U, 237Np, 240Pu, and 243Am with C6D6 detectors and
with a 4π total absorption calorimeter (TAC) consisting of
40 BaF2 crystals. The spatial neutron beam profile, needed
for normalization of the neutron flux, has been measured
with a MicroMegas-based detector (MGAS) [10] and was
confirmed by simulations, allowing the energy-dependent
beam-interception factor to be calculated.

Fission ionization chambers (FIC) were used to
measure the fission cross sections of the actinides 232Th,
234U, 236U, and 237Np relative to 235U and 238U. An
additional chamber was used to measure neutron-induced
fission cross sections of the very radioactive actinides 233U,
241Am, 243Am, and 245Cm, also relative to 235U, 238U.

In addition fission detectors based on Parallel
Plate Avalanche Counters (PPACs) were developed,
simultaneously detecting both fission fragments, which
allows to discard alpha and high-energy reactions
and therefore being capable of performing fission

EAR2, as seen at the sample position at nominal distances of 185 m (EAR1) and 20 m (EAR2) for the small collimator. The shown
fluxes are the preliminary results of several measurements and simulations. The strong reduction of the thermal peak in EAR1 is due to
the 10B-loaded moderator.

measurements up to 1 GeV. Furthermore, the position of
each fission fragment is also measured, allowing the study
of the fission anisotropy. Measurements of the fission cross
sections of natPb, 209Bi, 232Th, 237Np, 233U, 234U, relative to
235U and 238U were performed.

During phase-II from 2009 to 2012, the experimental
area EAR1 has been upgraded to become a class A work
zone, allowing to use unsealed radioactive samples. Both
stable and unstable samples were used to measure (n,γ )
reactions on 25Mg, 54Fe, 56Fe, 57Fe, 58Ni, 62Ni, 63Ni,
92Zr, 93Zr (for references see Ref. [5]) and 236U [11],
238U [12] and 241Am [13]. The TAC was also used in
combination with a MicroMegas detector in a first attempt
to measure the 235U(n,γ ) reaction using a veto on the
235U(n,f) reaction [14]. An upgraded PPAC assembly was
used to measure the angular distributions of 232Th and 234U
fission fragments. The angular distribution of 235U and
238U [15] and the analysis of the resonance region of the
234U [16] measurement has been reported recently.

Several other techniques have been tested as well,
including resonance spin assignments on 87Sr with the
TAC, a measurement of the 59Ni(n,α) cross section with
diamond detectors [17], and measurements with Mi-
croMegas detectors on 240Pu(n,f), 242Pu(n,f) and 33S(n,α),
and a flux-integrated cross section of 12C(n,p)12B.

While tables of the phase-I and phase-II measurements
with their references are given in Ref. [5], Table 1
summarizes the measurements performed in both EAR1
and EAR2 in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Additional references
for the fission programme can also be found in Ref. [18].

The experimental area EAR2 was designed as a class
A work zone, allowing unsealed radioactive samples to be
used, for which the n TOF facility has particularly suited
beam properties. For the operation of Phase-III, a new data

acquisition system was developed, based on 175 MSample
digitizers with a sampling frequency of up to 2 GHz and
amplitude resolution of 12 and 14 bits. The larger on-board
memory has significantly increased the exploitable time-
of-flight range which is now expanded down to thermal
neutron energies for both EAR1 and EAR2.

The measurement programme in EAR2 started with a
first part of commissioning by measuring quantities such
as flux and background and focussing on the feasibility

of fission measurements. The energy dependence of the
number of neutrons incident on the sample, referred to
as the neutron flux, was measured both with an in-beam
neutron-to-charged-particle converter foil, monitored by
off-beam silicon detectors, and foils combined with in-
beam MicroMegas detectors.

After the first part of commissioning, the very first
physics measurement in EAR2 concerned the 240Pu(n,f)
reaction with MicroMegas detectors [31], later followed
by a similar setup to measure 237Np(n,f). In 2015,
the commissioning of EAR2 continued, exploring the
possibilities of (n,γ ) measurements, for applications in
nuclear astrophysics [35] and nuclear technology, as well
as neutron-induced charged particle reactions like the
7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) experiments. The complex multi-
detector system STEFF [36] was installed in EAR2 for
commissioning and a measurement of fission fragments
spectroscopy on 235U. Silicon strip detectors were used
in EAR2 for a 26Al(n,α) measurement. In EAR1 the use
of a proton recoil detector (PRT) was developed in order
to measure the 235U(n,f)/1H(n,n) ratio. The 233U(n,γ /f)
ratio was measured with the TAC combined with a fission
ionization chamber [27].

4. n TOF measurements and nuclear
evaluations
The majority of the measurements at the n TOF facility are
related to cross sections: capture and fission experiments
since phase-I and also (n,α) and (n,p) measurements in
phase-II and phase-III. Once an experiment has been
fully analyzed and the results published, it is important
to make the data available for further use in nuclear
data evaluations. The basic measured data for a typical
measurement are a set of detector count spectra as a
function of neutron time-of-flight. Usually these spectra
are then processed in order to obtain a reaction yield
or cross section ratio as a function of neutron energy.
This is the quantity that is intended to be stored in the
EXFOR database, which then subsequently can serve
as a basis for nuclear data evaluations, which can be
adopted in new releases of evaluated nuclear data libraries.
Applications for nuclear technology do not rely directly
on measurements as collected in EXFOR, but nearly
always on evaluated libraries. The time path between
a measurement and the inclusion in an evaluation for
an evaluated nuclear data library is in general rather
capricious. A list of requests for measurements is
organized by the OECD-NEA High Priority Request List
(HPRL) [37]. Evaluation efforts are performed in national
projects or on an international scale like the CIELO project
[38,39] for the nuclei 1H, 16O, 56Fe, 235,238U, and 239Pu.

In the field of nuclear data much effort is nowadays
put on reducing uncertainties. One strategy is to perform
the same measurement at different facilities world-
wide. Recognizing and documenting measured data,
uncertainties and covariances is an additional exertion
in this respect. The process of reducing the several
independent uncorrelated counting spectra to a single
reaction yield or ratio as function of time-of-flight
(or neutron energy), introduces off-diagonal covariance
elements. While the full covariance matrix of a yield
consisting of several thousands of data points becomes
too large too report directly in EXFOR, it is sometimes

more convenient to use a vectorized covariance matrix
reflecting the full data reduction process [40]. For smaller
datasets on the contrary it is very instructive to access
the full covariance matrix of a measured spectrum as for
example nicely illustrated in Refs. [41,42]. Nevertheless,
when the correlations introduced by the data reduction
are small compared to certain common uncertainties, for
example related to sample mass or normalization, it may
be sufficient to report only these uncertainties separately
as ”systematic” uncertainties. In any case, in order to make
the data in EXFOR useful for evaluations, the description
of the experimental details should be as complete as
possible [43]. Data submission of n TOF measurements
to EXFOR, which is crucial for its consideration in
evaluations, is an ongoing process [44]. A comprehensive
list of n TOF data dissemination is maintained on a
webpage [45].

5. Conclusion
The key features for accurate neutron measurements
at the n TOF facility with its two beam lines and
experimental areas EAR1 and EAR2 are the large
energy range, high neutron-energy resolution, and the
high instantaneous neutron flux. EAR2 with its about
25 times higher flux than in EAR1, combined with an
additional reduction by a factor 10 of the background due
to the sample’s radioactivity, significantly enhances the
possible measurements on unstable targets at n TOF. The
preparation and characterization of such targets suitable
for neutron cross-section measurements is an increasingly
complicated task, feasible only in highly specialized
laboratories.

The measurements at CERN’s neutron time-of-flight
facility n TOF with its unique features contribute sub-
stantially to our knowledge of neutron-induced reactions.
This goes together with cutting-edge developments in
detector technology and analysis techniques, design of
challenging experiments, and training of a new generation
of physicists working in neutron physics. This work has
been actively supported since the beginning of n TOF by
the European Framework Programmes [46]. One of the
future developments currently being studied is a possible
upgrade of the spallation target in order to optimize the
characteristics of the neutron beam in EAR2. The n TOF
collaboration, consisting of about 150 researchers from 40
institutes, continues its scientific programme in both EAR1
and EAR2, in this way continuing its 15 years history of
measuring high-quality neutron-induced reaction data.
