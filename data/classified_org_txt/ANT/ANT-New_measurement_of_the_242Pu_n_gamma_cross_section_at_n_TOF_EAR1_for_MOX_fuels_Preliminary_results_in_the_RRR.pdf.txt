Abstract. The spent fuel of current nuclear reactors contains fissile plutonium isotopes that can be combined
with 238U to make mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. In this way the Pu from spent fuel is used in a new reactor
cycle, contributing to the long-term sustainability of nuclear energy. The use of MOX fuels in thermal and
fast reactors requires accurate capture and fission cross sections. For the particular case of 242Pu, the previous
neutron capture cross section measurements were made in the 70’s, providing an uncertainty of about 35% in
the keV region. In this context, the Nuclear Energy Agency recommends in its “High Priority Request List”
and its report WPEC-26 that the capture cross section of 242Pu should be measured with an accuracy of at
least 7–12% in the neutron energy range between 500 eV and 500 keV. This work presents a brief description
of the measurement performed at n TOF-EAR1, the data reduction process and the first ToF capture
measurement on this isotope in the last 40 years, providing preliminary individual resonance parameters
beyond the current energy limits in the evaluations, as well as a preliminary set of average resonance
parameters.

1. Introduction and motivation

The measurement of accurate capture and fission cross
sections is essential for the design and operation of
innovative nuclear systems aimed at the reduction of the
nuclear waste [1]. The spent fuel from current nuclear
reactors contains a significant fraction of plutonium, which
can be separated from the fuel matrix and combined
with depleted uranium (238U) to make what is known as
mixed oxide (MOX) fuel [2], contributing therefore to
the long-term sustainability of nuclear energy. Currently,
the use of MOX fuel in thermal power reactors has been
established in several countries. However, a much more
efficient use of plutonium will ultimately be made in fast
reactors, where multiple recycling is possible and has been
demonstrated [2]. The extensive use of MOX fuels in fast
reactors calls for a revision of the neutron cross sections
that play a role in the neutronics of such reactors and are
not known with enough accuracy yet. For the particular
case of 242Pu, both the uncertainties in the experimental
data and the discrepancies in the average resonance
parameters between the optical model calculations and the
statistical analysis of s-wave resonances, call for a new
measurement of the capture cross section. The reader is
referred to Ref. [3] for a more detailed description of the
motivations.

Following the suggestion of the NEA in its High
Priority Request List [4], a new measurement of the
242Pu cross section at the n TOF facility was proposed
and approved by the CERN ISOLDE and Neutron Time-
of-Flight Committee (INTC) [5] and the experiment
was succesfully performed in summer 2015. In the
following section we briefly describe the n TOF facility,
the experimental setup and the 242Pu target and in Sect. 3
the main features of the measuring technique and the
steps involved in the data reduction process. Last, the
preliminary analysis in the Resolved Resonance Region
(RRR) is presented in Sect. 4.

2. Measurement at n TOF-EAR1:
Detectors and 242Pu sample
The pulsed neutron beam at n TOF is generated through
spallation of 20 GeV/c protons from the CERN Proton
Synchroton (CPS) impinging on a thick lead target. Each
proton bunch contains, on average, 7·1012 protons with
a time distribution of σ = 7 ns and an average repetition
rate of 0.17 Hz. The spallation neutrons, with energies in
the MeV-GeV range, are partially moderated in the water
cooling and moderation layers around the lead target and
travel towards the experimental areas along two beam
lines: EAR1 [6] at 185 m (horizontal) and EAR2 [7] at
19 m (vertical). The measurement presented in this work
was performed in EAR1, featuring a better time resolution
and consequently a better capability to resolve resonances
up to higher neutron energies than in EAR2.

Neutrons coming from the spallation target, travel
185 m in vacuum along the beam line until they reach
the 242Pu sample, with a diameter (45 mm) larger than the
beam. The sample consisted on 95 mg of more than 99%
pure 242Pu electrodeposited on a series of seven thin back-
ings and was prepared within the CHANDA project [10]
by the University of Mainz and the HZDR research center.

An array of four Total Energy detectors (BICRON)
deuterized benzene (C6D6) scintillators [8]) was used in
this measurement. These detectors have been chosen for
this measurement mainly because they suffer significantly
less from the so-called γ -flash than the n TOF TAC [9],
thus allowing us to measure up to the required neutron
energy, and a much lower neutron sensitivity than the latter.
More details on the experimental setup, sample preparation
and data acquisition system are given in Ref. [3].

3. Data reduction
A detailed explanation of the data reduction process is out
of the scope of this paper and in the following we just
highlight the main steps of the analysis. First, the initially

measured quantities are counting rates as a function of
time-of-flight (ToF). In order to reconstruct the neutron
energy En (eV) the following non-relativistic time-to-
energy relation is used

En =
(

72.29
L0 + λ(En)

T oF

)2
,

where L0 (m) is the flight path from the target exit to
the experimental, T oF is expressed in µs and λ(En)
(m) is the time-of-flight resolution function, an energy-
dependent equivalent moderation lenght in the target-
moderator assembly that takes into account for the non-
univocal relation between production time and neutron
energy, obtained from the simulations of the n TOF
spallation target [11].

Neutron capture measurements with C6D6 detectors
are analyzed following the Total Energy Detection
Technique (TED) [12,13]. This technique is based on
detecting just one γ -ray per cascade with an efficiency (εi )
proportional to its energy (Ei ), so that the overall efficiency
for a capture cascade is, assuming (Ei ) sufficiently small,
εc ∝

∑
i Ei ∝ Ec, proportional to total cascade energy and

independent of the actual cascade path. C6D6 detectors
in this setup feature low efficiencies (∼ 1% for 1 MeV)
γ -rays. However, they do not fulfill εi ∝ Ei . Therefore,the
Pulse Height Weighting Technique (PHWT) is used to
weight each count with an energy (pulse height) factor
so that this condition is fulfilled. This technique requires
a good knowledge of the detector response to γ -rays in
the energy range typical of capture cascades, i.e., up to
10 MeV. Monte Carlo simulations, performed in this work
using the Geant4 toolkit [14], are the best solution. (See
Ref. [3] for more details).

The total weighted counts include also several
background components, that must be substracted. These
are determined with the help of several ancilliary
measurements, shown in Fig. 1: the dummy sample is
a replica of the 242Pu assembly without 242Pu deposits
inside and is causing the main neutron related background
component. In addition, we also have to consider the
beam-offbackground with and without the 242Pu targets
in place. Last, the scattering in the target of in-beam
γ -rays, produced along with neutrons in the spallation
target, also contribute to the background, especially for
targets with a high atomic number. The latter is estimated
with help of a Pb target, featuring a high atomic number
and a negligible capture cross section. The counting rate
measured with the lead sample in place is scaled to the
242Pu sample according to the result of Geant4 simulations
aimed at studying the background induced by in-beam γ -
rays scattered in both, Pb and Pu, targets.

Last, to extract the neutron capture yield,

Yexp(En) =
fc

fSRM
· Cw(En) − Bw(En)

�(En) · ε
,

the background-substracted counting rate Cw − Bw is
divided by the measured neutron flux � of n TOF-EAR1
[15]; and the efficiency which, by construction of the TED,
is given by ε = Sn + En . Two extra correction factors are
applied: fc is a factor that corrects for the counts lost below
the amplitude threshold, the multiple detection of photons
and the presence of conversion electrons; and fSRM is

the absolute normalization factor obtained through the
Saturated Resonance Method applied to the first resonance
of 197Au, shown in Fig. 1 (right pannel).

4. Preliminary resonance analysis (up to
2.4 keV)
Once the normalized capture yield is obtained, the
resonance analysis has been completed using the SAMMY
code [16], which allows fitting experimental ToF data
to analytical cross sections generated using the Reich-
Moore approximation to the R-matrix theory, and takes
into account experimental effects such as the Doppler
broadening, the Resolution Function and the small
residual background. In our preliminary analysis, we
have identified 126 s-wave resonances between 1 eV and
2.4 keV. Figure 2 shows two different energy ranges of
the n TOF capture yield fitted with SAMMY compared to
the ENDF-VII [17] and JEFF-3.2 [18] cross sections. In
this figure one can appreciate the accumulated counting
statistics and the good energy resolution in our data
below 1 keV, which allows extracting individual resonance
parameters with high accuracy. In addition, 7 resonances,
such as the one at 14 eV present in the JEFF-3.2, can
be rejected according to our data, illustrating that the
input of these evaluations may contain resonances of other
isotopes. Last, many new resonances will be added to
the evaluations, especially in the high energy limit of the
Resolved Resonance Region, which has been extended
beyond the current limit in JEFF-3.2 and up to 2.4 keV.
This is illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 2. The
statistical analysis of the individual resonance parameters

leads to preliminary average resonance parameters. The
average level spacing is D0 = 14.8 ± 0.7 eV, which is in
good agreement with the value of 15.3 eV provided by
JEFF-3.2, smaller than the 16.8 eV sugessted by Reich
et al. [19] and 10% larger than the value given by
Mughabghab (ENDF-VII.1) and RIPL [20]. The extracted
value for the average radiative width 〈�γ 〉 = 24 ± 3 meV
is in agreement with all the values in the literature.
Finally, the neutron strenght function S0 = (0.89 ± 0.12) ·
10−4 follows the value suggested by Reich et al, which
pointed out that the evaluations could be overestimating
this parameter by 10%.

5. Outlook and complementary
measurements
The ToF measurement has successfully taken place at
n TOF-EAR1 using 95 mg of 99% pure 242Pu electrode-
posited on 7 thin aluminum backings. Preliminary results
of the capture yield, resonance analysis and average
resonance parameters up to 2.4 keV have been presented.
The analysis of the URR, where the background dominates
over the capture signals, is ongoing. The ToF measurement
will be complemented soon with a thermal capture cross
section measurement at the Budapest Research Reactor

(KFKI) [21] combining Activation and Prompt Gamma
Analysis. The cross section in the URR region that will be
obtained from the n TOF data will be complemented with
a measurement of the Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section
(MACS) at 30 keV using the new neutron line HISPANOS-
CNA [22] in Sevilla by means of the activation technique.

This measurement has received funding from the EC FP7
Programme under the projects NEUTANDALUS (Grant
No. 334315) and CHANDA (Grant No. 605203), and the Spanish
Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness projects FPA2013-
45083-P and FPA2014-53290-C2-2-P.
