Abstract. The CERN n TOF neutron beam facility is characterized by a very high instantaneous neutron flux,
excellent TOF resolution at the 185 m long flight path (EAR-1), low intrinsic background and coverage of a
wide range of neutron energies, from thermal to a few GeV. These characteristics provide a unique possibility
to perform high-accuracy measurements of neutron-induced reaction cross-sections and angular distributions
of interest for fundamental and applied Nuclear Physics. Since 2001, the n TOF Collaboration has collected
a wealth of high quality nuclear data relevant for nuclear astrophysics, nuclear reactor technology, nuclear
medicine, etc. The overall efficiency of the experimental program and the range of possible measurements has
been expanded with the construction of a second experimental area (EAR-2), located 20 m on the vertical of
the n TOF spallation target. This upgrade, which benefits from a neutron flux 30 times higher than in EAR-
1, provides a substantial extension in measurement capabilities, opening the possibility to collect data on
neutron cross-section of isotopes with short half-lives or available in very small amounts. This contribution
will outline the main characteristics of the n TOF facility, with special emphasis on the new experimental
area. In particular, we will discuss the innovative features of the EAR-2 neutron beam that make possible
to perform very challenging measurements on short-lived radioisotopes or sub-mg samples, out of reach up
to now at other neutron facilities around the world. Finally, the future perspectives of the facility will be
presented.

1. Introduction
The neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF at CERN [1,2]
is a pulsed white neutron source for high-accuracy neutron
cross-section measurements over a wide neutron energy
range. The neutrons are produced in a monolithic Pb-
spallation target, where a pulsed 20 GeV/c proton beam
provided by the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) [3]
impinges with a maximum repetition rate of 0.8 Hz. The
primary proton beam has a width of 7 ns rms. The Pb-target
is surrounded by an additional moderator layer to generate
a neutron beam with energies ranging from thermal up to
several GeV. At the facility in operation since 2000 the
measurements take place in an experimental area placed
at the end of a horizontal beamline, 200 m in length. The
experimental conditions and neutron beam characteristics
at this horizontal flight path are presented in full detail
in Ref. [4]. The horizontal 200 m flight path, with its
record instantaneous neutron beam intensity, has allowed
very important cross-sections to be measured, getting
unprecedented energy resolution in both neutron capture
[5,6] and fission [7] as well as extending the measurement
range to previously unreachable neutron energies [8].
However, there are more challenging experiments that
require an even more intense neutron beam.

To address the needs of data for short-lived ra-
dioisotopes, or for stable isotopes available in extremely
small amounts, the n TOF Collaboration proposed the
construction of a new experimental area (EAR-2) at a
shorter distance from the spallation target to exploit a much
higher neutron flux [9]. Since the spallation target is placed
underground at approximately 20 m under the surface, a
very convenient solution was to build the new experimental
area just on top of the pit hosting the target, in the vertical
direction.

The large gain in the neutron flux, of about a factor
of 30 relative to the first experimental area, allows one to
perform measurements with samples of correspondingly

smaller mass or in a shorter time. Most importantly, the
combination of the higher flux and shorter time-of-flight, a
factor of 10 relative to EAR-1, is particularly convenient
when measuring radioactive isotopes, as it results in an
increase of the signal-to-background ratio of more than
two orders of magnitude for the background related to
the radioactive decay of the sample. As a consequence,
in EAR-2 it becomes feasible to perform challenging
measurements with isotopes of half-life as short as a
few tens of years, offering the unique opportunity to
address some open questions in nuclear astrophysics, in
applications related to energy production, both from fission
and fusion, in nuclear medicine, in fundamental nuclear
physics, and in related fields.

With these goals in mind, the construction of the
second beam-line started at the beginning of a long
accelerator shut-down at CERN, in December 2012, and
was completed, with almost perfect timing, before the
restart of the PS accelerator, in July 2014.

2. EAR-2 neutron flux
The neutron flux is one of the most important features
of the n TOF facility not only for the characterization
of the experimental areas but also because it is
essential on the yield ascertainment for determining
the energy dependence of the neutron induced cross
section. Furthermore, the beam time requested in any
experiment proposed at n TOF relies on the precision
of the flux. In order to reach the desirable high
accuracy, a combination of three different neutron induced
reactions considered standards, for instance, 10B(n,α)7Li,
6Li(n,t)4He and 235U(n,f), is required to cover the wide
energy range of the n TOF neutron spectrum; in addition,
a combination of several detection systems based on
different working principle allows reducing the overall
uncertainties. Gaseous detectors as micromegas [10],
Parallel Plate Avalanche Chamber (PPAC) [11] and
Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) [12] as well
as solid state detectors like Silicon Monitor [13,14],

especially designed for monitoring purpose at n TOF, are
used. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the n TOF neutron
flux at EAR-1 (red) and EAR-2 (blue); highlighting the
main advantage of the new experimental facility EAR-2
respect to the existing one, i.e., the flux is two order of
magnitudes bigger in EAR-2 around 0.0253 eV besides
exhibiting a 30–40 times higher value in the rest of the
neutron energy range.

3. Two measurements demonstrating
the performance of EAR-2
3.1. 7Be(n,α)

The expanded measurement capability of the n TOF
facility has allowed to perform for the first time the
measurement of the 7Be(n,α) reaction cross-section in a
wide energy range. The reaction is of particular interest
in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and in particular
for the Cosmological Lithium Problem (CLiP): it refers
to the large discrepancy between the abundance of
primordial 7Li predicted by the standard theory of Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the value deduced from
the observation of galactic halo dwarf stars.

A possible solution in Nuclear Astrophysics is related
to the incorrect estimation of the destruction rate of
7Be, which is responsible for the production of 95% of
primordial Lithium. While the role of charged particle
induced reactions has mostly been ruled out by recent

during measurement.

measurements, data on the 7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) reactions
are scarce or completely missing, thus affecting the
abundance of 7Li predicted by the standard theory of Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis.

Recently, (n,α) and (n,p) reaction cross-sections have
been measured at n TOF-EAR-2 with two different silicon
detection systems, providing for the first time nuclear
data on the 7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) cross-section in a wide
neutron energy range, namely in the energy range of
interest for Nuclear Astrophysics.

In the case of the 7Be(n,α) 4He reaction, a sandwich
of two silicon detectors has been used to detect the
two alpha-particles that are emitted back-to-back with a
maximum energy of 9.5 MeV (the Q-value of the reaction
is 18.99 MeV).

Each sandwich hosted a target consisting of an
extremely thin backing (0.6 µm Polyethylene and 5 µm
Aluminum) with the nitrate solution of 7Be on one of
the surfaces, for a total activity of about 40 GBq. The
measurement relied on the coincident detection of the
two alpha particles emitted back-to-back in the reaction
with several MeV energy each, that ensured a strong
rejection of any other source of background (Fig. 3) and
allowing measuring the desired cross-section from 10 meV
to 10 keV.

The results of the n TOF measurement hint to a minor
role of the 7Be(n,α)4He reaction in BBN, leaving the
Cosmological Lithium Problem unsolved [17].

3.2. 240Pu(n,f)

The measurement of the 240Pu fission cross-section is
the first measurement to be performed at the newly
commissioned Experimental Area II of the CERN n TOF
facility. Data were collected from thermal energies up
to at least several MeV. Most notably, data showing
clear resonant structures have been obtained even
in the sub-threshold region (up to a few tens of
keV) where the cross-section is lowest and where
evaluations show a smooth behaviour of the cross-
section. The success of this measurement is largely due
to the favourable characteristics of EAR-2, in particular
the increased neutron flux and stronger background
suppression compared to EAR-1, where the measurement
was not feasible (see Fig. 4). These features will allow
n TOF to expand Its measurements capabilities to even

more short-lived and rare isotopes such as 230Th, 232U,
238,241Pu and 244Cm.

4. Conclusions
There is need of accurate new data on neutron cross-
section both for astrophysics and nuclear technology.
Since 2001, n TOF is contributing to the world efforts
aimed at collecting high quality data, mostly on
capture and fission. Main advantage of n TOF is the
high instantaneous neutron flux and high performance
detectors. The new EAR-2 offers the unique opportunity to
perform challenging measurements involving short-lived
radioisotopes or sub-mg samples.
