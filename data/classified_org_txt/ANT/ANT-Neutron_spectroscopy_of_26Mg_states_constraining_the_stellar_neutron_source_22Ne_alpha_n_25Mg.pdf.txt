This work reports on accurate, high-resolution measurements of the 25Mg(n, γ )26Mg and 25Mg(n, tot) 
cross sections in the neutron energy range from thermal to about 300 keV, leading to a significantly 
improved 25Mg(n, γ )26Mg parametrization. The relevant resonances for n+25Mg were characterized from 
a combined R-matrix analysis of the experimental data. This resulted in an unambiguous spin/parity 
assignment of the corresponding excited states in 26Mg. With this information experimental upper limits 
of the reaction rates for 22Ne(α, n)25Mg and 22Ne(α, γ )26Mg were established, potentially leading to a 
significantly higher (α, n)/(α, γ ) ratio than previously evaluated. The impact of these results has been 
studied for stellar models in the mass range 2 to 25 M�.

1. Introduction

The stellar nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron oc-
curs via neutron capture reactions and subsequent β decays. The 
so-called slow neutron capture process or s process [1] takes place 
in low and intermediate mass stars during their Asymptotic Giant 
Branch (AGB) phase. An additional s-process contribution comes 
in the helium-burning core and subsequent carbon-burning shell 
phases of massive stars. The 22Ne(α, n)25Mg reaction constitutes a 
major neutron source for the s process. In AGB stars, this source is 
activated during a series of convective He-shell burning episodes, 
so-called thermal pulses, with temperatures as high as 400 MK 
(more than 30 keV thermal energy). Although it contributes only 
about 5% to the total neutron budget, this scenario determines 
the final abundance pattern. Hence, it is decisive for deriving in-
formation on neutron density, temperature, and pressure in the 
He-burning layers of AGB stars [1]. In massive stars, where ther-
mal energies of 25 and 90 keV are reached during the He-core and 
C-shell burning phases, the neutron budget is by far dominated by 
the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg reaction.

The 22Ne(α, n)25Mg cross section in the temperature regime 
of the s process is affected by unknown resonance contributions. 
Also the competing 22Ne(α, γ )26Mg reaction, whose cross section 
is also insufficiently known, adds to the persistent uncertainty of 
the neutron budget and the associated neutron densities during 
stellar nucleosynthesis. The (α, γ ) reaction contributes to the de-
struction of 22Ne during the entire helium burning phase because 
of its positive Q -value of 10.615 MeV, already before the thresh-
old for neutron production via 22Ne(α, n)25Mg (Q = −478 keV) 
is reached. In this context, the 25Mg(n, γ )26Mg reaction plays a 
non-negligible role as well, because the high s abundance of 25Mg 
makes it a significant neutron poison for the s process. So far, this 
reaction rate is too uncertain for a quantitative assessment of the 
poisoning effect [2].
Experimental data for the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg cross section are es-
sentially limited to α energies above about 800 keV. At lower 
energies the most recent direct measurements [3–5] provided only 
an upper limit of about 10−11 barn, corresponding to the experi-
mental sensitivity. The lowest resonance observed in direct mea-
surements is at E Labα = 832 ± 2 keV (e.g. Ref. [4]).

2. Indirect approach

Since a direct approach is exceedingly difficult, indirect and 
transfer reactions were considered as an alternative way for con-
straining the reaction rate at low energies. For instance, the 
α-transfer reaction 22Ne(6Li, d)26Mg has been studied [5–7] to 
search for levels in 26Mg also below the neutron threshold at 
11.093 MeV. These studies are particularly relevant for estimating 
the 22Ne(α, γ )26Mg rate, where levels below and above the neu-
tron threshold are involved. Direct 22Ne(α, γ )26Mg measurements 
have only been carried out above 0.8 MeV. In view of the scarce 
experimental information, evaluations had, therefore, to rely on 
theoretical estimates. Accordingly, the uncertainties of the stellar 
22Ne(α, n)25Mg and 22Ne(α, γ ) rates are still dominated by un-
known properties of states in the compound nucleus 26Mg above 
the α threshold at 10.615 MeV.

As indicated in Fig. 1, these states can be studied via neu-
tron resonance spectroscopy of n+25Mg. In particular, a simulta-
neous resonance shape analysis of total and capture cross section 
data can be used to determine the resonance energies, E R , spin 
parities, Jπ , as well as the capture and neutron widths �γ and 
�n [8]. Information from previous 25Mg(n, γ )26Mg measurements 
suffers from considerable uncertainties due to sample problems 
and counting statistics. Moreover, the available transmission data 
have been obtained with natural Mg samples, a serious limitation 
in view of the dominant abundance of 24Mg in natural magne-

sium. The corresponding differences between present and previous 
transmission results are discussed in Ref. [9].

3. Measurements of n+25Mg

This work on n+25Mg combined two neutron time-of-flight 
measurements, using the CERN-n_TOF facility [10] for the (n, γ ) 
channel and the GELINA accelerator at IRMM/Geel [11] for the total 
cross section. To avoid the limitations of previous attempts, both 
measurements were carried out with highly enriched, metallic 
samples (97.87% 25Mg). The n_TOF facility, which provides a white 
neutron spectrum from thermal energy to about 1-GeV neutron 
energy, was chosen because it is particularly well suited for accu-
rate high-resolution neutron measurements due to its outstanding 
instantaneous neutron flux (about 106 neutrons per bunch at the 
experimental area) and the very long flight-path of 185 m. The 
experimental setup was based on two deuterated benzene (C6D6) 
scintillation detectors (cylindrical cells with an active volume of 
about 1 liter), placed on either side of the neutron beam, 9.0 cm 
upstream of the sample. These detectors are characterized by a 
very small neutron sensitivity. The chosen geometrical configura-
tion minimized the background due to scattered in-beam γ rays 
and reduced systematic effects due to the anisotropy in the an-
gular distribution from primary γ -rays following p-wave neutron 
resonances. The total number of neutrons impinging on the various 
samples used in the measurement was determined by means of a 
low-mass, 6Li-based, neutron detector [12], while the energy de-
pendence of the neutron flux derived from a dedicated study [13]. 
The well-established total energy detection principle in combina-
tion with the pulse height weighting technique [14] was applied 
to make the detection efficiency for a capture event directly pro-
portional to the total γ -ray energy available in the capture event. 
Moreover the saturated resonance technique [14] was used to nor-
malize the capture data. The measurement covered the energy 
range from thermal energy to about 300 keV with a resolution of 
0.05% to 0.3% in the relevant energy range between 1 and 300 keV.

The total cross section of n+25Mg was measured with a 6Li-
glass detector at the 50 m station of the GELINA facility for ener-
gies up to about 300 keV. A combination of Li-carbonate plus resin, 
Pb and Cu-collimators was used to reduce the neutron beam to a 
diameter of less than 35 mm at the sample position. The sam-
ple was placed in an automatic sample changer at a distance of 
23.78 m from the neutron source. Close to the sample position a 
10B anti-overlap filter was placed to absorb slow neutrons from a 
previous burst. In order to have a well-characterized measurement 
condition, permanent Na and Co black resonance filters [14] were 
used to continuously monitor the background at 2.85 keV and 
132 eV. Additional black resonance filters were used in dedicated 
runs. Thanks to the small dimensions of the neutron-producing 
target and the excellent time characteristic (1-ns pulse width), 
GELINA is particularly suited for high-resolution transmission mea-
surements in the keV region.

Essential improvements with respect to the previous capture 
measurement at n_TOF [2] are the quality of the highly enriched 
25Mg sample and a substantially reduced background of in-beam 
γ rays [10]. The total cross section measurement benefits also sig-
nificantly from the highly enriched sample. In both measurements 
the experimental background was determined in dedicated runs.

The data reduction for the determination of the cross section 
starting from detectors counting rate was performed following the 
procedures described in [14]. The capture yield (representing the 
fraction of the neutron beam undergoing capture events) obtained 
at n_TOF and the transmission (representing the fraction of neu-
tron beam that traverses the sample without interaction) from 
GELINA are presented in Fig. 2 and compared with the results of 
a simultaneous R-matrix analysis of both data sets. More in de-
tail, the experimental capture yield Y , deduced from the response 
of the capture detection system and the flux-monitor is related to 
the total and capture cross-sections, σtot and σγ respectively, by 
the following expression [14]:

Y (En) = (1 − e−nC σtot (En))
σγ (En)

σtot(En)
+ Y M S(En), (1)

while the transmission T , which was experimentally obtained 
from the ratio of Li-glass spectra resulting from a sample-in and 
a sample-out measurement, is related to the total cross-section 
by [14]:

T (En) = e−nT σtot (En), (2)
where nC = (3.012 ± 0.009) × 10−2 atoms/b denotes the areal den-
sity of the capture sample and nT = (5.02 ± 0.04) × 10−2 atoms/b 
the one of the transmission sample, En the laboratory neutron en-
ergy, and Y M S the contribution of multiple interaction in the sam-
ple. This latter term, together with other experimental effects such 
as self-shielding, Doppler broadening and response of the time-of-
flight spectrometer, are properly taken into account in the R-Matrix 
codes SAMMY [15] and REFIT [16] used in the present combined 
analysis.

4. Improved 25Mg(n, γ )26Mg cross section

Resonance energies, E R , partial widths, �γ and �n , and the 
spins and parities, Jπ were determined by a combined R-matrix 
analysis in the energy region En < 300 keV, corresponding to an 
incident α-particle energy from threshold at Eα = 570 keV to ap-
proximately 850 keV, where direct (α, n) measurements are diffi-
cult and accurate cross section data are missing.

The information on Jπ is particularly important for identifying 
the states in 26Mg that contribute to the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg cross sec-
tion. This selection is crucial because 22Ne nuclei and α particles 
have both Jπ = 0+ . Accordingly, (α, n) reactions can only pop-
ulate natural-parity states (0+, 1−, 2+, . . .) in 26Mg, whereas the 
n+25Mg reaction proceeds also via Jπ = 1+, 2−, 3+, . . . states.

The results of the combined R-matrix analysis of both cross 
sections are summarized in Table 1, including the deduced firm 
Jπ assignments. For the natural-parity states, the α energies in 
the laboratory system E Labα are given in column 3 for comparison

with direct α+22Ne measurements. The uncertainties on Ex and 
E Labα are determined by the uncertainty in neutron energy, which 
never exceeds 0.1 keV. This is an important result in itself be-
cause it allows one to resolve inconsistencies in charged-particle 
data.

Fig. 3 demonstrates the sensitivity of the present data to spin 
and parity, which clearly exclude the previous Jπ = 4− assign-
ment [17] for the neutron resonance at 194 keV. In particular, the 
lowest values of the chi-squared per number of degrees of free-
dom of the fit, were 1.1, 5.6, 7.3 and 17 assuming Jπ = 3− , 4+ , 
4− and 3+ respectively. In this manner the Jπ values were deter-
mined for each resonance. In two cases the spin-parity assignment 
was changed with respect to the previous evaluation. As shown in 
Ref. [9], these two resonances could not be accurately studied by 
using the transmission data on natural magnesium (e.g. reported 
in [17]) since the experimental signature was dominated by strong 
resonances in n+24Mg.

Compared to evaluated resonance data [18], six neutron reso-
nances had to be removed in the energy range covered in Table 1. 
These weak resonances (�n ≈ 0.5 eV) were assigned in previous 
n+25Mg experiments, but were not identified in this work.

a Parity change with respect to previous evaluations.

Below the lowest directly observed resonance in the
22Ne(α, n)25Mg reaction cross-section at E Labα ≈ 830 keV (En ≈
235 keV), five natural-parity states have been identified corre-
sponding to energies E Labα = 589, 649, 656, 779 and 786 keV. 
The doublets at 649/656 and 779/786 keV were resolved owing 
to the good energy resolution in the neutron channel, which is 
significantly better than in charged-particle experiments. The low-
est observed 22Ne(α, n)25Mg resonance at E Labα = 832 ± 2 keV [4]
was not observed in the present neutron data at En = 234 keV, 
while a resonance with a width compatible to the one reported 
in [4] (� = 250 ± 170 eV) is located at En = 243.98 keV, i.e.
E Labα = 843 keV. One possible explanation is that the two res-
onances correspond to the same state, in which case the en-
ergies are inconsistent with each other. Another possibility is 
that they correspond to two different levels: in this case the 
width of the (α, n) resonance at 832 keV is lower than quoted 
in [4], being below the sensitivity of the present measurements 
(� ≈ 20 eV), while the observed neutron level is not a natural par-
ity state.

The 25Mg(n, γ )26Mg cross section was also significantly im-
proved by an R-matrix analysis of the combined data sets for 
25Mg(n, γ ) and (n, tot), resulting in rather accurate Maxwellian av-
eraged cross section (MACS) for thermal energies between kT =
5 and 100 keV. Though higher resonances up to 900 keV were con-
sidered as well, the MACS values are dominated by contributions 
from the resonances in Table 1. The present results and the cur-
rently recommended values in the KADoNiS [22] compilation and 
in Ref. [2] are compared in Table 2. While the new MACS values 
are compatible with the previous measurement [2] except for the 
lowest and highest temperature, the uncertainties were reduced 
by almost a factor of three on average. These uncertainties are the 
sum of uncorrelated or statistical uncertainties and systematic un-
certainties.

5. Impact on reaction rate calculations

As mentioned above, the reaction channels for α+22Ne and 
n+25Mg open at excitation energies Ex = 10.615 and 11.093 MeV 
in the compound nucleus 26Mg. Apart from the levels between α-
and n-channel, the present study provides access to the relevant 
states in the energy region between the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg thresh-
old and the lowest resonance reached in direct α+22Ne experi-
ments. Therefore the new resonance information has been used 
for calculating the upper limit of the reaction rates, based purely 
on experimentally-available information for 22Ne(α, n)25Mg and

22Ne(α, γ )26Mg. In particular, they were defined using: (i) data 
from an α-transfer reaction for the resonance below the neutron 
threshold [7], (ii) data from this work, and (iii) data from direct 
measurements above E Labα = 800 keV [4]. The calculation, based on 
the simple narrow-resonance formalism [23], requires as input the 
resonance energies and the so-called kernels (also referred to as 
resonance strength), kn or kγ ,

where � is the total width and g = (2 J + 1)/[(2I + 1)(2i + 1)] the 
statistical factor and J , I and i the spin of the resonance, target 
and projectile, respectively. Because �α � �γ � �n , the kernels 
can be reduced to kn = g�α .

Apart from �α , all quantities were determined in this work. For 
the present analysis we estimated the upper limits of �α based on 
the experimental constraint on the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg cross section 
(≤ 10−11 barn, corresponding to �α ≈ 10−8 eV).

The contributions of the five resonances below E Labα ≈ 800 keV
to the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg rate depend on the temperature of the spe-
cific s-process site. Particularly important is the 30% decrease of 
the upper limit of the rate compared to Ref. [7] around kT =
25 keV (0.25 to 0.3 GK in Fig. 4), which affects the neutron econ-
omy during the He shell burning in low-mass AGB stars and during 
core He burning in massive stars.

The neutron resonance data obtained in this work were also 
used to determine the upper limit of the 22Ne(α, γ )26Mg rate. 
As shown in Fig. 4, these results differ significantly compared 
to recent evaluations [7,19,20], also in the important tempera-
ture range above 0.3 GK. Part of these discrepancies were caused 
by a misinterpretation of previous neutron data, in particular for 
the doublet at En = 79 keV. While the impact of the 79-keV 
doublet on the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg rate is relatively small (at most 
3%), it plays a major role for the (α, γ ) rate. As discussed in 
Ref. [7], α-transfer measurements provide experimental evidence 
of a natural parity state in 26Mg corresponding to an energy of 
about En = 80 keV. Prior to this measurement the resonance at 
En = 79 keV was tentatively assigned to be of unnatural par-
ity whereas the closest resonance at En = 81 keV was consid-
ered as the one with natural parity. This misinterpretation re-
sulted in a biased 22Ne(α, γ )26Mg reaction rate, since the reso-
nance strength of the (α, γ ) channel scales with the �n/�γ ra-
tio (see Eq. (3)). With the present spin-parity assignment, the 
contribution to the reaction rate of this level became negligi-
ble since the �n/�γ ratio of the resonance at En = 79 keV is 
about a factor of 2200 larger than the ratio of the resonance at 
En = 81 keV.

In summary, the present resonance analysis of the neutron-
induced cross sections of 25Mg has led to decisive improvements 
for the poorly known states in 26Mg with excitation energies be-
tween 11112 and 11344 keV. This concerns accurate level energies, 
firm spin/parity assignments, and the determination of reliable �γ
and �n values. The conclusive identification of their properties 
were used to determine the contributions of levels below the en-
Fig. 4. Reaction rate ratio of the upper limits for the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg (top panel) 
from this work compared to the upper limits in Refs. [7,20,19]. The same ratios are 
presented for the 22Ne(α, γ )26Mg (bottom panel). Below 0.3 GK the present data 
are indicating an enhanced (α, n) rate, whereas the (α, γ ) rate is strongly reduced 
above that temperature. (Color online.)

ergy range covered by direct (α, n) measurements. While waiting 
for the crucial estimate of �α , which will require a large experi-
mental effort, the present results can lead to improvements in the 
calculation of the stellar 22Ne+α rates in the astrophysically rele-
vant energy range substantially. In particular, it was found that the 
(α, γ ) channel had been strongly overestimated so far. The present 
results are summarized in Table 3.

6. Astrophysical implications and conclusions

The astrophysical consequences of the present results have been 
studied using the upper limits established in this work. Their im-
pact on the weak-s process in massive stars was explored for a 
25 M� [21] star. The calculated abundances are consistent with the 
latest evaluations [7,19]. The present uncertainty of the α+22Ne 
rate causes large differences in the weak s-process abundances, up 
to a factor 50 in the Sr region.

Noticeable changes are also found in intermediate-mass AGB 
models (IMS-AGBs, 3 < M/M� < 7). As in these stars higher tem-
peratures are reached during thermal pulses than in low-mass AGB 
stars, the strong preponderance of the 13C(α, n)16O neutron source 
is progressively substituted by the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg reaction. This is 
particularly evident at low metallicities.

Using the present upper limits for the 22Ne(α, n) rates, the 
s-process yields of AGB stars between 2 and 5 M� and an ini-
tial iron fraction corresponding to 0.7% of the solar value were 
calculated for comparison with reference AGB models from the 
FRUITY data base [24]. The resulting s abundances of Y and La 
were selected for comparison with Pb, because Y and La are char-
acterizing the first and second s-process abundance peak. As il-
lustrated in Fig. 5 the production of Y and – especially – of La is 
increasing with AGB mass as a consequence of the more efficient 
22Ne(α, n)25Mg source, whereas the Pb abundance remains basi-
cally frozen. For a fixed amount of Pb we obtain, therefore, larger 
abundances in the first and, especially, in the second s-process 
peak. This pattern in higher-mass stars may help to explain the 
surface distributions in s-process enriched globular cluster stars, 
which exhibit a comparably low Pb abundance [25]. Whether a 
mix of enhanced s contributions from IMS-AGBs at the expense of 
the Pb producing LMS-AGBs could provide a plausible solution will 
be analyzed in a dedicated paper.
