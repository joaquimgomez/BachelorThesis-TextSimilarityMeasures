Abstract

Actual and future nuclear technologies require more accurate nuclear data on
the (n,γ) cross sections and α-ratios of fissile isotopes. Their measurement
presents several difficulties, mainly related to the strong fission γ-ray back-
ground competing with the weaker γ-ray cascades used as the experimental
signature of the (n,γ) process. A specific setup has been used at the CERN
n_TOF facility in 2012 for the measurement of the (n,γ) cross section and α-
ratios of fissile isotopes and used for the case of the 235U isotope. The setup
consists in a set of micromegas fission detectors surrounding 235U samples and
placed inside the segmented BaF2 Total Absorption Calorimeter.

1 Introduction
Nuclear data on neutron-induced capture and fission cross-sections are necessary for improving the de-
sign and performance of advanced nuclear reactors and transmutation devices for the incineration of
radioactive nuclear waste [1, 2]. The actual nuclear data priorities are summarized in the High Priority
Request List [3] of the Nuclear Energy Agency, where the capure cross sections of four fissile isotopes
has been included: 233,235U and 239,241Pu. The difficulty of these measurements is that the detection of
the capture reactions is performed by detecting the capture γ-rays, which in this case competes with the
fission γ-ray background.

We have measured the 235U(n,γ) cross section at the n_TOF facility [4, 5] with the Total Ab-
sorption Calorimeter (TAC) [6] and fission micromegas detectors (FTMGAS) [7]. Here we describe the
experimental setup used and the first preliminary results.

2 The experimental setup
The CERN n_TOF neutron time-of-flight (TOF) facility delivers a neutron beam generated in spallation
reactions induced by a 20 GeV/c pulsed proton beam of 7 ·1012 protons per pulse and with 16 ns FWHM
time resolution. The spallation target is a cylindrical lead block with 60 cm diameter and 40 cm length.
The neutrons are moderated in a 4 cm thick borated water layer before traveling 185 m in vacuum until
reaching the experimental area, where the measured samples and the detectors are placed.

We used 10 isotopically enriched samples of 235U3O8 produced at IRMM Geel. They have around
300µg/cm2 surface density, and are deposited on 20 µm thick aluminum backings. They have a diameter
of 42 mm, thus covering the entire neutron beam profile.

The (n,γ) reactions were measured with the Total Absorption Calorimeter, which is a segmented
array composed by 40 BaF2 crystals of 15 cm in length and covering 95% of the 4π solid angle. This
detector is used to measure neutron capture cross sections by detecting in coincidence (nearly) all the
γ-rays forming the cascades de-exciting the compound nucleus after the neutron capture reactions. The



fission reactions were measured with micromegas detectors, operated with a gas mixture of Ar 88%,
CF4 10% and isobutane 2% at 1 atm. All the sigals induced in the TAC and in the FTMGAS detectors
were recorded by high-performance digitizers (Acqiris-DC270) with 8 bits resolution, operated at 250
MSamples/s and recording for each neutron pulse 32 ms long data buffers which contain the entire
digitized electronic response of each individual detector [8].

The measurement was performed with the samples and the FTMGAS placed in the center of the
TAC, surrounded by a 5 cm thick shperical neutron absorber shell made of borated polyethylene, used
to reduce the background of scattered neutrons. This setup can be seen in Fig. 1. Two different fission
configurations were used, based on 2 and 10 fission tagging micromegas detectors.

Fig. 1: Experimental setup of the 235U(n,γ) cross section measurement. The 235U samples and the FTMGAS are
placed in the center of the TAC, which appears opened in two semispheres in the picture, surrounded by a neutron
absorber.

The configuration with the 2 FTMGAS was dedicated to the 235U(n,γ) cross section measurement.
A stack of 8 bare 235U samples and two samples encapsulated inside the FTMGAS were placed in the
beam for improving the signal to background ratio (i.e. to minimize the amount of dead material from
the fission tagging setup in the neutron beam). A low fission tagging efficiency of ∼20% was achieved.
As it has been demonstrated in [9], it is possible to remove accurately the gated fission γ-ray background
at low tagging efficiencies by selecting events with a high γ-ray multiplicity which correspond only to
(n,f) γ-rays and for which the TAC has a nearly 100% detection efficiency. Indeed, a simplified version
of this technique, without any fission tagging, has been used as well at LANL in a 235U cross section
measurement [10]. The option of having fission tagging capabilities at a low efficiency has been preferred
for the measurement at n_TOF for deducing the normalization of the data strictly from experimental
parameters, without the need of a using evaluated cross section data as an external reference.

The configuration with the 10 FTMGAS was dedicated the 235U(n,f)/235U(n,γ) ratio (α-ratio)
for well resolved resonances, as a cross check for the 2 FTMGAS data and for the measurement of γ-
ray energy distributions from the lowest lying resonances. Each sample was inserted in a FTMG for
measuring the fission cross section with a high efficiency (∼90%) at the price of having a much larger
dead material (i.e. background) than with the 2 FTMGAS configuration.

In both cases, dedicated background measurements with the same experimental setup but without
the 235U layers were performed, including all the dead material layers intercepting the neutron beam.
Additional measurements with a 197Au sample (capture cross section reference) and a carbon scatterer
foil (for determining the neutron sensitivity) were also performed.

3 Preliminary analysis
The TAC measures in coincidence the γ-rays emitted after the capture reactions. The individual signals
are grouped into TAC events, using a time coincidence window of 20 ns. Each TAC event is charac-
terized by its time-of-flight, the total energy deposited (Esum) and the crystal multiplicity (mcr), which
is the number of detectors contributing to the event above a given threshold. Conditions are applied to
the detected events in Esum and mcr in order to improve the capture signal over background ratio. A
coincidence analysis is also performed between the fission events detected by the FTMGAS and the TAC
events. If a TAC event is in coincidence with a FTMGAS event, it is tagged as a fission event. The tag-
ging efficiency can be calculated from the ratio of counts in the TAC in coincidence with the micromegas
to the total number of counts in the TAC, for very restrictive conditions in the TAC events (high Esum and
high mcr) which guarantee that the TAC event is a fission event. The preliminary values obtained for the
tagging efficiency are 19.4(4)% and 90.0(3)%, for the 2 FTMGAS and the 10 FTMGAS configurations,
respectively.

Examples of deposited energy spectra in the TAC are presented in Fig. 2, where two different
backgrounds are presented. The one in blue (“Background”) has been obtained from the dedicated
background measurements (dummy assemblies and measurements without beam), and does not include
the background due to fission reactions in 235U. The one in magenta (“Fission”) is the background due
to fission in 235U, and it has been obtained from the tagged events scaled by the inverse of the tagging
efficiency.

Fig. 2: Deposited energy spectra in the TAC corresponding to the 235U(n,γ) measurement (red), the backround
excluding fission (blue), the fission events (magenta), and the capture events (black). All the spectra correspond to
TAC events with mcr>2, and neutron energies between 1 and 10 eV. The results corresponding to the 2 FTMGAS
configuration are presented in the left panel and the results corresponding to the 10 FTMGAS configuration in the
right panel.

A preliminary experimental capture (x = γ) and fission (x = f ) cross-sections have been calcu-
lated for each configuration with:

σ(n,x) =

nat

Cx(En) −Bx(En)
�x · Φ(En)

. (1)

where Cx, Bx, and �x are the counting rate, background and detection efficiency of the TAC and
the micromegas, respectively, and Φ(En) is the neutron energy fluence distribution.

A (very preliminary) cross sections have been obtained in this way, and are presented in Fig. 3 to
Fig. 8. They have been normalized to the cross sections available in the ENDF/B-VII.0 library [11] in
the 0.2-10 eV neutron energy range
