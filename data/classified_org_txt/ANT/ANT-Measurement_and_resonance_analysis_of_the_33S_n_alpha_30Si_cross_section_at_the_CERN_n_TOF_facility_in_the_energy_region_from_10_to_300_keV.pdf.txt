The 33S(n,α)30Si cross section has been measured at the neutron time-of-flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN in the
neutron energy range from 10 to 300 keV relative to the 10B(n,α)7Li cross-section standard. Both reactions were
measured simultaneously with a set of micromegas detectors. The flight path of 185 m has allowed us to obtain
the cross section with high-energy resolution. An accurate description of the resonances has been performed by
means of the multilevel multichannel R-matrix code SAMMY. The results show a significantly higher area of the
biggest resonance (13.45 keV) than the unique high-resolution (n,α) measurement. The new parametrization of
the 13.45-keV resonance is similar to that of the unique transmission measurement. This resonance is a matter of
research in neutron-capture therapy. The 33S(n,α)30Si cross section has been studied in previous works because
of its role in the production of 36S in stars, which is currently overproduced in stellar models compared to
observations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The 33S(n,α) 30Si reaction combines simultaneously the
properties of a low-mass stable isotope with a high-Q value
(3.5 MeV) for neutron-induced ion emission and a high cross-
section due to the resonances present in the keV region.
These interesting properties were pointed out in Ref. [1] for
its possible application to radiotherapy with neutrons and a
specific target inserted in the tumor tissue. This technique is
known as BNCT (boron neutron-capture therapy) because 10B
has been so far the target for neutrons in the experimental
treatments of tumors, all of them performed at nuclear reactors
[2]. Forthcoming accelerator-based neutron-capture therapy
facilities will deliver neutrons in the epithermal energy range
(a few killoelectron volts); therefore such neutron beams could
also deliver a significant dose in the first centimeters of tissue,
before the neutrons are thermalized, if an adequate compound
containing 33S is absorbed in the tissue. The conceptual use of
33S in BNCT for superficial tumors or tumors growing towards
the skin was studied with the simulation of the dose transferred
to ICRU tissue [3,4].

One of the key points for a reliable simulation of the dose
delivered by the 33S(n,α) 30Si reaction, and consequently its
possible use in BNCT with epithermal neutron beams, is the
value of the cross section at the first and most important
resonance (at En = 13.45 keV) or equivalently its description
by means of resonance parameters. There are only two avail-
able measurements describing the cross section in terms of
resonance parameters: the transmission experiment performed
by Coddens et al. at ORELA [5] and the (n,α) measurement
of Wagemans et al. at GELINA [6]. Both works combined
their data and analysis; however, among others, the two
data sets showed an important discrepancy: the transmission

measurement provided a value of the α width (�α) of the
13.45-keV resonance that is twice the value deduced from
(n,α) measurement as it was pointed out in both works [5,6].
The experiment performed at n_TOF aims at clarifying this
discrepancy. In addition, a complete description of the cross
section making use of the SAMMY code [7] will be provided.

Concerning the evaluated data, the main databases do not
show a resonance structure. In addition, there are two different
energy dependencies adopted for this cross section in the
evaluations, which do not match the scarce experimental data:
a constant value above thermal (i.e., ENDF/B-VII.1) and a
1/

√
E behavior between thermal and 5 keV followed by a rapid

increase of the cross section up to 30 keV (i.e., JEFF-3.2).
EAF-2010 is the only database showing a resonance structure
but with huge discrepancies with the available experimental
data [8].

The interest in the possible use of 33S in BNCT is quite
recent. In fact, the research carried out on 33S(n,α) 30Si has
originally been linked to nuclear astrophysics due to its role
in the origin of the neutron-rich isotope 36S, which remains an
open question. The experimental results of Wagemans et al.
[6] and Auchampaugh et al. [9] were applied to explosive
scenarios showing a 36S overproduction in the solar system
incompatible with the stellar models. Later, the s-process
contribution to the total 36S abundance was drastically reduced
by the 34S(n,γ ) reaction, which acts as a bottleneck because
of its very low stellar cross-section [10].

The present work describes the measurement of the
33S(n,α)30S cross section at the n_TOF facility at CERN in
the energy range from 10 to 300 keV. A detailed R-matrix
resonance analysis has been carried out to provide more
accurate data for future applications in BNCT and astrophysics.

MEASUREMENT AND RESONANCE ANALYSIS OF THE … PHYSICAL REVIEW C 97, 064603 (2018)

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. The n_TOF neutron beam at EAR1

The experiment was performed in the experimental area
1 (EAR1) of the n_TOF facility at CERN, located 185 m
from the neutron production target. The neutrons are generated
by the 20 GeV/c proton beam from the CERN PS (proton
synchrotron) impinging on a lead target. The measurement was
performed with a cooling-moderation configuration consisting
of demineralized water and borated water. The technical
features of the facility and the characteristics of the neutron
beam are described in detail in Refs. [11,12]. Concerning the
33S(n,α)30Si measurement, the most important characteristics
of the beam are the high resolution in neutron energy for an
accurate description of the resonances and the large aperture
of the beam, 8 cm in diameter, which allows the use of
large thin samples increasing the expected low-count rate.
The use of borated water as moderator minimizes neutron
capture on hydrogen, and hence the associated in-beam γ -ray
background in neutron-capture cross-section measurements.
The most important consequence for this measurement is a
strong reduction of the thermal peak in the neutron flux.

B. The samples

The production of thin sulfur samples is difficult because
sulfur adheres poorly to most materials and sublimates at
room temperature in a vacuum [6,9,13]. Previous experiments
reported problems related to 33S loss [6,9]. Six 33S samples
were prepared by the vacuum surface coatings (VSC) group of
the Technology Department at CERN. The method developed
for coating the samples was based on the thermal evaporation
of 33S powder on dedicated copper-plated Kapton foils to form
a stable compound. Samples 8 cm in diameter were produced
in order to take advantage of the largest neutron beam spot
and the highest fluence at EAR1 during the so-called fission
campaign. The characterization of the samples was carried out
by means of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) at
the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (Spain) [14]. With this
technique it is possible to achieve a precise determination of the
number of atoms with low uncertainty. A monoenergetic beam
of 3.5-MeV 4He++ ions was used and each sample was scanned
from one edge to the other passing through the center. Several
RBS measurements and analyses were performed before and
after the experiment, and the conclusion was that no sulfur
was lost under high vacuum or in contact with different gases
at atmospheric pressure; therefore, the samples showed an
excellent adherence and stability. A detailed discussion on the
preparation and characterization of the samples can be found
in Ref. [15]. Table I summarizes the results for all the samples.

The 10B(n,α) 7Li cross-section standard was use as refer-
ence in the present measurement. Differently from the 33S
sample, the production of 10B4C samples is done routinely in
different labs. The 10B4C sample used was also prepared by the
VSC group by dc magnetron sputtering. It was 8 cm in diameter
and it was irradiated in parallel with the 33S samples. The
thickness was determined by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), giving a value of (8.1 ± 0.2) × 10−6 atoms of 10B
atoms per barn.

C. Detector and acquisition

The measurement was performed with a micropattern
gaseous detector based on microbulk technology known as
micro mesh gaseous structure (Micromegas) [16]. The low-
mass, robustness, and neutron and γ transparency of this
technology permit the use of several in-beam detectors with
a minimal perturbation of the neutron beam [17]. The geomet-
rical efficiency is close to 50% if only one of the two reaction
products is detected, as was the case in the present experiment.
This kind of detector has been extensively used at n_TOF, for
instance, for monitoring purposes and flux determination [12].

The reaction chamber housed nine Micromegas (MGAS)
detectors for six 33S samples, two blank samples for back-
ground studies, all of them in back-to-back configuration, and
one 10B reference sample. In this way, systematic and statistical
uncertainties could be reduced. A blank sample is the substrate
of a 33S sample, copper-plated Kapton foil. The experiment
was carried out in the usual configuration of MGAS at n_TOF
[12], in which the electrons from the ionization of the gas
(88% Ar, 10% CF4, 2% iC4H10) at atmospheric pressure are
collected and the multiplication works as internal gain but
with no amplification of the electronic noise, ensuring a good
signal-to-noise ratio.

The signals from the MGAS were directly processed with
the standard n_TOF data acquisition system (DAQ) [18] based
on flash ADCs with a sampling rate up to 2 gigasamples per
second, 12 bit resolution, and 8 MBytes on-board memory.
For all detectors, the data were recorded for a time-of-flight
up to 50 ms, corresponding to nearly thermal neutron energy;
however, no data have been obtained below 10 keV in the
present experiment. The starting signal for determining the
time-of-flight of the neutrons was given by the prompt γ -flash
generated in the interaction of the 20 GeV/c proton beam with
the lead target.

III. DATA ANALYSIS

The signals from each MGAS detector were analyzed off-
line with a routine that extracted the baseline, the amplitude,
and the time of flight (TOF). Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of
the pulse height of the signals versus their TOF for a detector
facing a 33S sample. Few structures are resolved, and the signals
due to α particles are clearly above the noise and background.
For instance, the two structures around a flight time of 105 ns
correspond to resonances at 23.95 and 13.45 keV.

FIG. 1. Scatter plot of the signal amplitude in arbitrary units
(channels) versus TOF for a 33S sample.

As mentioned before, to study the background due to the
backing of the sample, two MGAS detectors were dedicated
to record the signals coming from two blank samples (no 33S).
Figure 2 shows the scatter plot of the pulse height versus
TOF for a blank sample. The comparison between Figs. 1 and
2 demonstrates that there was no appreciable contamination
around the resonance energies due to reactions in the sample
backing with amplitudes higher than channel ≈9. Therefore,
signals due to 33S could be separated by a threshold at channel
≈9, which depends on the energy range. The fraction of true
signals below the selected threshold has been recovered with
accurate fits of the pulse height histograms as will be explained
later. A possible contamination from 33S(n,p) 33P reactions
could be neglected because of the very low cross-section [6].

A. Cross-section determination

In the present work the 33S(n,α) 30Si cross section has been
determined relative to the 10B(n,α) 7Li, a neutron cross-section
standard in the energy range from 0.025 eV to 1 MeV [19].
Under the assumption of a thin target approximation the cross
section can be determined with the following expression:

σ33(E) = σ10(E)
Cα33(E)ε10(E)N10
Cα10(E)ε33(E)N33

. (1)

Here Cα is the number of counts due to α particles for both
reactions corrected for the background, noise, and dead time;
ε is the efficiency of the detector for each reaction that depends
on the geometry, the absorption of α particles in the sample,

and the kinematics of the considered reaction; and N is the
number of atoms per barn of 33S and 10B. In Eq. (1) it is
assumed that the neutron fluence is the same for both reactions.
In order to consider possible differences in the fluence seen by
each sample, the transmission factors of the neutrons through
all the materials (the most important are due to Kapton and
aluminum windows) were taken into account in the analysis.
Cα and ε depend on the energy. In the conversion from TOF
to energy the time-energy relation of the n_TOF beam was
considered. This function includes the effects of the neutron
production mechanisms and the moderation process with
the configuration of the moderation-cooling system [11,20].
Before the present experiment, an accurate determination of
the flight path was carried out via low-energy resonances of
the 235U(n,f ) reaction following the method explained in
Ref. [21].

The determination of the number of counts due to α particles
and the background subtraction is illustrated in Fig. 3, which
shows an experimental pulse height distribution (black points)
with statistical uncertainties in one of the MGAS detectors.
Several works have studied the distribution of pulse height in
MGAS detectors with different gases and particles concluding
that it can be described with a convolution of Landau and
Gaussian functions [22,23]. Figure 3 shows an example of
an experimental pulse height distribution and the fit with
Landau-Gauss functions performed in the present analysis. The
integration of the fit function provides the number of α particles
in the selected energy range. Signals due to background and
noise induced by the backing and the detector itself dominate
the number of counts for channels below channel 10. Indeed,
the point at channel 7 has a value of 2700 counts and the
points at channels 5 and 6, with much higher numbers of
counts, are not included for visualization purposes. Therefore,

064603-4



MEASUREMENT AND RESONANCE ANALYSIS OF THE … PHYSICAL REVIEW C 97, 064603 (2018)

we can conclude that the amplitude of the α-particles signals
appears from channels 0 to 50 and the amplitude of the
background signals appears only at low amplitudes. The same
was concluded from the comparison between Figs. 1 and 2.

The subtraction of the background has been performed
by making a selection of the α-particle signals. The vertical
dashed blue line would correspond to a horizontal cut in
the scatter plot of Fig. 1 at an amplitude slightly lower than
channel 10, which is considered the most adequate in the
selected energy range. This cut implies a loss in the number
of α particles from 0.75 to 1.5% depending on the selected
energy range, which are recovered by the integration of the
fitting function from channels 0 to 50. The dashed green line
corresponds to the amplitude threshold chosen for the detectors
in the DAQ during the experiment. This procedure was applied
in the whole energy range analyzed in the present work for all
the 33S samples. For the 10B reference, the determination of
the number of counts was identical to previous experiments at
n_TOF with a 10B4C sample and a MGAS detector [12].

B. Efficiency and dead time

The 33S(n,α) 30Si cross section has been determined relative
to the 10B(n,α) 7Li measured simultaneously with the same
kind of detectors housed in the same chamber and the same
analysis procedure and experimental conditions. In particular,
for both reactions the detected ions fully deposited their energy
in the gas of the MGAS detector. Also the calculation of the
loss of signals due to the subtraction of the background was
considered by means of the integration of the fit function of
the pulse height distributions. Therefore the correction for the
detector efficiency is reduced to the absorption in the samples
and the kinematics of each reaction.

Detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the energy loss, ab-
sorption, and scattering in the samples of the α particles from
33S(n,α) 30Si and 10B(n,α) 7Li reactions were performed by
means of MCNPX [24]. It was considered that the α particles
were uniformly distributed inside the samples. In the case of
the 10B4C sample the angular distribution of the α particles
of the reactions on 10B reported in Ref. [25] was taken into
account. For the 33S(n,α) 30Si reaction, it was assumed that
the α emission was isotropic in the center-of-mass system.
The validity of this assumption was checked by means of the
comparison between each pair of forward and backward 33S
samples. For each pair, the same yield was obtained for the
existing resonances, within uncertainties. Figure 4 shows the
efficiency in the forward direction obtained for both reactions
in the analyzed energy range. The increase in the efficiency
of 10B MGAS is due to the forward-peaked anisotropy of the
dominant channel, which produces 7Li in its first excited state,
above 100 keV [25].

For the present measurement, the characteristics of the
n_TOF-EAR1 facility reduce the possibility of dead-time and
pile-up problems. However, the intrinsic width of the MGAS
signals (250 ns) could produce a remaining very small dead-
time effect. Nevertheless, in the energy range analyzed in the
present experiment no significant dead time was found even for
the 10B(n,α) 7Li reaction, as in other experiments performed
at the n_TOF-EAR1 facility [12].

FIG. 4. Simulated efficiency for the detection of α particles emit-
ted in the forward direction with the MGAS detector configuration in
the present experiment.

C. Uncertainty

Here, the main sources of uncertainty and their relevance
are discussed with the aim of providing a conservative es-
timation of the accuracy of the present results. The major
sources of uncertainty were the masses of the 33S samples
and the statistical uncertainty of the data. As discussed in
Ref. [15], ≈9% relative uncertainty was obtained including the
small inhomogeneities in the mass distribution. Concerning
the normalization to the standard 10B(n,α) 7Li reaction, the
uncertainty in the cross section is lower than 1% below 180
keV [19]. The uncertainties related to the angular emission of
the α particles of the 10B(n,α) 7Li reaction can be neglected
because of the large angle covered by the MGAS detector
and the accurate angular distributions reported in Ref. [25].
Therefore, we assume an overall contribution of 4% due
to the normalization to the standard cross-section and the
uncertainties related to the 10B4C sample.

Another uncertainty component is caused by the detection
efficiency, which depends on the energy. The statistical uncer-
tainty in the simulations of theα-particle transport, discussed in
Sec. III B, was lower than 1%. The selected threshold for the
detectors and the cuts in the histograms of signal amplitude
supposed a signal loss, already discussed in Sec. III A. The
total number of signals due to α particles for both reactions
were determined by fitting the pulse height distributions of
the α-induced signals from channels 0 to 50. It is shown
in Fig. 3 that good fits can be achieved within the limits
of the statistical accuracy of the experimental data; for this
reason a 3% uncertainty in the fits has been assumed as a
conservative estimation. The uncertainties due to the neutron
beam attenuation or scattering in the aluminum windows of
the n_TOF tube, the Kapton windows of the MGAS chamber,
the MGAS detectors and the stack of samples are 1% [12].
The present experiment was performed with six 33S samples
to decrease the statistical uncertainty of the final result. Table II
summarizes the sources of uncertainty.

Sec. IV. The pointwise cross section from 10 to 300 keV will

IV. RESULTS

This experiment aimed at reducing possible sources of
uncertainties and to improve some issues related to the setup
and the analysis of previous measurements [6,9]. In the energy
range from 10 to 200 keV, previous (n,α) measurements used
as reference the 235U(n,f ) cross section [6,9], which for
neutron energies below 100 keV was standard only at thermal
energy. In both experiments, the reference cross section was not
measured simultaneously with 33S(n,α) 30Si. Regarding the
samples, Wagemans et al. reported important problems due
to the sulfur loss in a previous experiment that were solved
by sealing the sample in a formvar-sulfur-formvar sandwich
[13]. However, the mass of the sample was not measured
after the experiment. The reported masses were based on the
combination of the count rate under irradiation with a thermal
neutron beam, a nondestructive analysis, and a destructive
chemical analysis resulting in a mass uncertainty larger than
20% [13]. Also Auchampaugh et al. reported sulfur losses
during their experiment. A loss of one-third of the mass of
the sample was determined in a reactor a few days after the
experiment, making use of a thermal value of (140 ± 30) mb
for the 33S(n,α) 30Si cross section [9]. Wagemans et al. [6]
also used the thermal point, with a value of (115 ± 10) mb, for
obtaining the integrated area of the 13.45-keV resonance in
a measurement with low-energy resolution (short flight path).
Then, the final measurement, carried out using a longer flight
path, was normalized to the integrated area of the 13.45-keV
resonance obtained with the shorter flight path [6].

Some improvements in the present experiment are related
to the use of the 10B(n,α) 7Li cross section as the unique nor-
malization, which is a neutron standard in the whole measured
energy range. Moreover, the 33S(n,α) 30Si and 10B(n,α) 7Li
cross sections were simultaneously measured with the same
setup. In addition, the 33S samples were carefully characterized
before and after the experiment for checking their stability [15].
The 33S(n,α) 30S thermal cross section, which has scattered
values, was not been used.

Figure 5, left Y axis, shows the 33S(n,α) 30Si experimental
data obtained at n_TOF (black points) with Eq. (1). They are
named “Yield/(Areal Density) Broadened” instead of cross
section to emphasize they are still affected by the multiple

scattering, Doppler broadening, self-shielding, and resolution
function of the facility at EAR1. Figure 5, left Y axis, also
shows the n_TOF R-matrix fit of the experimental data (red
line), which is discussed in Sec. V. Figure 5, right Y axis, shows
the cross section at 300 K reconstructed from the resonance
parameters obtained with the n_TOF R-matrix fit (see Sec. V
and Table III).

From 10 to 300 keV, 11 resonant structures have been
found, which are also present in Wagemans et al. data [6] (we
refer to it as Geel following the nomenclature in Refs. [5]
and [6]). The analysis performed in Ref. [6], which was
combined with the analysis of Coddens et al. [5] (we refer
it as ORNL following the nomenclature in Refs. [5] and [6])
allowed the association of these structures with a total number
of 14 (n,α) resonances. The n_TOF analysis has provided
the same resonances with some differences that are briefly
discussed in the next paragraph. With regard to other (n,α)
measurements, Auchampaugh et al. [9] measured the (n,γ )
and (n,α) cross sections but they did not resolve the (n,α)
resonances. Koehler et al. [27] resolved some resonances at
LANSCE in an experiment with the aim of characterizing a
detector based on ZnS but the energy resolution was lower
than Wagemans et al. [6].

An important motivation of the present experiment was
to study the first known resonance, at a neutron energy
of 13.45 keV, due to the different description in terms of
resonance parameters provided by ORNL and Geel, although
they combined and shared their data and analysis [5,6]. The
n_TOF data show a stronger resonance than Geel in EXFOR
[26], specifically, the integrated area from 12.5 to 14.5 keV
is a factor 1.5 times that of Geel. As is be shown in Sec. V,
consistently the n_TOF parametrization does not agree with
Geel and does agree with ORNL for this resonance.

For the remaining resonances, the same value of the inte-
grated area as Geel within uncertainties has been obtained ex-
cept for those at 70.86 and 127.66 keV. The n_TOF resonance
at 70.86 keV shows a 1.8 times higher value of the integrated
area compared to the Geel value. However, it should be stressed
that close to the 70.86-keV resonance in the Geel data there
is a resonance at 67.8 keV [6,26], which does not appear in
our data in the capture measurement of Auchampaugh et al.
[9], or in the ORNL transmission measurement [5]. In fact, the
structure at 67.8 keV was not included as a resonance in the
combined analysis carried out by ORNL and Geel [5,6]. For
the resonance at 127.66 keV, a factor 1.9 times that of the Geel
value of the integrated area has been found.

V. R-MATRIX ANALYSIS

As mentioned before, the transmission experiment at ORNL
and the (n,α) experiment at Geel combined their data for
determining the resonance parameters (E, Jπ , �n, �α) up to
270 keV. The �γ values were obtained by ORNL from the
capture measurement of Auchampaugh et al. [9]. In the ORNL
analysis the determination of Jπ of each resonance was ex-
plained in detail and was assumed in the present analysis. The
Bayesian code SAMMY [7] in the Reich-Moore approximation
of the R-matrix theory was used for the analysis. As discussed
in Sec. III, the background was subtracted by means of cuts in

range. Then, accurate fits of the amplitude histograms were
performed for recovering the α-induced signal losses due to the
cuts. However, a better fit of the valleys between resonances
was achieved if a small constant background of 20 mb was
included in the SAMMY fit. The n_TOF experimental data or
yield/(areal density) broadened data, red points in Figs. 6 to
9, were fitted considering only statistical uncertainties. As
mentioned in Sec. IV, the experimental data are affected by

Doppler broadening, multiple scattering, self-shielding, and
resolution function. All these effects were included in the fit
with SAMMY for every set of parameters (ORNL, Geel, and
n_TOF). The normalization was fixed to 1.0. The potential
scattering was taken into account using a radius of 3.85 fm [5].

The procedure we followed was to describe the n_TOF
data from 10 to 300 keV with the resonance parameters of
ORNL and/or Geel. When this was not possible �α was
adjusted as a free parameter. In this way, the experimental data

FIG. 6. R-matrix analysis from 12.8 to 14.2 keV. The n_TOF data
(red points) are compared with the description of ORNL [5] (dashed

were consistently described for the resonant structure from
75 to 100 keV, which was needed to change the �n values,
as discussed later. In the following, the n_TOF analysis is
discussed and compared with Coddens et al. [5] (ORNL) and
Wagemans et al. [6] (Geel). It is split in four figures throughout
this section only for visualization purposes and justification of
the new parameters found for a few resonances.

Table III shows the resonance parameters and α strengths
obtained in the present work (n_TOF), in comparison with
ORNL and Geel. The α strength is defined as g�n�α/�, where
� = �n + �α + �γ is the total width; g = (2J + 1)/[(2I +
1)(2i + 1)] is the statistical factor and J , I , and i are the spins of
the resonance, the target ( 3

+
2

), and the projectile, respectively.
Because ORNL and Geel combined their data, many of the �α
values and strengths were identical. This was highlighted in
their tables by an empty space reserved for the parameter of the
corresponding resonance [5,6]. We follow their nomenclature
see Table III, in which an empty space means the same value
as Geel and “—” means that the resonance parameter is not
available because the resonance was not detected or because
the parameter could not be determined.

The study of the 13.45-keV resonance is an important goal
due to the discrepant descriptions obtained by ORNL and Geel,
specifically ORNL provided a value of �α twice the one of Geel
(see Table III). For this resonance a value of the integrated
area higher than Geel has been obtained, as mentioned in
Sec. IV, therefore, it is expected that the n_TOF data would
provide a higher value of the strength too. Figure 6 shows the
13.45-keV resonance in which the n_TOF data (red points) are
compared with the resonance parametrizations carried out by
ORNL (dashed green line), Geel (blue line), and the present
work (black line). An excellent description is obtained with
the �α value of n_TOF (see Table III). Nevertheless, n_TOF
data are fitted within statistical uncertainties with the �α value
of ORNL, which is not possible with the �α value of Geel.
This consolidates the n_TOF description of the resonance and
suggests that the Geel analysis underestimated its strength.

FIG. 7. R-matrix analysis from 50 to 100 keV. The n_TOF data
(red points) are compared with the description of ORNL [5] (dashed
green line), Geel [6] (blue line), and the present work (black line).
Geel and ORNL are coincident from 60 to 100 keV.

Figure 7 shows the energy range from 50 to 100 keV. As was
mentioned, the same value of the area of the resonance at 53.6
keV as Geel was obtained. However, the fit of the resonance
is not possible, neither with the �α value of Geel nor with the
ORNL value. For this reason, although the area is the same,
the n_TOF analysis provides a new value of �α (see Table III).
The resonance at 70.86 keV showed a higher area than Geel
and, indeed, the �α value of n_TOF is also higher. For both
resonances, the n_TOF strength is slightly higher than that of
ORNL and Geel.

The structure from 75 to 100 keV was described by ORNL
and Geel as three resonances at 81.36, 84.88, and 87.63 keV.
The parametrization of ORNL and Geel does not fit the
n_TOF data, providing an overestimation of the cross section
compared to our data. We tried to fit the n_TOF data leaving
free only �α but it was not possible. To fit this structure it was
needed to change the �n parameters provided by ORNL. In
fact, the key point was reducing the �n values of ORNL for the
84.88- and 87.63-keV resonances. This reduction is justified
because the �n values were obtained in the ORNL analysis
considering a full interference between both resonances but
a partial interference is also acceptable, which provides a
different value of �n, as discussed in Ref. [5]. In consequence,
we propose to describe the resonant structure from 75 to
100 keV as the three resonances proposed by ORNL and Geel
with the parameters of Table III. The strength of the resonances
at 84.88 and 87.63 keV obtained by n_TOF is significantly
lower than that of ORNL and Geel, while the resonance at
81.36 keV remains identical to the analysis of ORNL and Geel.

Figure 8 shows the energy range from 124 to 132 keV for
which a resonance with a larger area than Geel was found,
as mentioned in Sec. IV. The parametrization of ORNL is
close to the n_TOF data while the set of parameters of Geel
underestimated the resonance. Nevertheless, we provide a
better description of the 127.66-keV resonance (black line in
Fig. 8) by changing only �α . The obtained strength is much

higher than that of Geel and matches within uncertainties the
that of ORNL (see Table III).

Figure 9 shows the energy range from 200 to 240 keV. With
regards to the 221.38-keV resonance, the n_TOF parametriza-
tion provides a �α value higher than that of Geel but lower than
that of ORNL, consistent with the significant overestimation
of the resonance by ORNL (see the dashed green line).
Concerning the 228.6-keV resonance, our data are described
with the parameters of ORNL; nevertheless the �α value and
strength match the Geel values within uncertainties.

Finally, to complete the analysis up to 300 keV, a very small
structure at 296.2 keV was described as a resonance in the Geel
analysis. At this energy also a (n,γ ) resonance was resolved
by Auchampaugh et al. [9]. Due to the fact that the ORNL and
Geel analyses did not provide resonance parameters we have
described it with a tentative Jπ value and reasonable values of

VI. 33S (n,α) IN BNCT AND ASTROPHYSICS

One of the aims of this work was to measure and char-
acterize the 13.45-keV resonance because of its possible
contribution to the dose in neutron-capture therapy with ep-
ithermal neutron beams and tumors with uptake of 33S [1,3,4].
We have found that the integrated area from 12.5 to 14.5 keV
is a factor 1.5 times higher than the Geel value [6]. The value
of �α in our parametrization is in agreement with the ORNL
value, which was twice that of Geel. Accordingly, n_TOF
data will provide higher values of the delivered dose than
obtained in Refs. [1,3,4], which used the Geel data. This would
imply a higher destruction of the tumor for the same neutron
fluence and 33S uptake. However, to carry out more realistic
simulations of the dose in tissue, we need to measure the cross
section from thermal values to 10 keV. At thermal energy few
data exist and they disagree by more than 30%, whereas from
thermal values to 10 keV there are no data at all.

In addition, more factors have to be taken into account
in the determination of the dose, for instance, the biological
effect of the 33S(n,α) 30Si reaction could be higher than that of
the 10B(n,α) 7Li reaction due to the higher Q value. Also, the
biological effect depends on the carrier, which for 33S is under
investigation. All of these are matters of research at present
[28]. From the nuclear physics side, the present n_TOF data en-
courage the continuation of research on 33S as a target in BNCT.

Regarding astrophysics, the role of 33S for the origin of
36S in explosive scenarios was studied by Wagemans et al.
[6] and Auchampaugh et al. [9], showing an overproduction
in the solar system incompatible with the stellar models. The
Maxwellian-average cross section (MACS) at different kT
was calculated without experimental data from thermal values
to 10 keV. In addition, Wagemans et al. [6] and Auchampaugh
et al. [9] used thermal values that disagreed by more than
20%. As demonstrated by Druyts et al. [29], the thermal value
has a direct impact on the MACS values. Therefore, to obtain
more accurate MACS, experimental data from thermal values
to 10 keV are necessary for concluding on the role of 33S in
explosive scenarios.

VII. SUMMARY

The 33S(n,α) 30Si cross section has been measured at the
EAR1 of the n_TOF facility at CERN relative to the standard
10B(n,α) 7Li cross section covering the energy range from 10
to 300 keV. Both reactions were measured simultaneously with
the same setup. With the 185-m flight path and the experimental
setup based on MGAS detectors it has been possible to achieve
a high-resolution measurement in neutron energy and good
discrimination between α particles and background. Monte
Carlo simulations of the detector efficiency and accurate fits of
the amplitude histograms have been performed to correct for
α-particle losses. Eleven resonancelike structures have been
resolved. For three of them (13.45, 70.86, and 127.66 keV),
a value of the area higher than the unique available high-
resolution (n,α) measurement [6] was found.

J. PRAENA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 97, 064603 (2018)

A detailed resonance analysis in the Reich-Moore approx-
imation of the R-matrix theory has been performed using the
SAMMY code. New �α values and strengths have been provided
for some of the resonances after a detailed discussion. The
R-matrix analysis showed that the 11 resonant structures can be
associated with 14 individual resonances, the same as ORNL
and Geel. The cross section at 300 K has been provided by
means of its reconstruction from the resonance parameters
obtained in the present R-matrix analysis. Of special interest
is the most important resonance at 13.45 keV, which has been
consistently described with the ORNL transmission data [5],
but was found to disagree significantly from with the (n,α)
result obtained at Geel [6].

The present data could promote new evaluations of the cross
section in view of the important discrepancies between present
evaluated libraries’s evaluations and the available experimental
data.
