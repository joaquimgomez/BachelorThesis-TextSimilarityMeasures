We have measured the neutron-induced capture cross-section of the important s-process isotopes
of magnesium. The measurement has been performed at the neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF
at CERN. From a preliminary analysis of this new set of capture data we find that our results
seem to be significantly lower than previous data and evaluations. We have also investigated the
contribution of the direct capture component to the Maxwellian-averaged capture cross section.

Measurement of the 24,25,26Mg(n,γ) reaction cross-section at n_TOF C. Massimi

1. Introduction and physical motivations

The slow neutron-capture process (s-process) [1, 2] in stars is responsible for the origin of
about half of the elemental abundances beyond iron that we observe today. Most of the s-process
isotopes between iron and strontium (60 < A < 90) are produced in massive stars (M > 8Msun)
where the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction is the main neutron source.

Beyond strontium, the s-process abundances from Zr to Biare essentially produced in low mass
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in the mass range 1.2Msun < M < 3Msun, where most of
the neutrons are provided by the 13C(α,n)16O reaction and to minor part by the partial activation
of the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction.

While 56Fe represents the basic s-process seed for the production of the heavier isotopes, 25Mg
acts as an important neutron poison and affects, therefore, the neutron balance of the s process.
Accordingly, the 25Mg(n,γ)26Mg cross section is required with good accuracy for a quantitative
treatment of s-process nucleosynthesis.

1.1 Status of Mg data libraries

Existing evaluations of the Mg cross sections are presently based on the JENDL3.3 library
[3]. In this evaluation the resonance parameters in the resolved resonance region were adopted
from the compilation of Mughabghab [4], and negative resonances were added to reproduce the
recommended thermal cross sections in Ref. [4]. The recommended thermal values are close to
the experimental results of Walkiewicz et. al [5], but do not consider recent data of Koehler [6].
In this work previous measurements [8, 9] were reconsidered in a combined R-matrix analysis,
by which the spin of several levels could be determined. Moreover, it was shown in Ref. [6] that
complementary information from Ref. [10] is important for obtaining parity assignments of the
nuclear levels populated in neutron reactions on 25Mg+n.

Because the differences between JENDL3.3 and Ref. [6] cannot be explained by the differ-
ent spin assignments for the most relevant resonances alone, a new capture measurement was
performed in order to obtain improved information for an update of the (n,γ) cross sections of
24,25,26Mg.

2. The experiment at CERN n_TOF

The neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF at CERN provides a white, pulsed neutron spectrum.
The description given here refers to status during phase I of the facility (2001 - 2004) when the
present data were taken (for a discussion of recent improvements see Ref. [7]). Neutrons were
produced by spallation of protons with 20-GeV/c from the CERN proton synchrotron in a massive
(80×80×60 cm3) lead block surrounded by 5.8 cm of cooling water, which acted also as a neutron
moderator. The energy dependence of the neutron spectrum showed a 1/E isolethargic behavior
over the energy range of interest, i.e. between 1 eV and 1 MeV. The proton pulses are characterized
by a high intensity of 7×1012 protons per bunch and a short pulse width of 6 ns FWHM, resulting
in a high-resolution, high-intensity neutron beam.

The evacuated neutron flight path to the experimental area at about 185 m from the spallation
target is equipped with two collimators for reducing the beam from the initial diameter of 80 cm

to 1.8 cm at the sample position. The background in the experimental area is strongly reduced
by a sweeping magnet and massive Fe and concrete walls along the flight path (for details see
Refs. [11, 12]). The time between proton pulses is at least 2.4 s, long enough to prevent neutron
overlap between consecutive bunches.

An array of two C6D6 liquid scintillators has been used as in the capture experiment. The
detectors are placed perpendicular to the beam direction but shifted 9 cm upstream of the beam
for reducing the effect of in-beam γ rays. Because the capture cross sections of the Mg isotopes
are orders of magnitude smaller than the elastic scattering cross section, we preferred the total
energy detection method [13] in combination with the Pulse Height Weighting Technique (PHWT),
because of the small capture detector to be used (volume ≈ one liter). Background due to sample-
scattered neutrons in the detector was strongly reduced by means of in-house developed C6D6
detectors based on a low mass carbon fiber design [14].

The neutron flux at the sample position at 185 m, which is required for determining the capture
cross-section, has been measured with a well calibrated 235U loaded parallel plate ionization cham-
ber from Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt at Braunschweig [15]. During the actual runs, the
flux was measured and with a 6Li neutron monitor [16].

The characteristics of the samples, which were disks 22 mm in diameter, are listed in Table 1.
The enriched 25Mg and 26Mg samples consisted of magnesium-oxyde powder and were sealed in
a very thin aluminum canning with a total mass of only 350 mg. The specified impurities of the
enriched samples included traces of Be, Sb, Fe, Al, Sn, Mn, Cu, Ca, Mo, Ni, Ag, and Pb.

3. Data analysis

The light output of the C6D6 detectors is calibrated by means of mono-energetic γ-ray sources
(137Cs, 60C0, Pu/C). The dead time of the detector is determined from the time-difference distribu-
tion of consecutive signals in each detector. From this distribution a 20-ns dead time was obtained
for the actual capture setup. To avoid dead time fluctuations, a fixed value of 30 ns was considered
off-line for the digitized data. The corresponding dead time correction is lower than 1% up to 750
keV neutron energy.

The determination of the capture yield (that is the probability of a capture reaction) relies on
the PHWT. This technique requires a mathematical manipulation of the response function of the
detection system [13], the so-called weighting function (WF). The WF is calculated by means of
Monte Carlo simulations by considering the geometry and the particular design of the experimental

is obtained as a function of TOF from CW , the number
of weighted counts (counts multiplied by their weighting factors), corrected for the background B,
and the neutron fluence ϕ . The fact that the sample is smaller than the neutron beam is considered
by the normalization factor N. This normalization was determined with the saturated resonance
method using the 4.9-eV resonance in gold [17]. The capture yield of 25Mg, which represents the
main result of this experiment, is plotted in Fig. 1 together with the background contribution.

The calculated capture yield is related to the capture cross-section σγ by the expression Y =
(1−exp(−nσtot))×

, where n is the target thickness and σtot the total cross-section. The capture

yield was analyzed with the R-matrix code SAMMY [18] for determining the resonance parame-
ters. Experimental effects, that is multiple neutron scattering in the sample, neutron self-shielding,
and experimental resolution, are properly taken into account within the SAMMY code. Preliminary
resonance analyses have revealed discrepancies compared to previous evaluations. An example
obtained by the simultaneous analysis of capture data from the present measurement and of trans-
mission data from Ref. [9] is given in Fig. 2. Because the resonance shown in Fig. 2 contributes
about 30% to the MACS at 30 keV, the final MACS is expected to be smaller than reported so far
[6].

In addition to the resonant component, the contribution from the direct radiative capture (DRC)
mechanism has been calculated. For all three isotopes, the most important (electric dipole) tran-
sitions are due to incident p-wave neutrons captured into bound levels with strong single-particle
component in the sd shell. The resulting cross section for DRC is sensitive in this particular case
to the strength of the neutron-nucleus mean field (optical) potential. Using “standard” parameters,
a contribution to the MACS at kT=30 keV of less than 1 mb for each of the Mg isotope has been
found. However, the presence of the single-particle 2p state close to the neutron emission threshold
complicates the standard treatment of the DRC calculation in this case. Therefore, the issue still
needs to be investigated in order to conclude if the DRC mechanism has a significant impact on the
MACSs of the Mg isotopes.

4. Conclusions

With the present (n,γ) measurement the cross-section data on stable Mg isotopes can be im-

proved. From preliminary analyses we find that the MACS of 25Mg is lower than previously re-
ported. The expected changes of the stellar (n,γ) rates for the Mg isotopes will have a significant
impact on the neutron balance of the s−process.
