Resonance cross sections relevant for the termination of the s-process reaction path have been

determined for 204,206,207Pb and 209Bi at the CERN neutron time-of-flight spectrometer n_TOF.

The measurements were carried out in the neutron energy range from 1 eV up to 500 keV. By using

a system of C6D6-detectors with optimized neutron sensitivity, the main corrections of previous

measurements related to backgrounds from scattered neutrons could be practically eliminated.

Other corrections were thoroughly treated by control measurements with additional samples for

determination of the ambient background and of background from in-beam γ-rays as well as by
detailed analyses via Monte Carlo simulations. The Maxwellian averaged cross sections of the

four isotopes and their implications for the s-process abundance contributions in the Pb/Bi region

are discussed.

Neutron capture measurements on lead and bismuth César Domingo Pardo

1. Introduction

The isotopic abundances of the stable elements between iron and bismuth are essentially pro-
duced by the slow neutron capture process (s process) and the rapid neutron capture process (r
process). The s process, which has been found to operate in thermally pulsing low mass asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars is producing most of the Pb/Bi abundances in stars of low metallicity [1, 2].
Bismuth is the last isotope produced by the s process because further neutron capture on Bi leads
to the Po-isotopes, which are α-unstable. The abundance pattern in this termination region is com-
plex because of the branchings due to α-recycling at 210Po (t1/2=138 d) and at 210mBi (t1/2=3 My).
The final Pb/Bi abundance distribution is influenced by these branchings, which are sensitive to the
neutron exposure at the s-process site. Since 204Pb is shielded from the r-process by its mercury
isobar 204Hg, the observed 204Pb abundance is only produced by the s-process branching at 204Tl,
which is very sensitive to the stellar temperature. Hence, the 204Pb abundance is determined by the
strong temperature and neutron density variations characteristic of the thermal pulses in AGB stars.
In addition, a fraction of the 206,207,208Pb abundances is produced by the decay of the long-lived
uranium and thorium isotopes. By means of accurate neutron capture cross section measurements
and using an appropriate stellar model, the s-process abundances (Ns) of the Pb/Bi isotopes can
be more reliably determined. These Ns values contain information about the aspects mentioned
above, and allows one for a better decomposition of the respective r-process abundances and of the
radiogenic contributions due to the Th/U α decays as well. The latter information is important to
consolidate the reliability of the Th/U cosmochronometer.

2. Neutron capture measurements

Radiative neutron capture measurements on 204,206,207Pb and 209Bi were carried out at the
CERN n_TOF installation using small and highly isotopically enriched samples (see Table 1). The
small sample thicknesses led to correspondingly small corrections for neutron multiple scattering
in the sample, self-shielding and γ-ray absorption effects. Even though some tiny resonances could
not be observed due to the lower reaction rate of the thin samples, the main resonances which
completely dominate the cross section in the relevant energy range for stellar nucleosynthesis (5-
30 keV) could be measured in this way with improved systematic accuracy.

Isotope Enrichment (%) Thickness (atoms/barn)
204Pb 99.71 0.00376
206Pb 99.76 0.0073
207Pb 92.4 0.0074
209Bi 100 0.0173

Table 1: Enrichment and thickness of the samples measured at n_TOF.

The resolved resonance region is measured at n_TOF with excellent time of flight (TOF) res-
olution due to the 185 m flight path length and the short proton pulse width (6 ns rms) used in
the neutron spallation source. More details about the facility can be found in Ref. [3]. A further

advantage in this experiment is the broad neutron energy range covered, between 1 eV and 1 MeV.
It allowed us to measure resonances, which could not be observed in previous capture experiments
due to a lower neutron energy cutoff at 2.5 keV [4].

The samples were placed inside an evacuated sample changer made of carbon fibre. The
detection system consisted of two neutron sensitivity optimized C6D6 detectors [5] placed at ∼125

◦

with respect to the incident neutron beam direction in order to minimize the angular distribution
effects of the prompt γ-rays emitted after neutron capture. Details about the experimental setup at
n_TOF can be found in Ref. [6]. Due to the low neutron sensitivity of the detectors and the setup
in general, the TOF dependent background due to neutrons being scattered in the sample was only
noticeable for one of the measured resonances in the bismuth sample, and negligible for all the
rest. The correction needed in this exceptional case was also much smaller (3.5%) than previous
corrections in other experiments (∼50%) [7, 8].

The neutron fluence across the sample, Φn(En), was monitored by means of a thin 6Li foil and
four Si-detectors placed outside the neutron beam. The dependence of Φn on the neutron energy En
could be accurately determined by measuring the well known fission yields of 235U and 238U with
a fission chamber [9]. A thin gold sample was measured in regular intervals in order to perform an
absolute yield calibration by applying the so called saturated resonance technique [10].

The common dead-time due to the electronic processing of the signals from the detectors has
been avoided in the present measurement because all events are recorded with Flash Analog to
Digital Converters (Flash-ADC) [11]. The capture data was stored on tape and hard disk. The
relevant parameters for the capture data analysis were extracted off-line by applying a pulse shape
analysis routine.

3. Capture data analysis and results

The C6D6 detectors usually register, at most, one of the cascade γ-rays. Applying the pulse
height weighting technique (PHWT)[12], the capture yield can be written as,

Y (En) = f
sat
Au ×

Nwγ (En)

Ec ×Φn(En)
, (3.1)

where Nwγ is the weighted count rate for a certain TOF or neutron energy En. The weighting
factors (WF) were calculated by means of detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the experi-
mental setup following the procedure described in Refs. [6, 13, 14]. An uncertainty of less than
0.5% was estimated for the calculated WFs. Ec is the neutron capture energy, Sn +En×A/(A+1),
Sn being the neutron separation energy. The yield calibration factor f

sat
Au is determined from the

measurement of a gold reference sample (see previous section). Nevertheless, in order to achieve
an uncertainty in the yield determination of .3% one needs to take into account additional sys-
tematic effects, which are mainly related to i) the (digital or electronic) threshold in the signals of
the C6D6 detectors ( f

t ) [14] and to ii) the angular distribution effects in the case of p- and d-wave
resonances of low multiplicity ( f θ ) [15]. The corrected capture yield is then more accurately given
by,

Y ′(En) = f
θ
× f t ×Y (En). (3.2)

Neutron capture measurements on lead and bismuth César Domingo Pardo

For the Pb and Bi isotopes analyzed here, f t ranges between 1.031(3) and 1.070(3) depending
on the particular isotope, the threshold level used in the experiment, and the spin and parity (Jπ ) of
each resonance. Angular distribution effects were only relevant in the measurement of 206,207Pb,
where the capture state decays by emission of only one or two γ-rays. Even though the detectors
were placed at 125◦, the solid angle covered by both detectors led to yield correction factors ( f θ )
of up to 10% for some of the measured resonances. In most cases the factor f θ could be accurately
determined using previously measured decay patterns and angular distributions [16, 17, 18, 19].

Using the SAMMY code [20] an R-matrix analysis of the capture yield Y ′ was carried out.
The background in this analysis could be best determined from the (n, γ) measurement of a 99.86%
enriched 208Pb sample, which showed very few resonances in the entire neutron energy range. From
the latter it was concluded that neutron induced backgrounds were negligible, whereas the main
background contribution was due to in-beam γ-rays being scattered in the sample and registered in
the C6D6 scintillators. This γ-ray scattering effect is identical for all Pb samples and this holds in
very good approximation also for the bismuth measurement. The uncertainty in the cross section
of the resolved resonance region due to the background analysis was estimated to be 1.5% for very
broad resonances (Γ > 1 keV) but less than 0.5% in all other cases.

In the measurement of 204Pb the unresolved resonance region between En = 100 keV and
En = 400 keV was analyzed using the FITACS code implemented in SAMMY. The so deter-
mined average capture cross section is important for deriving the Maxwellian average cross section
(MACS) at thermal energies of kT = 20−30 keV.

The measured cross sections were convoluted with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in order
to obtain the relevant values for stellar nucleosynthesis calculations. These results are compared
in Fig. 1 with the cross sections reported in Ref. [21]. The first remarkable aspect of the present
measurements is the improvement in the uncertainty of the cross sections, usually more than a
factor of two. This improvement is also translated into a more precise determination of the stellar
s-process abundances (see later Sec. 4). The agreement with previous MACS [21] within the quoted
uncertainties shows that the latter have been realistically evaluated in the past, except in the case
of 204Pb where the MACS at kT = 5 keV is now 35% higher due to three previously unobserved
resonances [22]. In the case of 206Pb (dashed line in Fig. 1) our MACS is still preliminary mainly
because of some resonances that have not been corrected yet for angular distribution effects.

4. Implications in astrophysics

The Pb/Bi isotopes are essentially synthesized in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of low
mass and low metallicity where most of the neutron exposure is due to the 13C(α ,n)16O source,
which operates at temperatures of about 108 K (kT = 8 keV). During the He shell flashes the
22Ne(α ,n)25Mg reaction provides an additional neutron exposure at the higher thermal energy of
kT = 23 keV. Since the latter irradiation is rather weak, the abundances of isotopes with small
cross sections like 206,207Pb and mainly 209Bi (see Fig. 1) is dominated by what has been produced
during the interpulse phase at kT = 8 keV. Because of its much higher cross section, the situation
for 204Pb is the opposite (Fig. 1) and the MACS in the higher thermal energy region (kT ∼ 23 keV)
is more relevant in this case.

Figure 2: s-process solar abundances obtained
with the MACS measured at n_TOF (solid cir-
cles) and with the MACS from Ref. [21] (open
circles). Derived r-process residuals (solid
squares) are compared versus r-process calcula-
tions [23, 24] (open squares).

In order to evaluate the impact of the new MACS and of their smaller uncertainties, calcula-
tions with a stellar model [25] were carried out. For 204,207Pb a calculation was made using two
stellar masses, M = 1.5M⊙ and M = 3M⊙, and a combination of metallicities, [Fe/H] = -0.3 and
[Fe/H] = -1, which have been found to account for the main and strong components [1, 2], respec-
tively. Since 209Bi is mostly produced by the strong component, an AGB model with M = 3M⊙
and [Fe/H] = -1.3 was used in that case. Our MACS for 206Pb was still preliminary (see previous
section) and therefore no calculation with the new cross section has been made so far.

The impact of the more accurate MACS in the determination of the s-process abundances Ns is
best illustrated in Fig. 2. For 207Pb and 209Bi, the accuracy in the new s-process abundances (solid
circles) could be improved by a factor of two when compared to the same abundance calculations
based in previous cross sections from Ref. [21] (open circles). It can be concluded from the present
experiment, that uncertainties in the s-process abundances of 207Pb and 209Bi are now dominated
by the uncertainties in the observed solar abundances (7-8% for bismuth and 8-10% for lead [26,
27, 28] ) rather than by uncertainties in the nuclear data. In the case of the s-only isotope 204Pb, its
abundance uncertainty is still dominated by the uncertainties in the branching at 204Tl [29].

By subtracting the new s-process abundances from the solar system abundances [28], more
accurate r-process residuals could now be derived (solid squares in Fig. 2). These residuals can be
compared versus detailed r-process calculations [23, 24] (open squares in Fig. 2). In the latter figure
an uncertainty of 15% was considered for the r-process calculations [23]. Since 207Pb is mainly
produced by the s-process, N207s = 77(8)%, the uncertainty resulting in the r-process residual is still
considerably large N207r = N

207
⊙

−N207s = 23(8)%. This result is in fair agreement with r-process
abundance calculations, which yield values between 15%[24] and 18%[23] . The opposite situation
occurs for bismuth, where the s-process abundance is smaller, leading to an accurately constrained

r-process abundance N209r = 81(3)%. This result lies well within the 71-90% abundance range
predicted by r-process abundance calculations (see Fig. 2).

5. Conclusions

With the present measurements the neutron capture cross sections of the Pb/Bi isotopes have
been determined with improved accuracy. The respective improvements in the solar s-process
abundances were determined with a set of stellar model calculations. With the new cross sections,
the main uncertainty in the s-process abundances of 207Pb and 209Bi is now due to the uncertainty of
the solar abundances of lead and bismuth. On the other hand, the uncertainties of the branching at
204Tl dominate the s-process abundance of 204Pb. The r-process residuals derived from our results
are in good agreement with r-process calculations.
