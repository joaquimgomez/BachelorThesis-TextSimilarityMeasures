Abstract

At the neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF at CERN a new vertical beam line was constructed in 2014, in order to extend the ex-
perimental possibilities at this facility to an even wider range of challenging cross-section measurements of interest in astrophysics,
nuclear technology and medical physics. The design of the beam line and the experimental hall were based on FLUKA Monte
Carlo simulations, aiming at maximizing the neutron flux, reducing the beam halo and minimizing the background from neutrons
interacting with the collimator or back-scattered in the beam dump.
The present paper gives an overview on the design of the beam line and the relevant elements and provides an outlook on the
expected performance regarding the neutron beam intensity, shape and energy resolution, as well as the neutron and photon back-
grounds.

Keywords: n TOF facility, Neutron time-of-flight, FLUKA, neutron cross-section measurement

1. Introduction

The neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF at CERN [1, 2] is
a pulsed white neutron source for high-accuracy neutron cross-
section measurements over a wide neutron energy range. The
neutrons are produced in a monolithic Pb-spallation target, where
a pulsed 20 GeV/c proton beam provided by the CERN Proton
Synchrotron (PS) [3] impinges with a maximum repetition rate
of 0.8 Hz. The primary proton beam has a width of rms = 7 ns.
The Pb-target is surrounded by an additional moderator layer, to
generate a neutron beam with energies ranging from thermal up
to several GeV. At the facility in operation since 2000 the mea-
surements take place in an experimental area placed at the end
of a horizontal beam line, 200 m in length. The experimental
conditions and neutron beam characteristics at this horizontal
flight path are presented in full detail in reference [4].
The horizontal 200 m flight path, with its record instantaneous
neutron beam intensity, has allowed very important cross-sections
to be measured, getting unprecedented energy resolution in both
neutron capture [5, 6] and fission [7] as well as extending the
measurement range to previously unreachable neutron energies
[8]. However, there are more challenging experiments that re-
quire an even more intense neutron beam.
In order to extend the experimental possibilities at the n TOF
facility for cross-section measurements of very low mass sam-
ples (< 1 mg), reactions with small cross-sections or highly ra-
dioactive samples [9], an additional vertical flight path of 20 m
with a significantly higher neutron flux was designed and con-
structed in 2014. The design and implementation of this new
beam line, with an outlook on the expected performance are the
subject of this paper. In Section 2 the final beam line config-
uration, as in operation at CERN since July 2014, is presented
with a description of the different elements. The expected char-
acteristics of the neutron beam and the background conditions,
determined by means of FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations, are
discussed in Section 3.

2. General Layout and technical Description

Figure 1: General layout of the vertical flight path, from the spallation target
to the beam dump. The different beam line elements with the position of their
entrance are indicated on the left.

The n TOF spallation target is installed in the TT2A tun-
nel at CERN. The spallation target was lowered to its current
position through an existing vertical shaft via a service gallery.
This shaft was now used to install the bottom part of the ver-
tical beam line which is presented here. From the roof of the
service gallery, at 12.6 m from the target center, to the ground, a
new concrete shaft with an inner diameter of 800 mm was built
during 2013. At ground level, 18.16 m above the spallation tar-
get, a new building was constructed, hosting the bunker with
the experimental area, an electronics room and two preparatory
rooms. The beam dump for this new vertical flight path is in-
stalled on the roof of the bunker. The existing service gallery is
used to house the magnet and the filter box of the beam line, as

well as to allow the access to the 1st collimator.
The general layout with the different beam line elements is
shown in Figure 1. The distance to the spallation target cen-
ter for the different beam line elements, which are described in
further detail below, are listed in Table 1.

Table 1: Beam line elements and their position with respect to the center of the
n TOF spallation target.

2.1. The Beam Line at the Level of the Spallation Target

The n TOF spallation target consists of a Pb cylinder 400 mm
in length and 600 mm in diameter, surrounded by a layer of
demineralized water acting as coolant and, only in the forward
direction, an additional moderator layer, usually filled with bo-
rated water in saturation. The target is surrounded by an Al
container and supported by an Al alloy structure. The support
structure has a polygonal opening on the top, to allow the low-
ering of a vacuum chamber for the vertical beam line down to
the level of the target.
The vacuum line of the vertical beam line has therefore a polyg-
onal section for the first 0.9 m, after which it opens to a circular
beam pipe with 317 mm inner diameter. The neutron window
at the bottom of the polygonal section is concave, to match the
shape of the spallation target. The neutron window at this level
is 1.5 mm in thickness and made of Al, leaving a gap of 10 mm
air between the window and the Al-housing of the target. Due
to technical constraints, the window is installed off-center with
respect to the center of the spallation target, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. The reference point, marking the center of the circular
beam pipe above, is 49 mm downstream and 100 mm to the
right with respect to the target center and the direction of the
impinging proton beam.

2.2. Collimation System

The neutron beam is shaped by two collimators:

• The 1st collimator is installed at 7.4 m above the target
inside the first vacuum pipe of the beam line. It consists
of a 1 m long Fe cylinder with 200 mm inner diameter. It
is suspended from the service gallery on 1.1 m long rods,
attached to a ring at the top of the corresponding vacuum
chamber.

• The 2nd collimator is installed at 15.04 m above the tar-
get, inside a large vacuum vessel with 680 mm outer
diameter. The vacuum vessel is suspended just below

Figure 2: Model of the n TOF spallation target seen from the top. The proton
beam is impinging from the lower edge on the picture. The neutron beam to-
wards the horizontal beam line leaves the target in the forwards direction. The
neutron window and the polygonal section of the vertical beam line are indi-
cated on the right. The reference point in red (cross) marks the center of the
vertical beam line.

the floor of the experimental hall. The different sections
of the collimator are resting on 4 steps inside this vac-
uum vessel. These steps serve as chicanes, avoiding the
streaming of neutrons to the experimental hall outside the
beam.
The collimator consists of 2 m Fe and 1 m borated polyethy-
lene (B-PE), where the last 0.4 m have a core of boron-
carbide (B4C) cylinders. The inner dimensions of the
collimator follow a step geometry, to approximate a con-
ical design. The inner diameters of the different steps are
listed in Table 2. The last section of this collimator is
shown in Figure 3, where the inner and outer step design
are noticeable.

Figure 3: Last meter of the second collimator installed inside the big vacuum
vessel which is supported 120 mm below the EAR2 floor. The B-PE part is
shown in green with the B4C core in the last 400 mm in light blue. The stainless
steel spheres, installed around the vacuum vessel for shielding purposes, are
indicated in light red. The first two steps inside the vacuum vessel, on which
the collimator rests, are visible at the sides of the collimator.

The exit of the second collimator is situated 120 mm below
the floor of the experimental area. Due to the geometry of the
collimation system and the close distance to the target, the neu-

tron beam halo is diverging by 1 mm over 100 mm distance to
the 2nd collimator exit, inside the experimental area. The focal
point, which is theoretically the position of the narrowest spa-
tial beam profile, is positioned at 1.08 m from the floor of the
experimental area (EAR2).

2.3. Shielding

Various shielding elements are installed along the beam line.
In their design, special care was taken to allow the dismantling
of the beam line, in order to leave the spallation target accessi-
ble for future upgrades and consolidation activities. The gaps
between the vacuum pipes and the shielding elements are min-
imized as much as mechanically possible.
The beam line shielding up to the experimental area consists of
the following elements:

• Shielding around the bottom part of the beam line: From
0.9 m above the spallation target, up to the floor of the
service gallery at 9.8 m, concrete shielding elements are
placed. Up to 7 m above the target the ducts for the
cooling system of the spallation target are installed in the
same shaft as the beam line. The concrete shielding ele-
ments at this level have recesses to let these ducts pass.
Above the position of the first collimator, at about 9 m
from the target, an additional Fe collar was installed around
the beam pipe in addition to the concrete shielding, to en-
hance the shielding at this level and reduce the radiation
level on the permanent magnet, which is installed just
above in the service gallery.

• Shielding around the middle part of the beam line: From
the roof of the service gallery at 12.6 m to the exit of

Figure 4: Pb shielding after the second collimator as installed by default inside
the first vacuum chambers in the experimental area. The section which contains
the vacuum valve is left without additional shielding.

the second collimator at 18.4 m, the beam line shielding
mainly consist of 4 tons of stainless steel spheres, 4.8 mm
in diameter, filling the volume between the vacuum ves-
sel containing the second collimator and the shaft walls.
The spheres can be removed by a special retaining sys-
tem at the roof of the service gallery.
An additional concrete ring 1.5 m in length and with an
inner diameter of 480 mm is installed in the shaft below
the big vacuum vessel.

• At the floor of the experimental area, 0.1 m thick plates
of Lithium-Polyethylene (Li-PE) are installed around the
beam pipe, covering the area of the shaft below, to absorb
thermalized neutrons.

In addition to the beam line shielding, additional elements are
installed inside the experimental area to reduce the background
contributions to the measurements.

• Right after the exit of the second collimator, Pb disks
are installed inside the vacuum chambers to reduce γ-
background coming from the last section of the collima-
tor. The inner diameters of the Pb disks are matched to
the diverging beam and can hence be understood as an
extension of the collimation system. The length of this
Pb-shielding can be adjusted to the needs. In Figure 4 the
default configuration of this shielding 0.57 m in effective
height are indicated.

• In the last vacuum pipe of the beam line, which is fixed
to the roof of the bunker just before the beam dump, a re-
movable shielding of 1 m length is installed, indicated in
Figure 5 in green. These shielding elements are designed
to reduce photons and neutrons streaming back from the
beam dump to the experimental setup. Their dimensions
match the beam optics at the entrance of the beam dump,
within 5 mm.

4



Figure 5: Beam dump and last part of the EAR2 beam line. The last vac-
uum chamber contains additional shielding material (green) to reduce the back-
ground to the experiment from backscattered neutrons and photons. This cham-
ber is installed in the roof of the building and penetrates the core of the beam
dump. The beam dump, which is installed on the roof of the building contains
three layers, as explained in the text.

– A 50 mm Pb disk is positioned just below the last
window before the beam dump.

– B-PE cylinders with an inner diameter of 200 mm
are inserted in the vacuum chamber below the Pb
disk, over a length of 0.95 m.

– B4C cylinders with an inner diameter of 150 mm
are inserted additionally into the B-PE cylinders.

2.4. Beam Dump

The beam dump is installed on the roof of the building. It
consists of three layers to fully absorb the neutron beam and
to respect the dose rate for low-occupancy areas, 2.5 µSv/h,
outside the building. The beam dump was designed to respect
these limits for radiation protection even for a large diameter
beam produced with a 2nd collimator having an exit diameter of
200 mm instead of the current 21.8 mm.

• The core of the beam dump consists of a block of B-PE
to slow down and to capture neutrons, both from the pri-
mary impinging beam and neutrons which are backscat-
tered from the consecutive beam dump layers. The outer
dimensions of the core are 400 x 400 x 400 mm3. The B-
PE block has a cylindrical hole at the entrance, 250 mm
in height and 340 mm in diameter, where the last vacuum
chamber of the beam line is inserted.

• The B-PE core is surrounded by Fe blocks to absorb the
fast neutrons and photons of the beam. The outer dimen-
sions of the Fe part is 1600 x 1600 x 1600 mm3.

• The beam dump is finally shielded by concrete with outer
dimensions of 3200 x 3200 x 2400 mm3.

Figure 5 shows a cut through the 3D model of the last part of the
EAR2 beam line. The removable shielding elements inserted in
the last vacuum pipe, which extends inside the first part of the
beam dump, are indicated in green.

2.5. Permanent Magnet

To deflect all charged particles which originate from the
spallation process in the Pb-target before the experimental hall,
a permanent dipole magnet is installed 10.4 m above the spal-
lation target [10]. The magnet poles consist of an assembly
of 168 Sm2Co17 radiation resistant permanent magnet blocks,
with additional iron poles to smooth possible deviations of the
magnetization direction of the permanent magnet blocks. The
installation of additional Sm2Co17 blocks on each side of the
gap compensates radial stray field losses and improves the in-
tegrated field homogeneity. The assembly is installed inside a
steel return yoke.
The dipole magnet has an inner gap of 340 mm, where the vac-
uum pipe of the beam line is installed. The magnetic field in the
center of the magnet is 0.253(4) T, over the total dipole length
of 1.134 m. The integrated field of the magnet is 0.287 Tm.
The design constraints for the dipole magnet were based on
the expected charged particle spectra from FLUKA simulations
in the experimental hall. The results of these simulations are
shown in Figure 6. To deflect all charged particles from the
beam, a minimum integrated field of 0.2 Tm was calculated for
the nominal magnet position, given the maximum momentum
of 1.205 GeV/c for protons.

per pulse (7e12 ppp). The maximum momentum for protons is 1.205 GeV/c.

2.6. Neutron Filters

A neutron filter station is installed 11.4 m above the spal-
lation target. It contains 8 filters which can be individually in-
serted into the neutron beam to blank out different neutron ener-
gies from the beam or attenuate the in-beam photons. The filter
station is remotely controlled from the n TOF control room.

ing black resonances are listed in Table 3.

2.7. Experimental Area (EAR2)

The bunker housing the experimental area, where the mea-
surements take place, has the floor located at a distance of 18.16 m
with respect to the center of the target, while the ceiling is at
23.66 m. The beam line elements from 0.2 - 3 m above the
floor of the area are easily exchangeable to meet the require-
ments of the different experiments. By default, the first me-
ter is reserved for the Pb shielding and a neutron flux monitor,
which are installed inside the vacuum pipes in the lowest sec-
tion of the experimental station. Removable vacuum pipes can
be mounted along the beam line, with sizes matching the di-
mension of the beam in order to allow a close geometry during
capture measurements, as illustrated in Figure 7 where the ex-
perimental setup during background measurements is shown.

A set of versatile support structures is available for the dif-
ferent detection systems in use, which are mounted on a pillar
system in the area. For capture measurements a remotely con-
trolled sample changer is mounted, to allow the change of the
samples during beam time.
The bunker is equipped with all necessary systems to be oper-
ated as Class A laboratory [11]. A dedicated ventilation system
keeps an under-pressure of −150 Pa with respect to atmospheric
pressure inside the experimental area, whereas the changing
room and the electronics room are held at -50 Pa and -100 Pa
respectively, ensuring an appropriate dynamic confinement.

3. Simulations and Expected Performance

The beam line design of the vertical flight path was based on
extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies [12, 13], which were
performed with the FLUKA code [14, 15], using the graphical
interface FLAIR [16]. The simulations focused especially on:

1. Studying the beam characteristics inside the experimental
area for different collimation systems.

Figure 7: The experimental station during background measurements with scin-
tillators.

2. Investigating experimental conditions for cross-section mea-
surements with various shielding compositions, in par-
ticular background simulations for capture experiments
with scintillators.

3. Evaluating radiation levels in areas neighboring the beam
line and the bunker, which have to comply with the offi-
cial CERN dose rate limits [17] for accessible zones.

In order to reduce the computing time for the various different
configurations, a two step approach was adopted in the simula-
tions. The spallation target with the impinging proton beam was
simulated in a first step to retrieve the information about parti-
cles exiting the target in the vertical direction. These particles
were used as source in the following simulations of different
beam line configurations.
The expected beam characteristics and experimental conditions
with the above presented beam line are discussed in the follow-
ing.

3.1. Neutron Flux Spectrum

The neutron flux spectrum, which represents the number of
neutrons per impinging proton pulse on the spallation target as
a function of neutron energy En, was simulated in the nomi-
nal sample position 1.6 m from the floor of the experimental
area. As discussed in the next section, at this position the neu-
tron beam profile has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
21 mm. In order to cover the full spatial beam profile, the sim-
ulated neutron flux was integrated over a surface 100 mm in di-
ameter to obtain the total number of neutrons. The results were
normalized to the nominal proton beam intensity of 7x1012 pro-
tons per pulse (ppp) at n TOF.

Figure 8: Simulated neutron flux at a nominal sample position in the experi-
mental area. The dips in the spectrum are due to a significant amount of Al
with traces of Mn at the spallation target. The spectrum is normalized to the
nominal proton beam intensity at n TOF, 7x1012 protons per pulse.

The total flux energy distribution is illustrated in Figure 8. The
neutron evaporation peak is visible in the spectrum around En = 1 MeV.
The strong dips in the spectrum in the region 20 keV < En <
200 keV are due to the significant amount of Al at the target
level in the upwards direction. Additional dips are observed at
300 eV and 2 keV due to Mn traces in the aluminum-alloy used
for the structural elements at the target. The peak at low neu-
tron energies results from the thermalization of the neutrons in
the water surrounding the spallation target.
The integrated flux for different neutron energy decades is listed
in Table 4. The total number of neutrons per proton pulse
is 1.1x107 neutrons per 7x1012 protons impinging on target.

erator, is listed as well in Table 4. The highest neutron gain
at the vertical flight path is a factor 26 in the energy interval
1 < En < 10 keV.
In Figure 9 the neutron flux is shown as a function of time-
of-flight (TOF), together with the in-beam photon background.
The corresponding En are indicated with arrows for some TOF
values. The in-beam photon spectrum is discussed in further
detail in Section 3.3, together with the photon energy spectra
for the prompt and delayed photons.

3.2. Neutron Beam Profile

The neutron beam profile is dictated by the geometry and
distance of the 1st and 2nd collimator in the beam line. The fo-
cussing lines define the focal point, which is 1.08 m above the
floor of the experimental area. The defocussing lines of the ge-
ometry define the size of the beam halo along the height of the
experimental area. For the presented configuration, the halo is
diverging by 1 mm over 0.1 m increasing distance to the target.
The nominal sample position for capture measurements is lo-
cated at 1.6 m from the floor of the bunker, as the best com-
promise between beam profile and background conditions was

Table 4: Integrated neutron flux for different neutron energy decades, normal-
ized to 7x1012 protons per pulse, for both experimental areas at n TOF. The
evaluated neutron fluence at the horizontal flight path (EAR1) corresponds to
the capture measurement setup with pure water as moderator from reference
[4]. For neutron energies in the keV range the expected neutron flux is up to a
factor 26 higher at the vertical flight path.

found for this height. At this position the neutron beam width is
21 mm FWHM. In Figure 10 the projected neutron beam profile
for thermal neutron energies at different heights in the experi-
mental room is shown, with the profile at the nominal sample
position drawn in ochre. The profile of the neutron beam at
6.6 m from the floor of the experimental area corresponds to
the beam profile at the entrance to the beam dump.

The neutron beam profile for different TOF decades is illus-
trated in Figure 11, for the nominal sample position. The beam
halo at this position is 50 mm in diameter, which is slightly less
than the 55 mm expected from the optical considerations. The
neutron background outside the beam is 4 − 5 orders of magni-
tude lower than at the peak of the beam profile.

Due to the small opening of the 2nd collimator, exact simu-
lations of the beam profile are difficult to retrieve from Monte
Carlo simulations for this geometry. Additional simulations of
a large 2nd collimator, having a diameter of 50 mm at the exit,
have shown that the neutron beam for En > 1 MeV is asym-
metric. A mirrored projection of the polygonal window above
the neutron target can be observed in the beam profile at these
high neutron energies. This is expected to be visible as well
with the currently presented collimator geometry.

3.3. Background Conditions

To estimate the background conditions, the in-beam photon
background was studied as well as the contributions coming
from different beam line elements and the bunker.

3.3.1. In-beam Photon Background
The in-beam photon background, i.e. the gamma-rays trav-

eling with the neutron beam can be divided in two parts:

Figure 9: Neutron and photon fluence as function of TOF at the nominal sam-
ple position in the experimental area. The corresponding En is indicated for
different energies with arrows. The in-beam photon spectrum can be divided in
prompt and delayed γ.

• Prompt γ, originating from the spallation process in the
target, arrive at the experimental area in the first 200 ns,
as indicated in Figure 9. These photons are the main con-
tributors to the so-called ’γ-flash’, the first signal detected
by most of the detectors in the experimental area. As
shown in Figure 12, the photon energies Eγ are ranging
up to a few hundred MeV, where the dominant part is be-
low 10 MeV.

• Delayed γ, originating from the moderation process at
the target, are arriving at the experimental station up to
5 ms after the γ-flash. The dominant Eγ is 2.2 MeV, from
photons generated by neutron capture reactions on the 1H
isotopes present in the cooling water of the target. Addi-
tional peaks are observed in the Eγ-spectrum at 511 keV,
from e−+e+ annihilation, and in the range of 7 - 7.5 MeV,
from capture reactions in the target and surrounding ma-
terials (Pb, Fe and Al).

The detailed Eγ spectra of the in-beam photon background are
displayed in Figure 12.

3.3.2. Background Contribution from Beam Line Elements
Extensive studies have been performed to estimate the dif-

ferent background contributions coming from the beam line el-
ements and the experimental hall. A volume containing C6D6
liquid, a standard detector type for capture measurements at
n TOF, was included in the FLUKA geometry around the beam
pipe at 1.5 m above the floor of the experimental area, corre-
sponding to the nominal position of the detectors, which are
usually placed upstream of the capture sample. The energy de-
position by different particles in this volume was studied with
various shielding configurations to estimate the expected back-
ground conditions. A detailed discussion on the simulation re-
sults is published in Reference [18]. These background simu-
lations have led to the design of the various shielding elements

and the choice for the materials in use in the 2nd collimator.
The results show that, in absence of shielding elements along
the beam line in the bunker, about 30% of the background orig-
inates from backscattered particles from the beam dump. The
remaining part of the background is caused by particle inter-
actions at the exit of the collimator. 35% of the background
is caused directly from particles streaming to the detector from
the exit of the collimator and the remaining 35% are contributed
indirectly from backscattered radiation from the walls of the
bunker. The shielding elements discussed in Section 2.3 were
introduced in order to reduce the background originating from
the beam dump and directly from the 2nd collimator.
The influence of mylar windows and air around the sample po-
sition on the energy deposition in the C6D6 detectors was stud-
ied as well and it was confirmed that the air gap contributes
more with increasing distance between the mylar windows at
the vacuum-air interface.
The energy deposition in the C6D6 volume in the final beam
line configuration and with a realistic experimental setup, in-
cluding two Mylar windows and an air gap of 50 mm at the
sample position, for 10 µs < TOF < 100 µs, is expected to be
Edep = 53.9 keV/cm3 ± 5% in total, where 22.5 keV/cm3 is due
to the neutron background.

3.4. Neutron Energy Resolution

At a neutron time-of-flight facility the kinetic energy of the
neutron is determined by measuring the time from the primary
beam impinging on the target to the detection of the signals
coming from neutron-induced reactions at the measuring sta-
tion and converting the resulting TOF to En. Because of the
neutron creation and moderation processes at the target and the
width of the impinging primary proton beam on the target, the
relation between TOF and En is represented by distributions of
a particular shape, rather than constant values.

Figure 12: Photon energy spectra of the in-beam γ in the experimental area.
The spectrum for prompt γ corresponds to photons arriving in the first 200 ns at
the experimental station, the main contribution to the so-called ’γ-flash’ in the
detectors.

This relation of TOF and En for the vertical direction at the
n TOF spallation target is illustrated in Figure 13, where the
influence of the proton beam time spread (7 ns rms) is not in-
cluded. Neutrons of a given energy En arrive at the measure-
ment position with a specific time distribution, with the shape
of the distribution changing with En. These distributions repre-
sent the resolution function of the facility. The resolution func-
tion has to be well known for the high accuracy determination
of cross-sections. It can only be determined by extensive Monte
Carlo simulations, which are consecutively validated via exper-
iments.
The time distributions can equivalently be expressed in length,
where the effective flight path of the neutron is the sum of the
geometrical flight path L and an equivalent moderation length
λ [19]. The distributions of λ for three different En decades
is illustrated in Figure 14. It is apparent that the distributions

En = 1 − 10 eV, a shoulder is appreciable on the distribution,
which is still observable for the range En = 0.1−1 keV. This is
caused by moderation processes in the different material layers
at the target (Al, H2O, Air).

where ∆λ is defined as the FWHM of the distributions in the dif-
ferent neutron energy ranges. ∆T represents the time spread of
the impinging primary proton beam, which dominates the neu-
tron energy resolution for En > 10 MeV. The currently available

simulation results are still too limited in statistics and hence
only allow to give a first estimation of the neutron energy reso-
lution at the experimental area of the vertical flight path. If the
influence of the proton beam width is disregarded the neutron
energy resolution is expected to be

• ∆En/En ≈ 4x10−3 at En = 1 eV.

• ∆En/En ≈ 4x10−2 at En = 1 MeV.

The corresponding values for the neutron energy resolution at
the horizontal flight path are 3.2x10−4 and 5.3x10−3 for 1 eV
and 1 MeV respectively [4]. The difference in neutron energy
resolution of about one order of magnitude between the two
flight paths is coherent with the difference in flight path length
between the two areas, 20 m versus 200 m.

4. Summary and Conclusions

The new vertical flight path at the n TOF facility at CERN
was constructed in order to extend the experimental capabilities
at this facility to very challenging cross-section measurements,
i.e. for small mass or for high-activity radioactive samples. It is
in operation and under commissioning since summer 2014. In
this paper the technical design of the beam line and the expected
performance in the new experimental station were presented.
The experimental area at this new vertical beam line is located
18 m above the Pb-spallation target. The neutron beam is shaped
by two collimators in the beam line, where the exit diameter of
the 2nd collimator is 21.8 mm. Charged particles coming from
spallation processes in the target, are deflected from the beam
by a permanent dipole magnet with 0.287 Tm, located 10 m
above the spallation target. A neutron filter station is as well
available in this beam line to blank out certain neutron ener-
gies from the neutron spectrum. To achieve optimal background
conditions, a sophisticated shielding system was implemented
around the beam line and inside the experimental room.
The beam line design was based on extensive FLUKA Monte
Carlo simulations. The new flight path offers a neutron spec-
trum from thermal neutron energies up to hundreds of MeV
with a very high instantaneous flux. The integrated neutron
flux is 1.1x107 neutrons per 7x1012 protons impinging on tar-
get. The neutron flux at the vertical flight path is significantly
higher than the available flux at the horizontal flight path at
n TOF for a comparable beam size, where the maximum neu-
tron gain, with a factor 26, is available for 1 < En < 10 keV.
The neutron beam profile changes strongly as a function of dis-
tance from the floor of the experimental room. At the nominal
sample position 1.6 m above the floor, the projected beam pro-
file has FWHM = 21 mm for thermal neutron energies. With
all shielding elements installed in the beam line, the neutron
background outside the beam halo is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude
smaller than the neutron flux at the peak of the beam profile.
The expected background conditions for cross-section measure-
ments from in-beam γ and the contributions of the different
beam line elements have been estimated by means of FLUKA
simulations. The in-beam photon energy spectra is dominated
by the Eγ = 2.2 MeV energy in the delayed γ-spectrum.

The expected neutron energy resolution is ∆En/En ≈ 4x10−3

at En = 1 eV. Consistent with the difference in flight path
length, the neutron energy resolution is approximately one or-
der of magnitude better in the horizontal flight path of 200 m at
n TOF.
