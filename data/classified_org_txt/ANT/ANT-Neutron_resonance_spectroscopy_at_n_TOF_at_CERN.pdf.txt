Abstract. Neutron resonance spectroscopy plays an important role in the investigation of neutron induced reaction
cross sections and nuclear structure in the MeV excitation range. Neutron time-of-flight facilities are the most
used installations to explore neutron resonances. In this paper we describe the basic features of neutron resonance
spectroscopy together with recent results from the time-of-flight facility n TOF at CERN.

1 Introduction

The study of neutron-induced reactions is of large importance
in a wide variety of research fields, ranging from stellar nu-
cleosynthesis [1,2], symmetry breaking effects in compound
nuclei [3,4], and the investigation of nuclear level densities
[5–7], to applications of nuclear technology [8–11], including
the transmutation of nuclear waste, accelerator driven systems
and nuclear fuel cycle investigations.

The cross sections of neutron-induced reactions can show
variations of several orders of magnitude on an energy scale of
only a few eV. The origin of these resonances is related to the
excitation of nuclear states in the compound nuclear system
formed by the neutron and the target nucleus, at excitation
energies lying above the neutron binding energy of typically
several MeV. The typical time scale τ = 10−16 s of these
compound reactions is much slower than in direct reactions
as the opposite reaction mechanism.

At these high excitation energies for nuclei of medium and
heavy mass the nuclear system is extremely complex and no
nuclear model is capable of predicting the position and other

properties of these excited states. Cross sections can therefore
only be accessed by measurements.

Due to extreme configuration mixing, the nucleus in this
regime above the neutron threshold has a statistical behaviour.
This is expressed by the assumption that the matrix elements
relating nuclear states have a random character, governed
by a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. This statistical
model of the compound nucleus is referred to as the Gaussian
Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) [12–15].

The statistical model has direct consequences on the ob-
servables of the reaction cross sections. The channel widths
are proportional to the square of the matrix elements and
have therefore a chi-squared distribution with one degree of
freedom, also called the Porter-Thomas distribution. Indeed it
has been shown that the distribution of reduced neutron widths
follow such a distribution for many nuclei. The observed
gamma width of a resonance is in reality the sum of many, for
medium and heavy nuclei several tens of thousand, individual
gamma widths and tends therefore to follow more a Gaussian
distribution. Observed fission widths correspond to a relatively
small number of fission channels, at maximum three or four.
The resulting distribution can be approximated by an effective
chi-squared distribution with a small, fractional number of
degrees of freedom.

Today’s commonly used formalism which links the physi-
cal properties of the nuclear levels to resonance reaction cross
sections is the R-matrix formalism [16–19], most often in
one of its approximations suited for neutron induced cross
sections, like the Reich-Moore approximation.

The resonance region, which is the energy region where
individual states are excited, can be conveniently divided in a
resolved resonance region (RRR) and an unresolved resonance
region (URR), where the thermal region around 25 meV is part
of the RRR. The boundary between resolved and unresolved
resonances is rather fuzzy. One could define this point as
the energy where the width of the resonances starts to be
larger than the level spacing, but in practice, resonances are
unresolved at a much lower energy because of broadening
effects, principally Doppler broadening and experimental res-
olution broadening. The R-matrix description can be extended
to the unresolved resonance region, where average resonance
parameters can be adjusted to describe the cross sections. A
different approach in this energy region and at higher energies
is the use of optical model calculations.

As an example we show in figure 1 the total neutron-
induced reaction cross section for several nuclei of increasing
mass. Since the level density increases with mass, resonances
are more closely spaced for heavier nuclei and the URR starts
at lower energies. But near a closed shell nucleus like 208Pb,
the level density is much lower, and we observe the first
resonance at a much higher energy.

Indeed resonance data are an important calibration point
for all level density models. The extraction of the level
density just above the neutron binding energy requires a
careful interpretation of the resonance data, including spin and
parity assignments and missing level corrections [20,21]. A
compilation of experimentally observed resonance data can be
found in refs. [22,23] for example.

In evaluated nuclear data libraries, such as BROND,
CENDL, ENDF, JEFF, JENDL, and others [24], RRR data

Fig. 1. Several examples of the resonance structure in the total
neutron-induced reaction cross section. The general trend of increas-
ing level density with increasing excitation energy can be observed

the lower level density is clearly visible.

are stored as a set of physical properties for each nuclear
level excited by the incident neutron, which are energy, spin,
parity and partial widths. These data allow the reconstruction
of the resonance cross sections, capture, scattering, total and if
applicable fission, at any given target temperature. The URR
data are stored as point-wise cross sections for all possible
reactions in the form of interpolation tables.

Considerable efforts have been made to produce coherent
and consistent evaluated nuclear data files of high quality,
reflecting as much as possible the inherent physical properties
in order to be truly multi-purpose. Improved nuclear model
calculations as well as new experimental data from existing
and new experimental facilities have contributed largely to
this result. The improvement of the quality of these neutron
cross section libraries rely among others on the availability
of accurate measurements obtainable at advanced neutron
sources.

In the next section we will give an overview of the
experimental activities at the neutron time-of-flight facility
n TOF at CERN in Geneva, commissioned in 2001 for the
study of neutron induced reactions for nuclear technology, nu-
clear astrophysics, and nuclear structure and reaction physics.
Up to now, the facility has been mainly used to measure
neutron capture and fission cross sections of a large number
of isotopes.

2 The neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF
at CERN

The construction and commissioning of a new neutron time-
of-flight facility at CERN, after an idea proposed by Rubbia



F. Gunsing et al.: Neutron resonance spectroscopy at n TOF at CERN 539

et al. [25], was finished in 2001. The facility has become
fully operational with the start of the scientific measurement
programme in May 2002.

The facility delivers neutrons produced by spallation re-
actions induced by a pulsed, 6 ns wide, 20 GeV/c proton
beam with up to 7 × 1012 protons per pulse, impinging on a
80 × 80 × 60 cm3 lead target, yielding about 300 neutrons per
incident proton. A 5 cm water slab surrounding the lead target
serves as a coolant and at the same time as a moderator of
the initially fast neutron spectrum, providing a wide energy
spectrum from thermal to about 250 MeV with a nearly 1/E
isolethargic flux dependence from 1 eV up to 1 MeV. A vac-
uum neutron beam line leads to the experimental area at 185 m
from the lead target. A full description of the characteristics
and performances of the facility is described elsewhere [26].
An outline will be given here.

The neutron beam is obtained by means of two collimators,
consisting of layers of iron and borated polyethylene. The
iron serves to stop fast neutrons, while the hydrogen in
polyethylene moderates the neutrons, and 10B captures the
slower neutrons. The first collimator has an inner diameter
of 11 cm, an outer diameter of 50 cm and is placed at 135 m
from the lead target. The second collimator is located near
the experimental area at a distance of 175 m and has an outer
diameter of 40 cm a variable inner diameter. Typically an
inner diameter of 1.8 cm is used for capture measurements
and 8 cm for fission experiments. This collimation results
in a nearly symmetric Gaussian-shaped beam profile at the
sample position with a standard deviation of about 0.77 cm
at low neutron energies with the 1.8 cm diameter collimator.
The spatial distribution has been accurately measured and
modelled as a function of neutron energy [27].

In order to remove residual charged particles going along
the neutron beam line, a 1.5 T sweeping magnet has been
placed at a distance of 145 m of the spallation target. A
previously observed background, presumably due to capture
of negative muons, has been drastically reduced by means
of a 3 m thick iron shielding located just after the sweeping
magnet [28,29]. The experimental area where the samples
and detectors are mounted for capture and fission experiments
ranges from 182 to 190 m. It will be described in more detail
in the next section. The neutron beam line is extended for an
additional 12 m beyond the experimental area to minimize the
background from back-scattered neutrons.

In order to perform background measurements by filtering
the neutron beam at specific energies by means of the black
resonance method, a multifilter changer has been installed in
the beam line upstream of the first collimator.

The neutron kinetic energy is determined by time of flight.
This is possible since the proton beam is pulsed. The impact
of the proton beam on the lead target is closely related to
the creation time of neutrons of all energies. The detection
of a reaction product of a neutron-induced reaction in the
experimental area provides the time the neutron has taken to
travel the distance from the spallation target to the experi-
mental area. The velocity and hence the kinetic energy of the
neutron can be deduced from the flight time and the flight
distance. The repetition period of the proton pulses is at least
2.4 seconds, which is low enough to cover the energy range

down to subthermal energies and to prevent overlapping of
slow neutrons in subsequent cycles.

2.1 Beam characteristics

A pulsed white neutron source is characterized by the energy
distribution of its neutron flux, both time-averaged and per
time-of-flight bunch, but also by its energy resolution. The
energy distribution of the neutron flux at the sample position at
185 m for a standard time-of-flight bunch of 7 × 1012 protons
is shown in figure 2. The data are based on a measurement
performed with a 235U loaded parallel plate fission ionization
chamber from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in
Braunschweig [30], and below 1 keV from a 6Li-based in-
beam neutron flux monitor [31]. The 6Li-based flux detector is
always present during the measurements. The flux per bunch
governs the signal to noise ratio. In capture experiments a high
flux per bunch results in a favorable ratio of gamma rays from
(n,γ) reactions to gamma rays from radioactivity. In order to
obtain the average flux, which is relevant for the duration of
the experiment, one just multiplies the instantaneous flux with
the repetition rate of the proton beam.

At higher neutron energies the reaction cross sections
do not show the resonance structure anymore and have a
smooth behaviour. Therefore an approximate knowledge of
the energy resolution is sufficient. At lower energies in the
resolved resonance region however the cross section can vary
several orders of magnitude over a few electronvolt. There the
full distribution of the energy resolution, which is often non-
Gaussian, is needed to determine accurately the description of
the resonances.

The resolution in energy for a measured flight time can
conveniently be expressed in terms of a spread in the effective
flight distance. The distribution of this equivalent distance is
an appropriate quantity to evaluate the resolution as a function
of neutron energy. We obtained the resolution function of the
n TOF facility by two independent simulation codes giving
consistent results [32,33]. The Monte Carlo results were then
fitted by an analytical two-dimensional function and imple-
mented in the resonance shape analysis code SAMMY [34].
In figure 3 the resolution function in the form of the equivalent
distance distribution is shown in the relevant energy range
from 1 eV to 1 MeV on a logarithmic scale.

2.2 Detectors and data acquisition

Several detectors have been used during the first phase of
data taking from 2002 to 2004 for the capture and fission
experiments.

In-house developed deuterated benzene C6D6 gamma-ray
detectors contained in a cylindrical low mass carbon fibre
housing [35] have been used for neutron capture measure-
ments on several isotopes. The samples were kept in position
by a carbon fiber sample changer. The low neutron capture
cross sections of both carbon and deuterium assure a low
contribution from sample scattered neutrons to the back-
ground. Since this detector does not measure the full gamma-
ray cascade following neutron capture, it requires the use of
weighting functions to reconstruct the neutron capture yield
[36,37]. Although the detection efficiency for a single detector
is only about 3% for a 1 MeV gamma-ray, due to the gamma-
ray multiplicity after neutron capture, the efficiency to detect
a capture event is roughly 20% for the set of two detectors.

A second neutron capture detector has become availabe in
2004 [38–40]. It consists of a 4π 100% efficiency total absorp-
tion capture detector, made up of 40 BaF2 crystals contained
in 10B loaded carbon fibre capsules, coupled to XP4512B
photomultipliers equipped with for this purpose designed
voltage dividers. Samples are surrounded by a C12H20O4(

6Li)2
neutron absorber which moderates and absorbs sample scat-
tered neutrons. The ensemble is placed in the center of the
calorimeter. Since this detector is used to select the total
gamma-ray cascade from neutron capture, it can distinguish
gamma rays originating from other processes.

For the capture measurements the reaction yields are
normalized either to the cross section of 197Au(n,γ), which
is a standard in the energy region above 200 keV, or to a
low-energy saturated resonance in a 197Au reference sample
or in the sample to be measured itself.

Fission experiments have been performed with two dif-
ferent detector systems. Two Fission Ionization Chambers
(FIC) have been developed for use at the n TOF facility using
deposits of fissile isotopes on 100 µm thick aluminum foils.
The FIC-0 detector was used for the low activity samples
while the FIC-1 detector was used for the samples with higher
activity [41].

The second type of fission detector is based on Parallel
Plate Avalanche Counters (PPACs), developed with target de-
posits on 1.5 µm thin mylar or 2 µm aluminum foils, allowing
to detect the two fission fragments in coincidence [42].

In both fission detectors the cross sections are determined
relative to the 235U(n,f) standard, measured in the same
detector.

The relative incident neutron flux, i.e. the shape of the
neutron kinetic energy distribution of the flux, is continu-
ously measured during the experiments with the previously
described 6Li-based flux detector [31]. In addition, three
10BF3 detectors are installed in the neutron escape line for
monitoring purposes.

The data acquisition system [43] is based on the sampling
of the detector signals in order to extract the deposited energy
and the time of flight. An array of 54 Acqiris flash ADCs
with 8 bit amplitude resolution and 1 ns sampling interval with
8 Mbytes of memory was used to record the full detector signal
following the start time given by the incident protons.

The digitizers were operated at 500 Msamples/s allowing
to store the detector signal during 16 ms, corresponding to
a time-of-flight of 0.7 eV. Sampling the full detector signal
after the neutron burst allows to fully eliminate the dead
time related to the signal recording. An effective value of the
dead time of about 25 nanoseconds, for which a correction
is applied, is related to the software for pulse extraction.
After zero suppression, the data are transferred to CERNs data
storage facility CASTOR for off-line analysis with dedicated
pulse shape analysis routines for each detector.

3 Cross secion measurements

During the first phase of data taking two types of cross
section experiments have been performed, neutron capture
cross section measurements with the C6D6 and BaF2 detectors,
and neutron induced fission measurements with the FIC and
PPAC detectors. A summary of these measurements is given
in table 1.

Capture measurements with the C6D6 detectors concerned

207Pb [52], 208Pb, 209Bi [53,54], and 232Th [55]. The BaF2 4π
calorimeter has been used for measurements of 197Au [49],
233U [39], 234U [40], and 237Np, 240Pu, and 243Am [38].

Several of these measurements are still under analysis,
while for others final data have been published. The only
fissile isotope that has been measured during this campaign is

233U, as a test to distinguish between gamma rays originating
from capture and fission reactions. Most of the radioactive
samples could not be used in mass-less supports because
of safety regulations but had to be contained in titanium
cannings.

Capture experiments are generally performed with one
sample in the beam per measurement. The sample masses can
be relatively high without disturbing the measurement. For
fission experiments on the contrary, the samples should be thin
enough so that fission fragments can leave the sample and be
detected. For this reason the available mass is therefore best
divided over a larger surface. These thin samples allow the
measurement of several different isotopes simultaneously.

The fission cross sections measured with the FIC-0 detec-
tor were the isotopes 232Th, 234U, 235U, 236U, 238U, and 237Np,
while the isotopes 233U, 235U, 238U 241Am, 243Am, and 245Cm
were measured in the ISO-2919 compliant FIC-1 detector. An
overview and status of the analysis given in ref. [41].

With the fission detectors based on Parallel Plate
Avalanche Counters (PPACs) cross sections of natPb, 209Bi,
232Th, 237Np, 233U, 234U, 235U, 238U have been measured, as
described in more detail in ref. [42].

4 Concluding remarks

After the successful completion of data taking during the first
phase of the n TOF facility from 2002 to 2004, the installation
has not been running in the period 2005–2007. An upgrade
of the infrastructure of the facility is expected in 2007 and a
new series of capture and fission measurements is planned for
a second phase of operation. On the longer term, we plan to
construct a second flight path at the shorter distance of 20 m
for a third phase. In view of this purpose, several studies for
a possible new spallation target have been performed, see for
example ref. [56].

Capture measurements on radioactive isotopes take advan-
tage of the high instantaneous flux at the n TOF facility while
both capture and fission measurements benefit from the large
energy range that can be measured in a single experiment.
One of the challenges to be addressed in the near future is
the improvement of the measurement of capture in presence
of fission. Capture measurements of fissile isotopes will need
considerable detector developments.

The short flight path with an increased flux of about a
factor of hundred allows to perform measurements with very
low mass samples and opens a wide range of new possibilities
for neutron time-of-flight measurements.
