Abstract. The 33S(n,α)30Si cross section measurement, using 10B(n,α) as reference, at the n TOF
Experimental Area 2 (EAR2) facility at CERN is presented. Data from 0.01 eV to 100 keV are provided
and, for the first time, the cross section is measured in the range from 0.01 eV to 10 keV. These data may be
used for a future evaluation of the cross section because present evaluations exhibit large discrepancies. The
33S(n,α)30Si reaction is of interest in medical physics because of its possible use as a cooperative target to
boron in Neutron Capture Therapy (NCT).

1. Introduction
The neutron time-of-flight, n TOF, facility [1] is a neutron
spallation beam facility at the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN), mainly dedicated to measure
neutron-induced cross sections for nuclear technology
[2,3], astrophysics [4,5] and medical physics [6,7]. A
pulsed proton beam, with momentum of 20 GeV/c, is
produced in the Proton Synchrotron accelerator (PS)
at CERN. The proton beam impinges on a cylindrical
lead target surrounded by water for cooling and neutron
moderation purposes, and generates a large number
of neutrons by spallation reactions. The neutron beam
characteristics, the state-of-the-art of detectors and data
acquisition systems make n TOF a unique facility for
measuring neutron induced reaction cross section of very
radioctive isotopes as for identifying and studying reso-
nances in neutron cross sections. During the first 13 years
of operation, the only experimental room was located
underground at 185 m from the spallation target along the
horizontal direction, n TOF-EAR1 [8], characterized by
a high instantaneous flux (106 neutrons/bunch), a wide
neutron energy range (from 25 meV to over 1 GeV) and
good energy resolution for most of the energy range,
�E/E=10−4 [9]. In 2014, a new experimental hall, n TOF-
EAR2 [10,11], was built at 20 m from the target above
the ground in the vertical direction. The main advantage
of n TOF-EAR2 with respect to the existing one is the 30
to 40 times higher neutron flux, offering the possibility of
measuring thin targets of radioactive material with short
half-lives as well as reactions with low cross sections [12].

In this work it is presented the preliminary result of
the 33S(n,α)30Si cross section in the energy range from
0.01 eV to 100 keV. The high flux at low neutron energies
at n TOF-EAR2 and the experimental set-up [13], which
consisted of an ionization chamber with micro-megas
detectors in combination with optimized low level noise
electronics, has allowed providing for the first time data
below 10 keV. 10B(n,α)7Li has been used as reference
because it is considered a standard cross section [14] in
the energy range under study.

The 33S(n,α) reaction is of interest in astrophysics due
to the still open question about the origin of 36S [15]
but also in Neutron Capture Therapy (NTC). 33S could

be used in combination with 10B for treating superficial
tumours [16] in accelerator based neutron sources where
the energy of the neutron beam is in the epithermal energy
region within which 33S(n,α) shows resonances with a
cross section higher than the one of 10B(n,α) reaction. In a
previous work [17], the enhancement of the physical dose
in the first 2 cm of tissue due to the presence of 33S in the
medium has been demostrated by means of Monte Carlo
simulations for a realistic NCT set-up.

2. Nuclear data status
The 33S(n,α)30Si cross section data are scarce with
no experimental data below 10 keV and important
discrepancies at 0.0253 eV. Only one measurement was
able to resolve and analyze resonances [18]. However,
it showed a factor of two discrepancy in the resonance
parameters in comparison to the sole existing transmission
measurement [19], although both experiments were
analyzed in collaboration. Therefore, the main motivation
for the present work was to provide a complete data set
from 0.0253 eV to hundreds of keV. Up to now, the 1/v
behaviour below resonances has not been experimentally
confirmed and low energy resonances, below 10 keV,
may exist in view of the work performed for the
reverse reaction, 30Si(α,n)33S [20] from which data for
33S(n,α)30Si can be obtained using the principle of detailed
balance.

Moreover, evaluated nuclear data files, see Fig. 1,
diverge not only in the value of the cross section in the
resonance region but also above the thermal point with
unrealistic behaviours from 0.0253 eV to 10 keV. Only
EAF-2010 includes the observed resonances, but with an
average cross section value ten times lower than reported
in Ref. [18].

3. 33S(n,α) measurement at n TOF-EAR2
In 2012, a measurement of the 33S(n,α) cross section
was performed at n TOF-EAR1 [21] with the aim of
solving the discrepancy in the resonance parameters.
Nevertherless, no data below 10 keV were obtained. The
present measurement at EAR2 will complete the data set

taking advantage of the higher neutron flux specially at low
neutron energy.

3.1. Experimental set-up

A low-mass gaseous micromegas detector [22], based
on micro-bulk technology [23] was used, which is
characterized by a high signal to background ratio,
radiation resistance, its high efficiency and minimal
perturbation for the neutron beam. These features make
it the most suitable detector for a successful in-beam
measurement. A micromegas detector has two gas volumes
separated by a 5 µm thick micro-mesh layer. The first
volume is the conversion gap, with a thickness of few
millimiters, where the ionization processes take place. The
electrons produced are drifting through the electric field
of ∼ 1 kV/cm to the mesh. The second volume, typically
50 µm in thickness is characterized by a high electric field
of ≥ 10 kV/cm, where the signal is amplified by electron
multiplication via avalanche processes. It works inside a
chamber filled with a mixture of 88% Ar, 10% CF4 and
2% iC4H10 at atmospheric pressure.

In back-to-back configuration, four micromegas were
loaded, as seen by the beam, with a 20 nm thick 10B4C
sample, a 2.6·10−7 at/barn 33S sample, a blank target made
of the same material as the 33S backing for background
determination, and another 3.7·10−7 at/barn 33S deposit
(Fig. 2).

3.2. Cross section determination

The reaction yield of a specific reaction channel is the
probability for a neutron to undergo that reaction. The
theoretical reaction yield, Y th, includes the contribution
of the primary and the multiple interaction events whitin
the sample. In case of thin layers or small cross sections,
n·σtot � 1, the multiple scattering becomes negligible, and
Y th≈ n·σr , where σr is the reaction cross section and n

to 100 keV and a comparison of the result with Wagemans et al.
[18] folded with the n TOF energy response function (inset).

is the areal density of the target deposit. However, even
more important for the thin target approximation to be
valid is that the self-shielding becomes negligible. The
experimental yield, Y exp, can be obtatined as:

Y exp = C − B
ε · � · Np

(1)

where C-B is the total number of background corrected
counts in the detection system, � is the neutron flux per
proton pulse integrated over the full area of the beam, Np
the total number of protons used for the measurement, ε the
effective detection efficiency of a reaction product which
is the combination of a set of energy- and non energy-
dependent parameters such as the angular distribution
of the nuclear reaction and the geometrical efficiency.
Combining Y th and Y exp, the absolute value of the reaction
cross section can be obtained as:

σr =
C − B

ε · � · Np · n
(2)

In order to extract the neutron flux, a reference target with
a standard cross section is installed in the detector system.
Using the same principle exposed in Eq. (1), the flux can
be extracted and replaced in Eq. (2):

σr =
[

C − B
ε · Np · n

·
(

ε · Np · n
C − B

)
10 B(n,α)

]
· σr (10 B(n, α))

3.3. Results

Figure 3 shows the preliminary energy dependent cross
section of 33S(n,α), using 10B(n,α) as reference reaction in
the energy range of interest. As mentioned before, the cross
section has been measured in this energy region for the
first time and was found to follow a 1/v behaviour below
100 eV. In addition, an enhacement of the cross section can
be noticed from 100 eV to 3 keV deviating from the 1/v
tendency. This region corresponds with the 2.3 and 0.3 keV
resonances predicted from the reverse reaction [20]. The
inset in Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the first resonance
(at 13.5 keV) between the present work and Ref. [18]
convoluted with the n TOF energy response function [24].

The cross section at 0.0253 eV has been obtained to
142±25 mb, within uncertainties in agreement with the
previous measurements of 180±80mb [25], 151±22 mb
[26] and 140±30 mb [27]. The uncertainty of the present
value is the quadratic sum of the uncertainties due to the
sample mass, systematics and counting statistics effects.

4. Conclusions
The preliminary data of the 33S(n,α)30Si cross section
measured at the n TOF-EAR2 facility at CERN from
0.01 eV to 100 keV has been determined using the 10B(n,α)
cross section as a reference. The obtained value at
0.0253 eV is within previous measurements. From 0.01 to
100 eV the cross section follows a 1/v shape, but deviates
from this trend between 0.1 to 3 keV, where resonances
were predicted by experiments from the reverse reaction.
Furthermore, experimental data are provided below 10 keV
for the first time.

This result completes the measurement performed at
n TOF-EAR1 in 2012 which was mainly focused on the
resonance region, above 10 keV. The comparison of the
resonance parameters of the first resonances between the
two measurements is ongoing. In a future work, the new
data will be included in Monte Carlo simulations of the
kerma rate in depth in order to obtain a more accurate
estimation of the effect of 33S on BNCT.
