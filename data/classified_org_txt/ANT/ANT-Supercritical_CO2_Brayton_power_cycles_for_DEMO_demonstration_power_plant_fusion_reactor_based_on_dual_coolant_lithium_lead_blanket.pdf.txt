ABSTRACT 

Fusion energy is one of the most promising solutions to the world’s energy supply. This paper presents 

an exploratory analysis of the suitability of supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycles as alternative energy 

conversion systems for a future fusion reactor based on a dual coolant lithium-lead (DCLL) blanket, as 

prescribed by EUROfusion. The main issue dealt is the optimization of the integration of the different 

thermal sources with the power cycle (up to four at different power and temperature levels) in order to 

achieve the highest electricity production. The analysis includes the assessment of the pumping 

consumption both in the source loops as in the sink one. Other considerations, as control issues and 

integration of thermal energy storage systems to face the pulsed operation, have been also taken into 

account. An exergy analysis has been performed in order to understand the behavior of each layout.  

 

Up to ten scenarios have been analyzed, taking into account the heat power released from some thermal 

sources directly to the sink and assessing different locations for thermal sources heat exchangers. 

Neglecting the worst four scenarios, it is observed less than 2% of variation among the other six ones. 

One of the best six scenarios clearly stands out over the others due to the location of the thermal sources 

in a unique island, being this scenario compatible with the control criteria. In this proposal 34.6% of 

electric efficiency (before the self-consumptions of the reactor but including pumping consumptions and 

generator efficiency) is achieved.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Fusion energy is one of the most promising solutions to the world´s energy problem. Among its most 

outstanding features are intrinsic safety, management of environmental impact, and long-term 

availability of primary fuels (deuterium and lithium). In view of that potential, the European 

Commission requested EFDA (European Fusion Development Agreement) to prepare a technical 

roadmap to achieve fusion electricity by 2050 [1]. This included two main milestones: ITER 

(International Tokamak Experimental Reactor) and DEMO (DEMOnstration Power Plant). The main 

objective of ITER is to demonstrate the technological feasibility of fusion energy by producing net 

thermal energy and testing the required materials [2]. DEMO will be a bridge between ITER and 

commercial fusion power plants, demonstrating the feasibility of the integration of all the required 

systems (reactor and balance of plant) to operate a fusion power plant, including issues of security, 

wastes management, maintenance, and so on. The main factors affecting the cost of fusion energy are 

clearly identified [1], being a relevant issue the power conversion cycle, which is strongly conditioned 

by the chosen model reactor. As a consequence, the EUROfusion consortium (former EFDA) strategy 

includes a program for Balance of Plant (BoP) modeling, analysis and evaluation [3]. 

 

The breeding blanket is the main thermal source for the power conversion cycle in a fusion reactor. 

Depending on its cooling medium, four types of blankets are distinguished: Water Cooled Lithium Lead 

(WCLL), Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL), Dual Cooled Lithium Lead (DCLL), and Self Cooled 

Lithium Lead (SCLL). The second thermal source in order of importance is the divertor, a device 

devoted to collect the plasma waste. This thermal source can operate at high (above 500 ºC) or low 

temperature (below 250 ºC), depending on the coolant medium (helium for high and water for low 

temperature). Finally, the vacuum vessel cooling can also supply heat to the conversion power cycle, 

although in the lowest temperature and power range [4]. 

 

DCLL blanket is considered as a mid-term option for fusion power plants with medium (500 ºC) and 

high temperatures (700 ºC) in the long-term. The coolants are an eutectic of lithium-lead (LL) and 

helium (He), avoiding the use of water which exhibits complex problems due to its interaction with 

tritium. Although helium is used as coolant, it only removes part of the power released by the blanket 

(around 40%), so the pumping power is lower than in a HCLL blanket. The high temperature range of 

the long-term blanket entails the use of Brayton power cycles which do not use water as working fluid, 

simplifying the tritium removal again. These high temperature blanket Brayton cycles using helium as 

working fluid were analyzed in [5], concluding that the expected temperatures are not high enough to 

achieve high efficiencies. This type of power cycles require temperatures in the range of 850-900 ºC to 

achieve good efficiencies, as found for Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR) in fission Generation 

IV designs [6]. In the case of mid-term blanket design (temperatures lower than 500 ºC) the use of 

supercritical CO2 as working fluid in the Brayton cycle (S-CO2) is more promising, as it has been 



 - 4 - 

explored in Sodium Fast Reactors (SFR) in Generation IV designs [7]. In these types of power plants the 

S-CO2 cycle has revealed as an advantageous alternative to more classical Rankine cycles, both 

supercritical and subcritical configurations [8]. Medrano et al. [9] have analyzed the feasibility of the S-

CO2 cycle as an alternative to steam Rankine cycles in fusion reactors based on HCLL blankets. 

Ishiyama et al. [10] studied the use of S-CO2, steam Rankine and helium Brayton cycles for fusion 

reactors based on both HCLL and WCLL blankets. In [11] a detailed analysis of its technical feasibility 

for fusion reactors based on HCLL blanket can be found and in  [12], an analysis for a high temperature 

fusion reactor based on a long-term DCLL blanket is presented. 

 

The Brayton cycle, working with an ideal gas (air or helium), requires high temperature in the thermal 

source in order to compensate the high consumption of the compressor. The use of CO2 as working fluid 

allows Brayton cycle to overcome the high demand of compression power by entering the compression 

stage at a higher pressure than the critical one, so that CO2 specific volume is not as large as if it was an 

ideal gas. Recuperative layouts achieve high efficiencies but the cycle low pressure is very close to the 

critical value, which complicates the matching of the temperature profiles. It is therefore usual to split 

the recuperator in two heat exchangers in order to enhance their effectiveness. Such layout is known as 

re-compression cycle due to the use of an auxiliary compressor. Dostal compiled the fundamentals of the 

cycle and deepened in its performance, including heat exchanger designs, economy and turbomachinery 

[13]. Sarkar et al. [14] conducted a second law analysis of a S-CO2 power cycle, founding another one 

based on entropy generation in [11].  The most outstanding feature of S-CO2 cycles with respect to 

Rankine ones is probably their remarkable compactness. Other characteristics, though, are less 

favorable. Precooling, for instance, is rather complex. If the cycle low pressure is near the critical one 

(typically 75 bar), CO2 specific heat experiences a very sharp peak at low temperatures, hindering heat 

transfer. Additionally, such low pressures mean heat rejection at very low temperature differences, 

which requires high water mass flow rates (i.e., a high pumping power) at the secondary side of the heat 

exchanger. These issues can be overcome by increasing the suction pressure to around 85 bar, being this 

value a right balance between CO2 properties variation and efficiency [11]. 

 

Three issues have been identified in the S-CO2 Brayton cycle: compressor stability, turbomachinery 

design and low performance of scaled prototypes. The expected compressor stability problems are 

related with the sharp variation of properties near the critical point, changing from liquid to vapor typical 

values. Baltadjiev et al. [15] forecast stability problems due to condensation of CO2 inside the 

compressor, caused by acceleration. However, experimental measurements done at Sandia National 

Laboratory (SNL) [16] demonstrated stable operation in the steady state and the start-up, with the 

suction close to the critical point, even inside the dome. They justified this stable behavior due to the 

low density ratio (liquid/vapor) of the CO2 in such stages. Regarding the turbomachinery design, the 

main problem is found in the compressor design due to, again, its closeness to the critical point, where 



 - 5 - 

the use of typical correlations for ideal gases [17] can entail to wrong solutions. Dyreby [18] overcame 

this issue by adjusting the non-dimensionless coefficients of turbomachinery to experimental data 

performed at SNL. Finally, the low performance obtained with scale prototypes is a common problem in 

all laboratories, due to limitations in maintaining the similarity parameters [19]. This means that 

performance values will be better when real-scale devices will be tested. 

 

The expected operation of DEMO, at least in the near and mid-term, is in pulsed mode due to coil 

limitations [1]. This performance entails to the intermittency management of the energy source, in a 

similar way than in a concentrated solar plant (CSP). The technical feasibility of the S-CO2 has also been 

analyzed for CSP, especially for central tower systems, where the compactness of the power plant shows 

integration advantages. So, SunShot Project promoted by the Department of Energy of USA seeks to 

develop a megawatt-scale S-CO2 cycle optimized for the highly transient solar power plant profile [20]. 

In [21] a thorough description is given, including a thermal energy storage system based on molten salts 

to extend the operation hours. S-CO2 power cycles show a good behavior under short solar oscillations 

along a day, whereas thermal energy storage systems (typically molten salts) might be used to face to 

longer oscillations [22]. In [23] the control strategies for CSP power plants are discussed. The former 

analyses entail to consider this power conversion system as an alternative to DCLL blankets in the mid-

term, being included by EUROfusion in its activity program for 2014-2018 period [3].  

 

From the experimental point of view, the first experiences were carried out by Akagawa et al. [24] 

working with condensation cycles (low pressure cycle below the critical point). These tests pursued the 

replacement of Rankine cycles for inlet turbine temperatures higher than 650 ºC. In the last years 

different laboratories have carried out new tests thinking of nuclear and solar applications. Sienicki et al. 

[25] described tests for heat exchangers at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and a compressor loop 

at Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA). In the Czech Republic the stability of volumetric compressors 

has been investigated at Bechovice Research Institute [26], planning a future laboratory for 

turbomachinery analyses at Rez Nuclear Research Institute [27]. Tokyo Institute of Technology is 

working in an experimental compressor loop [28] and a recompression plant for power production from 

waste heat sources of low and intermediate temperatures [19]. Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute 

(KAERI) is constructing a facility for testing conversion systems at different stages: compressors, 

simple layout (non-recuperated) and recuperated layout (without recompression) [29]. SNL studied the 

Brayton power cycle using different ideal gases, far from their critical point in 2006 [30]. This analysis 

entailed to the S-CO2 power cycle, constructing a compressor loop and a complete cycle in un-

recuperated layout [31], a recuperated layout [32] and finally a re-compression layout [33]. Future plans 

include the construction of the Nuclear Energy System Laboratory/Brayton Lab, with a 10 MWe power 

plant for SFR in 2020 [34]. Operation has been tested by Echogen Power Systems in 2010 building a 

250 kWe unit (recuperated layout but no-recompression) which was installed at American Electric 



 - 6 - 

Power (Ohio) working for one year. From this experience a 7.5 MWe unit was built and tested in 2013 

[35]. National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) is intending a facility to analyze the feasibility of S-CO2 

power cycle in CSP. The facility will test a unit of 10 MWe with 700 ºC of turbine inlet temperature and 

dry cooling conditions, collaborating with SNL and Echogen Power Systems [20]. SNL is also involved 

with the Indian Institute of Science (IIS) in the development of a facility with a recuperated cycle for 

CSP applications [36]. 

 

Special attention should be paid to the heat exchangers due to its relevant role in the cycle efficiency. 

The Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger (PCHE) is a rather novel heat exchanger type, formed by diffusion 

bonding of a stack of plates, with fluid passages photo-chemically etched on one side of each plate, by 

using a technique derived from that employed for electronic printed circuit boards –hence the name. 

Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) [37] and KAERI [38] proposed them for Generation IV designs 

and KAERI included them in an experimental helium loop to test a design for a fusion reactor based on 

an helium cooled molten lithium (HCML) blanket [39]. A benchmarking survey with actual prototypes 

of reactors can be found in [40], with thermal effectiveness from 92 % to 98.7 %; SNL [41] supports 

their use for both recuperators, heat entry to the power cycle and heat rejection from the cycle, 

highlighting the benefits of PCHE compactness; Mito et al. [42] draw attention to the reduced pressure 

drop and Gezelius [43] gave ratios of 58 to 98 MW/m3 for PCHE against 6.2 MW/m3 with shell and tube 

heat exchangers working at the same capacity and log mean temperature difference. In [44] a procedure 

for sizing can be found. In [45] permeation in a new design of compact heat exchanger for a fusion 

reactor using a DCLL blanket is analyzed, showing that when using silicon carbide as structural material 

the permeation is practically non-existent. 

 

In this paper a Brayton cycle using supercritical CO2 as working fluid is proposed as the power 

conversion system for a DCLL fusion reactor. The main faced issue is the integration of the available 

thermal sources to maximize the electricity production. Pumping consumptions in the cooling loops of 

the reactor and heat release from the cycle have been included in the performance assessment. Besides 

the electricity production, operational issues as control easiness have also been taken into account. In 

addition, an exergy analysis has been carried out to improve the understanding of the analyzed layouts. 

In short, the technical feasibility of S-CO2 for a DEMO fusion reactor based on DCLL has been 

assessed.

2. METHODOLOGY 

2.1. Thermal specifications of the DEMO reactor 

Figure 1 shows a sketch of the balance of plant of the DEMO reactor based on the DCLL blanket. It is 
observed that the reactor supplies heat to the power cycle from four different thermal sources: breeding 
blanket cooled by lithium-lead (BBLL), breeding blanket structure cooled by helium (BBHe), divertor 
(DIV) and vacuum vessel (VV). Each source delivers a different amount of thermal power at different 
ranges of temperature, using its own cooling medium. This information is compiled in Tables 1 and 2, 
together with additional thermo-hydraulic data. Due to the geometry of the vessel (banana shape) in the 
breeding blanket cooled by lithium-lead is necessary to distinguish between the layer closer to the 
plasma (Inboard modules, IB) and the outer one (outboard modules, OB); it is noticeable the high 
pressure drop in the former due to magneto-hydrodynamic effects. 

As it is sketched in Figure 1, the cooling loop between every thermal source and the power cycle has 
been considered. Specifications in Tables 1 and 2 entail to the thermal power absorbed by the cooling 
medium from the reactor. To obtain the one supplied to the power cycle it is necessary to add the 
pumping consumption. Pump isentropic efficiencies have been set to 85% for liquids (lithium-lead and 
water) and 82% for helium. Pressure drop on the coolant side of heat exchangers connecting the primary 
loop with the power cycle has been assumed as 1 % [46], except for the lithium-lead that a value of 10 
kPa has been assumed, due to the low pressure (1 bar) at the hot stream inlet. Table 3 shows the 
pumping consumption at each loop together with the state points. Figure 2 shows the detailed loop in the 
breeding blanket cooled by lithium-lead, with two branches in parallel for IB and OB modules. In the 
rest of loops only one branch is necessary.

As in any power cycle it is necessary to release thermal power to the sink, which adds a new power 

consumption. This one has been obtained assuming 5 bar of overall pressure drop and 5 C of 

temperature increment. These assumptions entail to assess this consumption as 2.4 % of the heat 

released to the sink. 

 

Regarding to the Figure 1 it is possible to identify three different mechanical/electrical powers from the 

heat power released by the reactor to the busbar power:  

 

 Cycle (Wcy). Net mechanical power produced by the power cycle, that is, the power produced by 

turbine minus the power consumed by compressors. This can be related with the heat supplied to 

the power cycle through the cycle efficiency (cy).  

 Gross (Wgross). Electrical power produced by the generator. An efficiency of 97 % has been 

assumed [46]. This power can be related with the heat released by the reactor through the gross 

efficiency (gross). 

 Electric (We). Electrical power after removing from the gross power the one required for 

pumping the coolants in both primary and tertiary loops (heat sink). This power can be related 

with the heat released by the reactor through the electric efficiency (e).  

 Net (Wnet). Electrical busbar power after removing from the electric power the one required for 

heating and current drive in the plasma and other parasitic loads. This power can be related with 

the heat released by the reactor through the net efficiency (net). Unfortunately overall self-

consumptions (Waux) have not been specified so net power cannot be assessed.

2.2 Main assumptions 

In order to compare the results from the different layouts the same settings have been considered, 

whenever possible: 

 Properties of substances. All the models have been developed in the Engineering Equation 

Solver (EES) environment, which includes models of pure substances [50]. So, CO2 has been 

modelled as a pure substance; Helium as a pure substance except in the exergy analysis where 

an ideal gas model with constant specific heats has been considered; Water as a pure substance 

except in the exergy analysis where it has been considered as an incompressible liquid; and 

lithium-lead as an incompressible liquid (specific heat as 189 J/kg-K and density as 9726 kg/m3 

[51]). 

 

 Compressor inlet. At the main compressor, conditions of 85 bar and 30 C have been 

considered. This pressure exhibits a reasonable balance between the closeness to critical 

pressure and prevention of potential stability problems, if any [52]. Inlet auxiliary compressor 

conditions are 85.4 bar and temperature depending on the LTR outlet one. 

 

 Turbine inlet. 280 bar has been taken as the turbine inlet pressure, being the temperature in a 

range between 380 C to 434 C, depending on the constrains imposed by the rest of the 

components in each layout (especially the pinch points at thermal sources heat exchangers).  

 

 Heat exchangers. Printed circuit heat exchangers (PCHE) have been considered because of their 

excellent resistance to high pressures and their high compactness, with the possibility to achieve 

pinch points as small as 2 C (effectiveness around 98 %) [40]. The approach temperature (at the 

heat exchanger extremes) at Low Temperature Recuperator (LTR) has been set to 7 C in order 

to obtain an actual pinch point (inside the heat exchanger) close to 5 C (always higher than 4 

C). On the other hand, the pinch point at the High Temperature Recuperator (HTR) has been 

set to 25 C due to its expected small influence in the performance of the cycle [52]. In order to 

determine the mass flow rate through the auxiliary compressor an equal approach temperature at 

both extremes of the LTR has been imposed [52]. The pinch point in the rest of heat exchangers 

has been determined by the set of equations. The pressure drop on the CO2 side of all the heat 

exchangers has been set to 40 kPa [9]. 

 

 Turbomachinery efficiency. An isentropic efficiency of 88 % has been set for compressors and 

93 % for turbine, according with usual values at S-CO2 cycles [53].

2.3 Proposed layouts 

Figure 3 shows a sketch of the classical re-compression supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycle. It is 

basically a recuperative Brayton cycle with two especial key points: the lower pressure in the cycle is 

above the critical value (around 85 bar) in order to reduce the compressor consumption due to the high 

density in its suction; the recuperator is split in two heat exchangers in order to enhance the matching of 

the temperature profiles inside the recuperator, due to the high value of the specific heat of CO2 at low 

temperatures (70 ºC – 150 ºC) and high pressure, that is, in the cold stream of its low temperature 

section. So, the cycle integrates two recuperators, one for high temperature (HTR) and another for low 

temperature (LTR). In the latter, the mass flow rate of the high pressure stream is lower than the one in 

the low pressure stream in order to compensate the higher specific heat value of the high pressure 

stream. In the HTR both specific heat values are similar, so the mass flow rate is the same in both 

streams. In order to reduce the mass flow rate in the high pressure stream of the LTR, a fraction is bled 

into the auxiliary compressor (AC) before entering the precooler (PC). This fraction is mixed with the 

high pressure stream leaving the LTR, before entering the HTR to recover the heat from the turbine (T) 

outlet. The maximum efficiency is achieved when the by-passed flow rate fraction is chosen to obtain 

the same temperature difference at both extremes of the LTR [11]. In the precooler the cycle releases 

heat to the sink, being then the CO2 suctioned  by the main compressor (MC).

The classical re-compression layout has to be modified in order to integrate the different available 

thermal sources from the reactor. On one hand, three cases of integration have been selected: one is 

considering only the breeding blanket supplying heat to the power cycle (BB), other is considering both 

the breeding blanket and divertor (BB-DIV) and another one is including all the thermal sources (BB-

DIV-VV). In each case, up to four possibilities of integration of the sources have been considered (A to 

D), depending of the position of each source heat exchanger. When a thermal source does not supply 

thermal energy to the power cycle, its heat is released to the sink. Figure 4 summarizes all the layouts 

analysed.  

 

 

Figure 4. Summary of proposed layouts 

 

Figure 5 gives the different layouts for the sink loop. In all the cases the water absorbs the heat released 

by the power cycle in the precooler. In the BB-DIV case a second loop is added to release the heat from 

the vacuum vessel source. Also,  a third loop is added in the BB case to release the heat from the 

divertor source. In the second and third loops the parameters are the same than in the coolant loop for 

the thermal sources, where water is also employed.

2.4. Exergy analysis 

 

In order to interpret the changes in the performances of the layouts an exergy analysis has been carried 

out. The analysis has been applied to each energy loop: cooling of the reactor, power cycle and heat 

releasing to the sink. According to the type of fluid the entropic average temperature (Eq. 1) has been 

assessed in different ways.

3. RESULTS 

3.1 Layouts analysis 

Table 4 gives the source heat exchanger pinch points. It is seen that the lithium-lead heat exchanger, 
with the maximum thermal power at the highest temperature, achieves its best matching (lowest pinch 
points) in C and D layouts, being the worst in B ones. The opposite situation occurs with the helium heat 
exchanger, because to match it well it is necessary to put it in parallel with the lithium-lead heat 
exchanger, so limiting the CO2 inlet temperature to the lithium-lead heat exchanger. Regarding the 
divertor heat exchanger, its matching depends on the helium heat exchanger position. So, to locate the 
divertor heat exchanger upstream of lithium-lead heat exchanger or downstream the turbine produces 
low pinch points if the helium heat exchanger is not in parallel with the lithium-lead one (C and D 
layouts). Finally, high pinch points are always achieved at the vacuum vessel heat exchanger due to its 
low temperature forces its location, not well integrated into the power cycle.

Table 5 shows the turbine inlet temperature and turbomachines power. It is observed that the B layout 
always produces the low temperature. Regarding the power, although the compressor consumption is the 
lowest at BB case, the turbine power is also the lowest. These low values are due to the lower mass flow 
rate in this case because of the lower heat supplied.

Table 6 gives the generated power as well as the electric efficiency. The electric power is also depicted 

in Figure 6 where it is observed a relevant improvement when divertor is also supplying heat to the 

power cycle, although the additional inclusion of vacuum vessel is nearly negligible. In fact, the best 

result without divertor (B-BB) is worse than the worst one with divertor (B-BB-DIV and B-BB-DIV-

VV). 

Regarding layouts BB-DIV and BB-DIV-VV, option B produces between 30 and 40 MW less than other 

arrangements, achieving C and D the best results (differences around 1 %), followed by A (around 2 % 

lower than D). So, from the point of view of produced power it is recommended the scheme BB-DIV, 

being necessary to assess additional aspects (as control issues and behaviour at pulsed mode operation) 

to decide between options A, C or D. BB-DIV-VV layouts have been discarded due to the low 

difference in performances and to the seeking of the size minimization of the heat exchangers (in BB-

DIV the vacuum vessel heat exchanger releases the heat to the sink so it works with a higher pinch point 

and therefore with lower size).

Another selection criterion is the complexity in the associated control system. Although a dynamic study 

is required to assess the controllability of each layout, some ideas on the relative difficulty of controlling 

layouts A, C and D can be anticipated if the control objective is to achieve a pre-defined CO2 

temperature at the outlet of the three source heat exchangers. Compared with A, layouts C and D offer 

the possibility of controlling the flow through AC and HX-He by one single valve. The fact that HX-

DIV and HX-LL are connected in series upstream of the turbine in layouts A and D makes it possible to 

control their flow rate by means of a single valve. In layout C, the control of the flow rate through HX-

DIV will need an additional valve and this seems to interfere more with the performance of the rest of 

the plant than in layouts A and D. Nevertheless, the control system will have other additional objectives 

(e.g. it can be required to control the lithium-lead and helium temperatures at the outlet of the heat 

exchangers, before the fluid returns to the breeding blanket and the divertor); this fact makes too 

difficult to assess the relative controllability without a detailed analysis. 

 

Finally, another criterion to select the proposed layout is the operation under pulsed mode condition. So, 

the work of reactor in DEMO will be intermittent, releasing heat from the plasma during 2 hours, 

followed by a shutdown of 0.5 hour [3]. This operation mode will require the integration of a thermal 

energy storage system which can replace the heat supply when plasma is shutdown. Taking into account 

this fact the most suitable layouts will be the A ones, in which all the thermal sources can be located in a 

source island connected to the power cycle between the high temperature recuperator and the turbine.

3.2. Exergy analysis 

Figures 7, 8 and 9 show the results of an exergy analysis to better understand the behaviour of each 

layout. The low level of integration in layouts BB produces a lower destruction of exergy inside the 

cycle regards BB-DIV and BB-DIV-VV; however, the release of the heat from the divertor to the sink 

entails to a higher exergy destruction in BB cases than in the rest. Focusing on BB-DIV cases (the 

analysis is similar to BB-DIV-VV), layout B is characterized by a high exergy destruction in lithium-

lead thermal source (around 35 MW higher than in the rest of cases); however, exergy destruction on 

helium source is the lowest in case B, comparable to case A, and around 20 MW less than in  C and D. 

The former fact is due to the position of the helium source: in parallel with lithium-lead in cases A and B 

and downstream the auxiliary compressor in cases C and D. 

 

So, the position of the thermal source in the power cycle determines the electric power achieved, being 

determinant the low temperature of the helium source. So, in case A it is necessary to limit the turbine 

inlet temperature to 399 C; however, the position of divertor upstream the lithium-lead source controls 

the destroyed exergy on the latter. In fact, if divertor is moved downstream the turbine and the helium 

source is maintained at the same position (case B) the destruction of exergy on lithium-lead achieves the 

maximum value, being necessary to reduce the turbine inlet temperature to 380 C. Finally, when the 

helium source is situated downstream the auxiliary compressor (cases C and D) the turbine inlet 

temperature can be increased (more than 410 C), reducing the exergy destruction at the lithium-lead 

source to similar values than in case A. In addition,  the destroyed exergy at the helium source is 

increased, but achieving values 15 MW lower than the destroyed exergy at the lead-lithium in case B. 

 

Another noticeable issue is the lower reduction of exergy destruction inside the cycle in cases C and D 

regards A and B. This fact is due to the suppression of HTR in C and D layouts by the new connections 

downstream the auxiliary compressor.

3.3 Proposed layout 

Taking into account the previous considerations about control and integration of the thermal energy 
system, as well as the little improvement achieved when supplying the heat to the power cycle, the 
proposed configuration is the case BB-DIV with layout A. This option hardly losses 1.7 % of electric 
power with respect to the best case (layout D in case BB-DIV-VV), but integrates all the thermal sources 
in a single island, being easy to shift between the thermal energy system and the actual sources. Figure 9 
sketches the layout, Table 7 gives the state points and Figure 10 plots the T-s diagram. The turbine mass 
flow rate is 9,750 kg/s, 6,879 kg/s in the main compressor, and 2,871 kg/s in the auxiliary. Regarding to 
the sink heat exchangers, the heat released at the precooler is 1,248 MW and the pumping consumption 
in the loop crossing the cooling tower is 30.7 MW. In the recovering system 2,502 MW are exchanged, 
belonging 85.7 % to the LTR, with a pinch point of 4.2 ºC and the rest to the HTR, with a pinch point of 
25 ºC.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

This paper presents an exploratory study about alternative power conversion systems for a DEMO 

fusion reactor based on DCLL blanket under the framework of the EUROfusion Program 2014-2018. 

The power conversion system analysed has been the re-compression supercritical CO2 Brayton power 

cycle. Such cycle has received clear support for advanced fission power plants, especially in Sodium 

Fast Reactors, and for concentrated solar power plants. This strong support has been revealed in plenty 

of literature and has entailed to the development of several experimental facilities along the world. Some 

authors have proposed this power cycle as an alternative to steam Rankine cycle for future fusion 

reactors.   

 

The main analysed issue has been the integration of the four thermal sources (two from the blanket, one 

for the divertor and one from the vacuum vessel), with different amounts of heat and temperature range. 

The first step has been to define the source loop, to remove the heat from the reactor, and the sink loop 

to release the heat from the thermodynamic cycle, and eventually the heat released directly to the sink 

from some sources. Pumping consumptions in both loops have been taken into account in the assessment 

of the electricity production. Once the overall chain of power from the reactor to the sink has been 

defined, a total of 10 scenarios have been analysed, considering the supplying of heat from the reactor to 

the power cycle in three cases (blanket, blanket plus divertor, and blanket plus divertor plus vacuum 

vessel). Up to four layouts have been analysed in each case, depending on the location of the thermal 

sources. The assessment of each scenario has taken into account the maximization of electricity 

production as well as issues of control and thermal energy storage systems integration. Finally, an 

exergy analysis has been carried out in order to understand the behaviour of the different scenarios. 

 

The main amount of thermal power comes from the blanket, so this source has always been included. 

The contribution from the divertor to the electric power generation has resulted very relevant, achieving 

increases up to 12.9 % in the electricity production. However, the inclusion of the vacuum vessel, with 

low thermal power and low temperature level, has a small effect in the improvement of the electricity 

generation; increasing the complexity of the layout, control system and storage integration. Regarding 

the location of thermal sources in the power cycle, the position of the heat exchanger taking the heat 

from the zone of the blanket cooled by helium has revealed as decisive, achieving the highest electricity 

production when it is situated downstream the auxiliary compressor in all the considered positions for 

the divertor. In spite of these considerations, the maximum increase between the four considered 

scenarios when the heat from the blanket and the divertor is supplied to the power cycle is around 6 %, 

being lower than 2 % if the worst scenario is neglected.      

 

The destroyed exergy is well explained by the heat exchangers integration due to the low pressure drops 

considered, except in the sink loop. So, the exergy analysis carried out at source loops entails to similar 



 - 27 - 

conclusions than the study of the pinch points of the source heat exchangers. So, the heat release to the 

sink from the divertor destroys a lot of exergy, being decisive the location of the helium cooled blanket 

heat exchanger. It is also observed as the simplicity in the layout (suppression of some devices) allows 

reducing the exergy destruction inside the thermodynamic cycle. 

 

Results obtained clearly entail to select the BB-DIV case (heat from the vacuum vessel released directly 

to the sink). Among the four layouts considered, B (helium heat exchanger in parallel with the lithium-

lead one and divertor heat exchanger downstream the turbine) is clearly the worst, but there is less than 2 

% of variation in the electricity production among the other three layouts. Control considerations suggest 

D as the optimal one, with also a good behaviour in the A layout. Taking into account the integration of 

energy storage in order to face the pulsed mode operation the A layout prevails among the others due to 

all the thermal sources are joined in an island. So, as the electricity production from A layout is hardly 2 

% lower than in D, the former is proposed as the energy conversion system of the DEMO reactor 

analysed based on DCLL blanket, achieving an electric power of 707.7 MW and an electric efficiency of 

34.6%. Dynamic analysis should be performed in order to assess the actual controllability.
