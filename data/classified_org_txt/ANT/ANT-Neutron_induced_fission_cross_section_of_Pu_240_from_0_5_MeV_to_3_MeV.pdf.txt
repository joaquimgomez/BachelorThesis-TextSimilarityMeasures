240Pu has recently been pointed out by a sensitivity study of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) to be one of the isotopes whose fission cross section
lacks accuracy to meet the upcoming needs for the future generation of nuclear power plants (GEN-IV). In
the High Priority Request List (HPRL) of the OECD, it is suggested that the knowledge of the 240Pu(n,f )
cross section should be improved to an accuracy within 1–3 %, compared to the present 5%. A measurement
of the 240Pu cross section has been performed at the Van de Graaff accelerator of the Joint Research Center
(JRC) Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) using quasi-monoenergetic neutrons in the
energy range from 0.5 MeV to 3 MeV. A twin Frisch-grid ionization chamber (TFGIC) has been used in a
back-to-back configuration as fission fragment detector. The 240Pu(n,f ) cross section has been normalized to
three different isotopes: 237Np(n,f ), 235U(n,f ), and 238U(n,f ). Additionally, the secondary standard reactions
were benchmarked through measurements against the primary standard reaction 235U(n,f ) in the same geometry.
A comprehensive study of the corrections applied to the data and the associated uncertainties is given. The results
obtained are in agreement with previous experimental data at the threshold region. For neutron energies higher
than 1 MeV, the results of this experiment are slightly lower than the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation, but in agreement
with the experiments of Laptev et al. (2004) as well as Staples and Morley (1998).

I. INTRODUCTION

Some of the designs under study for the new generation of
nuclear power plants (GEN-IV) are developed to work using a
fast-neutron energy spectrum. Nuclear data in this region are
scarce and, most of the time, their spread is large. Additionally,
most data sets available date from the 1970s. To group all
the specific needs for the most viable GEN-IV nuclear power
plant designs, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) issued
in 2008 a sensitivity study [1]. Within this extended study, a
list of nuclear data parameters of interest for fast reactors was
published. In that list, not only improved accuracy of several
cross sections of actinides were requested, but also some
important nuclear parameters of structural materials present in
such reactors. Specifically, the neutron-induced fission cross
section of 240Pu was listed to be improved to an accuracy
within 1–3 %, compared to the present 5%.

The Accurate Nuclear Data and Energy Sustainability
(ANDES) Collaboration [2] had the objective to address
some of the data needs for the design of fast reactors. This
project was enrolled in the collaboration to determine with
an unprecedented accuracy the neutron-induced fission cross
section of 240,242Pu. In this paper, the results of the 240Pu(n,f )
cross section measurements are being presented, while the
results for the 242Pu(n,f ) cross section will be provided in a
forthcoming publication.

Several data sets are available in the Experimental Nuclear
Reaction Data Library (EXFOR) [3]. In Fig. 1 the most
relevant experiments in the energy range of this measurement
are plotted together with the most recent evaluations (for
clearness not all data points are shown). The fission threshold
of 240Pu(n,f ) is well determined. In the case of the plateau
region there is a discrepancy of 7% between the newest data of
Tovesson et al. (2009) [4] and the rest of the data sets [5–10].
In the same way, the JEFF 3.1 evaluation [11], obtained prior
to Tovesson’s experiment via a trial and error procedure of
two codes, is 5% higher than the ENDF/B-VII.1 [12], mainly
obtained by relying on the data set of Staples and Morley
(1998) [9]. The JENDL 4.0 [13] evaluation is obtained after
performing a simultaneous fit of any subset of data later than
1960 of 233,235,238U(n,f ) and 239,240,241Pu(n,f ). Additionally,
any of the experiments presented have reached an uncertainty
below 3%, taking into account that, in many cases, the
uncertainty of the reference cross section is not considered.

In order to minimize uncertainties and bring additional
information compared to that already available in the literature,

FIG. 1. (Color online) Summary of the most relevant experi-
ments performed of the neutron-induced fission cross section of
240Pu compared with current evaluations. The evaluations chosen
are ENDF/B-VII.1 [12], JEFF 3.1 [11] and JENDL 4.0 [13]. The
experimental data shown are Ruddick and White (1964) [5] (open
diamonds), White (1967) [6] (open crosses), Meadows (1981) [7]
(open triangle up), Budtz-Jørgensen and Knitter (1981) [8] (open

as a ratio of 235U were normalized to the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation
of this isotope. Further explanation is given in the text.

the experiment presented here used as reference cross sections
237Np(n,f ), 238U(n,f ), and 235U(n,f ). The cross section
of 235U(n,f ) is considered a primary standard, the one of
238U(n,f ) a secondary standard from 2 MeV onwards, and
the one of 237Np(n,f ) is not considered a standard. For this
reason, the 237Np(n,f ) and 238U(n,f ) cross sections were
measured relative to the 235U(n,f ) cross section. Furthermore,
the use of modern digital electronics was a key point to the
complete understanding of the experimental data when using
high α-active targets such as 240Pu.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. The Van de Graaff accelerator (JRC-IRMM)

The Van de Graaff accelerator (VdG) of the JRC-IRMM
was used to produce neutrons. At the VdG protons, deuterons
or α particles are accelerated through a potential difference to
impinge onto a neutron producing target. Different reactions
are used to generate quasi-monoenergetic neutrons. In the
particular case of this experiment, protons were accelerated
to produce neutrons using the reactions 7Li(p,n)7Be (0.5 �
En � 1.8 MeV) and T(p,n)3He (1.6 � En � 3.0 MeV). The
neutron producing targets are placed at the end of the beam
line and, in order to keep their temperature below a certain
level, they are cooled using a flow system of water with a layer
thickness of 1–3 mm. The effect of the water cooling system
on the neutron energy has been studied in detail by means of
Monte Carlo simulations and will be discussed below.

FIG. 2. (Color online) Scheme of the twin Frisch-grid ionization
chamber with two samples in a back-to-back configuration followed
by the digital electronics used for this experiment.

B. Fission fragment detector

A twin Frisch-grid ionization chamber (TFGIC) was used as
fission fragment (FF) detector. This detector has been proven
to provide outstanding results in FF characterization in many
experiments, thanks to its characteristics: almost 4π solid
angle, radiation resistance, and high energy resolution. The
type of TFGIC used in this work is described in Refs. [14,15].
In the case of this experiment the TFGIC was filled in a
first stage with P10 (90% Ar + 10% CH4) and later, with
CH4. The main reason for using CH4 as counting gas was
to increase the electron drift mobility to be able to correct
for several αparticles piling up on the recorded signal. An
extended description of signals using one or the other gas
was already published elsewhere [16]. The gas flow was
about 50 ml/min (100 ml/min) when using P10 (CH4). A
high voltage was applied to each electrode through charge
sensitive preamplifiers. The anodes had a positive voltage of
1 kV (1.5 kV), the grids were grounded, and the cathode had a
negative voltage of −1.5 kV (−2.5 kV) when using P10 (CH4).

Figure 2 presents a sketch of the TFGIC together with the
associated electronics scheme. The cathode-grid distance was
chosen in order to fully stop the FFs before reaching the grid.
For cross section experiments a common choice is to place in
the cathode holder two samples, the sample under study and
the reference sample, in a back-to-back geometry; in this way,
a measurement of the neutron flux in the exact same place
where the samples are may be avoided.

C. Data acquisition (DAQ)

The charge sensitive preamplifiers were fed into a 12 bit,
100 MHz waveform digitizer (WFD). The WFD was triggered
using a logical signal obtained from the cathode preamplifier
after passing through a timing filter amplifier (TFA) and a
constant fraction discriminator (CFD). An electronic threshold
was set on the CFD to avoid α particles from the 240Pu sample
triggering the system. The signals were stored after the WFD in
a computer for offline analysis using a data acquisition system
(DAQ) developed at JRC-IRMM. The DAQ was built in C++
using ROOT as framework [17,18].

D. Signal processing (DSP)

Offline, the signals were analyzed using a digital signal
processing code (DSP) developed at JRC-IRMM. The signals

were treated with, basically, a baseline correction and a
CR-RC4 filter [15]. During this process the αparticles, piled up
in the baseline prior and after the FF event, were subtracted.
The amplitude of each signal was correlated with the pulse
height (PH). The PH distributions were corrected for the grid
inefficiency.

E. Sample description

Several samples were used within this experiment; all
of them were made by the target preparation group of
JRC-IRMM. An extended description is given in Table I. The
mass of the 240Pu sample was chosen to minimize its α activity
without compromising the measuring time in the experiment.
Nevertheless, its 0.8 MBq of activity allowed signals of up to 7
α particles piling up together, that needed to be discriminated
from low-energy FF signals. Ideally, to avoid solid angle
corrections, the diameter of all the samples should be the same.
Unfortunately, the only 237Np sample available had a spot size
half of the one of the other samples. This made the 237Np
sample much thicker than the rest. The purity of all the samples
used was higher than 99.5%, and the content of fissile isotope
contaminants was smaller than 0.2%. The mass of all samples
was measured by means of low geometry α counting. The
uncertainty reached was below 1% for all samples, except for
the 235U. In that case, the 2% uncertainty is due to its complex
α decay scheme. Additionally, the 238U and the 235U sample
masses were remeasured using a single Frisch-grid ionization
chamber. The results obtained were within the uncertainties of
those obtained by the previous method.

F. Homogeneity study

Two methods of sample production were employed:
molecular plating (for 240Pu) and vacuum deposition (for
237Np, 235U, and 238U). To study the homogeneity of the
samples a qualitative and a quantitative technique were used.
Initially, fluorescence images were taken of the 240Pu and
the 237Np samples [22]. In the case of the 240Pu a higher α
activity was found in the outer layer; in contrast, the 237Np
sample presented a uniform distribution of the αactivity on its

surface. To quantify the mass increase seen in the outer layer
of the 240Pu sample, a low solid-angle α-particle counting
measurement was done. A mask with a 6 mm diameter was
used to perform a measurement in the center of the mass and
then several measurements in the outer layer. The increase of
mass in the outer layer with respect to the center of the sample
was of 11.4%.

G. Shielding

The experimental setup was updated with a large
paraffin-B4C shield when the

235U sample was used as
reference. The function of the shielding was to slow down
(via the paraffin) the neutrons that were not interacting with
the samples inside the TFGIC. Once those neutrons were in the
target hall, if they were returning to the TFGIC, after scattering
they would cross the paraffin again and then be captured in the
B4C wall. Because of the large neutron capture cross section
of 10B, the probability that those thermalized neutrons reach
the fissile 235U will be minimized. Figure 3 shows the setup
without (setup #1) and with (setup #2) shielding.

III. CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT

Several measurements using a LiF neutron produc-
ing target and a TiT target to determine the following
cross section ratios were performed: 240Pu(n,f )/237Np(n,f ),
240Pu(n,f )/238U(n,f ), and 240Pu(n,f )/235U(n,f ). Addition-
ally, an effort was put into determining the cross sec-
tion of 237Np(n,f ) and the cross section of the secondary
standard 238U(n,f ). To achieve these goals, the follow-
ing ratios were measured too: 237Np(n,f )/235U(n,f ) and
238U(n,f )/235U(n,f ).

respectively.

Hereafter an extended explanation of the applied correc-
tions will be given (A), followed by a discussion on the
sources of uncertainty (B), before the final cross section data
is discussed (C).

A. Corrections

1. Electronic threshold

There are two experimental conditions that cause an
incomplete PH distribution. One is the electronic threshold
level applied to discard as many αparticles as possible. The
other is the thickness of the used sample: in a thicker sample
FFs will loose more energy before entering into the counting
gas, thus the PH distribution will be biased towards the low
energy region. An example of both effects can be seen in Fig. 4.
To correct for these effects a constant PH distribution towards
zero PH is assumed. Thus, a linear extrapolation is done in this
region. This correction was usually between 3% and 5% of the
total detected counts. Nevertheless, when using the thickest
sample (237Np) together with the most active sample (240Pu),
the correction to be applied to the 237Np sample was as large
as 13.6%.

2. Spontaneous fission half-life

The spontaneous fission rate of the 240Pu sample was about
0.05 fissions/s. An extended study was performed earlier to
determine the spontaneous fission half-life of this isotope, i.e.,
T1/2,SF = 1.165 × 1011 yr (1.1%) [16]. This correction was
important in the whole neutron energy range covered, since
the fission rate for any single energy was never higher than
2–3 fissions/s. Around the fission threshold the correction
exceeded 5%.

3. Self-absorption and efficiency

The efficiency of a TFGIC used in a back-to-back
configuration is nearly 2 × 2π ; if a FF enters the counting
gas, it will always ionize the counting gas producing a signal
on the electrodes. Therefore, the detection efficiency will
be mainly deteriorated by the self-absorption of FFs inside
the sample. In the case of (n,f ) reactions two other factors
need to be included: the momentum transfer from the neutron
to the fissioning nucleus and the anisotropic FF emissions;
both of them depending on the incoming neutron energy. The
equations used to calculate the efficiency were derived from

the 237Np sample. Additionally, a degradation of the PH distribution
is evident for the more active sample 240Pu, even though it is the
thinnest one.

accounts for the momentum transfer from the neutron to
the fissioning nucleus. The anisotropy (a2) was calculated
experimentally from the cosine distributions obtained.

This correction is not higher than 2% in most of the cases.
For the same isotope, it is always higher when the foil is placed
downstream and for the highest neutron energy. When using
the thickest sample (237Np), the correction goes up to 5% at a
neutron energy of 3 MeV.

4. Neutron spectrum, sample inhomogeneity, and solid angle

Depending on the thickness of the neutron producing
target, the energy width of the neutrons will vary. Since
the proton-induced cross section does not take a constant
value, this effect needs to be accounted for in the final cross
section calculation by folding the reference cross section with
the neutron energy distribution. In addition, the emission of
neutrons at the producing target is not fully isotropic. The
samples used in the experiment have different spot sizes and
some are not homogeneous, thus the shape of the emitted
flux, as a function of the solid angle, is used to correct for
these differences. The differential cross section as a function
of neutron emission angle for each reaction, 7Li(p,n)7Be and
T(p,n)3He, was obtained from Refs. [25,26].

The influence of both effects is smaller than 0.05% when
the two samples have the same spot size, goes up to 1.3%
when their sizes are different and one of the samples is
not homogeneous, and up to 2.5% when both samples are
homogeneous having different diameter.

5. Excited state of the 7Li( p,n)7Be reaction

The reaction to the first excited state of the 7Li(p,n)7Be
starts at En ≈ 0.7 MeV and has around 0.4 MeV lower energy
than the reaction to the nuclear ground state. The differential

cross section into the first excited state is, at least, one order
of magnitude lower than into the ground state [25] and its
corresponding correction is smaller than 1%.

6. Background neutrons.

A nondesirable neutron background was generated through
inelastic scattering on the material in between the neutron
producing target and the sample deposits as well as by
neutrons returning from the walls (room return). Two setup
configurations were used during the experiments. The first
one (setup #1) consisted mainly of a neutron producing
target cooled by 2 mm of water and, at 7 cm distance, the
samples were placed at the center of the TFGIC. The second
configuration (setup #2) consisted of a water layer of 1 mm
and, additionally, the TFGIC and part of the beam line were
shielded by a paraffin-B4C wall (see Fig. 3).

To evaluate the neutron moderation on the different
materials between the neutron source and the samples as
well as the room-return effect, MCNP [23] simulations were
performed for the two different configurations (see Fig. 5).
The neutron energy distribution, its emission angle, and
emission probability entered the simulations according to the
information given in Refs. [25,26]. The result given by the
simulation was the flux as a function of the neutron energy
impinging on the sample deposits, i.e., at the center of the
TFGIC, folded with the neutron-induced fission cross section
of the isotope of interest:

∑
i �(Ei)σ (Ei). Because the goal

was to determine the (n,f ) cross section at a single neutron
energy, the flux at the neutron energy of interest folded with
the (n,f ) cross section of the sample isotope, �(En)σ (En),
was considered too. The ratio of these two quantities gives
the correction factor to be applied at each neutron energy for
each isotope. For all isotopes the σ (Ei) considered was the
one available in MCNP. This correction factor accounts for the
number of fission events detected in the TFGIC that were not
induced by neutrons of the energy of interest. The results for
setup #1 are presented in Fig. 6 for (a) a LiF neutron producing
target and (b) a TiT neutron producing target.

FIG. 5. Geometry used in the simulations with the MCNP code. Left: setup #1; right: setup #2. Besides the shielding, the main difference
between the two setups is the thickness of the water layer (2 mm for setup #1; 1 mm for setup #2).

It has been observed with the results of the simulations
that the influence on the neutron spectrum of the room return
due to the paraffin-B4C is nearly negligible (below <0.6%)
(see Fig. 7). Consequently, the neutron thermalization taking
place in the water layer becomes the major contribution to
the degradation of the neutron spectrum. This degradation
of the neutron spectrum will produce, for instance, a higher
fission count rate on the 235U side, due to the increase on
the 235U(n,f ) cross section with decreasing neutron energy,
leading to calculating a reduced cross section of the isotope of
interest. In the case of samples with a fission threshold, when
measuring at neutron energies close to the fission threshold
the ratio is close to 1 if the (n,f ) cross section of the isotope
becomes 0 at around 200–300 keV lower energy than the one to

be measured. At the plateau region of the (n,f ) cross section
(1.2 – 1.8 MeV for 237Np and 240Pu) the correction factors
do not reach 1 because the neutron energy spectra cover a
region down to the fission threshold. In the neutron energy
region where the TiT is employed, the strongest corrections
are applied when the 235U sample is used, because its cross
section in this region does not show a flat behavior. For the
samples with a fission threshold below En = 1.5 MeV (237Np
and 240Pu), the behavior is constant in the entire region.
Finally, when using the 238U sample (fission threshold at
En = 1.6 MeV), the correction increases when approaching
the plateau region of its (n,f ) cross section. Additionally, these
correction factors cancel out when the two samples employed
have a similar (n,f ) cross section shape.

(a) 0.8 MeV LiF and 1.5 MeV LiF and (b) 1.8 MeV TiT and 2.2 MeV TiT. Labels are s1 (setup #1), s1 nW (setup #1 without water layer),

(setup #2 without shielding and water layer), and s2 nSH nW nIC (setup #2 without shielding, water layer, and ionization chamber structure).
For a better visualization the 240Pu correction factors are not shown since its cross section is very similar to the one of 237Np. In the case of LiF
only the correction factors of 235U and 237Np are presented, since no measurements were performed with 238U. Noticeably, for the two setups,
the biggest influence comes from the water layer (2 mm for setup #1 and 1 mm for setup #2); on the other hand, the shielding structure of setup
#2 has a negligible influence on the neutron background. Additionally, it is clear that isotopes with a fission threshold at higher energies are
less affected by the neutron background than fissile isotopes.

B. Sources of uncertainty

A detailed study of the uncertainties related to each correc-
tion and value used has been done. As previously described,
all samples used for this experiment were remeasured in order
to lower the uncertainty associated with their mass. The other
factor that contributes to an increase of the uncertainty is the
efficiency. As discussed in Ref. [16], the related uncertainty
on the efficiency for samples with very high α activity, such
as the one of 240Pu, could not be predicted better than 1%.
Table II lists all the uncertainties related to this experiment.

In the case of achieving absolute cross section values, the
total uncertainty for each measurement is smaller than 3%
in cases where the reference cross section was 235U(n,f )
or 238U(n,f ). In the case of the normalization with the
237Np(n,f ) cross section the total uncertainty is close to 5%,
because the reference sample is not a standard. The statistical
uncertainty is, in most of the individual data sets, around 0.5%,
except for a single case where it amounts to 1.4%.

C. Results

Measuring the 240Pu(n,f ) cross section relative to a
secondary standard [i.e., 238U(n,f )] or even not a standard
[i.e., 237Np(n,f )] resulted in deeper knowledge of these two
cross sections. Because of that, those two isotopes were studied
in terms of their neutron-induced fission cross section relative
to 235U(n,f ). First of all, the 237Np(n,f ) cross section was
benchmarked using the 235U(n,f ) cross section and the results
obtained were in agreement within 2% with the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluation in the range of interest (En = [0.5,1.8] MeV, and
using the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction). The results obtained using the
238U(n,f ) cross section as reference need to be normalized by
the 238U(n,f )/235U(n,f ) ratio due to a misbehavior of the
238U sample. Therefore, a normalization needed to be applied
when the measured ratio was 240Pu(n,f )/238U(n,f ):

240Pu using as reference 237Np(n,f ) (blue triangles), 235U(n,f ) (green
stars), and 238U(n,f ) (red dots). The agreement of the three data sets
is striking, especially at 1.6 and 1.8 MeV incoming neutron energy.
Yet, the ratio plot shows a deviation of 3–7 % in the neutron energy
range from 0.7 MeV up to 2.5 MeV compared with the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluation.

where the index “exp” corresponds to experimental data
and the index “ENDF” to the value of the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluation.

The results obtained for each of the three measured ratios
are compared in Fig. 8, where all the data is normalized to
the respective ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluations, except for the ratio
to 238U(n,f ) where the normalization of Eq. (4) is applied.
When using the 7Li(p,n)7Be neutron producing target, i.e.,
below 1.8 MeV, the values obtained with the 237Np(n,f )
normalization (blue triangles) are in perfect agreement with the
ones obtained using the 235U(n,f ) (green stars). Additionally,
at the fission threshold the results resemble the current evalu-
ations, especially the JEFF 3.1. From 1 MeV up to 1.8 MeV,
this experiment is up to 7% lower than the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluation, as can be seen from the ratio plot in the lower part
of Fig. 8. Above 1.6–1.8 MeV, when the T(p,n)3He reaction
is used, the data presented as normalized to the 238U(n,f )
cross section (red dots) were in addition renormalized using
Eq. (4). An outstanding agreement is obtained at 1.6 MeV and
1.8 MeV with the other two normalizations. Further, the fission
cross section shape is very well maintained, yet with 3–5 %
lower values for incoming neutron energies up to 2.5 MeV.
For energies above 2.5 MeV, the cross section is increasing
compared with the prediction by any of the three evaluations.
The reason for this effect is that the normalization ratio
238U(n,f )/235U(n,f ) was just measured up to 2.8 MeV. Thus,
the extrapolated ratio at 3.0 MeV obtained for normalization
purposes might be overestimated.

A weighted average was calculated for all subsets of
data; the results are shown in Fig. 9 together with previous
experimental values and the most recent evaluations. The
neutron energy window chosen for each weighted data point
was the wider window from the individual data points to

individual data points used to calculate the weighted average.

An agreement is seen at the threshold region, in particular
with the JEFF 3.1 evaluation. At the plateau region, this
experiment confirms the lower set of values available in

EXFOR, i.e., those from Laptev et al. (2004) [10] and Staples
and Morley (1998) [9].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The neutron-induced fission cross section of 240Pu has
been measured in the neutron energy range from 0.5 MeV
up to 3 MeV, following the high-priority request from the
OECD-NEA. The neutrons were produced via two proton-
induced reactions, namely 7Li(p,n)7Be and T(p,n)3He, at the
Van de Graaff accelerator at JRC-IRMM. A twin Frisch-grid
ionization chamber was used as fission fragment detector.
Three reference samples were used in the experimental
campaigns: 237Np(n,f ), 238U(n,f ), and 235U(n,f ). Addition-
ally, the 238U(n,f ) and the 237Np(n,f ) cross sections were
benchmarked using 235U(n,f ). The 240Pu(n,f ) cross section
obtained with any of the reference samples at 1.6–1.8 MeV is
in agreement within uncertainties. At the fission threshold, the
240Pu(n,f ) cross section is in agreement not only with previous
experimental data but also with the JEFF 3.1 evaluation. Above
1 MeV, the data extracted when doing a weighted average of all
subsets of data are around 3–5 % lower than the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluation, but in very good agreement with the recent data
sets from Laptev et al. (2004) [10] and Staples and Morley
(1998) [9].

The main uncertainty contribution was coming from the
mass of the samples, yet an effort was done to re-measure this
quantity for all the samples used. Additionally, the efficiency
was considered to have an uncertainty of 1%. Finally, when
doing the normalization, the highest uncertainty contribution
came from the 237Np(n,f ) cross section, which currently is
not known to better than 2.2–4 %.
