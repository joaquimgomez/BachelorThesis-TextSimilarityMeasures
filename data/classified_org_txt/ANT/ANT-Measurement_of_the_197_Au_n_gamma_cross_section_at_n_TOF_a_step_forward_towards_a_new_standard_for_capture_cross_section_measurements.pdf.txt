The accurate knowledge of the 197Au(n,γ) reaction cross section is of great importance, since this
reaction if often used as a reference in capture cross section measurements relevant to Nuclear

Astrophysics, as well as for neutron flux determination in nuclear power reactors. With the aim

of improving the accuracy of the neutron capture cross section on 197Au, extensive measurements

were performed at the n_TOF facility at CERN with two detection systems: a total absorption

calorimeter and a set of C6D6 detectors. The capture yield and the resonance parameters have

been determined in the energy range from 1 eV to 5 keV and compared with evaluated data

files. The present capture kernels are on average in good agreement with tabulated data, although

sizable differences are observed for several resonances. A few new resonances are also reported.

Au(n,γ) - the making of a new standard Cristian Massimi

1. Introduction

The main objectives of the experimental activity of the neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF
at CERN are accurate measurements of neutron induced cross sections relevant to nuclear astro-
physics [1, 2] and emerging nuclear technologies [3, 4].

Neutron capture cross sections are usually derived relative to a standard (or well known) cross
section, for example via the 197Au(n,γ) cross section at thermal energy and in the energy range
above 200 keV. Furthermore the first resonance for n+197Au at 4.9 eV is often used to normalize
capture yield measurements. In fact, because of its favorable Γγ /Γn ratio, the value of the capture
yield is independent of the resonance parameters when this resonance is saturated.

Accuracte measurements of the (n,γ) cross section of 197Au have been performed at the n_TOF
facility with the aim of extending the energy range of this standard using two different detection
systems, a set of two C6D6 detectors with extremely low neutron sensitivity and a total absorption
calorimeter based on BaF2 scintillator crystals.

In spite of its importance, only few measurements of the 197Au(n,γ) cross section have been
performed in the resonance region so far. Evaluations are available only in the ENDF/B-VI and
ENDF/B-VII libraries, showing 5% discrepancies in the capture kernels.

2. Experiments

At the n_TOF facility [5] [6] neutrons are produced by spallation reactions induced by 20
GeV/c protons from the CERN Proton Synchtotron (PS) in a massive lead target. The high intensity
of 7×1012 protons/pulse results in a very high instantaneous neutron flux in the energy region: 1
eV - 250 MeV. A 5.8 cm thick water layer around the lead spallation target serves as a coolant and
as a moderator, yielding a wide energy spectrum from thermal to 250 MeV. An evacuated neutron
flight path leads to the experimental area at a distance of 185 m from the target. The neutron beam
is shaped by means of two collimators at 137 and 175 m, which consist of layers of iron and borated
polyethylene. Charged particles are removed from the neutron beam by a sweeping magnet located
at a distance of 145 m from the target.

The neutron energy is determined by time of flight (TOF). The nominal repetition rate of the
pulsed beam is 2.4 seconds, low enough to cover the TOF range down to subthermal energies and
to prevent overlapping of slow neutrons from subsequent cycles.

2.1 Capture setup

Neutron capture events are characterized by the emission of γ-rays associated with the deex-
citation of the product nucleus to the ground state. In the n_TOF measurements, the total energy
detection system[8] with two C6D6 liquid scintillation detectors as well as a the total γ-ray absorp-
tion calorimeter (TAC) have been used. Since the efficiency of the C6D6 scintillators are too small
to measure the full capture γ-ray cascade, it requires the use of weighting functions to reconstruct
the neutron capture yield [7, 8]. The weighting technique, which is only valid for detectors with
low efficiency, is indeed well suited for the C6D6 setup because the detection probability for 1 MeV
γ-rays is only about 3%.

Au(n,γ) - the making of a new standard Cristian Massimi

The n_TOF TAC [9, 10, 11] is a 4π detector with nearly 100% detection efficiency for capture
γ-ray cascades and an energy resolution of 15% at 662 keV and of 6% at 6.1 MeV. It consists of
40 BaF2 crystals contained in

10B loaded carbon fibre capsules forming a spherical shell 15 cm in
thickness and with an inner diameter of 20 cm. The samples in the center of the TAC are surrounded
by a 5 cm thick C12H20O4(

6Li)2 layer, which moderates and absorbs sample scattered neutrons.
The TAC is ideal for capture measurements on low mass samples of radioactive and fissile

isotopes, because it allows one to select specific reactions via the total energy of the capture γ-ray
cascade and to reject γ-rays originating from other processes. The C6D6 setup is optimized for
cases where the total cross section is dominated by the elastic channel. Thanks to its low neutron
sensitivity (defined as the ratio between the detection efficiency for scattered neutrons and for
capture γ-rays) reliable results can be obtained even for extremely small Γγ /Γn ratios. The neutron
sensitivity of the C6D6 setup is about 10

−4, two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the TAC.

2.2 Capture cross section measurement

The main quantity determined in the measurement is the capture yield, defined as the fraction
of incident neutrons, Φ(En), that is captured in the sample. It can be expressed as Yexp(En) =
Cobs(En)

ε ·
1

Φ(En)
, where Cobs is the number of detected reactions and ε the detection efficiency. The

capture yield is related to the cross section by the areal density n of the sample, by the total neutron
cross section σT , and by the radiative capture cross section σγ : Y = (1− e−nσT )

σγ
σT

.
In the Resolved Resonance Region the capture cross section of 197Au was described in terms

of resonance parameters calculated in the Reich-Moore approximation using the R-matrix code
SAMMY [12]. The resonance parameters obtained in the SAMMY fits are the resonance energy,
ER, and the partial reaction widths, Γγ and Γn. An example of this procedure is given in the left
panel of Fig. 1.

3. Results and Conclusions

The n_TOF measurement allowed to extract accurate data for the 197Au(n,γ) reaction in the
resonance region. In the energy range between 1 eV and 5 keV the parameters of 255 resonances
could be determined by the combined analysis of separate runs with the BaF2 TAC and the C6D6
detectors. The fact that both data sets are fully consistent with each other confirms the very good
performance of the TAC and demonstrates that the 197Au(n,γ) cross section is suited as a standard
in the resolved resonance region. From the resonance parameters capture kernels K = g(J)×Γγ ×
Γn/(Γn +Γγ) have been calculated, where g(J) is the statistical spin factor.

Apart from discrepancies for some resonances, these kernels agree on average to 3-4% with
the ENDF/B-VII evaluation as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 1. In addition, a number of reso-
nances could be clearly resolved, which were previously considered to be "doubtful" and, therefore,
only partly included in the ENDF/B-VI and ENDF/B-VII evaluations. These cases are summarized
in Table 1.
