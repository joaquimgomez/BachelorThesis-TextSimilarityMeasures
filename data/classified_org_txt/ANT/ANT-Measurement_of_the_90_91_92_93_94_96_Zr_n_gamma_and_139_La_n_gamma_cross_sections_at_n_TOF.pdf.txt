Abstract. Neutron capture cross sections of Zr and La isotopes have important implications in the field of nuclear
astrophysics as well as in the nuclear technology. In particular the Zr isotopes play a key role for the determination of
the neutron density in the He burning zone of the Red Giant star, while the 139La is important to monitor the s-process
abundances from Ba up to Pb. Zr is also largely used as structural materials of traditional and advanced nuclear
reactors. The nuclear resonance parameters and the cross section of 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr and 139La have been measured at
the n TOF facility at CERN. Based on these data the capture resonance strength and the Maxwellian-averaged cross
section were calculated.

1 Introduction

The neutron capture cross sections of 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr and
139La has been measured with high resolution at the n TOF
facility at CERN.

The neutron capture measurement of these isotopes has a
particular relevance in the nuclear astrophysics, since the Zr
belongs to the first s-process peak in the solar abundance dis-
tribution at N = 50 while the La belongs to the second s-pro-

cess peak at N = 82. The 90Zr and the 139La are neutron magic
and are characterized, like the 91,92,93,94Zr, by a low neutron
capture cross section and are predominately of s-process
origin. The most neutron reach Zr stable isotope, 96Zr, is
traditionally considered to be an r-only isotope with a small
s-process admixture refs. [1,2]. Its abundance is considered
to be a strong indicator in the efficiency of the 22Ne neutron
source during the He shell burning episodes of thermally
pulsing AGB stars.

The lanthanum acts as bottleneck between the abundant
light n-capture element of the first s-process peak and the

heavy elements from Sm up to Pb and Bi, it is very im-
portant for interpreting the element abundance patterns in
very old, metal poor stars. Since the La abundance is com-
pletely represented by 139La it can be used to distinguish the
s-process components from the products of explosive r-
process nucleosynthesis, the s/r ratio is of utmost importance
for the galatical chemical evolution. The major motivation of
the present measurement was to reduce the uncertainties to
a few percent, as required to improve the stellar s-process
model.

2 Experimental set-up

The measurements were performed at the neutron time-of-
flight (n TOF) facility at CERN in a range of energy between
1 eV and 1 MeV with a pulsed neutron beam. The neutrons
were generated by spallation reactions induced by a pulse
of beam of 20 GeV protons impinging on a massive lead
target. The low repetition rate of the proton beam driver,
the extremely high instantaneous neutron flux, the low back-
ground conditions in the experimental area, together with
improved neutron sensitivity of the γ-ray detectors make this
facility unique for neutron induced reaction cross section
measurements with high accuracy. The main characteristics of
the facility and apparatus are reported in [3].

2.1 Detectors and data acquisition

The measurement is based on the detection of the γ rays emit-
ted in the de-excitation cascade following a neutron capture
event. Two C6D6 detectors with minimized neutron sensitivity
[4], placed perpendicular to the neutron beam at a distance
of about 3 cm from the beam axis, were used to detect the γ
rays. The background due to in-beam γ rays was reduced by
placing the detectors 9.2 cm upstream of the sample position.
The light output of the detectors was calibrated by means of
the 137Cs,60Co and Pu/C γ-ray sources. The calibrated neutron
time of flight was used to determine the neutron energy.
Measured upstream of the capture samples with low mass flux
monitor consisting of a Mylar foil 1.5 µm in thickness with a
layer of 200 µg/cm2 of 6Li surrounded by four silicon detectors
outside the neutron beam, measuring the charged particles of
the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction [14]. The data were acquired with high
frequency flash ADC (FADC) using the standard n TOF data
acquisition system [5]. The raw data were recorded signal by
signal for a detailed off-line analysis, which allows one to
extract the required information on timing, charge, amplitude
and particle identification, allowing in particular an efficient
γ-n discrimination.

2.2 Samples

The characteristic of the samples are summarized in table 1.
The enriched Zr samples were prepared from oxide powder, an
admixture of Hf, Na, Mg, Al, Sn and Mo were also present in
the Zr samples. The influence of those contaminants, although
small (their total contamination was lower than 1%), can
not be neglected. Additional Au reference sample as well

as a natural C and 208Pb sample were used for neutron flux
normalization in the measurements. The Au reference sample
was used because the gold capture cross section is known
with high accuracy, particularly the saturated resonance at
4.9 eV. The C and 208Pb samples were used to determine the
background components related to sample scattered neutrons
and in-beam γ rays.

3 Data analysis

The main steps of the data analysis are: an accurate calibration
of the C6D6 detectors, ambient and sample related back-
grounds determination and subtraction by means of the spectra
measured with an empty Al can, and with a Pb and C sample,
the absolute normalization of the capture yields made with an
accuracy of 3% via the spectrum measured with a Au sample.
The efficiency correction was performed with the Pulse Height
Weighting Technique (PHWT) [6] applied to the C6D6 capture
data in order to achieve a cascade detection independent of
the particular de-excitation path. The respective weighting
functions are sensitive to the experimental set-up, including
the investigated sample. These functions were derived by
detailed Monte Carlo simulations. Figure 1 shows the capture
yield for the 139La sample compared to the total background
and the individual background components.

Finally, systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced
by the improved n TOF set-up, which exhibits much lower
neutron sensitivity by the use of low-mass carbon fibre cans
for the liquid scintillator detectors. In addition, the use of
FADCs provides an efficient way for n/γ-discrimination.

4 Results

Resonances observed were analyzed in terms of R-matrix
parameters in the Reich-Moore approximation with the code
SAMMY [8]. Due to the high energy resolution of the n TOF
facility many new resonances were found. The resonance
parameters measured at n TOF are for all the Zr samples in
general 10–20% smaller than previously reported while for
the La sample are 10% lower than that reported in [9] and a
few percent lower than that reported in [10]. A possible expla-
nation for these systematic differences can be due to a more
reliable evaluation of the PHWT, an accurate treatment of the
corrections for self shielding, multiple scattering and the effect
of neutron energy resolution, and the use of the well tested
R-matrix code SAMMY. Figure 2 shows the comparison of
the neutron capture kernels gΓγΓn/Γtot for the

90Zr resonances
with those reported in the Mughabghab compilation [11].

4.1 Maxwellian averaged capture cross section

In order to study the s-process abundances, the Maxwellian
averaged cross sections (MACS) are required over a range
of thermal energies. The MACS were calculated folding the
capture cross section with a maxwellian distribution of the
neutron fluence in a wide energy range (1 eV–550 keV).

Since the n TOF data cover part of this spectrum, only the
partial contribution to MACS can be accurately determined.
To calculate the MACS in the full energy range the JENDL
cross section were renormalized with respect to the n TOF
data.

Figure 3 shows the comparison between the MACS
calculated for the 96Zr with n TOF data and the JENDL
3.3 library and figure 4 shows the comparison of MACS
calculated for the 139La with n TOF data and the one
calculated from an FZK with activation method [15] and

MACSs are compared with recommended values derived
from previous data [13]. The MACS calculated on the present
experimental data except for the 94Zr result lower than those
reported in literature, although apart for the 96Zr the new
values are within the error bars of the previous data.

5 Conclusions

The (n,γ) cross sections of the 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr and 139La have
been measured over a wide neutron energy range using the
innovative features of the n TOF CERN facility. The capture
kernel presented in this work are for all sample except for 94Zr
weaker than what reported in the previous measurements and

in the libraries evaluated data. This result can be explained
in terms of the optimized performance of the facility, exper-
imental set-up, data acquisition and the more accurate data
analysis tools, as the PHWT and SAMMY code. The new
capture cross section have led to an improvement of the MACS
which were calculated with more accuracy and the values
found results lower than the values recommended from the
literature. Furthermore some other nuclear quantities has been
calculated as the level density, which implication for the 139La
are published in [8].
