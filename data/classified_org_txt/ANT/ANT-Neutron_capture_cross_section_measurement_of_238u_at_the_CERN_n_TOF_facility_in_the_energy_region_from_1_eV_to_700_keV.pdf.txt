F. MINGRONE et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 95, 034604 (2017)

The aim of this work is to provide a precise and accurate measurement of the 238U(n,γ ) reaction cross
section in the energy region from 1 eV to 700 keV. This reaction is of fundamental importance for the design
calculations of nuclear reactors, governing the behavior of the reactor core. In particular, fast reactors, which are
experiencing a growing interest for their ability to burn radioactive waste, operate in the high energy region of
the neutron spectrum. In this energy region most recent evaluations disagree due to inconsistencies in the existing
measurements of up to 15%. In addition, the assessment of nuclear data uncertainty performed for innovative
reactor systems shows that the uncertainty in the radiative capture cross section of 238U should be further reduced
to 1–3% in the energy region from 20 eV to 25 keV. To this purpose, addressed by the Nuclear Energy Agency as
a priority nuclear data need, complementary experiments, one at the GELINA and two at the n_TOF facility, were
proposed and carried out within the 7th Framework Project ANDES of the European Commission. The results
of one of these 238U(n,γ ) measurements performed at the n_TOF CERN facility are presented in this work. The
γ -ray cascade following the radiative neutron capture has been detected exploiting a setup of two C6D6 liquid
scintillators. Resonance parameters obtained from this work are on average in excellent agreement with the ones
reported in evaluated libraries. In the unresolved resonance region, this work yields a cross section in agreement
with evaluated libraries up to 80 keV, while for higher energies our results are significantly higher.

I. INTRODUCTION

In modern society energy has become one among the main
fuels for social and economic development. Nowadays, the
amount of energy used is massive, and it is destined to rise
as population and wealth increase. Needless to say, energy-
related activities have significant environmental impacts. The
main and most addressed issue is the emission of greenhouse
gas that follows the production of energy through fossil fuels as
coal, oil, and natural gas, and which results in serious damage
to climate, biodiversity, and human health [1]. To avoid the
business-as-usual dependence on fossil fuels, a map of future
energy mix that incorporates alternative sources is needed.
Several low-carbon resources should be part of this sustainable
energy portfolio, and among them nuclear energy seems to be
one of the few options available at scale to reduce carbon-
dioxide emissions while providing a baseload generation [2].

In this scenario, the development of improved reactor
technologies that will lead to an intrinsically safe nuclear
energy production is regarded as a necessary step to ensure
a long term sustainable energy supply [3]. Towards this
direction, the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) [4] has
worked since 2001 to identify and select six nuclear energy
systems that will be commercially available by 2030–2040.
In addition, the concept of a nuclear subcritical device called
accelerator driven system (ADS) is being developed both for
energy production and radioactive waste disposal [5].

The research and development of these new reactor con-
cepts require a level of accuracy and precision that challenges
the present knowledge of nuclear data. The prediction of the
behavior of the reactor cores strongly depends on neutron-
induced reaction cross-section data. In this context, the mea-
surement of the 238U radiative capture cross section is of high
priority and is part of the NEA High Priority Request List [6],
a compilation of the most relevant nuclear data requirements
maintained by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In
fact, 238U constitutes more than 90% of nuclear fuel in power
reactors, being one of the most important isotopes for neutron
transport calculations in the active zone. In particular, for ordi-
nary thermal nuclear reactors the uncertainties on fundamental

design parameters such as the multiplication factor, the power
peak, and the reactivity coefficient significantly depend on the
238U(n,γ ) reaction cross section for incident neutron energies
from 0.0253 eV to 25 keV. Furthermore, the 238U capture cross
section uncertainty affects the uncertainty of the Pu isotope
density at the end of the fuel cycle (1.1% for 239Pu, 0.2% for
240Pu, and 0.1% for 241Pu [7]).

The importance of the radiative capture reaction on 238U
initiated many measurements of this cross section, mainly at
the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) [8] and
at the Geel Linear Accelerator (GELINA) [9] facilities. In
particular, an evaluation has been made by Derrien et al.
in 2005 including the most significative previous capture
and transmission measurements [10,11]. Nevertheless, in the
fast region of the neutron spectrum, which is fundamental
for fast neutron reactor calculations, inconsistencies between
published experimental data can reach 15%, and the most
recent evaluations disagree with each other by more than the
uncertainties of the standards evaluation by Carlson et al. [12].
In addition, a recent project has started, the Collaborative
International Evaluated Library Organization (CIELO) [13],
which aims at producing an evaluated library common to
Europe, North America and Asia. The focus of this project
will initially be on a small number of the highest-priority
isotopes, including 238U due to its key relevance within the
nuclear industry.

To solve the present inconsistencies and to lower the
uncertainty in the cross section down to 1–3% in the energy
range from 20 eV to 25 keV, complementary experiments,
one at the EC-JRC laboratory GELINA and two at the
CERN n_TOF facility, were scheduled within task 1.2 of
the FP7 project ANDES of the European Commission [14].
The proposed objective was to combine results from different
detection systems and independent experimental principles,
obtained from measurements performed independently in
different facilities, so as to minimize the overall systematic
uncertainty.

This work presents the determination of high-accuracy
radiative capture cross section of 238U, starting from the
measurement performed at the n_TOF facility with an array

NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT OF . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 95, 034604 (2017)

of two C6D6 liquid scintillators, which has been optimized
with respect to the background induced by sample-scattered
neutrons, and takes advantage of the total energy detection
technique. This experimental setup, together with the ex-
tremely high instantaneous neutron flux of the n_TOF facility,
opens the possibility of measuring the 238U capture cross
section also for neutron energies above 100 keV, an energy
range of extreme interest for new nuclear technologies. In this
work the 238U(n,γ ) cross section has been analyzed from 1 eV
up to 700 keV.

II. EXPERIMENT

The measurement was performed at the neutron time-
of-flight (TOF) facility of CERN, n_TOF, which became
operative in 2001 and has since been at the cutting edge
of neutron cross section measurements. The pulsed neutron
beam at n_TOF is produced by spallation of 20 GeV/c
protons from the CERN Proton Synchrotron accelerator on a
water-cooled Pb target. A complete description of the n_TOF
facility can be found in Refs. [15,16]. Since the spallation
mechanism is a remarkably powerful source of neutrons,
the instantaneous intensity of the n_TOF neutron source of
∼2 × 1015 neutrons/pulse, is one of the highest worldwide.

The pulsed neutron source is used together with a mod-
eration system, so that the n_TOF neutron beam covers
about eleven orders of magnitude in energy from thermal
to GeV. In 2012, when the 238U(n,γ ) measurement was
performed, borated water was used as moderator to minimize
the production of 2.2-MeV γ rays originating from neutron
capture in water, which constitutes the main source of
background in measurements of capture cross-sections in the
keV neutron-energy region.

The facility has been designed on the basis of Monte Carlo
FLUKA [17,18] simulations, and in particular the neutron
source has been fully characterized together with its related
γ background.

The measurement takes advantage of the first beam line
operative at n_TOF, which is about 200 m long and is designed
to clean as much as possible the neutron beam from secondary
particles profusely produced in spallation reactions. To this
purpose, a sweeping magnet is placed at 145 m from the
spallation target to deflect the remaining charged particles in
the beam, and the beam tube is embedded in massive iron
and concrete shielding to stop particles around the beam pipe.
Two collimators 72 and 175 m downstream of the spallation
target are used for shaping the neutron beam. For capture
measurements the inner diameter of the second collimator is
reduced to 1.8 cm to allow for a close geometry between
sample and detectors. The first experimental area (EAR1),
where the samples and detection systems are placed, is a 7.9 m
long room starting at 182.3 m downstream of the spallation
target.

The neutron beam of the n_TOF facility is constantly
monitored by two independent low-background devices, with-
out significantly affecting the neutron beam: the Silicon
Monitor (SiMON) [19], with four silicon detectors looking
at a 300 μm thick 6Li foil in the beam, and two MicroMegas
detectors [20,21], with 235U and 10B as neutron converter. The

neutron flux of the n_TOF facility for the 2009, 2010, and 2011
campaigns has been evaluated combining five independent
measurements performed with different detectors, so as to
cover the entire energy range with the highest precision
reachable. A detailed description of the method can be found
in Ref. [22]. The flux related to this measurement, performed
in 2012, was not included in the evaluation procedure, but
it has been monitored at the experimental area with SiMON,
showing that the shape of the flux has remained constant within
2% (i.e., within uncertainties) between 0.1 eV and 150 keV.
In addition, the proton current, used to normalize the total
neutron output, has been monitored with the pick-up detection
system of the CERN Proton Synchrotron.

For capture measurements at n_TOF, two different de-
tection systems are available: a 4π BaF2 total absorption
calorimeter (TAC) [23] and an array of deuterated benzene
liquid scintillator detectors (C6D6 detectors). The measure-
ment of this work has been carried out with two C6D6
scintillators placed face to face at 90◦ with respect to the beam,
9 mm upstream of the sample: one commercial Bicron and
one custom-made developed at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe
(FZK) [24]. Both detectors are optimized to have a very
low sensitivity to background signals induced by scattered
neutrons. To this purpose the amount of detector material has
been minimized, and only materials with low neutron capture
cross section have been used. For instance, the window of the
photomultiplier is a custom boron-free quartz window, and the
housing of the FZK detector is entirely made of carbon fiber.

The total energy detection technique has been exploited,
combining the detection system described above with the pulse
height weighting technique (PHWT) [25] in order to assure the
proportionality between the detection efficiency and the total
energy released in the capture event.

The 238U sample, which has been provided by the EC-JRC
laboratory [9], consists of an extremely pure metal plate,
6.125 ± 0.006 g in mass, containing less than 1 ppm of 234U,
about 11 ppm of 235U and less than 1 ppm of 236U. The
sample is approximately rectangular in shape, with an area
of 1621.2 ± 0.1 mm2, and covers about 97% of the neutron
beam. The effective area has been determined by an optical
surface inspection with a microscope-based measurement
system from Mitutoyo [26]. To act in accordance with CERN
radio protection regulations, the sample has been encased in
∼60 μm and ∼75 μm thick Al and kapton foils. The effects
of this canning have been studied during the measurement
campaign by means of dedicated runs and were found to be
negligible. The high-quality sample used for the measurement
was instrumental for the accuracy of the results obtained.

In order to cover the same fraction of the neutron beam,
all samples used in this experiment have been chosen with
the same dimensions. A summary of the main features of the
samples is reported in Table I.

The data acquisition system (DAQ) of the n_TOF facility,
presented in detail in Ref. [27], is fully digital, flexible, and
almost dead-time free. It has been designed based on 8-bit
flash-ADCs with sampling rates of up to 2 GHz and 32 Mbyte
memory buffer. For the 238U(n,γ ) measurement two channels
of Acqiris-DC282 digitizers working at 500 MSamples/s are
used per detector. This system corresponds to 96 ms long data

III. OPERATION AND PERFORMANCES OF THE
EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

To reach the aim of a precise and accurate 238U(n,γ )
cross section the experimental setup has been precisely
characterized, with particular attention to the stability and
the performances of the scintillators. Moreover, in the present
work we took advantage of the GEANT4 [28] simulation toolkit
for the study of the experimental area and of the detection
system.

A. Stability of the detectors

The stability of the apparatus has been monitored with
respect to the neutron flux and to the capture detectors.
Concerning the neutron flux stability, we investigated the ratio
between the counting rate of the silicon monitors and the
number of protons derived from the current measurement via
the pick-up signal. Runs were selected for further analysis only
if this ratio was within 2% of the mean.

The stability of the two C6D6 detectors has been inves-
tigated by looking at the ratio of the C6D6 counting rate
for different runs in the strongest resonances. This ratio
has been recorded bunch per bunch, taking into account the
corresponding number of protons. At most, the normalized
number of entries per run deviates by about 6% from the mean
value, and those runs with percentage deviations greater than
3.5% have been rejected in order to reduce the dispersion of the
data set. With this constraint the distribution of the deviation
was less than 2% for 90% of the runs. By these conditions we
rejected in total 1.5% of the data from the Bicron and 5% from
the FZK detector, not significantly affecting the statistics of
the measurement. More details can be found in Ref. [29].

B. Amplitude to deposited energy calibration

As the PHWT requires the accurate energy calibration
of the capture detectors, a careful study of the calibrations
between the flash-ADC channels and the deposited energy has
been performed on a weekly basis using three standard γ -ray
sources: 137Cs (661.7 keV), 88Y (898 keV and 1.836 MeV),
and Am/Be (4.44 MeV). The peaks in the amplitude spectra,
corresponding to the respective Compton edge of the different
γ rays, are broadened by the detector resolution. This effect

FIG. 1. Calibrated amplitude spectra for 137Cs (Eγ = 661.7 keV),
88Y (Eγ = 898 keV and Eγ = 1.836 MeV), and Am/Be (Eγ =
4.44 MeV) γ -ray sources. The green lines correspond to the
broadened simulations, while the black dots are the experimental
points. In the inset the different curves for the channel to deposited-
energy calibration are shown.

needs to be taken into account when extracting the channel
numbers associated to the Compton edges, in order to properly
calibrate the flash-ADC channels. To this purpose, the GEANT4
simulations of the detector response have been broadened to
match the measured spectra.

This procedure is important to further check the stability
of the detector gain over the whole campaign. Comparing
the different calibration spectra for each source we actually
noticed a small variation of the gain, which has been adjusted
by applying different calibration curves. In Fig. 1 the Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations of the detector response, broadened
by the experimental resolution, are plotted together with
experimental data. In the inset of Fig. 1 the different calibration
lines are shown.

For the 238U(n,γ ) measurement the thresholds used for
the analysis have been chosen to be Emindep = 0.250 MeV and
Emaxdep = 5.53 MeV, corresponding to the Compton edge of
γ -ray energies of 407 keV and 5.77 MeV, respectively. The
upper threshold exceeds the neutron separation energy of
239U, Sn = 4.806 MeV, by 20% to account for the resolution
broadening.

C. Weighting functions

The PHWT technique requires a mathematical manipula-
tion of the response function of the detection system to achieve
proportionality between detection efficiency and deposited
energy. To this purpose a weighting function WF(Ed ) is
defined, and the detector response for different γ -ray energies,
which depends on γ -ray transport both in the detection system

034604-4



NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT OF . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 95, 034604 (2017)

and within the sample itself, has been simulated by means of
the GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation code. In these simulations,
the γ rays are emitted randomly within the sample following
the Gaussian xy distribution of the neutron beam profile, z
being the direction of the neutron beam.

The neutron transport within the sample can affect the γ -ray
spectrum recorded by the detector and becomes significant
only for high values of the product nσtot, where n is the areal
density in atoms/barn and σtot is the total cross section. In
the present case, where the 238U sample has an areal density
n = 9.56 × 10−4 atoms/barn, this condition is fulfilled only
near the peak-energy of the first three s-wave resonances.
Since it is not possible to account for this effect, which
depends on the cross section to be measured, we produced
two different weighting functions for each detector, one
considering an homogeneous distribution in the z direction of
the γ -ray emission within the sample, i.e. valid everywhere
except for the saturated resonances, and another with an
exponential attenuation, valid only in the saturation region of
the resonances. The first WF has been used for the resonance
shape analysis (RSA) and the analysis of the unresolved
resonance region, as well as to weight the background counting
rate. The second WF has been applied for the extraction
of the normalization factor through the saturated resonance
technique [30] (see Sec. IV C).

The polynomial dependence of the weighting function WF
on the energy deposited by γ rays is determined by a least-
squares fit to a number of γ -ray responses in the energy range
of interest, i.e., from 250 keV up to 10 MeV. In the calculation
the loss of counts due to the discrimination level has been
taken into account as discussed in Ref. [25].

IV. DATA REDUCTION

The experimental capture yield has been extracted dividing
the weighted counts Cw, after correction for the dead time
and subtraction of the corresponding background Bw, by the
incident neutron fluence φn [25,31]:

Yexp(En) =
N

Sn + En AA+1
Cw(En) − Bw(En)

φn(En)
, (1)

where N is the normalization factor, En the energy of the
incident neutron, Sn the neutron separation energy of the
compound nucleus, and A the mass number of the target
nucleus.

To achieve proportionality between deposited energy and
detection efficiency by the PHWT, means also to take the
efficiency of the two C6D6 scintillators for capture events into
account. Therefore, the normalization factor N includes the
effective area of the 238U sample intercepted by the neutron
beam, which is ∼97%, and the absolute value of the incident
neutron flux. A detailed explanation on the technique used to
extract the normalization factor will be addressed in Sec. IV C.

A. Time-of-flight to energy calibration

The neutron velocity and therefore the kinetic energy were
derived from the measured time-of-flight and the flight-path
length, which is nominally 185 m. The effective flight path

FIG. 2. 238U(n,γ ) capture yield compared with the total back-
ground and its individual components discussed in the text. The
analytical functions which reproduce the beam-related background
and the contribution of in-beam γ rays are superimposed to the
measured components.

length L(E) is not a fixed value but depends on the neutron
energy according to the neutron flight time distribution in
the spallation target and moderator assembly. This energy
dependent distribution is also known as the resolution function
(RF). For a given energy E, the effective flight path can be split
up as the sum of a fixed flight path length L0 and an additional
component λ(E), which corresponds to the expectation value
of the equivalent distance for a neutron of energy E. The
value of L0, valid in combination with the used RF obtained
by simulations, was fitted with the multilevel multichannel
R-matrix code SAMMY [32] using the first five resonances
and their corresponding energies. It is important to notice
that in this low energy region λ can be considered as a
constant.

The procedure has been verified with the well known low-
energy s-wave resonances of 197Au as in Ref. [33].

B. Background evaluation and subtraction

A precise background subtraction is fundamental for the
accuracy desired for this work, as outlined in Ref. [34].
Two different methods were considered for the study of
the background, in order to assess its contribution and its
uncertainty. Both methods are based on the identification of the
individual background components, either determined through
dedicated measurements or extrapolated from background
measurements with the use of MC simulations.

In Fig. 2 the 238U capture yield is shown together with the
background decomposed into the different contributions. The
total background has been calculated as

The time independent source of background CBO comes
from natural and sample radioactivity, and from air activation.
Because this contribution turned out to be sensitive to the posi-
tion of the sample on the vertical ladder of the sample changer,
it has been routinely studied with different beam-off measure-
ments corresponding to the different positions of the samples.
This contribution dominates for low energies up to few eV.

The main component of the beam-related background has
been evaluated without any sample in beam, in order to take all
sources of background in the experimental area into account
that are not related to the presence of the sample. In order to
avoid statistical fluctuations, the resulting shape, as a function
of TOF, has been fitted with an analytical function based on
a sum of parametrized exponentials [FEF in Eq. (2)], and an
uncertainty of 5% has been associated to that function.

The beam-related background due to in-beam γ rays,
although strongly suppressed by the borated water moderator,
plays an important role in the keV energy region. Its shape can
be deduced by means of a n + natPb measurement properly
subtracted by beam-off and sample-out contributions. The
difference in areal density between uranium and lead sample
as well as the different charge number were taken into account
as a scaling factor [finB in Eq. (2)], obtained through GEANT4
Monte Carlo simulations using the implemented geometry for
the calculation of the weighting functions. The initial in-beam
γ -ray distribution has been provided by Monte Carlo FLUKA
simulations (see Ref. [16] for more details about the simulated
γ -ray spectra in the experimental area). To avoid statistical
fluctuations the analytical form of this background has been
calculated and was fitted to the measured spectrum of Pb
after applying the scaling factor obtained with the simulations
[Fγ -inB in Eq. (2)].

Another source of background for (n,γ ) measurements is
related to the detection of γ rays coming from sample-scattered
neutrons captured in the ambient material. This background
follows the same energy dependence as the true capture events
and may therefore compromise the analysis of resonances.
To properly evaluate it, GEANT4 simulations have been
performed with a complete description of the geometry of
the experimental area. All the details of the procedure can
be found in Ref. [35]. The output of the simulation has been
analyzed using the same conditions as for the experimental
data [SNS in Eq. (2)].

The same simulations have been used to evaluate the con-
tribution of γ rays coming from fission events [Sfiss in Eq. (2)].
They can be due to prompt γ rays and γ rays from the decay of
fission-fragment. We used the models and data sets as reported
in Ref. [35], which for 238U provide data only up to 20 MeV.
Therefore we had to account for the missing part of the neutron
spectrum with a scaling procedure, assuming that the shape of
the γ background coming from fission events does not change
with increasing energy. We multiplied the reference 238U(n,f )
cross section from Ref. [36] with the simulated n_TOF neutron
flux to obtain an estimated count rate, and we scaled the
simulated background for the ratio between the integral of
the expected count rate up to 20 MeV and up to 1 GeV.

The overall background is dominated by the general
background, independent of the sample itself. Only in the
unresolved resonance region (URR) above about 10 keV the

FIG. 3. Background yield in the URR obtained by summing the
individual background components shown in Fig. 2 (red dots) and by
using the black-resonance filters in the neutron beam (blue circles).
The bottom panel shows that the ratio deviates by less than 5% from
unity, except in the neighbourhood of the two big Al resonances at
34.23 and 84.27 keV, because the amount of aluminum in the windows
of the beam line was not precisely known.

in-beam γ rays start to contribute a comparable fraction. All
other background components are of minor importance. The
favorable signal/background ratio in the resolved resonance
region (RRR) is shrinking at higher energies but remains
always better than 2 : 1 throughout the URR.

To validate the level of the background in the URR
we exploited measurements with Ag, W, Co, and Al black
resonance filters in beam [31]. The shape of the time-dependent
background has been evaluated in a n + natPb measurement,
and the beam-off contribution was added in order to obtain the
complete background function. The resulting background has
been properly scaled to reproduce the background during the
measurement according to the procedure introduced by Aerts
et al. [37]. In particular, the total background, in counts per
log-equidistant time-of-flight bin, can be reproduced by the
function

B(t) = atb + k1
k2(t)

Pb(t), (3)

where atb reproduces the constant beam-off background, with
b fixed to 1 because of the units of B(t). To take into account the
attenuation of both the neutron beam and the in-beam photons,
two scaling factors have been identified: a time-independent
factor k1 to scale the contribution of n + natPb without filters
to the n + 238U with filters, and a time-dependent factor k2(t)
to take the attenuation of the in-beam γ rays by the filters into
account. The time-dependence reflects the fact that the relative
intensities of the in-beam γ rays change with time-of-flight.

As shown in Fig. 3, the background yields agree for 3 <
En < 100 keV within less than 5% except for energies in the

neighbourhood of the two strong Al resonances at 34.23 and
84.27 keV. For neutron energies above 100 keV, it is impossible
to determine the background with the Al filter reliably because
of the increasing resonance structure of the Al cross section.

C. Capture yield normalization

The experimental capture yield has been internally nor-
malized to the peaks of the first three well-isolated saturated
resonances at 6.67 eV, 20.9 eV, and 36.7 eV. Since nσtot � 1
at the resonance peak, all the incident neutrons with energies
close to the resonance interact with the sample and therefore
the effects of neutron transport cannot be neglected in the
region of a saturated resonance. For this reason the weighting
function that includes an exponential attenuation within the
sample has been used.

A spectrum with a weighting function was also calculated
for homogeneous γ -ray production inside the sample, cor-
responding to nσtot � 1. The ratio of the weighted spectra
obtained with the two weighting functions deviated from
unity by less than 0.5%. For this reason we neglected the
energy-dependent yield correction as in Ref. [38].

The normalization factor N in Eq. (1) has been extracted
via the saturated resonance method, evaluating the expected
capture yield through a least-squares adjustment of the
experimental data with the SAMMY code [32]. Because an
internal normalization is applied, i.e., exploiting a resonance
of the nucleus under investigation, the systematic uncertainties
due to changes in the experimental conditions are significantly
reduced.

The two detectors have been treated separately, and for
each one the final normalization factors have been chosen as
the average of the three resonances. The mean deviation of
these factors of 1% has been adopted as the normalization
uncertainty.

D. Discussion of uncertainties

The total uncertainty in the 238U(n,γ ) cross section is
a combination of several components related to the sample
characteristics and the analysis procedure. Along with the un-
correlated uncertainty due to the counting statistics, correlated
uncertainties are involved as well.

The uncertainty related to sample characterization is almost
negligible since the sample mass has been determined at the
EC-JRC with an accuracy of about 0.1%.

An important source of correlated uncertainty is the yield
normalization. As discussed in Sec. IV C, the uncertainty in
the normalization factor is reduced to less than 1% by the
internal normalization. This correlated uncertainty component
has to be combined with the uncertainty of the neutron flux
shape between 1 and 5%, depending on neutron energy [22].

The uncertainty related to the background subtraction
propagates to the final capture yield in correlation to the
signal-to-background ratio, and it depends on the energy range
considered. Within the RRR the signal to background ratio
varies from a factor of 4 to a factor of 100, depending on the
strength of the resonance. In the URR the signal to background
ratio is about a factor of 2, resulting in a 3% uncertainty of the
background subtraction for 3 < En < 100 keV.

For higher energies from 100 to 700 keV the level of
the background strongly depends on the γ -ray component,
which has been estimated from MC simulations. An un-
certainty of ∼7% has been attributed to the background
level for this energy range. The estimation of the un-
certainty has been based on the comparison between the
GEANT4 full simulations (i.e., considering all background
contributions) and the experimental data for 197Au. The
agreement between the two, within a few percent, provided
confirmation of the level of accuracy of the simulated
background.

In Table II all the correlated uncertainties are listed for the
different energy ranges.

V. RESULTS

A. Resolved resonance region

The energy resolution of the n_TOF spectrometer gives
an upper energy limit of 20 keV to the RRR, since the
experimental broadening becomes comparable with the level
spacing. However, due to the decrease of the signal-to-
background ratio with neutron energy together with the limited
counting statistics, resonances could be reliably resolved only
up to 3 keV.

Within this energy region a resonance shape analysis has
been performed by means of the SAMMY code [32]. The
theoretical reaction yield is obtained through the Reich-Moore
approximation of the multilevel R-matrix formalism, and
convoluted with the experimental resolution. This latter is
implemented in SAMMY via a numerical description derived
from Monte Carlo FLUKA simulations. Moreover, the code
includes the corrections for multiple-scattering effects and uses

the free-gas model to take the Doppler broadening due to
thermal motion of atoms inside the sample for an effective
temperature of 305 K into account, according to the room
temperature which was continuously monitored during the
measurement [31].

The resonance parameters (i.e., the capture width �γ and
the neutron width �n) are determined by a least-square fit to
the experimental data, while the resonance spins are taken
from literature. In this work, starting from initial values taken
from the JEFF-3.2 library [39], only the smaller parameter,
either �γ or �n, has been left free in the fitting procedure. In
a few cases both partial widths were left free to improve the
description of the resonance shape analysis.

The results from this work have been compared with the
evaluated data libraries JEFF-3.2 [39] and ENDF/B-VII.1 [40].
The ratio of kernels [defined as κ = g�n�γ /(�n + �γ )] from
this work to the ones obtained from evaluated parameters
from JEFF-3.2 and ENDF/B-VII.1 has been studied as a
function of resonance energy to test the accuracy of the
measurement. Because of the large number of measurements
carried out so far and the effort spent in producing an accurate
238U(n,γ ) evaluation, significant deviation from the evaluated
data are not expected. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the statistical
distributions are found to be Gaussians centered at 0.99 and
1.00, respectively, both with a standard deviation of 0.06,
showing the excellent agreement between data from this work
and evaluated libraries. The measured capture yield together
with the SAMMY best-fit curve is shown in Fig. 5.

Below 1.5 keV, the JEFF-3.2 and ENDF-B/VII.1 libraries
present sizable differences for some resonances. In this energy
region, there are two resonances from this work, at 721.68 eV
and 1211.31 eV, respectively, which strongly differ from those
indicated in the ENDF/B-VII.1 library, while they are in good

agreement with JEFF-3.2. In particular, the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluation gives �γ = 3.15 meV and 6.6 meV for these
resonances, whereas JEFF-3.2 reports �γ = 23.0 meV and
�γ = 17.55 meV, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the
partial widths obtained from this work are in agreement with
the ones reported by JEFF-3.2. Nevertheless, the difference
with ENDF/VII.1 can be explained to some extent with a
different treatment of the fission contribution [41,42].

Residual systematic effects related to neutron scattering
or to the resonance strength have been evaluated studying
kernel ratios as a function of the ratio g�n/�γ and of the
resonance kernel itself. In the former case, no evidence of
systematic effects are visible as expected from the optimized
detection set-up used. Regarding effects due to the resonance
strength, it has been seen that for weak resonances, char-
acterized by very small kernels (κ � 2.3 meV), resonance
parameters obtained from this work are systematically larger
than the evaluated ones. Despite the low strength of these
resonances, three of them are in the low energy region,
ER = 145.66,311.35,488.89 eV, where the statistics is very
high. The fitting procedure is therefore quite accurate, and
Fig. 7 shows that data from this work are actually higher than
what is predicted by using the JEFF-3.2. parameters The same
conclusion can be drawn for the resonance at ER = 1565.54
eV, a stronger resonance, which is ∼27% higher than predicted
from JEFF-3.2 parameters. The kernels of critical resonances
obtained from this work are compared with the evaluated
parameters in Table III.

B. Unresolved resonance region

As the experimental conditions are limiting the energy
region where the cross section can be analyzed through a RSA
to about 3 keV, the capture cross section at energies up to
700 keV is obtained from the measured yield by applying a
correction factor determined from average parameters.

To extract the cross section the thin-sample approximation
Y ≈ nσγ is used. At high energies, in fact, the total cross
section becomes quite low (σtot ∼ 1 b) so that the areal density
n = 9.56 × 10−4 at/b is sufficiently low to fulfill the condition
nσtot � 1.

The sample-related effects, i.e., self-shielding and multiple
scattering followed by capture, are taken into account applying
a correction factor obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.

ness 60 μm and 75 μm, respectively. We used MCNP6 [43]
to generate neutrons with a Gaussian spatial beam profile
impinging on the 238U sample and to tally the time when
a capture reaction occurred in the 238U material. This time
can then be converted to an equivalent neutron energy. From
the number of capture reactions and the number of incident
neutrons the quantity Y c can be calculated. This observable as
a function of time is the most adequate approach to obtain a
quantity comparable to a time-of-flight measurement, and is
also used for multiple scattering corrections in the resolved
resonance region [44]. The evaluated nuclear data library
ENDF/B-VII.1 was used for all nuclei in the simulations. By
trying different variations we found that the difference between
a uniform or Gaussian beam profile is negligible. On the other
hand, the presence of aluminum has a non-negligible effect as
can be seen from the peaks corresponding to Al resonances
in Fig. 8. The results were confirmed by simulations with the
code GEANT4. The factor Cf shown in Fig. 8 was applied to
the background-corrected experimental capture yield to obtain
the average capture cross section σγ .

at the n_TOF facility of CERN using an array of two
deuterated-benzene scintillators. The purpose was to provide
highly precise results to solve the inconsistencies among data
in literature and in evaluated libraries. This cross section is in
fact of extreme importance for the calculations of fast and
thermal reactor parameters, and in particular the safety of
nuclear reactors mainly depends on its uncertainty.

Thanks to the low background of the experimental setup,
and to the high intensity of the n_TOF neutron flux, the
cross section could be measured from 1 eV to 700 keV.
The measurement has been prepared and the data analyzed
with extreme accuracy and precision, in order to provide
results with an uncertainty as low as possible. In partic-
ular, great efforts have been made in order to evaluate
and estimate all sources of background that affected the
measurement.

As expected, resonance parameters from this work show
very good agreement with data in the JEFF-3.2 and ENDF/B-
VII.1 evaluated libraries. Nevertheless, for a few weak reso-
nances significantly higher kernels were found compared to
evaluated data.

For neutron energies higher than 3 keV, the cross section
has been extracted from the measured yield using average
parameters to determine the correction factor for self-shielding
and multiple interaction. In this unresolved resonance region,
the γ background strongly affects the measurement and, since
it is not possible to directly measure its contribution, it has been
precisely determined by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

For energies up to 20 keV results from this work are in
fair agreement with the recent results obtained in GELINA from
Kim et al. and with the cross section recommended by Carlson
et al., and up to 630 keV with the recent data by Ullmann et al.
From 20 to 80 keV the cross section from this work tends
to stay slightly below the evaluated data, while for higher
neutron energies from 80 to 700 keV the trend is opposite,
and this work yields a cross section 15 to 25% higher than
the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation, and 21 to 32% higher than the
JEFF-3.2 evaluation.

A comparison with the spectrum-averaged cross section
obtained by Wallner et al. shows good agreement for the result
with the energy distribution centered at En = 25.3 keV, while
data from this work yield a 16% higher value for the energy
distribution peaked at En = 426 keV.
