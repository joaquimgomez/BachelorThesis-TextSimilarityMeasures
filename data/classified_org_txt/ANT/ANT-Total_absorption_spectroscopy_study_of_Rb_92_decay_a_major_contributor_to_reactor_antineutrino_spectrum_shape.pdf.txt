The antineutrino spectra measured in recent experiments at reactors are inconsistent with calculations
based on the conversion of integral beta spectra recorded at the ILL reactor. 92Rb makes the dominant
contribution to the reactor antineutrino spectrum in the 5–8 MeV range but its decay properties are in
question. We have studied 92Rb decay with total absorption spectroscopy. Previously unobserved beta
feeding was seen in the 4.5–5.5 region and the GS to GS feeding was found to be 87.5(25)%. The impact on
the reactor antineutrino spectra calculated with the summation method is shown and discussed.

Beta decay properties of fission products are at the
origin of the antineutrino flux emitted by reactor cores.
This flux has been used for decades as a source for reactor
neutrino experiments, such as Daya Bay, Double Chooz,
and Reno which have recently published their new results
for the mixing angle θ13 [1–3]. These results will allow
future searches for the CP violation phase δ or the
neutrino mass hierarchy with complementary experiments
at reactors [4]. The accurate determination and under-
standing of the emitted reactor antineutrino flux is thus
still required for present and future experiments. The
recent reestimate of reactor antineutrino energy spectra
[5,6] has led to the so-called “reactor anomaly” [7], at the
origin of new experimental projects chasing short distance
oscillations at research reactors [8]. These calculations
are based on the conversion into antineutrinos of the only
available measurement of the beta energy spectra per-
formed using the high flux reactor at the Institut Laue-
Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France [9]. The conversion
method has until now been considered as the most precise
one by experimenters studying neutrino oscillations. But
recently, Hayes et al. [10] have shown that it is dependent
on the underlying nuclear physics and that the associated

errors should be revised. In addition, very recent exper-
imental results from [1–3] have shown an unexplained
distortion between 4 and 8 MeV in their measured
positron energy spectra from pressurized water reactors
(PWR) [11] with respect to the converted spectra [5,6]
(an excess of ca. 10% over 2 MeV followed by a dip). The
positron energy used in reactor antineutrino experiments
corresponds to the antineutrino energy minus the mass
difference between the neutron and proton. In this context,
new evaluations of PWR antineutrino energy spectrum
are essential.
An alternative method, independent of the ILL mea-

surements, relies on the summation of the contributions
of the fission product beta decay branches to obtain the
antineutrino energy spectra. The need to measure new
nuclear physics properties of some major contributors
to the antineutrino spectrum was underlined in
Ref. [12], where it was shown that we should use the
total absorption spectroscopy (TAS) technique to avoid
the pandemonium effect [13] and improve the predic-
tions of the summation method. The summation method
is indeed the only one which allows the prediction
of antineutrino spectra for which no integral beta

measurement exists. This is required, for instance, in the
context of the R&D of antineutrino detection as a tool for
reactor monitoring [14].
In this Letter, we present the first results of an exper-

imental campaign performed with TAS technique [15]
aimed at the measurement of beta decay properties of
important contributors to the reactor antineutrino energy
spectrum emitted by PWRs. In particular, we show new
results for 92Rb, the largest contributor to the reactor
antineutrino flux in the energy range above 5 MeV.
In the following, we present a short list of nuclei making
the main contributions to the antineutrino energy spectrum
above 4 MeV, obtained using the summation method
presented in Ref. [12]. Then, previous experimental knowl-
edge of the beta decay properties of 92Rb is summarized,
and the TAS method, the experimental setup used and the
data analysis performed are presented. Finally, we show the
beta feeding obtained and present the impact of the new
results on reactor antineutrino energy spectra.
The main contributors to the antineutrino energy spectra

from 4 to 8 MeVare listed in Table I. In our calculation, we
have chosen to minimize the impact of the pandemonium
effect on the antineutrino spectra and on the computed
proportions of the nuclei per energy bin. For this purpose,
we have used data from Ref. [16] for 92;93;94Rb, 96Y, 142Cs,
135Te and from Ref. [17] for 95Sr and 90Rb, because these
two sets of data are likely to be pandemonium free (though
they may suffer from other systematic errors). As they were
not measured by Refs. [17] or [16], data for 98mY and 100Nb
were taken from Ref. [18] and 104mNb from Ref. [19].
Indeed, a careful choice of data sets is needed, especially to
select nuclei which would deserve new measurements, as is
illustrated below with the case of 92Rb. Note that in the
4–6 MeV range, unknown nuclei requiring the use of

models represent less than 1% of the spectrum, while they
represent about 4% of the 7–8 MeV bin.

92Rb makes the main contribution between 4 and 8 MeV,
representing alone up to about 38% of the 7–8MeV bin and
16% of the 5–8 MeV range. 92Rb is quite controversial: the
beta feeding to the ground state of its daughter nucleus,
92Sr, was fixed at 51%� 18% in the ENSDF data base [20]
until 2012, before the inclusion in the references of the
article from Lhersonneau et al. [21], which concluded that
close to half of the decay intensity, mostly high energy
ground state transitions, is missing in the decay scheme.
Following this reference the beta feeding to the ground state
of 92Sr was recently changed to 95.2%� 0.7% in the
ENSDF database [19].

92Rb has a large Qβ value which makes it a good
candidate to be a pandemonium nucleus. The pandemo-
nium effect [13] arises from the difficulty encountered in
building level schemes for complex beta decays using
Germanium detectors, especially when beta transitions
occur to high-energy levels or regions of high level density.
This leads to an underestimate of the corresponding beta
branches to states at high excitation energy and thus to a
distortion in the beta decay feeding. In addition, 92Rb has
also been used as a critical example [22] to show how beta-
decay strength calculations impact on the predictive power
of models in reconstructing half-lives and beta-delayed
neutron emission probabilities of nuclei, whose properties
are important in the simulation of the astrophysical r
process. It is also on NEA/IAEA lists of important
contributors to reactor decay heat [23].
A total absorption spectrometer is a calorimeter meas-

uring the gamma cascades emitted by the deexcitation of
the daughter nucleus after beta decay of the parent. The
detection of the total energy allows the deduction of the
feeding probability of excited levels populated in the beta
decay. This quantity is calculated by solving the “inverse
problem” as presented below. The beta feeding f gives
direct access to the beta intensity Ii ¼ fi=Σkfk and then
to the beta strength, a microscopic quantity that can be
directly compared with models [24]. The detector used in
the measurement of the 92Rb decay is composed of 12
crystals of BaF2 arranged in a compact geometry described
in Ref. [25]. Each crystal is coupled to a photomultiplier
tube converting the scintillation light into an electrical
signal directly proportional to the detected energy. The
gamma detection efficiency was ∼80% at 5 MeV. This
spectrometer was coupled to a silicon detector placed in the
center, behind the source implantation zone, to tag the beta
emission. This reduces the background by demanding
coincidences between beta events and the following gamma
emission from deexcitation of levels in the daughter.

92Rb ions were produced via proton-induced fission on
an uranium target at the IGISOL facility [26] in the
accelerator laboratory of the University of Jyväskylä
(Finland). JYFLTRAP double Penning trap [27] was used

for selecting with high precision only 92Rb ions using the
mass-selective buffer gas cooling technique [28]. This
high level of purification of the beam is necessary in
TAS experiments in order to reduce systematic uncertain-
ties related to the purity of the beam.
As stated above, the main observable in a TAS meas-

urement is the beta feeding to the energy levels of the
daughter nucleus, which is contained in the measured
gamma spectrum convoluted with the detector response.
To extract this information we have to solve the so-called
inverse problem. It consists of solving the equation

di ¼ RðBÞij × fj, where R
ðBÞ
ij is the response matrix of the

detector to an assumed decay level scheme ðBÞ. Rij
connects feeding to level j (fj) to counts in the bin i of
the “measured” TAS spectrum (di). The analysis procedure
has been described in previous publications [24,29] and is
well understood.
To perform the analysis, very clean decay data d are

required. Possible contamination from the daughter nuclei
decay and pileup signals are subtracted from the raw data.
The shape of the pile-up spectrum has been computed by
summing in the ADC time window two events randomly
extracted from the raw data. The absolute normalization of
the pileup was performed using the data counting rate and
the ADC time window in which random coincidences can
occur [30,31]. The shape of the spectrum from the decay of
the daughter nucleus 92Sr has been simulated using its
known level scheme from ENSDF [19] and the detector
response. The normalization factor has been obtained
solving the Bateman equations for the decay of 92Rb in
realistic experimental conditions, i.e., considering the
experimental time for implantation and measuring cycles.
The contamination from 92Sr decay represents 0.08% of the
total 92Rb data acquired. The response matrix R is
calculated by simulating the detector response to beta
and gamma cascades emitted during the decay with a
dedicated GEANT4 [32] Monte Carlo simulation. The latter
has been validated using measurements performed with
known sources in order to reproduce the detector response
in great detail [30,33,34]. The inverse problem is solved by
using a maximization expectation algorithm based on the
Bayes theorem and combined with a χ2 minimization [35].
It makes use of an iterative method to find the final feeding
distribution by minimizing the difference between the
experimental data and the spectrum recreated by the result
of the algorithm at each iteration. The analysis starts with a
first guess at feeding values extracted from the literature, or
an equally probable feeding distribution if the nucleus is
poorly known, and stops when the χ2 value deduced from
the two spectra is at a minimum.
The starting point for solving the inverse problem is the

construction of the branching ratio matrix (B) for the
states populated in the decay. For this purpose we begin
by using the known information, derived from high

resolution studies, about levels up to an excitation energy
of 1778 keV in 92Sr [19]. Above this energy little is
known and the data are divided into 40 keV bins up to the
Qβ value. In this range we must have recourse to semi-
empirical statistical models and we must supply as input
both the level densities and gamma strength functions.
Three level-density models were tested: Back-Shifted-
Fermi-Gas (BSFG) [36,37], Constant-Temperature [37],
and Gilbert-Cameron models [38]. The last of these is a
combination of the other two. The Gilbert-Cameron
formulation was chosen because it best reproduces the
experimental data at low energies. The gamma strengths
were modeled with a Lorentz function using the param-
eters given in Ref. [39]. In determining the β-feeding
distribution, it is possible to fix or vary the feeding to
each individual level or energy bin. The feeding to the
1673.3 keV level was set to zero, since the probable spin
parity is 4þ and any feeding from the 92Rb ground state
must be negligible.
The reconstructed spectrum (blue dashed line) calculated

using the feeding distribution obtained from this analysis is
compared with the clean decay data (black continuous line)
of 92Rb in the upper panel of Fig. 1 [30]. The lower panel
shows the residues between these two curves. The beta
intensity obtained from the solution of the inverse problem
for 92Rb is shown in Fig. 2 in the blue continuous line,
while the red dashed lines are the intensities from ENSDF
[19]. As the ground state feeding is very important in the
case of the decay of 92Rb, we have estimated the main
errors involved in this reconstruction [30]. They are listed
as follows: the threshold of the beta spectrum, statistical
uncertainty, error induced by pile-up subtraction, errors in
the detector energy calibration and resolution used in the
calculation of the response matrix R and errors obtained by

testing different input parameters for the calculation of R
and inverse problem resolution. A sum in quadrature of
all the systematic and statistical errors quoted above gives
a 2.5% error on the ground state feeding. This result is
conservative, as we have voluntarily adopted large values of
the main errors which are associated with the threshold of
the beta spectrum and with the choice of model for the level
density. The TAS results show some beta intensity around
4.5 and 5.5 MeV which was not detected before. The
intensity to the ground state obtained from our analysis is
87.5 (25)%. This value can be obtained from the data
analysis because the TAS detector also measures the
bremsstrahlung radiation from the beta particles. These
events are in the low energy part of the measured spectrum
and, since they are considered in the response matrix R,
they contribute to the reconstruction of the spectrum and,
then, in the calculation of beta feeding. The selected ground
state feeding is the one which minimizes the χ2 value
determined from the experimental data and the recon-
structed spectrum after the analysis. If we fix the ground
state feeding to be 95.2% as reported in the ENSDF data
base [19] our analysis converges with a χ2 value of 2048
which is much larger than the minimum of 630, completely
excluding this hypothesis.
The antineutrino energy spectrum emitted in 92Rb beta

decay has been computed using the beta feeding presented
above. The GS to GS transition is first-forbidden nonun-
ique (spin parity of 92Rb 0−). Different spectral shapes
were assumed for this transition, considering the different
possibilities listed in Ref. [10]; an allowed shape, a first
forbidden nonunique shape due to the GT operator and a
first forbidden nonunique shape due to the ρA operator.
It was also assumed that the remaining transitions were
of allowed or first forbidden unique type. The various
combinations of these options were computed and the
shapes obtained were very similar. No significant impact

is expected from the uncertainty of the shape of the first
forbidden nonunique GS to GS transition. We chose to
adopt an allowed shape for the GS to GS transition and first
forbidden unique shapes for the remaining branches due
to the spins and parities of the known transitions in this
nucleus.
The antineutrino energy spectra were calculated with the

summation method described in Ref. [12]. In Ref. [12]
the data adopted for 92Rb were extracted from Ref. [16].
In principle, these measurements should not suffer from
the pandemonium effect, nor from a lack of knowledge of
the types of the beta transitions. Unfortunately, however,
the error bars are quite large. In Fig. 3, the ratio between the
antineutrino spectra of 239;241Pu and 235;238U from Ref. [12]
and those obtained using our new results for 92Rb is
displayed with the red dashed-dotted line. As expected,
the main effect is in the 4 to 8 MeV antineutrino energy
range, with a maximum between 7 and 8MeV, and amounts
to 4.5% for 235U, 3.5% for 239Pu, 2% for 241Pu, and 1.5%
for 238U. These discrepancies are due to the difference in
the shapes of the antineutrino spectra built with the newly
measured beta feedings with respect to the antineutrino
spectra converted from Rudstam’s measurements. The
comparison would be very similar if we had used the
latest ENSDF [19] data for 92Rb in our summation

at theQ value of the 92Rb, is due to the different values inQ given
in Refs. [16] and [19], that were used to reconstruct the
antineutrino spectrum. A gray horizontal bar is placed above
the antineutrino energy scale to indicate the region of the
distortion observed by the reactor antineutrino experiments with
respect to the converted spectra.

calculations, as was done in Ref. [40]. The ratio is
displayed as well in Fig. 3 with green dotted lines, and
is nearly superposed on the ratio built when using Rudstam
data in the first place. The change becomes even more
dramatic if one compares with summation method spectra
in which an older version of the ENSDF data was used, as
in Ref. [41]. The latter ratio is plotted with black dashed
lines in Fig. 3. This shows the relevance of the present 92Rb
decay data in the calculations.
In summary, the results of new measurements of the beta

decay properties of 92Rb have been presented. This nucleus
makes one of the largest contributions to the emitted
antineutrino flux by standard thermal reactors in the energy
region above 5 MeV. The measurements have been per-
formed using pure isotopic beams and the TAS technique
to provide data free from the pandemonium effect. The
measured feeding distribution, which extends to states
previously not seen in high-resolution measurements and
also determines the GS to GS feeeding as 87.5(25)%,
confirms the relevance of this decay to antineutrino
summation calculations. The impact of the measurements
has been evaluated by comparing the ratio of summation
calculations using the new feeding distribution with the
results using the feeding distributions employed in
Refs. [12,40,41]. The effect of introducing the new results
is particularly marked in the case of Ref. [41] and calls for a
revision of the conclusions drawn in that Letter. It is clear
that this is because the GS to GS feeding used in Ref. [41]
was incorrect. The overall agreement of the new summation
calculations with the converted spectra [6] is improved in
the 4 to 8 MeV range except in the case of 235U for which
the summation method spectrum is always below the
converted spectrum. The change is especially striking in
the case of Ref. [41] in the 5 to 8 MeVantineutrino energy
range, which overlaps the energy region in which reactor
neutrino experiments have shown a spectral distortion [11].
It also shows that the inclusion of all existing TAS nuclear
data (ca. 37 nuclei) in Ref. [41]’s calculation may change
dramatically the spectral shape they compute. Overall, this
emphasizes why new measurements are needed for the
radioactive decays of importance in the reactor antineutrino
spectrum and, in particular, why measurements should be
performed with the total absorption method. The present
measurement, which reduces significantly the uncertainties
associated with the antineutrino summation calculations in
the 4 to 8 MeV range, is an important step towards better
predictions with the summation method. Provided that in
the 4 to 6 MeV range, unknown nuclei requiring the use of
models represent less than 1% of the spectrum in the
summation calculation from Ref. [12], one can thus expect
a dramatic reduction of the final uncertainty in this range
as a long term result of the TAS campaign. In parallel,
the impact of the uncertainties of the fission yields on
the antineutrino spectrum needs to be evaluated more
accurately.
