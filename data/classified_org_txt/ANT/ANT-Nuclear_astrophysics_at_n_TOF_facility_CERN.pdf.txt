Abstract 
CERN's neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF has produced a considerable 
amount of experimental data since it has become fully operational with the 
start of its scientific measurement programme in 2001. The innovative 
features of the facility, in the two experimental areas, (flight paths 20 m and 
185 m), allow for an accurate determination of the neutron cross section for 
radioactive samples or for isotopes with small neutron capture cross section, 
of interest for Nuclear Astrophysics. An outline of the experimental nuclear 
astrophysical data activities at n_TOF will be presented. 

1 Introduction  
Neutron-induced cross sections play a fundamental role in Nuclear Astrophysics, being nuclear 
physics a key ingredient in stellar nucleosynthesis of heavy elements [1], as well as in light element 
production in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [2]. In stars, neutron capture reactions are responsible for the 
production of the majority of elements heavier than Fe, with two processes contributing more or less 
equally to the overall abundance pattern: the s- and the r-process. The r-process, associated to 
explosive stellar scenario, is characterized by very high neutron densities, higher than 1020 cm-3. In this 
process the reaction flow is driven towards the neutron rich side, since neutron captures are faster than 
radioactive decays. In the s-process, which involves low neutron densities and mostly stable isotopes, 
progressively heavier elements are produced starting from the Fe seed nuclei, by neutron captures and 
subsequent β-decays. An interesting case occurs when an unstable nucleus with a relatively long half-
life is produced in the process, as it can either decay or undergo a further neutron capture reaction, thus 
generating a branching in the s-process path. The competition between neutron capture and β-decay 
depends on the capture cross section, on the stellar half-life of the branching isotope and, most 
importantly, on the stellar thermodynamic conditions, in particular the neutron density and stellar 
temperature. As a consequence, the study of the branching points can shed some light on the stellar 
environment in which the s-process takes place, provided that accurate nuclear data on capture cross 
section and decay half-life are available. Apart from heavy elements, neutron capture cross sections 
are needed to clarify one of the most intriguing and long-lasting problems in Big Bang 
Nucleosynthesis (BBN), i.e. the gross overestimate in BBN models of the primordial abundance of 
Lithium. Although neutron-induced reactions of relevance for Nuclear Astrophysics are being studied 
since many decades at neutron facilities worldwide, some open issues in stellar and primordial 
nucleosynthesis still remain to be addressed in order to reach a more comprehensive understanding of 
the elemental abundance distribution and of the galactic chemical evolution. To this end, an intense 
experimental program is undergoing at the neutron facility n_TOF (CERN) since almost two decades, 
in order to reduce the uncertainty on neutron capture and (n, charged particle) cross sections for some 
key isotopes, and ultimately improve the reliability of astrophysical models.

Figure 1 Sketch of the n TOF facility with its two neutron beam lines (drawn in blue) ending in the experimental 
areas EAR1 and EAR2. The neutron source, on the left lower part of the drawing, is a lead spallation target on 
which the proton beam (in green) impinges. In the direction of EAR1 a separate neutron moderator is located. 
The two different targets that have been used up to now are shown in the top insets (surrounding cooling water 
omitted, see text). 

 

2 The n_TOF facility 
The neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF was constructed following an idea proposed by Rubbia et al. 
[3] and has become fully operational in 2001. The facility is based on the 6 ns wide, 20 GeV pulsed 
proton beam from CERN’s Proton Synchrotron (PS) with typically 7 × 1012 protons per pulse, 
impinging on a lead spallation target, yielding about 300 neutrons per incident proton. A layer of water 
around the spallation target moderates the initially fast neutrons down to a white spectrum of neutrons 
covering the full range of energies between meV and GeV. The neutron bunches are spaced by 
multiples of 1.2 s, a characteristic of the operation cycle of the PS. This allows measurements to be 
made over long times of flight, reaching to low neutron energies, as low as 10 meV, without any 
overlap into the next neutron cycle. The large energy range that can be measured at once is one of the 
key characteristics of the facility. Another important feature of n_TOF is the very high number of 
neutrons per proton burst, also called instantaneous neutron flux. In case of cross section 
measurements on radioactive samples in the neutron beam, as the case of branching points, this results 
in a favourable ratio between the number of signals due to neutron-induced reactions and those due to 
radioactive decay events contributing to the background. At present two beam lines are in operation, 
one in the horizontal direction and the other one on the vertical of the spallation target. A schematic 
drawing of the facility is shown in Fig. 1. The two insets depict the two spallation targets used up to 
now. The neutron flux in the two experimental areas, in units of lethargy, is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 n_TOF neutron flux at EAR1 with normal (black) and borated (red) water as moderator compared with 
neutron flux at EAR2 (blue) 

The strong suppression of the thermal neutron peak in EAR1 is due to the use of 10B-loaded moderator, 
whose main purpose is to suppress the γ-background related to neutron capture in water. The shorter 
flight distance of about a factor 10 also results in a 10 times shorter time interval for a same energy 
region. Therefore, the combination of the higher flux and the shorter time interval results in an 
increase of the signal to noise ratio of a factor 250 (flux expressed in neutrons/ns/pulse) for radioactive 
samples, at cost of lower energy resolution. 
 

3 Measurements at the n_TOF facility and their implications 
The experimental program of the n_TOF Collaboration in the field of Nuclear Astrophysics has mostly 
regarded neutron capture cross sections. Since the start of operation, in 2001, a large number of 
capture reactions have been measured, in EAR1, on a variety of subjects, from neutron magic nuclei, 
acting as bottleneck for the reaction flow of the s-process, to branching point isotopes, from light 
nuclei acting as neutron poison, to end-point nuclei, and, finally, to isotopes of special interest, such as 
those involved in the Os/Re nuclear cosmochronometer. In all cases, a considerable reduction of the 
uncertainty on the neutron capture cross section has been obtained, thanks to the peculiar features of 
the n_TOF facilty, in particular the high instantaneous neutron intensity and the high resolution. With 
the construction of the second experimental area, new lines of research have become accessible, in 
particular on reactions leading to light charged particle emission. In the following, a few indicative 
results recently obtained on some of the abovementioned classes of reactions are described more in 
details. 
 

3.1 Neutron capture cross section of branching point isotopes 
The branching points are radioactive isotopes of relatively short half-life for which a competition 
exists between neutron capture and β-decay. The neutron capture cross sections of these isotopes are 



255 
 

poorly known, manly due to the difficulties in producing samples of sufficient mass and adequate 
purity, as well as due in handling and measuring samples of very high activity. For these reasons, 
before 2001 very few measurements existed for these isotopes, at a time-of-flight facility, despite the 
fact that they could provide very important information on the thermodynamical conditions of the 
stellar site in which s-process occurs.  

In the following a description of the most recent measurements carried out in the two experimental 
areas is reported. 

3.1.1 171Tm(n,γ), 147Pm(n,γ) and 204Tl(n,γ) measurements 
The isotopes 171Tm, 147Pm and the 204Tl are important s-process branching points [1]. The unstable 
isotope 171Tm (half-life 1.92 years) represents a branching in the s-process path that is independent of 
stellar temperature and therefore suited to constrain explicitly the s-process neutron density in low 
mass AGB stars. Being Tm a rare earth element, the relative abundances of stable the isotopes are 
known with high accuracy. 

The isotope 204Tl (half life 3.8 years) decays in 204Pb, which produces 205Pb when undergoing neutron 
capture. The fact that both isotopes 204,205Pb are screened from the r-process by the stable isotopes 
204Hg and 205Tl, makes 204Tl particularly interesting, indeed, its capture cross section is of crucial 
importance for understanding the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in AGB stars, but it can also be 
used to provide chronometric information about the time span between the last s-process 
nucleosynthesis events that modified the composition of the proto-solar nebula and the formation of 
solar system solid bodies [4]. 

The 147Pm isotope is a branching point in the mass region A=147-148, that is the Nd-Pm-Sm region. A 
detailed analysis of this branching is important for modeling the AGB star evolution and to put 
accurate constraints on the interplay between metallicity and initial stellar mass, mixing processes or 
hot bottom burning effects [5]. 

All these isotopes are radioactive and with a relatively short half-life.  As a consequence of the natural 
activity of the sample, the measurement of the neutron capture cross section requires a very large 
instantaneous neutron flux. Another big challenge is to find a sufficient amount of material with 
adequate purity. 

The samples were all produced at the Institute Laue Langevin ILL (Grenoble, France) high flux 
reactor, by irradiating for several weeks under the thermal neutron beam the stable progenitors with 
thermal neutrons.

The measurements were performed both in EAR1 and EAR2 with C6D6 liquid scintillator detectors. 
The data analysis is currently in progress [6,7], Fig 2 reports the preliminary results of the 171Tm(n,γ). 
When the analysis will be completed it will provide for the first time experimental information on the 
capture cross section of these isotopes 

3.2 Neutron capture cross section of neutron magic nuclei 
The nuclei with a magic number of neutrons (N=50, 82 and 126), whose nuclear configuration makes 
them particularly stable, have very small cross sections and they act as bottlenecks in the s-process 
path and build up a large abundances. This nuclear feature explains the three peaks in the isotopic solar 
abundance distribution. A precise and accurate knowledge of the neutron capture cross section for 
these isotopes is fundamental for modelling the star evolution. 

3.2.1 88Sr(n,γ), 89Y(n,γ) and 140Ce(n,γ) measurements  
The Solar System abundances of Sr, Y and Zr  are relatively high, forming the first peak in the isotopic 
abundances of the solar system. These elements are mostly synthesized by the s-process in Asymptotic 
Giant Branch (AGB) stars (their production in massive stars is limited to a few per cent of the total 
solar abundance [8]). Their abundances hence define the "ls" (light-s) s-process index routinely used to 
compare theoretical models to observations. The existence of this first peak is due to 88Sr, 89Y, and 
90Zr, all having a magic number of neutrons (N=50), which implies that their neutron-capture cross 
sections are lower than those of neighbouring nuclei. As a result, they act as bottlenecks on the 
neutron-capture path, constraining the value of the total neutron flux necessary to proceed to the 
production of heavier elements up to the second s-process peak, corresponding to the next bottleneck 
at Ba, La, Ce, with neutron magic number of 82 (defining the heavy-s "hs" index).  

The region at N = 50 and N = 82 has been already investigated at n_TOF facility, studying the neutron 
capture cross section of 90Zr(n,γ) [9] and 138La(n,γ) [10], recently the cross section of the 88Sr(n,γ), 
89Y(n,γ) and 140Ce(n,γ) reactions has been measured. The neutron cross sections of  these isotopes do 
not only influence the abundance of neighbouring isotopes, but the whole s-process abundance 
distribution. 

The measurements were performed both in EAR1 with C6D6 liquid scintillator detectors, the new 
results will provide new inputs to accurately model the synthesis of heavier elements. 

3.3 Measurement of (n,cp) reactions  
The very high instantaneous neutron intensity in the second experimental area at n_TOF has also made 
feasible to measure (n, charged particle) reactions of low cross section and/or for isotopes of short-half 
life and/or with samples of extremely small mass. Two isotopes of high relevance in astrophysics 
reactions have been investigated so far at n_TOF: 7Be and 26Al. Neutron-induced reactions on 7Be 
(t1/2=53.2 days) are of interest for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, more specifically for the so-called 
“Cosmological Lithium problem” [2]. Two reactions were measured on this isotope at n_TOF: the 
7Be(n,α)4He and the 7Be(n,p)7Li reactions. Combined with the characteristics of the EAR2 neutron 
beam, the world-class expertise in sample preparation and detector development has led the n_TOF 
collaboration to collect high quality results on both reactions [11-12]. Other successful measurements 
recently performed at n_TOF regard the 26Al(n,p) and 26Al(n,α) reactions [13]. Precise satellite 
observations of this cosmic γ-ray emitter, whose relatively short lifetime (1 My) provides evidence of 
ongoing nucleosynthesis in our galaxy, offer the opportunity to improve calculations of the production 
and destruction rates of some key astrophysical reaction. However, the poor knowledge of the (n, cp) 
reactions on 26Al, responsible for its destruction, are at present the major source of uncertainty in 
predicting the amount of 26Al ejected into the interstellar medium by Wolf-Rayet stars in the stellar 
wind or following the supernova explosion. The challenge in this case is related to the availability of a 
sufficient amount of 26Al, and to the need of identifying the emitted particles. At n_TOF, a sample of 



257 
 

10 µg mass, produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA) [14] was irradiated under the high-
flux neutron beam of the second experimental area, with the reaction product detected in a position-
sensitive solid state telescope. While the analysis is still in progress, preliminary results indicate that 
the n_TOF measurement might provide accurate new data on the important n+26Al reaction cross 
sections. 

4 Conclusions 
Since 2001 the n_TOF facility at CERN has been providing valuable data on neutron capture reactions 
of interest for Nuclear Astrophysics, as well as for energy and medical applications. The unique 
features of high flux and resolution have allowed in many cases to reduce the uncertainties on cross 
sections of various isotopes involved in s-process nucleosynthesis. In particular, high accuracy data 
have been collected on radioactive nuclides around branching points, on bottleneck magic nuclei, or on 
isotopes available only in small amount, of the order of a few milligrams. The construction of a second 
experimental area at a shorter flight path has opened the way to even more challenging measurements 
of (n,γ) and (n,charged particle) reaction on isotopes of short half-life, low cross section and limited 
amounts (possibly down to a few micrograms). All this is expected to lead in the near future to 
exciting new results and significant advancements towards the refinement of models of stellar 
nucleosynthesis.
