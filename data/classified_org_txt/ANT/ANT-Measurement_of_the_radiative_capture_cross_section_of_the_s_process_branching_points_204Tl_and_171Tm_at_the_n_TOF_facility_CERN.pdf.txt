Abstract. The neutron capture cross section of some unstable nuclei is 
especially relevant for s-process nucleosynthesis studies. This magnitude is 
crucial to determine the local abundance pattern, which can yield valuable 
information of the s-process stellar environment. In this work we describe 
the neutron capture (n,γ) measurement on two of these nuclei of interest, 
204Tl and 171Tm, from target production to the final measurement, performed 
successfully at the n_TOF facility at CERN in 2014 and 2015. Preliminary 
results on the ongoing experimental data analysis will also be shown. These 
results include the first ever experimental observation of capture resonances 
for these two nuclei. 

Introduction and motivations 
The nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron in the Universe is mainly produced by a 
series of neutron capture reactions and beta-decays in the so-called slow (s) and rapid (r) 
processes. The main features and basic characteristics of both processes were already well 
sketched in the seminal papers by Burbidge et al. [1] and Cameron [2]. An up to date review 
of the s-process, including the main stellar sites where it takes place, can be found in Käppeler 
et al. [3].The s-process mechanism operates during core He-burning and shell C-burning in 
massive stars of  M>8Msun (also called weak s-process), as well as in H-burning and He-
burning layers of Thermally-Pulsing low-mass stars (1-3 Msun) of the Asymptotic Giant 
Branch (TP-AGBs), in what is known as the main s-process. While the weak s-process is the 
main contributor to the abundances of the elements from Fe to Sr, the main s-process is the 
dominant source for elements of A>90.

Abstract. The neutron capture cross section of some unstable nuclei is 
especially relevant for s-process nucleosynthesis studies. This magnitude is 
crucial to determine the local abundance pattern, which can yield valuable

the neutron capture (n,γ) measurement on two of these nuclei of interest, 
204Tl and 171Tm, from target production to the final measurement, performed 
successfully at the n_TOF facility at CERN in 2014 and 2015. Preliminary

for these two nuclei. 

Introduction and motivations 
The nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron in the Universe is mainly produced by a 
series of neutron capture reactions and beta-decays in the so-called slow (s) and rapid (r) 
processes. The main features and basic characteristics of both processes were already well 
sketched in the seminal papers by Burbidge et al. [1] and Cameron [2]. An up to date review 
of the s-process, including the main stellar sites where it takes place, can be found in Käppeler 
et al. [3].The s-process mechanism operates during core He-burning and shell C-burning in 
massive stars of  M>8Msun (also called weak s-process), as well as in H-burning and He-
burning layers of Thermally-Pulsing low-mass stars (1-3 Msun) of the Asymptotic Giant 
Branch (TP-AGBs), in what is known as the main s-process. While the weak s-process is the 
main contributor to the abundances of the elements from Fe to Sr, the main s-process is the 
dominant source for elements of A>90.  

Any reliable model of the s-process nucleosynthesis aims to reproduce faithfully the solar 
elemental abundances, and for this requires a precise knowledge of the neutron capture cross 
sections and, in some cases also the beta decay rates, of ideally all nuclei involved. Among 
all these nuclei, of particular importance are some nuclides which are radioactive, with half-
lives from years to Gy. This means that during the s-process its decay process competes with 
the neutron capture; since they effectively split the s-process flow, these nuclides are known 
as branching points. The determination of the neutron capture cross section of these nuclei 
is crucial to determine the elemental abundances around the branching point, and also enables 
us to give some constraints on several variables of the s-process stellar environment, such as 
temperature, neutron density or pressure. Their radioactive nature, which is what makes them 
relevant, is also what makes the measurement of the capture cross section especially 
challenging. In this work we describe the first ever capture measurement on two of these 
branching points, 171Tm and 204Tl, including the target preparation, the experimental setup, 
as well as preliminary results for both nuclei. Preliminary results for 203Tl(n,γ), necessary for 
the 204Tl data analysis procedure, are also shown. 

2. Target preparation 

The 204Tl and 171Tm samples were produced by neutron irradiation, at the high neutron flux 
of the nuclear reactor at ILL. Samples of 263 mg of 203Tl2O3, enriched to 99.5%, and 238 mg 
of 170Er2O3, enriched to 98.1% were used as primary materials. These samples had been 
pressed into cylindrical pellets at PSI, and enclosed in quartz ampoules to make them suitable 
for irradiation at ILL. While the Er irradiated seed could be chemically purified and then 
electroplated to produce a 22 mm diameter target containing 3.47 mg of 171Tm, the 204Tl had 
to be left untouched inside the ampoule due to the very high beta activity of the sample, 200 
GBq. By the time of the experiment the sample contained 9 mg of 204Tl (4% relative Tl 
concentration), plus 4 mg (2%) of its daughter 204Pb. An impurity of 370kBq of 60Co was 
also present in the 204Tl sample. Additionally, since the precise shape and spatial distribution 
of the 203-204Tl sample inside the ampoule was uncertain after irradiation, a gamma scanning 
procedure of the sample was performed prior to the capture measurement [4]. 

3. Capture measurement 

Both 171Tm and 204Tl capture measurements were carried out in the Experimental Area 1 
(EAR1) of the n_TOF facility at CERN [5], in the fall of 2014 and summer of 2015, 
respectively. At n_TOF a pulsed neutron beam is produced by spallation of a 20 GeV/c pulsed 
proton beam from the PS impinging on a massive lead target. The energy of the neutrons is 
determined with a high resolution via the time-of-flight technique. A set of 4 C6D6 liquid 
scintillation detectors were used to detect the prompt capture γ-rays. These detectors are 
optimized for a very low sensitivity to the neutrons scattered by the sample. In the case of 
the 204Tl, the high beta activity, together with the high decay energy of these electrons (763 
keV), produced an additional and very intense gamma-ray background due to bremsstrahlung 
in the quartz ampoule. This made it necessary to shield the detectors with a 2 mm thick lead 
foil, which also helped to overcome a few other experimental effects, like possible shifts in 
detector gain observed during the 171Tm campaign (up to 15%) or in the 241Am(n,γ) 
measurement [6].

The counting rate TOF (or neutron-energy equivalent) spectra were transformed, after 
background subtraction, into capture yield by applying the so-called Pulse Height Weighting 
Technique (PHWT) [7]. The gold saturated resonance method [8] was employed for absolute 
yield normalization. For the analysis of the 204Tl measurement the special sample details, 
such as the quartz encapsulation and the uncertain geometry of the activated material 
involved also the additional measurement of a 203Tl2O3 pure sample, nearly identical to the 
one irradiated.  

4. Preliminary results 

The capture yield analysis in the Resolved Resonance Region (RRR) is analysed and 
parameterized using the Bayesian R-matrix analysis code SAMMY [9]. In the case of 171Tm, 
it has been possible to analyse the RRR up to 700 eV, which allowed to extract individual 
resonance parameters for 28 s-wave resonances for the first time ever [10]. 

For the analysis of the 203-204Tl sample (n,γ) yield, the first step was to analyze the 203Tl pure 
sample yield with the highest possible accuracy, in order to reliably account for it in the later 
analysis of the 204Tl(n,γ). In 203Tl(n,γ) more than 70 resonances, from 37 eV up to 26 keV, 
have been identified and analysed with SAMMY. This included the first experimental 
measurement for resonances at a neutron energy lower than 3 keV (fig. 1). These new

resonances have a significant impact in the Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section (MACS) at 
5-8 keV when compared to the commonly accepted MACS in KADoNiS v0.3 [11], which is 
based on the previous measurement [12]. Finally, the analysis of the 204Tl sample is ongoing; 
at the present time, six resonances of 204Tl in the energy range from 122 eV up to 2.2 keV 
have been identified for the first time (fig. 2, right). A few additional candidates are under 
evaluation.
