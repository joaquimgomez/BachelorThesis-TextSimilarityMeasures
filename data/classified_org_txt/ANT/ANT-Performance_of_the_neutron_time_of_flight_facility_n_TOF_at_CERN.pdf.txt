Abstract. The neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF features a white neutron source produced by spallation
through 20GeV/c protons impinging on a lead target. The facility, aiming primarily at the measurement
of neutron-induced reaction cross sections, was operating at CERN between 2001 and 2004, and then
underwent a major upgrade in 2008. This paper presents in detail all the characteristics of the new neutron
beam in the currently available configurations, which correspond to two different collimation systems
and two choices of neutron moderator. The characteristics discussed include the intensity and energy
dependence of the neutron flux, the spatial profile of the beam, the in-beam background components and
the energy resolution/broadening. The discussion of these features is based on dedicated measurements
and Monte Carlo simulations, and includes estimations of the systematic uncertainties of the mentioned
quantities.

1 Introduction and objectives

The accurate knowledge of a wide variety of nuclear data
is essential for the understanding of many of the processes
occurring in nature and also playing a key role in nuclear
technologies. In particular, neutron-induced reactions are
the driving force behind the nucleosynthesis of elements
beyond iron in stars (via the s- and r-processes) [1],
the functioning of present nuclear reactors [2,3] as well
as the future ones aiming at minimizing nuclear waste
(Generation-IV) [4] or reducing it (ADS) [5], the damage
caused in the structural material of future fusion reac-
tors [6], etc. In all these fields, the cross sections of a large
number of neutron-induced reactions are the main ingre-
dient in the associated calculations.

The cross sections available in different nuclear li-
braries (for instance, JEFF, ENDF, JENDL [7] for nuclear
technologies and KADoNiS [8] for astrophysics) are de-
rived from evaluations based on both experimental data
and theoretical predictions from nuclear models. Never-
theless, the cross sections given in different evaluations
are frequently incompatible and their accuracy is lower
than needed. This makes it necessary to perform new and
more accurate measurements of many isotopes and reac-
tions, which are summarized for instance by the Nuclear
Energy Agency in its High Priority Request List [9], but
also in review papers on data needs for fusion [10] and
astrophysics [1].

The neutron energy ranges of interest span from ther-
mal (25meV) to hundreds of MeV, depending on the
application. In such a wide energy range the neutron
cross sections have resonant structures and abrupt reac-
tion thresholds which change significantly from isotope to
isotope and cannot be predicted, thus requiring high en-
ergy resolution measurements to resolve such structures.
This is preferably done by using the Time-of-Flight (ToF)
technique in which a pulsed neutron beam, spanning over
a wide range of energies, travels a given distance before
reaching the sample under study. In this technique the ki-
netic energy of the neutrons is determined from their time
of arrival at the measuring station. The kinetic energy En

of neutrons with a speed v = L/t can be expressed as

En = E−mc2 =
√

c2p2 + m2c4−mc2 = mc2(γ−1), (1)

where γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2, and c is the speed of light.
The first term of the series expansion gives the classical
expression for the neutron kinetic energy, which shall be
used below a few MeV,

En =

mv2 = α2

Taking, for instance, the value of the speed of light c =
299.8m/μs and m = 939.6MeV/c2 for the neutron mass,
one obtains α = 72.29

and therefore the capability for resolving the resonance
structures in the cross sections is favored by the use of
long flight paths (large L and t) and the production of
all neutrons within the shortest possible time (Δt) and
smallest possible space (ΔL).

At present there are several neutron ToF facilities in
the world devoted to the measurement of neutron-induced
reactions cross sections. These use different methods for
neutron production and have flight path lengths ranging
between less than one meter to 400m. Among these, the
most active in the recent years are (flight paths are given
in parenthesis) the n TOF facility [11–14] (185m) dis-
cussed further in this paper, GELINA at JRC-IRMM in
Belgium [15] (10, 30, 50, 60, 100, 200, 300 and 400m),
DANCE at LANSCE in the USA [16] (20m) and AN-
NRI at J-PARK in Japan [17] (22 and 28m). In addition,
two new facilities will soon become operational in Europe:
n TOF-EAR2 at CERN in Switzerland [18] (20m) and
FRANZ in Germany [19] (0.8m).

The n TOF facility became operational at CERN
(Geneva, Switzerland) in 2001 and has since then become
a major facility in the field of neutron cross section mea-
surements. In addition, measurements aimed at the study
of nuclear structure and the mechanism of fission reactions
are part of the experimental program. The facility ran be-
tween 2001 and 2004 (n TOF-Phase1) and, after a four-
year halt and a complete upgrade of the neutron produc-
tion target, it resumed operation at the end of 2008 (start
of n TOF-Phase2). Since then, many measurements have
been performed [20], starting with a series for the commis-
sioning and characterization of the neutron beam, which
are discussed in this paper. Everything in this manuscript
refers to the n TOF facility after the 2008 upgrade, ex-
cept when is explicitly specified that something refers to
the previous configuration n TOF-Phase1 (2001–2004).

The knowledge of every parameter describing the neu-
tron beam is essential for the accurate analysis of experi-
mental data. To this aim, an extensive measurement cam-
paign was undertaken in order to determine these parame-
ters. A significant part of the work presented herein deals
with the estimation of the uncertainties of each of the
beam parameters and their effect when propagated to the
different types of measurements. A brief description of the
facility is given in sect. 2, which is followed by a discus-
sion of the Monte Carlo simulations of its performance
in sect. 3. The characteristics of the beam discussed in
this paper are the flux and its neutron energy dependence
(sect. 4), the distribution of the neutron beam in space
(sect. 5) and time (sect. 6), and the in-beam background
components (sect. 7).

2 Description of the CERN n TOF facility

A detailed technical description of the n TOF facility will
be given in a dedicated paper (ref. [14]), thus only a brief
summary is given in this paper.

The n TOF facility is part of the fixed target experi-
mental program at the CERN accelerator complex [21],
as sketched in fig. 1. At n TOF, a high-intensity neu-
tron pulse is produced every 1.2 seconds (or multiples
of this interval) from spallation reactions induced by a
pulse of 7 × 1012 protons of 20GeV/c momentum im-
pinging on a 1.3 tonne cylindrical lead target 40 cm in
length and 60 cm in diameter, which is illustrated in fig. 2.
A 1 cm water layer cools the target and, together with
a subsequent layer of 4 cm of water or borated water
(H2O + 1.28%H3BO3, fraction in mass), moderates the
initially fast neutrons into the desired energy spectrum,
which ranges down to thermal energies. This separation
of the cooling/moderation circuit in two regions is one of
the main differences and advantages (see sect. 7.1) with
respect to the previous configuration (2001–2004) where
a sole water layer of 5.7 cm was used both as coolant and
neutron moderator.

The experimental area begins at 182.3m from the spal-
lation target and has a length of 7.9m. Along the evac-
uated beam line, sketched in fig. 3, a sweeping magnet
(200 cm long, 44 cm gap and 3.6Tm field) deflects the

Fig. 1. Layout of the n TOF facility within the CERN accel-
erator complex [21]. The LINAC feeds the PS-Booster, which
provides the PS with protons of 1.4 GeV/c for acceleration up
to 20 GeV/c. This beam is extracted and sent to the n TOF
lead spallation target in bunches of 7×1012 protons. The exper-
imental hall is located near the end of the 200 m long neutron
beam line.

rated water) layers is realized by a thin alumunium window.

charged particles in the beam and two collimators shape
the neutron beam. The diameter of the second collimator,
placed at 178m from the spallation target, can be chosen
between 18mm (capture mode with 235 cm of steel plus
50 cm of borated polyethylene) and 80mm (fission mode
with 50 cm of borated polyethylene plus 125 cm of steel
plus 75 cm of borated polyethylene) to accommodate the
needs of each measurement.

Several detection systems are available to study dif-
ferent types of reactions. Liquid (C6D6 [22]) and solid
(BaF2 [23]) scintillators are used to measure the γ-rays
following (n,γ) reactions, while gas (MicroMegas [24,25])
and solid-state (silicon [26] and diamond [27]) detectors
are employed for (n,charged-particle) reaction measure-
ments. Lastly, fission reactions are measured with gas de-
tectors (MicroMegas [24,25] and PPAC [28]). The combi-
nation of these detection systems with a fully digital Data

Acquisition System [29] has enabled the accurate measure-
ment of a large number of cross sections (the complete list
of published results can be found on the n TOF website
www.cern.ch/nTOF) and several key technical contribu-
tions [22,30–32] to this field of research in the last decade.

3 Monte Carlo simulation of the facility

Monte Carlo simulations are used for determining the
characteristics of the neutron beam. In particular, once
they are validated with experimental data, simulations
give access to information that cannot be measured with
the required accuracy (experiments always have limi-
tations in terms of statistics and sizeable backgrounds
are sometimes unavoidable) or is simply not accessible
through experiments (see, for instance, the discussion on
the resolution function in sect. 6).

This section deals with the technical details of the sim-
ulations, while the results and their comparison with ex-
perimental data are discussed throughout the correspond-
ing sections later in this paper.

3.1 FLUKA and MCNP simulations

Since the start-up of the n TOF facility in 2001, the geom-
etry of the facility has been implemented in FLUKA [33,
34] in considerable detail. However, for neutronics calcu-
lations only the region around the spallation target illus-
trated in fig. 4 is important, since the surrounding struc-
tures are only important for estimating the activation of
materials, residual dose, etc. The changes made during the
upgrade period (2004-2008), particularly the new spalla-
tion target assembly, are included in the simulated geome-
try, which was also exported to MCNP [35] using the built-
in feature in FLAIR [36], the FLUKA Graphical User In-
terface.

The choice of using both FLUKA (version 2011) and
MCNP (MCNPX version 2.6) was made in order to take
advantage of each code’s strong points in a study where
a variety of particle interactions, spanning at least 12
orders of magnitude in energy, are followed. In particu-
lar, FLUKA boasts very accurate and well-benchmarked
high-energy hadron interaction models, appropriate for
simulating the proton beam interaction with the spalla-
tion target. Nevertheless, the transport of neutrons below

FLUKA and MCNP simulations (partial view).

20MeV (and down to the lowest threshold of 0.01meV)
is performed by a multi-group algorithm and an associ-
ated grouped cross section library containing over 250 ma-
terials. The above-mentioned energy range is subdivided
into 260 groups of approximately equal logarithmic width
where inelastic reactions are not simulated explicitly, but
treated as transfer probabilities between energy groups,
forming a so-called downscattering matrix. While this ap-
proach is generally reliable and very CPU-efficient, it can
lead to unphysical artifacts when studying thin and/or
low density objects or when the resonance structure of the
studied material is relevant to the problem (e.g. in shield-
ing applications). This implies a limitation, for instance, in
extracting accurate information on the resonance absorp-
tion dips present in the n TOF neutron energy spectrum.
It is in this context that MCNP becomes useful, since it
employs point-wise neutron cross sections down to ther-
mal energies.

3.2 Neutron production: geometry and scoring

The geometry was carefully built based on technical doc-
umentation of the n TOF facility (spallation target, vac-
uum windows, . . . ) and civil engineering layouts of the
environment (tunnels, target area, . . . ). Furthermore, the



Eur. Phys. J. A (2013) 49: 27 Page 5 of 15

composition of the materials and especially of the alu-
munium alloys which constitute the various windows and
beam-line components were defined in the best possible
detail taking into account the available specifications and
their chemical and isotopic composition. The goal of the
simulations was to follow the proton beam interaction
with the lead spallation target, and to track all particles
produced, up to a scoring plane corresponding to the en-
trance of the neutron beam line vacuum tube. In particu-
lar, the neutron or γ-ray position, direction, energy, weight
and time of arrival (defined as the time between the pri-
mary proton hitting the target and the secondary particles
reaching the scoring plane) were recorded for their subse-
quent transport through the beam line. Particles entering
the vacuum tube at an angle greater than 10◦ relative to
the beam-line axis were immediately discarded as they can
never reach the experimental area. All this information
was later used to study the neutron propagation towards
the experimental area, as described in sect. 3.3.

3.3 Neutron transport along the beam line

A full simulation of the neutrons travelling along the
beam-line up to the experimental area would be impracti-
cal since the solid angle subtended by the second collima-
tor is less than 10−8 sr. Such calculations would therefore
require an unaffordable long CPU time.

To address this issue, an independent external code
was developed which uses the information obtained from
the simulations to carry out the propagation of the neu-
trons or γ-rays to the experimental area a posteriori. To
this aim, a variance reduction algorithm was implemented.
The latter assumes that within a sufficiently small an-
gle θcut (relative to the beam axis) neutrons are emitted
isotropically throughout the full energy range. In general,
this is not true: high-energy neutron emission is (strongly)
forward-peaked, while the angular distribution of thermal
neutrons is largely isotropic. Nevertheless, the assumption
holds within a small forward angle (θcut = 5◦), and thus
a conservative value of θcut = 3◦ was used for these calcu-
lations.

The first step is to project each neutron trajectory
and determine its hitting point at a distance L corre-
sponding to the experimental area (without accounting
for any collimation) and discard all those that arrive out-
side a circle of radius L × tan θcut + 0.4m, (e.g. 183m
× tan 3◦ + 0.4m = 10.0m), where the 0.4m radius of the
vacuum tube after the lead target (i.e. the neutron scor-
ing plane) is included to account for the beam halo. The
remaining neutrons are the ones assumed to be emitted
isotropically. Subsequently, a scoring surface in the exper-
imental area is selected, defined by its position along the
line (e.g. 183m) and its radius (e.g. 2 cm). This surface is
meant to represent a sample or detector. A scoring grid
(1mm step) is defined on this surface and, for each neu-
tron, a trajectory is calculated to each point on this grid
starting from its initial position at the beginning of the
vacuum tube. For each instance of the neutron (i.e. for

each calculated trajectory) the program checks if the tra-
jectory hits either a tube or collimator (see fig. 3). If so,
this neutron is considered not to reach the experimental
area and is thus rejected. In the opposite case, it is scored.
The final result is appropriately normalized to provide the
neutron flux and the spatial beam profile at the scoring
surface in the experimental area.

In calculating the neutron trajectories, the program
was designed to account for the effect of gravity. While
fast neutrons are practically unaffected over a ∼ 185m
flight path, the effect is visible for thermal neutrons (3 cm
vertical drop along 185m) and has a measurable impact
on the spatial profile of low energy neutrons (more details
are given in sect. 5).

4 Neutron flux

The neutron flux is here defined as the number of neu-
trons per incident proton pulse and integrated over the
full spatial beam profile arriving at the experimental hall
with a given energy. Its absolute value and energy distri-
bution as well as the associated uncertainties are essential
for the analysis of cross section data obtained via the time-
of-flight technique. The accuracy with which the neutron
flux is determined may indeed become the limiting factor
in the accuracy achievable in a cross section experiment
and therefore must be improved as much as possible. The
knowledge of the dependence of the neutron flux on en-
ergy is similarly important as knowing its absolute value
because reaction cross sections are usually measured rel-
ative to some well known quantity in a particular energy
range, e.g. a standard cross section, the cross section value
at thermal energies, or the capture yield at the top of a
well isolated saturated resonance [37].

In the case of n TOF, we have experimentally de-
termined the neutron flux using several detection sys-
tems based on different principles and reactions. These
are included in the analysis only in the energy region
where the associated cross sections are well-established
standards [38]. The measurements, their analysis and
their combination for the determination of the evaluated
neutron flux are discussed in the following sections. A
manuscript with even further details about each measure-
ment and the neutron flux evaluation process is currently
under preparation [39].

4.1 Methodology and measurements

The determination of the neutron flux is based on the re-
lation between the measured reaction yield Y measx and the
expected (theoretical) value Y thx calculated from the corre-
sponding standard cross section. The former is calculated
from measurable quantities as

Y measx (En) =
C(En) − B(En)
εx(En) × Φn(En)

, (4)

where C and B are the total and background counts per
neutron pulse, εx is the detection efficiency for the re-



Page 6 of 15 Eur. Phys. J. A (2013) 49: 27

action of interest, and Φn is the neutron flux to be de-
termined. All these observables, as explicitly indicated in
eq. (4), are neutron energy dependent. The expected yield
is calculated, to a first approximation (without consider-
ing multiple scattering), from the characteristics of the
sample used in the measurement and the associated cross
section as

Y thx (En) =
(
1 − e−nσt(En)

) σx(En)
σt(En)

, (5)

where n is the areal density of the sample in atoms-per-
barn and σt and σx are the total and reaction cross sec-
tions expressed in barns, respectively. When the sample is
sufficiently thin, the self-shielding becomes negligible and
thus a combination of the two previous equations allows
calculating the neutron flux as

Φn(En) =
C(En) − B(En)

εx(En) × n × σx(En)
. (6)

We have determined the neutron flux of n TOF apply-
ing this methodology to several dedicated measurements.
By combining these independent measurements in a con-
sistent way, it was possible to determine the neutron flux
between thermal and 1GeV with rather small systematic
and statistical uncertainties. The detectors for charged
particles SiMon [26] and MGAS [24,25] have been used for
measuring (n,α) reactions on thin 6Li and 10B foils, which
feature standard cross sections from 25meV to 1MeV. In
addition, the detectors H19 from PTB [40], MGAS [24,25]
and PPAC [28] have all been used to measure 235U(n,f)
reactions, whose cross section is standard at 25meV and
in the interval between 150 keV and 200MeV. This reac-
tion has also been used as reference above 200MeV, due
to the absence of any standard cross section at such high
energies.

As an illustrative example of the responses of the de-
tectors to the mentioned reactions, fig. 5 shows some pulse
height distributions in the neutron energy range between
0.1 and 10 eV. The labels indicate the origin of the struc-
tures that are observed in each case and the dashed verti-
cal lines indicate the analysis gates selected for the identi-
fication of the reaction products of interest. These gates,
shown here only in the eV region, are neutron energy de-
pendent and have been determined carefully for the anal-
ysis of the flux in the complete neutron energy range.

As mentioned previously, all the measurements per-
formed to determine the neutron flux are based on re-
actions whose cross sections are standards in particular
energy regions [38], as summarized in table 1. The ta-
ble presents also the energy regions where each detector
provides reliable data. For instance, the uncertainties in
the angular distribution of the reaction products from
the 6Li(n,α) reaction limit the use of the SiMon detec-
tor to energies below ∼ 150 keV, while the effects of the
γ-flash (see sect. 7.2) limits the use of the H19(PTB) and
MGAS(235U) fission chambers beyond ∼ 3 and ∼ 10MeV,
respectively. In the case of MGAS(10B), the background
caused by proton recoils from elastic n-p collisions in the
gas limits the high energy range up to only few hundreds
of keV.

the detectors (and covering the three reaction types of inter-
est) involved in the experimental determination of the n TOF
neutron flux.

Taking these energy limits into account, the neutron
flux has been derived from eq. (6) as described in the
following section.

4.2 Evaluated neutron flux

To evaluate the neutron flux, the results from each indi-
vidual measurement have been combined and the overall
uncertainty has been estimated consistently. Taking into
consideration that the efficiency of the H19 fission detec-
tor from PTB and the mass of the corresponding samples
are the best known quantities (see ref. [40]), the fluxes
measured with the other detectors have been normalized
to the PTB detector at 25meV, where all the measured
reactions have standard cross sections. The evaluated neu-
tron flux has then been obtained as a weighted average of
the individual fluxes, including in each energy range only
those whose associated cross section is standard and con-
sidering the reliable energy intervals mentioned in table 1.

The results are displayed with a 100 bins per decade
in the upper panel of fig. 6, where the wide range of neu-
tron energies provided by the n TOF neutron beam is
clearly visible. The two fluxes displayed correspond to the
capture collimator mode in the configurations with water
and borated water as moderators. In all cases the MeV

with the intermediate region containing the partially mod-

ing to thermalized neutrons, changing significantly when
borated water is used instead of normal water due the
higher neutron absorption probability through 10B(n,α)
than through 1H(n,γ) reactions. This also leads to a re-
duction of the intensity and energy of the in-beam γ-ray
background, as discussed in sect. 7.1. The region between
20 keV and 1MeV features a series of dips, which are
transmission dips associated to resonances in the alumu-
nium windows of the spallation target assembly and at
both ends of the evacuated flight path. These resonance
dips have a sizable effect when measuring the cross sec-
tion of isotopes with resonances at such high energies, but

The number of neutrons per pulse (corresponding to
7×1012 protons) integrated over energy decades are given
for each collimator and moderator configurations in ta-
ble 2. The total number of neutrons per pulse varies be-
tween 5.5 × 105 and 12 × 106, depending on the collima-
tor/moderator configuration.

Regarding the statistical and systematic uncertainties
in the neutron flux, displayed in the botton panel of fig. 6,
the former has been calculated through standard uncer-
tainty propagation and the latter has been estimated as
the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the values that are in-
cluded in the averaging at each neutron energy bin. In
this way, the lower limit for the systematic uncertainty is
given by the statistical one. Indeed, it is observed that the
systematic uncertainty is larger than the statistical only

near the large alumunium dip around 20–30 keV. Over-
all, the neutron flux with 100 bins per decade has been
determined within 1% uncertainty between thermal and
100 eV, 2% between 100 eV and 10 keV, 3–4% between
10 keV and 1MeV, and 2–3% between 1 and 200MeV.
Above 200MeV the 235U(n,f) cross section is not stan-
dard and therefore we can only report the statistical uncer-
tainty of our flux, which varies between 3 and 4%. These
uncertainty values constrain the maximum accuracy that
can be reached in absolute cross section measurements at
n TOF; however, the results from both fission and cap-
ture cross section measurements can reach higher accura-
cies if performed relative to standard cross sections such
as 197Au(n,γ) or 235U(n,f).

4.3 Consequences of a high instantaneous flux

Many of the measurements carried out at n TOF are made
on radioactive samples such as actinides (233U, 240,242Pu,
241,243Am, 245Cm, . . . ), fission products (93Zr, 151Sm, . . . )
and others (59Ni, 63Ni, . . . ). In these cases, the activity
of the sample itself often becomes the dominant source
of background. At n TOF, due to the very high instan-
taneous intensity of each neutron pulse, the contribution
of the sample-activity background to the measurement is
largely reduced with respect to other facilities.

As an example fig. 7 shows the counting rate recorded
with a pair C6D6 scintillators in the (n,γ) measurement of
a 32mg 241Am sample [41,42]. The activity of this sample
was 4GBq, and even with such a high activity the mea-
surement could be carried out at n TOF with a favorable
capture-to-background ratio in the complete energy range.
The example also serves to illustrate the wide neutron en-
ergy range, between thermal and 1MeV, fully covered in
each pulse at n TOF thanks to its uniquely short duty
cycle.

tion as measured with the pixel-MGAS detector at low neutron
energy (0.1–1 eV).

5 Spatial beam profile

The spatial profile of the neutron beam at the sample po-
sition is mainly shaped by the characteristics of the second
collimator. The two collimation modes available at n TOF
(see sect. 2) obviously provide neutron beams of different
size. Furthermore, the beam profile varies with the energy
of the neutrons because neutrons of different energies are
produced at different positions and emitted at different
angles from the spallation target and thus follow differ-
ent paths during their moderation in the target and the
cooling/moderator system. The knowledge of this spatial
profile is essential for the accurate measurement of cross
sections and is of particular importance when the sam-
ple being measured is smaller than the neutron beam and
therefore intercepts only a fraction of it, referred to as the
Beam Interception Factor (BIF).

The spatial profile of the neutron beam and its energy
dependence in the capture collimator configuration were
already investigated in detail in n TOF-Phase1 by means
of a 1D-stripped MicroMegas detector (see ref. [43] for de-
tails). The results were found to be in agreement with sim-
ulations available at the time. In the present n TOF con-
figuration, a new 2D pixelated MicroMegas (pixel-MGAS)
detector has been developed [44]. This new detector, with
a 5 cm diameter active area including 308 square pixels of
2.5mm side read out by 4 Gassiplex cards, has provided
in 2012 results compatible with those measured in 2001
with the stripped-MGAS detector.

An illustration of the n TOF beam profile at 183.2m
flight path is given in fig. 8, where the beam projection
in the vertical direction for neutron energies between 0.1
and 1 eV is shown for both capture and fission collima-
tor modes. The capture mode includes both the measure-
ment with the pixel-MGAS and simulations (see sect. 3.1),
which are in good agreement except in the tails of the dis-



Eur. Phys. J. A (2013) 49: 27 Page 9 of 15

tribution, where the measured data are affected by back-
ground. In the fission mode, only the simulations are avail-
able. It is observed that the full size of the beam is ∼3.5 cm
and ∼10 cm in diameter in the capture and fission colli-
mation modes, respectively.

5.1 Beam interception factor

The value of the BIF at 183.2m flight path using the cap-
ture collimator has been calculated from the validated
simulations for typical sample diameters of 1, 2, 3 and
4 cm, always considering samples that are perfectly aligned
with the beam line.

The results are shown in fig. 9, where the BIF values
in the eV region are 0.21, 0.68, 0.96 and 1.0 for samples
with diameters of 1, 2, 3 and 4 cm, respectively. Figure 9
clearly shows the slight variation of the BIF with neutron
energy which needs to be accounted for when the cross
section measurements are normalized in a particular neu-
tron energy region. The difference between the BIF value
at 4.9 eV (which is the usual normalization point for cap-
ture experiments at n TOF via the saturated resonance
method [37] with 197Au) and the values at thermal and at
300 keV reaches 2.5% for samples of only 1 cm diameter,
and is less than 1.5% for samples with a diameter larger
than 2 cm. The figure also includes 4 lines around the BIF
values for 2 cm diameter that correspond to the values for
a sample misaligned by 1mm upwards, downwards, left
and right. These results show that an accurate sample
aligment is crucial, since a misaligment of just 1mm can
lead to a deviation of several percentage points with re-
spect to the BIF value at the nominal sample position.

Fig. 9. Simulated beam interception factor BIF (at 183.2 m
flight path) as a function of neutron energy for circular samples
1 to 4 cm in diameter. The four thin lines around the 2 cm
diameter values correspond to sample misalignments of ±1 mm
horizontally and vertically.

The effect is indeed larger in the case of a vertical mis-
alignment, which is explained by the effect of gravitation
on thermal neutrons, since it takes them more than 100
ms to reach the experimental area.

Overall, it can be concluded that the variation of the
BIF with neutron energy must be considered in data anal-
ysis when measuring samples smaller than the beam, con-
sidering as well that any possible misalignments of the
sample could imply an uncertainty on the neutron energy
dependence of the BIF, and thus in the corresponding
measured cross section, which can reach a maximum of
2.5% at thermal energies for samples with a diameter of
only 1 cm.

6 Resolution function and ToF/En relation

The resolution function describes the distribution of the
measured time of flight for neutrons with a given kinetic
energy. Several experimental conditions like the primary
beam pulse duration (7 ns RMS in the case of n TOF), the
moderation time in the target-moderator assembly, and
the detector response, contribute to the fact that the time
of flight t and the flight length L for a neutron of energy
En in eq. (2) are not fixed values but merely distribu-
tions. The convolution of these distributions is known as
the resolution function RE(En) for a given incident neu-
tron energy and can be easily transformed in equivalent
distributions in either energy, time, or distance by using
the conservation of probability

RE(En)dEn = Rt(t)dt = RL(L)dL, (7)

where En, L and t are related to each other through
eq. (2). Since the energy dependence of the equivalent dis-
tance RL(L) is weaker than Rt(t) and RE(E), this form
is often used to represent resolution functions graphically.
Although the resolution function cannot be measured di-
rectly, it is assessed either by an analytical approach of
its components or, more commonly, by Monte Carlo sim-
ulations. The resolution function can then be validated by
measurements of well-known resonances.

The resolution function is usually non-Gaussian and
even asymmetric which does not only alter the shape of
resolved resonances, but also changes the time-energy cal-
ibration with energy, as a consequence of a shift in the
observed resonance peak position. For resolved resonances
analyzed with R-matrix codes like SAMMY [45] or RE-
FIT [46], a parametrization of the resolution function or
a numerical representation is used to fit the resonance
shape and its position. The combination of an arbitrary
geometrical flight length L and the also arbitrary center
of the resolution function results in the time-energy cali-
bration. Usually, but not necessarily, the resolution func-
tion starts at zero equivalent distance, and the geometrical
flight length is calibrated accordingly with a well-known
low-energy resonance.

For reaction yields at higher energies where no resolved
resonances are present, the conversion of time to energy
with eq. (2) uses the effective flight length Leff which

and a mean moderation length

LRL(L)dL. In some ap-

proximations, where the mean value (λ) follows a simple
parametrized energy dependence, it is possible to simplify
the time-energy calibration as explained in [31].

6.1 The n TOF resolution function

The resolution function of the n TOF facility has been
simulated in the start-up phase by two different codes,
FLUKA [13] and CAMOT [47], giving similar results
within the available statistics. In the second phase of
n TOF, the new spallation target assembly has been simu-
lated again with FLUKA and also with MCNP for the two
moderator configurations. These three resolution func-
tions are displayed in fig. 10 in the form of moderation
length at different neutron energies. The first panel shows
the large differences between the various configurations
for slow neutrons. However, at such low neutron energies
Doppler broadening dominates over the resolution broad-
ening (see discussion in sect. 6.2) and is thus not impor-
tant. At higher energies, in the keV region, there are essen-
tially no differences between the two configurations (use or
not of borated water as moderator) of n TOF-Phase2, but
there are sizable differences with respect to Phase1. The
increase in the width of the resolution at energies above
1 keV is associated with the presence of additional alumu-
nium windows (to separate the cooling and moderator cir-
cuits) and the air gap existing in n TOF-Phase2 between
the spallation target and the evacuated beam line.

In n TOF-Phase1, the simulated resolution function
results were used to derive an analytical description in
the range from 1 eV to 1MeV [48] given by

where Λ, τ , A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 are energy-
dependent parameters. This form of the resolution func-
tion is known as the modified RPI function and is present
in the codes SAMMY [45] and REFIT [46] for reso-
nance analysis. This analytical function describes rea-
sonably well the n TOF-Phase1 simulations made with
CAMOT and FLUKA. However, a numerical description
of the n TOF resolution broadening has been made avail-
able in both SAMMY and REFIT codes. This allows
for a more accurate description of the overall broadening
and provides more flexibility at the stage of data analy-
sis.

The values of the resolution function broadening for
the configuration with water as moderator, in the form of
widths at one half (FWHM) and at one tenth (FWTM)
of the maximum value, are given in table 3. The FWHM
varies between 3 and 50 cm, yielding a relative energy res-
olution that ranges between a minimum of 0.03% below
10 eV and a maximum of 0.5% around 1MeV. The mean
value of the resolution function expressed as equivalent

moderation length is displayed in fig. 11. As mentioned be-
fore, this is understood as an effective moderation length
which must thus be added to the geometrical time-of-
flight distance to use the time-to-energy conversion given
in eq. (2), that is Leff = Lgeom + λ(En) (see ref. [31]).

6.2 Effect of the resolution function in the resonance
shapes

The high resolution of the n TOF neutron beam makes
it possible to observe resonances up to tens and hundreds
of keV. An example is displayed in fig. 12, which shows a
resonance from 56Fe measured near 80 keV. The calculated
Doppler broadened resonance shape is shown as reference
to illustrate the effect of the resolution broadening. This is
indeed sizable, but still allows to accurately determine the
strength of the measured resonances from their integrals,
which remain unchanged by the broadening.

To further illustrate the impact of the resolution func-
tion, a number of relative widths are displayed in fig. 13
for the case of 232Th (figure from ref. [48]). They all
correspond to the relative width at one half maximum
(FWHM/E), except for the resonance spacing where
D0/E is displayed. In the figure, the overall resonance
broadening is displayed as a thick (brown) solid line, while
the individual components (Doppler, resolution function
and proton pulse width) are displayed as dashed lines.
The overall broadening is to be compared with the intrin-
sic width (blue points) and resonance spacing (pink solid
line) of the 232Th resonances from the evaluated library
JEFF-3.1.2 [49]. The comparison shows that the observed
width for all the resonances will be dominated by the ex-
perimental broadening, but also that the broadening re-
mains lower than the resonance spacing up to ∼ 20 keV
and thus neighboring resonances will be well differentiated
below that energy limit.

7 Background conditions

7.1 In-beam γ-ray background

The spallation process as well as the absorption of neu-
trons in the moderator are responsible for a sizable pro-
duction of γ-rays, a fraction of which reaches the experi-
mental hall. Knowing the energy distribution and time of
flight of these photons is essential for understanding the
effects of the γ-ray backgrounds, where a prompt and a
delayed component can be distinguished.

Applying the same methodology described earlier for
the Monte Carlo study of the neutron flux, it has been
possible to obtain the information on the photon flux as
well. The corresponding time-of-flight distributions of the
photons arriving in the experimental hall are displayed in
fig. 14. The existence of a prompt (ToF < 1μs) compo-
nent arising from high-energy interactions in the target
and a delayed (ToF > 1μs) component comprising mostly
capture γ-rays from the cooling and moderator system,
as well as from structural material around the spallation
target, are clearly observed. The energy distribution of
the γ-rays of these two components, displayed in fig. 15,
illustrates the very different nature of the prompt and de-
layed γ-ray background. While the much larger prompt
component reaches energies as high as severalGeV and

Fig. 16. Neutron energy distribution of events from the irra-
diation of a lead sample in the two moderator configurations:
water and borated water. The majority of events correspond
to in-beam γ-rays scattered at the sample and detected in the
C6D6. The large difference above 100 eV illustrates the signif-
icant reduction of the 2.2 MeV γ-ray component from 1H(n,γ)
reactions in the moderator.

does not depend on the type of moderator used, the de-
layed component has well-defined peaks corresponding to
photons emitted in specific neutron absorption reactions
in different materials. For instance, the peaks at 7.7MeV,
2.2MeV, 511 keV and 478 keV correspond to 27Al(n,γ),
1H(n,γ), pair annihilation and 10B(n,α)7Li∗ reactions, re-
spectively.

The reduction of the 2.2MeV γ-ray background by
nearly one order of magnitude when using borated wa-
ter as moderator is one of the main advantages of the new
spallation target upgraded in 2008. In the past this back-
ground was a limiting factor in the sensitivity of some of
the measurements carried out before 2004, as discussed in
refs. [50,51]. Now the situation has largely improved, as
illustrated in fig. 16, which shows the counting rate dis-
tributions from a measurement of a lead sample (which
mainly scatters γ-rays and absorbs a negligible fraction
of neutrons) in the two moderator configurations using, in
both cases, a similar set-up based on a pair of C6D6 detec-
tors. The in-beam γ-ray background has been reduced by
a factor of 7. Actually, the in-beam γ-ray background has
not been eliminated but shifted from 2.2MeV to 478 keV
(see fig. 15), which is much less harmful because the cor-
responding energy deposition in the detectors, after un-
dergoing one compton scattering in the sample, is most of
the times below the detection threshold.

7.2 The γ-flash

The term γ-flash is commonly used to describe the prompt
component of ionizing particles (γ-rays and others) arriv-
ing at the experimental area with the neutron beam. How-
ever, the term is somewhat misleading because the γ-flash

has in fact several components, all of them observed as
prompt (i.e. ToF < 1μs): a) charged particles produced
in the spallation target, b) photons (see figs. 14 and 15)
produced in the spallation target, and c) a halo of photons
and charged particles produced by the interaction of the
high energy neutrons and photons with the second col-
limator placed just upstream from the experimental hall
(see fig. 3).

All these components affect each of the detectors used
at n TOF differently, depending on the detector type
and its location with respect to the beam. The situa-
tion is illustrated in fig. 17 for four different detection

systems (PPAC [28], MGAS [24,25], C6D6 [22] and BaF2
TAC [23]), for which some useful signals following the γ-
flash and their corresponding neutron energies are also
shown. In the case of PPAC and MGAS, placed in the
beam, there is always a sizable deposition of energy with
the arrival of the beam which prevents one from detect-
ing another signal until the baseline is recovered, which
happens around 100 ns and 1μs after the beam arrival,
respectively. This means that the PPAC can record fis-
sion reactions for neutron energies as high as several hun-
dreds of MeV (1GeV has been reported in [28]) while the
MGAS operates properly below 100MeV. In the case of
the C6D6 and BaF2 scintillators, both placed outside the
beam, the response of each detector is very different, with
the baselines recovering approximately 3 and 40μs after
the arrival of the beam, respectively. These correspond to
respective high energy limits of 10MeV and 10–100 keV.
When the effect of the γ-flash needs to be reduced in order
to push measurements to higher neutron energies, one can
do so by reducing the intensity of the neutron beam on
demand, see, for instance, ref. [52].

8 Summary and conclusions

The n TOF facility at CERN provides a high-intensity
pulsed neutron beam spanning over eleven orders of mag-
nitude in neutron energy (thermal to 1GeV) with a time-
of-flight distance of 185 meters. The facility, devoted
mainly to neutron-induced cross section measurements
and operating since 2001, has been upgraded in 2008 and
presently features an optimized spallation target and cool-
ing and moderation systems.

In this paper we have presented in detail the char-
acteristics of the neutron beam and the associated back-
grounds, which are essential for the planning and analysis
of measurements at n TOF. The results presented herein
are based on measurements as well as on FLUKA and
MCNP simulations, and deal with the intensity and en-
ergy distribution of the neutron flux, the spatial profile of
the neutron beam, the associated energy resolution and
the beam related backgrounds. Several of these character-
istics depend on the type of moderator and/or collimator
used, and therefore all these cases have been discussed sep-
arately. Special attention has been given to estimate the
systematic uncertainties of all these parameters, which are
later propagated to estimate the overall uncertainty in the
measurements performed at this facility.

Overall, the n TOF facility provides a very high in-
stantaneous intensity (0.5–12×106 neutrons/pulse) beam
of 3.5 or 10 cm and an excellent energy resolution in the
complete energy interval of interest. Due to these charac-
teristics, the n TOF facility stands today among the world
leading facilities for measuring neutron-induced reactions.

and the experiments being carried out can be found on the
official n TOF website http://www.cern.ch/nTOF.
