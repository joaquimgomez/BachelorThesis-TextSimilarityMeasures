Abstract. The neutron time of flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN is a spallation neutron 

source with white neutron energy spectrum (from thermal to several GeV), covering the full 

energy range of interest for nuclear astrophysics, in particular for measurements of the neutron 

capture cross section required in s-process nucleosynthesis. This contribution presents an 

overview on the astrophysical program carried on at the n_TOF facility, the main results and 

their implications.  

1.  The n_TOF facility at CERN 

Based on an idea by Rubbia et al. [1], the n_TOF facility at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, became fully 

operational in May 2002. After commissioning of the neutron beam, an intense scientific program 

started, relevance for Nuclear Astrophysics and energy applications. At n_TOF, neutrons are produced 

via spallation reactions induced by a pulsed proton beam on a massive lead target of 80 x 80 x 60 cm
3
. 

The high proton momentum of 20 GeV/c, the short pulse width of 6 ns, and an intensity of 7·10
12

 

protons per pulse make n_TOF one of the most luminous neutron source world wide. A 5 cm water 

slab surrounds the lead target acting as a coolant and as moderator of the initial fast neutron spectrum. 

As a result, a white neutron spectrum ranging form thermal up to a few GeV is produced [2].  

Neutrons emerging from the target propagate in the vacuum pipe inside a time-of-flight tunnel 200 

m long. Two collimators are present along the flight path, one of the diameter of 13,5 cm placed at 135 

m from the lead target and one at 180 m with a diameter of 2 cm for the capture measurements. This 

collimation results in a Gaussian-shaped beam profile [3]. A 1.5 T sweeping magnet placed at 40 m 

upstream of the experimental area is used to deflect outside the beam charged particles travelling 

along the vacuum pipe. For an efficient background suppression, several concrete and iron walls are 

placed along the time-of-flight tunnel.  

The measuring station is located inside the tunnel, centered at 187.5 m from the spallation target.  

Two complementary setups for neutron capture measurement are used at n_TOF: a pair of 

specifically designed C6D6 [4], and a 4 BaF2 array [5] acting as a total absorption calorimeter (TAC). 

Due to the low cross-section of most the samples of Astrophysics interest measured at n_TOF, the 

C6D6 were preferred for these measurements, since these detectors have the advantage of presenting an 

extremely low sensitivity to scattered neutron.  

The data acquisition system is based on flash ADCs with sampling rate up to 1 GHz. The 

consequent very high data rate ensures an almost zero dead-time [6].  

2.  Experimental campaign  

The experimental campaign devoted to Nuclear Astrophysics is focused mostly on neutron magic 

nuclei, which act as bottle neck for the flow of s-process. Branching points isotopes and isotopes of 

special interest, such as the osmium involved in the so-called cosmic clock have also been 

investigated. Many new relevant results have been achieved, see [7,8,9,10,11,12]. In the following, the 

most recent result and their astrophysica implications are described. 

2.1.  
90,91,92,93,94,96

Zr (n, ) cross section measurements  

Zr is a typical s-process element belonging to the first s-process peak of solar abundance distribution. 

Predictions of the production of the various Zr isotopes are critical for s-process modelling. Several of 

them are close to the magic number of neutron N =50, with 
90

Zr having exactly N=50. Hence, 

production of 
90,91,92,94

Zr is sensitive to the overall neutron flux, which is mostly defined by the 
13

C 

neutron source. The abundance of the remaining stable isotope, 
96

Zr, is determined by the activation of 

the branching point at the unstable 
95

Zr. Hence, its production is sensitive to the neutron density,

which is mostly defined by the 
22

Ne neutron source. Furthermore, most of the abundance of the 

element Nb is due to the radiogenic decay of the long living 
93

Zr. 

The capture cross sections of the 
91,92,93,94,96

Zr
 
in term of resonance parameter were measured in a 

wide neutron energy range. The results [13,14,15,16] show sizeable differences with respect to 

previous experimental data and allow extracting the related nuclear quantities with improved accuracy.  

2.2.  
186,187,188

Os(n,  measurements  

The time duration of the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements produced by neutron capture processes 

can be used to set limits on the age of the universe [14]. Among several cosmic clock based on the 

abundances of long-lived radioactive isotopes, the 
187

Os/
187

Re is one of the most interesting.  

The clock is based on the extremely long half-life of 
187

Re(1/2 = 43.3Gyr), decaying to 
187

Os, and 

on the fact that 
186

Os and 
187

Os are shielded against direct r-process production. Thanks to the well 

established s-process abundances of the 
186

Os and 
187

Os, the age of the Universe can be inferred, in the 

the Re/Os clock, by the enhancement in the abundance of 
187

Os due to 
187

Re →
187

Os decay. 

The neutron capture cross sections of 
186,187,188

Os have been measured at the CERN n_TOF facility 

with improved accuracy and over a wide energy range of neutron energies from 1 eV to 1 MeV. In 

Fig. 1 a comparison between the n_TOF result and the previous data is shown.  Based on the n_TOF 

data,Maxwellian averaged cross sections have been obtained with uncertainties between 3 and 4%. 

These results have been complemented by a detailed resonance analysis.Average level spacing, 

radiative widths, and neutron strength functions have been deduced by statistical analysis to establish a 

consistent set of input data for detailed cross section calculations with the Hauser-Feshbach statistical 

model. Based on these calculations stellar enhancement factors were obtained to correct the 

Maxwellian averaged cross sections determined from experimental (n, ) data for the effect of 
thermally excited states in the hot, dense photon bath at the s-process site. The corresponding stellar 

(n,) cross sections have been used to separate the radiogenic part of the 
187

Os abundance from its s-

process component and to define the mother/daughter ratio 
187

Re/
187

Os. With a schematic model that 

assumes an exponentially decreasing production rate for 
187

Re, an age of the Universe of 14.94 Gyr 

was obtained from the Re/Os cosmo-cronometer, with an accuracy, mostly related to the remaining 

nuclear physics uncertainties, of less than 1 Gyr. More details can be found in [17,18,19,20] 

 
FIG. 1. Comparison between the present results and the previous data [18] 

Conclusion  

Neutron capture cross sections of astrophysical interest have been measured at the CERN n_TOF 

facility. The major motivation of these measurements was to reduce the uncertainties on nuclear data 

to a few percent, as required to improve the stellar s-process model. Improvements in the n_TOF 

apparatus, compared to previous experiments, resulted in significantly reduced uncertainty in the 

measured cross-sections, with a valuable impact on studies of s-process nucleosynthesis. New 

measurements on neutron-magic nuclei and, especially, on branching-point radioactive isotopes, are

foreseen at n_TOF for the near future, while a much higher neutron flux in a second experimental area 

at 20 m from the spallation target, now in the proposal phase, would open the way to measurements of 

relatively short-lived isotopes, produced at ISOLDE, involved in r-process nucleosynthesis.
