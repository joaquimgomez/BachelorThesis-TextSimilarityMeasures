Background: There have been measurements on roughly 230 nuclei that are β-delayed neutron emitters. They
range from 8He up to 150La. Apart from 210Tl, with a branching ratio of only 0.007%, no other neutron emitter
has been measured beyond A = 150. Therefore, new data are needed, particularly in the region of heavy nuclei
around N = 126, in order to guide theoretical models and help understand the formation of the third r-process
peak at A ∼ 195.
Purpose: To measure both β-decay half-lives and neutron branching ratios of several neutron-rich Au, Hg, Tl,
Pb, and Bi isotopes beyond N = 126.
Method: Ions of interest were produced by fragmentation of a 238U beam, selected and identified via the GSI-FRS
fragment separator. A stack of segmented silicon detectors (SIMBA) was used to measure ion implants and β
decays. An array of 30 3He tubes embedded in a polyethylene matrix (BELEN) was used to detect neutrons with
high efficiency and selectivity. A self-triggered digital system is employed to acquire data and to enable time
correlations. The latter were analyzed with an analytical model and results for the half-lives and neutron-branching
ratios were derived by using the binned maximum-likelihood method.
Results: Twenty new β-decay half-lives are reported for 204−206Au, 208–211Hg,211–216Tl,215–218Pb, and 218–220Bi,
nine of them for the first time. Neutron emission probabilities are reported for 210,211Hg and 211–216Tl.

Conclusions: The new β-decay half-lives are in good agreement with previous measurements on nuclei in this
region. The measured neutron emission probabilities are comparable to or smaller than values predicted by global
models such as relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov plus the relativistic quasi-particle random phase approximation
(RHB + RQRPA).

I. INTRODUCTION

Very-neutron-rich nuclei may emit one or more neutrons
when they disintegrate via β decay. This is the so-called β-
delayed neutron (βn) emission process, which is energetically
allowed when the Qβ value of the decay exceeds the neutron
separation energy Sn of the daughter nucleus. The βn emission
has been experimentally determined for about 230 neutron-rich
nuclei, spanning from 8He up to 150La [1–4]. Most of these
measurements took advantage of the large fission yields around
the two fission peaks at A ∼ 95 and A ∼ 138 in thermal
neutron-induced fission. However, β-delayed neutron emis-
sion has remained essentially inaccessible for nuclei heavier
than A = 150, where only a minuscule value of 0.007% has
been reported for the βn-emission probability of 210Tl [5,6].
Because of the scarce or nonexistent βn data in the heavy-mass
region, rapid neutron capture r-process [7] calculations have
to rely entirely on theoretical models [8–10]. However, the
performance of such models for reproducing the features of the
β decay in r-process waiting-point nuclei has been tested with
experimental data only for the two shell closures at N = 50
and N = 82 from measurements such as those reported in
Refs. [11–17]. The comparison is much more limited in the
N = 126 region, where only half-lives in the neighborhood of
the doubly magic 208Pb were available (see, e.g., Ref. [18]).

The neutron-rich nuclei “south” of 208Pb are difficult to
study experimentally because of the very small production
cross sections and the large background induced by the heavy
primary beam. In the present work it was possible to produce
and identify reliably secondary neutron-rich nuclei in the
region “south-east” of 208Pb in the chart of nuclides thanks to
the high-energy (1 GeV/u) 238U beams available at the GSI fa-
cility. Extended motivation and results for this experiment were
recently published in Ref. [19]. Here we present more details
on the experimental apparatus in Sec. II, the analysis method-
ology and results, which are reported in Sec. III and, finally,
Secs. IV and V summarize the main results and conclusions.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND ION IDENTIFICATION

The present measurements were carried out at the GSI
Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research. A 238U beam
was accelerated to an energy of 1 GeV/u by the UNILAC
linear accelerator coupled to the SIS 18 synchrotron. The
average beam intensity was 2 × 109 ions/spill, with a pulsed
beam structure of 1 s spill duration (SIS extraction) and
a repetition cycle of 4 s. The beam impinged on a 9Be
target with a thickness of 1.6 g/cm2 at the entrance of the
fragment separator (FRS) [20]. The selection of the ions of
interest, from this point to the detection system, was done with
the Bρ-�E-Bρ method by using the FRS as an achromatic
spectrometer. Neutron-rich nuclei “south-east” of 208Pb in the

chart of nuclides were produced by using two FRS settings
centered on 211Hg and 215Tl. To minimize the number of ionic
charge states of the secondary beam a niobium layer with a
thickness of 223 mg/cm2 was placed behind the Be target.
In addition, a homogeneous Al degrader with a thickness of
2.5 g/cm2 was placed at the first FRS focal plane (S1) in
combination with thick Cu slits, which served to reduce the
contribution of fission fragments and primary beam charge
states with magnetic rigidity Bρ initially similar to that of the
setting isotope. A wedge-shaped Al degrader with a thickness
of 3874 mg/cm2 was employed as achromatic degrader at the
intermediate focal plane S2 (see Fig. 1).

Ion species were identified by means of standard FRS
tracking detectors. Two plastic scintillators located at S2 and
at the final focal plane S4 were used to measure the time
of flight (tTOF) of the ions. Two systems of time projection
chambers (TPCs) [21] placed at S4 and S2 allowed us to
determine accurate Bρ values for each ion by measuring their
trajectory with respect to the central fragment. The measured
tTOF in combination with the Bρ provided the necessary
information to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio (A/q) on
an event-by-event basis. The resolution thus obtained in A/q
was 2.5‰ full width at half maximum (FWHM).

To determine the atomic number Z, two fast multiple
sampling ionization chambers (MUSICs) [22] were placed in
the S4 experimental area. Although the detected nuclei were
mainly bare, H- and He-like charge states were also detected
in the MUSICs. These events were corrected by combining the
information of the two MUSICs and calculating the energy loss
in the S2 degrader following the method applied in previous
studies in this mass region [23–26]. In addition, it was needed
to treat the gain fluctuations in the MUSIC detectors caused by
the variations of the temperature in the experimental hall, and
consequent changes in gas pressure, which were also corrected
numerically [27]. The final resolution obtained in Z for the
Pb-Bi region was of �6‰ FWHM. Finally, the Z versus
A/q particle identification diagram (PID) was experimentally
validated with a dedicated run. 205Bi ions were implanted into a
passive plastic stopper and the decays of well-known isomeric
transitions [28] were measured with HPGe detectors.

The PID obtained, including nuclei produced in both
FRS settings with all the statistics accumulated during the

already reported in previous experiments [29,30].

A. Implantation and decay-detection system

The secondary beam of neutron-rich isotopes was focused
at the final focal plane S4 of the FRS. A third Al degrader
with variable thickness was adjusted in order to slow down
the ions of interest and to implant them into the central
region of an active stopper named “silicon implantation beta
absorber” (SIMBA) [31,32]. SIMBA enabled position and
energy measurement of heavy charged ions as well as charged
particles from α and β decays. The main difference between
the SIMBA system employed here and previous versions was
the smaller number of Si detectors required to stop and implant
the ions in the present experiment, which had a higher atomic
number (Z ∼ 82) than those measured in the past (Z ∼ 50,
[31]). In addition, the geometry and overall size of SIMBA
were also modified in order to optimize neutron detection (see

FIG. 3. Picture of SIMBA without its cylindrical coverage of
11.5 cm diameter.

below). The present SIMBA version consisted of a stack of
nine highly segmented Si detectors (see Figs. 3 and 4).

The first two layers, called XY -tracking detectors, consisted
of single-sided Si-strip detectors (SSSDs) with their strips
in orthogonal orientation with respect to each other. They
were used for determining accurately the ion position in the
transversal plane of the beam. A center-of-gravity method
applied to the charge shared over all the strips allowed us to de-
termine the ion position with an accuracy of ±1 mm2 [27,34],
corresponding to one pixel in a silicon layer of SIMBA. The
implant and decay-sensitive region consisted of two SSSD
layers (front absorbers), three double-sided silicon stripped
detectors (DSSSDs) designated as implantation layers A, B,
and C, and two SSSD layers (rear absorbers). The energy
deposited by the ions along these seven Si detectors was used to
detect whether the ion was implanted or if it punched through,
as well as to determine the corresponding implant layer or
depth. The segmentation of the DSSSDs was 60-fold in the
X and 40-fold in the Y direction, with a strip width of 1 mm.
Figure 5 shows the total number of implanted ions for each
isotope in the DSSSDs of SIMBA.

The energy deposited by β decays in each Si-electrode
showed, as expected, a continuum spectrum which extended
up to ∼2–3 MeV. The energy deposited in the DSSSDs was
determined from the response of the Y strips, which were
readout via logarithmic preamplifiers. The latter allowed clear
separation of the ion implants and decays in the spectrum [see
Table I and Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. A pulse generator was used
to perform the gain-matching of the Y strips. An accurate
energy calibration of layers A and B was accomplished using
well-known α decays from several At, Bi, Rn, and Po isotopes
produced in the decay of implanted Tl, Pb, and Bi nuclei [see
Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. No α emitter was implanted in layer C and,
therefore, a coarse energy calibration of the latter was made by
using only the broad β spectrum [Fig. 6(d)]. Nevertheless, for
implant-β time correlations only an energy window covering
the broad β spectrum is required and, therefore, an accurate
energy calibration is of secondary relevance for this data
analysis.

SIMBA was placed inside the cylindrical hole (23 cm
diameter) of the beta delayed neutron (BELEN) detector [46–
49]. BELEN consisted of an array of 30 3He counters of

rings: an inner one with a radius of 14.5 cm and 10 tubes of
10 atm, and the outer ring with a radius of 18.5 cm and 20
tubes of 20 atm. This configuration was designed by means
of GEANT4 [50,51] and MCNPX [52–54] Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations in order to achieve a high and flat detection
efficiency (see Fig. 8). At a neutron energy up to 1 MeV
the detection efficiency was 40(2)%, and it decreased to 25%
at 5 MeV. The MC codes were experimentally validated at
En = 2.3 MeV with a dedicated measurement of a well-
calibrated 252Cf source.

The Qβn window of the exotic nuclei involved in the present
measurement spans neutron energies up to 2.5 MeV [55,56].
In this energy range, the average neutron detection efficiency

was 38%; this value was used in the data analysis (see Sec. III).
By using the calibrated 252Cf source a gain matching of the re-
sponse of all 30 counters was carried out before the experiment.
The stability of the overall detector response was checked
regularly during the experiment. The accumulated spectrum
for all 30 tubes during the 211Hg setting is shown Fig. 9.

The energy window considered in the data analysis as
neutron events comprises the range from a low threshold of the
191 keV peak up to the end of the main peak of the reaction [see
Eq. (1)] at 765 keV. The latter peak corresponds to the kinetic
energy of the two reaction products, a triton and a proton:

3He + n −→ 3H + 1H + 765 keV. (1)
To reduce the neutron background in BELEN two additional

elements were implemented in the setup. On one hand, a
PE wall with a thickness of 30 cm was installed upstream
from BELEN to shield the detector from neutron background
induced by the secondary beam (see Fig. 7). This wall had a
central hole of 180 mm in the X direction and 70 mm in the Y
direction to let the beam into SIMBA. In addition, a layer of
borated rubber was attached to the rear of the PE wall in order
to absorb thermalized neutrons that could eventually reach the
rear side of the wall. On the other hand, the BELEN detector
was surrounded by 20 cm of PE shielding (see Fig. 7) in order to
moderate and absorb scattered neutrons from the surroundings.

The GSI multibranch system (MBS) [57] was used to
acquire data from the FRS tracking detectors and SIMBA. This
data-acquisition system (DACQ) was triggered by a scintillator
at S4 with an efficiency of ∼100% for heavy ions. The MBS
was also triggered by high-energy implant and low-energy
β-decay events in SIMBA. On the other hand, the neutron data
from BELEN were acquired by using a digital self-triggered
system [58] based on SIS3302 VME digitizers from Struck
Innovative Systems [59]. Each module had 8 input channels
running at 100 MHz sampling rate with an ADC resolution
of 16 bit. A common clock was used for time stamping the
events acquired in the BELEN and MBS DACQ systems with
20 ns resolution. In this way, ion-implant versus β-decay time
correlations and ion-β-neutron time correlations could be built
over an arbitrarily long time window and in both forward
(increasing) and backward (decreasing) time directions. The
latter aspect was a key feature in the analysis stage to determine
reliably the background level (see Sec. III).

III. DETERMINATION OF β-DECAY HALF-LIVES
AND P1n VALUES

The methodology followed here for the analysis of the
β-decay half-lives is similar to the approach successfully
applied in previous experiments at isotope separator on-line
(ISOL) and fragmentation facilities, such as described in
Refs. [16,31]. There are two fundamental aspects to this data
analysis; namely, a reliable background characterization of β
and neutron events and the spatial- and temporal-correlation
approach. We describe first the analysis methodology from a
rather general perspective and afterwards we show in detail its
application to one of the largest implant statistics case, which
is 213Tl. The latter is also used to illustrate the background
treatment in the analysis.

Let us consider one specific isotope i. The Bateman
analytical expression [60] describes the time evolution of
its abundance Ni(t). In this analysis we assumed that only
the parent (N1) and daughter (N2) decays are contributing
to the decay curve. This assumption is justified because

all granddaughters of the analyzed nuclei are either stable
nuclei or have a half-life much longer than that of the parent
and daughter nuclei. The resulting expression based on this
assumption is given by

λiNi(t) = [λ1N1(t) + λ2N2(t)], (2)

where λ1 = ln(2)/T1/2 is the decay constant for the implanted
nucleus (i = 1), with unknown half-life T1/2, and λ2 is the
decay constant of the daughter nucleus (i = 2). As shown
below, in many cases even the contribution of the daughter
nucleus was very small.

Regarding the spatial correlation, we considered an implant
and a decay event to be spatially associated when the β-decay
position measured in layers A, B, or C of SIMBA was within
a correlation region of 3 mm2 around the implant position
measured in the same layer. Extending this condition to
neighboring layers did not improve noticeably the statistics
and was therefore disregarded. In general, smaller and larger

correlation areas were not found to provide a better result
in terms of statistics and signal-to-background ratio in the
time-correlation diagrams [27].

Regarding the time correlation, the methodology followed
here consisted of building a correlation histogram for every
implant of a certain species i containing its time difference with
respect to all, forward and backward, β events within a broad
time window �t � T1/2. In this analysis we used ten times the
expected half-life, �t � 10T1/2. As demonstrated below, the
uncorrelated background rate is a constant value, which can be
referred to as b. In this case, the probability density function
describing the time dependence of the correlation distribution
is given by [61]

analysis, the common factor N1(0)εβ in Eq. (4) is derived from
the first bin in the correlation diagram [27]. In this way the
quantity of interest (T1/2) can be reliably determined without
knowing explicitly the β-detection efficiency.

A. Reference analysis of 213Tl half-life

The thallium isotope 213Tl was implanted with large
statistics (1015 implants), so we used this case to establish
the analysis methodology on a reliable statistical basis. The
β background showed a dependency with the time structure
of the pulsed primary beam. Indeed, during beam extraction
from SIS (1 s) the overall background level of β-like events
in SIMBA was ∼40% higher than during the time-interval
between spills [27]. This feature led to a better signal-to-
background ratio in the implant-β time-correlation histograms
when only β-events outside of the spill time intervals were
considered in the correlations, when compared with the same
diagram including β-events inside and outside the spill. With
this restriction in mind, the background level evaluation was
based on time backward (t < 0) implant-β correlations, i.e.,
the time difference between each implant and all the β events
occurring before it, within a broad time window (�t � 10T1/2)
and in the same correlation area used in the forward analysis of
3 × 3 mm2. The background level thus determined allows one
to adjust the parameter b in Eq. (3). This approach is illustrated
in Fig. 10 for the case of 213Tl, which shows backward
(negative) and forward (positive) implant-β correlations. The
contribution to the measured β activity from decays of other
nuclei can be assumed to be negligible due to the very
low average implantation rate of 2 × 10−5 ions s−1 pixel−1.
By using Eq. (4), a binned maximum likelihood (ML) [62]
analysis of the time correlation histogram was carried
out, which yielded a half-life for 213Tl of T1/2 = 23.8 ±
4.4 s. Comparison with other literature values is made in
Sec. IV.

The decay curve shows mostly the contribution of 213Tl decay (green

line).

B. Neutron branching ratio for 213Tl

The implant-β neutron correlations were analyzed by
selecting a correlation window of �nt = 400 μs forward and
backward in time, following each β detection. This time
interval was determined according to the expected neutron
moderation time in polyethylene. Considering the β efficiency
εβ as a constant value over the range of energies of interest,
the P1n value can be directly obtained from the subtraction of
time-forward and time-backward β-neutron correlated events,

and Nβ together with the uncertainty for the BELEN detector

213Tl we measured five forward and no backward correlated
neutrons (Fig. 11), which yielded a P1n value of 7.6% ± 3.4%.

following the approach described above for 213Tl. The implant-
β time-correlation histograms for all of them, 211,212,214–216Tl
are shown in Fig. 12. The binned ML analysis (dashed-dotted
line on diagrams) yields T1/2 = 76.5 ± 17.8 s for 211Tl,
T1/2 = 30.9 ± 8.0 s for 212Tl, and T1/2 = 11.0 ± 2.4 s for
214Tl. An almost negligible contribution from the much slower
decay of the daughter nuclei (211,212,214Pb) can be observed in
these three cases. The most exotic thallium species implanted,
215,216Tl, were measured with rather limited statistics of
only 281 and 99 implants, respectively. In this case, we
noticed a slight improvement in the signal-to-background
ratio in the correlation histograms when the correlation
area was enlarged from 3 × 3 mm2 to 5 × 5 mm2. The
ML analysis also shown in diagrams of Fig. 12 yielded a
half-lives T1/2 = 9.7 ± 3.8 s for 215Tl and T1/2 = 5.9 ± 3.3 s
for 216Tl.

The neutron-data analysis showed the presence of only one
correlated implant-β-neutron event for each of 211,212,215Tl,
which yields neutron-branching ratios of 2.2(2.2)%, 1.8(1.8)%
and 4.6(4.6)%, respectively. For these three cases, given
the low number of events compatible with the physical
boundary, we have alternatively calculated a conservative
upper limit based on the Bayesian approach [63], which
yields upper limits of 10%, 8%, and 20% at a confidence
level (CL) of 95%. On the other hand, with BELEN we
were able to observe a rather large number (10) of implant-
β-neutron correlated events for 214Tl (histogram also shown
in Fig. 12), resulting in a P1n value of 34.3% ± 12.2%. No
single correlated or uncorrelated event was detected for 216Tl
which, according to the implantation statistics obtained, led
to an upper limit of 11.5% and a Bayesian upper limit of
P1n < 52% at the 95% CL. Concerning the other implanted
species, 209,210Tl, the implantation statistics was not enough
to determine either their half-lives or the neutron-branching
ratios.

D. Lead isotopes: 215–218Pb

The lead isotopes 212–219Pb were identified in the FRS and

with enough statistics for a reliable half-life analysis. 214Pb was

also implanted with large statistics (see Fig. 5), but its half-life
of 1608 ± 54 s [64] was too long for our analysis methodology
and instrumentation. The ML analyses for the implant-β
correlation diagrams of 215–218Pb are shown in Fig. 13. The
215Pb analysis yielded a half-life of T1/2 = 98.4 ± 30.8 s. As

can be observed on its diagram, contributions from 215Pb and
its daughter 215Bi are present in the correlation histogram. For
the case of the measurement of 216Pb, it allowed us to carry out
a cross-check of the aforementioned analysis methodology,
because its half-life can be determined by means of two
different methods: implant-β and implant-α correlations.
The former is also illustrated in Fig. 13, which shows the
implant-β correlation and the result of the ML analysis. On
the other hand, the peak of α particles at 6778.3 keV, clearly
identified in the energy spectrum of SIMBA [see Fig. 6(b)],
corresponds to the decay of its granddaughter nucleus 216Po.
Taking into account that the half-life of 216Po, 145 ± 2
ms [40], is much shorter than that of the direct daughter
216Bi, 2.25 ± 5 min [40], it was possible to apply the method
described in Ref. [65] to obtain the half-life of 216Pb. With this
method we determined a half-life of T1/2 = 99.4 ± 11.7 s (see
diagram of Fig. 14) which is in perfect agreement with the one
obtained applying the conventional method described above
for implant-β time correlation, T1/2 = 99.4 ± 17.5 s. The
accuracy in the analysis of 217Pb and 218Pb was mainly limited
by the implantation statistics, where there was 436 and 235
implants, respectively. However, a reliable ML analysis was
possible from their implant-β correlation diagrams, as shown

in the low diagrams of Fig. 13. The resulting half-lives were
T1/2 = 19.9 ± 5.3 s for 217Pb and T1/2 = 14.8 ± 6.8 s for
218Pb. According to the negative Qβn values for all these lead
isotopes, no neutron branching emission is expected for them.

E. Mercury isotopes: 208–211Hg

From the eight mercury isotopes identified, 206–213Hg,
implant statistics were high enough to analyze four of them
reliably, 208–211Hg. The decay curve is strongly determined
by the number of ion implants, as well as by the value of the
half-life. Thus, for 208Hg, with low implantation statistics (220
events) and a relatively long half-life obtained from the ML
analysis, T1/2 = 132.2 ± 50 s, the statistical uncertainty was
38%. On the other hand, 209Hg has a factor of about two more
implants (583 events) and a shorter half-life (T1/2 = 6.3 ±
1.1 s), which leads to an uncertainty much lower, 17%. An
intermediate situation is found for the remaining two mercury
isotopes, 210,211Hg, for which the half-life analysis yielded
T1/2 = 63.7 ± 11.6 s and T1/2 = 26.4 ± 8.1 s, respectively. In
the latter case, the value obtained in the present work for the
half-life of 211Tl was employed in the analysis. All of the
implant-β correlation diagrams for these cases are shown in
diagrams of Fig. 15. Regarding the neutron emission branching
ratio, for 210Hg and 211Hg one implant-β-neutron event has
been detected in the forward (moderation) time window for

ratios of 2.2(2.2)% and 6.3(6.3)%, respectively. For these cases
the calculated conservative upper limit based on the Bayesian
approach [63] yields upper constraints of 10%, and 28% at a
CL of 95%.

F. Gold isotopes: 204–206Au

The 203–209Au isotopes were identified in this measurement,
but the implantation statistics was only high enough to analyze
three of them, 204–206Au. In the case of 204Au (see Fig. 16) we
also found a slight improvement of the decay curve when the
correlation area was enlarged from 1 pixel (9 mm2) to 2 pixels
(25 mm2) around the implant location and included in the
correlation those implant-β events detected during the spill
time. These provide a better sensitivity for the analysis, which
yields a half-life of T1/2 = 33.7 ± 14.9 s. For the cases of
205Au and 206Au, both with ∼100 implants, the ML analysis
of the implant-β correlation diagrams yielded half-lives of

T1/2 = 35.4 ± 16.9 s and T1/2 = 55.7 ± 16.7 s, respectively.
Figure 17 shows the analysis for these two gold isotopes.

G. Bismuth isotopes: 218–220Bi

Bismuth was the heaviest element implanted in SIMBA
and we were able to determine the half-lives of three isotopes,
218–220Bi. The ML analysis of 218Bi yields a half-life of T1/2 =
38.5 ± 21.6 s and, as can be seen in the diagram in Fig. 18, the
β contribution comes only from its own decay, as its daughter
(218Pb) is an α emitter. The half-life analysis for 219Bi yields
T1/2 = 8.7 ± 2.9 s (see the diagram also on Fig. 18) and it
includes the recent published half-life for its daughter, 219Po,
T1/2 = 620 ± 59 s [66].

For the β-decay analysis of 220Bi one has to take into
account that the half-life of its daughter nucleus 220Po is
still unknown. Thus, our analysis provides a range of possible
half-life values for 220Bi, which spans between 4 and 15 s. The
bold marker in Fig. 19 represents the 220Bi half-life using the

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

This section provides a summary of the main results
obtained in this work, as well as a comparison with all

previous experimental results and the theoretical predictions
of FRDM + QRPA [67] and DF3 + cQRPA [68] models.
A detailed comparison with the more recent calculations
of Refs. [69,70] can be found in Ref. [19]. In summary,
half-life values for 20 neutron-rich isotopes of Au, Hg, Tl,
Pb, and Bi have been determined experimentally, as well as
neutron-branching ratios (or upper limits) for eight of them.
The results are displayed in Figs. 20 and 21, and listed in
Tables II and III. As some of the analyzed isotopes are not
expected to be neutron emitters according to their Qβn values
(see the last column of Table II), due to the low statistics
available, the neutron-emission analysis has been focused
on those with large-enough Qβn. For comparison purposes,
previously published theoretical and experimental half-life
values have also been included in Fig. 20.

Apart from the discrepancies found for the 208,209Hg
isotopes, a rather good agreement is found between the present
results and previously published experimental data. In the
case of gold isotopes, all half-lives are fully compatible
with those reported in previous measurements [18,73–76],
which are in reasonable agreement with DF3 + cQRPA for
N � 126. For 206Au (N = 126) the half-life obtained confirms
the recent value published in Ref. [76] and both differ from the
DF3 + cQRPA value and the trends predicted by the available
theoretical models. Whether this “gold anomaly” is related
to effects changing the occupation of the νi11/2 orbital, or
due to a weakening of the spin-orbit field caused by the
tensor force [80], or might be due to the recently proposed
three-body force mechanism [81,82] remains an open question

which calls for more detailed theoretical studies and further
specific experiments allowing for reconstruction of the decay
scheme.

Concerning Hg isotopes, as discussed in Ref. [19], recent
measurements at the CERN On-Line Isotope Mass Separator
(ISOLDE) facility [83] indicate that the half-lives of the
208,209Hg nuclei are much shorter than the values reported in
Ref. [77] and, therefore, this discrepancy will not be discussed
further. Theoretical half-life predictions by FRDM + QRPA
show a fairly good agreement with the measured values, with
the only exception being 209Hg. Interestingly, the opposite
behavior is found regarding DF3 + cQRPA predictions. This
feature might reflect that first-forbidden transitions still play a
dominant role in the β decay of 209Hg. Further high-resolution
spectroscopy measurements are needed in order to shed light
on this aspect.

Regarding the thallium isotopes, previous half-lives were
obtained in another experiment by using a similar experi-
mental setup, but with a completely different analysis ap-
proach [78,84]. In summary, a good agreement is found for

211Tl, whereas the half-lives of 212Tl and 213Tl differ by factors
of two to three. It is worth emphasizing the overall good
agreement for the thallium chain between the present results
and FRDM + QRPA predictions, including the case of the
most exotic nuclei reported here for the first time, 214–216Tl.
This result seems to indicate the rather low relevance of first
forbidden (FF) transitions in the N � 126 mass region, as
discussed in Ref. [19].

The analysis of the lead isotopes includes three new half-
lives, 216–218Pb. The half-life obtained for 215Pb is in reasonable
agreement with the two previous measurements [65,79].
Along the lead isotopic chain, the FRDM + QRPA model
overestimates the experimental values by factors between
three to nine. The values predicted by DF3 + cQRPA are,
on average, slightly closer to the measured half-lives, but
the mass (neutron number) dependency of the half-life is not
satisfactorily reproduced by either of these two models.

For the bismuth chain the FRDM + QRPA predictions
agree reasonably well with the heaviest measured nuclei
219–220Bi, whereas almost one order-of-magnitude difference

is found for 218Bi. The latter half-life is, however, rather well
established experimentally [78]. The result quoted in this work
for the half-life of 220Bi, 4–15 s (see Fig. 19), can be redeter-
mined more accurately once the half-life of 220Po is measured.

The neutron-branching ratios determined in this work rep-
resent the first set of experimental data available in this mass re-
gion. Therefore, the values reported here can only be compared
with theoretical predictions. Both theoretical and experimental
P1n values are listed in Table II and displayed in Fig. 21.

In summary, the agreement between theory and experiment
is rather good for the Hg and Tl isotopes with masses between
208 and 214. However, for the two heaviest thallium nuclei
215,216Tl, KTUY [69] and RHB + RQRPA [70] models are in
agreement but the other theoretical predictions of the neutron
emission overestimate substantially the experimental results
obtained.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Since both the half-life and the neutron emission probability
are integral quantities of the β decay, it is difficult to explain
why the FRDM + QRPA reproduces so well the average decay
strength over the full Qβ window (see Fig. 20) along the chain
of measured Tl isotopes, whereas it seems to fail dramatically
in the upper energy range of 215,216Tl, beyond the neutron
separation energy of the daughter nuclei, as deduced from
their neutron-branching ratios. At first sight, one is tempted
to attribute such a discrepancy to the possible contribution
of high-energy first forbidden (FF) transitions populating
low-lying levels in the daughter nuclei and thus hindering
the emission of neutrons. Nevertheless, this interpretation is at

variance with the overall systematics found in the N � 126 re-
gion [18,19,65,76,78], where Gamow–Teller (GT) transitions
seem to play a dominant role in general. At present, the only
plausible explanation for such a feature could be that the over-
all strength of the β decay is overestimated in FRDM + QRPA,
both in the full Qβ and in the upper energy window Qβn.
As reported in Ref. [19], more advanced microscopic models
such as RHB + RQRPA [70] and KTUY [69] show an
inverted behavior, yielding good predictions for the P1n values,
but discrepant values for the half-lives, thus not improving
the situation. Recent calculations based on an improved
QRPA and HF theory [72], included in Fig. 21, also show
large discrepancies. Clearly, more β-decay measurements and
theoretical efforts are needed in this mass region to gain a better
understanding of the underlying nuclear structure effects, as
well as to guide global theoretical models far-off stability.
