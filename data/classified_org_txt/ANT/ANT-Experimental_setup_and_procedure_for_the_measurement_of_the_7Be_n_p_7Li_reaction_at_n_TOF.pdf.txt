a b s t r a c t

Following the completion of the second neutron beam line and the related experimental area (EAR2) at the n_TOF
spallation neutron source at CERN, several experiments were planned and performed. The high instantaneous
neutron flux available in EAR2 allows to investigate neutron induced reactions with charged particles in the
exit channel even employing targets made out of small amounts of short-lived radioactive isotopes. After the
successful measurement of the 7Be(n,ùõº)ùõº cross section, the 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction was studied in order to provide
still missing cross section data of relevance for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), in an attempt to find a solution
to the cosmological Lithium abundance problem. This paper describes the experimental setup employed in such
a measurement and its characterization.

1. Introduction

In July 2014 the second experimental area (EAR2) of the n_TOF
spallation neutron-time-of-flight facility at CERN came into operation.
The advantage of n_TOF, with respect to other neutron facilities in the
world, is the extremely high instantaneous neutron flux delivered in a
short time interval at the sample position. The still higher neutron flux
of about 107 √∑ 108 n/cm2/s, obtained with the reduced flight path of
19 m with respect to the 185 m of the older EAR1, allows to perform
experiments on low-mass targets and/or targets made out of short-lived
radionuclides, even on isotopes characterized by a small reaction cross-
section, with a favorable signal to background ratio. Indeed, challenging
measurements of reactions with outgoing charged particles have now
become attainable [1‚Äì3].

The first experiment done at EAR2 was the measurement of the
energy-dependent 7Be(n,ùõº)ùõº cross-section [4,5], of relevance for a
possible nuclear solution to the cosmological Lithium abundance prob-
lem (CLIP) in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework [6,7].
Before the n_TOF measurement, the only existing data consisted in a
single value measured in the 1960s at thermal neutron energy [8].
The new measurement indicated that the cross section of the (n,ùõº)
reaction was too low to significantly affect the abundance of primordial
Lithium. Following that measurement, the last piece of information still
missing in the BBN and CLIP scenario was an accurate measurement

of the 7Be(n,p)7Li cross-section. Indeed, the only two existing measure-
ments on this reaction in the neutron energy range from thermal to
keV date back to the late 1980s and are in disagreement with each
other [9,10]. Moreover, above approximately 10 keV the cross-section
must match the data available from the time-reversal reaction [11], a
check that could not be performed with the old data, as they stopped at
neutron energies well below those of the 7Li(p,n)7Be data. The neutron
flux features of the EAR2 facility and the n_TOF time-energy dynamic
range provided the opportunity of a high quality direct measurement of
the 7Be(n,p)7Li cross-section.

Contrary to 7Be(n,ùõº)ùõº reaction, with no need for a pure 7Be tar-
get because of the signature consisting in two ‚âà8 MeV ùõº-particles,
in the present case an isotopically pure 7Be target was mandatory.
The 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction has a very high thermal cross-section (several
104 b), but it produces rather low-energy protons of 1.44 MeV which
could easily interfere with background from other reaction channels on
the sample backing or contaminants. The main requirements were thus
to run the experiment on an as much as possible pure target and to detect
the emitted proton in a very selective fashion.

This paper describes the experimental setup and the validation test,
performed on a 6LiF target, which allowed us to prove the feasibility of
the experiment and to provide an absolute reference to normalize the
cross-section. The reaction on the 7Be target was measured in the energy
range from thermal to ‚âà400 keV, and some preliminary data are shown.
The detailed physics analysis is currently being finalized, and the results
are going to be published soon [12].

2. Experimental setup

Contrary to the measurement of the 7Be(n,ùõº) reaction, the high cross-
section of the (n,p) channel allowed for a lower efficiency detection
system that could be placed off-beam. The main advantages of such a
setup were the reduction of: (i) the pile-up issues; (ii) the background
of 478 keV ùõæ-rays following the natural decay of the 7Be target nuclei
into 7Li; and (iii) the huge background due to the so-called ùõæ-flash,
i.e. the big prompt burst of ùõæ-rays and relativistic charged particles
produced by the n_TOF spallation target. These three issues would have
posed severe limitations on the performance of an in-beam detector
arrangement similar to the one exploited in Refs. [4,5].

In order to use the identification of the emitted 1.44 MeV protons
as signature of the reaction under study, a silicon telescope detector

was chosen. Besides providing an absolute energy response, silicon
has a low sensitivity to ùõæ-rays and scattered neutrons. Indeed, ùõæ-rays
and neutrons up to ‚âà1 MeV basically produce low amplitude signals,
with an interaction probability < 10‚àí3 √∑ 10‚àí4. Furthermore, they can
practically interact only with one of the elements of a telescope, and are
therefore efficiently rejected by the coincidence technique. To maximize
the geometrical efficiency a reasonably wide detector was needed, and
for this reason a 5 cm √ó 5 cm geometry was chosen. Finally, in order
to circumvent the noise problem associated with large area silicon
detectors, in particular for the thinner ùõ•E stage characterized by a large
capacitance, it was decided to employ a strip-like geometry. Both ùõ•E
and E stages were made of 16 strips 3 mm wide and 50 mm long, with
an inter-strip gap of 0.1 mm. The thickness was respectively 20 and
300 Œºm, with a 7 mm distance between the two stages. The nominal
energy loss of a 1.4 MeV proton impinging perpendicularly on the
telescope is 0.86 MeV on the ùõ•E stage before it is stopped on the E stage.
Additional benefits of the strip detectors are: (i) rejection of spurious
background by means of a more selective geometrical choice of the ùõ•E‚Äì
E coincidences; (ii) a better tool to evaluate the geometrical efficiency
and the target alignment from the data, which can be easily compared
with numerical simulations; (iii) the possibility of roughly checking the
expected isotropy of the angular distribution of the emitted protons.

In Fig. 1 a 3D sketch and a vertical profile of the detector setup
are shown, not to scale and with exaggerated thickness of the E and ùõ•E
silicon detectors for better clarity. Fig. 2 shows a picture of the real setup
on the bench before its installation on the EAR2 neutron beam line. In
Fig. 3 we show the scattering chamber installed on the vertical neutron
beam line in EAR2. The front-end electronics boxes are visible, whereas
the target and the telescope detector are inside.

A standard commercial front-end and readout electronics was chosen
for the setup. The preamplifiers consisted of 16 units of CAEN-A1422H-
F3 [13] for the ùõ•E stage (90 mV/MeV gain), and 16 units of CSPA
03M.02a [14] for the E stage (50 mV/MeV gain). The rise time of the
signals from the preamplifiers for the ùõ•E and E stages were respectively
100 and 50 ns. Two 16-channel CAEN-N568B modules were used as
shaping amplifiers, and their shaping time was optimized at 0.2 Œºs by
means of calibration ùõº-sources. The analog signals were then digitized
using Acqiris flash ADCs with up to 14 bit resolution and up to 2 GHz
sampling rate.

The ùõ•E and E silicon detectors, along with the front-end electronics,
were tested on the bench by means of ùõº-sources. The behavior was
quite uniform strip-by-strip, as can be seen in Fig. 4 showing the FWHM

resolution for each ùõ•E and E detector strip, tested with a pulser and
with 238U (for the ùõ•E detector) and 241Am (for the E detector).

The 7Be target preparation was basically done in two separate steps.
First, 200 GBq of 7Be were extracted from the cooling water of the SINQ
spallation source at PSI and deposited onto a suitable support in form
of 7Be(NO3)2 colloid. Then, the support was transported to the ISOLDE
facility at CERN, where it was installed in the ion source (‚Äò‚ÄòISOLDE
oven‚Äô‚Äô) to produce a 30 keV ion beam. The 7Be beam was separated
by means of a magnetic dipole, and was implanted on a 20 Œºm thick
aluminum backing placed in a high vacuum collection chamber. The
beam direction was swept during the implantation with the aim of
depositing a uniform film of 1.5 cm √ó 1.5 cm area. However, an accurate
measurement of the spatial distribution of the 7Be activity in the sample,
performed after the measurement, revealed that the isotope had been
implanted over a smaller area, showing a Gaussian-like profile of 5 mm
FWHM.

Two 7Be samples were produced, a test sample with 20 MBq activity
and the final sample with 1.1 GBq. A detailed description of the complex
production procedure, of the sample characterization and of the target
installation is presented in a separate paper [15].

An additional sample, to be used for the validation test described
below, was produced by evaporating a 1.8 Œºm thick 6LiF layer onto a
2 Œºm thick mylar foil [16]. The size of this target was 5 cm √ó 5 cm,
but a 1.5 cm √ó 1.5 cm mask was used during the measurement resulting
in an effective target area consistent with the planned area of the 7Be
sample. The target installation required a separate support to be inserted
independently, as shown in Fig. 5, due to its high activity. The telescope
detector had already been installed from the opposite side of the
chamber.

The detection efficiency of the setup was simulated by means of the
Monte Carlo code GEANT4, assuming isotropic emission from the target
(the selected physics list was FTFP_INCLXX_HP and emstandard_opt0,
as already used in previous works about n_TOF neutron flux [17] and
neutron detection [18]). Many different neutron beam energies were
simulated, assuming a Gaussian beam shape with a sigma value of 1 cm
and a radius of 2 cm. The result, as a function of the strip number and
normalized to unity area, is shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 for tritons and
protons (additional details are provided in Sections 3 and 4). The overall
shape of the efficiency accounts for the 45‚ó¶ tilt of the target with respect
to the detector.

3. The validation test

In order to assess the feasibility of the measurement the 6LiF sample
was inserted in the setup on the EAR2 beam line. The exploited test
reaction was the well known

The ùõº particles were stopped in the ùõ•E detector layer, therefore they
could not be registered in coincidence mode. Conversely, the tritons

Fig. 8. ùõ•E-E scatter plot measured from the 6Li(n,ùõº) reaction, with the tritons locus
clearly visible. The wide energy spread was due to the emission depth and angle in the
target, and to the wide range of incidence angles on the detector.

normalization. The green continuous line, to be read on the right-hand axis, represents

crossed the ùõ•E and were stopped in the E layer, releasing respectively
1 and 1.7 MeV (nominal values when tritons are emitted from the very
front face of the sample and impinge perpendicularly on the detector).
Fig. 8 shows the ùõ•E-E scatter plot measured in the test reaction (1).
The triton pattern is clearly visible and its wide energy spread in both
directions is due to variable energy loss in the target, depending on the
emission depth and angle, and to the spread of incidence angles on the
detector.

By selecting the events falling within the triton locus, and profiting
by the information about the hit strip, one can evaluate the relative
detection efficiency for the tritons produced in the 6Li(n,ùõº) reaction as
a function of strip number. The related plot in Fig. 6 shows the measured
distribution for low-energy neutrons (ùê∏n < 50 keV), as compared with
a GEANT4 simulation assuming isotropic emission from the target (the
triton emission in the 6Li(n,ùõº) reaction is isotropic for neutron energies
below 50 keV). The slight difference between data and simulation
in Fig. 6 indicates a small misalignment between the beam and the
target center. Nonetheless, the total detection efficiency as a function
of the incident neutron energy was evaluated by means of a GEANT4
simulation and the results are shown in Fig. 9 (continuous line, right-
hand axis).

Fig. 10. Scatter plot of the time interval between corresponding ùõ•E and E strips in coin-
cidence events as a function of the neutron time-of-flight, as measured in the 7Be(n,p)7Li
reaction.

The 6Li(n,ùõº) data represent a very reliable absolute reference to
normalize the 7Be(n,p)7Li data, as the cross-section is an international
standard from thermal up to 1 MeV neutron energy [19]. In order to
prove their reliability, these data were also used to explicitly reconstruct
the 6Li(n,ùõº) cross-section, by making use of the known neutron flux in
EAR2 which had been determined by means of a set of independent
measurements based on different reference reactions and employing
several different detector technologies [20]. The good agreement be-
tween the so obtained cross-section and the standard one reported in the
ENDF database [21] is shown in Fig. 9, where the dip in the detection
efficiency corresponds to the well-known resonance in the 6Li(n,ùõº)
cross-section which has a mostly p-wave forward‚Äìbackward distribu-
tion [22]. A final redundant check was also performed with respect to
the independent neutron beam monitor SIMON2, which is permanently
installed in the beam line and which is based on another 6LiF target
coupled to four silicon detectors [22]. Also in this case a good agreement
was obtained within the experimental uncertainties.

4. Preliminary data

A preliminary test run was done with the lower activity 7Be target
(20 MBq), to further prove the overall feasibility of the measurement.
The test was followed by the final measurement with the 1.1 GBq
activity target, and both results were in agreement within the statistical
uncertainties. In Fig. 10 we show the distribution of the time interval
between corresponding ùõ•E and E strips in coincidence events as a func-
tion of the neutron time-of-flight. The higher statistics region around
5√∑8 ms corresponds to the thermal neutron energy range. Fig. 11 shows
the projection of Fig. 10 onto the ùëå -axis, that represents the overall
coincidence time distribution. One can see that it is centered around
100 ns, due to delays introduced by electronics and cabling, with a
FWHM resolution around 23 ns. The two signals from a coincidence,
produced by a proton crossing the ùõ•E detector and stopped in the E
detector, are shown in Fig. 12.

The width of the time coincidence window between the strips in
the ùõ•E detector and the corresponding strips in the E detector was
chosen as 100 ns. Signals on corresponding ùõ•E and E strips within such
a time window were assumed to be proton candidate events. For such
events a ùõ•E-E scatter plot was built, and the geometrical locus ascribed
to protons is clearly visible (Fig. 13). By selecting the events falling
within the proton locus, and profiting by the information about the
hit strip, the relative detection efficiency for the protons produced in
the 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction was evaluated as a function of strip number.
The related plot is reported in Fig. 7 and compared to the simulation
results, where isotropic emission from the target was assumed. Even

event.

in this case the difference between data and simulation indicates a
small misalignment between the beam and the target center, which
does not affect significantly the evaluation of the total efficiency and
consequently of the cross section.

A run with a dummy target, consisting of an aluminum backing
without 7Be, was performed to evaluate the background contribution
due to the target support as a function of neutron energy. The cor-
responding scatter plot in Fig. 14, with a much larger bin size in
order to highlight the overall shape in spite of the very low statistics,
demonstrates the very low background level achieved by the ùõ•E-E co-
incidence technique. The signal-to-background ratio, normalized to the
same number of incident neutrons, was plotted in Fig. 15. The signal is
represented by the number of proton events measured in the 7Be(n,p)7Li
reaction, and the background is the corresponding number measured
with the dummy target. Even up to several 100 keV the signal-to-
background ratio remains of the order of 10, thus implying that the cross
section under investigation could be measured up to this energy range.

5. Conclusion

In order to fit one last missing piece of information into the BBN
scenario, an accurate measurement of the 7Be(n,p)7Li cross-section was
planned and performed, as the only two existing measurements from
thermal to keV energies on this reaction date back to the 1980s and
are in disagreement with each other. The experimental setup described
in this paper proved to be reliable and perfectly suited for the task,
fulfilling all the expectations and featuring an outstanding signal-to-
background performance in a wide energy range, including the one

normalization to the known neutron flux in EAR2, strongly support the

from thermal up to ‚âà400 keV, whose detailed data analysis and physical
implications will be discussed in a separate forthcoming paper [12].
