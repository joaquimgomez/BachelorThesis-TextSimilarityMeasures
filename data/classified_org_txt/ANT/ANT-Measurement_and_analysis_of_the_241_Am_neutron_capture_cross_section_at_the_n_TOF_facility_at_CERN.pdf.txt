The 241Am(n,γ ) cross section has been measured at the n_TOF facility at CERN with the n_TOF BaF2 Total
Absorption Calorimeter in the energy range between 0.2 eV and 10 keV. Our results are analyzed as resolved
resonances up to 700 eV, allowing a more detailed description of the cross section than in the current evaluations,
which contain resolved resonances only up to 150–160 eV. The cross section in the unresolved resonance region
is perfectly consistent with the predictions based on the average resonance parameters deduced from the resolved
resonances, thus obtaining a consistent description of the cross section in the full neutron energy range under
study. Below 20 eV, our results are in reasonable agreement with JEFF-3.2 as well as with the most recent direct
measurements of the resonance integral, and differ up to 20–30% with other experimental data. Between 20 eV
and 1 keV, the disagreement with other experimental data and evaluations gradually decreases, in general, with
the neutron energy. Above 1 keV, we find compatible results with previously existing values.

I. INTRODUCTION

To improve the design of new advanced nuclear reactors and
for determining their performance in the transmutation of nu-
clear waste, it is important to reduce the present neutron cross
section uncertainties of minor actinides [1–3]. In particular,
241Am is one of the most abundant minor actinides in spent
fuels, and capture is the dominant reaction in this nucleus at
low neutron energies. In addition, the reprocessing of Am is
technologically more advanced than for other minor actinides.

Improved experimental cross section data for the
241Am(n,γ ) reaction was one of the objectives of the ANDES
project within the Seventh Framework Programme of the
European Commission. Therefore, four time-of-flight (TOF)
measurements were planned and carried out. In this paper we
present the results of one of these measurements. The other
three have been already published: one of them, which is also
a capture measurement, was performed with the same sample
and in the same facility but with different γ -ray detectors [4];
the other two are a transmission and a capture measurement
performed at JRC-Geel, with a different sample [5]. In addition
there are several other measurements, both TOF and integral,
which present significant discrepancies among one another.
As a consequence, it is not surprising that there are also large
discrepancies among the evaluated libraries. Indeed, these
discrepancies are being investigated through an international
collaborative working group organized by NEA-OECD [6].

The 241Am(n,γ ) cross section measurement presented in
this paper was performed at the n_TOF facility at CERN
[7] using the n_TOF Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC).
Capture cross section data were obtained for incident neutron
energies between 0.2 eV and 10 keV. In Sec. II we describe the
experimental setup. The data reduction procedures to derive

the experimental capture yield, which will be made available
for the EXFOR database [8], are presented in Sec. III. The
results of a resonance shape analysis are reported in Sec. IV and
compared with results of other experiments and evaluations in
Sec. V. Finally, the conclusions of this work are presented in
Sec. VI.

II. THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. The n_TOF facility at CERN

The n_TOF facility at CERN [7,9,10] is a high instantaneous
intensity pulsed neutron source designed to study neutron-
nucleus interactions for neutron kinetic energies ranging from
a few meV to several GeV. Neutrons are produced every 1.2
s (or multiples of this interval) from spallation reactions by
a 20 GeV/c proton beam delivered by the CERN Proton
Synchrotron (PS) with 16 ns FWHM time resolution impinging
on a 1.3 tonne cylindrical lead target 40 cm in length and 60 cm
in diameter. The target is surrounded by a coolant circuit of
1-cm-thick water, followed by 4 cm of borated water (H2O +
1.28% H3BO3, fraction in mass) which moderates the initially
fast neutron spectrum.1 At present neutrons travel through two
evacuated beam lines, a horizontal and a vertical one at angles
of 10◦ and 90◦ with respect to the direction of the proton beam,
respectively. However, the vertical beam line [11] had not been
built when this measurement was made in 2010. The horizontal
beam line reaches a measuring station located at a distance of
182.3 m from the spallation target and has a length of 7.9 m.
A sweeping magnet placed along the beam line prevents the
charged particles from reaching the measuring station and two
collimators give the appropriate shape to the neutron beam.

There are about 1.2 × 105 neutrons per nominal pulse of
7 × 1012 protons between 0.1 eV and 10 keV reaching the
irradiation position. The energy dependence of the neutron
beam was determined with three different detectors [12]: a

1The n_TOF facility was closed at the end of the 2004 campaign. It
was opened again in 2009 (Phase-II), with a different lead block and
coolant circuit, which are the ones described here.

MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF THE 241Am … PHYSICAL REVIEW C 97, 054616 (2018)

hemisphere of the neutron absorber are not shown.

silicon flux monitor [13] (SiMon), a Micromegas gas detector
[14], and a calibrated fission chamber from Physikalisch
Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) [15], which are based on
the 6Li(n,t), 10B(n,α) and 235U(n,f ) standard reactions [16],
respectively. The first two detectors were in place during
the 241Am(n,γ ) measurement. The spatial distribution of the
neutron beam at the irradiation position can be approximated
by a two-dimensional (2D) Gaussian distribution with σx =
σy = 0.62 cm and does not vary significantly in the studied
energy range [17,18]. The TOF response function, described
in Ref. [7], is not very different from the one of the n_TOF
Phase-I, whose more detailed description can be found in
Ref. [19].

B. The detection system

To detect the 241Am(n,γ ) events we used the n_TOF TAC
[20]. This detector, shown in Fig. 1, consists of 40 BaF2 crystals
of 15 cm in length covering ∼95% of the solid angle and is
used to detect in coincidence (nearly) all the γ rays coming
from the capture reactions. Each crystal is covered with two
layers of 0.1-mm-thick Teflon foil and a 0.1-mm-thick polished
aluminum sheet on the outside, to optimize the light collection.
The crystals are also enclosed in 1-mm-thick 10B loaded carbon
fiber capsules aimed at absorbing the scattered neutrons. Each
of these capsules is coupled with an aluminum cylinder that
houses a 12.7-cm Photonis XP4508B photomultiplier and a
special voltage divider made at the Instituto Tecnológico e
Nuclear in Lisbon that favors a fast signal recovery. The
complete modules are attached to an aluminum honeycomb
structure that holds the complete assembly. A neutron absorber
made of borated polyethylene of 5- and 10-cm inner and outer
radii, respectively, was placed in the center of the geometry,
covering the inner surface of the TAC.

The intensity of the neutron beam was monitored during the
entire 241Am(n,γ ) campaign with the above-mentioned silicon
flux monitor [13], which was mounted about 2 m upstream of

the sample. This detector was used to normalize the different
measurements to their total neutron beam intensity and also to
confirm the stability of the energy profile of the neutron beam.

The detector signals were recorded by a digital data ac-
quisition system [21] based on Acqiris-DC270 digitizers with
8-bit resolution and operating most of the measurement at
250 MSamples/s, recording continuously for 32 ms for each
neutron pulse, corresponding to a minimum neutron energy
of 180 meV. Part of the measurement was performed with
the digitizers operating at 500 MSamples/s, thus recording
for 16 ms, corresponding to a minimum neutron energy of
0.7 eV. The data buffers were analyzed offline with dedicated
pulse shape reconstruction algorithms. The algorithm used to
analyze the BaF2 signals returns for each signal the TOF, the
area, and other parameters used to distinguish the detected
particle type: γ or α (the latter is produced by the decay of
Ra impurities in the crystals). The algorithm is described in
detail in Ref. [22], and a more accessible reference of a similar
routine is Ref. [23].

Each BaF2 detector was calibrated in energy from mea-
surements performed with standard γ -ray sources (137Cs, 88Y,
and Am/Be), and the gain drifts were monitored throughout
the entire measurement with the position of peaks due to the
detection of α particles. An energy threshold of 300 keV was
applied to each BaF2 detector. This corresponds to the lowest
value for which the energy calibration spectra were success-
fully reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations. The individual
signals were grouped into TAC events using a coincidence
window of 20 ns. Each TAC event is characterized by its TOF,
total deposited energy (Esum) and crystal multiplicity (mcr),
which is the number of detectors contributing to an event. The
Esum and mcr values are used to apply cuts to the detected
events in order to improve the capture-to-background ratio. In
this paper, the word event always refers to these TAC events.

C. The 241Am and auxiliary samples and measurements

Thin powder samples of actinide oxides suffer from inho-
mogeneities [24–26] which can affect the resonance integrals
(convolution with the neutron beam and self-shielding) and
shape (due to self-shielding effects). For this reason, we took
advantage of the technique developed at the Institute for
Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU) in Karlsruhe for producing
homogeneous samples of actinide oxides mixed with an inert
matrix. The sample was part of a set of 11 241Am samples
produced by the JRC-ITU [27] for neutron total [5], capture
[4,5], and (n,2n) [28] cross section measurements. Ten of these
samples used Al2O3 as inert matrix and the other one used
Y2O3. Both Y and Al materials have similar properties from
the neutronic point of view but for measuring above 1 keV
Al has the advantage that resonances start at higher energies.
The sample used for this experiment was made of 36.5 mg of
241AmO2 infiltrated into a 305-mg Al2O3 matrix.

The fabrication procedure was as follows. Very small (10-
to 100-μm) and porous alumina beads were introduced into a
solution of the actinide in nitric acid. After some time, the
beads absorbed a certain amount of actinide nitrates. Then
the beads were dried and calcined, leading to a disperse
mixture of AmO2 inside the inert matrix. The powder was

then pressed into a pellet of 342 mg and 12.26 mm in diam-
eter for ensuring the mechanical stability, and encapsulated
inside a 0.5-mm-thick Al canning. The mixture obtained in
this way is very homogeneous, as it has been confirmed by
different characterization techniques such as nondestructive x-
ray radiographies or destructive α-particle autoradiographies,
performed on slices of the pellets during the development of
the methodology.

The 241Am mass of the sample used in this work was
32.23(19) mg. The total amount of 241Am was determined by
calorimetry at JRC Karlsruhe. The rest of the 241Am samples
were prepared in a similar way, but with different 241Am
contents. The masses of seven of these samples, none of
them used in this work, were also measured at the JRC-Ispra
[29], finding an excellent agreement with the measurements
of the mass performed at JRC-ITU. Concerning impurities
present in the sample, we detected 237Np (∼0.9 mg) and 240Pu
(∼0.016 mg) during the resonance analysis. For the analysis
the measured room temperature, 296 ± 3 K, was taken as
sample temperature.

The sample was placed in the center of the TAC, glued on a
50-μm-thick kapton foil mounted in an aluminum ring with a
diameter larger than the neutron beam. Due to the high sample
activity (∼4 GBq), a 2-mm-thick Pb layer was placed around
the neutron beam at the position of the sample in order to
strongly reduce the amount of γ rays originating in the sample
decay and reaching the TAC.

To determine the background, additional measurements
with other samples were carried out. The list of samples
included a dummy sample including the Al canning plus the
Al2O3 matrix, the Al canning, and a graphite sample 12 mm
in diameter and 6 mm thick, which is used to determine
the TAC response to sample scattered neutrons. We also
performed measurements without beam and without sample
(no sample, beam off), without beam but with the sample in
place (241Am, beam off), and with neutron beam but without
any sample. In addition, three 197Au samples were measured
for normalization purposes. The number of pulses and total
number of counts in the silicon flux monitor allocated to each
of these measurements are summarized in Table I.

previous measurements performed with the TAC [30–32].

and different background measurements. The data correspond to
neutron energies between 1 and 10 eV and no cuts on mcr have been
applied to the detected events.

The capture yield is the fraction of incident neu-
trons that induce a (n,γ ) reaction and can be determined
experimentally as

Yn,γ (En) =
Ctot(En) − Cbkg(En)

ε(En)φ(En)
, (1)

where En is the neutron energy, Ctot(En) and Cbkg(En) are
the number of total and background counts registered by the
TAC, respectively, under certain Esum and mcr cuts, ε(En) is the
corresponding detection efficiency, and φ(En) is the intensity
of the neutron beam intercepted by the sample.

A. Background and selection of cuts in the detected events

Background events in the 241Am(n,γ ) measurement can be
attributed to two contributions: (i) events coming from neutron
reactions in the 241Am nuclei, i.e., fission and elastic scattering,
and (ii) the rest of the background, which results from the
environmental background, the activity of the BaF2 crystals,
the sample activity, and the interaction of the neutron beam
with all the materials except the 241Am nuclei.

The latter contribution could be, in principle, obtained
directly from the different background measurements sum-
marized in Table I. The response of the TAC resulting from
some of these measurements together with the one from
a measurement with the 241Am sample, in terms of total
deposited energy Esum, is presented in Fig. 2. A maximum
deposited energy from 241Am(n,γ ) cascades is just above the
neutron separation energy of 242Am, Sn(

242Am) = 5.5 MeV.
Other visible contributions are the 27Al(n,γ ) reaction, with
Sn(

28Al) = 7.7 MeV, and the (n,γ ) and (n,α) reactions in
1H and 10B, respectively. The difference between the two
measurements performed without the neutron beam is due to
the sample activity, whose main contribution above 1 MeV is
due to the interaction of the α particles coming from the decay
of the 241Am with the 27Al of the Al2O3 matrix [33].

FIG. 3. Number of events detected per pulse and per unit per
unit lethargy (�LnE, which means that the bin contents have been
divided by the natural logarithm of the ratio between the upper and
lower bin limits) in the 241Am(n,γ ) measurement as a function of the
neutron energy, together with different background measurements.
Only mcr > 1 and 2.5 < Esum < 6 MeV events are shown.

From Fig. 2 it is easy to see that the capture-to-background
ratio is significantly improved if the low (Esum < 1 MeV)
and high (Esum > 6 MeV) energy events are excluded from
the analysis. This holds also for restrictions on mcr, be-
cause capture events have higher average multiplicity than
the background ones. However, the more restricted the cuts
are, the lower the detection efficiency becomes. In addition,
there are pile-up effects induced by the high background
counting rate which affect the detection of the capture signals
(Sec. III B), and the more restricted the cuts are, the more
important these effects become. A detailed analysis led to the
optimum cuts of mcr > 2 and 2.5 < Esum < 6 MeV, which
were adopted in the present analysis. However, the capture
yield has also been obtained for five additional combinations of
cuts: 2.5 < Esum < 6 MeV and 3 < Esum < 5 MeV, combined
with mcr > 0, mcr > 1, and mcr > 2. The differences between
the six different yields were used to estimate uncertainties due
to systematic effects in the results.

The number of events detected per proton pulse for the
same measurements as in Fig. 2, but with additional cuts in
Esum and mcr, are presented in Fig. 3 as a function of neutron
energy. The difference between the measurements performed
with the dummy and the Al canning samples should show
only the effect of the interaction of the neutron beam with
the Al2O3 matrix. However, the results in Fig. 3 reveal that
an unexpected resonant behavior appears in the spectrum
of the dummy sample. These resonances are due to Sm
contamination. This contamination most likely comes from
a glue used to repair the dummy sample, since it broke down
before this 241Am(n,γ ) measurement was performed. Owing
to this Sm contamination the background contribution of the
Al2O3 matrix could not be deduced directly from the dedicated
background measurements, and some corrections which are
described below were needed.

The background components due to the Al canning and
Al2O3 matrix both have two components related to capture

and neutron elastic scattering reactions in Al. The capture
components are proportional to energy dependence of the
Al(n,γ ) cross section, which at neutron energies of our
interest is in first approximation proportional to the inverse
of the neutron speed, i.e., E

−1/2
n . The elastic components

should have the same neutron energy dependence for both
materials. From these assumptions it follows that BAl2O3 (En) =

n + βBAlcanning(En), where α and β are constants and

BAl2O3 and BAlcanning are the background components related to
the interaction of the neutron beam with the Al2O3 matrix and
with the Al canning, respectively. BAlcanning was easily obtained
from the dedicated background measurements, and the α and β
parameters were obtained by fitting BAl2O3 (En) + B(Sm) to re-
produce the measurement performed with the dummy sample.
B(Sm) represents the contribution of the Sm impurities, which
was deduced from the Sm(n,γ ) cross sections taken from the
evaluated libraries. The resulting background is presented in
Fig. 4. We used the background calculated in this way only up
to 80 eV, where the influence of Sm impurities is quite strong
in the resonance peaks and negligible in the valleys. Above
80 eV the contribution of the Sm is below 1%, so we took the
background calculated from the dummy sample measurement,
after subtracting the Sm contribution.

The background related to elastic and fission reactions in the
241Am nuclei was estimated from the evaluated cross sections
and the probability of detecting a scattered neutron and a fission
reaction. The former probability, which depends on the neutron
energy and on the Esum and mcr cuts, was obtained from the
graphite sample measurement, under the assumption that the
response of the TAC to neutrons scattered in carbon does not
differ much from the response to neutrons scattered in 241Am.
The probability of detecting a 241Am(n,f ) event was assumed
to be similar to the probability of detecting a 235U(n,f ) event,
which was determined in a 235U(n,γ ) measurement performed
with the n_TOF TAC and a fission tagging detector [34]. Both
contributions are very low in the energy range of interest
and none of them introduces a sizable uncertainty in the
measured 241Am(n,γ ) cross section. In particular, the fission
cross section of 241Am is about 200 times lower than the
capture cross section. The background due to the elastically
scattered neutrons is also very low—less than 1% with respect

to the capture reactions in the neutron energy range of interest
for mcr > 1 or mcr > 2 cuts. For mcr > 0 the contribution is
smaller than 1% only below 1 keV, and goes up to 2.5% at
10 keV.

B. Detection efficiency

The detection efficiency has been calculated from Monte
Carlo simulations. The capture γ -ray cascades were generated
with the DECAYGEN code [35], and transported into the TAC
geometry (see Fig. 1) with a code based on the GEANT4
toolkit [36,37]. The results of the Monte Carlo code were
then reconstructed in the same way as in the real experiment,
including all the experimental effects such as the energy
resolution of the crystals or the pile-up effects. The capture
cascades generated by DECAYGEN depend on statistical models
for the description of the level densities and photon strength
functions. These models depend on some parameters, which
were adjusted to reproduce the experimental deposited energy
distributions for various mcr cuts. The quality of the results
is illustrated in Fig. 5. A detailed description of the entire
process is given in Ref. [38], and the method was also used
in Refs. [31,32].

We did not find any significant difference in the shape of the
deposited energy spectra among several resonances (Fig. 6),
and thus it was assumed that the detection efficiency depends
only on the applied cuts for Esum and mcr and not on the energy
of the captured neutron. In addition, we know from previous
works [38] that sizable differences in the Esum distributions
lead to very small variations in the reconstructed efficiency.
There is, however, a dependence of the detection efficiency on
the TOF via pile-up effects, which are described below. The
calculated efficiency values for the six different cuts used in
this analysis are presented in Table II.

For the estimation of the uncertainties in the detection effi-
ciencies two main components were considered, as described
in Refs. [38–40]: one related to the generation of capture
cascades and other related to the uncertainties of the TAC

geometry. The first component was estimated by performing
multiple simulations with different EM deexcitation patterns
for the capture cascades and observing when the simulated
spectra deviate from the experimental data. The second com-
ponent was estimated by varying the geometry parameters
and calculating the impact of such variations on the detection
efficiencies.

Concerning the pile-up effects, two different situations were
considered. The first one is related to the high counting rate
in the TAC due to capture cascades in the sample. This effect
is very small (�1%) for the 241Am(n,γ ) cascades; however,
it must be corrected for in the 4.9 eV saturated resonance
of 197Au, which is used for normalization (see Sec. III C).
To correct for these pile-up effects we used the third method
described and validated in Ref. [41].

FIG. 7. One minus the fraction of events lost (flosses) due to the
pile-up induced by the background, as a function of the neutron energy
and for three different Esum and mcr cuts.

The second pile-up effect is induced by the high counting
rate due to the background related to the neutron beam, which
is a function of TOF and is the dominant component of the
background except at the lowest neutron energies. When this
counting rate becomes high enough (hundreds of counts per
millisecond) then the background signals pile up with capture
signals, thus modifying the probability of detecting them. We
developed a new method of correcting for this effect which
is based on the same methodology as in Ref. [41], i.e., in the
offline manipulation of the digitized signals. In this case we
copied the digitized signals obtained at low neutron energies
(i.e., detected under a low background counting rate, with
negligible pile-up) to a different TOF position in the digitized
data buffer, corresponding to higher neutron energies and
thus with higher background counting rates. The resulting
artificially created data buffers were analyzed afterwards with
the pulse shape reconstruction algorithms used for the standard
analysis of the experiment. By comparing the results of the
analyses obtained for the same signal but placed in different
TOF positions in the digitized data buffers, it is possible to
characterize the pile-up effects due to the background. This
methodology will be described in more detail in a future
publication [42].

The corrections of the capture yields due to this effect for
three of the six different Esum and mcr cuts are presented in
Fig. 7 as a function of the neutron energy. As shown, the more
restrictive the cuts in Esum and mcr applied to the detected
events are, the higher is the fraction of events lost due to the
background induced pile-up.

C. Normalization

The measurement was normalized by means of the saturated
resonance method [43] to the strongest 197Au resonance at 4.9
eV. For this purpose we used three different 197Au samples,
two of them with different thicknesses (250 and 50 μm) and
with the same diameter as the 241Am sample (12.2 mm),
and a third one with 50 μm thickness and a larger diameter

covering the entire neutron beam. The three 197Au samples
were measured with the nominal neutron beam intensity and
also with an intensity 2.3 times smaller. The comparison with
different count rates validated the pulse pile-up corrections, as
shown in Fig. 8. The measurement performed with the third
197Au sample cannot be directly used to normalize, since it
has a different diameter than the 241Am sample. However, it
can be included in the comparison and used to validate the
pile-up corrections after re-normalizing it to the measurement
performed with the sample with the same thickness but
smaller radius. This renormalization was performed in the tail
of the 197Au resonance, where no pulse pile-up corrections are
needed.

In Table III we present the normalization factors obtained
from the different 197Au measurements. In all the cases we used
the measurement performed with the thicker 197Au sample
(sample 1) and with low intensity pulses to normalize the
yields. Each of these normalization factors was obtained for

different Esum and mcr cuts. The values and uncertainties in
Table III are the mean and the standard deviation of the results
of each case, respectively. All the normalization factors are
compatible within two standard deviations. The measurement
performed with the nominal neutron beam intensity and the
largest diameter 197Au sample was not used because the pile-up
correction method cannot handle the instantaneous counting
rate as high as about four events per microsecond.

The uncertainty in the normalization was estimated taking
into account both the spread of the values and the uncertainties
in Table III, obtaining an uncertainty of 1.5%. To this value
we added the uncertainty due to the 197Au(n,γ ) detection
efficiency. As for 241Am, it is estimated from the uncertainties
associated with the generation of capture cascades (0.7% for
197Au) and of the simulated TAC geometry. However, the
uncertainty due to the TAC geometry was not added in this
case since it was already included in the uncertainty of the
241Am(n,γ ) detection efficiency, and it propagates in the same
way, introducing a strong correlation between both detection
efficiencies. If we make a quadratic sum of both quantities we
obtain a total uncertainty of 1.7% in the normalization to the
saturated resonance of 197Au.

D. Uncertainties

The uncertainties due to systematic effects in the capture
yield were estimated in the following way. The quantities with
larger uncertainties which affect the normalization process are
the detection efficiency (2%), the normalization to the saturated
resonance of 197Au discussed in the previous section (1.7%),
and the sample mass (0.6%). If we make a quadratic sum of
these quantities we obtain a total normalization uncertainty of
2.7%.

In addition to the normalization uncertainty we have to
consider the energy dependent uncertainty on the neutron
fluence shape, which is 1% below 100 eV and 2% between
100 eV and 10 keV [12].

Other sources of uncertainty come from the determination
of the background and from the pile-up corrections. We
estimated the uncertainty due to both these effects at the same
time from the differences between the resulting capture yields
obtained with the different Esum and mcr cuts. In particular, we
estimated it as the standard deviation calculated from the six
different resulting yields. The result is presented in Fig. 9, as
a function of neutron energy, together with the corresponding
relative uncertainties due to counting statistics. Note that the
size of the latter depends largely on the width of the neutron

smaller in the standard deviation. The increase of the values at
∼6 keV is due to the first 27Al resonance.

IV. CROSS SECTION ANALYSIS

A. Analysis of the resolved resonance region

The resolved resonance region (RRR) was analyzed with the
SAMMY code (version 8.0.0) [19]. In the most recent evaluated
libraries the RRR extends up to 150–160 eV, but we performed
a resonance analysis up to 700 eV. We have fitted, using the
Reich-Moore approximation, the energy E0 and the neutron
width 	n of each resonance, and the radiative capture width
	γ only when its uncertainty due to counting statistics was
less than 10%. The resonance parameters of the negative
resonances, the scattering radius, and all fission widths were
taken from the JEFF-3.2 evaluation [44], after verifying that
large variations of these parameters do not affect the resulting
capture yield significantly. It was confirmed by the techniques
described in Ref. [45] that all the resonances observed in the
investigated energy range were s-wave resonances. As it was
not possible to distinguish the total spin values J = 2,3, only
the g	n values were determined, with g = (2J+1)(2I+1)(2j+1) , where
J , I = 5/2 and j = 1/2 are the spins of the resonance, target
nucleus, and neutron, respectively. The time-to-energy relation
was obtained by adjusting the n_TOF time-of-flight effective
distance to reproduce the energies of the resonances of 197Au
in the JEFF-3.2 evaluation, yielding 185.59(2) m.

Note that above a certain energy we are not fitting individual
resonances but clusters of resonances in many cases, since it
is not possible to resolve them accurately. However, having a
resonant description of the cross section up to higher energies
is useful for more accurate self-shielding calculations.

Together with the 241Am resonances, we included in the
SAMMY input the 237Np and 240Pu impurities and the 16O
and 27Al of the AmO2 compound and the Al2O3 matrix.
16O and 27Al were included only to properly calculate self-
shielding and multiple scattering effects. Detection efficiency
for their cascades was set to zero, since their contributions
were included in the calculation of the background. Indeed,

FIG. 10. Examples of the fitted n_TOF capture yield, in different energy ranges. The data points correspond to the experimental capture

we studied in detail the self-shielding and multiple scattering
effects by comparing calculations performed with SAMMY,
MCNP-6.1 [46], and GEANT4. In these calculations we obtained
the theoretical capture yield under different conditions: with
and without the Al canning, and with and without the Al2O3
matrix. We found that the results obtained with the three codes
are in a reasonable agreement, better than 0.5%. They showed
that the effect of the Al canning is negligible; the effect of the
Al2O3 matrix introduces an increase in the number of detected
capture events by ∼1.5%, nearly constantly in the energy range
of interest, and that the self-shielding due to the 241Am itself
is small (<2%) except for the first three resonances, where it
is around 10%. The n_TOF capture yield is presented together
with the results of the SAMMY fit for several neutron energy
ranges in Fig. 10.

We obtained the mean values of the resonance parameters
and their uncertainties due to counting statistics from the
SAMMY analysis performed with the optimum cuts of mcr > 2
and 2.5 < Esum < 6 MeV, together with their correlations.
Total uncertainty of the resonance parameters due to systematic
effects is given by three contributions: (i) the uncertainties due
to systematic effects of the experimental yield (Sec. III D),

(ii) the uncertainty in the temperature of the sample, and (iii)
the uncertainty due to the Doppler broadening model used in
the fitting procedure.

Concerning contribution (i), we performed independent
resonance analysis for each of the six experimental data sets
resulting from the different cuts mentioned before in order to
take into account the contributions due to the determination
of the background and due to the pile-up corrections. The
uncertainty of each fitted parameter due to these two effects was
estimated as the standard deviation of the different fitted values.
An additional 2.7% normalization uncertainty was added to
the g	n parameters, since the area of each resonance is in
good approximation proportional to g	n when capture is the
dominant reaction.

The last two contributions, (ii) and (iii), were estimated by
performing fits with three different sample temperatures, 293,
296, and 299 K, and with two different Doppler broadening
models, the free gas model (FGM) and the crystal-lattice model
(CLM) [19]. In the latter case, we used the phonon spectrum
of UO2 (SAMMY example file t124f.clm), since it has not been
measured for AmO2. In both cases the uncertainties of each
fitted parameter were estimated as the standard deviation of the

different fitted values. The mean values were obtained using
296 K and the CLM for the Doppler broadening.

The values of the fitted resonance parameters are presented
in Tables VI and VII. The 	γ values with uncertainties due to
counting statistics larger than 10% were fixed to the average
radiative capture width, which was calculated from the rest
of the values. The quadratic sum of all the uncertainties due
to systematic effects but the one due to the normalization are
provided as well. Above 52 eV, all 	γ values were fixed to
〈	γ,0〉 = 45.4 meV; thus only the energies and g	n values are
given in Table VII.

The average radiation width 〈	γ,0〉 was determined from
the fitted values listed in Table VI. The resulting value was
〈	γ,0〉 = 45.4 ± 0.2 ± 1.1 ± 0.4 meV, where the uncertainties
are, respectively, due to the uncertainties in the individual 	γ
parameters due to the counting statistics, to Doppler broaden-
ing, and to the sample temperature. The rest of the contributions
to uncertainties are negligible. The quadratic sum of all these
uncertainties gives a final value of 〈	γ,0〉 = 45.4 ± 1.2 meV.

The neutron strength function for s-wave resonances S0 was
obtained as S0 =

∑
λ g

n,λ/�E and �S0/S0 =

√
2/N [47],

with �E the width of the energy interval considered and N the
number of resonances in this interval. The resulting value is
S0 × 104 = 1.25 ± 0.07 ± 0.03 ± 0.02, where the uncertain-
ties are, respectively, due to the number of resonances used
in the calculation, to the normalization, and to the remaining
systematic effects of the capture yield. The quadratic sum of
all these uncertainties gives a final value of S0 × 104 = 1.25 ±
0.08. For the calculation of S0 we considered resonances only
up to 400 eV, since the resonance analysis is less precise as
the energy increases. However, the results obtained at higher
energies are compatible within uncertainties, as presented in
Fig. 11.

An estimation of the s-wave average level spacing D0
can be obtained, from D0 = �E/(N − 1) [47], where N is
the number of resonances observed in the neutron energy
interval between E1 and E2 and �E = E2 − E1. However,
the smallest resonances are usually not detected (missing
resonances), and their number has to be estimated as well.
This was done by assuming that the values of the reduced

This formula can be used to estimate the number of missing
resonances by fitting the value of D0, as it is presented in
Fig. 12.

An alternative method we used was to generate by Monte
Carlo several artificial resonance sequences from the val-
ues of S0 and 〈	γ,0〉 obtained in this work and different
values of D0. We used the same analysis procedure as in
Ref. [48]. From the comparison of the simulations with the
experimental results we obtained D0 = 0.56 ± 0.04 eV, which
is fully compatible with the values of D0 derived from the
previous method.

B. Analysis of the unresolved resonance region

The analysis of the unresolved resonance region (URR)
was performed with the SAMMY code, which contains a mod-
ified version of the FITACS code [19,49], which uses Hauser-
Feshbach theory [50] with width fluctuation corrections. To
perform the analysis we used the capture cross section instead
of the reaction yield, as it is required by SAMMY in the
URR. As we mentioned in Sec. IV A, we studied in detail the
self-shielding and multiple scattering effects in the sample by
performing several Monte Carlo simulations. We concluded
that above 150 eV the self-shielding and multiple scattering
effects due to reactions in 241Am are negligible (<0.3%), and
that the effect of the Al2O3 matrix is an increase of the number
of detected capture events by 1.5%. Thus, the cross section was
obtained by dividing the capture yield by the sample thickness
n and by 1.015: 〈σγ (En)〉 = 〈Yγ (En)〉/(n × 1.015).

FIG. 13. Measured (markers) and fitted (solid line) n_TOF cap-

a shadowed area. The cross sections provided by the JEFF-3.2,
ENDF/B-VII.1, and JENDL-4.0 evaluations, which are very similar,
are also plotted.

The analysis of the URR was performed by fixing D0 and
〈	γ,0〉 to the values obtained from the statistical analysis of
the RRR, since they cannot be determined with a reasonable
accuracy from the URR, and by fitting S0. The p-wave contri-
bution starts to be more important at higher energies, and other
parameters such as the channel radius or R∞l cannot be deter-
mined from this measurement. The analysis was performed
with the six different cuts in Esum and mcr mentioned above,
and also considering different neutron energy ranges for the de-
termination of S0. This allowed us to estimate different sources
of uncertainty.

The obtained value was S0 × 104 = 1.19 ± 0.03 ± 0.03 ±
0.02 ± 0.05, where the uncertainties are due to the normaliza-
tion, to the sensitivity of the result to the neutron energy range
chosen for the fit, to the uncertainties in D0 and 〈	γ,0〉, and
to the Esum and mcr cuts, respectively. The latest contribution
represents mainly the uncertainty due to the pile-up corrections
(Fig. 9). The uncertainty derived from counting statistics is
negligible in this case. A quadratic sum of these uncertainties
leads to a final value of S0 × 104 = 1.19 ± 0.07, which is in
a perfect agreement with the one obtained from the RRR,
S0,RRR × 104 = 1.25 ± 0.08.

The resulting fitted cross section in the URR is shown
in Fig. 13, together with the values present in different
evaluations. The differences between the cross sections in
different evaluations are very small, but they differ significantly
from the results of this work in the lower energy range. In
particular, we obtained a cross section which is around 20%
higher than the evaluated ones below 1 keV and which becomes
compatible with them at a few keV.

capture reaction dominates over the other reaction channels
(elastic scattering and fission) and these ratios correspond in
good approximation to the capture cross section ratios (at
resonances).

Figure 14 indicates that our results are in a reasonable
agreement with those provided by Lampoudis et al., especially
if we consider the uncertainties due to normalization, which
are 2.7% (this work) and 2.0% (Lampoudis et al. [5]). On
the contrary, our results are between 10% and 40% higher
than the ones provided by Fraval et al. [4], Jandel et al. [52],
Kalebin et al. [56], and Derrien and Lucas [57].

The data from Weston and Todd [55] were normalized to
an evaluated thermal 241Am(n,γ ) cross section, so only the
energy dependence of the cross section is comparable with our
data. Slaughter et al. [58] also reported resonance parameters,
but the uncertainties are so large that a comparison is not very
informative.

The differences in data are reflected in the resonance pa-
rameters found in evaluated libraries. The evaluation present in
JEFF-3.2 adopts essentially the results provided by Lampoudis

JENDL-4.0 evaluation in the RRR.

Additional information concerning the capture cross sec-
tion in the few-eV neutron energy range can be obtained
from direct measurements of the resonance integral I0, I0 =∫ ∞
Ec

σγ (E)/EdE, with Ec usually being taken as 0.5 eV. In the

case of the 241Am(n,γ ) cross section the contribution of the
first three resonances to I0 is∼75%, whereas the value of the in-
tegral above 20 eV represents less than 10%, according to
parameters from JEFF-3.2. The product from the 241Am(n,γ )
reaction can be either the isomer (242mAm) or the ground state
(242gAm). We can define the resonance integrals I

g
0 and I

m
0

feeding these states, respectively. The total resonance integral
is given by I0 = Im0 + I

g
0 . Depending on the experimental

technique, the integral experiments provide either all three
resonance integrals [63–65,67], the total resonance integral
[66], or the resonance integral feeding the ground state [68–70].

The results from these integral measurements are listed in
Table V, together with I0 values derived from TOF data. The
uncertainties presented in the I0 values obtained in this work
are due to the normalization (2.7%). This work and JEFF-3.2
(based on Lampoudis et al.) values are fully compatible with
the values provided by Shinohara et al. and Gavrilov et al.,
whereas the I0 from Fraval et al. and Jandel et al. are 15–20%

smaller. On the contrary, the last two are closer (only 5–10%
larger) to Harbour et al. than this work and JEFF-3.2 results,
which are 25% larger. The value from Hellstrand et al. does not
seem to be compatible with any of the TOF measurements. The
data from Bak et al. are 2.5 standard deviations larger than this
work and JEFF-3.2 and more than three standard deviations
larger than the rest of the TOF data.

The I
g
0 cannot be directly compared with the TOF data.

However, the result provided by Maidana et al. [69] is com-
patible with the data of Shinohara et al. and Gavrilov et al.,
confirming them in a certain way. The value provided by
Nakamura et al. [68] cannot be compared with any of the
other integral measurements, since their value for Ec is 0.107
eV. To compare it with the TOF data we can scale it by
the I0/I

g
0 factors from Shinohara et al. and Gavrilov et al.,

obtaining 3700 and 4000 b, respectively. Both values are in
good agreement with JEFF-3.2, and the lowest value also with
this work and JENDL-4.0 (1.3 standard deviations). The values
from Fraval et al. and Jandel et al. are 2.7 and 2.0 standard
deviations below, respectively. Finally, the value of Deal et al.
[70] is not compatible with any other measurement.

In order to extend the comparison to higher energies we
compare the ratios of our and previously published cross
sections in Fig. 15. Presented error bars correspond only
to uncertainties due to counting statistics in all cases but
Jandel et al., where uncertainties due to systematic effects
are also included. For a correct interpretation of Fig. 15 the
uncertainties due to systematic effects have to be considered
as well. In our case, in addition to the 2.7% normalization
uncertainty, there is an extra 4–8% uncertainty in the keV
energy region (Fig. 9). The conclusions that can be drawn are
the following:

(1) The results reported by Fraval et al. are not compatible
with ours. Note that both results were obtained from
measurements performed with the same sample and at
the same facility, but using different detection methods.

(2) Harada et al. measured only the shape of the
241Am(n,γ ) cross section up to 100 eV, and it seems
to be compatible with our results. Data represented in
Fig. 15, taken from Ref. [71], are normalized to the
JENDL-4.0 thermal cross section (684 b). If we renor-
malize them to the thermal cross section provided by
JEFF-3.2 (747 b) our and Harada et al.’s cross sections
are compatible both in shape and in absolute value. A
recent measurement of the 241Am(n,γ ) thermal cross
section performed in the Minerve reactor [72] seems to
confirm the value from JEFF-3.2. There is also a recent
work which reviews previous thermal cross section
measurements [73], and gives the value of 720(14) b.

(3) The cross section from Jandel et al. has a similar shape
to ours below 1 keV, but is 15% smaller. Above 1 keV,
both results are quite compatible.

(4) The cross sections from Vanpraet et al. and Weston
and Todd are not compatible with ours, either in shape
or in absolute value below around 0.5 keV. On the
contrary, above 0.5–1 keV the three cross sections are
compatible.

obtained in this work and the ones obtained in previous measurements
and evaluations. Only uncertainties due to counting statistics have
been considered in all cases but Jandel et al., where uncertainties due
to systematic effects are also included.

(5) The uncertainties in the cross section from Gayther
et al. are very large, but it seems clear that the shape of
the cross section is different than ours.

(6) The cross section from JEFF-3.2, which adopts mainly
the results from Lampoudis et al. below 100 eV, is quite
compatible in absolute value with our results at low
neutron energies. However, there are sizable differences
in the shape: at 0.2 eV our results are 7% lower, at
10 eV they are similar, and at 150 eV our results are
12% higher. Above 160 eV, i.e., in the URR in the
evaluation, the trend goes in the opposite direction:
the results of this work are 30% higher at 300 eV and
the disagreement gradually decreases with the neutron
energy, being compatible above 5 keV.

(7) The cross section from JENDL-4.0, which was adopted
in ENDF/B-VII.1 in the RRR, below 150 eV, and very
similar in the URR, is not so different from ours at the
lowest and highest energies. However, it differs up to
30% at intermediate neutron energies.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The 241Am neutron capture cross section was measured at
n_TOF using the segmented BaF2 Total Absorption Calorime-
ter in the energy range between 0.2 eV and 10 keV. The
uncertainties due to counting statistics in the resulting capture
yield are relatively small. The uncertainties due to systematic
effects are 2.7% due to the normalization plus, on average,
around 1% below 100 eV, around 2–3% between 100 eV and
1 keV, and around 4–8% between 1 and 10 keV, due to the
pile-up corrections and the determination of the background.

A resolved resonance analysis was performed on the result-
ing capture yield up to 700 eV, which is significantly higher
than 150–160 eV, the upper limit of the RRR of the present
evaluated libraries. This allows a more precise description of
the cross section useful for more accurate self-shielding cal-
culations. Statistical analysis of resonance parameters yielded
〈	γ,0〉 = 45.4 ± 1.2 meV, D0 = 0.56 ± 0.04 eV, and S0,RRR ×
104 = 1.25 ± 0.08.

The cross section obtained at higher energies, in the URR,
is fully consistent with the predictions based on these average
resonance parameters, thus obtaining a consistent description
of the cross section in the full neutron energy range under
study. In particular, by fixing the 〈	γ,0〉 and D0 to the values
obtained from the RRR we obtained a neutron strength function
S0,URR × 104 = 1.19 ± 0.07.

At low neutron energies our results are in reasonable agree-
ment with the ones obtained by Lampoudis et al., adopted by
JEFF-3.2, and differ by around 20% from other experimental
data [4,52,56,57]. Our results are also compatible with the
results obtained by Harada et al. if they are normalized to
the thermal cross section of JEFF-3.2. Our results are also
compatible with most of the direct measurements of the
resonance integral I0, unlike other time-of-flight results.

Between 100 eV and 1 keV the disagreement with other
experimental data and evaluations gradually decreases, in
general, with the neutron energy. Above 1 keV our results are
in reasonable agreement with most of the other experimental
data and evaluations.
