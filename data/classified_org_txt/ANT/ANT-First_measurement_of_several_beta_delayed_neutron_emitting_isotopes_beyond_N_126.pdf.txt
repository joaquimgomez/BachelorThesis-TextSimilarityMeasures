The β-delayed neutron emission probabilities of neutron rich Hg and Tl nuclei have been measured
together with β-decay half-lives for 20 isotopes of Au, Hg, Tl, Pb, and Bi in the mass region N ≳ 126.
These are the heaviest species where neutron emission has been observed so far. These measurements
provide key information to evaluate the performance of nuclear microscopic and phenomenological models
in reproducing the high-energy part of the β-decay strength distribution. This provides important
constraints on global theoretical models currently used in r-process nucleosynthesis.

The rapid neutron capture (r) process of nucleosynthesis
represents a challenge and a constant source of motivation

for theory, experiments, and observations. Two paradigms
are involved from the theory side, namely, the modeling of
suitable cataclysmic astrophysical environments and the
modeling of the atomic nucleus. Both of them are required
if we are to understand the origin of heavy elements as they
are observed in the oldest stars, our solar system, and the
Galaxy [1]. Two potential candidates for the r-process site
are core-collapse supernovae, and mergers of either two

neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole [2–8].
However, we face fundamental difficulties in ascribing
either of them as the site of the stellar r process. The latest
hydrodynamical simulations of supernovae and neutrino-
driven winds fail to produce heavy nuclei and, in particular,
the prominent third r-process abundance peak at A ∼ 195
[9]. However, explosions driven by magnetic fields and
rotation may contribute in the early galaxy to the synthesis
of heavy elements [10–12]. On the other hand, neutron
star mergers seem to provide suitable physical conditions
for an r-process environment, but it is still a matter of
discussion whether their contribution came early enough to
explain the r-process abundances observed in the oldest
stars (see, e.g., Refs. [13–17]).
In terms of the nuclear structure, an important step

forward came from the improvements in the theoretical
description of nuclear masses [18–21], as well as micro-
scopic approaches to the β-decay strength function: the
QRPAmodelwith noT ¼ 0proton-neutron pairing employ-
ing theground-state description from the finite-range droplet
model (FRDM) [22], continuum proton-neutron QRPA
based on the self-consistent density functional theory
(DF3þ cQRPA) [23], the interacting shell model [24],
and the fully self-consistent covariant density functional
theory [25]. These studies enabled the realization of the role
of first-forbidden (FF) transitions in shortening the β-decay
half-lives of neutron-rich nuclei near neutron shell closures,
mainly around N ¼ 50, N ¼ 82, and N ¼ 126. One of the
remaining major difficulties for r-process calculations,
aimed at reproducing the solar-system abundance distribu-
tion, lies in the fact that the performance of nuclear models
far from stability and their robustness under extrapolation
have not been tested [6,26,27]. Whereas nuclear masses
(neutron-separation energies) essentially determine the path
of the r-process along the nuclear chart, β-decay rates
determine the speed at which the r-process operates.
Finally, the competition between neutron capture, β-decay,
and β-delayed neutron emission during the r-process
freeze-out shapes the final abundance distribution. The
position and width of the third r-process peak at A ∼ 195
has been found to be particularly sensitive to both the half-
lives and neutron branching ratios of the involved precursor
nuclei around N ¼ 126 [6,27–29].
In this respect, the β-decay strength distribution, which

depends on the quantum structure of mother and daughter
nuclei is particularly sensitive to the details of the nuclear
model. In particular, the transitions to highly excited states
in the Qβ window provide the most stringent test for
microscopic calculations and determine the β-delayed
neutron emission probability (Pn), that can be also com-
puted by phenomenological models [30,31]. Recent efforts
to improve phenomenological models [30,31] are still
affected by uncertainties of about a factor of 2, reaching
in some cases much larger discrepancies. Furthermore, the
absence of nuclear microscopic properties in this kind of

analytical prescription casts doubts on their extrapolation
power, an aspect which can be investigated when new
experimental data are obtained far from the region of
reference. On the other hand, similar discrepancies are
encountered in microscopic and/or macroscopic nuclear
models [18,32] when compared with the available data.
Experimentally β-delayed neutron emission has been

measured for only about 230 nuclei [33] out of the typically
more than 5000 nuclei involved in r-process network
calculations. With the sole exception of 210Tl, for which a
neutron branching ratio of 7ðþ7−4Þ × 10−3% has been reported
[34,35], there exists no othermeasurement in the heavymass
region around N ¼ 126. Indeed, most of the measured
neutron-emitting nuclei correspond to fission products
aroundA ∼ 95 andA ∼ 138. 150La,with a neutron branching
ratio of 2.7(3)% is the heaviest known nucleus with a
substantial amount of neutron emission [36].
The present Letter reports on the first measurement of

several β-delayed neutron emitters beyond N ¼ 126. The
experiment was carried out at the heavy ion research centre
GSI (Germany) using the fragment separator (FRS) in
combination with the BEta-deLayEd Neutron (BELEN)
detector [37]. Indeed, r-process waiting point nuclei for
N ¼ 126 and their direct neighbors are still inaccessible at
present RIB facilities due to the very small production cross
sections, the limited primary beam intensities, and the
challenging background conditions. The next generation
of RIB facilities [38] and advances in production techniques
[39] are aimed at changing this situation in the near future. In
this work we used the high primary beam energy attainable
at GSI with the SIS18 synchrotron, in order to produce and
identify reliably Au-Hg-Tl-Pb-Bi nuclei with N ≳ 126.
These isotopes could be synthesized in sufficient yield by
means of the fragmentation of a 1 GeV=u primary 238U
beam impinging,with an intensity of 2 × 109 ions=pulse, on
a 1.6 g=cm2 Be target. Fragments of interest were separated
and selected with the FRS using the Bρ−ΔE−Bρ
method [40].
Ion tracking and identification was carried out by means

of standard FRS tracking detectors, which comprised two
time-projection chambers (TPC) at the intermediate focal
plane (S2), another two at the final focal plane (S4), two
ionization chambers at S4, and thin plastic scintillators at
both S2 and S4 for measuring the time of flight (TOF). Ion
identification was carried out on an event-by-event basis,
by using the energy loss measured in the ionization
chambers for charge determination and the measured
TOF for determining the mass-over-charge (A=Z) ratio.
Changes in the magnetic rigidity of the ions after the S2
degrader were used to identify and correct for charge states
induced in the wedge [41]. A thin Nb foil was used between
the two ionization chambers in order to induce electron
stripping from possible H- or He-like charge states. By
implementing ion-trajectory corrections enabled by the
TPC measurements, in combination with the TOF and

energy-loss information it was possible to determine the
nuclear charge Z and the A=Z ratio. The final identification
diagram is shown in Fig. 1 for all the events accumulated in
the experiment. An aluminium degrader with adjustable
thickness was used at S4 in order to slow down ions and
implant them into a stack of double-sided silicon strip
detectors called SIMBA [42].
Neutrons were detected using BELEN, which consisted

of an array of 30 3He tubes embedded in a polyethylene
matrix that served as moderator and shielding from the
surrounding background neutrons. GEANT4 [43] and MCNPX
[44] Monte Carlo simulations allowed us to determine the
BELENefficiency as a function of the neutron energy,which
is nearly constant at a value of 40(2)% from thermal neutrons
up to 1 MeV, and decreases to 35% at 5 MeV. The
simulations were validated with dedicated measurements
performed with a 252Cf source. Data from BELEN were
acquired using a digital data acquisition system [45], which
was combined with the GSI local acquisition multibranch
system (MBS) [46]. The latter was used to acquire data from
all tracking detectors and SIMBA. The MBS data acquis-
ition was triggered by a scintillator detector at S4 upstream
of the detector array and by high energy implant and low
energy β-decay events in SIMBA. The digital data acquis-
ition for BELENwas self-triggered. Whenever there was an
electrical signal from any of the 3He tubes, its pulse height
and time stamp were acquired. Both data acquisition
systems generated time stamped data using a common
clock. In this way, ion-implant versus β-decay time corre-
lations and ion-β-neutron time correlations could be built
with a sampling resolution of 10 ns over an arbitrarily long
timewindow and in both forward (increasing) and backward
(decreasing) time directions. By means of implant-β and
implant-β-neutron time correlations in the forward (true and
uncorrelated events) and backward (only uncorrelated
events) directions, it was possible to carry out a binned
maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis [47] and thus determine

β-decay half-lives and β-delayed neutron branching ratios
for the implanted nuclei. A correlation area of 3 × 3 mm2

centered around the implantation was used. Correlation
times were of 10 times the expected half-life value for
implant-β correlations and a software time gate of 400 μs
was used between β and neutron events. An example of the
correlation diagrams and the ML analysis carried out for
214Tl are shown in Fig. 2.
The results obtained for the half-lives and neutron

branching ratios are reported in Table I and displayed in
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.
In order to have a complete picture on both sides of the

neutron shell closure in Fig. 3 we have included previously
published results from another recent work [48–50,53], as
well as half-life values reported for 208;209Hg in Ref. [51].
The new results comprise twenty half-life measurements in
the N ≳ 126 region, nine of them reported for the first time.
With the exception of 212Tl and 219Bi an excellent agree-
ment is found with the recently published work of Morales
et al. [48–50,53]. Previously published half-lives for
208;209Hg [51] are much longer than the values reported
here. A recent experiment at CERN-ISOLDE [54] also
concluded that the half-life of 208Hg is less than a few
minutes, and much shorter than the published value. Thus,
we use the recent half-life results to test the reliability of
global theoretical models on both sides of N ¼ 126. The
FRDMþ QRPA [22] model was until recently the only
theory available over the full network of nuclei involved in

r-process calculations. Presently, two additional complete
β-decay calculations are available: The KTUY model,
based on the gross theory with improved even-odd and
shell terms [52,55], and the proton-neutron relativistic
quasiparticle phase approximation based on the Hartree-
Bogoliubov model (RHBþ RQRPA) [25]. As already
pointed out in Ref. [49], in the N ≤ 126 mass region the
measured half-lives are on average a factor of 20 lower than
FRDMþ QRPApredictions. This effect has been explained
on the basis of detailed calculations [23,24,56,57], which
reveal an increasing contribution of FF transitions toward
higher Z values. This occurs because the Gamow-Teller
(GT) transitions get progressively Pauli blocked by the
filling of the h11=2 proton orbital, which reduces contribu-
tions from allowed νh9=2-πh11=2 transitions. This behavior in
the N ≤ 126 mass region seems to be properly reproduced
by the latest global calculation RHBþ RQRPA, where the
average discrepancy is only a factor of 3 with respect to the
experimental results. The performance of the highly para-
metrized KTUY scheme is worse, with half-lives which are,
on average, a factor of 6 higher.
The situation, however, is reversed beyond N ¼ 126. In

this region FRDMþ QRPA predicts half-lives which are,
on average, in good agreement with the experimental
values. This is particularly true for the chain of Tl isotopes,
where only minor discrepancies between FRDMþ QRPA
and experiment can be observed over the mass range from
211 up to 216. The decay systematics of the Tl isotopic
chain, from 211Tl up to 213Tl, have been thoroughly
investigated on the basis of half-life and spectroscopy
measurements [48,49,53]. With the results of the present
work, this can be extended three mass units further, i.e., to
214;215;216Tl. Our new results confirm the systematic behav-
ior described in Ref. [49] for the Tl isotopic chain, which is
consistent with DF3þ cQRPA calculations published

for 211–214Tl [23] (Fig. 3). This was also interpreted
[48,49,53,58] as an indication of the predominance of
allowed νi11=2 → πi13=2 GT transitions in the N > 126,
Z ≤ 82 mass region “south-east” from 208Pb. This explan-
ation also holds for the β decay of 206Au, where our result is
in agreement with the value reported recently [50]. Whether
the anomalously high occupation of the νi11=2 orbital is due
to a weakening of the spin-orbit field caused by the tensor
force [59] or to the recently proposed three-body force
mechanism [60–62], remains an open question which calls
for further specific experiments.
KTUY reproduces excellently the half-lives measured

for the lead isotopes (Fig. 3), but the remainder of the half-
lives in the N > 126 region are underestimated, on average,
by almost 1 order of magnitude.
The good performance of the RHBþ RQRPA frame-

work in the N ≤ 126 region seems to vanish beyond the
neutron shell closure for N > 126. However, this seems to
be a problem inherent in all global calculations presently
available, where a fair performance in the N < 126 region

(KTUY and RHBþ RQRPA) implies a poor behavior
beyond the shell closure (N > 126) and vice versa
(FRDMþ QRPA). In particular, the RHBþ RQRPA pre-
dicted half-lives for N > 126 nuclei are, on average, almost
a factor of 60 lower than the experimental results. This may
be ascribed to the fact that state-of-the-art, self-consistent
nuclear models are not expected to provide accurate single-
particle energies, particularly near closed-shell nuclei,
where theQβ is not large and the strengthmay be dominated
by only one or a few transitions. Such a feature makes the
predicted β-decay observables very sensitive to the share of
FF and GT transitions, which may change abruptly with N
and Z due to the details of the quasiparticle levels predicted
by eachmodel. In addition, the strength of theT ¼ 0 proton-
neutron pairing is included in Ref. [25] using a single and
rather simple parametrization [63]. In the DF3þ cQRPA
[23], the effective mass m� ¼ 1 and a moderate mass-
independent strength of the T ¼ 0 proton-neutron pairing
is used, resulting in a more satisfactory description of the Tl
to Bi isotopes. Interestingly, in the FRDMþ QRPA where
theT ¼ 0 pairing is absent, the description of the semimagic
Z ¼ 82� 1 isotopes, for which it is not that important, is
better compared to other isotopic chains.
Additional constraints when comparing microscopic

models with experiment can be found in the neutron-
branching ratios of the Tl isotopes, which are shown in
Fig. 4. The discrepancies found between the RHBþ
RQRPA predictions and the measured Tl-decay half-lives
(Fig. 3) are at variance with the quite good agreement that is
found with the measured neutron branching ratios. As the
GT and FF decays are treated in a single RQRPA
framework, this may reflect that the integral of GTþ FF
strength is overestimated both inQβn andQβ windows. The
good agreement between the experimental half-lives and
the FRDMþ QRPA predictions for the entire Tl-isotopic
chain (Fig. 3) is in contrast with the factor of 5 discrepancy
found for the FRDMþ QRPA predicted branching ratios
of 215;216Tl. Such inconsistency might be ascribed to the
QRPA description of the GT and statistical treatment
of the FF transitions. The KTUY predicted neutron
branching ratios seem reasonable, but with a clear tendency
to underestimate them.
Finally, Fig. 4 also shows a comparison between

measured neutron branching ratios and phenomenological
models [30,31]. Agreement is found only with the neutron
branching ratios measured for 210;211Hg and 211;212;215;216Tl,
which have a rather large uncertainty. This feature points to
an accidental coincidence rather than a predictive power.
Further measurements will be important in order to extend
the parametrized models to the heavy mass region.
In summary, the present work reports experimental

results for nine new β-decay half-lives and eight new
β-delayed neutron emission probabilities (or upper limits)
in the heavy mass region beyond N ¼ 126. These new data
have allowed us to get an insight into the β-decay

performance of the only three nuclear models that are
applicable over the full nuclear landscape, FRDMþ
QRPA [22], KTUY [52], and RHBþ RQRPA [25]. One
can conclude that, presently, there exists no global model
which provides satisfactory β-decay half-lives and neutron
branchings on both sides of the N ¼ 126 shell closure. The
RHBþ RQRPA framework predicts fairly well the β-decay
half-lives in the N ≤ 126 region (although not beyond the
shell closure), as well as the neutron emission probability, at
least in the region where new data are reported. It is worth
noting that in the N ≤ 126 region, where the new RHBþ
RQRPA model and the previous self-consistent study
[23,32,56,64] perform better, it is more relevant than the
nuclei beyond the neutron shell closure because it involves
all the species produced during the r-process freeze-out.
Thus, the new experimental data support the rather good
agreement predicted in Ref. [25] for the r-process abun-
dances around the third r-process peak at A ¼ 195.
The next important step toward a fully self-consistent

description of the β-decay rates including nuclear deformation
has been made within the finite amplitude method (FAM)
[65,66]. In this respect, a remaining challenge of prime
importance for the QRPA is the impact of the 2p-2h configu-
rations on the β-decay rates and Pn values [67–69]. Further
measurements of these two gross properties of β-decay and
possibly spectroscopicmeasurements in the heavymass region
aroundA ∼ 200 arehighly desirable inorder to further improve
theoretical models and r-process calculations.
