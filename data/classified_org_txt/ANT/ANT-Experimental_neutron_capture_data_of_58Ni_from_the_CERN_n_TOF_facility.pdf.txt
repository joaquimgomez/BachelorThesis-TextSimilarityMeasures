Abstract. The neutron capture cross section of 58Ni was measured at the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF
at CERN, from 27 meV to 400 keV neutron energy. Special care has been taken to identify all the possible
sources of background, with the so-called neutron background obtained for the first time using high-precision
GEANT4 simulations. The energy range up to 122 keV was treated as the resolved resonance region, where

51 resonances were identified and analyzed by a multilevel R-matrix code SAMMY. Above 122 keV the code
SESH was used in analyzing the unresolved resonance region of the capture yield. Maxwellian averaged cross
sections were calculated in the temperature range of kT = 5 – 100 keV, and their astrophysical implications
were investigated.

1 Introduction

Neutron capture on 58Ni is of importance for Nuclear As-
trophysics, since 58Ni is a participant in the slow neutron
capture process (s-process) responsible for the production
of a large portion of elements heavier than iron. It is also
important as a constituent in the structural materials used
in nuclear reactors, since the long lived 59Ni – produced
by the neutron irradiation of 58Ni – is a source of the
long-term radiation hazard. Furthermore, the subsequent
59Ni(n, α)56Fe reaction contributes to the helium produc-
tion within the stainless steel alloys, damaging them in the
process [1].

2 n_TOF facility and experimental setup

At the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN the
highly intense neutron beam is produced through irradia-
tion of the massive Pb spallation target by 20 GeV pulsed
proton beam from CERN Proton Synchrotron. The 7 ns
wide proton pulses are delivered with a repetition rate in
multiples of 1.2 s, with an average frequency of 0.4 Hz.
Around 300 neutrons are produced per incident proton,
with an average value of 7 × 1012 protons per pulse. Ini-
tially fast neutrons are moderated by the Pb block itself,
1 cm layer of water from the target cooling system and
an additional 4 cm layer of borated water. After mod-
eration the neutron beam covers 12 orders of magnitude
in energy – from ∼10 meV to ∼10 GeV. An evacuated
beamline leads to the experimental area located at approxi-
mately 185 m from the spallation target. Charged particles
are deflected outside the neutron beam by a 1.5 T sweep-
ing magnet. Further details on the n_TOF facility may be
found in Ref. [2].

For the measurement of the 58Ni(n, γ) reaction two
C6D6 (deuterated benzene) liquid scintillation detectors
were used, specifically optimized to exhibit a very low
neutron sensitivity [3]. The measurement was performed
by detecting the prompt γ-rays from the deexcitation cas-
cades following the neutron captures. Based on the time-
stamp of a detected γ-ray – relative to the initial γ-flash
preceding every neutron bunch – a kinetic energy is as-
signed to the captured neutron via the time of flight tech-
nique.

Themass of 58Ni sample – 0.72 mm thick and 19.9mm
in diameter – was 2.069 g. The isotopic enrichment was
99.5%, with only trace contamination of 60,61,62,64Ni.

3 58Ni neutron capture cross section

Neutron capture data were analyzed between 27 meV and
400 keV [4]. From the measured counts the capture yield

was reconstructed applying the Pulse Height Weighting
Technique [5], which consists in the off-line software mod-
ification of the detection efficiency so as to make it propor-
tional to the total energy released in the cascade. Special
care was taken to account for all possible sources of back-
ground. The background of scattered in-beam γ-rays was
measured with the Pb sample and was found to be com-
pletely negligible. The background related to the neutron
beam alone was measured without the sample in place.
The environmental background – caused by the natural
and induced radioactivity – was measured by turning off
the neutron beam. Finally, the background caused by the
neutrons scattered off the sample itself – referred to as the
neutron background – was determined for the first time
at n_TOF by dedicated GEANT4 [6] simulations. In the
simulations a realistic description of the experimental hall
and setup was implemented, and the details of the neutron
interactions were recorded. Special care was taken in se-
lecting the optimal set of models for the neutron transport
and in investigating the reliability of simulated results. By
comparing the simulated and experimental results for natC
sample – serving as an excellent neutron scatterer – the re-
liability of simulations was established [7]. The simulated
neutron background for 58Ni was subtracted from the ex-
perimental data in order to obtain the final capture yield,
shown in Fig. 1.

The energy region up to 122 keV was analyzed as a
resolved resonance region, where 51 resolved resonances
were identified and analyzed by a multilevelR-matrix code
SAMMY [8]. In fitting the resonances in the capture
yield, SAMMY is able to account for the experimental ef-
fects such as the resolution function of the neutron beam,
Doppler broadening, multiple scattering and self shielding
effects, reconstructing the underlying capture cross sec-
tion parameters in the process. Two resonances at nega-

tive energies (below the neutron separation energy) were
also adopted in order to parameterize the smooth capture
yield extending from thermal energies up to the first cap-
ture resonance at 6.9 keV. The energy region from 122 keV
to 400 keVwas treated as the unresolved resonance region.
In this region the specialized code SESH [9] was used to
simulate the smoothed capture yield and thus reconstruct
the smooth capture cross section. The parameterization
from SESH was used to estimate the cross section all the
way up to 1 MeV.

From the set of parameters obtained by SAMMY and
SESH the Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS):

were calculated for the astrophysically relevant thermal
values of kT = 5 – 100 keV, characteristic of the stellar
environments where the s-process takes place. The lat-
est n_TOF results are shown in Fig. 2, together with the
past experimental results from Refs. [10–13] and the val-
ues adopted in the KADoNIS v0.3 database [14]. The re-
cent findings by Guber et al. [13] – consisting in globally
lower capture cross section than previously reported – are
strongly supported by the latest n_TOF results. This may
very well be due to the inadequately suppressed or sub-
tracted neutron background in earlier experiments. In fact,
a clear historical trend of lowering the reported MACS for
58Ni may be observed. The MACS from n_TOF were
also compared with the values calculated using the eval-
uated capture cross sections from ENDF/B-VII.0 [15] and
ENDF/B-VII.1 [16] libraries, with ENDF/B-VII.0 cap-
ture data for 58Ni as the representative of other major li-
braries such as JENDL-4.0, JEFF-3.1.2, CENDL-3.1 and
ROSFOND-2010. Since the latest ENDF/B-VII.1 evalua-
tion takes into account the results from Guber et al., above
kT = 10 keV the n_TOF MACS were found to be in a bet-
ter agreement with the MACS from ENDF/B-VII.1 than
with those from ENDF/B-VII.0. Therefore, the revision of
the evaluated capture data for 58Ni is strongly encouraged
for the other evaluated cross section libraries.

Figure 2. MACS from n_TOF – with an associated uncertainty
range – compared to the past experimental results from Refs.
[10–13] and values from KADoNIS v0.3 database [14].

The astrophysical implications of the n_TOF MACS
were investigated by means of the post-processing NuGrid
code MPPNP [17]. The new MACS value of 34.2 mb
at kT = 30 keV – as opposed to 38.7 mb from the latest
KADoNIS v0.3 database [14] – was used in the full 25M�
stellar model with initial metal content of Z = 0.02. It
was found that 58Ni is efficiently depleted by the s-process
in both cases, regardless of the MACS value used. For
this reason the abundances of heavier isotopes along the
s-process path leading from 58Ni are not affected. How-
ever, due to 12% decrease in the average capture cross sec-
tion – relative to KADoNIS v0.3 value – the small residual
final 58Ni content at the end of s-process is increased by
60% [4].
