Abstract—This paper describes an equipment for continu-
ous measurement and identification of gamma radioactivity
in aerosols developed by the Nuclear Engineering Research
Group (NERG) at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC)
and Raditel Serveis i Subministraments Tecnològics, Ltd. A
spectrometric analysis code has been specially designed for it.
Spectrum analysis identifies and determines activity concentra-
tion of aerosol emitters captured by a fiberglass paper filter.
This new equipment is currently operating in three radioactivity
monitoring stations of the Environmental Radiological Surveil-
lance Network of the Generalitat of Catalunya (local Catalan
government): two near Ascó and Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plants
in the province of Tarragona and one in the city of Barcelona.
Two more monitors are expected to be deployed at Roses
(province of Girona) and Puigcerdà (province of Barcelona).
Measurements and evolution analysis results of emitters identified
at these stations were also provided.

I. INTRODUCTION

P rotection against environmental ionizing (mainly gamma)radiation requires the determination of the ambient dose
equivalent H*(10) [1]. Nevertheless, this magnitude does not
give information about the nature of radiation, i.e., the isotope
emitting gamma radiation. To complement H*(10), an equip-
ment for continuous measurement of gamma radioactivity in
aerosols with paper filter has been designed. An option to com-
plement the H*(10) measurement is the Berthold BAI9850-
61, which measures beta particulates , radon and 131I activity.
The BAI9850-61 uses a Single-Channel Analyzer and only
detects 131I. Furthermore, to retain iodine, the BAI9850-61
employs a TEDA Impregnated Carbon Filter. This kind of
filter difficult the continuous measurement. Another option
are direct monitors of gamma radiation with spectrometric
analysis, e.g. SARA monitor form TechniData among others.
This kind of monitors are able to determine the gamma activity
from aerosols. The equipment presented in this paper identifies
continuously gamma emitting aerosols (natural and artificial
emitters from nuclear power plant discharges or industrial ap-
plications, e.g. radio-iodines, 137Cs, 60Co or 192Ir among others

) and determines their activity concentration. Our equipment
has been used by the Environmental Radiological Surveillance
Network of the Generalitat de Catalunya since 2010. 1 Three
monitors are currently fully operative: two in the surveillance
station of the Ascó and Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plants (both
in the province of Tarragona, Spain), and one in the Engineer-
ing School of Barcelona, Spain. Two new monitors will shortly
be deployed in Roses (province of Girona) and in Puigcerdà
(province of Barcelona). These monitors have been designed
and developed by the NERG (Nuclear Engineering Research
Group) at the Technical University of Catalonia-Barcelona

II. DESCRIPTION

The equipment measures activity concentration in air of
natural and artificial gamma emitters in aerosols captured by
a fixed paper filter, and generates alarms depending on the
measurements and emitters identified. Figure 1 is a photograph
of the equipment and figure 2 is a block diagram. It is mainly
made up of an air suction module, a filter, an air duct to the
filter, a detection module and a control module. The suction
module draws air from the outside and introduces it into
the detection zone. Previously, the air passes through an air
injection head and onto the filter, where a fraction of the
heavier particles and aerosols is adhered. The efficiency of the
filter is near 99% for all the particles. A special case is 131I
where only a fraction are particles the rest are gaseous species.
The fraction particles on iodine depends on the atmospheric
conditions during the transport of iodine. After a study of
several researchers estimations from information collected
during the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents [2] and other
measurements [3] we had adopted the Rascal criterion of
33% [4] for the fraction of particles in radio-iodine. The
gamma radiations emitted by radionuclides that adhere to the
filter are detected by the detection module, and the electric
signal is processed to generate an energy spectrum. This
spectrum is analyzed by a spectrometric analysis code, called
pGamma, and a report of the activity concentration in air of
each identified radionuclide is created. The detection time can
be divided into partial periods where a partial spectrum is
generated and analyzed, and a partial report is obtained.

Once the detection time ends, an electric positioning actu-
ator lifts the air injection head to allow the paper filter roll
to rotate such that a clean filter is ready for use for the next

network.



measurements. Then, the positioning actuator returns the air
injection head to its initial position.

The control module is composed of a network of sensors
which monitor the status of the equipment. Their output
signal is sampled by a data acquisition card and analyzed
by control software. This software creates a report about the
status of the equipment, allowing the user to perform control
operations. All remote computer communications are made by
the teleprocessing module and software.

A data acquisition card is connected in an expansion slot
of an industrial computer. All the software is installed on this
computer. For ease of maintenance and tuning operations the
equipment is provided of a screen showing the spectrum and
the main operation parameters.

The detection zone is a cavity (figure 3) comprising a
shielding, the air injection head, the paper filter, the detector
casing with the Sn and Cu filters, the instrumentation and the
detector. The shielding is a 5 cm thick lead cylinder with a top
head and a bottom slab to absorb cosmic radiation and NORM
radiation from soil. It has four ports: the air injection head,
the air outlet and two windows for the paper filter roll. They
were designed to minimize the solid angle between them and
the window of the detector. The detector is lined with a PVC
casing and Sn and Cu filters. This casing directs the air once
it has passed through the filter and facilitates the removal of
the detector, and the Sn and Cu filters absorb X-rays.

Since this equipment is intended for environmental surveil-
lance, the air flow is in the order of 10 m3/s. That is why the
filter is unlikely to break or become saturated. This allows
the use of a fixed paper filter, with which activity concen-
tration can be directly determined. This is not possible with
moving filters [5]. Moreover, a paper filter allows continuous
measurement with automatic movement of the filter when a
new counting starts. The filter is a glassfiber GF 10 from

Hahnemühle (100% borosilicate) with organic links used in
roll form. This kind of filters has an efficiency of ∼99% for
the particles of interest - taking as a reference Whatman-41
filter (ours has better performance) - [6], [7].

A 2” x 2” LaBr3(Ce) scintillator detector is used to detect
gamma radiation retained on the filter. LaBr3(Ce) scintillators
have a better resolution, are less sensitive to temperature but
their intrinsic spectrum is more intense than the classic NaI(Tl)
spectrum. This is a drawback, but it can be useful. The intrinsic
peak due to 1436 keV gammas of 138La (which, together with
the sum peak of 32 keV X-rays and 1436 keV gammas, forms
a multiple peak or multiplet) is used as a reference peak for
spectrum stabilisation. To test stabilisation, the equipment was
subject to a temperature test consisting in sudden variations in
intake air temperature, combined with suction phases of cold
outside air and of previously heated air. Figure 4 shows one



of these tests. After the variations of 18 ºC, the centroid of
peaks remains in the same channel. Under normal operating
conditions, no abrupt changes in temperature, such as those
in the tests, ever occur. The drawback of using the intrinsic
138La full energy peak as a reference is the influence of another
gamma emitter with an energy greater than 1436 keV. To
demonstrate this, two scenarios were analyzed: the effect of
the sum peak of 60Co (an artificial gamma emitter) and the
effect of the full energy peaks of the 238U-222Rn series with
an energy greater than 1450 keV, mainly 214Bi. Under normal
operating conditions, 214Bi photons with energies greater than
1450 keV do not generate a Compton continuum intense
enough to overlap the full energy peak of 138La. The sum
peak of 60Co (1137 keV + 1332 keV = 2496 keV) generates
a Compton continuum capable of overlapping the reference
peak. In this case, before reaching the activity level of 60Co
required to overlap the 138La peak, the system will switch to
investigation mode and alarm mode.

A spectrometric analysis code, called pGamma, specially
designed by the NERG research team for the equipment
described here analyzes spectra to identify emitters associated
with existing peaks and determine their activity concentration.
This code, includes a library with NORM and artificial gamma
emitters of interest. In addition, it is more suitable than other
commercial codes because it allows automatic operation of
the equipment. pGamma has two operation modes, i.e. normal
operation mode and investigation mode. In normal operation,
pGamma only searches for NORM peaks, but when one of
the following conditions is fulfilled it switches to investigation
mode: 1) an identified emitter has an activity greater than an
empirical threshold; 2) a significant peak has not been identi-
fied; and 3) the derivative of whole spectrum counts (without
the lower channels) is greater than an empirical threshold. In
investigation mode, pGamma searches for artificial emitters.
Two levels of alarm are generated depending on the activity
concentration of at least one of the identified emitters.

The identification of 131I in nuclear fallout is worth mention-
ing. This emitter can be detected with the equipment, but its
minimum detectable activity is higher than for other emitters
and activity concentration can be estimated only because of
the filter used, which only retains iodine particles while letting
other iodine species pass. The iodine species on a specific
location depends on the atmospheric conditions during iodine
transport. Thus, it is impossible to accurately determine the
activity of 131I. However, this is not a problem because the
equipment is intended for surveillance and its final purpose is
to generate alarms

The purpose of the equipment is not to identify all peaks
in the energy spectrum, but only those whose peak net area
is greater than a significance threshold. When this condition
is met, the code tries to identify them. This increases the
minimum detectable activity, but avoids excessive meaning-
less information. The minimum detectable activity in normal
operating conditions, for 24 h spectra, is 0.02402 Bq/m3 for
60Co, 0.01662 Bq/m3 for 137Cs and 0.4 Bq/m3 for 131I, with
the last one being a special case due the above reasons.

III. RESULTS

The following experimental results were obtained by the
equipment in the three stations of the Environmental Radio-
logical Surveillance Network of the Generalitat de Catalunya.
The Ascó station and two monitors (of an older version than
the one presented here) are shown in figure 5. In normal
operating conditions, only the contribution of natural emitters
212Pb, 214Pb and 214Bi appears in the report. Figure 6 shows
the evolution of their activity concentration at the Ascó and
Vandellòs stations during January 2015, also the corresponding
Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) is shown in Figure 7.
The concentration of natural emitters is greater in Ascó than in
Vandellòs due the geographical situation of both nuclear power
plants. Since Ascó is close to the Ebro river and Vandellòs is
near the sea, the source term of naturals in Ascó is greater.
Figure 8 shows the 214Bi /214Pb ratio, which is within the
typical range of values, as can be seen in [3]. Figure 9 shows
the activity concentration of 214Pb on the monitors of the
Ascó and Barcelona stations on 1-2 January 2015. The relation
between temperature and activity in air is exactly as expected
[3].

Figure 11 shows the report generated by the spectrometric
analysis code pGamma (installed on the monitor) of a typical
of a typical 24 h spectrum obtained at Ascó station on
10 January 2015 (figure 10). This report is employed by
the manager of the network to generate the official report
given to the Spanish Nuclear Security council. The report
has four blocks: 1) overall parameters of the spectrum; 2)
specific activity of identified isotopes (first column for activity,
second for error, third for detectable activity and fourth the
peaks associated with the isotope); 3) identified peaks on the

spectrum with the information of each peak (centroid channel,
energy, channels of the limits of the peak , FWHM, net area)
; and 4) unidentified peaks.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The Equipment for Continuous Measurement of Gamma
Radioactivity in Aerosols with Paper Filter presented here
determines the activity concentration of gamma emitters in

aerosols and detects the presence of 131I. It complements
the information given by H∗(10) monitors, allowing the
investigation of the radiation source. The equipment operates
remotely on networks in combination with other monitors.
It generates partial and global spectra, monitors variations in
the counts in partial spectra, and finally generates a report of
each counting period. Alarms are generated when an emitter’s
activity concentration exceeds a set limit or an artificial emitter
is identified.
