The neutron capture cross section of 209Bi has been measured at the CERN n TOF facility by employing
the pulse-height-weighting technique. Improvements over previous measurements are mainly because of an
optimized detection system, which led to a practically negligible neutron sensitivity. Additional experimental
sources of systematic error, such as the electronic threshold in the detectors, summing of γ -rays, internal electron
conversion, and the isomeric state in bismuth, have been taken into account. γ -Ray absorption effects inside the
sample have been corrected by employing a nonpolynomial weighting function. Because 209Bi is the last stable
isotope in the reaction path of the stellar s-process, the Maxwellian averaged capture cross section is important for
the recycling of the reaction flow by α decays. In the relevant stellar range of thermal energies between kT = 5
and 8 keV our new capture rate is about 16% higher than the presently accepted value used for nucleosynthesis
calculations. At this low temperature an important part of the heavy Pb-Bi isotopes are supposed to be synthesized
by the s-process in the He shells of low mass, thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars. With the improved
set of cross sections we obtain an s-process fraction of 19±3% of the solar bismuth abundance, resulting in an
r-process residual of 81±3%. The present (n, γ ) cross-section measurement is also of relevance for the design
of accelerator driven systems based on a liquid metal Pb/Bi spallation target.

I. INTRODUCTION

209Bi is the end-point isotope of the s-process path. Its
observed abundance has been finally understood in terms of
the main s-process component, operating in the He-shell of
low mass, low metallicity, thermally pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars [1,2].

However, the complex production pattern at the end of
the s-process path still hides important information, that
can be unraveled by means of accurate neutron capture
measurements. Capture on bismuth leads to the ground state
of 210Bi, which β decays to 210Po that is α-unstable, producing
206Pb (see Fig. 1).

However, given the 210Po half-life of 138 days it can also
act as a branching point by capturing another neutron and en-
hancing the abundance of 207Pb instead. Another contribution
to 207Pb may be because of a long-lived isomer in 210Bi at
271 keV. Neutron capture on this isomer leads to 211Bi with
an α-decay half-life of 2.17 min. The two branchings, at 210Po
and 210Bi, depend strongly on the stellar conditions of neutron
density and temperature. Given an appropriate stellar model
and accurate neutron capture cross sections, the s abundances
of the Pb/Bi isotopes can be more reliably determined, thus
providing a better decomposition of the respective r-process
abundances and of the radiogenic contributions because of
the Th/U α decays. The latter information represents a viable
constraint on the Th/U abundances calculation and its use as
cosmochronometers [3,4].

For the discussion of these astrophysical aspects, the
present status of the 209Bi capture data is rather unsatisfactory
[5]. Previous experiments exhibit significant discrepancies
suggesting the existence of systematic uncertainties, which
must be clearly reduced for a more quantitative assessment
of the Pb/Bi abundances. Two capture resonance studies on

209Bi have been reported so far, one at ORNL [6] and the
other at GELINA [7,8]. In the former measurement, two
strong s-wave resonances at low neutron energy could not be
measured because of a low-neutron-energy cutoff at 2.6 keV.
In addition, substantial corrections were needed for some of
the resonances in order to account for the neutron sensitivity of
the experimental setup employed. The GELINA measurement
was also affected by significant corrections for neutron
sensitivity.

The 209Bi (n, γ ) cross section has also a very practical
application. Thanks to its properties of chemical inertness, high
boiling point, low neutron moderation, and large scattering
cross section, an eutectic mixture of lead and bismuth is
presently considered as a very appropriate material for the
spallation target and as the coolant for accelerator driven
systems (ADS).

In a first sensitivity study of the neutron cross sections of
the main materials used in this type of hybrid reactor [9],
severe discrepancies were found between different evaluated
nuclear data files. As a consequence, a list of isotopes was
tagged for high priority measurements. Initially, most of the
requested cross sections corresponded to the fuel and cladding
materials and were focused on the elastic, inelastic, and (n, xn)
channels. However, a recent extension of the same study [10]
includes additional requests for the capture reactions in the
spallation/coolant materials lead and bismuth. Comparing
two evaluated data files, ENDF/B-VI.8 and JENDL 3.3,
discrepancies in the neutron balance of 12.5% were identified
to result from the uncertainties of the (n, γ ) cross section
of 209Bi alone. Hence, the precise knowledge of the neutron
capture cross sections of the lead and bismuth isotopes turned
out to be of key relevance for the design of an ADS suited
for the transmutation of radioactive residues and for energy
production.

Apart from its contribution to the neutron balance, neutron
capture on 209Bi affects the radiotoxicity as well. Buildup of

138 d) contributes to the long- and short-term radiotoxicity
of the spallation target and of the coolant. These hazards can
only be evaluated on the basis of a precise (n, γ ) cross section
of bismuth and with accurate data concerning the partial cross
sections leading to 210Bim and 210Po.

II. CROSS-SECTION MEASUREMENT

The neutron energy differential capture cross section of
209Bi has been measured at the n TOF installation of CERN
using the time-of-flight (TOF) technique. Because this facility
has been described in detail elsewhere [11], only the main
features are summarized in Sec. II A. The major motivation for
this measurement was to overcome the systematic uncertainty
related to the neutron-scattering background, which arises
in measurements on isotopes with a dominant scattering
channel. Sample scattered neutrons are easily captured in
the materials surrounding the detector or in the sensitive
detector volume itself, producing γ -rays, which appear as
a prompt, TOF-dependent background. This effect becomes
particularly crucial for the broad s-wave resonances in bismuth
at low-neutron energies between 0.8 and 12 keV, resulting in
corrections as large as 50% in previous measurements [6].

For this reason the reaction yield of this isotope has
been measured with a set of total energy detectors con-
sisting of optimized C6D6 liquid scintillation detectors
(Sec. II B). This setup turned out to be of pivotal importance
for the efficient suppression of the background from scattered
neutrons. Other sample-related corrections were significantly
reduced by choosing a comparably small bismuth sample
20 mm in diameter and 6.1 mm in thickness. The cross
section is determined relative to the 4.9 eV 198Au resonance
by employing the saturated resonance technique [12]. For
this purpose a gold sample 1 mm in thickness and 20 mm
in diameter was measured in regular intervals. A thorough
analysis of the capture data, including extensive Monte Carlo
simulations of the necessary corrections to the experimental
data, allowed us to determine the final cross section with a
systematic uncertainty of better than 3%.

A. The n TOF installation

At n TOF, neutrons are produced via spallation reactions
induced by 20 GeV protons in a lead target. Pulses of
(3–7)×1012 protons with a duration of 6 ns (rms) hit the
Pb-block with a typical repetition rate of 0.4 Hz. This very low
duty cycle combined with the very high intensity in the beam
pulses makes n TOF an ideal facility for TOF measurements
on radioactive samples. The low repetition rate has allowed
to implement an advanced data acquisition system with zero
dead time based on Flash-amplitude-to-digital converters [13].

The number of neutrons arriving at the sample are moni-
tored by means of a 200-µg/cm2-thick 6Li foil centered in the
beam. The particles emitted in the 6Li(n, α)3H reaction are
registered with four silicon detectors surrounding the 6Li foil
outside of the beam. The neutron monitor [14] is mounted in an
evacuated carbon fiber chamber 3 m upstream of the samples.
The samples, which are positioned at a flight path of 185 m,
are fixed on a sample changer, which is also made of carbon
fiber.

The neutron intensity has been determined by means of two
independent measurements, performed with the Si-monitor
described above and with a calibrated fission chamber [15].
Two measurements were carried out with the latter detector,
employing foils of 235U and 238U. Calibration of the absolute
yield in (n, γ ) measurements via the saturated resonance
method requires actually only the shape of the neutron flux,
which can be directly determined from the Si-monitor and
fission chamber measurements with an uncertainty below
±2% [16].

The beam profile at the sample position has been deter-
mined to exhibit an approximate Gaussian shape with σ =
7 mm, slightly off centered (�x = 1.5 mm) [17]. The samples
used in this measurement cover about 60% of the neutron
beam.

The excellent neutron energy resolution of the n TOF
facility is because of the long flight path of 185 m and the short
proton pulse width. The resolution function was determined by
means of Monte Carlo simulations [18] and has been validated
experimentally by measuring narrow p- and d-wave capture
resonances on a sample of natFe.

B. Experimental setup

A general view of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2.
The detection system used with the pulse-height-weighting
technique (PHWT) [19] had been optimized with respect to the
sensitivity for scattered neutrons, the most crucial source of
background in (n, γ ) studies on neutron magic nuclei, which
are characterized by particularly large scattering-to-capture
ratios. Scattered neutrons may be subsequently captured in the
detectors or in nearby materials, where they produce γ -rays,
which are likely to be registered with high probability, thus
mimicking true capture events in the sample.

In an effort to reduce the neutron sensitivity as much
as possible, special C6D6 liquid scintillation detectors [20]
have been developed consisting of materials with low-neutron-
capture cross sections. The main features of these detectors are
thin-walled scintillator cells made of carbon fiber, which are

directly glued onto the photomultiplier tubes, thus eliminating
dead materials, e.g., the common quartz window of the
scintillator cells. To avoid the additional material of a support,
the detectors were hanging on thin cords fixed at the ceiling.
Similarly, the sample changer was made of carbon fiber as was
the frame of the sample-holder. The samples were mounted on
thin Kapton foils, which were glued on the frame that was
much larger than the diameter of the neutron beam. In this
way, the neutron sensitivity in the critical energy range from 1
to 100 keV could be reduced by factors of 3–10 [20].

The two detectors were placed at an angle of ∼125◦ with
respect to the sample to minimize the angular distribution
effects of the primary capture γ rays. Also the background
resulting from in-beam γ -rays scattered in the sample was
considerably reduced in this configuration [21].

III. DATA ANALYSIS

In this section, the PHWT principle is reviewed together
with the related systematic uncertainties of relevance for this
type of capture measurements, followed by the determination
of the weighting factors. We describe the calculation of
accurate yield corrections and the analysis procedure to
determine resonance parameters.

A. Pulse-height-weighting technique and systematic
uncertainties

The PHWT is based on two conditions: (i) that the detector
efficiency εγ � 1 so that at most only one γ ray per capture
cascade is registered and (ii) that εγ is proportional to the
energy of the registered γ -ray, εγ ≈ αEγ . Under these two
conditions, the efficiency εc for detecting a capture event, i.e.,
a cascade composed of m γ rays, becomes proportional to the
sum energy Ec of that cascade. In this case one obtains

εc = 1 −
m∏

j=1
(1 − εγj ) ≈

m∑
j=1

εγj ≈ αEc, (1)

which is a constant independent of the actual deexcitation
pattern of the nucleus produced in the capture reaction. It is
worth noting that the approximations in Eq. (1) are the better
justified the better conditions (i) and (ii) are fulfilled.

The validity of Eq. (1) can be challenged by several
experimental problems. In particular, condition (i) is violated
if more than one γ ray of the cascade is registered in the same
detector. Moreover, the product as well as the sum over the
m γ rays of the cascade is always incomplete because of the
unavoidable loss of γ rays because of electronic threshold
applied to the detector signals, converted transitions, and
partial population of the isomeric state in 210Bi at 271 keV.

For all these effects, which may influence the validity of
Eq. (1), appropriate corrections have to be determined as is
shown in the following subsections.

As far as condition (ii) is concerned, the proportional
increase of the efficiency with γ -ray energy is enforced by
an appropriate modification of the detector energy response
distribution R(E). This is achieved by application of a pulse-

height-dependent weighting factor Wi , such that the weighted
sum of the response for a γ -ray j, Rij , becomes proportional
to its energy Eγj , ∑

i

WiRij = αEγj . (2)

The second approximation in Eq. (1) depends directly on the
accuracy of the calculated weights Wi , which can be tested as
discussed below.

B. Weighting factors

It has been shown [22,23] that realistic response functions
Rij for mono-energetic γ rays with energies Eγj can be
determined by means of Monte Carlo simulations for any
particular setup for (n, γ ) measurements. A set of expressions
of the form of Eq. (2) can then be used to derive the weighting
factors Wi .

The detailed geometry and chemical composition of the
experimental setup has been implemented in the Monte Carlo
simulation using GEANT4 [24] (see Fig. 2). The composition
of the carbon fiber, which is by far the dominant structural
material, was determined by an RBS analysis [25], yielding
C/O/N/Ca/Br = 2.0/0.2/0.16/0.012/0.016. Also, the capture
γ rays were carefully traced, assuming a radial distribu-
tion for the emission probability inside the sample accord-
ing to the neutron beam profile described in Sec. II A.
The depth distribution was included as well because it
changed significantly from a practically uniform to a sur-
face peaked shape between weak and strong resonances,
respectively.

The weighting function (WF) of the gold calibration sample
was obtained using the conventional approximation by a
polynomial function of order k = 4,Wi =

not be satisfied with the polynomial WF approach. In this
case an accurate, pointwise WF was obtained by means of a
linear regularization method for solving the inverse problem
of Eq. (2) [16]. In this way the uncertainty connected with the
polynomial WF has been reduced to 0.3%, an improvement by
an order of magnitude.

The systematic uncertainty introduced by the WF was
determined as described in Ref. [23], basically by performing
Monte Carlo simulations of the capture cascades at a certain
resonance. The deexcitation pattern is modeled by combining
the experimentally known levels at low excitation energy with
a statistical model of the nucleus to complete the cascade up
to the capture energy. These simulated capture events can be
used to estimate the uncertainty of the calculated WF.

To illustrate the performance of the cascade event generator
for the samples measured in this experiment, the simulated
pulse-height spectra RC

i
for the 802 eV resonance in 210Bi and

for the 4.9 eV resonance in 198Au are compared in Fig. 3 with
the corresponding experimental spectra measured at n TOF.

The spectra based on the simulated cascades show in gen-
eral a good agreement with the experimental spectra. The small
differences at higher energy can be ascribed to the employed
statistical model and to a lesser extent to the uncertainties
in the calibration of the C6D6 detectors. In principle, these
differences could be minimized by modifying the relative
strength of M1 and E1 transitions in the statistical part of
the cascades and/or the instrumental resolution. However, the
effect on the weighted sum

∑
i

i

and, therefore, on the
estimated uncertainty becomes absolutely negligible in both
cases.

In summary, it was found that the simulated pulse height
spectra can be employed for the determination of the uncer-
tainty of the WF. By computing the weighted sum of each
capture cascade with the calculated weighting functions, we
obtain values, which deviate by less than 0.3% from the
corresponding capture energies. This means that condition (ii)
is fulfilled within 99.7%, leading to a practically negligible
uncertainty because of the calculated WF.

C. Yield correction factors

The corrections for the electronic threshold, γ -summing,
internal conversion, and the effect of the isomeric state (see
Sec. III A) have been estimated by detailed Monte Carlo
simulations of the capture events in a similar manner as
in Ref. [23]. Although internal conversion and summing of
cascade γ rays were found to have a minor effect of less than
2% on the capture yield of the bismuth sample, more significant

corrections are required for the electronic threshold and for the
isomeric state in 210Bi. The isomeric state is included in the
simulation by assigning a null branching ratio to the level of
271 keV, so that the deexcitation cascade ends at that level
whenever it is reached.

The yield correction factor including all these effects can
be calculated as

f
t,s,ce,m = nEc∑

i=t WiR

, (4)

where RC
i

is the total response of the detection system for n
simulated capture events. For a threshold t of 200 keV, the
yield correction factors calculated with this procedure for the
bismuth sample are listed in the third column of Table I.

Because the simulated spectra for resonances with same
spin and parity are very similar, i.e., almost independent of
the resonance energy, the correction factors could be classified
according to spin and parity of the resonance (first column in
Table I).

The population of the isomeric state calculated with our
statistical model of the nucleus is shown in the second column
of Table I. For comparison, and to illustrate the possible
uncertainty of the calculation, the correction factor of the
hypothetic case, where the isomer is populated with 100%
probability is shown in the last column. The differences were
found to range between 1% and 2.5%.

As mentioned before, the cross section is determined rela-
tive to the 4.9-eV resonance in 197Au. Therefore, the capture
yield measured with the gold sample had to be corrected
for experimental effects of threshold, γ -ray summing, and
internal conversion. The corresponding correction factor for a
threshold of 200 keV is f t,s,ceAu = 1.046(2).

Hence, the final correction for each resonance is the
ratio between the corresponding factor f t,s,ce,m from Table I
and f t,s,ceAu . This ratio oscillates between 5% and 7%. It can
be concluded, that the threshold, γ -summing, and internal

conversion effects do not cancel out by measuring with respect
to a reference sample. Neglecting these corrections could lead
to systematic deviations in the yield determination of >∼5%.

D. Neutron sensitivity

For a certain resonance at energy E◦ with capture and
neutron widths, �γ and �n, the probability that a signal in
the C6D6 scintillator is caused by a neutron scattered in the
sample and eventually captured in the detector is given by

where εγ is the detection probability for a γ -ray of a given en-
ergy. For an energy Eγ = 600 keV, εn/εγ has been calculated
by means of Monte Carlo simulations for comparison with
the experimentally determined value reported in Ref. [20].
The second factor, εγ /εc, has been determined by a detailed
Monte Carlo simulation of the present experimental setup. The
efficiency εγ was obtained for γ rays of 600 keV, whereas
εc was determined using simulated capture cascades (see
Secs. III B and III C). Finally, �n/�γ is to be determined
by an iterative procedure of correcting and fitting the value of
�γ of the corresponding resonance.

In case of the s-wave resonance at 12.1 keV, which has
the largest �n/�γ of all analyzed bismuth resonances, the
corresponding ratios were found to be εγ /εc = 0.446 (this
work) and (εn/εγ )12.1 keV = 1.5841 × 10−5 [20]. Because of
the very low neutron sensitivity the required correction for
the 12.1-keV resonance of 3.6±0.7% is relatively small and
practically negligible for the rest of the s-wave resonances in
bismuth.

The 20% uncertainty of this correction results from neu-
tron captures in the quartz window of the photomultiplier
tube because of the uncertain silicon cross sections, which
contribute a 10% uncertainty to εn/εγ , and from the resonance

parameters �n and �γ , which exhibit uncertainties of 8% and
10%, respectively.

E. R-matrix analysis

The experimental yield

Y
exp = f t,s,ce,mf nsf sat N

w

NnEc
(8)

was determined by the weighted net count rate (Nw), the
effective binding energy Ec, the integrated neutron flux Nn
(obtained from the Si-monitor and from the shape of the
neutron flux, Sec. II A), and the corrections discussed before.
The factor f sat corresponds to the absolute normalization via
the analysis of the saturated resonance at 4.9 eV in 198Au.

The yield has been analyzed with the multilevel R-matrix
code SAMMY [26]. Using an iterative procedure based on
Bayes’s theorem, Y exp is fitted with a function of the type,

Y
exp = Y f (E◦, �n, �γ ) + B, (9)

where Y f corresponds to a parametrization as a function of
the resonance parameters E◦, �n, and �γ according to the
Reich-Moore formalism. For all partial waves a channel radius
of 9.6792 fm was used. Whereas the well-known �n values
from transmission measurements were adopted, the resonance
energies E◦ and capture widths �γ have been fitted to the
experimental data. The background below the resonance is
described by the constant term B. In the fits with SAMMY,
sample effects (single and double neutron scattering inside the
sample) as well as thermal broadening are taken into account.
The resolution function of the facility (Sec. II A) has been
considered in the fits using the RPI parametrization.

The present results are illustrated in Fig. 4 at the example of
the first two s-wave resonances in 210Bi. The comparison with
the capture yields calculated with the corresponding resonance
parameters quoted in the ENDF/B-VI.8 evaluation demon-
strates the improvement because of the reduced systematic
uncertainties of the n TOF data.

IV. RESULTS

In total, 21 resonances were identified in the 209Bi(n, γ )
data in the energy range from 800 to 23150 eV. The respective
capture widths and areas are listed in Table II.

Beyond 23 keV further resonances could not be observed
because of the in-beam γ -ray background [21], which was the
major limitation in this experiment. However, this background

For most of the resonances shown in Fig. 5, there is a

higher values are reported in the latter measurement for the
two resonances at 3.3 and 5.1 keV and a lower cross section for
the resonance at 9.77 keV. The GELINA data show agreement

FIG. 5. (Color online) Comparison of the radiative capture

with n TOF in several cases, but there is an average trend of
lower cross sections. The largest differences in absolute values
are for the resonances at 5.1 and 9.77 keV and the group at
12.1 keV. For these three resonances, the ORNL data show the
opposite trend for the 5.1-keV resonance, agree with GELINA
for the 9.77 keV resonance, and agree with the n TOF data for
the 12.1 keV group.

The general systematics of better average agreement with
the ORNL data and lower average values of the GELINA
data, might be related to the weighting functions used in the
respective experiments, although threshold correction effects
(see Sec. III C) could play a role as well. Moreover, systematic
deviations because of the neutron sensitivity corrections
applied to some particular resonances cannot be excluded.

A. Discussion of uncertainties

The measuring technique employed in this work and the
data-analysis procedures described in Secs. III and III C have
been validated experimentally at n TOF [23]. According to this
study, the various contributions to the systematic uncertainty
of the present data are about 2%. In addition, the energy
dependence of the neutron flux has been found to exhibit
an uncertainty of 2% as well, resulting in a total systematic
uncertainty of better than 3%.

In this discussion, the neutron sensitivity correction has
to be considered separately because it has been applied only
to one of the measured resonances. Although the uncertainty
of the correction was 20%, the contribution to the systematic
uncertainty of the capture kernel was only 0.7% in this case.

V. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE S-ABUNDANCES IN THE
PB-BI REGION

The slightly higher cross sections for s-wave resonances
measured at n TOF with respect to the values obtained
at GELINA may affect the synthesis of the Pb/Bi. This
holds preferentially at lower stellar temperature, because the
neutron sensitivity correction becomes less relevant above
100 keV, where the relative contribution of the neutron-
scattering channel decreases.

Qualitatively, the consequence of a higher 209Bi cross
section would reduce the survival probability and, hence,
the s-process abundance of this isotope, but this could be
compensated to some extent through an enhanced production
through α-recycling via 206,207Pb.

In the calculation of the Maxwellian averaged cross sections
(MACS), the n TOF resonances have been complemented
between 25 and 31 keV with resonances from Ref. [7] and
in the interval from 31 to 60 keV with capture areas from
Ref. [27]. The additional resonances represent 2% and 7% of
the MACS at kT = 5 and 8 keV, respectively. At lower stellar
temperature, comparison of the results in Table III with the
MACS obtained at GELINA [8] shows that the new values are
16% larger.

Beyond kT = 20 keV, the MACS is strongly influenced by
the average capture cross section above 80 keV, which has
been determined experimentally in Ref. [8]. For this reason,
the differences obtained in the strong s-wave resonances at
lower neutron energy do not affect substantially the MACS at
20–25 keV.

The MACS given in Table III refer to the lower temperature
regime of the common stellar s-process site associated with
thermally pulsing low mass AGB stars [29]. According to
the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model described in
Refs. [1,2], the s-process abundances of 208Pb and 209Bi
are essentially produced in stars of low metallicity. In this
model about 95% of the neutron exposure is because of the
13C(α, n)16O reaction, which operates during the interpulse
phase between He shell flashes at temperatures around ∼108 K,
corresponding to a thermal energy of kT ≈ 8 keV.

The additional neutron irradiation provided by the
22Ne(α, n)25Mg reaction at the higher thermal energy of
kT = 23 keV during the He shell flash is rather weak. Hence,
the abundances of isotopes with small cross sections are still
dominated by what has been produced at the lower-temperature
of the interpulse phase. Therefore, the low-temperature part of
the MACS is important for this stellar model. With respect to
the solar abundance tables of Anders and Grevesse [30], the

GCE model [2] provides s-process abundances of 206Pb, 207Pb,
and 209Bi at the epoch of the solar system formation of 62%,
79%, and 19%, respectively.

According to the sensitivity study reported in Ref. [5], the
present result (see Table III) is not expected to affect the
abundances of 206,207Pb by α-recycling from A = 210. This
was confirmed by a model calculation for a thermally pulsing
AGB star with M = 3M� and a metallicity [Fe/H] = −1.3,
which yields a negligible difference for the abundances of
206Pb and 207Pb. The s-process abundance of 209Bi itself was
found to decrease only slightly from 19% to 18.7%.

To evaluate the uncertainty on the solar 209Bi s-process
fraction, we have to consider first the uncertainty in the cross
section of this isotope in the two temperature regimes of the
stellar model. The main contribution because of the uncertainty
of the bismuth cross section is dominated by the conditions
during the He shell flash. At the higher temperature of the
22Ne(α, n)25Mg source (kT = 23 keV) the reaction flow via
208Pb(n, γ )209Bi is strongly enhanced over the situation during
the 13C(α, n)16O phase. This reflects the increase of the 208Pb
cross section with stellar temperature [31]. The net effect of
the uncertainty on the 209Bi cross section to its solar s-process
abundance is found to be 6%.

In the evaluation of the final s-process abundance of
bismuth, three aditional uncertainties have to be considered:
(i) the effect of the uncertainty in the 208Pb cross section,
which directly affects the s production of 209Bi by 6.5% (see
Table VII in Ref. [5]), (ii) the 7%–8% uncertainty of the solar
bismuth abundance (Refs. [30,32]), and (iii) a further 10%
for the uncertainties related to the s-process model and for
modeling GCE [2]. In summary the s-process contribution
to solar bismuth is obtained as 19±3%, corresponding to an
r-process residual of 81±3%.

This result is in agreement with the r-process calculation of
Ref. [33] using the waiting point approximation and improved
mass formulae, which yield an r-process contribution between
71% and 90%. A similar result is reported in Ref. [4], where
the calculations give 77% and 92% r-process contributions
depending on the initial seed composition.

VI. ESTIMATION OF THE THERMAL CAPTURE

capture process cannot account for this discrepancy. In fact, a
preliminary estimate of this component leads to a negligible
contribution to the thermal cross-section value [34].

The resonance parameters of the ENDF and JENDL
libraries have been adjusted to reproduce the in-pile σ thγ
measurement by means of an expression such as Eq. (10).
With the improved, present data for the s-wave resonances this
inconsistency could be removed by introducing subthreshold
resonances in the evaluated data files.

VII. SUMMARY

At the CERN n TOF facility the time-of-flight method has
been employed with the pulse-height-weighting technique to
determine the neutron-capture cross section of bismuth in the
resolved resonance region.

The main improvement with respect to previous measure-
ments is because of an optimized detection setup, by which
the crucial neutron sensitivity could be considerably reduced.
All remaining sources of systematic uncertainties have been
thoroughly treated by detailed Monte Carlo simulations.
Resonance energies (E◦), widths (�γ ), and capture areas
have been determined by an R-matrix analysis covering the
energy range from 0.8 to 23 keV. The results show larger
capture areas for the s-wave resonances, yielding a 16%
enhancement of the stellar neutron capture rate at thermal
energies between 5 and 8 keV compared with recent data [8].
The new cross section results for 209Bi, combined with recent
improvements in the cross section of 208Pb [5], yield a solar
s-process abundance of 19(3)% for bismuth. The resulting
r-process residual of 81(3)% represents a reliable constraint
for r-process calculations [33].
