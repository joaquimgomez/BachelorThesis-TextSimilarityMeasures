Abstract

A sensitivity analysis for the new generation of fast reactors [Salvatores (2008)] has shown the importance of improved cross sec-

tion data for several actinides. Among them, the 240,242Pu(n,f) cross sections require an accuracy improvement to 1-3% and 3-5%,

respectively, from the current level of 6% and 20%. At the Van de Graaff facility of the Institute for Reference Materials and Mea-

surements (JRC-IRMM) the fission cross section of the two isotopes was measured relative to two secondary standard reactions,
237Np(n,f) and 238U(n,f), using a twin Frisch-grid ionization chamber. The secondary standard reactions were benchmarked through

measurements against the primary standard reaction 235U(n,f) in the same geometry. Sample masses were determined by means

of low-geometry alpha counting or/and a 2π Frisch-grid ionization chamber, with an uncertainty lower than 2%. The neutron flux
and the impact of scattering from material between source and target was examined, the largest effect having been found in cross

section ratio measurements between a fissile and a fertile isotope. Our 240,242Pu(n,f) cross sections are in agreement with previous

experimental results and slightly lower than present evaluations. In case of the 242Pu(n,f) reaction no evidence for a resonance at

En=1.1 MeV was found.

1. Introduction

For the design of the new Generation-IV nuclear power plants the accuracy of several nuclear data needs to be

improved in certain energy regions. A report issued by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency [Salvatores (2008)] pointed

out the most relevant nuclear data needs for fast reactors, not only related with the reactor core but, additionally, related

with structural materials. Within this list the neutron-induced fission cross sections of 240,242Pu were requested to be

improved from the current uncertainty of 6% for 240Pu and 20% for 242Pu to a target accuracy within 1-3% and 3-5%,

respectively.

To address some of the needs for the development of the future nuclear power reactors and their corresponding

fuel cycles the ANDES collaboration (Accurate Nuclear Data for nuclear Energy Sustainability) [ANDES (2010)]

developed a program of specifically targeted actions. The present work, as part of this collaboration, provides new

fission cross section data for 240Pu(n,f) and 242Pu(n,f). The fission cross section of the two isotopes was measured

relative to two secondary standard reactions, 237Np(n,f) and 238U(n,f), using a twin Frisch-grid ionization chamber.

The secondary standard reactions were benchmarked through measurements against the primary standard reaction
235U(n,f) in the same geometry. Finally, a detailed study of the necessary corrections to our cross section data was

carried out, too.

2. Experimental setup

At the Van de Graaff accelerator of the JRC-IRMM protons were accelerated to produce a quasi-monoenergetic

neutron beam through two different reactions: 7Li(p,n)7Be and T(p,n)3He. The neutron energy range between 0.3

and 3 MeV was covered. A Twin Frisch-Grid Ionization Chamber (TFGIC) was used as fission fragment detector.

As counting gas, P10 gas (90% Ar + 10% CH4) was used first and later replaced by CH4, at a constant flow rate

of ca. 50 ml/min (100 ml/min when using CH4) and a pressure of 105 kPa. A schematic drawing of the setup

may be found elsewhere [Salvador-Castiñeira (2014)]. The five electrodes of the TFGIC (two anodes, two grids and

a cathode) were connected to charge-sensitive pre-amplifiers. The output signals were fed into 12-bit wave-form

digitizers (WFD) with a sampling speed of 100 Ms/s. The cathode signal was used as trigger after treated with a

Timing Filter Amplifier (TFA) and a Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD), where an electronic threshold was set

for rejecting α-particles. The recorded signal traces were stored and processed offline using a root-based digital signal
processing (DSP) library [ROOT (2014)].

The plutonium and the standard isotope samples were produced by the target preparation group of JRC-IRMM.

Table 1 provides an extended description of the samples. The mass of the 240Pu sample was chosen to minimize its

α-activity. The mass of all the samples were measured by means of low geometry α-counting, reaching uncertainties
below 1% for all samples, but for 235U. The high uncertainty on the 235U sample mass is due to the complexity of

the α-branching of this isotope. Additionally, the 238U and the 235U sample were measured again using a Single
Frisch-Grid Ionization Chamber, obtaining results within uncertainties compared with the low geometry α-counting
method.

A study of the homogeneity of the 237Np and 240,242Pu samples was performed doing a scan of the α-activity of
the sample at different places on its surface. Results showed that the vacuum deposited samples (i.e. 237Np) have a

very high homogeneity, whilst the electrodeposited ones (i.e. 240,242Pu) have an increased density of mass in the outer

diameter. For the 240Pu the outer diameter has on average 11.4% higher mass density than the inner one. In the case

of 242Pu the outer diameter has 7.4% higher mass density than the inner one.

3. Fission cross section measurements

Several measurement campaigns were performed. The ratios measured were 240,242Pu(n,f)/237Np(n,f),
240,242Pu(n,f)/235U(n,f), 237Np(n,f)/235U(n,f), 238U(n,f)/235U(n,f), 240,242Pu(n,f)/238U(n,f) and 237Np(n,f)/238U(n,f).

reaction, respectively. The excited state of the recoil nucleus of the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction starts at ≈0.7 MeV and has
around 0.4 MeV less energy than the ground state. The differential cross section of the excited state is at least one

order of magnitude lower than the ground state and its corresponding correction is below 1%. The correction due to

the sample spot size and homogeneity is below 3%.

The spontaneous fission counts (CS F) were calculated using the fission half-lives obtained for 240,242Pu in Salvador-
Castiñeira (2013). The efficiency (�) included the effects of anisotropy of the fission fragment distribution, the neutron
momentum transfer and the thickness of the sample; additionally, the position of the target relative to the neutron beam

(down- or up-stream) was accounted for [Carlson (1974)].

One of the most relevant correction to be applied was the interaction of the neutron beam with the matter between

the neutron producing target and the deposits inside the TFGIC. This interaction was studied carefully by means of

MCNP calculations and will be explained hereafter.

3.1. Neutron background correction

A non-desirable neutron background was generated through inelastic scattering on material in between the neutron

production target and the sample deposits as well as by neutron returning from the walls (room-return). Two setup

configurations were used during the experiments. The first one consisted mainly of a neutron producing target cooled

by 2 mm of water and, at 7 cm distance, the samples were placed at the center of the TFGIC. The second configuration

consisted of a water layer of 1 mm and, additionally, the TFGIC and part of the beam line were shielded by a B4C-

paraffin cage. The latter configuration was used when the 235U reference sample was employed to prevent thermalized

neutrons from room-return to induce fission in 235U.

The neutron energy distribution, its emission angle and emission probability entered the simulations according to

the tables in Liskien (1973, 1975). The result of the simulation was the average flux over the sample surface as a

function of the incident neutron energy normalized by the neutron-induced fission cross section of the corresponding

isotope. The influence of the thermalized neutron background was more severe when a fissile isotope (i.e. 235U) was

used. In addition, the correction factors were higher for the first setup configuration since the water layer was thicker.

3.2. Sources of uncertainty

The uncertainties related to the experiment are listed in Table 2. The largest contribution to the uncertainty is

due to the 235U mass uncertainty (when the cross section is normalized to this standard), the ENDF/B-VII.1 (2011)

evaluation for the 237Np(n,f) cross section, when used, the efficiency uncertainty and the spontaneous fission rate

uncertainty. The total uncertainty for each ratio measurement is lower than 3% in cases where the reference cross

section was 235U(n,f) or 238U(n,f). In the case of a normalization with the 237Np(n,f) cross section the total uncertainty

is close to 5%. The statistical uncertainty is, in most of individual data sets, around 0.5%, except for a single case

where it amounts to 1.4%.

4. Results and discussions

4.1. 238U(n,f) cross section

The 238U(n,f) cross section was measured relative to 235U(n,f). Figure 1 presents the results obtained after applying

all the corrections described above (red crosses). The ENDF/B-VII.1 (2011), JEFF 3.2 (2009) and JENDL 4.0 (1995)

are plotted. The results of this experiment are 10% lower than the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation and 10% higher than

the JEFF 3.2 at the threshold region (around 1.6 MeV). Nevertheless, at the plateau region, the present data is in

good agreement with the JEFF 3.2 evaluation and the previous data of Lamphere (1956); and 6% higher than the

ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation.

4.2. 237Np(n,f) cross section

Three sets of measurements were performed to determine the 237Np(n,f) cross section. First, the 238U(n,f) cross

section was used as reference in two configurations: with and without shielding. The results achieved were within

uncertainties. Then, a measurement with the shielding configuration and using the 235U(n,f) cross section as reference

was done, first, using a LiF neutron producing target (from 0.5 MeV up to 1.8 MeV) and, second, using a TiT neutron

producing target (from 1.6 MeV up to 3 MeV). The results normalized to 238U(n,f) showed a 5-7% higher cross

section than the present evaluations and in good agreement with the results of Paradela et al. (2010). Additionally, the

results normalized with the 235U(n,f) cross section and using the TiT neutron producing target were in agreement with

the ones normalized to 238U(n,f). Nevertheless, when using the LiF neutron producing target and the 235U(n,f) cross

section the results obtained were in concordance with the present evaluations, thus 5% lower than the cross section

obtained at 1.6 MeV and 1.8 MeV when using the TiT target.

In Figure 1 two weighted averages of the three data sets are shown. In first place, the weighted average was

done with all the above data sets normalized using the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation (red crosses). In second place, the

weighted average was calculated after normalizing the 238U(n,f) data set to the cross section obtained in the previous

subsection (green stars).

4.3. 240Pu(n,f) cross section

In the case of 240Pu(n,f) three different measurements were done. The first two using the setup without shielding

and relative to 237Np(n,f) (using a LiF neutron producing target) and relative to 238U(n,f) (using a TiT target). The

third measurement was done with the shielding configuration and using as reference 235U(n,f) (with a LiF target). The

data taken at the threshold region is in agreement with the present evaluations, either using 237Np(n,f) as reference or
235U(n,f). At the plateau region all the sets are around 2-5% lower than the evaluations. When using the 238U(n,f) cross

section as reference at 1.6 MeV and 1.7 MeV the cross section shape of the data set was not resembling the evaluations,

a similar effect was observed at the same energies with the results obtained with the ratio 237Np(n,f)/238U(n,f).

Two weighted averages of the three measurements are plotted in Figure 2. One using the corresponding ENDF

evaluation for all the reference isotopes (red crosses) and one using the present data normalized to the 237Np(n,f) data

set and the 238U(n,f) set (green stars). At the threshold region the two weighted averages are in agreement, and in

concordance with the evaluations. Nevertheless, at the plateau region the weighted average using this experiment data

maintains better the cross section shape and differs only by 2% with the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation. The data at the

plateau region are in agreement with the values of Laptev (2004) and Staples (1998).

4.4. 242Pu(n,f) cross section

Four measurements were performed to determine the 242Pu(n,f) cross section. Two measurements were done

without shielding using the 237Np(n,f) and the 238U(n,f) cross section. The other two measurements were done relative

to the 235U(n,f) cross section and using the shielding; one with a LiF neutron producing target and the other with a

TiT. At the threshold region, the present results using different reference cross sections are in agreement with the

evaluations up to 0.7 MeV. From this energy until 1.0 MeV the present results are around 5-10% lower than the

evaluation. At the resonance-like peak structure visible in the evaluations at 1.0-1.1 MeV, the present results (either

taken relative to 237Np(n,f) or relative to 235U(n,f)) are as well around 10% lower than evaluations. At the plateau

region, the values obtained are systematically 5-7% lower than the evaluations, except for the data taken relative to

the 235U(n,f) cross section using a TiT target which are in agreement with the evaluations. At 1.6 MeV and 1.7 MeV

the values obtained relative to 238U(n,f) do not conserve the cross section shape, a similar effect was seen for the ratios
237Np(n,f)/238U(n,f) and the 240Pu(n,f)/238U(n,f).

In Figure 2 two weighted averages of the present data are plotted. The first one with all the data sets explained

above normalized with the corresponding ENDF/B-VII.1 cross section (red crosses). The second one using, when

possible, the present results for the 237Np(n,f) and the 238U(n,f) cross section (green stars). At threshold, the present

experiment agrees with previous data sets and evaluations up to 0.7 MeV. From this energy to 1.5-1.6 MeV, the

results are ≈10% lower than evaluations, without reproducing the resonance-like structure, but in agreement with the
experiment of Staples (1998) and Tovesson (2009). At higher energies the second weighted average agrees with the

present evaluations.

5. Conclusions

The neutron-induced fission cross section was measured for 240,242Pu using a TFGIC at the Van de Graaff facility

of the JRC-IRMM. The incident neutron energy covered the range between 0.3 and 3 MeV. Detailed studies of the

efficiency of the measurement setup, the spontaneous fission half-lives of both 240,242Pu and the neutron spectrum im-

pinging the samples were performed to meet the target accuracy set out by the Nuclear Energy Agency. Measurements

against three reference fission cross section reactions were performed, 237Np(n,f), 235U(n,f) and 238U(n,f). In the case

of the 240Pu(n,f) cross section the present results are in agreement at the threshold region with evaluations, but at the

plateau region the values are about 2% lower. For the 242Pu(n,f) cross section, this experiment agrees at threshold only

to 0.7 MeV, at higher energies the discrepancy reaches 10% with lower values than evaluations and, in any case the

present data cannot confirm the resonance-like structure around 1.1 MeV. At energies above 1.5 MeV, the results are

in agreement with previous experimental data and present evaluations. Additionally, results have been obtained for

the 237Np(n,f) and the 238U(n,f) cross section.
