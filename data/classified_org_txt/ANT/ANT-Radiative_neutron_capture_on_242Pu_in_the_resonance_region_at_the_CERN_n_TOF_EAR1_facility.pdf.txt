The spent fuel of current nuclear reactors contains fissile plutonium isotopes that can be combined with uranium
to make mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. In this way the Pu from spent fuel is used in a new reactor cycle, contributing
to the long-term sustainability of nuclear energy. However, an extensive use of MOX fuels, in particular in fast
reactors, requires more accurate capture and fission cross sections for some Pu isotopes. In the case of 242Pu there
are sizable discrepancies among the existing capture cross-section measurements included in the evaluations (all
from the 1970s) resulting in an uncertainty as high as 35% in the fast energy region. Moreover, postirradiation
experiments evaluated with JEFF-3.1 indicate an overestimation of 14% in the capture cross section in the fast
neutron energy region. In this context, the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) requested an accuracy of 8% in this
cross section in the energy region between 500 meV and 500 keV. This paper presents a new time-of-flight capture
measurement on 242Pu carried out at n_TOF-EAR1 (CERN), focusing on the analysis and statistical properties of
the resonance region, below 4 keV. The 242Pu(n,γ ) reaction on a sample containing 95(4) mg enriched to 99.959%
was measured with an array of four C6D6 detectors and applying the total energy detection technique. The high
neutron energy resolution of n_TOF-EAR1 and the good statistics accumulated have allowed us to extend the
resonance analysis up to 4 keV, obtaining new individual and average resonance parameters from a capture cross
section featuring a systematic uncertainty of 5%, fulfilling the request of the NEA.

I. MOTIVATION

The future of nuclear energy points to the use of innovative
nuclear systems such as accelerator driven systems and Gen-IV
reactors aimed at the reduction of the nuclear waste. The
burned fuel from current thermal reactors can be recycled
in order to separate the plutonium from the spent fuel. This
plutonium contains around 66% of 239Pu and 241Pu (together),
which are fissile and can be thus combined with natural or
depleted uranium to make the mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. In
this way the Pu from spent fuel and the depleted uranium,
otherwise considered as waste, are used in a new reactor cycle,
contributing to the long-term sustainability of nuclear energy.
The use of MOX fuels has already been established on an
industrial scale in thermal power reactors in several countries,
but a more efficient use can be achieved in fast reactors [1].

The design and operation of these innovative systems
require improved knowledge of the neutron cross sections of
some of the isotopes present in the new fuel compositions
such as the MOX [2]. Among the neutron cross sections that

need to be improved in terms of accuracy, the NEA Subgroup
WPEC-26 [3] recommends that the capture cross section of
242Pu should be measured with an accuracy of 8–10 % in the
energy range between 2 keV and 500 keV (see Table I), which
includes both the resolved and unresolved resonance regions.

The first attempts to measure the 242Pu(n,γ ) reaction were
made in 1973 and 1975, when Poortmans et al. [4] and
Hockenbury et al. [5] used the time-of-flight technique for
measurements below 1.3 keV at the CBNM linear accelerator
(Geel, Belgium) and between 6 and 87 keV at RPI (Troy, USA),
respectively. A few years later, Wisshak and Käppeler [6,7]
measured the cross section in the unresolved resonance region
in two energy intervals, 10–90 keV and 50–250 keV. Recently,
another time-of-flight measurement was carried out with the
DANCE detector at LANSCE by Buckner et al. [8], covering
the region from thermal to 40 keV but resolving resonances
only up to 500 eV due to the limited neutron energy resolution
of the DANCE facility. Their results, with a final systematic
uncertainty around 6%, show a fairly good agreement with the
evaluations in the resonance region and a systematic reduction
of 20–30 % above 1 keV compared to ENDF/B-VII [9] (it is to
be noted that JEFF-3.2 [10] is in agreement with ENDF/B-VII
around 1 keV but 10–20 % larger at ∼10 keV).

The comparison of the measurements in the keV region
shows differences of about 35%. Indeed, interpretations with
the JEFF-3.1 library of the PROFIL and PROFIL-2 experi-
ments carried out in the fast reactor PHENIX have shown an
overestimation of about 14% of the 242Pu integral capture cross

section from 1 keV–1 MeV [11–13]. Aiming at improving the
evaluation of the fast energy range in terms of average param-
eters, the NEA, in its Nuclear Data High Priority Request List
(HPRL) [14], requests high-resolution capture measurements
with improved accuracy below 2 keV (see Table I). This should
also allow us to solve the present discrepancies among average
resonance parameters in the literature (see Table VII).

In order to respond to the target accuracies required by
the NEA in different energy ranges, listed in Table I, a new
time-of-flight measurement of the capture cross section of
242Pu was proposed and approved by the CERN INTC [18]
in 2013. The measurement was carried out at n_TOF-EAR1
in 2015 and preliminary results have been already presented
in Refs. [19,20]. While the measurement has provided data
from thermal up to at least 200 keV, this paper deals only with
the analysis of the resolved resonance region, which has been
extended from 1.3 keV to 4 keV. In the next section we describe
briefly the n_TOF-EAR1 facility, the samples and the detection
setup. The data analysis towards the capture yield is described
in Sec. III. Last, the analysis of the individual resonances and
their statistical properties are discussed in Secs. IV and V,
respectively.

II. MEASUREMENT AT N_TOF

A. n_TOF facility at CERN

The neutron beam at n_TOF is generated through spallation
of 20 GeV/c protons extracted in pulses from the CERN
Proton Synchrotron and impinging on cylindrical lead target
40 cm in length and 60 cm in diameter. These pulses feature
a nominal intensity of 7 × 1012 protons, delivered with a
time spread of σ = 7 ns at a maximum frequency of 0.83
Hz. The resulting high-energy (MeV-GeV) spallation neutrons
are partially slowed down in a surrounding water layer to
produce a white neutron beam that expands in energy from
thermal to a few GeV. The neutrons travel towards the two
experimental areas along two beam lines: EAR1 at 185 m
(horizontal) [21] and EAR2 at 19 m (vertical) [22]. Each of
the experimental areas is better suited for different type of
measurements depending on the specific requirements in terms
of flux and resolution. While EAR1 features a better time (i.e.,
neutron energy) resolution, the shorter vertical beam line of
EAR2 provides a poorer resolution but currently the highest
instantaneous white neutron flux worldwide (see Ref. [23]),

which makes it especially well suited for measuring highly
radioactive and/or small mass samples (see, for instance,
Ref. [24]). The measurement of the 242Pu(n,γ ) at n_TOF,
aiming at describing accurately the resonance region and not
affected by a high radioactivity background, was therefore
performed at EAR1.

B. 242Pu and ancillary measurements

The sample preparation was carried out within the EC
CHANDA project [25] by the JGU University of Mainz
and the HZDR research center in Germany. The material
used was 99.959% pure 242Pu (main impurities: 2 × 10−4
and 2 × 10−5 of 240Pu and 244Pu, respectively) provided by
ORNL. A set of seven thin targets 45 mm in diameter, in
order to cover the complete neutron beam, were prepared
by electrodeposition of 95(4) mg of 242Pu on thin (10 μm)
aluminum backings with a 50 nm Ti coating, resulting in targets
with an average areal density of 850 μg/cm2 of 242Pu, with
variations between targets within 7% (see Ref. [26] for the
details). The target thickness homogeneity, studied by means of
alpha radiography, was found to be 75%, leading to an overall
thickness inhomogeneity of the seven targets combined below
0.1%. The assembly of seven thin targets, sketched in Fig. 1,
features a total backing thickness of only 70 μm. This value
is significantly smaller than in previously used actinide targets
at n_TOF (see, for instance, Refs. [27–29]) and results in a
reduced neutron capture and scattering associated background.

During the experiment, with a total number of 3.17 × 1018
protons (i.e., approximately one month long), most (64%) of
the beam time was allocated to measure the Pu target. The
background induced by the sample assembly was determined
with an exact replica of the Pu target without the Pu deposits
using 24% of the beam time. This replica will be called the
dummy target hereafter. The background caused by the γ
rays in the beam was assessed by using a lead (1 mm thick)

target that scatters photons without perturbing significantly the
neutron beam. The measurement of a thick (100 μm) gold
target with the same diameter as the 242Pu one was used for
normalization via the saturated resonance method [30], and a
measurement with no target in the beam was used to estimate
the background level in the lead and gold measurements. Last,
measurements without beam were carried out without and with
the 242Pu targets in place for determining the environmental and
242Pu activity backgrounds. The details about the background
subtraction and normalization are given in Sec. III A.

C. Detection setup

As of today, two different detection systems are available
at n_TOF for capture experiments. The full γ -ray cascade can
be detected using the 4π BaF2 total absorption calorimeter
(TAC) [31], or just one of the γ rays of each cascade (total
energy detection technique, see Sec. III B) is detected with an
array of four low neutron sensitivity C6D6 detectors [32].

The array of four C6D6 was chosen for this measurement
mainly because these detectors suffer significantly less from
the so-called γ flash (i.e., prompt γ rays produced in the
spallation reactions) than the TAC, due to their fast response
and light components, thus allowing us to measure up to the
maximum required neutron energy (see Table I). The setup of
four detectors looking at the target from a backward position
(135° with respect to the beam) in order to minimize the
background from scattered in-beam γ rays is shown in the
top panel of Fig. 2. The bottom panel shows the corresponding
geometry implemented in the Monte Carlo simulation with

cascades emitted following the neutron capture on the 242Pu sample.

the GEANT4 toolkit [33,34] used for assessing the detection
efficiency (see Sec. III B).

Two additional detectors are used at n_TOF for monitoring
the proton and neutron beams. A wall current monitor
(so-called PKUP) measures the intensity of the proton beam
in each pulse. The neutron beam is monitored with the SiMon
system [35], an array of four silicon detectors placed outside
the beam and looking at a thin enriched lithium fluoride
foil for detecting the products of the 6Li(n,α) reaction,
whose cross section is considered a standard from thermal
energy to 1 MeV. The pulse-by-pulse intensities provided
by these two detectors have been found to be proportional
within 0.5%, which sets the accuracy in the scaling when
comparing or combining different measurements, for instance
for background subtraction and normalization.

Each of the detectors in the capture setup and the beam mon-
itoring system is connected to one channel of the n_TOF Data
acquisition system [36], which features 12-bit digitizers sam-
pling at 900 MSamples/s during 100 ms following the arrival of
the proton pulse to the spallation target (i.e., recording signals
of reactions induced by neutrons for energies down to 18
meV). The full data movies are automatically transferred from
the DAQ computers to the CERN Advanced Storage manager
(CASTOR) for their long-term storage and off-line analysis.

III. ANALYSIS

A. Data reduction

The digitized signals recorded by the n_TOF DAQ and
stored in CASTOR are analyzed using the pulse shape analysis
routine described in Ref. [37]. In particular, the C6D6 signals
are analyzed by comparing each of them with reference pulse
shapes characteristic of each detector (see Refs. [37,38] for
details). The amplitude, area and time-of-flight of each identi-
fied detector signal are stored together with the information
on the proton pulse (date, time, type, and intensity). The
corresponding neutron energy is then calculated using the
nonrelativistic formula:

En =
1

2
mn

(
L0 + λ(En)

t − t0

)2
, (1)

where mn is the neutron mass, L0 is the flight path from the
target exit to the experimental area, t is the signal time, t0
is the start time (calculated from the arrival of the γ flash to
each detector), and λ(En) is an energy-dependent equivalent
moderation length, related to the resolution function of the fa-
cility. The neutron energy dependence of λ reflects the fact that
neutrons of a given energy are not produced instantaneously
with the arrival of the proton beam but take some time to be
produced, moderated, and transported outside the spallation
target assembly (see Ref. [39] for a more detailed explanation).

Accurate amplitude-to-energy calibrations and gain stabil-
ity checks for the four C6D6 detectors were performed on a
weekly basis using 137Cs, 88Y, 241Am/9Be, and 244Cm/13C
calibration sources. The small time-dependent gain shifts
observed were corrected for and, as a result, the weighted
(defined in Sec. III B) counting rates remained constant within
0.5% along the full length of the experiment (one month).

FIG. 3. Unweighted counting rates per pulse for the 242Pu and
background measurements as a function of the neutron energy in the
full energy range measured at n_TOF-EAR1 (top). Energy deposition
in the C6D6 detectors corresponding to the full neutron energy range
analyzed in this paper (1 eV–4 keV) (middle) and with neutron energy
cuts to select just the largest resonance (2.67 eV) (bottom).

The measured counting rates as a function of neutron
energy (with energy deposited in the detectors Edep larger than
150 keV) are displayed in the top panel of Fig. 3, where it
is observed that the beam-off background (constant in time)

dominates only below 10 eV. The beam-dependent background
(dotted red line), determined with the measurement of the
dummy target, is the major contribution to the counting rate
at higher energies. The dashed green (light gray) curve in this
figure shows the level of the overall background, in which
the in-beam γ -ray background is also included. The latter,
although strongly suppressed due to the inclusion of 10B in
the moderator (see Ref. [21]), is still a relevant source of
background especially in the unresolved resonance region [19].
Last, the counting rate increases at neutron energies above 306
keV. This is related to the opening of the first inelastic channel
above the γ -ray energy detection threshold.

The middle and bottom panels of Fig. 3 show the measured
counting rates as a function of the deposited γ -ray energy.
While the middle panel contains data for all the neutron energy
range under study, the bottom panel corresponds just to neutron
energies inside the first capture resonance (2.1–3.3 eV). The
latter hence shows an enhanced capture to background ratio
compared to the detector response integrated over the full
neutron energy range of the resonance region. The spectra of
deposited energy indicate that the beam-off, i.e., the room and
242Pu sample activity background are mainly low energy γ
rays while the high-energy γ -ray background is related to the
beam (dummy).

Besides neutron capture, two additional neutron-induced
reactions in 242Pu can contribute to the measured counting
rate: neutron scattering and fission. Considering the elastic
scattering, the cross section is 10–100 times larger than capture
but the C6D6 detectors have a negligible neutron sensitivity (4
orders of magnitude below the efficiency for capture). There-
fore, the neutron scattering contribution has been considered
negligible. As for the fission, the efficiency of the detection
array is slightly larger than for capture due to the larger γ -ray
multiplicity. However, it is also considered negligible since the
fission cross section in the energy range of interest remains on
average 3 orders of magnitude below the one of capture with
the exception of few resonances excluded from the resonance
analysis (see Sec. IV),

B. Total energy detection technique

The detection efficiency depends, in general, on the cascade
pattern (i.e., the γ -ray energies and multiplicities). To avoid
this dependency, neutron capture measurements with C6D6
detectors are analyzed following the total energy detection
(TED) technique [40,41]. This is based on two principles:

(i) The efficiency of the detectors must be low enough so
that at most one γ ray per cascade is detected. The total
efficiency for detecting a cascade εc becomes

εc = 1 −
∏

i

(1 − εi) ≈
∑

i

εi , (2)

εi being the efficiency to detect a γ ray of the cascade.
The sum goes over all emitted gammas i.

(ii) The efficiency to detect each γ ray is proportional to
its energy Ei (εi = k · Ei), hence:

εc = k
∑

i

Ei = k · Ec. (3)

024605-5



J. LERENDEGUI-MARCO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 97, 024605 (2018)

Under these two conditions the efficiency for detecting a
cascade is proportional to the known energy of the cascade (Ec)
and independent of the actual decay path. However, the second
requirement is not fulfilled by C6D6 detectors and therefore a
mathematical manipulation of the detector response is needed
to achieve the proportionality between detection efficiency and
γ -ray energy: the counts recorded at each deposited energy are
weighted by a factor dependent on its energy (pulse height),
given by the so-called weighting function (WF). This is known
as the pulse height weighting technique (PHWT) [41].

Following the prescription from Ref. [41], the WF for each
sample (242Pu and 197Au) has been calculated from the detector
response to monoenergetic γ rays from 50 keV–10 MeV
obtained via Monte Carlo simulations of the detection system
carried out with a GEANT4 application developed for this
purpose [42]. The very detailed geometry implemented in
GEANT4, displayed in Fig. 2, includes even details of the Pu
target assembly in order to consider, among other effects, the
attenuation of photons in the 242Pu targets and backings as well
as the neutron self-shielding for the largest resonances. The
resulting WFs, calculated to have a proportionality constant
k = 1 in Eq. (3), are third- to fourth-degree polynomials
(depending on the sample). The application of these WFs to the
response of the detectors allows satisfying the proportionality
condition εi = k · Ei within 1% for all the simulated γ -ray en-
ergies between 0.1 and 10 MeV. The corrections and systematic
uncertainties associated to this technique are discussed in the
following section.

C. Corrections to the detection efficiency

The application of the PHWT results in a detection effi-
ciency numerically equal to the energy of the capture cascade
[Eq. (3) with k = 1]. This is in principle independent of
the decay pattern, but there are actually some effects and
corrections to be considered:

(i) the possible detection of more than one γ ray (multiple
counting) from a cascade in our detection setup, fmc;

(ii) the counts lost below the detection threshold in γ -ray
energy, fthr; and

(iii) the probability of internal conversion leading to
the emission of nondetectable electrons instead of
γ rays, fce.

The associated corrections fmc, fthr, and fce are calculated
with the help of Monte Carlo simulations of the detection sys-
tem response to capture cascades. The cascade generator CAP-
TUGENS [43] was used to generate realistic cascades emitted by
the compound nuclei 243Pu and 198Au at an excitation energy
Sn, considering in both cases a completely known level scheme,
γ -ray transition probabilities, and internal conversion factors
(all from ENSDF [44]) below a certain excitation energy Ecut
(400 keV for 243Pu and 1600 keV for 198Au), and then a
statistical model (based on level density parameters and photon
strength functions) to generate transitions starting above Ecut.
The statistical parameters were taken from Refs. [45] and
[46] for 198Au and 243Pu, respectively. The generated cascades
were coupled to the GEANT4 application developed to simulate
the detector response for the PHWT, resulting in the good

agreement between the experimental and simulated responses
shown in Fig. 4 for both 242Pu(n,γ ) and 197Au(n,γ ) cascades.

The correction factors are calculated by comparing the
efficiency from the simulation of cascades when each of these
effects is included with respect to the expected value εc = Ec,
given by Eq. (3) with k = 1. The fmc correction, below 0.5%,
is already applied during the analysis by considering only
one of the simultaneously detected γ rays (i.e., belonging to
the same capture cascade). fthr and fce have been calculated
for several detection thresholds, showing that fce is at most
0.4% for the minimum threshold of 150 keV applied in the
subsequent analysis. Therefore only fthr is sizable and quite
different for each isotope, ranging up to 15% and 8% for
242Pu(n,γ ) and 197Au(n,γ ), respectively, for energy thresholds
smaller than 250 keV. In order to keep this correction small, a
threshold of 150 keV was used for the analysis. The values of
correction factors obtained and their associated uncertainties
are summarized in Table II.

The validation of these corrections is assessed by comparing
the corresponding corrected counting rates for different energy

thresholds. The results for thresholds between 150 and 250 keV
agree within 0.2% and 1% for 197Au(n,γ ) and 242Pu(n,γ ),
respectively. Therefore, a systematic uncertainty of 1.5%
has been estimated for these corrections. Additionally, the
simulated cascades allow to estimate the deviation from the
PHWT theory given by Eq. (3) related to the performance of the
weighting functions. The deviation is found to be within 0.5%
for both the 242Pu and Au samples and this value is considered
as the associated uncertainty.

D. Capture yield

The neutron capture yield is the probability for an incident
neutron to undergo a capture reaction and is related to the
capture σγ and total σtot cross sections as:

Y (En) = (1 − e−nσtot )
σγ

σtot
, (4)

where n represent the sample’s areal density. Under the thin
target approximation nσtot � 1, which applies in this measure-
ment with the exception of the largest resonance, the capture
cross section can be directly extracted from the experimentally
obtained capture yield Y = nσγ . The latter is calculated as:

Y (En) =
fmcfthrfce

fSRM
· Cw(En) − Bw(En)

�(En) · εc
, (5)

Cw and Bw being the weighted distributions of total and
background counts per pulse obtained from the measured
counting rates displayed in Fig. 3, �(En) the total number of
neutrons of a given energy En reaching n_TOF-EAR1 in each
pulse [47], εc the detection efficiency [see Eq. (3)] and fmc,
fthr, and fce the correction factors to the efficiency discussed
in the previous section. Last,fSRM is the absolute normalization
factor obtained via the saturated resonance method (SRM)
[30] using the first (4.9 eV) resonance of 197Au. The 100 μm
thickness of the gold target is such that this resonance saturates,
i.e., almost all neutrons undergo at least one interaction, and
this saturation level provides the means to normalize the 242Pu
capture yield. The saturated resonance of 197Au has been fitted
for each detector to extract individual normalization factors
fSRM, as listed in Table III. Figure 5 shows the fit of this
resonance in the average yield of the four detectors using the
SAMMY code [48].

The deviations in fSRM between the individual detectors
are related mainly to uncertainties in the efficiency and in the
positioning (distance and angle) of the detectors with respect
to the target. Both effects affect equally to the 197Au and 242Pu

tor from the fit of the 197Au(n,γ ) 4.9 eV saturated resonance using the
SAMMY code. The right column presents the ratios of the individual
normalized 242Pu 2.67 eV resonance kernels, Ynorm, with respect to
the average value of the four detectors, 〈Ynorm〉. The uncertainties in
the table are due the uncertainty in the fit of the saturated resonance
and the counting statistics.

measurements and therefore cancel out with this normalization
method. A verification of the correctness of the individual fSRM
comes from the fact that the 2.67 eV resonance kernels in the
normalized 242Pu yields from individual detectors agree with
the average within about 1%, as presented in Table III.

The systematic uncertainties from different sources con-
tributing to the resulting yield are summarized in Table IV. The
uncertainty related to the relative positioning along the beam
line of the 197Au and 242Pu samples is assumed to be ±1 mm,
leading to a 1.5% additional uncertainty in the normalization.
Table IV also includes the energy-dependent uncertainty of the
neutron flux shape, 1% below 100 eV and 2% at higher energies
[47]. It is to be noted that the uncertainty in the background
subtraction is considered negligible because it does not affect
the analysis of individual resonances. The resulting quadratic
sum of partial systematic uncertainties in the 242Pu yield is
3.2% or smaller. An additional uncertainty of 4% related to
the determination of the sample mass has to be considered

in the subsequent extraction of the capture cross section. The
resulting systematic uncertainty in the cross section is 5.1% or
smaller, clearly lower than the 8% required by the NEA for the
design and operation of advanced nuclear devices (see Table I).

One last consideration in the calculation of the yield is
related to the statistical fluctuations. The capture yield obtained
using the prescription of the PHWT shows enhanced statistical
fluctuations, especially in the resonances with few counts, with
respect to those related to counting statistics. These enhanced
fluctuations, inherent in the PHWT method, limit the maximum
energy of analyzable resonances. In order to expand the energy
range in the subsequent resonance analysis, we have verified
that for 242Pu (may be true for heavy 0+ nuclei, in general),
the cascade spectrum is the same independently of the neutron
energy. Thus, the unweighted yield scaled with the appropriate
average weighting factor, which accounts for the efficiency and
the associated corrections described in this section, is perfectly
compatible within the uncertainties with the one extracted
following the usual PHWT method. Given all of the above,
the unweighted scaled yield has been chosen for the analysis
in Sec. IV.

IV. RESONANCE ANALYSIS

A. Individual resonance parameters

Once the capture yield has been obtained, the resonance
analysis is performed using the SAMMY code [48], which
allows fitting experimental time-of-flight data using the Reich-
Moore approximation to the R-matrix theory. The code features
different models to consider experimental effects such as
self-shielding, multiple scattering, residual background, and
Doppler and resolution broadenings.

A total of 251 resonances have been observed and analyzed
between 1 eV and 4 keV, leaving out of our analysis the
few resonances where fission contributes significantly (see
Table VIII). In order to extract the individual resonance param-
eters, first the spin of all resonances have been set to J = 1/2

Then, the fission widths have been fixed to the values measured
by Auchampaugh et al. [49] or Weigmann et al. [50], assuming
a value of 0.01 meV for the rest, as recommended in JEFF-3.2
(see Table VIII). The radiative capture width is expected to
be a constant (actually, it is expected from statistical model to
fluctuate around the average value with a rms of about ∼3%
[51]). In order to determine the value of 〈
γ 〉, a systematic
study of the χ2 of the SAMMY calculations (experimental cature
yield vs. parameterized yield as a function of 
γ and 
n) was
carried out among the largest resonances below 1.5 keV, using
those showing a well-bound 
γ around the minimum χ

2 to
compute the average 
γ . The average value 〈
γ 〉 resulting from
this analysis has been used as a fixed parameter for the analysis
of all the other resonances, where the only free parameters are
the resonance energy and neutron width. An example of the
mentioned distributions of the reduced χ2 (i.e., χ2 over the
number of experimental points) as a function of the radiative
and neutron width values is given in Fig. 6 for the two largest
resonances, both showing a well-bound minimum. While this
method worked for the majority of the fitted resonances, some
SAMMY fits of resonances with 
n � 
γ , featuring a very low
sensitivity to 
n in the fit, converged after many iterations
towards too large 
n values, inconsistent with the evaluated
resonance parameters extracted from a multichannel analysis
of all available measurements. For those cases, the 
n was

then the

cases where one can see that a large reduction in 
n does not
compromise the quality of the fit. The difficulties to adjust

n on capture data are due to the absence of transmission data
with the same sample to constrain the value of 
n in the SAMMY
calculation.

Regarding the Doppler model used in the calculations with
SAMMY, this plays a role only at low energies. Indeed, the
analysis of the lowest-energy resonance with the commonly
employed free gas model (FGM) is not satisfactory, giving, for
instance, a reduced χ2 of 4.7. The use of the more realistic
crystal lattice model (CLM), in this case with a uranium oxide
phonon description (SAMMY example file 124d), results in a
better fit, as shown in Fig. 8, with a reduced χ2 of only 1.9.
Regarding the second largest resonance, at 53.5 eV, the fits are
excellent with both models and the extracted radiative kernels
agree within 0.1%. Therefore the resonances at higher energies
were all analyzed using the FGM, since the difference with

respect to the results with the CLM are negligible but the
computing time is significantly reduced.

The resulting list of individual resonance parameters and
radiative kernels up to 4 keV is presented in Table VIII of
Appendix. In this table several resonances are marked as
possible p waves. The criterion for marking possible p-wave
resonances is based on the probability of occurrence of p-wave
resonances (see next section). Figure 9 shows several energy
ranges of the measured capture yield below 1.3 keV together
with the corresponding SAMMY fit and the yields corresponding
to the ENDF/B-VII [9] and JEFF-3.2 [10] evaluated cross
sections.

The good neutron energy resolution of n_TOF-EAR1 com-
bined with the high statistics of the new capture data have
allowed us to extend the resolved resonance region up to 4
keV, which is significantly higher than the current limit in
the evaluations, which are based on the resonance parameters
reported in Refs. [4,49,50]. This extension is illustrated in
Figs. 9–10, showing SAMMY fits from just above the current
920 eV and 1.3 keV energy limit for resonance parameters
in ENDF/B-VII.1 [9] and JEFF-3.2 [10], respectively, up to 4
keV. In the resonance analysis above 1.3 keV, the energies and
neutron widths in Refs. [49,50] were used as initial parameters
for the fit and to help identifying small resonances.

B. Comparison to evaluated cross sections

The different resonances displayed in Fig. 9 are illustrative
examples of resonances currently present in the evaluations
that can be confirmed (75) or rejected (7) according to the new
capture data. For instance, we confirm the presence of a doublet
at 504 eV, as already suggested by Poortmans et al. [4], but
we do not see the resonance at 14 eV listed in evaluations,
confirming what Buckner et al. reported [8]. In addition,
19 new resonances have been identified within JEFF-3.2’s
resonance region (some examples in Fig. 9). Since these new
resonances are usually weak, some of them are most likely
p-wave resonances, as it is discussed in Sec. V.

The quantitative cross-section comparison between the re-
sults of this work and of JEFF-3.2 is made in terms of radiative
kernel (RK ), calculated from the resonance parameters as:

with the spin factor gJ defined as gJ = (2J+1)(2I+1)(2i+1) , where
J,I = 0 and i = 0.5 are the spins of the resonance, target
nucleus, and neutron, respectively. Radiative kernels (RK ) have
been compared individually for each resonance and integrated
over 200 eV energy intervals. The RK of each resonance is
listed in Appendix together with the ratio of n_TOF with
respect to the RKS calculated from the resonance parameters
in JEFF-3.2 and in the recent measurement at DANCE [8]. The
listed RK ratios have been studied as a function of the fission,
scattering, and capture widths in order to look for correlations
that could hint at systematic errors or biases, but no correlations
have been found.

The top panel of Fig. 11 shows the individual ratios of
n_TOF RKS (this work) with respect to JEFF-3.2 (72 common
resonances). This comparison stops at 1300 eV, since no
resonance parameters are included in the evaluations above
this energy. For an overall comparison, the individual RKS
have been grouped over 200 eV energy intervals for n_TOF and
JEFF-3.2. The ratio of the integrated RK (i.e., cross section) in
each energy interval is shown with a red line in the top panel of
Fig. 11, where the shadowed area corresponds to the statistical
uncertainty of the sum of RKS in each range. A minimum
integral ratio n_TOF/JEFF of 1.028(5) is found below 200 eV,

work with respect to JEFF-3.2 (black) as a function of the neutron
energy together with the weighted mean (dashed blue line). The solid
red line coresponds to the ratio of the integrated RK over 200 eV
intervals and the shadowed area illustrates the statistical uncertainty
of the RK integral in each energy interval. Bottom: Ratio of individual
RK in this work to JEFF-3.2 and DANCE below 500 eV together with
their weighted means (dashed and solid line, respectively). The values
in brackets in the legend correspond to the weighted mean of the ratios.

400–800 eV region and compatible results within the statistical
uncertainty are obtained above 1 keV.

The bottom panel of Fig. 11 zooms in on the first 500 eV and
includes the ratio of individual RKS in this work with respect to
the recent measurement in DANCE (35 common resonances).
Overall, the n_TOF data suggest that the RKS are on average
4.0 (4)% higher than JEFF-3.2 and 6.2 (10)% higher than
DANCE, in terms of weighted mean (weighted on radiative
kernel). The comparison of the measured and evaluated RK
for the largest 242Pu resonance, at 2.67 eV, indicates that the
new value is 4.2 (2)% larger than the one in JEFF-3.2 (or
ENDF-VII.1). For the same resonance, according to Ref. [8],
DANCE reports a resonance integral larger than the evaluations
by 2.4%.

The 4% higher cross section found in this work below
1 keV with respect to the evaluations does not compromise
the suggested [11–13] reduction of 14% in the integral cross
section between 1 keV and 1 MeV because the evaluations

are based on completely different data sets below and above
1.3 keV. In the resonance region, the resonance widths and
energies are taken from Refs. [4,49,50], while the unresolved
resonance region is based in the 40-year-old measurements
of Refs. [5–7] between 6 and 210 keV. The analysis of the
unresolved resonance region from the n_TOF experiment
described herein will be presented and compared with the
evaluations, those data and the recent measurement at DANCE
[8] in a forthcoming work aimed at shedding some light on the
possible overestimation of 14% in the high-energy evaluated
capture cross section of 242Pu.

V. STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF RESONANCE
PARAMETERS

Average resonance parameters of s-wave resonances—
specifically, the average resonance radiative width, 〈
γ 〉, neu-
tron strength function, S0, and the average resonance spacing,
D0—can be obtained from the individual resonance parameters
in Table VIII.

A. Average radiative width

Total radiative widths are given by the sum of partial radia-
tion widths to all levels below the neutron separation energy Sn.
Individual partial radiation widths from different neutron reso-
nances to a fixed level are expected to fluctuate according to the
Porter-Thomas distribution around the expectation value. The
huge number of available final levels makes the distribution of
radiation widths significantly narrower than the Porter-Thomas
distribution, especially for heavy nuclei. Statistical model
calculations of total radiative widths for 242Pu, carried out
using the constant-temperature level density model, indicate
that the individual 
γ values of s-wave resonances should
fluctuate within 3–3.5 % around 〈
γ 〉. The average total
radiative width 〈
γ 〉 has been obtained from 27 resonances for
which both 
γ and 
n were fitted (
γ values with uncertainties
in Table VIII), following the steps explained at the end of
Sec. IV A. This set of total radiation widths is shown in Fig. 12
with its weighted average, where the dark and light shadowed
regions correspond to the uncertainty of the average value
and the standard deviation of the weighted distribution of

γ values, respectively. The value 〈
γ 〉 = 24.8(5) meV, is
recommended according to our analysis. Our expectation result
is higher than the expectation values in the literature, summa-
rized in Table VII and significantly larger than the value in
ENDF/B-VII.1.

B. Strength function

range, S0 = 0.91(8)10−4, has a reduced uncertainty compared
to previous experimental values (see, for instance, Ref. [4])
due to the much larger number of observed resonances. The
value of S0 obtained is slightly smaller but still compatible with
the ones provided by JEFF-3.2 (1.0010−4) and ENDF/B-VII.1
(1.0210−4) and supports the reduction of S0 proposed by Rich
et al. [0.91(20)10−4].

In the energy range above 3.7 keV, the S0 was found to
be strongly dependent on two resonances. First, the resonance
at around 3840 eV could not be fitted using a value of 
n
compatible with the overall S0 value from lower energies
unless a doublet was included. Following the same consistency
criterion, the neutron width of the resonance at 3728 eV, with a
very large value reported in Ref. [49], was set to 200(180) meV
since the SAMMY calculation did not converge to a unique value
due to the scarce statistics. Removing this resonance would
affect the extracted value of S0 less than 1% and even if the
full energy range above 3700 eV is discarded the value of S0
obtained from 0–3700 eV would be just 1.7% smaller than the
S0 = 0.91 × 10−4 suggested from this analysis.

Last, the obtained S0 is not affected by possible missing s-
wave resonances or misidentified p waves since they represent
a negligible fraction of the resonance strength.

FIG. 14. Cumulative number of resonances as a function of the
neutron energy showing a compatible D0 for JEFF-3.2 and this work
up to ∼500 eV. The solid red line corresponds to the linear fit of
this distribution in the energy region below 1.1 keV (see text for the
details).

It shows an increasing fraction of resonances missed due to
the reduced statistics with increasing energy. In this figure we
see that JEFF-3.2 is in fairly good agreement with this work
up to ∼500 eV, while at higher energies new resonances are
observed in this work. A linear fit to our data below 1.1 keV,
shown in Fig. 14, indicates a value of D0 = 12.5(7) eV, but
this estimate can be affected by missing s-wave resonances or
p-wave resonances wrongly considered as s-wave.

The analysis of the number of observed p-wave and missing
s-wave resonances as well as a realistic estimate of the level
spacing from our data was carried out with the help of statistical
model simulations. Several thousands of artificial resonance
sequences were generated using the extracted values of S0
and 〈
γ 〉 and the value of p-wave neutron strength function
S1 = 2.07 × 10−4 recommended by Rich et al. in Ref. [17] for
a consistent description of the fast energy range with average
neutron properties. These sequences were simulated for several
different values of D0 and the consistency of predictions with
observables was checked assuming a threshold for observation
in gJ 
0. The main goal of this study was to extract the expected
number of s-wave resonances below the threshold and the
number of p-wave resonances above the threshold from these
simulations.

Actually, several different values of the threshold were
tested. The lowest threshold Tlow was estimated from the
experimental data and corresponds to the weakest observed
resonances. The medium and highest thresholds correspond
to Tmed = 3 × Tmin and Thig = 5 × Tmin, respectively. Tlow and
Thig are shown in Fig. 15 together with the experimental dis-
tribution of reduced neutron widths and one random simulated
sequence. In reality, gJ 
0 is shown on the vertical axis as
the expectation value of this quantity is independent of the
resonance spin (of p-wave resonances), and the SAMMY fit
produces rather this quantity than 
0.

The predicted number of observable resonances for several
different neutron energy ranges and three different values of
the threshold are listed in Table VI for a few assumed values of

levels correspond to the standard deviation obtained from the
analysis of the individual simulated resonance sequences. The
ranges of D0 values compatible with the experimental data
within one standard deviation are presented at the bottom of
the table.

A value of D0 = 15.8(8) eV, consistent with the observed
number of levels for all the energy intervals and thresholds
within ∼1σ , is the proposed average spacing of s-wave
resonances from our analysis. This value shows that the
D0 extracted directly from the number of observed levels
below 1.1 keV (see the line in Fig. 14) is indeed biased by
several observed p-wave resonances. The proposed value is
significantly larger than the value in ENDF/B-VII.1 (13.6 eV)
and RIPL [13.50(15) eV] and consistent with the value in
JEFF-3.2 (15.3 eV) and the one proposed by Rich et al.
[16.8(5) eV].

The consistency of experimental data—for cumulative
number of observed resonances as a function of the neutron
energy and the distribution of reduced neutron widths—with
a few simulated sequences is shown in Fig. 16; the lowest
threshold (labeled as Tlow in Fig. 15) was used in this case.

According to our statistical analysis the total number of
s-wave resonances below 4 keV is estimated to be 254(8).
Assuming the lowest tested threshold, one can expect that
about 46(4) s-wave resonances should be missing in our
measurement while about 45(6) p-wave resonances should
be observed. Focusing on the energy interval below 1.1 keV,
where the simple plot (Fig. 14) indicates no missing levels,
our simulations indicate that 21(4) p waves are to be observed
and 5(2) s waves to be missed, leading to a too low predicted
spacing.

Possible p-wave resonances, indicated in Table VIII, were
identified according to statistical model simulations of the dis-
tribution of reduced neutron widths for the p-wave component.
The distribution of gJ 
0 was calculated using S1 = 2.07 ×

given in eV. According to the Porter-Thomas distribution there
is only just 1% (0.35%) chance that one p-wave resonance has
a gJ 
0 value larger than 6.64 (8.53) times the average.

The 0.35% p-wave limit, shown in Fig. 15, was used for
labeling the resonance as possible p wave in Table VIII. This
threshold was found to miss a negligible number of observable
p-wave resonances while keeping small the number of s-wave
resonances tagged as p-wave candidates. According to our
analysis, the p-wave contribution is mainly observable below
2 keV, where we found 37 p-wave candidates out of a total
of 43 in the full energy range. This result is consistent with
the 31(5) and 9(3) candidate resonances with p-wave and s-
wave origin, respectively, predicted by the simulations below
2 keV. Among the p-wave candidates we find the ten observed
resonances below 500 eV considered as p-wave in ENDF/B-
VII.1 (considered s-wave in JEFF-3.2).

The average resonance parameters extracted from the analy-
sis of the resonance region of the radiative capture cross section

VI. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

The neutron capture cross section of 242Pu has been
measured by means of the time-of-flight technique at the
CERN n_TOF-EAR1 facility employing an array of four C6D6
scintillators as a detection system. The target consisted of seven
thin layers of 242Pu enriched to 99.959%, each of 45 mm in
diameter, with a total mass of 95(4) mg electrodeposited on
thin aluminum backings. The capture data cover the neutron
energy interval from thermal to few hundreds of keV.

This paper deals with the analysis of the data below a neu-
tron energy of 4 keV. A detailed description of the analysis and
quality assurance methods leading to a capture cross section
with a systematic uncertainty of 5% is given. This uncertainty
meets the requirements of the NEA-HPRL. The good energy
resolution of the facility and the accumulated statistics have
allowed us to observe individual resonances and determine
their parameters up to 4 keV, while resonance parameters from
capture measurements were previously reported only below 1.3
keV. The individual resonance parameters of 251 resonance
have been extracted, 180 of which had never been reported
before in any neutron radiative capture measurement. The
data presented in this work indicate a ∼4% higher capture
cross section compared to JEFF-3.2 in terms of weighted
average of resonance kernels ratio (∼6% higher compared to

the new measurement at DANCE). In particular, for the 2.67 eV
resonance the obtained radiative kernel is 4.2% larger than in
the evaluations, while DANCE reports a resonance integral
2.4% larger than ENDF/B-VII.1.

The large set of analyzed resonances has led to a value
of S0 more accurate than those of previous experiment and
compatible with the values in the literature. A higher value of
〈
γ 〉, compatible just with JEFF-3.2 and RIPL was extracted
from our analysis. Statistical simulations indicate that the
low threshold for observation allows the strongest p-wave
resonances to be observed, especially below 2 keV, while some
of s-wave resonances remain unobservable. The analysis of the
observed number of resonances using such simulations leads
to a value of D0 consistent with JEFF-3.2 and with the value
proposed by Rich et al. but significantly larger than the value
in ENDF/B-VII.1 and RIPL.

In summary, the new high-resolution capture data allow
us to meet the requirements of the NEA-HPRL in terms of
reduction of the current uncertainty in the capture cross section
of 242Pu and shall lead to a revised evaluation with an improved
accuracy of 5% in the resolved resonance region up to 4 keV
and a larger set of resonance parameters.

The obtained capture yield extends up to at least 200 keV,
covering a large fraction of the unresolved resonance region.
The analysis of this higher-energy region is ongoing and is a
subject for future research.
