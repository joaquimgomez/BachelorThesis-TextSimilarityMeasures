Abstract. The neutron capture cross section of several key unstable isotopes acting as branching points in
the s-process are crucial for stellar nucleosynthesis studies, but they are very challenging to measure due
to the difficult production of sufficient sample material, the high activity of the resulting samples, and the
actual (n,γ ) measurement, for which high neutron fluxes and effective background rejection capabilities are
required. As part of a new program to measure some of these important branching points, radioactive targets
of 147Pm and 171Tm have been produced by irradiation of stable isotopes at the ILL high flux reactor. Neutron
capture on 146Nd and 170Er at the reactor was followed by beta decay and the resulting matrix was purified via
radiochemical separation at PSI. The radioactive targets have been used for time-of-flight measurements at the
CERN n TOF facility using the 19 and 185 m beam lines during 2014 and 2015. The capture cascades were
detected using a set of four C6D6 scintillators, allowing to observe the associated neutron capture resonances.
The results presented in this work are the first ever determination of the resonance capture cross section of
147Pm and 171Tm. Activation experiments on the same 147Pm and 171Tm targets with a high-intensity 30 keV
quasi-Maxwellian flux of neutrons will be performed using the SARAF accelerator and the Liquid-Lithium
Target (LiLiT) in order to extract the corresponding Maxwellian Average Cross Section (MACS). The status
of these experiments and preliminary results will be presented and discussed as well.

1. Introduction
The s- and r-processes are the responsible for the formation
in the stars of practically all the chemical elements heavier
than iron. The phenomenological picture of the classical s
process was formulated about 50 years ago in the seminal
papers of Burbidge et al. [1] and of Cameron [2] in 1957,
where the entire s-process panorama was already sketched
in its essential parts. They explain how, in this process, the
elements heavier than iron are produced by a continuous
chain of neutron capture reactions and beta-decays that
give rise to the heavy elements. The phenomenology of
the s-process implies that the solar abundance distribution
is composed of two parts, a main component, which is
responsible for the mass region from Y to Bi, and a weak
component, which contributes to the region from Fe to Sr.
The main and weak components can be assigned to low
mass stars (between 1 and 3 solar masses) and to massive
stars (more than 8 solar masses), respectively. Accordingly,
the Galactic enrichment with s-process material starts
with the lighter s elements, because massive stars evolve
much quicker. For a recent and comprehensive review see
Ref. [3].

A quantitative description of the abundances arising
from the s-process requires both, the neutron capture
rates and the b-decay probabilities of all the isotopes
involved. Along the s-process path, unstable nuclei with
relatively long (y) and with very long (Gy) half-lives,
known as branching point isotopes, become of utmost
interest: their destruction via either beta decay or neutron
capture depends on the conditions of the environment
(density, temperature). Hence the importance of knowing
the corresponding capture cross sections. Despite of their
pivotal role, as of today, only the capture cross section of

2 out of a list of 21 important s-process branching points
isotopes (see [3]) have been measured by neutron time-of-
flight.

In this work, we add three more items to the list of
measured isotopes. We have produced sizable quantities of
147Pm, 171Tm and 204Tl inside the ILL high flux reactor,
purified the material, made suitable targets out it [4],
and measured the corresponding capture cross section by
time-of-flight at the CERN n TOF facility [5,6] and by
activation at LiLiT [7]. Since the data analysis is ongoing,
this paper does not include final results but a description
of the experiments and an outlook of the analysis and
expected results.

2. Experiments
2.1. Production of the radioactive targets

The isotopes 147Pm, 171Tm and 204Tl have been produced
by neutron irradiation at the high flux reactor at Institute
Laue-Langevin (ILL), Grenoble of 98.2 mg of 146Nd2O3
enriched to 98.8%, 238 mg of 170Er2O3 enriched to 98.1%,
and 263 mg of 203Tl2O3 enriched to 99.5%. The powder
of each isotope was pressed into pellets, each of which
was then encapsulated into a high purity quartz ampule
sealed by a flame torch. These ampules were irradiated
at ILL for a period of 55 days with an average neutron
flux of 8.2 × 1014 n/cm2/s and, after a cooling period of
approximately 1.5 years, the samples were shipped to PSI
where they underwent chemical processing.

While the 204Tl target was left inside the quartz ampule
for the subsequent measurements due to its prohibitive
dose rate, the irradiated Nd (150 GBq) and Er (3 GBq)
pellets were chemically purified prior to making suitable
targets. The material was electroplated onto 5 µm thick
aluminum backings resulting in two high quality targets of
22 mm diameter with a total of 3.8 mg of 171Tm and 85 µg
of 147Pm. A picture of one of the targets is shown in Fig. 1.

2.2. Time-of-flight experiments at n TOF

The CERN time-of-.flight facility features two neutron
beam lines: a shorter one with increased neutron flux
at only 19 m [5] and a longer one with better energy
resolution at 185 m [6]. Both beam lines look at the
neutrons produced by spallation induced by a pulsed
20 GeV/c proton beam impinging on a cylindrical lead
block every (at best) 1.2 seconds.

After traveling through the chosen beam line, a fraction
of the neutrons incident on the target under study (147Pm,
171Tm and 204Tl in this case) undergoes neutron capture
reactions, and the subsequent γ -rays are detected by an
array of four C6D6 liquid scintillators [8]. These are
detectors with very low neutron sensitivity that allow one
eliminating the background due to neutrons scattered in the
target. After the corresponding background subtraction,
the measured distributions of capture counts as a function
of time-of-flight, i.e., neutron energy, are transformed into
the capture yield applying the so-called Pulse Height
Weighting Technique (PHWT) [9] and using the saturated
resonance of 197Au for an absolute normalization [10].

2.3. Activation experiments at LiLiT

The Liquid Lithium Target (LiLiT) [7] installed at
the SARAF facility (Israel) represents the most intense
quasi-Maxwellian neutron beam worldwide. The SARAF
accelerator provides a proton beam of 1–2 mA with an
energy of ∼1.93 MeV (just above the threshold of the
7Li(p,n) reaction) that is driven into a thin (1.5 mm)
liquid lithium layer, hence providing the quasi-Maxwellian
neutron energy distribution (see [11] for details). At
LiLiT, Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections (MACS)
are measured via the activation technique. The targets
are exposed to the neutron beam and the number of
capture reactions is determined from the number of A+1Z
nuclei produced. Assuming that the A+1Z isotope is
radioactive, the number of unstable nuclei is quantified
using a Ge detector looking at the associated emission
of γ -rays. In this case, the MACS of 197Au serves as a
reference.

3. Preliminary and expected results
The time-of-flight measurements of both 171Tm and 204Tl
were carried out at the n TOF long neutron beam line,
EAR1. In both cases, despite of the severe background
conditions arising for the high activity of the targets, we
have obtained a nice data set that allows resolving capture
resonances for the first time.

In the case of 171Tm the preliminary capture yield is
displayed in Fig. 2, showing resonances up to 700 eV and
illustrating the good resolution of n TOF-EAR1. This data
set will provide a complete set of resonance parameters
and the unresolved resonance region will be derived from
these with the help of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical
model. In the case of 204Tl the observed resonance are
actually in the keV region of interest in astrophysics. In
the case of 147Pm, the mass of the target is so small
(85 µg) that it is at the detection limit of the n TOF short
beam line, EAR2. In this case only a few resonances
have been observed and therefore the data will not allow
extracting a cross section value in the keV energy region of
interest.

In the case of the activation measurements, both
147Pm(n,γ ) and 171Tm(n,γ ) have been successfully
measured at LiLiT. Indeed, due to the high neutron beam
intensity at LiLiT we have significantly increased the

statistics achieved in the previous experiment and will
therefore be able to use more γ -ray lines, improving the
accuracy and increasing the reliability of our results. The
results will be the measured MACS at 30 keV with an
expected accuracy of 10%.
