The radiative capture cross section of a highly pure (99.999%), 6.125(2) grams and 9.56(5)×10−4 atoms/barn
areal density 238U sample has been measured with the Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) in the 185 m flight
path at the CERN neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF. This measurement is in response to the NEA High
Priority Request list, which demands an accuracy in this cross section of less than 3% below 25 keV. These data
have undergone careful background subtraction, with special care being given to the background originating from
neutrons scattered by the 238U sample. Pileup and dead-time effects have been corrected for. The measured cross
section covers an energy range between 0.2 eV and 80 keV, with an accuracy that varies with neutron energy,
being better than 4% below 25 keV and reaching at most 6% at higher energies.

I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

Nuclear energy is an unavoidable component of future
energy production, as outlined in the EU SET plan [1]. In
order to improve the sustainability of this energy source,
new concepts for nuclear systems are being explored. In this
context, despite many previous measurements, challenges still
exist within the present level of basic nuclear data knowledge,
as is shown in the case of 238U. Recent efforts by the
Collaborative International Evaluated Library Organization
(CIELO) [2] have been made to evaluate the 238U(n,γ ) reaction
[2] in the epithermal energy region. Thus it is timely to
provide new data sets using modern, sophisticated detection
and analysis techniques and tools.

There is indeed a requirement from industry to reduce
the uncertainty in the 238U(n,γ ) cross section, as stated in
the WPEC-26 report [3], which forms the basis for an entry
in the OECD NEA High Priority Request List [4]. Here
is stated the need for a reduction in the uncertainty of the
238U(n,γ ) cross section in particular neutron energy regions
where the target uncertainty is lower than the current. Three
energy regions are distinguished: 22.6–454 eV (currently 2%,
required 1%), 2.03–9.12 keV (currently 3%, required 1%), and
9.12–24.8 keV (currently 9%, required 3%).

These energy regions essentially cover the resolved reso-
nance region (RRR), which is currently described by a set of
resonance parameters up to 20 keV. It has been demonstrated
that the uncertainty in keff calculations propagated by the
238U(n,γ ) cross section is sensitive to individual resonance
parameters [5] therefore there is a clear need for a reduction
in uncertainty.

The latest evaluation in 2005 of the nuclear data available on
238U(n,γ ) by Derrien et al. [6,7] aimed to address and quantify
the situation and these results have been mostly adopted by
the three main neutron cross-section libraries (ENDF/B, JEFF,
and JENDL). These libraries have an uncertainty in the capture
cross section of 2–3% in the energy region from 100 eV–5 keV,

however, Derrien et al. highlighted sizable differences (10%)
between the different high-accuracy data sets.

A new measurement performed with the Total Absorption
Calorimeter at the state of the art neutron time-of-flight facility
n_TOF is described in detail, with particular attention to the
experimental and analytical aspects. This paper focuses on
the energy region from 0.2 eV–80 keV, spanning the resolved
resonance region and part of the unresolved resonance region.

A single measurement is not sufficient to reach the desired
accuracies for this cross section therefore an international
combined effort has been made to acquire new data. The mea-
surement discussed herein is a result of the EC-FP7 ANDES
project [8] at the neutron time-of-flight facilities, n_TOF and
GELINA [9], where measurements were performed with C6D6
liquid scintillators, details of which can be found in references
[10,11]. By combining the new data sets, the next evaluation
should be able to reach the required accuracies for advanced
nuclear systems.

II. CURRENT DATA

The current high-quality capture data sets in the resonance
region are from Moxon [12], de Saussure et al. [13], and
Macklin et al. [14], which have all been previously analyzed
in parallel with transmission data [6]. The important details
from these three measurements are

(i) Moxon: Cross section measured with a Moxon Rae
detector [15] on a 32.57 m flight path at the Harwell
45 MeV electron linear accelerator using 99.965%
enriched 1.595 × 10−3 atoms/barn sample with nor-
malization to the then accepted resonance parameters
between 6 eV and 1 keV, the first three of which were
saturated resonances.

(ii) de Saussure et al.: Cross section measured with the
ORELA liquid scintillator tank (ORELAST) [16] on a
40 m flight path at ORELA [17] using two 99.99%
enriched samples of 2.83 × 10−3 and 3.96 × 10−4
atoms/barn thicknesses. Normalization was made to
the first (6.67 eV) resonance using the saturated
resonance technique [18].

(iii) Macklin et al.: Cross section measured with ORE-
LAST on a 150 m flight path at ORELA using two
99.99% enriched samples of thicknesses 3.09 × 10−3
and 1.236 × 10−2 atoms/barn with the normalization

MEASUREMENT OF THE 238U(n,γ ) CROSS . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 96, 064601 (2017)

calculated from eight isolated small resonances in the
region 600–1100 eV.

The status of the evaluated data files for 238U in the resonance
region is summarized in Ref. [19]. In summary, in order for
these data sets to be compatible with transmission data [20],
additional backgrounds and energy-dependent normalization
factors had to be implemented by the evaluators. Above
the 6.67 eV resonance, the data of de Saussure et al. were
renormalized by a factor of ∼0.9 and the data of Macklin
by a factor of ∼1.1. A further neutron energy-dependent
background subtraction of ∼10% was required for both data
sets. It is noted that these capture data sets included in the most
recent evaluations had to be renormalized by sizable factors
and that these factors are not even constant in energy. One
could conclude these capture experiments have suffered from
large (8–13%) uncertainties due to systematic effects. Indeed,
discrepancies within these data sets limit the accuracy of the
evaluated 238U(n,γ ) cross section.

Besides the recent GELINA and n_TOF measurements, a
new cross-section measurement in the energy range 10 eV–
500 keV has been reported using the DANCE calorimeter at
the LANSCE facility [21]. Finally, due to the large amount of
data sets available, the 238U(n,γ ) cross section was recently
evaluated by Carlson et al. [22].

III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP

A. n_TOF facility

The n_TOF facility is a pulsed neutron spallation source
driven by 20 GeV/c protons, supplied by the CERN Proton
Synchrotron, impinging on a cylindrical (40 cm length and
60 cm diameter) lead target. The ∼300 neutrons emitted by
each proton initially have a fast neutron energy spectrum,
which is moderated by a 4 cm layer of water and a further
1 cm of borated water in the horizontal plane, the former
also acting as a coolant to the target. Two beam lines are
used at n_TOF: one 185 m horizontal flight path leading to
experimental area one (EAR1) and one 20 m vertical flight
path leading to experimental area two (EAR2). The 185 m
flight path offers excellent neutron energy resolution and
therefore is well suited for a high-precision measurement of
the 238U resonance region. For neutron capture measurements
at n_TOF, two detection systems are habitually used, utilizing
the total energy and total absorption techniques. For the former,
low-efficiency liquid scintillators (C6D6) detectors are used in
combination with the pulse height weighting technique [23]
and for the latter a 4π array of BaF2 detectors is utilized.
This paper deals with the analysis and results from the total
absorption technique, where the goal is to analyze all the BaF2
modules in coincidence in order to unambiguously detect a
capture cascade. The neutron beam is monitored by the silicon
monitor (SiMon) [24] where α and triton particles from the
standard cross section 6Li(n,α)3H are detected. For a detailed
description of the n_TOF facility and EAR1 see Ref. [25].

B. TAC detector

The Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) [26] is a seg-
mented array of 40 BaF2 crystals designed to detect the

complete γ -ray cascade emitted during a neutron capture
reaction. Based on a previous BaF2 calorimeter at FZK [27],
the 95% solid angle coverage allows capture cascades to be
detected with an efficiency close to 100%. The 40 segments are
composed of 12 pentagonal and 28 hexagonal BaF2 crystals of
15 cm thickness, which fit together as a hollow sphere with an
inner radius of 20 cm. Each individual crystal is surrounded
by two layers of 0.1 mm thick Teflon foil and a 0.1 mm
thick polished aluminium sheet to optimize light collection.
Furthermore, the crystals are encased by a protective layer of
10B enriched carbon fiber, which has the purpose of absorbing
neutrons so they do not reach the crystals. The crystals are
all supported by an aluminium honeycomb structure, which
is split into two hemispheres that can be separated allowing
access to the center of the TAC.

In order to minimize the probability of detecting neutrons
scattered in the sample and subsequently being captured in
the TAC, the hollow space between the sample and the BaF2
crystals is filled with a borated polyethylene (enriched to 5%
of 10B) neutron absorber [28].

Each crystal’s signal is fed into a single channel of a high
performance digitizer (Acquiris-DC270) with 8-bit resolution,
8 MB memory, and 250 MHz sampling rate. This allows data to
be recorded for 32 ms, which corresponds to the time-of-flight
for 0.2 eV neutrons. The digitized waveforms are transferred
via gigabit ethernet to the Cern advanced storage manager
(CASTOR), where they are stored on both disk and tape for
offline analysis.

The TAC heavily suffers from the γ flash [25], a short burst
of relativistic particles traveling through the beam line and
arriving to the experimental setup before the fastest neutrons.
The time it takes to recover from the γ flash gives an upper limit
in neutron energy for measurements with the TAC of a few keV
with the nominal intensity n_TOF beam [7 × 1012 protons per
pulse (ppp)]. Since the aim was to reach several tens of keV
in this measurement, the proton beam was operated at lower
intensities: 1.0 and 0.5 × 1012 ppp (referred to as HIGH and
LOW respectively), which allowed neutron energies of 30 and
80 keV to be reached, respectively. An advantage of running
with different beam intensities is that it provides results with
different counting rates, which allows a check of both the
effect and validity of count rate variable data corrections; such
as pileup and dead-time.

C. Samples

The 238U target, provided by EC-JRC-Geel, weighs
6.125(2) grams [9.56(5)×10−4 atoms/barn] and has a purity
of 99.999%, with traces of 234U (<1 ppm), 235U (∼11 ppm)
and 236U (<1 ppm). The weight was confirmed at CERN upon
reception of the target. Its rectangular (53.90 × 30.30 mm2)
shape covers 97% of the n_TOF neutron beam. In order
to comply with radioprotection regulations, the sample was
encased in ∼60 μm of aluminium and ∼75 μm Kapton.
Targets with the same geometry made of gold [1.561(2)
g] and carbon [14.638(2) g] were measured under similar
conditions for validation and neutron scattering background
studies, respectively.

The dip at 30 keV neutron energy is due to neutrons interacting with aluminium in the beam line and the structures in the deposited energy
spectra correspond to neutron capture reactions with the sample plus surrounding materials.

IV. 238U CAPTURE YIELD

The observable quantity in a time-of-flight capture cross-
section measurement is the experimental yield [Y (En)], de-
fined as the number of reactions per incident neutron. To arrive
at this quantity, the initial data must first be reduced, before
backgrounds are subtracted and any further corrections are
made, as is detailed within this section.

A. Data reduction

The digitized BaF2 signals are processed with a dedicated
pulse shape analysis routine [29]. Each γ -ray signal has
a fast and slow scintillation component. The background
from the intrinsic α decay of the radium impurities in the
crystals is eliminated from the final data analysis as the
signals originating from α particles lack a fast component,
however, was used for gain monitoring during the experimental
campaign. During the measurement, which lasted 35 days,
weekly calibrations were performed using standard γ -ray
sources of 137Cs (662 keV), 88Y (898 and 1836 keV), and
AmBe (4438 keV).

The target to sample neutron flight path L (185.61±0.02 m)
was determined by fitting 20 resonances in the 238U data
below 1 keV and calibrating to the accurately known resonance
energies in the JEFF 3.1.2 evaluation.

The 40 digitizer channels were synchronized in time using
a 88Y calibration source. The signals from all individual
detectors are then grouped into TAC events using a coincidence
window of 20 ns after the first signal. Each TAC event is
characterized by its time-of-flight (that of the first signal
in the event), the sum energy of all the signals involved
(deposited energy Esum), and the number of BaF2 crystals
involved in the event (multiplicity mcr). The reasonable energy
resolution, high segmentation, and high absorption efficiency
of the TAC allows identifying and rejecting background events
by applying analysis conditions in mcr and Esum, see Ref. [26]
for a detailed discussion. For this analysis, only events of
multiplicities greater than one and energies between 2.5 and

5.75 MeV were used, eliminating at low γ -ray energies various
backgrounds, particularly from 1H(n,γ ), and at high energies
counts above the neutron separation energy of 239U, which
is 4.8 MeV, but a margin must be given due to small pileup
events and detector resolution. As shown in Fig. 1, applying
this condition helps improve the capture to background
ratio by a factor of more than 15 in some resonances and
∼4 in the smooth keV region with a loss of ∼33% in
efficiency.

B. Background subtraction

Many γ rays are detected in the crystals of the TAC
originating from reactions other than neutron capture in
238U, all contributing to a measured background. The main
background components originate from a time-independent
room background (beam-off), a time-dependent background
from the neutron beam (sample-out), and background counts
originating from other neutron reactions with the sample
itself, predominantly neutron scattering. For this work, any
background originating from fission events and in-beam γ
rays scattered by the sample have not been considered and
assumed to be negligible for the chosen analysis conditions.

The background due to the combination of the neutron beam
and beam-off can be visualized through the counts as a function
of time-of-flight and/or neutron energy or the deposited energy
within the TAC (Fig. 1).

The time-independent background originates from natural
radioactive sources present in the n_TOF measuring station,
predominantly: 40K found in the concrete walls, 238U and its
decay chain, and radium impurities and their decay chains
within the BaF2 crystals. Beam-off measurements throughout
the experimental campaign totalling to around one day of
running time were used to quantify this background, which,
constant in time, follows the form a√

En
when expressed as

a function of neutron energy. In order to reduce statistical
fluctuations a fit of this form is performed to the experimental
data before the background is subtracted.

Carbon (scaled)

FIG. 2. Carbon and 238U deposited energy spectra, per histogram
bin, for mcr > 1 and with the sample-out and beam-off backgrounds
subtracted, where the carbon spectrum has been scaled above 7 MeV
to match the number of 238U counts to allow an estimation of the
scattering contribution to the 238U data.

The background originating from the neutron beam has
two components: first, unrelated to the sample, determined
with sample-out measurements, and second, counts caused
by sample-scattered neutrons being captured elsewhere.
The number of detected counts from scattered neutrons is
heavily dependent on the 238U(n,n) cross section, which has
similar resonant structure as the 238U(n,γ ) cross section. This
background is determined experimentally making use of the
difference between the neutron separation energies of 239U
(4.8 MeV) and the barium isotopes present in the crystals
(between 4.7 and 9.1 MeV). When neutrons are captured in
the TAC crystals, γ -ray cascades can be emitted with a higher
total energy than possible from a 238U capture reaction, thus
we assume that TAC events above a certain energy (7 MeV)
originate from scattered neutrons. To then deduce the number
of counts that will have been detected within the deposited
energy cuts used in this work, [2.5 < Esum(MeV) < 5.75], the
known scattered counts are compared to the carbon deposited
energy spectrum, which is assumed to be a pure neutron
scatterer. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, by scaling the counts
>7 MeV in the carbon data as a function of neutron energy to
the 238U deposited energy spectra, the background is estimated
for the whole neutron energy region. A small percentage of the
γ rays detected with energies above 7 MeV will not be from
neutron capture on the barium isotopes but be due to pileup,
hence an uncertainty is associated with this technique. The
integral of the counts above 7 MeV from 238U and natC appear
not to be equal in Fig. 2 as the full range of energies used for
scaling (7–20 MeV) is not visible and the fractional pileup
contribution to the two spectra in this energy region is different.

The magnitude of the correction from carbon scaling can
be estimated analytically using the approximate efficiencies
of the TAC to detect capture cascades [εn,γ (mcr,Esum)] and
scattered neutrons [εn,n(mcr,Esum)]. The former is measured
with the saturated resonance technique and the latter is
calculated by comparing the measured carbon yield with
the theoretical carbon yield as given by SAMMY using the
JEFF 3.1.2 carbon cross section. Knowing these and taking

the capture and scattering resonance parameters from JEFF
3.1.2 (�γ and �n) we can estimate the neutron scattering
contribution on a resonance-by-resonance basis. For example,
following this method, the 36 eV resonance is expected to
have a contribution from scattered neutrons of 0.8%, which is
in perfect agreement with what is measured with the method
of scaling to the carbon data. However, for higher-energy
resonances, the analytical method breaks down as the time
it takes a scattered neutron to be captured within the TAC is
of the order a few hundred ns, which moves the subsequent
capture time-of-flight outside the resonance.

The magnitude of the correction over the full neutron energy
range is shown in Fig. 3. It is observed that as neutron energy
increases, the contribution also increases as expected. This is
mainly due to the ratio of capture to scattering cross sections for
238U decreasing. Below 10 keV neutron energy, the correction
is at most ∼12%, rising to a maximum of 45% at 80 keV.
Therefore it follows that if a 10% uncertainty is assigned to
the subtraction method, no more than a 5% uncertainty is
propagated to the final data.

C. Pileup and dead-time correction

The combination of the large sample, the high efficiency of
the TAC and the intense pulsed neutron source at n TOF-EAR1
(∼106 neutrons per pulse) resulted in count rates as high as
1 count/μs in the peak of some resonances. The slow decay
component of BaF2 is ∼630 ns, therefore pileup and dead
time occur at these high count rates. The measured Esum and
mcr of events are altered by these effects at high count rates
pushing them outside or inside the chosen analysis conditions,
thus introducing a complicated dependency of the detection
efficiency on the count rate. To correct for this, a method has
been developed for capture measurements with the TAC at the
n_TOF facility [30].

To apply this method, TAC data has been analyzed to
quantify the dead-time and pileup effect for two consecutive
γ rays with energies E1 and E2 and at times t1 and t2. The
value of the dead time varies with E1 and E2 between 0 and
3 μs and for this work, if t2 − t1 < 250 ns, pileup is assumed
to occur and the two γ rays are assumed to be detected as one
with an energy E1 + E2.

FIG. 4. The highest count rate in the data is found in the resonance
at 66 eV. The asymmetrical resonance shape in the 1.0 × 1012 ppp
(HIGH) data is removed after correcting for pileup and dead-time.

Data free from pileup and dead-time effects for the capture
cascades in a region of low count rate is required as an input
for this method; in this case, the tails of the 6.7 eV resonance
are used. These realistic TAC cascades, each composed by a
number of signals with measured energy and crystal number
are randomly sampled and redistributed in time according to
the measured count rate. Using the identified values of dead
time and probability of pileup, the number of γ rays that would
be missed in the analysis can be estimated, thus providing a
more accurate true count rate. Through an iterative process,
the effects of dead time and pileup have been determined and
the true count rate accurately calculated.

The relatively high dead time of up to 3 μs is comparable to
the width in time-of-flight of resonances in the eV region for
238U, therefore not only will a loss of counts occur with high
count rates but also the shape of the resonance can be distorted,
as illustrated in Fig. 4. The expected symmetrical shape that is
predicted by SAMMY is restored after the correction is applied.
The pileup and dead-time correction is negligible across most
of the data except in the stronger resonances below 1 keV. In
these resonances, the correction is at most 15%.

where C(En) and B(En) are the total and background counts,
respectively, ε is the efficiency for detecting capture cascades,
F is the fraction of the beam intercepted by the 238U target
and φn(En) is the number of beam neutrons used in the
measurement. The shape of the n_TOF neutron flux is known
with an accuracy between 1% and 5% depending on the
energy region, as specified in Table I. The product ε· F can be
understood as a global normalization factor. In this particular
experiment, the thickness of the 238U target was chosen in such
a way that the first three resonances are saturated, meaning that,
at these resonance energies, almost all the neutrons incident
on the target undergo at least one interaction, most more than
one. This allows the saturated resonance method to be used to
obtain an absolute normalization of the resulting capture yield.
This is given by the corresponding comparison between the
expected and measured yield at the saturated 6.7 eV resonance,
where the expected resonance shape has been calculated by
the SAMMY code [31] using the resonance parameters from the
JEFF 3.1.2 library [32].

Figure 5 demonstrates the experimental yield scaled to
the yield given by SAMMY for the first saturated resonance
resulting in a scaling factor 1

ε·F of 0.670 ± 0.007. The yield
is scaled in the resonance peak only, where good agreement
is found between the predicted yield by SAMMY and the

FIG. 6. The 238U experimental yield after initial background
subtraction compared to the calculated yield from SAMMY using
resonance parameters from JEFF 3.1.2. A small background still
remains within the data, which can be quantified by finding the
required normalization to match the data to what is expected as a
function of neutron energy.

experimental data. The accuracy of this technique for normal-
ization is validated by the good agreement found in the second
and third resonances, both of which are also saturated but not
used for determining the normalization due to the larger mul-
tiple scattering corrections associated with these resonances,
which incur an uncertainty into the resonance shape.

E. Residual background

After performing these background subtractions and finding
the experimental yield, a residual background is observed
similar to that seen in previous time-of-flight measurements,
for example [33]. Figure 6 clearly shows the experimental
yield still contains some background counts on a level only
appreciable in the valleys between resonances, therefore any
background contribution to the resonances themselves is
negligible. This background can be determined as a function
of neutron energy by comparing the measured and expected
yields at the resonance valleys.

This procedure has been performed at 41 points at various

with a=3.660x10−4, b=−1.809, c=5.203x10−4, d =4.081,
and f = 1.909. A capture yield should by definition be free
from any backgrounds therefore these data have been provided
in EXFOR [34,35] with and without this background subtracted.
The method for quantifying this background is fully dependent
on the set of resonance parameters chosen to produce the
predicted yield from SAMMY, therefore it must be noted that
where this background has a significant contribution to the
measured counts, these data should be used with caution due to
the dependence of the final yield on the resonance parameters
chosen to calculate this background.

Figure 8 summarizes the individual and total background
contributions to the data. Below 1 keV where there are strong
and easily resolved resonances the data is dominated by counts
from 238U capture reactions, however, the residual background
is on a level comparable to some resonance tails, therefore it
can affect the resonance shapes. Thus, these data should be
used with caution for resonance analysis below 1 keV due
to the reliance on the evaluated cross section to determine
this background. Compared to true 238U capture counts, above
1 keV, the total background is ∼40%, rising to ∼50% between
40 and 60 keV and finally ∼70% between 60 and 80 keV.

F. Discussion on uncertainties

The sources of uncertainty during the calculation of the ex-
perimental capture yield are related to the various backgrounds
present (beam-off, beam-on, neutron scattering, and residual),
the dead-time and pileup correction, the sample mass, and the
neutron flux. The magnitude of these uncertainties varies as a
function of neutron energy and is given in Table I. The back-
ground from scattered neutrons was subtracted by scaling the
deposited energy data >7 MeV to the carbon spectra ignoring
any pileup effects, which will change as a function of neutron
energy. Due to this and also poor statistics in the deposited
energy spectra in the >7 MeV region, a 10% uncertainty
has been estimated for this background subtraction. Since the
magnitude of the residual background can be well estimated
and fitted, the uncertainty for this correction has also been
estimated to be 10%. It is noted that the main contributors to
the overall uncertainties are the neutron flux, particularly in
the region 25–50 keV (due to aluminium in the beam line)
and the correction for scattered neutrons. These total final
uncertainties are comparable to the complementary n_TOF
C6D6 measurement, which has a final uncertainty of between
2% and 6% in the same neutron energy ranges. The data from
GELINA are reported with a lower uncertainty of 1.5%.

10−4. In this region, the cross section is represented by a set of
resonance parameters. In this case, to find these the R-matrix
code SAMMY was used, leaving both the capture (�γ ) and
neutron scattering (�n) widths to vary as free parameters. The
background component was also left to vary in line with the
background associated uncertainties.

Figure 9 shows examples of the data and SAMMY fits from
4.5 keV–5 keV, which correspond to the upper limit in neutron
energy it was possible to perform a resonance analysis for in
this work due to statistical and background constraints.

Due to the high correlation between the resonance pa-
rameters obtained from a single data set it does not make
sense to directly compare these values with others, therefore
the comparison with evaluations is made using the resonance

strength. This is calculated as the radiative kernel:

Kγ = gj ·

with the spin factor gj defined as:

gj =

(2i + 1)(2I + 1) , (3)

where i, I , and J are spins of the incident particle, tar-
get nucleus (238U: I = 0+), and compound nucleus (239U)
respectively. Figure 10 shows the distribution of ratios for
the radiative kernels obtained in this work compared to those
from the JEFF 3.1.2 evaluation (equal to ENDF/B-VII.1 and
JENDL-4.0 above 1 keV and almost identical below) and the

recent data of Mingrone et al. and Kim et al. On average, the
data from this work is in good agreement with other data but
in general the capture resonance kernel is slightly higher (1.3,
2.0 and 0.9% higher for JEFF 3.1.2, Mingrone et al., and Kim
et al., respectively).

It is possible for uncertainties due to systematic effects
to be present in capture experiments from such things as
multiple scattering, pileup, and neutron scattering corrections.
By looking only to stronger or weaker resonances, these
corrections are larger or smaller, respectively. In the case of
the TAC, for the 174 resonances with a resonance kernel
<20 meV, excellent agreement is seen with the evaluated
libraries (the distribution of kernel ratios has a Gaussian fit
with a mean of 0.996 and σ = 0.035). However, for the 58
stronger resonances with a kernel >20 meV, TAC data are on
average 4% below the evaluated data (the resulting Gaussian
fit with a mean of 0.962 and σ = 0.053). This suggests that
there may be some systematic effect in the analysis of strong
resonances in either the TAC data or in the data considered in
the current evaluations.

Future evaluations such as CIELO can use data from a vari-
ety of sample thicknesses, neutron facilities, and experimental
techniques, thus a new evaluated resonance analysis will rule
out any systematic effects associated with stronger resonances.

and 5% (see [10] for more information). The measured average

=
2 × 10−2 binning is shown alongside the most recent mea-
surements and evaluations in Fig. 11. In general reasonable
agreement is found between all recent measurements and
evaluations. In order to evaluate small differences between
data sets, the cross-section ratios have been calculated and are
shown in Fig. 12.

In the energy range 5–9 keV (current uncertainty 3%),
the TAC data is in good agreement (1–2%) with the recent
GELINA and n_TOF C6D6 measurements, but 4% higher than
the evaluated libraries, 7% higher than the data from DANCE,
and 8% higher than the Carlson evaluation. Between 9 and
25 keV (current uncertainty 9%), the data is on average 2–3%
higher than the Carlson and library evaluations but in perfect
agreement with the GELINA data and 1.5–2.5% higher than
the DANCE and n_TOF C6D6 data sets, respectively. From
25–80 keV, the TAC data is on average in fair agreement with
the evaluated libraries (1.5–2.5% higher) and 4–7% higher
than the other measurements and the Carlson evaluation. The
plethora of recent, accurate measurements confirm that the
evaluations are correct within their rather large uncertainties
(up to 9%), however, it is apparent that many data sets agree
on a level of always better than 5% in the energy range up to
80 keV. A future cross-section evaluation through CIELO can
certainly get closer to, if not meet, the required accuracy of
3% in these energy regions.

work and other recent measurements and evaluations.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The 238U(n,γ ) cross section has been measured with the
Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) using the neutron time-
of-flight technique at the CERN n_TOF facility. The resulting
cross section covers the energy range between 0.2 eV and
80 keV with an accuracy ranging between 1.4% and 5.7%,
depending on the energy range. The results of this work are in
general slightly higher than current evaluations but in good
agreement with other recent measurements, therefore it is
expected that future evaluations will be modified to include
these data sets. It is timely for a reevaluation of the 238U(n,γ )
cross section in order to best meet the required uncertainties
for future reactors. In particular, in the neutron energy range
between 9 and 25 keV, the current uncertainty is 9% but our
data, along with the other measurements, show that the cross
section can be reevaluated and constrained within an accuracy
of at highest 5%, but most likely even better, reaching the
required 3%.
