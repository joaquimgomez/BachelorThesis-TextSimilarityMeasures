Abstract. Neutron capture cross sections are the key nuclear physics input to study the slow
neutron capture process, which is responsible for forming about half of the elemental abundances
above Fe. Stellar neutron capture cross section can be measured by the time-of-flight technique,
or by activation. Both techniques will be discussed and recent experiments in the Fe/Ni mass
region will be presented.

1. Introduction
Neutron capture reactions are the main mechanisms for synthesizing elements heavier than Fe
in stars. Two different processes contribute about equally to the overall elemental abundance
pattern, the slow neutron capture process (s process) and the rapid neutron capture process
(r process). The r process is associated to explosive scenarios with high neutron densities and
nuclear reactions involve nuclei far from the stability valley. In the s process, heavy elements
are produced by subsequent neutron captures on seed nuclei (mainly Fe). Neutron capture
timescales are of the order of years, therefore, if an unstable element is produced, β-decays
towards the stability valley are faster than subsequent neutron captures. An exception are long
lived radionuclides, where β-decay and neutron capture may compete. Such nuclei are called
branching points and their study can provide important information such as temperatures and
neutron densities in s process environments. The s process can be further divided in two different
components, the main component taking place in thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch
stars, where mainly elements between Zr and Bi are formed, and the weak s process which takes
place in massive stars (M > 8M�), where mainly elements between Fe and Zr are produced [1].
The nucleosynthesis path for the s process from Fe to Se is illustrated in Figure 1.

The main nuclear physics quantities that are required to study the s process are neutron
capture cross sections and β-decay half lives. The effective stellar neutron capture cross section,
called Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section (MACS), is the energy dependent cross section

Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections need to be known over a wide range of kT values (8-
100 keV) since s process environments exhibit temperatures from 0.1-1 Gigakelvin.
This paper will present neutron capture measurements at the neutron time-of-flight facility
n TOF/CERN in the Fe/Ni mass region.

2. Measuring Neutron Capture Cross sections
There are two complementary techniques to measure stellar neutron cross sections, the time-of-
flight technique, and the activation technique.
The time-of-flight technique allows measurement of the energy dependence of the cross section,
since the neutron energy is determined via the time-of-flight of the neutron for each capture
event. A pulsed neutron beam is produced by reactions of a charged particle beam with
a neutron production target. This can be achieved, for example, by spallation reactions
(e.g. n TOF/CERN [2] and LANSCE/Los Alamos [3]), or by photon-induced reactions by
bremsstrahlung produced by an electron beam hitting a high Z target (e.g. GELINA/Geel
[4]), or by (p, n) reactions using low-energy accelerators (e.g. the Karlsruhe Van de Graaff [1]).
Capture reactions are measured by detecting the prompt γ radiation emitted after each capture
event. Background effects can be minimized by using isotopically enriched samples, and structure
materials with low neutron cross sections. The time-of-flight technique allows measurements of
neutron cross sections over a wide energy range, enabling calculation of Maxwellian Averaged
Cross Sections for several values of kT from a single experiment.

The activation technique comprises of irradiating a sample with neutrons, and afterwards
counting the reaction product. This can be done by decay counting or by direct atom counting

techniques, e.g. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry [5]. The latter is especially suited if the reaction
product is long lived and/or the decay is not easily measurable by its radiation. To measure
stellar cross sections via activation, a neutron spectrum resembling the stellar distribution is
needed. A quasi-stellar spectrum around kT = 25 keV can be generated using the 7Li(p, n)
reaction with a proton beam of about 2 MeV energy [6, 7, 8]. This possibility was developed by
Beer and Käppeler [9] at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe and extensively used for measuring
stellar (n, γ) cross sections over the entire periodic table (e.g. [6, 10]). Quasi-stellar spectra
have been obtained for kT = 5 keV [11] using the 18O(p, n) reaction and for kT = 52 keV
[12] using the 3H(p, n) reaction, but both reactions yield significantly reduced intensities. To
convert the measured spectrum averaged cross section to a MACS, some assumptions on the
energy dependence of the cross section have to be made, but the respective conversion factors
are usually close to 1. Besides the limitation that the activation technique can only be applied
to reactions producing radioactive nuclei, there are also several advantages compared to the
time-of-flight technique. Sample material can be used in natural composition since the reaction
is detected either via characteristic γ-ray emission or by directly counting the reaction product.
Additionally, small amounts of sample material are sufficient (of the order of mg vs. hundreds
of mg to g for the time-of-flight method), since the neutron beam is continuous and the sample
can be put close to the neutron source.

3. (n, γ) Measurements at the n TOF Facility and Astrophysical Implications
In recent years, several neutron capture measurements of interest for the s process have been
performed at the neutron-time-of-flight facility n TOF, CERN. This section will concentrate
on measurements in the Fe/Ni mass region. As mentioned in the introduction, masses from
Fe to Zr are produced by the weak s process component. It was found that especially in this
mass region, neutron capture cross sections of all involved isotopes have to be known with high
accuracy because a single cross section can significantly influence the abundances of a number
of heavier isotopes [13]. This need has further been underlined by a discrepancy that was found
between elemental abundances in ultra-metal-poor stars and calculated abundances in the Sr-Y
mass region [14, 15], which led to the suggestion of an additional nucleosynthesis process [16].
Since neutron capture cross sections are a crucial input for these calculated abundances, cross
sections should be known with high accuracy for a better study of this discrepancy.
A campaign was started at n TOF to measure cross sections of all stable isotopes of Fe and Ni.
Measurements of (n, γ) reactions on 54,56,57Fe [17] and 58,62Ni [18, 19] have been completed.
At n TOF, an intense neutron beam is produced by spallation reactions of a 20 GeV proton
bunch of 7 ns width from the CERN-PS with a massive lead target. Around the target is a
water layer for cooling and for moderating the initially very energetic neutrons. The resulting
neutron spectrum at n TOF ranges from thermal neutron energies (0.025 eV) to few GeV. The
experimental area is located at a distance of 185 m from the neutron target, which ensures a high
energy resolution of 3×10−4 at 1 eV to 5×10−3 at 1 MeV neutron energy [2]. Prompt capture γ
rays were detected using a pair of scintillation detectors, filled with deuterated benzene (C6D6),
which were optimized to a very low sensitivity towards reactions with neutrons [20].
For the 62Ni(n, γ) reaction, we obtain a MACS at kT = 25 keV which is in good agreement
with a time-of-flight measurement by Alpizar-Vicente et al. [21] and activation measurements of
Nassar et al. [13] and Dillmann et al. [22]. For kT > 40 keV, however, our stellar cross sections
are systematically smaller than the results of Alpizar-Vicente et al. [21]. The final MACSs has
total uncertainties of about 5% at kT = 30 keV and 10% at kT = 100 keV.
Additionally to the stable Ni isotopes, the neutron capture cross section of the long lived
radionuclide 63Ni, with a half life of 101.2 ± 1.5 years [23] has been measured for the first
time [24]. The neutron capture yield measured at n TOF compared to backgrounds due to
presence of 62Ni in the sample and due to reactions of neutrons with the empty sample holder

is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Capture yield of the 63Ni(n, γ) reaction measured at n TOF. The yield is compared
to backgrounds coming from reactions on 62Ni, which was present in the sample, and reactions
of neutrons with the sample container [24].

63Ni is a branching point in the s process. The weak s process takes place in two different
burning stages in massive stars. First, neutrons are produced at the end of helium core burning
via the 22Ne(α, n) reaction. The neutron densities around 106 cm−3 are not sufficient for neutron
capture to compete with the decay of 63Ni, which means that the reaction flow is carried only
by the decay channel. In the later carbon shell burning phase, the 22Ne(α, n) neutron source is
reactivated, leading to several magnitudes larger neutron densities. In this scenario, 63Ni acts
like a stable isotope and is mainly depleted via subsequent neutron capture towards 64Ni, by-
passing completely the production of 63Cu, which is only produced by β-decay of the 63Ni that
is left after the neutron irradiation [25]. We determined stellar cross sections, which were about
a factor of 2 higher than previous theoretical estimates listed in the KADoNiS compilation [26].
With the new cross section, we calculated s process abundances of a 25 M� star and obtained
an increase of 20% in the 64Ni abundance and a 15 and 30% decrease of the 63Cu and 64Zn
abundances, respectively [24].

4. Outlook
Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections are an important quantity to study the s process. Most
challenging are (n, γ) measurements on radioactive species, since usually only small amounts
of sample material are available, as well as measurements of very small (n, γ) cross sections
(typically cross sections of light nuclei which may act as neutron poison in the s process). Some of
those reactions require higher neutron fluxes than presently available. Several new facilities and
upgrades are currently under construction or have been recently completed which are designed to
obtain neutron fluxes 10-1000 times higher than existing facilities, e.g. the FRANZ [27] facility
at the University of Frankfurt (Germany), SARAF [28] at the Soreq research centre (Israel),
and a second experimental area at a shorter flight path at n TOF [29]. These new facilities

will enable a number of new cross section measurements, e.g. 85Kr(n, γ) or 204Tl(n, γ), and will
provide crucial information for understanding the formation of the heavy elements.
