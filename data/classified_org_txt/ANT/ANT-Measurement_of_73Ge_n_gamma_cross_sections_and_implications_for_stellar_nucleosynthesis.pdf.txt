Abstract

73Ge(n, γ) cross sections were measured at the neutron time-of-flight facility
n TOF at CERN up to neutron energies of 300 keV, providing for the first
time experimental data above 8 keV. Results indicate that the stellar cross
section at kT = 30 keV is 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than most theoretical
predictions. The new cross sections result in a substantial decrease of 73Ge
produced in stars, which would explain the low isotopic abundance of 73Ge
in the solar system.

Keywords: nucleosynthesis, neutron capture, s process, germanium,
n TOF

1. Introduction

About half of the chemical element abundances heavier than iron in our
solar system are produced by the slow neutron capture process (s process)
in stars. The s process takes place at moderate neutron densities around 108

cm−3, where neutron captures and subsequent radioactive β decays build up
the isotopes along the line of stability. The s process in massive stars (so-
called weak component) is mainly responsible for forming elements between
Fe and Zr [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In this scenario, neutrons are produced by 22Ne(α, n)
reactions in two different burning stages, first during He core burning at tem-
peratures of 0.3 GK (GK=109 K), and later during carbon shell burning at 1
GK temperature. Solar germanium is thought to be mainly produced by the
weak s process (Pignatari et al. estimate 80% [6]), with the remaining contri-
butions coming from the s process in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (main
component), and explosive nucleosynthesis. Neutron capture cross sections
averaged over the stellar neutron energy distribution (Maxwellian Averaged
Cross Sections) are a key input to predict abundances produced in the s
process, and the isotopic abundance distribution of Ge is highly sensitive
to neutron capture cross sections on germanium. The sensitivity study by
[7] found an especially large uncertainty for the 73Ge production in massive
stars, with 73Ge(n, γ) being the key rate responsible for the uncertainty.

Present experimental data on 73Ge+n reactions are scarce. In the astro-
physical energy range, capture and transmission data by Maletski et al. [8]
provide radiative widths Γγ for resonances up to 2 keV, and neutron widths
Γn up to 8 keV. However, this energy region contributes only to a small
extent to the relevant stellar cross sections at kT = 26 and kT = 90 keV
which is equivalent to 0.3 and 1 GK s-process temperatures in massive stars,
respectively. In addition Harvey and Hockaday [9] measured total cross sec-
tions on natural germanium for neutron energies up to 180 keV. These two
datasets currently form the experimental basis for evaluated cross section li-
braries such as ENDF/B-VIII [10]. In this letter, we report for the first time
73Ge(n, γ) cross sections up to 300 keV neutron energy. This measurement
is part of a wider campaign to measure (n, γ) cross sections on all stable
germanium isotopes at n TOF.

2. Measurement

The measurement was performed at the neutron time-of-flight facility
n TOF at CERN. At n TOF, an intense neutron beam is produced by spal-
lation reactions of a 20 GeV/c proton beam of the CERN Proton Synchrotron
(PS), impinging on a massive lead target. The initially highly energetic neu-
trons are moderated with borated water, resulting in a neutron spectrum
which ranges from 25 meV to several GeV of energy. Further details about
the n TOF facility can be found in Ref. [11]. The radiative capture measure-
ment was performed at Experimental Area 1 (EAR1) located at a distance
of 185 m from the spallation target. The long distance from the spallation
target combined with the 7 ns width of the PS proton beam results in a
high neutron energy resolution ranging from ΔEn/En = 3 × 10−4 at 1 eV,
to ΔEn/En = 3 × 10−3 at 100 keV [11]. The prompt γ rays emitted after
the capture event were detected using a set of liquid scintillation detectors
(C6D6). These detectors have a low sensitivity to neutrons and thus minimise
background produced by neutrons scattered from the sample. The capture
sample consisted of 2.69 g GeO2 which was 96.1% enriched in

73Ge 1. The
GeO2 material was originally obtained in powder form and was pressed into
a self supporting cylindrical pellet of 2 cm diameter and a thickness of 2.9

1Enriched material in metal form was not available from the supplier. The sum of all
chemical impurities in this sample was quoted as < 200 ppm by the supplier.

mm. In addition to the GeO2 pellet, we recorded neutron capture data with
a Au sample of the same diameter for normalisation of the data, an empty
sample holder for background measurements, and a metallic Ge sample of
natural isotopic composition. The latter was used to unambiguously identify
resonances due to other Ge isotopes and to confirm the stoichiometry of the
pellet.

3. Data Analysis and Results

The neutron time-of-flight spectra were converted to neutron energy by
determining the effective flight path using low energy resonances in Au, for
which the resonance energy has been determined with high precision at the
time-of-flight facility GELINA [12]. The neutron capture yield at neutron
energy En, defined here as the probability for a neutron to be captured in
the sample, can then be determined as:

Y (En) = fN(En)
C(En)− B(En)

Φ(En)�c
, (1)

where C(En) are the number of counts, B(En) are counts due to background,
and Φ(En) is the neutron flux spectrum. �c is the efficiency to detect a cap-
ture event and fN is a normalisation factor (see below).
The detection efficiency was taken into account using the Pulse Height Weight-
ing Technique (PHWT) [13, 14], which can be applied to low efficiency sys-
tems, where typically only one γ-ray per capture cascade is detected. If the
efficiency to detect a γ ray is proportional to the γ-ray energy (�γ ∝ Eγ), the
efficiency to detect a capture event is proportional to the excitation energy
of the compound nucleus, i.e. �c ∝

∑
�γ = Sn + Ecm. The �γ ∝ Eγ pro-

portionality can be achieved by applying pulse height dependent weights to
each recorded event. The weighting factors were determined by simulating
the detector response in GEANT4 [15], taking into account the geometry of
the setup and the capture samples used. The data further need to be cor-
rected for transitions without γ-ray emission (electron conversion) and the
missing contribution of γ-rays with energies below the detection threshold,
which was set in the analysis to 350 keV. These contributions were estimated
and corrected for by simulating capture cascades with the code DICEBOX
[16], which generates individual levels and their decay properties based on
existing experimental information below an excitation energy of 2.6 MeV,
and is based on level densities and photon strength functions above. The

5



systematic uncertainty of the PHWT is 2% [14], taking into account the ad-
ditional threshold corrections we assign 3% systematic uncertainty in total.
The background B(En) consists of three components: (i) Background un-
related to the neutron beam, for example due to natural radioactivity, is
determined in runs without neutron beam; (ii) Beam related background is
determined by a measurement without the Ge sample in the beam (empty
sample holder); (iii) Background related to the sample, for example due to
neutrons scattered off the sample which are captured somewhere else in the
experimental area after a time delay. Component (iii) can be estimated us-
ing neutron filters. These filters are made of material which show strong
neutron absorption resonances at certain energies. The thickness is chosen
such, that neutron transmission at these energies is negligible. Any counts
in the dips of these resonances therefore must be produced by background
reactions. Components (i) and (ii) were measured and subtracted from the
counting spectra. Component (iii) is most important at higher neutron en-
ergies, where individual resonances start to overlap due to the experimental
resolution and to the widening of the resonance widths, and consequently,
the signal to background ratio in the resonance decreases. This background
was estimated by subtracting an empty sample holder spectrum with an Al
filter from the 73Ge with Al filter measurement. The remaining counts in the
filter dips due to resonances in Al (35, 90, 120 and 140 keV) were considered
to be due to background. A smooth function was fitted to these filter dips
and subtracted from the 73Ge data. Due to the low statistics in the filter
dips the uncertainty in the background level is 20-30%, which translates into
an uncertainty in the capture yield of at most 1%.
The neutron flux was measured in a dedicated campaign using reactions with
well known cross sections and three different detection systems to minimise
systematic uncertainties. The flux measurement was performed with a set
of silicon detectors using 6Li(n, t) reactions (SiMon detector), a Micromegas
detector measuring 6Li(n, t) and 235U(n, f), and an ionisation chamber pro-
vided by Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt Braunschweig, measuring
235U(n, f). The data were then combined to produce a reliable flux over
the entire neutron energy range. The final evaluated neutron flux has a sys-
tematic uncertainty below 1% for neutron energies < 3 keV, and of 3.5%
between 3 keV and 1 MeV [17]. More details on the neutron flux evaluation
at n TOF can be found in Ref. [18]. The neutron fluence was monitored
throughout the measurement by recording the number of protons impinging
on the spallation target (provided by PS detectors). This was cross checked

6



using the SiMon detector which was operational throughout the run. In ad-
dition, the stability of the C6D6 detectors was monitored by integrating the
total number of counts in a strong 73Ge+n resonance at 103 eV for each run.
No deviations outside statistical fluctuations were found.
The normalisation factor fN accounts for the fact that the neutron beam is
larger than the capture sample, and corrects any inaccuracies in the solid
angle coverage of the detectors assumed in simulations. This normalisation
is determined using the saturated resonance technique on a 197Au+n reso-
nance at 4.9 eV neutron energy. For this resonance, the capture width is
much larger than the neutron width which means that almost 100% of neu-
trons interacting inside the sample are captured eventually. If the sample is
chosen sufficiently thick, it can be ensured that all neutrons traversing the
sample react and produce a γ-cascade, thus providing a direct measure of
the neutron flux. The neutron beam size and hence the normalisation factor
have a slight dependence on neutron energy. This energy dependence was
determined in simulations [11] and corrections to the yield were at most 1.5%
in the investigated neutron energy range. The uncertainty assigned to the
normalisation procedure is 1%.
The resulting capture yield was fitted with the code SAMMY [19], a multi-
level, multichannel R-matrix code using Bayes’ method. SAMMY takes into
account experimental effects such as Doppler and resolution broadening, self
shielding and multiple scattering of neutrons in the sample. SAMMY was
used to extract resonance capture kernels k up to 14 keV neutron energy:

k = g
ΓγΓn

Γγ + Γn
, (2)

where g denotes the statistical weighting factor ( 2J+1
(2I+1)(2s+1)

with J being

the resonance spin, I the target nucleus spin and s the neutron spin), Γγ
is the radiative width, and Γn is the neutron width. The list of resonance
energies and capture kernels up to 14 keV can be found in Appendix A. For
a few low energy resonances, fitting the natural germanium sample resulted
in a much better reproduction of the resonance shape, presumably due to its
lower thickness which results in smaller corrections for multiple scattering
and self shielding in large resonances. The resonances fitted with the natural
germanium samples are cleary marked in the list of resonances of Table A.3.
Examples of the SAMMY fits of the capture yield are shown in Figure 1.

Above approximately 14 keV neutron energy, the experimental resolution
became too low to resolve individual resonances. An averaged cross section

was determined from 14 keV to 300 keV neutron energy and self-shielding
and multiple scattering corrections were determined in Monte Carlo simula-
tions. These simulations followed the approach of tracing neutrons of a given
energy through the sample composed according to the specifications. The
trace ended either because the neutron got captured or left the sample. The

8



energy loss in each scattering step was considered, however purely isotropical
scattering in the center-of-mass frame was assumed. To determine the cor-
rection factors, we used neutron capture and scattering cross sections from
ENDF-VIII [10], but scaled the capture cross section to better match the ex-
perimentaly determined cross sections. Corrections to the capture yield were
always smaller than 6%. Calculations using scaled and unscaled capture
cross sections, different cross section evaluations, and changes in the sample
thickness and geometry indicate that the total systematic uncertainty of the
simulations is below 20%, which results in at most 1.2% uncertainty in the
capture yield.
The cross sections reconstructed from SAMMY fits in the resolved resonance
region below 14 keV, and the unresolved cross sections from 14 to 300 keV are
shown in Fig. 2. Combining these two components, we calculated Maxwellian
averaged cross sections (MACS) from kT = 5 to kT = 100 keV using

For neutron energies above 300 keV we used the evaluated ENDF-BV.III
cross section [10], scaled by a factor of 1.7 to reproduce the experimental
cross section at lower energies. The contribution of this energy range was
at most 6% (at kT = 100) and negligible for kT < 60 keV. Fig. 3 shows a
comparison of the experimental MACS from kT = 5− 100 keV, compared to
recent evaluations and theoretical predictions. Besides TALYS-1.9 [21] (us-
ing default parameters), and MOST-2005 [20] the MACSs are significantly
underestimated by all predictions over the entire range of kT values. MACSs
recommended by the Kadonis-0.3 database [28], which is used in most nu-
cleosynthesis calculations, are consistently a factor of about 1.5 lower over
the entire energy range. MACSs from kT = 5 to kT = 100 keV are listed
in Table 1. Table 2 summarises all contributions to the total uncertainty of
these stellar cross sections.
In a star, excited states in nuclei may be thermally populated which means
that the stellar reaction rate includes neutron capture on both, the ground
state and excited states [25]. The cross sections on excited states have been
estimated using TALYS-1.9 [21], renormalising average level spacings and
average radiative widths to the experimental values obtained in this work
(see Appendix A), and using the default optical model potential (OMP) [26].
In addition, we investigated the impact on calculated cross sections using a
different OMP, i.e. the JKM potential as described in Ref. [27]. Based on

this we estimate a factor 1.25 uncertainty for the theoretical neutron capture
cross sections on excited states. Consequently, the stellar MACS∗, taking
into account neutron capture on excited states, has uncertainties ranging
from 6% at kT = 5 keV, to 14% at kT = 100 keV. The MACS∗s are also
listed in Table 1.

oretical and semi-empirical estimates [28]. We have studied the impact of
the new stellar neutron capture rate on weak s process nucleosynthesis using
a 15 solar mass (M�) star with a metallicity of Z = 0.006 (solar metallicity
is Z = 0.014 [29]), representative for a site with large overproduction of ele-
mental germanium [30]. In addition we have tested the new rates on main s
process nucleosynthesis in a 2 M� AGB star (Z=0.006). These calculations
were performed using the multi-zone post processing code mppnp [31]. It
is estimated that the bulk of germanium in the solar system is produced
in massive stars, while a small contribution of about 10-20% comes from
the main s process in AGB stars [6]. The top panel in Figure 4 shows the
isotopic abundance pattern of germanium isotopes produced in a 15 solar
mass star prior to the supernova explosion. The germanium abundances are
normalised to 70Ge in each case2. The new 73Ge(n, γ) MACS causes a re-
duction of the 73Ge abundance by over 30%, thus now reproducing the solar
73Ge/70Ge ratio. 72Ge/70Ge and 74Ge/70Ge are reasonably close to the solar
value, considering uncertainties in the associated reaction rates and the fact
that other nucleosynthesis processes contribute to a small extent to overall
germanium abundances. 76Ge is significantly underproduced compared to
solar as this isotope is bypassed by the s process due to the short half life of
75Ge (terrestrial t1/2 = 83 min) and is thought to be produced by explosive

270Ge is mainly produced in the s process and is shielded from rapid neutron capture
nucleosynthesis by stable 70Zn.

nova explosion compared to solar system abundances (pink stars). Blue circles show the
standard case and are compared to results using the new 73Ge MACS (black squares).
The new 73Ge MACS results in a lower 73Ge/70Ge ratio, consistent with the solar system

nucleosynthesis processes (see e.g. [32]). The bottom panel shows the same
comparison for a 2M� AGB star. In this case, isotopic ratios are always
smaller than solar. Considering that the contribution of AGB stars to solar
germanium is only about 10-20%, we can expect that a combination of these
two sites would still result in a fair reproduction of the solar germanium
abundance pattern. To put firmer constraints on abundances produced in
the different stellar sites, high precision MACS data on 70,72,74,76Ge are re-
quired; currently, there are no neutron capture data on 72Ge above 4 keV,
while uncertainties for recommended MACSs on 74,76Ge at kT = 30 keV are
8-10% [33, 34]. We expect that new n TOF data on these isotopes will im-

13



prove the precision of these MACSs.

Appendix A. Resonance Data

Tables A.3 to A.7 list capture kernels k and associated fit uncertainties.
The resonance energies have a further systematic uncertainty of 0.06% due
to the uncertainty in the neutron flight path. The systematic uncertainty on
the capture kernels are 3.5% below and 4.8% above 3 keV neutron energy,
consisting of uncertainties due to Pulse Height Weighting (3%), normali-
sation (1%), sample enrichment (1%), and neutron flux (1% below, 3.5%
above 3 keV). Neutron capture data by themselves do not always allow a
reliable determination of neutron and radiative widths and resonance spins.
However, the results from SAMMY fits were consistent with 〈Γγ〉 ≈ 250
meV for all resonances with ER < 8 keV and Γn/Γγ >> 1; specifically, the
maximum-likelihood estimate assuming a Gaussian distribution of radiative
widths yielded 〈Γγ〉 = 250(10) meV and σΓγ = 30(5) meV. Statistical model
simulations using the dicebox code [16] indicated only a slightly narrower
distribution (15 − 20 meV). The present experimental value is somewhat
higher than literature values of 〈Γγ〉 = 195(45) meV [35] and 197(6) meV [36].

To deduce the statistical resonance properties we construct the so-called
bias function, that is the equiprobability for a single resonance at a given
neutron energy to be either s- or p-wave. The bias function, as shown in
Fig. A.5, is obtained using the present value of 〈Γγ〉 and varying values
of the resonance spacing D0, the s-wave neutron strength function S0 and
the p-wave neutron strength function S1. The channel radius was taken in
the form R = 1.35A1/3. The comparison of the number of resonances with k
above different multiples (1−5×) of the bias function yielded D0 = 70(8) eV,
S0 = 1.90(25)×10−4 and S1 = 1.1(3)×10−4; the latter value scales with R as
R2×S1 = const. For comparison, literature values are D0 = 62(15) eV, S0 =
2.0(4)× 10−4 from Ref. [35], and D0 = 99(10) eV, S0 = 1.66(40)× 10−4 from

Ref. [36]. Present values were obtained similarly to Ref. [37] from comparison
of experimental data with simulations of individual resonance sequences using
Wigner distribution of level spacings, Porter-Thomas distribution of reduced
neutron widths, and Gaussian distribution of radiative widths.

function (equiprobability for a single resonance at a given neutron energy to be either s-
or p-wave), constructed to deduce statistical resonance properties.
