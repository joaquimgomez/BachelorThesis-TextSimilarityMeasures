The n_TOF Collaboration

Abstract
Applications of nuclear data like neutron-induced reaction cross sections are
related to research fields as stellar nucleosynthesis, the study of nuclear level
densities and strength functions, and also play a key role in the safety and
criticality assessment of existing and future nuclear reactors, in areas con-
cerning radiation dosimetry, medical applications, transmutation of nuclear
waste, accelerator-driven systems and fuel cycle investigations. The eval-
uations in nuclear data libraries are based both on experimental data and
theoretical models. CERN’s neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF has pro-
duced a considerable amount of experimental data since it has become fully
operational with the start of its scientific measurement programme in 2002.
While for a long period a single measurement station (EAR1) located at 185
m from the neutron production target was available, the construction of a
second beam line at 20 m (EAR2) in 2014 has substantially increased the
measurement capabilities of the facility. An outline of the experimental nu-
clear data activities at CERN’s neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF will be
presented.

1. Introduction

Nuclear data is a generic notion comprising the physical properties related to nuclear structure and nu-
clear reactions. Evaluated nuclear reaction data are intended to be complete and to contain all reactions
and all energy regions, even where experimental data are missing, insufficient or inconsistent with other
experimental data sets. A nuclear data evaluation is a complicated process resulting from a careful

323



324 F. Gunsing et al.

analysis of available existing, sometimes inconsistent experimental data sets combined with optimum
theoretical models describing experimental data and providing data for gaps in experimental informa-
tion. The outcome of this process is a single recommended dataset, the evaluation. Both theoretical
models and experimental data are the fundamental ingredients in evaluated data.

Nuclear data in general, and neutron-induced reactions in particular, are important for a number
of research fields. They play a key role in the safety and criticality assessment of nuclear technology,
not only for existing power reactors but also for medical applications [1], radiation dosimetry, the
transmutation of nuclear waste, accelerator-driven systems, future reactor systems as in Generation IV,
and the thorium-based nuclear fuel cycle [2, 3, 4]. Other applications of nuclear data are related to
research fields as the study of nuclear level densities [5, 6] and stellar nucleosynthesis [7, 8, 9].

The nuclear data of nuclear reactions needed for such calculations are usually based on evaluated
nuclear data libraries, like JEFF [10], ENDF [11], JENDL [12], CENDL, BROND and several others.
Contributions to nuclear data come from a variety of experimental facilities, including the pulsed white
neutron source n_TOF at CERN, which has been recently upgraded with a second beam line.

2. The neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF at CERN

The neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF was constructed after an idea proposed by Rubbia et al.[45]
and has become fully operational with the start of the scientific measurement programme in May 2002.
The facility is based on the 6 ns wide, 20 GeV/c pulsed proton beam from CERN’s Proton Synchrotron
(PS) with typically 7×1012 protons per pulse, impinging on a lead spallation target, yielding about 300
neutrons per incident proton. A layer of water around the spallation target moderates the initially fast
neutrons down to a white spectrum of neutrons covering the full range between meV and GeV neutron
energy. The minimal time between two proton pulses is a multiple of 1.2 s, related to the operation
cycle of the PS. This allows to cover the neutron energy range down to subthermal energies without
overlap of slow neutrons from previous cycles.

During phase-I when the first spallation target was used from 2001 up to 2004, the water coolant
also served as the moderator. The spallation target was a block of lead of dimensions 80×80×60 cm3.
During phase-II, after the installation in 2008 of an upgraded cylindrical lead spallation target 60 cm
in length and 40 cm in diameter, the target was enclosed with a separate cooling circuit resulting in a
1 cm water layer in the beam direction, followed by an exchangeable moderator with a thickness of
4 cm. Normal water has been used as a moderator, as well as water with a saturated 10B-solution in
order to reduce the number of 2.23 MeV gamma rays from hydrogen capture, which otherwise forms
an important contribution to the background due to in-beam gamma rays. The 10B-loaded moderator
affects the energy distribution of the neutron flux only noticeably below 1 eV. The kinetic energy of
the neutrons is determined by time-of-flight which, combined with the known flight distance, gives the
neutron velocity.

A first neutron beam is collimated and guided through a vacuum neutron tube over a distance of
approximately 185 m to an experimental area (EAR1) where samples can be mounted in the beam and
neutron induced reactions can be studied. A more detailed description of the neutron source and EAR1
can be found in Ref. [46] and references therein.

A second neutron beam line and experimental area (EAR2), sketched in Fig. 1 has been con-
structed and is operational since 2014. This flight path is vertical and about 20 m long, viewing the top
part of the spallation target. In this case the cooling water circuit acts as a moderator. Due to the about
10 times shorter flight length, a much higher neutron flux of about a factor 25 is available, as shown
in Fig. 2. The about 10 times shorter flight path implies also in about 10 times shorter flight times,

2.1 Nuclear data measurements during phase-I (2001-2004)
During the first phase from 2001 to 2004 capture and fission data for a number of isotopes have been
taken. Capture measurements with C6D6 liquid scintillator detectors concerned 24,25,26Mg, 56Fe, the sta-
ble isotopes 90,91,92,94,96Zr and the radioactive one 93Zr, as well as the nuclei 139La, 151Sm, 186,187,188Os,
197Au, 204,206,207,208Pb, 209Bi, and 232Th. A 4π calorimeter consisting of 40 BaF2 crystals has been
used for neutron capture measurements of 197Au, 233U, 234U, and 237Np, 240Pu, and 243Am. Fission
cross sections were measured with the FIC-0 fission detector containing the actinides 232Th, 234U, 235U,
236U, 238U, and 237Np. A similar detector, FIC-1, which was ISO-2919 compliant, was used to mea-
sure neutron-induced fission cross sections of the actinides 233U, 235U, 238U 241Am, 243Am, and 245Cm.
Fission detectors based on Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters (PPACs) were developed and used in mea-
surements of the fission cross sections of natPb, 209Bi, 232Th, 237Np, 233U, 234U, 235U and 238U. A list of
measured isotopes and reactions together with the final or most relevant publication is given in table 1.

2.2 Nuclear data measurements during phase-II (2009-2012)
During phase-II from 2009-2012 mostly capture measurements were performed. The (n,γ) reaction on
the light nucleus 25Mg was investigated, as well as on several enriched iron and nickel isotopes (54Fe,
56Fe, 57Fe, 58Ni, 62Ni, 63Ni), and on the stable 92Zr and radioactive 93Zr. Capture reactions on the
actinides 236U, 238U and 241Am were performed, for the latter two with two different capture detector
systems: C6D6 scintillators using the total energy method, and the TAC, the BaF2 scintillator array
using the total absortion method. The TAC was also used in combination with a MicroMegas detector
in a first attempt to measure the 235U(n,γ) reaction using a veto on the 235U(n,f) reaction.

In addition to these measurements several other techniques have been tested at this facility. An
experiment aiming at resonance spin assignments was performed on a 87Sr sample. A first test mea-
surement with a MicroMegas detector was done to perform a fission measurement on 240Pu and 242Pu.
The results on 240Pu(n,f) were not conclusive due to the high radiaoctivity of this nucleus, degrading the
detector over time. This measurement was repeated in 2014 in the new EAR2, where the flux is much
higher, allowing to collect enough statistics in only a few weeks of measurement time. Another reaction
that was investigated was the 33S(n,α) reaction with a MicroMegas detector. Also this measurement
was was repeated later in EAR2 in 2015 to take advantage of the higher flux. A CVD diamond detector
was used to measure the 59Ni(n,α) cross section. Finally the 12C(n,p)12B reaction was exploited by
in-beam activation [67]. A list of the phase-II measurements and their references are given in table 2.

2.3 Nuclear data measurements during phase-III (from 2014)
During the long planned shutdown of CERN’s accelerator complex from the end of 2012 to mid 2014,
the construction of n_TOF’s new second beam line and experimental area EAR2 [68] was performed
and delivered by July 2014. The design was based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations with FLUKA
[48] in order to optimize the beam line and collimation for a high neutron flux together with a minimized
background. An impression of the EAR2 is shown in fig. 1. In order to remove charged particles from
the beam, a permanent 0.25 T magnet had to be installed since unlike the beamline for EAR1, there was
no room for an electromagnet. Since then, the facility has been taking data in both the experimental area
EAR1 (185 m horizontal flight path), and in the new EAR2 (20 m vertical flight path), using the neutron
beams simultaneously produced by the same cylindrical lead spallation target as used in Phase-II.

For the operation of Phase-III, a new data acquisition system was developed, based on 175
MSample digitizers with 1 ns of time-, and 12 bit amplitude resolution. In addition to the higher-
amplitude resolution, which was 8 bits with the previously used digitizers, a larger on-board memory
allows now to expand the exploitable time-of-flight range down to thermal neutron energies.

A set of in-house designed C6D6-based gamma-ray detectors and newly designed neutron flux
detectors based on silicon detectors and MicroMegas detectors [69] were used in beam. An XY-
MircoMegas detector with dedicated electronics was developed to measure the neutron beam profile.

The measurement programme in EAR2 started with a first part of commissioning by measuring
the elementary quantities as flux and background and focussing on the feasibility of fission measure-
ments. The energy dependence of the number of neutrons incident on the sample, approximatively re-

235U(n,f) in order to cover the energy dependence over a broad energy range. In fig. 2 the measured

neutron fluxes in EAR1 and EAR2 are shown. The thermal peak is strongly suppressed for EAR1 due
to the addition of 10B in the separate moderator. The thermal flux in EAR2 is not affected because in
this direction only the cooling water acts as a moderator.

After the first part of commissioning, the very first physics measurement in EAR2 concerned the
240Pu(n,f) reaction with MicroMegas detectors [70]. In 2015, the commissioning of EAR2 continued,
exploring the possibilities of (n,γ) measurements, for applications in nuclear astrophysics [71] and nu-
clear technology, as well as neutron-induced charged particle reactions like the 7Be(n,α) and upcoming
7Be(n,p) experiments. A list of measurements during 2014 and 2015 and their references are given in
table 3.

Conclusion

The key features of the n_TOF facility with its two beam lines and experimental areas EAR1 and EAR2
are a large energy range, high neutron-energy resolution, and a high instantaneous neutron flux. EAR2
with its about 25 times higher flux than in EAR1, combined with an additional reduction by a factor 10
of the background due to radioactivity, significantly enhances the possible measurements on unstable
targets at n_TOF. The preparation and characterization of such targets suitable for neutron cross-section
measurements is an increasingly complicated task, feasible only in highly specialized laboratories.
