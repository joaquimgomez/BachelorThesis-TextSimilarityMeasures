Abstract
Knowledge of neutron cross sections of various plutonium isotopes and other
minor actinides is crucial for the design of advanced nuclear systems. The
240,242Pu(n,f) cross sections were measured at the CERN n_TOF facility, tak-
ing advantage of the wide energy range (from thermal to GeV) and the high
instantaneous f ux of the neutron beam. In this work, preliminary results
for 242Pu are presented along with a theoretical cross section calculation per-
formed with the EMPIRE code.

1 Introduction

The sustainable use of nuclear energy as a means of reducing reliance on fossil-fuel for energy produc-
tion has motivated the development of nuclear systems characterised by a more eff cient use of nuclear
fuels, a lower production of nuclear waste, economic viability and competitiveness and minimal risk of
proliferation of nuclear material and is being pursued by international collaborations [1,2]. The accurate
knowledge of relevant nuclear data, including neutron cross sections of a variety of plutonium isotopes
and other minor actinides, is crucial for feasibility and performance studies of advanced nuclear systems.

In particular, the 240Pu and 242Pu isotopes are produced in thermal and fast reactors by successive
neutron captures and β- or α- decays. Both isotopes are non-f ssile and therefore unsuitable for recycling
in a thermal reactor, due to their low f ssion cross-section. Furthermore, they are typically produced faster
than they are transmuted due to their relatively long half-life. A more eff cient burning via f ssion would
occur with the harder neutron spectrum of a fast reactor.

In this context, the 240,242Pu(n,f) cross sections were measured at n_TOF relative to the well-
known 235U(n,f) cross section. These isotopes are included in the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) High
Priority List [3] and the NEA WPEC Subgroup 26 Report on the accuracy of nuclear data for advanced
reactor design [4].

The high α-activity (∼6.5 MBq/sample) of the 240Pu samples signif cantly complicates the anal-
ysis of the obtained data. The very high α-pile-up probability affects the pulse-height spectrum and
signif cantly reduces the quality of the separation of α-particles and f ssion fragments. Furthermore, a
signif cant deterioration of the detector performance was observed in the detectors exposed to the 240Pu
samples. For the above reasons, only preliminary results for the 242Pu(n,f) measurement are presented
in this work.

2 Experimental setup

2.1 The n_TOF facility

The experiment was carried out at the CERN n_TOF facility [5–7]. At n_TOF, neutrons are produced
through spallation induced by a 20 GeV/c bunched proton beam impinging on a massive lead target
and subsequent moderation in a few centimetres thick layer of (borated) water. The produced neutrons
have energies starting from thermal and up to over 10 GeV and travel along an approximately 185 m
long path to reach the experimental area. This allows to cover a very extended energy region in a single
experiment, thus reducing uncertainties related to different measurements performed in separate neutron
 
                                                                                 96 



energy ranges. The high instantaneous f ux of the n_TOF neutron beam mitigates the adverse effects of
the strong α-particle background produced by the samples and the low f ssion cross section below and
near the f ssion threshold.

2.2 Samples

Eight plutonium oxide (PuO2) samples manufactured at IRMM, Geel, were used [8] (4 × 240PuO2, 4 ×
242PuO2), for a total mass of 3.1 mg of 240Pu (∼0.11 mg/cm2 per sample, 99.90% purity) and 3.6 mg of
242Pu (∼0.13 mg/cm2 per sample, 99.97% purity). The material was electro-deposited on an aluminium
backing 0.25 mm thick and 5 cm in diameter, while the deposit itself had a diameter of 3 cm. Various
contaminants were present, mainly in the form of other plutonium isotopes, such as 238Pu, 239Pu, 241Pu
and 244Pu. While these impurities are present in very small amounts, the high f ssion cross sections of
f ssile contaminants compared to the isotopes of interest dominate in parts of the energy range studied.

Additionally, a 235U sample (UF4) with a mass of 18 mg deposited on a 0.2 mm thick aluminium
backing was used as reference. Since this sample had a diameter of 7 cm, its active area was reduced with
a thin aluminium mask to match the diameter of the plutonium samples. The active mass was therefore
reduced to 3.3 mg of 235U (∼0.47 mg/cm2).

2.3 Detectors and data acquisition

The measurements were performed with Micromegas (Micro-MEsh GAseous Structure) gas detectors
[9,10]. The gas volume of the Micromegas is separated into a charge collection region (several mm) and
an amplif cation region (typically tens of µm) by a thin “micromesh” with 35 µm diameter holes on its
surface. The amplif cation that takes place in the amplif cation region signif cantly improves the signal-
to-noise ratio of the detector. This is of special importance for the high neutron energy region, where
the f ssion signals are recorded within a few µs of the γ-f ash (see section 3.2). A chamber capable of
holding up to 10 sample-detector modules was constructed and used to house the plutonium and uranium
samples. The chamber was f lled with an Ar:CF4:isoC4H10 gas mixture (88:10:2) at a pressure of 1 bar
and under constant circulation.

Existing electronics from previous f ssion measurements were used for signal shaping. Additional
electronic protection was added to the pre-amplif er channels to prevent breakage, while the mesh voltage
value was chosen to minimize the number of sparks and subsequent trips. Furthermore, the shielding of
the pre-amplif er module was improved to mitigate the baseline oscillation observed following the prompt
γ-f ash. The standard n_TOF Data Acquisition System [5] based on 8-bit Acqiris f ash-ADCs was used
for recording and storing the raw data collected by the detectors at a sampling rate of 100 MHz.

Due to the low expected count rate for the measurement, the chamber was placed in the n_TOF
experimental area for several months and in parallel with other measurements performed at n_TOF.
Throughout the measurement, beam-off data were acquired in order to record the α- and spontaneous
f ssion background produced by the samples.

2.4 Experimental issues

The analysis of the experimental data is complicated by certain features of the experimental setup and
by sample-induced backgrounds. These include the baseline oscillation induced by the prompt “γ-f ash”
which is discussed in section 3.2 and the spontaneous f ssion background, particularly in the case of
242Pu.

While the above factors can be dealt with, an unexpected effect of the high α-activity of the
samples (>6 MBq for 240Pu) was encountered. After the end of the measurement, a visual inspection of
the detectors used with the 240Pu samples revealed a remarkable feature. As seen in f g. 1 (left panel), an
obvious circular discolouration of the mesh whose dimension and position exactly matched those of the
samples was observed. Upon closer inspection with a microscope (f g. 1, right panel), it became clear

deterioration of the detector gain and performance.

that the micromesh had suffered serious mechanical damage, particularly around the rims of the holes
which were evidently deformed.

The mechanical damage suffered by the detectors must lead to a deterioration of the electrical
f eld and therefore of the detector gain and overall performance. Indeed, this was clearly observed in the
240Pu data, where f ssion fragment and α-particle signals eventually became virtually indistinguishable
in the obtained pulse height spectra. Because of this, a considerable part of the 240Pu data must be
discarded, partially compromising the measurement. Although there was no visible damage, a similar
but less pronounced effect was observed in the 242Pu data, in the form of a slow but non-negligible gain
shift throughout the duration of the measurement. The data, therefore, need to be analysed in smaller
subsets where the gain can be considered constant.

For the above reasons, preliminary results on 242Pu only are being presented in this report.

3 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

3.1 Raw data analysis

The raw data from each detector are analysed by means of a pulse recognition routine that determines
the amplitude and position in time of the detected signals, among other quantities. The signal baseline
is determined by analysing the pre-trigger and post-acquisition window data, accounting for possible
signals (α or spontaneous f ssion) that may be present. Since the Pu samples are in the same chamber
as the 235U it can be assumed that they receive the same neutron f ux, while the f ssion count rates are
suff ciently low to ignore pile-up effects.

3.2 The high neutron energy region

The interactions of the proton beam with the spallation target lead to a signif cant production of prompt
γ-rays and other relativistic particles that travel to the experimental area at (nearly) the speed of light and
constitute the bulk of what is commonly termed the “γ-f ash”. In Micromegas detectors, this causes an
initial signal lasting a few hundred ns, followed by a baseline oscillation that lasts for several µs or, in
terms of neutron energy, down to 1-2 MeV. This behaviour can be observed in f g. 2 (top panel), where
the baseline oscillations are clearly visible.

This problem can be mitigated by applying a software “compensation” technique [11] to the dig-
itally recorded data. This method is based on the observation that the oscillations recorded in adjacent

detectors for the same proton bunch are almost identical. This can be seen by comparing the recorded
signals from two detectors placed consecutively in the chamber (f g. 2, top panel). The subtraction of
the output of adjacent detectors causes the oscillations to largely cancel each other out, leaving a residual
signal that consists primarily of signals attributable either to f ssion fragments or α-particles (f g. 2, bot-
tom panel). This signal is then analysed with the peak search routine used for the lower energy region,
thus extracting the desired pulse height spectra. The small residual of electronic noise is generally well
below the amplitude threshold for f ssion fragment detection.

3.3 Monte-Carlo simulations

The behaviour of the detectors was studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations performed with the
FLUKA code [12,13], focusing particularly on the reproduction of the pulse height spectra of α-particles
and f ssion fragments for the evaluation of the detector eff ciency and the quality of the peak-search
routine. In f g. 3, an experimental pulse height spectrum obtained from 235U and a simulated f ssion

fragment spectrum can be compared.

3.4 Present results

The spontaneous f ssion background dominates the low energy region and remains visible up to about 10
keV. Still, several resonances can be observed above this background. The f rst 242Pu resonance at ∼2.7
eV can be seen in the top left panel of Fig. 4, after subtraction of the spontaneous f ssion background,
as determined with a f t of the beam-off data. The top right and bottom left panels panel show resolved
resonances in the 700-800 eV region and up to approximately 1900 eV, including one at ∼780 eV and
one at ∼1830 eV not present in the evaluated libraries and, at a preliminary analysis, not attributable
to any of the stated sample impurities. Additional resonance candidates at higher energies have been
observed. Data above 1 keV are shown in the bottom right panel of Fig. 4. The data displayed are
combined from the two analysis methods; the conventional “straightforward” analysis, which fails above
about 2 MeV due to the baseline oscillations, and the high-energy analysis described in section 3.2. The
analysis of the high energy region will be extended up to several tens of MeV.

4 THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS

A theoretical calculation of the 242Pu(n,f) cross section was performed with the EMPIRE nuclear reaction
model code [14] (version 3.1). The level densities of the nuclei involved in the calculations were treated
within the framework of the Enhanced Generalised Superf uid Model (EGSM). The initial values used

and subsequently adjusted to better reproduce the experimental data. Preliminary results can be seen in

5 CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary results from the 242Pu(n,f) experiment performed at the CERN n_TOF facility are presented.
The experimental setup and analysis method is described, including auxiliary Monte-Carlo simulations
and an off-line technique to recover high-neutron energy data affected by the prompt γ-f ash.

Analysis of the 242Pu(n,f) data is well under way and is only complicated by the gradual detector
gain shift. Among the issues still to be addressed are the exact determination of the detector eff ciency
and the amplitude threshold correction, the accurate subtraction of the spontaneous f ssion background
and the estimation of all uncertainties involved. The analysis of the high-energy region data is particularly
CPU-intensive and is therefore proceeding at a relatively slow pace, given the amount of data acquired
during the measurement.

Finally, a signif cant part of the 240Pu(n,f) was discarded due to the damage suffered by the de-
tectors, as explained in section 2.4. Even under normal detector operation, the high α-pileup probability
(>30%) produces a long tail in the amplitude spectra that adversely affects the α - f ssion fragment sep-
aration. In order not to set a very high amplitude threshold that would further reduce the statistics, an
alternative approach – characterising and subtracting the α-background – will be employed.
