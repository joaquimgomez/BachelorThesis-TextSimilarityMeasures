The neutron capture cross section measurements at the CERN n_TOF facility are performed using
a new detection system, the segmented Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC). All measurements
are performed in reference to the well known 197Au σ (n,γ).
The accuracy of the measurements depends on the accuracy of the TAC detection efficiency,

which is calculated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In this MC simulation photon strength

functions and level densities play a major role as ingredients used for the generation of primary

events, that is the electromagnetic cascades following the (n,γ) process. We have calculated the
TAC detection efficiency for the case of 197Au(n,γ) by adjusting the photon strength functions
of 198Au so that the simulation reproduces the experimental data. Both the MC method and the

uncertainty of the results are discussed.

Application of PSF to (n,γ) measurements with the n_TOF TAC C. Guerrero

1. Introduction

The n_TOF Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) [1] is a segmented assembly of 40 BaF2
crystals used for neutron capture measurements [2] at the CERN n_TOF facility [3]. It is the
ideal device for measurements of low mass radioactive samples because of its segmentation and
high total absorption efficiency. These two characteristics can be used to discriminate the differ-
ent background components from the capture events attending to the energy deposited in the TAC
(Esum) and the number of crystals fired in each event, so-called crystal multiplicity (mγ ). The con-
ditions 2.5<Esum <7.5 MeV and mγ>2 are such that the capture to background ratio is maximized
and are referred herafter as analysis conditions.

The accurate calculation of the detection efficiency (εTAC) of the detection device is crucial in
the determination of the capture cross section. This εTAC is nearly 100% due to the characteristics of
the device: ∼4π solid angle coverage with 15 cm thick BaF2 crystals. However, when the analysis
conditions are applied the number of detected events decreases and εTAC needs to be calculated by
MC simulations. The MC simulation of the TAC includes the generation of primary events and the
tracking of the particles through the detector assembly.

The difficulties associated to the generation of (n,γ) primary events, that is the electromagnetic
cascades following any capture reaction, are related to the large number of nuclear levels in the
region of intersest, that is below the neutron separation energy Sn. In this energy range, statistical
models are needed to complement the experimental information on the nuclear levels scheme and
the transitions probabilities between levels. Moreover, the parameters of the different statistical
models are usually adjusted from experimental information and their validity is restricted to the
energy range under study.

Figure 1: View of the Total Absorption Calorimeter
as it is implemented in GEANT4.

In the case of photon strength functions
(PSF) used for the calculation of the transition
probabilities, the available parameterizations
are mostly intended to reproduce photoabsorp-
tion measurements with transitions of 5 MeV
and above. Therefore a new parameterization
may be needed to study the lower energy tran-
sitions that appear in (n,γ) reactions.

In this work, the detection efficiency of
the TAC with and without analysis conditions
is calculated for the case of 197Au(n,γ), which
is the reference for many n_TOF measure-
ments. The generalities of the MC code and the
primary event generator are described in sec-
tions 2 and 3. The adjustment of the PSF for
197Au(n,γ) reactions and the results of the MC
simulations are discussed in section 4. Finally,
the uncertainty of the results is calculated in
section 5.

2. Monte Carlo simulation code

The MC code is based in the GEANT4[4] simulation tool with the Standard Electromagnetic
package. The geometry of the detector assembly is implemented with high accuracy including
details down to millimeter scale. This is shown in Fig.1 where half of the TAC is shown together
with the neutron absorber, the beam line, the support structure, etc.

The photons and electrons emitted during the de-excitation of the nucleus after the neutron
capture reaction are transported through the detector assembly and the interactions taking place in
the BaF2 crystals are tracked and recorded. The individual interactions are grouped into capture
events with given mγ and Esum by performing a coincidence analysis capable of taking into ac-
count experimental effects such as signal summing, dead-time losses, detection threshold, energy
resolution, etc.

The TAC geometry, particle tracking and coincidence analysis software have been successfully
validated by comparison of the simulations with the measurements of well known γ-ray calibration
sources [5].

3. Neutron Capture Event Generator

Many experiments in nuclear physics need physics event generators which are used to drive
the simulations, prepare experimental proposals and test the analysis methods. In many cases, the
validity of the results may depend upon the quality of the event generators and the MC simulations.

Figure 2: Nuclear level scheme used in the cap-
ture cascade generator model.

An Event Generator is a piece of code which
generates a list of events, where each event con-
tains a set of particles created simultaneously.
Typically each particle is parameterized by its
type, initial position and momentum vector.

The generation of capture cascades follow-
ing neutron capture reactions requires the com-
plete knowledge of the nuclear level scheme (en-
ergy, spin and parity of all levels below Sn) and
transition probabilities between levels. This in-
formation is known experimentally only in a re-
duced energy range above the ground state and
models are required to describe these quantities in
the complete excitation energy range of interest.

The cascade generator used in this work has
been already used for previous n_TOF measure-
ment with total energy detectors, see for exam-
ple [6]. In this event generator the nuclear level
scheme is divided in two ranges, as shown in Fig.
2:

• The lower energy range corresponds to experimentally known levels (energy, spin and par-
ity) with known transitions probabilities. This information is retrieved from the Evaluated

Nuclear Structure Data Files [7] and allows the exact calculation of the low energy part of the
branching ratio matrix. The electron conversion process is included in this energy range from
the binding energies of the K-,L- and M-shells, fluorescence yields and internal conversion
coefficients.

• Between the cut-off energy Ecut and the neutron capture level at Ecap ' Sn +En, the levels and
transitions are calculated by means of models. In these models, individual levels are created
by sampling the level density distribution given by the Back Shifted Fermi Gas (BSFG)
model, and the transition probabilities between the generated levels are calculated for E1,
M1 and E2 transitions from the modeled PSF.

Starting at the capture level, with known spin and parity, a random sampling is performed in
order to generate a number of cascades sequentially, each generated as follows:

1. The branching ratio matrix for E1, M1 and E2 transitions is calculated from the capture level
to all underlying levels; which can be known or generated using the BSFG model.

2. The transition to a new level is sorted randomly according to the branching ratio matrix.

3. If the new level is in the statistical energy range, the branching ratio matrix for the new level
is calculated for all underlying levels. Otherwise, the branching ratio matrix is known from
ENSDF and does not need to be calculated.

4. Repeat step 2 until the ground (or metastable) state is reached.

The available parameterizations of the models describing PSF are usually the result of the study of
photoabsorption experiments. In these experiments the PSF can be studied for transitions of high
energy, usually above the Sn. For this reason the available PSF are only a good starting point to
study low energy transitions, as it is the case in this work, but they may need to be adjusted to
reproduce the experimental data.

4. Results for 197Au(n,γ)

The nuclear level scheme of 198Au is known experimentally up to ∼1.4 MeV [7], above this
energy the nucleus is described by statistical models as previously discussed. In this work, the
BSFG model parameters recommended in the RIPL-2 [8] data base have been chosen for the de-
scription of the level density and the parameterization of Kopecky et al. [9] for the calculation
of E1, M1 and E2 PSF, referred herafter as initial PSF (see Tab. 1). In the initial PSF, the en-
ergy dependence of the E1 transition probability is assumed to follow the shape of a Generalized
Lorentzian as described in [9], while the standard Lorentzian shape is assumed for the description
of M1 and E2 transition probabilities.

Fig. 3 shows the comparison between the experimental data (black) and the simulation using
the initial PSF (blue) of Esum and mγ for the case of

197Au(n,γ) at the top of the 4.9 eV resonance.
The differences that can be observed between these distributions are expected and are due to the
inaccuracy of the PSF in the energy range under study in this work. A good reproduction of the
experimental data can be only obtained after the implementation of a new parameterization of the

mental. Blue: Simulated using the initial PSF. Red: Simulated using the adjusted PSF.

A systematic study of the TAC response to variations in the PSF parameters shows that the
simulated and experimental data become compatible when the following changes are applied:

• increase the intensity of E1 transitions around Sn in order to decrease mγ , because these are
the only possible transitions from the capture state (2+) to directly populate the lowest laying
levels, 0, 55 and 192 keV with spin and parity 2-,1- and 1-, respectively.

• introduce two small resonances (Kopecky et al. introduce only one) for E1 transitions at 1.1
and 5.5 MeV,

• decrease the energy and width of the Lorentzian shape describing M1 transitions.
Applying these changes to the initial PSF it is possible t find several parameterizations that

allow the reproduction of the experimental data with high accuracy. An example is given in Tab. 2
and the associated TAC response is shown as a red line in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The average
mγ of the simulation (3.38) differs less than 1% from the experimental value (3.40) and the Esum
spectrum is reproduced even when the analysis condition of mγ>2 is applied.

The deposited energy in each crystal (Ecrystal) for events with a given mγ is more sensitive
to the de-excitation pattern of the compound nucleus than the mγ and Esum distributions. This is
shown in Fig. 4, where only events Esum > 2 MeV are selected. In this case, the simulation with
the adjusted PSF (red line), again, reproduces very accurately the experimental data (black line)
for all mγ .

5. Uncertainty in the detection efficiency

As stated below, there is more than one parameterization that can be used to reproduce the
experimental data with better or worse accuracy. In order to estimate the uncertainty in εTAC asso-
ciated to the arbitrariness in the choice of the PSF parameters, the TAC response has been simulated
(colored-dashed lines in Fig. 5) for several PSF that reproduce more or less the experimental data
(black-solid line in Fig. 5). The red dashed-line correspond to PSF3, which is the one discussed in

6. Conclusions

A method for calculating the TAC detection efficiency for any condition in mγ & Esum has
been developed and validated in this work. This is done by means of a Monte Carlo simulation
of the complete process, that is the generation of capture events and the tracking of the generated
particles trough the detector assembly. The generation of capture events is based on the nuclear
level scheme and transition probabilities between levels. The necessary information is available in
the form of experimental data at low excitation energies and statistical models at higher energies.

and crystal multiplicity distributions, it has been necessary to adjust the parameters describing the
photon strength functions of E1, M1 and E2 transitions.

It has been shown that it is possible to reproduce the experimental TAC response for different
conditions in mγ and Esum and to calculate the detection efficiency under the analysis conditions
with an accuracy better than 4.5%.

It is important to underline the significant amount of information that the TAC measurements
are able to provide regarding energy deposition and crystal multiplicity distributions for selected
conditions. This information can be used to study photon strength functions in a wide energy range
that is not easy to study by means of other experimental techniques. In particular, future plans
include the systematic study of photon strength functions and the search of scissor resonance struc-
tures in the PSF of the Minor Actinides measured at n_TOF.
