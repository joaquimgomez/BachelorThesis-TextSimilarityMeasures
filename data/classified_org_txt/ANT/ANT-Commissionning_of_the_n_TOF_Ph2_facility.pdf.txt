ABSTRACT 
 

The white spectrum neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF is operating at CERN since 2001. The 
neutron beam has a very high instantaneous flux and high resolution in energy and it is delivered 
in the experimental area located 187 m downstream from the spallation target. The intense neutron 
fluence per proton burst results in a much enhanced signal to background ratio for neutron capture 
and fission reactions on radioactive isotopes, thus making the facility well suited for accurate 
measurement of neutron-induced reaction cross-sections. This is especially true to highly 
radioactive targets which are of major importance in new nuclear energy system such as Gen-IV 
reactors, especially those with fast spectrum. Combined with state-of-the-art detectors and with 
advanced data acquisition systems, the innovative characteristics of the n_TOF neutron beam 
allow collecting data on a variety of stable and radioactive isotopes of interest for nuclear 
astrophysics and for applications to advanced reactor technologies.  
 
Key Words: neutron, time-of-flight, measurement 

 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
High accuracy neutron cross-section data are of major importance for a wide variety of research fields 
ranging from basic to applied nuclear physics. In particular in the context of nuclear technology, a 
renewed interest in nuclear energy production has triggered studies aimed at developing future generation 
systems that would address several safety, proliferation and waste concerns.  
 
For these applications the available nuclear data of many nuclides are not sufficiently accurate and 
sometimes even lacking [1,2]. Fast spectrum Gen-IV reactor requirements are pointing to the threshold 
region of several highly radioactive isotopes for which big discrepancies exists between present 
experimental data. In order to improve the evaluated neutron cross-section libraries such as ENDF/B, 
JEFF and JENDL, accurate measurements attainable at advanced neutron sources are of crucial 
importance. Based on these motivations the neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF has been constructed at 
CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. 
 
At n_TOF neutrons are produced by spallation reactions induced by a pulsed, 10 ns wide, 20 GeV/c 
proton beam with up to 7x1012 protons per pulse, impinging on a massive lead target which is surrounded 
by a water layer of 5 cm acting both as coolant and moderator of the spectrum. Thanks to this the n_TOF 
neutron energy spectrum spans over nine orders of magnitude, from thermal energy up to approximately 
1 GeV [3,4]. Together with the wide energy range, other important characteristics of the n_TOF facility 
are the very high instantaneous flux in the experimental area (around 106 neutrons/pulse), which makes 
the facility particularly suited for cross-section measurements on radioactive isotopes, while the very low

duty cycle (0.5 Hz) eliminates the problem of bunch wrap around. An evacuated neutron beam line leads 
to the experimental area located at 187 m from the lead target, which allows one to reach a high resolution 
in neutron energy. Two collimators exactly define the beam profile in the experimental area and a 
resulting low ambient background is obtained by massive iron and concrete shielding. 
 
In 2008 a new spallation target has been installed. It consists of a cylindrical Pb block of 60 cm diameter 
and 40 cm length, cooled by a forced flow of water. The water is chemically controlled in order to 
minimize its dissolution and corrosion capacity. The lead and the water are enclosed in an aluminum 
vessel which fits into the old target container, which acts as a secondary retention vessel. Inside the target 
pit, the cooling and moderator circuit are decoupled, offering the possibility to use various moderators. 
During the commissioning phase that started last May, we investigated the shape and intensity of the 
neutron fluence, the neutron beam profile, and the energy resolution of the facility by using a wide range 
of materials and detectors system. 
 
After a brief description of the new n_TOF spallation target, this contribution will present the 
measurements and the results concerning the intensity and energy distribution of the neutron, together 
with its spatial profile. Moreover the results of the 2009 physics campaign will also be shown, together 
with perspectives of future measurements.

After a three year long stop due to activation of the cooling water by spallation products, a new lead target 
was designed and constructed as well as new systems to fulfill the safety requirements before the restart 
of the facility. In particular a ventilation system has been installed to maintain the primary area 
depressurized with respect to the adjacent galleries. An optimized cooling system was developed allowing 
to control the chemical parameters of the water, in particular its oxygen content, and to reliably filter the 
activation products from the water. An extensive study of the corrosion mechanism has been performed to 
improve the long-term stability of the target. 
 
 
In order to optimize the cooling efficiency, without loosing in neutron production, the new target was 
shaped as a cylinder of 60 cm in diameter and 40 cm in length. The vessel surrounding the target has been 
designed to optimize the water circulation around the target, particularly at the proton beam impact spot. 
This later has also been significantly increased compared to the previous situation to avoid thermal stress 
on the target. 
 
Another improvement was achieved by the separation of the target cooling and of the moderator circuit. 
This enables the use of different moderator composition, providing greater flexibility in choosing the 
characteristics of the neutron beam.  
 
Since the size of the target, and the moderator thickness are similar to the previous one, the neutron flux 
and spectral shape are expected to be very close to the ones available in the past as predicted by 
simulations [5] performed with the FLUKA code [6]. Nevertheless, since the new target had to be 
installed inside the pool of the previous target, bigger absorption dips are expected in the 1-100 keV 
energy range, due to the increased aluminum thickness neutrons have to cross to reach the experimental 
area. 
 

3. NEUTRON FLUENCE SHAPE MEASUREMENTS 
 
 In order to investigate the energy distribution of the neutron beam several measurements have been 
performed: 

• A five plates fission chamber calibrated at PTB [7] containing 201.4(5) mg of 235U. The neutron 
fluence is determined from the counting rate, taking care of the well-known detector efficiency 
and the expected fission yield computed from a detailed MCNP simulation [8]. 

• A Silicon Monitor, SiMon, [9] consisting of 4 silicon detectors measuring tritium emitted by the 
(n,α) reaction from a thin (300 µg/cm2) 6Li foil. 

• A monitoring MicroMegas, MGAS, [10] consisting in two detectors containing a 10B deposit for 
measuring low energies neutrons and a 235U deposit for measuring high energies neutrons. 

 
Results, expressed in isolethargic units, are shown in figure 2. The black curve is the result from the PTB 
fission chamber. The red curve shows the results from the SiMon detector, while the green curve 
corresponds to the MGAS detector with the 10B deposit. The SiMon and MGAS results are scaled to the 
PTB fission chamber results in the neutron energy range below 1 eV. The results from the PTB fission 
chamber are shown only below and above the resonance region, since the analysis in this region still need 
some improvements. Data for the MGAS above 200 keV are not shown, since others reactions than the 
10B(n,α) are contributing to the detector‘s counting rate above this energy. Data from the SiMon detector 
are also cut at 200 keV due to the large uncertainties in the angular distribution of the reaction products. 
 
As can be seen from figure 2, the flux shape of the n_TOF facility presents a peak in the thermal region. 
From 1 eV to few tens of keV the flux is almost isolethargic. In the MeV region one can see the peak

associated with evaporation neutrons. Because of the presence of thick aluminum windows at the 
spallation target station, the flux presents big dips at 5.9, 35 and 86 keV. A dip at about 300 eV is also 
present due to the presence of manganese inside the aluminum alloy. 
 
As can be seen from figure 2 there is a very good agreement between the 3 measurements. Thanks to 
these measurements an overall uncertainty of 3% will be achievable in the flux shape determination. 
 

4. INTENSITY OF THE NEUTRON BEAM 
 
Although the absolute intensity of the neutron beam is not so critical for cross section measurements, this 
number is of importance to have a good knowledge of the facility performance. Since the PTB fission 
chamber is a very well known apparatus, one can obtain, in addition to the fluence shape, a precise 
determination of its intensity. The SiMon and MGAS detectors can also be used to reach this goal, but 
with a lower accuracy. 

 
In addition to these previous measurements the flux intensity has also been determined at 4.9 eV by using 
the activation technique and the Saturated Resonance Method, SRM, performed with the n_TOF Total 
Absorption Calorimeter, TAC [11]. For the activation two gold foils with 25 µm thickness each and 
45 mm in diameter (i.e. bigger than the beam spot) were placed back to back in the neutron beam. From 
the difference of counts, associated with the decay of 198Au, between the two foils on can estimate with an

accuracy of about 10% the neutron fluence around the 4.9 eV resonance of gold [8]. Finally, the 
combination of the saturated resonance method with the high detection efficiency of the n_TOF TAC also 
allowed us to determine the neutron fluence in the first resonance of gold energy region [8]. Figure 2 
shows the absolute neutron fluence determined thanks to the PTB fission chamber. The ratio to this 
measurement, and their associated errors, from the others measurement in summarized in the following 
table.

All the measurements are well in agreement within their associated uncertainties. Nevertheless one should 
note that the measured fluence is 16% lower than the one foreseen by the simulations [5]. 
 

5. NEUTRON BEAM PROFILE 
 
The neutron beam at n_TOF is shaped by means of two collimators located at, respectively, 135 and 175 
m from the lead spallation target, the latter being responsible for the shape of the beam in the 
experimental area. The knowledge of the beam profile, as well as its dependence with neutron energy is 
of primary importance for capture measurements, where the samples are smaller than the beam spot. The 
beam profile has been investigated by means of two position sensitive detectors, a MEDIPIX [12] and a 
bidimensional MicroMegas (XY-MGAS) [13].  
 
For the MEDIPIX detectors two neutrons converters have been used, 6Li for low energy neutrons (up to 
1 keV) and polyethylene for fast neutrons. Measurements have been performed in four neutron energies 
interval: 0.01-1 eV, 1-103 eV, 0.08-1 MeV , 0.08-200 MeV. 

 
The XY-MGAS detector, based on the bulk technology, consisted in a 6x6 cm2 active area, spited in 
106x106 strips read by two 96 channels Gassiplex cards allowing to obtain the beam profile at any

neutron energy. A 10B converter has been used with two different thicknesses: 20 nm to investigate low 
neutron energy, and 2 µm to study the profile for neutron energy up to 1 MeV. 
 

Figure 3 left shows the spatial distribution of neutron below 1 eV measured with XY-MGAS. Symbols on 
the right part of figure 3 correspond to a slice along the vertical axis for horizontal values between -0.28 
and +0.28 cm. The blue curve is the resulted from the simulated profile with similar conditions. If one 
assumes a 2 mm tilt in the second collimator one can reproduce very well the experimental data as shown 
by the red curve in figure 3. This small misalignment in the collimator system may also explain, at least 
partially, the discrepancy between the absolute neutron intensity and the measured one, as shown in the 
previous section. 
 

6. RESOLUTION FUNCTION 
 
Due to the finite size of the spallation target and the water moderator, the neutrons of a given energy do 
not arrive always at the same time to the experimental area. The time-to-energy distribution describing 
this process, known as the Resolution Function, RF, causes a broadening of the resonances that 
dominates over the Doppler broadening at energies above a few keV. Hence, the RF must be determined 
and taken into account for the analysis of resolved resonances. 
 

We have determined the RF associated to the n_TOF target and moderation system by means of FLUKA 
simulations [5] of the complete process: neutron production in the target by 20 GeV protons, neutron 
transport inside the target and neutron transport through the 5 cm thick water moderator. The resulting RF 
is shown in the left panel of figure 4, where it is observed that both the width and the tail of the RF 
increase with neutron energy.  
 
The broadening effect is illustrated in the right panel of figure 4, which shows the measured and expected 
capture yield for the 80.8 keV resonance of 56Fe. It is observed that taking into account the RF determined 
from MC simulation it is possible to reproduce with the good accuracy the measured yield with high 
accuracy.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES 

 
The n_TOF facility, which is aimed at measuring neutron cross sections relevant for the design and 
operation of advance nuclear energy systems, has resumed operation after a three years halt. The design 
and construction of a new spallation target ensures the long term use of the facility thanks to an improved 
cooling and ventilation systems. The new target also envisages the use of different moderators that fulfill 
the requirements of the different measurements. 
 
The first measurements of the 2009 campaign have aimed to fully characterize the neutron beam in terms 
of intensity and neutron energy distribution, spatial profile and resolution in energy. The preliminary 
analysis show that a 3% accuracy in the neutron energy distribution is achievable, thanks to the 
combination of various measurements using several standard reactions. The neutron flux shape is very 
similar to the past, but present stronger structures due to several thick aluminum windows close to the 
target. The neutron spatial distribution has been investigated thanks to the use of a MEDIPIX and a 2D-
MicroMegas detectors. First comparison close to the thermal energy region with a simulation of the 
optical transport of neutrons up to experimental area seem to indicate a small misalignment of our 
collimation system. If confirmed, the system will be re-aligned during the winter shutdown at CERN. The 
resolution in energy, that is the Resolution Function (RF) of the facility, have been determined by means 
of MC simulations with FLUKA. The resulting RF has been validated by comparison of the calculated 
shape of narrow 56Fe resonances with the experimental data. 
 
In order to measure with radioactive samples without requiring the ISO2919 sealed certification, it is 
foreseen to transform the experimental area in work sector of type A. This action will reduce the 
background associated to the sample canning in the case of radioactive samples, allowing to perform 
more accurate measurement up to higher neutron energies.
