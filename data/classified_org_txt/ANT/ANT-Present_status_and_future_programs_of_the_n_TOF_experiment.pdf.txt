The neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF at CERN, Switzerland, operational since 2001, delivers 
neutrons using the Proton Synchrotron (PS) 20 GeV/c proton beam impinging on a lead spallation 
target. The facility combines a very high instantaneous neutron flux, an excellent time of flight 
resolution due to the distance between the experimental area and the production target (185 meters), 
a low intrinsic background and a wide range of neutron energies, from thermal to GeV neutrons. 
These characteristics provide a unique possibility to perform neutron-induced capture and fission 
cross-section measurements for applications in nuclear astrophysics and in nuclear reactor 
technology. 
The most relevant measurements performed up to now and foreseen for the future will be presented 
in this contribution. The overall efficiency of the experimental program and the range of possible 
measurements achievable with the construction of a second experimental area (EAR-2), vertically 
located 20 m on top of the n_TOF spallation target, might offer a substantial improvement in 
measurement sensitivities. A feasibility study of the possible realisation of the installation 
extension will be also presented. 
 
 

I. INTRODUCTION 

High precision neutron cross-section data are of major importance for a wide variety of research 
fields in basic and applied nuclear physics [1]. In particular, neutron data on neutron-nucleus 
reactions are essential in Nuclear Astrophysics for understanding the production rate of heavy 
elements in the Universe, which occurs mainly through slow and rapid neutron capture processes 
during the various phases of stellar evolution [2,3].  In the field of nuclear technology new studies 
aimed at developing future generation nuclear system which would address major safety, 
proliferation and waste concerns are requiring more accurate data in neutron-induced fission and 
capture cross-section on radioactive isotopes. Based on these motivations the neutron time-of-flight 
facility n_TOF has been proposed at CERN, Geneva 
 
 

II. n_TOF FACILITY 

The idea of a new neutron time-of-flight facility at CERN was proposed by C. Rubbia in 1998 
[4], as a follow up of the TARC experiment, also conducted at CERN.

The concept of the n_TOF neutron beam [5] makes use of both the specifically high flux of 
neutrons attainable using the spallation process of 20 GeV/c protons on a massive lead target (see 
Fig.1), able to contain practically the whole spallation shower as well as the remarkable beam 
density of the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) [6]. After the initial proposal, in a short amount of 
time the facility was accepted for construction by CERN. The CERN n_TOF facility has been set 
in operation and commissioned in 2001 with performances matching the expectations. The PS 
machine of CERN can generate high intensities up to 7×1012 ppp (protons per pulse) - high enough 
to produce the vast number of 2×1015 neutrons per pulse - in the form of short (6 ns width) pulses 
with a repetition time varying from 1.2 s to 16.7 s and a prompt “flash” considerably smaller 
compared to electron machines. The high neutron flux, the low repetition rates and the excellent 
energy resolution of 5.5x10-4 (1KeV) have opened new possibilities for high precision cross section 
measurements in the energy range from thermal to GeV, for stable and, in particular, for 
radioactive targets. During the first years of operation 2001-2004 the n_TOF collaboration has 
attained a rich experimental program measuring in total 36 isotopes and producing numerous 
scientific papers and proceedings. (see table1 ) �7-25�.

III. n_TOF FACILITY FROM 2008 

After three years long stop due to cooling water activation by spallation products diluted in the 
water, a new lead target was constructed, and new systems developed in order to meet safety 
requirements for the restart of the facility. In particular, a ventilation system was installed in the 
primary target area, while a new optimized cooling system was developed, which allows to control 
and balance the chemical parameters of the water (in particular the oxygen content and 
conductivity) and to properly filter activation products eventually present in the water circuit. An 
extensive study of target corrosion mechanism had been performed, in order to improve the long-
term stability of the system. A new cylindrical shape lead block of 40 cm radius and 60 cm length, 
developed in order to optimize cooling and neutron production was designed and built. The new 
target assembly consists of a separated cooling and moderator circuit, which enables the use of 
different moderator materials, thus allowing a greater flexibility on the characteristics of the 
neutron beam.  
After the commissioning in which started in November 2008 and continue during mid-2009 two 
other changes have been implemented; the first is the implementation of a different moderator 
material other than light water. In particular, the program has envisaged the use of water enriched 
in 10B, which has greatly enhanced the measuring capabilities of neutron-induced capture cross-
section, by reducing significantly the presence of the in-beam photon component, and in particular 
the 2.2 MeV �-rays, produced both by neutron capture in hydrogen. Since this photon contribution 
is delayed, i.e. emitted after about 1 microsecond from the proton interaction (due to the fact that it 
is produced by thermalized neutrons), it would results in a background component in the 1-100 keV 
neutron energy range, which is problematic for capture reaction measurements performed with 
C6D6 detectors. The conceived system has reduced the 2.2 MeV photon components by a factor of 
about 10, leaving the neutron fluence unchanged above 1 eV. 
Another upgrade performed during the 2010 run has been the transformation of the n_TOF 
experimental area into a Work Sector Type A, which has allowed the possibility to perform 
measurements of capture and fission cross-section of “unsealed” samples of highly radioactive 
isotopes, such as actinides like 241Am, 243Am and 240-2Pu, taking full advantage of the facility’s high 
instantaneous neutron flux. This has required a complete revision of the experimental area and of 
the related technical services. The milestone of n_TOF facility is summing-up on fig.2

IV. OVERVIEW OF NOTABLE RESULTS ON CAPTURE AND FISSION CROSS 
SECTION 

Among the measurements presented on the table 1, some additional details will be given here, as 
they represent significant results obtained at n_TOF experiment. 
The data on neutron-induced fission cross section of minor actinides - and in particular for Cm and 
Am isotopes - are scarce and show large discrepancies between the available measurements: for 
these reasons, in 2004 a campaign has started on the measurement of the fission cross-section of 
these isotopes, using a Fast Ionization Chamber (FIC) specifically built for n_TOF.  

 
Figure 3. 245Cm(n,f) n TOF data between 1 keV and 1 MeV, compared with evaluated libraries and 
previous experimental data (metti referenza del mio articolo ND2010). 
 
Figure 3 shows the 245Cm(n,f) n_TOF data results between 1 keV and 1 MeV compared with 
evaluated libraries and previous measurement: in this energy range the n_TOF data are in average 
within 2% from ENDF/B-VII.0 and 3% from Moore et al.. The systematic uncertainty of the 
n_TOF data, including the value induced by the normalization, accounts to about 5% in the full 
neutron energy range.[26]

Figure 4 shows the n_TOF data on the 243Am(n,f) cross-section from 500 keV to 20 MeV 
compared to ENDF/B-VII.0 and previous results. The experimental points clearly show that the 
recent data by Laptev et al. overestimate the cross-section, while confirming the evaluations of 
ENDF/B-VII.0.[26] 
 

 
Figure 5. Neutron capture yield for 240Pu. 

 
Figure 5 shows an example of the capture yield on actinides measured at n_TOF: the n TOF data 
(red points) are 240Pu(n.g) fission yield analyzed with the SAMMY code (black line) and compared 
to the JEFF3.1 evaluated database. The high resolving power at the 185 m flight path has allowed 
identifying 6 new resonances in the keV region [27]. 
 
Another example of the n_TOF measurement capabilities and of the vast experimental campaign is 
given by the measurement of the capture cross-section of 186Os and 187Os, which has resulted 
also in a series of featured articles on Phys. Rev. C (http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-
for/10.1103/PhysRevC.82.015802).  
The precise determination of the neutron capture cross sections of these two isotopes is important 
to define the s-process abundance of 187Os at the formation of the solar system. This quantity can 
be used to evaluate the radiogenic component of the abundance of 187Os due to the decay of the 
unstable 187Re (t1/2 = 41.2 Gyr) and from this to infer the time duration of the nucleosynthesis in 
our galaxy (Re/Os cosmochronometer). The neutron capture cross sections of 186Os, 187Os, and 
188Os have been measured at the CERN n TOF facility from 1 eV to 1 MeV (see for example  
Fig. 6), covering the entire energy range of astrophysical interest. 

03001-p.6



 
Figure 6. The picture shows the 187Os(n.g) cross-section measured at the n_TOF installation with 
a set of two C6D6 detectors, compared with previous data. 
 
From these results average level spacings, radiative widths, and neutron strength functions have 
been deduced by statistical analyses to establish a consistent set of input data for detailed cross 
section calculations with the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. Based on these calculations stellar 
enhancement factors were obtained to correct the Maxwellian averaged cross sections determined 
from experimental (n,γ ) data. The corresponding stellar (n,γ ) cross sections have been used to 
separate the radiogenic part of the 187Os abundance from its s-process component and to define 
the mother/daughter ratio 187 Re/187 Os. 
With a schematic model which assumes an exponentially decreasing production rate for 187Re, it 
was shown that the new data limit the nuclear physics uncertainties for the rhenium-osmium clock 
to less than 1 Gyr, allowing a more accurate estimate for the age of our galaxy: the age of the 
universe by means of the Re/Os clock is claimed to be 15.3±0.8±2 Gyr. 
 
 

V. FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR EXPERIMENTAL AREA 2 (EAR-2) 

 
The overall efficiency of the experimental program and the range of possible measurements could 
be significantly improved with the construction of a 2nd Experimental Area (EAR2), vertically 
located 20 m on top of the n_TOF spallation target (see Fig.7) 
 

CNR*11

EPJ Web of Conferences 

 
Figure.7: Schematic view of the EAR-1 and of the proposed (EAR-2) 

 
The configuration of the foreseen n_TOF Experimental Area 2 allows to measure neutron-induced 
reactions with the following advantages: 
 
5.1  Reduction of ��-flash. 

Since most of the relativistic particles produced in spallation process and which generate the so-
called “� flash” are emitted in the forward direction, placing an experimental area at an angle of 90 
degrees with respect to the primary beam axis strongly reduces the related background effects. The 
strong reduction of these signals, which for some detectors are masking the signal from neutron 
reaction for the first �s, opens the possibility to extend - in those cases - the measurement of 
neutron induced reactions up to higher energies with respect to what is presently achievable in 
EAR1.  
 

5.2  Higher neutron flux 

Being closer to the spallation target (flight path of 20 m) the configuration provides a higher 
instantaneous neutron flux with respect to the present neutron fluence in EAR1 (flight path of 
185m from the spallation target); this is a clear advantage for the measurement of reactions on 
samples with very small masses or reactions with very small cross sections. The reduced energy 
resolution – which is an important aspect for the resolved resonances region - due to the smaller 
distance between the new experimental area and the target does not affect the measurements at high 
neutron energies. 
The neutron fluence, energy resolution and background are the basic parameters that describe the 
performances of each facility. Typically each facility made a great effort to reduce the background 
by introducing appropriate shielding, collimation system etc. However, when short lived 
radioactive targets are to be measured (as it is the majority of most of the recent n_TOF proposals) 
the background due to the natural radioactivity can be decreased by decreasing the sample mass, 
with direct consequence a proportional decrease on the reaction rate dNreaction/dt. The reaction rate 

03001-p.8



is directly proportional to the neutron fluence , which in the case of EAR2 is ~25 times larger than 
what is available in EAR1 (see Figure 8). 
 

 
Figure. 8: Comparison between the neutron fluence of the proposed EAR2 and the existing EAR1. 
The significant absorption dips in the EAR2 fluence are due to the large amount of structural Al 
between the spallation target and the vertical vacuum tube leading to EAR2.  
 
5.3  Higher signal to background ratio for radioactive samples 
 
In the case of time-of-flight measurements on radioactive samples, the background induced by the 
radioactive decay of the sample is directly proportional to the time needed for the measurement. A 
range of neutron energy ∆E corresponds to a window in time-of-flight ∆T, and the signal-to-noise 
ratio is therefore proportional to the ratio ∆E/∆T. From the classical relation between time-of-flight 
and neutron energy, it follows that ∆E/∆T is inversely proportional to the flight length L. Therefore 
the new short flight path will result in a more favorable signal to radioactive background ratio by a 
factor 185/19 which equals nearly a factor 10. 
 
5.4  Equivalent half-life 
 
The advantage of the last two points can be combined in comparisons when we define the 
“equivalent half-life”. We would like to compare the rate of neutron-induced reactions

The equivalent half life t1/2 value only depends on the performances of the facility and the cross 
section to be measured. This value gives us an indication of the measuring capabilities of the 
shortest lived isotopes in each experimental area. It is evident that in the EAR2, due to the shorter 
flight path and the low repetition rate of the PS machine the measuring capabilities are increased 
further by a factor of 10 on top of the increase of the neutron fluence (factor 25) resulting in a total 
gain of a factor of about 250 times (with respect to what is achievable presently by performing 
measurements in EAR1) on measuring radioactive samples with half lives as low as few tenths of 
years.[fig.9]. Figure 10 shows the equivalent half life in years as a function of the incoming neutron 
energy, for both measuring stations, the present one EAR1 @ 185m distance, and the future one 
EAR2 @ 19m distance, and both for two representative values of cross section σ(E) of 1 b and 
1 kb. The 1 b was chosen as a typical value of cross section for higher energies (above 1 MeV) and 
the 1 kb as a typical value for the resonance region (1 eV to few keV). Also the half life of some 
isotopes of the future proposals and past measurements are shown.

isotopes to be measured in EAR2 (238,241Pu) as well as the one corresponding to 245Cm, already 
measured in EAR1. 

 

VI.  SCIENTIFIC CASE 

 
The realization of the 2nd Experimental Area, with its short flight path, will contribute to a 
substantial improvement in experimental sensitivities and will open a new window to stellar 
nucleosynthesis, technological issues (such as transmutation or design of safety of future nuclear 
energy systems) and basic nuclear physics by allowing to measure neutron-induced reactions which 
are not accessible so far at any other installation. 
 
The main advantages of the 2nd Experimental Area are the following: 
 

� Neutron-induced reaction measurements can be performed on very small mass samples.  
This feature is crucial to reduce the activity of unstable samples and in cases where the 
available sample material is limited.(ex. 238Pu, 241Pu 243Cm, 244Cm, 245Cm, 242mAm, 231Pa, 
233Pa) 

� Measurement can be performed on isotopes with very small cross sections for which the 
optimization of the signal/background ratio is an essential prerequisite.(ex. 86Kr, 138Ba, 
140Ce, 208Pb ) 

� Measurement can be performed on much shorter time scales. Repeated runs with modified 
conditions are essential to check corrections and to reduce systematic uncertainties. 

CNR*11

03001-p.11



EPJ Web of Conferences 

� Measurements of neutron-induced cross sections at high energies (En>10-100 MeV), which 
are not possible in the existing EAR-1, will benefit from largely reduced the �-flash. This 
will be particularly important for measurements of (n, charge particle) reactions at high 
energies because Si and Ge detectors are most strongly affected by the �-flash.  

 
 

VII. CONCLUSION 

CERN n_TOF has proven to be a unique facility in the world for its performance. 
Since 2011 with its rich scientific program, the n_TOF experiment is contributing to the world 
efforts aimed at collecting high quality data, mostly on capture and fission neutron-induced 
reactions. 
The transformation of the Experimental Area into Work Sector of Type A has allowed performing 
measurement of capture and fission cross section of “unsealed” samples of highly radioactive 
isotopes. 
With the construction of the Experimental Area 2, the n_TOF installation is going to open new 
perspectives in the measurements of fission and capture cross-section with lower samples masses.
