Abstract

A new detection system for the measurement of beta-delayed neutron emission probabilities has been characterized using fission
products with well known β-delayed neutron emission properties. The setup consists of BELEN-20, a 4π neutron counter with
twenty 3He proportional tubes arranged inside a large polyethylene neutron moderator, a thin Si detector for β counting and a self-
triggering digital data acquisition system. The use of delayed-neutron precursors with different neutron emission windows allowed
the study of the effect of energy dependency on neutron, β and β-neutron rates. The observed effect is well reproduced by Monte
Carlo simulations. The impact of this dependency on the accuracy of neutron emission probabilities is discussed. A new accurate
value of the neutron emission probability for the important delayed-neutron precursor 137I was obtained, Pn = 7.76(14)%.

1. Introduction

Beta-delayed neutron emission is a form of decay that occurs
for nuclei with a large enough neutron excess. For delayed-
neutron precursors the neutron separation energy in the daugh-
ter nucleus S n is smaller than the decay energy window Qβ.5
As a result neutron unbound states can be populated in the de-
cay. The process becomes dominant far enough from stability.
The β-delayed neutron emission probability Pn conveys infor-
mation about the distribution and nature of nuclear levels pop-
ulated in the decay, which is dictated by nuclear shell structure10
and residual interactions [1]. Pn values are also important in-
puts for the description of the astrophysical r process respon-
sible for the synthesis of about half of the observed abundance
of elements heavier than iron [2]. These two fields of inter-
est, nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics, explain why the15
measurement of Pn values for exotic nuclei is one of the goals
of the DEcay SPECtroscopy (DESPEC) experiment [3] within
the NUclear STructure and Astrophysics Research (NUSTAR)
collaboration [4] at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research
(FAIR) [5]. The BEta deLayEd Neutron (BELEN) counter has20
been developed [6] for this purpose. It is based on the well

proven technology [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] of combining an array of
3He proportional tubes, selectively sensitive to low energy neu-
trons, with a hydrogenous neutron energy moderator. Detectors
with large solid angle and detection efficiency can be built in25
this way. The BELEN detector was conceived as a flexible and
easily reconfigurable system. The current version has forty-
eight 3He tubes, but previous versions with twenty [13, 14]
and thirty [15] tubes have been used in different measurements.
Some of these measurements were aimed at the accurate de-30
termination of Pn values of fission products relevant in reactor
technology. The fraction of neutrons in the reactor core coming
from β decay is an important parameter for the safe control of
reactor power [16]. This constitutes the third field of applica-
tion of this detector. The BELEN detector is part also of the35
largest neutron counter of this kind (more than 160 3He tubes)
that is being assembled by the BRIKEN collaboration [17] for
the measurement of exotic nuclei at RIKEN.

In this work we describe the characterization of the detec-
tor setup installed at the Cyclotron Laboratory of the Univer-40
sity of Jyväskylä during the 2010 measuring campaign [14].
For the characterization of the setup we used fission products
which are delayed-neutron precursors with well known proper-
ties. The instrumentation includes BELEN-20 and a Si β detec-
tor, a fairly common arrangement. A novelty in our setup is the45
introduction of a trigger-less data acquisition system. Its use al-

lows continuous control of data quality, which leads to greater
accuracy, with a minimum acquisition dead time. In this work
we also discuss some of the systematic effects which appear in
the use of β-neutron counting systems applied to the determi-50
nation of Pn values.

2. Determination of Pn values

The Pn value is the fraction of all decays which undergo
delayed-neutron emission. It is a common experimental ap-
proach, and the one we follow here, to obtain the number of55
decays from the number of β particles registered in a β detector
and the number of β-delayed neutron decays from the number
of neutrons observed in a neutron detector. Taking into account
the fact that detection efficiencies for both β particles and neu-
trons are energy dependent we can write60

In this equation i designates a level in the daughter nucleus

f a level in the final nucleus Z+1A−1 at excitation energy E f ,
which is populated from level i with probability Ii fn . N

number of detected neutrons with an efficiency εi fn , which are65

N i
β

is the number of detected β particles with an efficiency εi
β
,

which are emitted in the decay of the parent nucleus Z A to level
i. The right-hand side of Eq. 1 is the expression commonly
employed to calculate the Pn value but it emphasizes that ε̄β70
and ε̄n are average β and neutron efficiencies for all β particles
and all neutrons. Note that the summation over levels in the
daughter nucleus is restricted to neutron unbound states (Ei >
S n) in the numerator of Eq. 1, but runs over all levels (including
the ground state) in the denominator. From the form of Eq. 175
it is clear that the average efficiencies are nuclide dependent.
Equation 1 assumes that only one neutron is emitted per decay.
For multiple neutron emission appropriate formulae for Pxn can
be written.

Sometimes the quantity measured is the number of neutrons80
in coincidence with the β particle. This is necessary to en-
hance the neutron detection sensitivity whenever the rate of β-
delayed neutrons is comparable to or smaller than the rate of
background neutrons. In this case the expression reads

Here N i f
βn is the number of detected neutrons from the tran-85

sition i → f in coincidence with betas populating level i. This

requires detection of both the β particle (εi

) and the neutron

(εi fn ). On the right-hand side of Eq. 2 the symbol ε̄
′
β

represents
the β efficiency averaged over neutron unbound states, different
from the β efficiency averaged over all levels ε̄β.90

Neglecting the energy dependency of the β and neutron de-
tection efficiencies can be an important source of systematic
error. For instance the neutron moderation process in a counter
of the type used here can vary appreciably with initial neutron
energy leading to large efficiency variations. Since the neu-95
tron energy distribution is often unknown such detectors are
sometimes designed to produce an extremely flat efficiency re-
sponse [18]. However such designs reduce the average detec-
tion efficiency and therefore designs where the detection effi-
ciency is maximized are also favoured. In the latter case the av-100
erage neutron detection efficiency is more sensitive to the neu-
tron energy spectrum given by

n . The sys-

tematic correction to ε̄n due to the neutron energy distribution
for different β-delayed neutron emitters can be evaluated using
Monte Carlo simulations as shown in Section 5.105

Due to the continuum nature of the β spectrum the low energy
threshold in the electronic system introduces a strong energy
dependence of the β counting efficiencies for small Qβ−Ei end-
point energies. This causes isotope dependent effects on the av-
erage β detection efficiency and, more importantly, it can intro-110
duce large differences between ε̄′

β
and ε̄β. As a consequence the

cancellation of the average β efficiencies on the right-hand side
of Eq. 2, a usual assumption, can lead to large errors. In Sec-
tion 5 we evaluate the magnitude of such errors for the present
setup using Monte Carlo simulations.115

3. Experimental apparatus

3.1. Neutron and beta counters

The measurements were performed at the IGISOL mass sep-
arator [19] installed at the Cyclotron Laboratory of the Univer-
sity of Jyväskylä. A broad range of isotopes are produced in the120
proton-induced (Ep = 25 MeV) fission of a thin thorium target
inside the ion source. Reaction products which exit the target
are swept away by a Helium gas jet into the 30 kV electrostatic
accelerating stage of the separator. The low energy ion beam
is mass separated in a large dipole magnet with a modest mass125
resolution M/∆M ∼ 250. In order to separate the nucleus of
interest from accompanying isobars, the beam is directed to a
double Penning trap system [20] working as a very high reso-
lution mass separator. The purification cycle in the trap lasts
for about 200 ms after which time the bunch of ions is released130
towards the experimental station. The extracted beam is iso-
topically pure to a high degree. Isobars from the mass separator
are effectively suppressed in the trap, provided their mass differ-
ence with respect to the selected isotope is large in comparison
to the trap frequency width. This was the case in our measure-135
ment. An exception is the production of nuclei inside the trap
by decay of the selected isotope towards the end of the purifi-
cation cycle. Beta-decay daughters will be doubly charged and
have huge motional amplitudes in the trap resulting in a very
small chance, estimated to be on the level of few percent or140

lower, to be extracted and implanted. This type of contamina-
tion could affect the measurement of isotopes with very short
half-lives. The possible impact in our results is evaluated in
Section 4.

The beam travels inside a 1 mm thick aluminium vacuum145
tube with a diameter of 46 mm and is implanted on a movable
tape supported on a two roller system situated at a distance of
about 2 m from the exit of the trap (see Fig. 1). The space be-
tween the rollers is 12 mm. The tape used is a standard half-inch
wide computer tape with the magnetic layer facing the beam.150
We estimate that the implantation depth of the ions is about a
few tens of nanometers. At a distance of 6 mm behind the tape
is situated a 0.5 mm thick Si detector with an active diameter
of 25 mm mounted on a PCB frame. The use of such a thin Si
detector minimizes γ ray interactions. This detector has a geo-155
metrical efficiency of about 28% for counting β particles emit-
ted by the implanted ion. During the initial measurements we
found that the direction of the beam extracted from the trap was
drifting with time. The effect is amplified by the long distance
and as a result the implantation position was changing enough160
to produce variations in the β detection efficiency as large as a
factor of two when comparing different runs. This effect would
have been disastrous for the determination of Pn values, there-
fore two collimators with holes having diameters of 10 mm and
5 mm were placed at convenient positions along the tube. In165
this way the change of β efficiency during the whole beam time
was reduced to a negligible value as will be shown in Section 5.

Figure 1: Cut-away view of the beam tube around the implantation point in the
setup as implemented in the Geant4 simulation code. In orange the implantation
tape, in blue the Si detector.

The beam tube was placed inside the central hole of the neu-
tron counter in such a way that the implantation position is at
the center of the detector. The BELEN-20 version of the neu-170
tron counter used in this measurement consists of twenty 3He
proportional tubes arranged in two rings, with eight and twelve
tubes respectively, around the central hole (see Fig. 2) The cen-
tral hole has a radius of 55 mm and the detector rings have radii
of 95 mm and 145 mm. Each tube is placed inside a cylindri-175

cal hole made in the polyethylene moderator with a diameter
of 27.5 mm. The proportional tubes were fabricated by LND
Inc. [21] and have an external diameter of 25.4 mm. The gas
volume has an active length of 600 mm. The total length of the
tube including the HV connector is 676 mm. The tube wall is180
made of stainless steel and has a thickness of 0.5 mm. The tube
is held in position inside the hole by means of a polyethylene
plug with a hole for the high-voltage connection (see Fig. 2).
The gas is a mixture of 3He with 3% of CO2 at a pressure of 20
atmospheres. The neutron moderator block is made with slabs185
of high density polyethylene (PE) with a measured density of
ρ = 0.955 g/cm3. Seven slabs with a thickness of 100 mm
and a cross section of 500 × 500 mm2 make the core of the PE
moderator. The eighth slab at the end acts as shielding against
the external neutron background. The neutron shielding on the190
sides of the moderator block has a thickness of 200 mm and is
assembled from twelve different PE slabs. The overall dimen-
sions of the PE block are 900 × 900 × 800 mm2. The distribu-
tion of tubes inside the neutron moderator was obtained [22] as
a result of MC simulations with MCNPX [23] and Geant4 [24].195
This particular arrangement is optimized to enhance neutron de-
tection efficiency.

tubes around the central hole. The tubes are connected to the preamplifiers on
both sides. The beam tube (not shown) is inserted from the back.

The pulses from the Si detector are integrated in a charge
sensitive preamplifier model TC170 from Tennelec and shaped
with an Ortec 671 spectroscopy amplifier. The signals from the200
3He tubes are fed to two MPR-16-HV charge sensitive pream-
plifiers from Mesytec. These 16 channel modules have a dif-
ferential output and are connected to Mesytec 16 channel spec-
troscopy amplifiers model STM-16+. All preamplifier signals
are shaped to Gaussian pulses with a shaping time of 1 µs. We205
found that the use of the shaper allowed us to have a better sep-
aration from the noise. A home-made fixed frequency clock
(10 Hz) is used to trigger a tail pulse generator model BH-1
from Berkeley Nucleonics Corporation. The pulser signal is
sent to the test input of the preamplifiers and the height ad-210
justed to have a peak at a convenient location in the amplitude
spectra. The pulser allows the precise measurement of the real

data acquisition time (live time).

3.2. Self-triggered digital data acquisition system
The time for neutrons to moderate their energy in the215

polyethylene and be captured in 3He is quite long, up to sev-
eral hundreds of microseconds (see Fig. 6 and Section 4). This
affects the performance of conventional triggered data acquisi-
tion systems (DACQ). The registration of decay events includ-
ing both the neutron and the prompt detected radiation, β parti-220
cles or γ rays, requires an event gate of similar magnitude and
is thus affected by a large dead time. The long event gate also
enhances the chance of registering uncorrelated signals and the
registration of multiple signals in the same channel. The sepa-
ration of random and true coincidences is best done by studying225
all time correlations in the event time window. But in addition
to the time it is important to measure the amplitude of every
registered signal. This allows one, for instance, to discriminate
efficiently against fluctuating detector noise. However measur-
ing the amplitude becomes difficult with multiple signals within230
the gate. All of these issues can be resolved with a self-triggered
DACQ based on sampling digitizers where each DACQ detec-
tor channel runs independently [25]. Such a system has a very
much reduced intrinsic dead time. A potential problem with
such systems is the large amount of data which needs to be235
transferred (introducing additional dead time) and stored. The
solution adopted for the BELEN DACQ is to use pulse self trig-
gering and on-board processing of the digitized signal to obtain
for every pulse a time reference (time stamp) and the ampli-
tude [26]. This reduces tremendously the amount of data to be240
transferred.

The DACQ used during the 2010 campaign is based on
SIS3302 VME digitizers from Struck Innovative Systeme [27].
These are 8 channel modules with 100 MHz sampling fre-
quency and 16 bit resolution. Every two channels share a Field245
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that stores the firmware
to process the digitized pulse. We use the standard Gamma
firmware from the manufacturer which matches our require-
ments for on-board data processing. A trapezoidal Finite Im-
pulse Response (FIR) filter produces a short waveform for dis-250
crimination purposes (fast filter). Signals out of the fast filter
that are larger than a given threshold generate an internal trig-
ger for processing the input pulse with a second FIR filter for
precise amplitude determination (slow filter). At the same time
the crossing of the threshold by the fast filter signal retrieves255
the content of a sample counter with 48 bit capacity which pro-
vides an absolute time stamp with 10 ns resolution. The slow
filter is of trapezoidal type with compensation. The latter term
refers to a correction for preamplifier signal fall time, which the
firmware presumes is the shape of the input signal. The param-260
eters of both filters can be adjusted independently according to
the characteristics of the input signal. The timing resolution of
the fast filter applied to the shaped signals was very poor (over
100 ns) but it is of no relevance in the present application. The
application of the slow filter to Gaussian shaped signals (see265
Section 3.1) produces some distortion of the amplitude spec-
trum (see lower panel in Fig. 3) which is also of no concern in
the present application. The parameters of the slow filter that

we use lead to a signal processing time of 10 µs. As every
channel is independent the rate dependent dead time has to be270
determined for every one. This is done with a fixed frequency
pulser distributed to all channels via the preamplifiers as men-
tioned above.

Each acquisition channel has a 64 MByte on-board memory,
where the result of the digital processing of the signal is stored.275
Typically we reduce the stored pulse information to the mini-
mum, which includes the time stamp and the amplitude of the
slow filter output. This requires 24 bytes of space per pulse. It
also includes a flag signaling pulse pile-up when a second pulse
within the processing time produces an internal trigger. Other280
event data storage options are available including the storage
of the pulse waveform or the output of the slow filter. Each
channel memory is divided into two banks. This allows one to
accumulate data in one bank and at the same time retrieve the
stored data from the second bank to the computer. This arrange-285
ment contributes to reducing the DACQ overall dead-time. The
communication with the computer occurs via an optical link,
which connects the SIS1100 PCI card with the SIS3100 VME
interface card (both from Struck).

The gasificTL [28] data acquisition software is organized into290
four parallel processes which are responsible for: 1) hardware
configuration and control, 2) block data read-out, 3) data stor-
age on permanent media, and 4) on-line analysis. A fifth pro-
cess, the Graphical User Interface (GUI), facilitates the control
of these tasks. The GUI is built using Qt software [29]. For the295
communication and synchronization of the different processes
we use Inter Process Communication (IPC) libraries available
in POSIX [30]. Data is shared between processes though mem-
ory mapped files. The use of semaphores regulates the traffic
of data and resolves conflicts between processes. Data storage300
on disk has priority over the other processes. Read-out from a
data bank, and accumulation on the alternative bank, is started
by a Look At Me (LAM) signal generated when any channel
memory is almost full or after a predetermined time. On-line
analysis can be very demanding, in particular the reconstruction305
of events and time correlations, and the software uses parallel
processing to speed it up. Nevertheless typically only a fraction
of the stored data is analyzed on-line. For construction, visu-
alization and manipulation of histograms the DACQ relies on
the ROOT data analysis framework [31]. The DACQ software310
uses a custom library which provides services as input/output
abstraction, allowing to process data from hardware, filesystem
or network indistinctly, management of DACQ configuration
and setup, time stamp sorting, event windowing for classifica-
tion and packaging, and data transformation for second level315
analysis. The library is written in C++ using the standard tem-
plate library which provides genericity, predictable behavior in
memory management and a well know algorithm cost.

The latest version of the DACQ also uses the SIS3316, a
16 channel digitizer with 250 MSamples/s and 14 bit resolu-320
tion from Struck. The firmware incorporates new features, in-
cluding a Constant Fraction Discrimination (CFD) algorithm
which provides improved time resolution. The new DACQ
was used successfully in a recent measurement with BELEN-
48 at Jyväskylä. The new system has been upgraded to han-325

4



dle multiple VME crates, and a total of 192 acquisition chan-
nels. This extension is required to match the neutron detector
of the BRIKEN project [17]. The DACQ has been also ap-
plied to other types of detectors like liquid scintillation detec-
tors for neutron detection [32] and a NaI(Tl) total absorption330
γ-ray spectrometer [33].

4. Measurements and data analysis

To characterize the neutron-beta counting system we mea-
sured four well known β-delayed neutron emitters: 88Br, 94Rb,
95Rb and 137I. Table 1 gives their half-life T1/2 taken from335
ENSDF [34, 35, 36, 37], total decay energy Qβ, and daughter
neutron separation energy S n taken from [38] and the neutron
emission probability Pn taken from [39].

Table 1: Half-life T1/2, decay energy window Qβ, daughter neutron separation
energy S n, and neutron emission probability Pn for each measured isotope.

137I 24.5(2) 6.027(8) 4.02556(10) 7.33(38)

Each β-delayed neutron precursor was implanted for a pe-
riod of time equivalent to three half-lives. The measuring time340
started 1 s before the accumulation period and lasted for a pe-
riod of ten half-lives. At this point the activity on the tape was
moved out, the time stamp scaler reset to zero and a new mea-
surement cycle started. During the tape transport and accumu-
lation “off” periods the primary beam is kept on target but the345
secondary beam is deflected to a beam dump located far away
from the experimental setup.

The amplitudes of the signals from the Si detector and each
3He tube are calibrated in energy and histogramed as shown in
Fig. 3. We use the position of the peak in the tube response and350
assign it a value of 764 keV, the energy released in the reaction
3He(n, p)3H, to calibrate the neutron spectrum. The calibration
of the β spectrum is made by comparison with Monte Carlo
simulations of the energy deposited in the Si detector (see Sec-
tion 5). The good separation of neutron signals from the noise355
can be seen in the lower panel of Fig. 3. We tag as neutron sig-
nals those which have an amplitude in the range of 130 keV to
920 keV. The noise level in the Si detector allows us to set a low
energy threshold of 100 keV to tag β signals (see upper panel
of Fig. 3). For each neutron or β event that fulfills the energy360
condition we histogramed its time stamp. In this way growth
and decay curves of the activity are reconstructed (see Fig. 4
and Fig. 5). We also construct β-neutron time correlation his-
tograms from these events. For every β event the time stamp dif-
ference with all neutron events in a time interval ranging from365
-1 ms to +1 ms is histogramed. Figure 6 shows an example.

neutron detector during the measurement. The dark grey shaded area shows the
events tagged as β particles (upper panel) and neutrons (lower panel). Peaks
due to noise and pulser signals are marked. In the Si detector the pulser peak is
outside the range shown.

The asymmetric shape of the peak is due to the moderation-
plus-capture time distribution of neutrons in the detector. The
mean value of this time distribution is approximately 80 µs but
the distribution extends up to about 500 µs.370

The number of detected β particles Nβ and neutrons Nn which
are to be ascribed to the decay of the parent nucleus is obtained
from a time analysis decomposition of the growth and decay
curves. This allows one to separate out the contribution from
descendants. The time evolution of the number of counts due to375
all isotopes in the decay chain is described using the solution to
the appropriate Bateman equations [40]. The experimental time
distribution is fitted using either the chi-square minimization
method or the maximum likelihood method for binned data.
For that we use MINUIT optimization routines [41] which are380
integrated in ROOT. The fit function is based on the generic so-
lution to the Bateman equations given in Ref. [42]. The solution
has the form:

Ni(t) represents the number of i nuclei at time t, i represent-
ing the ordering number in the decay chain, Ni(t0) the number385
of nuclei at the initial time t0, Ri its constant rate of production,
and λi = ln2/T i1/2 its decay constant. The term bk,k+1 repre-
sents the branching ratio between two successive isotopes in
the decay chain. This formula is adjusted to the conditions of
our measurement where only the parent nucleus was implanted.390
We use two forms, one assuming constant continuous implan-
tation (see Fig. 5), and the other a series of instantaneous im-
plantations (see Fig. 4). The latter is applied for the very short-
lived isotopes where the pulsed nature of the beam from the trap
shows up in the time distribution as seen in Fig. 4. In the contin-395
uous implantation case we set all Ni(t0) and all Ri equal to zero

except R1. The function is defined in this way up to the end
of the implantation period, determining the number of nuclei
of each species formed up to this time which become Ni(timpl).
Afterwards the time evolution is calculated setting Ri = 0. In400
the discrete implantation case we set to zero all Ri and all Ni(tk)
at each implantation time tk except N1(tk).

All decaying isotopes contributing to the time distribution
are included in the fit. In the cases studied here, only the par-
ent happens to be a β-delayed neutron emitter. Therefore the fit405
function for the β time distribution includes two decay chains
with b12 weights, 1 − Pn and Pn respectively. The actual func-
tion has the form

∑
i ε̄

i
β
λiNi(t). In accordance with the discus-

sion in Section 2 we use in this expression a different average
β efficiency for each isotope. However, as will be shown later,410
this dependency is very small in the present case and we can
use the same efficiency ε̄β for all of them. In the case of the
neutron time distribution only the parent is included and the ac-
tual function is ε̄nPnλ1N1(t). A constant background is added
to the fit function. The 1 s time period at the beginning of415
the measuring cycle, before implantation starts, serves to fix
the background level. In the case of neutrons the background
rate was 0.9 cps during the measurements (accelerator on). For
comparison, the rate descended to 0.7 cps when the accelera-
tor was turned off. The presence of a β background, visible in420
all time spectra, is explained because the beam collimation sys-
tem described above could not avoid that a fraction of the beam
was implanted outside the tape, on the tape supporting struc-
ture or on the detector. We calculated the time dependence of
the accumulated activity, not removed by the tape system, and425
concluded that after several measuring cycles it can be well rep-
resented by a constant value. For the nuclei analyzed here the
values of T1/2 for parent and descendants are well known. The
same is true for the Pn values. Therefore the only free parameter
in the fit is the product of the number of implanted parent ions430
(timpl × R1 or

∑
k N1(tk)) times the detection efficiency. Integra-

tion of the parent activity curves provides Nβ and Nn. Figures 4
and 5 show examples of the fits obtained.

We have verified the assumption that only the parent nucleus
is implanted. From the discussion in Section 3 and the half-live435
values in Table 1, one can conclude that contamination with
daughter nuclei from decay in the trap is more likely to occur in
the case of 95Rb. Therefore we analyzed the time distribution of
β signals in the upper panel of Fig. 4 using a fit function which
includes the implantation of daughter nuclei in addition to par-440
ent nuclei. A new fit parameter is introduced that corresponds
to the fraction of daughter to parent nuclei. If this parameter is
left free the best fit corresponds to values consistent with zero.
If the parameter is fixed to 5% one observes a clear deteriora-
tion of the chi-square while the number of β particles associated445
with the parent decay Nβ only changes by 0.4%. Note that this
fraction of daughter nuclei corresponds to the assumption that
10% of decay products produced in the trap are extracted an im-
planted, which is unrealistic. We conclude that for all practical
purposes the beam is pure.450

The case of 137I (Fig. 5) and 88Br (not shown) were special.
In both cases the β activity towards the end of the cycle was
smaller than the calculated values. The solution to the puzzle

came with the realization that both descendants 137Xe and 88Kr
are noble gases with a tendency to diffuse easily from organic455
plastic materials. The magnetic substrate of the implantation
tape is actually composed of magnetic granules embedded in
an acrylic layer. Therefore a fraction of daughter nuclei can
escape from the tape and do not contribute to the measured β
rate. A similar effect has been observed before [43]. To solve460
the problem we added a loss term for Xe and Kr isotopes to the
Bateman equations. The loss rate was assumed constant and the
solution function was modified accordingly. The loss rate is an
additional fit parameter in these cases. This adds a systematic
uncertainty to the parent β rate determined from the fit but we465
estimate that this uncertainty is small (see below).

Figure 6: Decay of 94Rb. Time difference between all neutron events and a β
event in the range from -1 ms to +1ms.

To determine the number of β-neutron correlated events Nβn
we use the time correlation histograms (see Fig. 6). The nega-
tive time part of the histogram (backwards in time) represents
faithfully the background of random correlated events under470
the true correlations in the forward time direction. As can be
seen the rate of random events is constant in this time win-
dow. Therefore a fit to the negative part of the histogram is
used to subtract the background from the positive time events.
The length of the time window, 1 ms, is long enough to ensure475
that all the neutrons are collected.

We give in Table 2 the values of Nβ, Nn and Nβn obtained in
the way described above for the four isotopes. These numbers
have been corrected for data acquisition dead time, although the
correction is very small, less than 0.3% in all cases. The dead480
time correction for each acquisition channel was determined by
comparison of the number of counts in the peak due to the fixed-
frequency pulse generator and the total measuring time. This
was calculated from the number of measuring cycles and the
cycle time length, determined from the cycle time histograms485
(such as those shown in Fig. 5).

5. Results and discussion

From the numbers given in Table 2 and the known Pn value
(Table 1) we can calculate the quantity ε̄β/ε̄n using Eq. 1. This
purely experimental quantity should be independent of the nu-490
cleus concerned except for the systematic effects discussed in
Section 1. It characterizes the β-neutron counting setup and,
once determined, allows one to obtain Pn values for other iso-
topes. Figure 7 represents the ratio of average β and neutron
efficiencies for the four isotopes. The dashed line connects the495
uncorrected values and the solid line connects the values cor-
rected by systematic effects on ε̄β and ε̄n as will be detailed
below. As can be appreciated the corrections are very small.
There is a very good agreement between the different isotopes
which indicates that systematic errors are well under control, in500
particular the variations of β efficiency with time. The weighted
average of the ratio is ε̄β/ε̄n = 0.506(7), which has an uncer-
tainty of only 1.4%. This value has been used to determine the
Pn values for other isotopes [14].

To compute the corrections to the neutron efficiency coming505
from the neutron energy distribution we have used Geant4 MC
simulations. We implemented a particle generator which repro-
duces the neutron energy distribution taken from the ENDF/B-
VII.1 [44] nuclear data base. The data in this file come from the

oretical calculations [46] outside the measured energy range.
Figure 8 shows the neutron energy distributions for 88Br and
137I. 94Rb and 95Rb are excluded for clarity. The figure shows
also the neutron detection efficiency as a function of neutron
energy obtained from the Geant4 simulations. The simulations515
were performed with version 10.0 (patch 3) of the simulation
toolkit. In the code we include a detailed geometrical descrip-
tion of the BELEN neutron counter. As can be observed the ef-
ficiency is rather constant below 0.5 MeV, with a value of about
47%, but decreases steadily with neutron energy above that en-520
ergy, being only 29% at 5 MeV. Although the energy window
for neutron emission Qβn = Qβ − S n varies from 1.9 MeV for
88Br to 4.9 MeV for 95Rb (see Table 3), the Fermi decay rate
function shifts the neutron spectrum to rather low energies as
observed in Fig. 8. In fact the largest average neutron energy525
〈En〉 is 625 keV and corresponds to the decay of 137I. Because
of this one expects a modest isotope dependency for the aver-
age neutron efficiency. This is confirmed by the simulation as
shown in Table 3.

In Table 3 and in Fig. 8 we also show data for the 252Cf530
spontaneous-fission neutron source. This source is often used
to calibrate neutron detectors. The Californium neutron energy
spectrum shown in Fig. 8 is taken from Ref. [47]. The spec-
trum reaches 25 MeV and has an average energy of 2.2 MeV.
Thus it senses a portion of the efficiency curve different from535
the fission products. The result of the simulation gives an av-
erage neutron efficiency of 39.5%. We used a calibrated 252Cf
source to measure the neutron detection efficiency and obtained
a value of 40.9(8)% in good agreement with the simulation.
It should be noted that this level of agreement could only be540
reached after correction of some bugs [48] in Geant4 which
have been incorporated in version 10.0 and later versions of
the code. The ratio between the counts of the inner and the
outer ring of 3He tubes is quite sensitive to the neutron energy
distribution [10]. The measured ratio is 1.499(3) in quite good545
agreement with the result of the simulation 1.52. In addition
it is worth mentioning that the simulation reproduces well the
neutron moderation-plus-capture time distribution, like the one
shown in Fig. 6. These results show the suitability of Geant4

for simulating the response of this type of neutron detector.550
The correction factor to be applied to ε̄n for each isotope is

calculated as the ratio of the simulated efficiency in Table 3 to
the average value for the four isotopes. The correction is small,
varying between −1.1% for 95Rb and +1.2% for 88Br. How-
ever the correction can be important for decays where the Qβn555
window is large and the β intensity distribution is sizable at ex-
citation energies well above S n. Such a situation can be found
in lighter nuclei. It is also possible that nuclear structure effects
could produce a similar situation for other nuclei with very low
level density, such as those close to doubly magic nuclei. It is560
obvious that this way of calculating the corrections to the av-
erage neutron efficiency can only be applied if the β-delayed
neutron energy spectrum is known. When this is not the case
the magnitude of the systematic error due to the unknown neu-
tron energy distribution can be obtained from assumptions or565
calculations of the β intensity distribution. For detectors having
more than two rings of tubes, an improved estimate of the av-
erage neutron efficiency can be obtained using the information
from the ratio of counts between different rings [10].

We now consider the corrections to the β efficiency coming570
from the β intensity distribution. In Fig. 9 we show the β effi-
ciency as a function of end point energy obtained from Geant4
simulations. The simulation application includes a detailed de-
scription of the geometry of the implantation setup (see Fig. 1):

tape, rollers, supporting structure, Si detector and mounting,575
vacuum tube and end-cap. For the efficiency calculation we
assume a β spectrum shape of allowed type. The use of forbid-
den shapes has a minor impact on the efficiency. The simulated
efficiency is scaled down with a factor of 0.806 to take into ac-
count that part of the beam is implanted outside the tape and580
is not seen by the Si detector. How this factor was determined
is explained below. As can be observed the efficiency varies
strongly up to 2 MeV due to the effect of the 100 keV detection
threshold in the Si detector. In the figure we also show the β in-
tensity distributions for the four fission products. The distribu-585
tions are scaled for clarity. The lower panel shows the intensity
Iβγ that is followed by γ emission or feeds the ground state in
the daughter nucleus. For 95Rb and 137I the distribution is taken
from the ENSDF data base [36, 37] and was obtained with high-
resolution γ-ray spectroscopy using germanium detectors. For590
88Br and 94Rb we show the result of recent experiments [49]
using total absorption γ-ray spectroscopy (TAGS). The upper
panel shows the β intensity distribution that is followed by neu-
tron emission Iβn. This intensity distribution was obtained from
the deconvolution of the neutron spectra shown in Fig. 8. The595
total β intensity Iβ is obtained from summation of the two dis-
tributions Iβγ and Iβn with the proper normalization, 1 − Pn and
Pn respectively. This intensity distribution can be used as input
for a Geant4 simulation to determine the average β efficiency ε̄β
which is shown in Table 4. As can be observed the dependency600
on the nucleus concerned is very small, a maximum variation of
half-a-percent with respect to the average. This was expected
from the large values of the average end-point energy for the
decay Qβ − 〈Ex〉Iβ also shown in Table 4.

A comment on the accuracy of β intensity distributions is per-605
tinent at this point. Intensity distributions coming from high-
resolution spectroscopy are often affected by systematic errors,
as a consequence of the limited efficiency of germanium detec-
tors. Gamma rays de-exciting high energy levels can be easily
missed or cannot be placed in the level scheme. This leads to an610
incomplete and distorted level scheme with too much intensity
assigned to levels at low excitation energy. This can be clearly
seen in the case of the decay of 94Rb where the ENSDF data
evaluation [35] locates only 66% of Iβγ. Total absorption spec-
troscopy with large 4π scintillation detectors gives the correct615
intensity distribution. Indeed the TAGS result for 94Rb [49]
places considerable intensity at high-excitation energy. In spite
of that the calculated average β efficiency does not change sig-
nificantly.

Summarizing, the corrections due to the energy distribution620
of neutrons and β particles on the ratio ε̄β/ε̄n for the measured
isotopes are very small and do not add much to the systematic
uncertainty of the result.

From the four isotopes, 137I is the one with the largest rela-
tive uncertainty on the Pn value. According to the evaluation625
of Ref. [39] the uncertainty amounts to 5.2% (see Table 1 and
Fig. 7). We can use the Pn values for the other three isotopes to
obtain an improved estimate of the β-delayed neutron emission
probability for this important β-delayed neutron precursor. 137I
is one of the single largest contributors to the delayed neutron630
fraction in a reactor. The ratio ε̄β/ε̄n determined with the ex-

clusion of 137I is 0.508(8), only marginally different from the
number given above. With this ratio we determine a more accu-
rate neutron emission probability Pn = 7.76(14)% for 137I. As
was explained in Section 4 the measurement for this isotope is635
affected by the escape of the daughter nuclei from the implanta-
tion tape. This introduces a systematic uncertainty on the num-
ber of β counts Nβ related to the modeling of this effect in the fit
function. However this uncertainty is very small. 137Xe decay
is the only significant additional contribution to the growth and640
decay curve (see Fig. 5). Since the half-life of the daughter is
nine times longer than the parent half-life, the contribution is
small during the first part of the measuring cycle. Restricting
the fit of β counts in Fig. 5 up to the end of the implantation
period (73 s), and removing the loss term from the fit function,645
we obtain a number of counts in the full cycle Nβ which differs
only by 0.4% from the value given in Table 2. We assume that
this difference gives the magnitude of the xenon loss systematic
error and include it in the quoted uncertainty given above. Our
new determination of 137I Pn value has thus an uncertainty of650
1.8%.

gives us the oppor-
tunity to verify the accuracy of β efficiencies obtained from670
Geant4 simulations in the region of strong variation. This is
important not only for estimating the corrections in the coin-
cidence method of Pn determination but in other types of de-
cay measurements, that also require β tagging. In particular the
TAGS technique [49], where the coincidence with the β par-675
ticle eliminates the huge background in the large scintillation
detector thus facilitating the measurement of rare isotopes. De-
termining accurately the β intensity distribution close to the Q-
value depends critically on our knowledge of the β efficiency
curve. In order to compare with the measurement we have gen-680
erated β events from the Iβn distribution assuming an allowed

β shape. Figure 11 compares the experimental and simulated
energy spectrum registered in the Si detector. It is remarkable
that the simulation is able to reproduce the shapes, distinct for
each isotope, which are sensitive to the details of the β inten-685
sity distributions. The integral values are compared in Fig. 10.
The MC simulation has been scaled down by a factor of 0.806
to match, on average, the experimental values. The simulation
was performed assuming that the implantation position was at
the centre of the tape. As was mentioned above, part of the690
beam was deposited on the supporting structure, which stopped
the β particles, thus the effective efficiency was 20% smaller
than the nominal value. Apart from this geometrical factor the
simulation reproduces the tendency of the measured values to
better than 4.5%. The scaled values are shown in Table 4.695

6. Summary and conclusions

We have described a new β-neutron counting system for the
measurement of β-delayed neutron emission probabilities. The
setup is adapted for measurements at on-line mass separators.
The neutron counter uses twenty 3He tubes distributed inside700
a large polyethylene neutron moderator. A thin Si detector is
used as β counter. A novelty of the apparatus is the use of a
self-triggered digital data acquisition system with small acqui-
sition dead time. The time and energy for every detector signal
are stored for subsequent analysis. This allows a flexible re-705
construction of events and full control of experimental issues
in the data. The characterization of the counting system was
performed using fission products with well known β-delayed
neutron emission properties: 88Br, 94Rb, 95Rb and 137I. The ra-
tio of β to neutron detection efficiencies for this setup, which710
is the parameter used for the determination of Pn values, was
determined with an uncertainty of 1.6%. This allowed us to im-
prove the Pn for the important β-delayed neutron precursor 137I.
Our new value is (7.76 ± 0.14)%.

We studied the effect of β and neutron energy distributions715
on the average detection efficiencies. They can introduce a sys-
tematic error in the determination of Pn values. We used Geant4

10



MC simulations to quantify the effect. For the method of inde-
pendent β and neutron counting we found that the corrections
are very small for the four isotopes investigated. To a large ex-720
tent this is related to the strong energy dependence of the Fermi
rate function which leads to large average β end-point energies
and small average neutron energies. In the general case, the
corrections can be important for decays where the β intensity
distribution concentrates at very high excitation energies, due to725
nuclear structure, and/or onto few levels, as can happen for light
nuclei or close to shell closures. The situation is quite different
for the β-neutron coincidence counting method. The inevitable
noise discrimination threshold in the β counter leads to a strong
efficiency variation with end-point energy in the upper part of730
the decay window. Thus the average efficiency for detecting
a β particle in coincidence with a neutron can be very differ-
ent from the average efficiency for detecting any β particle. The
effect is exacerbated when the window for neutron emission de-
creases. We observed a 25% difference between 137I and 94Rb735
or 95Rb. This would have been the magnitude of the systematic
error if this effect is ignored. On the other hand we found that
Geant4 simulations are able to reproduce the isotope depen-
dency of the neutron-gated β efficiency within 4.5%. Likewise
Geant4, with the corrected thermal neutron treatment in version740
10.0 and later versions, was able to reproduce the neutron de-
tection efficiency of a calibrated 252Cf source within 3.5%. This
confirms the suitability of Geant4 to quantify systematic correc-
tions to the Pn value coming from the dependency of efficiency
with energy. However to evaluate these corrections one needs745
information on the β intensity distribution and the neutron en-
ergy spectrum. For the cases where this information is missing
an estimate of the corrections can be obtained from theoretical
calculations of the intensity distribution or from some reason-
able assumption about this distribution.750
