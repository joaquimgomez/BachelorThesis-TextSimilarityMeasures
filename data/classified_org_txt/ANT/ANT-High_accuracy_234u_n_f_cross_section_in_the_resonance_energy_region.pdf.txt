Abstract. New results are presented of the 234U neutron-induced fission cross section, obtained with high
accuracy in the resonance region by means of two methods using the 235U(n,f) as reference. The recent
evaluation of the 235U(n,f) obtained with SAMMY by L. C. Leal et al. (these Proceedings), based on previous
n TOF data [1], has been used to calculate the 234U(n,f) cross section through the 234U/235U ratio, being here
compared with the results obtained by using the n TOF neutron flux.

1. Introduction
The 234U isotope is present in the uranium-enriched
fuel of current reactors and is also produced during the
thorium-fuel cycle. Because of its relatively low (n,f) cross
section, data found in current nuclear databases could be
sufficient for a first evaluation of critical reactors as well
as for Accelerator Driven Systems. Nevertheless, a detailed
assessment of relevant integral reactor quantities requires
a more precise and complete set of basic nuclear data
for this important isotope. Experimental datasets available
in EXFOR as well as data in the evaluated libraries [2]
show discrepancies. The ENDF/B-VII.1 and JENDL-4.0
evaluations are shifted in energy and some resonances
are missing in one of the two databases. In the Resolved
Resonance Region (RRR), both evaluations are based on
the experimental data of James et al. [3], but JENDL-4.0
includes also the resonance parameters provided by Dridi
et al. [4] for the capture reaction and the fission cross
section of Heyse et al. [5] for the 5.17 eV resonance. Above
1.5 keV, in the Unresolved Resonance Region (URR),
the fission data of James et al. and the capture data of
Pennington were used in ENDF/B-VII.1 whereas JENDL-
4.0 used the experimental data sets mentioned in Ref. [2].
The 234U(n,f) cross section data presented in this work, in
the neutron energy range from 3 eV up to 10 MeV, have
been measured at the Neutron Time-of-Flight (n TOF)
facility at CERN with an improved detection setup based
on Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters (PPACs).

2. The experimental setup
The 234U(n,f) cross section was measured in 2012 during
the so-called Phase-II at the CERN-n TOF facility [6]
using ten PPACs consisting of one central anode with
a very fast signal (time resolution ∼500 ps) and two
segmented cathodes, used to measure the two coordinates
of the fission fragment (FF) hit [7]. The targets, which
consisted of thin radioactive layers electrodeposited on an
aluminium foil, were interleaved with ten PPAC detectors.
The data here presented correspond to three 234U and two
235U targets. The thickness of the Al backing was 2.0 µm
for the 234U and one 235U and 0.7 µm for the second
235U target. There was a slight isotopic contamination
in the 235U targets of 234U (0.74%), 236U (0.27%) and
238U (6.28%), as well as a 235U (0.077%) content in the
234U targets, which has been subtracted during the data
analysis.

The n TOF spallation target in previous PPAC
experiments, performed during the Phase-I [1,8] used
normal water as the neutron moderator, which was
changed to borated water in the last campaign of Phase-
II when the data presented in this work have been taken.
Important differences in the neutron flux are observed

below hundreds of eV depending on the type of moderator
material [9].

The PPAC configuration was also modified in Phase-II.
The detectors and targets were tilted by 45◦ with respect
to the neutron beam direction in order to reach up to 90◦
angular acceptance of the FF detection compared to the 60◦
achieved with the perpendicular setup used in Phase-I, see
Ref. [7] for details.

3. Data analysis and results
The fission cross section (σ ) is related to the number of
detected fission events (C) per unit of incident neutron
energy (En) by:

C(En)x = σ (En)x · �(En) · Nx · � (1)
where � is the neutron fluence, � is the detection efficiency
and N is the areal density of a target (x) of radius R.

3.1. 235U(n,f) cross section

As the neutron fluence received by the targets during the
experiment is not accurately known, the 235U(n,f) has
been used as a reference in the 234U(n,f) cross section
calculation. However, the n TOF neutron flux shape was
known [10] and was normalised with Eq. (1) using the
235U(n,f) cross section area of 246.4 ± 1.2 b · eV given by
the IAEA in the neutron energy interval from 7.8 to 11 eV
as explained in Ref. [1].

The 235U(n,f) cross section, obtained as the mean value
of both 235U targets, is compared in Fig. 1 with the recent
evaluation presented in this conference by L. C. Leal et
al., based on the data of Paradela et al. [1], and with
the ENDF/B-VII.1 database. The averaged integral cross
sections, calculated with the Analysis of Geel Spectrum
(AGS) code [11], are provided in Table 1 where the ratios
of the n TOF data to those in each column are given in
parentheses for different energy regions.

3.2. 234U(n,f) cross section

The 234U(n,f) cross section is calculated in this work
by means of two methods, both based on the fact that
all targets receive the same neutron flux and assuming
that the efficiency of all detectors is the same within the
uncertainties we are dealing with. With the first method
(n TOF1), the 235U(n,f) cross section obtained in the
previous subsection has been used as a reference. The
normalisation factor is inversely proportional to N5 · � so,
assuming that the efficiency is the same for all detectors,
we can get the 234U(n,f) cross section via the relation
between the areal densities of the samples given by:

N4 = N5 ·
m4 · M5
m5 · M4

Figure 1. 235U(n,f) cross section data. The dashed vertical lines
correspond to the normalisation limits.

The second method (n TOF2) is based on the ratio of the
number of fission events obtained for the 234U and 235U
samples, using the 235U(n,f) cross section evaluated by
L.C. Leal et al., with Eq. (1), where the neutron flux and
the efficiency cancel.

The cross section obtained by the first method is
compared in Fig. 2 with the experimental data provided
by EXFOR and with the ENDF/B-VII.1 and JENDL-4.0
evaluations. The data presented in this work have better
resolution than the others, being closer to the previous
n TOF data measured by Paradela et al. [8]. A slight
energy offset is observed between the ENDF/B-VII.1 and
JENDL-4.0 evaluations in addition to differences in the
cross sections. This energy shift is also observed between
the evaluations and the experimental data, being more
pronounced in the case of the JENDL-4.0 database.

Above the RRR some groups of fission resonances are
observed in the experimental data, which are not evaluated
in the databases, as can be seen in Fig. 3.

The averaged integral cross sections calculated with
both methods are given in Table 2 for different energy
regions, compared with Paradela et al., ENDF/B-VII.1 and
JENDL-4.0. The ratios of the first column data over the
values in the other columns are given in parentheses. On

is observed in the present data, having a shape very close

to the previous n TOF data in [8]. Huge discrepancies
have been found in the cross sections and energies with
the evaluations in the ENDF/B-VII.1 and JENDL-4.0
libraries.

The averaged integral cross section ratios given in
parentheses in Table 2 are shown in Fig. 4, differing
by factors of 0.5 to 5. It is worth to mention the
good agreement between both experimental methods,
the difference of −18% with respect to Paradela et al.
[8] and the severe disagreement with the evaluated
libraries.
