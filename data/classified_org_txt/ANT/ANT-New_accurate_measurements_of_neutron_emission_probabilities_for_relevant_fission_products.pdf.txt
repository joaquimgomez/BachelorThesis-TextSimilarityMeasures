Abstract. We have performed new accurate measurements of the beta-delayed neutron emission probability
for ten isotopes of the elements Y, Sb, Te and I. These are fission products that either have a significant
contribution to the fraction of delayed neutrons in reactors or are relatively close to the path of the
astrophysical r process. The measurements were performed with isotopically pure radioactive beams using a
constant and high efficiency neutron counter and a low noise beta detector. Preliminary results are presented
for six of the isotopes and compared with previous measurements and theoretical calculations.

1. Introduction
Beta delayed neutron emission occurs for neutron-rich
nuclei when the neutron separation energy in the daughter
nucleus Sn becomes smaller than the energy window
for the decay Qβ . For decays proceeding to excited
levels above Sn , neutron emission competes efficiently
with the electromagnetic de-excitation. Under the common
assumption that �γ /�n ≈ 0 the probability of neutron
emission Pn is just the integral of the β-intensity
distribution Iβ(Ex ) in the interval [Sn , Qβ]. Therefore the
rate of delayed neutron emission is sensitive to nuclear
structure. In general as the neutron excess increases so
does Pn until eventually it becomes the dominant decay
mode.

Delayed neutrons are produced in nuclear power
reactors in the decay of some fission products. Although
they are a small fraction (less than one percent) of the total
neutron inventory, they play a dominant role in reactor
control. The effective delayed neutron fraction βe f f ,
modulates the change of reactor power to sudden changes
of the reactor reactivity coefficient ρ (which measures the
departure from criticality [1]). This allows inter alia the
safe insertion and extraction of absorption control rods.
The delayed neutron fraction βe f f is thus an important
reactor parameter which must be known with good
accuracy. This parameter is obtained from measurements
of specific fissioning systems (integral measurements). It

can be obtained also from summation calculations which
require the knowledge of fission yields Y and β-delayed
neutron emission probabilities Pn of individual precursors.
The advantage of the latter method is that it can be applied
to systems for which no integral data exists. However
summation calculations do not attain currently the level
of accuracy necessary to replace the conventional method.
Although this is mainly due to uncertainties in the yields Y ,
the improvement of the current knowledge of Pn values for
selected isotopes can have an impact on the calculations.
In addition, from comparison of summation calculations
and integral measurements, constraints on uncertain fission
yields could be established. Currently, the discrepancies
between calculated βe f f and integral measurements (up to
10%) result in an undesirable conservatism in the design
and operation of reactor control systems [2]. Moreover
new requirements are emerging in reactor technology
because of the use of high burn-up fuels or the burning
of minor actinides where the fission product inventory
differs from that of conventional reactors. Thus improved
measurements on delayed neutron emission probabilities
for selected isotopes will contribute to the reduction in the
uncertainties in this area.

Delayed neutrons also play a role in the synthesis of
elements heavier than iron in the Universe through the
astrophysical r process. The r process is associated with
the occurrence of huge instantaneous fluxes of neutrons
which through a succession of rapid neutron captures and
β decays builds up very neutron-rich nuclei up to the
heaviest possible elements. The nuclei along this so called

r process pathway will decay towards the line of stability
by a series of β decays, accompanied by the emission
of delayed neutrons in the case of the most neutron-rich
isotopes. The delayed neutron emission process alters the
mass distribution created initially, by shifting the decay
path to lower masses on the one hand, and by providing
additional neutrons for late captures on the other hand,
which smooth and shift the final distribution to higher
masses [3]. Therefore a knowledge of Pn , particularly for
the most exotic nuclei, is an important ingredient in the
calculation of the abundance of the elements either because
they have a direct use or because they help to improve beta-
strength based Pn theoretical estimations for those isotopes
that are out of experimental reach.

We mentioned before that the value of Pn is sensitive
to the structure of the daughter and parent nuclei and
therefore its measurement is also a tool in nuclear structure
investigation. But this, in turn, is also important in the
context of calculations of the r process, which often have
to rely on theoretical models to obtain the decay properties,
including the half-life T1/2 of many of the nuclei involved,
which are not yet accessible to experimentation. The
predictive power of these models can be improved if they
are confronted with both T1/2 and Pn values sensitive to
different parts of the β-intensity distribution.

We have performed a sensitivity study to select
precursors that contribute appreciably to the delayed
neutron fraction in reactors and have a relatively uncertain
Pn value, that are candidates for improved measurements.
The selection was completed with isotopes that are
relatively close to the astrophysical r process path. In
a previous measurement [4] we studied a number of
isotopes from this list. Now a new measurement has been
performed and data was taken for a total of ten isotopes
of the elements Y, Sb, Te and I. The measurement and the
analysis method will be described and preliminary results
for six of the isotopes will be presented and discussed.

2. Experimental apparatus
Measurements were performed at the IGISOL-IV mass
separator [5] installed at the Cyclotron Laboratory of the
University of Jyväskylä (JYFL) producing a broad range
of isotopes from proton-induced Ep = 25 MeV fission of
a U target inside the ion source. After mass separation
of the ion beam with a moderate mass resolving power,
the isotope of interest is isolated from accompanying
isobars by means of a double Penning trap system [6]. The
extracted beam shows high isotope purity provided that
the isobars have a large mass difference with respect to
the selected isotope in comparison to the trap frequency
width, which was the case. The beam is implanted on a
movable tape after traveling inside a 1 mm thick aluminum
vacuum tube with a diameter of 46 mm. The beam gate is
open for a time length of three half-lives. Data acquisition
starts 1–2 seconds before the gate is open and lasts for
a total of ten half-lives. The tape we used is a standard
half-inch computer tape with the magnetic layer facing
the beam. We mounted on the tube end-cap a 3 mm thick
plastic scintillation detector placed 6 mm behind the tape
in order to count β particles emitted by the implanted ion.

The beam tube goes through the central hole of the
neutron counter reaching the center of the detector. The
version of the neutron counter BELEN [7] used in this

measurement consists of forty eight 3He proportional
tubes arranged in three concentric rings inside a large
polyethylene block (see Fig. 1). The rings have six,
twelve and thirty tubes respectively. The central hole has
a diameter of 11 cm able to accommodate a large HPGe
detector for γ -ray counting. The spatial disposition of
the tubes was optimized using MCNPX [8] Monte Carlo
simulations in order to maximize the total detection
efficiency having at the same time a nearly constant
value up to 3 MeV (see Fig. 2). The 1-inch tubes were
fabricated by LND Inc. [9] and have pressures of 8 or
10 atmospheres.

The β plastic detector is optically coupled with a
Plexiglas light guide to a segmented photomultiplier tube
R7600U-M4 from Hamamatsu. The signals coming from
each half of the PMT anode are connected to a coincidence
unit that cancels out the noise of individual segments and
allows to set a low threshold (50 keV). The signals from
the 3He tubes are fed to four MPR-16-HV charge sensitive
preamplifiers modules from Mesytec. The differential
output signals from the MPR-16-HV are converted into
single-ended with a home-made converter (designed at
JYFL), and plugged to the SIS3316 [10] sampling ADC of
the Gasi f ic data acquisition system where each channel is
running in self-triggered mode registering time-stamp and
signal amplitude for each detected neutron [7].

3. Determination of Pn values
To determine Pn we use two different approaches
depending on the collected neutron statistics. In one case
we use the ratio of neutron counts to the number of β
counts (Eq. (1)) while in the other case we use the ratio
of neutron-β correlations to the number of β particles
(Eq. (2)), in both cases corrected by efficiencies [7]

The advantage of Eq. (2) is that it can be applied for a
very few number of detected decays because the β-neutron
coincidence condition effectively suppress the neutron
background. A disadvantage of this approach is the need
to determine the average β efficiencies for all decays (ε̄β)

and for decays to states above Sn (ε̄

β). However for decays

with a large Qβn = Qβ − Sn window both efficiencies will
be very similar [7] and they will cancel out.

In the case of Eq. (1) in order to obtain Nn and Nβ
we fit simultaneously the time evolution of the neutron
counting rate (Fig. 3) and the β counting rate (Fig. 4).
The value of the efficiency ratio ε̄β/ε̄n = 0.816(33) was
obtained from 95Rb, a well know nucleus. This ratio shows
little sensitivity to Qβ and Sn [7] thus can be applied
to the remaining isotopes. Since the fit function depends
on Pn itself, we use an iterative procedure to obtain the
value. The fit function corresponds to the appropriate
solution of the Bateman equation and allows disentangling
the contributions of the precursor and its descendants.
This method is applied to obtain Pn values for

135Sb and
138,139,140I. For the iodine isotopes the fit function includes
a loss factor for the daughter isotopes (xenon) which can
escape rapidly from the implantation tape in a similar
fashion as we did before for 137I [7].

In the case of Eq. (2) we assume cancellation of
β efficiencies and determine Nβn from the time corre-
lation distribution (Fig. 5) after background subtraction
(determined from the positive part of the plot). We
use a neutron efficiency ε̄n = 38.5(16)%, determined
experimentally from 95Rb, that agrees well with the Monte
Carlo simulation (see Fig. 2). The advantage of the β-n
method to extract Pn in the case of

138Te becomes apparent
when comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 5. For similar reasons it
was also applied to 137Te which has even lower statistics.

4. Results and discussion
The preliminary Pn values obtained in this work are
given in Table 1 and in graphical form in Fig. 6. These
are compared with the result of previous evaluations

by Rudstam et al. (RAS) [11] and by Pfeiffer et al.
(PKM) [12] as well as with three theoretical calculations.
The calculations are those from Moeller et al. (FRDM-
QRPA) [13], Koura et al. (KTUY-GT2) [14] and Marketin
et al. (RHB-RQRPA) [15]. These are global calculations,
covering the whole nuclide chart, suited for r process
abundance calculations.

Compared to previous evaluations (RAS and PKM)
our results are slightly larger (10–15%) for 135Sb and
slightly lower (5–15%) for 138I and 139I. For 140I the
PKM evaluated value has a large uncertainty (44%) and
is 56% larger than the RAS evaluation, which has a 7%
uncertainty. Our result is 17% lower than the value in RAS.
For these four isotopes the relative uncertainty (statistical)
of our results is about 4%. In the case of 137Te our result is
more uncertain (12%) and is slightly lower (10–15%) than
both evaluations. In the case of 138Te there exist a single
previous measurement [16] with a large uncertainty (33%)
quoted in both evaluations. Our result has an uncertainty
(statistical) of 5% and is 25% smaller than the previous
value. Although with marginal statistics (see Fig. 3) the Pn
value obtained using Eq. (1) agrees well with the quoted
value obtained with Eq. (2). The half-life for 138Te T1/2 =
1.4(4) s has also a relatively large uncertainty. In our fit this
half-life was left as a free parameter obtaining in this way
an improved estimate of T1/2 = 1.412(18) s.

Comparing the theoretical calculations to the data one
observes (Fig. 6) that all three models reproduce the
isotopic trend (position of maxima and minima). However
the RHB-RQRPA values are strongly suppressed (by a
factor of 5 to 8) with respect to the experiment. The
FRDM-QRPA model agrees with experiment within a
factor of 2 for 135Sb, 138I and 137Te, overpredicts the
values of 139,140I by a factor of 3–4 and underpredicts
the value of 138Te by a factor of 3. The KTUY-GT2

model predicts fairly well the Pn values of the antimony
and iodine isotopes but underpredict the values for the
tellurium isotopes by a factor of 6.

5. Conclusion
We have obtained accurate Pn values for

135Sb, 138,139,140I
and 137,138Te. In particular for 140I and 138Te our data
represent a significant improvement with respect to
previous values. We found that the theoretical calculations
of Ref. [15] grossly underpredict all the experimental
values. The calculations of Ref. [13] differ significantly
from experiment for 139,140I and 138Te. The calculations
of Ref. [14] agree well with experiment except for the
tellurium isotopes.
