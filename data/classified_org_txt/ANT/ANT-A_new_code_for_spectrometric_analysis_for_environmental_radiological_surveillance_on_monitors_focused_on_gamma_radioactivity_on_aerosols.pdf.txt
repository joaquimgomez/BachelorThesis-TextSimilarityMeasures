Abstract—This paper presents a new code for the analy-7
sis of gamma spectra generated by an equipment for con-8
tinuous measurement of gamma radioactivity in aerosols with9
paper filter. It is called pGamma and has been developed10
by the Nuclear Engineering Research Group at the Technical11
University of Catalonia - Barcelona Tech and by Raditel Serveis i12
Subministraments Tecnològics, Ltd. The code has been developed13
to identify the gamma emitters and to determine their activ-14
ity concentration. It generates alarms depending on the activity15
of the emitters and elaborates reports. Therefore it includes a16
library with NORM and artificial emitters of interest. The code is17
being adapted to the monitors of the Environmental Radiological18
Surveillance Network of the local Catalan Government in Spain19
(Generalitat de Catalunya) and is used at three stations of the20
Network.21

I. INTRODUCTION24

T HE use of monitors with spectrometric capability in25 environmental radiological surveillance networks pro-26
vides additional information that complements the ambi-27

group (Nuclear Engineering Research Group) at the Technical29
University of Catalonia - Barcelona Tech and Raditel Serveis30
i Subministraments Tecnològics, Ltd. have developed an31
equipment for continuous measurement and identification of32
gamma radioactivity in aerosols with paper filter. Gamma33
spectrum analysis allows the identification and determina-34
tion of activity concentration of radiation sources. Excellent35

CANBERRA). Nevertheless, it is generic software not intended 38
for automatic analysis since each individual analysis must 39
be conducted by a specialised technician. For this reason, 40
our research group has developed a spectrometric analysis 41
code specifically designed for the above equipment. This 42
code is being used at stations with aerosol monitors on 43
the Environmental Radiological Surveillance Network of the 44
Generalitat de Catalunya (local Catalan Government), Spain1: 45
Three monitors are currently fully operative: two in the surveil- 46
lance station of the Ascó and Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plants 47
(both in the province of Tarragona, Spain), and one in the 48
Engineering School of Barcelona, Spain. Two new monitors 49
will shortly be deployed in Roses (province of Girona) and in 50
Puigcerdà (province of Barcelona). The code has been adapted 51
for the analysis of gamma spectra generated by other moni- 52
tors with spectrometric capability of the Network, i.e. river and 53
direct air monitors. We are starting the tuning of these versions 54
of the code on the monitors for river and direct air. 55

The code, called pGamma, discriminates spectrum informa- 56
tion, identifies emitters appearing on the spectrum, determines 57
activity concentration in Bq/m3 and generates alarms accord- 58
ing to its calculated values. It has a normal operation mode and 59
special operation mode for spectra obtained during energy cal- 60
ibration of the equipment. Additionally, another mode called 61
investigation, is set when the variation in the total number of 62
counts exceeds a certain level, or when a full energy peak is not 63
identified. 64

The code input is an ASCII text file with the number of 65
counts per channel of the spectrum and a header with informa- 66
tion about measurement conditions: date and time of counting 67
initiation and termination, live time, air flow, operation mode, 68
the parameters of the energy calibration curve, etc. Fig. 1 is 69
a general operation diagram of pGamma in normal operation 70
mode. 71

The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the 72
treatment of the peaks in the spectrum. In Section III, efficiency 73
calibration is presented. The determination procedure of activ- 74
ity concentration is shown in Section IV. Section V describes 75
the identification of 131I. In Section VI, the action levels are 76

Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VIII.78

II. PEAK TREATMENT79

The first step in the analysis of the spectrum is the treatment80
of the peaks: the searching of possible peaks on the spectrum81
and its identification.82

A. Peak Search83

Peak search and analysis is performed after the input spec-84
trum is smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay method [1]. The85
smoothing algorithm allows the first, second and third deriva-86
tives of the spectrum to be obtained. The first derivative is used87
to determine the local maximums, which are subjected to a sta-88
tistical test to discriminate real centrer of peaks (centroids) from89
spurious transitions. The nearest relative maximums of the first90
derivative at both sides of the centroid, indicate the channel of91
the peak boundaries. Using the second and the third derivate,92
single peaks are discriminated from multiplets. With the cen-93
troid and the boundaries of the peaks, the net area and the94
background are determined. The last step is the fitting of each95
peaks to a Gaussian curve. It allows the determination of the full96
width at half maximum (FWHM) and perform the chi-square97
test for further discrimination. With this information, pGamma98
generates a first list of possible peaks with their characteris-99
tics. The calculated parameters are centroid, lower and upper100
boundaries of the possible peak, full width at half maximum,101
gross area and net area.102

B. Peak Identification103

1) Energy Calibration: The use of energy calibration104
makes it possible to state the centroid, FWHM and limits105
of peaks in energy units instead of number of channels. The106
relationship between energy and adopted number of channel is:107

E = a+ bC + cC2 (1)

Where C is the channel and a, b and c are the parameters of the108
calibration curve. Energy calibration must be performed prior109
to installation of equipment in a station.110

2) Peak Identification: Peaks can be identified using the 111
library of gamma emitters of interest included in the code. 112
This library has been created by us using information from [2]. 113
For aerosol equipment, these emitters are the NORM radionu- 114
clides (238U-222Rn series, 232Th-220Rn series, 40K and 7Be) 115
and artificial emitters from nuclear power plant discharges 116
(e.g. radio-iodines, 137Cs, 134Cs and 132Te) or industrial appli- 117
cations. Information about emitters includes energy and the 118
emission probability of emitted gamma rays, empirical thresh- 119
olds for NORM emitters to decide if pGamma must switch to 120
investigation mode and derived concentration limits in the air. 121

The centroid energy of each peak is compared with the 122
energy of gamma emitters. For similar values, the emitters are 123
considered candidates for that peak and a list of candidates 124
is generated. To identify a set of peaks with a radionuclide 125
with multiple gamma emissions, the ratio between intensity 126
of detected gammas and total intensity of the gammas of the 127
emitter in the library is used. The relationship between the 128
members of 238U-222Rn series and 232Th-220Rn series is con- 129
sidered too. pGamma cannot determine activity concentration 130
of unidentified peaks. 131

III. DETECTION EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION 132

In order to determine activity concentration, the code needs 133
information about the detection efficiency. Since the factors 134
integrating the detection efficiency are very difficult to deter- 135
mine due to a complex geometry and a wide range of possible 136
energies, efficiency calibration must be performed. First, the 137
same geometry of the paper filter (source), detector and detec- 138
tion volume of the equipment during normal operation must 139
be reproduced. This implies preparing a calibration source 140
by shaping it into a disc with the same diameter of aerosols 141
retained on the filter, and the same self-absorption (negligi- 142
ble) and gamma emitters of several energies in the range from 143
100 keV to 2000 keV. In consequence, the analytical determi- 144
nation of efficiency is cumbersome. The solution consists in 145
using a calibration source with similar characteristics to the 146
source to be measured and determining efficiency from experi- 147
mental values. To ensure unbiased calibration, the calibration 148
source should be identical to the radioactive samples in all 149
aspects affecting detection [3]. If no calibration source is avail- 150
able or more points are required for adjusting the efficiency 151
curve, Monte Carlo n-Particle (MCNP5, version 2.6.0) provide 152
a further possibility for calculating the detector efficiency. 153

We used simulated 131I and commercial 60Co sources 154
(Table I) with similar geometry and materials to those of the 155
impregnated filter of the monitor. The simulated 131I source 156
is composed of two radioisotopes: 133Ba and 137Cs. The com- 157
bination of both emitters generates a gamma energy spectrum 158
whose full energy peaks have centroids and a relationship of 159
areas very similar to the 131I spectrum. The simulated 131I 160
source has the same area as the impregnated filter. The emitter 161
material is deposited on a polymeric membrane with a stainless 162
steel backing of 0.762 mm thickness and an 0.9 mg/cm2 alu- 163
minized mylar window. Gamma absorption of the window and 164
the backscattering on the back of the membrane are negligible. 165
Therefore, it can be considered that the material and geometry 166

of the source have the same behaviour as the impregnated paper167
filter. To simulate the detector response on the MCNP5 sim-168
ulation we had used the FWHM obtained from the peaks on169
the spectra for the calibration sources (131I and 60Co) with the170
experimental setup. The function used is:171

FWHM = 0.008 + 0.013·
√
E + 0.593·E2 (2)

where E is the energy in MeV and the FWHM obtained is also172
in MeV.173

Experimental efficiencies were obtained by analyzing the174
experimental spectra of 131I and 60Co by pGamma. Before the175
calculation of the efficiency, the net counts of the experimental176
peaks had to be compensated by a correction factor. The source177
capsule elevated the membrane where the radioactive material178
is deposited such that the membrane is slightly higher than the179
paper filter (about 0.283 cm). Assuming that both sources, the180
impregnated paper filter in normal operation and the calibration181
source, are discs and the detector window is a disc too (geome-182
try on Fig. 2), we could determine the geometric factor in both183
cases using the following expansion in power series:184

133Ba, which are treated as two separate sources. 198

equations (6) and (7) we find the values of εd on Table II. A 204
second efficiency curve, obtained from MCNP5, is compared 205
with that obtained from experimental values, Fig. 3. As can 206
be seen, the two curves are very close, with the exception of 207
experimental efficiency for 380 keV. By fitting the experimen- 208
tal points without considering the 380 keV experimental value, 209
efficiency is: 210

Since Monte Carlo methods were used to complement the211
experimental values to obtain the efficiency curve, the equip-212
ment simulation model must be benchmarked. In fact, without213
the geometry correction, Fig. 3 itself could be a validation of214
the Monte Carlo simulations. It is interesting to analyze and215
compare the experimental and Monte Carlo simulated spec-216
tra of the equipment with the calibration source instead of the217
paper filter. As the sources were very close to the front win-218
dow of the detector, some true coincidence summing peaks219
appeared on the spectrum. These cannot be reproduced with220
a single MCNP5 simulation, but as we want to compare the221
procedure used to obtain the efficiency curve and these sum222
peaks are not required for the efficiency calculations, we will223
not simulate them. Fig. 4 compares simulated and experimen-224
tal 60Co and simulated source of 131I spectra. The simulation225
reproduces perfectly the processes that not depend on the226
electronic instrumentation modules. As can be seen, backscat-227

full energy peaks appear. The differences between both spectra 229
are due to the fact that background radiation is not simulated. 230
Intrinsic radiation from the LaBr3(Ce) scintillator, i.e.

138La 231
and 138La plus X-rays peaks at 1468 keV, appears in the experi- 232
mental spectrum. This component was not simulated, but is not 233
relevant for efficiency calibration. Moreover, at low energies 234
the simulated spectrum has fewer counts than the experimental 235
one. This is because the Monte Carlo model does not simulate 236
the background radiation components of cosmic rays or earth’ s 237
NORMs, resulting in fewer X-rays on the lead shielding (peak 238
near 80 keV in the spectrum). In our model, only X-rays from 239
absorption of the calibration source radiation are generated. 240
Again, this is not important for efficiency calculation. 241

Since the simulated 131I has many peaks at low energies, the 242
effect of sum peaks is more noticeable, at least in our energy 243
range (0-2048 keV). Monte Carlo does not generate sum peaks, 244
as can be seen in Fig. 4. For full energy peaks with little or no 245
influence of sum peaks, simulation results are good. Table III 246
compares the net areas of full energy peaks of simulated and 247
experimental spectra. Peaks influenced by a sum peak are not 248
used in efficiency calibration. 249

IV. DETERMINATION OF THE ACTIVITY CONCENTRATION 250

After identification of gamma emitters in the spectrum, the 251
spectrometric analysis system determines their specific activity 252
in the air Ãa, expressed in Bq/m

3, according to the net area of 253
the most efficient emitter of the isotope. However, the obtained 254
spectrum corresponds to the number of counts caused by the 255
radionuclide concentration on the filter, which is different from 256
the radionuclide concentration in the air. Because the activity on 257
the filter Af is proportional to the number of captured atoms, 258
a balance of activity can be performed in the same way as for 259
concentration. The radionuclide concentration of an analysed 260
emitter on the filter at a certain time depends on three factors: 261
1) the number of captured atoms of this emitter; 2) decays of 262
the parent nuclei of this emitter, and 3) decays of this emitter. 263

Activity on the filter Af is proportional to activity in the air 264
Ãa, air flow Q, and retention efficiency of the filter εf [4], [5]. 265
Nevertheless, as activity on the filter implies a balance of matter 266
on the filter, concentration of each radionuclide depends on its 267



DE BLAS et al.: A NEW CODE FOR SPECTROMETRIC ANALYSIS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE 5

position in the decay series. In the case of aerosol equipment,268
the radionuclides are belonging to the 238U-222Rn series, the269
232Th-220Rn (chiefly 212Pb, 212Bi and 208Tl) series or to none270
of the series. A slightly different statement is required for each271
case.272

A. Radionuclides not Belonging to a Series273

Most artificial emitters fall in this category. The balance of274
matter in this case is simply:275

dAf

= Qεf Ãa(0)− λiAf (9)

Equation (9) can be solved by integration and as result the filter276

Where λi is the decay constant for radionuclide i, Ni the net280

probable gamma of radionuclide i, T the detection time (live282
time fo the Multiple Channel Analyzer), Q the average air-283
flow, εf the filter efficiency, εd the detection efficiency for the284
most probable gamma of radionuclide i, and νi the emission285
probability of the most probable gamma of radionuclide i.286

B. 238U−222Rn Series287
The gamma emitters in the air of interest belonging to the288

Numbers in parenthesis in the chain (12) represent the nomen-290
clature used for the radionuclides in the following equations.291
These radionuclides are present on all countings because they292
come from the earth and surrounding buildings. Among them293
we can find some gamma emitters of certain importance, mainly294
214Pb and 214Bi. The equations of balance of matter for chain295

218Po reaches its equilibrium at 95% in 13 minutes. By com-297

paring the partial time of detection of 1 h and the total time of298
detection of 24 h, the hypothesis that 218Po and 214Pb are in299
equilibrium in the air can be supported.300

Ãa1(0) = Ãa2(0) (14)

By considering the equilibrium condition Eq. (14) and devel- 301

C. 232Th- 220Rn Series 309

(17)

These radionuclides are always present in air aspiration, like 312
in the previous series. Among them, 212Pb, 212Bi and 208Tl 313
are detected by the equipment. 212Pb bifurcates to 208Tl with 314
35.94% and to 212Po with 64.06%, but 212Po is not an impor- 315
tant γ emitter. However, in the location areas of our monitoring 316
stations there are fewer of those than of the 238U-222Rn series, 317
and in typical spectra generated by the equipment only the pres- 318
ence of 212Pb is detected. The balance of matter is similar to 319
that of the previous series Eq. 13. The half-life of 216Po is 320
0.15 s. Hence, it can be assumed that at the end of detection 321
equilibrium exists between 216Po and 212Bi. 322

V. ANALYSIS OF 131I 323

A. Identification and Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) 324

Full energy peaks of 131I gamma emitters are very close 325
to some full energy peaks of 212Pb, 214Pb and 214Bi. These 326
natural emitters belong to the 222Rn radon and 220Rn thoron 327
series, and are always present in the spectrum. Overlapping 328
of iodine gamma lines with other emmiters occurs between 329
the 284.2 keV, 364.4 keV and 636.97 keV peaks of 131I. 330
The 722.89 keV peak does not overlap with those of natu- 331
ral emitters, but it has very low emission probability. Like the 332
80.18 keV of 131I, that does not overlap with other peaks, but is 333
outside the linear operating range of the scintillator. Therefore, 334
to identify 131I we can only use full energy peaks overlapped 335
with natural emitter peaks, which are always present in the 336

spectrum. As a consequence, the minimum detectable activity337
of 131I is greater than for other emitters.338

Identification of 131I was accomplished using several equip-339
ment simulations where the filter was impregnated with 131I.340
These simulated spectra was combined with an experimental341
background spectrum. The resultant spectra is shown in Fig. 5342
When the 364.4 keV peak is identified as 131I instead of 214Pb343
in the combined spectrum analised by pGamma, the activity of344
131I ranges between 0.4 Bq/m3 and 0.8 Bq/m3. The latter is its345
Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA). For comparison, 60Co346
MDA is 0.02402 Bq/m3 and 137Cs MDA is 0.01662 Bq/m3347
(the air flow for the experimental background spectrum was348
8.870m3/h).349

B. Determination of Specific Activity350

The activity concentration of 131I can be determined using351
the filter’ s retention efficiency, which has already been studied352
by several authors ([4], [5]). It depends on the iodine species,353
particle size and air flow. The equipment for continuous mea-354
surement and identification of gamma radioactivity in aerosols355
for which this version of the pGamma code has been devel-356
oped uses a GF 10 from Hahnemühle fiberglass paper filter.357
The fiberglass paper filter can only retain iodine particles. Their358
average size can be found in a number of works [6], [7]. Their359
diameter typically ranges between 0.2 μm and 0.5 μm. The air360
flow of the equipment in normal operation is 110m3/h. In these361
conditions, the efficiency of the GF 10 filter for iodide can be362
considered as:363

εf =

{
99− 0%(for particles)
0%(for all the other cases)

(18)

However, the estimation of filter efficiency is not enough to364
determine the activity concentration of 131I. Iodine can appear365

as a particle or gas in the form of elemental I or I2, organic 366
(chiefly methyl iodide CH3I) or inorganic (hypoiodous HOI). 367
The GF 10 filter does not capture all iodine species (actu- 368
ally, no filter does); it only retains particles. The only way 369
to determine total activity concentration in the air is to know 370
the concentration of iodine particles at the surveillance sta- 371
tion, but this is impossible because of the special behavior of 372
iodine transport in the atmosphere. The composition of iodine 373
can be measured by gas chromatography [8], but this method 374
is outside the equipment’s concept. Several authors have made 375
estimates from information collected during the Chernobyl or 376
Fukushima accidents. For example, in [9] it was estimated that 377
50% of iodine is particles and the rest is gaseous. In his book 378
[10], A. C. Chamberlain reports some particle-gas rate val- 379
ues, but they differ significantly from each other. Finally, the 380
assumption in RASCAL 4.3 code [11], i.e. 33% of iodine par- 381
ticles, was considered for this work. We must bear in mind that 382
the final purpose of the equipment is not to perform accurate 383
measurements of air component concentration, but to provide 384
information about gamma emitters in the air, such as the above 385
estimates. 386

VI. ACTION LEVELS 387

Three action levels are provisionally considered2: 388388
1) Investigation level. 389
2) Alert level, according to the concentration limit value in 390

the air for public members (concentration giving by a 391
dose 1 mSv/year). 392

3) Alarm level, according to twice the concentration limit 393
value for the public. 394

The investigation level is initiated when: 395395
1) The activity detected exceeds activity concentration 396

thresholds for critical anthropogenic or natural isotopes 397
stored in a library. For the former, the threshold is 398
based on the recommendation of the 18 December 2003 399
Commission, (2004/2/EURATOM) DO L2/36 (6.1.2004). 400
For NORM radionuclides, the threshold is based on sta- 401
tion measurement values (e.g. 2 · 10−2 Bq/m3 for 131I 402
and 3 · 10−2 Bq/m3 for 137Cs). 403

2) The analysis report contains one or more unidentified 404
peaks. 405

3) The variation of the total number of counts on the detec- 406
tor during consecutive identical periods of time, defined 407
as Relative Variation in the Number of Counts (RVC), 408
exceeds an empirical value. This can be expressed as: 409

dC

C
=
C(t2)− C(t1)

C(t1)
(19)

410

Where C(t1) and C(t2) are the number of counts on two 411
consecutive identical periods of time. After a year of operation 412
we propose a statistic analysis of the results and a revision of 413
the investigation levels. 414

VII. ANALYSIS OF A SPECTRUM BY PGAMMA415

This section presents a pGamma analysis example of a typi-416
cal 24 h spectrum obtained at Ascó station on 10 January 2015.417
The average air flow was 8.35 Bq/m3, there was no rainfall and418
the temperature ranged between 7◦C and 15◦C. The spectrum419
is shown in Fig. 6. Note that the peaks caused by NORM, i.e.420
detectable gamma emitters of the 238U series and 212Pb of the421
232Th series, appear combined with the intrinsic spectrum of422
the LaBr3 detector. No anthropogenic emitters are observed in423
the air.424

Considering the spectrum in Fig. 6, the components are:425
1) Aerosols (mainly NORM) retained on the filter; 2) Cosmic426
particles and their interaction with elements on the detection427
zone and 3) Intrinsic spectrum of the detector. Table IV illus-428
trates the detectable gamma peaks of the 238U and 232Th series.429
Fig. 7 shows the background spectrum (without air suction430
or aerosol retention) generated by the equipment. The cos-431
mic component is only important at low energies. The level of432
intrinsic radiation from the detector is very significant in the433
range of interest, even higher than for the component result-434
ing from aerosols retained on the filter. The radiation generated435
in the LaBr3 crystal is mainly due to

138La (Fig. 8). The436
most important peaks of the intrinsic spectrum of the LaBr3437

scintillation detector are: 1) between (0-300) keV β continuous; 438
2) between (700-1100) keV β continuous plus gammas of 439
789 keV; 3) between (1400-1500) keV gammas of 1436 keV 440
and a sum peak of gammas of 1436 keV and X-rays of 32 keV. 441

Fig. 9 shows the pGamma report of the analised spectrum. 442
The report has four parts: 1) overall parameters of the spec- 443
trum; 2) specific activity of identified isotopes (first column for 444
activity, second for error and third for the minimum detectable 445
activity); 3) identified peaks; and 4) unidentified peaks. 446

Following the list of expected peaks (Table IV), the code 447
identified: 1) The most probable 214Pb peaks; 2) The most prob- 448
able 214Bi peaks; 3) One 212Pb peak; and 4) The 789 keV and 449
of 1436 keV γ peaks and the combination of the γ of 1436 keV 450
with the X-ray of 32 keV of the intrinsic spectrum of the LaBr3 451
crystal. 212Bi does not appear in the list of identified peaks 452
because its gamma rays have a very low emission probability 453
and its full energy peaks are not significant enough. 208Tl has no 454
identified peaks. From 208Tl, the 510.7 keV peak is very close 455
to the annihilation peak and is too small to be distinguished by 456
a scintillator, the same is true of the 583.19 keV peak. This one 457
is important but very close to the 609.31 keV peak of 214Bi, 458
which is a very significant one, and therefore the overlapping 459
peak is assigned to 214Bi. The 2614.51 keV peak is out of the 460
operating range of the equipment. It must be remembered that, 461
with the resolution of scintillators, the 242 keV and 295.22 keV 462
peaks of 214Pb coincide with the 212Pb peaks. Finally, the peak 463
6 at 514.1 keV is the annihilation peak. 464

VIII. CONCLUSIONS465

The pGamma code is an automatic spectrometric analysis466
system for environmental radiation monitoring equipment with467
spectrometric capability. The version presented in this paper468
was specifically designed for our equipment of continuous mea-469
surement and identification of gamma radioactivity in aerosols470
with paper filter. Nevertheless, the code is perfectly adaptable to471
other equipment of the environmental radiological surveillance472
network of the local Catalan Government. The code identi-473
fies gamma emitters in the energy spectrum and determines474
their specific activity. If an emitter is not identified or activ-475
ity concentration of any identified emitter exceeds an empirical476
threshold, an alarm is generated.477

paper filter. It is called pGamma and has been developed10
by the Nuclear Engineering Research Group at the Technical11
University of Catalonia - Barcelona Tech and by Raditel Serveis i12
Subministraments Tecnològics, Ltd. The code has been developed13
to identify the gamma emitters and to determine their activ-14
ity concentration. It generates alarms depending on the activity15
of the emitters and elaborates reports. Therefore it includes a16
library with NORM and artificial emitters of interest. The code is17
being adapted to the monitors of the Environmental Radiological18
Surveillance Network of the local Catalan Government in Spain19
(Generalitat de Catalunya) and is used at three stations of the20

CANBERRA). Nevertheless, it is generic software not intended 38
for automatic analysis since each individual analysis must 39
be conducted by a specialised technician. For this reason, 40
our research group has developed a spectrometric analysis 41
code specifically designed for the above equipment. This 42
code is being used at stations with aerosol monitors on 43
the Environmental Radiological Surveillance Network of the 44
Generalitat de Catalunya (local Catalan Government), Spain1: 45
Three monitors are currently fully operative: two in the surveil- 46
lance station of the Ascó and Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plants 47
(both in the province of Tarragona, Spain), and one in the 48
Engineering School of Barcelona, Spain. Two new monitors 49
will shortly be deployed in Roses (province of Girona) and in 50
Puigcerdà (province of Barcelona). The code has been adapted 51
for the analysis of gamma spectra generated by other moni- 52
tors with spectrometric capability of the Network, i.e. river and 53
direct air monitors. We are starting the tuning of these versions 54
of the code on the monitors for river and direct air. 55

The code, called pGamma, discriminates spectrum informa- 56
tion, identifies emitters appearing on the spectrum, determines 57
activity concentration in Bq/m3 and generates alarms accord- 58
ing to its calculated values. It has a normal operation mode and 59
special operation mode for spectra obtained during energy cal- 60
ibration of the equipment. Additionally, another mode called 61
investigation, is set when the variation in the total number of 62
counts exceeds a certain level, or when a full energy peak is not 63
identified. 64

The code input is an ASCII text file with the number of 65
counts per channel of the spectrum and a header with informa- 66
tion about measurement conditions: date and time of counting 67
initiation and termination, live time, air flow, operation mode, 68
the parameters of the energy calibration curve, etc. Fig. 1 is 69
a general operation diagram of pGamma in normal operation 70
mode. 71

The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the 72
treatment of the peaks in the spectrum. In Section III, efficiency 73
calibration is presented. The determination procedure of activ- 74
ity concentration is shown in Section IV. Section V describes 75
the identification of 131I. In Section VI, the action levels are 76

Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VIII.78

II. PEAK TREATMENT79

The first step in the analysis of the spectrum is the treatment80
of the peaks: the searching of possible peaks on the spectrum81
and its identification.82

A. Peak Search83

Peak search and analysis is performed after the input spec-84
trum is smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay method [1]. The85
smoothing algorithm allows the first, second and third deriva-86
tives of the spectrum to be obtained. The first derivative is used87
to determine the local maximums, which are subjected to a sta-88
tistical test to discriminate real centrer of peaks (centroids) from89
spurious transitions. The nearest relative maximums of the first90
derivative at both sides of the centroid, indicate the channel of91
the peak boundaries. Using the second and the third derivate,92
single peaks are discriminated from multiplets. With the cen-93
troid and the boundaries of the peaks, the net area and the94
background are determined. The last step is the fitting of each95
peaks to a Gaussian curve. It allows the determination of the full96
width at half maximum (FWHM) and perform the chi-square97
test for further discrimination. With this information, pGamma98
generates a first list of possible peaks with their characteris-99
tics. The calculated parameters are centroid, lower and upper100
boundaries of the possible peak, full width at half maximum,101
gross area and net area.102

B. Peak Identification103

1) Energy Calibration: The use of energy calibration104
makes it possible to state the centroid, FWHM and limits105
of peaks in energy units instead of number of channels. The106
relationship between energy and adopted number of channel is:107

E = a+ bC + cC2 (1)

Where C is the channel and a, b and c are the parameters of the108
calibration curve. Energy calibration must be performed prior109
to installation of equipment in a station.110

2) Peak Identification: Peaks can be identified using the 111
library of gamma emitters of interest included in the code. 112
This library has been created by us using information from [2]. 113
For aerosol equipment, these emitters are the NORM radionu- 114
clides (238U-222Rn series, 232Th-220Rn series, 40K and 7Be) 115
and artificial emitters from nuclear power plant discharges 116
(e.g. radio-iodines, 137Cs, 134Cs and 132Te) or industrial appli- 117
cations. Information about emitters includes energy and the 118
emission probability of emitted gamma rays, empirical thresh- 119
olds for NORM emitters to decide if pGamma must switch to 120
investigation mode and derived concentration limits in the air. 121

The centroid energy of each peak is compared with the 122
energy of gamma emitters. For similar values, the emitters are 123
considered candidates for that peak and a list of candidates 124
is generated. To identify a set of peaks with a radionuclide 125
with multiple gamma emissions, the ratio between intensity 126
of detected gammas and total intensity of the gammas of the 127
emitter in the library is used. The relationship between the 128
members of 238U-222Rn series and 232Th-220Rn series is con- 129
sidered too. pGamma cannot determine activity concentration 130
of unidentified peaks. 131

III. DETECTION EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION 132

In order to determine activity concentration, the code needs 133
information about the detection efficiency. Since the factors 134
integrating the detection efficiency are very difficult to deter- 135
mine due to a complex geometry and a wide range of possible 136
energies, efficiency calibration must be performed. First, the 137
same geometry of the paper filter (source), detector and detec- 138
tion volume of the equipment during normal operation must 139
be reproduced. This implies preparing a calibration source 140
by shaping it into a disc with the same diameter of aerosols 141
retained on the filter, and the same self-absorption (negligi- 142
ble) and gamma emitters of several energies in the range from 143
100 keV to 2000 keV. In consequence, the analytical determi- 144
nation of efficiency is cumbersome. The solution consists in 145
using a calibration source with similar characteristics to the 146
source to be measured and determining efficiency from experi- 147
mental values. To ensure unbiased calibration, the calibration 148
source should be identical to the radioactive samples in all 149
aspects affecting detection [3]. If no calibration source is avail- 150
able or more points are required for adjusting the efficiency 151
curve, Monte Carlo n-Particle (MCNP5, version 2.6.0) provide 152
a further possibility for calculating the detector efficiency. 153

We used simulated 131I and commercial 60Co sources 154
(Table I) with similar geometry and materials to those of the 155
impregnated filter of the monitor. The simulated 131I source 156
is composed of two radioisotopes: 133Ba and 137Cs. The com- 157
bination of both emitters generates a gamma energy spectrum 158
whose full energy peaks have centroids and a relationship of 159
areas very similar to the 131I spectrum. The simulated 131I 160
source has the same area as the impregnated filter. The emitter 161
material is deposited on a polymeric membrane with a stainless 162
steel backing of 0.762 mm thickness and an 0.9 mg/cm2 alu- 163
minized mylar window. Gamma absorption of the window and 164
the backscattering on the back of the membrane are negligible. 165
Therefore, it can be considered that the material and geometry 166

of the source have the same behaviour as the impregnated paper167
filter. To simulate the detector response on the MCNP5 sim-168
ulation we had used the FWHM obtained from the peaks on169
the spectra for the calibration sources (131I and 60Co) with the170
experimental setup. The function used is:171

FWHM = 0.008 + 0.013·
√
E + 0.593·E2 (2)

where E is the energy in MeV and the FWHM obtained is also172
in MeV.173

Experimental efficiencies were obtained by analyzing the174
experimental spectra of 131I and 60Co by pGamma. Before the175
calculation of the efficiency, the net counts of the experimental176
peaks had to be compensated by a correction factor. The source177
capsule elevated the membrane where the radioactive material178
is deposited such that the membrane is slightly higher than the179
paper filter (about 0.283 cm). Assuming that both sources, the180
impregnated paper filter in normal operation and the calibration181
source, are discs and the detector window is a disc too (geome-182
try on Fig. 2), we could determine the geometric factor in both183
cases using the following expansion in power series:184

equations (6) and (7) we find the values of εd on Table II. A 204
second efficiency curve, obtained from MCNP5, is compared 205
with that obtained from experimental values, Fig. 3. As can 206
be seen, the two curves are very close, with the exception of 207
experimental efficiency for 380 keV. By fitting the experimen- 208

efficiency is: 210

Since Monte Carlo methods were used to complement the211
experimental values to obtain the efficiency curve, the equip-212
ment simulation model must be benchmarked. In fact, without213
the geometry correction, Fig. 3 itself could be a validation of214
the Monte Carlo simulations. It is interesting to analyze and215
compare the experimental and Monte Carlo simulated spec-216
tra of the equipment with the calibration source instead of the217
paper filter. As the sources were very close to the front win-218
dow of the detector, some true coincidence summing peaks219
appeared on the spectrum. These cannot be reproduced with220
a single MCNP5 simulation, but as we want to compare the221
procedure used to obtain the efficiency curve and these sum222
peaks are not required for the efficiency calculations, we will223
not simulate them. Fig. 4 compares simulated and experimen-224
tal 60Co and simulated source of 131I spectra. The simulation225
reproduces perfectly the processes that not depend on the226
electronic instrumentation modules. As can be seen, backscat-227
tering peaks, Compton continuum, Compton valley and two228

COMPARISON OF NET COUNTS OF PEAKS T3:2

full energy peaks appear. The differences between both spectra 229
are due to the fact that background radiation is not simulated. 230
Intrinsic radiation from the LaBr3(Ce) scintillator, i.e.

138La 231
and 138La plus X-rays peaks at 1468 keV, appears in the experi- 232
mental spectrum. This component was not simulated, but is not 233
relevant for efficiency calibration. Moreover, at low energies 234
the simulated spectrum has fewer counts than the experimental 235
one. This is because the Monte Carlo model does not simulate 236
the background radiation components of cosmic rays or earth’ s 237
NORMs, resulting in fewer X-rays on the lead shielding (peak 238
near 80 keV in the spectrum). In our model, only X-rays from 239
absorption of the calibration source radiation are generated. 240
Again, this is not important for efficiency calculation. 241

Since the simulated 131I has many peaks at low energies, the 242
effect of sum peaks is more noticeable, at least in our energy 243
range (0-2048 keV). Monte Carlo does not generate sum peaks, 244
as can be seen in Fig. 4. For full energy peaks with little or no 245
influence of sum peaks, simulation results are good. Table III 246
compares the net areas of full energy peaks of simulated and 247
experimental spectra. Peaks influenced by a sum peak are not 248
used in efficiency calibration. 249

IV. DETERMINATION OF THE ACTIVITY CONCENTRATION 250

After identification of gamma emitters in the spectrum, the 251
spectrometric analysis system determines their specific activity 252
in the air Ãa, expressed in Bq/m

3, according to the net area of 253
the most efficient emitter of the isotope. However, the obtained 254
spectrum corresponds to the number of counts caused by the 255
radionuclide concentration on the filter, which is different from 256
the radionuclide concentration in the air. Because the activity on 257
the filter Af is proportional to the number of captured atoms, 258
a balance of activity can be performed in the same way as for 259
concentration. The radionuclide concentration of an analysed 260
emitter on the filter at a certain time depends on three factors: 261
1) the number of captured atoms of this emitter; 2) decays of 262
the parent nuclei of this emitter, and 3) decays of this emitter. 263

Activity on the filter Af is proportional to activity in the air 264
Ãa, air flow Q, and retention efficiency of the filter εf [4], [5]. 265
Nevertheless, as activity on the filter implies a balance of matter 266
on the filter, concentration of each radionuclide depends on its 267

position in the decay series. In the case of aerosol equipment,268
the radionuclides are belonging to the 238U-222Rn series, the269
232Th-220Rn (chiefly 212Pb, 212Bi and 208Tl) series or to none270
of the series. A slightly different statement is required for each271
case.272

A. Radionuclides not Belonging to a Series273

Most artificial emitters fall in this category. The balance of274
matter in this case is simply:275

dAf
dt

= Qεf Ãa(0)− λiAf (9)

Equation (9) can be solved by integration and as result the filter276

Where λi is the decay constant for radionuclide i, Ni the net280

time fo the Multiple Channel Analyzer), Q the average air-283
flow, εf the filter efficiency, εd the detection efficiency for the284
most probable gamma of radionuclide i, and νi the emission285
probability of the most probable gamma of radionuclide i.286

B. 238U−222Rn Series287
The gamma emitters in the air of interest belonging to the288

decay series of 238U are the descendents of 222Rn:289

Numbers in parenthesis in the chain (12) represent the nomen-290
clature used for the radionuclides in the following equations.291
These radionuclides are present on all countings because they292
come from the earth and surrounding buildings. Among them293
we can find some gamma emitters of certain importance, mainly294
214Pb and 214Bi. The equations of balance of matter for chain295

218Po reaches its equilibrium at 95% in 13 minutes. By com-297

paring the partial time of detection of 1 h and the total time of298
detection of 24 h, the hypothesis that 218Po and 214Pb are in299
equilibrium in the air can be supported.300

Ãa1(0) = Ãa2(0) (14)

By considering the equilibrium condition Eq. (14) and devel- 301

C. 232Th- 220Rn Series 309

As in the previous case, only the nuclides at the end of the 310
chain are of interest in this series, i.e. from 220Rn: 311

(17)

These radionuclides are always present in air aspiration, like 312
in the previous series. Among them, 212Pb, 212Bi and 208Tl 313
are detected by the equipment. 212Pb bifurcates to 208Tl with 314
35.94% and to 212Po with 64.06%, but 212Po is not an impor- 315
tant γ emitter. However, in the location areas of our monitoring 316
stations there are fewer of those than of the 238U-222Rn series, 317
and in typical spectra generated by the equipment only the pres- 318
ence of 212Pb is detected. The balance of matter is similar to 319
that of the previous series Eq. 13. The half-life of 216Po is 320
0.15 s. Hence, it can be assumed that at the end of detection 321
equilibrium exists between 216Po and 212Bi. 322

V. ANALYSIS OF 131I 323

A. Identification and Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) 324

Full energy peaks of 131I gamma emitters are very close 325
to some full energy peaks of 212Pb, 214Pb and 214Bi. These 326
natural emitters belong to the 222Rn radon and 220Rn thoron 327
series, and are always present in the spectrum. Overlapping 328
of iodine gamma lines with other emmiters occurs between 329
the 284.2 keV, 364.4 keV and 636.97 keV peaks of 131I. 330
The 722.89 keV peak does not overlap with those of natu- 331
ral emitters, but it has very low emission probability. Like the 332
80.18 keV of 131I, that does not overlap with other peaks, but is 333
outside the linear operating range of the scintillator. Therefore, 334
to identify 131I we can only use full energy peaks overlapped 335
with natural emitter peaks, which are always present in the 336

spectrum. As a consequence, the minimum detectable activity337
of 131I is greater than for other emitters.338

Identification of 131I was accomplished using several equip-339
ment simulations where the filter was impregnated with 131I.340
These simulated spectra was combined with an experimental341
background spectrum. The resultant spectra is shown in Fig. 5342
When the 364.4 keV peak is identified as 131I instead of 214Pb343
in the combined spectrum analised by pGamma, the activity of344
131I ranges between 0.4 Bq/m3 and 0.8 Bq/m3. The latter is its345
Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA). For comparison, 60Co346
MDA is 0.02402 Bq/m3 and 137Cs MDA is 0.01662 Bq/m3347
(the air flow for the experimental background spectrum was348
8.870m3/h).349

B. Determination of Specific Activity350

The activity concentration of 131I can be determined using351
the filter’ s retention efficiency, which has already been studied352
by several authors ([4], [5]). It depends on the iodine species,353
particle size and air flow. The equipment for continuous mea-354
surement and identification of gamma radioactivity in aerosols355
for which this version of the pGamma code has been devel-356
oped uses a GF 10 from Hahnemühle fiberglass paper filter.357
The fiberglass paper filter can only retain iodine particles. Their358
average size can be found in a number of works [6], [7]. Their359
diameter typically ranges between 0.2 μm and 0.5 μm. The air360
flow of the equipment in normal operation is 110m3/h. In these361
conditions, the efficiency of the GF 10 filter for iodide can be362
considered as:363

εf =

{
99− 0%(for particles)
0%(for all the other cases)

(18)

However, the estimation of filter efficiency is not enough to364
determine the activity concentration of 131I. Iodine can appear365

as a particle or gas in the form of elemental I or I2, organic 366
(chiefly methyl iodide CH3I) or inorganic (hypoiodous HOI). 367
The GF 10 filter does not capture all iodine species (actu- 368
ally, no filter does); it only retains particles. The only way 369
to determine total activity concentration in the air is to know 370
the concentration of iodine particles at the surveillance sta- 371
tion, but this is impossible because of the special behavior of 372
iodine transport in the atmosphere. The composition of iodine 373
can be measured by gas chromatography [8], but this method 374
is outside the equipment’s concept. Several authors have made 375
estimates from information collected during the Chernobyl or 376
Fukushima accidents. For example, in [9] it was estimated that 377
50% of iodine is particles and the rest is gaseous. In his book 378
[10], A. C. Chamberlain reports some particle-gas rate val- 379
ues, but they differ significantly from each other. Finally, the 380
assumption in RASCAL 4.3 code [11], i.e. 33% of iodine par- 381
ticles, was considered for this work. We must bear in mind that 382
the final purpose of the equipment is not to perform accurate 383
measurements of air component concentration, but to provide 384
information about gamma emitters in the air, such as the above 385
estimates. 386

VI. ACTION LEVELS 387

Three action levels are provisionally considered2: 388388
1) Investigation level. 389
2) Alert level, according to the concentration limit value in 390

the air for public members (concentration giving by a 391
dose 1 mSv/year). 392

3) Alarm level, according to twice the concentration limit 393
value for the public. 394

The investigation level is initiated when: 395395
1) The activity detected exceeds activity concentration 396

thresholds for critical anthropogenic or natural isotopes 397
stored in a library. For the former, the threshold is 398
based on the recommendation of the 18 December 2003 399
Commission, (2004/2/EURATOM) DO L2/36 (6.1.2004). 400
For NORM radionuclides, the threshold is based on sta- 401
tion measurement values (e.g. 2 · 10−2 Bq/m3 for 131I 402
and 3 · 10−2 Bq/m3 for 137Cs). 403

2) The analysis report contains one or more unidentified 404
peaks. 405

3) The variation of the total number of counts on the detec- 406
tor during consecutive identical periods of time, defined 407
as Relative Variation in the Number of Counts (RVC), 408
exceeds an empirical value. This can be expressed as: 409

dC

C
=
C(t2)− C(t1)

C(t1)
(19)

410

Where C(t1) and C(t2) are the number of counts on two 411
consecutive identical periods of time. After a year of operation 412
we propose a statistic analysis of the results and a revision of 413
the investigation levels. 414

VII. ANALYSIS OF A SPECTRUM BY PGAMMA415

This section presents a pGamma analysis example of a typi-416
cal 24 h spectrum obtained at Ascó station on 10 January 2015.417
The average air flow was 8.35 Bq/m3, there was no rainfall and418
the temperature ranged between 7◦C and 15◦C. The spectrum419
is shown in Fig. 6. Note that the peaks caused by NORM, i.e.420
detectable gamma emitters of the 238U series and 212Pb of the421
232Th series, appear combined with the intrinsic spectrum of422
the LaBr3 detector. No anthropogenic emitters are observed in423
the air.424

Considering the spectrum in Fig. 6, the components are:425
1) Aerosols (mainly NORM) retained on the filter; 2) Cosmic426
particles and their interaction with elements on the detection427
zone and 3) Intrinsic spectrum of the detector. Table IV illus-428
trates the detectable gamma peaks of the 238U and 232Th series.429
Fig. 7 shows the background spectrum (without air suction430
or aerosol retention) generated by the equipment. The cos-431
mic component is only important at low energies. The level of432
intrinsic radiation from the detector is very significant in the433
range of interest, even higher than for the component result-434
ing from aerosols retained on the filter. The radiation generated435
in the LaBr3 crystal is mainly due to

138La (Fig. 8). The436
most important peaks of the intrinsic spectrum of the LaBr3437

scintillation detector are: 1) between (0-300) keV β continuous; 438
2) between (700-1100) keV β continuous plus gammas of 439
789 keV; 3) between (1400-1500) keV gammas of 1436 keV 440
and a sum peak of gammas of 1436 keV and X-rays of 32 keV. 441

Fig. 9 shows the pGamma report of the analised spectrum. 442
The report has four parts: 1) overall parameters of the spec- 443
trum; 2) specific activity of identified isotopes (first column for 444
activity, second for error and third for the minimum detectable 445
activity); 3) identified peaks; and 4) unidentified peaks. 446

Following the list of expected peaks (Table IV), the code 447
identified: 1) The most probable 214Pb peaks; 2) The most prob- 448
able 214Bi peaks; 3) One 212Pb peak; and 4) The 789 keV and 449
of 1436 keV γ peaks and the combination of the γ of 1436 keV 450
with the X-ray of 32 keV of the intrinsic spectrum of the LaBr3 451
crystal. 212Bi does not appear in the list of identified peaks 452
because its gamma rays have a very low emission probability 453
and its full energy peaks are not significant enough. 208Tl has no 454
identified peaks. From 208Tl, the 510.7 keV peak is very close 455
to the annihilation peak and is too small to be distinguished by 456
a scintillator, the same is true of the 583.19 keV peak. This one 457
is important but very close to the 609.31 keV peak of 214Bi, 458
which is a very significant one, and therefore the overlapping 459
peak is assigned to 214Bi. The 2614.51 keV peak is out of the 460
operating range of the equipment. It must be remembered that, 461
with the resolution of scintillators, the 242 keV and 295.22 keV 462
peaks of 214Pb coincide with the 212Pb peaks. Finally, the peak 463
6 at 514.1 keV is the annihilation peak. 464

VIII. CONCLUSIONS465

The pGamma code is an automatic spectrometric analysis466
system for environmental radiation monitoring equipment with467
spectrometric capability. The version presented in this paper468
was specifically designed for our equipment of continuous mea-469
surement and identification of gamma radioactivity in aerosols470
with paper filter. Nevertheless, the code is perfectly adaptable to471
other equipment of the environmental radiological surveillance472
network of the local Catalan Government. The code identi-473
fies gamma emitters in the energy spectrum and determines474
their specific activity. If an emitter is not identified or activ-475
ity concentration of any identified emitter exceeds an empirical476
threshold, an alarm is generated.477
