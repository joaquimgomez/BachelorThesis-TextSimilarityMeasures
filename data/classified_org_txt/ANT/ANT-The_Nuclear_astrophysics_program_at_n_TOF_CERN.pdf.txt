Abstract. An important experimental program on Nuclear Astrophysics 
is being carried out at the n_TOF since several years, in order to address 
the still open issues in stellar and primordial nucleosynthesis. Several 
neutron capture reactions relevant to s-process nucleosynthesis have been 
measured so far, some of which on important branching point 
radioisotopes. Furthermore, the construction of a second experimental 
area has recently opened the way to challenging measurements of (n, 
charged particle) reactions on isotopes of short half-life. The Nuclear 
Astrophysics program of the n_TOF Collaboration is here described, with 
emphasis on recent results relevant for stellar nucleosynthesis, stellar 
neutron sources and primordial nucleosynthesis. 

1 Introduction  
Neutron-induced cross sections play a fundamental role in Nuclear Astrophysics, being 

a key nuclear physics ingredient in stellar nucleosynthesis of heavy elements [1], as well as 
in light element production in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [2]. In stars, neutron capture 
reactions are responsible for the production of the majority of elements heavier than Fe, 
with two processes contributing more or less equally to the overall abundance pattern: the 
s- and the r-process. In the first one, which involves low neutron densities and mostly stable 
isotopes, progressively heavier elements are produced starting from the Fe seed nuclei, by 
neutron captures and subsequent b-decays. An interesting case occurs when an unstable 
nucleus with a relatively long half-life is produced in the process, as it can either decay or 
undergo a further neutron capture reaction, thus generating a branching in the s-process 
path. The competition between neutron capture and b-decay depends on the capture cross 
section, on the stellar half-life of the branching isotope and, most importantly, on the stellar 
thermodynamic conditions, in particular the neutron density and stellar temperature. As a 
consequence, the study of the branching points can shed some light on the stellar 
environment in which the s-process takes place, provided that accurate nuclear data on 
capture cross section and decay half-life are available. 

Apart from heavy elements, neutron capture cross sections are needed for some light 
elements acting as neutron poison, or linked to stellar neutron sources. In this last case, 
neutron spectroscopy may provide information that are not easily accessible with other 
experimental techniques. Finally, neutron cross sections are needed to clarify one of the 

 
 

most intriguing and long-lasting problems in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), i.e. the 
gross overestimate in BBN models of the primordial abundance of Lithium. 

Although neutron-induced reactions of relevance for Nuclear Astrophysics are being 
studied since many decades at neutron facilities worldwide, some open issues in stellar and 
primordial nucleosynthesis still remain to be addressed in order to reach a more 
comprehensive understanding of the elemental abundance distribution and of the galactic 
chemical evolution. To this end, an intense experimental program is undergoing at the 
neutron facility n_TOF (CERN) since almost two decades, in order to reduce the 
uncertainty on neutron capture and (n, charged particle) cross sections for some key 
isotopes, and ultimately improve the reliability of astrophysical models. Thanks to the 
innovative characteristics of the neutron beam, to the development of high-performance 
detection and data acquisition systems, and to the use of refined analysis and simulation 
techniques, a number of valuable results of relevance for the field of Nuclear Astrophysics 
have been produced so far. After a brief description of the facility, the most important 
results recently obtained at n_TOF are here discussed. 

2 The n_TOF facility at CERN 
The n_TOF facility was proposed and built at CERN with the aim of addressing the 

needs of new data of interest for Nuclear Astrophysics, for basic Nuclear Physics and for 
technological applications [3]. Neutrons are produced by spallation of a pulsed proton beam 
of 20 GeV/c momentum from the Proton Synchroton (PS) impinging on a monolithic 
water-cooled Pb target. A further layer of demineralized or borated water in the forward 
direction ensures additional moderation of the neutron energy, so to produce an almost 
isolethargic spectrum. For the first thirteen years of operation, only one neutron beam line, 
in the horizontal direction, was available, with the experimental area (EAR1) located at 185 
m distance from the spallation target. In this area, the neutron beam is characterized by an 
instantaneous intensity of 106 neutrons/bunch, an energy spectrum extending over almost 
eleven orders of magnitude, from thermal to 1 GeV, and a high energy resolution (DE/E<10-
3 in most of the energy range). More details on this area can be found in Ref. [4]. 

A second beam line in the vertical direction was recently completed at n_TOF. The 
corresponding experimental area (EAR2) is located at 20 m distance from the spallation 
target [5]. Compared with EAR1, the neutron beam in the new area has a much higher 
intensity (>107 neutrons/bunch), at the expenses of a worse energy resolution and slightly 
smaller energy range. A schematic drawing of the facility is shown in Figure 1 (left panel), 
together with the neutron flux distribution in the two areas (right panel).  

The two experimental areas are somewhat complementary. The characteristics of the 
neutron beam in EAR1 are ideal for high resolution measurements of neutron capture 
reactions on stable or long-lived radioactive isotopes (t1/2>100 y), while the much higher flux 
in EAR2 allows one to perform measurements on radioisotopes with short half-life, on 
samples available in small (sub-mg) mass, on reactions with low cross section, or on all of 
these at the same time. In fact, for radioactive isotopes the combination of the higher flux 
and shorter time-of-flight results in an increase of the signal-to-background ratio of more 
than two orders of magnitude, relative to EAR1, when considering the background related 
to the radioactivity of the sample. As a consequence, in EAR2 it is possible to perform 
challenging measurements on isotopes with half-life as short as a few months.

3 Recent results in Nuclear Astrophysics 
The experimental program of the n_TOF Collaboration in the field of Nuclear 

Astrophysics has, up to recently, mostly regarded neutron capture cross sections. Since the 
start of operation, in 2001, a large number of capture reactions have been measured, in 
EAR1, on a variety of subjects, from neutron magic nuclei, acting as bottleneck for the 
reaction flow of the s-process, to branching point isotopes, from light nuclei acting as 
neutron poison, to end-point nuclei, and, finally, to isotopes of special interest, such as 
those involved in the Os/Re nuclear cosmochronometer (see [6] for the full list of n_TOF 
results, or visit the site www.cern.ch/ntof). In all cases, a considerable reduction of the 
uncertainty on the capture cross section has been obtained, thanks to the peculiar features of 
the n_TOF neutron beam, in particular the high instantaneous neutron intensity and the high 
resolution. With the construction of the second experimental area, new lines of research 
have become accessible, in particular on reactions leading to light charged particle 
emission. In the following, a few indicative results recently obtained on some of the above-
mentioned classes of reactions are described more in details. 

3.1 Neutron capture cross section of branching point isotopes 

Branching points isotopes are unstable nuclei whose half-life is such that a competition 
exists between neutron capture and b-decay. An accurate knowledge of the capture cross 
section of these isotopes can help characterize the stellar conditions in which s-process 
occurs. A comprehensive list of the most important branching point isotopes can be found 
in [1]. 

At present, the neutron capture cross section of many of these isotopes is poorly known, 
mainly due to the difficulties in producing and handling samples of sufficient mass and 
adequate purity. Furthermore, the natural radioactivity of the sample is a source of 
background that might heavily affect the capture yield. For these reasons, few 
measurements have been performed on these isotopes so far, at a time-of-flight facility. At 
n_TOF, two important measurements, on 151Sm [7] and 63Ni [8], were successfully completed 
in the first experimental area. The relatively long half-life and large sample masses resulted 
in a high signal-to-background ratio, and allowed the n_TOF Collaboration to determine the 
Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section with an unprecedented few percent uncertainty. In 
both cases, the n_TOF results bore important Astrophysics implications. 

The construction of the second experimental area at n_TOF, with the much larger 
neutron intensity, opened the way to measurements of neutron capture cross sections of 

 
 

isotopes with shorter half-life, and/or to samples of sub-mg masses. Three important s-
process branching point isotopes with these characteristics were recently measured at 
n_TOF: 171Tm, 147Pm and the 204Tl [9]. Table I lists the half-life of these isotopes, together with 
the mass of the samples used in the n_TOF measurements, and the measured or 
theoretically calculated Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section. 

 
Table 1. Measurements on the capture cross section of branching point isotopes measured 
so far at n_TOF. Experimental results are reported with the respective error, while for 
calculations a range of predicted values is indicated.

The 171Tm branching point is independent of stellar temperature and can therefore 
provide a strong constraint on the s-process neutron density in low mass AGB stars, while 
204Tl, responsible for the production of 204,205Pb (screened from the r-process by the stable 204Hg 
and 205Tl isotopes), is crucial for understanding the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in 
AGB stars, as well as for providing hints on the stellar object that polluted the proto-solar 
nebula at the epoch of the solar system formation. Finally, the analysis of the branching 
point isotope 147Pm in the Nd-Pm-Sm region is important for modeling the AGB star 
evolution and to put accurate constraints on the interplay between metallicity, initial stellar 
mass and mixing processes. 

Measuring the neutron capture cross section of these three isotopes is a challenging task 
because of the high specific activity of these radionuclides, typically resulting in a poor 
signal-to-background ratio, and because of the difficulty in the procurement of a sufficient 
amount of material with adequate purity, as well as in sample preparation and 
characterization. Because of these problems, very scarce or no data have been collected so 
far on these isotopes, and at present one can only rely on highly uncertain theoretical 
calculations, as reported in Table I, or on a single activation measurement for 147Pm [10]. 
The availability of intense neutron beams at n_TOF finally provided the unique opportunity 
to collect, for the first time, high quality data at a time-of-flight installation for these 
reactions. The radioisotopes were produced at the Institute Laue Langevin ILL (Grenoble, 
France) high flux reactor, by irradiating for several weeks under the thermal neutron beam 
the stable progenitors with thermal neutrons. The chemical separation and sample 
preparation was carried out at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland, as described in 
Ref. [11]. 

The analysis of these reactions is currently under way, but once completed it is expected 
to provide important experimental information on the capture cross section of these 
isotopes, in some cases for the first time ever, possibly leading to a better characterization 
of these branching points. 

3.2 Studies of stellar neutron sources by neutron spectroscopy  

One of the main issues in Nuclear Astrophysics regards the modelling of neutron 
generation in the stellar environment. Large efforts are currently being devoted in various

3.1 Neutron capture cross section of branching point isotopes 

Branching points isotopes are unstable nuclei whose half-life is such that a competition 
exists between neutron capture and b-decay. An accurate knowledge of the capture cross 
section of these isotopes can help characterize the stellar conditions in which s-process 
occurs. A comprehensive list of the most important branching point isotopes can be found 
in [1]. 

At present, the neutron capture cross section of many of these isotopes is poorly known, 
mainly due to the difficulties in producing and handling samples of sufficient mass and 
adequate purity. Furthermore, the natural radioactivity of the sample is a source of 
background that might heavily affect the capture yield. For these reasons, few 
measurements have been performed on these isotopes so far, at a time-of-flight facility. At 
n_TOF, two important measurements, on 151Sm [7] and 63Ni [8], were successfully completed

in a high signal-to-background ratio, and allowed the n_TOF Collaboration to determine the 
Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section with an unprecedented few percent uncertainty. In 
both cases, the n_TOF results bore important Astrophysics implications. 

The construction of the second experimental area at n_TOF, with the much larger 
neutron intensity, opened the way to measurements of neutron capture cross sections of

The 171Tm branching point is independent of stellar temperature and can therefore 
provide a strong constraint on the s-process neutron density in low mass AGB stars, while 
204Tl, responsible for the production of 204,205Pb (screened from the r-process by the stable 204Hg 
and 205Tl isotopes), is crucial for understanding the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in 
AGB stars, as well as for providing hints on the stellar object that polluted the proto-solar 
nebula at the epoch of the solar system formation. Finally, the analysis of the branching 
point isotope 147Pm in the Nd-Pm-Sm region is important for modeling the AGB star 
evolution and to put accurate constraints on the interplay between metallicity, initial stellar 
mass and mixing processes. 

Measuring the neutron capture cross section of these three isotopes is a challenging task 
because of the high specific activity of these radionuclides, typically resulting in a poor 
signal-to-background ratio, and because of the difficulty in the procurement of a sufficient 
amount of material with adequate purity, as well as in sample preparation and 
characterization. Because of these problems, very scarce or no data have been collected so 
far on these isotopes, and at present one can only rely on highly uncertain theoretical 
calculations, as reported in Table I, or on a single activation measurement for 147Pm [10]. 
The availability of intense neutron beams at n_TOF finally provided the unique opportunity 
to collect, for the first time, high quality data at a time-of-flight installation for these 
reactions. The radioisotopes were produced at the Institute Laue Langevin ILL (Grenoble, 
France) high flux reactor, by irradiating for several weeks under the thermal neutron beam 
the stable progenitors with thermal neutrons. The chemical separation and sample 
preparation was carried out at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland, as described in 
Ref. [11]. 

The analysis of these reactions is currently under way, but once completed it is expected 
to provide important experimental information on the capture cross section of these 
isotopes, in some cases for the first time ever, possibly leading to a better characterization 
of these branching points. 

3.2 Studies of stellar neutron sources by neutron spectroscopy  

One of the main issues in Nuclear Astrophysics regards the modelling of neutron 
generation in the stellar environment. Large efforts are currently being devoted in various

laboratories worldwide to determine the reaction rate of the two most important neutron 
sources in AGB stars, i.e. the 13C(a,n)16O and 22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction. The accurate knowledge 
of the reaction rate for these sources is decisive for deriving information on neutron density, 
temperature, and pressure in the He-burning layers of AGB stars. At low projectile energy, 
direct measurements are difficult and yield, at present, highly uncertain results. An 
alternative approach to constrain the reaction rate at low energy is to measure indirect and 
transfer reactions. In particular, the study of neutron-induced reactions could provide useful 
information on the properties of the states above the neutron threshold of the compound 
nuclei formed in the reactions. 

In this respect, neutron spectroscopy of 26Mg states, of relevance for the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg 
neutron source, was recently carried out using data from neutron capture and transmission 
measurements performed at n_TOF and GELINA, respectively [12]. This latter facility, 
located at the European Commission Joint Research Center in Geel, Belgium, is based on a 
linear electron accelerator and a mercury-cooled uranium target for neutron production 
[13]. The time properties of the electron beam and the small target size make GELINA 
particularly suited for high-resolution cross section measurements in the resonance region. 
A 6Li-glass detector was used in the transmission measurement, performed in the 
experimental station placed at 50 m distance from the neutron-producing target.  

High-resolution neutron capture yields for a high-purity, metallic 25Mg sample 
measured in EAR1 at n_TOF, were combined with the transmission data collected at 
GELINA in a simultaneous R-matrix analysis performed on both data sets. This allowed to 
univocally assign the spin and parity of some important excited states of 26Mg with natural 
parity just above the neutron separation energy, not easily accessible in the direct a+Ne 
reactions. Based on the n_TOF/GELINA data, a new, more reliable estimate of the 
22Ne(a,n) cross section below 800 keV a-particle energy was obtained. The result, shown 
Figure 2, puts firmer constraints on the reaction rate of this important stellar neutron source. 
The use of neutron spectroscopy is now being considered at n_TOF for the primary neutron 
source as well, the 13C(a,n)16O one. In this case, the Collaboration is planning a measurement 
with high resolution of the time-reversal reaction, the 16O(n,a)13C.

3.3 Measurement of (n,cp) reactions in EAR2@n_TOF 

The very high instantaneous neutron intensity in the second experimental area at 
n_TOF has also made feasible to measure (n, charged particle) reactions of low cross 
section and/or for isotopes of short-half life and/or with samples of extremely small mass. 
Two isotopes of high relevance in astrophysics reactions have been investigated so far at 
n_TOF: 7Be and 26Al.  

Neutron-induced reactions on 7Be (t1/2=53.2 days) are of interest for Big Bang 
Nucleosynthesis, more specifically for the so-called “Cosmological Lithium problem” [2]. 
More details on the motivation and on the measurements can be find in [14-15]. Two 
reactions were measured on this isotope at n_TOF: the 7Be(n,a)4He and the 7Be(n,p)7Li 
reactions. For the first one, never measured before above the thermal neutron energy, two 
samples of ~3 µg total mass were used (corresponding to a total activity of 40 GBq). A 
sufficient amount of 7Be was extracted from the SINQ spallation source of PSI, chemically 
separated and deposited on different backings using different techniques. More details on 
the sample preparation can be found in [16]. For the (n,p) reaction, characterized by a much 
higher cross section, it was sufficient to use a sample of mass as small as 90 ng. In this last 
case, however, a sample of high isotopic purity was produced by implantation of a 7Be 
beam at ISOLDE. High performance experimental setups, based on solid state detectors 
[17-18], were specifically designed and built for the measurements. Combined with the 
characteristics of the EAR2 neutron beam, the world-class expertise in sample preparation 
and detector development has led the n_TOF Collaboration to collect high quality results on 
both reactions, which are expected to clarify once and for all the role of the neutron induced 
reactions on 7Be in the Cosmological Lithium Problem. 

Other successful measurements recently performed at n_TOF regard the 26Al(n,p) and 
(n,a) reactions [19]. Precise satellite observations of this cosmic g-ray emitter, whose 
relatively short lifetime (1 My) provides evidence of ongoing nucleosynthesis in our 
galaxy, offer the opportunity to improve calculations of the production and destruction rates 
of some key astrophysical reaction. However, the poor knowledge of the (n, cp) reactions 
on 26Al, responsible for its destruction, are at present the major source of uncertainty in 
predicting the amount of 26Al ejected into the interstellar medium by Wolf-Rayet stars in the 
stellar wind or following the supernova explosion. The challenge in this case is related to 
the availability of a sufficient amount of 26Al, and to the need of identifying the emitted 
particles. At n_TOF, a sample of 10 µg mass, produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory 
(USA) [20] was irradiated under the high-flux neutron beam of the second experimental 
area, with the reaction product detected in a position-sensitive solid state telescope. While 
the analysis is still in progress, preliminary results indicate that the n_TOF measurement 
might provide accurate new data on the important n+26Al reaction cross sections. 

4 Conclusions and perspectives 
The n_TOF Collaboration has been carrying out since several years an ambitious 

experimental program on Nuclear Astrophysics, with the aim of reducing the uncertainties 
on cross sections of various reactions involved in stellar and primordial nucleosynthesis. 
The unique features of the neutron beam in the two experimental areas have made possible 
to study neutron capture reactions on several unstable isotopes acting as branching points,

to perform neutron spectroscopy relevant for stellar neutron sources and, more recently, to 
measure challenging (n, cp) reactions on short-lived radioisotopes or sub-mg samples. In all 
cases, a substantial reduction of the uncertainties on cross sections relevant for stellar and 
primordial nucleosynthesis has been achieved. New, challenging measurements are 
foreseen for the near future, whose results are expected to lead to significant advancement 
in the field of Nuclear Astrophysics.
