Neutron capture cross sections for zirconium isotopes have important implications in the field of 

nuclear astrophysics. In particular they play a key role in ascertaining the neutron density in the 

He burning zone of the Red Giant stars. Neutron capture cross sections of 
90,91,92,93,94,96

Zr have 

been measured over the energy range from 1 eV to 1 MeV at the spallation neutron facility 

n_TOF at CERN. Based on these data, capture resonance strengths and Maxwellian-averaged 

cross sections were determined with much improved accuracy.

1. Introduction 

Neutron capture cross sections of 
90,91,92,93,94,96

Zr are important in nuclear astrophysics 

because Zr belongs to the first s-process peak in the solar abundances distribution near neutron 

magic number N=50. Accurate s-process analyses have attracted great interest over the last 

decade thanks to progress in both astronomical observations and stellar models. Understanding 

of the s-process has advanced from a phenomenological description of the abundance 

distribution in the solar system towards a comprehensive picture, which includes the overall 

aspects of stellar and galactic evolution [1]. However, success of stellar s-process models could 

be achieved only after significant improvements in neutron capture cross section data, which 

reached uncertainties of only a few %. Despite these successes, cross sections for many nuclides 

still have not been measured with the required accuracy, particularly in the mass region A≤100 

as well as for neutron magic nuclei, where cross sections are small and dominated by isolated 

resonances [2]. In particular, 
90,91,92,93,94

Zr are characterized by low neutron capture cross 

sections and are predominately of s-process origin. In contrast, 
96

Zr is considered to be an r-only 

isotope with a small s-process admixture [1].  

2. Experimental apparatus 

The neutron capture cross sections of 
90,91,92,93,94,96

Zr were measured with high resolution at 

the n_TOF facility at CERN. A pair of C6D6 detectors was used to recorded prompt capture γ-

rays from the sample at a source-to-sample distance of 185 m. The detectors, which are 

designed for minimized neutron sensitivity [3], were mounted perpendicular to the neutron 

beam at a distance of about 3 cm from the beam axis. The background due to in-beam -rays 

was reduced by placing the detectors 9 cm upstream of the sample position. The γ-response was 

calibrated by means of standard 
137

Cs, 
60

Co, and Pu/C sources. The data were acquired with fast 

flash ADC using the standard n_TOF data acquisition system [4]. The zirconium samples were 

prepared from oxide powder, pressed to pellets 22 mm in diameter, and encapsulated in thin 

walled aluminium cans. The relevant sample characteristics have been reported previously [5]. 

3. Analysis and results 

Data analysis was based on accurate calibration of the C6D6 detectors. Ambient and 

sample related backgrounds were subtracted by means of spectra measured with an empty Al 

can and with a Pb sample. The absolute normalization of the capture yields was determined, to 

an accuracy of 3%, via the saturated resonance technique using a Au sample. The Pulse Height 

Weighting Technique (PHWT) [6] was applied to the C6D6 capture data to achieve a cascade 

detection efficiency independent of the particular de-excitation path. A resonance analysis of the 

experimental yield was performed with the R-matrix code SAMMY [7]. Due to the high energy 

resolution of the n_TOF facility, many new resonances were found. The resulting resonance 

capture yields (capture kernels) are, in general for all the Zr isotopes measured, 10-20% smaller 

than previously reported. These differences are most likely due to our use of a superior

apparatus (reduced neutron sensitivity and better weighting functions) as well as an improved 

resonance analysis using a state-of-the-art R-matrix code [7]. 

For s-process studies, Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) are required over a 

range of thermal energies. Because our capture kernels are generally lower than previously 

reported, MACS calculated from our data are, in general, lower than that listed in evaluated 

libraries. Results for 
90

Zr are shown in Fig. 1, where our MACS are as much as 10% lower than 

previously reported.

90
Zr data (full circles), with values obtained from 

JENDL3.3 (open circles) and the compilation of Ref.[2] (asterisks).  

 

4. Conclusions 

Neutron capture cross sections of 
90,91,92,93,94,96

Zr have been measured at the CERN n_TOF 

facility. Improvements in the n_TOF apparatus compared to previous experiments resulted in 

significantly improved accuracy, which should be valuable for future studies of s-process 

nucleosynthesis in this mass region. Capture kernels obtained in this work are, in general, 

smaller than reported previously. Consequently our MACS are generally lower than those in 

evaluations and compilations. These changes are most likely due to the reduced neutron 

sensitivity of our apparatus, improved weighting functions used to calculate our cross sections, 

and the use of a state-of-the-art R-matrix code in our resonance analysis.
