The energy-dependent cross section of the 7Beðn; αÞ4He reaction, of interest for the so-called
cosmological lithium problem in big bang nucleosynthesis, has been measured for the first time from
10 meV to 10 keV neutron energy. The challenges posed by the short half-life of 7Be and by the low
reaction cross section have been overcome at n_TOF thanks to an unprecedented combination of the
extremely high luminosity and good resolution of the neutron beam in the new experimental area (EAR2)
of the n_TOF facility at CERN, the availability of a sufficient amount of chemically pure 7Be, and a
specifically designed experimental setup. Coincidences between the two alpha particles have been
recorded in two Si-7Be-Si arrays placed directly in the neutron beam. The present results are consistent, at
thermal neutron energy, with the only previous measurement performed in the 1960s at a nuclear reactor.
The energy dependence reported here clearly indicates the inadequacy of the cross section estimates
currently used in BBN calculations. Although new measurements at higher neutron energy may still be
needed, the n_TOF results hint at a minor role of this reaction in BBN, leaving the long-standing
cosmological lithium problem unsolved.

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.152701

One of the most important unresolved problems in
nuclear astrophysics is the so-called cosmological lithium
problem [1], i.e., the large discrepancy between the
abundance of primordial 7Li predicted by the standard
theory of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the value
deduced from the observation of galactic halo dwarf stars.
In contrast to other nuclides, whose primordial abundances
are successfully reproduced by BBN calculations, 7Li is
overestimated by more than a factor of 3, relative to the
value inferred from the so-called “Spite plateau” halo stars.
In the standard BBN 95% of the primordial 7Li is

produced by the electron capture decay of 7Be
(t1=2 ¼ 53.2 d), relatively late after the big bang, when
the Universe has cooled down for electrons and nuclei to
combine into atoms. Therefore, the abundance of 7Li is
essentially determined by the production and destruction of
7Be. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain
the difference between calculations and observations [2–6]:

new physics beyond the standard model, errors in the
inferred primordial 7Li abundance from the spite plateau
stars and, finally, systematic uncertainties in the nuclear
physics used in the BBN calculations, in particular for
reactions leading to the destruction of 7Be. The possibility
that charged particle-induced reactions could be respon-
sible for the destruction of 7Be during BBN has been ruled
out by previous experiments [7–10], but neutron-induced
reactions on 7Be need still to be considered.
In this context, a significant impact of the 7Beðn; pÞ

reaction has been excluded by a measurement at the
LANSCE neutron facility, Los Alamos [11], but so far
the contribution of the 7Beðn; αÞ4He channel to the
destruction of 7Be has been considered negligible in
BBN calculations due to the much lower cross section
estimated for this reaction. However, this assumption has
never been verified experimentally. In literature, only one
measurement of the 7Beðn; αÞ4He cross section at thermal
neutron energy is reported, performed at the ISPRA reactor
in 1963 [12]. This result was used for extrapolation of the
cross section to BBN energies by Wagoner in 1967 [13].
Other theoretical calculations in the keV neutron energy
region yield completely different results, with discrepancies
of up to 2 orders of magnitude [14]. A cross section for the

ðn; αÞ reaction 2 orders of magnitude higher than currently
used in BBN calculations, in the pertinent neutron energy
region, could solve the cosmological lithium problem [10].
The lack of experimental data for this reaction is

essentially due to the intrinsic difficulty of the measure-
ment, related to the low cross section and to the extremely
high specific activity of 7Be (13GBq=μg). The recent
construction of a second, high-flux experimental area at
n_TOF (EAR2), CERN [15,16], offered the unique oppor-
tunity to perform a first time-of-flight measurement of the
7Beðn; αÞ4He cross section over a wider energy range.
The neutron beam in the new measuring station, located
20 m above the spallation target [17], is characterized by
an extremely high luminosity (107 neutrons=pulse), wide
energy range (10 meV < En < 100 MeV), good energy
resolution (ΔE=E ∼ 10−3 up to 10 keV), and low repetition
rate (< 0.8 Hz). All these features make EAR2 ideal for
measurements on isotopes only available in very small
amounts, with short half-lives, or both, as indeed is the case
for 7Be. Two more conditions had to be met in order to
perform the measurement: the availability of a μg-sized
chemically pure 7Be sample and a highly efficient exper-
imental setup. The samples were prepared by the Paul
Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland. Thanks to the high
selectivity of the experimental setup to the ðn; αÞ reaction,
no isotopic separation was required, but to minimize the
background from neutron-induced reactions on 7Li, the
sample material was chemically purified a few days before
the measurement. Two samples 3 cm in diameter were
prepared with ∼18 GBq of activity each (corresponding to
∼1.4 μg of 7Be), one by electrodeposition on a 5-μm-thick
Al foil and one by droplet deposition on a 0.6-μm-thick
low-density polyethylene foil. The amount of 7Be on the
samples was determined by their γ-ray activity.
The measurement relied on the coincident detection of

both α particles emitted in the 7Beðn; γαÞ4He reaction.
As shown in Fig. 1 and discussed later on, the reaction
proceeds through various energy levels of 8Be populated by
γ-ray transitions. However, the channels involving the
ground and first exited state result in the emission of
low-energy α particles (≤ 1.5 MeV each), which could not
be detected in the enormous γ-ray background of the 7Be
sample. Therefore, only the partial cross sections involving
the highest allowed excited levels between 16.6 and
18.1 MeV, which lead to the emission of two α particles
with energy in excess of 8 MeV each, are accessible
experimentally. The setup consisted of two Si-7Be-Si
sandwiches placed directly in the neutron beam. The Si
detectors were 3 × 3 cm2 in area and 140 μm in thickness.
A detailed description of the experimental setup can be
found in Refs. [18,19].
The two Si-7Be-Si arrays were mounted in an aluminium

chamber with thin entrance and exit windows for the
neutron beam. On the side, the chamber was shielded
by 1 cm of Pb for radioprotection reasons. A software

reconstruction routine [21] was applied to the digitized
signals to extract amplitude and time information. The
energy calibration of the detectors was performed by means
of the 6Liðn; tÞ4He reaction, measured with the final
detector configuration a few days before the insertion of
the 7Be samples. The same measurement provided an
indication of the upper neutron energy limit of the
measurement, which was determined by the recovery time
of the Si detectors after the γ flash from the spallation target
[17]. Therefore, the present results are limited to neutron
energies below 10 keV. A time window of �100 ns was
allowed for α-α coincidences. The efficiency of the setup
for these coincidences was estimated to be 40% and 37%
for the electrodeposited and droplet samples, respectively
(due to a slightly different spatial distribution of 7Be in the
two samples) [18]. Since the samples are slightly smaller
than the neutron beam spatial profile, data were corrected
for the beam interception factor, of 70%� 3%.
The main background component in the measurement is

related to the γ rays from the 7Be decay. Although the
individual signals correspond only to a few tens of keV, the
large pile-up probability due to the very high activity could
produce signals that mimic a high-energy deposition event.
A similar argument applies to the pileup of protons from the
competing 7Beðn; pÞ7Li reaction, characterized by a very

large cross section at thermal neutron energy (∼39 kb).
This background component was significantly reduced
applying a 2 MeV threshold on the signal amplitude.
The random coincidences produced by residual pileup
events were estimated via the coincident signals of
uncorrelated Si detectors (i.e., belonging to different
arrays).
Another potential source of background is the produc-

tion of 8Li via neutron capture on 7Li, which undergoes β
decay into 8Be with a half-life of 800 ms. Since 7Li builds
up in the sample by 7Be decay, the contribution of this
background component increases as a function of time (by
the end of the measurement, which lasted 50 days, almost
half of the 7Be had decayed into 7Li). As only the
3.03 MeV state of 8Be is populated by 8Li decay, the α
particles are emitted with an energy of 1.5 MeV, well below
the threshold used in the present experiment. Moreover, this
type of background is suppressed by more than 2 orders of
magnitude thanks to the very low duty cycle of the n_TOF
neutron beam.
Other sources of background are related to reactions

induced by neutrons with energies above a few MeV, in
particular by 9Beðn; 2nÞ, as well as the 7Liðp; γÞ and
7Beðp; γÞ, with protons produced by neutron scattering
in the polyethylene backing. All these reactions lead to 8Be,
and thus to α-α coincidences in the final state. However,
these reactions are induced by high-energy neutrons, and
therefore the corresponding signals appear at a much
shorter neutron time of flight, outside of the range of
interest for this work.
Figure 2 shows the number of recorded counts (inte-

grated over two days of beam time and normalized for the
time-dependent 7Be content in both samples) over the
whole duration of the measurement (red circles and blue

squares). The error bars represent the statistical uncertain-
ties only, while the systematic uncertainty on each data set,
related to the determination of the sample mass (10%), the
detection efficiency (4%), and the beam interception factor
(5%), is 12%. Within statistical uncertainties, the count
rates of both Si-7Be-Si arrays are constant in time,
excluding any background related to the 7Li buildup,
which is expected to produce a positive slope in the number
of counts. The background generated by random coinci-
dences is small and well under control (black triangles).
The consistent results obtained with the two arrays, within
the respective uncertainties, demonstrate that the sample
backing as well as the deposition technique had no visible
effect on the overall detection efficiency and the related
background. Figure 3 shows the measured cross section,
obtained as a weighted average of the results from both
arrays, yielding an overall systematic uncertainty slightly
below 10%.
The correct interpretation of the results requires some

preliminary considerations. Low energy (s-wave) neutron
interactions with 7Be in its ground state are strongly
affected by the Jπ ¼ 2− state in 8Be at 18.91 MeV
excitation energy, just above the neutron separation energy
of 18.899 MeV. The (n, p) channel is strongly enhanced by
this state, resulting in a cross section for thermal neutrons of
over 39 kb. The ðn; αÞ channel, on the contrary, is strongly

suppressed due to parity conservation, which forbids the
direct breakup of this state into two α particles [22]. Little is
known experimentally of the ðn; γÞ channels. In their study
of parity violation in the strong interaction, Bassi et al. [12]
succeeded in measuring the ðn; γαÞ cross section at thermal
neutron energies, whereas they could only obtain an upper
limit for the ðn; αÞ channel. Our result confirms that the
direct ðn; αÞ breakup channel is strongly suppressed and
that the ðn; γαÞ reaction remains the dominant process of α
emission following neutron capture on 7Be, for all bound
states of 8Be.
The present results shed light also on the role of the

positive parity states above the neutron separation threshold
(see Fig. 1), which can be formed by incident p wave
or higher, odd-l wave, neutrons. If any of those states
(a 3þ doublet, the second 4þ, and an additional 2þ state for
excitation energies up to 20.1 MeV) strongly contributed to
the α-emitting cross section, the tails of the corresponding
resonances should have caused an observable deviation
from the 1=v behavior from thermal up to the keV energy
region.
As mentioned above, due to the constraints on the

accessible α energy range, only electromagnetic dipole
(E1) transitions feeding the group of 8Be states between
16.626 and 18.150 MeV excitation energy are relevant for
the present study. However, because of parity conservation,
which forbids the decay of the two Jπ ¼ 1þ states at 17.64
and 18.15 MeV, only the two Jπ ¼ 2þ states at 16.626 and
16.922 MeV are contributing to the present data and to the
thermal cross sections measured by Bassi et al. [12]. The
remaining components of the reaction cross section can be
derived from theoretical calculations via the direct radiative
capture (DRC) mechanism, i.e., direct γ decays from the
capturing states to the relevant states in 8Be at 11.350 MeV
and below (Fig. 1). The corresponding DRC cross sections
were calculated according to the prescription in Ref. [23]
by determining the overlap integral of the bound state
with the continuum wave functions obtained with the
set of Wood-Saxon parameters listed in Table I. The

spectroscopic factors (C2S) have been derived by
OXBASH [24] shell model calculations with the Kumar
Hamiltonian [25] that are reproducing the level scheme of
8Be up to the 3þ levels at 19.07 and 19.235 MeV fairly
well. It has to be noted here that the 1− state at 19.4 MeV
can be populated by s-wave neutrons, and could affect the
present data by its 1=v resonance tail, complementing that
of the 2− state just above the threshold. A direct breakup
into two α particles (in their ground state) from the 1− is not
allowed, but a ðn; γαÞ process which includes the initial 1−
channel needs to be considered and has been, in fact,
included in our DRC modeling of the reaction process.
While the calculated cross sections depend strongly on

the choice of the strength of the interaction potential, the
fractional contributions of the DRC components can be
reliably determined, as they depend only weakly on these
parameters. The uncertainty on the calculated cross section
is mostly related to the spectroscopic factors. A reasonable
estimate of the uncertainty on the C2S of 20% (as derived
from shell model calculations performed with different
effective interactions) propagates to less than 10% uncer-
tainty on the cross section fractions.
The total 7Beðn; γαÞ cross section can be obtained by

combining the experimental data with the calculated frac-
tional contributions, with an overall uncertainty of ∼15%.
The result is shown in Fig. 3 by the dashed black curve.
It exceeds the sum of the minor components (normalized
to the experimental data) by more than a factor of 20,
in striking disagreement with the previous estimate of
Ref. [13], in magnitude as well as in shape.
To complete the picture of the 7Beðn; αÞ reaction at

higher energy, cross section data derived from indirect
reactions, namely, 4Heðα; nÞ7Be and 4Heðα; pÞ7Li, recently
published in Ref. [14] are shown in Fig. 3 (light blue
triangles), together with the cross section from the evalu-
ated nuclear data library ENDF/B-VII.1 (red curve). The
ENDF evaluation has been based on a R-matrix analysis
of several indirect reactions, which included the direct
breakup of the positive-parity states with even angular
momentum above the neutron separation threshold, such
as the 2þ states at 20.1 and 22.4 MeV. Since these levels
can only be populated by p-wave neutrons, the correspond-
ing resonant cross section increases with neutron velocity,
as originally assumed in Ref. [13], although the absolute
value turns out to be incompatible with the present data.
The present results allow one to draw some conclusions

on the role of the 7Beðn; αÞ4He reaction for the cosmo-
logical lithium problem. Regarding the trend of the cross
section as a function of neutron energy (Fig. 3) the
experimental data are clearly incompatible with the theo-
retical estimate used in BBN calculations [13], which was
assuming that the cross section is determined at low
energies by an s-wave entrance channel producing a 1=v
behavior, and that it is dominated above a few keV by a
p-wave channel, causing an increase with neutron velocity.

Both components were constrained by the measured
thermal values of Ref. [12]. The present data indicate that
both assumptions have to be reconsidered and that the
reaction rate currently used in BBN calculations requires a
substantial revision. In fact, a combination of the
present results for the total ðn; γαÞ cross section with the
ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation yields the overall energy depen-
dent cross section shown by the green curve in Fig. 3,
sensibly different from that of Ref. [13]. The cross section
shown by the green curve in Fig. 3 can be used to derive the
reaction rate at different temperatures by convoluting
it with the corresponding Maxwellian neutron energy
distribution, resulting in the following expression for
7Beðn; αÞ4He reaction rate in the temperature range from
1 MK to 5 GK:

NAhσvi ¼ 4.81 × 105 þ 1.84 × 106T9 þ 3.03 × 106T3=29
ð1Þ

in units of cm3 s−1mole−1. At BBN temperatures
(0.2 < T9 < 1.2), this rate is a factor of 10 lower than
estimated by Wagoner [13], a finding that confirms, but
with a significant improvement in terms of accuracy, the
recent evaluation of Hou et al. [14], which is based on a
re-analysis of data from indirect measurements exhibiting
large uncertainties (up to 100%) right in the energy region
of interest for the BBN. More details on the present
evaluation of the reaction rate can be found in the
Supplemental Material [22]. The relatively large change
in the reaction rate has, however, a minor effect on the
lithium and beryllium production during the BBN, in fact
an enhancement of the order of 2%.
In summary, the energy-dependent 7Beðn; γαÞ cross

section has been measured for the first time over a wide
neutron energy range in the high-flux experimental area
(EAR2) at n_TOF. The main difficulties that have pre-
vented the measurement of this cross section so far have
been overcome thanks to the extremely high luminosity of
the neutron beam, the extraction, chemical separation,
deposition, and characterization of a sufficient amount of
7Be, and, finally, by a suitable experimental setup based
on silicon detectors. The total reaction cross section up to
10 keVobtained by the present results in combination with
theoretical estimates indicate that below En ≈ 100 eV the
cross section is over a factor of 20 higher than the one used
in BBN calculations so far [13]. The 1=v behavior of the
cross section observed up to the maximum energy of this
measurement is excluding a significant p-wave contribu-
tion in contrast to the assumption of Ref. [13]. Considering
that, as mentioned in the introduction, a factor of 100 or
more enhancement in the 7Beðn; γαÞ rate would be neces-
sary to reconcile the standard BBN lithium yield with
astrophysical observations, the presently established rate 10
times lower than used so far in BBN calculations, leads to a
minor change of the lithium yield, thus leaving the solution

of the cosmological lithium problem to other alternative
physical scenarios.
As a final remark, we would like to point out that the

present results demonstrate the suitability of the recently
constructed n_TOF second experimental area for perform-
ing challenging neutron measurements on unstable isotopes
of short half life, of reactions characterized by a low cross
section, with samples of extremely small mass. Indeed, for
all three instances at once, this has been the case of the
present 7Beðn; αÞ measurement.
