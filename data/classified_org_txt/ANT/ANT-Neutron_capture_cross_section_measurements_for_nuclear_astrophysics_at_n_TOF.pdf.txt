The neutron time of flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN is a neutron spallation source with a flight

path of 187.5 m. Intense proton bunches from the CERN PS with an energy of 20 GeV, an intensity

of 7×1012 protons per pulse, and a pulse width of 6 ns are focused on a lead spallation module.

The white neutron energy spectrum produced in this way ranges from thermal to several GeV, thus

covering the full energy range of interest for nuclear astrophysics, in particular for measurements

of the neutron capture cross sections required in s-process nucleosynthesis. The combination of

the long flight path of 187.5 m, which allows to perform time-of-flight measurements with very

high energy resolution in a low-background environment, with the extremely high instantaneous

neutron flux and the low repetition frequency of the proton beam is quite unique and perfectly

suited for measurements of neutron capture cross sections in general and on radioactive samples

in particular. This contribution gives an overview of the completed neutron capture studies on

isotopes of Mg, Zr, La, Sm, Os, Pb, and Bi. Further improvements and future plans for nuclear

astrophysics applications are addressed as well.

Nuclear Astrophysics at n_TOF Michael Heil

1. The n_TOF facility

The n_TOF facility at CERN provides a white neutron spectrum, well suited for measure-
ments of neutron induced reactions, in particular for capture cross section measurements relevant
for s-process studies. Neutrons are produced by proton induced spallation in a water-cooled lead
block using intense proton bunches from the CERN PS accelerator complex (momentum 20 GeV/c,
7 × 1012 protons per bunch, 6 ns pulse width, and a repetition rate of 0.4 Hz on average). About
300 neutrons are produced per proton, resulting in an unsurpassed luminosity of the neutron beam.
The neutrons are slowed down in the lead block and further moderated in the 5 cm thick water layer
surrounding the spallation module.

The long flight path of 187.5 m to the present measuring station enables time-of-flight mea-
surements with excellent energy resolution in a low-background environment. Typical values for
the resolution are 0.03% in the region below 100 eV 0.1% at 30 keV. Neutron fluxes per energy
decade are almost constant 5 × 104 up to 100 keV before rising to a maximum of 2.5 × 105 around
1 MeV. A detailed description of the facility is given in the n_TOF performance report [1].

2. Experiments for astrophysics

The most important ingredients for s-process studies are neutron capture cross sections in the
astrophysically important energy range between 0.1 and 500 keV. The n_TOF facility is perfectly
suited for such measurements thanks to the broad energy spectrum, the very high luminosity, the
low background environment, the very favorable duty factor. In particular, the low duty factor
and the high instantaneous flux allows to perform measurements of small capture cross sections
and/or the use of small sample quantities. The latter aspect is especially important for experiments
which require isotopically enriched samples. In addition, the excellent energy resolution favors
measurements of resonance dominated cross sections and permits to extract resonance parameters,
even at higher energies, where resonances were difficult to resolve in previous experiments. The
high instantaneous flux and the low duty factor are also the basis for capture measurements on
radioactive samples, which are otherwise limited because of the intrinsic sample background.

Based on these features, an experimental campaign for neutron capture studies relevant for
s-process nucleosynthesis was defined during the construction phase of the facility, which was
completed in the spring of 2002. The program was focussed on three aspects: (i) Measurements of
small, resonance dominated cross sections, where emphasis was put on the use of small samples
in order to minimize corrections for sample effects. In this way, systematic uncertainties were
well under control. Moreover, backgrounds due to sample scattered neutrons could be avoided by
using especially designed C6D6 detectors as described below. (ii) This first set of experiments was
complemented by measurements on radioactive samples, which take advantage of the high flux and
the low duty factor, and by (iii) measurements on 186,187Os, which are required for an update of the
Re/Os cosmic clock.

The measurements related to the astrophysics program, which were carried out during the
first two years of operation of the n_TOF facility in 2002 and 2003, are partly described in other
contributions to this conference. Apart from two characteristic examples, a brief summary of the
investigated reactions, of the underlying motivation, and of the present status should, therefore,

suffice here. For more details the reader is referred to several contributions in these proceedings
[2, 4, 5, 6].

• 24,25,26Mg(n,γ)
The abundance pattern of the Mg isotopes is expected to carry information on the strength of
the s-process neutron source 22Ne(α ,n)25Mg, in particular with respect to the composition
of presolar dust grains formed in the circumstellar layers of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars. The analysis of these data is still in progress.

• 90,91,92,93,94,96Zr(n,γ)
The Zr isotopes have attracted considerable interest for the possibility to constrain the stellar
neutron flux by the isotope ratio 96Zr/94Zr. Due to the comparably short half-life of 95Zr
(t1/2 = 64 d) the heavier isotope can only be produced in a high neutron flux; otherwise β -
decay would dominate, leaving 96Zr completely outside the reaction path. On the one hand,
the isotope ratio was measured in presolar dust grains and by spectroscopy of ZrO bands in
the atmospheres of AGB stars. Comparisons with stellar model predictions were severely
hampered by previous cross section uncertainties. Preliminary n_TOF results are presented
in the contribution of Tagliente et al. [5] and are partly discussed in Sec. 3.

• 139La(n,γ)
Lanthanum consists almost completely of the neutron magic isotope 139La. Like all neutron
magic isotopes, 139La exhibits a very small (n,γ) cross section, which acts as a bottleneck for
the s-process with the consequence that it accumulates a fairly large s-process abundance.
Since it can be easily detected in stellar spectroscopy, lanthanum is a well suited indicator
for the distribution of the s-process abundance component in the Galaxy. The n_TOF results
[6] will contribute to a substantial improvement of this important spectroscopic tool.

• 151Sm(n,γ)
This unstable isotope represents an important branching point in the reaction path of the
s-process that provides a test case for the temperature profile of the He burning layers in
thermally pulsing low mass AGB stars. This feature results from the fact that the half-life of
151Sm is reduced from the terrestrial value of 93 yr to a few years under the typical conditions
of stellar He burning due to thermal excitation of low lying nuclear states. The cross section
of this isotope was the last missing information for an accurate analysis of this branching.
The n_TOF results [6, 7] are an essential part of this analysis.

• 186,187,188Os(n,γ)
The interpretation of the chronometric pair 187Re/187Os as a clock for the age of the Galaxy
rests on the so-called "local approximation", which means that the s-process abundances in
certain mass regions scale inversely with the respective stellar (n,γ) cross sections, Ns× 〈σ〉
= constant. By this relation, the s-component of the 187Os abundance can be defined via the
Ns× 〈σ〉 value of the s-only neighbor 186Os. Since the isotope ratio is accurately known,
an accurate value of the cross section ratio is the crucial parameter for the assessment of the
clock. The n_TOF measurement [4] was motivated by gaps in and discrepancies between
previous data sets.

• 204,206,207,208Pb(n,γ), 209Bi(n,γ)
The reaction path of the s-process path ends, when the region of the α-unstable isotopes
210Bi and 210,211Po are reached. The two main questions concerning this termination of the
s-process path were the consistent description of the Pb/Bi abundances and the role of α-
recycling. Since the cross sections of these neutron magic nuclei are among the smallest of
all stable isotopes, previous data suffered from uncertain corrections for comparably massive
samples as well as from considerable problems due to the neutron sensitivity of the γ-ray
detectors used. Both problems were well under control in the n_TOF measurements [2, 3].

3. Examples: 96Zr and 151Sm

The capture measurements were performed with a pair of C6D6 scintillation detectors (Fig.
1) using the pulse height weighting technique. The samples with diameters of 10 to 20 mm were
mounted on a target ladder together with a set of samples for evaluating the respective corrections,
i.e. dummy samples for ambient and sample-related backgrounds, a gold sample for flux normal-
ization, and samples of the neighboring isotopes for impurities in the sample material. Depending
on the individual experiments, sample masses varied from 156 mg (151Sm) to 4.9 g (208Pb). In
general, highly enriched samples could be used in order to keep the isotopic corrections small.

Figure 1: Setup for the n_TOF measurements of neutron capture cross sections, consisting of the evacuated
beam line, a sample changer, and two C6D6 scintillation detectors.

In order to minimize the background from scattered neutrons, the beam line and the target
ladder were fabricated from carbon fiber. Also the C6D6 detectors were optimized with respect to
neutron sensitivity [8]. The remaining contribution from scattered neutrons was measured with a
carbon scattering sample or by using black-resonance filters, which eliminate neutrons at specific
energies from the beam so that the background level can be determined from the measured spectra.

The spectra of the capture yields shown in Fig. 2 correspond to examples, where the cross
sections in the astrophysically relevant keV-region exhibit pronounced resonance structures (96Zr)
or a smooth energy dependence (151Sm). While the signal-to-background ratio in the latter case is
fairly large, one finds that backgrounds can be crucial for the analysis of the resonance-dominated
spectrum of 96Zr. In the keV-region, the main background contribution is due to in-beam photons,
which originate from neutron captures on hydrogen in the water moderator and are then scattered
in the sample. This component could be considerably reduced by placing the C6D6 detectors 10
cm upstream of the samples at backward angles of ≈125◦ with respect to the neutron beam. The

remaining background was determined with a lead sample, which has a low neutron capture and a
high photon scattering cross section.

Figure 2: Measured capture yields of the 96Zr(n,γ) (left panel) and 151Sm reactions (right panel) in the
neutron energy range 1 eV - 1 MeV. The ambient background was measured with an empty position in the
sample ladder. The main background contribution in the keV region is due to in-beam photons scattered
by the sample. This component, which is crucial for the resonance dominated cross section of 96Zr, can be
measured by means of a lead sample.

The setup sketched in Fig. 1 has been complemented in 2004 by a total absorption calorimeter
consisting of 40 large BaF2 crystals, which form a spherical shell 15 cm in thickness around the
capture sample. For reasons of compatibility, the concept of this array was adopted from the
Karlsruhe 4π BaF2 detector [9] with several improvements for reducing the neutron sensitivity.

4. Future activities

After the successful operation of the n_TOF facility in the years 2002-2004 a new measuring
campaign will be launched in 2007. At that time, a new cladded Pb spallation target will be installed
with different options for the moderator. Measurements can then be performed with normal water
as before, but in many cases the use of heavy water will be of great advantage, because (i) the
intensity of the in-beam γ-background will be practically negligible and (ii) the neutron flux in the
relevant keV region will be about five times higher. The price to be paid for these improvements
will be a slightly reduced resolution in neutron energy, which, however, has a minor impact on
s-process related measurements. The design of the new spallation target will be made such that it
is also suited for a second, vertical flight path of about 20 m, which is presently under discussion,
and which would provide an increase in sensitivity by two to three orders of magnitude.

The astrophysics program for the near future is summarized in Table 1. It is foreseen to
concentrate on neutron capture measurements on isotopes around the Fe-peak elements, which are
particularly important for the weak s process in massive stars, and on intermediate mass nuclei,
where such data are needed for the interpretation of isotope pattern in presolar dust grains (see

decomposition of the s- and r-process components. In both fields, existing cross section data are
inconsistent and too uncertain for meaningful abundance calculations. Furthermore, it is planned
to extend the astrophysical program by studies of (n,α) and (n, p) cross sections on various nuclei
of relevance for the p process that takes place during supernova explosions.
