Abstract. New neutron cross section measurements of minor actinides have been performed recently in order
to reduce the uncertainties in the evaluated data, which is important for the design of advanced nuclear reactors
and, in particular, for determining their performance in the transmutation of nuclear waste. We have measured
the 241Am(n,γ ) cross section at the n TOF facility between 0.2 eV and 10 keV with a BaF2 Total Absorption
Calorimeter, and the analysis of the measurement has been recently concluded. Our results are in reasonable
agreement below 20 eV with the ones published by C. Lampoudis et al. in 2013, who reported a 22% larger
capture cross section up to 110 eV compared to experimental and evaluated data published before. Our results
also indicate that the 241Am(n,γ ) cross section is underestimated in the present evaluated libraries between
20 eV and 2 keV by 25%, on average, and up to 35% for certain evaluations and energy ranges.

1. Introduction
Isotopes of 241Am and 237Np are the minor actinides
which contribute most to the long term hazard of the
nuclear waste. The first one, with T1/2 = 433 y, decays
into 237Np (T1/2 = 2.1 × 106y) via α emission. Neutron
capture reactions in 241Am, the most abundant Am
isotope present in the spent nuclear fuel, are the path
to heavier minor actinides like 243Am and Cm isotopes.
In addition, the reprocessing of Am is technologically
more advanced than for other minor actinides. For all
these reasons the improvement of the 241Am(n,γ ) data
was a major effort of the EC-FP7 ANDES project, and
four different measurements were planned and carried out.
Two of them were capture measurements performed at
n TOF [1], with the same sample but different detectors:
the Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) [2] and C6D6
detectors [3]. The other two were a transmission and a
capture measurement performed at IRMM – Geel [5], with
a different sample. In this work we present the results of
the measurement performed at n TOF with the TAC.

2. Experimental setup
The measurement was performed in 2010 at the n TOF
facility at CERN, which is a high instantaneous intensity
spallation neutron source driven by the CERN PS
synchrotron. We used the Total Absorption Calorimeter
(TAC) [2] to detect the capture reactions as a function
of the time-of-flight. This detector is made with 40 BaF2
crystals of 15 cm length covering ∼ 95% of the solid angle,
and is used to detect in coincidence (nearly) all the
γ -rays coming from the (n,γ ) reactions. The neutron beam
was monitored during the entire measurement with a 6Li
foil based detector [6]. The detector signals were recorded
by a digital data acquisition system [7] operating at 250
and 500 MSamples/s with 8 bits resolution, recording
continuously a time of flight of 32 or 16 ms for each pulse
(above 0.17 or 0.7 eV, since the time of flight is about
185 m).

The sample [8] was made of 36.5 mg of 241AmO2
embedded in a 305 mg Al2O3 matrix (to reduce/avoid
inhomogeneities), and encapsulated in a 0.5 mm thick
Al canning. The radius of the sample was 6.13 mm and
the 241Am mass 32.23(10) mg (6.82 · 10−5 atoms/barn).
It was placed in the center of the TAC, shielded with
2 mm lead due to its high activity (∼4 GBq), and a

spherical borated polyethylene neutron absorber (5/10 cm
inner/outer radius), used to reduce the background due to
scattered neutrons. In the analysis of the measurement we
observed resonances of 237Np and 240Pu. We estimated
the amount of these impurities as ∼0.029 (237Np)
and ∼ 0.00049 (240Pu) times the number of 241Am atoms.

About 2 months of beam time were dedicated to the
241Am measurement. 60% of the total amount of beam
was dedicated to measure the 241Am sample, 36% to
measure the different background components, and 4%
to measure different 197Au samples in order to normalize
the 241Am(n,γ ) cross section by means of the saturated
resonance method [9], using the 197Au strongest resonance
at 4.9 eV. The number of events detected per proton
pulse during the 241Am measurement and some of the
background measurements (a dummy sample and the Al
canning, and measurements without neutron beam with
and without the sample in place) are presented in Fig. 1.
Only the events with certain conditions in the detection
multiplicity mcr (number of detectors in coincidence) and
total deposited energy Esum (sum of the energies deposited
in the detectors in coincidence) have been considered.
Sm impurities present in the Al2O3 matrix of the dummy
sample but not in the 241Am sample are clearly visible.

3. Data analysis
The basis of the analysis procedure was the same as other
TAC measurements [10,11], with some additional features
developed to deal with pulse pile-up effects not present in
previous analysis.

The detection efficiency has been determined from
simulations, based in the DECAYGEN [12] code for
the generation of the (n,γ ) cascades and in a very
detailed geometric modeling of the TAC [13] implemented
in GEANT4 [14] for the transport of the γ -rays. The
Photon Strength Functions of the compound nuclei (242Am
and 198Au) used by DECAYGEN were modified until
reproducing the experimental results (deposited energy
histograms for different detection multiplicities), as it has
been done in previous works [10,11]. An example of
how well the experimentally obtained deposited energy
distributions due to 241Am(n,γ ) cascades are reproduced
by the simulations is presented in Fig. 2.

Three different 197Au samples were measured to
normalize to the saturated resonance at 4.9 eV. The
counting rates in the saturated part of the resonance

were quite high for the TAC (a few events per µs), and
we used the third method described in [15] to correct
for the pile-up effects. Each of the measurements were
performed at two different pulse intensities, being the
highest about 2.3 times more intense than the lowest.
All the normalization values obtained with the different
samples and the different pulse intensities were compatible
within statistical uncertainties, which were close to 1% in
all the cases. The overall normalization uncertainty is the
sum of the uncertainties of the sample mass (0.6%), the
detection efficiency (2%) and normalization to the 197Au
resonance (2%), which amounts to 3% or 5%, depending
on whether the quantities are added quadratically or
linearly.

The background components not related with the
interaction of the neutron beam with the 241Am nuclei
and the 237Np and 240Pu impurities were obtained from
dedicated measurements. The background due to fission
reactions in 241Am is very low, and was estimated from
the JEFF-3.2 [16] fission cross section and by assuming a
similar detection efficiency than for the capture reactions.
The background due to elastic scattered neutrons in
241Am was estimated by measuring the effect of neutrons
scattered in a graphite sample together with the JEFF-3.2
241Am elastic cross section. The effect of this component

is negligible in the Resolved Resonance Region (RRR),
since the neutron absorber is more effective at lower
neutron energies, and very low (∼ 1%) in the Unresolved
Resonance Region (URR). The effect of the 237Np and
the 240Pu impurities were also taken into account from the
cross section data available in the evaluations.

The self-shielding and multiple scattering effects due
to the 241Am sample and to the Al canning and the
Al2O3 matrix have been carefully studied by comparing
calculations performed with SAMMY [17], MCNP-
6.1 [18] and GEANT4. In these calculations we obtained
the theoretical capture yield under different conditions
(with/without the Al canning, the Al2O3 matrix, ...),
finding that the results obtained with the three codes were
in a reasonable agreement. The effect due to the 241Am is
small (<2%) except for the first three resonances, where is
around 10%. The effect of the Al canning is negligible, and
the effect of the Al2O3 matrix is to increase the number of
detected capture events by around a 2%, nearly constant in
the energy range of interest.

Above 1–2 keV there are pile-up effects in the capture
signals induced by the high background counting rate.
This effect has been corrected with a method which is
quite similar to the ones described in [15] and that will
be published in a future work. Below 1–2 keV this effect is
very small.

The obtained capture yield has been analyzed with
SAMMY, using a resonant description of the cross section
up to 700 eV. The URR was analyzed up to 10 keV with
the modified version of the FITACS code available in
SAMMY.

4. Results
Together with this measurement, other three 241Am(n,γ )
measurements have been performed recently: one at
n TOF using the same sample but C6D6 detectors instead
of the TAC [3] (Fraval et al.); other (together with
transmission) at IRMM – Geel [5] (Lampoudis et al.) using
a three times thicker sample, manufactured in the same
laboratory and at the same time as the one used in this
work; and the last one performed at DANCE [4] (Jandel
et al.), in Los Alamos Neutron Science Center.

Lampoudis et al. provided a capture cross section up to
110 eV which was, on average, around 20% larger than the
results provided by Fraval et al. and Jandel et al., which
are in reasonable agreement between them. The JEFF-3.2
neutron data library has adopted the results provided by
Lampoudis et al. in the RRR (up to 150 eV) whereas the
JENDL-4.0 [19] and ENDF/B-VII.1 [20], which are the
same in the RRR, have adopted the results provided by
Jandel et al. In the URR the three evaluated data libraries
are quite similar.

A comparison between the 241Am(n,γ ) cross section
we obtained and the evaluated ones is presented in Fig. 3.
Our results are a bit below JEFF-3.2 for the first three
resonances, and in in reasonable agreement up to 20 eV.
Between 20 eV and 150 eV, our cross section is higher than
the one in JEFF-3.2 by up to 10–15%, and also higher
than the one in JENDL-4.0 and ENDF/B-VII.1 by up to
30–35%. In the low energy part of the URR, our results
are higher than the evaluated ones by up to 20%, but above
1–2 keV our 241Am(n,γ ) cross section is compatible with
the evaluated ones.

5. Conclusions
We have measured the 241Am(n,γ ) cross section at n TOF
with the TAC between 0.2 eV and 10 keV. Our results are

compatible with the ones provided by Lampoudis et al.
below 20 eV and with the evaluated cross sections above
1–2 keV. This results indicate that the present evaluations
underestimate the 241Am(n,γ ) cross section below 1 keV
by up to 30%.
