Abstract

In this paper we describe the 236U(n,γ) reaction cross section measurement at
the GELINA white pulsed neutron source of the Institute for Reference Materi-
als and Measurements (IRMM) in Geel. The sample was placed in the neutron
beam at a flight station located at a nominal distance of 30 m from the neutron
source. Neutron capture gamma rays were detected by two C6D6-based liq-
uid scintillator gamma-ray detectors as a function of the neutron time-of-flight
using the pulse height weighting technique. The pulse height weighting func-
tion has been derived from Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response
to mono-energetic gamma rays. The shape of the neutron flux was measured
with a 10B chamber, placed about 60 cm upstream in the neutron beam. The
capture yield in the resolved resonance region up to 3 keV has been derived
and will be presented here. The analysis of the capture yield in terms of R-
matrix resonance parameters is planned for the near future.

1. Introduction

The accurate knowledge of neutron-induced reaction cross sections is important for appli-
cations in nuclear technology. In the past much emphasis has been put on the measurement
and evaluation of nuclear data for the existing generation of nuclear power plants. New appli-
cations, like the high burn-up of current fuels, Generation IV reactors, alternative fuel cycles,
transmutation of nuclear waste or accelerator driven systems, address other isotopes, energy
ranges and reactions for which improved nuclear data are mandatory. The capture cross section
of 236U is particularly important for the build-up of higher actinides in nuclear fuel, both in the
uranium-based fuel cycle, where 236U is produced by capture on 235U, as in the possible future
fuel cycle based on 232Th.

The evaluations of the 236U(n,γ) cross section in the resolved resonance region from the
evaluated nuclear data libraries are based on a small number of existing measurements. The
capture cross section was measured by Carlson et al. [1], and later by Mewissen et al. [2],
who also measured scattering and transmission. An early transmission experiment was done
by Harvey and Hughes [3]. Another transmission experiment was reported by Carraro and
Brusegan [4]. Also Macklin and Alexander measured neutron transmission on 236U [5].

The fission cross section has been investigated [6–8] as well. The particular interest for the
isotope 236U arises from the intermediate structure in the fission cross section. This structure
is related to the double-humped fission barrier. Eigenstates corresponding to the secondary
potential well in the fission barrier, also called class-II states, have much larger fission proba-
bilities than the usual class-I states in the primary well. The class-II states are also more widely
spaced, even up to a hundred times larger than the class-I states. This results in clusters of res-
onances with a strong fission cross section and is common for many actinides. Several of these
intermediate structure resonances have been found for actinides, like 237Np, and the even-mass
uranium and plutonium isotopes.

A high fission strength in several resonance groups has been observed by Parker et al. [8].
The first cluster is situated rather high, around 1281 eV, and has a high fission width larger than

expected from calculations. A recent fission measurement has confirmed this observation [9].
Note that these strong resonances are not present in the evaluated libraries of 236U, as can also
be seen in figure 1.

A closer investigation of the capture cross section in this region may exclude any anomalous
contribution from capture to the fission experiments. We have undertaken this neutron capture
experiment on 236U within the scientific program of the n TOF collaboration.

2. Experimental setup

The capture cross section measurement on 236U was performed using the time-of-flight tech-
nique at the pulsed neutron facility GELINA of the Joint Research Centre IRMM in Geel, Bel-
gium. This facility with its linear electron accelerator and its neutron producing target has
previously been described in detail [10–12]. The Linac has been operating to provide electron
bursts of 100 MeV average energy and 1 ns width at a repetition rate of 800 Hz and an average
beam current of 70 µA.

Neutrons were produced by (γ,n) and (γ,f) reactions, induced via Bremsstrahlung from the
electron beam hitting a rotating, mercury cooled uranium target. The neutron spectrum from
the target was moderated by water contained in a 4 cm thick beryllium canning, situated be-
neath and above the target. The partially thermalized neutrons scattered from the moderators
were collimated into the flight path through evacuated aluminum pipes of 50 cm diameter with
collimators consisting of borated wax, copper and lead, placed at regular distances. A shadow
bar made of copper and lead was placed in front of the uranium target, in this way preventing
fast neutrons from the rotary target to go into the flight paths. In addition the shadow bar at-
tenuated the intense burst of gamma rays created immediately after the impact of the electrons
on the target. The neutron intensity was continuously monitored by BF3 detectors located at
different positions around the target hall.

We have used the neutron beam line making an angle of −90◦ with respect to the electron
beam. The sample was placed in the neutron beam at the flight station located at 28.6 m from
the neutron production target.

In order to absorb slow neutrons that otherwise overlap with the next machine cycle, a cut-off
filter of 10B4C with a thickness of 0.013 at/b of

10B was placed in the neutron beam, about
20 m upstream of the sample position. Since with this thickness of 10B the neutron flux is
rather low for the first few resonances, we also performed a measurement with a 0.004 at/b
thick natCd anti-overlap filter instead of 10B. Since Cd has many resonances affecting the shape
of the neutron flux, we used this data only for the first few resonances. At the same location
additional neutron filters of Ag, W, Co, Na and S with appropriate thicknesses were placed in
the beam during dedicated background measurements.

A sample with a total amount of 338 mg of 236U has been prepared by the Institute of Physics

and Power Engineering (IPPE) in Obninsk. Enriched uranium oxide 236U3O8 was pressed into a
pellet of 10 mm diameter and placed inside a ring of 0.25 mm thick high purity aluminum with
10 mm inner and 15 mm outer diameter. We have used high purity aluminum in order to avoid
neutron capture on the nuclei from additions like manganese, present in standard aluminum.
On both sides of the ring containing the uranium sample, a 0.25 mm thick high purity aluminum
disk with 15 mm diameter was glued. In this way the sample was sealed for practical purposes,
while still having a low mass canning, essential for capture measurements. The results of an
isotopic analysis performed at IPPE is shown in table 1.

Two hydrogen-free, C6D6-based liquid scintillator gamma-ray detectors (NE230), each cou-
pled through a boron-free quartz window to a EMI9823 KQB photomultiplier, were placed out
of the neutron beam at the sample position, with a distance of 50 mm between them.

To measure the relative neutron flux, we installed in the beam about 60 cm upstream of the
sample a neutron flux detector, consisting of a boron ionization chamber with a 40 µg/cm2

deposit of 10B on both sides of the cathode in a continuous flow of a gas composed of 90%
argon and 10% methane.

Because of the small amount of sample material, the sample diameter was only 10 mm. The
detectors were also placed close to the sample to optimize the count rate. We therefore adapted
the collimation at about 1.5 m upstream of the sample position in order to have a neutron beam
with a diameter slightly larger than the sample diameter. The usual beam diameter is typically
80 mm. Therefore also the flux measurements have been done with the small beam diameter,
reducing largely the count rate in the boron ionization chamber.

The amplitude and time-of-flight information was extracted from the detector signals by re-
spectively Canberra 8715 ADCs and a 25 bit in-house developed [13] multi-hit time digitizer
with 0.5 ns resolution. In order to minimize the dead time, the events from the capture detec-
tors and from the boron ionization chamber were taken by two independent data acquisition
systems. The dead time for the flux measurement was 3.1 µs and for the capture measurement
3.8 µs. A fixed dead time correction was applied to all raw counting spectra.

For the experiment, a total amount of effective beam time of more than 800 hours was used
for data taking, including background measurements. The detector events and associated infor-
mation were written on disk for off-line analysis.

3. Data reduction

3.1 Weighting function
The signature of a (n,γ) reaction is the gamma cascade de-exciting the compound nucleus in

the capture state. In order to make the detection efficiency of a capture event independent from
the decay cascade, one usually applies the pulse height weighting technique (PHWT) [14–17]
if the detection system does not have 100% efficiency and does not cover a 4π solid angle. The
PHWT consists of making artificially the detector’s efficiency ǫγ proportional to the incident
gamma-ray energy Eγ by applying a weighting function W (Ed) such that

ǫγ =

∫
W (Ed)Rγ(Ed)dEd = kEγ (1)

where Rγ(Ed) is the detector’s response as a function of the deposited energy Ed. The weight-
ing function W (Ed) has been derived using Monte Carlo simulations with the code MCNP [18]
of the detector response Rγ(Ed) to different mono-energetic gamma rays and solving equation
1 by minimization. A 4th order polynomial was sufficient to describe the weighting function
W (Ed). Then the weighted count rate spectrum CW(En) can be written as

CW(En) =

∫
Rγ(Ed)W (Ed)dEd = Φ(En)Y (En)Ec (2)

where Φ(En) is the energy distribution of the number of neutrons incident on the sample and
Ec is the cascade energy or excitation energy of the compound nucleus.

The pulse height distribution of the C6D6 detectors was calibrated in energy using the detec-
tor response of the radioactive sources 137Cs, 60Co and a composite source of the alpha-emitter
238Pu and carbon, giving a 6.13 MeV gamma-ray through the 13C(α, n)16O∗ reaction. A si-
multaneous fit matching the three measured responses to simulated energy deposits results in
a nearly linear energy calibration in the range from the threshold energy of 150 keV deposited
energy to about 6 MeV, largely above the neutron separation energy of 237U at 5.126 MeV.

3.2 Determination of the neutron flux
The time-of-flight spectra for the flux measurements were constructed from the events with

an amplitude within a window corresponding to the energy deposit of the α and 7Li particles
from the 10B(n,α)7Li reaction. The background in the boron ionization chamber originates
from the residual scattered and thermalized neutrons present in the experimental area and from
neutrons from previous cycles that are not stopped by the anti-overlap filter.

The shape of the background on the flux measurement was estimated by placing neutron
filters in the beam. These filters consisted of foils or encapsulated material with nuclei show-
ing large resonances at specific energies, removing all neutrons from the beam at these ener-
gies. The remaining detected counts at the black resonance energies, showing an amplitude
spectrum corresponding to detected neutrons, come from background neutrons not having the
time-energy correlation. Filters of Ag, W, Co, Na and S were used to determine the shape of
the background, that could be modelled as a function of time of flight t by the simple form
BΦ(t) = a1 + a2t

a3 , with BΦ(t) the number of counts per unit time of flight.
This background shape was then subtracted from the flux measurement Φ(t) without the

filters except one. The absolute level of the background was determined with this permanent
filter, either sodium with a black resonance at 2.8 keV, or sulfur with a black resonance at
102.71 and 112.18 keV.

3.3 Capture yield
The experimental capture yield Y (En) was then extracted from the measured spectra as

Y (En) = N ×

Φ(En) − BΦ(En)
(3)

It should be noted that this yield still contains the background measured with the C6D6 detec-
tors. This background consists mainly of the radioactivity of the decay products of the sample
and ambient radioactivity, and is constant per unit of time. Neutrons scattered from the sample
and subsequently captured in the surrounding materials also contribute to the background. This
background follows the resonance structure of the scattering cross section of the target nucleus
and depends on two factors, the neutron sensitivity and the scattering to capture ratio of the
target nucleus. The detector itself and its environment determine the neutron sensitivity which
should be optimized to be as low as possible and which should be measured or modelled to be
taken into account. Typically C6D6 detectors have a very low neutron sensitivity. A large scat-
tering to capture ratio of the target nucleus results in a larger background from sample scattered
neutrons. This is in particular the case for light or near-magic nuclei where the scattering cross
section may be more than a factor 1000 larger than the capture cross section. For difficult situ-
ations also the detector canning can be optimized [19] with respect to commercially available
detectors. For the present case of 236U this background component is low.

The capture yield was normalized to the first s-wave resonance of 236U+n at 5.45 eV. This
resonance is not visible with the measurements using the 10B anti-overlap filter because of the
nearly zero neutron flux at that energy. For this purpose we used the measurement with the Cd
anti-overlap filter. A fit of this resonance with the code SAMMY [20] is shown in figure 4.

The capture yield is shown in figure 3. The left panel of the figure shows the energy range
from 0 to 500 eV. One can see the radioactive background at low energy where the energy bins
correspond to large time intervals. The first resonance is not visible in this spectrum. The right
panel of figure 3 shows the capture yield in a large energy range around 1281 eV. From the
figure it can be seen that no anomalous capture yield is observed. Therefore it seems unlikely
that the large fission width for the 1281 eV resonance observed in the measurements from
Cramer and Bergen [6] and Parker et al. [8] suffered from an experimental effect related to
capture.

4. Conclusion

A new measurement of the 236U(n,γ) neutron capture cross section in the resonance region
has been performed at the GELINA white pulsed neutron source. Data have been taken with
a low mass sample containing 338 mg 236U and have been transformed in an experimental
capture yield and the analysis of the resolved resonances is ongoing. A simultaneous resonance
analysis of available capture, fission and also transmission experiments is recommended in
order to obtain a reliable set of resonance parameters.
