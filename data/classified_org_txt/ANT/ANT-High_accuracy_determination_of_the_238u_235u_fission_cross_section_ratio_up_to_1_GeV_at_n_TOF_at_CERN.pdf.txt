(Received 27 November 2014; published 9 February 2015)

The 238U to 235U fission cross section ratio has been determined at n_TOF up to ≈1 GeV, with two different
detection systems, in different geometrical configurations. A total of four datasets has been collected and
compared. They are all consistent to each other within the relative systematic uncertainty of 3–4%. The data
collected at n_TOF have been suitably combined to yield a unique fission cross section ratio as a function of
neutron energy. The result confirms current evaluations up to 200 MeV. Good agreement is also observed with
theoretical calculations based on the INCL+ + /Gemini++ combination up to the highest measured energy.
The n_TOF results may help solve a long-standing discrepancy between the two most important experimental
datasets available so far above 20 MeV, while extending the neutron energy range for the first time up to ≈1 GeV.

I. INTRODUCTION

The neutron-induced fission cross section of the two major
isotopes of uranium, 235U and 238U, are of fundamental
importance in the field of nuclear technology, as well as for
other fields of basic and applied nuclear physics. In particular,
fission cross section data above a few MeV are important for
the development of new systems for energy production and
waste transmutation, for accelerator and space applications,
in neutron flux measurements at high energies, or for the
refinement of theoretical models on nuclear fission at high
energy. The 235U(n,f) cross section is a standard at 0.0253 eV
and from 0.15 to 200 MeV [1,2], while 238U(n,f) is a standard in
the neutron energy region between 2 and 200 MeV [3]. While
the 235U(n,f) cross section is commonly used in a variety of
fields, for example in neutron flux measurements, from thermal
to very high energy, the 238U(n,f) cross section can be more
conveniently used in the presence of a low energy neutron
background, thanks to its high fission threshold.

Despite its importance, few data have been collected up
to now on the 238U(n,f)/ 235U(n,f) cross section ratio above
20 MeV. Lisowski et al. [4] measured the ratio at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, from 0.5 to 400 MeV. Current evaluated
nuclear data libraries [5] and evaluations of cross section

standards [1] are mostly based on these results. More recently,
Shcherbakov et al. [6] measured the ratio between 1 and
200 MeV at the GNEIS facility, Gatchina. Above 50 MeV these
results are between 5 and 8% lower than those of Lisowski
et al.. On the contrary, results from Nolte et al. [7] seem to
confirm the older measurement, but they are affected by a too
large systematic uncertainty to draw a final conclusion. New,
high-accuracy measurements are therefore required to solve
the long-standing discrepancy, and improve the accuracy in
current evaluations. An extension of the energy range up to
higher energy would also be desirable, as data above 200 MeV
could prove useful for refining theoretical models, in particular
those used in modern Monte Carlo codes for high-energy
neutron transport.

To address the need of new, accurate data for a future cross
section standard, and to extend the current energy limit, a
series of measurements of the 238U(n,f)/ 235U(n,f) cross section
ratio were performed at the n_TOF facility at CERN, from
0.5 MeV to 1 GeV, in different experimental campaigns and
with different setups. After a description of the various setups
and analysis procedures in Sec. II, the n_TOF results are
presented and compared with each other in Sec. III. Suitably
combined in a unique dataset, the n_TOF results are then
compared with previous experimental data, with current
evaluations, and with the predictions of a theoretical model
extending up to the highest measured energy. Conclusions are
finally given in Sec. IV.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The measurements were performed at the n_TOF facility at
CERN [8–11], which is based on the spallation of 20 GeV/c

HIGH-ACCURACY DETERMINATION OF THE 238U/ . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 91, 024602 (2015)

protons on a Pb target. Data were collected in different
experimental campaigns and with different experimental se-
tups, taking advantage of the very convenient features of the
neutron beam, that make this facility particularly suitable for
measurements of neutron-induced fission cross sections [12].
In particular, the wide energy distribution of the neutron beam,
extending over more than ten orders of magnitude, allows one
to measure the fission cross section up to the GeV region.
Furthermore, the long flight path, close to 200 m, ensured a
good energy resolution at all energies.

The 238U(n,f)/ 235U(n,f) cross section ratio can be deter-
mined from the background-subtracted fission events C(En),
as a function of neutron energy, according to the following
expressions:

σ8(En)

σ5(En)
= C8(En)

C5(En)
× N5

N8
× �5

�8
× CF. (1)

Here the subscripts 8 and 5 refer to the 238U(n,f) and
235U(n,f) reactions, respectively, N is the areal density of
the samples used in the measurements (in atoms/b), � is
the detection efficiency for fission events, and CF accounts
for other corrections, in particular for the detection dead
time. It is important to note that the ratio does not depend
on either the shape or the absolute value of the neutron
flux, since the two samples, having the same diameter, are
measured simultaneously and in the same experimental setup,
i.e., are exposed to the same neutron flux. As a consequence,
the final uncertainties in the cross section ratio will mostly
be determined by the uncertainty on the areal density of the
two samples, and on the ratio of the efficiency and dead-time
corrections.

The data reported here were collected with two detection
systems: a fission ionization chamber (FIC), in which a single
fission fragment (FF) is detected, and an array of parallel plate
avalanche counters (PPACs), in which the two FFs are detected
in coincidence. This last detection system was used in two
geometrical configurations: one with the detectors mounted
perpendicularly to the neutron beam direction, and the other
(a tilted configuration) with the detectors at an angle of 45◦
relative to the neutron beam direction. A brief description of
the detectors and other experimental details is given below for
each setup, together with the systematic uncertainties affecting
the corresponding results. All data here reported were collected
with a large-aperture collimator (8 cm diameter). With such
an arrangement, the beam profile is essentially flat over the
surface of the samples, which were �8 cm in diameter. This
feature is of great advantage, since it minimizes the effect
of possible inhomogeneities of the fissile deposit. Another
important aspect of the n_TOF neutron beam regards the
neutron energy resolution in the range reported here. Above a
few MeV, this is dominated by the width of the proton beam,
of 6 ns (r.m.s.). Considering the long flight path of 185 m, the
energy resolution is better than 1% at 100 MeV, and reaches
slightly over 5% at 1 GeV.

A. The FIC chamber

The fast ionization chamber (FIC) used in the measurement
is described in detail in Ref. [13]. It is made of a stack of

ionization chambers mounted along the direction of the
neutron beam. Each cell consists of a central aluminum
electrode 100 μm thick, plated on both sides with the isotope
to be measured, and two external 15-μm-thick aluminum elec-
trodes. Different versions of the FIC were built. One of them,
the FIC1, was specifically built for measurements of highly
radioactive samples, and according to CERN regulations had
to comply with the ISO2919 standard, as a “sealed source.”
For this reason, the case was made in stainless steel, and the
chamber was equipped with thick stainless steel windows. The
second version of the ionization chamber, FIC2, was much
lighter and was directly coupled to the vacuum beam pipe, with
only a 125-μm-kapton window at the gas/vacuum interface.
For this reason, this second version was less sensitive to the
so-called γ -flash, i.e., the prompt signal caused in the detector
by spallation γ rays and relativistic particles. In both FIC1
and FIC2 chambers the gap between electrodes was 5 mm. All
chambers were operated with a gas mixture of 90% Ar and
10% CF4 at a pressure of 720 mbar. The detector signals were
amplified by a current feedback operational amplifier AD844
and digitized with a flash analog-to-digital converter (FADC)
with 8-bit resolution and 250 MHz sampling rate. The fast
timing properties of the gas and of the front-end electronics
resulted in a fast signal with a typical rise time of 40 ns and a
fall time of 120 ns.

Two different measurements of the 238U/ 235U fission cross
section ratio were performed with FIC1 and FIC2, respectively.
In both measurements, the chambers were positioned at
approximately 190 m downstream of the spallation target.
In the measurement with FIC1, two 235U and four 238U
samples were used. The samples were prepared by means of
the painting technique at the Institute of Physics and Power
Engineering, Obninsk, Russia, in form of the oxide U3O8.
The isotopic purity was checked via α spectroscopy and was
found to be better than 99% with only trace contaminations
of other U isotopes. The nonuniformity of the samples was
always between 5 and 10%. The deposit of fissile material
was 8 cm in diameter, while the areal density of each
sample was between 6 × 10−7 and 8 × 10−7 atoms/b, with
a specified mass uncertainty of ∼1.3% (Table I). Due to a
large γ -flash signal with a tail extending over a long time, it

was not possible to collect useful data with this setup above
10 MeV. These results, on the other hand, are affected by
a small systematic uncertainty on the mass of each sample,
and possible inhomogeneities of the samples are averaged out
when combining the different samples. Therefore, these data
were used as the basis for the normalization of the second
dataset, otherwise affected by larger systematic uncertainties,
as explained below.

The second setup used in the measurement consisted of the
FIC2 chamber, inside which two 235U and one 238U samples
were mounted. All three samples were 5 cm in diameter. The
areal density of the two 235U samples was around 6 × 10−7
atoms/b, while a much thicker 238U sample, of 2.6 × 10−6
atoms/b was used in this second setup, to collect sufficient
statistics below the fission threshold as well. The uncertainty
on the mass of this last sample was >3%, and no information
was available on the homogeneity of the deposit. For this
reason, the data collected with this setup had to be normalized
to the results obtained with the FIC1 chamber, in the 1–10 MeV
neutron energy region. The characteristics of all samples used
in the measurement with the fission ionization chamber are
listed in Table I.

For the FIC2 chamber, an electronic compensation tech-
nique was applied in order to extract the FF signals from the tail
of the γ -flash at short time-of-flights, i.e., for neutron energies
above approximately 10 MeV. The technique is based on the
observation that the shape of the γ -flash signal is similar for
contiguous electrodes. Therefore, by subtracting the output of
two consecutive electrodes, one of them without sample, it is
possible to extract clear fission fragment signals. The presence
of a residual tail related to the γ -flash required a more careful
reconstruction procedure, with the threshold on the amplitude
varying as a function of the neutron energy. The maximum
energy reached with this procedure was around 200 MeV.
More details on the performance of the detectors, in particular
the separation between FF and α particles, can be found in
Refs. [13,14].

In order to extract the neutron energy from the measured
time-of-flight, a calibration was performed using the reso-
nances in the 235U(n,f ) cross section. Corrections for the
neutron beam attenuation in the samples and electrodes, and
for the divergence of the beam profile, were estimated to be less
than 1%, and were therefore neglected. Similarly, corrections
for the sample inhomogeneities were considered negligible, in
particular since the n_TOF neutron beam, for the large aperture
collimator, shows a nearly flat spatial profile. Corrections had
to be applied for the detection efficiency and for dead time
effects. The efficiency corrections were applied only to the
FIC1 data, which were used for normalization. The efficiency,
estimated by means of detailed FLUKA simulations [15] of
the energy deposition in the gas as a function of the threshold,
was found to be 94.9% and 96.2% for the thin 235U and
238U samples mounted in FIC1, respectively. Contrary to the
efficiency, dead-time corrections had to be applied to both
FIC1 and FIC2 data, since they depend both on the sample and
neutron energy. Such corrections, based on the nonparalyzable
model, were below 5% in the whole neutron energy range for
both thin samples, while it reached ∼10% for the thick 238U
sample used in FIC2.

B. The PPAC setup

At very high energies, the fission cross section measure-
ments were carried out with the PPAC setup. The detectors,
which are described in detail in Refs. [16,17], are characterized
by very thin windows, small gaps between electrodes (3 mm)
and low pressure of the gas. These features make the detector
practically insensitive to the prompt γ -flash. Furthermore, the
signals produced by the FF are very fast, less than 10 ns
in width, so that the pile-up probability is very small. Most
importantly, the very fast timing combined with the low
sensitivity of the detectors to the γ -flash, allows one to record
signals at very short time-of-flights, or equivalently at very
high neutron energies, nominally up to 1 GeV.

A stack of PPACs was placed in the n_TOF beam for
measuring FF in coincidence. The actinide samples were
deposited on very thin backings and positioned between two
PPACs. The main advantage of the coincidence technique is
the very high efficiency for rejecting the α-particle background
related to the natural radioactivity of the samples, as well
as for discriminating fission against competing reactions, in
particular high-energy neutron-induced reactions on the PPAC
structural material, producing recoiling nuclei and charged
particles inside the detectors. The performance of the PPACs,
in particular in terms of discrimination of FF from α particles
and other reaction products, and the fast recovery time of the γ -
flash, are discussed in detail in Ref. [18]. Another advantage of
PPACs is that they can also supply information on the angular
distribution of fission fragments. Each cathode consists of
2-mm-wide strips to provide a one-dimensional position in-
formation. By combining the signals from orthogonal cathode
strips, the fission fragment trajectory can be determined,
allowing to reconstruct the emission angle. The main drawback
of the system is a limited angular acceptance, since at relatively
large angles one of the fragments loses a large fraction of its
energy in the sample backing and in the entrance windows
of the detectors, either being stopped before reaching the
gas volume, or falling below the detection threshold. While
the single fragment detection technique, used in the FIC
detectors, is characterized by an efficiency for detecting the
single fragment close to 100% (since the fragment has only to
escape from the deposit of fissile material), in the coincidence
technique the efficiency for grazing trajectories drops rapidly,
going to zero for emission angles larger than ∼60◦, the exact
limiting angle depending on the thickness of the sample
backing.

In the first experimental campaign at n_TOF the PPAC
detectors were mounted in the neutron beam perpendicularly
to the beam direction. Hereafter we will refer to this con-
figuration as “PPAC perpendicular.” In this configuration the
setup is affected by a loss of efficiency for FF emitted at
angles larger than ∼60◦. To overcome the problem of the
limited angular coverage, a new geometrical configuration was
adopted at n_TOF in the second experimental campaign, with
the detectors and the samples mounted at 45◦ relative to the
neutron beam direction. A scheme of the tilted configuration
can be found in [17,19]. Two measurements were performed
with the tilted setup, hereafter referred to as “PPAC tilted 1”
and “PPAC tilted 2.”

In all PPAC measurements the samples, prepared at IN2P3-
Orsay, were 8 cm in diameter, with the fissile material
electrodeposited on thin aluminum foils 2.0 and 0.7 μm
in thickness in the first two and in the third measurement,
respectively. The characteristics of the samples used in the
first two cases are listed in Table II. The mass of the samples
was determined by means of α counting. For the 235U sample,
the impurities were determined by mass spectrometry, which
provided the atom ratios of 0.0628(1) and 7.472(15) × 10−3
for the 238U/ 235U and 234U/ 235U, respectively. The latter has
been used to extract the total mass of 235U from the measured
α activity. The 238U sample was of very high purity, as it
was produced by magnetic separation from natural uranium.
The homogeneity of the deposits was checked by α scan-
ning, for the 235U sample, and by Rutherford backscattering
spectroscopy (RBS) for the 235U and 238U samples. RBS also
provided the chemical composition of samples and backings.
Apart from the contamination of 238U in the 235U sample, taken
into account in the analysis, only trace concentrations of other
isotopes were found in the samples (see Refs. [16,20]). The
samples of the last measurement (PPAC tilted 2) have not been
characterized with the necessary accuracy. As a consequence,
this last dataset has been normalized to the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluated ratio between 3 and 5 MeV.

In both configurations, a correction had to be applied
for the loss of efficiency related to the stopping of one of
the fission fragments in the sample backing. Because of the
angular dependence of the efficiency, the fission fragment
angular distribution (FFAD) had to be considered. To this
end, corrections were calculated, by means of Monte Carlo
simulations, on the basis of existing experimental results on
the FFAD as a function of the neutron energy, reported in
the EXFOR database for both isotopes [21]. More details
on the procedure can be found in Refs. [16,20]. The FFAD
is expressed as the sum of even Legendre polynomials in
terms of the cosine of the emission angle (because of the
forward-backward symmetry of the emitted FFs). In this work,
polynomials up to second order only were considered, as
there is no reliable information in literature about higher
order coefficients. The energy-dependent coefficients were
determined from the so-called anisotropy parameter, A(E),
defined as the ratio between the emission probability of the FF
at 0 and 90◦, W (E,0◦)/W (E,90◦). The angular anisotropy of
235U and 238U was obtained by fitting the available literature
data in the EXFOR database [21] up to ∼20 and 100 MeV
neutron energy in the case of 235U and 238U, respectively.
Above those energies, the anisotropy was assumed to approach
unity asymptotically. The data and the results of the fit are
shown in Fig. 1.

polynomials.

various structures in the efficiency ratio corresponds to the structures
in the angular anisotropy of FF emission in the two reactions.

The detection efficiency of the PPAC setup as a function of
the FF emission angle is shown in Fig. 2 for the perpendicular
and tilted configurations. The figure clearly shows the dif-
ference between the two configurations: in the perpendicular
case, the efficiency is flat up to a given angle (around ∼60◦),
and drops to zero above this limit. On the contrary, in the tilted
configuration all FF emission angles are covered. The gain
in efficiency at large angles is obviously compensated by a
reduction of the efficiency at smaller angles, due to the cut in
the azimuthal angle related to the stopping of the fragments
in the dead layers (sample backing and PPAC windows). As
expected, the global efficiency, i.e., the efficiency integrated
over the polar angle, is nearly the same in both perpendicular
and tilted configuration, but the latter has the advantage of a
smaller influence of the angular anisotropy of FF emission.

The analysis of the tilted configuration is described in great
detail in Refs. [17,22,23]. Several conditions were applied
in order to identify the fission fragments, reconstruct the
trajectory of each fragment, and reject all possible sources
of background. The efficiency corrections obtained by Monte
Carlo simulations [22] were confirmed by means of a method
based exclusively on experimental data [23]. Contrary to the

perpendicular configuration, a dependence of the efficiency
on the polar angle has to be taken into account, together with
other effects related to the viewing angle of the sample by the
detectors.

As shown in Eq. (1), the cross section ratio depends on the
ratio of the efficiency for detecting a fission event from the
235U and the 238U samples respectively. The ratio is shown
in Fig. 3, for the two different configurations. In both cases,
the correction is of at most 4%. The systematic uncertainties
affecting the various PPAC measurements, as well as the
measurement with the FIC, are listed in Table III.

indicated by the solid line. We remind that for neutron energies
below 20 MeV a wealth of data are available in the literature,
with the standard cross sections of both isotopes characterized
by an uncertainty of less than 1%. Therefore the very good
agreement between n_TOF results and the ENDF/B-VII.1
evaluations, evident in Fig. 4, provides strong confidence in
the accuracy of the new data, in particular in the systematic
uncertainty related to the sample mass and in the efficiency
corrections. Some minor differences can nevertheless be
noticed in the figure, in particular around 12 MeV neutron
energy, where the dip corresponding to a valley in the 238U(n,f)
cross section is less pronounced in the n_TOF dataset, relative
to ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation. Another minor difference can be
observed around the 238U fission threshold, slightly above 1
MeV. In this region, the n_TOF data are systematically shifted
to higher energies, possibly indicating that the fission threshold
in the evaluation needs to be increased by a small amount.

Figure 5 shows the results of the four different measure-
ments at n_TOF, from 500 keV to 1 GeV (the data are
reported in Table IV). The error bars on the symbols indicate
only counting statistics uncertainties. Above 20 MeV some
differences can be observed between the various results. In
particular, the FIC results are systematically lower than all
the PPAC ones. Among the PPAC data, the results obtained
in the first measurement with the tilted configuration are
systematically higher than the other two datasets, with the
difference becoming more pronounced above ∼500 MeV. It
should be noticed, however, that all differences are well within
the combined uncertainties of the present results, related to
independent systematic effects.

Each of the four datasets collected at n_TOF represents a
new result by itself, and should be considered independently
from each other, for example in re-evaluating the fission cross
section ratio. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this paper it may

be convenient to combine all four datasets. To this end,
a weighted average was performed. Since the uncertainties
due to systematic effects are similar in magnitude for the
different datasets, only the uncorrelated uncertainties due to
counting statistics were taken into account. The ratio obtained
with this procedure can be more easily compared with data
from previous measurements, as well as with evaluations
and theoretical calculations. Moreover, it can be used to
analyze the dispersion of the n_TOF datasets to draw further
conclusions on their accuracy. This last point is illustrated
in Fig. 6, which shows the divergence of the n_TOF results
from their weighted average, as functions of neutron energy.
Except for some details, the difference in all cases is within
the ∼3% systematic uncertainty associated with each dataset.
(In the crude approximation adopted here, neglecting possible
correlations between some datasets, the systematic uncertainty
on the weighted average is around 1% up to 200 MeV,
and between 1 and 2% above this energy.) This observation
provides further strength on the accuracy of the present results.

Comparison with previous results, evaluations,
and model predictions

The n_TOF fission cross section ratio discussed above
is compared with the two major datasets extending to high
energy in Fig. 7 (the data from Nolte et al. [7] are not shown
because of their large uncertainties). Very good agreement
is found with the data of Lisowski et al. [4] and with the
current ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation all the way up to 200 MeV,
definitely ruling out the lower values reported by Shcherbakov
et al. [6]. Above this value, the n_TOF data seem to maintain

a constant or slightly increasing trend, contrary to the data of
Lisowski et al., which seem to indicate the start of a decline
in the higher energy points.

Some important information on the fission mechanism
at high energy can be extracted from the comparison of the
present data with the results of recent theoretical calculations
of the fission cross sections of various actinides at high energy.
More details on the calculations can be found in [24]. The
aim of the work was to provide a way to estimate fission cross
sections in the neutron energy range above 100 MeV, where
no (or very few) reliable data exist. This is also the case for the
fission cross section ratio discussed here. In the energy range
200 MeV–1 GeV considered in this work, model calculations
were performed in order to estimate the absolute cross sections
and, consequently, their ratio, to be compared with the present
data. In Ref. [24], (p,f) and (n,f) cross sections were evaluated
for both isotopes in the energy range 100 MeV–1 GeV using
the intranuclear cascade code INCL++ [25] coupled to the
evaporation-fission code GEMINI++ [26]. Two parameters
in the fission model were optimized to reproduce the (p,f)
cross sections measured in Ref. [27] from 200 MeV to 1
GeV (see Ref. [24] for details). The corresponding (n,f)
cross sections were evaluated without further adjustment of
model parameters, because the models already account for the
observed differences in (p,f) and (n,f) cross sections around
200 MeV, while protons and neutrons are expected to have
similar behavior with increasing incident energy and the fission
cross sections to be of the same order of magnitude around
1 GeV. Such an assumption made it possible to reproduce also
the (n,f) data from 100 MeV to 200 MeV, even if the conditions

Ref. [24].

of validity of the intranuclear cascade model are poorly
satisfied at such relatively low energies. The theoretical cross
sections are affected by statistical errors inherent in the Monte
Carlo technique, which propagate to their ratios and have to be
considered in the comparison with the experiment. The results
of the model calculations, which are show in Fig. 7 by the
light-blue curve, are in good agreement with present data at all
energies. Although some systematic effects in the calculations
may be at least partially compensated in the cross section ratio,
the good agreement indicates that the theoretical treatment
of Lo Meo et al. might be adequate for predicting the fission
cross section of actinides above 100 MeV neutron energy.

More evidences in this respect could come from additional
fission studies at n_TOF up to 1 GeV.

A more quantitative comparison between the 238U/ 235U
fission cross section ratio measured at n_TOF and evaluations
or model calculation is shown in Fig. 8. For completeness, the
present results are also compared with the libraries JEFF3.2
and JENDL-HE-2007 [5]. While the former contains data
only up to 30 MeV, the latter extends up to 3 GeV, being in
fact the only library reporting evaluated cross sections above
200 MeV. While ENDF/B-VII.1 and the INCL++/GEMINI++
predictions agree, within 2%, with the present result, a
relatively large difference exists with respect to the JEFF3.2
library, in the whole energy region from threshold to 30 MeV. A
reasonable agreement is observed relative to JENDL-HE-2007
at all energies, although a strange behaviour is observed around
∼300 MeV, with the ratio of the evaluated cross sections sud-
denly increasing above this energy. A final consideration can be
made regarding the energy region around the fission threshold
of 238U. A difference is observed relative to all major libraries,
although not always in the same direction, possibly indicating
a slight under- or overestimate of the threshold energy.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The 238U/ 235U fission cross section ratio has been mea-
sured at n_TOF, for the first time up to 1 GeV, with two different
detection systems, one of which was used in two different
geometrical configurations. The results of the measurements
agree with each other within the estimated systematic uncer-
tainty of approximately 3%. Furthermore, the results are in all
cases in agreement with evaluated cross sections and standard
values between 0.5 and 20 MeV, thus providing confidence
in their accuracy. The results have been combined in order
to obtain a unique dataset for comparison with previous
results and evaluations, up to 200 MeV, and with theoretical
calculations based on the intranuclear cascade model coupled
with an evaporation-fission code, all the way up to 1 GeV. The
extracted ratio rules out the results of Shcherbakov et al., and is
in very good agreement both with ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation,
up to 200 MeV, and with theoretical calculations up to 1 GeV.
Some differences are instead observed between present data
and other major libraries. These results could be used to
improve the accuracy of current libraries, and in particular
of the standard used in a variety of applications.
