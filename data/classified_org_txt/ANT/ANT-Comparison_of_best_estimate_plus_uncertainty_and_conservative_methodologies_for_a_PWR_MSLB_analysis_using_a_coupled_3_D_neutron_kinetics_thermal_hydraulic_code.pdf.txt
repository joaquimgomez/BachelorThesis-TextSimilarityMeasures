ABSTRACT 
 
This paper provides a comparison between the Best Estimate plus Uncertainty 
methodology with the Conservative Bounding methodology for Design Basis 
Accident analysis. Calculations have been performed with TRACE (for thermal-
hydraulic system calculations) and PARCS (for neutron-kinetics modeling) under 
SNAP platform. DAKOTA is used under the SNAP interface for uncertainty and 
sensitivity analysis. A simplified 3D neutronics model of the ASCO II NPP is 
used as core kinetic model. The thermal-hydraulic model is a 1D representation of 
the primary and secondary systems except for the vessel that is represented by a 
3D VESSEL component. The design basis transient selected for the comparison is 
a Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) in a PWR. This transient is characterized by 
space-time effects and requires coupled 3D kinetics and thermal-hydraulics 
modeling, especially for the re-criticality scenario. The comparison methodology 
is as follows. Once the models are created, a Best Estimate Base Case Calculation 
(BEBCC) is performed. The model is modified by selecting the most important 
parameters and assigning conservative values to them in order to obtain a 
Conservative Calculation. Several parameters are modified in this conservative 
way. These parameters are then perturbed in Best Estimate Plus Uncertainties 
(BEPU) calculations. At the end, a comparison is made between results obtained 
in the Conservative Calculation and the BEPU methodology respectively. As a 
general conclusion the BEPU method has been successfully illustrated in coupled 
3D kinetics and thermal-hydraulics system. Also the study it is an effective test 
for the adequacy of nodalizations for the utilized codes both neutronic and 
thermal-hydraulic. BEPU methodology gives more margins, which allow for 
higher operational flexibility of the plant. Results of BEPU methodology help 
improve plant economics while meeting the safety standards. As a conclusion, the 
BEPU methodology is been successfully tested in NK-TH calculations. Narrow 
margins between upper and lower BEPU case are consequence of few perturbed 
parameters chosen and the transient boundary conditions.

Comparison of BEPU and conservative methodologies for PWR MSLB analysis using a coupled 3DNK-TH  R. Pericas 

1. INTRODUCTION 
  

Conservative nuclear safety margins limit the present industrial need of increasing Nuclear 
Power Plant (NPP) electricity output. Best Estimate Plus Uncertainties (BEPU) techniques are 
superior to the old conservative methodology, where the safety margins are established by 
experts under operation hypotheses and conservative assumptions. The BEPU methodology is 
capable of providing a solution in terms of increasing the nuclear power production without 
compromising the safety margins. This paper exemplifies a comparison between the BEPU 
methodology and the Conservative Bounding methodology, as applied to a particular accidental 
scenario. 
 
The transient selected for the comparison is a Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) in a Pressurized 
Water Reactor (PWR). The failure of a main steam line results in an initial increase in the steam 
flow, which decreases afterwards driven by the secondary pressure reduction. The break in the 
secondary causes a reduction in primary system coolant (moderator) temperature and pressure. In 
the presence of a large negative moderator temperature coefficient, the excess cooling results in a 
reduction of the core shutdown margin. If the most reactive control rod bundle remains on its 
fully out position, after the reactor SCRAM, it is possible that the reactor becomes critical and 
relatively high power is achieved locally in the vicinity of the place where the most reactive 
control rod should have been inserted. The core critically is finally stopped by the injection of 
boric acid discharged from the safety injection system. 
 
To perform the comparison between the two methodologies, first a Best Estimate Base Case 
Calculation (BEBCC) is performed followed by BEPU calculations with a selection of perturbed 
parameters. Such selection is made by following the recommendations of Priority Identification 
and Ranking Tables (PIRTs), OECD/NRC PWR MSLB benchmark project report [1] and 
CRISSUE [2] project guidelines. A Conservative Calculation is done by assigning conservative 
values to these parameters. At the end, a comparison is made between the predictions of 
Conservative and BEPU methodologies. 
 
The calculations have been made using the following tools: TRACE [3] for thermal-hydraulic 
system calculations, PARCS [4] for reactor physics modeling and DAKOTA [5] for uncertainty 
and sensitivity analysis.  
 
2. MODELS 

 
Nuclear system coupled calculations involve at least two codes: a Neutron Kinetics (NK) code to 
simulate the core behavior, and a thermal-hydraulic (TH) code to model the coolant system. In 
this section, the NK and TH models developed with PARCS and TRACE for this study are 
described. 

 
2.1. TRACE model 

 
Ascó NPP is a 3 loops 2900 MW PWR. TRACE model reproduces the whole Nuclear Steam 
Supply System. TRACE V5 patch2 is the version of the code used in the present study. The 
model developed has been validated with an actual 50% loss of load transient [6] in this process 
it has been benchmarked against other TH models [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] widely used in Universitat

Politècnica de Barcelona group. In a coupled NK-TH code calculation, the most relevant part of 
the thermal-hydraulic model is the reactor vessel. A 3D VESSEL TRACE component represents 
the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) in the model. The vessel model has 15 axial layers, 6 
azimuthal sectors and 5 radial rings. Three axial levels represent the lower plenum; six axial 
levels represent the active core region, the down comer and the bypass; the top levels model the 
upper head and the upper plenum. Figure 1 shows an axial layout of the vessel representation. 
The axial core region (lighter area) is subdivided radially for each layer in 18 TH cells formed by 
overlapping three rings and six sectors. Outer rings represent the down comer and the bypass. 
The height of each active core axial node is 0.609 m. The total active core axial height is 3.654 
m. The rest of the plant model is a 1D representation of each of the three loops, with the 
pressurizer `connected to one of the loops. Three main steam lines are modeled in the secondary 
circuit representation. Main Feed Water and Auxiliary Feed Water systems are also modeled for 
each loop. In terms of safety injection systems, the three accumulators are modeled. The Low 
Pressure Injection System (LPIS) and High Pressure Injection System (HPIS) injection nozzles 
are simulated by means of FILL components. A control block system with more than 700 
components is included with the aim to reproduce with accuracy the plant response to different 
transients.

The core neutronics is modeled with PARCS v3.0. Each of the 157 fuel assemblies (all of them with a 
17x17 pin array) is represented by one node in the radial plane. In total there are 221 nodes per axial 
level because 64 additional nodes are used to describe the reflector. Axially the fuel region is divided 
in 24 + 2 nodes, 24 for the core active region and 2 for the bottom and top reflectors. The height of the 
nodes is large in the central region and smaller in the lower and upper regions, in order to reproduce 
with more accuracy the flux and thus cross-section variation along the core length.  
 
The cross section library, that considers the different types of fuel and burn-ups, and accounts for the 6 

control rod banks, contains 648 + 2 different compositions. 648 refers to different kind of fuel 
while +2 refers to bottom/top and side reflectors. The two-group cross-section library has been 
generated with HELIOS-1.9 [12] using plant specifications [13]. 

 
 

 
Figure 2. Radial core assembly layout 

Figure 2 shows the fuel assemblies (FA) radial distribution in the core. There are 27 different 
types of FA with different enrichments (ranging from 2.1% to 4.55%). The newest FA contain 
burnable absorbers with varying Gd2O3 concentration from 2.0% to 8.0% depending on the FA. 
Cross-section library has been generated as a function of moderator temperature, fuel 
temperature, moderator density, boron concentration and control rods insertion. Extended ranges 
of change of the thermal-hydraulic feedback parameters have been selected in order to cover 
both initial steady-state and expected transient conditions.    
 
 
 2.3 Coupled model 
 
The thermal-hydraulic model has been set up so as to meet the requirements of the neutronics 
model. There are 157 Heat Structures (HS) in the core region, each one representing one FA.

There are 18 radial thermal-hydraulic cells in each axial thermal-hydraulic layer in the core 
region. Figure 3 shows the assignment (mapping) in a radial plane of the active core and reflector 
TH cells to neutronics nodes. Every different color area represents a thermal-hydraulic cell. 
Regarding axial nodalization, the 24 non-equidistant axial nodes of the neutronics model are 
equivalent to those of the HS; however, only 6 nodes exist in the hydraulic model. Consequently 
the axial mapping between the HS and neutronics nodes is one to one, whereas several neutronic 
and HS nodes are linked to one single thermal-hydraulic node. Such thermal-hydraulic 
nodalization was chosen in order to be consistent with the previous works made with the non-
coupled systems and also in order to easy compare with previous cases. Faster computing times 
were also among the reasons of such nodalization choice.

3.  EVENT DESCRIPTION 
 
A hypothetical MSLB is the transient chosen for the comparison of methodologies. The initiating 
event is a double ended break in the main steam line in loop 2. Right after the break, the high 
differential pressure between the steam lines causes the activation of the high pressure injection 
systems. At the same time the turbine and the reactor are shut down. Power during the transient 
gets reduced due SCRAM and safety injection systems. For this analysis it is postulated that a 
control rod remains stuck out during the scram. The asymmetric heat transfer to the secondary 
caused by the broken loop translates into temperature and coolant density asymmetries in the 
primary system. These density asymmetries are propagated into the core. Although some mixing 
occurs in the lower plenum, colder water circulates through the core region where the control rod 
remains on its fully withdrawn position, while SCRAM signal is on. Even when there is an 
increase of the total reactivity, mainly due to the density changes of the coolant (moderator) and

to the fact that one of the control rods has not been inserted, the power stays low and decreases 
quickly, as it can be seen in Figure 4. Total reactivity contributing components are shown in 
Figure 5.

4.  CONSERVATIVE CASE CALCULATION 
 
In order to check the adequacy of the Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) methodology, a 
Best Estimate Base Case Calculation (BEBCC) by using some conservative assumptions for 
important input parameters in order to ensure conservative calculation has been performed to be 
used as a reference for comparison purposes. Essentially, the conservative calculation differs 
from the (BEBCC) because some conservative assumptions are made in order to ensure the 
safety margins [14]. These conservative assumptions are related to boundary conditions Table 1. 
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the total power and the total reactivity evolution for the conservative 
calculation.  Conservative results, as expected, provide a less pronounced fall of power and 
reactivity than the BEBCC case.

5.  BEST ESTIMATE PLUS UNCERTAINTY CALCULATIONS 
 
The first of the BEPU calculations is a BE base case calculation, which consists on assuming that 
all the parameters have their nominal values. This calculation is done by first letting the coupled 
model achieve steady state and then initiating the transient event. Table 2 summarizes the most 
relevant events as simulated in the BE base case. Figures 4 and 5 show the evolution of power 
and reactivity for the BEBCC and in comparison with the conservative calculation.

For the uncertainty methodology, DAKOTA is applied after the BE transient computations.  The 
general sequence of steps for performing an Uncertainty Analysis in a best-estimate model is 
outlined below:  

1. Specify Uncertainty Analysis input such as sampling method, number of samples, etc.  
2. Select the set of input parameters to be modified.  
3. Assign probability distributions and range of variation to each input parameter.  
4. Generate the sets of random variables.  
5. Generate an input file for each set of random variables  
6. Execute each case.  
7. Extract response data from each case run.  
8. Calculate uncertainty and sensitivity results.  
9. Compile a report summarizing the Uncertainty Analysis  

Some of the steps (like the selection of input parameters, definition and assignment of 
probability distributions, and input requirements given to the DAKOTA software such as the 
sampling method, number of samples, and the random seed) are user defined quantities. Other 
steps from the above list are the result of the calculations with the DAKOTA Uncertainty 
package.  

The authors of the paper have compiled a list of one hundred thermal-hydraulic parameters plus 
forty neutronic parameters, which are relevant to PWR MSLB analysis, to be used as modified 
parameters in a BEPU calculation. Such list has been reduced based on Phenomena 
Identification and Ranking Tables (PIRTs), CRISSUE [2] reports and experts conclusions to a 
list of twenty two relevant parameters. Twelve thermal-hydraulic parameters and ten neutronic 
parameters are representative of the most relevant parameters to the MSLB transient in a PWR. 
The Tables 3 and 4 show the list of the twelve thermal-hydraulic parameters and ten neutronic 
parameters. Each table contains mean values for each parameter, Probability Density Functions 
(PDFs), standard deviations, Maximum and Minimum values in case there are any. In addition 
the reference [15] has been used to determine the parameters and their associated probability 
density functions.

Previous to the DAKOTA analysis and under the SNAP interface, an Extract Data step is 
required in order to retrieve data from coupled calculations and prepare them to be read and 
treated by DAKOTA. Extract Data step, where the data from the BEPU calculations is taken 
from the calculation data base to the DAKOTA procedure step, bridges the gap between analysis 
code outputs and the DAKOTA uncertainty input.

Every parameter from the tables above is treated by DAKOTA, under the specifications given by 
the user. After author’s choices, DAKOTA gives to every parameter a different value for each 
case calculation. The new values depend on the PDFs and on the standard deviation of each 
initial parameter value. Figure 9 illustrates the wide range of selected values for the rod insertion 
time in this case. Notice that all the values oscillate around one mean value of 2.2 seconds in this 
case.  

 

Figure 8. Illustration of the randomness of the uncertainty simulation. 

 

The Uncertainty Analysis methodology uses Wilks [16, 17] method for computing sample sizes. 
The method is used to determine a number of random samplings that must be made to assure a 
certain degree of confidence that a given probable range of inputs have been covered. In order to 
illustrate the methodology, for the present calculations, 95% of probability and 95% of 
confidence have been considered.  Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the total reactivity distribution 
and total core power distribution against time, for the 59 cases used in the BEPU methodology.

6.  COMPARARING BEPU with CONSERVATIVE CALCULATION 
 
Finally, BEPU calculations are compared to the Conservative Case calculation in order to 
provide an insight into the advantages of the former methodology. BEPU calculations provide a 
range of values covering the 5 to the 95 percentile with 95% confidence (in this case) for each 
time step of the calculation, such range has been compared with conservative calculation in 
Figure 11. BEBCC is plotted in the same figure, such calculation falls within the BEPU margins.

The power time evolution figure has been omitted due to the narrowest BEPU margins in it. 
Same comparison can be done in terms of the local temperature. This comparison will be more 
interesting if it is done for the region where the control rod remains stuck out. The peak 
temperatures in this core region will rise higher and the comparison between BEPU, BE and 
conservative methodologies will be more significant there.

8.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
The general conclusion of this study is that the introduced BEPU method has been successfully 
illustrated. The study shows the interactions between thermal-hydraulic and neutron-kinetic 
codes in the context of BEPU analysis. The study is an effective test for the adequacy of 
nodalizations for the utilized codes both neutronic and thermal-hydraulic. While multi-physics 
approaches are still pending of specific developments, this work helps checking the 
consolidation of crucial aspects like the interface between codes. The development shows a 
maturity in combining core with system behavior. From now on, further development can focus 
on pending aspects. A second general conclusion can be found in the consistency between the 
results of BEPU calculations compared with conservative ones. Several additional conclusions 
are obtained from the comparison of the two methodologies used in the paper: Conservative and 
BEPU. The first conclusion is concerning the width of the BEPU range: such range of values 
seems to be very narrow. Increasing the number of modified parameters in the BEPU 
methodology and redefining some of the PDFs will lead to a wide range of values into the BEPU 
range; this applies as well to neutronic parameter, not considered in the present uncertainty 
calculations. More global parameters than total power and total reactivity could be compared but 
since this paper aims to illustrate the methodology, the authors agreed to limit the number of 
uncertain parameters. BEBCC falls into the middle of the BEPU calculations as it was expected. 
In terms of the total reactivity, the comparison between Conservative Case and Best Estimate 
Plus Uncertainties calculation concludes that the BEPU methodology gives more margin, and

will probably allow for higher operational flexibility of the plant, which can be helpful to 
improve plant economics while meeting the safety standards. Further works might show higher 
safety margins in terms of wider BEPU bands. Different transient analysis such anticipated 
transients without SCRAM or any transient where asymmetries (in terms of fluxes) in the core 
are relevant will reinforce the use of BEPU methodology with thermal-hydraulics and neutron 
kinetics coupled calculations.
