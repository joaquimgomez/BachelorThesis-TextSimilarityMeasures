Background: β-delayed multiple neutron emission has been observed for some nuclei with A≤100,
being the 100Rb the heaviest β2n emitter measured to date. So far, only 25 P2n values have
been determined for the ≈300 nuclei that may decay in this way. Accordingly, it is of interest to
measure P2n values for the other possible multiple neutron emitters throughout the chart of the
nuclides. It is of particular interest to make such measurement for nuclei with A>100 to test the
predictions of theoretical models and simulation tools for the decays of heavy nuclei in the region of
very neutron-rich nuclei. In addition, the decay properties of these nuclei are fundamental for the
understanding of astrophysical nucleosynthesis processes such as the r-process, and safety inputs
for nuclear reactors.
Purpose: To determine for the first time the two neutron branching ratio, P2n value, for

136Sb
through a direct neutron measurement, and to provide precise P1n values for

136Sb and 136Te.
Method: A pure beam of each isotope of interest was provided by the JYFLTRAP Penning trap
at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility of the University of Jyväskylä,
Finland. The purified ions were implanted into a moving tape at the end of the beam line.
The detection setup consisted of a plastic scintillator placed right behind the implantation point
after the tape to register the β-decays, and the BELEN detector, based on neutron counters
embedded in a polyethylene matrix. The analysis was based on the study of the β- and neutron-
growth-and-decay curves and the β-one-neutron and β-two-neutron time correlations, which allowed
us the determination of the neutron-branching ratios.
Results: The P2n value of

136Sb was found to be 0.14(3)% and the measured P1n values for
136Sb

and 136Te were found to be 32.2(15)% and 1.47(6)%, respectively.
Conclusions: The measured P2n value is a factor 44 smaller than predicted by the finite-range
droplet model plus the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (FRDM+QRPA) model used for
r-process calculations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The β decay Q value (Qβ value) increases when going
towards neutron-rich nuclei in the chart of nuclides.
This makes β− decay the dominant decay mode for this
region. In very neutron-rich nuclei, the emission of one

or more neutrons may also occur after a β-decay. This
process of β-delayed neutron (βn) emission was discov-
ered in 1939 by Roberts et al. [1] and is energetically
allowed when the Qβn value is positive, i.e. the Qβ value
of the decay exceeds the neutron separation energy (Sn)
of the daughter nucleus. This phenomenon becomes
dominant when the populated state in the daughter
nucleus, following the β-decay, is higher in excitation
energy than Sn, which gets lower going towards neutron-
rich nuclei in the chart of nuclides. When the populated

states lie even higher than the two-neutron separation
energy, S2n, i.e. Qβ2n > 0, two neutron emission may
also occur. This phenomenon was predicted in 1960
by Goldansky [2]. The first studies of multiple-neutron
emission were carried out in the 1980s in which detection
of two-neutron emission was observed for nuclei up to
mass A=33 and predictions for the emission of three
neutrons were made for masses around A=100 [3]. The
β-delayed two-neutron (β2n) emission probability, P2n
value, has only been experimentally determined for 25
isotopes (two of them only approximations) [4] of out of
≈300 potential multiple neutron emitter candidates [5].
The importance of providing more precise data for
neutron emitting isotopes has been highlighted by the
IAEA Coordinated Research Projects in Refs. [6] and
on β-delayed neutron emission evaluation [7]. The
latter emphasizes the importance of these data for
safety improvement purposes for emerging nuclear
power reactors, as well as for astrophysical studies.
Indeed, these experimental data, involving isotopes in
the neutron-rich region, are needed to achieve a better
knowledge of the “freeze-out” of the rapid neutron
capture (r-process) [8] when theoretical calculations of
nucleosynthesis [9–11] are applied. The delayed neutron
emission is an important input for these models as it
shifts the final isobaric solar system abundances of some
species to lower masses, and introduces neutrons in the
stellar environment that can be re-captured by other
nuclei at later stages. This is of special interest in the
regions of the r-abundance peaks such as A≈130 near
the doubly-magic 132Sn isotope (N=82 and Z=50). Up
to now, the Pn data available for the heavy mass region
is scarce, especially above A = 150 [12], and non-existent
for multiple neutron emitters above A = 100.

This paper presents a measurement of the P2n neu-
tron branching ratio for 136Sb. With a Qβ2n window
of 1884(6) keV [5], 136Sb has been suggested to be
a multiple-neutron emitter in several theoretical mod-
els [13–15] and by some experiments: these include esti-
mates based on the Finite Fermi-system theory [16] and
more recently an experiment involving several isotopes of
mass A = 136 in which the isobars could not be separated
well enough to determine their neutron branching ratios
precisely [17]. In order to get a successful measurement of
multiple β-delayed neutron emission, we used a high effi-
ciency neutron detector and a beam free from contamina-
tion of other isotopes. The pure 136Sb beam was obtained
with the Penning trap mass spectrometer, JYFLTRAP,
at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL)
facility [18, 19], located in the Accelerator Laboratory of
the University of Jyväskylä, Finland (JYFL). This con-
tribution describes the experimental setup in Section II,
the details of the data analysis following the methodology
reported in [20] and the results in Sec. III. A summary
and discussion are presented in Sec. IV, and the conclu-
sions are given in Sec. V.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experiment presented in this paper was carried
out at the IGISOL facility of JYFL. The isotopes of
interest were produced in nuclear fission induced with
a 25 MeV proton beam, with an intensity of around
7-10 µA, impinging on a natural uranium target. The
fission fragments produced were extracted from the
helium gas cell using a sextupole ion guide (SPIG) [21]
and differential pumping, accelerated to 30 keV and
mass-separated with a dipole magnet. The continuous
beam was cooled and bunched using an RFQ cooler-
buncher device [22] before injecting the ions into the
JYFLTRAP double Penning trap. The purification took
place in the first trap, where a mass-selective buffer gas
cooling technique [23] was employed to resolve different
isobars based on their cyclotron resonance frequencies
νc = qB/(2πm), where q and m are the charge and
the mass of the ion of interest and B is the magnetic
field strength inside the trap. The description and the
principles of the JYFLTRAP at IGISOL are reported in
Ref. [24], and Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref. [25] detail the layout
of the IGISOL facility.

In this experiment, pure ion beams of 95Rb, 137I, 136Te
and 136Sb were extracted from the trap without isobaric
contaminants and transported to the implantation sys-
tem. 95Rb and 137I were used for calibration purposes,
as their P1n values are well known from previous exper-
iments [26–28]. The implantation system consisted of a
moving magnetic tape placed inside an aluminum tube,
with a thickness of 1 mm and diameter of 46 mm, un-
der vacuum. This tube linked JYFLTRAP and the end
of the beamline, shown in Fig. 1. The moving tape sys-

tem allowed control of the ion-implantation (beam on)
and decay (beam off) times according to the half-life
of the isotope measured, in order to be able to repro-
duce the growth-and-decay curves in the analysis (see
Section III). The detection system in this experiment
consisted of a 3 mm-thick plastic scintillator β counter,
shown in Fig. 1 (bottom-right), placed at the end of the
vacuum tube, surrounded by the Beta dELayEd Neutron
(BELEN) detector [29–31]. The latter consisted of 48
3He counter tubes of 2.54 cm diameter manufactured by
LND Inc. [32], distributed in three concentric rings, and
embedded in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) matrix
to moderate the neutrons, see Fig. 2. BELEN was sur-
rounded by 20 cm of HDPE shielding in order to moder-
ate and absorb neutrons scattered from the surroundings
(see also Fig. 2). Table I summarizes its characteristics.

The version of the BELEN detector used in this exper-

of Monte Carlo MCNPX [33–36] and Geant4 [37, 38]
simulations in order to achieve a high and flat efficiency
detection in the range from 0.1−2 MeV (see Fig. 3). The
most important constraint was in terms of efficiency: for
the detection of two correlated neutrons, the efficiency,
ε2n, is roughly proportional to the square of the detection

To avoid a low detection probability the central hole
of BELEN was kept at 6 cm diameter, restricted to
the diameter size of the vacuum tube of the implanta-
tion system. With this geometry, BELEN reached a
one-neutron efficiency of ≈60%, and ≈36% for a two-
neutron event, in the Qβn energy range of the isotopes
of interest. The disadvantatge of this optimization
compared to other designs was the impossibility of
placing a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector right
behind the implantation point to verify the identity of
the isotope implanted by γ-ray detection. This latter
technique was used in the prior experiment during the
same experimental campaign with another version of the
BELEN detector, measuring isotopes in the same region
of the nuclear chart [40]. The one-neutron efficiency
for that version of BELEN detector was 40% in the
same energy range (0.1−2 MeV) due to a different
geometry, while using the same number of 3He neutron
counters. For the present work, the efficiency obtained
in the simulations, shown in Fig. 3, was experimentally
validated at En=2.13 MeV using a

252Cf source, and
with beams of isotopes with well-known P1n values, such
as 95Rb and 137I, as reported in Section III.

Previous experiments using the BELEN detector
demonstrated that it works well with the self-triggered
data acquisition system specifically implemented for BE-
LEN, named GASIFIC [20, 41]. This system integrates
all signals from the β- and the 3He neutron counters
recording their energy, and a time-stamp with a clock
of 10 ns resolution to be able to build the β-neutron
time-correlations over a certain time-window. In this



4

experimental campaign, differential to single-ended
converter modules, designed at JYFL, were added in the
electronic chain. This made possible to link the output
signals from the MPR-16-HV Mesytec preamplifiers,
directly connected to the 3He tubes, to the SIS3316 [42]
sampling ADC modules in the data acquisition sys-
tem [40]. This improvement enabled the recording of
the data without requiring the signal shapers used in
previous experiments.

Regarding the response of the neutron detection sys-
tem, the energy spectrum obtained for the neutron events
comprises the range from a low-energy threshold at
191 keV up to the 764 keV peak. This energy is at-
tributed to the kinetic energy released in the reaction:

3He + n −→ 3H+ 1H+ 764 keV. (2)

The 764 keV peak corresponds to the sum of the collec-
tion of the total energy released by the two reaction prod-
ucts, a triton and a proton. The lower energy detection
threshold is related to the partial collection of the energy
and the wall effect [43]. Gain-matching with a calibrated
252Cf source was carried out for all 48 3He counters be-
fore the experiment. The stability of the overall detector
response was checked regularly during the experiment.
The accumulated spectrum for all 48 tubes during the
136Sb measurement is shown Fig. 4. The latter includes
the uncorrelated neutron events, which were removed in
the data analysis process together with other light parti-
cles and the noise at lower energies.

III. DETERMINATION OF THE NEUTRON

BRANCHING RATIOS

The equation that describes the total β-delayed neu-
tron branching probability, Pn, of a nucleus is defined

as the sum of all, single and multiple, neutron emission
contributions present in the decay:

Pn =

N∑

x=1

Pxn (3)

For nuclei with only one-neutron emission energetically
allowed, i.e. Qβn >0 and Qβ2n <0, the Pn value is equal
to P1n. This is the case for the

95Rb, 137I, and 136Te
isotopes measured in this experiment. In order to de-
termine their P1n values, we followed the methodology
successfully implemented in a previous experiment with
a similar setup at the IGISOL facility [20] in which the
P1n values were deduced as:

P1n =

where Nβ1n is the number of the net β and neutron time-
correlated events, Nβ the number of β decays registered,

ε̄β is the mean β efficiency, ε̄β

the averaged β efficiency
above the Sn weighted according to the Qbn and the neu-
tron energy spectrum range (see Fig. 5), and ε̄n the neu-
tron efficiency (see Fig. 3).

energy spectra of the measured isotopes (colored lines) [39].
The lower β efficiency at low energies affects the detection of
correlated βn events for those isotopes with a low Qβ value
(see text for details).

The analysis of the acquired data directly provides
three parameters that are needed to evaluate and deter-
mine the neutron branching ratios. These are the num-
ber of β particles and the number of neutrons detected,
together with the βn time-correlation events. Figure 6
shows the analysis to determine the β and neutron in-
tegrals for each measured isotope, 95Rb, 137I, 136Te, and
136Sb, from the growth-and-decay curves, using the Bate-
man equations [44]. The particular growth (implanta-
tion) and decay times in the curves were precisely set ac-
cording to the half-lives, taken form the literature [39], of

FIG. 6. Analysis of the β and neutron events accumulated during the implantation-and-decay cycles in the growth-and-decay
curves for each isotope measured. In the analysis of 137I (b) the fit function also includes a parameter to reflect the loss of the
xenon isotopes in the chain. As xenon is a noble gas, a fraction of the nuclei rapidly escape from the implantation tape. Details
of this effect are presented in Ref. [20]. In the case of 95Rb (a) the trap purification cycle can be identified. In all cases the
ions were extracted from the trap in bunches, once in every 181 ms according to the length of this cycle. This was repeated as
many times as needed during the “beam on” time. So the beam was not continuous but rather a quasi-continuous.

the isotopes present in the decay chain. The flat area at
the beginning of the timing cycle (see fig. 6) corresponds
to the characterization of the β and neutron background.
Table II provides the Qβ values of interest together with
half-lives and the details of their implantation and decay
cycle times. The numerical results from Fig. 6 for the
precursor isotopes are shown in later tables.
In the present work 137I and 95Rb beams were used

as calibration isotopes because of their well-known P1n
values [26–28]. In addition, these two isotopes have very
different neutron energy spectra (see Fig. 3). In the case
of 95Rb, its neutron energy spectrum is mainly centered
at lower energies, with a large Qβn value of 4.8 MeV.
This indicates that the lower β detection probability at
lower energies (see Fig. 5) does not miss βn correlated

events in the analysis. Therefore, assuming ε̄β ≈ ε̄β
′

in
Eq. 4, it is possible to determine its P1n value to a first

The resulting P1n value for
95Rb, considering a con-

stant ε̄n value of 62.98%, taken from the simulation and
weighted with the neutron spectrum, is 8.6(4)%, in agree-
ment with the literature value of 8.94(37)% [28]. On the
other hand, 137I has a neutron spectrum spread over the
whole energy range up to its endpoint at ≈2 MeV (see
Fig. 3). In this case its analysis is affected due to the
non-constant β efficiency at low energies (see Fig 5), and
the simplified expression detailed in Eq. 5 is not accurate
enough. Thus, we defined an expression to avoid the ε̄β
and ε̄β

dependence in Eq. 4 as in Ref. [20], using the
total number of detected neutrons, Nn, independently of
the coincidence or not with the βs:

from which, it is then possible to determine the ε̄n/ε̄β
ratio with the well-known P1n values of the

95Rb and
137I calibration isotopes. The ratio obtained can be
used to determine the remaining P1n values in this
experiment. Table III summarizes the integral values of
the βn correlated events, the number of β events, Nβ ,
and the number of neutrons, Nn, for the

95Rb and 137I
measurements, together with the calculated ε̄n/ε̄β ratio.

The average of the ε̄n/ε̄β ratio, calculated from
95Rb

and 137I measurements in Table III, is 1.62(7). As these
two isotopes have large Qβ values this ratio value is ex-
pected to be alike. Thus, we assume that this value also
applies for all the other isotopes measured in this exper-
iment.

A. The P1n value of
136

Te

With a Qβn value of 1292(6) keV,
136Te has an energy

window that allows β-delayed one-neutron emission. In
this case the expected energy spectrum of the emitted
neutrons is also affected by the non-constant ε̄β at low
energies described above for 137I. Thus, the equation to
determine its neutron branching ratio can be defined by

Eq. 6, using the ε̄n/ε̄β ratio determined with the calibra-
tion isotopes. With the integral values obtained in the
analysis of the growth-and-decay curves in Fig. 6, the
analysis yields a P1n of 1.47(6)%. This value is slightly
higher but in fair agreement with those reported in the
literature and the IAEA evaluation: 1.31(5)% [26, 28]
and 1.26(20)% [27]. Using the simplified Eq. 5, with the
βn correlated detected events derived from the analysis
of Fig. 7, the P1n value would be 0.90(5)%. Comparing

the experiment. According to the βn background level on the
left side, the neutron moderation time in the polyethylene for
this experiment was determined to be 500 µs.

this value with the one obtained using the efficiency ra-
tio correction we observe an increase of about 63%. This
gives an idea of the fraction of correlated events missed
because of the lower ε̄β at low energies when measuring
an isotope with a neutron energy spectrum such as 136Te
(see Fig. 5). The acquired data for this isotope in this
measurement were recorded for 165 cycles which included
a background measurement of 10 s, an implantation time
of 79.5 s, and a decay time of 68.5 s for each one, giving
158.5 s per cycle (see Fig. 6 and Table II), i.e. 7.3 h of
beamtime. A total of 2082 net β1n correlated events were
registered for this isotope. The values of this analysis are
reported in Table IV.

As described in Section I, when the state populated af-
ter the β decay is higher than the two-neutron separation
energy, S2n, in the daughter nucleus (Qβ2n > 0), double
neutron emissions are allowed. This is the case for 136Sb
with Qβ2n=1884(6) keV. Its measurement in this exper-
iment comprised 26465 recorded implantation-and-decay
cycles of 9.51 seconds (≈3 days). As can be observed in
Fig. 6, in each cycle the first 2 s were used to charac-
terize the β and neutron background. Table II details
the implantation-and-decay cycle times. The neutron
branching ratios of this isotope have two contributions
to the Pn (Eq. 3): the P1n and the P2n values.
In order to determine its neutron branching ratios, sev-

eral steps are necessary. Eq. 7 describes the total number
of neutrons, Nn, after background subtraction:

Nn = N1n(
136Sb) + 2N2n(

136Sb) +N1n(
136Te). (7)

As can be seen the total number of neutrons has contribu-
tions from the one- and two-neutron emission branching
ratios of 136Sb plus a small contribution from its daugh-
ter 136Te. The latter is present in the decay chain and
the relevant number of neutrons can be determined with
the information extracted from the 136Sb β-decay anal-
ysis (Fig. 6) and its P1n value. In order to calculate
the contributions of one-neutron and two-neutron events
from the 136Sb decay in Eq. 7, we define the following
expressions:

N1n(136Sb) = ε̄nP1n
Nβ
ε̄β

+ 2× ε̄n(1 − ε̄n)P2n
Nβ
ε̄β

(8)

and

N2n(136Sb) = ε̄
2
nP2n

Nβ
ε̄β

(9)

These expressions relate the number of β events, Nβ ,
and neutron events, Nxn, and their detection efficiency,
to the unknown P1n and P2n values. However, from
the available information, the analysis only provides the
net number of Nβ events for each one of the species
in the decay chain, and the net number of the total
neutron events, Nn, after background subtraction.
Firstly, we attempted to determine the net number of
two-neutron correlations, N2n, from the decay of

136Sb
subtracting the two-neutron correlations determined in
a background run. As shown in Fig. 8, this method
is not useful because of the large uncertainty in the
background subtraction. The large background can be
associated with different kinds of interactions between
particles, either cosmic rays or reactions of the beam
with materials, and the BELEN detector.

Therefore, the strategy to determine the neutron
branching ratios was based on the evaluation of the di-
rect β2n and β1n correlation events recorded in the data
analysis. Figures 9 and 10 show, respectively, the β2n

within the neutron moderation time-window, before and
after a β decay. For the case of two neutrons accidentally
correlated per detected β, we define the parameter r2n
as the number of backward time-correlations, N2nβ , and
the total number of β-decays, Nβ, obtained from Fig. 6

yond the calculation to determine the number of β1n net

in the determination of the truly β2n events. (See text for
details).

and reported in Table IV:

r2n =

Nβ

. (10)

The amount of events contributing due to this r2n rate
includes all β decays except those coming from the β1n
and β2n events, i.e. r2n × (Nβ − Nβ1n − Nβ2n). How-
ever, according to the measured values, we can assume
that Nβ >> Nβ1n >> Nβ2n, and the background from
this β-2n channel is approximately of r2nNβ. Another
relevant background contribution comes from the detec-
tion of one accidental neutron inside the same correlation
time-window of a truly correlated neutron. In this case
we define the parameter r1n as the β1n backward time-
correlations, N1nβ, as obtained in the analysis presented
in Fig. 10, and the total number of β-decays Nβ from
Fig. 6:

r1n =
N1nβ
Nβ

. (11)

In addition, this β-1n background channel has also con-
tributions from those neutrons in the β-2n channel in
which one of the neutrons has not been detected. This
can be estimated with the neutron efficiency factor de-
fined as:

rǫ =
(1 − ǫn)

ǫn
, (12)

being the total contribution of the one neutron channel
as r1n × (Nβ1n + 2 × rεNβ2n). To summarize, Eqs. 13
and 14 describe the system that relates the number of

measured β1n and β2n (forward) events, N

with the true events, Nβ1n and Nβ2n, and background
contributions, assuming Nβ >> Nβ1n >> Nβ2n:

N
f
β2n ≈ (1−r)Nβ2n+r2nNβ+r1n(Nβ1n+2rǫNβ2n) (14)

where r is the sum of all accidental neutrons per
detected β, r = r1n + r2n + r3n..., which are added
on each particular background channel in the latter
equations. In this measurement, this sum was simplified
considering that r1n >> r2n >> r3n, and only the first
two contributions were taken into account. Solving the
system presented in Eqs. 13 and 14, the resulting values
for the Nβ2n and Nβ1n, in the

136Sb measurement, are
21.8 and 9328 respectively. The method described above
is presented in detail in Ref. [45] within the BRIKEN
Project [46].

If we were to assume that the mean energy of the neu-
tron spectrum is not affected by the lower εβ at low ener-
gies, the P2n value could be calculated with a simplified
expression such as Eq. 15, analogously to Eq. 5 used for
the case of 95Rb for its P1n value:

P2n =
1

ε̄2n

Nβ2n
Nβ

(15)

With this assumption, the P2n value would be 0.10(2)%.
However, due to the expected low ε̄β in the energy region
of interest for the two-neutron energy spectrum (Qβ2n
value = 1884(6) keV, see Fig. 5), it is necessary to apply

the correction based on the ε̄β
′

(Eq. 16) in the same
way as Eq. 4 for the case of one-neutron emission (see
Section III):

P2n =

ε̄2n

(16)

The unknown neutron energy spectrum for the 136Sb two-
neutron emission suggests the use of the calculated ε̄β

value for 137I, as its Qβn value, 2002 keV, is very close
to the 136Sb Qβ2n value. So, using the ε̄n/ε̄β coefficient,
1.62(7), previously determined, the P2n value is calcu-
lated to be 0.14(3)%. Having obtained the P2n, the P1n
value, has been determined to be 32.2(15)%.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The P1n and P2n values obtained in this work are
summarized in Table V together with the previously
available experimental values and theoretical predic-
tions from several models, including the finite-range
droplet model plus the quasiparticle random-phase
approximation (FRDM+QRPA) [13], the density func-
tional theory plus continuum QRPA plus relativistic
QRPA(DF3+cQRPA+RQRPA) [47, 48], the Koura-
Tachibana-Uno-Yamada (KTUY) [49], the relativistic
Hartree-Bogoliubov plus RQRPA (RHB+RQRPA) [50],
the QRPA plus Hartree-Fock (QRPA-HF) [51], and the
semi-empirical effective density model [52]. The P1n
value obtained for 136Te, 1.47(6)%, is higher but in fair
agreement with those reported in Refs. [26, 27] and [28].

Concerning 136Sb, the analysis yields a P1n value of
32.2(15)%. This is higher than previous experimental
results also taken from Refs. [26, 27] and [28]. In the case
of the P2n we have obtained a value of 0.14(3)%. This is
one order of magnitude lower than the 1.4% estimated
in a measurement with isobaric contamination [17],
and the predictions of the FRDM+QRPA and the
DF3+cQRPA+RQRPA models.

As shown in Table V, the values of most of the theo-
retical predictions are far from the experimental values.
Some of them are compatible for 136Sb but not for 136Te,
and vice versa. With the current results it is not easy to
decide which of the models reproduces better the exper-
imental results. The DF3+cQRPA [14, 48] approaches
better the magnitudes of the P1n and half-life for

136Te,
but in the case of 136Sb, although the predicted half-life
is close to the experimental value, it underestimates P1n
value and overestimates the P2n value. The model which
better reproduces the 136Sb data is the KTUY [49]
but the half-life predicted for 136Te remains far from
the experimental value. Regarding the QRPA-HF [51]
model, it is the one which better reproduces the P1n
and P2n values for both isotopes according the obtained
experimental results.

To date, several calculations and estimates for
multiple-neutron emission beyond A=100 have also been
reported. Table V reports the available ones for the
isotopes measured in this study. Some of them follow

the main theoretical models describing the strength func-
tions and some others are estimates and extrapolations
like [52]. Concerning experimental measurements, there
is a recent P2n value reported for

140Sb [56]. This value
was determined through an indirect measurement based
on relative intensities of γ-rays observed from transitions
that were identified as belonging to 138Te. The value re-
ported is “about” 8% and no uncertainty was given. This
suggests again the need for direct neutron measurements
in order to obtain more precise data on neutron emission
branching ratios.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have determined the neutron branching ratios for
136Te and 136Sb through a direct neutron measurement.
This represents the first experimental multiple-neutron
emission value above A=100 and an improvement for the
values available so far for these isotopes. As discussed
above, some of the theoretical predictions agree well with
the values obtained, but none shows agreement for all of
the parameters present in the decay. This, together with
the discrepancies with the experimental data available,
indicates that more measurements with pure beams and
direct neutron detection are needed in order to provide
further input for the models in this region, and to study
the nuclear properties above the neutron separation ener-
gies. Consequently, this experimental campaign in which
six more isotopes included in the IAEA priority list for



10

reactor physics [57] were also measured [40], and present
and future campaigns like BRIKEN [46] are an opportu-
nity to increase the amount of data available in this field.

It is also of interest to determine whether the two neu-
trons are emitted simultaneously or sequentially in the
β-delayed two neutron-emission process. In the first case
an angular correlation between both neutrons and the γ-
ray emitted by the final nucleus would be expected. In
the second case it would be necessary to correlate these
events with very narrow time-windows to be able to con-
firm the phenomenon. In this work we were not able to
address this question because of the moderation of the
neutrons in the polyethylene matrix and the statistics
available.
