Abstract. A series of measurements of neutron induced fission cross section of various TRU isotopes have been
performed at the CERN n TOF spallation neutron facility, in the energy range from thermal to nearly 250 MeV.
The experimental apparatus consists in a fast ionization chamber (FIC), used as a fission fragment detector with a
high efficiency. Good discrimination between alphas and fission fragments can be obtained with a simple amplitude
threshold. In order to allow the monitoring of the neutron beam and to extract the n TOF neutron flux, the well known
cross section of the 235U(n,f) reaction, considered as a fission standard, has been used. Preliminary results for the
cross section are shown for some selected isotopes such as 235U, 233U and 245Cm in the energy range from 0.050 eV
to about 2 MeV.

as future Gen-IV (fast) nuclear reactors. Some isotopes, e.g.,
the fissile 233U, are important for lighter fuel cycles, such as
the Thorium Fuel Cycle, interesting for the lower production
of minor actinides and breeding possibilities. More precise and
complete basic nuclear data are required for the engineering
design and safety evaluation of such devices [1].

Since the current data for the involved isotopes are scarce
and contradictory (especially for Cm and Am isotopes), the
n TOF Collaboration has performed measurements of neutron
induced fission cross sections of 233U, 245Cm, 241,243Am and
of the fission standards 235U and 238U at CERN n TOF
facility [2].

2 The n TOF facility

The n TOF facility is a time of flight installation based on a
spallation neutron source. Neutrons are produced by a sharply
pulsed, 6 ns wide, 20 GeV/c proton beam impinging into a
80 × 80 × 60 cm3 lead block surrounded by 6 cm of H2O that
works as moderator and coolant. The protons are provided by
the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) which can operate in ded-
icated (7 · 1012 protons per pulse) or in parasitic mode (4 · 1012
protons per pulse). The main features of this facility are the
wide neutron energy range (from thermal to 250 MeV) high
instantaneous flux (3 ·105 n/cm2/pulse at the measuring station
with the 8 cm diameter collimator for the fission setup), low
duty cycle (averaged 0.25 cm−1), high energy resolution in the
Experimental Area (1.1 · 10−3 at 30 keV) and low background.
A measuring station is located at the end of the n TOF tunnel,
187.5 m from the spallation target and delimited by two walls
7.5 m apart. Several polyethylene absorbing blocks as well
as iron and concrete are used in order to reduce the overall
background.

3 Experimental setup

The detection setup for the measurement of the neutron
induced fission cross section is based on a Fast Ionization
Chamber (FIC) used as a fission fragment detector. It is
constituted by a stack of several parallel-plate chambers with
5 mm spacing between electrodes and operating with argonte-
trafluormethane (90% Ar + 10% CF4) at 720 mbar pressure.
The whole detector is an assembly of 17 ionization chambers,
with a total of 16 targets and 18 electrodes, mounted together
in a chamber of 50 cm length, thus allowing a simultaneous
measurement of the fission cross sections of several isotopes.
Each target consists of a stainless steel holder and a 100 µm
thick aluminum foil backing, with very thin layers of target
material (4 − 450 µg/cm2) on both sides. A circular area
of 80 mm diameter was deposited on the backing using the
painting technique [4]. Two detectors have been used in the
n TOF measurements: FIC-0 was essentially dedicated to low
activity isotopes, whereas FIC-1 was used for highly radioac-
tive species like 233U, 241,243Am and 245Cm, and is qualified
as a “sealed source” compliant with the ISO 2919 norm. No
gas circulation is needed, since the ionization chamber is not
working in proportional mode.

Fig. 1. Experimental setup constituted by a series of 17 parallel plate
ionization chambers, including 16 targets. The chambers are filled
with argontetrafluormethane at 720 mbar pressure. The magnitude of
the electric field between the gaps is 600 V/cm.

Table 1. Masses and uncertainties for the various TRU samples.

Sample Mass (mg) Error (mg)

235U 31.8 0.5
233U 28.8 0.5
245Cm 1.71 0.03
241Am 2.26 0.03
243Am 4.8 0.1

Since some of the isotopes are characterized by an activity
that reaches tens of MBq, the characteristics of the n TOF
beam (i.e., the high instantaneous flux and low repetition rate)
enables us to measure the fission cross section of those nuclei
with high accuracy for the first time. The detector signals
were acquired with a set of Acqiris Flash Analog to Digital
Converters (FADC) modules, sampling the full waveform of
the detector signal (at 100 MS/s) and recording the digitized
detector pulses for each event or neutron bunch, thus allowing
the complete information from fission events to be recorded
for repeated and detailed off-line analysis. It is worth men-
tioning that, since the n TOF neutron flux is determined from
the 235U(n,f) reaction, all others measured cross section are
extracted relatively to the fission cross section of 235U. Since
this is considered a fission standard, a good accuracy (in the
order of �5% due mainly to mass uncertainties and statistics)
is expected for the other measured samples.

The total masses of the samples are reported in table 1.
These values along with the various impurities have been
obtained by alpha spectrometry using a silicon detector.

4 Results

The required informations needed for data analysis are: the
signal amplitude, total charge, time of flight and the baseline
value, that are determined for each pulse signal. Additionally,

for each proton bunch, the beam intensity and the peak of the
initial flash corresponding to ultrarelativistic muons travelling
at a velocity very close to speed of light, are extracted: this
last information is used as a reference for the extraction of
the absolute neutron time of flight. In figure 2 the amplitude
distributions for the various isotopes are presented: it is clear
that, in the case of 235U and 233U, a simple amplitude threshold
works well for the discrimination between fission fragments
and α particles; for the 245Cm sample, the presence of a large
pileup between α particle complicates the analysis, since a
higher threshold has to be applied, which cuts also a large
fraction of fission fragments. A subsequent normalization of
the cross section has to be performed. For the time-to-energy
calibration, in order to consider the “effective” neutron flight
path (sum of the geometrical length and of the “moderator
distance”), a method developed in [5] has been taken into
account. Additionally 235U(n,f) resolved resonances were used
for the energy calibration procedure. An example of the
results for a limited energy interval is reported figure 3. A
very good agreement with known experimental data and with
ENDF/B-VII.0 is observed.

4.1 Neutron flux

For the determination of the absolute value of the cross
sections of the actinide targets, the 235U isotope was used for
the extraction of the n TOF neutron flux in the fission con-
figuration (that is with the 8 cm diameter collimator, see [3]).
The energy behaviour of the neutron flux can be derived from
the ratio between the 235U fission rate and an evaluated cross
section. The results are shown in figure 4. It is important to
underline that the histogram represents the product between
that value and the efficiency of the detector, which is however
close to 100% for the applied threshold.

The new evaluated library ENDF/B-VII.0 has been chosen
as the reference library. As predicted by the simulations and
according to the physics of the spallation source, the flux peaks
at thermal energy (due to the water moderation effects), is
approximately isolethargic between 0.25 eV and 10 keV and
then peaks again around 1 MeV due to evaporation from the
spallation products. Some clear dips due to absorption in the
aluminum alloy windows at the end of the spallation targets

in the ENDF/B-VII.0.

and due to the presence of oxygen in the moderator are present.
MCNPX simulations have been performed in order to quantify
the beam attenuation in various materials (targets, backings
and electrodes). This value has been evaluated to be at most
of 0.1%, so no corrections need to be applied. The absence
of large fluctuations in the resonance region clearly shows
that a good reproduction of the shape of the resonances has
been obtained, while above that threshold (located at �1 keV)
fluctuations increase due to the lack of description of the
resonances in ENDF/B-VII.0.

4.2 233U(n,f)

The experimental results for the 233U(n,f) cross section are
shown in figure 5, in comparison with ENDF/B-VII.0. It is
clear from figure 2 that a higher value of the threshold with
respect to the value set for 235U needs to be applied; the
subsequent loss of efficiency was corrected recalculating the
corresponding flux from 235U for the new used threshold.

Small differences in the amplitude of some 233U reso-
nances are observed, while in the resonance dips the exper-
imental cross section appers to be lower than the evaluated
data, indicating a good rejection of the background with
respect to the fission fragment signals.

(line) in the energy interval between 10 eV and 40 eV.

4.3 245Cm(n,f)

245Cm is the most interesting isotope since only few and
discordant experimental measurement exists; in particular no
experimental results exist in the EXFOR database for the
energy range between thermal and 20 eV. This isotope presents
a very large α background, as evident from figure 2 (due to the
relatively short halflife of 8500 y). For this reason, in addition
to a higher amplitude threshold, the experimental data have
been corrected also for the residual alpha background. The
amount to be subtracted was determined from measurements
performed without the neutron beam and with the same
amplitude threshold. Due to an uncertainty in the detection
efficiency, normalization to a known cross section value is
required. Since at thermal energy various measurement [7–9]
have been performed (although with discrepancies on the
order of 10%), we have chosen a weighted mean of those
values for normalization purposes.

n TOF preliminary data, that fills the region between
thermal and 20 eV where previous experimental results are not
available (fig. 6), are higher than ENDF/B-VII.0, particularly
in the energy range between 0.1 eV and 8 eV (where the
discrepancies rise up to 10%) and in the resonances high
energy shoulders. A more refined analysis is however needed
before drawing a definite conclusion.

When compared with previous [10] experimental results
(see insert in fig. 6), good reproduction of the fission res-
onances is obtained, with discrepancies up to 20% for dips
and amplitudes of some resonances. Additionally, FIC data
confirms a previous experimental results that shows that the
ENDF/B-VII.0 doublet at En � 15 eV appears as a single
resonance.

5 Conclusions

Neutron induced fission cross section measurements of 235U,
233U, 245Cm and 241,243Am have been performed at the n TOF
spallation facility at CERN, using a Fast Ionization Chamber
(FIC). First preliminary results for 235U, 233U and 245Cm show
results consistent with databases in the resonance region, with
no normalization required for 233U. In the case of 245Cm, for
the energy range between thermal and 20 eV, we obtained the
first experimental data ever published, while showing a good
agreement with previous data in the region above that value.
The determination of resonance parameters is now in progress
with the SAMMY code. In the near future we expect also to
extend FIC measurements for actinides up to 200 MeV.
