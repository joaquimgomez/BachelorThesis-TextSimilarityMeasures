Abstract. The 238U fission cross section is an international standard beyond 2 MeV where the 
fission plateau starts. However, due to its importance in fission reactors, this cross-section 
should be very accurately known also in the threshold region below 2 MeV. The 238U fission 
cross section has been measured relative to the 235U fission cross section at CERN – n_TOF 
with different detection systems. These datasets have been collected and suitably combined to 
increase the counting statistics in the threshold region from about 300 keV up to 3 MeV. The 
results are compared with other experimental data, evaluated libraries, and the IAEA standards. 

1 Introduction 

The fission cross sections of 235U and 238U are of fundamental importance in the field of nuclear 
technology, as well as for other fields of basic and applied nuclear physics. In particular, fission cross 
section in the hundreds-of-keV region are of paramount importance for the development of innovative 
fast reactors. The 235U(n,f) cross section is an international standard at 0.0253 eV and above 
0.15 MeV, and 238U(n,f) is a standard beyond 2 MeV [1]. While the 235U(n,f) standard is commonly 
used for neutron flux measurements from thermal to high energy, the 238U(n,f) threshold cross section 
can be more conveniently used in the presence of a low energy neutron background. 

To address the need of new and accurate data for future improvements of these standards a series 
of measurements of the 238U(n,f)/235U(n,f) cross section ratio were performed at the CERN n_TOF 
facility up to 1 GeV. Some of these measurements are described in detail in Ref. [2]. In the present 
contribution, the results of one more dataset are included, and the possibility to obtain high accuracy 
238U(n,f) cross section results at the threshold (0.3 MeV - 3 MeV) is examined. 

2 Experimental setups 

The measurements were performed at the CERN n_TOF facility [3–7], which is based on the 
spallation of 20 GeV/c protons on a lead target. Data were collected in different campaigns from the 
experimental area 1 (EAR1) approximately 190 m downstream of the neutron source. Two detection 
setups were used: a fast fission ionization chamber (FIC), in which a single fission fragment (FF) is 
detected, and an array of parallel plate avalanche counters (PPAC), in which the two FFs are detected 
in coincidence. 

2.1 The Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters 

The PPAC are gaseous detectors with very thin windows, small gaps between electrodes and low gas 
pressure [8-11]. These features make the detector practically insensitive to the prompt !-flash. The 
actinide samples were deposited on very thin backings and positioned between two PPACs for 
measuring FFs in coincidence. The main advantage of the coincidence technique is the very high 
efficiency for rejecting the "-particle background from the sample, as well as for discriminating 
fission against competing reactions. Another advantage of PPACs is that they can also measure the 
angular distribution of FFs. The main drawback of the system is the limited angular acceptance and 
the angular dependence of the efficiency. 

In the first experimental campaign the PPAC detectors were mounted perpendicular to the neutron 
beam direction, hereafter referred to as “PPAC perpendicular”. In this configuration the setup is 
affected by a loss of efficiency for FFs emitted at angles larger than ~60°. To overcome this problem, 
a new geometrical configuration was adopted in a second campaign, with the detectors and the 
samples tilted by 45°. Two measurements were performed with the tilted setup, hereafter referred to as 
“PPAC tilted 1” and “PPAC tilted 2”. Details on the analysis of the data in each configuration can be 
found in [2,8-14]. The PPAC samples were prepared at IPN (Orsay, France), and most of the targets 
used were characterised by means of alpha spectroscopy and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry 
(RBS).

Figure 1. The 238U/235U fission cross-section ratio measured at n_TOF with the different detection systems, in the 
neutron energy range 0.3-3MeV. The statistical uncertainties are plotted. The ratio calculated based on the IAEA 
references (2015) is shown for comparison.

2.2 The Fast Ionization Chamber 

The fast ionization chamber [15-16] is made of a stack of ionization cells consisting of two external 
electrodes and a central electrode plated on both sides with the fissile deposit. The FIC0 and FIC1 
versions of the detector were specifically built as “sealed sources” for measurements of highly 
radioactive samples. The FIC2 was used as a neutron flux monitor, thus it was much lighter and 
directly coupled to the vacuum tube. The samples were prepared using the painting technique at the 
IPPE (Obninsk, Russia) and the JINR (Dubna, Russia), and most of the targets used were 
characterised by means of alpha spectroscopy and the RBS technique. 
 For the extraction of the 238U(n,f)/235U(n,f) cross section ratio, one 238U and two 235U samples 
were used from the FIC0 measurements, two 235U and four 238U samples from FIC1, and one 238U and 
two 235U samples from FIC2. Different analysis procedures and corrections were applied for the data 
from the different detectors as described in [2,15-18]. The data collected with FIC2 were normalised 
to the results obtained with the FIC1 chamber in the 1–10 MeV energy region, due to the large 
uncertainty of the 238U sample mass. 

3 Results for the 238U(n,f)/235U(n,f) cross section ratio measurement 

The systematic uncertainties from the different datasets are summarised in Table 1 (assuming a 
uniform distribution). Fig. 1 shows the results of the different measurements at n_TOF of the 
238U/235U fission cross-section ratio for neutron energies in the range 0.3–3 MeV. A good agreement 
among the various datasets was observed, within their uncertainties, especially at the first chance 
fission plateau. Very few differences bigger than 1# are noticed at the threshold at ~1.2 MeV where 
the systematic uncertainty due to the FF emission anisotropy becomes larger. 
Each of the five datasets collected at n_TOF represents a new result by itself, and should be 
considered independently from each other, for re-evaluating the fission cross section ratio. 
Nevertheless, in order to compare the n_TOF data with previous measurements and current 
evaluations, the n_TOF 238U/235U fission cross section ratio has been calculated as the weighted 
average value of all the datasets, taking into account the uncorrelated statistical uncertainties. Firstly, 
all the datasets were normalised to the ratio calculated with the IAEA standards (2006) in the energy 
range 2.2-2.6 MeV, and the normalisation factor did not exceed 3%. An energy shift was applied to all

the datasets in order for them to match in the energy region of 1.34-1.48 MeV where the slope of the 
238U(n,f) cross section is largest. This energy-matching shift was less than 0.7%. A binning of 50 
bins/decade was chosen for E>800 keV and 25 bins/decade for E<800keV, and a linear interpolation 
was applied between consecutive points in order to match this binning.  

Table 1. Systematic uncertainties (in %) on the data collected in the measurements of the 238U /235U fission cross-
section ratio. Since the same samples were used in the “perpendicular” and “tilted 1” PPAC measurements, the 
corresponding uncertainties on the sample mass are fully correlated. For the last dataset, normalized to ENDF/B-
VII.1 (see [2]), the uncertainty in the mass is replaced by the one in the evaluated cross sections.

The extracted n_TOF 238U/235U fission cross section ratio is shown in Fig. 2, along with experimental 
data from the EXFOR database [19] and major evaluations, as well as the associated residuals divided 
by 1# (statistical uncertainty). The systematic uncertainty of the weighted average ratio, taking into 
account the normalisation to the IAEA standards, can be calculated from the energy-dependent 
uncertainties given in Table 1 and is roughly estimated to be less than 1.5% (1#).

Figure 2. a) The 238U/235U(n,f) cross section ratio obtained from the weighted average of the n_TOF datasets 
compared with the IAEA standard (2006) and reference (2015) and major evaluations, as well as data available in 
EXFOR. b) The residual of the n_TOF dataset with selected references and evaluations, divided by 1# (statistical) 
of the n_TOF dataset.

It can be noted that at the threshold region the evaluations present differences >5# from the n_TOF 
data, and that below ~750keV the latest data of Tovesson (2014) are systematically above the n_TOF 
data.

4 Determination of the 238U(n,f) cross section 

Based on the merged n_TOF dataset and the IAEA (2006) standard 235U(n,f) cross section, the 
238U(n,f) cross section was extracted at the threshold region. It is shown in Fig.3, along with selected 
previous data available in the EXFOR database. 

Figure 3.  The 238U(n,f) reaction cross section in the energy range 0.3-3MeV measured with reference to the 
235U(n,f) cross section at n_TOF (black squares), along with experimental data available in the EXFOR database. 
Next to the label the reference reaction used is noted.

The n_TOF data extracted with 235U(n,f) as a reference agree within 1# with most other datasets 
extracted with the  same reference. as well as  with the data from Allen (1957) using 1H(n,el) as 
reference. Only a few other datasets exist at the threshold region with reference to the 1H(n,el), (such 
as Smith (1957) and Leugers (1976)) but for E<1.5 MeV they present differences bigger than 1# with 
respect to all available data using the 235U(n,f) as reference. 
Despite the statistical uncertainties, interesting shoulders can be noticed in the threshold region at  
~0.4, ~0.6, ~0.8, ~1, and ~1.2MeV, most of them not properly described in the latest evaluations and 
worth being studied in the context of the fission barrier parameters  related to different fission modes, 
resonant sub-threshold structure, etc. [20] as well as  to the competition with the inelastic neutron 
channel. 

5 Outlook 

The 238U/235U fission cross section ratio has been measured at n_TOF with two different detection 
systems, one of which was used in two different geometrical configurations. The results of the 
measurements are consistent within their combined uncertainties. The datasets have been combined in 
order to obtain a unique dataset and the 238U(n,f) cross section was derived. The extracted ratio could 
be used to improve the accuracy of current libraries, and in particular of the IAEA standard and of 
reference datasets used in a variety of applications. New measurements of the 238U/235U fission cross 
section ratio are foreseen using the new vertical neutron beam line of the n_TOF facility [21] with 
much higher statistics in the region of the threshold, especially for neutron energies below 0.5 MeV.
