Abstract. A series of (n,γ) neutron capture measurements on the lead isotopes and bismuth have been carried out
at the CERN n TOF installation in the neutron energy range from 1 eV up to 1 MeV. At n TOF, contaminations
due to scattered neutrons were reduced down to a negligible level by using improved γ-ray detectors with very low
neutron sensitivity. The background level has been determined precisely from a complementary measurement. Other
experimental effects related to the electronic threshold in the detectors and the angular distribution of the prompt
γ-rays were investigated via Monte Carlo simulations and could be taken in account in the analysis of the capture
data. With this set of measurements the energy differential (n,γ) cross sections of 204,206,207Pb and 209Bi have been
determined with good accuracy. The information obtained in this work becomes of interest for constraining r-process
calculations and in particular for the Th/U cosmochronometer.

1 Introduction

The heavy elements lead and bismuth are synthesized by both
the slow (s-) and the rapid (r-) neutron capture processes. In
this mass region the s-process takes place in the framework of

a complicated network (see fig. 1), where the abundances are
affected by several branching points (204Tl, 210Bi and 210Po).
Due to this complex scenario the s-process abundances of
these isotopes are sensitive to the different neutron irradiation
periods during the evolution of the Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stage of stellar evolution, where these isotopes are
produced [1–4].

Fig. 1. Nucleosynthesis path of the s-process in the Pb-Bi region.
The number of short lived transbismuth isotopes contributing to the
r-process nucleosynthesis of these elements is shown with solid black
arrows.

On the other hand, the r-process contribution to these
isotopes is strongly dominated (90%) by the decay of the
short lived transbismuth isotopes [5]. For this reason, the
r-process fraction Nr, derived from the rather reliably known
total abundance in the solar system N�; and from the s-process
Ns component,

Nr = N� − Ns, (1)
constitutes an important constraint for r-process model cal-
culations. This aspect is also important for the age estimates
based on observed actinide abundances in ultra metal poor
stars.

Because the cross sections of these isotopes are dominated
by resonances where neutron scattering is large compared to
the (n,γ) channel, their capture cross sections can be best
measured by using small volume (total energy) detectors,
which can be optimized in order to reduce backgrounds due
to scattered neutrons. This method requires the use of the
so-called Pulse Height Weighting Technique (PHWT) [6],
which makes the capture detection probability independent
of the particular decay path. This technique is based on the
precise knowledge of the detector response to capture γ-rays.
Weighting Functions (WFs) obtained in the early days when
the technique was proposed, resulted in accuracies not better
than 20% in some particular cases [7]. A combined analysis of
measurements made at Geel [8] and Monte Carlo (MC) simu-
lations and measurements made at ORNL [9] for the particular
case of 56Fe revealed that the problem was due to incorrect
WFs used in the analysis of previous measurements. The
issue of an inaccurate WF concerns also measurements made
20–30 years ago on 204Pb [10,11], 206Pb [10,12], 207Pb [10,
13,14] and Bi [15], but also more recent measurements [16]
on 207Pb and Bi, which were analyzed with a single experi-
mentally determined WF in a sandwiched sample set-up for an
improved accuracy [8]. With today’s MC codes one can obtain
realistic detector responses using precise modellizations of
experimental setups [17–20], which allows in combination
with an accurate method [18,19] to obtain reliable WFs.

The effect of an incorrect WF on the capture yield is
difficult to quantify accurately. It might be small for isotopes

or resonances with capture γ-ray spectra similar to the res-
onance used as reference for absolute yield normalization
(like the 4.9 eV resonance in gold), or it might be as large
as 16% for resonances with a “harder” spectrum [21]. The
fact that many resonances in the lead isotopes show a very
hard pulse height spectrum (dominated by only one or two
step cascades) motivated a new measurement of these isotopes
using improved weighting functions.

The hard pulse height spectra in some of these isotopes,
mainly 206Pb, has the additional experimental difficulty that
the prompt γ-rays for certain resonances with l > 0 show
an anisotropic angular distribution. This effect can be also
minimized by utilizing a setup where the detectors are placed
at 125◦ with respect to the incident neutron beam direction.
Additionally some other experimental aspects could be also
improved. Previous capture measurements of 204Pb were made
in the neutron energy range above 2.5 keV, which hindered the
measurement of a few resonances below that energy. Finally
the neutron sensitivity of the capture setup has been extremely
improved (see refs. [22,23]) when compared to the original
setups based on C6F6 detectors surrounded by rather massive
structural materials.

2 The CERN n TOF facility and experimental setup

The capture cross sections of 204,206,207Pb and Bi were mea-
sured as a function of the energy via the time of flight
technique at the CERN n TOF installation [24]. At n TOF
neutrons are produced by a 20 GeV proton beam on a lead
spallation target. The beam is characterized by intense proton
bunches of 3–7× 1012 protons, a width of 6 ns rms, and a very
low repetition frequency of 0.4 Hz. Thanks to this very low
duty cycle, a broad energy range from several MeV down to
1 eV can be measured in each run with favorable background
conditions and without having overlapping neutrons from
previous runs.

Capture events are registered with two small (1 l volume)
C6D6 scintillators. The detectors [23] and the experimental
setup [24,25] were optimized in order to minimize back-
grounds from sample-scattered neutrons.

Because of the importance of accurate WFs (see sect. 1),
much effort has been put at n TOF in order to use the PHWT
properly. Therefore the 1.15 keV resonance on 56Fe, which
has been found to be particularly sensitive to the shape of
the calculated WF [9], was measured with two different types
of C6D6 detectors and with iron samples of three different
thicknesses (from 0.5 mm to 2 mm). By this study it was
verified that an uncertainty better than 2% can be achieved
with WFs derived from MC simulations [19]. This result is
in excellent agreement with the pioneering work of Perey
et al. [9], who found an uncertainty of 3% for a sample 0.5 mm
in thickness with WFs obtained from response functions,
which were simulated with the MC code EGS4 [26]. The ac-
curacy shown by the MC calculations in the latter two studies
is considerably better than the results obtained by Gayther et
al. [27], who found an uncertainty of ∼6% for a 0.3 mm thick
Fe sample and 11% for a thicker (2 mm) iron sample, also
employing EGS4 for simulating the responses. This illustrates
the need to confront the effect of the MC calculated WFs

with sensitive measurements (like the 1.15 keV resonance in
56Fe), in order to have a realistic estimate of the quality of the
simulation and the related uncertainties.

The measurement of the lead isotopes at n TOF was made
with the two C6D6 detectors placed at an angle of about 125

◦
degrees with respect to the incident neutron beam direction in
order to minimize angular distribution effects of the prompt
capture γ-rays.

The dependence of the neutron flux versus neutron energy
was determined with an accuracy of ±2% by means of a
fission chamber calibrated by the Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt (PTB) [28]. The latter was used to measure
the fission yields of 235,238U samples. During the capture
measurements the neutron intensity was also monitored via
four silicon detectors, which registered the 3H and α particles
from a thin 6Li foil centered in the beam [25].

3 Capture data analysis

The WFs required for the analysis of each isotope and for
the gold reference sample were determined from a set of
γ-rays response functions obtained from a GEANT4 Monte
Carlo simulation, where the experimental setup and the par-
ticular capture sample were carefully modeled. A realistic
3-dimensional generation of events inside the cylindrical sam-
ples was implemented in the simulation code. In the radial
direction of the sample γ-rays were generated with the n TOF
beam profile distribution [29]. Across the sample thickness
(z) a γ-ray emission probability distribution (e−nσz) was taken
into account. It was found that the large γ-ray absorption
effects inside the low cross section and high Z samples (Pb
and Bi) prevent a polynomial WF to appropriately fulfill the
proportionality condition between γ-ray energy and efficiency,
on which the PHWT is based. We were able to overcome this
problem by using a numerical-pointwise WF derived from a
very large set of MC simulated response functions to which a
linear regularization method was applied [30,31].

The uncertainty introduced in the capture yield due to the
WFs calculated for the gold, lead and bismuth sample was
estimated on the basis of MC simulations of the complete
capture γ-ray spectra [19]. The calculated WFs were applied
to the simulated capture spectra and the resulting weighted
sum was shown to deviate only ∼0.5% from the corresponding
capture energy. This indicates that an error of less than 1% is
introduced in the capture yield by the calculated WFs.

For each measured isotope, as well as for the gold refer-
ence sample, a resonance (spin-parity dependent) yield cor-
rection factor was calculated, which accounts for the fraction
of the spectrum missing below the noise-rejecting threshold
in the C6D6 detectors. A C6D6 threshold between 200 and
300 keV led to yield corrections between 3% and 7%. Other
systematic effects related with γ-ray summing in the detectors
and conversion electron processes, were also treated within the
simulation of the prompt γ-rays cascades and are included in
the yield correction factor.

The capture yield was normalized via the saturated reso-
nance technique [32] by measuring a gold sample in regular
intervals.

The background for the Pb and Bi isotopes in the entire
energy range is dominated by in-beam γ-rays scattered in the

capture sample. The dependence of this background with neu-
tron energy was best determined from the measurement of an
enriched 208Pb sample, which showed only a few resonances
in the entire energy range.

Finally an R-matrix analysis of the capture yield was
performed using the SAMMY code [33]. Capture areas and
resonance parameters (E◦, Γγ and/or Γn) were derived from
the fit of the experimental data. In the fitting procedure the
background level at each channel (or neutron energy) was
fixed rather than subtracted.

4 Results and astrophysical implications

A detailed comparison versus previous measurements is out
of the scope of this paper. Therefore only the Maxwellian
Averaged Cross Sections (MACS) will be compared versus
the compilation of Bao et al. [34] (see fig. 2), which has been
commonly used so far for stellar s-process calculations.

The new MACS of 204Pb at kT = 5 − 8 keV is about 30%
larger than reported before. This discrepancy is due to three
resonances below 2.6 keV, which were not measured before in
capture and apparently were not included in the compilation
either. The discrepancy in the case of 206Pb is more difficult to
identify, since they could originate from angular distribution
effects of the prompt capture γ-rays or from the WF used
in previous measurements [10,12]. Our MACS for 206Pb is
in good agreement with a recent measurement at Geel [35].
For the rest of the isotopes and/or energy regions, the new
results show good agreement with the compiled cross sections,
which means that the respective uncertainties were properly
evaluated. For all isotopes, including 207Pb and 209Bi, the
uncertainties in the relevant energy regions around 30 keV
and 8 keV, have been substantially improved. Consequently,
this led to a more accurate determination of the s-process
abundances for these isotopes (see fig. 3).

According to the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE)
model [3,4] most of the s-process abundance of 208Pb and
209Bi is synthesized in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars
of low metallicity. About 95% of the neutron irradiation is

caused by the 13C(α,n)16O reaction, which operates during
the interpulse phase, at temperatures of ∼108 K or thermal
energies of kT ≈ 8 keV. In these cases the final abundances
are strongly determined by the cross section at 5–10 keV. The
abundances were determined for a thermally pulsing AGB star
with M = 3M� and a metallicity [Fe/H]= −1.3, characteristic
of the strong s-process component. On the other hand the
abundances of 204,206,207Pb were calculated using a combina-
tion of masses M = 3M� and M = 1.5M�, and metallicities
[Fe/H]= −0.3 and [Fe/H]= −1.3, which account for the main
and the strong s-process components, respectively.

These results are summarized in figure 3, which shows
also the same calculation based on the MACS from the
compilation. In particular the s-process abundances of 207Pb
and 209Bi could be now determined more accurately. Since the
s-process fraction of bismuth relatively small, the r-process
residual becomes a very accurate constraint for r-process
model calculations of the transbismuth region [5,37,38].
