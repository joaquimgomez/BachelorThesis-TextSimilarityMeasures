Abstract. We have measured the neutron capture and fission cross section of 233U at the neutron time-of-flight
facility n TOF at CERN in the energy range from 1 eV to 1 MeV with high accuracy by using a high performance
4π BaF2 Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) as a detection device. The method, based on the TAC energy response
study, allowing to disentangle between γ’s originating from fission and capture will be presented as well as the first
very preliminary results.

1 Introduction

The use of a fuel cycle based on 232Th could substantially
reduce the radiotoxicity of the produced nuclear waste, since
the lower atomic and mass numbers of thorium results in a
strongly suppressed build-up of the higher actinides, espe-
cially americium and curium. The design and realization of
nuclear power stations based on the use of thorium require an

accurate knowledge of the neutron reactions cross section of
233U, since this isotope plays the same role as 235U in standard
nuclear power plants.

The neutron capture reaction cross section measurement
of 233U, is complicated by low energy neutron induced fission
that will also give γ-rays. Up to now only two measurements
are available in the resonance region. The first one performed
by Brooks et al. [1] up to 10 eV with a poor energy resolution.
Another measurement has been performed by Weston et al.
[2] up to 1 keV using the fission tagging technique. A similar
technique is being developed at LANSCE using DANCE
[3,4] but no measurement on 233U has been reported.

depicts the neutron beam pipes, the central neutron absorber, and the
10B loaded carbon fiber capsule.

For these reasons, we have measured simultaneously the
neutron capture and fission cross section of 233U at the neutron
time-of-flight facility, n TOF, at CERN [5] by studying the
calorimetric response of the newly constructed n TOF Total
Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) [6,7].

2 Experimental set-up

The n TOF facility at CERN is a neutron source with a wide
energy range, where neutrons are generated by spallation in-
duced by 20 GeV/c protons onto a solid lead target. The proton
beam has a time resolution of 6 ns (r.m.s.) and an intensity up
to 7 · 1012 protons/pulse. The flight distance of about 185 m,
combined with the very high instantaneous flux, allows to
perform high resolution measurements on radioactive target.

The sample of 108 mg of U3O8 (91 mg of U, 0.356 MBq)
was pressed into a pellet and doubly encapsulated between Al
and Ti foils which were 0.15 mm and 0.2 mm thick respec-
tively, in order to fulfill the ISO 2919 certification requested
by the safety regulations at CERN. It isotopic purity, deter-
mined by γ-ray spectroscopy was: 233U 99.01%, 234U 0.74%,
235U 0.23%, 238U 0.04%. During our analysis only 234U
contribution has been seen and subtracted.

The design of the n TOF Total Absorption Calorimeter
(TAC) [6,7] is based on 40 BaF2 crystals shaped as hexagonal
and pentagonal pyramids forming a spherical shell with 10 cm
inner radius and 15 cm thickness. Each BaF2 is covered by a
teflon light reflector layer, an aluminum foil and a final cover
with 10B loaded carbon fiber capsule. The TAC has a high
detection efficiency for capture events near 100% and an ac-
ceptable energy resolution, typically 10% at 661.5 keV to 6%
at 6.15 MeV. Targets are placed at the center of the TAC and
surrounded by a neutron absorber made of C12H20O4(

6Li)2.
The neutron absorber as the 10B loaded carbon fiber reduce
the sensitivity of the detector to neutron without affecting too
much the capture detection efficiency.

In between two energy calibration, the energy drift is
monitored by using the α intrinsic radioactivity of BaF2
crystals.

contributions to the signal.

3 Data reduction

In order to improve the signal to background ratio, one first
needs to determine an optimal event selection criteria for the
TAC. In our case, as can be seen in figure 2, the main sources
of background are: the sample radioactivity below ≈100 eV
and the scattered neutrons above this energy although the
sample is surrounded by neutron absorber. This is because our
samples were encapsulated in between two titanium foils, as
describe before, in order to be ISO-2919 compliant. In order
to minimize this component we kept only events for which
more than one cluster is present, where a cluster consists of a
connection of neighboring crystals that have been hitted.

In order to disentangle betwen all signals contributions,
one performs a shape analysis of the TAC energy response for
each time-of-flight (neutron energy) bin. The method is similar
to the one used for the 234U neutron capture expriment [8,9].
Nevertheless an additional step is needed in this case, since we
need to disentangle in between the TAC response to neutron
captured by a 233U nucleus, to the one given by the fission
process.

The top left part of figure 3 shows the fission (magenta)
and capture yield (blue) corresponding to our target given by
ENDF/B-VII [10] from 1 to 10 eV incoming energy. Around
4.5 eV one can see a resonance in fission, not present in
capture. The bottom left part of figure 3 shows the TAC energy
response (in black) of this resonance selected as shown in the
top right part of figure 3. The fission only response, in red in
the left bottom part, has been obtained by subtracting the TAC
response in the vicinity of the resonance.

By selecting another resonance, and applying the same
procedure one can obtain the TAC response to capture and
fission given by the red curve in the right bottom part of
figure 3. Considering that the signal above 8 MeV can only be
attributed to fission (Sn = 6.845 MeV for

233U) one can easily
subtract the previously obtained fission response (in blue) to
obtain the TAC response to capture only (yellow area).

The next step of the data reduction is the efficiency
determination, that also take care of the “software” dead time
[8,9]. For the capture part a simulation, that consists in a γ-ray
cascade generator [11] coupled to the GEANT4 [12] toolkit,
has been performed. For fission no TAC efficiency has been yet

determined. A 100% efficiency is considered for the present
preliminary results.

The data, converted from time-of-flight to neutron inco-
ming energy assuming a flight path length of 184.9 ± 0.1 m,
are then divided by the n TOF standard flux times the beam
fraction seen by the sample to obtain yields.

Finally the capture and fission yields are converted to cross
section assuming a 233U thickness of 2.994 10−4 at/b. Data
have been corrected for self shielding effect by taking elastic
cross section from ENDF/B-VII [10] evaluation.

4 Preliminary results

Because at the present stage, the fission efficiency and the
233U mass distribution inside the canning is not known with a
sufficient precision, our fission cross section has been scaled to
reproduce the ENDF/B-VII evaluation below 20 eV by a factor
of 0.91 ± 0.01. This factor has also been taken into account to
derive the capture cross section.

Figure 4 shows a comparison between our scaled fission
cross section (in black) and the ones given by Weston et al.
[2] (in red) measured at RPI facility, Cao et al. [13] (in cyan)
measured at GELINA, Guber et al. [14] (in blue) recently mea-
sured at ORELA, Calviani et al. [15] (in magenta) recently
measured at CERN by using a fission chamber, togheter with
the latest ENDF/B-VII [10] (in green) evaluation, for neutrons
incoming energy below 20 eV. The overall agreement between
all datasets is excellent. Guber’s cross section for the first
resonance is slightly below all measurements, but this can be
easily explained because this dataset has not been corrected
for self-shielding.

To compare the smooth evolution of each dataset with
energy, all datasets have been rebinned to 20 bins/decade in en-
ergy (0.05 binwidth in lethargy units). The results is shown on
figure 5 for neutron incoming energies from 0.5 eV to 3 keV.

energies above ≈100 eV. On the contrary Cao’s data [13] above
around 500 eV gives the lowest cross section. The discrepants
points around 100 eV in Cao’s data are due to the presence of
a black resonance. Finally our data starts to overestimate all
other datasets by about 10% starting from 100 eV. This could
be due to a slight change of TAC energy response to fission
with increasing energy not considered in the present analysis.

Figure 6 shows a comparison between our scaled cap-
ture cross section (in black) and the ones given by Weston
et al. [2] (in blue) measured at RPI facility togheter with the
latest ENDF/B-VII [10] (in green) evaluation, for neutrons
incoming energy below 20 eV. One can see a good agreement
in shape between our data and Weston’s data, except for the
first resonance where our contribution is about 10% lower
than Weston. A resonance is also seen in Weston data around
11 eV, but not in our data neither reported in the evaluation.
Our resonances also shows a deeper fall-off on the low energy
side that could be attributed to the better energy resolution of
the n TOF facility compared to the RPI facility.

As for fission cross section measurements, capture datasets
have been rebinned to exhibit the slow evolution with in-
coming neutrons energies. The result is shown on figure 7.
The agreement with Weston’s data is good from 2 eV to
200 eV even though our data seems in average lower by a few
percent. Above 200 eV our data starts to deviate from Weston’s

measurements. This problem may be linked to our possibly
overestimation of fission cross section above this energy as
seen before.

Nevertheless since our fission detection efficiency is sures-
timated, for sure, one can infer that the capture cross section
given by Weston [2] is probably overestimated by up to 20%
in neutrons energies from 0.5 to 200 eV.

5 Conclusion

An innovative technique, based on a calorimetric shape
analysis, to disentangle between capture and fission induced
by neutrons, has been presented. This technique has been
employed to extract the neutron capture and fission cross
section of a 233U measurement performed using the Total
Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) at n TOF at CERN. Com-
bining this technique with fission tagging should allow to
determine capture cross section of fissionable isotope with an
unprecedent precision.
