The stellar neutron capture cross sections of 186Os and 187Os are fundamental for the Re/Os
cosmo-chronometer since they are defining the s-process abundance of 187Os. Subtraction of the
s-component from the solar 187Os abundance yields the radiogenic contribution to 187Os due to
β -decays of 187Re (t1/2 = 42.3 Gy) originating from r-process nucleosynthesis. The laboratory
cross section of 187Os requires a significant correction for the effect of the low-lying excited state
at 9.75 keV, which is strongly populated under stellar conditions. This reliability of the theoretical
correction can be greatly improved by an experimental determination of the cross section for in-
elastic scattering to the 9.75 keV state. In this work, high resolution time-of-flight measurements
of (n,γ) cross sections of 186,187,188Os from 1 eV to 1 MeV performed at the CERN n_TOF facil-
ity are reported. The inferred stellar cross sections differ from previously recommended values.
In addition, the inelastic scattering cross section has been measured at 30 keV neutron energy via
time-of-flight at the Karlsruhe 3.7 MV Van de Graaff. The implications of these results for the
Re/Os clock are briefly discussed.

Experimental challenges for the Re/Os clock Marita Mosconi

1. Introduction

The Re/Os cosmochronometer (proposed by Clayton [1]) represents a nuclear dating technique
independent of astronomical observations and - apart from a realistic model of galactic chemical
evolution - firmly based on nuclear reaction and decay properties. The temperature dependence of
the 187Re half-life has been determined by a measurement of the half-life of fully stripped 187Re
atoms [2], and the resulting consequence for the reliability of the clock was found to be relatively
small [3]. Hence, only the Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) for neutron capture on
186Os and 187Os under stellar conditions need to be experimentally investigated. In turn, the re-
quired calculation of the stellar enhancement factor of the 187Os cross section needs the support of
a measurement of the inelastic scattering cross section.

Previous measurements of the neutron capture cross sections of the stable Os isotopes 186−190Os
and of 192Os [4, 5] suffered from the fact that the astrophysically relevant energy range was not fully
covered. This holds in particular for the low energy region, which is important for most of the s-
process neutron exposure provided by the 13C(α ,n)16O reaction. Among the two cross section
sets, the MACS of 186Os exhibits some discrepancies, especially at energies close to the first ex-
cited state of 186Os at 130 keV, where a Hauser-Feshbach calculation is suggesting a pronounced
step in the cross section (Fig. 1). Consequently, improved capture cross section measurements
are called for to solve existing discrepancies and to extend the energy range to lower and higher
energies for obtaining a more reliable energy dependence of the (n,γ) cross sections.

The available measurements of the inelastic scattering cross section of 187Os [6, 7, 8] also
exhibit large uncertainties that are limiting the reliability of the calculated stellar enhancement
factor. Therefore, an accurate independent measurement of the (n,n′) cross section of 187Os is
another experimental challenge for an improved assessment of the Re/Os cosmochronometer.

2. Neutron capture measurements at n_TOF

The n_TOF neutron spallation source (20 GeV protons impinging on a solid lead target) is
producing neutrons in the energy range from thermal to above 1 GeV, with neutron capture mea-
surements commonly performed in the energy range from 1 eV to 1 MeV. Due to the flight path
of 187.5 m and the short proton burst width of 6 ns, the time of flight (TOF) method yields an
excellent neutron energy resolution of 3×10−4 and 4×10−3 at 1 eV and 1 MeV, respectively [9].
In the experimental area the isolethargic neutron flux varies smoothly with neutron energy, and the
total fluence ranges from 4.5×104 to 2×105 neutrons per proton bunch between 1 eV and 1 MeV
[9].

Each of the Os samples consisted of 2 g of enriched metal powder on loan from Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. In fact, this was the same material as used in previous experiments [5, 4].
The 186Os and 187Os samples were enriched to 79% and 70 % with a 188Os content of 5% and
∼13%, respectively. The (n,γ) cross section of 188Os was measured as well using a 95% enriched
sample in order to account for the main isotopic correction. The impurities due to 189Os, 190Os,
and 192Os were all around 5%. The sample material was encapsulated in thin aluminium cans, 15
mm in diameter.

Figure 1: Comparison between the present re-
sults (full circles with error bars) and the data
of Winters et al. [5] (triangles) and of Browne
and Berman [4] (stars), complemented by a re-
cent statistical model calculation (solid line).
The present results are composed of averaged
cross sections obtained from detailed reso-
nance analyses (below 3 keV for 186Os and
188Os and below 2 keV for 187Os) and from
the continuum part at higher energies.

The γ-ray cascades from capture events have been detected with two C6D6 scintillators (12 cm
in diameter and each with a volume of ≈ 1l), which were placed perpendicular to the neutron
beam. A neutron monitor consisting of a thin 6Li foil was used for flux normalization, which
was surrounded by a set of four Si detectors mounted outside the neutron beam for recording
the products of the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction. The γ-detectors were designed to minimize the neutron
sensitivity [10]. The signals from the C6D6 scintillators were recorded with flash amplitude-to-
digital converters (FADC) for off-line application of the pulse height weighting technique (PHWT)
[11]. In this way, the detection efficiency was obtained to be independent of the multiplicity of the
prompt capture γ-ray cascade. The Os samples were complemented by a set of samples that served
for evaluation of the background and normalization. These were a carbon sample for the effect of
scattered neutrons, a lead sample for the scattering of in-beam γ-rays, a gold sample for neutron
flux normalization, and an empty position for obtaining the ambient background component.

All samples were mounted on the ladder of a remotely controlled sample changer. Normal-
ization to equal neutron flux was achieved by means of the Si neutron monitor and by calibration
runs with the gold sample. The cross sections were normalized to the gold reference cross section
using the accurate experimental average value at 25 keV [12]. The background components in the
spectra of the Os samples and of the gold sample have been treated individually. In particular, the
weighting functions were determined by a complete simulation of the experimental setup, includ-
ing the effect of the sample itself. The evaluated background has been validated by comparison
with spectra obtained with black neutron filters in the beam.

The analysis of the data and the calculation of the cross section were treated in the resolved
resonance region and in the continuum part in different ways. The resolved resonance region has
been analyzed by the R-matrix code SAMMY. Individual resonance parameters were considered

up to 3 keV neutron energy for 186Os and 188Os and up to 2 keV for 187Os.
The cross section in the continuum has been determined by subtracting the properly normal-

ized background and by applying the corrections for self-absorption and multiple scattering ob-
tained with the SESH code [13] as well as the respective isotopic corrections. The background
obtained by the SAMMY analysis was found in excellent agreement with the result of the direct
measurement and provided an independent confirmation of the background subtraction method
used.

The final cross sections plotted in Fig. 1 were calculated by combining the average data from
the resonance analysis and from the continuum region. The comparison in Fig. 1 shows good
agreement with previous data for 186Os and 187Os, whereas significant differences with respect to
previous measurements are found for 188Os. Up to 400 keV the present results are well described
by the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model calculations.

plemented by the recommended data of dBao
[15]. The insets focus on the values at kT = 30
keV, which are commonly used for compari-
son.

The MACSs have been evaluated for thermal energies from 5 keV to 100 keV (Fig. 2). At kT
= 30 keV, the present results for 188Os is 27% lower than the recommended value [15], whereas
that for 186Os is in agreement with all previous measurements and with the recommendation of
Ref. [15]. For 187Os the present result is in agreement with the data of Browne and Berman [4] and
of Bokhovko et al. [14], but 7% higher than that of Ref. [15].

During the s process reaction flow equilibrium has been locally established from the mass
region of the rare earth elements up to A = 190 due to the comparably large MACSs of the involved

isotopes. This implies that the local approximation Ns × 〈σ〉 = constant holds to a very good
approximation. Comparison of the Ns ×〈σ〉 products of the two s-only isotopes 186Os and 187Os
can, therefore, be used for deriving the excess 187Os from the measured ratio of the stellar MACS
of 187Os and 186Os. This excess corresponds to the radiogenic component due to the decay of the
long-lived 187Re.

Based on the measured cross sections, the MACS ratio is 186/187 = 0.42 ± 0.02. Under the
assumption of the coarse Fowler model [16] for galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and neglecting
the time prior to the formation of our Galaxy, the age of the Universe is estimated to be around
14.5 Gyr. By including the stellar enhancement factor for the MACS of 187Os from Ref. [15], this
ratio reduces to 0.36 ± 0.02, yielding a slightly higher age of 16 ± 2 Gyr, somewhat higher than
the U/Th age of 14.5 ± 2.82.2 Gyr [17] and than the results based on cosmological evidence [18]. This
very preliminary result has yet to be verified by means of an improved evaluation of the stellar
enhancement factor and by using a more realistic galactic evolution model.

3. Inelastic scattering experiment at FZK

The neutron inelastic scattering cross section of 187Os has been measured at the 3.7 MV Van de
Graaff of Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe using the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction for obtaining a "monoen-
ergetic" neutron beam of 30 keV. The energy of the pulsed proton beam (∆t = 10 ns) was adjusted
right at the (p,n) threshold to produce kinematically collimated neutrons, which are emitted in a
narrow cone with an opening angle of not more than 13 deg and an energy spread of less than 10
keV. In this way, neutron collimators could be avoided because the detectors for scattered neutrons
could be placed outside the main neutron beam. The γ-ray flash from the impact of the proton pulse
on the 7Li target was reduced by a small lead shield around the target.

Experimental challenges for the Re/Os clock Marita Mosconi

The measurement have been performed with the same 187Os and 188Os samples as used in the
neutron capture experiment in order to avoid losses of the expensive material. The samples were
mounted 4 cm in front of the Li target under an angle of 45 deg with respect to the proton beam
in order to minimize self shielding effects. Scattered neutrons were detected by three 6Li-glass
scintillators 3 mm in thickness and 12 cm in diameter, two at 90 deg and one at 75 deg relative
to the direction of the primary beam, all placed at a distance of 26 cm from the scattering sample.
An additional 3 mm thick 6Li-glass scintillator 38 mm in diameter, which was mounted in forward
direction at 111 cm from the 7Li target, served as a monitor for the primary neutron flux. The data
acquisition system consisted of a set of four FADCs, which had the advantage of a detailed off-line
analysis of the recorded signals. In this way, the signal/background ratio could be improved by
pulse shape discrimination between neutrons and γ-rays.

During the measurements the proton energy was tuned such that the FWHM of the neutron
energy distribution was below 10 keV. Due to the normal charge fluctuation of the Van de Graaff,
the width of the distribution varied between 7 and 10 keV in cycles of several hours.

The separation of the elastic and inelastic scattering component was obtained by measuring
the neutron energies via TOF and by using the elastic component from the scattering spectrum of
188Os. The inelastic part can then be extracted by a fit assuming that the inelastic component is
represented by the same distribution shifted in energy by the 9.75 keV excitation energy of the first
excited state of 187Os. In this way, the fit contains only two free parameters, namely the amplitudes
of the elastic and inelastic distributions. This analysis is in progress; a preliminary result is shown
in Fig. 3.

4. Conclusions and remarks

The challenges related to the neutron capture cross section measurements have been met:
the n_TOF cross sections are available in the entire range of astrophysical interest with typical
uncertainties of 5%. The data exhibit clear signatures for the competition of the inelastic channel,
which had previously not been found for 186Os. A final statement concerning the Re/Os clock must
await completion of the analysis of the inelastic scattering cross section. Presently, the data seem
to indicate an older age of the universe than obtained with other methods, but this may well be due
to the very crude GCE model used so far.
