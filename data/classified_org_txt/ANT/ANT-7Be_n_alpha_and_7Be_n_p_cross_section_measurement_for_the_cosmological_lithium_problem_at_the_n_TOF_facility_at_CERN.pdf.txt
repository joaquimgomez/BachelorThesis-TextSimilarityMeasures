Abstract. The Cosmological Lithium Problem refers to the large discrepancy between the abundance of
primordial 7Li predicted by the standard theory of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the value inferred from
the so-called “Spite plateau” in halo stars. A possible explanation for this longstanding puzzle in Nuclear
Astrophysics is related to the incorrect estimation of the destruction rate of 7Be, which is responsible for the
production of 95% of primordial Lithium. While charged-particle induced reactions have mostly been ruled
out, data on the 7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) reactions are scarce or completely missing, so that a large uncertainty
still affects the abundance of 7Li predicted by the standard theory of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Both reactions
have been measured at the n TOF facility at CERN, providing for the first time data in a wide neutron energy
range.

1. Introduction
The innovative neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF based
on a neutron spallation source, was built at CERN with the
aim of addressing the request of high accuracy nuclear data
for Nuclear Astrophysics and for advanced nuclear energy
systems [1]. In particular Nuclear Astrophysics presents
many cases that require high precision neutron induced
reaction data, for example to improve modelling of stellar
Nucleosynthesis and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

One of the most important unresolved problems in
Nuclear Astrophysics is the so-called “Cosmological
Lithium problem” (CLiP) [2]. It refers to the large
discrepancy (factor 2–3) between the abundance of
primordial 7Li predicted by the standard theory of Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the value inferred
from the so-called “Spite plateau” in halo stars. In the
framework of Standard Model, a possible explanation
for this longstanding puzzle is related to the incorrect
estimation of the destruction rate of 7Be. Indeed in
the standard theory of BBN, 95% of primordial 7Li is
produced by the decay of 7Be (t1/2 = 53.2 days), relatively
late after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the
Universe was low enough to allow for electrons and nuclei
to combine into atoms. Therefore, the abundance of 7Li is
essentially determined by the production and destruction
of 7Be at temperature values between 0.2 < T9 < 1.2,
corresponding to neutron energy between about 20 keV
and 120 keV.

Charged-particle induced reactions responsible for
the destruction of 7Be are known with satisfactory
accuracy. On the other hand data on neutron induced
reactions, namely 7Be(n,α)4He and 7Be(n,p)7Li reactions,
have been so far scarce or completely missing, mainly
due to unsurmountable experimental difficulties arising
from 7Be specific activity (∼13 GBq/µg). Concerning
7Be(n,α) reaction cross-section, only one measurement
exists, performed at thermal energy in the 60’s [3]. This
cross section was then extrapolated to the energy range
of interest for BBN in a compilation by Wagoner [4].

On the other hand 7Be(n,p) reaction, that represents the
leading channel among 7Be destruction processes during
BBN [5], has been measured in the 80’s and cross-section
determined only up to 13.5 keV [6].

Taking advantage of state-of-art techniques for the
production of high-purity radioactive samples, of high
performance detection systems and, especially, of the in-
novative features of a new beam line and measuring station
(EAR2) particularly suited for challenging measurements
on short-lived radioisotopes, both (n,α) and (n,p) reaction
cross-sections on 7Be have been recently measured at
n TOF (CERN).

The two measurements, performed with two different
silicon detection systems, provide for the first time nuclear
data on 7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) cross-section in a wide
neutron energy range, allowing to clarify the role of these
reactions in Nuclear Astrophysics.

2. The n TOF facility
The facility is based on the 7 ns wide, 20 GeV/c pulsed
proton beam from CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) with
typically 7 × 1012 protons per pulse, impinging on a lead
spallation target. The process yields about 300 neutrons
per incident proton, which are subsequently collimated and
guided trough two beam lines to different experimental
areas (EAR1 and EAR2, located respectively at ∼180 m
and ∼20 m from the spallation target) where the samples
under investigation and the detection systems are located.
A layer of selected liquid (i.e demineralized water or
borated water) around the spallation target moderates the
initially fast neutrons down to a white energy spectrum,
which spans from meV to GeV neutron energy [7]. In order
to avoid the overlap of consecutive neutron bunches, the
time distance between two consecutive proton pulses is a
multiple of 1.2 s, related to PS working cycle.

Both 7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) reaction cross-sections
have been measured at the newly built second experimental
area, n TOF-EAR2, that is characterized by an extremely

high intensity neutron flux (∼107 neutrons/pulse), about
30 times more intense than EAR1 [8], as shown in Fig. 1.
The availability of a pulsed and high luminosity neutron
beam makes EAR2 ideal for measurements on isotopes
available in very small amounts, with short half-lives, or
both, as indeed is the case for 7Be.

3. Measurement and results of the
7Be(n,α) reaction cross-section
7Be(n,α)4He reaction is characterized by a Q-value of
18.99 MeV. At the neutron energies under investigation,
the two alpha-particles are emitted back-to-back with a
maximum energy of 9.5 MeV each, depending on the
8Be state populated in the reaction that proceeds indeed
trough energy levels populated by γ -ray transitions. In
the present measurement few of them were experimentally
accessible, the partial cross-sections for the corresponding
7Be(n,γα)4He reactions were therefore measured and later
on the total cross-section was determined as described in
details in Ref. [9].

The detection system used in the measurement
consisted of two detector sandwiches, each sandwich
composed by two single pad silicon detectors 140 µm
thick and 3 × 3 cm2 wide. Each sandwich hosted a 1.4 µg
7Be sample, corresponding to about 20 GBq activity.
Both samples were prepared at Paul Scherrer Institute
(PSI) [10], although two different techniques were used
to produce them. The first sample was electroplated on a
5 µm thick Al foil and the second one was prepared by
droplet deposition on a 0.6 µm thick polyethylene foil.
More details about the experimental setup and samples
can be found in Ref. [11,12]. The stack of detectors and
7Be samples was placed in air inside a scattering chamber
shielded by 1 cm lead in order to reduce the external dose
due to the 478 keV γ -rays arising from the 7Be decay and,
consequently, to facilitate transportation and operations in
proximity of the setup. The whole assembly was placed
in the neutron beam. Prior to the 7Be(n,α) measurement,
the performances of the detection system, particularly its
radiation hardness and its capability of detecting high
energy charged particles and rejecting background even
if exposed to an extremely harsh environment, were fully
tested, proving the feasibility of the measurement [13].

Such a system allowed to detect in coincidence the
alpha particles emitted, providing a peculiar signature
of the occurrence of 7Be(n,γα) reactions and a strong

detectors of the stack. Top left and bottom right plot refer to pairs

back coincidences not present in uncorrelated pairs of silicons.

rejection of any other source of background. Furthermore,
the use of two different sandwich detectors provided
redundancy and allowed on the one hand to compare the
rate of true events, and on the other hand to estimate the
background related to random coincidences evaluated by
analyzing uncorrelated pairs of detectors. The real and
random coincidences can be clearly distinguished in Fig. 2,
which shows the amplitude correlation for all silicon pairs:
top-left and bottom-right panels are related to pairs of
silicon hosting the 7Be samples while all the others refer
to uncorrelated pairs of detectors.

Applying proper thresholds allowed to select coinci-
dence events as a function of neutron energy and finally
to determine the cross-section of the 7Be(n,α) reaction
in the energy range 10 meV–10 keV [9]. The result of
this measurement at thermal energy was found to be
consistent with the only previous existing measurement.
In the energy range of interest for BBN the present data
indicate that Wagoner’s compilation overestimates by a
factor of 10 the reaction rate. The results of the present
measurement leave unresolved the Cosmological Lithium
Problem, whose solution should then be searched in other
physical scenarios.

4. Measurement of the 7Be(n,p) reaction
cross-section
In order to complete the n TOF program on the CLiP,
the 7Be(n,p)7Li cross-section was also measured. The
measurement was performed by detecting the emerging
protons, emitted either with energy equal to 1.44 MeV
(b.r.∼99%) or with 1.02 MeV (b.r.∼1%), depending on
the state of 8Li populated in the process. In this case the
detection system consisted in a telescope made of 20 µm
and 300 µm silicon strips detector, 5 × 5 cm2 active area.
The system was previously characterized at n TOF-EAR2
using the well-known 6Li(n,t)4He reaction, and the results
of this measurement showed that low energy charged
particles could be easily discriminated from background
in the telescope.

Contrarily to outcoming α-particles emitted in
7Be(n,α)4He reaction, low energy protons emitted here
do not represent a strong signature of the occurrence of
the 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction, so in order to avoid a priori
some background, an extremely high purity sample had
to be used. It has been realized starting from 200 GBq of

7Be collected from the neutron spallation source SINQ at
PSI. After chemical purification it has been made available
in the form of nitrate solution to the ISOLDE facility
at CERN [14], where a 7Be beam has been produced,
accelerated to 30 keV, isotopically separated at the GLM
beam line and implanted on a 18 µm aluminum backing.
A sample of ∼1.1 GBq total activity was prepared and
successively installed at the EAR2 neutron beam line at
n TOF.

At n TOF the sample was tilted of 45◦ with respect the
incident direction of the neutron beam and protons from
the reaction detected and identified in the telescope, as
clearly shown in Fig. 3. A preliminary analysis indicates
that it will be possible to determine the cross section of
the 7Be(n,p) reaction from thermal neutron energy to a few
hundred keV, thus covering for the first time the region of
interest for BBN, from 20 to 200 keV, and sheding some
light on the longstanding CLiP problem.

5. Conclusions
In order to investigate on Nuclear Physics solutions to
the long standing Cosmological Lithium Problem, the
7Be(n,α) and 7Be(n,p) reaction cross-sections have been
measured in a wide energy range at the n TOF facility in
the new, high flux, experimental area (EAR2).

The 7Be(n,α)4He measurement has revealed that the
reaction rate used in BBN calculation has been so far
overestimated, leaving then the problem unsolved. On the
other hand preliminary results on 7Be(n,p)7Li reaction
look extremely promising, already proving that a final
word on the role of this reaction in BBN can be provided
by this measurement.
