The neutron-induced fission cross section of 237Np was experimentally determined at the high-resolution
and high-intensity facility n TOF, at CERN, in the energy range 100 keV to 9 MeV, using the 235U(n,f ) and
238U(n,f ) cross section standards below and above 2 MeV, respectively. A fast ionization chamber was used
in order to detect the fission fragments from the reactions and the targets were characterized as far as their
mass and homogeneity are concerned by means of α spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy
respectively. Theoretical calculations within the Hauser-Feshbach formalism have been performed, employing
the EMPIRE code, and the model parameters were tuned in order to successfully reproduce the experimental fission
cross-sectional data and simultaneously all the competing reaction channels.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of neutron-induced reactions on minor actinides
is of considerable importance in diverse fields of research,
from fundamental to applied nuclear physics.

Fission is one of the most challenging and not well known
phenomena in nuclear physics and, at present, an ab initio
theory able to predict fission cross sections as well as the char-
acteristics of the fission process does not exist. The theoretical
investigation of the cross section for the fission channel is
mainly based on phenomenological analyses with parameters
that need to be tuned in order to reproduce the experimental
data. Thus, highly accurate data are needed for the testing of the
existing nuclear models and consequently for the improvement
of their predictive power. Furthermore, the development of the
new generation of the nuclear reactor technology, which aims
at safer and cleaner energy production (generation IV: so-
called fast reactors, partitioning and transmutation techniques,
etc.), requires highly accurate cross-sectional data of all the
neutron-induced reactions mainly on minor actinides. 237Np
is one of the priorities, because it is found in great abundance
in spent nuclear reactor fuel and has a very long half-life
(∼106 years). Therefore, the accurate determination of the
cross section for all neutron-induced reactions on this isotope
is of great importance in order to reduce the uncertainties in
the design of the new systems, with fission being one of the
dominant channels over a wide neutron energy range.

There are a number of cross-sectional data on the
237Np(n,f ) reaction in the international database EXFOR [1],
most using 235U(n,f ) as reference [2–18], as well as
237Np/ 235U fission cross-sectional ratios [19–22]. However,
these data exhibit discrepancies that reach 8%, mainly at
the first and second chance fission plateaus. Furthermore,
the evaluations ENDF/B-VII.1 [23], JENDL-4.0 [24], JEFF-
3.2 [25], CENDL 3.1 [26], and ROSFOND-2010 [27] present

differences of 3–4%. Such differences, although small, in-
crease the uncertainties of the design of new reactor systems
and limit the nuclear model predictive power. Accordingly,
the remeasurement of this dataset is essential. The n TOF
Collaboration [28] aims at providing highly accurate data
on neutron-induced reactions, mainly for the requirements of
advanced nuclear technologies and nuclear astrophysics, using
the CERN Neutron Time-of-Flight (n TOF) facility. In this
context, the fission cross-sectional measurements on actinides
are an important part of these studies. In the present work, the
measurement of the 237Np(n,f ) cross section with reference
to the standard 235U(n,f ) and 238U(n,f ) cross sections was
performed at n TOF using a fast ionization chamber [29] in
the energy range 0.1 to 9 MeV. Theoretical calculations of this
cross section were carried out with the EMPIRE code (version
3.2) [30], within the Hauser-Feshbach formalism and with
phenomenological models.

II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

A. The n TOF facility

The CERN n TOF facility [31] is an innovative neutron
source that combines unique features, such as high instanta-
neous flux, a neutron beam covering a wide energy range (from
thermal to several hundreds of MeV), high resolution, and low
background. The white neutron beam at n TOF is produced
via the spallation of protons with a momentum of 20 GeV/c
on a thick lead target. The pulsed proton beam (∼7 × 1012
protons per pulse) is provided by the proton synchrotron (PS)
accelerator complex of CERN, in the form of short pulses
of 7 ns (1 σ ) with a relatively low repetition rate (∼0.25
Hz), thus avoiding the overlapping of two sequential neutron
pulses, since the thermal neutrons reach the experimental area
approximately 80 ms after the proton pulse hits the lead target.
Furthermore, the high produced neutron flux within a small
time interval limits the acquisition time and consequently
maximizes the signal-to-background ratio.

The neutrons produced from the spallation cover a long
flight path of 182.5 m in a vacuum tube before entering the
experimental area. The neutron energies E are defined with the
time-of-flight (TOF) technique. Thanks to the long flight path
the facility presents an excellent neutron energy resolution, up
to �E/E = 10−4 for thermal neutrons and 0.06 for neutrons
with energies close to GeV. Before entering the experimental

area, the neutron beam is shaped by two collimators, the
inner diameter of the second one varying, depending on the
type of measurement performed: For fission cross-sectional
measurements an inner diameter of 8 cm is used since the
sample material is deposited on a large surface in order to allow
for thin samples, associated with the smallest possible self-
absorption of the fission fragments (FF). The contamination
of the neutron beam with charged particles is minimized by a
1.5-T sweeping magnet. Shielding walls made of concrete and
iron are severely reducing the background in the experimental
area. The neutron beam line is extended for 12 m after the
experimental area to the beam dump, made of polyethylene
and cadmium in order to reduce the neutron backscattering.
More details on the facility can be found in Refs. [31–33].

B. Fission detection setup

The fission detection setup used for the data analyzed in this
work consisted of a fast ionization chamber (FIC) with fast tim-
ing properties, built for neutron-induced fission cross-sectional
measurements on minor actinides at the n TOF facility [29].
This detector was developed in collaboration between the Joint
Institute of Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, the Institute of
Physics and Power Engineering (IPPE), Obninsk (Russian
Federation), and the Emerging Energy Technologies (EET)
section of CERN. The detector consisted of a stack of cells
each consisting of three electrodes. The central Al electrode,
of 100-μm thickness, was actually the backing of the actinide
targets and in most of the cases it was plated on both sides.
The external electrodes, of 15-μm thickness, are used to define
the electric field in the 0.5-cm-thick active gas-filled volume
of the detector. The detector gas was Ar (90%)/CF4 (10%),
presenting high electron drift velocity. Since the detector was
not working in proportional mode, gas circulation was not
needed. The gas pressure was ∼720 mbar. As reported in
Ref. [29], detailed Monte Carlo simulations showed that the
attenuation factor in each detector cell, defined as the ratio of
the transmitted neutron flux to the impinging neutron flux, is
of the order of a few per thousand, with a total attenuation after
14 samples of less than 1%. Another important result is that the
background induced by scattered neutrons in the materials of
the detector is negligible. The distance between the spallation
target and the first sample in the FIC detector was 185.4 m.

C. The targets

The detector chamber was housing a stack of 18 actinide
samples, among them a 237Np target and three 235U and three
238U reference targets, provided by the IPPE and the JINR. The
actinide oxide targets were thin layers of 8 or 5 cm in diameter
deposited on a 100-μm-thick Al backing with the painting
technique. The 237Np target and one from the 235U and
238U targets were characterized as far as the mass, thickness,
and homogeneity are concerned. The experimental procedure,
analysis, and results are described in detail in Refs. [2] and [34]
and are briefly mentioned in the following paragraphs.

The total mass and isotopic impurities of the targets
were determined via α spectroscopy. The activity of each
target was measured with two Silicon Surface Barrier (SSB)

TABLE I. The FIC detector samples used in this work. The rest
of the targets in the chamber are not reported here. All the targets
except U5c are double sided and the total mass refers to the sum of
the masses of the two sides of the target.

detectors with different active surface areas. A small detector
with 50 mm2 was used in order to obtain good energy
resolution, whereas a big detector with 3000 mm2 was used
for higher counting statistics. The solid angle between sample
and detectors was determined with a calibrated 241Am α
source (uncertainty of 0.3%) complemented by numerical
disk-to-disk solid angle calculations. The weighted average
value was adopted as the final result, with uncertainties of less
than 2%. The isotopic impurities of the targets were estimated
with the same method and turned out to be negligible.

The properties of the targets are summarized in Table I.
As already mentioned, for three of the targets the mass was
experimentally determined, while for the rest of the targets
the nominal mass values provided by the manufacturer were
assumed, with an estimated uncertainty of 2%.

The actinide targets were examined as far as their thickness
and homogeneity are concerned via Rutherford backscattering
spectrometry (RBS) at the external ion-beam setup of the
5.5-MV HV TN-11 tandem accelerator of the Institute of
Nuclear and Particle Physics at the N.C.S.R. “Demokritos,”
using a proton beam of 2 MeV. For each target 5–10 points
were selected in order to check the homogeneity, and the
spectra obtained were analyzed with SIMNRA v. 6.06 [35].
The targets turned out to be homogeneous within 10–15%
(obtained from the standard deviation of the thickness of the
points checked) and did not present any systematic trend, for
example, less material at the edges or identical values at points
of equal distance from the center of the target. This result,
in combination with the smooth neutron beam profile, led to
the conclusion that the effect of the target inhomogeneities on
the final cross section results is negligible. The targets were
additionally characterized for their homogeneity with the use
of CR-39 detectors. The 10 × 10 cm2 detectors were placed
on top of the samples for exposure times of a few seconds
to a few hours, depending on the activity of the sample, in
order to achieve a surface-track concentration of at least 200
tracks/mm2. The results were in good agreement with the RBS
measurements, showing inhomogeneities of less than 17%.

III. DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS

Fission reactions were detected via the energy deposited
in the gas by the fission fragments. The detector signals were
digitized by means of flash analog to digital converters (FADC,

LeCroy), with a sampling rate of 40 MHz. The FADC recorded
the signal in a time window of 100 μs, which corresponds to
neutron energies from GeV down to ∼20 keV. The trigger
signal for the start of the data acquisition is derived from a
pickup in the proton beam line close to the lead target. The
first signal to be recorded is the so-called γ flash produced by
the impact of the proton pulse on the lead target. The γ flash
consists of γ rays and relativistic particles from spallation
processes in the target and of secondary particles produced
in the experimental area. This signal serves for the accurate
determination of the neutron time of flight. However, the large
energy deposition of the γ flash causes malfunctions in the
detector electronics, resulting in an undershooting of the signal
baseline and intense rippling, especially for time bins in the
early phase of the FADC event (bins ∼50–400 in Fig. 1).

In view of these difficulties, a method based on pulse shape
analysis techniques was developed for analyzing the FADC
data in an automated way to provide a reliable background
subtraction and identification of FF peaks even at high
energies [36,37]. Starting from the observation that all the
events follow the same baseline pattern in this region, an
average FADC event (“average event”) was produced for each
detector channel by averaging many events starting from the
time of the γ flash. This average event is free of FF peaks
because they appear at random times. Due to the large number
of bins available for the recording of the FIC signal, providing
a time resolution of 25 ns, the possibility of having FF peaks
that appear in the same time bin of the FADC event (i.e., the
same time of flight) is indeed negligible.

For the analysis of individual events, the average event was
fitted with a linear function in order to reproduce the baseline of
the raw signal (“fitted average event”). Then, the fitted average
event was subtracted from the event under analysis, thus
removing the baseline oscillations. Then, the corrected event
from baseline oscillations (Fig. 1) was checked, bin by bin, and
if the threshold chosen is surpassed the code searches for local
maxima until the background level chosen is reached. Then the
FF peak candidates are fitted with Eq. (1) of Ref. [36], using the

MINUIT code [38]. The γ -flash peak was fitted with the same
function. Both the threshold and background levels are chosen
by the user. A typical example of the signal analysis is given in
Fig. 1. In order to have the average events as close as possible
to the baseline of the raw data, the events were grouped into
categories with similar γ -flash integral and an average event
was extracted from each category. For the analysis of each
event, the corresponding average event was chosen.

The baseline subtraction based on the average event gives
the possibility to extract FF peaks even if they are very close to
the γ flash, where the oscillations are severe. However, these
oscillations caused signal saturations in some cases, especially
in the neutron energy region above 9–10 MeV (i.e., for bins
<200). This problem limited the neutron energy range of the
present work to En < 9 MeV.

The parameters and errors from the fit of the average event,
of the γ -flash peak, and of the FF peaks are stored in histograms
for further selection. With this information, it is possible to
reject events or FF peaks by reducing the parameter space
for the γ flash, the average event, or the FF signals. For each
target a separate analysis was performed to define the accepted
limits of the fitting parameters and corresponding errors. In
total, about 4 × 105 events were accepted per target, with a
very small percentage of rejected events. A typical amplitude
distribution of the accepted FF pulses from the analysis of
237Np is shown in Fig. 2.

A. Sensitivity tests

The sensitivity of the results with respect to various
procedures used in data analysis was examined to estimate
possible systematic uncertainties. In the following, the low FF
counting rate targets (U5c, U8c, U8a, U8b) correspond to the
ones with low mass and/or low fission cross-sectional value
at the so-called plateau (FADC bins below 400, i.e., neutron
energies higher than ∼2 MeV), and higher FF counting rate
targets (Np7, U5b, U5a) correspond to targets with high mass
and cross-sectional values in this energy region.

NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION CROSS SECTION OF . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 93, 034614 (2016)

First, the events were grouped into categories with similar
γ -flash integral and an average event was extracted from each
group. Various categorizations were tried in order to find the
best settings by checking the raw data and the reaction rate of
each target. Due to the large similarity of the oscillation pattern
after the γ flash, the reproduction of the baseline of the raw
data by the fitted average events was found to be insensitive to
the categorization chosen. Some differences in the early phase
of the FADC event, where the frequency of the FFs is higher,
were noticed in the reproduction of the baseline between the
targets with low FF counting rate and those with higher FF
counting rate. For the former, the reproduction of the baseline
by the fitted average event was very good. In the case of the
latter, the fitted average event often slightly overestimated the
baseline in the bin region 300–700, the high FF counting rate in
this region making the smoothing procedure more difficult. For
these targets a coarser categorization was preferred because the
reproduction of the baseline was improved (due to the better
statistics in each category). However, the differences in the
final reaction rates for different categorizations of the events
did not exceed the corresponding statistical uncertainties in
the whole neutron energy range examined, for all the targets.

Second, the sensitivity of the results on the choice of
the threshold level chosen was examined. Various threshold
values within reasonable limits were tried by checking the
resulting amplitude distributions within the uncertainties of the
fit parameters. It was shown that the results of the pulse shape
analysis do not significantly change, although the differences
were becoming larger at higher neutron energies where the
oscillations of the raw data are stronger. But even in this case
mainly the low amplitude pulses were affected and the final
reaction rates varied only within 2–3% for all targets. By
checking the effect of the different threshold values on the
analysis of the raw data, the resulting pulse shape analysis
parameters, and the corresponding uncertainties, a common
threshold was chosen for the analysis for all the targets.

The choice of the background level determines the point
at which the code quits looking for another local maximum
and fits the peak(s) found. A study of the sensitivity of
the results on this parameter was thus considered essential,
especially for higher FF rate targets, where nonisolated peaks
are more frequent. The effect of various background levels on
the amplitude distribution of the FF peaks in the case of the Np7
target is illustrated in Fig. 3. Similar amplitude distributions
were obtained for the other six targets. The differences are
again mainly found in the low part of the FF distributions.
Finally, an additional threshold was applied to exclude the
residual low amplitude peaks which were sensitive to changes
of the analysis parameters. This threshold was chosen to be at
the minimum between the low amplitude peak and the main
peak of the FF distribution with background level 0 (Fig. 3).

the analysis threshold, Si is the correction factors for the

additional analysis threshold chosen, see Fig. 2), Ni is
the corresponding number of target nuclei, �i is the total
number of protons impinging on the spallation target used for
normalization to equal neutron flux, and �i is the efficiency
correction factor due to the loss of FFs in the sample. Ai is the
neutron beam interception factor, and in fission measurements
Atar/Aref is equal to unity if the two targets are of equal
diameter. The normalization to the number of protons, �i ,
was introduced in order to account for the small difference
in the number of accepted events between the targets. The
systematic uncertainty induced by the �ref /�tar factor was of
the order of a few ‰, due to the very small percentage of
rejected events, and thus was considered negligible.

The efficiency correction due to the self-absorption of
the FFs in the samples as well as the percentage of the FF
counts below the threshold were estimated via Monte Carlo
simulations performed with the code FLUKA [39]. In the latest
versions of FLUKA the stopping power models have been
thoroughly reworked and are more precise, particularly for
heavy ions: the Barkas (Z3), Bloch (Z4), and Mott corrections
have been implemented, and the nuclear stopping power is
calculated and taken into account. The geometry of each target
cell and the respective target side thickness (determined in
the RBS measurements, assuming the stoichiometry as NpO2,
U3O8) were properly considered. The generation of the FFs
was performed with an external routine. The mass and charge
distributions of the FFs for each isotope, as well as the total
kinetic energy provided to both FFs (heavy and light) after
the fission reaction, were determined from systematics of the
actinide region [40,41]. The energy deposition of the FFs in
the detector gas was subsequently scored.

The efficiency �i was calculated by the ratio of the FFs
depositing energy in the gas to the total number of FFs
generated. The results for all the targets are presented in
Table II. The loss of FFs in the targets does not exceed 3.5%
for the thicker one (U8c). Thanks to the high statistics of the
simulations, the corresponding statistical uncertainty was less

than ∼0.1% for the sum of heavy and light FFs, while the
systematic uncertainty of these calculations was estimated to
be about 2%.

The Si correction was calculated from the simulated energy
deposition histograms. In principle this requires the calibration
of the experimental amplitude distributions, in order to find
the energy corresponding to the bin of the threshold chosen
in the analysis. The major difficulty in this case is that the
amplitude distribution does not exhibit discrete heavy and light
FF peaks as the simulated histograms, due to the nonpropor-
tionality of the detector and the electronic chain. Therefore,
the experimental amplitude distribution was fitted with two
Gaussian peaks, skewed with a tail towards lower amplitudes,
as predicted by the simulations. Two spectra analysis programs
were used for this fitting, SPECTRW [42] and TV [43], in order
to check the sensitivity and to estimate the related systematic
uncertainty. The reproduction of the experimental distribution
with two Gaussians of equal area and different shape was sat-
isfactory (integral values agreed within 1%), and the centroids
of these Gaussians were used to calibrate the experimental am-
plitude distributions. The energies attributed to the thresholds
chosen varied from 30 to 36 MeV for the different targets, thus
excluding possible counts from α particles. The calculated
correction factors for the subthreshold FF counts, Si , can be
found in Table II. The analyses with the two programs changed
the energy attributed to the threshold chosen by less than 5
MeV. The resulting systematic uncertainty of the calculated
Starget values depended on the quality of the fit and the thickness
of the target and was less than 1% in the worst case (U8c). The
corresponding statistical uncertainties were negligible.

As reference, the cross section of the 235U(n,f ) reaction
was used up to 2 MeV and the 238U(n,f ) reaction up to 9 MeV.
In order to validate the analysis procedure, the 238U(n,f ) cross
section was calculated and compared to the recommended
values in the neutron energy range where it is considered a
standard. The cross section of the 238U(n,f ) reaction taking
U8c as target and U5c and U5b as reference targets, is
compared in Fig. 4 with the data from the ENDF/B VII-1 [23]
evaluation. The present results generally agree with the ENDF
evaluation, thus giving confidence on the normalization factors
used.

However, the 238U(n,f ) cross-sectional data obtained with
the big diameter targets, i.e., U8a, U8b, and U5a, slightly
overestimated the evaluated cross sections for neutron energies

in the energy range 0.6–4 MeV. It was found that this effect was
due to loss of FF pulses in the analysis of the U5a target, which
was by far the most massive. In this energy region both the
235U(n,f ) cross section and the n TOF flux are large so that
the FF peaks were not completely smeared out in the average
event. The fitted average event thus overestimated the baseline
of the corresponding event and consequently the shape of the
FF pulses was in some cases deformed and not recognized
by the routine. By checking on an event-by-event basis, the
resulting losses never exceeded 3–3.5% in this neutron energy
region, but depended on the neutron energy. In order to
avoid such systematic uncertainties in the final cross-sectional
values, it was decided to use the U5b as reference target for
the cross section in this neutron energy range (400 keV to 2
MeV) because it has a FF rate very close to Np7.

Nevertheless, the Np7 (8 cm diameter) and the reference
U5b target (5 cm diameter) have different surfaces, and thus
Atar/Aref in Eq. (1) is not equal to unity, so the difference
in the neutron beam flux had to be carefully taken into
account. Monte Carlo simulations of the neutron beam profile
of the n TOF facility [44], assuming perfect alignment of
the collimators, show that in the energy range 1 keV to 10
MeV the beam profile is practically stable with reference
to the neutron beam and there is a small neutron fluence
decrease at the edges of the 8-cm targets. Consequently, the
ratio of the simulated fluence impinging on the surface of
the 8-cm-diameter target is predicted to be ∼4% lower than
the corresponding value for the 5-cm-diameter target. These
fluence differences were determined experimentally, using the
reaction rates and cross-sectional ratios with the low FF rate
targets of different surfaces, as explained below.

was found that such reaction rate ratios from different
target combinations were lower than unity by a constant
factor. An example is shown in Fig. 5, for the reaction
rate ratio RRU8a

RRU8c
. The reaction rate ratios of the U5

targets were also taken into account, in the energy range
1 keV to 400 keV, where no loss of FF pulses was
observed. By fitting experimental reaction rate ratios
with a linear function in energy ranges below 5 MeV,
the weighted average offset value of the fitting was
bRR = 0.905 ± 0.015 while the corresponding slope
was of the order of 10−9 to 10−10 eV−1. Thus the
effective neutron fluence correction was Atar/Aref =
1/bRR = 1.10 ± 0.02.

to the corresponding ENDF/B VII-1 [23] evaluation,
should also be equal to unity. However, also in this
case, the experimental cross-sectional ratio was lower
than unity by a constant factor. Two cross-sectional
ratios were used (U8a and U8b as targets, and U5c as
reference) and by fitting with a linear function in energy
ranges below 5 MeV, the resulting average offset value
was bCS = 0.91 ± 0.02 (the uncertainty corresponds
to the fitting parameter error which was larger than
the standard deviation of the various offsets obtained
in the present case), in very good agreement with the
bRR . The effective neutron fluence correction also in
this case was Atar/Aref = 1/bCS = 1.10 ± 0.02.

The final adopted value of the correction for the effective
neutron fluence in the neutron energy range of interest was
1.10, with an estimated uncertainty of 1.7%. This value
was obtained from ratios of different targets, thus possible
small systematic uncertainties from the mass values and/or
inhomogeneities are assumed to cancel out.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The final cross section values of the 237Np(n,f ) reaction
were determined as follows:

(i) neutron energy range 100–400 keV: The U5a sample
was used as reference target in this neutron energy
region, since it yields good statistics in a TOF region
where the raw data analysis is not problematic, and it is
of the same diameter as Np7. It has to be noted that also
when the U5b and U5c targets are used as reference,
the cross-sectional results were found to agree within
statistical uncertainties, giving more confidence on the
analysis procedure and the normalization factors used
(masses, efficiencies etc).

(ii) neutron energy range 400 keV to 2 MeV: The U5b
target was used as a reference in this energy region,
using Eq. (1) and considering the correction factor for
the difference in the effective neutron fluence.

(iii) neutron energy range above 2 MeV: The U8a and
U8b targets were used as a reference in this energy
region. Two cross-sectional sets were calculated and
the average was adopted as the final result. Consistent
results were obtained with the U5b and the U5c targets
as reference; however, the U8a and U8b targets were
preferred in this energy region mainly because they
have the same diameter as the Np7 target so no
effective neutron fluence correction factor was needed.

The final 237Np(n,f ) cross-sectional values are presented in
Figs. 6 and 7, along with the latest data of Paradela (obtained
from the same facility) [3] and Diakaki [2] (obtained with
the same 237Np target), and the latest evaluated datasets,

statistical uncertainties are shown in the figures. The few bins
containing data at energies of saturations have been removed.
A summary of the estimated systematic uncertainties of the
correction factors of the cross section calculation can be found
in Table III.

The data obtained from this work agree within errors with
the latest data of Ref. [3] and the latest ENDF and JENDL
evaluations up to 1 MeV (Fig. 6), while the latest JEFF
evaluation is systematically slightly lower in the range 600 keV
to 1 MeV. The cross section presents local maxima at ∼1 and
∼1.3 MeV, which appear also in the data of Ref. [3], but only
the first feature appears in the shape of the JEFF evaluation.
In the energy range 1–6 MeV the data from the present work
are somewhat systematically lower than the data of Ref. [3],
although in most of the cases the two datasets agree within
their combined uncertainties, and they agree within errors
with the latest evaluations. Further measurements have been
performed using the same 237Np target as described in Ref. [2]
and the results are shown for comparison in Fig. 7. These

beams and using a Micromegas detector, at the Institute of
Nuclear and Particle Physics at the N.C.S.R. “Demokritos”,

from this measurement are in good agreement with the present
cross-sectional set, giving confidence about the reliability of
the obtained results. From 6 to 9 MeV, at the threshold of

with the data of Ref. [3] and the latest evaluations.

significant differences with those of Jiacoletti [13]. The dataset

V. NUCLEAR MODEL CALCULATIONS

Nuclear model calculations were performed in an effort to
reproduce the experimentally obtained cross-sectional values
with the code EMPIRE [45]. EMPIRE is a widely used modular
system of nuclear reaction codes, comprising various nuclear
models and designed for nuclear reaction calculations over
a wide energy range and incident particle and target com-
binations, and it can be used for theoretical calculations as
well as for nuclear data evaluation. The code accounts for
the major nuclear reaction models, such as the optical model
(for fission as well), coupled channels, DWBA, multistep
direct, multistep compound, pre-equilibrium exciton model,
and the full Hauser-Feshbach model with γ cascade including
width fluctuations for the compound nucleus decay. In the
present study the latest version of EMPIRE was used (version
3.2 [30]). The fission formalism implemented in EMPIRE
has been continuously updated by incorporating fundamental
features of the fission process and it has been shown that
it can reproduce neutron-induced cross sections on light
actinides [46,47]. The optical model for fission considers
the transmission mechanisms through multihumped fission
barriers using a complex optical potential (Vf = V + iW ).
The real part of the barriers V is parametrized by smoothly
joined parabolas as a function of the deformation β. The
parabolas are defined by maxima Bi (humps) and minima BI,II
(wells) and their curvature �ω. The discrete transition states
are rotational levels built on vibrational or noncollective band
heads with given angular momentum J , parity π , and angular
momentum projection on the nuclear symmetry axis K . For
each transition state, there is a parabolic barrier associated
with it. The negative imaginary potential iW is associated with
the discrete vibrational states built on top of the wells. For a
double-humped barrier there is only one well BII and the imag-

inary potential is introduced to simulate damping of the class II
vibrational states in this second well, causing absorption of the
incoming flux. In this version of the model, partial damping
of these states is assumed only. More details on the optical
model for fission can be found in Refs. [48,49]. The EMPIRE
code considers all competing nuclear reaction mechanisms in
the energy range from 1 keV to 20 MeV. Compound nucleus
decay through multiparticle emission and fission is calculated
with the statistical Hauser-Feshbach (HF) [50] and Hofmann-
Richert-Tepel-Weidenmueller (HRTW) models [51]. Direct
interactions and transmission coefficients for the incident
and outgoing channels are obtained from the dispersive
coupled-channel deformed optical model of Ref. [52] using
the coupled-channels code ECIS06 [53]. The fission channel
is treated within the optical model for fission as described
above. Pre-equilibrium emission is calculated with the exciton
PCROSS model [45]. Nuclear level densities for ground-state
and saddle-point deformations are obtained from the Empire
global specific model [45], which is based on the enhanced
generalized superfluid model [54] (including adjustments to
discrete levels). Discrete levels were taken from the RIPL-3
level file [55]. The empirical fission barriers and fission
transitions states of Maslov [55] were used initially for all
nuclei considered in the calculations. Using the default values
of the parameters in the models mentioned in the previous
paragraph, we obtain total, inelastic, fission, and (n, 2 n) cross
sections for incident neutrons on 237Np.

In Fig. 11 the calculated cross sections are compared with
existing data for the above mentioned channels. Since no data
exist for the inelastic channel these cross sections are omitted

from the figures. The total cross sections are reproduced well,
which shows that the optical potential of Ref. [52] is suitable
for this nucleus. The (n,f ) and (n,2n) channels, on the other
hand, show discrepancies between calculations and data. First-
chance fission is seriously underestimated up to 1 MeV, while
above 1 MeV it is overestimated. Also, the (n,2n) cross section
is underestimated and there is no calculation of the production
cross section of the isomeric state of 236Np. An attempt to
improve the description of the data was made and the results are
shown in Fig. 12. The fission cross section is nicely reproduced
over the whole energy range that is herein considered. This
was achieved by making adjustments in the empirical fission
barrier parameters [55] for 238,237,236Np that are summarized
in Table IV.

At first sight, modifications of the order of 20–30% may
seem rather large; however, considering that fission barriers
are not directly measured quantities but their parameters
are extracted indirectly from cross-section measurements and
therefore depend on various model assumptions and other
nuclear parameters such as the level densities, it is reasonable
to expect that the extracted empirical values [55] are associated
with large uncertainties.

representing the 237Np(n,2n) 236Np reaction data and the blue points

In addition, the ratio af /ag.s. was set equal to one, for
both 238Np and 237Np. The level densities at the saddle points
were further rescaled to reproduce the first- and second-chance
fission plateau. The number of transition and vibrational states
over states taken into account on top of the barriers and in the
second well was reduced to those with the smallest bandhead
energies.

To improve the description of the 237Np(n,2n) 236Np chan-
nel, the discrete level scheme of 236Np provided in the RIPL-3
level file [55] was modified. First, the number of discrete levels
in 236Np was changed from Nmax = 1 to 5 to allow for more
than one discrete levels of 236Np to be read by the EMPIRE
code. Thus, not only the long-lived isomer of 1.15 × 105 y
but also the short-lived isomer with 22.5-h half-life could be
included in the calculations. It was thus possible to obtain a
cross section for the production of 236Np in its metastable
state for comparison with existing measurements. To further
improve the ratio of isomeric to ground-state production of
236Np in the (n,2n) channel, the discrete level scheme in the
RIPL-3 file was completely replaced with a level scheme using
bandhead energies and spins from the model of Sood [56]. The

contributions of the transitions to ground-state and metastable
state are in agreement with the experimental data; however,
the absolute magnitudes of these contributions are rather high
and overestimate the experimental data. This overestimation
may also result from the incorrect description of the competing
second-chance fission and the (n,2n) channels. Further work
is required to resolve this issue, which is beyond the scope of
this paper.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The 237Np(n,f ) cross section was experimentally deter-
mined at the CERN n TOF facility, in the neutron energy range
100 keV to 9 MeV, using a fast ionization chamber. The cross-
sectional results were obtained relative to the 235U(n,f ) cross
section up to 2 MeV and to the 238U(n,f ) cross section above,
using data from the ENDF/B-VII.1 library. Both reference
reactions are considered as standards in the corresponding
energy range (the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation was used). The

present results extend over an important energy range where
some discrepancies were observed in previous data. They are
in good agreement with data from measurements [2] taken
with the same 237Np target, using monoenergetic neutron
beams at the N.C.S.R. “Demokritos” but with Micromegas
detectors. Finally, a theoretical investigation of the 237Np(n,f )
reaction cross section within the Hauser-Feshbach formalism
with the code EMPIRE was performed, in the energy range 100
keV to 20 MeV, by successfully reproducing simultaneously
the cross section of the 237Np(n,tot) reaction and the other
competing reaction channels in the corresponding energy
region.
