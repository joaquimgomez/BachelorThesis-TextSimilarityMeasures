Abstract
The accurate knowledge of neutron cross-sections of a variety of plutonium
isotopes and other minor actinides, such as neptunium, americium and curium,
is crucial for feasibility and performance studies of advanced nuclear sys-
tems (Generation-IV reactors, Accelerator Driven Systems). In this context,
the 240Pu(n,f) cross-section was measured with the time-of-flight technique at
the CERN n_TOF facility at incident neutron energies ranging from thermal
to several MeV. The present measurement is the first to have been performed
at n_TOF’s newly commissioned Experimental Area II (EAR-2), which is
located at the end of an 18 m neutron beam-line and features a neutron flu-
ence that is 25-30 times higher with respect to the existing 185 m flight-path
(EAR-1), as well as stronger suppression of sample-induced backgrounds,
due to the shorter times-of-flight involved. Preliminary results are presented.

1. Introduction
The accurate knowledge of neutron cross-sections of a variety of plutonium isotopes and other minor
actinides is crucial for feasibility and performance studies of advanced nuclear systems [1, 2]. Such
isotopes, that present a fission threshold at a few hundred keV, accumulate during the operation of a
conventional thermal reactor, but could be effectively transmuted in reactors with a fast neutron spec-
trum. Improved knowledge of the neutron-induced fission cross-sections of these isotopes is not only
important for the design of advanced systems, but also for the more efficient operation of existing reac-
tors, since safety margins can be more accurately defined. In particular, the non-fissile and long-lived
240Pu isotope contributes to the long-term residual activity of nuclear waste. It is included in the Nu-
clear Energy Agency (NEA) High Priority List [3] and the NEA WPEC Subgroup 26 Report on the
accuracy of nuclear data for advanced reactor design [4]. In this context, an experiment to measure the
240Pu(n,f) cross-section was executed at the CERN n_TOF (neutron time-of-flight) facility [5, 6, 7, 8].
Preliminary results are presented in this article.

2. Experimental setup
2.1 The n_TOF facility and Experimental Area II (EAR-2)
Neutrons at n_TOF are spallation products created by a bunched 20 GeV/c proton beam delivered by
CERN’s PS (Proton-Synchrotron) accelerator onto a lead target 40 cm in length and 60 cm in diameter.
A 1 cm-thick layer of circulating water surrounds the target in order to cool it down and also act as
a neutron moderator. Beyond the target and after an additional 4 cm-thick layer of (borated) water, a

Fig. 1: A view of the chamber housing the samples and detectors, and the associated electronics placed in the
neutron beam in EAR-2. The neutron beam arrives vertically from below and then continues in the vauum tube
above the chamber and onto the beam dump a few meters later. Approximately 15-20 cm of air are present before
and after the chamber.

∼185 m vacuum tube leads to the first measuring station (Experimental Area I, or EAR-1) which has
been in operation since 1999.

A new experimental area (Experimental Area II or EAR-2) [9, 10] was commissioned in the
second half of 2014. EAR-2 is located at the end of an 18 m neutron beam-line placed vertically above
the spallation target. The proximity to the target yields a gain in flux of 25-30 times compared to
the existing experimental area (EAR-1), while the neutrons are delivered in an approximately 10 times
shorter time interval. The very high instantaneous flux and extended energy range (from thermal to over
100 MeV) allow to cover the region of interest in a single experiment and mitigate the adverse effects
of the strong α-background produced by the samples and the low fission cross-section below and near
the fission threshold.

Both experimental areas meet the requirements to operate as Type A Work Sectors [11], meaning
unsealed radioactive samples can be handled.

2.2 Samples and detectors
Three plutonium oxide (PuO2) samples were used [12], for a total mass of approximately 2.3 mg of
240Pu (∼0.10 mg/cm2 per sample, 99.89% purity). The material was electro-deposited on an aluminium
backing 0.25 mm thick and 5 cm in diameter, while the deposit itself had a diameter of 3 cm. Addi-
tionally, a 235U sample with a mass of ∼0.6 mg and a 238U sample with a mass of ∼0.8 mg were used
as reference. All samples were manufactured at IRMM (Belgium). Contaminants present in the 240Pu
samples (most notably 239Pu) have a non-negligible contribution to the fission yield in certain energy
ranges (mainly below 1 keV) which was subtracted during the analysis.

The measurements were carried out with Micromegas (Micro-MEsh GAseous Structure) gas
detectors [13, 14, 15]. The gas volume of the Micromegas is separated into a charge collection region
(several mm, 5 mm in this case) and an amplification region (typically tens of µm, 50 µm in this case)
by a thin “micromesh” with 35 µm diameter holes on its surface. A chamber capable of holding up
to 10 sample-detector modules was used for the measurement. The detectors were operated with an

experimental area is shown in Figure 1.

The analogue detector signals were digitised with 8-bit flash-ADCs [16] with a 500 MHz sam-
pling rate. In order to minimise the volume of data to be transferred and recorded, a zero-suppression
algorithm was applied to avoid recording long sequences of noise where no useful signals are present.

3. The previous measurement in EAR-1

This measurement was originally attempted in EAR-1, in parallel with the measurement of the 242Pu
fission cross-section [17, 18]. Due to the lower neutron flux, it was necessary to measure over a period
of several months to collect the necessary statistics. An unexpected effect of the high α-activity of the
240Pu samples (>6 MBq per sample) was encountered in the course of the measurement [19], with a
steady degradation of the fission fragment amplitude distribution. After the end of the measurement,
a visual inspection of the detectors used with the 240Pu samples revealed a circular discolouration of
the mesh whose dimension and position exactly matched those of the samples. Upon closer inspection
with a microscope, it became clear that the micromesh had suffered serious damage, particularly around
the rims of the holes which were evidently deformed. This lead to a degradation of the electrical field
and therefore of the detector gain and overall performance. In time, this made the fission fragment and
α-particle signals virtually indistinguishable in the obtained pulse-height spectra. It should be noted
that, even when detectors were operating normally, the long α pile-up tail greatly reduced the quality
of the separation, as can be seen in Figure 2 (black).

4. Data analysis and results

The digitised raw data from each detector are analysed off-line by means of a pulse recognition routine
that determines the amplitude and position in time of the detected signals, as well as the signal baseline,
among other quantities. Throughout the measurement, beam-off data were taken in order to record

Fig. 3: Resonances observed in the measured fission yields from the three 240Pu samples, after subtraction of
contributions from contaminants. Several resonance clusters, attributable to the coupling between Class-I and
Class-II states, are visible, while resonances can be observed up to a few tens of keV. Data are shown with a
binning of 2000 bins per energy decade.

the α- and spontaneous fission background produced by the samples. The behaviour of the detectors
is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations performed with the FLUKA code [20, 2], focusing
particularly on the reproduction of the pulse height spectra of α-particles and fission fragments for the
evaluation of the detector efficiency and the correction associated to the signal amplitude threshold.

The interactions of the proton beam with the spallation target lead to a significant production of
prompt γ-rays and other relativistic particles that reach the experimental area at (nearly) the speed of
light and constitute what is commonly termed the “γ-flash”. This causes an initial signal lasting a few
hundred ns, followed by a baseline oscillation that lasts for several µs or, in terms of neutron energy,
down to less than 1 MeV. In order to remove this oscillation, an average shape is obtained from at least
several hundred signals and then subtracted from each raw data “movie” before processing the data.

In Figure 2, the pulse-height spectrum obtained from one of the 240Pu samples (red) is compared
to a spectrum recorded with the same sample during the measurement in EAR-1 (black). It can be
clearly observed that the increased neutron flux leads to a considerably higher number of recorded fis-
sion events and that there is a much stronger suppression of the sample-induced α-particle background,
resulting in a considerably clearer separation from the fission fragments.

Figure 3 shows the fission counts as a function of incident neutron energy recorded in all three
240Pu samples between 10 eV and 30 keV, after applying an appropriate signal amplitude threshold to
reject the background and subtracting the contribution of contaminants present in the sample. Several
resonance clusters can be observed and resonances are visible up to a few tens of keV. Above 100 keV,
data has been obtained up to at least several MeV, with statistical uncertainties below 2-3% and even
below 1% in the range between 0.5-5 MeV.

5. Summary
The measurement of the 240Pu fission cross-section is the first measurement to be performed at the newly
commissioned Experimental Area II of the CERN n_TOF facility. Data were collected from thermal
energies up to at least several MeV. Most notably, data showing clear resonant structures have been
obtained even in the sub-threshold region (up to a few tens of keV) where the cross-section is lowest
and where evaluations show a smooth behaviour of the cross-section. The success of this measurement
is largely due to the favourable characteristics of EAR-2, in particular the increased neutron flux and
stronger background suppression compared to EAR-1, where the measurement was not feasible. These
features will allow n_TOF to expand its measurement capabilities to even more short-lived and rare
isotopes, such as 230Th, 232U, 238,241Pu and 244Cm.
