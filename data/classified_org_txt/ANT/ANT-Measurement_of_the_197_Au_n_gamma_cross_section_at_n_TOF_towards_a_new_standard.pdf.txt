Abstract. Two different detectors and techniques are employed at n TOF facility, at CERN, to improve the accuracy
of the neutron capture cross section of 197Au(n,γ): a total absorption calorimeter and a set of C6D6. The accurate
knowledge of this cross section is of great importance for all the (n,γ) reactions study. The neutron capture cross
section and nuclear resonce parameters of the 197Au have been measured in the energy range of 1 eV to 1 kev. The
present work shows in average a good agreement with evaluated data libraries, although sizeable differences have
been observed for some resonances. Two new resonances have also been discovered. The accuracy of the resonance
partial widths has been improved and the main nuclear quantities such as the neutron strength function have been
extracted.

1 Introduction

The main objectives of the experimental activity of the neutron
time-of-flight facility, n TOF, at CERN, are the accurate mea-
surements of neutron capture cross sections related to nuclear
astrophysics [1,2] and the collection of nuclear data related

to emerging nuclear technologies for energy production and
nuclear waste transmutation [3,4]. The n TOF facility, based
on an idea by Rubbia et al. [5], became fully operational in
May 2002, when the scientific program started. A detailed de-
scription of its performances can be found elsewhere [6]. The
high instantaneous flux, the good energy resolution, and the
low background that characterize the n TOF neutron beam, as-
sociated with high-performance detectors and data acquisition

systems, allow to perform accurate measurement of isotopi-
cally enriched samples, including radioactive isotopes.

Neutron capture cross sections are usually derived after
normalization to a standard cross section that is accurately
known. To this end, the first resonance at 4.9 eV of the
n +197Au reaction can be utilized. In fact, the parameters
of this resonance are known with an accuracy of 3%. In
addition, the Au cross section is considered as a standard in
the energy range above 200 keV, and measurements of capture
cross sections rely on this information as well. High accuracy
measurements of the capture cross section for Au have been
performed at the n TOF facility, with the aim of extending
the energy range of the standard from 1 eV up to 10 keV, with
two different detection systems: a set of two C6D6 detectors
with extremely low neutron sensitivity, and a total absorption
calorimeter based on BaF2 scintillator crystals. In particular,
this latter device yields excellent discrimination of ambient
background and of competing reactions.

2 Experimental details

2.1 The n TOF facility

At n TOF, neutrons are generated via spallation by the
20 GeV/c protons from the CERN Proton Sinchrotron (PS)
accelerator complex impinging onto a massive target of natural
lead. The measuring station is located at 187.5 m from the
spallation target, inside the tunnel that houses the evacuated
neutron flight path. Because of the prolific neutron production
provided by spallation reactions and the very intense beam of
7 × 1012 protons/pulse, the instantaneous neutron flux at
n TOF is more than two order of magnitude higher than
at the other existing facilities. Background due to charged
particles and γ-rays originating from the spallation target is
efficiently reduced by several meters of concrete and iron
shieldings, a sweeping magnet, and a combination of two
collimators. For capture measurements with a 1.9 cm diameter
collimator beam spot, the instantaneous flux amounts to 105

neutrons/cm2/pulse for neutron energies between 0.1 eV and
20 GeV.

2.2 Capture setup

The neutron capture event is characterized by the deexcitation
of the compound nucleus by emission of a γ-ray cascade. To
detect the prompt capture γ-rays, at n TOF we utilised two
different techniques: the Pulse Height Weighting Technique
(PHWT) with two C6D6 liquid scintillation detectors [10]
and a total absorption calorimeter (TAC), a spherical 4π
detector. The first solution is preferable when the total cross
section is dominated by the elastic channel: the low neutron
sensitivity of C6D6 allows to carry out measurements even
when the ratio capture/scattering is extremely small. Instead
when fission is in competition with capture reaction, or when
the natural radioactivity of the sample is high, one needs to
record the full electromagnetic cascade (TAC measurement)
to distinguish the capture γ-rays from the background ones.
Since Au(n,γ) has been utilized, at n TOF, for cross sections
normalization, a large body of capture data for gold obtained
with the two independent technique have been collected. The

main characteristics of the capture study with the PHWT have
been published [11]. Here we concentrate on the TAC analysis.
The neutron capture detection system consists in a segmented
total absorption calorimeter made of 40 BaF2 scintillation
crystals. The TAC has nearly 100% detection efficiency for
electromagnetic cascade and a good energy resolution (15%
at 662 kev and 6% at 6.1 MeV) in the energy range of interest.
The Au sample (see table 1) is placed at the geometric center
of the TAC and surrounded by a C12H20O4(

6Li)2 neutron
absorber placed inside the inner space of the TAC. The neutron
absorber reduce the number of scattered neutrons reaching the
detector. The neutron flux is measured by a silicon monitor
(SiMon) [8] consisting of a thin 6Li deposit on a thin Mylar
foil surrounded by a set of four silicon detectors outside the
neutron beam for recording the tritons and α particles from
the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction. The Data Acquisition System (DAQ)
used in the measurements consists of 54 channels of high per-
formance flash ADCs [9]. Each channel has 8 Mbytes memory
operating at a sampling rate of 500 Msamples/s, thus allowing
to record the full detector history for neutron energy ranges
above 0.3 eV. After zero suppression and data formatting,
especially designed pulse shape analysis routines extract from
the digitized detector signals the necessary information for the
data analysis.

3 Data analysis

3.1 Determination of the capture yield

The capture yield Y(En), which is the fraction of the number
of neutrons Φ(En) with energy En incident on the sample and
producing a capture event, can be determined in a simple way
from the number of γ-cascades observed Nobs(En). Without
consideration of the background this is given by

Y(En) =
Nobs
�
· 1
Φ(En)

, (1)

where � is the TAC detection efficiency. It is independent of
the neutron energy and depends on the analysis conditions,
such as multiplicity (that is the number of BaF2 crystals hit
by a γ-ray) and cuts on energy deposition. The ratio between
the yield obtained at n TOF and that tabulated in literature,
for the first Au(n,γ) resonance, gives the normalization factor.
This ratio results to be the product of the detection efficiency
times the fraction of neutrons really impinging on the sample.
In figure 1 the energy deposition for Au(n,γ) measurement
is shown, the Au capture peak at 6.5 MeV and the various
components of the background can be identified. Indeed the
scattered neutrons can be stopped in the 10B-loaded carbon
fiber capsules surrounding the crystals, or they can be captured

by the Hydrogen present in the neutron absorber, giving rise
to the 480 keV and 2.2 MeV γ-ray respectively. Finally, they
can be captured inside by Ba inside the crystals, yielding a
9 MeV γ-cascade. Applying conditions on energy deposition
spectra (see fig. 1) and/or in multiplicity we have minimized
the background. This selection of the capture events lowers the
detection efficiency down to 60%. The resulting yield is shown
in figure 2.

3.2 Corrections

Although the data acquisition system used for this experi-
ment in principle introduces only a negligible dead-time, the
measurements indicated that a correction is needed to take
into account the dead-time introduced by the calorimetric
method. Indeed, in the analysis we are forced to set a time-
window to identify a capture event (all γ-rays detected in this
window are thought to belong to the same capture event). In
this time-window there exist a probability of detecting two
different capture events. Due to the constraints in the total
γ-ray energy and in the multiplicity of the events, it may
happen that events which are actually due to two or more
captures can be lost or seen as one event (with slightly different
ET AC and multiciplity). This sort of “detector dead-time” can

be corrected in the extraction of the yield by applying the
following relation [12]:

CRr =
Cr

1 −Cr × ∆t
(2)

where CRr is the real (true) counting rate, Cr is the regis-
tered counting rate and ∆t is the dead-time (in our case,
the coincidence window). A corresponding correction factor
for the measured count rate was obtained as a function of
TOF by means of the “paralyzable model” approximation,
which accounts for the software dead time of 20 ns [12].
This correction is lower than 5%, which is reached at the
top of the main resonances. Nevertheless, it affects the results
of the resonance analysis, because of the distortions of the
resonance shapes. Pile up may occur if signals are too close to
be correctly identified by the reconstructions routine. Indeed
the pulse shape algorithm may fail to find a signal in the
tail of another one, because of the high counting rate. In
this case Monte Carlo simulation are needed to estimate this
effect. Most of the pile up, however, concerns γ-rays of low
energy, below 200 keV, so that a minimization is obtained in
the present analysis conditions, that is multiplicity grater than
2 and 3.5 MeV < ET AC < 7.5 MeV. We have estimated that the
residual pile up effect is less than 1%. Neutrons scattered at
the sample can be captured by the TAC materials (mainly in
the Ba isotopes) and considerated as true capture events. Such
a background, also called neutron sensitivity of the detector,
for Au(n,γ) is of the order of 2% only for resonance with
particularly high Γn, and must be subtracted.

4 Results

In the Resolved Resonance Region (RRR) the capture cross
section of 197Au is expressed in terms of R-matrix resonance
parameters calculated in the Reich-Moore approximation with
the code SAMMY [13]. The fitting procedure consisted in
the extraction of the resonance parameters from the measured
capture yields. The fit to the resonances was performed in
different ways in order to check the reliability of the extracted
parameters. In general, the three resonance parameters, ER,
Γγ and Γn are left free to vary while the normalization factor,
extracted from the first resonance, see figure 3, is kept fixed.
The spin assignment of each level was taken from the ENDF-
VII [14] or JEFF-3.1 [15] libraries or Mughabghab [16]

evaluation. The parameters of 47 resonances (2 of them were
identified for the first time) were extracted in the energy
range between 1 and 720 eV. The parameters were used to
calculate the capture kernels for each resonance, defined as
G(J) · Γγ · Γn/(Γn + Γγ), where G(J) is the statistical spin
factor. TAC data were compared with those of C6D6, finding
a good agreement, see figure 4. Since it was verified that both
capture detection technique are consistent, the capture kernels
of TAC n TOF data were compared with those listed in ENDF-
VII and JEFF-3.1 libraries and the previous data compiled by
S.F. Mughabghab. Even though the capture kernel of some
resonances present discrepancies, the whole set of data is in
good agreement. Mainly, the discrepancies are present for
the weaker resonances, probably not well measured in past
measurements. An average difference of 1–2% was found, see
for example figure 5 (2% with respect to ENDF-VII; 1% with
respect to Mughabghab and −1% with respect to JEFF-3.1).

5 Discussion of uncertainties

The total uncertainty in the cross section consists of several
contribution. The main source comes from the determination
of the normalization constant, that is the product of the neutron
beam interception factor (fraction of the neutron impinging on
the sample) and the efficiency of the TAC. This constant is
determinated from the analysis of the first Au(n,γ) resonance,

which has an uncertainty of 3%. An uncertainty of 2% is
related to the shape of the neutron flux. Other contributions
come from background subtraction, dead-time and pile up
correction estimated around 1%. Adding up these components
the overall uncertaity is around 3%. A covariance propagation
for the present analysis procedure is still in progress.

6 Conclusions

The n TOF measurement is an important step forward towards
the extension of the Au(n,γ) reaction as a standard in different
energy regions, thanks to the high accuracy (due to low
background and low neutron sensitivity) and resolution. The
combined analysis of the BaF2 TAC and the C6D6 detectors
allowed to extract resonance parameter with an accuracy
lower than 5%. The preliminary Au(n,γ) analysis shows the
potentiality of the TAC. Although good agreement with ENDF
and/or JEFF is observed in average, discrepancies were found
for some resonances in the energy region 200 eV–1 kev. Two
new resonances were observed. The determination of reso-
nance parameters in now in progress and we expect to extend
this analysis up to 10 kev. A combined analysis with Au data
from other facilities would improve the overall accurary and
would provide a strong impulse to define a new standard cross
section of neutron capture on gold.
