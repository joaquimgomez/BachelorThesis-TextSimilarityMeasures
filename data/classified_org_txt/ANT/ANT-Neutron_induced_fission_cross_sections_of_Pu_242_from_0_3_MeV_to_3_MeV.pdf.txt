The majority of the next generation of nuclear power plants (GEN-IV) will work in the fast-neutron-energy
region, as opposed to present day thermal reactors. This leads to new and more accurate nuclear-data needs
for some minor actinides and structural materials. Following those upcoming demands, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency performed a sensitivity study. Based on the
latter, an improvement in accuracy from the present 20% to 5% is required for the 242Pu(n,f ) cross section. Within
the same project both the 240Pu(n,f ) cross section and the 242Pu(n,f ) cross section were measured at the Van
de Graaff accelerator of the Joint Research Centre at the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements,
where quasimonoenergetic neutrons were produced in an energy range from 0.3 MeV up to 3 MeV. A twin
Frisch-grid ionization chamber has been used in a back-to-back configuration as fission-fragment detector. The
242Pu(n,f ) cross section has been normalized to three different isotopes: 237Np(n,f ), 235U(n,f ), and 238U(n,f ).
A comprehensive study of the corrections applied to the data and the uncertainties associated is given. The
results obtained are in agreement with previous experimental data at the threshold region up to 0.8 MeV. The
resonance-like structure at 0.8 to 1.1 MeV, visible in the evaluations and in most previous experimental values,
was not reproduced with the same intensity in this experiment. For neutron energies higher than 1.1 MeV, the
results of this experiment are slightly lower than the Evaluated Nuclear Data File/B-VII.1 evaluation but in
agreement with the experiment of Tovesson et al. (2009) as well as Staples and Morley (1998). Finally, for
energies above 1.5 MeV, the results show consistency with the present evaluations.

I. INTRODUCTION

For the next generation of nuclear power plants (GEN-IV),
four of the six designs currently under study are based on
a fast neutron-energy spectrum instead of a thermal one.
Consequently, there are upcoming needs for the nuclear-data
community to meet more stringent requirements in order to
improve the accuracy on the performance of simulations codes
in this energy region. To address these aspects, a sensitivity
study was performed by the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) [1]
with the outcome of a list of high priorities of the most
important isotopes and their relevant quantities. Not only for
isotopes that eventually would be part of the fuel mixture, but
also for structural materials intended to surround the reactor
core. Within the high-priority list it is requested to improve the
accuracy of the neutron-induced fission cross section of 242Pu
from the current 20% to a target of 5%.

Several projects worldwide tackled this request with the
goal to provide new relevant data. Among them, the Accurate

Nuclear Data and Energy Sustainability Collaboration (AN-
DES) [2] aimed to address several data needs for the design
of fast reactors and to improve the current knowledge on
nuclear data, specifically in the fast-neutron-energy region.
The experiment that will be presented in this paper was part
of the ANDES collaboration and was performed together with
the measurement of the 240Pu(n,f ) cross section presented
elsewhere [3].

Most of the data sets available in the Experimental Nuclear
Reaction Data Library (EXFOR) [4] for the 242Pu(n,f )
cross section date from the 1970s and just two of them are
from the last decade. Figure 1 presents some of the most
relevant experiments in the neutron-energy range where this
experiment was focused together with the current evaluations
(for clearness not all data points are shown). The spread of the
data is very large mainly due to the values of Butler (1960) [5]
and Fomushkin and Gutnikova (1970) [6]. Besides that, above
1 MeV two groups of data sets can be distinguished. The
first one being the values of Weigmann et al. (1984) [7] and
the second a subset of the other data sets Bergen and Full-
wood (1970) [8], Auchampaugh et al. (1971) [9], Meadows
(1978) [10], Staples and Morley (1998) [11], and Tovesson
et al. (2009) [12]). Nevertheless, the two groups are converging
at neutron energies above 2.5 MeV. In addition, the spread
of the data around the resonance-like structure visible at 1 to
1.1 MeV is quite large; thus, its intensity is not well established.
The evaluations available are grouped in two: the Evaluated
Nuclear Data File (ENDF/B-VII.1) [13] and the Japanese
Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (JENDL 4.0) [14]; and the

FIG. 1. (Color online) Summary of the most relevant experi-
ments performed on the neutron-induced-fission cross section of
242Pu compared with current evaluations. The evaluations chosen
are ENDF/B-VII.1 [13], JEFF 3.1 [15], and JENDL 4.0 [14]. The
ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation follows perfectly the JENDL 4.0. The
experimental data sets shown are Butler (1960) [5] (open crosses),
Fomushkin and Gutnikova (1970) [6] (open stars), Bergen and Full-
wood (1970) [8] (open circles), Auchampaugh et al. (1971) [9] (open
diamonds), Meadows (1978) [10] (open up triangles), Weigmann
et al. (1984) [7] (full squares), Staples and Morley (1998) [11] (open
down triangles), and Tovesson et al. (2009) [12] (full circles). Selected
data are shown for visibility of the plot. Data found as a ratio of 235U
were normalized to the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation of this isotope.
Further explanation is given in the text.

Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion File (JEFF 3.1) [15].
Actually, theENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation follows exactly the
JENDL 4.0 evaluation, which used most of the data sets
presented. In contrast, the JEFF 3.1 evaluation follows the
experimental data of Weigmann et al. (1984). The uncertainties
presented in these data sets are often not explained in detail
and, most of the time, the total uncertainty does not include
the uncertainty of the reference cross section used.

To improve the knowledge of the 242Pu(n,f ) cross section
it was decided to use three different reference isotopes. As
primary standard 235U(n,f ), 238U(n,f ) as secondary standard,
and 237Np(n,f ). Additionally, 237Np(n,f ) and 238U(n,f ) were
benchmarked by using 235U(n,f ). An extended explanation is
given below.

II. EXPERIMENT SETUP

A. Van de Graaff accelerator

The neutrons were generated through (p,n) reactions at
the Van de Graaff accelerator (VdG) of the Joint Research
Centre at the Institute for Reference Materials and Measure-
ments (JRC-IRMM). A quasimonoenergetic neutron flux was
produced from neutron energies of 0.3 MeV up to 1.8 MeV
by using the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction; and from 1.6 MeV up
to 3.0 MeV by using the T(p,n)3He reaction. The neutron-
producing targets were water cooled by using a water-layer
thickness of 1 to 3 mm. The Monte Carlo code MCNP [16] was

chamber with two samples in a back-to-back configuration followed
by the digital electronics used for this experiment.

used in order to study the influence of the water cooling system
on the degradation of the neutron energy (discussed below).

B. Fission-fragment detector

The fission fragments (FFs) produced were detected by
using a twin Frisch-grid ionization chamber (TFGIC). A
detailed description of the detector used in the present
experiment is given in Ref. [3]. A schematic view of the setup
can be seen in Fig. 2, where the TFGIC is plotted together with
the associated electronic scheme. The cathode-grid distance
was chosen in order to fully stop the FFs before reaching the
grid. For cross-section experiments a common choice is to
place both samples in the cathode holder, the sample under
study and the reference sample, in a back-to-back geometry;
in this way, a measurement of the neutron flux in the exact
place, where the samples are, can be avoided.

C. Data acquisition

A 12 bit, 100 MHz waveform digitizer (WFD) was
employed to store the preamplifier raw signals of the charges
collected by the electrodes. The trigger of all the WFD cards
was made from the cathode preamplifier signal after treatment
with a timing filter amplifier (TFA) and a constant fraction
discriminator (CFD). To avoid triggering the whole system
with α-particle signals coming, especially, from the 242Pu
sample, an electronic threshold was set in the CFD. The storage
of the signals was done with a data-acquisition system (DAQ)
built in C++ using ROOT as framework [17,18] and which was
developed at JRC-IRMM.

D. Signal processing

The signals were analyzed offline via a digital signal
processing (DSP) code developed at JRC-IRMM. A baseline
correction and a CR-RC4 filter were applied to the signals
to obtain their pulse height (PH). The PH distributions were
corrected later for the grid inefficiency [19].

E. Sample description

An overview of the sample properties is given in Table I,
complementing the description given in Ref. [3]. As mentioned
in Ref. [3], all the samples were produced by the target-
preparation group at JRC-IRMM.

aThe sample mass corresponds just to the main isotope and not to the total mass of the chemical compound.
bThe sample activity of the 235U sample considers the contribution of the 234U and 235U isotopes.

By using fluorescence images, the homogeneity of the
samples produced via electrodeposition and via vacuum
deposition was evaluated. The vacuum-deposited samples,
specifically the 237Np, presented a uniform distribution of
α activity on their surfaces. The inhomogeneities visible
in the electrodeposited sample (i.e., 242Pu) were quantified
by a low-solid-angle α-particle-counting measurement. The
inhomogeneities in the outer layer of the 242Pu sample were
quantified to be 7.4% larger with respect to the inner one.

F. Shielding

Pictures of the experimental setup with and without shield-
ing were presented in Ref. [3]. The setup with the shielding
was employed only when the measurements were done relative
to 235U(n,f ). The main purpose of shielding the TFGIC with a
paraffin-B4C layer was to avoid neutrons, scattered in the target
hall, interacting with the 235U sample at a much lower energy
than the nominal beam energy. The impact of low-energy
neutrons must be minimized when measuring again a fissile
isotope standard, because of the much larger neutron-induced
cross section at those energies.

III. CROSS-SECTION MEASUREMENT

In the present case the ratios measured were 242Pu
(n,f )/237Np(n,f ), 242Pu(n,f )/238U(n,f ), and 242Pu(n,f )/
235U(n,f ). The ratio 242Pu(n,f )/238U(n,f ) was renormal-
ized by using the measured ratio 238U(n,f )/235U(n,f ), as
explained in Ref. [3].

The corrections applied to the measured data were loss
of fission events due to the electronic threshold; counts
due to spontaneous fission; self-absorption and geometrical
efficiency; neutron spectrum, sample inhomogeneity and solid
angle; corrections due to the excited state of the 7Li(p,n)7Be
reaction; and corrections due to the down-scattered neutrons.
In the following only corrections that are significantly different
compared to those discussed in Ref. [3] will be explained.

To start with, the spontaneous fission rate of the 242Pu was
about 0.5 fissions/s. Therefore, this decay will compete with
the neutron-induced fission over the whole neutron-energy

range considered here, but will be most important close to and
below the fission threshold (En < 0.8 MeV). Special attention
had been given to redetermine the spontaneous fission half-life
of this isotope, i.e., T1/2,SF = 6.74 × 1010 y (1.3%) [23].

The neutron background was studied by means of
MCNP [16] simulations for both setups. The main contribution
to the neutron-energy loss was due to the water cooling
system of the neutron-producing target. This energy loss meant
that at the sample deposits the neutron energy spectrum was
no longer quasimonoenergetic, but the range of energy was
broader. In the specific case of using the 235U reference
sample, an increase of the reference sample fission count
rate will be produced, because the 235U(n,f ) cross section
increases when the neutron energy decreases. Therefore, the
calculated (n,f ) cross section of the isotope of interest would
be underestimated. The correction factors were calculated
as the ratio of the flux at the neutron energy of interest
folded with the (n,f ) cross section of the sample isotope
considered [�(En)σ (En)] and the flux as a function of the
neutron energy impinging on the sample deposits folded with
the neutron-induced fission cross section of the isotope of
interest [

∑
i �(Ei)σ (Ei)]. In Fig. 3 the correction factors for

setup #1 (no shielding around the TFGIC) are presented.

A. Sources of uncertainty

All uncertainties related to this experiment are summarized
in Table II. The highest contribution comes from the sponta-
neous fission counts [23], the uncertainty on the 235U mass, the
geometrical efficiency uncertainty and, finally, the uncertainty
associated with the 237Np(n,f ) normalization.

B. Results

The absolute values measured for the three ratios
242Pu(n,f )/237Np(n,f ) (blue triangles), 242Pu(n,f )/238U
(n,f ) [red dots; renormalized by using 238U(n,f )/235U(n,f )],
and 242Pu(n,f )/235U(n,f ) (green stars) are plotted in Fig. 4.

First, the data taken relative to the 237Np(n,f ) cross section
(blue triangles) can reproduce the fission threshold below
0.7 MeV. From this energy onwards the difference with

theENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation increases to 10% at neutron
energies between 1.3 and 1.5 MeV. Our data cannot reproduce
the resonance-like structure around 1.1 MeV or, at least, it is
much less pronounced. Between 1.5 MeV and 1.8 MeV, our
data are around 5% to 6% lower than all evaluations.

Second, the 242Pu(n,f ) cross-section data obtained from the
ratio 242Pu(n,f )/238U(n,f ) after renormalizing them with a
ratio measurement of 238U(n,f )/235U(n,f ) and the 235U(n,f )
ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation (red dots) are lower than the present
evaluations for neutron energies below 2.5 MeV yet in
agreement with the values obtained relative to the 237Np(n,f ).
Above 2.5 MeV, our results agree with the evaluated data files.

Third, the green stars present the absolute 242Pu(n,f ) data
taken as a ratio with 235U(n,f ) by using two different neutron-
producing targets 7Li(p,n)7Be (0.3 MeV up to 1.8 MeV) and
T(p,n)3He (1.6 MeV up to 3.0 MeV). The results, when using
the LiF target, are in good agreement with the results obtained
by using the 237Np(n,f ) as reference. At 1.8 MeV, the neutron
energy common for measurements done with the LiF target

present evaluations around 1 MeV is 10%. At the plateau region, this
experiment is up to 5% lower than the evaluated data files in the case of
the measurements relative to 237Np(n,f ) and 238U(n,f ). When using
the 235U(n,f ) cross section for normalization and the TiT reaction,
the values obtained are the ones predicted by the evaluations.

FIG. 5. (Color online) Summary of the results of this experiment
(red stars) compared with the most relevant experiments performed
on the neutron-induced fission cross section of 242Pu and with
current evaluations. The evaluations chosen are ENDF/B-VII.1 [13],
JEFF 3.1 [15], and JENDL 4.0 [14]. The JENDL 4.0 evaluation
follows perfectly the ENDF/B-VII.1. The experimental data shown
are Bergen and Fullwood (1970) [8] (open circles), Auchampaugh
et al. (1971) [9] (open diamonds), Meadows (1978) [10] (open up
triangles), Weigmann et al. (1984) [7] (full squares), Staples and
Morley (1998) [11] (open down triangles), and Tovesson et al.
(2009) [12] (full circles). Selected data are shown for legibility of
the plot. Data found as a ratio to 235U(n,f ) were normalized to the
ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation of this isotope. Further explanation is given
in the text.

The uncertainty presented is the larger of the individual data
points used to calculate the weighted average. At the fission
threshold, the values of this experiment are in agreement
with previous experimental data sets available in EXFOR,
as well as with the current evaluations. From 0.8 MeV up
to 1.5 MeV, our results are systematically lower than the

evaluations; also, the resonance-like structure show a much
lower amplitude. Nevertheless, between 1.2 and 1.5 MeV, our
data is in agreement with the data of Tovesson et al. (2009) [12]
and Staples and Morley (1998) [11]. Above 1.5 MeV, the
weighted average converges with the present evaluations.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The neutron-induced fission cross section of 242Pu has been
measured in the neutron-energy range from 0.3 MeV up to
3 MeV, following the requests based on the High-Priority
Request List of the OECD-NEA. The neutrons were produced
via two proton-induced reactions; namely, 7Li(p,n)7Be and
T(p,n)3He, at the Van de Graaff accelerator at JRC-IRMM.
A twin Frisch-grid ionization chamber was used as fission
fragment detector. This experiment was performed together
with the experiment presented in Ref. [3]. The results obtained
for the 242Pu(n,f ) cross section are in agreement with
previous data sets at the fission threshold, without being
able to reproduce the resonance-like structure taken up in the
evaluated data files and some data sets at 1 to 1.1 MeV. This
result cannot be attributed to the finite width of our incident
neutron energy bins. Besides the 1 to 1.1 MeV region, at
the plateau region this experiment converges with the values
obtained by Tovesson et al. (2009) and Staples and Morley
(1998) and, at neutron energies above 1.5 MeV with the
evaluations. The uncertainty budget reached is mainly due
to the mass uncertainty of the samples used, the efficiency
calculation, and the normalization with the reference cross
sections. Yet, the uncertainty associated with each individual
data point is always smaller than 5%.
