Abstract
The integral cross section of the 12C(n, p)12B reaction was measured at the
neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN, from the reaction threshold at
13.6 MeV up to 10 GeV, by means of the combined activation and a time-of-
flight technique. The integral result is expressed as the number of 12B nuclei
produced per single pulse of the neutron beam. A simple integral expression
is given for calculating the number of produced 12B nuclei from any given
evaluated cross section and/or model prediction.

1. Introduction

Nuclear medicine, radiological protection, the design of the structural materials at neutron production
facilities and the design of detectors used for fundamental nuclear physics experiments are some of
the fields where data on the neutron induced 12C(n, p)12B reaction play an important role. In nuclear
medicine – in particular in hadrontherapy – and in radiological protection this reaction must be taken
into account when estimating the dose received by biological tissues, which is built up both by pro-
tons, as the primary reaction products, and by the highly energetic electrons from a subsequent β -decay
of 12B (Q = 13.37 MeV). At neutron production facilities where the neutron flux extends above the
reaction threshold of 13.6 MeV, the emission of protons from the 12C(n, p)12B reaction leads to the
production of hydrogen within the steel alloys, increasing the risk of embrittlement. In fundamental
nuclear physics experiments carbon is often used both as the detector housing material and as the main
chemical constituent of the active material, e.g. C6D6 (historically, C6F6 detectors) due to its extremely
low neutron capture cross section providing a very low intrinsic sensitivity to scattered neutrons. How-
ever, in the presence of high energy neutrons, the 12C(n, p)12B reaction may give rise to an additional
component in the neutron background and even compromise the experimental estimation of the neutron
background by means of neutron irradiation of the carbon sample [1].

Despite these considerations, the experimental data on the 12C(n, p)12B reaction are very scarce
and largely discrepant from each other [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], as clearly shown in Fig. 1. This lack of data is
also reflected in the inability of the different models to consistently predict the cross section, and thus the
12B production rate of this reaction. For illustration, Fig. 1 also shows the cross sections extracted from
several different models available in GEANT4 [8] – the HP (High Precision) package, Binary cascade,
Bertini cascade, INCL++/ABLA model (INCL intranuclear cascade coupled to the ABLA deexcitation
model) and QGS (Quark-Gluon-String) model [9]. It should be noted that HP package adopts the cross
section directly from the ENDF/B-VII.1 database [10], while the other cross sections are the results of
the model calculations.

The integral cross section of the 12C(n, p)12B reaction was measured at the neutron time of flight
facility n_TOF at CERN, from the reaction threshold at 13.6 MeV up to 10 GeV. Although this integral
value cannot be directly compared to past experimental data – all energy dependent and limited to a

and/or model calculations.

2. Experimetnal setup

At the n_TOF facility the neutron beam is produced by exposing the massive Pb spallation target to a
pulsed proton beam from the CERN Proton Synchrotron. The proton beam is characterized by an energy
of 20 GeV, an average of 7×1012 protons per pulse, 7 ns width, minimal repetition period of 1.2 s and
a typical frequency of 0.4 Hz. The neutron beam (with ∼300 neutrons produced per single proton) is
moderated passing through the spallation target, through 1 cm of demineralized water from a cooling
system and additional 4 cm of borated water. After moderation, the neutron flux spans an energy
range from thermal (∼10 meV) up to 10 GeV. Passing through an evacuated beam line towards the
Experimental Area 1 at 185 m distance from the spallation target, charged particles are removed from
the beam by a 1.5 T sweeping magnet and is shaped by two collimators. A more detailed description
of the n_TOF facility may be found in Ref. [11]. We refer the reader to Ref. [12] for an in-depth
description of the neutron flux measurements at n_TOF.

The integral cross section measurement of the 12C(n, p)12B reaction was performed using a nat-
ural carbon sample of 7.13 g mass, 2 cm diameter, 1 cm thickness and a chemical purity of 99.95%,
which was confirmed at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The experiment relies on the detection of β -rays,
with an average energy of 6.35 MeV, from the decay of 12B produced by the 12C(n, p)12B reaction. Two
deuterated benzene (C6D6) liquid scintillation detectors were used for the detection of these β -rays.
One is the modified version of the Bicron detector, while the other one (denoted as FZK) is a cus-
tom built detector from Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany. These detectors, commonly used at
n_TOF for neutron capture measurements, have been optimized with the specific purpose of achieving
a very low sensitivity to scattered neutrons [13]. Further details on the methodology of the experiment
may be found in Refs. [14, 15].

The 12B half-life of 20.2 ms is highly beneficial to the experiment, since the data acquisition
window of 96 ms is sufficient to cover a significant portion of the 12B exponential decay distribution.
A description of a high-performance digital data acquisition system at n_TOF – based on 8-bit flash
analog-to-digital converter units (FADC) with 48 MB memory buffer, operating at a typical sampling
rate of 500 MHz – may be found in Ref. [16].

3. Data analysis

There are several sources of background affecting the measurement, all of which have been clearly iden-
tified. The first background component, related to the scattering of in-beam γ-rays off the natC sample,
was measured with a Pb sample and was found completely negligible. The background caused by the
neutron beam crossing the experimental area was measured by irradiating the overall experimental setup
without the sample in place. The ambient background, caused by the natural and induced radioactivity,
was measured by turning off the neutron beam. All experimentally accessible background components
were properly normalized and subtracted from the measurements with the natC sample.

Finally, the neutron background, which is caused by neutron scattering off the sample, has been
determined by means of recently developed high-precision GEANT4 simulations [1]. The simulated
results have been found to be highly reliable, based on the comparison with experimental data obtained
with a natC sample. However, it was shown in Ref. [1] that the simulated neutron background which
is composed mostly of the capture γ-rays, can be reliably described only by applying the Pulse Height
Weighting Technique (PHWT) [17]. This procedure is commonly used in the analysis of neutron cap-
ture data obtained by detectors with a low γ-ray detection efficiency (the details on the PHWT applied
at n_TOF may be found in Ref. [18]). In short, the lack of proper correlations between the simulated
capture γ-rays modifies their energy distribution (relative to the experimental one), thus affecting the
average detection efficiency for capture events. Applying the PHWT removes the effect of these corre-
lations, the only condition being that the energy conservation is respected in the generation of capture
γ-rays.

The PHWT is performed by assigning to each detected count a weighting factor W (E), dependent
on the energy E deposited in the detector. The weighting of the experimental counts Cexp(t), expressed
as a function of the decay time t, may be decomposed as:

W (E)⊗Cexp(t) =W (E)⊗Cγ(t)+ 〈W 〉×Cβ (t) (1)

The application of the weighting factors is symbolically denoted by⊗. Cγ(t) is the neutron background,
mostly composed of the capture γ-rays from the experimental area. Cβ (t) is the time distribution of
detected β -rays from a decay of 12B. Owing to the fact that there are no correlations between β -rays,
the application of the PHWT to the corresponding spectrum Cβ (t) is reduced to a simple multiplication
by the average weighting factor 〈W 〉:

〈W 〉=
∫ 13.37 MeV

200 keV Sβ (E)W (E)dE∫ 13.37 MeV
200 keV Sβ (E)dE

(2)

which is directly determined by the energy spectrum Sβ (E) of the detected β -rays. The lower inte-
gration bound from Eq. (2) is equal to the threshold set during the data analysis. The upper bound is
given by the Q-value of the 12B decay. The energy spectrum Sβ (E), which is easily determined from
simulations, allows to invert Eq. (1) and to obtain the unweighted experimental spectrum of detected
β -rays:

Cβ (t) =
W (E)⊗Cexp(t)−W (E)⊗Cγ(t)

〈W 〉 (3)

The remaining spectrum corresponds to the time distribution of the 12B decay:

Cβ (t) =
εβ N12B

with τ = 29.14 ms as the lifetime of 12B and εβ as the total detection efficiency of C6D6 detectors, de-

termined from the simulations (4.3% for Bicron, 6.8% for FZK). The spectra before and after the back-
ground subtraction, obtained by combining the data from both detectors, are shown in Fig. 2. The num-
ber N12B of

12B nuclei produced per single neutron bunch was found by fitting (up to 80 ms) the spec-
trum Cβ (t) to the exponential from Eq. (4), with N12B as the only free parameter. The combination of the

highly consistent results from the two detectors – N(Bicron)12B = 68.03±0.66 and N
(FZK)
12B = 68.74±0.44 –

yields the final value of N12B = 68.5±0.4stat±4.8syst. A systematic uncertainty of 2% was assigned to
the contribution of β -rays produced outside the natC sample. An additional 3% uncertainty was intro-
duced due to the highly uncertain (n, p), (n,d) and (n,np) reactions on 13C present in natural carbon,
leading to the production of both 12B and 13B, with the decay properties of 13B being very similar to
those of 12B.

4. Integral cross section

The number of 12B nuclei produced per neutron bunch may be brought into connection with the under-
lying cross section σ(En) of the 12C(n, p)12B reaction:

N12B =
∫ 10 GeV

13.6 MeV

1− e−nσtot(En)
σtot(En)

η(En)φ(En)σ(En)dEn (5)

where the lower integration limit corresponds to the reaction threshold, while the upper one corresponds
to the maximal energy of the n_TOF neutron beam. The first term represents the self-shielding factor,
determined by the areal density n of the natC sample (n = 0.114 atoms/barn) and the total cross section
σtot(En), available from various evaluated libraries, such as ENDF/B-VII.1 [10]. Multiplied by σ(En),
it determines the first chance yield of the 12C(n, p)12B reaction, not taking into account the multiple
scattering effect. This is accounted for separately, by the factor η(En). The energy dependence of the
multiple scattering factor throughout the entire energy range from the reaction threshold up to 10 GeV
was obtained by simulating the neutron irradiation of the natC sample, using different GEANT4 models
for the 12B production. It is to be noted that the elastic cross section is independent of the inelas-
tic scattering models. Starting from widely different cross sections for the 12C(n, p)12B reaction (see

value (full line with the associated uncertainty range).

Fig. 1), all models yield very consistent multiple scattering corrections, confirming the reliability of the
result. Finally, the neutron flux φ(En) from Eq. (5) was measured up to 1 GeV by the Parallel Plate
Avalanche Counters (PPAC [19]), relying on the 235U(n, f ) reaction. Further details on the neutron flux
measurements at n_TOF may be found in Ref. [12]. The neutron flux evaluation was extended above
1 GeV, based on the results from the dedicated GEANT4 simulations, normalized to the experimental
data below 1 GeV. The overall energy dependent term multiplying the cross section σ(En) from Eq. (5)
may be treated as a unique weighting function w(En), which was fitted to the fifth degree polynomial:

with E0 = 1 MeV and w0 = 1 MeV−1 mb−1. The fit yields the following parameters: a0 = 12.9676,
a1 = −33.9199, a2 = 32.3332, a3 = −15.0657, a4 = 3.36573 and a5 = −0.291966. The weighting
function has been assigned 8% systematic uncertainty, coming from the uncertainties in each of its
components – the neutron flux, self shielding and the multiple scattering factor.

With the weighting function w(En)
uniquely identified, any pointwise cross section for the 12C(n, p)12B reaction that extends over the full
energy range from the reaction threshold up to 10 GeV, may be used to calculate the associated number
of the 12B nuclei produced per single neutron pulse of the n_TOF beam. In this way any cross section
calculation or evaluation may be benchmarked against the experimental n_TOF result. This has been
done for the different GEANT4 models, adopting the cross sections from Fig. 1. The results are shown
in Fig. 3. Alongside results from all models extending all the way up to 10 GeV, the result from a
combined Binary and Bertini cascade is also shown. The combination of Binary cascade up to 30 MeV
and Bertini cascade above 30 MeV maximizes the cross section for 12C(n, p)12B reaction, yielding the
integral result closest to the experimental one.

may also be estimated. The conversion factor κ between the number of produced 12B nuclei (the true
observable) and the convenient quantity I12B was determined to be κ = 1.85± 0.1 mb−1, yielding the
value I12B = 37±3 mb.

5. Conclusions
The integral cross section of the 12C(n, p)12B reaction was measured at the neutron time of flight fa-
cility n_TOF at CERN. A high-purity natC sample was exposed to an intense, white, pulsed neutron
beam, covering the energy range from below the reaction threshold at 13.6 MeV, up to 10 GeV. The
measurement was performed by detecting the β -rays from the decay of the produced 12B nuclei. Two
liquid scintillation C6D6 detectors were used, which are commonly employed at n_TOF for the neu-
tron capture measurements, due to their very low intrinsic sensitivity to the scattered neutrons. All
sources of background were clearly identified – either by the dedicated measurements or simulations –
and subtracted from the measurements with a high-purity natC sample. The remaining time distribution
of β -decays was fitted to an exponential form with the lifetime of 12B, thus obtaining the number of
12B nuclei produced per neutron pulse: N12B = 68.5±0.4stat±4.8syst. This observable was related to
the cross section of the 12C(n, p)12B reaction, by means of a properly determined weighting function,
which has been used to calculate the expected number of 12B nuclei produced per single pulse of the
n_TOF beam.
