We have developed a new coastal database for the Mediterranean basin that is intended for coastal impact
and adaptation assessment to sea-level rise and associated hazards on a regional scale. The data structure
of the database relies on a linear representation of the coast with associated spatial assessment units.
Using information on coastal morphology, human settlements and administrative boundaries, we have
divided the Mediterranean coast into 13 900 coastal assessment units. To these units we have spatially
attributed 160 parameters on the characteristics of the natural and socio-economic subsystems, such as
extreme sea levels, vertical land movement and number of people exposed to sea-level rise and extreme
sea levels. The database contains information on current conditions and on plausible future changes that
are essential drivers for future impacts, such as sea-level rise rates and socio-economic development.
Besides its intended use in risk and impact assessment, we anticipate that the Mediterranean Coastal
Database (MCD) constitutes a useful source of information for a wide range of coastal applications.

Background & Summary
The Mediterranean basin is characterized by a squeezed coastal area with a high concentration of people
and assets and by rapid demographic, social, economic as well as environmental change1,2. Between 1960
and 2010, the population of the Mediterranean has doubled from 240 million to 480 million3 and the
urban population has increased by 20% (ref. 2). This human pressure is further amplified by international
tourism. Around one third of the global tourist arrivals in 2011 have been registered in Mediterranean
countries, predominantly along the coast. The number of arrivals is expected to increase further, and
could reach 637 million per year by 2025 (ref. 3). The Mediterranean coastal zone is not only increasingly
under pressure from local human activities, but also subject to future global environmental change. In
particular, sea-level rise and associated hazards4 are expected to have significant impacts in
Mediterranean nations during the 21st century5–7.

To address these pressures and to underpin future coastal management and adaptation policies, such
as those included in the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Protocol of the Barcelona
Convention8, policy makers and coastal administrations in Mediterranean nations require impact and
vulnerability assessments. Such integrated assessments are cross-sectorial studies that require information
from various fields and disciplines. A prerequisite for coastal impact assessment and for the planning of
appropriate future interventions is the availability of consistent information on the physical, ecological
and socio-economic characteristics of the Mediterranean coastal zone. Despite an increasing demand of
decision-makers, planners and coastal researchers from various disciplines for such consistent scientific
data9,10 there is currently no source of readily available information for the 22 countries that surround the
Mediterranean basin. Due to the lack of such data only a limited number of studies exist that have
analyzed the impacts of sea-level rise for the entire region10,11. Collecting and organising such data is a
challenging task as consistent information on socio-economic and physical characteristics, both on
current conditions as well as on future developments, of the coast is needed.

The developed MCD aims to meet these needs through the provision of an open access spatial
database, that provides consistent information (in terms of format, resolution, quality, accuracy) for the
entire region and that is based on a lean data model. The coastal database contains 160 parameters that
characterize the natural and socio-economic systems of the Mediterranean coast. It relies on the structure
that was originally designed for the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) modeling
framework12–14, following the concepts described in reference15 and reference16 However, we have
downscaled and extended these approaches by introducing spatial coastal assessment units that capture
the spatial structure of population, assets and land exposed to coastal hazards. Further we have enhanced
the transparency of the process of attribution of spatial data to the segments and coastal assessment units
in order to make the database more user friendly. The developed coastal database is intended for use in
regional scale analyses and provides a robust basis for all types of comparative coastal studies to future
change as it allows results to be comparable across the entire region.

In this data descriptor we describe the generation of coastal segments and associated spatial coastal
assessment units; the methods that we have used to attribute around 160 different parameters on current
and future conditions in various formats to the coastal units; and the development of consistent data for
the Mediterranean coasts.

Methods
Coastal data model
Finding a data model to represent coastal space for vulnerability, impact and adaptation assessment is not
a straightforward task as coasts are highly dynamic and complex in terms of process interactions17. This
introduces challenges when trying to depict this system into a format that allows spatial information to be
stored into a database. A linear representation of the coastal zone has often been used in coastal studies
due to the common perception of the coast as a linear boundary between the sea and the land18. The
main advantage of a linear data model is its computational efficiency, which is essential for being able to
conduct the large number of model runs needed in impact and adaptation assessments as a result of the
large number of plausible sea-level rise, socio-economic or adaptation scenarios available. However, there
is no direct way to attribute spatial data, such as the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal
zone or landuse covering the coastal space, to a linear feature without losing spatial information.
Therefore, a main disadvantage of a linear data model is that the explicit spatial structure of the system is
lost19. The alternative data model frequently applied in order to preserve coastal spatial information is a
grid. The disadvantage of this model is, however, that data volumes are large and computationally
expensive for use in impact and adaptation assessments at broader geographic scales.

To address this challenge, we have created a data structure that combines the linear representation of
the coast with spatial coastal assessment units that extend inland (Figure 1). Thus, we combined the
advantages of a linear data model with a spatial representation of the coastal zone. To create such a data
model, the first step was to divide the coast into homogenous segments in terms of impacts, vulnerability
and adaptation to sea-level rise. For each segment, we then created a set of spatial coastal assessment units
according to administrative boundaries and extent of land up to 20 m of elevation above mean sea level.
Our aim was to generate assessment units that will respond uniformly to sea-level rise and can be treated
as single units for the purpose of adaptation planning in the future. In the following section, we describe

the data model and present the computational data processing that was undertaken for populating the
database.

Coastal segments
Following the concept of reference15 and reference20, we generated coastal segments of variable length,
each segment representing parts of the coast with a uniform vulnerability to sea-level rise at a regional
scale. As differences in vulnerability to sea-level rise are driven by variations in both socio-economic as
well as geomorphic/physical characteristics of the coastal zone16, we used four parameters covering both
these domains in the segmentation decision. Every time one of the four parameters changed in value, a
new segment was started (Figure 2).

We employed the coastline of the Global Administrative Areas21 database level 01 as the base layer for
the segmentation for the Mediterranean countries (Figure 2) and corrected artefacts related to the format
(e.g., “pixelization” of coastline) using a smoothing algorithm (polynomial approximation) and a
tolerance of 100 meters.

The first social system parameter included in the segmentation were (1) administrative boundaries.
This parameter was included, because society’s capacity to respond to sea-level rise differs across
jurisdictions. In this study, we used the GADM level 02 dataset (see Table 1).

The second social system parameter we used in the segmentation was the (2) distribution of assets and
people distinguishing the coast into two classes, (a) urban and (b) rural. This parameter is relevant for the
segmentation, because population and asset density influence vulnerability by both determining the

exposure to sea-level rise and storm surges, as well as by influencing society’s’ capacity to adapt13. We
classified the coast using satellite imagery and photos from Google Earth and the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global map of urban extent dataset with a spatial resolution
of 500 m22. Classification decisions were based on visual interpretation of Google imagery and on the
MODIS data, where urban areas are defined as places with predominantly built environment. That
includes all non-vegetative, human-constructed elements, such as buildings, roads, runways and are
greater than 1km2 (ref. 22). All pixels with a coverage greater than or equal to 50% built environment
according to the MODIS dataset22 were classified as urban. As we were particularly interested in all
human settlements that are lying directly on the coast, we refined the classification using Google Earth in
order to also include smaller human settlements. Therefore, settlements with a maximum distance of 300
m to the shoreline and a minimum extent of 300 m x 300 m, predominantly covered by residential
buildings, were defined as urban. Harbours were excluded from the urban classification, as they will
require specific adaptation measures in the future.

The first geomorphological parameter we considered in the segmentation was the (3) coastal material.
The material of the coast has a significant impact on the large-scale response to sea-level rise16. One of the
major impacts of sea-level rise is long-term erosion and land loss due to permanent inundation12. For
instance, sandy beaches will respond differently than rocky coasts to a rising sea level. We created a typology
of four different geomorphic classes that respond differently to rising sea level and will require different
adaptation measures. For the Mediterranean, no such dataset on coastal morphology and geological
characteristics was available at that time. Four different classes, namely (a) sand, (b) unerodible, (c) mud
and (d) rock with pocket beaches have been classified based on visual interpretation of Google Earth
imagery and location-tagged photographs from the web-service Panoramio which offers geographically
tagged photographs from users23. A similar method has been used in reference20 and reference23.

The second geomorphological parameter that we included in the segmentation process is (4) river
mouths. This parameter was included because deltas and estuaries are among the most vulnerable coastal
geomorphic features to sea-level rise24. We classified 47 river mouths for the Mediterranean region based
on Google Earth imagery.

Finally, those layers with the four different parameters were combined to create the coastline
segmentation for the Mediterranean. Overall, there are 11,975 segments with an average length of 4.5 km.

Spatial assessment units
The spatial assessment units expanding inland were created by generating inland buffer zones for every
coastline segment and overlaying them with elevation data and the administrative boundaries (resolution: 3
arc second). We only account for the low-lying part of the coastal zone that is hydrologically connected to
the sea and lies above 20m from mean sea level. The low-lying part of the coast is particularly at risk due to
higher extreme sea levels in the future25,26. We decided to extend the LECZ (Low Elevation Coastal
Zone=Area below 10m27–29) up to 20m in order to account for all plausible scenarios of changes in mean
sea level and associated hazards, including high-end scenarios, as well as to allow exploring different
adaptation strategies such as coastal retreat. Every coastal assessment unit was linked to a coastal segment
with a unique identifier code. The coastal segment unique identifier code consists of eight digits. The first
three represent the administrative unit and the last five digits represent the coastline segment (Figure 1).
The generated coastal data model forms the basis for the subsequent compilation of the database.

Extreme sea levels and waves
The MCD includes two extreme sea level datasets. The first dataset included is derived from the Global
Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR) dataset. GTSR is the first near-coast global reanalysis of storm surges
and is based on global hydrodynamic modelling combined with meteorological forcing from ERA-
Interim (1979–2014). A Gumbel extreme value distribution was fitted to the annual maximum to derive
extreme sea levels for various return periods. GTSR generally provides extreme sea levels for the centroids
of the coastal segments of the global database used in the DIVA model. However, for the MCD we
increased the spatial resolution and saved the outputs for the 11 975 centroids of the Mediterranean
coastline segments (GTSR-MED). The general methodology is described in detail in reference30.

The second dataset that we included in the MCD is the DINAS-COAST Extreme Sea Levels (DCESL).
This dataset has been the first global extreme water level dataset and was developed with the use of a
simple empirical model described in detail in refs 31,32.

Besides the data on extreme sea levels, we have also included information on mean wave heights for
the period 1971–2000 for the Mediterranean basin. The wave data have been computed using the wave
model WAM33 at a resolution of 0.25 degrees, resolving the spectrum using 12 directions and 25
frequencies. The wind meteorological forcing was generated using the hourly meteorological fields
produced by the regional climate model COSMO-CLM at a resolution of 0.12 degrees. The model
framework has been validated by reference34 and reference35. These mean wave heights should be
considered representative of offshore conditions, before depth induced wave breaking and interaction
with the bottom in the near shore zone occur.

SCIENTIFIC DATA | 5:180044 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2018.44 5



Computational data processing
The database was developed with the use of ArcPy, which is a site-package that builds on the ArcGIS
scripting module. It enables users to perform geographic spatial data analysis, data conversion and data
management with the programming language Python. One main advantage is that every Python script
constitutes a precise documentation of the computational data processing that was conducted. The input
spatial data were available in various formats depending on the information that they represented. Therefore,
we used different methods to attribute the data to the coastline segments and spatial assessment units.

Data processing differed according to two characteristics of the input data, namely: (1) whether the
data were originally in vector or raster format; and (2) whether we attributed them to the coastline
segment or to the assessment units (e.g. data representing information that extends several kilometres
inland). For instance, the extreme sea level data were available in a vector (point) format representing
extreme sea levels for different return periods directly at the coast. We spatially joined the nearest
extreme sea level data point to the centroid of every segment in order to have a common attribution
approach. Every coastal assessment unit obtained the extreme sea level information of the corresponding
coastline segment (Figure 1). Another example for the attribution of raster data to the coastal assessment
units is the information about the distribution of people in the coastal zone. For this purpose, a gridded
population dataset was combined with gridded elevation data in order to calculate the number of people
below a certain elevation (in 1 m increments, up to 20 m). Then we calculated the zonal statistics for every
coastal assessment unit in order to get the number of people per elevation increment. A detailed
documentation for every step employed for attributing the different parameters to the coastal units can be
found in the Python scripts (Table 1 and Table 2).

The database consists of various parameters about current conditions of the coastal zone. In addition,
the database provides information on plausible future changes that will drive future impacts, such as sea-
level rise or socio-economic development scenarios. Table 1 and Table 2 summarizes all parameters that
are included in the database; their source; a short description and the name of the python code where the
detailed computational data processing steps are documented. With the exception for the extreme sea
level datasets and the wave data, we only used datasets that are publically available.

Code availability
The python code to populate the Mediterranean coastal database is available to download in the figshare
repository (Data Citation 1). The code consists of ArcPy commands, which can be used if an ArcGIS for
Desktop license is installed. Each script is internally documented with explanation of the different data
processing steps. The internal documentation of the scripts should be used in combination with this
manuscript.

Data Records
The developed Mediterranean coastal database described in this article is publicly and freely available
through the figshare repository. We have included csv files with all the information on a segment (MCD –
coastal segment level) and assessment unit level (MCD – coastal assessment unit level) into the
repository. Furthermore, we provide the coastal segments and administrative boundaries in a shapefile
format as well as the coastal assessment unit in a tiff format in the repository. The database will be
updated and expanded as new and improved data become available.

Technical Validation
The database presented here has been created using a number of publically available datasets, which are
thoroughly documented and described in reports or scientific articles (Table 1 and Table 2). Thus, these
datasets have undergone rigorous quality controls and/or validation. In addition, for those parameters
where consistent information for the entire basin did not exist, new datasets were generated. Technical
validation therefore has focused on the evaluation of these new datasets (i.e. the coastal material, GTSR-
MED extreme sea levels); and on the correct attribution of data to the assessment units.

Geomorphological classification
The geomorphological classification dataset was compared to the recently compiled geomorphological
dataset of the Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation (MEDSEA, 2017) which was developed
independently, using a similar methodological approach. Further validation for some of the
Mediterranean countries, where this was possible, was undertaken based on expert judgement and on
national digital datasets of coastal morphology.

Comparing different coastal classification datasets can be a challenging task as the number and type of
classes used can differ substantially, depending on factors such as scale or user requirements36,p.267. The
MEDSEA data included similar classes to our dataset, namely: (1) sandy beach and beach with uncertain
grain size; (2) river, deltas; estuaries and soft sedimentary strands; (3) artificial structures and artificial
frontage; (4) soft rock shores; and (5) hard rock shores (see Table 3). 23% of the coast were classified as
sandy in both datasets. The MCD class ‘unerodible’ includes rocky coasts and artificial structures. When
comparing the MCD class (2) and the MEDSEA classes (3) and (5), the datasets show good agreement,
accounting for 46 (MCD) and 40 (MEDSEA) percent of the total coastline. The remaining classes (“rocky
with pocket beaches” and “soft rock shores” from MCD and MEDSEA respectively) are not directly
comparable. Overall, the two datasets are in agreement for around 70 percent of the Mediterranean coast.
The spatial patterns of coastal types are similar in the southern and eastern Mediterranean basin. In the
north western part of the basin differences in the classification are visible as the MEDSEA dataset
indicates a higher extent of hard and soft rock shores. However, this difference is primarily due to the
difference in the definition of the classes for the two classification schemes.

Local experts from Spain, Greece and Croatia undertook additional checks, based on visual inspections
and on national or local datasets. For Spain, there was agreement for 75% of the coast. For the remaining
25%, we implemented changes based on the expert suggestions and additional checks with Google Earth.

For Croatia, we compared our dataset to a national spatial dataset on the distribution of sandy beaches
provided by the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection and found that all sandy beaches were
included. Further qualitative tests based on expert judgement and visual assessment were carried out for
Greece for approximately 100 randomly selected segments, indicating an agreement for approximately
85% of the inspected segments. Accordingly, discrepancies were checked and corrected based on Google
Earth and expert suggestions. Finally, further comparisons were carried out for the districts of Lazio and
Emilia-Romagna with available classifications used in previous analyses20.

It must be noted that despite the extensive evaluation of the geomorphological classification and the
agreement with all employed data sources, some errors may still exist. These errors can result from
numerous factors, such as differences in the quality of Google Earth imagery for the entire region;
differences in scale; errors in the location of Panoramio photographs; coverage of location-tagged
photographs varying considerably between the Northern and Southern part of the basin; errors in
classification; or differences due to subjectivity in class definition. Nevertheless, the dataset will continue
to be updated as new data become available. We are currently exploring options for extending the
validation using crowd sourced data from the project Coastwards (http://coastwards.org/) in order
improve our current classification.

Extreme sea level datasets
Here we compare the two datasets of extreme sea levels against observations. First, we evaluate GTSR-
MED and DCESL which include tides and surges.

Figure 3a shows a comparison of the modelled and observed extreme sea level with a 10-year return
period for the GTSR dataset. Extreme sea levels are generally in the range of 0.15 m and 1.24 m. Off the
coast of Tunis, the Strait of Gibraltar, and near Venice extreme sea levels are relatively high. This is
corresponding with the relatively high tidal range in these areas. For example, the Gulf of Gabes off the
coast of Tunisia has a tidal range of nearly two meters, while tides are generally small in other parts of the
basin. Reference30 evaluated the GTSR extreme sea levels against observed sea levels from the archive of

the University of Hawaii (http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu). However, the set of tide gauges used for the
global validation has a very limited number of tide gauges available in the Mediterranean basin.
Therefore, we performed additional validation using the GESLA-2 dataset (http://gesla.org), which
includes data from many more tide gauges37. Here we use the estimates of the return periods of extreme
sea levels from reference38. They processed the raw data and fitted a Gumbel distribution to the annual
maxima using all stations that contain at least 20 complete years that is less than 25% missing data. For
the Mediterranean region, this resulted in 17 observation stations. To evaluate the performance of the
GTSR-MED extreme sea levels, we calculate the mean bias and the mean absolute error between the
modelled and observed extremes. The modelled extreme sea levels are generally characterized by a
negative bias. For a 10-year return period the mean bias is −0.21 m (s.d. 0.20 m), whereas for a 100-year
return period the mean bias is −0.34 m (s.d 0.41 m). As extreme sea level are generally below 1.5 m, the
relative differences exceeds 25% for a number of locations. This is depicted in Figure 3a-c. The relatively
strong negative bias may be due the fact that in semi-enclosed basins, such as the Mediterranean Sea,
extreme sea levels are largely controlled by local conditions and mesoscale dynamics. Hence, the
representation of the global bathymetry and the resolution of the global tide and surge model may not be
sufficient in this region. Moreover, in areas with a complex orography, such as the Adriatic Sea, global
climate reanalysis data can have difficulties in reproducing local winds39. Unfortunately, almost all tide
gauges are located in Portugal, Spain and Italy. Hence, the eastern and the southern part of the
Mediterranean Sea are under–represented. Therefore we were not able to assess the performance of the
model for the entire basin.

The DCESL data have been validated by reference32. The study concluded that the return periods of
DCESL are generally too high, compared to observed return periods from GESLA-2. Reference31 compared
the GTSR and DCESL against UHSCL observations. They found that both GTSR and DCESL capture the
spatial variability of extremes. However, DCESL generally overestimates the extreme sea levels, whereas
GTSR generally underestimates the extreme sea levels, but with smaller errors compared to observations.

However, this comparison included only few stations in the Mediterranean. The comparison of GTSR
and DCESL by reference38 is based on the GESLA-2 dataset and includes more stations. It shows that
DCESL overestimates the 100-year return period values by more than 0.5 m. If we compare the DCESL
return periods against the GESLA-2 stations used for the GTSR-MED validation (see above), the mean
bias is 0.16 m (s.d. 0.43 m), 0.17 m (s.d. 0.59 m), and 0.20 m (s.d. 0.76 m), respectively for the 10-, 100-,
and 1000-year return periods. For specific stations the bias is up to 1.5 m, whereas for other stations the
bias of DCESL is less than a few centimetres. Hence, although the performance is variable, DCESL
generally also overestimates extreme sea levels in the Mediterranean basin. Again, there is no information
to assess DCESL for the eastern and the southern part of the Mediterranean Sea.

We would like to highlight that due to the limited numbers of observations it is difficult to assess the
overall performance of the extreme sea level datasets. However, we recommend users that would like to
perform an analysis on a regional scale to use the GTSR-MED extreme sea levels as the standard deviation
(observed vs modelled) is smaller. Users that are interested in a specific location may be more interested in
the DCSEL dataset as the mean bias is smaller than for the GTSR-MED dataset, which indicates that the
modelled extreme sea levels may be closer to the observed values in some locations. Users interested in
coastal flood risk assessment to extreme sea levels should be aware that both datasets do not include waves.
Omitting waves could lead to an underestimation of potential impacts (see reference40).

Data attribution
The attribution of data to the coastal units involved several processing steps, which varied depending on
the type of dataset (as documented in the python scripts, see methods section). Every parameter of the
database was then checked manually in a Geographic Information System, by at least two different users,
to ensure correct attribution. This validation process was introduced to ensure internal consistency and,
to identify and correct errors or mismatches in the database compilation process.

Usage Notes
We envisage that academics, managers and planners will use the developed database for coastal
applications. We emphasize that the database is designed for regional-scale applications. Caution is
required when using the database for local applications.
