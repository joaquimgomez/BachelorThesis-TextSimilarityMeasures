Abstract

We investigate the rapidly changing equilibrium between the momentum sources and
sinks during the passage of a two-peak storm over the Catalan inner-shelf (NW
Mediterranean Sea). Velocity measurements at 24 m water depth are taken as rep-
resentative of the inner shelf, and the cross-shelf variability is explored with additional5
measurements at 50 m water depth. At 24 m, as the storm-related wind stress acceler-
ated the flow, velocity increased throughout the water column, resulting in bottom stress
starting to become important. The sea level also responded, with the pressure gradi-
ent force opposing the wind stress. In particular, during the second wind pulse, there
were rapid oscillations in the acceleration and advective terms, apparently reflecting10
the incapacity of the bottom stress to dissipate the high kinetic energy of the system.
The Coriolis and wave induced terms (via radiation stresses) were less important in
the momentum balance. The frictional adjustment time scale was around 10 h, consis-
tent with the e-folding time obtained from bottom drag parameterizations. Estimates of
the frictional time and Ekman depth confirm the prevailing frictional response at 24 m.15
The momentum evolution in deeper parts of the shelf (50 m) showed an increase in
the Coriolis force at the expense of the frictional term, typical in the transition from the
inner to the mid-shelf.

1 Introduction

The inner-shelf, encompassing depths ranging from a few to tens of meters, is dynam-20
ically defined as a region that lies between the surf zone (where waves break and the
momentum balance is dominated by wave-induced terms) and the middle shelf (where
the along-shelf circulation is usually in geostrophic balance) (Lentz and Fewings, 2012).
The water circulation over the inner-shelf has been studied through the analysis of the
momentum balance in different regions, but usually focused on conditions averaged25

over periods longer than one week (Lee et al., 1984; Lentz and Winant, 1986; Lentz
et al., 1999; Maza et al., 2006; Fewings and Lentz, 2010; Grifoll et al., 2012, 2013).

Energetic wind events, such as storms, modify the typical pattern of water circulation
over the continental shelf. The proximity of the coastline and the relevance of bottom
friction prevent the generation of inertial fluctuations, which often prevail in the mid and5
outer shelf following wind pulses (Salat et al., 1992; Shearman et al., 2005). Addition-
ally, during the passage of storms, the intense wind, and in some cases the associated
cooling, affects a large fraction of the water column. The frictional adjustment time, pro-
portional to water depth and inversely proportional to wind stress, is largely reduced
nearshore during such energetic events. As a consequence, the magnitude, phase and10
relative importance of the dominant terms in the momentum balance is modified. For
instance, during the passage of the tropical storm Floyd in the US east coast, Kohut
et al. (2006) found the prevalent terms that the size of the momentum terms increased
during the peak of the storm. They highlighted the rise in wind stress and the associ-
ated pressure gradient, with changes in sign between the storm and the subsequent15
relaxation period. Lee et al. (1984) found observational evidence on the sea-level slope
opposing the wind stress in order to establish a frictional equilibrium that differed from
the average conditions. A seasonal study of the Catalan Shelf (Grifoll et al., 2013) has
suggested that the occurrence of one single intense event can dominate the monthly
averaged momentum balance with water piling against the coast as a response to the20
enhanced wind stress; to balance the surface forcing, the bottom stress term was also
increased.

In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms causing the shifting momentum bal-
ance on short-time scales during a storm. The analysis is based on a set of observa-
tions from the Catalan inner-shelf (offshore the city of Barcelona; NW Mediterranean25
Sea; Fig. 1). The analysis characterizes the evolution of the different momentum terms
and examines the response time scales for the principal forcing mechanisms. The
prevalent terms at two different depths (24 and 50 m, where data is available) are ex-
amined. We take advantage of our setting in a micro-tidal environment to investigate

a temporal scale (from hours to few days) usually not considered in the literature, where
the time series are often low-pass filtered to remove the short-term fluctuations (e.g.
tidal flow).

2 Site location and data

The Catalan shelf is micro-tidal, with tidal amplitudes of the order of tens of cm. The5
wind and heat flux regimes exhibit a seasonal cycle associated with the Mediterranean
climate and the periodicity of meteorological events in the region. Wind intensity usu-
ally has a minimum during warm summer and is more energetic during fall, winter
and spring. During these seasons, regional storms are predominantly associated with
north and northeast winds alternating with northwesterly wind pulses (land winds).10
Grifoll et al. (2013) analyzed the resulting seasonal circulation pattern over the inner-
shelf through a combination of numerical and observational techniques. The flow is
prevalent in the along-shelf direction year-round, which is consistent with the coastal
constraint and the shallowness of the area. The monthly averaged along-shelf momen-
tum balance was between wind stress and pressure gradient with bottom stress being15
a second order term. In the present study, we focus on a subset of the data analyzed
by Grifoll et al. (2012) that includes an energetic event lasting a few days.

The bulk of the measurements correspond to a field experiment conducted over the
Catalan inner-shelf in the framework of the FIELD_AC project. The data set consisted
of velocity time series from three Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) deploy-20
ments (A1 [AWAC], A2 [AWAC] and A3 [RDI], Fig. 1). The ADCP bin size was 1 m.
The along-shore distance between A1 and A2 was 4 km. A1 and A2 were deployed
less than 1 km from the coast (24 m bottom depth) while A3 was 2 km away from the
coast (50 m bottom depth). Wave data were recorded through a directional wave buoy
[Datawell DWR-G7] moored in A3. Wind data were collected using a mast located at25
a Coastal Station Observatory (CSO; www.pontdelpetroli.org; see Fig. 1).

3 Results

3.1 Event description

The water currents during the entire field campaign were analyzed in a previous study
(Grifoll et al., 2012), highlighting the prevalence of the along-shelf direction and the
high correlation between the velocities measured at A1, A2 and A3. For this reason,5
we focus on the A2 observations, considered to be representative of the dynamics in
the inner-shelf, and use A1 and A3 to support the momentum term estimates. The
investigation of the cross-shelf variability in the along-shelf momentum equation also
uses A3 (50 m).

For the current analysis, we focus on the 12–15 March 2011 period, which included10
the passing of a NE storm with maximum wind intensities of 13 ms−1. The storm
was characterized by two energetic northeasterly wind peaks of similar magnitude
(12 March 05:00 UTC and 14 March 15:00 UTC). A relatively calm period in between
the peaks lasted 22 h (Fig. 2a; see reference system in Fig. 1) with a slight reverse in
wind direction. The storm finished on 15 March when the wind intensity decreased to15
zero.

The along-shelf velocity in the water column (Fig. 2b) was characterized by a preva-
lent southwestward flow. The velocity exhibited large vertical shear with near-surface
velocities being four times stronger than the near-bottom flow. The cross-shelf flow
(Fig. 2c) was less intense than the along-shelf flow and exhibited a complex verti-20
cal structure. During the calm day (13 March 00:00–22:00 UTC), the wind changed
direction slightly, towards the northeast (peaking at 13 March 15:00 UTC), but the
along-shelf currents maintained a similar magnitude and structure than the day before.
Meanwhile, the cross-shelf flow was weakly onshore. The second wind peak (14 March
15:00 UTC) was characterized by an intensification of the southeastward flow, while the25
cross-shelf flow was also enhanced. During the second peak (14 March), the onshore
surface flow was compensated by a return flow near the bottom. During the last day of
the storm (15 March), the surface wind stress decreased gradually from 0.2 Pa to zero

(15 March 23:00 UTC). The along-shelf flow remained towards the southeast through-
out the water column, and the cross-shelf flow was offshore in the sub-surface layers
balanced by onshore currents near bottom.

The depth-averaged along-shelf velocities were much larger than the depth-
averaged cross-shelf velocities during the two wind peaks (Fig. 2d) consistent with5
the strong polarization of the flow due to the coastal constraint. During the first day of
the storm (12 March), the depth-averaged current in the along-shelf direction (Fig. 2d)
was toward the southwest with a maximum peak during 12 March 07:00 UTC. The de-
tided sea level (Fig. 2e) increased during both wind peaks and slowly decreased after
the wind peak. After the storm, the sea level increased as a result of water being piled10
up against the coast due to the northeasterly wind. The wave conditions measured at
A3 were characterized by two significant wave height peaks (Fig. 3f) from the E–SE
direction with a wave period of 8 s.

3.2 Momentum balance in the inner-shelf

Assuming hydrostatic balance, small sea level variations compared with the total water15
depth, and neglecting the baroclinic terms (estimated as small in Grifoll et al., 2012
and Grifoll et al., 2013), the depth-averaged along-shelf momentum balance equation
can be written as:

Stewart, 1964). The data used for estimating the momentum terms have been low-pass
filtered with a 1/12 h−1 cut-off frequency to avoid very short-time scale fluctuations.
This choice of filter window is consistent with the velocity spectra that showed limited
energy in frequencies higher than inertial (Grifoll et al., 2012).

The along-shelf acceleration term at A2 (ACCE in Eq. 1) is estimated from the ob-5
servations using centered-finite differences with the velocity recorded at A2 (Fig. 3a).
A negative peak is observed in the acceleration time serie during the first wind peak.
After the wind direction reversal, the acceleration term oscillates indicating a readjust-
ment of the momentum balance (i.e. a relaxation period that lead to the pre-storm
conditions).10

The non-linear or advection term (ADVEC in Eq. 1) is estimated by finite differentia-
tion between the adjacent ADCP measurements (Kirincich and Bart, 2009). The size of
this term is smaller during the first peak of the storm. After the peak, the ADVEC term
oscillated in a manner similar to the acceleration term (Fig. 3b).

The Coriolis term (COR in Eq. 1), computed from depth-averaged cross-shelf veloc-15
ities at A2, follows a complex pattern during the storm (Fig. 3c). Although the surface
and sub-surface cross-shelf flows can be relatively important through the water column
(Fig. 2c), the depth-averaged cross-shelf flow is much smaller than the along-shelf ve-
locities (Fig. 2d). The size of this term is four times smaller than the acceleration term.

The along-shelf wind stress term (W-STR, Fig. 3d) is calculated using a neutral drag20
law (Large and Pond, 1981) from winds measured at the nearby meteorological station
(Fig. 1). There is a good correspondence between wind stress and along-shelf velocity
(Fig. 1a and d). The maximum (negative) acceleration, however, occurs a few hours
before the maximum winds (12 March 05:00 UTC and 12 March 07:00 UTC). After the
first wind peak the acceleration decreases rapidly and changes sign, becoming small25
but positive during the remaining of the wind pulse; after the second wind peak, the
acceleration displays three rapid oscillations with a period of about 12 h (Fig. 3a).

No direct estimate of the along-shelf pressure gradient (PRS-GRAD in Eq. 1) can
be obtained from the data. The ADCP recorded the pressure in the water column but

the distances between ADCPs are not sufficient to capture the along-shelf sea level
variability, as the signal-to-noise ratio was not satisfactory. Hickey (1984) pointed out
that, for spatial scales of the same order of magnitude as the external Rossby Radius
(about 100 km in the Catalan Sea), the expected sea level gradient would be of only
a few centimeters. In our case, the sea level variations recorded by the pair of pressure5
sensors in A1 and A2 (separated by only a few kilometers) were of the same order as
the accuracy of the devices (order millimeters). As an alternative approximation, the
pressure gradient force is computed using data from a sea level gauge located in the
harbor of Blanes (approximately 64 km to the north; Fig. 1) and the ADCP pressure
sensor at A2. The resulting pressure gradient force (−g∂n∂y ) obtained from the observa-10
tions (PGFO term) represents predominantly remote sea-level effects (Fig. 3e).

The bottom stress (B-STR, in Eq. 1) is estimated using a linear drag law (Lentz and
Winant, 1986):

τys = ρrvb, (2)

where r is the linear drag coefficient, ρ is density and vb is the near-bottom velocity15
(measured at about 1 m from the sea bottom). The estimation of the drag coefficient
depends on the water depth and the along-shelf velocity; significant fluctuations in the
value of r have been found to occur as the prevalent momentum terms change (Lentz
et al., 1999). Typical values for water depths of a few tens of meters are between 10−3

and 10−4 ms−1 (e.g. Winant and Beardsley, 1979). In our analysis, the drag coefficient20
was estimated using the momentum balance evolution, which is explained in the fol-
lowing paragraph.

We approximate the along-shelf pressure gradient force term as the residual from the
momentum balance equation when calculated from the wind stress, advection, bottom
stress, acceleration and Coriolis terms and define the pressure gradient force obtained25
from the Residual (PGFR) as:

PGFR =

Maza et al. (2006) used a similar approach to compute the pressure gradient force
when sea level gradient was not available from observations. In our case, the value
of r is estimated iteratively until the maximum PGFR matched the maximum PGFO
during the first peak of the storm. This strategy resulted in a value of r which is based
on the observations and consistent with the evolution of the momentum balance. The5
resulting value is 8.5×10−4 ms−1, comparable to values computed from observations
at similar depths (Winant and Beardsley, 1979).

The bottom stress (B-STR) and pressure gradient from residual (PGFR) terms are
shown in Fig. 3f and g, respectively. Both the observed and residual pressure-gradient
time series (PGFO and PGFR) reproduce the force direction of the sea-level slope10
during the wind stress peaks (Fig. 3d). The PGFR includes a contribution caused by
a direct response to the local wind forcing (for instance during 13 March), which is not
immediately obvious in PGFO. During the wind peaks, the positive pressure gradient
force partially counterbalanced the wind stress in a manner consistent with other ob-
servational studies (Lee et al., 1984; Lentz, 1994; Fewings and Lentz, 2010). In the15
analysis of the momentum balance evolution, we use PGFR rather than PGFO sim-
ply because, even though PGFR exhibited large uncertainty, it is consistent with the
estimates for the other momentum terms.

The wave induced mass fluxes (RAD-STR in Eq. 1) are estimated as follows:

Sxy = E

Syy = E

where the wave energy is computed as E = ρ0gH

sig/16, with Hsig as the significant

wave height, φ the wave direction of propagation, and cg and c respectively as the
(linear theory) group and phase velocity at the peak wave frequency. The numerical
model SWAN (Booij et al., 1999) was implemented and calibrated (Grifoll et al., 2014)25
in a 50 m-cell domain, which covered the area of interest (Fig. 1). Radiation stress

gradients are then estimated from two adjacent numerical cells in the proximity of A2
that considered the propagation of wave conditions measured at A3. Both radiation
stresses (Fig. 3h) have maximum values during the peaks in significant wave height
(about 2.5 m).

3.3 Momentum balance near the mid-shelf5

The cross-shelf variability of the along-shelf momentum is estimated by comparing
the inner-shelf results with the momentum terms at 50 m water depth. The terms that
may be estimated from the velocities observed at A3 are surface and bottom friction,
acceleration, and Coriolis force (Fig. 4). The surface stress term is estimated with the
local wind measured at CSO, scaled with the corresponding water depth. The non-10
linear terms are not estimated due to the lack of additional measurements at 50 m,
necessary for estimating the along-shelf gradient. Thus, the pressure gradient from the
residual is not estimated according to Eq. (3), as not all terms in the right-hand-side
were available. Alternatively, we estimate the pressure gradient as a residual (assuming
small non-linear effects) considering acceleration, Coriolis and frictional terms (wind15
and bottom friction), which lead to (PGFRACCE+COR+FRIC):

PGFRACCE+COR+FRIC =
∂v
∂t

+ f u−
τys
ρH

+
τyb
ρH

. (6)

The bottom stress term follows the same pattern as observed at 24 m, opposing the
wind stress term. The peaks in bottom stress term are lagged with respect to the timing
of the wind peaks measured at CSO. The first wind peak (starting 11 March 19:00 UTC)20
is followed by a maximum bottom stress that occurred 19 h later (12 March 16:00 UTC).

4 Discussion

4.1 Momentum evolution in the inner-shelf

From the estimated momentum terms, we may conclude that the primary balance at
24 m (Fig. 3) takes place between acceleration, wind, bottom friction, advective terms
and pressure gradient. Coriolis and radiation stress played secondary roles in the mo-5
mentum balance.

During the first peak (12 March), as the wind stress term grows, the acceleration
term becomes more negative and the bottom stress more positive, as expected from
the direction of the flow (Fig. 2a). The peak in the acceleration term occurs before the
wind maximum, as a result of the enhanced frictional dissipation and the increase of10
the pressure gradient force. Thus, the along-shelf current (Fig. 2a) is limited by the
intensity of the bottom friction.

During the calm period (13 March), the acceleration term is close to zero until
13 March 10:00 UTC. At that point, the acceleration becomes more negative, likely
as the response to an increase in the negative pressure gradient force (expected from15
the slight decrease in sea level during 13 March, Fig. 2d). The sea level fluctuation
may have been a direct response to the change in wind direction or may have been
caused by a relaxation following the first wind peak. The along-shelf flow did not reverse
(Fig. 2b) and neither did the bottom friction term (Fig. 3f). During the calm period, the
advection terms become larger than during the stress-peak period (12 March), sug-20
gesting a non-linear response to the forcing.

The second wind peak shares some characteristics with the first one. The accelera-
tion term and the PGFR are enhanced during the increase in wind stress. Before the
wind stress starts to decrease, the acceleration exhibits large fluctuations (Fig. 3a) that
are also transferred to the bottom friction, Coriolis and PGFR terms. During the second25
peak of the storm, the advective terms also respond with intense fluctuations in both
components. These fluctuations likely are a result of the increased energy available in
the system, not properly dissipated by the bottom stress.

The analysis highlights the importance of the initial conditions (whether the system
starts from rest or not) and the complexity of the momentum fluctuations during the
development of the storm. A comparison of the shifting momentum during both wind
peaks shows that the role of the acceleration and advective terms is quite different.
During the first peak, the advective terms are relatively small as a result of the linear5
response of the pressure gradient and bottom stress to the wind forcing. During the
second peak, however, the adjustments of the local sea level and the increase in avail-
able kinetic energy not dissipated by the bottom friction (still remaining from the first
wind peak) result in an increase of the non-linearity of the flow.

The radiation stress terms are one order of magnitude smaller than the primary10
balance suggested before (i.e. acceleration, pressure gradient and frictional terms).
Their sizes are consistent with other studies that neglect the wave forcing over the
inner-shelf (outside of the surf zone) because of the lack of wave breaking (Lentz,
1999; Fewings and Lentz, 2010). In a region 150 km north of our area (coastal region
offshore of the Tet River), Michaud et al. (2012) confirmed numerically that the wave15
effects on the inner-shelf circulation are relatively small at 28 m water depth even during
a storm event.

4.2 Frictional adjustment and Ekman depth in the inner-shelf

During the first wind peak, the increase in along-shelf velocity led to enhanced bottom
stress, until the latter balanced wind stress and along-shelf pressure gradient, there-20
fore achieving a complete frictional adjustment. A measure of the frictional adjustment
time can be extracted from the observations, considering the cross-zero momentum
and inflexion points in the time series. During the first peak (12 March), the estimates
are less uncertain because we can assume than the flow started from rest and the
non-linearities were small. The second peak included the local adjustment in sea level25
and advection, which increases the complexity of the momentum balance. A maximum
value for the frictional adjustment time is about 14 h (from 11 March 20:00 UTC to
12 March 10:00 UTC), corresponding to the time between zero and maximum bottom

stress during the first wind pulse. This frictional adjustment time doubles the frictional
time as computed from the linear drag law of the bottom stress term (t = H/r = 7.8 h)
and is consistent with typical values from similar depths. For instance, Winant and
Beardsley (1979) provided estimates ranging between 7 and 26 h at depths between
28 and 31 m. During the calm period (13 March), the frictional adjustment cannot be5
established, because even though there was a decrease in depth-averaged along-shelf
velocity (Fig. 2d), the wind duration and magnitude were too small.

To provide a framework for the frictional time, we consider Csanady’s (1981) lin-
earized analytical model, applied to the first wind peak period. The along-shelf velocity
response to a steady wind stress, considering only bottom friction, is controlled by the10
following expression:

∂v
∂t

=
τys
ρH
−
τyb
ρH

. (7)

Solving this equation (see Appendix), we obtain an exponential relation with a charac-
teristic frictional adjustment time scale (tf).

tf =
H

2
√

τysCda
ρ

, (8)15

where Cda is a bottom drag coefficient associated with the depth averaged velocity. For
a value of wind stress of 0.12 Pa (averaged value during the first peak), tf is 13 h. This
magnitude agrees fairly well with the frictional adjustment time estimated from obser-
vations (about 14 h) and confirms the short response time of the along-shelf current.
Therefore, the adjustment time scale expected from a geostrophic balance is larger20
(f −1 = 18.15 h) than the frictional time scales in the inner shelf. This result is consistent
with the reduced importance of the Coriolis term in the along-shelf momentum balance
and highlights the dependence of the flow on bottom dissipation at depths of the order
of 24 m during a storm, precluding the appearance of inertial fluctuations independently
of the coastal constraint.25

The sea surface adjustment time estimated from observations during the storm is
of the same order of magnitude as the time scale of the forcing wind. The sea level
adjustment is characterized by two separate components: one responding to local wind
forcing and another associated with sea level oscillations at scales of the order of the
external Rossby radius (Hickey, 1984), or about 100 km in the Catalan Shelf. These5
large scale fluctuations need a longer time to be compensated.

The short frictional adjustment time is related with the inner-shelf nature of the study
site during the storm. The inner-shelf is defined as the region where the combined
surface and bottom boundary layers occupy the entire water column (Lentz, 1994).
Obviously, the boundaries of the inner-shelf region vary in time depending of the inten-10
sity of the forcing mechanism. The bottom and surface Ekman depth can be obtained
from empirical formulations such as (Weatherly and Martin, 1978):

δ =
1.3u∗
√
Nf

(9)

where u∗ = (τs/ρ)
1/2 is the friction velocity, τs is surface/bottom stress magnitude and

N2 = gdρ/dz is the squared buoyancy frequency. The time evolution of the surface15
and bottom Ekman layers (Fig. 5) is computed iteratively (as N depends on the vertical
position within the water column). The buoyancy frequency for Eq. (8) is estimated
using the CTD measurements during 17 March (two days after the storm; Grifoll et al.,
2012). The N values are estimated to be 0.03 s−1 for the surface layer and 0.005 s−1

for the bottom layer. The boundary layers overlapped most of the time during the storm20
event (Fig. 5). Even though the applicability of Eq. (8) has been questioned for areas
influenced by freshwater discharge (Garvine, 2004; Dzwonkowski et al., 2014), the
calculated Ekman layer depths are consistent with the importance of the frictional terms
in the along-shelf dynamics. Periods with less energetic wind conditions exhibit smaller
wind stress, so the relative importance of the Coriolis term is enhanced at 24 m (Grifoll25
et al., 2012).

4.3 Cross-shelf variability of the along-shelf momentum terms

The cross-shelf variability of the along-shelf momentum is investigated with the help of
the momentum terms calculated at 50 m water depth. The frictional adjustment time,
as observed through the evolution of the momentum terms at 50 m, exhibited a 4 h lag
when compared with the frictional adjustment time at 24 m (Sect. 4.1), likely caused5
by the time delay in the vertical transfer of momentum. The resulting linear drag coeffi-
cient, r = 7.3×10−4 ms−1, is close to the r value for the inner-shelf (8.5×10−4 ms−1),
supporting our analysis during the first storm peak, in terms of the linear response to
wind stress and the pressure gradient estimated from the residual.

The relative ratio of the fluctuations (Standard Deviations: SDs) in the acceleration10

and wind stress terms, (
ρ0H∂v/∂t

τys
), increases offshore (from 1.10 at 24 m to 1.36 at

50 m). These values are larger than estimates from other shelves (Lentz and Fewings,
2012): in the Middle Atlantic Bight, around 0.3 and 0.5 at 25 and 50 m, respectively;
and in the West Florida Shelf, 0.5 and 1 for 25 and 50 m, respectively. The larger values
found in the Catalan Shelf are ascribed to the enhanced acceleration during the storm.15

The size of the Coriolis term at 50 m increases in comparison to the size of this term
estimated at 24 m water depth. The SD also increases offshore, from 9.6×10−7 ms−2
at 24 m to 1.5×10−6 ms−2 at 50 m. The ratio of the fluctuations between the Coriolis
and wind stress terms

ρ0Hfu
τys

increased from 0.3 at 24 m to 1.3 at 50 m water depth.

Lentz and Fewings (2012) presented ratios around 0.4 for the Middle Atlantic Bight and20
West Florida Shelf at 25 m, and between 2 and 3 at 50 m depth.

The increasing/decreasing importance of the Coriolis/bottom-frictional terms re-
sponds to a switch towards the geostrophic balance, typical in the transition from
the inner to the mid-shelf. With increasing depth, the frictional effects decrease in
the along-shelf momentum balance. Lee et al. (1984) observed that the Coriolis term25
doubled from 28 to 75 m water depth in the South Atlantic Bight (USA), with progres-
sively smaller frictional terms. At the start of our study period (11 March 2011; see

Fig. 4), the 50 m water depth Coriolis term was larger than the other terms, suggesting
a geostrophic balance during the calm period.

During the storm period, the PGFRACCE+COR+FRIC term (at 50 m) is moderately cor-
related with the Coriolis term (R = 0.55 with 95 % confidence level). This correlation
suggests that the dynamic response at 50 m includes a significant geostrophic compo-5
nent, in contrast to the balance at 24 m where the PGFR were not as correlated with
Coriolis (R = 0.33 with 95 % confidence level). However, the acceleration and frictional
terms, and likely the non-linear terms, also played an important role at 50 m water
depth during the storm; for example, the acceleration terms at 24 and 50 m are also
moderately correlated (R = 0.64 with 95 % confidence level). Michaud et al. (2013),10
from observations in the Gulf of Lion (275 km north of our study area; see Fig. 1) at
65 m depth, also emphasized the importance of the wind-induced geostrophic currents
during a storm.

The cross-shelf changes in the relative importance of the frictional and geostrophic
terms in the along-shelf momentum balance (Fig. 6) can be explored by comparing the15
frictional times (Eq. 7) with the inertial time (f −1 = 18.15 h). The frictional and inertial
times during the peak of the storm (surface stress τ = 0.25 Pa) are equal for water
depths of 94 m; for the average stress of the storm (surface stress τ = 0.12 Pa) this
happens for water depths of 64 m. Thus, the frictional effects dominated for depths
up to around 60 m, causing our current meters to be located in regions controlled by20
inner-shelf dynamics during the whole storm. For the frictional and inertial times to
be the same the wind stress would have to be 0.075 Pa at 50 m and 0.02 Pa at 24 m.
Therefore, the Coriolis term of the momentum balance is not important at 24 m except
for very low surface stresses, such as during the calm period between the two storm
pulses (0.02 Pa); during those times other terms, like the pressure gradient force, will25
dominate the along-shelf momentum balance (Grifoll et al., 2013).

5 Conclusions and final remarks

Our analysis has assessed the effects of the passage of a storm over the inner Catalan
Shelf (NW Mediterranean Sea) on the along-shelf momentum balance. At 24 m water
depth, a primary momentum balance between the acceleration, pressure gradient and
frictional (surface and bottom) terms was established. The advection terms apparently5
were occasionally important, but difficult to estimate from observations. The Coriolis
and the wave-induced momentum terms play a second order role in the momentum
balance. The storm had two separate peaks that caused distinct responses: during the
first peak the advective terms were small (i.e. linear response) but during the second
peak they increased markedly; this non-linear behavior happened via a local adjust-10
ment to pressure gradient, as a result of the increased kinetic energy from the initial
wind peak that the bottom stress was not able to dissipate. The frictional adjustment
time and Ekman depth estimates confirmed the prevalence of the frictional response of
the flow at 24 m. The increasing importance of Coriolis at 50 m corresponds to a shift
towards the geostrophic behavior, characterizing the transition from the inner to the15
mid-shelf.

In our analysis, we have focused on the shelf response to a single storm, where
extensive observational data were available. However, northeasterly energetic wind
events are common during spring and fall in the Catalan Shelf, so similar events are
expected on a yearly basis. The extrapolation of our results to other shelves depends20
on physical variables such as stratification, river discharge and remote sea-level forc-
ing. In relatively low-energy shelves, such as the Catalan shelf, it is plausible that two-
peak storms be commonly characterized by a sequence of linear response followed by
a subsequent non-linear behavior.

Early investigations (e.g. Scott and Csanady, 1976) pointed out that tidally driven25
fluctuations difficult the analysis of the wind induced circulation at depths where the
frictional adjustment time is similar to tidal periods. For this reason, in tidal active re-
gions, wind-driven changes at scales shorter than the semidiurnal period are very dif-

ficult to detect; the associated depth for this period is about 60 m in typical wind events
(Csanady, 1981). In contrast, the micro-tidal nature of Catalan shelf has allowed us
to investigate in detail the shelf response at temporal scales shorter than previously
investigated for the inner-shelf.

Appendix: Frictional adjustment time for linear and quadratic formulations5

A simple model to determine the frictional time adjustment was presented by Csanady
(1981), based on the transport momentum equation in the along-shelf direction:

where the transport is:

and the frictional velocity is given by:

. (A3)

Under the assumption that the depth distribution is only a function of the cross-shelf co-
ordinate, we neglect the along-shelf pressure gradients. If the depth distribution is taken15
only in function of x so there is no reason why pressure gradients should emerge. Also,

the coastal constraint near the coast implies U = 0. These conditions lead a frictional
balance between the acceleration and the wind and bottom stresses:

∂V
∂t

= u∗2 −
τyb
ρ

. (A4)

The bottom stress was parameterized by Csanady (1981) using a quadratic drag law
equation in function of the depth-averaged current (V/H):5

τyb
ρ

= Cda

(
V
H

)2
. (A5)

Integrating, the solution for the along-shelf transport follows an exponential equation:

V =
u∗H√
Cda


1−exp

(
−2u∗t

√
Cda/H

)
1+exp

(
−2u∗t

√
Cda/H

)

 , (A6)

with an e-folding time scale of:

tf =
H

2
√

τys · Cda
ρ

. (A7)10

Alternatively, we may consider the bottom frictional term to depend linearly on the
depth-averaged current:

τyb
ρ

= r
(
V
H

)
. (A8)

In this case, the solution follows again an exponential solution:

V =
u∗2H

where the e-folding time scale is H/r , as expected according to the lineal parametriza-
tion of the bottom stress in Eq. (2). Linear and quadratic derived frictional time ex-
pressions have the same physical meaning, with e-folding times proportional to the
water depth and inversely proportional to bottom stress parameter (e.g. r o Cda). For
the linear and quadratic formulations, at long times the depth-averaged velocities tend5

asymptotically to u
∗

√
Cda

and u
∗2

r , respectively, which are the velocities required for bottom

stress to balance the wind stress.

Figure 6. Top panel: cross-shelf transect of the frictional adjustment times for several wind
stresses together with the inertial time off the city of Barcelona (18.15 h, grey solid line). The
cross-shelf variation of the frictional adjustment time (computed following Eq. 7) is shown for
storm peak conditions (red line) and averaged storm conditions (blue line). The two dotted
lines correspond to wind stresses such that the frictional and inertial times become equal at
24 m (t24) and 50 m (t50) water depth. Bottom panel: the location of the inertial, frictional and
transition zones for the peak and mean storm conditions. The ADCP locations at 24 and 50 m
are indicated with black and blue triangles, respectively.
