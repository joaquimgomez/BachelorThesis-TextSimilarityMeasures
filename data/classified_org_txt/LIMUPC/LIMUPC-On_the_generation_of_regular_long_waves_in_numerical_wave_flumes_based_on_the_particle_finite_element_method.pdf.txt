 On the generation of regular long waves in the Particle Finite Element 

Method 

ABSTRACT 

Most of the coastal hydraulic studies in physical and numerical wave flumes (NWF) require the correct 

generation of non-linear, long period waves in intermediate and shallow water. In this paper, the ability 

to generate such long waves in a NWF based on the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) is 

analyzed. Wavemaker theories based on Stokes Second Order wave theory, Cnoidal wave theory and 

Solitary wave theory are implemented in the NWF through a piston type paddle boundary conditions. 

An assessment of the capability and robustness of generation and propagation of long waves in the 

NWF is carried out. Numerical results are compared to theoretical results and data from specific 

physical tests. Results indicate that regular long waves of permanent form can be generated in a NWF 

based on the PFEM using the implemented wavemaker theories. However, a compromise has to be 

made between the target wave conditions and the validity field of each wavemaker theory when 

choosing a wavemaker theory.     

Keywords: Gravity waves; Hydraulic models; Particle Finite Element Method; Solitary 

waves; two-dimensional numerical simulation 

1 Introduction 

Physical wave flumes have been widely applied in laboratory studies dealing with the 

hydraulic and stability behavior of coastal structures, beach profile evolution and other related 

coastal phenomena involving waves. Most of these hydraulic studies require the generation of 

long waves in intermediate and shallow water wave conditions. Normally for these wave 

conditions we have high Ursell numbers (�� = ��� ℎ�⁄ , � wave height; � wave length; ℎ 
water depth) and low relative water depths (ℎ �⁄ ) that means the presence of highly nonlinear 
waves. Therefore the accuracy of laboratory results depends on the accuracy of and ability to 

generate robustly such energetic long waves.  

The most common way to generate waves in physical flumes is by moving a paddle in contact 

with the water volume (Hughes, 1993; Hudspeth and Guenther, 2009). An analytical solution 

for waves generated by piston and flap paddles based on linear wave theory was derived by 

Biesel and Suquet (1951).     

The appearance of second harmonic free waves for some wave conditions when moving the 

paddle sinusoidaly were reported by different authors (Morison and Crooke, 1953; Goda, 

1967; Le Méhauté et al., 1968; Galvin, 1968; Iwagaki and Sakai, 1970). 

The amplitude of the second harmonic free and bound wave has been derived by Madsen

(1971) under the assumption of relative long waves (ℎ �⁄ ≤0.1) and for waves generated by a 
piston-type wavemaker. Goda (1997) solved the amplitude and phases of secondary and 

tertiary bound and free nonlinear components as well as the interference waves with a 

perturbation technique for a piston-type wavemaker.  

In order to prevent the generation of unwanted secondary waves several authors proposed 

different solutions for second order wavemaker generation theories. Using Lagrangian 

coordinates Fontanet (1961) gave a complete solution to the problem.  Madsen (1971) derived 

an approximate solution giving an explicit expression of the wave paddle motion. Daugaard 

(1972) gave other approximate second order solution for a piston paddle. For a wave paddle 

that is hinged at or below the bottom of the flume Flick and Guza (1980) found a solution. 

Hudspeth and Sulisz (1991) gave the complete analytical solution for a generic planar wave 

paddle moving in a monochromatic oscillation. For a piston and a hinged wave paddle, 

Schäffer (1996) gave the complete solution including superharmonics (sum frequencies) and 

subharmonics (difference frequencies). Second order wavemaker theories were also 

developed for the generation of multidirectional waves in basins (Steenberg and Schäffer, 

2001; Schäffer and Steenberg, 2003). 

On the other hand, wavemaker models based on other wave theories have been developed to 

generate waves with a constant profile for a given high steepness, � �⁄ , or a very small 
relative depth, ℎ �⁄ . Goring (1979) developed a wavemaker theory based on cnoidal wave 
theory using a piston type wave board.  This theory was developed in order to accurately 

simulate tsunami waves. Based on stream function wave theory Zhang and Schäffer (2007) 

developed a wavemaker theory that can be used to generate even higher order waves.   

In coastal engineering, the solitary wave is commonly used to represent certain characteristics 

of tsunamis, storm surges, and other long free surface oscillations. To generate a solitary 

wave using a piston-type wavemaker, the plate displacement as a function of time was 

determined by Goring (1979). Later on, other wavemaker theories for the generation of 

solitary waves were presented (Synolakis, 1990; Guizien and Barthélémy, 2002; Malek-

Mohammadi and Testik, 2010). Several studies focus on the investigation of solitary wave 

properties were performed based on the generation of solitary waves in experimental facilities 

(e.g.; Liu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2015). 

In the last three decades, there have been important developments in numerical models 

dealing with fluid-solid interactions. This has gone in parallel with an increased study of 

wave-structure interaction problems in NWFs. The NWFs presented in the scientific literature 

can be grouped based on their basic equations and numerical schemes. NWF based on Non 

Linear Shallow Water (NLSW) equations applied to maritime structures were presented by

van Gent (1994), Dodd (1998) and Hu et al. (2000). The linear and fully nonlinear potential 

wave theory were successful used as NWF to study a wide range of wave processes including 

the runup, reflection and shoaling of solitary waves (e.g. Grilli and Svendsen, 1991; Grilli et 

al. 1994; Wu et al., 2014). Several coastal engineering studies with NWF based on the 

Volume of Fluid (VOF) technique for solving Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible 

fluids can be found in the literature. Van Gent et al. (1994) presented a VOF model that can 

simulate plunging wave breaking into porous structures. Lin and Liu (1998) described the 

development of a VOF type model based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations 

to study the evolution of wave groupiness, shoaling, and breaking in the swash zone. The IH-

2D VOF model was successfully applied to a variety of wave structure interaction studies 

(Lara et al., 2006) including wave vegetation interaction simulations (Maza et al, 2013).  

The use of the mesheless Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique in coastal 

engineering began at the end of the 90's (Monaghan and Kos, 1999). Dalrymple and Rogers 

(2006) studied the plunging wave breaker using a model based on the SPH method. Shao et 

al. (2006) presented an incompressible SPH model to study wave-coastal structure interaction 

problems.  

The Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method is another meshless technique that has 

been used in NWFs to study physical phenomena such as wave breaking (Koshizuka et al. 

1998) or wave impact pressures (Khayyer and Gotoh, 2009). Recent GPU (Graphics 

Processing Unit) versions of SPH (Herault et al., 2010; Gomez-Gesteira et al., 2012; 

Domínguez, et al., 2013) and MPS (Hori et al., 2011) models represent an important 

improvement in the reduction of computational time to allow the simulation of more realistic 

cases.     

The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) introduced by Idelsohn et al. (2003a) has also 

been used as the basis for a NWF (Oliveira et al., 2009a; Oliveira et al., 2012). Oliveira et al. 

(2009a) validated the generation of regular waves in a NWF based on PFEM using a first 

order wavemaker theory. The authors were able to generate a wide number of short wave 

conditions (0.14<ℎ �⁄ <0.23) with low Ursell numbers (0.26<��<9.20). Oliveira et al. (2012) 
simulated wave overtopping for impermeable maritime structures using a first order 

wavemaker theory to generate waves.      

A NWF should be an accurate representation of a physical wave flume (eventually of a 

natural beach profile) and the correct generation of waves becomes a fundamental 

requirement. In the NWF based on SPH, MPS and PFEM waves are generated in a way 

similar to physical flumes. In these cases, the most common way to generate waves is through 

the movement of a paddle that is generally located at one of the ends of the flume.

In recent years, there has been an increase interest in the use of the PFEM to study a variety 

of hydraulic problems involving large free surface motion (e.g. Rossi and Oñate, 2010; Larese 

et al., 2012; Becker et al., 2015; Dang and Meschke, 2014; Gimenez and González, 2015). 

Although a NWF based on PFEM can be a powerful tool to study hydraulic phenomena 

involving waves, a boundary condition to generate waves in intermediate and shallow water 

conditions needs to be developed.  

The main objectives of this work are: 1) to study the nonlinear phenomena that occur when 

regular long waves are generated in a NWF based on the PFEM by a sinusoidal wavemaker 

movement 2) to introduce the ability to generate regular long waves in a NWF based on the 

PFEM. In order to achieve these objectives five steps were established. First, a series of small 

scale physical tests were carried out focusing on the generation of regular long waves using a 

first order wavemaker theory. In a second step, physical test conditions were reproduced in 

the NWF. The behavior of free harmonics in the physical and numerical flumes was 

compared and the NWF was calibrated. In a third step, the piston paddle wavemaker theories 

based on stokes second order wave theory (Madsen, 1971), cnoidal wave theory (Goring, 

1979) and solitary wave (Goring, 1979) were implemented in the NWF. In the fourth step, the 

wave conditions tested in the steps before were generated in the NWF using the new 

implemented wavemaker theories. The elimination of free harmonics was analyzed 

subsequently. In the fifth step, two cases of regular long waves, that can be difficult to 

simulate in physical flumes due to limitations in paddle stroke and velocity, were simulated 

and analyzed in the NWF.  

The layout of this paper is the following: Section 2 describes the main characteristics of the 

numerical technique PFM. In Section 3 the wavemaker theories used in this study are 

summarized. In section 4 the small scale physical tests are presented. Section 5 is dedicated to 

all numerical simulations including the wavemaker theories that were implemented in the 

NWF. In this section there is some discussion of results and model performance. The paper 

ends with the main conclusions and recommendations for further research. 

2 The Particle Finite Element Method with a free-surface 

The PFEM is now a well-known method in the scientific literature (Idelsohn et al., 2003a, 

Oñate et al., 2004, Oñate et al., 2008). However, some specific key features of the PFEM are 

also included in this paper for completeness. The PFEM solves the fluid mechanics equations 

by a Lagrangian approach. It is a particular class of Lagrangian flow formulations, developed 

to solve free surface flow problems involving large deformations of the free surface, as well 

as the interaction with rigid bodies. The finite element method (FEM) is used to solve the 

continuum equations in the fluid and solid domains. The PFEM treats the mesh nodes in the

fluid and solid domains as particles, which can freely move and even separate from the main 

fluid domain representing, for instance, the effect of water drops or melted zones. The data 

between two consecutive time steps is only transferred through nodes, because elements are 

created again at every time step by a re-meshing process with new conectivities. 

In the PFEM the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations (Navier-Stokes) 

in the final �� position are written as follows: 
�� + � ������ = 0 (1) 

���� = − ���� � + ���� ��� + ��� (2) 
where � is the density, �� are the cartesian components of the velocity field, � the pressure, ��� the deviatoric stress tensor, ��  the source tensor (usually the gravity), ��� represents the total 
or material time derivate. 

For Newtonian fluids the stress tensor ���  may be expressed as a function of the velocity field 
through the viscosity � by: 

For near incompressible flows 
� ���� ≪ � "��#  and thus: 

Then, the stress tensor ���  can be written as: 

Using Eq. (5) the momentum conservation equation can be written as: 

 

Traditionally, computational fluids dynamics problems have been solved by models based on 

Eularian or ALE formulations. In Eularian formulations the non-linearity is explicitly 

presented in the convective terms. In the PFEM Lagrangian formulation the non-linearity is 

due to the fact the momentum equation is written in the final positions of the particles.

The Navier-Stokes equations are time dependent and thus a temporal integration needs to be 

carried out. The fractional-step method proposed in Codina (2001) is used in PFEM for the 

time solution. Even when using an implicit time integration scheme, incompressibility 

introduces some wiggles in the pressure solution which must be stabilized to avoid pressure 

oscillations in some particular cases. In the PFEM a simple and effective procedure to derive 

a stabilized formulation for incompressible flows based on the so-called Finite Calculus (FIC) 

formulations (Oñate, 2000) is used. 

In order to solve the governing equations that represent the continuum particles must be 

connected. A mesh discretizing the fluid and solid domains must be generated in order to 

solve the governing equations for both the fluid and solid problems in the standard FEM 

fashion. A fast regeneration of the mesh at every time step on the basis of the position of the 

nodes in the space domain is used. A mesh is generated at each time step using the so-called 

Extended Delaunay Tessellation (EDT) (Idelsohn et al., 2003b). The EDT allows the 

generation of non standard meshes combining elements of arbitrary polyhedrical shapes 

(triangles, quadrilaterals and other polygons in the 2D case) in a computing time of order n, 

where n is the total number of nodes in the mesh. One of the key to solve a fluid mechanics 

problem using a Lagrangian formulation is to generate efficiently the shape functions to 

approximate the unknown spatial variation. In the PFEM the interpolation function used by 

the Meshless Finite Element Method (MFEM) (Idelsohn et al., 2003c) is applied. EDT 

together with the MFEM are the main keys to make the PFEM a useful tool. 

The CPU required for meshing grows linearly with the number of nodes. However, Oñate et 

al., (2008) found that the CPU time for solving the equations exceeds that required for 

meshing as the number of nodes increases. As in the standard FEM, the quality of the 

numerical solution depends on the discretization chosen. Adaptive mesh refinements 

techniques can be used to improve the solution in zones of special interest. 

It must be noted that the information in the PFEM is typically nodal-based, i.e. the element 

mesh is mainly used to obtain the values of the state variables (i.e. velocities, pressure, 

viscosity, etc.) at the nodes. A difficulty arises in the identification of the boundary of the 

domain from a given collection of nodes. Indeed the boundary can include the free surface of 

the fluid and the individual particles moving outside the fluid domain. For this purpose the 

Alpha Shape technique (Edelsbrunner and Mucke, 1994) has been used to identify the 

boundary nodes. 

In summary the main difference between the PFEM and the classical FEM is the remeshing 

technique and the evaluation of the boundary position at each time step. The remaining steps 

in the computation are equivalent to those of the classical FEM.

3 Wavemaker theories 

The following sections show different wave generation equations for theoretical waves 

generated on the test-section side of the paddle. 

3.1 First order wave generation 

The free surface profile of a simple sinusoidal wave as a function of horizontal distance � and 
time t is given by: 

, = - cos123� − 4�5 (7) 
where - is the wave amplitude, 23 is the wave number (23 = 26 �⁄ ), 4 the angular frequency 
(4 = 26 7⁄ ), � is the wave length and 7 the wave period. 
By means of the first order wavemaker theory a simple sinusoidal wave can be generated in a 

wave flume (Hughes, 1993). For a piston paddle type the paddle displacement can be 

obtained as was proposed by Biesel and Suquet (1951): 

 

831�5 = 2- 9sinh223ℎ + 223ℎ8 sinh� 23ℎ > sin4� (8) 
where ℎ is the water depth in front of the paddle. 
Madsen (1970) proposed that the leakage around the paddle will decrease the amplitude of the 

generated waves by an amount ∆- which may be found from: 
∆-- = −@2.22B 1cosh23ℎ ∆Dℎ E3ℎsinh 23ℎ + 1.11∆FG H1 + B 1cosh 23ℎIJKL-�  

(9) 

 

where ∆D is the gap between the wavemaker and the bottom, ∆F is the gap between the 
sidewalls and the wavemaker, G is the width of the wave tank, � is the amplitude of the 
sinusoidal wavemaker velocity and L is the gravity. The basic assumption in the derivation of 
Eq. (9) is that the progressive waves being generated are moderately long, i.e. ℎ �⁄ < 1 6⁄ , 
since only then can the evanescent modes be assumed small. Another assumption is that the 

wavemaker generates waves in both directions, i.e. one propagating into the test section in 

front and another one (out of phase with the former) in the region behind the wavemaker.     

3.2 Second order wave generation 

According to Madsen (1971) in physical terms periodic progressive relatively long waves 

generated by a wavemaker moving in a sinusoidal way can be expressed as: 

(1) A first harmonic linear wave of amplitude - and wave number 23

corresponding to the linear solution of amplitude -O1�5and wave number 223 
(3) A second harmonic free wave of small amplitude -P1�5and wave number 2P1�5 

And the surface elevation at a fixed value of x can be expressed as:

The ratio of the amplitudes of the second and first harmonic, -O1�5 -⁄ , is clearly a measure of 
the meaningfulness of a Stokes second order solution for a progressive wave. For long waves 

this ratio may be written as: 

-O1�5- = 3��326� (11) 
The amplitude of the second harmonic free wave, -P1�5, is given by: 

-P1�5 = 12-� coth k3hh 9 34 sinh� 23ℎ − VQ2 > tanh2P
1�5ℎV�  (12) 

where: 

VQ = Q� R1 + �XYZ[\]^�XYZS ;	 					V� = Q�$1 + �Xa1b5Z[\]^�Xa1b5Z)	  (13) 
 

The second harmonic free wave may be eliminated when the wavemaker motion is prescribed 

as: 

8�1�5 = 2- 9sinh223ℎ + 223ℎ8 sinh� 23ℎ > sin4� + -
�8ℎH3 cosh 23ℎsinh� 2P1�5ℎ

− sinh 22P1�5ℎ + 22P1�5ℎ2	sinh� 2P1�5ℎ Isin 24� 
(14) 

where 8� is the paddle position given by second order wavemaker theory. 
The generated waves should therefore be purely progressive and of permanent form.

According to Madsen (1971) for accurate second order solution approximation it should have 

�� ≪ ��� 6�. It may be shown that when -O1�5 -⁄ > 1 4⁄  the Stokes second order profile 
exhibits a small secondary crest in the trough of the main wave.  

This secondary crest does not appear in the periodic solution of the Korteweg-DeVries 

equation (Cnoidal waves), which is regarded as superior to the Stokes expansion in describing 

long finite amplitude waves. This argument leads us to limit the applicability of the theory 

developed to cases corresponding to values of �� ≤ d�6�. 
3.3  Cnoidal wave generation 

The free surface profile of a cnoidal wave, ,e, is mathematically represented as: 
,e1�, �5 = 1ℎ� − ℎ5 + �gV�1he , i5 (15) 

where 

he = 2	E1i5 9�7 − 8e� > (16) 
and ℎ� is the distance between wave trough and bottom, E1i5 is the complete elliptic integral 
of the first kind, gV is the Jacobian elliptic function and i denotes the Jacobian elliptic 
parameter. 

Using Newton’s Rule Goring (1979) derived an iterative equation to calculate he. After 
determining iteratively he for a specified time, the wave board displacement can be obtained 
as: 

8e1�5 = � 9�7 − he2E1i5> (17) 
Goring (1979) suggested to start the paddle movement from the point where paddle velocity 

is minimum to avoid spurious waves to be generated.     

3.4 Solitary wave generation 

The free surface profile of a solitary wave obtained as the solution of the weakly dispersive 

weakly nonlinear one-equation Boussinesq model (Boussinesq, 1871) is given by: 

,F1�, �5 = �jkgℎ�1h5 (18) 
where 

h = 2O1lO� − 8O5	;	 2O = m �noZp 	 ; 		lO = KL1ℎ + �5	 (19)

Wavemaker theories for shallow water conditions are based on the assumption that paddle 

velocity should match desired water particle velocities. The time-dependent wave board 

trajectory can be obtained using Newton’s Rule as suggested by Goring (1979) as: 

8O1�5 = �2Oℎ �-Vℎ 2O1lO� − 8O5 (20) 
Although the simple jkgℎ� profile given by Eq. (18) is not the solitary solution of the full 
Euler equation, it should represent a good approximation of it for low values of �/ℎ (Tanaka, 
2006; Clamond and Dutykh, 2013; Dutykh and Clamond 2014). In other words, Eq. (18) can 

at best represent reference solitary wave solutions for low values of �/ℎ in the framework of 
inviscid Navier-Stokes equations. Tanaka (2006) and Clamond and Dutykh (2013) proposed 

methods and algorithms that permit computing higher solitary waves with improved accuracy.  

Goring (1979) proposed that an accurate solitary wave can be generated by Eq. (20) only if �/ℎ<0.2.  
4 Physical Model Tests 

4.1 Model Setup  

The experiments were carried out in the small scale flume CIEMito, of the Maritime 

Engineering Laboratory (LIM) at the Technical University of Catalonia BarcelonaTech 

(UPC-BarcelonaTech). The flume is 18 m long, 0.4 m wide, and 0.6 m deep and is provided 

with a piston type wave paddle capable of generating both regular and irregular waves. Thirty 

seven regular wave conditions were tested with wave height ranging between 0.03 m to 0.19 

m and wave period from 1.60 s to 3.50 s. Twenty four wave cases were tested with 0.32 m 

depth and thirteen with 0.25 m water depth. Ursell number (Ur) ranged from 0.19 to 54.89, 

and relative water depths from 0.06 to 0.82 (see Table 1). For each wave case the wavemaker 

motion was ramped up over a period of 2 wave periods after which a train consisting of ten 

periodic waves was generated followed by a ramp-down lasting 2 periods. The first wave 

ramp objective is to slowly increase the wavemaker stroke at startup until it reaches its 

desired value. Wave ramps avoid unwanted large waves considered as a transient response 

associated with the starting and stopping of the wavemaker (Madsen, 1970).    

Paddle displacement was calculated by first order wavemaker theory as proposed by Biesel 

and Suquet (1951) (Eq. 8). 

Water depth was kept constant along the flume and eight resistance gauges were used to 

measure the free surface evolution at 1.0 m, 2.0 m, 4.0 m, 4.5 m, 6.0 m, 7.0 m, 9.0 m and 10 

m from the zero paddle position. A sampling rate of 100 Hz was used. The level of accuracy

of these sensors is about 0.001 m. The free surface sensors are represented in Fig. 1, and their 

relative positions can be obtained from Table 2.  

Two dissipative zones composed of textile material were used in the experiments. In front of 

the paddle, 13.00 m away from it, a 2.50 m long dissipative zone was built. Behind the 

paddle, 0.75 m away from it, a 1.75 m long dissipative zone was used. During the 

experiments the gap between the sidewalls and the paddle was 0.01 m and the gap between 

the paddle and the bottom was 0.006 m. 

4.2 Free and coupled harmonics analysis method    

In order to study the temporal and spatial evolution of the different harmonics present in the 

generated waves a particular methodology was developed. The main goal of this method is to 

analyze periodic waves from a given free surface series. Therefore, wave ramps, transition 

waves, reflected waves and waves previous to the arrival of free harmonics, should be 

eliminated from the free surface series. This methodology consists of three steps:        

Step 1 – Determination of approximate number of waves that are periodic at a point x m away 

from the paddle. 

Considering �Q the time of first harmonic -, and second coupled harmonic -O1�5, to travel a 
distance x we have:   

�Q = �gr3	 (21) 
where gr3 is the wave group celerity calculated by means of linear wave theory: 

gr3 = 12 s1 + 223ℎjtVℎ	223ℎu L4 �-Vℎ 23ℎ (22) 
Considering �� the time of second free harmonic -P1�5 to travel the same distance x we get:  

�� = �grP (23) 
where grP is the wave group celerity of the second free harmonic calculated by means of 
linear wave theory: 

grP = 12 v1 + 22P
1�5ℎjtVℎ	22P1�5ℎw

L24 �-Vℎ 2P1�5ℎ (24) 
It can be noticed that - and -O1�5 travel faster than -P1�5 which means ��>�Q. 
The time of last wave ramp arrival to x is given by:

�� = �Q + V�7 (25) 
where	V�  is the number of wave ramps in the beginning of wave generation.  
Thus we must consider the initial time of our free surface series as the time:  

�� = �� + V�7 (26) 
Considering �o the time of last generated wave arrival at x:  
 

�o = �� + V7 + VP7 (27) 
where V is the number of generated waves and VP  is the number of ramp waves at the end of 
paddle displacement.  

Considering �x the time of first harmonic reflected by dissipation zone arrival at x:  
�x = 12y − �5gr3  (28) 

where y is the distance from the mean paddle position and the dissipation zone. Consequently 
we consider the wave time series until the instant of time �P, given by: 

�P = itVz�o, �x{ (29) 
Since we have �� and �P the zero up crossing technique was used to quantify the number of 
purely progressive periodic waves V|}. 
Step 2 – Fourier series analysis of each wave determined in step 1.  

Each of the V|} progressive wave determined in step 1 is analyzed by means of a Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT).   

Based on the principle of the FFT one data series can be described as the sum of sine waves: 

, = -Q g~j4Q� + GQ jtV4Q� + -� g~j 4�� + G� jtV4�� + ⋯ (30) 
Considering 4� = 24Q Eq. (30) can be rewritten in the form: 

, = �Q g~j14Q�	 −	�Q5 +	�� g~j124Q�	 − 	��5 + ⋯ (31) 
where amplitudes can be defined as: 

�Q = m-Q� + GQ�; 		�� = m-�� + G��;	… (32) 
and phases: 

�-V�Q = GQ-Q ; 		�-V �� = G�-� ; 	… (33)

Therefore it is possible to obtain amplitude and phase values for all the harmonics of each 

periodic regular wave that pass a wave sensor. 

Step 3 – Comparison of the spatial evolution of periodic waves.    

Once values of �Q, ��,… and �Q, ��… are obtained, as outlined in the previous step, it is 
possible to analyze their evolution along the flume comparing results of different wave 

sensors. If waves are perfectly of permanent form the amplitude of each harmonic should be 

constant along the flume. On the other hand variations of these values indicate the presence of 

free harmonics traveling with velocities different of the main and coupled harmonics. In a 

second order analysis the absence of free harmonic can be checked by the verification of the 

condition:      

2�Q − �� = 0 (34) 
4.3 Results  

For all the 37 cases the wave height generated was less than the target wave height and was 

not constant along the flume. Taking into account the mean of mean wave height along the 

flume the wave generated ranged between 0.71 and 0.93 times the desired wave height.  In 

Fig. 2 the target wave height, real generated wave height and wave height predicted by 

Madsen (1970) formula (Eq. 9) are compared. From this figure, it can be seen that Madsen 

(1970) predicts for most of the tested cases the reduction in wave height due to the leakage 

between the paddle and the walls of the flume. However, for some cases, it can be observed 

that generated wave heights are slightly greater than those predicted by Madsen (1970).  One 

reason for this difference can be due to possible wave reflection from the zone behind the 

paddle that is not taken into account in Madsen (1970) formula.   

The wave periods of generated waves in the physical wave flume matched the target wave 

periods. In Table 3 really generated wave conditions in the physical flume are summarized. In 

this case, Ursell number ranged from 0.14 to 47.68, and relative water depths from 0.06 to 

0.82 (see table 3).     

Four test cases were chosen from the 37 wave cases tested in order to be used as validation 

cases in the NWF. Table 4 summarizes the four chosen test cases and indicates wave heights 

prediction based on Madsen (1970) formulation for the four cases.    

In Fig. 3 the amplitude of the five first harmonics are presented for the 4 test cases. Each 

column of points represents values obtained at one wave sensor. Wave sensors WG6 and 

WG7 were excluded from the analysis because they are close to the dissipation zone and in 

most of the cases no periodic waves were obtained. The amplitude values presented in Fig. 3 

correspond to the mean values of all periodic waves registered at each wave sensor.

As expected it can be seen from Fig. 3 that amplitude of the harmonics is not constant along 

the flume.  The evolution of a2, a3, a4 and a5 along the flume is inverse of a1 evolution. The 

differences between the maximum and minimum value of the harmonic amplitudes registered 

along the flume increases with Ursell number (see Table 5). The value of variation of 

amplitude a2 ranges from 0.007 m (Case 6 ��=19.2) to 0.013 m (Case 37 ��=48.3).  Also the 
relative phase of the first and second harmonic is not constant along the flume and the relation 2�Q − �� = 0 is not achieved (see Fig. 4). According to Madsen (1971) and Chapalain et al. 
(1992) these variations in amplitude and phase indicate the presence of free harmonics 

traveling with velocities different of the main and coupled harmonics. As a result, different 

types of variations in the wave profile can be observed such as: the crest is sharpened and the 

trough is flattened; a secondary crest is present in the trough of the main wave; steepening of 

the wave front (see Fig. 5 and 6).   

5 Numerical simulations 

5.1 Sinusoidal Wave Generation 

Wave case 6, 3, 2 and 37 were also simulated in the NWF. To discretize the flume domain a 

grid mesh with constant nodal distance along the flume of ��=��=0.01 m was considered. 
This domain discretization leads to an initial finite elements mesh of 58862 nodes for 

simulations with 0.32 m water depth. The maximum time step used in the simulations was 

0.001 s. The numerical tests were run on a 2.67GHz Intel Core i7 CPU920. For these 

conditions, the numerical wave flume took about 139 hours to simulate 20 s of physical 

model test. Other time and mesh resolutions were tested in order to evaluate the 

computational time and the accuracy of the results along the flume. It was found that the 

accuracy of the free surface decreases substantially for nodal distances greater than 0.01 m. In 
the numerical wave flume, waves were generated as similar as possible to those generated in 

the physical flume. A numerical piston paddle moving according to the physical piston paddle 

was reproduced. This boundary condition is solved by PFEM as a solid-liquid interaction 

problem. The numerical paddle displacement was calculated applying the wave height 

reduction model proposed by Madsen (1970) in order to take into account the leakage 

between the paddle and the walls of the physical flume. Generated wave height can be 

consulted in Table 4. The passive dissipation zone at the right end of the physical flume (see 

Fig. 1) was simulated in the numerical flume through the simulation of a fluid more viscous 

than water (Oliveira et al, 2009b).  

Figures 5 and 6 plot the free surface evolution for case 3 and case 2 at four wave sensors from 

both experimental records and numerical simulations. Figure 5 indicates an excellent

agreement between the numerical results and experimental data for both wave phase and 

wave height. A good agreement can be found in Fig. 6 for case 2. The variation in the wave 

form along the flume due to the presence of free harmonics is reproduced with accuracy by 

the NWF. 

Figure 7 plots the amplitude of the first five harmonics along the NWF for wave case 6, 3, 2 

and 37. Figure 8 plots the phase of the first five harmonics along the NWF for wave case 6, 3, 

2 and 37. The evolution of the harmonics along the NWF fits quite well the experimental 

data. For cases 6 and 3 computations of free surface, amplitude and phase of harmonics are in 

perfect agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). For case 2 the wave 

generated in the NWF is slightly higher than in the experiments. Although the amplitude of 

the harmonics is slightly higher in the NWF its trend evolutions fit the physical results. For 

case 37 the amplitude of harmonics in Wave gauges WG0 and WG1 is slightly higher in the 

numerical flume.  

5.2 Second Order wave Generation 

Wave case 6, 3, 2 and 37 were simulated in the NWF using Madsen (1971) (Eq. 14) second 

order wavemaker theory to generate waves. The numerical features used in NWF were the 

same used in simulations presented in 5.1.  

Figure 9 plots the amplitude of the first five harmonics along the flume for wave case 6, 3, 2 

and 37. Figure 10 plots the phase of the first five harmonics along the flume for wave case 6, 

3, 2 and 37. 

For case 6 and case 3, both under the limits of application of Madsen (1971) theory 

(ℎ � < �10.15⁄  and �� < 26), free harmonics were practically eliminated. For these cases the 
amplitude of the first and second harmonic and wave form was kept constant along the flume. 

Although case 2 is out of the limits of application of Madsen (1971) wavemaker theory a 

good performance was obtained in the elimination of first and second free harmonics in this 

case. For wave case 37 also out of the limits of application of Madsen (1971) wavemaker 

theory the amplitude of free harmonics is highly but not totally reduced.  

5.3 Cnoidal Wave Generation 

Wave case 6, 3, 2 and 37 were simulated in the NWF using Goring (1979) wavemaker theory 

based on cnoidal wave theory (Eq. 17). The numerical features used in NWF were the same 

used in simulations presented in 5.1 and 5.2.  

Figure 11 plots the amplitude of the first five harmonics along the flume for wave case 6, 3, 2 

and 37. Figure 12 plots the phase of the first five harmonics along the flume for wave case 6,

3, 2 and 37. Figure 13 and 14 compares the free surface obtained in the NWF with sinusoidal, 

second order and cnoidal generations for case 3 and 2, respectively.  

The differences between the maximum and minimum value of the harmonic amplitudes 

obtained in the NWF with the three different wavemaker theories can be found in Table 6.  

The improvements in keeping the wave form constant along the flume using the wavemaker 

theory based on cnoidal wave theory are of the same order of magnitude of those obtained 

with second order wavemaker theory. However for the four cases simulated the performance 

of the second order wavemaker theory was better than that obtained in the cnoidal wavemaker 

theory. 

A theoretical wave case CN01 of H=0.10 m, T=3.0 s and h=0.25 m (ℎ � = 0.05⁄  and �� =136) was simulated in the NWF. For these extreme long wave conditions second order 
wavemaker theory by Madsen (1971) can’t be applied (�� < 26). If we try to obtain the 
paddle displacement with Madsen (1971) theory the amplitude of the second term of Eq. (14) 

is very high and a second crest can be detected in the obtained paddle displacement.   

Figure 15 compares the free surface obtained at four points of the NWF with the theoretical 

free surface given by cnoidal wave theory. Figure 16 shows the variation of harmonic 

amplitude and phase along the NWF. From Fig. 15 and 16 it can be observed that the wave 

keeps its form and the amplitude of the harmonics along the flume. Further, its shape agrees 

quite well with cnoidal wave theory. However, small numerical perturbations are introduced 

in the free surface at the troughs.       

5.4 Solitary Wave Generation 

A solitary wave case S01 of H=0.045 m and h=0.25 m (� ℎ = 0.18⁄ ) was simulated in the 
NWF using the solitary wave generation theory proposed by Goring (1979) (eq. 20). The 

numerical features used in NWF were the same used in simulations presented in 5.1, 5.2 and 

5.3. According to Goring (1979) for this solitary wave condition the paddle displacement is 

0.24 m, the maximum paddle velocity is 0.25 m/s and the duration time of the paddle 

displacement is 3.18 s. Figure 17 compares the free surface evolution obtained in the NWF 

with the free surface given by the Boussinesq-type solution for a solitary wave (eq. 18). From 

this figure it can be seen that, in general, the numerical wave form agrees quite well with the 

Boussinesq-type solution. However, small differences in the free surface can be noticed close 

to the wave crest. The ratio between desired and generated wave height decreases from 0.985 

to 0.971 between WG0 and WG5.

6 Conclusions 

In this paper, we describe for the first time the implementation and the validation of regular 

long wave generation in a NWF based on the PFEM. Three types of waves were generated 

based on Stokes second order wave theory, cnoidal wave theory and solitary wave theory 

through a piston type paddle boundary condition. Practically, this allows the simulation of a 

variety of intermediate and shallow water wave conditions commonly used in coastal 

hydraulic studies.  

We studied the nonlinear phenomena that occur when regular long waves are generated in a 

NWF based on the PFEM by a sinusoidal wavemaker movement. Long wave physical 

experiments based on a sinusoidal paddle movement have been conducted. We show that the 

evolution of the harmonics (coupled and free) along the NWF fits quite well the experimental 

data. Generally speaking, these results indicate that as it happens in physical flumes, a 

sinusoidal wavemaker theory is not directly suitable to generate long waves in a NWF based 

on PFEM. 

The second order wavemaker theory developed by Madsen (1971) was implemented in the 

NWF. Free harmonics were eliminated for wave cases under the limits of application of 

Madsen (1971) theory (ℎ � < �10.15⁄  and �� < 26). For a wave case ℎ � = 0.1⁄  and �� = 35.0 good performance was obtained with the elimination of the first and second free 
harmonics. However for  ℎ � = 0.06⁄  and �� = 42.6 the amplitude of free harmonics is 
reduced but not totally removed. 

The cnoidal wavemaker theory presented by Goring (1979) was implemented in the NWF. 

The improvements in keeping the desired wave form along the flume using cnoidal theory are 

of the same order of magnitude as those obtained with second order wavemaker theory (for �� ≤ 42.6). A theoretical wave case of ℎ � = 0.05⁄  and �� = 136 was simulated in the 
NWF. It was observed that the wave keeps its form and the amplitude of the harmonics along 

the flume. Further the resulting shape agrees quite well with cnoidal wave theory.  

The ability to generate solitary waves of � ℎ < 0.2⁄  was implemented in the NWF based on 
the wavemaker theory proposed by Goring (1979). For a solitary wave of � ℎ = 0.18⁄  
generated in the NWF, the wave form agrees quite well with the Boussinesq-type solution for 

a solitary wave. However, small differences were observed close to the wave crest.   

The ability of the PFEM to simulate complex solid-fluid interaction problems and fast free 

surface changes allow the implementation of wavemaker theories dealing with fast paddle 

displacements. The implementation of other wavemaker theories for the generation of solitary 

waves in the NWF is currently being carried out. This implementation is expected to provide 

a more realistic representation of high amplitude solitary waves than the Boussinesq-type 

solution implemented in this work.

For practical coastal hydraulic applications a compromise has to be made between the 

accuracy and validity field of each wavemaker theory implemented in the NWF. Further work 

should aim to implement and validate the generation of irregular waves in the NWF.
