Abstract: The characterization of future wave-storms and their relationship to large-scale climate
can provide useful information for environmental or urban planning at coastal areas. A hybrid
methodology (process-based and statistical) was used to characterize the extreme wave-climate at
the northwestern Black Sea. The Simulating WAve Nearshore spectral wave-model was employed
to produce wave-climate projections, forced with wind-fields projections for two climate change
scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. A non-stationary multivariate
statistical model was built, considering significant wave-height and peak-wave-period at the peak of
the wave-storm, as well as storm total energy and storm-duration. The climate indices of the North
Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic Pattern, and Scandinavian Pattern have been used as covariates to
link to storminess, wave-storm threshold, and wave-storm components in the statistical model. The
results show that, first, under both RCP scenarios, the mean values of significant wave-height and
peak-wave-period at the peak of the wave-storm remain fairly constant over the 21st century. Second,
the mean value of storm total energy is more markedly increasing in the RCP4.5 scenario than in the
RCP8.5 scenario. Third, the mean value of storm-duration is increasing in the RCP4.5 scenario, as
opposed to the constant trend in the RCP8.5 scenario. The variance of each wave-storm component
increases when the corresponding mean value increases under both RCP scenarios. During the 21st
century, the East Atlantic Pattern and changes in its pattern have a special influence on wave-storm
conditions. Apart from the individual characteristics of each wave-storm component, wave-storms
with both extreme energy and duration can be expected in the 21st century. The dependence between
all the wave-storm components is moderate, but grows with time and, in general, the severe emission
scenario of RCP8.5 presents less dependence between storm total energy and storm-duration and
among wave-storm components.

1. Introduction

The hydrosphere presents several types of extreme events, such as droughts [1], floods [2], and
wave-storms [3]. Coastal areas are one of the most active environments, which can lead to conflicts and
incompatibility of uses. Wave-action dynamics drives these changes, affecting infrastructure stability,
sediment dynamics, and the resilience of coastal systems [4–6]. Such variability reaches hazardous

rates under extreme wave regimes (i.e., wave-storms) [7]. Hence, wave-storm characterization can
provide useful information regarding their destructive potential.

Wave-storm characterization can be performed through two approaches: process-based [8,9]
and statistical [10,11] models. Process-based models can include complex physical phenomena, but
they can be computationally expensive. Statistical models are easier to interpret and computationally
cheaper, but they cannot reproduce local phenomena. A hybrid strategy (i.e., statistical models built
using process-based outputs as input) is a better method for both approaches, and recent works
have addressed this methodology [10,12,13]. In order to tackle multiple wave-storm components
at once, a multivariate statistical model can serve to characterize individual storm components, as
well as the dependence structure. The significant-wave-height (Hs) is the most frequently used
wave-storm component. It is usually regarded as being independent of other storm components,
such as peak-period (Tp) or storm-duration (D). However, this assumption has been questioned in
[14,15], among others. Similarly, it was discussed in Salvadori et al. [16] that univariate analyses
lead to an inaccurate estimation of marine drivers, so these cannot describe coastal processes
adequately. Fully-nested Archimedean copulas have previously been successfully applied to
characterize semi-dependence among variables [15,17], so this hypothesis was adopted in the proposed
statistical model.

The effects of wave-storms may be aggravated as a consequence of climate change [11,18,19].
Changes in extreme wave-climate add a layer of complexity, and the often-used stationary methods
are limited when addressing climate trends. Non-stationary models can better capture the variation
introduced by climate change by handling the changing trends of the storm components better [20].
Extreme value distributions of wave-storm variables can be modelled as linear or smooth functions
of covariates [21], and a generalized additive model can be used to estimate the location and scale
parameters of a generalized Pareto distribution fitted to wave-storm variables [22–24]. Indices related to
atmospheric climate patterns can serve as covariates in these regression models. Thus, the relationship
between a changing atmosphere and the wave-storms can be tackled.

Hybrid approaches that address the main wave-storm physical processes and the nature of the
storm components are suitable for managing coastal areas such as the coast of the northwestern
Black Sea. However, there is a lack of future wave projections in this area. The aim of this paper
is to characterize the extreme wave-climate at the northwestern Black Sea with a hybrid strategy,
under two climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5).
These scenarios represent an increase of the radiative forcing-values in the year 2100 relative to
pre-industrial values of 4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 [25,26], respectively. Wave projections were obtained from
a process-based model (Simulating WAves Nearshore, SWAN). SWAN outputs have served to build
a multivariate non-stationary statistical model that characterizes the probability distributions and
the joint probability structure of the wave-storm variables. It also relates these variables to climate
indices. This characterization can help to assess the level of change in wave-storm characteristics
under the effects of climate change. The wave-storms under the two proposed emission scenarios
are compared to each other. Once the relationship between wave-storm components and climate
indices is determined, a set of different Global Circulation Models are used in order to bound their
own uncertainty. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the study-area and its climate.
Section 3 states the methodology to project and to build the hybrid framework. Results are listed in
Section 4, discussed in Section 5, and concluded in Section 6.

2. Study Area

The Black Sea is a fetch-limited, wave-dominated, and micro-tidal basin (see Figure 1), located
between 41.0 and 46.0◦N and 27.0 and 42.0◦E [27]. In fetch-limited basins, waves do not have enough
length of fetch to reach the fully arisen sea condition, and fetch-limited sea states are generated. In these
situations, there may be two effects: (i) for a fixed wind-speed, the maximum significant wave-height
is limited by the fetch-length; (ii) the time-duration of swell-waves may be shorter than in non-limited



Water 2018, 10, 221 3 of 28

fetch condition. A micro-tidal basin has a small tidal range, on the order of decimetres. Hence, the sea
variability depends on wind and waves, partly contributed by the Danube river and to a lesser degree
by the Mediterranean Sea. The Black Sea is connected to the Mediterranean Sea through the Sea of
Marmara and the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits to the southwest, and to the Sea of Azov through
the Kerch Strait on the opposite side. The greater part of the Black Sea is a basin with a relatively flat
bottom relief and depths exceeding 2000 m. However, its western shelf slope is considerably gentle.
The proposed non-stationary statistical model is built at the northwestern area, where 34 nodes are
used (see Figure 1).

The general large-scale atmospheric circulation over the Black Sea is influenced by the
configuration of the Azores and Siberian high-pressure areas and the Asian low-pressure area.
Additionally, a great part of the Black Sea’s coast is surrounded by mountains, which are the Balkans,
the Pontic, the Caucasus, and the Crimean mountains. This feature generates specific wind patterns
in the inner shelf-area. Local winds such as sea breezes, mountain-valley circulation, and slope
winds also have a considerable impact on the atmospheric circulation pattern of the study-area [28].
The most remarkable feature of wind and wave-climate in the northwestern Black Sea is their seasonal
variability [4].

(SWAN) model is enclosed by a green rectangle (see first step of the proposed methodology), whereas

A wave-storm year is a year-long period of intense wave-storm activity, which ranges in the
present approach from July of the previous year to June of the next year. During a wave-storm
year, the most relevant pattern is determined by the relative position, displacement, and resulting
interactions between the Mediterranean cyclones and the Eastern European (Siberian) anticyclone.
The most intense and frequent winds affecting the coast are those from the northeast, east and
southeast. They have the longest fetch and produce the most severe wave-storms. However, as this is
a fetch-limited environment, little energy is absorbed from the wind forcing, and wave-periods tend to
be shorter than in large water bodies such as the Atlantic Ocean.

The average significant wave-height at deep waters in the northwestern Black Sea range
between a minimum of 0.35 m in spring (March–May) to a maximum of 0.75 m in winter (from
December–February) [28]. The average peak wave-period ranges from 1.8 s in spring to 2.4 s in
winter. Due to the influence of the wind pattern, waves propagate most frequently from the east,
northeast and southeast [30]. Eastern waves are predominant within the entire shelf zone (see Figure 1).
Their directional sector frequency ranges between 30% and 40%. The fraction of northeastern waves
has a frequency of 30% and the frequency of southeastern waves is over 10% [4]. The most energetic
months are December to February [28,31]. Winter wave-storms are much more frequent than summer
ones [4]. The average wave-storm duration between 1980 and 1993 was 30 h, whereas the maximum
wave-storm duration was about 130 h. The most energetic wave directions were northerly, whereas
the average wave-heights during wave-storms were 1.5–4.5 m.

3. Methods

The proposed hybrid methodology (See Figure 2) consists of four stages: (i) Wave-projections at
the Black Sea generated with a process-based model; (ii) set-up of a multivariate non-stationary
statistical model; (iii) validation of the non-stationary statistical model; (iv) comparison of the
obtained wave-storm components with those derived from other general circulation models. The same
methodology was applied for each climate change scenario (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5).

3.1. First Step: Process-Based Dynamical Modelling

The temporal coverage in this study spans from 1950 to 2100. Two climate change scenarios
were considered in this study: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. A general circulation model (GCM),
with a basis in climate-assessment studies [32–34], provides the general circulation of the Earth’s
atmosphere. Although the spatial coverage is global, the grid size is too coarse for modelling wave
forcings (i.e. wind-fields) at a relatively small basin such as the Black Sea. In this case, spatial and
temporal resolution (plus the addition of physical processes that need to be considered at a regional
scale) can be downscaled with a regional circulation model (RCM).

The process to build the projections starts by dynamical downscaling of the CRNM-CM5 GCM
(see Figure 2), through the ALADIN 5.2 RCM [35–37], and then projecting ocean-waves with the SWAN
model. ALADIN 5.2 is a bi-spectral RCM that uses a double Fourier representation for spectral fields.
It uses a semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian advection scheme. The main parameterizations employed are:
a mass-flux scheme with convergence of humidity closure for the convection [38]; the statistical cloud
scheme by [39]; and the large-scale precipitation scheme by [40]. The RCM lateral boundary conditions
were obtained from the CRNM-CM5 GCM outputs.

RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 wind-fields from the ALADIN model were downloaded from the
Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative [41]. Wind
fields coincided for both RCP scenarios at the 1950–2005 period (historical time slice), whereas the fields
for the future period (2005–2100) differed at each RCP. These wind fields span the whole of Europe
with a spatial and temporal resolution of 12 km×12 km and 3 h, respectively. This spatio-temporal
resolution for the wave forcings follows the state-of-the-art in future wave climate projections [42–44].

These winds serve as input for the SWAN spectral wave-model [45]. The computational domain
spans the whole Black Sea with a regular grid of 9 km×9 km (see the domain marked with a green
solid line in Figure 1). The bathymetry comes from the GEBCO dataset (GEB-2008), which has
a spatial resolution of approximately one arc-minute. The spatial resolution taken can reproduce
the wave generation and the deep-water wave propagation phenomena in the study area. Hence,
wind wave-growth, quadruplet interaction, whitecapping dissipation, and bottom friction terms are
activated, whereas triad interaction and wave breaking are deactivated.

The SWAN model was run in a non-stationary mode with a time-step of 20 min for the whole
1950–2100 period. Wind fields are updated every 3 h with a spatial resolution of 12 km×12 km. Wave
outputs are saved hourly at a subset of computational nodes. These outputs mainly consist of time
series of integrated wave-spectra parameters: significant wave-height, peak and mean wave-period,
wave-direction, among others. Once these time-series are obtained , the second stage of the proposed
hybrid methodology is applied at the 34 selected nodes of the northwestern Black Sea (see Figure 1).

The second stage in the proposed methodology (see the next section) consists of fitting a
non-stationary multivariate model that has as response variables a set of storm components that
use large-scale climate indices as predictors (covariates). These storm components come from the
SWAN time series obtained in this first step.

3.2. Second Step: The Statistical Model

3.2.1. Definition of Wave-Storms and Their Components

The second stage in the proposed analysis deals with the construction of a multivariate
non-stationary statistical model. This model assesses the changes in the wave-storm components
during 1950–2100 in the northwestern Black Sea (see Figure 1). Although models have long been
built considering stationarity, there is a series of drawbacks with this approach. Extreme events are
rare, and in the cases where several time-windows were considered (e.g., a window of less than
15 years), samples of high extreme events in each time window would not be statistically significant.
Consequently, the estimated upper tail of the probability distribution function would not yield reliable
results. Further, climate change has a non-negligible effect on extremes, threatening the foundations of
assumptions such as stationary wave-storm thresholds. A non-stationary model can overcome these
shortcomings because it can include the effects of climate change on extreme wave-climate.

The sample of wave-storms were extracted from the projections (see Figure 2) by splitting the
projections into mean sea-conditions and extremal conditions by means of a wave-storm threshold (see
Figure 3a). As a preliminary analysis, a model considering stationarity in time-windows of 50 years
was built separately, in order to obtain an initial approximation for the parameters of the non-stationary
statistical model built here. Wave-height thresholds in the stationary model were h0,RCP4.5 = 1.8 m
for RCP4.5 and 2.0 m = h0,RCP8.5 for RCP8.5, which are the corresponding 90th quantile [46] at node
19. Wave-storms in the sample are independent. An independent wave-storm is defined as having
a minimum duration of 6 h and a minimum time-interval between wave-storms of 72 h [11]. A
sensitivity analysis on the minimum time-interval was carried out, testing for two possible minimum
time-intervals: the proposed one and 12 h.

The storm-threshold is obtained through vectorial generalized additive models (VGAMs, [47,48]),
using climate indices as covariates. All the nodes use the same climate index as covariate for a given
RCP scenario, following the principle of parsimony. The covariates of a VGAM are predictors, whereas
the predictand is the wave-storm threshold. VGAM presents the linear function [49]:

ηi(j) = β1(j) + f2(j) (xi2) + . . . + fp(j)
(
xip
)

, (1)

where ηi(j) is the jth dependent variable, xi is the ith independent variable that generates ηi. ηi is
a sum of smooth functions of the individual covariates. Additive models do all smoothing in IR,

avoiding large bias introduced in defining areas in IRn. The assumptions for regression models are:
(1) independence of residuals; (2) residuals follow a Gaussian distribution of the form N

(
0, σ2

)
;

and (3) residuals are homoscedastic. Assumption (1) is tested with an autocorrelation function plot [50].
Assumption (2) can be tackled with a Q-Q plot comparing the empirical distribution of the residuals
to a N

distribution, where the sample standard deviation is used as σ2. Assumption (3) can

simply be visually analysed through a scatter-plot of the fitted values vs. the residuals.

(HAC)-structure-tree at node 13, in the period 2001–2050, under the RCP4.5 scenario. The circles
contain the names of the storm components, which are bound together by a dependence-parameter,
written in the rectangles (θ ∈ [0, ∞)). This HAC-structure-tree comes from the stationary statistical
model. It is representative of all nodes, at each time-window of 50 years and in both emission scenarios.
Then, it is selected to represent the dependence-structure of the whole non-stationary statistical model.

The VGAM of the statistical model built in this paper uses as covariates the climate indices in
the GCMs that represent the large-scale climate patterns of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
the Eastern Atlantic Pattern (EA) and the Scandinavian Pattern (SC) [11,51]. The first and second
time-derivatives of these climate indices are employed as well. This adoption of climate indices as
covariates was previously discussed in [11]. These large-scale indices can be derived from monthly
sea-level pressure-fields that can be downloaded from the CMIP5 Project’s website. They have been
scaled to have a mean value equal to zero and a variance equal to unity. In order to avoid sudden
oscillations that would hinder interpretation, they have been filtered with a second-order low-pass
Butterworth filter [52], whose low-pass period was 10 years. The Akaike information criterion [53] and
the Bayesian information criterion [54] are applied on the VGAM to test the sensitivity of the wave
storm threshold to each climate index.

Storms are clustered by storm-years (referred to hereafter as “years”). Storminess can be
estimated by approximating its relationship with the selected climate index and time derivatives
by a Poisson probability distribution function. As it is a counting variable, a vectorial generalized
linear model (VGLM, a particular case of VGAM [47]) can be adopted. A storm-threshold is estimated
by approximating its relationship with the climate index by a Laplace function. The Akaike information
criterion and the Bayesian information criterion can also be applied to the VGLM to test the sensitivity
of storminess to each climate index. The averaged value of the regression coefficient of the VGAM at
nodes 13 and 29 (Cr) is used to quantify the influence of the climate index chosen. Cr is the coefficient
that multiplies the predictor xi2 in the function f2,(i) (xi2) = Cr · xi2 from Equation (1), the predictor



Water 2018, 10, 221 8 of 28

being a climate index. Cr is back-transformed from its logarithmic form to its natural form in Sections
4 and 5 (“Results” and “Discussion”) for ease of understanding. If Equation (1) was rewritten as

ηi(j) ≈ β1(j) + Cr · xi2,

for xi2 6= 0, both sides of the equation could be divided by xi2 and become

ηi(j)/xi2 ≈ β1(j)/xi2 + Cr.

The presence of xi2 close to zero—which would make such division an indetermination—can be
avoided by translating xi2 from the interval (−2, 2] to the interval (0, 4]. Therefore, the two terms on
the right side—β1(j)/xi2 and Cr—could be comparable. β1(j)/xi2 can be herein defined as the ratio
between the wave-storm threshold and the climate index. This ratio is approximated by the mean of
the natural value of the wave-storm threshold divided by double the maximum climate index value.

The wave-storms are represented by the following storm components: storm-energy (E),
significant wave-height and peak-wave-period at the peak of wave-storm (Hp and Tp, respectively),
and storm-duration (D). The definition of E is

E =
1
D

∫ t f
ti

H2s (t) dt, (2)

where ti and t f are the starting and ending time of a wave-storm. The inclusion of E and D are thought
to provide more information on the general behaviour of a wave-storm, whereas Hp and Tp represent
upper limit wave conditions of a wave-storm. E, Hp, Tp, and D take positive real values. Consequently,
they are log-transformed to avoid scale effects when building the statistical models [55], but are still
referred to as E, Hp, Tp, and D in the interpretation of the models, for ease of understanding. The
mean wave-storm wave-directions have also been extracted for a complementary side analysis, which
serves to describe the evolution of wave directionality in 1950–2100.

3.2.2. Generalized Pareto Distribution: Univariate Distribution-Function

Storm-thresholds from the stationary statistical model are used as starting values to iterate
for non-stationary location parameters x0 of Hp. The starting value for a non-stationary location
parameter x0 of Tp is 5.8 s for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The starting value for the
non-stationary location parameter x0 of D is defined as the minimum storm duration (6 h) and the
starting value of the non-stationary location parameter x0 of E is E0,RCP4.5 = h20,RCP4.5· 6 = 19.4 m

2/h
(E0,RCP8.5 = 24.0 m2/h). All these starting values for non-stationary location parameters x0 fall on the
linear part of corresponding excess-over-threshold functions, so their probability distributions can be
modelled by generalized Pareto distributions (GPDs, [11,14,55,56]).

The definition of a GPD is as follows. Y = X− x0 is the excess of a magnitude X over a location
parameter x0, conditioned to X > x0, the support of Y is

[
0 , ysup

]
, where ysup is the upper bound of y,

if it exists [57]. The GPD cumulative function is

FY (y|β, ξ) = 1−
(

1 +
ξ

β
y
)− 1

ξ

, 0 ≤ y ≤ ysup, (3)

where β ≥ 0 is the scale parameter and ξ ∈ IR is the shape parameter. Given the location parameter x0
and the scale parameter β, the mean value of a wave-storm component is given by:

E (X) = x0 +
β

1− ξ
≈ x0, ξ < 1, (4)



Water 2018, 10, 221 9 of 28

and the variance of a wave-storm component is:

Var (X) =
β2

(1− ξ)2 (1− 2ξ)
≈ β2, ξ <

1
2

, (5)

where the parameters are the same ones as in Equation (3). Therefore, the location parameter x0 and
the scale parameter β provide information on the mean value and the variance, respectively.

A quantile regression—a particular type of VGAM [58,59]—is selected to estimate the location
parameters x0 of the GPD in the non-stationary statistical model. It estimates the 100τ̂% conditional
quantile yτ̂ (x) of a response variable Y as a function u (x, τ) of covariates x. l∗u = lu + $uRu is
minimized, where lu = τ̂ ∑

i:ri≥0
|ri| (1− τ̂) ∑

i:ri<0
|ri| for residuals ri = yi − u (xi, τ̂). $ is a roughness

coefficient that controls the trade-off between quality of fit to the data and roughness of the regression
function. R is a roughness penalty [60,61]. As a side analysis, a VGAM that uses time as the single
covariate helps visualize the non-stationarity of the projected location parameters x0.

An assumption in this paper for the non-stationary GPDs is that the shape-parameter ξ remains
constant, while the scale parameter β can depend on co-variates. β is estimated through a VGLM.
The sensitivity of the GPD parameters to the proposed climate indices and time-derivatives is tested by
applying the same Akaike and Bayesian information criterion on the VGAM or VGLM. The averaged
value of the regression parameters of the VGLM and the quantile regression at nodes 13 and 29, Cr,
is used again to quantify the influence of the predominant climate index. It is compared to the ratio
between the wave-storm component and the climate index.

3.2.3. Copulas: The Joint-Dependence Structure

Wave-storm components are semi-dependent, according to graphical dependence-tests (not
shown). Because of this semi-dependence, the non-stationary joint-dependence-structure of the storm
components may be parametrized by hierarchical Archimedean copulas (HACs, [62]). A copula is a
multivariate distribution function with standard univariate margins [63–65]. A d-dimensional copula
is Archimedean [66] if it is of the form

C (F; φ) = φ−1 (φ (F1) + · · ·+ φ (Fd)) , F ∈ [0, 1]

A HAC can be a useful tool to nest simple Archimedean copulas into larger and more complex ones
(see Figure 3b). A HAC provides a dependence parameter, θ, at each nesting level. θ can be transformed
into other correlation parameters, such as Kendall’s τ [66–68], the interpretation of which is more
straightforward: τ = 0 indicates independence, whereas τ → 1 means total dependence. This τ should
not be mistaken by the τ̂ in Section 3.2.2.

To model the non-stationary dependence, the storm components are clustered into periods of
15 years, in order to compute the dependence parameters for each block and node. This creates a
pseudo-non-stationary HAC [11] per node. The clusters are of the size 15 years, because a smaller size
would provide an insufficient number of wave-storms to characterize the joint probability structure.
On the other hand, the smaller the blocks, the more non-stationary the HAC would be. Therefore,
15 years is the optimum number in the trade-off between the lack of wave-storms for fitting and the
maximum size of the blocks. Additionally, each time-window overlaps with the previous and the later
time-window, in order to reflect the non-stationarity.

The HAC type and structure have been suggested by the stationary model built apart. The HAC
tree in Figure 3b—which is a Gumbel-type HAC—represents the HACs used in all computational nodes
and for both RCPs in the non-stationary statistical model. Wave-storms typically produce extreme
values for several storm components (i.e., Hp and E) at the same time. If extremal dependence [69,70]
among the storm components is evident, Gumbel-type Archimedean copulas can include such
upper-tail dependence [15,17], as discussed previously in [14] and [11]. The HAC can be tested
by a goodness-of-fit test in the stationary statistical model [71]. The κ2 statistic [72] can serve to
quantify this goodness-of-fit. κ2 takes values in the interval [0, 1], where a perfect fit corresponds
to κ2 = 1. The Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test [73] is applied on the dependence
parameters of the pseudo-non-stationary HACs to confirm that these are non-stationary. The p-value
in a KPSS test gives the level of significance at which the null test (the necessity of a non-stationary
model to characterize the HAC parameters) cannot be rejected.

3.3. Third Step: Validation of the Non-Stationary Statistical Model

The data used to validate the statistical model in both emission scenarios is the ERA-interim
reanalysis [43,74–77]. "ERA" stands for "European Reanalysis". This global reanalysis, despite having
a spatial resolution of 80 km, presents gapless, bias corrected information from 1979 to present day.
The ERA-interim data available for the northwestern Black Sea is at 43.5◦N, 31.5◦E. The nearest
node from the wave-model is node number 19, at 44.8◦N, 30.0◦E (see Figure 1). Node 19 is central
to the northwestern Black Sea, and is thus considered to be able to represent the study area. The
validation period is 1979–2016, which is shorter than the 1950–2100 (control period) of the wave-climate
projections. Therefore, it is only intended to validate the years 1979–2016.

ERA-interim (validation) wave-storms are extracted by using the same non-stationary thresholds
as the projections. The ERA-interim wave-storms do not coincide in timing with the projected
wave-storms, as the latter reflect a climate signal and do not put emphasis on the prediction of the exact
timing. With this in mind, [11] proposed a method to estimate the likelihood of the projected probability
density function to the probability density function of measurements. The Hp of ERA-interim data is:{

Hp,1, . . . , Hp,i, . . . , Hp,n
}

, i = 1÷ n, n ∈ IR,

and the Hp of the model data (written as H∗p , here){
H∗p,1, . . . , H

∗
p,j, . . . , H

∗
p,m

}
, j = 1÷ n, m ∈ IR.

Hp from both sources are combined to form a joint dataset:{
Hp,1, . . . , Hp,i, . . . , Hp,n, H

∗
p,1, . . . , H

∗
p,j, . . . , H

∗
p,m

}
.

Such a set is partitioned into ten intervals, separated by the quantiles that are multiples of 10. There
are elements from both ERA-interim Hp and the projections in each interval. The probability of falling
into each one of these intervals must be similar for the model and the reanalysis, so that the model can
be validated.

Two vectors are defined as

vecobs,k =
qk+1

∑
qk

(

)

and

∑
qk

p
(

H∗p,j
)

, k = 1, . . . , 11,



Water 2018, 10, 221 11 of 28

where vecobs is the vector for ERA-interim reanalyses and vecmodel is the one for projections. vecobs and
vecmodel are compositional data, their elements being parts of a whole [78] and can be defined in the
Aitchison space [79,80]. The distance between these two vectors can be measured with an Aitchison
distance [81,82],

d (x, y) =
∣∣∣∣ln x (1− y)y (1− x)

∣∣∣∣ , x, y ∈ (0, 1) ∈ IR, (6)
where x and y are vecobs and vecmodel , respectively, in this case. Another measure is the Kullback–Leibler
divergence [83]:

DKL (P ‖ Q) = ∑
i

P (i) log
P (i)
Q (i)

. (7)

This function measures the extra entropy of the probability distribution Q of the model, with
respect to the probability distribution P of the observations. Note that for any i, Q (i) = 0 must
imply P (i) = 0, to avoid indetermination, thus ensuring that the model considers all the values that
the observations show. Additionally, whenever P (i) = 0, the contribution of the i-th term is null,
as lim

x→0
x log (x) = 0. Both Equations (6) and (7) are measures, and thus take values in IR+0 . The module

of a vector is a particular case of both measures [78], and thus both measures can be compared to the
vectorial modules, in Euclidean space, of x and y, which are of order 1.

3.4. Fourth Step: Comparison of the Different GCMs

The non-stationary statistical model built in the second step uses large-scale climate indices
derived from GCM outputs (pressure-fields at sea-level). The SWAN projections (first step) were built
from MedCORDEX ALADIN wind-fields. These wind-fields result from a dynamical downscaling of
the CNRM-CM5 GCM. Hence, to put it clearly, the fitting of the statistical model (second step) consists
of using CNRM-CM5 projections of large-scale climate indices as predictors to estimate probability
distribution functions of the wave-storm components (response variables) derived from the SWAN
time-series.

One of the main advantages of the proposed statistical model is that it can predict how
the probability-distribution-functions of the storm components would vary if other projections of
large-scale climate indices were used as input. The first step of the proposed methodology requires a
computational cost that hampers the simulation of waves with different GCMs wind forcings. The
proposed statistical model can partly alleviate this computational burden via the establishment of
relationships between storm-wave components and climate indices. However, there is significant
uncertainty in climate change projections, and it is required to consider the results from several GCMs
prior to extracting conclusions. In this regard, a comprehensive list of GCMs that address climate
change scenarios can be found at the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, [84])
Project site. The GCMs in Table 1—other than CNRM-CM5—have been employed to compare how
much they can differ from this GCM in extreme wave-climates at the Northwestern Black Sea. Note that
most of these models are centred on the European continent, except the MIROC branch (MIROC-ESM,
MIROC-ESM-CHEM and MIROC5), which focuses on the area of the Japanese Isles [85], and the GFDL
branch (GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M), which focuses on the United States [86].

The comparison of different GCMs can be carried out by contrasting the 99 th quantiles of
the storm components projected with the CNRM-CM5 GCM to the 99 th quantiles of the storm
components projected with other GCMs (see Table 1). Partial autocorrelation Function (PACF, [87])
based distances are used as a metric [87]. It measures the distance among time-series based on
the corresponding PACF, and is a model-free approach. That is, the two time-series compared—Xa
and Yb—do not have to belong to specific time-series models. The PACF coefficient measures the
correlation of pairs of elements from each time series at all shorter time lags (i.e., the relationship
between two points at one hour apart, two hours apart, and so on). Let ρ̂XT =

(
ρ̂1,XT , . . . , ρ̂L,XT

)T

and ρ̂YT =
(
ρ̂1,YT , . . . , ρ̂L,YT

)T
be the estimated autocorrelation vectors of XT and YT , respectively, for

some L such that ρ̂i,XT ≈ 0 and ρ̂i,YT ≈ 0 for i > L. Then, an autocorrelation distance is defined as

dACF (XT , YT) =
√(

ρ̂XT − ρ̂YT
)T

Ω
(
ρ̂XT − ρ̂YT

)
, where Ω is a matrix of weights of value ≤ 1, and

0 ≤ dACF (XT , YT) ≤ 2, where 0 corresponds to total coincidence, and 2 to total discordance.

4. Results

This section is organized as follows. For both emission scenarios, it addresses: (a) a sensitivity
test on the time-interval between wave-storms; (b) the evolution of wave directionality in 1950–2100;
and (c) a test of the assumptions of the VGAM. For each emission scenario, it addresses: (i) bounding
of the uncertainty of the GCM; (ii) value of wave-storminess and its relationship to the selected climate
indices; (iii) values of location parameters x0 of GPDs and their relationship to the selected climate
indices; (iv) values of scale parameters β of GPDs and their relationship to the selected climate indices;
(v) values of the parameters in the dependence structure; and (vi) validation of the non-stationary
statistical model.

A sensitivity analysis on the minimum time-interval between storms equal to 12 h provides
a storminess of approximately 50 storms/year at some nodes, in both RCP scenarios, which is
unrealistic. Therefore, a minimum time-interval between storms equal to 72 h is used. The wave-storm
mean wave-directions for the whole area of study and in both RCP scenarios are the same ones as
in historical records (see Figure 1). They stay the same over the period of study. Therefore, the
wave-directionality can be considered stationary, and emphasis can be put only on the wave-storm
components E, Hp, Tp, and D. Neither independence nor normality assumptions of the residuals of
the data used in the VGAM can be rejected. Therefore, jointly with the compliance of the wave-storm
thresholds with the mean-excess plots (see Section 3), the wave-storm components can be modelled by
non-stationary GPDs.

4.1. RCP4.5

The GCMs coincide mainly at wave-storm components E and D, with PACF based distances
below 0.1. In the case of Hp and Tp, however, the maximum PACF-based distance can be 0.3 and
0.2, respectively. The GCMs presenting the largest PACF-based distance in the case of Hp and Tp can
come from any of the branches of GCMs in Table 1. Employing the CNRM-CM5 GCM, and assuming
non-stationarity, the estimated average number of wave-storms per year ranges from 27 storms/year
at node 1 to 35 storms/year at node 29, then decreases to 34 at node 33. Although SC is the most
influential climate index on storminess, the estimated number of storms per year is affected by neither
time nor climate indices. The storm-threshold is most sensitive to a combination of the first and the
second time-derivatives of SC.

The location parameters x0 of the GPD under RCP4.5 are shown in Figure 4. A selection of nine
out of thirty-four nodes are represented. There is an upward trend of the location parameter x0 of
E and D, while the location parameter x0 of Hp and Tp has a constant value. The averaged value
(in natural values) at nodes 13 and 29 of the mean of E, Hp, Tp, and D are 144.2 m2/h, 2.7 m, 6.6 s, and
33.0 h. The assumption in Equation (4) is fulfilled, because the shape parameter ξ is negative. The most
influential covariates on the GPD location parameter x0 are EA for E (Cr = 1.02) and D (Cr = 1.02),
the first time-derivative of NAO for Hp (Cr = −1.03) and SC for Tp (Cr − 1.01). The ratio between the
wave-storm component and the climate index is 35 in the case of E and of the order of magnitude of 1
in the rest of the wave-storm components.

The temporal evolution of the scale parameter β is shown in Figure 5, where the trend of the
location parameters x0 are reflected in the scale parameters β. The averaged value at nodes 13 and 29
of the variance of E, Hp, Tp, and D are 8.4 m2/h, 1.1 m, 1.0 s and 7.6 h. The assumption in Equation (5)
is fulfilled, as the shape parameter ξ is negative. The most influential covariates on the GPD scale
parameters β are the second time-derivative of SC for E (Cr = 1.17), EA for Hp (Cr = −1.00), and D
(Cr = 1.01), and the first time-derivative of EA for Tp (Cr = −1.42). The ratio between the wave-storm
component and the climate index is approximately 80 in the case of E; and approximately of the order
1 in the rest of the wave-storm components. These trends and relationships to the selected climate
indices will be further discussed in Section 5.

The Gumbel-type HAC is suitable for the proposed statistical model under RCP4.5. It has
significantly good graphical fit between empirical and theoretical HAC, while κ2 is over 0.90 at each
level of the HAC. The stationarity of the τs cannot be rejected, because the p-value from the test is 1.0%.
This proves that the HACs used in the proposed models are indeed non-stationary. The dependence
among variables, reflected by Kendall’s τ, is shown in Figure 6. τroot ranges between 0.55 and 0.65, and
has a positive trend at all nodes. τ(E,D) ranges between 0.82 and 0.87, and apparently presents cyclical
fluctuations. The test of the assumptions for VGAM shows conformity for the non-stationary threshold
of the ERA-interim data, which serves to validate projections in both RCP scenarios. The non-stationary
statistical model is validated for 1979–2016, as both types of measures (Equations 6 and 7) are invariably
below 1.0.

for (a) and (b).

4.2. RCP8.5

PACF-based distances for E and D from different GCMs are below 0.1, except for models GFDL,
MIROC, and MPI, which present higher distances in the case of E. In the case of Hp, the maximum
PACF-based distance is 0.2, except for GFDL, IPSL, and MIROC GCMs. Tp is the least coincident
wave-storm component among the GCMs, with maximum PACF-based distance equal to 0.6 for the
IPSL and MIROC branches of the GCMs, whereas the second maximum PACF-based distance is
0.4 for the CMCC branch. Employing the CNRM-CM5 GCM, and assuming non-stationarity, the
estimated average number of wave-storms per year range from the 23 storms/year at node 1 to the
30–32 storms/year at nodes 24–34. Additionally, although NAO is the most influential climate index
on storminess, the estimated number of storms per year is not significantly affected by time nor climate
index. The wave-storm threshold is mostly influenced by the second time-derivative of EA.

The temporal evolution of the location parameters x0 is shown in Figure 7. The trends of the
location parameters x0 of H0, Tp, and D are constant. The location parameter x0 of E, however, does
not have a clear trend. The averaged value at nodes 13 and 29 of the mean of E, Hp, Tp, and D
are 149.1 m2/h, 2.9 m, 6.8 s, and 28.4 h. The assumption in Equation (4) is fulfilled, as the shape
parameter ξ is negative. The most influential covariates on the GPD location parameter x0 are EA for E
(Cr = −1.00), the second time-derivative of EA for Hp (Cr = −1.32) and D (Cr = 1.40), and NAO for
Tp (Cr = 1.00). The ratio between the wave-storm component and the climate index is approximately
50 in the case of E, 13 in the case of Hp, 1 in the case of Tp, and 140 in the case of D.

13 and 29 of the variance of E, Hp, Tp, and D are 6.4 m2/h, 1.1 m, 1.0 s, and 5.5 h. The assumption
in Equation (5) is fulfilled, as the shape parameter ξ is negative. The most influential covariates
on the GPD scale parameter β are the second time-derivative of EA for E (Cr = −1.23), SC for Hp
(Cr = −1.03), EA for Tp (Cr = 1.04), and the first time-derivative of SC for D (Cr = 1.05). The ratio
between the wave-storm component and the climate index is approximately 800 in the case of E, 1 in
the case of Hp and Tp, and 35 in the case of D.

Figure 8. Scale parameter β of the GPD that models (a) E, (b) Hp, (c) Tp, and (d) D at selected nodes,
under the RCP8.5 scenario. The SC was used in the VGAM to predict the scale parameter β of Hp. The
EA was used in the VGAM to predict the scale parameter β Tp. The first time-derivative of SC was
used in the VGAM to predict the scale parameter β of D. The scale parameter β of E is not affected by
the selected climate indices. The time series are approximated by a straight line, which helps to see the
trend of the scale parameter β at each case.

The Gumbel-type HAC is suitable for the proposed statistical model under RCP8.5. It has
significantly good graphical fit between empirical and theoretical HAC, while κ2 is over 0.90 at each
level of the HAC. The null hypothesis of stationarity of the θs cannot be rejected in 1.0% of the
cases, in each HAC, according to the KPSS test. Therefore, the use of pseudo-non-stationary HACs is
suitable. The values of Kendall’s τ are shown in Figure 9. τroot ranges between 0.45 and 0.65, and has a
positive trend at all nodes. τ(E,D) ranges between 0.82 and 0.86, and presents cyclical fluctuations. The
non-stationary statistical model is validated for 1979–2016, as both the Aitchison and Kullback–Leibler
measures (Equations 6 and 7) are below 1.0.

5. Discussion

This section is organized as follows. For both emission scenarios, it addresses: (a) the
process-based modelling chain; and (b) a comparison of the stationary and the non-stationary approach
to the statistical model. For each emission scenario, it addresses: (i) bounding of the uncertainty of
the GCM; (ii) value of wave-storminess and its relationship to the selected climate indices; (iii) values
of location parameters x0 of GPDs and their relationship to the selected climate indices; (iv) values
of scale parameters β of GPDs and their relationship to the selected climate indices; and (v) values
of the parameters in the dependence structure. As a final remark, the applicability of this research is
envisaged for both emission scenarios.

Present and future wave conditions under two climate change projections (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)
were modelled with SWAN in the Black Sea, providing possibly the first future extreme wave climate
projections in the area. These wave projections are a gapless dataset of long temporal coverage (from
1950 to 2100). Their spatial resolution is enough to represent the main wave generation and propagation
phenomena, with an affordable computational cost. Their generation required a computational time
of two and a half months, using two four-core workstations. For the control period, the results agree
with former works at the Black Sea [4,28,31]. Additionally, the model validation shows that the SWAN
outputs agree with the ERA-interim reanalysis for 1979–2016.

Similar agreement between the ALADIN52-RCM and ERA-INTERIM atmospheric fields has been
reported in the state-of-the-art [41,88–90]. Additionally, the performance of the GCM-RCM modelling
chain (CNRM-CM5 and ALADIN) has recently been compared with other pairs of GCM and RCM,
under the same RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. For example, changes in Mistral and Tramontane wind
patterns in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea have been analysed by [89] for the same time interval
as this study. Their results noted that there would be fewer Tramontane events under the RCP8.5
scenario than those under the RCP4.5. However, small frequency changes were found for the Mistral
at both RCPs. On the other hand, [90] estimated an increase in extreme precipitation event intensity
for the Lez, Aude (France), and Muga (Spain) basins. These works reinforce the usefulness of the
CNRM-CM5 GCM-RCM dataset for assessing changes in extreme weather.

Apart from the main non-stationary statistical model, the stationary statistical model in the side
analysis provides its own GPD estimation. The parameters of the GPD of the stationary statistical model
are similar to the parameters of the GPD of the non-stationary statistical one in this study. Therefore,



Water 2018, 10, 221 20 of 28

this assures that the initial values for the parameters of the GPD of the non-stationary statistical model
should be maintained. The mean values and the variances from the GPD (see Equations 4 and 5) in both
RCP scenarios coincide in order of magnitude with the statistics of the input wave-storm components.
Then, the GPDs reflect the characterized wave-storm components correctly. Additionally, in agreement
with Equations (4) and (5), parameters of the non-stationary GPDs can represent mean values and
variances of wave-storm components. The Gumbel-type HAC structure from the stationary statistical
model proves suitable according to the related goodness-of-fit test. Another important advantage is
that the non-stationary statistical model characterized the SWAN data without having to cluster the
wave-storms into time-windows. A clustering would certainly lead to excessively dependent results in
the chosen time-window. Below, the outcomes of the non-stationary statistical model for each emission
scenario are discussed in detail (see a summary in Table 2).

5.1. RCP4.5

The CNRM-CM5 GCM provides similar E and D to the rest of the GCMs. However, the selection
of this model affects the outcomes in Hp and Tp. As the maximum discordance between GCMs
corresponds to a PACF-based distance of 2, a distance of 0.3 is still relatively small. However,
an explanation for this production of different Hp and Tp might be that some GCMs, like the ones
from the MIROC branch (MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM and MIROC5) and the GFDL branch
(GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M), are centred on areas away from the European Continent.

The number of storms in the area should range between 15 and 20 [31]. An estimated average
of 27 storms/year might be due to the fact that a non-stationary threshold was significantly lower at
some points than the initial values, so more events were qualified as extreme. However, the minimum
time-interval between storms chosen (72 h) has helped prevent the consideration of replicating storms
as independent ones, thus reducing the modelled storminess to a reasonable quantity. There is a
relatively higher storminess at nodes 17–34 (see Figure 1) compared to nodes 1–16, which might be
due to more frequent extreme winds in this area. However, storminess is constant under the effects
of climate change in the case of RCP4.5. Despite this, the first and the second time-derivatives of
SC present special relevance to the storm-thresholds in the northwestern Black Sea. The sensitivity
of storm-threshold to SC means that SC does affect the combination of storminess and intensity of



Water 2018, 10, 221 21 of 28

wave-storms. The lack of relationship between storminess and climate patterns is not common in the
present [91] or future climates. For instance, storminess is significantly related to negative NAO in the
Catalan Coast, another micro-tidal environment in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea [11].

The mean of Hp and Tp remain constant in 1950–2100, whereas E and D rise under the effects of
climate change (See Figure 4). D seems sensible to the temperature energetic input into the atmosphere
by climate change, as well as being the only contributor to the rise in E in the second half of the
21st century. A higher E, combined with an equally higher D, is often related to greater destructive
forces, whether on the natural environment or urban areas. A constant mean Tp is related to a constant
fetch, following the stationarity of the wave-storm mean wave-directions. Additionally, a constant
mean Hp means that during this century the joint effect of sea-level-rise and Hp would not worsen
in the form of, for instance, more flooding. The location parameters x0 of E, Hp, Tp, and D are
significantly influenced by EA, the first time-derivative of NAO, SC, and EA, respectively. According
to the regression coefficients Cr of the VGAM used to obtain the location parameters x0, it seems
plausible that EA > 0 contributed to higher mean of E and D. The location parameter x0 of Hp is in
turn significantly influenced by a fast increase of negative NAO. The effect of NAO on wave-height
under extreme wave-climate could be of concern, considering that this relationship was also observed
by [92] in a hindcasted model from the Liverpool Bay. The location parameter x0 of Tp is significantly
influenced by a negative SC.

Figure 5 shows that the variances of E, Hp, Tp, and D increase in the 1950–2100. The figure
also reflects how greater mean values are followed by greater variances, which is common in field
observation. There seems to be a peak of scale parameter β in the period 2001–2025, which would
explain that in the northern Aegean Sea, very near to the Black Sea [93], extreme wave-heights were
higher during 2001–2050. The scenario considered in [93] is the A1B scenario of the Assessment Report
4 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007. It is equivalent to RCP6.0 of the Assessment
Report 5 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2013 [94]. The variabilities of Hp, Tp, and
D are strongly dependent on EA, the second time-derivative of EA, and EA, respectively. The variance
of E is not especially sensible to any climate index, nor their accelerations. However, the variabilities
of Hp and D increase with high values of negative and positive EA, respectively. Additionally, the
variability of Tp increases with a fast approach towards negative EA.

As for the joint statistical structure of the storm components at the northwestern Black Sea (see
Figures 3b and 6), there is a lower dependence between the Hp and the E-D, unlike in the Catalan
Coast [11]. The maximum value of τroot is approximately 0.67, so the dependence among Hp, Tp, E,
and D are not especially strong and wave-storms with extreme values of all of these components are
not probable. This is corroborated by historical wave-storms observations, where it is common to
have extreme conditions in wave-height, but a combination of extreme wave-height, wave-period,
wave-storm duration, and energy is extremely rare. Nevertheless, the increasing trend in τroot suggests
that all four storm components present a greater common semi-dependence with time. τ(E,D) takes
values of approximately 0.85, so there is a strong association of E and D. This should be true, by
the definition of E (see Equation 2), but here the relatively lower role of Hp in E is verified. This
also implies that a wave-storm of maximum E and D is more feasible in this century. Note that this
semi-dependence is lower in the period 2000–2050 than during the rest of the century.

5.2. RCP8.5

The CNRM-CM5 GCM presents higher PACF-based distances in the RCP8.5, compared to the
RCP4.5 scenario. The wave-storm components E and D are still the most coincident wave-storm
components between GCMs. Additionally, as in the RCP4.5 scenario, the selection of the GCM affects
the outcomes of Hp and Tp, mainly the models from the GFDL, IPSL, and MIROC branches, in
comparison to the CNRM branch. Therefore, while the PACF-based distances in these GCMs are
still relatively small, like in the RCP4.5 scenario, a selection of the models from the GFDL, IPSL, and
MIROC branches would project slightly different wave-storms.



Water 2018, 10, 221 22 of 28

Estimated storminess is similar between the RCP8.5 scenario and the RCP4.5 scenario, presenting
more estimated storminess at nodes 17–34 (see Figure 1). Again, the estimated average number of
storms exceeds the usual 15–20 storms/year. This is possibly for the same reasons as in the RCP4.5
scenario. However, the minimum time-interval between storms of 72 h has prevented replicants of the
same storm from mistakenly elevating storminess. Additionally, similar to the RCP4.5 scenario, climate
change does not affect storminess, as the latter stays constant during 1950–2100 and is unaffected by
climate patterns. EA, the second time-derivative of which is the most influential on the wave-storm
threshold, is mostly active between the months of December and February, as the winter average EA
brings a low surface pressure anomaly centre over the Caspian region, east of the Black Sea. In the
positive phase of EA, associated with the anticyclonic activity over the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea
region is exposed to cold and dry air masses from the northeast-to-northwest sector. On the contrary,
in its negative phase associated with the anticyclonic activity over the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea
region is affected by air masses flowing from the southwest to the southeast [95]. The sensitivity of the
storm-threshold to the second time-derivative of EA indicates that a sudden appearance of EA during
a winter season foreshadows a worsening of the sea state during that period.

The location parameters x0 of Hp show a constant trend in 1950–2100 (see Figure 7), but decrease
slightly. This phenomenon coincides with [77], which stated that under the RCP8.5 scenario, the
maximum wave-height in the Black Sea decreases in the period comprising 2080–2099. The mean
value of D has a constant trend in 1950–2100, and it is not higher for the more severe emission scenario
RCP8.5. The trend of the mean value of E should be constant, as in the cases of Hp and D. However, the
presence of different trends at each node suggests that it depends on the relative dominance of Hp or D
at each node. The location parameter x0 of Tp is constant over the 21st century, so the statistical mean
of this storm component might be constant over time, like under RCP4.5. According to the regression
parameters Cr of the VGAMs used to predict the storm components from the corresponding climate
indices, the mean values of E and D are not significantly influenced by any climate index. However,
the mean value of Hp is strongly influenced by the second time-derivative of EA. The regression
parameter Cr of a VGAM that predicts the location parameter x0 of Hp from EA shows no strong
relationship between the location parameter x0 of Hp and EA, so it can be inferred from the results
that the mean Hp can be produced by an acceleration towards negative EA. Tp is strongly influenced
by NAO, and it increases with a positive phase of this climate pattern.

Additionally, like in the RCP4.5 scenario, the trend of the scale parameters β for each storm
component (see Figure 8) reflects the trends in the location parameter x0 of the respective storm
components (see Figure 7). That is, the degree of variability parallels the mean value of each storm
component. A possible explanation is that a greater mean value of each storm component was related
to a greater variance of the storm component. The variability of Hp, Tp, and D are significantly
influenced by the respective climate indices, while the variability of E is not sensible to any climate
index. From the results, it can be deduced that the variability of Hp increases with negative SC, the
variability of Tp increases with positive EA, whereas the variability of D increases with a rapid increase
of positive SC. At this point, it should be noted that EA has a relatively greater influence on the GPD
parameters than the other two selected climate-patterns. All the EA climate-index and its first and
second time-derivatives have this effect. Therefore, EA can be crucial in future mean values and
variabilities of wave-storm components.

As for the joint probability of occurrence of different storm components, there is also a lower
dependence between the Hp and the E-D than in the Catalan Coast [11]. The maximum τroot is 0.65
(see Figure 9), similar to the RCP4.5 scenario (see Figure 6). It denotes similar moderate general
dependence among wave-storm components. However, there is again a positive trend for this
semi-dependence among the four storm components. The mean τ(E,D) is 0.83, similar to the RCP4.5
scenario, meaning that wave-storms of maximum E and D are possible in this century. This high
dependence between E-D is also present in the also micro-tidal environment of the Catalan Coast, under
the RCP8.5 scenario [11]. Like in the RCP4.5 scenario, there is also a period of lower semi-dependence



Water 2018, 10, 221 23 of 28

among E and D, this time from 1980 to 2015 and from 2040 to 2070. It should be noted that τ are
generally 2 centesimals lower in the RCP8.5 scenario than in the RCP4.5 scenario. This suggests a
lower dependence among wave-storm components in higher emission scenarios, possibly due to the
presence of extremes of single wave-storm components during wave-storms.

5.3. Applicability of the Results

Water infrastructure tends to be designed with pre-defined loads that aims to fulfill a particular
need (i.e., water storage and distribution, ocean wave sheltering, storm flooding, etc.) Climate change
adds a further layer of complexity: (i) the stationary assumption of the loads cannot be assumed;
and (ii) there is a relevant uncertainty in how extreme climate forcings will change [96]. An option
for bounding this uncertainty is to analyse GCMs’ climate projections derived from IPCC climate
scenarios [25], such as RCP 8.5 or 4.5. Dynamical downscaling (the first step in our methodology)
joint with non-stationary multivariate statistics (second step) provides an affordable solution, without
requiring prohibitive computational cost. Once the statistical model is fitted with process-based
model outputs and after establishing relationships between the loads and related climate indices
[21,97,98], uncertainty can be bounded by comparing climate indices from several publicly available
GCMs (fourth step).

These statistical models can deal with level 3 (probabilistic) designs, considering random
simulation of the loads, while presenting a pre-defined dependence structure (for example,
via Archimedean copulas). Recent methodologies for coastal infrastructure design consider the
joint action of wave-height, wave-period, and storm-duration [16,99]. Beach management could
also benefit from the additional robustness, due to consistency in climatic co-factors. For instance,
stakeholders could thus pro-actively protect a beach for a cruder winter season which has much more
destructive waves or more unpredictable wave-storms [29,100] than other projected milder winters.
More lives could be saved if preparedness campaigns were made for people to avoid navigation
under high probability of especially hazardous wave-storms. These improvements can be extended to
other fields, such as river hydrology or the preservation of coastal biosphere. In any of these fields,
predictability is strongly linked to variability and joint probability-structure of extreme components.
Hence, stakeholders can benefit from these hybrid methodologies for disaster risk management.

6. Conclusions

Present and future wave conditions under two climate change projections (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)
have been modelled with SWAN in the Black Sea. These projections have been characterized
with a multivariate non-stationary statistical model that deals with the storm components and the
semi-dependence among them. The individual probability of the storm components are characterized
by non-stationary GPD functions. The parameters of such GPDs have been estimated through
VGAM, where climate indices derived from the CNRM-CM5 general circulation model (NAO, EA,
and SC) have been employed as covariates. The joint probability structure is characterized by a
pseudo-non-stationary HAC.

The proposed hybrid methodology shows the following features. Similar trends are found when
using climate indices derived from other GCMs as predictors. Hence, loads due to future extreme
climate have been characterized in the statistical model. Estimated storminess is affected by neither
time nor climate indices, in any RCP scenario. The wave-storm threshold, however, is strongly
influenced by the first and second time-derivatives of SC in the RCP4.5 scenario, and by the second
time-derivative of EA in the RCP8.5 scenario. Under both RCP scenarios, the mean values of Hp and
Tp remain fairly constant over the 21st century. The mean value of E is more markedly increasing in
the RCP4.5 scenario than in the RCP8.5 scenario. The mean value of D is increasing in the RCP4.5
scenario, as opposed to the constant trend in the RCP8.5 scenario. The variability of each storm
component increases with increasing mean values, under both RCP scenarios. All three climate indices



Water 2018, 10, 221 24 of 28

can influence the mean values and variances of the wave-storm components, but EA and its dynamics
play a special role.

Under both scenarios, wave-storms of maximum E, Hp, Tp, and D are not excessively common, but
wave-storms of concurrent extreme E and D can be expected. A positive trend in the semi-dependence
among all wave-storm components can be observed in both scenarios. There are also periods of
lower semi-dependence among E and D; e.g., 2000–2050 in the RCP4.5 scenario, and 1980–2015 and
2040–2070 in the RCP8.5 scenario. Additionally, the more severe emission scenario of RCP8.5 presents
lower dependence among wave-storm components. The joint knowledge of the effects of climate
indices, the trend of each storm component in this century, and the probability of joint occurrence can
help to improve performance in the design of coastal infrastructure and the management of natural
and urban resources.
