Abstract Wave boundary layer (WBL) dynamics are measured with an Acoustic Concentration and
Velocity Profiler (ACVP) across the sheet flow-dominated wave-breaking region of regular large-scale
waves breaking as a plunger over a developing breaker bar. Acoustic sheet flow measurements are first
evaluated quantitatively in comparison to Conductivity Concentration Meter (CCM+) data used as a
reference. The near-bed orbital velocity field exhibits expected behaviors in terms of wave shape, intrawave
WBL thickness, and velocity phase leads. The observed fully turbulent flow regime all across the studied
wave-breaking region supports the model-predicted transformation of free-stream velocity asymmetry into
near-bed velocity skewness inside theWBL. Intrawave concentration dynamics reveal the existence of a lower
pickup layer and an upper sheet flow layer similar to skewed oscillatory sheet flows, and with similar
characteristics in terms of erosion depth and sheet flow layer thickness. Compared to the shoaling region,
differences in terms of sheet flow and hydrodynamic properties of the flow are observed at the plunge point,
attributed to the locally enhanced wave breaker turbulence. The ACVP-measured total sheet flow transport
rate is decomposed into its current-, wave-, and turbulence-driven components. In the shoaling region,
the sand transport is found to be fully dominated by the onshore skewed wave-driven component with
negligible phase lag effects. In the outer surf zone, the total net flux exhibits a three-layer vertical structure
typical of skewed oscillatory sheet flows. However, in the present experiments this structure originates from
offshore-directed undertow-driven flux, rather than from phase lag effects.

Plain Language Summary We focus here on novel wave boundary layer hydrodynamics and
sheet flow properties obtained with the Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profiler measurement
technology. It is the first time this advanced acoustic instrumentation is used for high-resolution
measurements of wave-driven sheet flows under large-scale breaking waves. The wave boundary layer
hydrodynamics and, in particular, the detailed properties of the sheet flow dynamics in terms of pickup
layer, bedload, and suspended sand transport are investigated. Finally, sand fluxes (as transport rates)
decomposed into the undertow-, the wave- and the turbulence-driven contributions allow a new insight
into the underlying sand transport mechanisms in the scientifically challenging, coastal wave-breaking
region. These results are compared to sheet flow properties obtained in (nonbreaking) oscillatory flows
(from experiments in U-tube facilities) in order to show how the wave-breaking process impacts the
internal and external sheet flow dynamics.

1. Introduction

Over the past decades, considerable research efforts have been concerned with understanding and model-
ing nearshore sand transport processes under energetic wave forcing conditions for which the sediment
transport occurs as sheet flow. Previous studies on sheet flow processes were primarily conducted in flow
tunnels (Dibajnia & Watanabe, 1998; Dick & Sleath, 1992; Hassan & Ribberink, 2005; Horikawa et al., 1982;
McLean et al., 2001; O’Donoghue & Wright, 2004a, 2004b; Ribberink & Al-Salem, 1994; Ruessink et al., 2011;
Sumer et al., 1996; van der A et al., 2010), in large wave flumes involving nonbreaking surface gravity waves
over horizontally flat sand beds (Dohmen-Janssen & Hanes, 2002, 2005; Schretlen et al., 2009), or in the
shoaling zone of a fixed bar composed of a mobile sand bed part as the test section (Anderson et al.,

2017; Mieras et al., 2017a). These experimental studies have revealed the complex structure of the internal
sheet flow velocity, concentration, and sand flux (i.e., inside the bottom wave boundary layer, WBL) for a
wide range of flow and sediment characteristics, while various process-based numerical models (Amoudry
et al., 2008; Caliskan & Fuhrman, 2017; Cheng et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2016; Fuhrman et al., 2013; Hsu & Liu,
2004; Kranenburg et al., 2013, 2014) reproduce the dominant processes to a greater or lesser extent. These
experimental and numerical studies have further led to the development of semiempirical, parameterized
sand transport models for practical applications (e.g., Dibajnia & Watanabe, 1998; Drake & Calantoni, 2001;
Fernández-Mora et al., 2015; Hoefel & Elgar, 2003; Nielsen, 2006; van der A et al., 2010, 2013; Watanabe &
Sato, 2004) in which the key hydrodynamic WBL parameters are identified as the WBL thickness, the
velocity phase lead, and the wave nonlinearities (velocity skewness and asymmetry), because they control
the intrawave and net bed shear stress dynamics (Fuhrman et al., 2009; van der A et al., 2011) as the main
driving force for bedload sand transport models.

The very limited number of internal sheet flow studies addressing both WBL hydrodynamics and sediment
transport properties were primarily conducted in oscillatory flow tunnels (O’Donoghue & Wright, 2004a,
2004b) or under nonbreaking or shoaling waves (Anderson et al., 2017; Dohmen-Janssen & Hanes, 2002,
2005; Mieras et al., 2017a; Schretlen et al., 2009). The applicability of these results and proposed models to
breaking wave conditions is still an open scientific question. In particular, the potential impact of the
breaking-induced jet and bore turbulence on the key WBL hydrodynamic parameters and the internal sheet
flow layer structure remains nonelucidated.

Only recently, van der Zanden, van der A., et al. (2017) estimated the cross-shore bedload transport over the
entire wave-breaking region. That study quantified the contribution of bedload transport to the total trans-
port in the cross-shore region extending from the wave shoaling zone to the inner surf zone. Bedload trans-
port under sheet flow conditions was shown to dominate the total sand flux in the shoaling zone and in the
outer surf zone, corresponding to the offshore face, crest, and upper onshore face of the breaker bar. In this
region, sheet flow dominates the net onshore-directed sand transport, while undertow-driven, offshore-
directed suspended transport dominates in the region shoreward of the bar slope. In van der Zanden, van
der A., et al. (2017), depth-integrated bedload transport was estimated indirectly from the difference
between total net transport rates (obtained from bed profile measurements) and measured net suspended
transport rates. The internal structure of the sheet flow layer in terms of the key WBL hydrodynamic para-
meters (WBL thickness, velocity phase lead, and wave velocity nonlinearities), the sediment concentration,
and sediment flux dynamics, at both intrawave and wave-averaged time scales, was not addressed in detail.

The present study focuses on WBL hydrodynamics and sheet flow transport processes using time-resolved,
vertical profiling of colocated sand velocity, sand concentration, and bed level position, provided by the
Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profiler (ACVP) technology of Hurther et al. (2011). This high-resolution
measurement technique has recently been applied to various process-oriented sediment transport studies
(Cheng et al., 2017; Hurther & Thorne, 2011; Naqshband, Ribberink, Hurther, & Hulscher, 2014; Naqshband,
Ribberink, Hurther, Barraud, et al., 2014; Revil-Baudard et al., 2015, 2016) directly providing sand flux profiles,
which can be decomposed into turbulent, orbital wave and mean contributions for both bedload and
suspended load. In the present study, the technology is applied for the first time to medium-sand sheet flow
conditions, induced by large-scale breaking waves.

The experiments, data treatment, and validation of the measurements are described in section 2. Section 3
presents and discusses the WBL hydrodynamics in the wave-breaking region, with particular focus on (a)
the free-stream wave characteristics, the intrawave orbital velocity field, (b) the intrawave WBL thickness,
(c) the first harmonic and full harmonic velocity phase leads, and (d) the wave velocity nonlinearities
(skewness and asymmetry) inside the WBL. The cross-shore variation in sheet flow properties are presented
in section 4 with a focus on (a) intrawave concentrations, erosion depth, and sheet flow layer thickness and
(b) the vertical structure of the sand flux.

2. Experimental Setup
2.1. Wave Conditions and Experimental Protocol

The experiments were carried out in the large-scale CIEM wave flume of the Universitat Politecnica de
Catalunya in Barcelona (100-m long, 3-m wide, and 4.5-m deep), in which a breaker bar was generated by

monochromatic waves propagating over a beach comprising a well-sorted, medium sand (median diameter
d50 = 0.249 mm, degree of uniformity σg = 1.36). The waves had period T = 4 s and wave height H0 = 0.85 m
at the wave paddle, where the water depth was h0 = 2.55 m. Plunging breaking waves occurred at the
breaker bar, consistent with the surf similarity parameter ξ0 = 0.54 (Battjes, 1975).

The experimental facility and reference bed profile are presented in Figure 1. The break point and plunge
point were located at x = 53 m and x = 55.5 m, respectively (van der Zanden et al., 2016; van der Zanden,
Hurther, et al., 2017). In what follows, the x = 53 m location is used to define the separation of the shoaling
and breaking zones. The present study concerns the sheet flow-dominated region on the bar extending from
x = 51 m in the shoaling zone to the location of the plunge point at x = 55.5 m. The experimental protocol has
been described in van der Zanden et al. (2016); therefore, only the main steps are summarized herein. The
initial bed profile, that is, before waves, comprised a 1:10 offshore slope followed by an 18-m long horizontal
test section where the water depth was 1.2 m. The reference barred profile shown in Figure 1a was produced
by 105 min of waves propagating over the initial profile. The profile was drawn on both sidewalls of the flume
in order to reshape the profile to this reference profile after each experiment. Each experiment lasted 90 min
in total, comprising six 15-min runs, during which the breaker bar developed slowly. After every second run,
that is, after 30 min, the bed profile was measured to track the morphological change and to estimate the
total sand transport rate (from the morphological changes) across the entire wave-breaking region (van
der Zanden, van der A, et al., 2017). After the last (sixth) run of each experiment, the flume was drained
and the beach was reshaped back to the reference profile. This experimental protocol was repeated 12 times
to enable measurements at 12 different cross-shore positions (shown in Figure 1b) along the same beach
profile using the mobile measurement frame shown in Figure 1c.

2.2. Instrumentation

In the present paper we focus on the ACVP and the Conductivity Concentration Meter (CCM+) instruments.
Two synchronized ACVPs were deployed, one was fixed at x = 54.5 m for comparison with CCM+ concentra-
tion measurements at the same position, and the other was deployed on the mobile frame to provide mea-
surements at multiple locations along the barred profile. The ACVP instruments deliver quasi-instantaneous,
simultaneous, and colocated 1-D vertical profiles of the two-component velocity field (streamwise and verti-
cal velocity components u and w), together with the acoustic intensity profiles. The velocity components are
extracted from the two quasi-instantaneous Doppler frequencies of the received acoustic pressure waves
(Hurther et al., 2011). The acoustic intensity profiles are converted into mass concentration profiles using
the incoherent acoustic inversion methods described in Hurther et al. (2011), Thorne et al. (2011), and
Thorne and Hurther (2014). The present spatial and temporal resolutions are 1.5 mm and 1/70 s, respectively,
over a maximum profiling range of 18 cm along the transmitter axis. The time-resolved near-bed sand flux
profiles are calculated from the simultaneous colocated velocity and concentration profiles (Hurther &
Thorne, 2011; Naqshband, Ribberink, Hurther, & Hulscher, 2014; Naqshband, Ribberink, Hurther, Barraud,
et al., 2014; Revil-Baudard et al., 2015, 2016).

The CCM+ provides time-resolved sediment concentrations in the sheet flow layer from a point conductivity
measurement (McLean et al., 2001; van der Zanden et al., 2015; van der Zanden, van der A., et al., 2017). The
double probe technology of the CCM+ enables particle velocity estimation via signal cross-correlation tech-
niques (McLean et al., 2001). The probe enters the sheet flow layer from a tank buried within the sand bed
and samples the local conductivity at 1,000 Hz. Servomotors contained within the buried CCM tank can posi-
tion the probe vertically with 100-μm accuracy. The system is equipped with a bed level tracking system that
enables automatic repositioning of the probes at submillimeter accuracy to cover the entire sheet flow layer.
Several hundred repeatable waves are required to profile the entire sheet flow layer and to give statistically
converged concentrations and particle velocities. More details regarding the CCM+ and data processing can
be found in van der Zanden et al. (2015), van der Zanden, van der A., et al. (2017).

2.3. Data Processing

Visual inspection of video records and analysis of water surface elevation measurements by van der Zanden
et al. (2016) showed that the wave-breaking location varied over the first 5 min of each run. After this
transient phase, the breaking location stabilized and a hydrodynamic equilibrium was established. Data

obtained during the first 5 min of each run were therefore discarded, leaving 10 min of data per run for
processing and analysis, giving approximately 150 waves per run.

The inversion of the backscattered intensity recorded by the ACVP to give sediment concentrations followed
the procedure described in Hurther et al. (2011) and the calibration method of Thorne and Hanes (2002)
using the total suspended sediment (TSS) measured concentrations as reference data. For more details on
the comparison between acoustically estimated and observed TSS, please refer to van der Zanden, van der
A, et al. (2017).

Time-dependent ACVP measurements in the sheet flow layer are complicated by the fact that the no-flow
bed level can gradually change during the measurement period due to large-scale bed level erosion or accre-
tion. For example, at the start of an experiment prior to any wave action (t< tstart) the no-flow bed level might
be detected at bin 60 in the ACVP profile (where bin 1 is closest to the emitter), while at the end of the run
when the waves have stopped (t> tstop) and the suspended sediment has settled, the bed could be detected
at bin 64, meaning that there was an overall bed level erosion of four bin sizes, or 6mm. In the analysis of their
oscillatory flow tunnel measurements, O’Donoghue andWright (2004a) assumed that throughout the experi-
ment the no-flow bed level changed linearly in time, which allowed them to reference each bin at each time
step to an instantaneous no-flow bed level, z(t) = 0. In this experiment the instantaneous undisturbed bed
level (z(t) = � δe(t)), was determined from the acoustic intensity profiles following the method of Hurther
and Thorne (2011). By removing the intrawave variation from this instantaneous undisturbed bed level (by
applying a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1/T = 1/4 s = 0.25 Hz), the large-scale or gradual bed level
change was obtained, which showed that the bed level did not always vary linearly in time. A somewhat
different procedure compared to the linear interpolation by O’Donoghue and Wright (2004a) was therefore
applied to determine instantaneous no-flow bed level. First, the distance, or “offset,” between the no-flow
bed level measured before the start of waves (z(t < tstart) = 0) and the filtered undisturbed bed level a few
wave cycles after the wave paddle had started was determined. Second, the same offset between the filtered
undisturbed bed level and themeasured no-flow bed level after thewave paddle had stopped (z(t> tstop) = 0)
was determined. The offset was found to be the same at the start and end of every run and was approxi-
mately one bin size, or 1.5 mm, in length. Therefore, the no-flow bed level at every time step was established
by assuming that the same constant offset applies throughout the run between the measured instantaneous
large-scale undisturbed bed level and the instantaneous no-flow bed level. Following this procedure, every
concentration and velocity measurement at every time step was associated with a particular elevation
relative to the instantaneous no-flow bed level, which allowed subsequent phase averaging.

To calculate the phase-averaged quantities, the wave-by-wave phase
origin is taken as the zero up-crossing of the free-stream horizontal orbital
velocity. The phase-averaged value of a variable ψ (which can be a
function of z) is calculated over N repeated waves as ψ t=Tð Þ ¼ 1N ∑Nn¼1ψ
t þ n� 1ð ÞTð Þ. Decomposition into time-averaged (ψ), orbital (eψ ¼ ψh i �
ψ ) and turbulent contributions (ψ

0
= ψ � 〈ψ〉) is achieved following the

method described in van der Zanden et al. (2016). Note that in the follow-
ing, the terminology “intrawave” refers to variation of a phase-averaged

quantity as a function of the relative phase t/T. For brevity, we omit the brackets 〈…〉 to represent phase-
averaged quantities in the remainder of this paper. Note that to facilitate comparisons of our phase-averaged
results with previous sheet flow layer studies, a second vertical coordinate system, z

0
(t), where z

0
(t) = z(t) + δe(t),

is occasionally adopted in the remainder of this paper.

The intrawave top of the sheet flow layer (also called the suspension interface) was determined from the
phase-averaged volumetric concentration using the criterion of 0.08 m3/m3 (Dohmen-Janssen et al., 2001)
as the upper limit of the sheet flow layer. The CCM+ concentration measurements used to validate the
acoustic measurements at 54.5 m (see next section) were averaged over at least 12 runs (of more than 100
waves per run), resulting in well-converged CCM+ phase-averaged concentrations, with negligible statistical
bias error. The intrawave erosion depth and sheet flow layer thickness were obtained by applying the power
law fitting method described in O’Donoghue and Wright (2004a) to the intrawave vertical profiles of concen-
tration. The net sand transport rate (i.e., the time-averaged local flux vertically integrated over the sheet flow
layer) is estimated from the particle velocity and concentration measurements, as detailed in van der Zanden,
van der A., et al. (2017).

Velocity skewness and asymmetry are calculated as Sk uð Þ ¼ eu3=eu3rms and Asy uð Þ ¼ �HðeuÞ3=eu3rms, where eu is
the (periodic) wave orbital velocity, eurms the root-mean-square periodic velocity, and H is the Hilbert
transform (e.g., Elgar, 1987). Sk∞ and Asy∞ refer to velocity skewness and asymmetry values at the free-stream
height (taken 0.1 m above the no-flow bed level as previously defined in van der Zanden et al., 2016).

Table 1 presents the orbital semiexcursion amplitude a ¼ eu∞;maxT= 2πð Þ at the free-stream height normalized
by the average bed roughness (ks, using the formulation of van der A. et al., 2013), a/ks, and the average
Reynolds number Re ¼ aeu∞;max=ν, at each cross-shore position for the 27 successfully collected runs (3 runs
out of 30 runs—6 runs times 5 cross-shore positions—failed due to acquisition problems) between x = 51 m
and x = 55.5 m. Here ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. Similar to van der Zanden et al. (2016), the
free-stream height is taken at 0.1 m above the no-flow bed level, that is, well above the top of the bottom
WBL (discussed in section 3.2). This height corresponds to a range of 5 to 10 times the local WBL thickness
depending on the cross-shore position. Based on the Re and a/ks values shown in Table 1, the flow regime
is hydrodynamically fully turbulent and transitionally rough when compared to literature data in Jonsson
(1980) and van der A et al. (2011; Figure 3).

2.4. Validation of ACVP Sheet Flow Measurements

In the present experiments, the ACVP technology was used for the first time under wave-driven sheet flow
conditions with real sands. This experimental condition is different from previous studies in which the
ACVP has been successfully used in gravity-current-driven sheet flows with light-weight particles (Fromant
et al., 2018; Revil-Baudard et al., 2015, 2016). To assess the performance of the ACVP under these conditions,
we compare ACVP-measured erosion depth, sheet flow layer thickness, and sand transport rate with the
corresponding CCM+ measurements at x = 54.5 m.

Figure 2 presents the CCM+ and ACVP measurements for a representative run of the collected data set.
Figures 2a and 2b show the ACVP-measured free-stream orbital velocity for reference. The shape of the
free-stream velocity reveals strong positive velocity skewness and asymmetry typical of surf zone waves.
Figures 2c and 2d show CCM+-measured (Figure 2c) and ACVP-measured (Figure 2d) c(z, t/T), erosion depth
δe(t/T), and suspension interface δu(t/T) (lower and upper white lines, respectively). Both instruments show
similar intrawave dynamics: as seen from the CCM+ measurements, the bed is subject to deeper erosion
under the wave crest than under the wave trough. The difference in erosion depth between the crest
and trough is less than 1.5 mm and is therefore not resolved by the ACVP (which has a resolution of

1.5 mm). Both measurements show nonzero erosion depth at the two flow reversals, a consequence of
nonsettled sediment load due to phase lag effects or non-locally controlled cross-shore sand advection
processes. The suspension interface δu(t/T) reaches higher levels under the wave crest than under the
wave trough, due to the stronger sand particle entrainment from the pickup layer. The existence of the
pickup layer is seen from the c(t/T) at selected elevations (Figures 2e and 2f): within the pickup layer,
c(t/T) is in antiphase with eu∞ t=Tð Þ (Figures 2a and 2e), while in the upper sheet flow layer c(t/T) and eu∞
t=Tð Þ are in phase. Finally, the sheet flow layer thickness, δs(t/T), calculated as δu(t/T) – δe(t/T), shows
similar intrawave behavior between the two measurements (Figures 2g and 2h), with a thicker layer
under the wave crest than under the wave trough, reflecting the differences in sand transport between
crest and trough half cycles. In terms of quantitative comparison: CCM+ and ACVP maximum erosion
depths are 2.7 mm and 2.9 mm, respectively, occurring at t/T = 0.17; maximum sheet flow layer
thicknesses are 6 mm and 4.8 mm, respectively. Van der Zanden, van der A., et al. (2017) estimated a
net bedload sand transport rate of 1.1 × 10�5 m2/s based on the CCM+ measurements; the
corresponding ACVP estimate (equations (5) and (7)) is 1.5 (±0.5) × 10�5 m2/s. Given the very different
sampling and averaging techniques implemented by the two measurement systems, the relative
difference of 25% between the CCM+ and ACVP net transport rates is considered as a satisfactory
validation of the noninvasive acoustic sheet flow measurements used at all cross-shore positions in the
following.

The present section focuses on the near-bed hydrodynamics across the sheet flow-dominated shoaling and
breaking region (51 m< x< 55.5 m) as determined from the ACVP measurements. The near-bed turbulence,

streaming, and undertow hydrodynamics were examined in van der Zanden et al. (2016) for the same experi-
ment. The outer-flow hydrodynamics and turbulence were studied in van der A. et al. (2017) for identical
wave conditions but over a fixed (immobile) breaker bar. Here we focus instead on the ACVP-measured
wave-driven velocity field inside the bottom WBL. In particular, the cross-shore and intrawave variation in
WBL thickness, velocity phase lead, and wave nonlinearities inside the WBL are analyzed and compared with
previous results from oscillatory flow tunnel and nonbreaking wave experiments involving fixed and mobile
beds. These hydrodynamic parameters all play a key role in the bed shear stress as the main driving forces in
sheet flow sediment transport models (Drake & Calantoni, 2001; Hoefel & Elgar, 2003; Nielsen, 2006; Ribberink
et al., 2008; van der A et al., 2010; Watanabe & Sato, 2004). The main objective of this section is to study how
these hydrodynamic properties vary across the wave-breaking region.

3.1. Near-Bed Velocity Field

Figure 3 (left panels) presents the vertical profiles of eurms used for the detection of the bottom WBL. For
comparison with O’Donoghue and Wright’s (2004b) results for skewed oscillatory flows and van der A
et al.’s (2011) results for asymmetric oscillatory flows, all vertical profiles in Figure 3 are bed referenced at
intrawave scale before phase averaging, such that z

0
/a = (z + δe(t/T))/a.

The left panels in Figure 3 show similar profile shapes of eurms, including the presence of a typical near-bed
velocity overshoot as a result of the bed friction-induced velocity-phase shifts inside the WBL (e.g., Nielsen,
1992). The top of the WBL, defined as the height of maximum overshoot in eurms, is seen to increase with x
over the range z

0
/a = [0.02–0.035]. The overshoot magnitude (x axis) in Figure 3 increases from x = 51 m to

x = 53 m, decreases between x = 53 m and x = 54.5 m and varies slightly between x = 54 m and
x = 55.5 m. This confirms that the investigated cross-shore domain includes the wave-breaking region asso-
ciated with an abrupt reduction in wave energy.

The center panels of Figure 3 present eu∞(t/T) and the near-bed velocity eub(t/T) at z0b = 1.5 mm (z0/a ≈ 0.003),
which corresponds to the first measurement point above the detected bed. For all cross-shore positions, the
free-stream velocity is strongly positively skewed and asymmetric, with skewness and asymmetry values
(noted in Figure 3, center panels) in the ranges Sk∞ = 0.47–0.6 and Asy∞ = 0.69–1.1, respectively. These values
and their cross-shore variation are similar to values reported from previous wave flume experiments (Berni
et al., 2013; Chassagneux & Hurther, 2014; Henriquez et al., 2014; Mieras et al., 2017a) and are slightly higher
than values reported from field experiments (Doering & Bowen, 1995), the difference likely being due to the
forced wave regularity and the flume-imposed shore-normal wave propagation direction.

The near-bed wave velocity fields represented by the color plots in the center panels of Figure 3 show an
overall similar and typical near-bed intrawave behavior at all cross-shore positions with a region of overshoot
in velocity amplitude above a region of velocity amplitude damping closer to the bed, as represented by the
eurms profiles in the left panels of Figure 3. This characterizes the presence of a damped defect velocity oscilla-
tion propagating upward, typical of WBL hydrodynamics (Nielsen, 1992). The maximum wave velocity values
are seen to increase between x = 51 m and x = 53 m and decrease toward the bar crest at x = 55 m as a
consequence of the abrupt wave-breaking process initiated at x = 53 m.

3.2. Intrawave WBL Thickness

The intrawave boundary layer thickness δWBL is represented in Figure 3 by the black circle symbols in the

velocity plots. It is calculated at each t/T as the distance between z
0
= 0 and the height where eu z0� � is

maximum and has the same sign as eu 0ð Þ (Ruessink et al., 2011). For all cross-shore positions, the intrawave
WBL thickness is seen to grow fairly linearly with time during the wave trough period associated with a favor-
able pressure gradient (for 0.4< t/T< 0.83, called the “wave back” by Henriquez et al., 2014). During the wave
crest period with favorable pressure gradient (for 0 < t/T < 0.15, the “wave front”), δWBL appears to grow lin-
early as well but at a faster rate. This higher WBL growth rate under the wave front relative to the wave back
relates to acceleration skewness effects and was observed previously in asymmetric oscillatory flows
(Ruessink et al., 2011; van der A et al., 2011) and in small-scale skewed asymmetric surface waves propagating
over a fixed bar (Henriquez et al., 2014). Figure 3 further shows that slightly larger values of maximum intra-
wave WBL thickness are reached during the wave backs. This can also be observed from the difference in
height between the two white dots in the color plots of Figure 3, corresponding to the associated crest

and trough intrawave WBL thicknesses. This difference in maximum intrawave WBL thickness development
during crest and trough was also observed by van der A et al. (2011) in fully turbulent asymmetric oscillatory
flows and in Henriquez et al. (2014) for smooth-bed transitionally turbulent wave flume experiments.

3.3. WBL Phase Lead

The phase shift φ between the free-stream and near-bed wave velocities is another crucial WBL parameter
controlling the phase at which the intrawave bed shear stress is maximum in the wave cycle. The near-bed
velocity is known to lead the free-stream velocity with a value of φ = 45° in the case of laminar oscillatory flow
and for very rough turbulent flows, such as oscillatory flows over vortex ripples (Nielsen, 2016). The phase
lead reduces for increasing Reynolds number, due to the more effective turbulent momentum mixing
(Nielsen, 1992). Accurate understanding and predictions of φ are important, because most quasi-steady bed-
load sediment transport models use the intrawave bed shear stress, derived from the free-stream velocity, as
the driving force for bedload sediment motion (Nielsen, 2006; Ribberink et al., 2008; van der A et al., 2013).

Figure 4a shows an example of the increasing phase lead φ at x = 51 m
between free-stream velocity and velocity at lower elevations, calculated
from the first harmonic component of the wave velocity to enable
rigorous comparison with previous oscillatory flow experiments.

Figure 5 shows φ at each cross-shore location (averaged over all runs at each
location), in comparison with other WBL studies. When calculated for all 27
runs at all cross-shore positions as a function of the ratio a/ks, the measured
phase lead values (taken at 1.5 mm above the bed) vary between 8° and 20°,
consistent with previous results for turbulent oscillatory flows. The new data
provide additional supporting evidence that a logarithmic relation exists
between φ and a/ks for a/ks larger than 10, as suggested by van der A et al.
(2011). The small-scale wave flume data of Dixen et al. (2008) show that for
very low a/ks values, which for their study were in the very rough turbulent
regime, this logarithmic relationship does not apply.

Another interesting WBL aspect is the phase shift of the individual wave
half cycles when all velocity harmonics are considered (see van der A
et al., 2011). As shown in Figure 4b, for measurements at x = 51 m, the
phase lead between the free-stream and near-bed velocities φpos at the
crest-to-trough flow reversal is greater than the phase lead between the
free-stream and near-bed velocities φneg at trough-to-crest flow reversal.
The vertical profiles of phase lead are shown in Figure 6a for the cross-
shore location with highest velocity asymmetry and lowest skewness

phase lead φ between free stream and near bed; (b) intrawave horizontal orbital velocity from bed (dark gray) to free-
stream (light gray), indicating the positive-half cycle (φpos) and negative-half cycle (φneg) phase leads between free-stream
and near-bed velocity x = 51 m.

(x = 53 m at initiation of wave breaking) and the position with highest skewness and lowest asymmetry
(x = 55 m, corresponding to the bar crest location). Figure 6b shows the corresponding profiles of orbital
velocity crest-to-trough duration ratio Tc/Tt; this parameter is equal to one for nonskewed waves and
decreases with increasing velocity skewness.

First, it can be seen that because of positively skewed free-stream velocities, Tc/Tt<1 for both x = 53 m and
x = 55 m in Figure 6b, with a value closer to unity for x = 53 m compared to x = 55 m because of the lower
free-stream velocity skewness at x = 53 m. Second, both profiles of φneg in Figure 6a are similar with weak
vertical variation inside the WBL, whereas the profiles of φpos increase more strongly with proximity to the
bed and reach maximum near-bed values of 38° and 25° at x = 53 m and x = 55m, respectively. The difference
between φpos and φneg, therefore, becomes stronger with proximity to the bed for x = 53 m. This is associated
with a larger reduction in Tc/Tt as a consequence of the higher free-stream velocity asymmetry, hence a larger
transformation of free-stream asymmetry into near-bed velocity skewness (addressed in detail in the follow-
ing section). The correlation between the phase lead difference and the velocity skewness inside theWBL is in
good agreement with the purely asymmetric conditions of van der A et al. (2011) with the difference that in
the present study, the strong change in φpos is at the origin of the increasing phase shift difference, whereas
in van der A et al. (2011) the difference was primarily due to a change in φneg. Another difference with van der
A et al. (2011) is the nonmonotonic profile of φpos and Tc/Tt at x = 53m reaching, respectively, a maximum and
minimum value at z’/a = 0.007. This nonmonotonic trend in phase shift profile has also been observed by
Ruessink et al. (2011) in oscillatory sheet flows. The trend results from the bed mobility, which causes the
bed level to vary at the intrawave scale (discussed further in section 4). The nonmonotonic trend of Tc/Tt is
a direct consequence of the trend observed on φpos profile.

Figure 7a presents the cross-shore evolution of maximum near-bed φpos and φneg values obtained from all
experimental runs between x = 51 m and x = 55.5 m. The maximum values are used rather than the values
at the same fixed near-bed position, because the elevations close to the undisturbed bed are affected by
the bed mobility, as can be seen in Figure 6a for x = 53 m. These bed mobility-affected phase shift values
are not representative of the WBL hydrodynamics and are therefore not used for comparison to the rigid-
bed experiments. Figure 7b shows the corresponding free-stream velocity asymmetry, free-stream velocity
skewness, and their ratio. It can be seen in Figure 7a that φneg has lower values (below 10°) and lower
cross-shore variations than φpos across the shoaling and outer surf zone, with a gently monotonically

increasing trend with x. In contrast, φpos values are 2 to 3 times larger, with stronger nonmonotonic cross-
shore variations compared to φneg. When compared to the cross-shore evolution of the free-stream
parameters (Figure 7b), it can clearly be seen that the variation of the difference in φpos and φneg (as an
indicator of near-bed velocity skewness) closely follows the cross-shore evolution of the ratio between
free-stream velocity asymmetry and free-stream skewness rather than the individual parameters. This
supports the existence of a relation between free-stream asymmetry and near-bed velocity skewness, and
its potential prediction ability using nonlinear free-stream wave characteristics. This WBL mechanism is
addressed in more details in the next section.

3.4. Wave Nonlinearities Inside the WBL

The onshore skewness of the horizontal free-stream wave velocity component is known to be the main con-
tributor to the onshore skewness of the bed shear stress and hence driver for net onshore bedload transport
(Bailard, 1981; King, 1991; Nielsen, 2006; Nielsen & Callaghan, 2003). On the other hand, as shown numerically
by Fuhrman et al. (2009), the wave asymmetry effect (induced by the sawtooth wave shape) on the net
onshore bedload transport has much less impact (even less than the bed slope effect due to the typical con-
vergent shoaling bathymetry). For skewed asymmetric waves propagating across the shoaling and surf
zones, the contribution to the net and skewness of the bed shear stress lies in-between the contribution of
a purely skewed and a purely asymmetric wave field as demonstrated quantitatively in Fuhrman et al.
(2009). However, the internal WBL mechanism leading to the (velocity asymmetry driven) onshore bedload
sand transport has not been addressed. The WBL transformation of velocity asymmetry into bed velocity
skewness proposed by Henderson et al. (2004) offers an interesting explanation of velocity asymmetry driven
bed shear stress. Berni et al. (2013) simplified the model relating the ratio of near-bed to free-stream velocity
skewness to the ratio of free-stream asymmetry to skewness:

Skb
Sk∞

¼ cos φð Þ þ sin φð Þ Asy∞
Sk∞

(1)

where φ corresponds to the first harmonic phase lead as defined in section 3.3. From a practical point of view,
if valid, such amodel offers the possibility to predict more accurately the intrawave orbital velocity at the bed.
This could allow the use of a simple bedload transport model (without any parameterized WBL effects) as

Figure 7. (a) Cross-shore variation of phase shifts φpos and φneg (maximum values in their near-bed profiles, as shown in
Figure 6 for x = 53 m and x = 55 m) between x = 51 m and x = 55.5 m; (b) cross-shore evolution of Asy∞, Sk∞, and Asy∞/Sk∞
between x = 51 m and x = 55.5 m. Values are averaged over all runs per location with associated error bars marking ±1
standard deviation.

long as the velocity skewness at the bed is properly predicted by equa-
tion (1). The validity of equation (1) relies on the assumption of frequency
independence of the phase lead and attenuation factor inside the WBL
over the first three harmonics of the velocity. This model has been tested
successfully for nonbreaking skewed asymmetric waves in low Reynolds
number conditions (Henriquez et al., 2014) and for bichromatic waves at
a single cross-shore position in the inner surf zone (Berni et al., 2013).
While these previous experiments were conducted in small-scale wave
flumes under lower Reynolds number conditions, the model is tested here
for large-scale shoaling and breaking waves driving sheet flow transport.

Figure 3 (right panels) shows the vertical profiles of velocity skewness and
asymmetry at all cross-shore positions. It can be seen that for all locations
velocity skewness increases with proximity to the bed inside the WBL,
while velocity asymmetry decreases with proximity to the bed. The largest
near-bed to free-stream velocity skewness ratio (Skb/Sk∞ ≃2) is found at
x = 53 m, which corresponds to the position of the largest free-stream
asymmetry to free-stream skewness ratio (shown in Figure 8b). This quali-
tatively suggests that the transformation of the wave nonlinearity inside
the WBL follows the tendency given by equation (1). Furthermore, the
skewness and asymmetry profiles measured in the present experiments
are in close agreement with those obtained from previous small-scale
wave flume measurements (Berni et al., 2013; Henriquez et al., 2014).

In order to test quantitatively equation (1) for the near-bed skewness
prediction, Figure 8 shows the ratio of near-bed to free-stream velocity

skewness, Skb/Sk∞, against cos φð Þ þ sin φð Þ Asy∞Sk∞ for all runs across the studied wave-breaking region. The best
least squares linear fit is Skb=Sk∞ ¼ 1:18 cos φð Þ þ sin φð Þ Asy∞Sk∞

h i
, with a squared correlation coefficient

R2 = 0.84; it is represented as a dashed gray line in Figure 8. This corresponds to an 18% overestimation of
the model-predicted values of near-bed velocity skewness. The line corresponding to equation (1) (solid
black line) lies within the ±1 standard deviation (σr, represented as the two gray dotted lines) range around
the best least squares linear fit. The lowest values of free-stream velocity asymmetry to skewness ratio are
seen at x = 55 m (black triangles), which agrees with the position of lowest difference in phase leads φpos
and φneg in Figure 7a. The largest ratio values in Figure 8 correspond to the runs at 53 m where the largest
phase lead asymmetry is indeed observed in Figure 7a. The runs outside or closest to the 1 standard deviation
limits (as the gray dashed dotted lines in Figure 8) are mainly at x = 55.5 m (black diamonds), suggesting that
equation (1) is less robust in the vicinity of the plunge point within the outer surf zone. At this position, wave-
breaking turbulence invades the WBL, as shown in van der Zanden, Hurther, et al., 2017; Figure 3c), affecting
directly the orbital wave velocity field. When these outliers are excluded from the best fit, the linear regres-
sion has a squared correlation coefficient R2 = 0.93. The observed 18% overestimation can also be attributed
to the difficulty to accurately measure velocity skewness with an ACVP resolution of 1.5 mm in the near-bed
region of strong vertical velocity gradient.

It can be concluded that the model of Henderson et al. (2004) gives a reasonable prediction of the near-bed
velocity skewness across the sheet flow-dominated wave-breaking region.

4. Sheet Flow Sediment Dynamics

This section focuses on the detailed sheet flow sediment dynamics across the wave-breaking region and
compares results against those obtained in previous large-scale oscillatory flow tunnel experiments
(Dohmen-Janssen et al., 2001; Dohmen-Janssen & Hanes, 2002; Hassan & Ribberink, 2005; O’Donoghue &
Wright, 2004a, 2004b; Ribberink & Al-Salem, 1994; van der A et al., 2010) and from large-scale nonbreaking
surface wave experiments over horizontal sand beds (Dohmen-Janssen & Hanes, 2002; Ribberink et al.,
2001; Schretlen, 2012; Schretlen et al., 2009). First, the intrawave and maximum erosion depth and sheet flow
layer thickness are investigated and compared to predictions from existing empirical equations. Second, the

intrawave sediment concentration dynamics inside the sheet flow layer are explored, with particular focus on
concentrations within the pickup layer and estimates of reference height and reference concentration.
Whether wave breaking affects these internal sheet flow properties in comparison to oscillatory sheet flows
is of specific interest here. Third, the intrawave and net sand flux and its decomposition into current, waveand
turbulent contributions are examined. Finally, the ACVP-measured sheet flow transport rates across the
wave-breaking region are compared to estimates of model-predicted net transport rates using a simple
Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948)-type formulation.

4.1. Erosion Depth δe and Sheet Flow Layer Thickness δs

The erosion depth is measured directly from the undisturbed bed level detection performed with the ACVP (see
section 2). This directmethod differs from the one using concentrationmeasurements obtainedwith conductivity-
based technology, which relies on the fitting of a prescribed power law profile to themeasured concentration pro-
file (Lanckriet et al., 2014; Mieras et al., 2017a; O’Donoghue & Wright, 2004a; van der Zanden et al., 2015).

Figures 9a–9e present the intrawave erosion depth�δe(t/T) and the suspension layer interface δu(t/T) for the
five locations of interest. For all locations, it can first be noticed that the erosion depth �δe(t/T) increases at
the beginning of each flow half cycle as sediment is mobilized and reduces after maximum velocities have
been reached and sediment is deposited. This general behavior of�δe(t/T) is qualitatively similar to measure-
ments from the sheet flow experiments of O’Donoghue and Wright (2004a).

For velocity-skewed oscillatory flows, O’Donoghue and Wright (2004a) found shorter and slightly larger ero-
sion to occur during the wave crest compared to longer and slightly smaller erosion during the wave trough.
Figures 9 and 10 confirm this behavior for the present experiments at most locations (except at x = 54.5 m
where erosion during crest and trough are of similar magnitude). However, it should be noted that the differ-
ences in erosion depths between crest and trough are small and within the margin of error (Figure 10).

The maximum intrawave erosion depth systematically lags the free-stream maximum velocity by about 20°

(with a lag Δt/T≈ 0.06). This is reasonably close to the erosion depth phase lag obtained with the relation
Φδe = 0.1θmax of O’Donoghue and Wright (2004a), which gives here a maximum value of 15

° for θ max =
2.5. The minimum values of intrawave erosion depth are about �1.5 mm and occur at crest-to-trough flow
reversals for all positions.

The height of the suspension interface δu(t/T) is maximum at the phase of maximum velocity but is not zero at
flow reversal, which might be due to (a) phase lag effects related to the settling suspended load or (b) non-
local suspended sediment advection processes, as indicated in van der Zanden, Hurther, et al. (2017). The lat-
ter process is especially important at x = 55.5 m, where the local undisturbed bed level increases steadily
between t/T = 0.2 and 0.4, that is, between the passage of the wave crest and flow reversal (Figure 9e).
During this stage, horizontal sand influxes from adjacent onshore and offshore locations to x = 55.5 m lead
to a local “compression” of suspended sand and to a net deposition (see van der Zanden, Hurther, et al., 2017;
Figure 15). This only occurs at x = 55.5 m and not at the other locations, as seen in Figure 9, because this loca-
tion is on the shoreward face of the breaker bar, where a strong undertow produces a large and steady
offshore-directed suspended sand flux (van der Zanden, van der A, et al., 2017). Also note that despite phase
leads of velocity near the bed, and the associated expected phase lead of the bed shear stress and pickup, the
sheet flow layer thickness does not lead the free-stream velocity. This is physically explained because the
total vertical flux resulting from pickup and sand settling fluxes becomes negative only after a certain time
lag with respect to the instant of maximum pickup (Nielsen et al., 2002).

Figures 9f–9j show the intrawave sheet flow layer thickness (corresponding to the gray zone in Figures 9a–
9e), estimated as δs(t/T) = δe(t/T) + δu(t/T). For all cross-shore positions, δs(t/T) is larger at wave crest than at
wave trough. Similar to previous wave flume observations involving medium sand (Dohmen-Janssen &
Hanes, 2002; Mieras et al., 2017a; Schretlen et al., 2009), the phase lag of δs(t/T) relative to free-stream velocity
becomes negligible despite the weak phase lag seen in δe(t/T). The nonzero δs(t/T) at the flow reversals can be
explained by the ongoing settling of the suspended sand at the flow reversals or by the steady sand advec-
tion induced by the undertow current as discussed above.

Based on oscillatory sheet flow measurements, empirical models have been proposed for maximum half-
cycle erosion depth as a function of maximum half-cycle Shields number θmax. As in van der Zanden et al.

10.1029/2018JC014406Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans

FROMANT ET AL. 87



(2016), distinction is made between crest and trough erosion, δe, max (crest) and δe, max(trough). The
corresponding Shields number θmax at wave crest and trough are calculated using the methodology
described in Ribberink (1998), which accounts for wave-plus-current contributions. The formulation
proposed by Ribberink et al. (2008) is considered here:

δe;max
d50

¼ 3:7 θmax (2)

Figure 10 compares measured δe, max/d50 values with those obtained using equation (2). Note that in this fig-
ure and similar ones presented later, we used a constant d50 = 0.249 mm for normalization at all cross-shore
locations. Predictions obtained with equation (2) return an overall rather poor agreement with measured
maximum erosion depth values, except for the crest erosion depths where the measurements broadly follow
the prediction trend. The discrepancies between model estimates and measured values are largest for wave
trough erosion depths, with smaller model predictions values. For most of these events, θmax is generally less
than one, which corresponds to a transition regime between bedform and sheet flow transport. This interval
lies outside the range of applicability of equation (2).

Similarly, sheet flow layer thickness δs, max at wave troughs and crests are
compared with values calculated using the empirical equation of
Ribberink et al. (2008),

δs;max

and Schretlen (2012),

based on large-scale oscillatory flow tunnel and nonbreaking wave
experiments, respectively.

Measured and predicted δs, max(crest) and δs, max(trough) are presented
in Figure 11. As expected, measured and predicted values are in closest
agreement at x = 51 m. At this location sand transport is controlled by
local bed friction processes, with negligible impact from wave-breaking
turbulence, as shown in van der Zanden et al. (2016). The largest scatter
relative to the empirical formulae occurs for δs, max(crest) at x = 55 m
and x = 55.5 m. This suggests a local impact of wave-breaking-induced
turbulence, which was shown to be maximum at x = 56 m in van der
Zanden et al. (2016).

4.2. Internal Sheet Flow Structure

The internal structure of the sheet flow layer and its cross-shore variation in the wave-breaking region are
investigated on the basis of the intrawave and time-averaged concentrationmeasurements and comparisons
with corresponding observations from large-scale oscillatory flow tunnel experiments.
4.2.1. Pickup Layer
Figures 12a and 12b show an example of intrawave erosion depth with the corresponding intrawave concen-
trations at different elevations, respectively. As reviewed in Ribberink et al. (2008), oscillatory sheet flows
exhibit a vertical two-layer structure, comprising a lower pickup layer and an upper sheet flow layer. In the

pickup layer, sand grains constituting the moveable bed at rest are
entrained as a consequence of bed erosion. As a result, with increasing
flow velocity the local concentration decreases from the maximum value
corresponding to the undisturbed bed concentration (close to 55% in
volumetric concentration). This leads to an antiphase behavior between
intrawave concentration and free-stream velocity (Ribberink et al., 2008).
The upper sheet flow layer is defined as the flow region in which the
intrawave sand concentration is in phase with the free-stream wave velo-
city, as a result of increasing sand entrainment into a region of negligible
concentration when no flow is applied. As shown in O’Donoghue and
Wright (2004a), the top of the pickup layer in oscillatory sheet flow is found
to correspond to the elevation of minimum variation in intrawave
concentration, separating the lower antiphase from the upper in-phase
concentration layers.

Figure 12c presents the vertical profile of the standard deviation of intra-
wave concentration normalized by the local mean concentration, cstd
¼ std cð Þ=c , at x = 54.5 m. It can be seen that at the maximum erosion
depth of z = �7 mm, the intrawave concentration variation vanishes to
zero. Above this position, a local minimum is found at z = zp≈ 0.6 mm.
This height corresponds to the top of the pickup layer, as verified in
Figure 12d, which shows that this elevation corresponds to the pivot point
of the concentration profile (normalized by the undisturbed bed concen-
tration value c0 ≈ 0.6 m

3/m3) separating the upper, in-phase layer and

the lower, antiphase layer (O’Donoghue & Wright, 2004a). The vertical two-layer structure comprising lower
pickup layer below the pivot level and upper sheet flow layer above the pivot level, found at x = 54.5 m, was
observed for all other cross-shore positions. It appears that the sheet flow structure generated under shoaling
and breaking waves is similar to that seen previously in oscillatory flow tunnel experiments (O’Donoghue &
Wright, 2004a, 2004b).
4.2.2. Reference Height and Concentration
As proposed in O’Donoghue and Wright (2004a), the local minimum in cstd at the top of the pickup layer
makes this height ideal for the reference height (zp) and reference concentration (cp) in concentration profile
models. Moreover, the relative independency of the normalized pickup concentration cp ≈ 0.44 and height zp
with varying flow forcing and sediment properties reduces the number of model parameters to two (instead
of three) as the erosion depth and the reference concentration values as shown in O’Donoghue and
Wright (2004a).

To see if this model simplification also applies to our wave flume measurements, we investigate whether the
pickup height zp and normalized pickup concentration cp have similar properties as in oscillatory flow tunnel
sheet flows. Figure 13 presents the cross-shore variation of zp and cp. Mean zp (Figure 13a) values, equal to the
average value over all runs at each cross-shore position, vary between �0.5 mm and 1.5 mm. The zp
decreases between x = 51 m and x = 54.5 m and increases until the plunge point at x = 55.5 m. The corre-
sponding cross-shore variation of cp (Figure 13b) exhibits an opposite behavior: cp increases from ≈0.5 to
≈0.6 between x = 51 m and x = 54.5 m and decreases abruptly at the plunge point. High spreading of both
parameters is observed at x = 55m, corresponding to the cross-shore position of highest horizontal gradients
in near-bed velocity, as shown in van der Zanden et al. (2016). The strong cross-shore variability in reference
height zp and concentration cp suggests that breaking-generated turbulence in the outer surf zone tends to

increase pickup heights with correspondingly lower reference concentra-
tion values, as a consequence of more effective (and temporally homoge-
neous) vertical turbulent sedimentmixing. Compared to the fairly constant
value of 0.44 found in oscillatory flow tunnel sheet flows by O’Donoghue
and Wright (2004a), the observed cp values of around 0.5 agree reasonably
well for the cross-shore positions (x = 51 m to 55 m).

4.3. Sand Flux Dynamics

Figure 14 shows an example of the intrawave and time-averaged profiles
of (wave plus current) horizontal velocity, concentration, and sand flux at
x = 54.5 m. Here profiles are represented as a function of z, instead of z

0
,

in order to appreciate the intrawave bed erosion dynamics. The intrawave
undisturbed bed level and the level of the suspension interface are also
shown. The time-averaged velocity profile in Figure 14b shows the
offshore-directed undertow profile above the WBL of about �0.3 m/s.
Inside the sheet flow layer (z< 5 mm), a weak WBL streaming can be seen,
inducing a thin layer of onshore- and offshore-directed current inside the
pickup layer. As discussed in detail by van der Zanden et al. (2016), both
undertow current and WBL streaming are observed with increasing and
decreasing magnitudes, respectively, between 51 m and 54.5 m. For
x≥55 m, no onshore WBL streaming can be observed in the sheet flow
layer due to the dominant undertow which reaches values up to
�0.5 m/s at 55.5 m.

Figure 14e first reveals the much higher magnitudes of the bedload flux at intrawave scale compared to the
flux magnitude reached in the upper suspension layer (>1 order of magnitude). In mean, however, this near-
bed representation of the fluxes can be misleading, since as shown by van der Zanden, Hurther, et al. (2017)
for x≥ 53 m, the net suspended sand transport rate (i.e., covering the entire water column up to the wave
crest) and the net bedload transport rate have the same order of magnitude but have opposite direction.
This was also shown by Mieras et al. (2017b) for a wider range of shoaling wave conditions.

Figure 14e also shows the strongly positively skewed intrawave sand flux profiles represented by the higher
onshore fluxmagnitude at the wave crest (around t/T = 0.1) compared to the weaker offshore flux at the wave
trough (at t/T = 0.8). The corresponding total (bedload plus suspension) net flux profile in Figure 14f reveals a
complex three-layer vertical structure of the net sand flux over the first 10 mm above the bed, as superim-
posed regions of alternating onshore, offshore, and onshore net fluxes. This aspect and its cross-shore depen-
dence is addressed in the following section.
4.3.1. Intrawave and Net Sheet Flow Flux Dynamics
For comparison with results obtained in oscillatory sheet flow by O’Donoghue and Wright (2004b), the
vertical structure of the sheet flow sand flux is first investigated on the basis of the net profiles
(Figures 15b, 15d, 15f, 15h, and 15j) calculated as follows:

Φ zð Þ ¼ ∫10Φ δe ≤ z ≤ δu; t=Tð Þdt=T (5)

with Φ(δe ≤ z ≤ δu, t/T) = hcui as the total intrawave sediment flux restricted to the sheet flow layer (with the
〈…〉 representing the phase average, used explicitly here; see section 2). The profile obtained at x = 51 m
(Figure 15b) shows a simple vertical structure composed of a single onshore-oriented layer extending over
the entire sheet flow layer. This type of profile corresponds to the one observed for coarse sand under
velocity-skewed oscillatory flows, named type 3 in O’Donoghue and Wright (2004b). In terms of hydrody-
namic conditions, this cross-shore position (x = 51 m) in the shoaling region is the closest to oscillatory
flow tunnel conditions since wave-breaking effects and undertow currents are weak and the velocity
asymmetry transforms into a mainly velocity-skewed flow inside the pickup layer (shown in section 3.4,
Figure 3 at x= 51 m). Moreover, if velocity asymmetry is not completely reduced to zero at the bed location,
this contributes to an increase in the phase lead of maximum bed shear stress in the crest half cycle, as
previously shown by Nielsen (2006) and Ruessink et al. (2011) for skewed asymmetric oscillatory flows. To

lution of the reference concentration cp values (a, b) are averaged over all

conclude on the hydrodynamic difference with oscillatory flow, in the absence of phase lag effects, onshore-
directed WBL streaming under progressive waves contributes to onshore sand transport, as supported by the
profile shape in Figure 15b.

The absence of phase lag effects suggested by the profile shape at x = 51 m differs from the observations
made by O’Donoghue and Wright (2004b) for well-sorted medium-sized sand. In order to verify this aspect,
Figures 15b, 15d, 15f, 15h, and 15j show the profiles of net sheet flow sand flux decomposed by

uc ¼ u c þ ~u~c þ u0c0 (6)

where the three terms on the right-hand side of equation (6) correspond to the current, wave, and turbulence
contributions to the flux. First, it can be seen that at x = 51 m, the current and turbulent sand fluxes are
weaker than the wave-driven flux, except in the pickup layer where the onshore-directed current dominates.
Second, the wave-driven flux is fully onshore-directed, which is expected for skewed waves in the absence of
concentration phase lag effects. This specific point can be analyzed by the representation in Figures 15a, 15c,
15e, 15g, and 15i of the depth-integrated intrawave sheet flow flux, calculated as

bΦ t=Tð Þ ¼ ∫δu t=Tð Þδe t=Tð ÞΦ z; t=Tð Þdz (7)
O’Donoghue andWright (2004b) demonstrated that despite strongly velocity-skewed oscillatory flows, phase
lag effects reduce the sand flux asymmetry between the positive and negative flow half cycles because of the
transport in the offshore direction of (fine) sand picked up during themore dynamic positive flow half cycle. It
can be seen in Figures 15a, 15c, 15e, 15g, and 15i that the strong asymmetry between the crest and trough

flux suggest an absence of strong phase lag effects for the present experiment. Additionally, no peak in
concentration was measured around the flow reversal, as identified in (for example) Foster et al. (1994) as
a possible consequence of shear instability effects in oscillatory sheet flows before flow reversal.

The profiles of total flux observed at x = 53m to x = 55m (solid black lines in Figures 15d, 15f, and 15h) exhibit
similarly shaped profiles of more complex vertical structure, consisting of three distinct layers: (i) an onshore-
directed lowest layer, which varies in thickness depending on the cross-shore position (maximum at
x = 54.5 m where it covers the entire pickup layer) followed by (ii) an offshore-directed layer (maximum at
x = 55 m where it covers the upper part of the pickup layer and a fraction of the upper sheet flow layer),
and (iii) an onshore-directed layer at the transition between the sheet flow and suspension layers. At
x = 55 m, the near-bed turbulence-driven component is weaker close to the bed, which results in a negligible
net onshore flux, giving the appearance of a two-layer structure with the thickness of the lowest layer nearly

zero. Following the profile classification proposed in O’Donoghue and
Wright (2004b), this shape is identical to their type 2 for sheet flows of
medium-sized sands. Whether the layer of offshore-directed net flux is
here induced by phase lag effects is explored from the decomposed net
fluxes presented in Figures 15b, 15d, 15f, 15h, and 15j. It can be seen that
the change in vertical structure at x = 53 to 55 m, relative to x = 51 m,
results from the higher offshore-directed undertow current at these loca-
tions. All wave-driven and turbulent fluxes remain onshore-directed over
the entire sheet flow layer. In the upper sheet flow and lower pickup layers,
the wave plus turbulence induced flux dominates the total flux, while the
current-driven flux is stronger in between. The result is a complex three-
layer structure of the net total flux with altering directions. The intrawave
sheet flow fluxes at x = 53 m to x = 55 m show a reduced asymmetry
between crest and trough levels compared to x = 51 m, despite the strong
velocity skewness. This possibly relates to the offshore-directed undertow,
which leads to an increase in bed shear stress during the offshore half
cycle and a reduction in bed shear stress during the onshore half cycle.

At x = 55.5 m, the intrawave flux and the vertical profile of time-averaged
flux (Figures 15i and 15j) differ greatly in shape and magnitude compared
to the corresponding results for the other locations. The intrawave flux in
Figure 15i reveals strongly reduced wave-driven flux at intrawave scale
compared to the other locations, due to a reduced orbital amplitude as

a result of breaking-induced wave energy dissipation. The net total flux is close to zero as a consequence
of high onshore-directed turbulent sand flux, compensating the sum of the offshore-directed wave- and
undertow-driven flux. The turbulent sand flux may be linked to the wave plunger impact, but locally bed-
friction-generated turbulence may be equally important since the net turbulent flux magnitudes at
x = 55.5 m are similar to those observed at the other cross-shore locations.
4.3.2. Net Bedload Transport Rates
In order to test if wave breaking affects predictions of net bedload transport rate, the half-wave-averaged
sediment transport rates Qc (crest) and Qt (trough) inside the sheet flow layer are calculated as

where the spatial integral corresponds to the intrawave net sheet flow flux represented in Figure 15. From

with g = 9.81 m/s2 the acceleration due to gravity and s the ratio of sediment to water density. This metho-
dology of net (half-wave cycle) transport rate calculation has recently been applied by Cheng et al. (2017) to
explore the impact of momentary bed failure effects in oscillatory sheet flows. The values obtained here for all
runs and cross-shore positions are compared in Figure 16 to the well-known Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948)
formulation (MPM) for bedload transport, given by

Ψ ¼ M0 θmax � θcð ÞN0 (11)

This model is considered to be accurate when bed friction drives bedload transport and in the absence of bed
forms (as in the conditions studied herein). In equation (11), θc = 0.05 represents the critical Shields number
value for the medium-sized sand used here. Values of M0 = 8 and N0 = 1.5, as originally proposed by

symbols) dimensionless net flux versus the effective onshore and offshore
Shields numbers at each cross-shore position. Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948)

Meyer-Peter andMüller (1948), are used because more recently proposed values (e.g., Ribberink, 1998) do not
give an overall better agreement. The Shields number used in equation (11) for the model-predicted half-
cycle sediment fluxes is calculated as in section 4.1.

Rather than assessing the predictive power of MPM predictor, the present comparison between measured
(equation (10)) and predicted (equation (11)) sand transport rates aims to qualify whether (or not) bed fric-
tion drives bedload transport, thus suggesting weak (potential) impact from the wave breaking on the bed-
load transport. First, it can be seen in Figure 16 that the measured transport rates at x = 51 m and x = 53 m
give the best agreement with the MPM predictor, for both crest and trough flux, in spite of the relative
scatter of the data. This is likely due to the bedload transport being locally controlled by bed friction pro-
cesses, with negligible effect from the wave breaking. At x = 54.5 m, the trough-averaged flux is still in rea-
sonable agreement with MPM but the crest values become systematically lower than the MPM predictions
by more than a factor of 2. The crest value discrepancy becomes maximum at x = 55.5 m under the impact
of the plunger except at x = 55 m, where large discrepancies affect the trough-averaged fluxes that are
larger than the model results, rather than crest associated values. It can be deduced from Figure 16 that
for x ≥ 54.5 m, wave breaking is suspected to have substantial effects on bedload transport (van der
Zanden et al., 2016, 2018), hence the poor agreement of the MPM predictor at these cross-shore locations;
an improved predictor would require velocity asymmetry and breaking-induced effects to be included in a
parametrized way.

5. Conclusions

WBL hydrodynamics and sheet flow properties have been investigated under regular, large-scale, plunging-
type breaking waves using acoustic high-resolution profile measurements of velocities and sand concentra-
tions provided by the ACVP technology. Because acoustic measurements are usually limited to suspension
layer profiling, a validation of the acoustic sheet flow measurements was first carried out using CCM+ data
as reference measurements, collected at a fixed position in the outer surf zone. The acoustic measurement
of intrawave andmaximum erosion depth, as well as the sheet flow layer thickness, were found to be in good
quantitative agreement with the CCM+ measurements. The intrawave concentration fields depict similar
internal sheet flow dynamics as the CCM+, showing antiphase and in-phase behaviors in the pickup and
upper sheet flow layers, respectively. The direct acoustic estimation of the net sheet flow transport rate
was within 25% of that estimated using the CCM+. Considering the much lower spatial resolution of the
acoustic technology (1.5 mm) and the very different sampling and averaging methodologies applied in the
twomeasurement systems, this level of agreement is considered to validate the acoustic sheet flowmeasure-
ments. The ACVP was subsequently used to measure WBL hydrodynamics and sheet flow processes at five
cross-shore locations across the outer wave-breaking region over a medium-sand breaker bar. The following
are the main results for the hydrodynamics:

1. The free-stream intrawave velocity measurements reveal the presence of strongly skewed asymmetric
waves across the wave-breaking region. The maximum intrawave WBL thickness is found to be slightly
lower during the short-duration wave crest half cycles than during the longer-duration trough half cycles
as expected in the presence of skewed asymmetrical waves.

2. For all cross-shore positions, the measured first harmonic velocity phase lead φ lies in the range of 10–20°.
When presented as a function of local dimensionless semiexcursion a/ks in comparison to existing full-
scale oscillatory sheet flow data found in the literature, the measured φ values lie in the region of the loga-
rithmic decay as seen in Figure 5 (van der A et al., 2011). This confirms a fully turbulent flow regime across
the wave-breaking region.

3. The wave nonlinearity transformation inside the WBL is tested quantitatively by the application of the
model proposed by Henderson et al. (2004). Themodel-predicted ratio of near-bed to free-stream velocity
skewness was found to follow the measured value with a mean overestimation of 18% for all positions
across the studied wave-breaking region. This level of agreement is attributed to the fully established tur-
bulent flow regime at all cross-shore positions. This flow regime is representative for breaking waves in
the natural environment.
The following are the main results for the sheet flow sediment dynamics:

4. Erosion depth and sheet flow layer thickness exhibit similar intrawave dynamics as previously observed in
flow tunnel experiments with skewed oscillatory sheet flows. The internal sheet flow layer structure

10.1029/2018JC014406Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans

reveals the existence of a lower pickup layer and an upper sheet flow layer. The top of the pickup layer
corresponds to the height of minimal intrawave concentration variability, which corresponds to the loca-
tion of a pivotal point in the intrawave concentration profiles.

5. Pivot point elevation and time-averaged concentration at the pivot point are in good agreement with the
corresponding values reported by O’Donoghue and Wright (2004b) for skewed oscillatory flow sheet
flows. However, at the plunge point, the pivot elevation is higher and the time-averaged concentration
is lower compared to the measurements at the other cross-shore locations. At this plunge point, van
der Zanden et al. (2018) recently showed that the plunging breaker-induced turbulent kinetic energy is
affecting the entire water column down into the bottom WBL (see their Figures 5i and 5j) confirming
locally increased turbulent mixing affecting the sheet flow layer. Making use of the full measurement per-
formance of the ACVP technology, the total sheet flow sand transport rate was decomposed into current-,
wave- and turbulence-driven components, with the following main results:

6. In the shoaling zone, the time-averaged sediment flux profile exhibits a single layer vertical structure of
purely onshore-directed transport over the entire sheet flow layer. This total transport is shown to be
dominated by the wave-driven component, with negligible current and turbulence-driven contributions.
Furthermore, the onshore-directed wave-driven transport and the positively skewed intrawave bedload
transport rate strongly suggest the absence of phase lag effects in these experiments.

7. In the outer surf zone, except at the location of the plunge point, the net flux profile in the sheet flow layer
is composed of a three-layer vertical structure with alternating onshore-, offshore- and onshore-directed
layers. The offshore-directed flux layer is driven by the undertow, not by phase lag effects.

8. At the plunge point, the turbulence-driven onshore component balances the combined contributions of
the offshore-directed wave- and undertow-driven components, resulting in a negligibly low net bedload
sand transport rate. Compared to the other positions, this is attributed mainly to the strong reduction of
the wave-driven sand flux as a possible consequence of breaking-induced wave energy dissipation via
turbulent cascading processes (see Figure 11a in van der Zanden et al., 2018).

9. Applying the same methodology as Cheng et al. (2017), the half-cycle net bedload transport rate was
compared to predicted net transport using the Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948) formula. For the farthest
offshore positions (x = 51 m and x = 53 m), the crest- and trough- transport rates are in relative good
agreement with the empirical model predictions. Elsewhere, the agreement is less good, indicating that
a solely bed friction-based bedload model is inadequate for the present study conditions, where addi-
tional factors such as wave breaking may influence bedload transport.

The detailed hydrodynamic WBL and sheet flow measurements reported here under large-scale breaking
waves constitute a useful high-resolution data set for the improvement and validation of fine-scale numerical
simulations of cross-shore sand transport in an energetic wave-breaking region.
