Abstract. A methodology to assess storm-induced coastal
vulnerability taking into account the different induced pro-
cesses separately (inundation and erosion) is presented. It is
based on a probabilistic approach where hazards time series
are built from existing storm data and later used to fit an ex-
treme probability function. This is done for different sectors
along the coast defined in terms of the wave climate and for
representative beach types of the area to be analyzed. Once
probability distributions are available, coastal managers must
decide the probability of occurrence to be accepted as well as
the period of concern of the analysis in function of the impor-
tance of the hinterland. These two variables will determine
the return period to be considered in the assessment. The
comparison of hazards and vulnerabilities associated with the
selected probability of occurrence permit to identify the most
hazardous areas along the coast in a robust manner by in-
cluding the spatial variability in forcing (storm climate) and
receptor (beaches). The methodology has been applied to
a 50 km long coastal stretch of the Catalonia (NW Mediter-
ranean) where offshore wave conditions can be assumed to
be homogeneous. In spite of this spatially constant wave
field, obtained results indicate a large variability in hazards
intensity and vulnerability along the coast.

1 Introduction

The coastal zone is subjected to different natural hazards that
can produce important economic and environmental dam-
ages (e.g., Pérez-Maqueo et al., 2007). Among them, storm-
induced inundation and erosion are very frequent along
coasts worldwide. Due to this, it should be relevant to assess

the vulnerability of coastal systems to storm impacts to pro-
vide decision-makers information about their potential con-
sequences to apply mitigation and/or adaptation strategies on
the coastal zone (see e.g., Godschalk et al., 1989).

The importance of including hazards and vulnerability as-
sessments in coastal zone policies has been highlighted dur-
ing the last years. One example is the recently signed (Jan-
uary 2008) Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management
in the Mediterranean (PAP/RAC 2007), which specifically
recommends countries to undertake vulnerability and haz-
ard assessments to address the effects of natural disasters in
coastal zones.

In this work, vulnerability is defined as the potential of a
coastal system to be harmed by the impact of a storm (see
e.g., Gouldby and Samuels, 2005), and it is quantified by
comparing the magnitude of the impact with the adaptation
capacity of the system. In simple terms, the impact is char-
acterised by the intensity of storm-induced coastal processes,
whereas the adaptation ability is defined by the beach physi-
cal properties determining the capacity to cope with consid-
ered impacts.

A storm can be defined in a simple manner as a violent at-
mospheric perturbation that when occurs at the sea, the most
immediate effects are the increase in wave height and some-
times sea level (storm surge). In this work, a storm is con-
sidered as a wave event exceeding a significant wave height,
Hs, value of 2 m, during a minimum period of 6 h. This cri-
terion was proposed by Mendoza and Jiménez (2008) as the
minimum conditions required to generate a significant im-
pact along the Catalan coast.

The most common coastal storm-induced processes are in-
undation and erosion. These two processes represent a po-
tential for harm and can therefore be defined as hazards.
Because the intensity of each of these coastal hazards de-
pends on different storm properties and beach characteristics,
they will not necessarily be equally important during a given

storm event. Moreover, their induced damages in the coastal
zone are also different and, in consequence, managers should
be interested to know which the dominant hazard for a given
event is. Therefore, the developed methodology allows the
evaluation of the coastal vulnerability to these two processes
separately.

Within this framework, the main objectives of this work
are: (i) to present a methodology to assess coastal vulner-
ability to storm-induced erosion and inundation at regional
scale, and (ii) to apply it to the Catalan coast.

2 Study area and data

The Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean, Fig. 1) is about
600 km long and it comprises a large diversity of coastal
types such as cliffs, bay beaches, long straight beaches
and deltas, with about 270 km being composed by beaches
(CADS, 2005). Along the Catalan coast, there are 70 muni-
cipalities which represent the 7% of the surface of Catalo-
nia but support the 44% of the total population, with a mean
density of 1324 pop km−2. The socio-economic structure is
based on typical coastal activities such as commerce, agri-
culture and residential developments, with tourism being the
dominant one (Sardá et al., 2005).

In this study two types of data have been used: wave data
to characterize the storms and beach geomorphologic vari-
ables to characterize the receptor. They are briefly described
in what follows.

Storm characteristics along the Catalan coast have been
defined by using wave conditions at five sectors (Fig. 1).
Two types of wave data were available: (i) instrumental
data recorded by nearshore wave buoys deployed at depths
between 40 m and 90 m that have been operating since the
end of the 1980s, and (ii) hindcast data covering the period

(Guedes-Soares et al., 2002).

For each sector, representative time series of annual max-
imum storms have been built. They have been defined in
terms of significant wave height at the peak of the storm
(Hs max), associated peak period (Tp max), direction and storm
duration. As mentioned before, in this work a wave storm
is defined as an event where Hs exceeds a threshold value
of 2 m during a minimum duration of 6 h (Mendoza and
Jiménez, 2008). The two types of wave data have been in-
tegrated after calibration of the simulated data to build up
50 years long wave storm time series covering the period
1958–2008.

Information about dimensions and basic characteristics of
about 300 beaches along the Catalan coast has been included
in a GIS database together information about existing uses
and resources. Basic dimensions (width, length, surface, ori-
entation) were obtained from a collection of colour orthopho-
tos at a 1:5000 scale taken at 2004, supplied by the Institut
Cartogràfic de Catalunya (http://www.icc.cat). Beach ele-
vation, beachface slope and sediment grain size data were
acquired during different beach profiling and sediment sam-
pling field campaigns in all beaches during 2008.

3 Vulnerability assessment

3.1 General framework

The proposed methodological framework to assess the
coastal vulnerability to storm impacts is schematised in
Fig. 2. It consists of three main steps: (i) the definition of
the forcing – storms, (ii) the evaluation of induced hazards,
and (iii) the coastal vulnerability assessment.

The practical goal of the methodology is to provide in-
formation to managers to plan on resources’ allocation to
manage/mitigate damages induced by storm impacts at re-
gional scale. In this work, this scale corresponds to a length
of several hundreds of kms where geomorphology and storm
characteristics vary along the coast. From the management
standpoint, it has been selected because comprises an admin-
istrative unit with its own legal competences, which should
be equivalent to a state in a federal republic. There are differ-
ent approaches to coastal vulnerability assessment depending
on different aspects such as the driving process, the scale of
the analysis and the type of considered vulnerability (e.g.,
Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 1998; Pethick and Crooks, 2002; Fer-
reira, 2004; McFadden et al., 2007; Youssef et al., 2009).
When referring to storms, they can assess the coastal vulner-
ability by defining the driver in different ways such as real
wave conditions (Prasad et al., 2009) or storm classes (Men-
doza and Jiménez, 2009).

In this work we have adopted a probabilistic approach
where, the probability of occurrence of induced hazards
along the coast are estimated and, once a risk level is defined
by the manager, the spatial distribution of the expected mag-
nitude of the impact is compared to identify the potentially
most endangered areas. Thus, instead of assessing the vul-
nerability for all beaches induced by a given (single) storm,
the objective is to calculate the vulnerability associated with
a given probability of occurrence at each site. In this ap-
proach, the decision-maker selects the acceptable probability
of occurrence that can vary along the coast, depending on
the characteristics of the hinterland. In the case of selecting
spatially varying risk levels, this should result in comparing
vulnerabilities associated with different probabilities.

3.2 Storms characterization

The first step in the methodology consists of defining the haz-
ards’ forcing, i.e., to characterize storms in the study area.
To do this, a storm data set has to be built using existing
wave data. This data set includes main wave variables defin-
ing such events (Hs, Tp, θ , duration). In extreme analysis,
two main types of approaches can be followed: (i) the POT
(peak-over-threshold) method, where all events with Hs ex-
ceeding a given threshold are considered, and (ii) the annual
maxima method, where only the largest storm of each year is
taken (see e.g., Coles, 2001). In this work, since the dataset
covers a period of 50 years, we have selected the annual max-

ima method because the sample is long enough to perform a
reliable analysis. In this sense, a typical rule-of-thumb in ex-
treme analysis is that the extent of the data set must be at least
one-third of the duration to which wave heights are being ex-
trapolated (Borgman and Resio, 1977). This means that, for
the used data set, the most reliable wave heights will be those
associated up to a return period of 150 years. The annual
maximum storm was calculated for climatic years, i.e., the
period from September to August.

Since two different types of data are available, i.e., hind-
casted (simulated) and measured ones, the first task consisted
of obtaining a transfer function to convert simulated data to
real ones. This was done by applying a regression analysis
to simultaneous data during a certain period. As an example,
Fig. 3 shows the comparison between recorded and simulated
values of Hs at the storm peak for simultaneous annual max-
imum events at sector III. This regression analysis has been
done for all storm parameters (Hs, Tp and duration) and for
all sectors along the coast. Obtained results reflect one of the
potential problems of using hindcast wave data without pre-
vious validation, i.e., their reliability. This is especially im-
portant in the NW Mediterranean that presents short fetches
and where storm events are of limited duration which leads to
model errors in comparison to open ocean predictions (Cav-
aleri and Bertotti, 2004; Bolaños et al., 2007). In spite of
the obtained large dispersion of data around the fitted model
we have used it to transform hindcast wave data and, thus to
have a longer wave time series.

The obtained transformation relationships have been used
to convert simulated data into calibrated (real-like) values.
Finally, resulting 50-years long wave storm time series is
composed by calibrated hindcast data from 1958 to 1989
(when no instrumental data did exist) and recorded data from
1990 until 2008. Figure 4 shows the constructed time series
of storm wave parameters for annual maxima at sector III.

3.3 Coastal hazards parameterization

When an extreme storm impacts on a sandy coast, it pro-
duces different morphodynamic responses which rapidly and
significantly modify the coastal landscape. These processes
and changes are controlled by a combination of different fac-
tors that essentially are storm characteristics and the coastal
geomorphology (e.g., Morton, 2002; Morton and Sallenger,
2003). Having adopted a regional scale approach, we sim-
plify the analysis by retaining the two most important storm-
induced coastal processes, inundation and erosion (Fig. 5).
As these processes are potentially harmful for coastal stabil-
ity and they should affect existing uses and resources, they
are usually considered as hazards. Their magnitude has been
parameterized by selecting a representative indicator includ-
ing information on storm properties (forcing) and beach char-
acteristics (receptor).

Coastal inundation is generally caused by a combination of
high water levels (storm surges plus high tides) and wave ac-
tion, and in consequence, a joint probability analysis of storm
surges and wave run-up should be needed to properly char-

acterize in probabilistic terms the total water level. However,
in this work we have only used the wave-induced run-up be-
cause although storm-surges are not infrequent during East-
ern storms in the Catalan coast (e.g., Jiménez et al., 1997),
their magnitude is much lower than wave-induced run-up
(Mendoza and Jiménez, 2008). Formally, this represents that
the vulnerability to inundation here characterised will refer
to the storm wave-induced component. Thus, the inundation
hazard has been parameterized by using the wave-induced
run-up at the storm peak by using the Stockdon et al. (2006)
model, which is given by

where Hs is the deepwater significant wave height, Lo is the
deepwater wave length associated to the wave peak period,
Tp, and tanβ is the beachface slope. This formula was se-
lected because it was derived specifically for beaches and it
was adjusted by using only field data.

Because beach profiles usually present a change in the
slope, with an inner part of the profile (tanα) being milder
than the one at the beachface (tanβ) a correction factor for
the run-up following van der Meer and Janssen (1995) has
been considered. This correction factor, γ , accounts for the
expected modification in the run-up as waves propagates over
the inner part of the profile and it is given by

γ = tanα/tanβ (2)

which is truncated to values within the interval [0.6, 1]. The
final run-up value is obtained by multiplying the value ob-
tained for the beachface slope (Eq. 1) and the gamma coeffi-
cient (Eq. 2).

On the other hand, the magnitude of the erosion hazard
has been calculated by using the parametric model proposed

where τ is the storm duration, JA is a parameter characteris-
ing beach profile changes proposed by Jiménez et al. (1993),
D = (H/wf) is the dimensionless fall velocity parameter
(Dean, 1973), Deq is its value at equilibrium (2.7 when wave
conditions are specified at deep waters), τ is the storm du-
ration, tanβ is the beach slope, H is the wave height (here
taken as Hs)wf is the sediment fall velocity and T is the
wave period (here taken as Tp). It has to be considered that
this is a simplification of the real beach response to wave
action since the pre-storm beach morphology among other
factors will modulate the induced beach erosion (e.g., Mor-
ton, 2002). However, the objective is not to reproduce the
full response of the beach to the impact of a storm (this is
usually done by numerical modelling) but to estimate an or-
der of magnitude of the expected erosion. In any case, this
relationship was obtained from numerical simulations of the
impact of typical storm conditions and beach characteristics
along the Catalan coast (Mendoza and Jiménez, 2006).

3.4 Coastal hazards time series

Once the parameterization of storm-induced coastal pro-
cesses has been defined, the next step is to obtain represen-
tative time series of each hazard. First, the entire coast is
divided into different geographical sectors where wave con-
ditions during storms can be considered relatively homoge-
neous. These sectors will be used to specify the forcing re-
lated part in each indicator along the coast.

To account for the contribution of beach geomorphology
to vulnerability, existing beaches along the coast have been
grouped into different classes. To this end, all beaches of
the study area have been classified from a morphodynamic
standpoint according to its sediment mean grain size and
slope. They range from reflective (coarse sand and steep
slope) to dissipative (fine sand and mild slope) beaches and

they will modulate the magnitude of the hazards for given
wave conditions. Thus, 6 beach types have been defined with
mean grain size values ranging from 0.1 mm to >1.6 mm in
0.3 mm intervals. For each class, the representative slope is
calculated by averaging actual slope values of all beaches
within the group (Table 1). Since this classification is specific
for the study area, the application of the method to other ge-
ographical zones would require applying the same procedure
to characterize the corresponding representative beaches.

Once we have the storm time series for the different sec-
tors along the coast and the existing beach types, inunda-
tion and erosion hazards time series are built for each coastal
sector and each beach type. This will permit to directly as-
sess spatial and temporal variations of storm-induced hazards
over a period of 50 years for different coastal regions. As an
example, Fig. 6 shows the 50-years hazard’s time series ob-
tained for existing representative beaches along sector III in
the Catalan coast (see Fig. 1).

As it can be seen, obtained time series for inundation
and erosion hazards show a different temporal pattern. This
stresses the importance of evaluating both processes in a sep-
arate manner to identify the dominant process for a given
storm event. Moreover, the relative variation in the hazard
magnitude in function of beach morphology is also different,
with dissipative beaches (type II) presenting the largest val-
ues for erosion and reflective ones (type V) being the most
sensitive to inundation.

and erosion hazards and for different beach types.

3.5 Hazard extreme probability distribution

Once hazards time series have been obtained, an extreme
probability distribution is fitted to the data to characterize
them in probabilistic terms. This has been done following
the “response approach” (see e.g., Divoky and McDougal,
2006) in which the probabilities are directly assigned to the
processes (hazards) and not to the drivers that generate them
(storm). This approximation is especially appropriated when
processes depend on more than one variable (Hs, Tp, dura-
tion) and particularly when this dependence differs between
considered processes (e.g., see Fig. 6).

There exist several functions to define extreme probability
distributions (see e.g., Hawkes et al., 2008). In this study we
have used the Weibull tri-parametric and the Gumbell (Fisher
Typett Type I) distributions, being selected the one present-
ing the best fit. In all the cases, the best fitted distribution was
the Weibull one, with correlation factors larger than 0.96.

As a result of this step, different hazard extreme probabil-
ity distributions are obtained for each location and for each
beach type. This permits to assess the spatial variations in
hazards intensity along different geographical regions and
to compare them in a robust manner (see e.g., Jiménez et
al., 2009). Figure 7 shows the extreme probability distribu-
tions obtained for each hazard at sector III (wave data from
Tordera buoy and valid for the central coast). Results in-
dicate that the highest intensity of the potential inundation
will verify as expected, for the most reflective beaches (beach
type IV) whereas the largest erosion corresponds to the finest
sediment beaches (beach type II). It has to be considered
that the most dissipative beaches (type I) are not likely to be
found in this sector, where the 97% of the existing beaches
fall in the range from types II to VI. The different shape of
variation of run-up and erosion magnitudes between beaches
is due to the fact that the first one is only controlled by one
variable (slope) whereas the second depends on two beach
properties (slope and grain size).

In summary, the obtained results along the coast reflects
the fact that the method is able to quantify the difference in
hazards intensity associated to a given probability of occur-
rence due to wave contribution (coastal sector) and geomor-
phology (beach characteristics). At this point it has to be
stressed that the highest values of hazard intensity do not nec-
essarily imply the highest vulnerability. To convert them, the
capacity of the coastal system to cope with the hazards has to
be taken into consideration. Despite this, this hazard assess-
ment provides the decision-maker with information about the
spatial variation in the intensity of the potential problems and
their probability of occurrence.

3.6 Storm-induced coastal vulnerability

The final step of the methodology consists of including the
ability of the coastal system to cope with the induced impacts
to quantify the vulnerability of the system. In this approach,
the beach response capability has been characterised by using
a beach variable related to each of considered hazards. Thus,
in the case of inundation, the parameter used as a proxy of
the resilience of the beach is the dune or, if absent, the berm
height, because as higher the beach is the smaller the inun-
dation will be. This is formulated in terms of an intermediate
variable:

IV = Ru/Bmax (4)

in which Bmax is the maximum of berm or dune heights.
Similarly, the parameter used to indicate the capacity of

the beach to cope with erosion was the beach width. Thus,
the wider the beach is, the smaller the probability to be fully
eroded (and, in consequence, infrastructures in the hinterland
to be exposed) will be. This is formulated in terms of an
intermediate variable:

EV = 1x/Wav (5)

Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 11, 475–484, 2011 www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/11/475/2011/



E. Bosom and J. A. Jiménez: Probabilistic coastal vulnerability assessment to storms at regional scale 481

where 1x is the storm-induced beach retreat and Wav is
the average beach width. In first approximation, this value
has been obtained by dividing the eroded volume (3) by the
height of the eroded part of the profile, der, (Fig. 5), although
a similar relationship to Eq. (3) formulated for storm-induced
shoreline retreat can also be applied (see e.g., Mendoza and
Jiménez, 2006).

It has to be mentioned that, even in the context of a steady
forcing (storm climate), beach vulnerability could change
due to a change in beach morphology (width and elevation).
To account this potential variation, the coastal database needs
to be updated (periodically and/or after the impact of a signif-
icant event) to properly reflect the beach actual morphology.

The resulting vulnerability to each process is formulated
in terms of these two intermediate variables by means of the
functional relationship shown in Fig. 8. The vulnerability is
scaled in a range from a minimum 0 value (safe beach) to a
maximum of 1 (extreme vulnerable beach), which is divided
in 5 qualitative classes (very low, low, medium, high, very
high).

Here we assume that vulnerability linearly depends on the
intermediate variable with the slope of the curve being a
function of the level of safety of the analysis. Thus, more
conservative analyses (indicating larger vulnerabilities for
the same hazard conditions) will have steeper curves and vice
versa. The slope of the curve depends on the selected value
of the intermediate variables at the end of the range.

In the case of vulnerability to inundation, the minimum
value (0) has been fixed to the situation in which the run-up
magnitude is the half of the actual berm height,

Bmax = 2Ru (6)

whereas the maximum value (1) will occur when the run-up
exceeds by two meters the maximum berm height,

Bmax = Ru−2 (7)

These values have been selected arbitrarily as a function of
the characteristics of the study area and, for the maximum
case, they represent overtopping conditions with significant
water volumes flowing to the hinterland. These values need
to be adapted to specific conditions of the area to be analysed.

In terms of erosion, the maximum vulnerability (1) has
been fixed to the situation in which the beach width equals

The minimum beach width is defined as the required mini-
mum value to maintain the beach operative and/or to avoid
the direct exposure of the hinterland to the sea water. For
instance, this value can be set to the minimum width to let
machinery work along the beach to repair damages in infras-
tructures in the hinterland (e.g., to repair promenades). In

this work, we have selected a value of 5 m to let trucks and
bulldozers operate after storm-induced damages.

On the other hand, the minimum vulnerability (0) will oc-
cur when the average beach width equals the minimum beach
width plus α times the beach retreat (1x),

Wav = Wmin +α1x (9)

The α-factor can be selected as a function of the number of
expected storms of the same intensity per year, and it should
be selected as a function of the wave climate and, also, de-
pending on the level of safety of the analysis. In this work
we have used α = 3.

Finally, in order to obtain the vulnerability values a re-
turn period has to be selected to quantify the hazard intensity
associated with Tr for all beach types and coastal sectors.
The selection of the return period (Tr) used in the vulnera-
bility assessment depends on the level of safety required by
the decision-maker, which depends on the importance of the
hinterland. According to this importance, a probability of
occurrence, R, is selected and then the corresponding return
period is estimated within a given time period of concern,
L. The relationship between these three variables can be ex-
pressed by (Borgman, 1963)

The Spanish Ministry of Public Works recommends a mini-
mum time period of concern of 25 years for coastal protec-
tion and nourishment works (Puertos del Estado, 1990). We
can use this value for the analysis by assuming that beaches
are protecting the hinterland from storm impacts and, as a
consequence, they are behaving as coastal protection works.
At most of the Mediterranean beaches the failure of the beach
regarding protection will not likely cause human losses and

it will have an economic repercussion ranging from low to
medium, which correspond to maximum admissible proba-
bilities, R, of 0.5 and 0.3, respectively (Puertos del Estado,
1990). By substituting these values in Eq. (10), the return
period of the hazards to be considered in the analysis should
vary between 37 and 71 years, respectively. In this exam-
ple, we have selected a return period of 50 years which is the
middle of the estimated range.

The beach vulnerability to storm-induced inundation as-
sociated to a 50 years return period along the central coast
of Catalonia (sector III) is shown in Fig. 9. The study area
is about 46 km long and it is composed by about 59 sandy
beaches. Most of the beaches are composed of coarse sands
and have steep slopes, i.e., they can be classified as reflec-

tive. As a consequence of this, wave-induced run-up will be
high. However, this type of beach is also characterised by
having relatively high berms which would tend to counter-
act the effect of the hazard. This is reflected in the obtained
spatial pattern of vulnerability which essentially reflects vari-
ations in beach height. In this case, about 34% of the coast-
line within the study area is highly or very highly vulnerable
to inundation, whereas about 54% falls into the category of
medium vulnerability. This should indicate that the hinter-
land in this area is prone to be affected by inundation and, in
fact, problems of overtopping are relatively frequent.

Figure 10 shows the beach vulnerability assessment to
storm-induced erosion associated to a 50 years return pe-
riod. In this case, obtained results show an area of relatively

low vulnerability, on one hand, because the expected erosion
for these beaches is relatively small and, on the other hand,
many of them are very wide. This is reflected in the fact
that only about 20% of the coastline falls into the category
of medium vulnerability or higher. The area with the high-
est vulnerability is located at the S, where beaches are com-
posed by finer sediments and are relatively narrow. In situ
observations of storm impacts in the area indicate that some
locations in the N have been affected by erosion during the
last years. This apparent disagreement between predictions
and reality is probably due to the use of the average beach
width as the variable coping with erosion, whereas problems
should occur if at least one part of the beach is narrower than
the expected erosion. This should indicate that for safety
purposes, the vulnerability assessment here presented should
be complemented with one using the minimum beach width
to obtain the intermediate variable (Eq. 5). In the southern
part of the area, where highly vulnerable beaches dominate,
the main contribution to such high values is the decrease in
beach width due to medium-term erosion downcoast of exist-
ing marinas. To reduce the effect of this erosion, the Spanish
Ministry of Environment has supplied about 13 millions of
m3 of sand in this sector since 1987.

Another point to be considered in this kind of analysis is
that vulnerability assessment needs to be updated as beaches
evolve. As it was previously mentioned, the intensity of the
hazard and the capacity of the beach to cope with it depend
on the pre-storm morphology. Thus, if coastal managers
want to have a reliable estimation of coastal vulnerability
to storm impacts, any assessment method as presented here,
needs to be complemented with a coastal monitoring plan.

4 Summary and conclusions

With the developed methodology, storm-induced coastal vul-
nerability can be evaluated by taking into account the differ-
ent induced processes separately (inundation and erosion).
This is an important aspect because although they are related,
they do not depend in the same way on storm characteris-
tics and, also because they induce different damages in the
coastal zone.

The adopted probabilistic approach permits a robust com-
parison of coastal vulnerability at regional scale to allocate
existing resources for mitigating/managing damages. Thus,
once an accepted probability is defined by the manager, the
comparison of hazards and vulnerabilities associated to the
same probability of occurrence will permit the identifying of
the most hazardous areas. Hazards associated to the selected
probability do not necessarily correspond to the same storm
event and, thus, the analysis includes the spatial variability in
the storm climate along the coast.

One of the aspects to be considered in applying the pro-
posed methodology is the need of long time series of wave
data to obtain reliable extreme distributions of considered

hazard parameters. Since this is not likely to occur for most
of the coasts worldwide, one of the usual ways to solve
this problem is the use of hindcast data as it has been done
here. However, it is important to stress the need of validat-
ing/calibrating such data for local conditions to assess their
reliability. In the case of the Catalan coast, although the
hindcast data have been calibrated against recorded ones, a
relatively large dispersion of data around the fitted model did
exist. Due to this, calculated vulnerability values must be up-
dated by using new hazard time series as new wave data are
recorded, which will permit the recalculation of the extreme
wave climate.

Coastal managers play an important role in the assessment,
since they must decide the probability of occurrence to be
accepted as well as the period of concern of the analysis.
These two variables will determine the return period to be
considered in the analysis.

Obtained results have been presented graphically by using
a GIS database to facilitate their interpretation/visualisation
and their spatial analysis. In this sense, they can easily be
combined with a land use map to identify coastal uses and
resources at risk. This should support coastal managers to
make informed decisions for managing coastal disasters.

The described methodology has been applied to a 50 km
long coastal stretch of the Catalonia (NW Mediterranean)
where offshore wave conditions can be assumed to be ho-
mogeneous. In spite of this spatially constant wave field, ob-
tained results indicate a large variability in hazards intensity
along the coast. This fact highlights the importance of the
contribution of the beach geomorphology to hazards inten-
sity. Moreover, this influence is even larger when the vulner-
ability is assessed because actual beach dimensions will con-
trol the local capacity to cope with hazards for each beach.
This also implies that time-varying beach properties such as
width and elevation need to be updated to have a reliable es-
timation of coastal vulnerability in evolving systems. How-
ever, before applying this methodology in real situations, it
has to be locally validated by relating estimated vulnera-
bilities to real coastal damages (e.g., Jiménez et al., 2010).
In this sense, the storm-induced vulnerability has been un-
derpredicted in some points along the coast where beaches
present local widths significantly narrower than the average
value. To overcome this, we are increasing the spatial resolu-
tion to characterise beach properties controlling the capacity
to cope with hazards.
