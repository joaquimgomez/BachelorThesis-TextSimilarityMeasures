Abstract The dynamical response to cross-shelf wind-jet episodes is investigated. The study area is
located at the northern margin of the Ebro Shelf, in the Northwestern (NW) Mediterranean Sea, where epi-
sodes of strong northwesterly wind occur. In this case, the wind is channeled through the Ebro Valley and
intensifies upon reaching the sea, resulting in a wind jet. The wind-jet response in terms of water circulation
and vertical density structure is investigated using a numerical model. The numerical outputs agree with
water current observations from a high-frequency radar. Additionally, temperature, sea level, and wind
measurements are also used for the skill assessment of the model. For the wind-jet episodes, the numerical
results show a well-defined two-layer circulation in the cross-shelf direction, with the surface currents in the
direction of the wind. This pattern is consistent with sea level set-down due to the wind effect. The compari-
son of the vertical structure response for different episodes revealed that the increase of stratification leads
to an onshore displacement of the transition from inner shelf to mid-shelf. In general, the cross-shelf
momentum balance during a wind-jet episode exhibits a balance between the frictional terms and the
pressure gradient in shallow waters, shifting to a balance between the Coriolis force and the wind stress
terms in deeper waters.

1. Introduction

Wind-driven shelf circulation investigations have focused their attention on the effects of along-shelf winds,
which result in upwelling or downwelling. However, cross-shelf circulation due to cross-shelf winds is larger
than cross-shelf circulation due to along-shelf winds of the same magnitude in water depths that are less
than the surface boundary layer (SBL) thickness (Lentz & Fewings, 2012). In this region, cross-shelf winds
can generate substantial cross-shelf transport and, therefore, upwelling and downwelling (Tilburg, 2003).

The continental shelf is constrained by the surfzone and the continental slope and can be divided in three
dynamically different regions. Going from shallower to deeper waters, there is the inner shelf, the mid-shelf,
and the outer-shelf. Thus, the inner shelf is a transition zone (from surfzone to mid-shelf) that extends water
depths up to tens of meters. Since the surfzone dynamics are dominated by breaking waves and the mid-
shelf is usually in geostrophic balance, the inner shelf may have elements of both (Fewings & Lentz, 2010).
In this sense, previous investigations (collected in Lentz & Fewings, 2012) have analyzed the cross-shelf cir-
culation response due to cross-shelf winds and found two dynamical regions: onshore (inner shelf) and off-
shore (mid-shelf) of the location where the SBL intersects the bottom. Those studies also established that
during cross-shelf winds, the cross-shelf circulation is confined to the SBL. Thus, in this work, since it is
focused on the shelf circulation due to cross-shelf winds, the SBL is defined as the depth at which the cross-
shelf circulation in the upper layer shuts off and the inner shelf is defined as the region onshore of where
the SBL intersects the bottom (similarly to Tilburg, 2003 and Horwitz & Lentz, 2014, when analyzing the
response to a cross-shelf wind stress).

Regions with coastal wind jets induced by orographic effects are areas with complex dynamics in terms of
water circulation response (Grifoll et al., 2015; Jord�a, 2005; Trasvi~na et al., 1995), spatial and temporal wind
variability (Jiang et al., 2009), and sharp wave height variations (Shimada & Kawamura, 2006). In this sense,
several researchers have focused on the description of different aspects such as the wave generation/decay-
ing process (Shimada & Kawamura, 2006), the surface water cooling effect due to upwelling (Trasvi~na et al.,
1995), or the influence of the sea surface roughness variation due to the wave climate (Grifoll et al., 2016b).

However, these regions have still not been thoroughly investigated and some aspects of the water circula-
tion response to wind jets remain unclear. Thus, regions where the circulation pattern may be rapidly modi-
fied under the presence of a wind jet deserve special attention. Grifoll et al. (2015) performed an
observational study and found a seasonal response of the water circulation due to cross-shelf winds. They
also highlighted the presence of cold water at the surface and attempted to discern between an upwelling
process and a cooling effect due to mixing. However, the common sparsity of their measurements does not
allow one to extrapolate their conclusions to the whole region since the shelf response to cross-shelf winds
is highly dependent on water depth. Tilburg (2003) showed that at the inner shelf, cross-shelf winds can
result in cross-shelf velocities in the top few meters of the water column that are similar in magnitude to
those generated by along-shelf winds. In fact, the author found that cross-shelf winds can be the primary
mechanism for cross-shelf transport within the friction-dominated inner shelf. Horwitz and Lentz (2014)
noted that it is the cross-shelf rather than vertical density gradient that is critical to predict transport driven
by a cross-shelf wind stress. To investigate these processes, the use of numerical modeling has been proven
to be a powerful tool (e.g., Grifoll et al., 2016b; Horwitz & Lentz, 2014; Tilburg, 2003).

At the north Ebro Shelf (NES) in the NW Mediterranean Sea (see Figure 1), when the wind approaches from
the NW, channeled through the Ebro Valley, it results in an intensified wind upon reaching the sea, com-
monly known as an orographic wind jet. This wind is dry, cold, perpendicular to the coastline (cross-shelf
wind), and associated with high wind intensities. The synoptic situation that causes this wind jet is related
to a high-pressure area over the Bay of Biscay and a low-pressure area in the western Mediterranean Sea
(Riosalido et al., 1986). The wind jet is more common and intense in autumn and winter, when a larger
atmospheric pressure gradient exists, but a small pressure difference along the Ebro Valley is enough to ini-
tiate wind during any season (Riosalido et al., 1986). In addition, cross-shelf winds can have a significant

contribution to cross-shelf transport of water and material on the continental shelf (Tilburg, 2003), with fur-
ther implications to suspended matter and biological processes.

The main goal of this study is to describe the effects of a wind jet on the circulation and hydrographic prop-
erties of the continental shelf. To do that, a numerical model has been implemented in the NES and run for
a period of 6 months (from 1 March 2014 to 1 September 2014). This period was selected due to the high
availability of different types of observational data, which has allowed for the skill assessment of the numer-
ical model results. The influence of the stratification at the initial stages of the wind-jet episodes and the
main mechanisms that govern the cross-shelf circulation during those episodes are investigated.

This work is organized as follows. In section 2, an overview of the main characteristics of the study area, a
description of the numerical model implementation, and an exposition of the observational data available
at the zone, which is used to validate the model, are presented. Section 3 contains the results. First, the
wind data are analyzed to locate and characterize the wind-jet events, then the numerical model is vali-
dated using data from an HF radar and finally a selected wind-jet episode is analyzed in detail, while a more
general description is compiled for the remaining set of events. Section 4 contains a discussion, where the
results are compared with previous studies focusing on the role of the stratification and the estimation of
the momentum balance terms. Finally, the most relevant conclusions are summarized in section 5.

2. Data and Methodology

2.1. Study Area
The NES is located at the southern part of the Catalan coast, between latitudes 40.48N and 41.18N and longi-
tudes 0.48E and 1.38E (see Figure 1). This area includes the Ebro Delta shelf, which is characterized by the
transition from a narrow shelf (�10 km) at its northern end to a broader shelf (�60 km) toward the south.
The shelf break is at approximately 160 m water depth.

The regional topography (see Figure 1c), with the coastal mountain chain breached by the Ebro River valley,
exerts a significant control on the wind climate (Bola~nos et al., 2009). The most characteristic wind of the
region is the northwesterly wind (Mistral), which often results in a cross-shelf wind jet. Figure 1b shows an
example of a NW wind-jet event. An intensification of the mean conditions occurs at the northern margin of
the Ebro Delta, delimitating the wind-jet area. Grifoll et al. (2015) analyzed the percentage of time that NW
wind blows for each month: during winter this percentage reaches 80%, decreasing significantly during
summer (less than 20%).

The Mediterranean Sea is a microtidal environment where the astronomical tide is very small and the sea
level variation is not as important as in other seas. At the Ebro Delta, the maximum range of the astronomi-
cal tide is 0.25 m, while the sea level variations caused by storm surges have a range of 1 m (Bola~nos et al.,
2009).

The predominant current in the Balearic Sea is the quasi-permanent current known as the Northern Current,
which is an entity flowing along the continental slope (Millot, 1999). This current can be modified by meso-
scale events such as current meandering or eddies (Font et al., 1995). In winter, the Northern Current
becomes deeper and narrower. At this time, it tends to flow closer to the slope and develops relatively
intense mesoscale meanders (Flexas et al., 2002; Millot, 1999). The mean current intensity is not very strong
(�10 cm/s at 100 m depth) but it shows a seasonal intensification in winter when velocities can reach
higher values (�40 cm/s at 100 m depth) (Bola~nos et al., 2009).

At the Ebro Delta, the widening of the continental shelf produces a gyre of almost 908 in the direction of
the isobaths, becoming a barrier to the SW circulation of the Northern Current, which is deviated to the
south. Some studies have examined the likely presence of an anticyclonic circulation pattern controlled by
the bathymetry in the zone (Espino et al., 1998; Font, 1986). Using 1 year water velocity observations mea-
sured at 43.5 m, Grifoll et al. (2015) showed that the mean flow was polarized following the isobaths at the
shelf region; however, significant seaward near-surface velocities occurred predominantly during offshore
wind events.

The river discharge off the Ebro Delta may have a relevant influence in the circulation pattern of the area.
The freshwater enters the sea flowing to the NE but is deviated by the SW circulation to the E and then to

the S, due to the Coriolis force (Durand et al., 2002). This mesoscale event of the confrontation of flows with
different salinity (and therefore different density) can produce anticyclonic circulation (Font, 1986). Never-
theless, Durand et al. (2002) and Mestres et al. (2003) showed that the effects of the river plume on the cir-
culation are only important near the river mouth (�10 km offshore).

2.2. Numerical Model
The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is used in this study. It is a split-explicit, free-surface, terrain-
following, primitive equations oceanic model that solves the 3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equa-
tions using the hydrostatic and Boussinesq assumptions (Haidvogel et al., 2008; Shchepetkin & McWilliams,
2005). The model uses finite-difference approximations on a terrain-following vertical coordinate (sigma-
coordinate) and on a horizontal curvilinear Arakawa C grid.

A high-resolution domain is implemented at the NES. It has 20 vertical sigma levels and a horizontal grid of
260 3 166 points with a resolution of 350 m in both directions that covers an area of 91 3 58.1 km (see Fig-
ure 2b). The model implementation includes a Generic Length-Scale turbulent vertical mixing scheme with
the k2� parametrization, a logarithmic profile for the bottom boundary layer with a bottom roughness of
0.005 m, and horizontal mixing terms in geopotential surfaces.

As initial and boundary conditions, data from IBI-MFC (Iberian Biscay Irish - Monitoring and Forecasting Cen-
tre) product are used. This product (http://marine.copernicus.eu) includes all main forcings (i.e., tidal forcing,
high-frequency atmospheric forcing, freshwater river discharge, etc.) and is based on a (eddy-resolving)
NEMO model application run at 1/368 horizontal resolution. The outputs provided by the IBI-MFC used in
our numerical model are 3-D daily means of fields of temperature, salinity, sea surface height, zonal velocity,
and meridional velocity and hourly means of surface fields (sea surface height and barotropic currents).

For atmospheric forcing, the outputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF, Skamarock et al.,
2008) model implemented at high resolution (3 km) at the Meteorological Service of Catalonia (SMC; http://
www.meteo.cat) are used. Specifically, the wind velocity, the atmospheric pressure, humidity and tempera-
ture, the longwave and shortwave radiation, and the rainfall rate are used. Moreover, the turbulent heat
fluxes (latent and sensible) are derived from the atmospheric parameters using the bulk parametrization of
Fairall et al. (1996).

Finally, the Ebro River discharge is characterized by using data from the Automatic Hydrologic Information
System of the Ebro River basin (owned by the Confederaci�on Hidrogr�afica del Ebro), which has a network of
measurement and remote control instruments that transmits and processes data periodically. The data
used to force the numerical model consist of daily measurements of river runoff and temperature.

The points where the model results are validated and analyzed (see Figure 2b) are selected according to
the wind intensification zone (Figure 1b). Points A1, A2, A3, V3, and V4 correspond to a cross-section where
the mean wind velocities are higher (wind-jet axis). Seven additional points correspond to two parallel
cross-sections of the previous one which are located ‘‘outside’’ the wind-jet axis (V1, V2 along the west of
the wind-jet axis and A4, A5, A6, A7, and V5 along the east of it).

2.3. Validation Techniques
In order to assess the model behavior, the estimation of the bias, the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD),
the Pearson’s correlation (Pearson’s r), and the model skill score (d, following the method presented in Will-
mott, 1981) are undertaken. These values are defined as follows:

where N is the number of samples. Pearson’s r describes consistent proportional increases or decreases
about respective means of the two quantities, but it makes too few distinctions among the type or magni-
tudes of possible covariations (Willmott, 1981). By contrast, d is not a measure of correlation or association
in the formal sense but rather a measure of the degree to which a model’s predictions are error free. Unlike
r, d is sensitive to differences between the observed and predicted means as well as to certain changes in
proportionality (Willmott, 1981). Note that analogously to r, d is measured from 0 to 1, 1 denoting maximum
agreement.

2.4. Observations
For validation purposes, oceanographic and coastal meteorological measurements from the Spanish Har-
bour Agency (Puertos del Estado, http://www.puertos.es) are used. Specifically, data obtained from a tide
gauge, a coastal wave buoy, a deep water buoy, and an HF radar (see Figure 2).

The tide gauge (B1) is located at 41.088N, 1.218E and was deployed in May 2011. For the study period, B1
had 98% data availability. The deep water buoy (B2) was deployed in August 2004 and corresponds to an
ocean Seawatch buoy located at 40.688N, 1.478E at 688 m depth. This buoy measures water velocity and
water temperature at the subsurface (nominal depth of 3 m) and wind vectors at 3 m above the sea surface,
among other parameters. In this case, data availability reaches 99%. The coastal wave buoy (B3), located at
41.078N, 1.198E at 15 m depth and deployed in November 1992, is a directional wave buoy that includes a
temperature sensor. The data availability for this instrument during the study period is 96%.

The HF radar system became operational in December 2013 and consists of three remote shelf-based sites.
Each site comprises a transmitter-receiver antenna operating at a nominal frequency of 13.5 MHz with a
90 KHz bandwidth. The system provides hourly measurements of the current velocities in the first upper
meter of the water column with a horizontal resolution of 3 km and a cutoff filter of 100 cm/s. See Lorente
et al. (2015) for further information about the system.

HF radar measurements are subject to many potential errors (Graber & Haus, 1997). With the aim of mini-
mizing them, an analysis of the data availability is carried out in order to reject low-confidence measuring
points. Figure 2a shows that the central area of the radar domain has more than 80% data available, but
near the boundary there are points with lower data availability (in some cases less than 10%). Following the
criteria used by Lorente et al. (2015), only the HF radar points with more than 50% of data availability are
used in the validation. The resulting validation area is shown in Figure 2b, which also shows the location of
the tide gauge and the buoys, as well as the points used for validation and analysis of the model results.

The comparison between HF radar and subsurface water currents measured in
B2 shows good agreement for both along- and cross-shelf components. Some
statistical values are presented in Table 1. The RMSD and r values are 7.52–6.48
and 0.76–0.82, respectively, which are within the ranges found by Lorente et al.
(2015).

2.5. Numerical Model Analysis Methods
The first way of showing the results is by means of figures and their visual inter-
pretation. Then, some aspects are analyzed in more detail. In this section, the
methods used to analyze the model output are presented.

The buoyancy or Brunt-V€ais€al€a frequency (N) is used to study the vertical structure of the water column.

where q0 is the reference density and g is the gravitational acceleration.

When studying the surface mixed layer (SML) depth, Lentz (1992) established that it is proportional to wind
stress, inversely proportional to vertical temperature gradient and independent of surface heat flux. The
author also showed that the SML depth can be characterized by means of the parametrization (Pollard
et al., 1972; Weatherly & Martin, 1978)

below the SML, f is the Coriolis frequency, and A is a proportionality constant. In this manuscript, this param-
etrization is used with the aim of evaluating the stratification and wind stress effect on the SML depth.

The ‘‘international one-atmosphere equation of state of seawater’’ (Millero & Poisson, 1981) is used to study
the contribution of temperature and salinity to the density of the water column. The equation is of the form:

Several authors have used the momentum balance analysis to investigate the circulation over the continen-
tal shelf (Fewings & Lentz, 2010; Grifoll et al., 2016a; Lee et al., 1984; Lentz et al., 1999; Liu & Weisberg,
2005). In the present study, in order to analyze the mechanism that governs the circulation, an estimation
of the size of the momentum balance terms is carried out. To do so, the cross-shelf (y axis) depth-integrated
shallow-water equation is used:

3. Results

3.1. Wind Forcing and Wind-Jet Episodes Description
First, a comparison between the wind field from the WRF model and the observational data from B2 for the
cross-shelf component is presented in Figure 3a. The numerical time series agree with the observed ones
with a bias of 20.36 m/s, an RMSD of 2.62 m/s, an r of 0.77, and a d of 0.87 for the cross-shelf component.
For the along-shelf wind component (not shown), similar values are obtained for the above mentioned met-
rics: 0.32 m/s, 2.26 m/s, 0.78, and 0.88, respectively.

Wind data show a larger percentage of NW winds from March to May and, uncommonly, also in July. The
monthly maximum wind intensities are found in NW winds. The wind-jet events (intense wind from the
NW) that exhibit a wind intensity of more than 10 m/s during at least 6 h are marked with green boxes in
Figure 3. In total, nine episodes are selected (from E1 to E9). Table 2 shows the main characteristics of the
selected events at V3, which is approximately located in the wind-jet axis, and some statistics comparing
the WRF model data with buoy B2. Mean and maximum values show that during the warmer months, the
intensities are lower than during the colder months, which is consistent with previous investigations (Grifoll

et al., 2016b). The statistics show that the WRF model is able to capture the wind intensity during the wind-
jet episodes fairly well, with biases that usually do not reach 1 m/s and RMSD values around 2 m/s. How-
ever, it should be noted that this point validation is done at B2, which is out of the wind-jet axis. Most of
the events have a duration between 1 and 2 days. It is important to point out that E2 is much longer than
the other events because it is an event with three wind peaks. In contrast, event E7 is very short and it has
been selected because the hours of wind over 10 m/s are exactly the minimum imposed for the selection.
And event E8, although it shows a duration of 1.3 days, is an event of two wind peaks and the sum of both

3.2. Skill Assessment of the Numerical Model
The comparison between sea level observations at B1 and numerical model results reveals an RMSD of
4.48 cm, an r of up to 0.86 and a d of 0.92. The model is able to reproduce the sea level variations but does
not improve the results of IBI-MFC (imposed as boundary conditions), whose error metrics are 4.40 cm, 0.86,
and 0.93, for RMSD, r and d, respectively. A statistical comparison of the surface temperature between the
numerical model results and the observations of the buoys B2 and B3 is presented in Table 3, yielding rea-
sonable agreement between the time series.

Some point error metrics of the modeled currents compared with the HF radar data are summarized in
Table 4. In general, reasonably good agreement is found at points from V1 to V4, with values of RMSD, r,
and d of 12.51–19.70 cm/s, 0.49–0.68, and 0.65–0.76, respectively. The RMSD present relatively high values
because the numerical model currents have higher intensities than the HF radar measured currents. These
skill metrics are in accordance with values found in previous works when comparing HF radar measure-
ments with numerical models (Port et al., 2011; O011ERLINK ‘‘file, 2015; Lorente et al., 2016a). In contrast, at
V5, the model does not seem to reproduce the surface water circulation properly. An explanation for this
behavior is provided in Appendix A, where a more extensive analysis about the numerical model skill is
done.

In Figure 3c, the time series of the filtered surface cross-shelf current intensity from the HF radar and the
numerical model are compared. The filtered currents have been calculated using a tenth order Butterworth
filter with a cutoff period of 30 h. In general, the model is able to capture the current variability during the

wind jets. However the modeled intensities are higher than the measured ones, especially
during E1, E7, and E8. A visual comparison of the water circulation observed by the HF
radar and that obtained by the model during event E4 is presented in Figures 4b and 4c.
The numerical model is able to reproduce the current pattern measured by the HF radar,
but the results show higher current intensities than the measured ones.

3.3. Wind-Jet Events Analysis
The E4 event is the one that presents a more homogeneous wind field and a clear rise
and fall of wind intensity. For this reason, it has been selected as a representation episode

to show a detailed analysis of the evolution of the dynamics caused by the wind jet. The wind jet starts on
April 25 at 02:00 (GMT) and peaks at 06:00, with velocities up to 17 m/s. The sequence is shown in Figure 4,
where the columns correspond to four instants of the wind-jet evolution: before the wind jet starts, during
the wind-jet increase, the wind-jet peak and the wind-jet decay. Throughout the wind-jet intensification,
the surface currents (Figure 4c) intensify according to the increase of the wind intensity (Figure 4a) and the
flow direction is consistent with the wind. When the wind stress decreases, the surface circulation turns par-
allel to the coastline, i.e., southwestward, perpendicular to the wind stress. The modeled sea level also
presents a consistent sequence with the wind-jet evolution. Figure 4d shows the sea level obtained with
the numerical model. During the wind-jet peak, a sea level set-down occurs near the coastline as a response
to the wind stress.

Figure 5 shows the along- and cross-shelf wind stress components and subinertial water current at points A1
(11.3 m water depth) and V3 (76.1 m water depth) throughout the wind jet. The subinertial currents have
been calculated using the filter mentioned in section 3.2. Near the coast (A1), before and after the wind jet,
the along-shelf circulation prevails and a northeastward flow is observed. During the wind jet, the along-shelf
component becomes less important. In contrast, in deeper regions (V3), the along-shelf flow during the wind
jet is intensified and exhibits a southwestwardly flow. The cross-shelf circulation show a well-defined two-layer
structure in both shallow and deep waters. This two-layer structure is characterized by a surface circulation
that flows offshore and an onshore flowing circulation just below it. In deeper regions (V3), the two-layer
structure has a return flow below the surface with much smaller intensities than that at the surface. Note that
after the wind jet, when an inertial circulation emerges, the two-layer structure gradually disappears but, in
deeper regions, the along-shelf subinertial surface circulation keeps flowing southwestward.

Figure 6 presents the evolution of the density anomaly obtained with the numerical model at the same
instants as Figure 4. The results present an increase of the surface density (Figure 6a), which is displaced
southwestward, likely due to the advection. In order to analyze the vertical structure, two vertical sections
of the density anomaly are used: one following the axis of the wind jet (section A, Figure 6b) and one per-
pendicular to the wind jet (section B, Figure 6c). These vertical profiles show that before the wind jet starts,
the water column is stratified and that during the wind jet the stratification decreases and the water column
tends to homogenize. This stratification breakdown is more pronounced in the axis of the wind jet. How-
ever, from visual inspection, it is not possible to clearly discern if the homogenization process is due to
upwelling/downwelling or a mixing process that cools the water surface. Looking at the temperature and
salinity distributions and the vertical velocity profiles at the vertical section B (not shown), it is observed
that during the wind jet the water at the surface becomes cooler due to a mixing process and, when the
wind jet intensity diminishes, there appears a downwelling region at the west of the wind-jet axis, associ-
ated with a downward movement of the lighter and warmer surface waters. In contrast, at section A there is
a clear upwelling region near the coast until approximately 45 m depth (4 km from the coastline), where
the surface water temperature becomes equal to the bottom water temperature. Then, moving offshore-
ward, the water column likely starts to mix. Besides, it is important to note that there is an advection of the
surface temperature that also contributes to the changes in the temperature field.

In order to extend the wind-jet response pattern in the vertical column during other episodes, the evolution
of the buoyancy or Brunt-V€ais€al€a frequency (N) is investigated. Figure 7 shows the Brunt-V€ais€al€a frequency

evolution (before and after the wind jet) for the episodes selected in section 3.1. The selected point is V4,
which is far enough to avoid the river plume interference and, therefore, allows a clearer visualization of the
results. Different patterns are observed according to the evolution of N. During colder episodes (i.e., E1, E2,
E3, which occurred during March and early April), the water column becomes homogenized after the wind
jet. In these cases, the wind stress momentum transfer is able to reduce the stratification, resulting in a well-
mixed water column, i.e., there are weak vertical gradients. In contrast, during warmer episodes, where the
water column is more stratified, the wind-induced mixing is not able to homogenize the whole water col-
umn and only a deepening of the pycnocline is observed after the wind jet.

In Figure 7, it is also observed a reduction of the wind-induced mixing when moving toward warmer
months (e.g., E9, which corresponds to August): the resulting SML depth (i.e., the distance between the sur-
face and the top of the pycnocline) becomes thinner after the wind jet. In events E1 and E2, the whole
water column becomes mixed, in E3 the SML depth is around 24 m, in E4 is 12 m, in E5 11 m, in E6 is 10 m,

and from E7 to E9 the SML depth is less than 10 m. These results can be explained looking equation (6),
where the SML depth increase linearly with u� and decrease exponentially with N. Thus, the smaller the N is
(less stratified), the higher the SML depth becomes.

In order to determine which is the main contributor to water column stratification, the temperature and
salinity vertical profiles have been calculated using equation (7). The temperature (salinity) contribution to
density is calculated assuming constant salinity (temperature). The comparison of these profiles with the
density profile (not shown) for all events shows a clear change of the density profile due to a change in
temperature (the salinity contribution is almost invariant) except in E1, where salinity plays an important
role due to high river runoff, which reaches values of 1,300 m3/s (see Figure 3). The fact of having a change
in density due to a change in temperature and an unaltered salinity, indicates that the water column in this
point is under a mixing process.

The numerical results show a similar flow structure in all selected events, where a two-layer flow is always
originated. Figure 8 presents the wind intensity and the current vertical profile along section A for two
events: E4 (less stratified and higher wind intensity) and E9 (more stratified and weaker wind intensity). Dur-
ing E4, the two-layer structure occupies the whole water column (the onshore return flow reaches the bot-
tom). In contrast, in event E9, the two-layer cross-shelf circulation is clearly confined to the SBL (below that,
where the return flow ends, the circulation is almost nonexistent). This indicates that the transition from
inner to mid-shelf occurs in shallower waters. During less stratified events (e.g., E4), the SBL intersects the
bottom in almost the whole domain (most of the section is at the inner shelf), while in more stratified
events (e.g., E9) the SBL is thinner, and thus, the intersection with the bottom is reduced, i.e., the inner shelf
is narrower, and most of the transversal section is in the mid-shelf.

Figure 8 also shows the influence of the spatially varying wind stress. During E4, when a relatively homoge-
neous wind field occurred, the first zero-crossing depth (from offshore to onshore flow) is almost uniform
along the transect. However, during E9, where the wind along section A is not homogeneous, this first zero-

crossing depth is not constant. In this case, when the wind intensity decreases, the upper part of the SBL
(where the flow is offshore-ward) is reduced and the SBL becomes smaller.

The results of the cross-shelf momentum balance are presented in Table 5. In order to evaluate the rele-
vance of each term, the mean and the standard deviation computed over a period of 12 h are provided.
The results are presented at four different points, A1, A2, V3, and V4 (from shallower to deeper waters), and
for two different periods: throughout the calm before E4 and during the wind-jet event E4.

During the calm period, the flow tends to be geostrophic in the cross-shelf component, with a momentum
balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient terms. In some cases, the nonlinear terms are
also important. This is because during a calm period the along-shelf circulation may become important and,
at shallow regions, the bathymetric features can also play an important role.

In the course of the wind jet, the relative importance of the dominant terms in the momentum balance is
modified. From A2 to V4, the momentum balance shows a balance between the wind stress, the pressure
gradient and the Coriolis force term (associated with the wind-driven along-shelf transport). However, the
relative importance of the pressure gradient term tends to diminish moving offshore (to deeper waters).
This seems to indicate that there is a transition zone toward a balance between the wind stress and the
Coriolis force terms, characterizing a transition to the mid-shelf. Then, in shallower waters (A1 and A2), there
is an increase of the relative importance of the nonlinear terms and, in A1, the bottom stress term also
increases. Nevertheless, at A1 the main momentum terms are the pressure gradient and the wind stress.
This is due to the sea level set-down observed in our results, and consistent with the results presented in
Fewings and Lentz (2010) and Lentz and Fewings (2012), since an offshore-ward wind stress balances the
cross-shelf pressure gradient with a sea level set-down.

In order to inspect the momentum balance of all the wind-jet events, a ternary plot of the surface stress,
pressure gradient and Coriolis terms is shown in Figure 9. This ternary plot has been done adding the three
terms and calculating the proportion of each one for every wind-jet event at three different locations: A1,
V4, and A7. At the shallowest point in the wind-jet axis (A1), all the events present a balance between the
pressure gradient and the surface stress terms, with a very small contribution of the Coriolis term. Thus, A1
is in the inner shelf for all the events. Going to deeper waters (V4), different behaviors are observed depend-
ing on the different events. For event E3, point V4 is still in the inner shelf. For events E1 and E5, point V4 is
in a transition zone. For events E2 and E4, the balance is mainly due to the surface stress and the Coriolis
terms, thus the point is located at the mid-shelf. Finally, events E6, E7, E8, and E9 show a geostrophic

balance, indicating that the region is barely affected by the wind jet
and that V4 is located in the outer-shelf. It should be noted that
these events are the ones with less wind intensity. Now, looking for
the behavior at a point out of the primary wind-jet axis, it is
observed that at A7 most of the events present a geostrophic bal-
ance (the point is not affected by the wind jet). However, for events
E1, E2, and E4, point A7 is affected by the wind jet. This is due to the
wider wind field of these wind-jet episodes.

4. Discussion

4.1. Wind-Jet-Induced Dynamics
The theoretical shelf response to cross-shelf winds has been analyzed
in previous research. Pond and Pickard (1983) explained that when
the wind remains constant in direction but varies in speed, the Ekman
transport perpendicular to the wind varies and the upper-layer waters
are forced toward or away from each other, generating convergence
or divergence. Then, for continuity, the convergence (divergence) is
accompanied by a downward (upward) motion, namely downwelling
(upwelling). Focusing at the Ebro Shelf, a theoretical shelf response
was investigated by Jord�a (2005) using numerical modeling under
simplified conditions. The author found that during a stationary NW
wind-jet episode, the water velocities perpendicular to the wind jet
are larger in the axis of the wind jet than at the edges, resulting in a
divergence zone in the east (associated with a decrease of surface
elevation and an upwelling of denser waters) and a convergence
zone in the west (associated with an increase of the surface elevation
and a downwelling of lighter waters). The realistic simulations pre-
sented in this manuscript have allowed the authors to identify some

of the characteristics mentioned above. The sea-surface elevation (see Figure 4d) exhibits a clear sea level set-
down throughout the wind jet. Additionally, when the flow is perpendicular to the wind-jet axis, the sea level
presents a decrease east of the wind-jet core and an increase to its west. Besides, a downwelling region is
observed at the west of the wind-jet axis when the wind-jet intensity diminishes. During the wind jet, the
along-shelf current velocity in deeper regions present a structure similar to the model suggested by Pond and
Pickard (1983), with a divergence zone east of the wind-jet axis and convergence to its west. However, the
transitory nature of the forcing mechanisms and the nonuniform bathymetry lead to complex behavior in the
along-shelf direction dominated by along-shelf gradients. This probably explains the increase of the along-
shelf flow shown after the wind-jet (Figure 5) related to the transient set-down near the coast. In this sense,
Csanady (1980) showed that strong cross-shore wind can generate substantial along-shelf flow due to the
presence of a trapped pressure field on the inner shelf.

The small upwelling region near the coastline found in our results is consistent with the theoretical study of
Pond and Pickard (1983). In this case, when the wind causes the surface layer to move away from the coast
but there is no supply of surface water (due to the coast), water from below the surface must rise to replace
it. Additionally, this behavior is linked with the two-layer flow structure observed in our numerical results,
where water from deeper layers must upwell near the coast to replace the water flowing offshore at the sur-
face. The two-layer flow structure has been previously observed in the Ebro Shelf by Grifoll et al. (2015,
2016b) and is consistent with results of other investigations (Fewings et al., 2008; Grifoll et al., 2013; Horwitz
& Lentz, 2014; Tilburg, 2003), where a two-layer flow structure due to cross-shelf winds has been found at
the inner shelf. This two-layer behavior was first investigated by Ekman (1905), who analytically found the
existence of an upper current in the direction of the wind and a compensating, comparatively weak current
running in the opposite direction below.

Grifoll et al. (2015) used ADCP observations at the Ebro Shelf and observed that during stratified seasons,
the intense cross-shelf winds resulted in a well-defined two-layer flow and were more effective at driving

offshore transport than during unstratified conditions, when a one-layer structure appeared. Nevertheless,
Lentz and Fewings (2012) noted that the flow structure is similar for stratified and unstratified conditions.
Previous studies about the influence of the stratification in the cross-shelf transport also exhibit differences.
On the one hand, Fewings et al. (2008) noted that stratification suppresses vertical mixing and, therefore,
the SBL is reduced, producing a stronger cross-shelf circulation and an onshore displacement of the bound-
ary between the inner shelf and the mid-shelf. Also, Dzwonkowski et al. (2011) found that as stratification
increases, the boundary layer extent is reduced and the transport fraction is enhanced. On the other hand,
Tilburg (2003) posited that strong stratification or weak winds lead to shallower surface boundary layers
and that strong stratification results in smaller upwelling/downwelling zones and a reduction of the cross-
shelf transport.

Our numerical results have provided evidence of a complex response to a wind jet, where all events present
a two-layer flow structure. In the episodes where the water is more stratified, there is a reduction of vertical
mixing and thus, the SML is thinner (similar to Fewings et al., 2008). It has also been observed that when
the water column is more stratified or the wind is less intense, the SBL is reduced, agreeing with previous
investigations (Dzwonkowski et al., 2011; Fewings et al., 2008; Tilburg, 2003). This indicates that the transi-
tion from the inner shelf to the mid-shelf occurs in shallower waters, i.e., the inner shelf region is reduced,
which is consistent with results from previous studies (Fewings et al., 2008; Lentz & Fewings, 2012). In order
to discern if the differences are due to the different stratification conditions or due to the different wind
intensities, a simple test is done. Using equation (6) the SML depth along section A is calculated for each
event. Then, the effect of wind (stratification) is estimated considering the N (u�) parameter constant (using
as constant value the mean along the section). Finally, the regression slopes when comparing the ‘‘real’’
SML depth with both the SML depths calculated with constant u� and with constant N have been calculated
for each wind-jet event. The results show that for events E1 to E4, the regression slopes for the stratification
effect have values ranging from 0.59 to 0.84, while the wind effect has values from 0.13 to 0.38. In contrast,
the SML depth for events E5 to E9 show regression slopes from 0.10 to 0.45 for the stratification effect and
values from 0.54 to 0.85 for the wind effect. A plausible explanation for these results is that for more strati-
fied events, where the SML depth is smaller, the wind plays a more important role because the layer of
water where it affects is smaller. And for the events less stratified, where the SML depth is higher, the wind
effect is smaller because the water column where it affects is bigger and thus the stratification plays a more
important role.

Regarding the cross-shelf momentum balance, Lentz et al. (1999) distinguished among regions with differ-
ent dominant momentum balance terms on the North Carolina Shelf. At the inner shelf, the pressure gradi-
ent tended to be balanced by the frictional terms (wind and bottom stresses) and, at the mid-shelf, there
was generally a geostrophic balance (i.e., a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient
terms). However, the dynamics during a cross-shelf wind is different. In this sense, Lentz and Fewings (2012)
distinguished between the inner and mid-shelf responses to a cross-shelf wind stress. They revealed that, at
the inner shelf, the bottom stress reduces the along-shelf transport and a pressure gradient develops to par-
tially balance the wind stress. In contrast, at the mid-shelf, the wind stress is balanced by the Coriolis force
and there is no pressure gradient. In the present study, it has been found that, during a calm period the
flow is geostrophic, as expected according to other research (e.g., Fewings & Lentz, 2010; Lentz et al., 1999;
Liu & Weisberg, 2005). During the wind-jet events, a balance between the pressure gradient and the surface
stress terms is observed at shallow waters, which is the typical behavior at the inner shelf. Then, moving to
deeper regions, there is an increase of the relative importance of the Coriolis force term. In some events,
the Coriolis force term balances with the surface stress term (i.e., the region is located at the mid-shelf),
other events present a balance between the three terms (i.e., are in a transition zone) and other events are
in geostrophic balance (i.e., not affected by the wind jet). Overall, the momentum balance observed in the
results present similar patterns as the reported by Lentz et al. (1999) (during the calm period) and Lentz and
Fewings (2012) (during the wind jet).

5. Conclusions

A numerical model at the north Ebro Shelf has been implemented, run for 6 months and validated, present-
ing good agreement with observational data. Within the studied period, nine wind-jet events have been

selected to investigate the shelf response in terms of water circulation. According to the numerical results,
the water circulation response to a wind jet in the NES presents noticeable spatial and temporal variability. A
schematic diagram of the main results is presented in Figure 10. During the wind-jet events, the cross-shelf
circulation at the wind-jet axis presents a well-defined two-layer structure (offshore flow at near-surface and
onshore flow in deeper layers), which is accompanied by a decreasing of the sea level near the coast and the
occurrence of upwelling near the coastline. The vertical structure of the water column highly depends on
the wind stress and the water stratification. Numerical results show that increasing the stratification reduces
the SML and the SBL, thus the inner shelf region is narrower. The buoyancy frequency analysis has revealed
that, during colder episodes, the wind momentum transfer penetrates unto deeper layers and the whole
water column becomes mixed after the wind jet. During the warmer episodes, the water column presents a
stratification reduction but, due to its initially higher stratification, it remains stratified after the wind jet.
Finally, the cross-shelf momentum balance results have allowed to discern between the different continental
shelf regions. At the wind-jet axis, all the events exhibit a balance between the pressure gradient and the sur-
face stress terms at shallow waters (indicating that the point is located at the inner shelf). At deeper waters,
one event remains at the inner shelf, some events present a balance between the Coriolis force and the sur-
face stress terms (indicating that the point is located at the mid-shelf), other events present a combined bal-
ance between the Coriolis, the surface stress and the pressure gradient terms (indicating that the region is in
a transition zone) and others are not affected by the wind jet and show a geostrophic balance. The momen-
tum balance at a point out of the wind-jet axis shows that most of the events are in geostrophic balance but
some events are affected by the wind jet, due to a wider wind field that reaches the evaluation point.

Appendix A: Numerical Model Skill Assessment

A complete visualization of the surface current error metrics in the HF radar domain is presented in
Figure A1. After computing the RMSD, r and d of the numerical model, a heterogeneous pattern is
observed. The error metrics revealed good results at the continental shelf but show some discrepancies
at the SE corner of the domain, where the depth is more than 1,000 m. Two plausible explanations are
provided for this abnormal behavior. First, the numerical model is configured with 20 sigma levels,
being the vertical representation of this area relatively poor. For instance, at V3 (located at the continen-
tal shelf), the maximum distance between vertical layers is 8 m and, in contrast, at V5 (located at the SE
corner of the domain, at the continental slope) there are layers that are separated up to 60 m. Second,
it coincides with the region where IBI-MFC presents a major discrepancy with the HF radar data (Lorente
et al., 2016b); thus, the model results might be strongly influenced by the quality of the imposed open-
boundary conditions. Nonetheless, the aim of this section is to verify the numerical model in shallow

Figure 10. Schematic diagram of the cross-shelf response to a nonhomogeneous wind jet. The green dots represent the
depth of the SBL and the orange dashed line is the transition from the inner shelf (where the SBL intersects the bottom)
to the mid-shelf. This transition is displaced onshore when the stratification is higher. The SBL depths vary with the wind
intensity. The vertical structure presents a two-layer flow with an upwelling region near the coast (black arrow). A sea level
set-down occurs near the coastline. The cross-shelf dynamical balance at the inner shelf is between the pressure gradient
and the wind stress term. At very shallow waters, the bottom stress term is also relevant. In contrast, at the mid-shelf, the
balance is between the Coriolis and the wind stress terms.

regions in order to study the wind-jet response at the continental shelf. For this reason, we exclude the
lower right corner of the domain, which is outside of the continental shelf and where the results are
not reliable. Finally it is worth noting that the HF radar estimations have an inherent uncertainty (see
Table 1). For instance, considering the HF radar data as real for reference, the comparison between the
HF data and our model provides a mean RMSD of around 15 cm/s, values of r between 0.4 and 0.7 and
a mean d above 0.65, which reaches 0.8 at some points. The cross-shelf component shows better agree-
ment with the HF radar data than the along-shelf component.

The energy spectra of the along- and cross-shelf surface current components (Figure A2) show that the
dominant modes of temporal variability are within the diurnal and inertial frequencies. There is also a non-
negligible peak at semidiurnal frequencies and an energetic band at low frequencies, while after 2 cycles
per day (cpd) there is a sequentially drop of energy. Figure A2 shows that at V1 the model and the HF radar
have a nonsignificant peak at the inertial frequency but IBI-MFC seems to indicate a small peak on the
along-shelf component. Then, at V2, the inertial frequency increases in all cases. This behavior is expected,
since at V1, which is at 13.3 m water depth, the frictional terms are expected to prevail and, at V2, at 62.2 m
water depth, the frictional terms are less important. Another characteristic of the spectra is that the inertial
frequency peak is higher at the points located at the center of the domain (not shown), revealing the preva-
lent clockwise motion in the area. In general, the IBI-MFC regional model tends to overestimate the inertial
frequency in comparison to the HF radar data, while our coastal numerical model better reproduces the
energy of this frequency. Also, at high frequencies, the model energy agrees better than IBI-MFC with the
HF radar estimations. In contrast, the numerical model tends to overestimate the diurnal and semidiurnal
peaks in comparison to the HF radar.
