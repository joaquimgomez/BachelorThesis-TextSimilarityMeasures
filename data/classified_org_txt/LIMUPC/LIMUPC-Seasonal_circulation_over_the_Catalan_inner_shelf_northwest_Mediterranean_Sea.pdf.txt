[1] This study characterizes the seasonal cycle of the Catalan inner-shelf circulation using
observations and complementary numerical results. The relation between seasonal
circulation and forcing mechanisms is explored through the depth-averaged momentum
balance, for the period between May 2010 and April 2011, when velocity observations were
partially available. The monthly-mean along-shelf flow is mainly controlled by the along-
shelf pressure gradient and by surface and bottom stresses. During summer, fall, and winter,
the along-shelf momentum balance is dominated by the barotropic pressure gradient and
local winds. During spring, both wind stress and pressure gradient act in the same direction
and are compensated by bottom stress. In the cross-shelf direction the dominant forces are
in geostrophic balance, consistent with dynamic altimetry data.

1. Introduction

[2] The Catalan Sea (CS), located in the Northwest Med-
iterranean Sea (Figure 1), has atmospheric and oceano-
graphic properties influenced by the semienclosed
character of the Mediterranean Sea. Since the Mediterra-
nean is a microtidal environment, the circulation variability
in the inner-shelf CS is predominantly affected by storm-
induced fluctuations [Grifoll et al., 2012] and by forcing
mechanisms acting primarily at seasonal scales. Our study
aims at identifying and quantifying those mechanisms re-
sponsible for the seasonal variability of the velocity field in
the inner-shelf of the CS.

[3] The atmospheric seasonal cycle of the NW Mediter-
ranean Sea is characterized by dry summers with well-
developed sea breezes and relatively stable atmospheric
conditions, transition seasons (autumn and spring) when
most of the annual precipitation occurs, and winters charac-
terized by mild temperatures [Bola~nos et al., 2009]. Most
of the regional storms occur in late autumn and through
winter, with considerable interannual stability [Font,
1990]. These storms are associated with pressure differen-
ces between high-pressure systems over the Atlantic or

northwest Europe and the low pressure of Mediterranean
cyclones over the Gulf of Lion (located north of the Catalan
Sea). This cyclonic activity leads to strong north and north-
east winds on the Catalan Sea resulting in highly energetic
wave events [Bola~nos et al., 2009] and concentrating its
energy at low frequencies (periods over 3 days) associated
with synoptic low-pressure systems [Salat et al., 1992]. In
summer and spring, the dominant wind is southwesterly
with the dominant frequencies in the synoptic and diurnal
(sea breeze) bands.

[4] The bathymetry on the CS varies from a narrow shelf
(<20 km) in the north to a wider shelf (60 km) in the south
(Ebro delta region), influencing the hydrodynamic proper-
ties of the Catalan coast [S�anchez-Arcilla and Simpson,
1992]. The shelf break is located approximately at 150 m
depth (Figure 1b). The regional circulation is characterized
by the Northern Current [Millot, 1999], a quasi-permanent
slope current modulated by mesoscale events. These events
consist of current meanders and eddies [Font et al., 1995]
and, in some instances, they reach between the mainland
and the Balearic Islands, constituting a source of external
variability to the continental shelf [Font et al., 1988]. In
addition, Jordi et al. [2005] found coastal-trapped wave ac-
tivity on the Catalan Sea using a conceptual model adjusted
to match current observations over the slope.

[5] The freshwater budget in the Mediterranean basin is
negative (more evaporation than precipitation) in summer
and positive in spring, with a net basin freshwater deficit
[Salat et al., 2002]. The joint effect of positive heat flux
and river discharge, mainly during spring and fall, contrib-
utes to water column stratification in the inner-shelf of the
Catalan Sea [Grifoll et al., 2012]. These conditions, favor-
able to stratify the water column, are counteracted by
intense cooling and wind mixing during fall and winter
[Font, 1990].

[6] The strong seasonality of the Catalan shelf has been
described as part of several regional and basin-scale ocean-
ographic studies. For instance, Millot [1999] observed sea
surface temperature (SST) ranging from 13�C in winter to
more than 27�C in summer with a seasonal thermocline
present from early spring to late summer. Petrenko [2003]
also found a noticeable seasonal variability of the slope
current in the Gulf of Lion. Marcos and Tsimplis [2007]
described a water-level seasonal cycle in the Mediterranean
Sea. Thus, seasonal variability in water circulation is
expected on the CS inner-shelf dynamics, but it yet remains
to be properly described.

[7] Several initiatives have been carried out in recent
years to increase the level of physical understanding in the
Catalan coastal area and, therefore, to contribute to its inte-
gral management. First, the development of an observatory
network in the Catalan coast has allowed the collection of
systematic meteo-oceanographic data in the Catalan shelf
area (www.xiom.cat ; Bola~nos et al. [2009]). More recently,
in the frame of the European project Field_AC, efficient
operational products have been developed. As part of the
Field_AC effort, two observational surveys have collected

current, wind, waves, hydrographic, and sea-level data in
the coastal CS. In contrast with earlier regional studies,
mainly in south margin of the Ebro delta [Font, 1990; Salat
et al., 2002], Field_AC has focused on the inner-shelf off
the city of Barcelona (Figure 1). Grifoll et al. [2012] pre-
sented results of one of the observational surveys of the
project, describing the water current response to forcing
mechanisms in scales ranging from days to weeks. Grifoll
et al. [2012] found a strong relation between current veloc-
ity fluctuation and sea level gradient (synoptic time scales)
and local wind (short time scales) during a 1 month period.
They also described a small influence of the inertial band
due to the dominance of the frictional effects over rela-
tively shallow depths (24 m). To address variations at sea-
sonal scales on the inner-shelf, in this study, we combine
water velocity observations with hydrodynamic modeling,
neglecting daily and subdaily fluctuations. As the available
observations do not cover the entire annual cycle, numeri-
cal simulations provide a way to complete the circulation
data set and to analyze its relationship with the prevalent
forcing mechanisms. The observations are useful not only
to calibrate the model results but also to physically sustain

the dynamic patterns revealed by the numerical simula-
tions. The analysis focuses on assessing each term in the
depth-averaged momentum balance equations, ranking the
importance of the forcing mechanisms during a period that
includes both field campaigns: May 2010 to April 2011.
This contribution presents, for the first time, the joint
results of observational and numerical results to character-
ize the circulation at seasonal scales over the Catalan inner-
shelf.

[8] The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introdu-
ces the observational data used, as well as the numerical
model configuration and assessment. Section 3 includes the
analysis of atmospheric and river run-off momentum
fluxes, and the analysis of the momentum terms in both
along- and cross-shelf directions; the seasonal variation is
examined at a point where water velocity data is available
(24 m depth). The representativeness of the results, in par-
ticular the way the current regime responds to different
forcing mechanisms and the role played by stratification
and regional forcing, is examined in section 4. Finally, we
close with a concise description of the seasonal patterns as
obtained from the analysis.

2. Observational and Model Data

2.1. Observational Data

[9] The observations were collected in the framework of
the Field_AC project during two periods: FIELD1 (from
11 November 2010 to 18 January 2011) and FIELD2 (from
15 March to 15 April 2011). The velocity observations on
the inner Catalan shelf were obtained from two Acoustic
Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) moored near the city of
Barcelona over the 24 m isobath (stations A1 and A2,
Figure 1c), approximately 1 km offshore of Bogatell Beach
and the Besos River mouth, respectively. The ADCP used
was an AWAC instrument, sampling 25 bin intervals of 1
m at 10 min intervals, with the first cell located 0.4 m from
the surface. Additionally, velocity observations from a

meteo-oceanographic buoy of the XIOM network were
used (Llobregat Buoy). Velocity at the Llobregat location
was measured at 1 and 15 m from the surface during 2010
and 2011, unfortunately with significant temporal gaps.
This buoy was located at 45 m depth, 17 km south of Bar-
celona harbor in front of the Llobregat River mouth
(Figure 1c), and in the present study is mainly used for
model skill assessment.

[10] The dynamics of the Catalan inner-shelf is con-
strained by the coastal boundary that polarizes the flow
along the isobaths, resulting in the spatial scale of the
alongshore direction being larger than the onshore/offshore
scales [Allen and Kundu, 1978; Lentz and Winant, 1986;
Lentz and Fewings, 2012]. The dispersion diagrams of the
depth-averaged flow for the FIELD1 and FIELD2 cam-
paigns (Figure 2) reproduce the aforementioned flow align-
ment. The current variance ellipse angles, given by the
principal component analysis (PCA), are well aligned with
the local bathymetry.

[11] To characterize the time-averaged flow and its vari-
ability, the observations were rotated following the princi-
pal angle given by the PCA. This mean depth-averaged
flow (Table 1) showed slight differences between both
campaigns. During FIELD1, it was statistically indistin-
guishable from zero, as both mean components were less
than the respective standard deviations. During FIELD2,
the cross-shelf mean flow remained nonsignificant but a
southward alongshore net flow was observed in both
ADCPs. For both campaigns and in all ADCPs, the stand-
ard deviations in the along-shelf direction, given by the
major axis of the ellipse, were between 2 and 6 times larger
than the cross-shelf standard deviations (minor axis), con-
firming the polarization of the flow along the isobaths
(Table 1).

2.2. Model and Nesting System

[12] The numerical model used is the Regional Ocean
Modeling System (ROMS, Shchepetkin and McWilliams
[2005]). ROMS is a free-surface terrain-following

circle and the center of the ellipse represents mean velocity. The minor and major subaxes represent the
standard deviation. The rotated axes (x, y) with the associated velocity components (u, v) represent the

numerical model that solves the three-dimensional Reyn-
olds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using hydrostatic
and Boussinesq approximations. A model grid, with 250 m
horizontal resolution, was implemented in front of the city
of Barcelona (herein designated as COASTAL model).
This grid included 207 � 152 grid cells covering the area
where the ADCPs were deployed (Figure 1c). The vertical
coordinate had 20 sigma levels, which resolve both surface
and bottom boundary layers over the continental shelf.

[13] The open boundaries of the COASTAL model do-
main were forced by a Mediterranean-scale circulation
model [Tonani et al., 2009] with a horizontal resolution of
1/16� � 1/16� and 71 unevenly spaced vertical levels, in
particular with 20 levels of 3 m resolution near the surface.
The Mediterranean model output, part of the forecast/anal-
ysis system MyOcean (www.myocean.eu), was available as
daily averaged temperature, salinity, sea level, and horizon-
tal velocity fields. The model is a basin-scale Mediterra-
nean Sea model assimilating sea level altimeter data,
remotely sensed SST, and in situ observations, forced by
remote atmospheric and oceanic pressure gradient forcing
among others.

[14] Instead of nesting the coastal domain directly into
the MyOcean domain, an intermediate domain (called
SHElf CATalan model, SHECAT) was implemented at the
scale of the Catalan Shelf (Figure 1) with approximately
1.25 km horizontal resolution. The SHECAT domain was
used to properly represent the physical interactions between
the general circulation (mainly the Northern Current) and
the shelf circulation over the Catalan Shelf, following a
nesting ratio of 5 [Blayo and Debreu, 2005]. The SHECAT
implementation is part of an operational modeling system
that ran during a 5 year period (2007–2011). We have cho-
sen the period between May 2010 and April 2011 because
it encompassed those times of field measurements. The nor-
mal velocities from the SHECAT domain were adjusted to
preserve the total mass flux from the coarse grid across the
open boundary [Mason et al., 2010]. The lateral open
boundary conditions consisted of a Flather condition for
the 2-D variables and an Orlansky type radiation condition
for 3-D fields.

[15] A generic length scale turbulent mixing scheme
(Umlauf and Burchard [2003], implemented within ROMS
by Warner et al. [2005]) was used in both COASTAL and
SHECAT model domains, with coefficients selected to
parameterize the �-" scheme [Rodi, 1987]. We use the
Kantha and Clayson [1994] stability function implementa-
tion described in Warner et al. [2005]. The implementation
included fourth order biharmonic Laplacian viscosity and

mixing terms in geopotential surfaces for velocity and trac-
ers, respectively, both with constant coefficients of 0.5 m4

s�2. The bottom boundary layer was parameterized using a
log-profile with bottom roughness equal to 0.005 m. Daily
atmospheric fluxes (heat and freshwater fluxes, and wind
stress) were obtained from the European Centre of
Medium-Range Forecast (ECMWF; www.ecmwf.int). Llo-
bregat and Besos river discharge were included in the
model as freshwater sources. The runoff data upstream of
the river mouths were obtained from monitoring stations
managed by the Catalan Water Agency (ACA;
www.aca.cat).

2.3. Skill Assessment

[16] Time series of model and observed velocity were
compared to assess the skill of the simulations. For this pur-
pose, we used the alongshore velocities of the Llobregat
buoy at 1 and 15 m depths (Figure 3) because of their rela-
tively long temporal coverage (from October 9 to 11 April).
The model qualitatively reproduces the observed current
behavior and its variability while maintaining acceptable
statistical skill. At 1 and 15 m the root-mean-square differ-
ences were less than 0.16 and 0.12 m s�1, respectively,
while the bias was 0.03 m s�1 at 1 m and less than 0.02 m
s�1 at 15 m. For instance, the flow intensification on 12 Oc-
tober 2010, associated with a southeasterly storm lasting
several days, was well reproduced in the model for both
depths.

[17] The decrease of flow intensity with depth demon-
strates that the model was capable of reproducing vertical
mixing dynamics, with net momentum transfer from the
surface into the deeper layers. The peaks that were not
properly reproduced by the simulations occurred during
periods with poor wind stress and pressure gradient skill ;
this was likely caused by limited temporal and horizontal
resolution in the atmospheric and remote forcing fields.

[18] Basic statistics of the depth-averaged modeled and
observed flows at A1 and A2 are shown in Table 1 for the
along- and cross-shelf directions. The mean and standard

deviation of the model velocity exhibited good agreement
with observed values. Mean water current differences
between the FIELD1 and FIELD2 campaigns (e.g., preva-
lent southwestward flow during FIELD2) were also well
reproduced by the model.

[19] The along-shelf and cross-shelf ADCP velocities for
A1 and A2, as obtained during FIELD1 and FIELD2 (Fig-
ure 4), were graphically compared with the model simula-
tions through Taylor diagrams [Taylor, 2001]. This
diagram characterizes the similarity between model and
observations in terms of their correlation, the centered root-
mean-square difference (CRMSD), and the amplitude of
their variations (represented by their standard deviations).
The model skill improves as the points get closer to the ob-
servation reference point in the diagram. In general, the
model results showed a good agreement with the observa-
tions in the prevalent along-shelf direction, with correla-
tions larger than 0.5 and normalized standard deviations
and CRMSD between 0.6 and 1. In the cross-shelf direc-
tion, the model results showed slightly larger discrepancies
with the observations. In this case, correlations were
between 0.4 and 0.6 and the normalized standard deviations
and CRMSD were between 0.5 and 1 (Figure 4). The Tay-
lor diagrams also showed the varying skill in the vertical
structure of the velocity. In both the along-shelf and cross-
shelf directions, the model did best at reproducing the sur-
face layers. During the spring FIELD2 measurements, the
model results at A2 displayed some significant discrepan-
cies in the middle part of the water column, likely associ-
ated with an increasing stratification that was not properly
simulated by the model.

[20] To expand the skill assessment, the cost function
[O’Neill et al., 2012] for the depth-averaged velocities was
calculated in both cross-shelf and along-shelf directions.
The cost function (�) represents a measure of the ratio of
model error to the observed variance:

�2 ¼
1

N�20

XN
n¼1

Mn � Onð Þ2 ð1Þ

where On and Mn are observed and modeled values, respec-
tively, N is the number of data points and �20 is the variance

of the observations. For the depth-averaged along-shelf
direction � ranged between 0.37 and 0.41, while in the
cross-shelf direction it ranged between 0.52 and 0.81
(Table 2). Holt et al. [2005] identified 0.4 as the cost func-
tion threshold below which the variables are ‘‘well-
modeled’’ and 1.0 as the threshold below which the model
has predictive skill. Therefore, our model results can be
considered adequate to reproduce the flow especially in the
along-shelf direction.

3. Results

3.1. Atmospheric Forcing and Land-Sea Fluxes

[21] The annual cycle of meteorological forcing was ana-
lyzed in terms of net heat flux and wind stress. The local
net heat flux and the wind stress fields, as extracted from
the ECMWF products, are shown in Figure 5. The net heat
flux variability was concentrated in the annual cycle, being
much greater than the variability at other time scales
(Figure 5a). The annual cycle in net flux was predominantly
associated with the incoming solar radiation, reaching a
maximum during summer, which lead to a net heat flux of
�300 W m�2, and to the longwave and latent heat back
radiation, peaking during winter and causing a minimum
net heat flux of � �225 W m�2. The heat budget in this
area follows a marked seasonal cycle with relatively small
interannual variability [Castellari et al., 1998], with down-
ward solar radiation ranging from 80 W m�2 (winter) to
360 W m�2 (summer), net longwave radiation ranging
from 50 W m�2 (July) to 100 W m�2 (December), sensible
heat flux ranging from �10 W m�2 (July) to 50 W m�2
(January), and latent heat flux from 60 W m�2 (July) to 180
W m�2 (January).

[22] The low-pass filtered wind stress (cut-off frequency
of 0.1 day�1) exhibited significant temporal variability
(Figure 5b). Four typical situations may be identified for
the period from May 2010 to April 2011, consistent with
wind climatology studies in the region [Font, 1990;
Bola~nos et al., 2009]. Southerly winds (upwelling-favor-
able) dominated during the summer season (from mid-May
to the end of September). These winds were usually weak
and partly modified by sea breeze [Font, 1990]. October
was characterized by several northeasterly storm events
associated with periods of cyclogenesis over the Gulf of
Lion, a typically recurrent fall phenomenon [Bola~nos et al.,
2009; Renault et al., 2012]. November and December
were dominated by ‘‘land’’ winds called Mistral [Bola~nos-
Sanchez et al., 2007]. Finally, during the period of January-
April, northeasterly winds (downwelling-favorable) were
prevalent but with high variability in wind direction.

[23] The Llobregat and Besos river discharge time series
were consistent with the Mediterranean climate
(Figure 5c). Two high-flow regimes, associated with wet
seasons (spring and autumn), were observed between the
low-flow conditions that occur during the dry seasons
(summer and winter). The seasonal cycle was more evident
in the Llobregat River as it has a larger mean flow consist-
ent with its greater catchment area [Liquete et al., 2009].

3.2. Along-Shelf Analysis

[24] The biweekly-mean depth-averaged along-shelf cur-
rents, observed during both surveys at A1, are included in

Figure 3. Time series of along-shelf current simulated
and measured at the Llobregat buoy location at 1 m (top)
and 15 m (bottom) depths.

Figure 6. The along-shelf currents were near zero during
FIELD1 (late-fall and winter) and southwestward during
FIELD2 (spring). When observational data were not avail-
able, then model output at A1 was used for the analysis. Max-
imum along-shelf velocities were estimated for March and
April 2010. The standard deviation during these 2 months, as
computed using model outputs (Figure 6), was smaller than
the mean flow, suggesting a limited occurrence of flow rever-
sals. During the rest of the year, the flow temporal variability
was larger than the mean, suggesting that northwestward and
southeastward flow reversals were common.

[25] Assuming hydrostatic flow and neglecting the non-
linear terms, wind-wave momentum fluxes, and baroclinic
contributions to pressure gradient, the along-shelf depth-
averaged momentum balance may be written as

where v and u are the along and cross-shelf depth-averaged
velocities, respectively, f is the Coriolis parameter, � is the

sea-level, �0 is the reference density, H is water depth, and
�ys, �yb are the sea surface (wind) and bottom along-shelf
stresses, respectively. The terms in equation (2), from left
to right, are local acceleration, Coriolis force, barotropic
pressure gradient, and the volume forces associated to the
wind and bottom stresses. The size of the neglected terms
(e.g., nonlinear or baroclinic pressure gradient terms) is
likely important in shorter than monthly time scales [Gri-
foll et al., 2012] and for specific areas. For example, the
wind-wave momentum flux only becomes predominant in
the proximity of the surf zone [Lentz et al., 1999; Lentz
and Fewings, 2012].

[26] When enough data were available, the Coriolis, bar-
otropic pressure gradient, and frictional terms were esti-
mated using observations, as in Grifoll et al. [2012].
Differences in wind and bottom stress momentum terms
were observed between FIELD1 (fall/winter) and FIELD2
(spring). The pressure gradient force (i.e., –g @�/@y) was
estimated only during FIELD2 because of the availability
of consistent sea-level data for the Catalan Sea only during
that period. The Coriolis term had similar magnitude during

both periods, being much smaller than the other terms.
Monthly averaged model outputs were used to investigate
the temporal variability of the momentum terms for the
entire seasonal cycle. Model-derived momentum terms
were consistent with the momentum terms estimated from
observations. The model barotropic pressure gradient was
computed by differentiating the sea level in contiguous
computational grid cells. Bottom frictional and Coriolis
terms were computed from model velocity fields and the
wind stress term from atmospheric forcing.

[27] The temporal evolution of the momentum terms
(Figure 6b) reveals that along-shelf pressure gradient and
wind stress were the dominant forces in the momentum bal-
ance. The size of the bottom friction term was substantially
smaller than the pressure gradient and wind stress except
during spring. The acceleration term (not shown) was at
least one order of magnitude smaller than the Coriolis term
at monthly time scales. The largest term corresponded to
the pressure gradient force which, except during October,
was always negative (in the same direction as the flow). Dur-
ing the summer months, the size of the pressure gradient term
was relatively constant, but during the rest of the year it exhib-
ited sizeable variability. The role of the along-shelf wind stress
varied throughout the year but generally opposed the flow. Pos-
itive wind stress was predominant during summer (June-Sep-
tember, due to southwesterly winds, Figure 5), opposing the
pressure gradient force. During October, the period with high-
est storm activity, the wind stress acted in the same direction as
the flow and opposed the pressure gradient force. During No-
vember and December, the wind stress (dominated by westerly

winds) increased in magnitude and opposed a reinforced pres-
sure gradient force. During March and April, both the wind
stress (northeasterly winds) and the pressure gradient force had
the same direction, causing the southwestward currents to
reach a maximum during this period.

[28] The bottom stress term varied significantly along
the year, with low and moderate magnitudes during most of
the year except during March and April when bottom stress
became dominant. The Coriolis term was small during the
entire year so that its influence in the momentum equation
was only noticeable when the other terms were small (e.g.,
July). The secondary role of the Coriolis term on the along-
shelf momentum balance was consistent with the strong
along-shelf flow polarization. The size of the momentum
terms, as calculated using either the numerical model or the
observations, was similar, therefore confirming the robust-
ness of our analysis.

[29] The residual in the along-shelf momentum balance
included local flow accelerations and nonlinear effects
occurring at time scales shorter than monthly periods, there-
fore being partially compensated when calculating monthly
averages. The size of the acceleration and nonlinear terms
for periods of 3–5 days was as large as 65 � 10�6 m s�2, as
estimated from observations [Grifoll et al., 2012], but when
averaged over a 3 week period the local acceleration reduced
to 0.2 � 10�6 m s�2. This value was of the same order as
the residual in the along-shelf momentum balance, its root-
mean-square (RMS) value being 0.3 � 10�6 m�s�2.

[30] Another term included in the residual is the baro-
clinic pressure gradient term. In the along-shelf direction,
this baroclinic term may be evaluated from model output as

[31] With the help of this last equation, the calculated
average monthly value in the along-shelf direction was 0.1
� 10�6 m s�2, consistent with estimates from observations
in the CS [Grifoll et al., 2012].

[32] The monthly-mean modeled along-shelf vertical ve-
locity profiles exhibited substantial differences between the
summer months and the rest of the year (Figure 7). The ver-
tical profiles were consistent with the depth-averaged
velocities (Figure 6a), exhibiting larger along-shelf veloc-
ities during spring. During summer (June to September),
the velocity was maximum in mid-water depths and
approached zero near the sea bottom, with surface reversals
in June and September. The vertical profiles were fairly ho-
mogeneous during fall and winter with almost inappreci-
able differences between the motion in the upper and lower
layers (particularly November to February). March, April,
and May exhibited moderate vertical gradients with mini-
mum velocities near the bottom. These spring months
showed along-shelf vertical profiles with larger surface
velocities than the rest of the year. The observed vertical
profiles (not shown) revealed a similar along-shelf velocity
structure, with maximum flow during spring.

can be written considering local acceleration, Coriolis

[34] Momentum fluxes due to waves may be significant
at depths of 25 m during storm events, but at monthly time-
scales they may be neglected because the average wave cli-
mate of the Mediterranean Sea is not highly energetic
[Bola~nos et al., 2009]. Figure 8 shows biweekly mean mo-
mentum terms as estimated from observations; note that
the available sea-level data did not allow the estimation of
the cross-shelf pressure gradient. The Coriolis force and
likely the cross-shore pressure gradient force were the dom-
inant terms during FIELD1 and FIELD2, while bottom and
wind stresses were second-order terms.

[35] Monthly-averaged model output is used to comple-
ment field data (Figure 8). According to these results, the
prevalent momentum balance during the entire year was

between the Coriolis force and the cross-shelf pressure gra-
dient force, i.e., the along-shelf current drives the cross-
shore velocity (equation (4)) which, because of the coastal
constraint, induces a cross-shelf elevation gradient until a
cross-shore geostrophic is attained. Both terms were highly
correlated and larger than the frictional terms and at least
three orders of magnitude greater than the acceleration
term (not shown). The wind stresses were only noticeable
when the pressure gradient and Coriolis terms were small.
For instance, November was characterized by energetic
‘‘land’’ winds that increased the relative importance of the
surface frictional term in the momentum balance until
reaching the same magnitude as the Coriolis term.
The cross-shelf bottom stress term was an order of magni-
tude smaller than the two dominant terms year round.
The residual of the cross-shelf momentum balance was
small in comparison to the prevailing geostrophic
balance (RMS of the residual term was 0.9 � 10�6 m s�2).
The residual also included baroclinic effects, which are
estimated as

[36] The average monthly baroclinic term in the cross-
shelf direction was 1 � 10�6 m s�2. There was an enhanced
baroclinic contribution in the proximity of the plume dur-
ing periods of large river discharge, approximately 10 times
larger than during periods of low discharge. These values
were consistent with baroclinic terms as estimated from
observations in the CS [Grifoll et al., 2012]. River plume
dynamics was not further considered as it falls below the
spatial scales of interest for our study.

[37] The vertical profiles of the cross-shelf velocity
(Figure 9) exhibited higher variability than the along-shelf
profiles (Figure 7), although their amplitude was substan-
tially smaller because of the coastal boundary constraint.
During those months with persistent cross-shelf winds the
profiles displayed the largest vertical structure. In Novem-
ber/December, when the Mistral land winds dominated,
the vertical profiles were characterized by surface layer
flow in the same direction as the wind and opposite sub-
surface velocities. In this case, the evident inverse rela-
tionship between cross-shelf wind and bottom stress was
consistent with a two-layer cross-shelf flow structure
driven by cross-shelf wind forcing [Fewings et al., 2008].
This suggests that cross-shelf winds may drive significant
cross-shelf circulation in the inner shelf, when the top and
bottom boundary layers overlap [Tilburg, 2003]. In Janu-
ary and March, the velocity profile was reversed, with
onshore flow in the upper layer and offshore interior flow,
reflecting downwelling conditions consistent with the
observed along-shelf northeasterly winds (Figure 5b).
This situation was similar to typical mid-shelf circulation
patterns, where the surface and bottom layers do not over-
lap [Fewings et al., 2008]. The dynamics at 24 m depth
responded to local forcing but it could also be possibly
affected by along-shelf divergences that generated
onshore/offshore fluxes. Thus, the changing conditions at
the study location probably cause the area to behave as
‘‘inner-shelf’’ during times when rotational effects were
small (e.g., cross-shelf winds driving cross-shelf trans-

port) and ‘‘mid-shelf’’ during times when rotation was
more important (along-shelf winds driving cross-shelf
transport). Also, the small influence of wind stress was
limited to the uppermost layers and likely the vertical pro-
files responded to weak upwelling/downwelling processes
that were not captured at monthly scales.

4. Discussion

[38] Seasonal changes in the inner-shelf circulation
depend on the relative importance of the predominant forc-
ing mechanisms in the momentum balance. The most com-
mon along-shelf flow was southwestward but flow
reversals occurred during most of the year. Except October,
March, and April, the prevalent southwestward flow was in
the same direction as the dominant along-shelf pressure
gradient force. During October, the along-shelf wind stress
opposed the pressure gradient force and the resulting flow.
This negative correlation between wind and pressure gradi-
ent force was presumably associated with the local
response of the flow to spatial variations in forcing and ba-
thymetry [Lentz and Fewings, 2012], as reported for many
continental shelves (e.g., Northern California Shelf, Lentz
[1994]; Caribbean coast of Colombia, Maza et al. [2006];
West Florida Shelf, Liu and Weisberg, [2005]). In these
cases, the along-shelf wind stress is the dominant driver of
the along-shelf current on the inner-shelf and bottom fric-
tion, pressure gradient and the Coriolis force are conse-
quences of the wind stress forcing [Liu and Weisberg,
2005]. The inner-shelf geometry, relative to the regional
wind regime, defines the resulting momentum balance.

[39] In some cases, along-shelf pressure gradient is asso-
ciated with a nonlocal origin [Hickey, 1984; Lentz and
Winant, 1986]) and the negative correlation between pres-
sure gradient force and wind stress can disappear. During
March and April 2011, wind stress and pressure gradient
force were not anticorrelated (both have the same along-
shelf direction) and therefore bottom stress played a greater
role (Figure 6b). In this case, a remote or nonlocal forcing
is likely responsible for the observed pressure gradient and
results in low correlations with local wind. During spring
conditions (from March to May), the along-shelf flow

reached maximum values and the resulting momentum bal-
ance was substantially different from the rest of the year.
This spring behavior reflects the existence of nonlocal
processes that lead to along-shelf pressure gradients as
reported in the Oregon [Hickey, 1984] and California
[Lentz and Winant, 1986; Hickey et al., 2003] shelves.

[40] The regional surface circulation of the
Catalan/Balearic Sea is characterized by the presence of
the Northern Current running southwest from the north
until the center of the Gulf of Valencia (Figure 1). Mason
and Pascual [2012] examined the seasonal sea level anom-
aly fields from 18 years of the 1/8� AVISO merged Medi-
terranean data. Their results showed that in the proximity
of our study area, off the northern end of the city of Barce-
lona, the seasonal Northern Current intensifies during

winter-spring and weakens in summer. In this sense,
weekly AVISO Mediterranean data can be used to estimate
the changes in absolute dynamic topography (ADT) values
for our period of interest (May 2010 to April 2011). The
1/8� resolution represents about 10 and 14 km in the zonal
and latitudinal directions off the city of Barcelona so that in
some locations the shelf was barely resolved. Despite the
resolution deficiency in the inner shelf, ADT could be use-
ful to understand how the regional dynamics may have
affected the shelf circulation (Figure 10).

[41] A predominant cyclonic gyre, formed by the North-
ern and Balearic Currents, was present year-round. High
ADT values along the Catalan shore and further south, in
the Gulf of Valencia, may usually be tracked upstream into
the Gulf of Lion. In the proximity of the Catalan shelf, the

cross-shelf pressure gradient increased slowly between
June 2010 and October 2010, remaining relatively high
between October 2010 and December 2010 and decreasing
between December and April 2011. In October 2010, an
isolated ADT high, a mesoscale feature with diameter close
to 100 km, was located offshore at the latitude of the city
of Barcelona and appeared to temporarily break the pre-
dominant offshore cyclonic regional circulation. A compar-
ison of Figure 10 with Figures 6–8 reveals the important
role of the along-shelf wind in modulating the along-shelf
pressure gradient. Figure 7 shows that the along-shelf flow
weakened in September 2010, with the along-shelf pressure
gradient force being balanced by the wind stress (Figure 6),
and completely changed in October 2010 in comparison to
previous months.

[42] October was dominated by intense winds from the
northeast, which drove a moderate surface south-westward
current and caused a local inversion in the pressure gradi-
ent. This was a spatially limited feature as the currents

were small and had no possibility of draining the high
water elevations found along the coast, as reflected by the
ADT distribution during 13 October (Figure 10). The mes-
oscale feature located off Barcelona may have been the out-
come of these dynamics, being responsible for temporarily
closing the cyclonic regional Northern-Balearic gyre off
Barcelona (Figure 10); at this time, the location off Barce-
lona acted as a stagnation point for offshore water flow. In
March and April 2011, high south-westward flow probably
drove the rapid decrease in ADT within coastal and deep
waters of the Gulf of Lion (Figure 10), consistent with the
nonlocal origin of the along-shelf pressure gradient.

[43] The storm during 10–15 October was a typical event
originated by a cyclogenesis in the Northwest Mediterra-
nean Sea, favored by orographic effects and intensified by
the air-sea contrast [Jans�a, 1994]. Due to their frequency,
duration, and intensity, cyclogeneses play an important role
in the climate of the region [Lionello et al., 2007], causing
extreme wind and wave events [Bola~nos-Sanchez et al.,

2007]. The number, timing, and intensity of the events gen-
erated over sea during fall and winter may change greatly
from 1 year to another [Lionello et al., 2007].

[44] To analyze the stratification in the water column,
the potential energy anomaly (�) was obtained from CTD
measurements (Figure 11) during fall (16 November 2010
and 2 December 2010, during FIELD1) and spring (10
April 2011, during FIELD2). The anomaly quantifies the
deficit in potential energy (PE) due to stratification com-
pared to the fully mixed water column and is computed as

where � is the vertically averaged density and PEmixed is
the potential energy for fully mixed water conditions. The
seasonal cycle for � may be inferred from model output.
The results show maximum values during July and August
(25 J m�3) and minimum values during winter (�0 J m�3),
associated with well-stratified and well-mixed conditions,
respectively. The maximum stratification was observed in
July and corresponded with a slope Burger number (defined
as S¼	N/f, where A is the bottom slope, N is the buoyancy
frequency, and f is the Coriolis parameter) of S¼ 1.7. Dur-
ing weak stratification conditions (e.g., December), the
Burger number was 0.17. The S value under stratification
conditions was relatively high when compared with other
shelves [Lentz and Chapman, 2004] due to the steepness of
the Catalan shelf (note that the shelf width in CS is rela-
tively narrow, � 20 km).

[45] River discharge peaks (May, October, and March)
were not synchronous with maximum � values, suggesting
that the seasonal � cycle was primarily controlled by heat
flux at monthly scales. However, high � standard devia-
tions were observed during months of peak river discharge,
implying that the main effect of the rivers was to increase
the stratification variability. In consequence, high heat flux
combined with mild winds resulted in increased thermal
stratification in the water column, consistent with the analy-
sis of potential energy changes presented in Grifoll et al.
[2012]. Directly influenced by stratification, the vertical
along-shelf velocity profiles (Figure 7) exhibit a multilayer
structure during summer, consistent with the increased �.
Stratification tends to decouple the velocities at depth, of-
ten resulting in decreased velocities or flow reversals. Such

strong decoupling was only obvious in the across-shelf cur-
rents (Figure 8), which were far from geostrophic balance
(Figure 6), therefore pointing at the importance of internal
friction during highly stratified conditions.

[46] Cross-shelf dynamics were dominated by the geo-
strophic balance between Coriolis acceleration and cross-
shelf pressure gradient force. This balance is common in
open-ocean conditions and also in shelf environments with
depths similar to our study area (e.g., Lee et al. [1989] in
South Atlantic Bight, USA; Lentz et al. [1999] in North
Carolina inner-shelf, USA). The monthly evolution of the
cross-shelf balance was affected by the along-shelf current
variability. For example, large along-shelf velocities during
March 2011 yielded cross-shelf terms larger than
during September or November 2010, when along-shelf
velocities were small. For the latter situation, the frictional
forces played a significant role because of the decreased
prevalence of the geostrophic balance, for example,
because of the presence of ‘‘land’’ winds (November 2010).
Overall, the seasonal cycle in the cross-shelf direction was
less evident than in the along-shelf because of the domi-
nance of the geostrophic equilibrium.

[47] The observed and modeled circulation patterns dur-
ing the March 2010–April 2011 period are likely represen-
tative of the seasonal variability within the inner-shelf of
the CS. A clear seasonal pattern, consistent with the Medi-
terranean climate, appears in all forcing mechanisms: con-
tinental run-off [Liquete et al., 2009], wind variability
[Font et al., 1990], storm events [Bola~nos et al., 2009;
Renault et al., 2012], sea-level [Marcos and Tsimplis,
2007], evaporation minus precipitation and heat fluxes
[Castellari et al., 1998]. Preliminary results suggest that
interannual variability in the inner-shelf is relatively small
when compared to the size of the seasonal cycle described
herein (not shown). Reliable interannual observations are
needed to support such estimates. It is possible that subsea-
sonal fluctuations, such as the frequency of short-term river
and wind events, may drive some annual variability, but
this analysis is left for future studies.

[48] Previous studies on the Catalan Sea have suggested
that in the outer shelf and slope the subinertial motions of
the along-slope flow are affected by the shelf-slope front
[Font et al., 1990; Salat et al., 2002]. The Northern current
flows southwestward in geostrophic balance, associated
with the shelf-slope front [Millot, 1999] and characterized
by small frictional influences. Our results underscore the
relevance of the cross-shelf geostrophic balance even
within the inner shelf but also point at the existence of sig-
nificant along-shelf frictional influences. The frictional
terms may be responsible for a lag of correlation between
inner- and outer-shelf currents, with local changes in the
along-shelf direction.

[49] Numerical model outputs allow the computation of
the momentum terms during the entire year ensuring physi-
cal consistency among the terms. The size of the momen-
tum terms calculated using model outputs were similar to
the estimates using observations (Figures 6b and 8). Grifoll
et al. [2012] highlighted the uncertainties when estimating
some of the momentum terms in the CS from observations.
For example, the along-shelf pressure gradient was esti-
mated in FIELD2 from two sea-level gauge stations

separated by 100 km. Hickey [1984] noted that common
sea-level differences in the along-shelf are of the order of a
few centimeters (for distances of the order of the external
Rossby radius), which means that the uncertainty in the
observations may lead to misrepresentations of the baro-
tropic pressure gradient term. Fewings and Lentz [2010]
also highlighted the small horizontal scale that character-
izes the across-shelf sea level gradient, potentially resulting
in underestimates when using observational data. In our
investigation, we have relied upon properly assessed nu-
merical model implementations to complement observatio-
nal data, providing a successful combination for inner-shelf
research.

[50] The resulting along-shelf momentum balance, with
dominant pressure gradient and frictional forces, is highly
sensitive to total water depth. The inner-shelf, here charac-
terized by a location at 24 m depth, acts as a transition
between the near-shore, where the balance presumably
would be between the surface gravity wave stress and bot-
tom friction [Lentz, 1994; Fewings and Lentz, 2010], and
the outer-shelf, where the cross-shore geostrophic balance
(pressure gradient and Coriolis force) is dominant [Winant
et al., 1987; Fewings et al., 2008]. This behavior is com-
mon to many shelves where field data at comparable depths
yield similar momentum balances [Lentz et al., 1999; Maza
et al., 2002; Liu and Weisberg, 2005]. Additionally, the
orography of the region is characterized by river valleys
(e.g., Besos and Llobregat) that increase the spatial vari-
ability of the wind field (wind jets) with a potentially large
influence on hydrodynamics [Schaeffer et al., 2011]. Deter-
mining the depth where wind waves or rotational effects
are important is left for future studies on the spatial vari-
ability of the inner-shelf dynamics.

5. Summary and Conclusions

[51] Our analysis represents a first interpretation of the
seasonal dynamics on the Catalan Sea inner-shelf based on
observations and numerical model results. It has focused on
a detailed analysis of field and numerical data from one sin-
gle location (24 m depth), where current observations
allowed model verification. A clear seasonal along-shelf
pattern is found. During summer, the pressure gradient
force dominates the momentum balance counteracting the
surface momentum introduced by wind stress. Significant
vertical shear in the water column is also observed, consist-
ent with relatively large stratification caused by heat fluxes
and, to a smaller degree, by rivers discharge. Fall may be
considered as a transitional period, generally characterized
by its instability. For instance, October 2010 was dominated
by a typical storm with easterly winds resulting in a predom-
inant along-shelf force balance between wind stress and
pressure gradient. These conditions exhibit the largest inter-
annual variability, as the timing and number of storms is
concentrated during the fall and winter seasons but may vary
significantly from year to year. During winter, the atmos-
pheric forcing is characterized by energetic winds with an
important ‘‘land’’ component. The along-shelf pressure gra-
dient force dominates the momentum balance with along-
shelf winds opposing the flow. Weak stratification and ho-
mogeneous vertical velocity profiles, due to cooling and low

river discharge, allow the increased wind energy to mix the
entire water column. Finally, spring is characterized by
highly variable winds. There is an intensification of the
along-shelf velocity due to the combined effect of the pres-
sure gradient force and along-shelf winds that is partly coun-
teracted by bottom friction. Our analysis suggests that
during spring the pressure gradient is mostly remote, as
shown by the regional distribution of dynamic topography.
Also, vertical shear and stratification develops due to river
discharge and the gradually increasing heat flux.

[52] Overall, we may conclude that, even in the inner-
shelf, the cross-shelf momentum balance is mostly con-
trolled by a geostrophic equilibrium between the cross-shelf
pressure gradient and Coriolis. Intensification of the along-
shelf velocities (e.g., March-April) controls the size of the
geostrophic equilibrium and thus the cross-shelf momentum
balance. Only when the along-shelf flow is reduced (e.g.,
November), the frictional effects may increase their impor-
tance in the cross-shelf momentum balance.
