Abstract. Wave–current interactions (WCIs) are investi-
gated. The study area is located at the northern margin
of the Ebro shelf (northwestern Mediterranean Sea), where
episodes of strong cross-shelf wind (wind jets) occur. The
aim of this study is to validate the implemented coupled sys-
tem and investigate the impact of WCIs on the hydrodynam-
ics of a wind-jet region. The Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere–
Wave–Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system,
which uses the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) and
Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) models, is used in a
high-resolution domain (350 m). Results from uncoupled nu-
merical models are compared with a two-way coupling simu-
lation. The results do not show substantial differences in the
water current field between the coupled and the uncoupled
runs. The main effect observed when the models are coupled
is in the water column stratification, due to the turbulent ki-
netic energy injection and the enhanced surface stress, lead-
ing to a larger mixed-layer depth. Regarding the effects on
the wave fields, the comparison between the coupled and the
uncoupled runs shows that, when the models are coupled,
the agreement of the modeled wave period significantly im-
proves and the wave energy (and thus the significant wave
height) decreases when the current flows in the same direc-
tion as the waves propagate.

1 Introduction

During the last decade, several water circulation models have
been developed, including the wind–wave-induced currents.
There are two different formulations to include the so-called
wave effects on currents (WECs) in the three-dimensional
primitive equations: by means of the radiation-stress gradi-
ent (Mellor, 2011) and with the vortex force (VF) formalism
(Uchiyama et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2012). The VF formal-
ism separates the conservative and non-conservative contri-
butions in the momentum balance equations, which allows
one to evaluate flow fields within both inner shelf and surf
zone environments (Kumar et al., 2012).

From a modeling perspective, several circulation and wave
models have been coupled in order to consider the wave–
current interactions (WCIs). For instance, Xie et al. (2001)
coupled a 3-D ocean model (Princeton Ocean Model, POM)
with the WAM wave model and found that wind waves can
significantly affect coastal ocean currents both at the surface
and near the seabed. Osuna and Wolf (2005) implemented the
coupling between the circulation Proudman Oceanographic
Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modeling System (POLCOMS)
and the WAM model in the Irish Sea. This system was
then modified by Bolaños et al. (2011), who included three-
dimensional interactions following Mellor (2003, 2005) and
applied the coupled model system to the Mediterranean Sea.
Tang et al. (2007) implemented the WCI in a 3-D ocean
model (POM) and a spectral wave model (WAVEWATCH
III), based on the Jenkins (1987) formulation, and evalu-
ated the model by comparison with surface velocity data de-
rived from surface drifters. McWilliams et al. (2004) devel-
oped a multi-scale asymptotic theory for the evolution and
interaction of currents and surface gravity waves of finite

depth, which was then implemented and extended for ap-
plications within the surf zone in the UCLA ROMS model
by Uchiyama et al. (2010). Warner et al. (2008b) used the
Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) to couple the ocean circu-
lation Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) and the sur-
face wave model Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) and
included nearshore processes, such as radiation-stress terms
based on Mellor (2003, 2005) and a surface roller model
(Svendsen, 1984; Svendsen et al., 2002). This system was
then further developed by Warner et al. (2010) to include
one-way grid refinement in the oceanic and wave models,
coupling to an atmospheric model in order to include effects
of sea surface temperature and waves, and to provide inter-
polation mechanisms to allow the models to compute on dif-
ferent grids. The resulting system is known as the Coupled
Ocean–Atmosphere–Wave–Sediment Transport (COAWST)
modeling system. Then, Kumar et al. (2012) implemented
the VF formalism into the COAWST modeling system, with
some modifications to the method of Uchiyama et al. (2010).

Previous studies have analyzed the physical processes in-
volved in the WCIs and the relevance of the coupling effects
can vary depending, mainly, on the water depth and the en-
ergy of the studied event. The WCIs have demonstrated to
be important in coastal regions (Wolf and Prandle, 1999; Ku-
mar et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2017) and estuaries (Olabarrieta
et al., 2011; Bolaños et al., 2014), and during energetic events
such as hurricanes or strong wind events (Xie et al., 2008;
Sheng et al., 2010; Renault et al., 2012; Benetazzo et al.,
2013). As a matter of fact, the previous cited studies have
different focuses and are applied to different domain types
(going from seas to surf zones and estuaries), and thus the
grid resolutions used in these studies varies from a few me-
ters to a few kilometers. For instance, Osuna and Wolf (2005)
studied the coupling effects in the Irish Sea, Benetazzo et al.
(2013) analyzed the WCI in a semi-enclosed basin with par-
ticular focus on events associated with prevailing and dom-
inant winds of the region, and Kumar et al. (2012) applied
different WCI tests in coastal regions, including the study of
obliquely incident waves on a planar beach and the analysis
of the wave-induced cross-shore flows in the inner shelf.

The north Ebro shelf (northwestern Mediterranean Sea)
is a region characterized by northwestern (NW) winds that
are channeled through the Ebro Valley and which result in
cross-shelf wind jets when they reach the sea. This region is
very interesting from a meteo-oceanographic point of view
because multiple processes take place, such as bimodal wave
spectra and the development of a two-layer cross-shelf flow.
Some authors have investigated the circulation patterns (Gri-
foll et al., 2015; Ràfols et al., 2017a) and the wave field
(Bolaños-Sanchez et al., 2007; Grifoll et al., 2016; Ràfols
et al., 2017b) during these NW wind-jet events but less ef-
forts have been made to investigate the WCI in the region.
Due to the limited observational data, in order to study the
wind-jet-induced dynamics of the region, the use of numeri-
cal models is required. However, at the same time, this makes

the investigation rather challenging and forces a rather qual-
itative analysis based on the modeled physical processes’ re-
liability. The purpose of this study is to validate the imple-
mented coupled system and investigate the coupling effects
on the circulation and the wave field at the continental shelf
during a wind-jet event. With this aim, results from uncou-
pled models are compared with the outputs from a two-way
coupled numerical model. The selected study period is from
15 March to 15 May 2014 because it contains four wind-jet
episodes. Additionally, this period has previously been used
to validate numerical models in the study region, and the
wind–wave characterization (Ràfols et al., 2017b) and wa-
ter shelf circulation (Ràfols et al., 2017a) were investigated
by combining numerical efforts and in situ observations.

This work is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the study
area and the methods used in this work are presented. The
results are shown in Sect. 3, discerning between the coupling
effects on currents and the coupling effects on waves. A dis-
cussion of the results can be found in Sect. 4, and the main
conclusions of the work are highlighted in Sect. 5.

2 Study area and methodology

2.1 Study area

The north Ebro shelf is located at the southern part of the
Catalan coast, at 40.4–41.1◦ N and 0.4–1.3◦ E (see Fig. 1).
The shelf of this region is characterized by the transition from
a narrow shelf (∼ 10 km) at its northern margin to a broader
shelf (∼ 60 km) towards the south.

The most characteristic wind of the region is the north-
westerly wind (mistral), which is channeled through the Ebro
Valley resulting in a cross-shelf wind jet when it reaches
the sea. This wind jet is related to the presence of a high-
pressure area over the Iberian Peninsula and a low-pressure
area over the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, it is more common
during autumn and winter (Grifoll et al., 2015), when large
atmospheric pressure gradients occur. The predominant re-
gional current is the quasi-permanent slope current known
as the Northern Current, which is an entity flowing along
the continental slope (Millot, 1999) that can be modified by
mesoscale events such as current meandering or eddies (Font
et al., 1995). The water circulation in the inner and middle
shelf presents strong temporal and spatial variability due to
the strong gradients in the bathymetry and wind field associ-
ated with wind-jet episodes (Grifoll et al., 2015; Ràfols et al.,
2017a). The wave climate at the Ebro Delta is characterized
by the predominance of NW waves (which coincides with the
predominance of NW winds), although there are also signifi-
cant storms from the east and south. These storms tend to de-
velop a bimodal directional spectrum due to the coexistence
of wind waves and swell waves (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2008;
Ràfols et al., 2017b). Local wind waves (sea system) show a
broadband spectrum with a high variety of frequencies asso-

ciated with irregular sea states. In contrast, waves generated
far away (swell system) present a narrowband spectrum with
a frequency range with less associated energy. Then, when
the sea and swell systems exist at the same time, bimodal
spectra occur (Ràfols et al., 2017b).

2.2 Data

For validation purposes, oceanographic and coastal meteoro-
logical measurements from Puertos del Estado (http://www.
puertos.es, last access: 6 March 2018) are used. Specifi-
cally, data were obtained from a coastal wave buoy, a deep-
water buoy and high-frequency (HF) radar. The locations are
shown in Fig. 1, jointly with the bathymetry and the numeri-
cal domains.

The coastal wave buoy (CB) is a TRIAXYS buoy located
at 41.07◦ N, 1.19◦ E, at 15 m depth, deployed in November
1992. It provides significant wave height, peak period, nauti-
cal direction and directional wave spectra, among other data.
The deep-water buoy (DB), an ocean Seawatch buoy located
at 40.68◦ N, 1.47◦ E, at 688 m depth, was deployed in Au-
gust 2004. This buoy measures water velocity and water tem-
perature at the subsurface (nominal depth of 3 m), wind vec-
tors at 3 m above the sea surface, significant wave height,
peak period, nautical direction and directional wave spectra,
among other parameters. In order to be able to compare the
measured wind data at 3 m height with the modeled data at
10 m height, the modeled data have been extrapolated from
10 to 3 m using a logarithmic profile (see Appendix A).

The HF radar system used in this work is a CODAR
SeaSonde standard-range system composed of three remote
shelf-based sites that became operational in December 2013.
Each site comprises a transmitter–receiver antenna that op-
erates at a nominal frequency of 13.5 MHz with a 90 kHz
bandwidth. The system provides hourly measurements of
the current velocities in the top meter of the water column
with a horizontal resolution of 3 km and a cutoff filter of
100 cm s−1. More information about the system is available
in Lorente et al. (2015).

2.3 Numerical models

2.3.1 COAWST modeling system description

The COAWST Modeling System (Warner et al., 2010) has
been widely used by many authors to investigate the WCI
(Olabarrieta et al., 2011; Renault et al., 2012; Benetazzo
et al., 2013; Rong et al., 2014; Grifoll et al., 2014; Bruneau
and Toumi, 2016, among others). In this study, the COAWST
modeling system is used to perform the uncoupled ROMS
and SWAN model simulations and a model run with two-way
coupling.

The SWAN model is a third-generation numerical wave
model that computes random, short-crested waves in coastal
regions with shallow water and ambient currents (Booij et al.,

1999). It is based on the action balance equation in terms of
action density (Bretherton and Garrett, 1968) with sources
and sinks, and incorporates state-of-the-art formulations of
wave–wave interactions and the processes of wave genera-
tion and dissipation.

The ROMS model is a split-explicit, free-surface, terrain-
following, primitive equation oceanic model that solves the
3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations using the
hydrostatic and Boussinesq assumptions (Shchepetkin and
McWilliams, 2005; Haidvogel et al., 2008). The model uses
finite-difference approximations on a terrain-following verti-
cal coordinate (sigma coordinate) and on a horizontal curvi-
linear Arakawa-C grid.

The Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT; Larson et al., 2004;
Jacob et al., 2004) is a Fortran90 program that works with the
MPI protocol. It allows the transmission and transformation
of various distributed data between component models using
a parallel coupled approach. When the models are initialized,
each model decomposes its own domain into different sec-
tions, which are distributed to processors. On each processor,
each grid section initializes into MCT and a global map of
the distribution of the segments is computed. Each segment
also initializes an attribute vector that contains the fields to be
exchanged and establishes a router to provide an exchange
pathway between model components. While the simulation
is run, the models reach a synchronization point, fill the at-
tribute vectors with data and exchange fields. Further details
are described in Warner et al. (2008a).

2.3.2 System setup

Three different runs have been performed in this work (see
Fig. 2): one with the ROMS model uncoupled (uncR), one
with the SWAN model uncoupled (uncS) and, finally, one
with the ROMS and SWAN models two-way coupled (cRS).

The numerical domain has a horizontal resolution of 350 m
and, in the ROMS case, a vertical resolution of 20σ levels.
The bathymetry introduced in the models has a grid reso-
lution of 0.0083◦ and was obtained from the General Bathy-
metric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO; https://www.gebco.net,
last access: 10 April 2016). Both SWAN and ROMS mod-
els are forced with hourly atmospheric data from a previous
WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model run pro-
vided by the SMC (Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya) that
has a spatial resolution of 3 km.

In order to generate the boundary conditions for the
SWAN model, a downscaling technique has been used. The
entire system consists of three nested domains (see Fig. 1a).
The largest one covers the western Mediterranean Sea with
a spatial resolution of 15 km and provides boundary condi-
tions to a second-level domain. The latter covers the Balearic
Sea with a spatial resolution of 3 km and provides boundary
conditions to the smaller domain, which has a horizontal res-
olution of 350 m. This study is focused on this last domain.
The nesting between each domain consists of providing the

energy spectra from the coarser domain to the boundary of
the smaller domain. The WRF model provided by the SMC
provides the 10 m surface winds (U10, V 10) forcing and the
initial conditions have been obtained running the model in
stationary mode.

In the SWAN model, non-stationary conditions, spherical
coordinates and nautical convention have been selected. The
wave growth by wind is computed with a sum of a linear
term and an exponential term. For the linear growth, the ex-
pression from Cavaleri and Malanotte-Rizzoli (1981) is used,

and for the exponential growth, the expression and coeffi-
cients from Komen et al. (1984) are used. The nonlinear
quadruplet wave interactions are integrated by a fully explicit
computation of the nonlinear transfer with the discrete inter-
action approximation (DIA; proposed by Hasselmann et al.,
1985) per sweep (using default coefficients). For the white-
capping, the Komen et al. (1984) formulation is used with
Cds = 2.36×10−5, δ = 1 and p = 4. Finally, the Joint North
Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) (Hasselmann et al., 1973)
bottom friction formulation is added with the default coef-
ficients. The spectrum is discretized with a constant relative
frequency resolution of 1f = 1.1 (logarithmic distribution)
and a constant directional resolution of 1θ = 10◦. The dis-
crete frequencies are defined between 0.01 and 1 Hz. Above
the high-frequency cutoff, a diagnostic tail (f−4) is added.

The initial and boundary conditions for the ROMS model
are taken from the Iberian Biscay Irish – Monitoring and
Forecasting Centre (IBI-MFC) product. This product (http:
//marine.copernicus.eu/, last access: 7 April 2018) includes
all main forcings (i.e., tidal forcing, high-frequency atmo-
spheric forcing, freshwater river discharge) and is based on
a (eddy-resolving) Nucleus for European Modelling of the
Ocean (NEMO) model application run at 1/36◦ horizontal
resolution. The outputs provided by the IBI-MFC used in our
numerical model are 3-D daily means of temperature (T ),
salinity (salt) zonal velocity (u), meridional velocity (v) and
2-D (surface) hourly means of sea surface height (ssh) and
barotropic currents (ubar, vbar). The barotropic currents and
the sea surface height are consistently accommodated to the
open boundaries with Flather and Chapman conditions. The
WRF model provided by the SMC provides the atmospheric
forcing fields for the ROMS model, which include 10 m sur-
face winds (U10, V 10), atmospheric pressure (PSFC), rela-

tive humidity (Q2), atmospheric surface temperature (T 2),
precipitation (rain) and shortwave (swrad) and longwave
(lwrad) net heat fluxes to the ocean model. The model uses
these parameters in the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Re-
sponse Experiment (COARE) algorithm (Fairall et al., 1996)
to compute ocean surface stresses and ocean surface net heat
fluxes.

The ROMS model implementation includes a generic
length-scale turbulent vertical mixing scheme with the k− �
parameterization, a logarithmic profile for the bottom bound-
ary layer with a bottom roughness of 0.005 m and horizontal
mixing terms in geopotential surfaces. The Ebro River dis-
charge is characterized with data from the Automatic Hydro-
logic Information System of the Ebro River basin (owned
by the Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro, http://www.
chebro.es, last access: 18 January 2018). The data used to
force the numerical model consist of daily measurements of
river runoff and temperature.

In the two-way coupled run, the WCIs are implemented
exchanging instantaneous values of coupling fields every
20 min. The wave model provides wave direction (Dir),
significant wave height (Hs), wave length (Wlen), peak
wave length (Lwavep), surface and bottom periods (RT P ,
Tmbot), bottom orbital velocity (Ubot), wave energy dis-
sipation (DisBot , DisSurf , DisWcap) and percent wave
breaking (QB) to the ocean model. These parameters are
used by the ocean model in four different mechanisms:

– The first mechanism consists of computing enhanced
bottom stresses due to the effect of turbulence in the
wave boundary layer by means of the SSW (Sherwood–
Signell–Warner) implementation of Madsen (1994) bot-
tom boundary layer formulation.

– The seconds mechanism involves computing enhanced
surface stresses (SStr) due to changes in the surface
roughness z0. In contrast to the COARE algorithm
used in the uncoupled ROMS run, now the Taylor and
Yelland (2001) sea surface roughness closure model,
which is sea-state dependent, is used. Now, the z0 is
derived from z0

Hs
= 1200(Hs/Lp)4.5, where Lp is the

peak wave length.

– The third mechanism is to inject turbulent kinetic en-
ergy (TKE) at the surface due to breaking waves. It is
introduced as a surface flux of turbulence kinetic energy
in the generic length scale method (Warner et al., 2005).

– The fourth mechanism is to include the wave forces us-
ing the VF formalism (Uchiyama et al., 2010; Kumar
et al., 2012, see Sect. 2.4).

The wave model receives currents (us, vs) and sea sur-
face height (ssh) from the ocean model. The surface cur-
rents (us, vs) were computed taking into account the verti-
cal distribution of the current profile using the formulation

presented by Kirby and Chen (1989), which integrates the
near-surface velocity over a depth controlled by the wave
number. The presence of an ambient current may change the
amplitude (e.g., due to an energy transfer between waves and
currents), the frequency (due to the Doppler shift) and the di-
rection (due to current-induced refraction) of the waves. In
this sense, the ocean currents modify the wind speed forcing
with S = f (Uwind− us;Vwind− vs), the wave celerity using
the modified group velocities cx = cgx+us, cy = cgy+vs and
the wave number (derived from the Doppler shift effect; see
Holthuijsen, 2008, Appendix D).

2.4 Momentum balance description

The cross-shelf momentum balance is used to analyze the
coupling effects on the circulation over the continental shelf.
The simplified equations for the VF approach can be ob-
tained after removing the curvilinear terms, body forces and
horizontal and vertical mixing, and then using Cartesian co-
ordinates (Kumar, 2013):

and bottom stress (BStr). The wave-induced terms include
part of the HA term, the HVF term, the StCOR term and
the WF term.

The pressure gradient term includes (Kumar et al., 2012)
the Eulerian non-WEC contribution (P c) and the WEC con-
tribution (PWEC), which can be decomposed in a quasi-static

2.5 Skill assessment techniques

In order to assess the model behavior, the estimation of bias,
the root mean square deviation (RMSD), the Pearson correla-
tion (Pearson’s r) and the model skill score (d , following the
method presented in Willmott, 1981) are undertaken. These
values are defined as follows:

bias=

)2 (6)
d = 1−

∑
|Xmodel−Xobs|

2∑(
|Xmodel−Xobs| + |Xobs−Xobs|

)2 , (7)

where N is the number of samples. Pearson’s r describes
consistent proportional increases or decreases about respec-
tive means of the two quantities, but it makes too few distinc-
tions among the type or magnitudes of possible covariations
(Willmott, 1981). By contrast, d is not a measure of correla-
tion or association in the formal sense but rather a measure
of the degree to which a model’s predictions are error-free.
Unlike r , d is sensitive to differences between the observed
and predicted means as well as to certain changes in pro-
portionality (Willmott, 1981). Note that analogously to r , d
is measured from 0 to 1, 1 denoting maximum agreement.
When computing these metrics, the first 24 h of the model
results were rejected, in order to exclude the possible spin-
up of the model. The time series analyses have demonstrated
that 24 h are enough to spin up the model. Besides, it has to
be noticed that the ROMS model is not initialized from zero
velocities; it reads the initial conditions from the IBI-MFC
model.

For circular data, e.g., wave direction, the metrics are com-
puted as follows:

3.1 Numerical model skill assessment

The ROMS and SWAN models for the same study period
and the same model configurations have been validated thor-
oughly in previous studies (Ràfols et al., 2017a, b). The aim
of this section is to analyze the skill of the coupled run in
comparison to the uncoupled runs.

The first step in the numerical skill assessment is to ex-
amine the quality of the wind field, which is used to force
the numerical models. Table 1 shows the bias, RMSD, r and
d obtained from the comparison between the DB-measured
data and the wind field provided by the SMC (which has been
extrapolated from 10 to 3 m). Figure 3 presents the time se-
ries for the modeled and measured wind intensity at DB. The
comparison shows a slight underestimation of the wind in-
tensity but the main underestimation does not correspond to
the NW wind events, which are the focus of this study. Dur-
ing the study period, four NW wind-jet events have been se-
lected (see the red boxes in Fig. 3). These events were pre-
viously analyzed in Ràfols et al. (2017b), where statistical
metrics for each episode were provided. To see the tempo-
ral evolution of a wind jet more clearly, in Fig. 4a the time
series during the wind-jet E3 event are presented, which is
the event that spans more in space and thus can be observed
in the DB location. Overall, the modeled wind shows less
underestimation (in comparison to measured values) during
the wind-jet events, and the wind-jet temporal evolutions are
properly reproduced.

Table 1 also shows the statistics obtained from the compar-
ison of the measured wave parameters at DB and the modeled
ones. TheHs and Tm02 time series at DB during the wind-jet
E3 event are shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively. The mean
wave period (Tm02) is defined as follows:

where E(ω,θ) is the variance density and ω is the absolute
radian frequency. The latter is determined by the Doppler
shift phenomenon with ω = σ +k ·U, where σ is the relative

radian frequency (i.e., as observed in a frame of reference
moving with the current velocity), k the wave number vector
and U the current vector. In absence of currents, the relative
radian frequency is equal to the absolute radian frequency.
Regarding the Table 1 results, in general, the Hs does not
show relevant differences between the uncS run and the cRS
run results. It is important to note the negative bias, which in-
dicates that theHs parameter is slightly underestimated. This
is a clear consequence of the previously mentioned underesti-
mation of the wind. In contrast, Tm02 shows a clear improve-
ment when the models are coupled. In this case, keeping in
mind the Tm02 definition, it is important to note that the buoy
measures at a fixed location (i.e., in an absolute frame) and,
for this reason, the comparison of the measured period with
the modeled one is more realistic when the results from the
cRS run are used (i.e., the absolute period) instead of the re-
sults from the uncR run (i.e., the relative period). Therefore,
the differences found in the Tm02 parameter might be ex-
plained, in part but not uniquely, by the differences in fre-
quency due to the Doppler shift phenomena that are included
in the wave model when the models are coupled.

Table 2, where the modeled data are compared with mea-
surements from CB, shows similar results to Table 1. The

most noticeable difference between the two tables is the Dir
parameter, which shows better agreement in the DB case.
The comparison at DB shows very good results with strong
correlations and no relevant differences between the uncS

results is obtained when the currents are considered (i.e., with
the cRS run).

In Table 3, the modeled water currents are compared with
the HF radar surface current measurements. The metrics pre-
sented in the table correspond to point P3 and show good
agreement, with skill metrics that are in accordance with val-
ues found in previous work when comparing HF radar data
with modeled data (Port et al., 2011; O’Donncha et al., 2015;
Lorente et al., 2016). Comparing the results from the uncR
run with the results from the cRS run, some differences are
observed (e.g., a decrease of the bias is obtained in the cross-
shelf velocity component when the models are coupled), but
the differences are not relevant enough to discern if one con-
figuration agrees better than the other. A similar conclusion
can be reached analyzing the scatter plots (not shown) com-
paring the HF radar data with the modeled data at P3. The
differences between the cRS and uncR runs are not relevant,
but the modeled cross-shelf components show a better fit
with the measurements, with regression slopes of 1.01 for
both runs, than the along-shelf components, with regression
slopes of 0.64 and 0.68, respectively. In general, the mod-
eled water currents show larger intensities than the measured
ones.

3.2 Description of the coupling effects on currents

Figure 5 compares uncR and cRS run results during the wind-
jet E3 event at P1 (73.7 m depth) and P3 (98.9 m depth) along
with HF radar subinertial water surface current at P3. Follow-
ing Ràfols et al. (2017a), the subinertial currents have been
calculated using a 10th-order Butterworth filter with a cut-
off period of 30 h. The figure also shows the wind intensity

evolution at each point and the Hs comparison between the
uncS and cRS run results. The wind-jet E3 event starts on
25 April at 02:00 UTC, forms very quickly, reaches its max-
imum intensity at 06:00 UTC and fades gradually. The wa-
ter current time series show that, during the wind-jet peak,
the cross-shelf current magnitude increases (it becomes more
negative; i.e., it flows offshore) and, throughout the wind-
jet event, the along-shelf component becomes more negative
(i.e., southwestward). Comparing the results from the uncR
and cRS runs, it is observed that larger differences occur at
the shallowest point (P1), with differences up to 20 cm s−1,
while at P3 both runs present very similar results (with differ-
ences lower than 10 cm s−1). No measured data are available
for P1; thus, it cannot be discerned which run best fits the
observation. In contrast, at P3, the modeled results can be
compared with the HF radar data, but it is difficult to state
which simulation best reproduces the observations. The in-
fluence of waves at the cross-shelf circulation is limited and
the surface circulation of both runs presents similar patterns.

With the aim of visualizing the differences in the current
patterns and the spatial variability between the different runs,
in Fig. 6, the measured HF radar currents are compared with
the surface currents obtained with the uncR and cRS runs
in four snapshots, which correspond to the evolution of the
wind-jet E3 event. For clarity, the figure presents the results
up to the mid-slope. The modeled water currents are more
intense than the water currents measured by the HF radar but
the circulation patterns are consistent. There are slight differ-
ences between the uncR run results and the cRS run results.
An increase of the current intensity is observed at the start
of the wind jet when the waves are considered in the ROMS
model (Fig. 6c and d, second column). In addition, the region
affected by the wind jet seems to be expanded to the north-
east, resulting in stronger water currents in the cRS run. Nev-
ertheless, the main current patterns obtained with both runs
are very similar and coincide with the behavior presented in
Ràfols et al. (2017a).

Figure 7 shows the Hs and surface water current mean of
the hourly instantaneous differences considering the whole
study period, the whole study period except the wind-jet
events and just the four wind-jet events. It is observed that
the major differences are obtained during the wind-jet events.
The mean differences obtained for the whole period are very
similar to the mean differences under no wind-jet condi-
tions, with differences shorter than±5 cm s−1. During wind-
jet conditions, a clear decrease of the surface water current
intensity is observed at the wind-jet axis when the waves
are considered, but the differences are less than 10 cm s−1. In
contrast, at shallow regions, the surface water current inten-
sities are increased, showing differences up to 15–20 cm s−1.
An increase of the current intensity is also observed at the
northeast corner of the domain but there the differences are
just around 5 cm s−1.

The evolution of the buoyancy or Brunt–Väisälä frequency

(N =

, where ρ0 is the reference density and g is
the gravitational acceleration) is investigated in order to ana-
lyze the differences between the uncR and the cRS run results
in the water column structure. Figure 8 shows the Brunt–
Väisälä frequency evolution (before and after the wind jet)
at P3 during the four wind-jet events for both uncR and cRS
runs. It is observed that the vertical structure of the water col-
umn is significantly different when the waves are taken into
account. The cRS run always presents a less stratified water
column, both before and after the wind jet. When a wind jet
occurs, the expected behavior is that the water column will
become less stratified after the wind jet than before it. This
is observed in all the studied wind-jet events but the surface
mixed-layer depth (SML; i.e., the distance from the surface
to the top of the pycnocline) after the wind jet obtained with
the cRS run is larger (i.e., deeper) than the one obtained by
the uncR run. Thus, the vertical mixing is significantly en-
hanced when the waves are taken into account.

Analyzing the results from uncR and cRS runs, it is found
that there is a clear enhancement of the TKE when the
waves are considered, also with some increase of the SStr
(see Fig. 9). Note that the SStr felt by the ocean is equal
to the air-side stress, which in the cRS run includes the
wave-dependent sea surface roughness, but it does not ac-
count for the stress acting on waves and the dissipation due
to wave breaking. The mean TKE and SStr values obtained

with the model during the wind-jet E3 event at P3 shift from
8.14× 10−4 m2 s−2 and 0.25 N m−2 with the uncR run to
5.13× 10−3 m2 s−2 and 0.31 N m−2 with the cRS run. Ad-
ditionally, the TKE and SStr peak coincide with the wind-jet
peak (25 April at 06:00 UTC) and the peak values found at P3
are 2.44×10−3 m2 s−2 and 0.75 N m−2 for the uncR run, and
1.11× 10−2 m2 s−2 and 0.88 N m−2 for the cRS run. Thus,
the TKE is 1 order of magnitude stronger when the waves
are considered, which leads to an enhancement of the water
column mixing and thus a decrease of the stratification.

In order to evaluate how the waves’ effects are taken into
account in the momentum balance, the terms of Eq. (1)
are analyzed. During a calm period before the wind jet,
the cross-shelf momentum balance is between the PG and
COR terms, and the remaining terms are (at least) 1 order
of magnitude smaller. Thus, the coupling effects on the mo-
mentum balance are negligible. In contrast, during a wind-
jet event, more terms are involved in the cross-shelf mo-
mentum balance. From the coastline to 4 km offshore (∼
50 m depth), the WF term (1.85× 10−5 m s−2) is on the
same order of magnitude as the PG (2.42× 10−5 m s−2),
SStr (2.73×10−5 m s−2) andHA (1.99×10−5 m s−2) terms.
From that point to tens of kilometers offshore, the PG
(1.34× 10−5 m s−2) term is mainly balanced by the SStr
(1.07×10−5 m s−2) andWF (5.05×10−6 m s−2) terms, also
including some contribution from the COR and HA terms.
However, theWF term weight is half the weight of the SStr

term. Thus, the WF term included by the VF formalism
plays an important role in the momentum balance in the first
kilometers offshore (i.e., in coastal regions). Analyzing the
WF term, it is found that its main contributor is the surface
streaming (Bsf; 1.65×10−5 and 3.94×10−6 m s−2 for shal-
low and deep water, respectively), especially in shallow wa-
ters, with also some contribution of the wave-breaking term
(Bb; 2.01× 10−6 and 1.11× 10−6 m s−2, respectively). Re-
garding the PG term, its weight is mainly due to the non-

WEC contributions (P c; 1.60×10−5 and 1.37×10−5 m s−2,
respectively) together with some contribution of the quasi-
static response (P qs; 1.37× 10−5 and 3.21× 10−6 m s−2).

3.3 Description of the coupling effects on waves

The irregular nature of wind causes irregular wind waves
of different heights, periods and directions. For this reason,
wind waves are usually described using spectral techniques,

where the random motion of the sea surface is treated as a
summation of harmonic wave components. In Fig. 10, the
wave response during a wind-jet event is analyzed in terms
of the variance density spectrum E(f,θ) evolution obtained
from the numerical model. The one- and two-dimensional
frequency–direction spectra evolution at P2 (i.e., at the wind-
jet axis) obtained with the uncS and cRS runs during the
wind-jet E3 event are compared. The runs show similar spec-
tra evolution patterns. When the wind jet starts, the wave field
is adapted to the new wind, generating a bimodal spectrum
with a wider peak at the NW (which is consistent with the
new wind direction; i.e., it is a new sea system) and a peak at
the south corresponding to the “old” sea system. At the peak
of the wind jet, the spectra are dominated by the new sea sys-
tem and, when the wind-jet intensity diminishes, another new
sea system occurs, while the energy due to the wind jet de-
creases gradually. In addition, a swell system appears at the
northeast, due to the coexistence of NW wind at the region
and northerly wind at the northern part of the coast (Ràfols
et al., 2017b). The main difference between the uncS and cRS
runs is that the spectra obtained with the cRS run present less
energy at the peak than those obtained with the uncS run. An
energy increase at higher frequencies (i.e., at the spectrum
tail) can also be observed when the currents are considered,
but overall the uncS run presents more energy. A less ener-
getic spectrum means shorter Hs values, which is consistent
with the values obtained from the numerical results.

In Figs. 5 and 6, it is observed that, during the wind-jet
event, the wave field responds directly to the wind. In Fig. 6,
the 2-D Hs maps show a clear increase of the wave height
at the wind-jet axis that, at the wind-jet peak, reaches values
up to 2.43 m. The time series presented in Figs. 4 and 5 show
that the Hs diminishes when the water currents are consid-
ered and that the major differences (∼ 15–20 cm) occur dur-
ing the wind-jet peak. Similar results are shown in Fig. 7,
where the mean differences show that the Hs from the cRS
run tend to be shorter than the Hs from the uncS run and
that the major differences are observed during the wind-jet
events. Under such conditions, the mean differences in shal-
low regions reach values of 15 cm, while the mean difference

at the wind-jet axis is around 6 cm. Comparing the results
from the cRS and the uncS runs, it is found that coupling the
models produces a mean effect of 11 % in the Hs parameter
at the CB location and a mean effect of 4 % at DB location.

In order to analyze the Hs differences obtained with the
two runs, Fig. 11 shows the differences in Hs at P2, distin-
guishing the differences in the wave and current propagation
directions. It is found that the Hs from the cRS run tends to
be shorter (stronger) than the Hs from the uncS run when
the difference between the propagation direction of waves
and currents is shorter (stronger). This is to say that consid-
ering the coupling effects results in a decrease (increase) of
Hs when the waves and the currents propagate in the same
(opposite) direction. In general, the Hs differences between
the runs are small (1Hs < 5 cm). However, during the NW
wind jets, these differences increase up to 10–14 cm and, in
the case of the E3 event, reach 20 cm. The mean differences
observed at this point correspond to 10 % of Hs.

The Tm02 obtained with the cRS tends to be longer than
the one obtained with the uncS excepting the wind-jet event
periods, where the Tm02 from the coupled run is shorter (see
Fig. 4). This is consistent with the frequency increase in the
cRS run detected in the spectra analysis during the wind-jet
E3 event. Figure 12 shows the Tm02 and Dir time series
obtained with the uncS and the cRS runs compared to the
CB-measured data. Note that the CB location is not affected
by the wind jet. Qualitatively, the cRS run shows a clear im-
provement in the agreement of the Tm02 results with the mea-
surements, which is consistent with the statistical parameters
collected in Tables 1 and 2. Comparing the results from the
cRS and the uncS runs, it is found that coupling the models
produces an average effect of 48 % in the Tm02 parameter
at the CB location. This effect is reduced to 27 % at the DB
location.

Regarding the mean wave direction, no relevant differ-
ences are observed between the uncS and cRS runs in deep
water (not shown). However, similarly to the results pre-
sented in Table 2, Fig. 12b shows that at the CB location
(i.e., in shallow waters) the mean wave direction is improved
during the wind-jet events. Analyzing the mean wave direc-

tion differences between the uncS and cRS runs, it is found
that relevant differences occur near the coastline.

4 Discussion

4.1 Effects of coupling on the current field

The main differences between the uncR and cRS runs have
been detected in the water column structure. The vertical
mixing of the water column is stronger when the waves are
considered. This behavior can be explained by the TKE in-
jection and the use of a wave-dependent sea surface stress

in the cRS run. Similar results have been observed in pre-
vious work. Rong et al. (2014) studied the WCI over the
Texas–Louisiana shelf and found that the wave effects can re-
distribute the freshwater both vertically and horizontally and
thus affect the stratification. Bruneau and Toumi (2016) also
found that the mixed-layer depths were enhanced in presence
of waves. Niu and Xia (2017) investigated how the Lake Erie
dynamics were impacted by the wave-induced surface stress
and found that it produced an enhancement of the surface
mixing and a weakening of the stratification strength. It is
important to note that, although the results presented in this
study are consistent, there are no available measurements to

verify them. Thus, it can not be stated if the cRS run is more
adjusted to the reality or if it is “overmixing”.

The results presented above show that including the wave
effects does not produce a relevant difference to the water
current velocity during a wind-jet event and has a weak im-
pact on the water circulation patterns. Similar results were
presented by Bruneau and Toumi (2016), who analyzed the
wave-induced processes in the Caspian Sea and found that
they have a weak impact on the dynamics of the region. The
momentum balance analysis has shown that the WF term is
one of the leading terms in very shallow areas (until ∼ 50 m
water depth). For this reason, using a numerical domain at a
more coastal scale with water depths up to 50 m would prob-
ably show more effects at the current field, rather than the do-
main used in this work, which is focused on the inner shelf,
where the water depth reaches values greater than 100 m. It is
important to keep in mind that the water depth in the coastal
regions of our study area is very shallow and the numeri-
cal domain used in this study has very few computational
points in these areas and is not able to properly solve its dy-
namics. As a matter of fact, Osuna and Wolf (2005) studied
the WCI in the Irish Sea and found that the effect of waves
on currents is evident in the eastern coastal areas (which are
very shallow), with daily mean current differences larger than
10 cm s−1 during strong wave events.

4.2 Effects of coupling on the wave field

The numerical results presented an improvement in the Tm02
parameter when the coupling effects were considered (see
Fig. 12a). Consequently, the inclusion of the current velocity
in the estimation of wave period is not negligible, and it must
be considered if high-quality modeling is required (similar to
Bolaños et al., 2014). It should be noted that the results show
that the coupling effects on the wave field are stronger for the
Tm02 parameter than for theHs parameter. For instance, Os-
una and Monbaliu (2004) found that the effect of coupling is
1 order of magnitude stronger for the Tm02 parameter (about
20 %) than in the case of Hs (about 3 %).

During a wind-jet event, a decrease of the Hs is found
when the currents are taken into account. The decrease (in-
crease) of Hs in the presence of an opposite (following) cur-
rent is a well-known effect that has been investigated be-
fore by several authors (e.g., Benetazzo et al., 2013; Du-
tour Sikirić et al., 2013; Viitak et al., 2016). For example,
Benetazzo et al. (2013) studied the WCI at the semi-enclosed
Gulf of Venice and found that during Bora conditions, with
the currents propagating in the same direction as waves, the
comparison between coupled and uncoupled models showed
a reduction ofHs on the order of 0.6 m when the waves were
considered.

measured by CB (black). Note that the first 24 h of the model results have been rejected.

The differences in mean wave direction found in shal-
low waters could be due to the current-induced refraction
(Wolf and Prandle, 1999; Olabarrieta et al., 2011). However,
it is important to note that these differences were found very
close to the coastline, specifically until 2 km offshore. Since
the model mesh resolution is 350 m, there are very few grid
points, and thus it is not possible to extract a concise conclu-
sion about this phenomenon with the results obtained in this
study. A study at more coastal scales would be necessary to
discern such processes.

Finally, considering the currents causes wave spectral re-
shaping. During a cross-shelf wind-jet event, the presence of
currents induces a shoaling-like process. In general, a reduc-
tion of the energy peak and a slight increase of the energy at
the tail of the spectrum are observed. This is consistent with
the results presented in Fan et al. (2009), where the authors
found that when the wave–current interactions were consid-
ered, the peak of the frequency spectrum was reduced and
shifted toward higher frequency. Rusu (2010) also found that
the presence of currents leads to a redistribution of the wave
energy over the spectrum.

5 Conclusions and future works

The wave–current interactions have been investigated us-
ing numerical models. Three different runs have been per-
formed: an uncoupled ROMS run, an uncoupled SWAN run
and a two-way coupled run. The comparison among these
runs shows that at the continental shelf the surface water cur-
rent presents similar results in the coupled and the uncoupled
configurations, and the momentum balance analysis reveals
that the non-conservative WF term plays an important role
in shallow waters. The results show that coupling the mod-
els results in a major mixing of the water column (the SML
increase), mainly due to the TKE injection and the enhanced
surface stress. Additionally, wave spectral reshaping occurs,
the Tm02 improves and the wave energy (and thus the Hs)
diminishes (increases) when the water currents and waves
propagate in the same (opposite) direction. The results also
indicate that more processes occur in shallower waters, e.g.,
current-induced refraction, but a more coastal domain with a
finer grid is necessary to evaluate them.

Overall, the numerical results are physically reasonable, as
they reproduce the well known coupling effects. The results
have enabled the WCIs to be investigated but more measure-
ments would be needed in order to perform a more quanti-
tative analysis. Thus, in the future, it would be interesting to
perform some measurement campaigns to enable more ac-

curate model validation and more exhaustive analysis of the
dynamics of the region. In addition, it would be interesting
to investigate the role of the sea surface roughness coupling
the ROMS and SWAN models with the WRF model.

Appendix A: The logarithmic wind profile

The logarithmic wind profile used to extrapolate the modeled
wind from 10 to 3 m is as follows:

Uz =
U∗

κ
ln
(
z

z0

)
, (A1)

where Uz is the mean horizontal wind velocity at a given
height z, U∗ is the frictional velocity, κ is the von Kár-
mán constant (' 0.4), and z0 is the aerodynamic roughness
length.

The roughness length is estimated by means of the
Charnock relation:

z0 =
αCHU

∗2

g
, (A2)

where g is the gravitational constant and αCH is the Charnock
parameter (in this study, it has been considered an αCH equal
to 0.011). Notice that this surface roughness formula does not
necessarily coincide with the formula used in the numerical
model to compute the surface stresses.

The friction velocity is related to the known wind speed at
10 m elevation (U10) with

U
∗2
= CDU

where CD is the drag coefficient from Wu (1982):
