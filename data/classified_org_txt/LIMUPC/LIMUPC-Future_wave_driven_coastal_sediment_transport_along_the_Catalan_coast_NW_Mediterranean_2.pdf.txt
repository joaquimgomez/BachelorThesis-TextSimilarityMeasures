This is the supplementary material of the manuscript “Inter-model variabil-
ity in regional climate change projections in terms of wave-driven coastal sedi-
ment transport” by M. Casas-Prat, K.L. McInnes, M.A. Hemer and J.P. Sierra.
It covers detailed aspects of the study area that are relevant for the long-shore
and cross-shore sediment transport processes. First, Appendix A summarises
the climate changes in terms of wave parameters. Then, Appendix B follows
with a brief description of the geomorphological characteristics of the Catalan
coast.

Appendix A. Wave projections

Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013) generated a set of wave projections driven by 10-
m wind fields derived from 5 configurations of regional and global circulation
models (RCMs and GCMs, see Table SM1) forced by the A1B greenhouse gas
scenario (IPCC, 2007). This appendix summarises their main results as the
basis to understand the sediment transport projections presented in the main
manuscript of this study.

Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013))

RCA H SMHI RCA3 HadCM3Q3

In the winter season (December-January-February), the median of the signif-
icant wave height (Hs) tends to decrease up to 10% on average (see Figure SM1)
which is related to a similar reduction of the forcing wind speed. This is a com-
mon feature for all models, although magnitudes vary among them. Regarding
wave direction changes, there are two clear distinct responses associated to the
two driving GCMs: ECHAM5 and HadCM3Q3 (see Figure SM2), which can be
explained by the combined effect of the discrepancies already present in the W-
E atmospheric flow generation corresponding to each GCM and the favourable
fetch conditions of certain wave directions. ECHAM5-driven future wave pro-
jections have a greater frequency of the S-SW and N-NW components whereas
for the HadCM3Q3-driven simulation, the occurrence of the NE-E-SE compo-
nent tends to increase, which for the Catalan are the directions associated with a
larger fetch. The later response translates into a general increase of the presence
of mixed sea states (more swell influence) and a slight increase of the median of
Tp (peak period) in the southern part of the coast even though the median of Hs
tends to decrease there. For the other RCM-GCM configurations, the pattern
of change of the median of Tp largely follows that of the median of Hs but,
in general, the maximum rate of change is ±5% (instead of ±10%) following
the proportionality Tp ∝ (Hs)0.5 as expected for fully-developed (predominant)
wind sea states.

Such differences in climate change responses may have different implications

for the coastal dynamics. For example, the net LST results from the balance
of the contribution of all waves from all possible effective directions. Along the
Catalan coast, owing to the main coastal orientation, E waves normally generate
a north-to-south LST whereas the opposite occurs for S waves. A change in the
frequency of those waves could affect the LST magnitude and even change its
net direction.

For the 50-year return period of Hs (z50), inter-model regional variability
notably increases and significant differences are also found between projections
corresponding to different RCMs (see Figure SM1). The range of change is in
general ±20%, higher than for the median Hs. This can be explained by the
non-linear relation between wind speed and wave height for wind sea states,
which are more frequent during stormy conditions. Despite not being statisti-
cally significant, RCA H results predict important relative rises of z50 along the
Catalan coast, due to the increase of the E component. This could lead to an
increase of the beach erosion that occurs due to the storm’s induced CST. In
contrast, a general notable reduction is found for REM E whereas RAC E and
RCA E project a rise for the mid-northern Catalan coast.

In summer (June-July-August), inter-global-model variability is reduced,
being of the same order as inter-regional-model variability. Also, patterns of
change are completely different for summer, which is reasonable due to the dif-
ferent atmospheric processes involved (e.g. thermal effects gain importance).
The median Hs tends to remain the same or decrease along the Catalan coast
(but to a lesser extent than for winter). In the north(middle-south) of the Cata-
lan coast, a rise of frequency of NE(E) waves is projected, which seems to be
associated to an increase of z50 (not shown).

Appendix B. Geomorphological aspects

Figure SM3 illustrates the spatial distribution of the median of the sediment
grain size (d50), the mean beach slope (tanβ) and the mean beach orientation
(γ), corresponding to about 300 beaches (obtained from CIIRC (2010)). γ is
measured clockwise from north to the shoreline and pointing offshore.

The northern part of the Catalan coast (north of 42° approx) mostly con-
sists of short pocket beaches nestled between cliffs with the exception of two
large bays (Roses and Pals). The rest of the coast has a majority of low-lying
beaches (with the exception of deltas and occasional abrupt cliffs and pocket
beaches). North of Barcelona (41.4° N, 2.2° E), the beaches are generally nar-
row, with relatively high slopes and gravel or coarse sand originating in the
coastal mountains. In contrast, in the southern part, sediment comes from the
pre-coastal depression, resulting in very fine sand and soft slopes. This can
be clearly appreciated in the spatial distribution of d50 and tanβ, as shown in
Figure SM3.

The largest Catalan delta (Ebre delta) is located on the extreme south of
the Catalan coast (40.7° N, 0.8° E). This area of high ecological value covers
about 32,000 ha, with half of that area lying at an altitude of less than 0.5 m
(Alvarado-Aguilar, 2009) and it is currently suffering from beach retreat. CIIRC
(2010) quantified a mean beach retreat of more than 5 m/year between 1995
and 2004. This value, however, is not only the contribution of the wave climate
but also the delta subsidence and the reduction in the sediment river discharge.

Also, there is a large presence of coastal and port infrastructure along the
Catalan coast with, for example, a total of 47 harbours. They affect (nearby)
beach dynamics because they can interfere on the sediment transport processes.
Indeed, the narrowness of many Catalan beaches can be partly explained by
harbours acting as a barrier of the (upstream) longshore sediment transport.
