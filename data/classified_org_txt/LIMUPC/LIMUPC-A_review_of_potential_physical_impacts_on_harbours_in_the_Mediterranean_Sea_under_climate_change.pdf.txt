Abstract 

 

The potential impact of climate change on port operations and infrastructures has 

received much less attention than the corresponding impact for beach systems. However, 

ports have always been vulnerable to weather extremes and climate change could 

enhance such occurrences at timescales comparable to the design lifetime of harbour 

engineering structures. The analysis in this paper starts with the main climatic variables 

affecting harbour engineering and exploitation. It continues with a review of the available 

projections for such variables first at global scale and then at a regional scale (Catalan 

coast in the western Mediterranean) as a study case for similar environments in the 

planet. The detailed assessment of impacts starts from downscaled projections for mean 

sea level and wave storms (wind not considered in the paper). This is followed by an 

analysis of the port operations and infrastructure performance that are relevant from a 

climate perspective. The key climatic factors here considered are relative sea level, wave 

storm features (height, period, direction and duration) and their combined effect, which is 

expected to produce the highest impacts. The paper ends with a discussion and some 

examples of analyses aiming at port adaptation to future climate change.

Introduction 

 

Climate change impacts have been considered for vulnerable systems, including coastal areas 

(Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2011; Nicholls et al. 2011). Port activities, however, have received less 

attention in such impact analysis (Sierra et al. 2016), although harbour exploitation is clearly 

conditioned by climatic variables such as wind (e.g. for crane operations), waves (e.g. for 

agitation inside port domains), currents (e.g. for manoeuvrability or spills) or mean level (e.g. for 

overtopping and flooding). Port infrastructures have often been designed for present climate, 

including storm events with centennial return periods (Becker et al. 2012), which are likely to be 

affected by climate change. Port suitability under future climates (multi-decadal scale) has either 

not been assessed or only partially evaluated as part of the port development plans.  

 

Future changes of average conditions and extremes will require modifying port infrastructures, if 

present operations are to be maintained or even expanded. The increase in mean sea level and 

extreme water levels (Lionello et al. 2015) or changes in wave climate (mean or extreme) will 

condition essential aspects of harbour operations and infrastructure. This will affect harbours in 

a complex manner, modifying risk levels, economic productivity and even the harbour 

environmental impact. This represents one of the main climatic risks in coastal zones, since 

ports contribute a significant percentage of economic productivity in the coastal fringe and 

further inland associated with transport and economic  connectivity. 

 

This paper reviews the potential impacts of climate change on ports. First, the followed 

methodology is described (“Methods” section). After this, the main climatic variables affecting 

port operation and engineering (“Climatic variables of reference” section) are analysed, 

presenting selected climatic projections at global scale, in terms of mean sea level and storm 

features (“Large-scale projections for marine variables” section). The need for downscaling 

meteo-oceanographic conditions to regional scales, such as required by harbour decision 

making, is considered (“Downscaled projections for the Mediterranean case” section) based on 

a challenging case such as the Catalan coast (western Mediterranean Sea), where large human 

pressures and sharp topo-bathymetric gradients pose special difficulties for accurate local 

predictions. The paper continues with an assessment of climate change impacts on harbour 

exploitation and safety (“Impacts on harbour exploitation and engineering” section), considering 

functional and resistant aspects of infrastructures and how that conditions harbour operation, 

maintenance and even future development. The paper ends with some conclusions 

(“Conclusions” section).  

 

Methods 

 

This paper is based on the reviewing of previous works that have studied some of the factors 

relevant for the impact of sea level rise and wave storms on coastal areas and how these 



4 
 

factors may affect harbours. Based on the gathering of the sectorized knowledge generated in 

these previous works, all the issues related to the potential impact of climate change on ports 

are put together and presented in this paper.  

 

The processes analysed are those that most affect port engineering and exploitation. As 

illustration, in a study carried out by the regional government of Catalonia (DPTOP 2007) 

reviewing the state and main problems of the 47 Catalan ports, the following processes were 

considered those of more concern for port engineers because they generate problems in port 

safety and exploitation: siltation, overtopping, agitation and breakwater stability. Therefore, this 

paper examines how changes in climate variables may increase (or decrease) the magnitude of 

such problems, to facilitate anticipatory decisions in the face of future climate. 

 

Most of the information and data used are from previous studies carried out by the authors, 

although the figures shown here are original. Specific information can be found in the following 

publications:

González-Marco et al. (2008), Sánchez-Arcilla et al. (2008a, b).

Sierra (2012), Sierra and Casas-Prat (2014) and Casas-Prat et al. (2016).

et al. (2015).

- Impacts of changes in wave storms on ports: Sierra (2015) and Sierra et al. (2015). 

- Impacts of SLR on ports: Sierra et al. (2016). 

 

Although this study focuses on the ports of the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean) whose 

location is shown in Fig. 1, the analysed problems may affect ports worldwide and the obtained 

conclusions should be of application to other areas. 

 

Climatic variables of reference 

 

This study analyses the climate of the main marine variables affecting the design, construction, 

exploitation and maintenance of harbours, leaving out more conventional climate variables such 

as temperature and wind. The considered variables are (a) mean sea level (MSL) and (b) storm 

features (peak wind speed, significant wave height, directions and associated surges).  



5 
 

 

Mean sea level is one of the most integrative hydrodynamic climatic variables and one of the 

more commonly used. Port impact assessment requires reliable downscaled values since global 

estimates are too coarse (Scarascia and Lionello 2013) to justify harbour decisions with 

extensive economic implications. It also requires an accurate consideration of all relevant terms, 

including surges (positive or negative) and regional steric effects on mean sea level. In semi-

enclosed seas, like the Mediterranean, regional air–sea interaction features and morphological 

factors may distort future mean sea level (Marcos and Tsimplis 2008) with respect to the 

neighbouring oceans (i.e. the Atlantic Ocean). Moreover, the complex topography of these 

restricted domains produce irregular meteorological fields (Fig. 2) which, for the Mediterranean 

case, reflect the convergence of Atlantic, European and African atmospheric patterns and, 

although linked to larger-scale climatology, generate local variability at regional scales.  

 

Port exploitation will also be affected by storm duration, intensity and direction. For instance 

along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, harbour entrances are oriented towards the south (from 

SW to SE) since these sectors are characterized under present climatic conditions (Lionello and 

Sanna 2005) by waves milder than those from the east to north quadrant, where fetches are 

longer and waves higher (Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2008a). Potential changes in atmospheric 

circulation patterns such as the northward shifts of storm tracks in Europe could favour the 

development of an anticyclonic pattern over the Iberian Peninsula which would result in more 

southern storm waves in the Spanish Mediterranean coast, associated with the clockwise 

meteorological sense of rotation. In addition, the relative decrease in low-pressure centre 

frequency will enhance the importance of see breeze, blowing also from the south. Both effects 

could induce more frequent southern storm waves, which have a more direct incidence on the 

port mouths in that area.  

 

Harbour-scale storm features, however, require downscaling which for semi-enclosed seas like 

the Mediterranean entail uncertainties introduced by the gradients in topo-bathymetry illustrated 

by changes in shelf width, submarine canyons or the time evolution of the shallower part of the 

bathymetry. This will result in variations in the wave/current fields that affect harbour operation 

and safety. Such effects should include, for a robust assessment, the main variables related to 

the impact, including wave height/period and mean sea level (Sierra and Casas-Prat 2014). 

 

Waves are a natural “integrator” of the more variable local wind parameters and because of that 

wave height is often considered as preferred variable for integrated assessments of climate 

change effects. This, however, may result in additional uncertainties since waves can also 

aggregate and thus even compensate various meteorological errors, leading to erroneous 

conclusions. The usual approach, based on present engineering practice, starts by downscaling 

projections for the wave height, from which the wave period (T) and direction (Ɵ) are selected 



6 
 

from a joint probability distribution function or a correlation diagram. Such an approach, 

excluding an actual projection of the T or Ɵ variables, inherently assumes that wave features 
(e.g. the H-T correlation) will not change with respect to present conditions (see, for example, 

Fig. 3, obtained from the XIOM Catalan network of meteo-oceanographic instrumentation). This 

hypothesis is controversial, in particular in the case of large oceans, where Hemer et al. (2013) 

found that the relationship between H and T is modified due to changes in swell waves. In semi-

enclosed seas, due to the control of limited fetch, this swell effect becomes less important and 

the relationship between variables barely changes as shown by Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013). 

The projected changes can show opposite trends depending on regional features. For instance, 

in the case of Spain, there is a projected wave height increase in the North Atlantic (affecting 

the northern and western coasts of this country), while there does not appear to be such trend 

for the Mediterranean Spanish coast (Young et al. 2011; Casas-Prat and Sierra 2013). Such 

variability, compounded by the incertitude in projections and impact mechanisms, explain the 

reluctance of Harbour Authorities to act in advance with decisions that are costly (e.g. 

breakwater costs are in the range of 107 euros) and present non-negligible uncertainty. 

 

 

Large-scale projections for marine variables 

 

Projections of relative sea level rise 

 

With climate change, temperatures are expected to increase, following the upper limit of past 

projections (Friedlingstein et al. 2014), and leading to a rise in global and regional mean sea 

levels. Determining projections of sea level rise is challenging, particularly at regional scales, as 

many components contribute to sea level rise and their interactions are complex (Brown et al. 

2013; Church et al. 2013; Adloff et al. 2015). These components include: 

 

(a) changes in ocean volume (thermosteric or halosteric) and dynamics;  

(b) melt water from glaciers and ice caps; 

(c) melt water from the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica;  

(d) land water storage in reservoirs. 

 

In addition to these factors, subsidence has to be considered to assess the resulting relative 

sea level rise. 

 

Thermosteric changes to ocean volume are slow to emerge from increases in global mean 

surface temperature, so there is a time lag (lasting decades to centuries) before their full effects 

will be observed, known as the commitment to sea level rise (Wigley and Raper 1993). The ice 

melt contribution may be larger than previous projections, and the effect of groundwater 



7 
 

pumping and land water storage, although considered minor, is receiving increased attention 

(Church et al. 2013). Subsidence varies with latitude (land levels even rising with respect to sea 

levels due to isostatic rebounds) and with local geology. In the Mediterranean coasts, 

subsidence, as in many other coastal areas, becomes important for deltaic or river mouth areas. 

For the studied coast of Spain, this would have implications mainly for the Ebro delta and 

secondarily for the Llobregat delta, affecting two harbours (one at each area).  

 

Twenty-first  century sea level rise projections from Church et al. (2013) are based on 21 

climate models, combined with other data and resulting in a range of projections due to 

scientific/model uncertainties. These include the range of possible emission scenarios called 

Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and project a likely range of global mean sea 

level rise between 0.26 and 0.82 m (or up to 0.98 m) by 2081–2100, both with respect to the 

1986–2005 interval. Thermosteric change represents 30-55 % of this rise, with glaciers 

contributing 15-35 % (Church et al. 2013). Due to the commitment to sea level rise, large 

differences between scenarios are not seen until after mid-century. Higher rises are considered 

possible (up to 2m per century), although with a lower probability (Nicholls et al. 2014). 

 

Large-scale meteo-oceanographic processes also affect variability, for example, in storm surges 

or temperature-related seasonal variations so marked in the Mediterranean (e.g. Jorda et al. 

2012). Negative mean sea levels (negative surges, Conte and Lionello 2013) should also be 

considered in this area since they can change under future climatic conditions and affect 

harbour operations by for instance by hindering the access of larger ships.  

 

 

Projections of storm tracks 

 

The general trend in the Mediterranean (Lionello et al. 2008) shows a relative decrease in wave 

energy projections that, however, combined with the expected increase in mean sea level rise 

can still generate higher waves within harbours due to the effects of shoaling and diffraction. 

 

Climate change may modify cyclonic activity or alter cyclonic paths in areas of sharp 

temperature differences. Nevertheless, projections (IPCC 2013) do not achieve high confidence 

on long-term trends of cyclonic activity, though some models project a likely regional (tropical) 

increase in their intensity. There are indications that the total number of mid-latitude storms will 

decrease and a medium confidence that the storm track will shift pole-ward particularly in the 

southern hemisphere. However, in spite of the deep uncertainties at regional scales (in 

predicting positions or intensities), the case of semi-enclosed seas will continue, leading  to 

local intense low-pressure centres generation (Romero and Emanuel 2013) due to the land–

water–air differences in temperature.  



8 
 

 

Even with less low–pressure centres, any increase in their strength combined with a higher 

MSL will produce more frequent extreme water levels (Conte and Lionello 2013). As an 

illustration, CHRR et al. (2005) analysed the greatest hazardous areas from a coastal 

perspective, which is where cyclones tend to make landfall. They found the greatest hazards 

occurring in central and north-east America, south-east Africa (Madagascar) and east and 

south-east Asia. These places are likely to experience increased extreme water levels over the 

coming decades, even if climate change starts to be mitigated (commitment to sea level rise). 

This imposes serious adaptation needs for port infrastructures and large population centres in 

many rapidly growing Asian locations. 

 

Downscaled projections for the Mediterranean case 

 

Reduction in port vulnerability to climate change requires decisions based on local (hard to 

achieve) or at least regional projections. Because of the scarcity of regional projections, many 

decision makers still rely on information obtained from global models with low spatial–temporal 

resolution (Becker et al. 2013).  

 

Engineers and planners demand better regional sea level and wave climate projections, which 

can be modelled and downscaled from global circulation models (GCM) directly (e.g. Wang and 

Swail 2006) or using atmospheric climate projections from regional circulation models (RCMs), 

obtained through downscaling of GCMs as done, for example, in Conte and Lionello (2013). 

Nevertheless, the ultimate wave projections at a regional scale suffer from a cascade of 

uncertainties: in climate and greenhouse gas scenarios, in atmospheric–ocean (circulation) 

modelling and in wave modelling. 

 

To properly assess local to regional climate change, it is necessary to consider several GCM–

RCM realizations to cover as much of the uncertainty range as possible, with recent literature 

recommending ensembles of more than 20 elements (Déqué and Somot 2010) and excluding 

outliers until there is enough evidence or knowledge to explain that “unexpected” behaviour 

(Donat et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is far from clear which model is the “best” because model 

skill usually depends on analysed output variables and season, and a better simulation of the 

observed climate does not prove which climate response is more reliable (Déqué and Somot 

2010). 

 

These limitations of present analyses become more acute for restricted sea domains where 

boundary conditions and sharp gradients may easily degrade the quality of projections. This can 

be illustrated by the case of the Mediterranean Sea wind and wave fields, where regionalised 

projections based on IPCC AR5 scenarios (IPCC 2013) and CMIP5 results are currently under 



9 
 

way (see, for example, Fig. 2). Most existing projections, however, are based on CMIP3 models 

(IPCC 2007), with a limited number of scenarios, as illustrated in Lionello et al. (2008), where 

the Mediterranean wave field was obtained with one combination of GCM–RCM and two SRES 

scenarios, one pessimistic (A2) and one optimistic (B2), with resolution of 50 km and 6 h. It was 

found that the mean significant wave height (Hs) over a large fraction of the Mediterranean Sea 

is lower for the A2 scenario than for the present climate during all seasons except in summer for 

two areas, those between Greece and North Africa and between Spain and Algeria, where Hs 

becomes significantly higher. These changes are similar, though smaller and less significant, in 

the B2 scenario, except during winter in the north-western Mediterranean, where the B2 mean 

Hs field is higher than in the present situation. Extreme Hs values are found to be smaller in 

both future scenarios except in the central Mediterranean during summer for the A2 scenario. 

 

Alternative analyses (Casas-Prat and Sierra 2013) have projected future regional wave climate 

for the NW Mediterranean for the A1B scenario using 5 combinations of GCM and RCM at 

higher spatial (25 km) and time (3 h) resolutions. It was found a general decrease in the median 

Hs in most of the domain. However, at high latitudes near the Gulf of Genoa, there is a local rise 

of the median Hs. Summer waves show marked differences compared to winter, with a median 

Hs rising in the south part of the domain. These results are consistent with those of Lionello et 

al. (2008) for scenario B2. In general and for both studied seasons, maximum projected Hs 

changes are around ±10 % for mean conditions (median Hs) versus ±20 % for extreme climate. 

Results also show changes in the seasonal distribution of directional frequencies, with 

implications for harbour and coastal engineering. 

 

Mediterranean mean sea level rise (Tsimplis et al. 2008; Adloff et al. 2015) has been projected 

(twenty-first century) using an Atmosphere-Ocean Regional Climate Models coupled over the 

Mediterranean basin and forced by river run-off and influxes from the Atlantic Ocean and the 

Black Sea. Changes in temperature and salinity under the A2 emission scenario were used to 

compute steric sea level changes in the region, which showed significant spatial variability with 

a maximum steric sea level rise of 25 cm by 2100. The mean is around 13 cm with lower values 

in the eastern Mediterranean and higher values at the western Mediterranean (Tsimplis et al. 

2008). Further, it is clear that even at basin scale the contribution of mass addition ultimately 

caused by melting of ice caps remains the main source of uncertainty (Scarascia and Lionello 

2013). 

 

The downscaled projection of storm surges should be added to the steric variations and even 

the changes in set-up due to wind generated waves, as shown in Fig. 4 using a seven member 

model ensemble of regional climate simulations under the A1B scenario. These results compare 

two 30-year periods: 1971–2000 (reference interval) and 2021–2050 (future interval). The 

maximum water level “indicator” is defined as the 5-year return period maximum water level that 



10 
 

can be reached under a storm, combining storm surges, wave effects and steric sea level 

variations. The figure shows the per cent variations of the indicator calculated as the difference 

between the two periods normalized with the reference period. Positive and negative values 

(panel a) indicate statistically significant increases and decreases in mean water level. The 

other three panels (b–d) show the same results but now considering an increase in sea level 

due to mass addition into the Mediterranean basin. These mass additions amount to 15, 30 and 

45 cm representing the effect of melting ice caps and mountain glaciers. For the Adriatic basin 

and southern Mediterranean coast, there is a limited decrease, while there is an increase along 

the Greek coast, southern Sicily and the north-western Spanish Mediterranean coast, analysed 

as case study in this paper. It is also apparent how the contribution of mass by melting ice 

dominates over the other terms. 

 

The regional projections of mean sea level also reflect the uncertainties in future dynamical 

oceanography (circulation) and the vertical (local) motion of land levels:  isostatic uplift (e.g. in 

the Baltic coast) or subsidence (e.g. in deltaic sedimentary deposits, such as Mediterranean or 

south-east Asia deltas) (Peltier 2004; Ericson et al. 2006). Dynamic oceanography associated 

with episodic events may introduce several centimetres (up to more than 5 cm in the 

Mediterranean) of mean sea level variation (Adloff et al. 2015) although there is no predicted 

seasonal bias in the obtained sea level rise, indicating that the seasonal cycles will remain 

unaffected. The resulting relative (sea referred to land) levels also reflect more local 

anthropogenic impacts that can add a few millimetres to centimetres per year (Nicholls et al. 

2014). This combination of factors must be considered for the assessment of harbour 

operability, where also the local settling of heavy infrastructure (e.g. breakwaters) may play a 

role in areas with soft soils. 

 

 

Impacts on harbour exploitation and engineering 

 

Impacts of sea level rise 

 

In spite of uncertainty for MSL projections and, particularly its upper end this century (e.g. 

Rahmstorf 2007; Church et al. 2013), there have been many assessments for coastal areas 

(e.g. Nicholls and Cazenave 2010; Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2011). Most of these studies have 

focused on beach impacts such as flooding or erosion, and only few of them have addressed 

climate change effects on seaports and their operations (Sierra et al. 2016). 

 

The main direct impacts of MSL on ports come from overtopping and flooding through the effect 

of storm events for an increased mean sea level. In addition, sea level rise will change water 

depths and, as a consequence, it will indirectly modify wave propagation patterns, potentially 



11 
 

affecting breakwater stability and scouring, harbour siltation and agitation. One of the earliest 

impacts will be that of flooding and overtopping for which there are a number of predictive 

formulations depending on breakwater cross section (Pullen et al. 2007). Using the more suited 

empirical methods for Mediterranean harbours, the impact of sea level rise has been analysed 

for 43 ports along the Catalan coast (NE Spain, Fig. 5). The analysis uses three scenarios 

besides the present situation (scenario 0). Average and high-end projections for MSL have 

been derived from RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in IPCC AR5 (Church et al. 2013), plus a plausible 

although unlikely global rise of 1.8–2.0 m as representative of high-end conditions (Jevrejeva et 

al. 2009). These values correspond to the upper tail of the probabilistic distribution for the mean 

sea level value (1.8 m corresponds to the 95 % quantile associated with RCP 8.5 projections by 

2100). These values could also become more likely in the event of accelerated ice sheet 

dynamics and rapid rate of ice melt from Greenland and Antarctica. For the RCP 4.5 scenario, 

representing a middle range domain for impact assessments, the central value of MSL rise by 

2100 is 0.53 m, while for the RCP 8.5 scenario, representing a more unfavourable domain for 

impact assessments, the upper bound of MSL rise by 2100 is 0.98 m. Both SLR values 

represent the increase by 2100 with respect to 1986–2005. Moreover, AR5 projections (Church 

et al. 2013) indicate that sea level rise in the Mediterranean may be slightly lower than the 

global average or show a certain time lag. 

 

Based on these considerations and assuming a Mediterranean MSL rise 10 % lower than the 

global average and considering that there are no MSL variations along the studied area due to 

its limited extension, the scenarios considered here for the year 2100 are: 

 

� Scenario 0: Base conditions (present situation, reference period 1986–2005)  

� Scenario 1: RCP 4.5 (Base conditions + 0.47 m) 

� Scenario 2: RCP 8.5 (Base conditions + 0.88 m) 

� Scenario 3: High-end scenario (Base conditions + 1.80 m) 

 

To assess overtopping risks (in terms of vulnerability since we shall not deal explicitly with the 

hazards or probabilities of occurrence) under different sea level rise scenarios, it is essential to 

define “acceptable” discharges (volumetric flux rates over the structure) for each port 

considered. Acceptable discharges depend on the activities carried out behind the structure; for 

instance for isolated breakwaters, without flood sensitive assets and no moored ships in the lee 

side, the allowable discharge is larger than for breakwaters with docks or berthed boats 

(Burchart and Hughes 2003). Defining tolerable discharges based on the values suggested in 

Pullen et al. (2007) and considering wave storm return periods of 1, 5 and 50 years 

(representing mean weather conditions, relatively strong storms and exceptional storms), it is 

possible to analyse vulnerability to overtopping, in this case for the studied ports along the 



12 
 

Catalan coast. The wave height distribution under storms has been obtained from 4 wave buoys 

deployed along this coast.  

 

Five vulnerability classes (very low, low, medium, high or very high) have been defined as a 

function of discharge exceedances following Sierra et al. (2016) and representing common risk 

levels in harbour operation. These five classes are the ones commonly employed for present 

engineering calculations (Pullen et al. 2007), and they are shown in risk maps (Fig. 5), 

corresponding to storm conditions with return period of 5 years and for MSL according to the 

four sea level rise scenarios considered. Even a moderate increase in MSL affects vulnerability 

(in level and number of ports affected), and, from here, any acceleration of sea level rise will 

increase port risk levels in the Mediterranean and worldwide. 

 

Another potential consequence of sea level rise in ports comes from decreased clearance under 

bridges, causing disturbances to navigation particularly for ports located in rivers and estuaries 

in micro-tidal areas, where there is not the flexibility associated with high tidal ranges. MSL 

variations can also affect port operations, including berthing and cargo loading/unloading, due 

to the reduction in dock freeboards. They can also flood docks and infrastructures (railways, 

roads), affecting and potentially interrupting port accesses and operations. This can be 

illustrated by the port land areas established in deltas or other low-lying coastal tracts, such as 

is the case of Barcelona harbour. On the contrary, although sea level rise could change siltation 

rates (increasing or decreasing the amount of sediment deposited in the port), it will entail a 

positive impact due to the increase in the available port draft with the associated benefits for 

navigation. 

 

Finally, sea level rise entails changes in water depth and therefore in the bathymetry for the port 

and surrounding areas. This will modify wave propagation patterns, generating changes in 

processes like shoaling, refraction and diffraction and giving rise to different nearshore wave 

fields. Although shoaling and refraction may have opposite (and, thus, compensating effects) on 

wave height, the increase in water depth could result in waves breaking closer to the coast and 

therefore higher maximum heights. This can affect breakwater stability and scouring, siltation 

and agitation, in a way that is difficult to assess because directional changes will be specific for 

each individual case. In some instances, wave heights can increase (reducing breakwater 

stability, enhancing scouring, siltation and agitation) and in others can decrease, with opposite 

and positive impacts. Changes in wave direction can also enhance/reduce agitation and 

siltation, requiring the specifics of each case for a meaningful assessment. Table 1 summarizes 

the potential impacts associated with sea level rise and their sign (worsening or improvement of 

port conditions). 

 

 

 



13 
 

Impacts of future wave storms 

 

The effect of sea level rise via enhanced wave impacts may be compounded by changes in 

storm features as reported in the literature (e.g. Weisse and von Storch 2010; Sánchez-Arcilla 

et al. 2011). Climatic changes in ocean waves are detectable in terms of intensity and duration 

(e.g. Hemer et al. 2013) although with a large uncertainty associated with wave storm 

projections (Church et al. 2013). These changes may generate impacts on coastal erosion (e.g. 

Casas-Prat et al. 2016), harbour structures (Sierra and Casas-Prat 2014) and harbour agitation 

(Casas-Prat and Sierra 2012; Sierra et al. 2015).  

 

Ports under climate change will have to minimize inactivity and decreases in operational 

performance caused by adverse (or different with respect to present design conditions) climate 

factors such as wind and wave patterns near or inside the harbour. Changes in wave conditions 

can affect harbour wave agitation (short wave oscillations without including long waves) 

depending on storm parameters (height, period and direction) and on harbour geometry (plan 

shape, bathymetry and reflectivity of structures). As a result, variability in harbour agitation 

patterns under climate change will be specific for each port.  

 

Wave fields inside harbour domains cannot be calculated with compact formulations, and the 

use of detailed numerical models, requiring a large amount of case specific information, is 

required. This can be illustrated by the projected harbour agitation inside 13 harbours in the 

Catalan coast (see Sierra et al. 2015 for more details). The analysis was based on a model for 

wave propagation (Boussinesq type) which is able to reproduce reflection, diffraction and long 

waves inside the harbour. Such model is forced by propagated offshore wave projections that 

were obtained by using 5 combinations of RCM–GCMs and the A1B scenario from AR4 since 

the corresponding multi-model downscaled projections from AR5 were not yet available. A 

sample illustration of this analysis appears in Fig. 6, showing the projected yearly average wave 

field (present and future) inside one of the studied harbours (L’Ametlla de Mar) located at the 

southern sector of the Catalan coast. This figure also shows the changes between future and 

present conditions, where a slight increase in yearly wave intensity is observed in most of the 

port layout. For several other ports, the general trend was decreasing agitation but with a large 

uncertainty. 

 

Adapting to climate change starts from an assessment of present conditions and is followed by 

a sequential set of interventions. By way of illustration, Fig. 7 shows how to reduce harbour 

agitation due to a change in wave direction (as projected to happen in the NW Mediterranean) 

by modifying the port layout. The analysed port (Marina de Palamós) is located on the northern 

Catalan coast, and the simplest solutions would be the extension of the main breakwater or the 

construction of a new secondary breakwater (Sierra 2015), both of them reducing (as 



14 
 

schematized in the figure) wave agitation (height) inside the harbour. Based on this and other 

analyses, we expect seasonal and regional variations in the projected changes in harbour wave 

conditions due to port geometry and storm features. For the NW Mediterranean, there is a 

decreasing agitation trend in winter and an increase during the summer season. These results 

are relevant for management and engineering since the increase in agitation in summer will 

coincide with a higher port occupancy (around 97 %) in most of the facilities (marinas), 

hindering the use of boats as living quarters and their manoeuvrability (Sierra et al. 2015). 

 

When subject to climate change, many existing ports will be faced with increasing risk levels 

due to functional or structural failure or impairment unless physical, economical, institutional or 

legislative adaptation occurs. The situation will aggravate for existing ports, not conveniently 

maintained or upgraded since the actual risk level will also be larger than that calculated at the 

project time, even in the absence of climate change (due, for example, to breakwater section 

weakening or scouring).  

 

The more commonly suggested lines of intervention (Becker et al. 2013) are based on updating 

infrastructures, increasing their crest level (without any additional upgrading) or relocating 

(activities, terminals or even the complete harbour). Hard solutions (based on concrete or 

stones) will require a continuous updating at decadal scales since the rate of sea level rise will 

keep on growing worldwide and with an acceleration near the end of the selected projection 

horizon (by 2100). Soft solutions will also demand maintenance (e.g. dredging or artificial 

nourishment for morphodynamic impact mitigation) but with a different sequence in time, 

depending on the type of measure and the rate of impact. 

 

Changes in storminess may also affect port environmental management and impacts. The 

barrier effect of ports on sediment transport results in erosion (requiring impact mitigation) 

and/or siltation (requiring dredging). Both entail expensive mitigation and maintenance 

depending on the amount of projected climate change at local (regional) scale and harbour and 

coastal geometry. Impact assessment includes a variety of processes and scales under present 

conditions (see, for example, Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2008b), and becomes more uncertain for 

future scenarios where it is also required to project the expected sediment availability. 

Assuming an unlimited supply of sediment, previous studies have shown (e.g. Sierra and 

Casas-Prat 2014) that siltation is particularly sensitive to changes in wave height followed by 

changes in wave direction. For regions where no major changes in wave height are expected, 

the barrier effect will be mainly associated with modified wave propagation directions. 

 

Scouring by removal of granular bed material at the seaward toe of maritime structures is 

another process that can be affected by storminess. The resulting erosion will depend on the 

wave height and period in front of the structure, the breakwater slope and depth at the slope 



15 
 

toe. Greater structural slopes at shallower depths will experience larger scouring resulting in 

partial damage or, in some cases, complete failure of a structure (Burchart and Hughes 2003). 

 

Changes in storminess may also affect structural stability. In the case of rubble mound 

breakwaters, the design is based on the calculation of the main armour unit weight, which is 

proportional to the cube of the significant wave height at the structure toe. This means that 

small increases in wave height (due to larger water depths in front or to increases in wave 

energy) will generate a nonlinear augment in the necessary weight of breakwater units. In the 

case of vertical structures, any increase in wave height will produce greater stresses on the 

breakwater, decreasing its safety coefficients for sliding and overturning. Table 1 also includes 

the potential impacts associated with changes in wave height or direction and their sign 

(worsening or improvement of port conditions). 

 

Impacts of other climatic factors  

 

Besides sea level rise and wave climate, there are several additional climatic (physical) factors 

that can have an impact on port engineering and exploitation. Any climate modification of wind 

velocities and directions may affect structural safety and functionality (via enhanced 

overtopping) and many port operations (e.g. loading/unloading, ship berthing or crane 

operations) that can only be performed under certain thresholds. The expected increase in 

temperatures will also affect in a regionally different manner MSL and the occurrence of 

impulsive storm development (Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2008b). Larger storm surges and set-up will 

result in higher MSL (González-Marco et al. 2008) in front of the structures, affecting their 

performance.  

 

Impulsive storms, such as medicanes (Romero and Emanuel 2013) in the Mediterranean, will 

result in higher than usual MSL occurring (according to available projections) with a lower level 

of yearly average wave energy. Such explosive cyclo-genesis leads to extreme precipitation 

that could cause localized flooding and changes in sedimentation patterns that will increase 

dredging requirements (Becker et al. 2012). These heavy rains can also interrupt land transport 

and, as a consequence, disturb cargo arrival to or evacuation from the port. Finally, extreme 

rains may increase river discharges, jeopardizing the facilities of many ports located in 

estuaries, that could be flooded and, thus, more vulnerable to other climatic factors. This may 

imply a different management strategy for ports and in general for any assets in the coastal 

zone, balancing the advantages and disadvantages of a management based on average trends 

versus a management considering risk levels and, thus, extremes (Hinkel et al. 2015). 

 

All these elements will affect ports worldwide in a complex pattern that will favour certain 

connecting routes and hamper some of the present flow lines. Coastal typology, tidal range and 

the presence of ice illustrate the wide range of regional variability to be expected. For instance, 



16 
 

the decreasing volume of ice in the Arctic may allow free passage from the Pacific to the 

Atlantic and affect the relative weight of certain ports in world trade. This, together with the 

already described effects of climate change on harbour exploitation, may force revisiting 

harbour infrastructure and operation criteria worldwide. 

 

Conclusions 

 

Climate change effects on coastal zones have been considered extensively, but the impact on 

sea ports has received comparatively much less attention, though it is the economic activity of 

harbours that often justifies the presence of coastal cities and the corresponding local beach 

demand. This is due to the concentration of population near coastal cities and the projected 

growth of coastal inhabitants that is expected to exceed that of other areas in the planet. 

 

The main marine climatic (physical) variables for projecting impacts are mean sea level, storm 

surges and wave storminess. Mean sea level is the addition of a number of contributors that 

have global (e.g. increases in temperature) or regional/local (e.g. subsidence) scopes. It is also 

affected by dynamic ocean processes such as circulation or wave fields in the area. Wave 

features are the main “pressure” for the resistant/functional performance of port structures since 

they condition port operations and safety levels. 

 

Introducing climatic projections in port engineering and management requires at least regional 

analyses, since it is otherwise difficult to justify costly infrastructure decisions based on global 

values with unspecified information at local scales. The difficulty for downscaling gets worse for 

semi-enclosed seas, like the Mediterranean, with sharp gradients and tough to quantify 

boundary conditions. This case has been selected for illustrating the analysis of climate change 

impacts, covering functional/resistant/environmental aspects. Their efficient mitigation requires 

a structured set of interventions that should be made up of a combination of hard and soft 

solutions, so that the port evolution with climate change can become sustainable, avoiding 

short-term decisions that may limit longer-term solutions under future scenarios. 

 

This paper has shown the main potential impacts on ports associated with climate change. 

Considering climate projections of physical variables, these impacts can be assessed leading to 

engineering applications that are important for future management of ports and their 

infrastructure. This has been illustrated by the assessment of overtopping risks and discharges 

for a set of Mediterranean ports, computation of wave agitation inside harbours under various 

climate scenarios, indication of specific measures for mitigating the effects of likely changes of 

wave directions and overall impact assessment including multiple processes and scales. Such 

an approach requires starting from robust downscaled climatic projections and proposing 

efficient combinations of interventions that are suitable and remain “attractive” also under future 

conditions (e.g. in a future with limited energy available). Such a combined consideration of 



17 
 

short to long timescales should allow a more realistic assessment of impacts and facilitate the 

introduction of climate projections into port operations and decisions.

Fig 5 Overtopping risk (ratio to present level) for harbours along the Catalan coast in the NW Mediterranean (see inset) showing the cases 
where vulnerability increases in a statistically significant manner (low increases in green, medium in yellow, high in blue and very high in 

red). The assessment has been done for the 4 scenarios described in the text: upper panel corresponds to present conditions, intermediate 
panels to RCP 4.5 and 8.5 and lower panel to a high-end scenario of 1.80m sea level rise. For additional information, see Sierra et al. 

(2016).



Fig 6 Annual average significant wave height Hs (m) in the l’Atmella de Mar port (on the southern sector of the Catalan coast) for 
an ensemble of five combinations of GCM–RCM models. The set of 5 models employed corresponds to A1B scenario. The figure 

shows significant wave height inside and around the harbour, for present conditions (left panel) and future conditions (central 
panel), as well as the percentage of variation of future with respect to present (right panel). For additional information, see Sierra 

et al. (2015).

Fig 7 Significant wave height (Hs) inside the Marina of Palamós on the northern sector of the Catalan coast for projected waves (2100) 
from SSW for three different layouts: present geometry (left) and two solutions for adaptation to climate change, leading to a significant 
reduction in Hs. One corresponds to an extension of the main breakwater (centre) and the other to the construction of a new secondary 

breakwater (right). For additional information, see Sierra (2015).
