Abstract. In this contribution we investigate the hydrody-
namic response in Alfacs Bay (Ebro Delta, NW Mediter-
ranean Sea) to different anthropogenic modifications in
freshwater flows and inner bay–open sea connections. The
fresh water coming from rice field irrigation contains nutri-
ents and pesticides and therefore affects in multiple ways the
productivity and water quality of the bay. The application
of a nested oceanographic circulation modelling suite within
the bay provides objective information to solve water qual-
ity problems that are becoming more acute due to tempera-
ture and phytoplankton concentration peaks during the sum-
mer period when seawater may exceed 28 ◦C, leading to high
rates of mussel mortality and therefore a significant impact
on the local economy. The effects of different management
“solutions” (like a connection channel between the inner bay
and open sea) are hydrodynamically modelled in order to di-
minish residence times (e-flushing time) and water temper-
atures. The modelling system, based on the Regional Ocean
Modeling System (ROMS), consists of a set of nested do-
mains using data from CMEMS-IBI for the initial and open
boundary conditions (coarser domain). One full year (2014)
of simulation is used to validate the results, showing low
errors with sea surface temperature (SST) and good agree-
ment with surface currents. Finally, a set of twin numeri-
cal experiments during the summer period (when the water
temperature reaches 28 ◦C) is used to analyse the effects of
proposed nature-based interventions. Although these actions
modify water temperature in the water column, the decrease
in SST is not enough to avoid high temperatures during some

days and prevent eventual mussel mortality during summer in
the shallowest regions. However, the proposed management
actions reveal their effectiveness in diminishing water resi-
dence times along the entire bay, thus preventing the inner
areas from having poor water renewal and the corresponding
ecological problems.

1 Introduction

Coastal lagoons are highly productive areas, for instance
regarding aquaculture, and are subject to multiple anthro-
pogenic pressures. Due to the specific characteristics of these
environments – e.g. small dimensions, calm inner waters,
constrained exchange with open sea, heavy load of nutrients
– there is usually a wide variety of problems related to wa-
ter quality that can strongly limit their use and exploitation
(e.g. HABs, anoxia–hypoxia events, water renovation or high
seawater temperatures; Smith, 2003).

This problem is illustrated by the Ebro Delta coastal bays
(NW Mediterranean) in which, for most of the year, there is
an interaction between incoming saltwater from the coastal
sea and fresh water discharged into the bays through the irri-
gation system from the surrounding rice fields. These dis-
charges are rich in nutrients and pesticides (Köck et al.,
2010), therefore affecting in multiple ways the productiv-
ity and water quality of the bays (Loureiro et al., 2009), in
which residence times can be large depending on the prevail-
ing met-ocean conditions (Artigas et al., 2014).

These bays (Alfacs in the south and Fangar in the north
hemidelta) constitute the most important shellfish aquacul-
ture area on the Spanish Mediterranean coast. They are con-
sidered very productive coastal areas compared to the olig-
otrophic western Mediterranean Sea; the primary production
per volume unit is 1 order of magnitude greater than in the
adjacent open sea (Delgado, 1989) and their waters support
important fisheries and mussel and oyster cultures. More-
over, the economy of the area is largely based on activities
that depend on primary production, such as agriculture, fish-
eries and aquaculture. The shellfish aquaculture in the re-
gion has to face different types of risks: shellfish pathogens
(López-Joven et al., 2015), extreme warm events in the last
years (Fernández-Tejedor et al., 2010), contamination (Köck
et al., 2010), HABs and toxin accumulation (Loureiro et al.,
2009), and the proliferation of invasive alien species, for ex-
ample tunicates (Ordóñez et al., 2015). Water mass transport
in marine systems has been demonstrated to be a decisive fac-
tor controlling the behaviour of chemical and biological vari-
ables of the ecosystem (Wolanski, 2007). In this sense, the
evolution of the ecological status of the bays is highly related
to water renewal and substance dispersion. Wind- or wave-
induced resuspension processes may also affect the ecolog-
ical status by inducing the vertical transport of substances
from the sea bottom to the inner water column (Umgiesser et
al., 2004).

The application of a nested oceanographic model with
enough resolution to solve the inner dynamics of this kind of
environment provides objective information to address wa-
ter quality problems. These are becoming more relevant in
the Ebro Delta bays due to increasing peaks of temperature
and nutrient concentrations during the summer when seawa-
ter may exceed 28 ◦C, leading to high rates of shellfish mor-
tality and therefore having a significant impact on the local
economy.

In this contribution, focused on Alfacs Bay, we explore
the suitability of land boundary conditions and the control-
ling effect of different management actions on the resulting
3-D circulation patterns based on renewal times. In this con-
text, we also discuss the implications of opening a connec-
tion between the open sea and the inner bay, dredging the
sandbar, and how it affects water temperature and concentra-
tions. This has been a long-standing proposal by local fisher-
men to enhance water renovation rates and improve the water
quality within the bay. A set of 3-D numerical model simula-
tions spanning 1 year (2014), with outer boundary conditions
from Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service
(CMEMS) models, is compared to intensive field campaigns
and discussed in terms of water renovation and temperature.
The implications of a hydraulic connection to the outer sea
is analysed as a natural and sustainable type of intervention.
From here, a set of conclusions on the models’ performance
and on the effectiveness of such sustainable intervention are
presented.

2 Methods

2.1 Study area

Alfacs Bay is part of the Ebro Delta, which extends about
25 km offshore and forms two semi-enclosed bays on its lat-
eral margins, Alfacs to the south and Fangar to the north.
Both bays receive direct freshwater input from the drainage
channels of nearby rice fields. In Alfacs Bay, these freshwater
inputs are distributed in two dominant periods: from April to
December with mean flows estimated by Llebot et al. (2011)
of around 10 m3 s−1 and from January to March with chan-
nels closed and flows around 1 m3 s−1 (hereinafter referred to
as wet and dry periods, respectively) due to rain and ground-
water sources. Alfacs Bay is about 16 km long and 4 km
wide, with a 2.5 km wide mouth, an average depth of about
4 m, and a maximum of 6.5 m in the middle of the bay. Fig-
ure 1 presents the location and bathymetry of the bay. The
bay is closed in the east by a sandbar beach called Trabucador
bar. This coastal barrier linking the main lobe of the Ebro
Delta with its southern spit has suffered various breaching
events associated with storms, opening an ephemeral connec-
tion between the bay and the open sea (Sánchez-Arcilla and
Jiménez, 1994; Gracia et al., 2013). The bed is mostly muddy
(largest percentages in the middle of the bay) with silty sedi-
ments present close to the freshwater outflows (Palacín et al.,
1991).

The bay has been defined as a salt-wedge estuary with
an almost year-round stable stratification, alternated with
well-mixed periods directly related to strong wind (Camp
and Delgado, 1987) or seiche events (Cerralbo et al., 2015).
Solé et al. (2009) found that drainage discharges were the
main factor controlling the observed stratification. Cerralbo
et al. (2015) found that during warm periods the salinity
distribution shows strong vertical gradients, coinciding with
isopycnals, with the saltiest water (almost 38) from the outer
sea in the deepest mouth layers and the freshest water (35–
36) at the surface. Stratification is weaker in the inner bay,
with lower salinity values in the water column. Within the
bay, fresh water at the surface layer extends from the north-
west to the southeast with a pycnocline at 3–4 m of depth
(Camp, 1994; Llebot et al., 2011). The water temperatures
during summer show a clear diurnal pattern, with a clear
stratification. This pattern occurred until the end of summer,
when strong, dry and cold winds from the NW mix and cool
the water column (Cerralbo et al., 2015; Grifoll et al., 2016).
In Llebot et al. (2011), annual cycle (and inter-annual) anal-
yses of temperature, salinity and some ecological indicators
are described. Moreover, Llebot et al. (2014) use the Wed-
derburn number to identify wind events with enough energy
to modify stratification, defining the mixed layer deepening
response to wind events. Cerralbo et al. (2014) studied the
tidal characteristics of the bay, noting the importance of the
3 h seiches and describing the 1 h seiches (corresponding to
the first seiching mode). The subtidal patterns have been re-

lated to estuarine circulation (Llebot et al., 2014) and wind
influence through empirical orthogonal function (EOF) anal-
ysis (Cerralbo et al., 2019). On the other hand, several eco-
logical studies noted the presence of harmful algal blooms
(HABs) in some periods and their relation to nutrients and
waters from the open sea (Loureiro et al., 2009). Ramón et
al. (2007) and Fernández-Tejedor et al. (2010) have reported
mussel mortalities associated with high seawater temperature
in the Ebro Delta bays.

2.2 Observations

Weekly conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) profiles
were conducted in the framework of the monitoring pro-
gramme for toxic phytoplankton in shellfish growing areas
during the years 2013–2014. The location of one sampling
station is shown in Fig. 1 (T ). The water temperature in dif-
ferent locations (and representing different kinds of water-
bodies) of the region is summarized in Fig. 2. The water tem-
peratures inside the bay (T ) and in the drainage channels are
very similar (low gradients between them). The lowest tem-

peratures (∼ 10 ◦C) occur during the winter season (Decem-
ber to March). After this, a gradual rise in water tempera-
ture is observed, with maximum values around 29 ◦C during
summer (June to August). Finally, the water temperature de-
creases, affected by the influence of NW strong, dry and cold
winds. On the other hand, the water temperature from the
river does show remarkable differences (mainly during sum-
mer), with gradients around 2–3 ◦C (similar to the coastal
waters measured at the Tarragona coastal buoy) compared to
inner-bay waters. All the observations are summarized in Ta-
ble 1.

2.3 Numerical model

The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model used in this
study is the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).
Numerical aspects are described in detail in Shchepetkin
and McWilliams (2005), and a complete description of the
model, with documentation and code, is available at the

ber 2018). Previous implementation for the model in Alfacs

River (Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro).

Bay showed a good skill assessment compared to currents,
sea level and water temperature variables (Cerralbo et al.,
2016).

The model applications consist of two nested regular grids
with spatial resolutions of ∼ 350 and ∼ 70 m for the coarser
(D-A) and finer domains (D-B), respectively (Fig. 1). The
nesting ratio (∼ 5) between the two domains is defined to
get enough resolution to reproduce the circulation in the in-
ner bay, allowing for the transfer of large-scale dynamics
into the nested domain. The nesting is offline; a first D-A
simulation is performed and the hourly results are used for
the boundary conditions of D-B. The chosen vertical dis-
cretization consists of 20 and 15σ levels for the coastal and
bay domains, respectively. Bathymetries of the coastal sys-

tem are built by combining bathymetric data from GEBCO
(https://www.gebco.net/, last access: 2 December 2018) and
specific local high-resolution sources. The bottom bound-
ary layer is parameterized with a logarithmic profile using a
characteristic bottom roughness height of 0.002 m. A surface
stretching parameter (7.0) and bottom stretching parameter
(0.4) for the Song and Haidvogel (1994) stretching function
is used. This configuration allows for an increase in the reso-
lution in the upper layer where the surface boundary layer is
located due to the wind action. The transformation function
used is described in Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005) de-
noted as an unperturbed coordinate system. In order to rep-
resent the processes at scales smaller than the grid resolu-
tion we selected anisotropic horizontal and vertical turbulent
schemes based on a generic length scale (GLS) formulation
(Warner et al., 2005). K-ε parameters are chosen for GLS
formulation. Also, the Kantha and Clayson stability func-
tion formulation is used (Kantha and Clayson, 1994). For
the advection scheme a third-order upstream horizontal flux
is selected. For heat and mass tracers, a biharmonic mixing
scheme along geopotential surfaces is used.

A 1-year-long base simulation (hereafter referred to as BS,
from 1 January to 31 December 2014) has been performed in
order to validate the model and obtain the initial and bound-
ary conditions for the 3-month simulations in the analysis pe-
riod (summer 2014) in the smaller domain. The BS is done
using the first 24 h of the CMEMS-IBI (Sotillo et al., 2015)
daily forecasts for the initial and open boundary conditions.
Hourly depth-averaged water currents and sea level are pro-
vided by CMEMS-IBI and consistently accommodated to
the open boundaries (OBC) with Chapman and Flather al-
gorithms (Carter and Merrifield, 2007). The variability of
currents along the water column (3-D component), temper-
ature and salinity are imposed from CMEMS-IBI daily aver-
age values with clamped conditions.

At the sea surface, the models are driven by high-
frequency (hourly) wind components (with 0.05◦ resolution),
atmospheric pressure, humidity, precipitation and solar ra-
diation derived from the Spanish Meteorological Agency
(AEMET) forecast (model HARMONIE). The wind stress
and sensible and latent heat are computed internally by the
model using aerodynamic bulk formulas. To avoid land con-
tamination of the atmospheric forcing on coastal areas (e.g.
heat fluxes and winds), a prior land mask is applied to the

forcing data, and then variables over the sea are interpo-
lated on the land. The freshwater flows are 1 m3 s−1 dur-
ing January–March (dry season) and 10 m3 s−1 during April–
December (wet season) distributed in the three channels (see
Fig. 1c). Salinity is set to 18, and water temperature is defined
from climatological water temperature in the Ebro River
(Fig. 2).

For the sake of understanding the influence of land dis-
charges and layout modifications on the water dynamics, a
set of 3-month-long numerical experiments is done (1 June–
30 September). In all of them, a passive tracer with a
1 kg m−3 concentration is initially released at all the compu-
tational nodes inside the bay. The BS simulation is restarted
on 1 June with the passive tracers and is used as a control
simulation (called C) to compare all the numerical tests. A
second set of three tests has been prepared to understand the
effects of establishing an artificial connection with the open
sea through the Trabucador bar (see Fig. 1). This is an engi-
neering action proposed in the last years by the local author-
ities to consolidate the ephemeral connection between the
bay and the open sea that occurs occasionally due to storm-
related bar breaching. The purpose of a permanent open sea
connection is to solve the problems of the bay linked to long
residence times and overheating, and similar solutions have
been studied in other coastal lagoons with water quality is-
sues (Netto et al., 2012; Lill et al., 2012). These simulations
consist of opening the bar using different widths, from 200
to 800 m, and studying the effects on water renewal and sea
surface temperature. Finally, two more numerical tests are
performed in which the freshwater input flows were modi-
fied. Considering that the gravitational circulation in the bay
has been previously related to the hydrodynamics of the bay
(Cerralbo et al., 2019), it is expected to find variability in the
water renewal times when the freshwater flows are modified.
These numerical tests are designed to understand their effects
on current patterns. In test R1 the usual flow (10 m3 s−1 in C)
is doubled, keeping the proportion in the three channels. In
test R2, the total discharged flow is doubled, but the flow
increment is only applied to the innermost channel, while
the outflow through the drainage channels closest to the bay
mouth is kept the same as in C. Thus, the R1 test doubles
the freshwater input along the three channels, and R2 only
modifies the innermost channel. All the numerical tests are
summarized in Table 2.

2.4 Validation

Data from CMEMS-IBI, atmospheric models and field ob-
servations (high-frequency radar (HF-R) from Puertos del
Estado, PdE), as well as sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea
surface temperature (SST) data from the Institute of Agricul-
ture and Food Research and Technology (IRTA), were avail-
able for the year 2014. The modelled and observed SSTs are
shown in Fig. 3. A qualitative and quantitative comparison
shows good agreement between the two variables (correla-

tion of 0.99), with a small overheating in the modelled re-
sults (see statistics in Fig. 3). The errors in modelled SSS are
mainly related to the uncertainty associated with the flows
and the exact location of the discharge points. However, the
results of the coastal model (D-A), which considers the inner-
bay freshwater flows, show a closer agreement with the ob-
served values than the CMEMS-IBI results, which do not
account for the inner discharges. The variability of SSS in
the CMEMS-IBI fields is related to the Ebro River plume,
not to the influence of inner-bay freshwater inflows. Water
surface currents are validated for the coastal model (D-A)
considering the information from HF-R in the area (Lorente
et al., 2016). The HF-R (CODAR SeaSonde standard range)
was deployed at the Ebro Delta in 2013 within the frame-
work of the RIADE (Redes de Indicadores Ambientales del
Delta del Ebro) project. The network consists of three remote
shore-based sites providing hourly radial measurements with
a cut-off filter of 100 cm s−1 and representative of current ve-
locities in the upper first metre of the water column (Lorente
et al., 2015). The total current vectors are hourly averaged
on a predefined Cartesian regular grid with 3× 3 km hori-
zontal resolution. The parent model (CMEMS-IBI) has been
validated in the region using HF-R in Sotillo et al. (2015).
Their results shows zonal and meridional root mean square
error (correlation) values in the range of 6–10 cm s−1 (0.4–
0.8) over central areas of the HF-R radar domain, with higher
errors detected at the far edges of the radar spatial cover-
age (Sotillo et al., 2015). For D-A domain both eastward and
northward components of the surface currents are shown in
Fig. 3a and b (at point HF, location shown in Fig. 1). Valida-
tion is performed for all of 2014 in one point close to the bay
and with optimal temporal coverage (more than 85 % of 2014
with data). The gaps in the HF-R data are not considered. The
agreement and correlation between modelled and observed
currents are very high (∼ 0.7), both in intensity and phase
and in both components. The daily oscillations correspond to
the inertial period in the region (∼ 19 h) and are well repro-
duced by the model. Some currents intensifications, probably
related to energetic wind events, are also well described by
the model (for instance on 10 February and 16 March).

2.5 Water residence times

There are a multitude of different methods and concepts to
calculate water renovation in the literature. For any given do-
main, the simplest way to assess water renovation is to ob-
tain the water exchange time through the ratio between its
total volume (V ) and the daily flux (Q) entering or leaving
through its open boundaries. It represents the time required
for the entire mass of water to be replaced by input water
(Takeoka, 1984; Jouon et al., 2006). On the other hand, the
e-flushing time (Thomann and Mueller, 1987) assumes that
a passive tracer is injected into a homogenous water mass at
time t with an initial concentration C0. The e-flushing time
is the time required for the tracer mass initially contained
within the whole domain to decrease by a 1/e factor. A fair
adaptation to this parameter, the local e-flushing time, is pre-
sented in Jouon et al. (2006) by considering the spatial vari-
ability of the e-flushing time and taking into account the evo-
lution of the tracer in each cell of the computational mesh.

The integral water exchange time in Alfacs Bay can be
grossly estimated using simple approaches. A first approx-
imation can be done by considering the residual circulation
presented in Cerralbo et al. (2018); through an analysis of the
mean circulation the authors obtain residual velocities at the
bay mouth. Using the mean residual currents and the bay’s
volume and typical cross section at the mouth leads to wa-
ter exchange times (θ ) of around 20 and 70 days for the wet

and the dry season, respectively. Similar results can be also
obtained using a box model approximation (Officer, 1980)
based on the salinity variations between the bay water and
the open sea with four layers: seaside surface and bottom
(salinity of 36.35 and 37.82, respectively) and inner-bay sur-
face and bottom layers (with salinities of 35.7 and 36.94).
The box model is described by Eqs. (1–4).

S2 · (Q21+E12)= S1 · (Q13+E12) (1)
S0 ·Q02+ S1 ·E12 = S1 · (Q21+E12) (2)
Q+Q21 =Q13 (3)
Q02 =Q21 (4)

Q is the total freshwater input, Si is the salinity in layer i, and
Qij and Eij are the advective and turbulent fluxes between
layers i and j . In this model, Q is set to 10 m3 s−1, and the
salinities are given by the mean values obtained in the field
campaigns described in Sect. 2.2. Solving the system with
these values yields residence times of ∼ 13 and ∼ 40 days
for the wet and the dry season, respectively. However, these
methods are not useful when large variations in hydrodynam-
ics occur (Jouon et al., 2006). In this sense, previous studies
on the Alfacs Bay hydrodynamics have highlighted the rel-
evance of hydrodynamic spatial variability associated with
seiches (Cerralbo et al., 2014), winds (Llebot et al., 2014;
Cerralbo et al., 2016) and gravitational circulation (Artigas
et al., 2014).

An approximation to the spatial variability of the residence
times is addressed for the first time in this work by analysing
the space distribution of the local flushing time (LFT) for
the entire waterbody. The methodology applied is based on
the numerical deployment of an Eulerian conservative tracer,
within the inner domain of the bay, to compute the time re-
quired for its concentration in each grid cell to decrease by
a factor e− 1 from the initial value. This definition repre-
sents the sum of the flushing lag and local e-flushing time in
Jouon et al. (2006). Thus, an Eulerian passive and conserva-
tive tracer with a concentration equal to Co = 1 kg m−3 was
deployed in the different sigma layers of the inner bay. Con-
sidering that the pycnocline is around 3–4 m of depth (Camp,
1994) and mussel farms are mostly above this depth, the anal-
ysis focuses on the surface layers. The freshwater inflows are
considered clean of the tracer. An example of the time evolu-
tion of the surface tracer concentration at two points is shown
in Fig. 4a. The LFT is defined at each grid cell based on the
concentration decrease between Co and Co ∗ e− 1 using the
best-correlated exponential regression (Jouon et al., 2006).

3 Results

The results for LFT in the C simulation reveal a high spa-
tial variability (Fig. 4b), with short values between 5 and
20 days in the region close to the bay mouth and near the
freshwater discharges. These are similar to those presented
in Camp (1994) and Llebot et al. (2011). On the other hand,
longer times are found in the inner regions (30–47 days).
When the total flushing time (TFT) is considered (TFT being
equal to the period necessary for the average concentration
of the entire bay to go from Co to Co ∗e−1), values of about
28 days for C are found.

As mentioned before, the hydrodynamics of Alfacs Bay
are particularly affected by freshwater inputs. Both R1 and
R2 reveal (not shown) maximum LFT values of 34 and
29 days, respectively (shorter than C, with 47 days). The
anomaly – in days – of these patterns in relation to the distri-
butions obtained for C is shown in Fig. 5a and b. R1 shows
shorter residence times than the C test in the innermost part

of the bay. The clearest effects of the freshwater increment
are observed in the area closest to the drainage points (with
LFT under 10 days). However, the inner areas still present
residence times longer than 30 days. The R2 results also
show remarkable differences compared to the control case,
with shorter times in the area close to the inner channel and
values around 20 days in the innermost region. In both tests,
the area of mussel farms shows similar differences, with LFT
values almost 10 days shorter in the results obtained with
modified freshwater flows. In Table 3 the TFT for the entire
bay is summarized for all the cases. It is interesting to note
that the TFT for test C is around 28 days, similar to the val-
ues obtained through the simple relation between the mean
residual circulation and the volume of the bay. Tests R1 and
R2 show a noticeable decrease in the average e-flushing time,
with reductions of ∼ 8 and ∼ 11 days, respectively.

Figure 5. Differences (in days) for the water e-flushing times be-
tween each test case and the control simulation (C). Negative (pos-
itive) indicates shorter (longer) local e-flushing times for the corre-
sponding test compared with C.

Regarding SST (Fig. 6), the differences are evident, but
not significant. In general, there is a cooling of the surface
water over the entire bay of about 0.5 ◦C, being more evi-
dent in the vicinities of the drainage points. However, in the
region near the Trabucador bar, the surface waters show an
increase in temperature. This area is very shallow and proba-
bly the effects of higher stratification (induced by the highest
freshwater inputs) and longer residence times in this region
contribute to increasing the SST. Considering the integrated
SST values for the entire bay, the R1 and R2 tests show a
decrease of 0.07 and 0.08 ◦C in relation to the control test.

To evaluate the effect of bar breaching, a set of three nu-
merical tests (B1, B2 and B3) with different widths of sand-
bar breaching (200, 500 and 800 m, respectively) has been
implemented. In all the cases, the depth of the channel is
equal to the minimum depth considered in the model (1 m).
Figure 1 shows the region of the sandbar modified for these
simulations.

The results are summarized in Figs. 5 and 6. Test B1
(200 m) shows shorter LFT mostly in the region close to the
sandbar. However, no remarkable differences are observed in
the mussel farm region (differences of about 5 days with re-
spect to C). Tests B2 and B3 (500 and 800 m) reveal a higher
variation in the residence times than B1, but with similar spa-
tial variability patterns. In general, a wider connection with
the open sea implies a larger area with lower LFT in the
vicinities of the sandbar and inner region. Moreover, the ef-
fects are also observed in the region of the mussel farms,
with a decrease in the residence time to less than 10 days.
The TFT for the entire bay and the differences relative to the
C test are summarized in Table 3. There is clearly a direct
relationship between the width of the channel and the resi-

dence times, with those for B3 (widest channel) being almost
14 days shorter than those for the control case C.

The analysis of SST differences shows no relevant discrep-
ancies with the C case in most of the bay. Only the region
closest to the open channel in the bar shows a decrease in the
inner-bay SST (due to mixing with the cooler open seawater,
as observed in Fig. 2) and also an increase in SST in the open
seaside of the bar. The integrated values over the bay do not
show significant variations between the tests and the control
case, with differences smaller than 0.07 ◦C.

4 Discussion

Previous studies had applied numerical models in Alfacs Bay
(Llebot et al., 2014; Artigas et al., 2014; Cerralbo et al.,
2014, 2015, 2016), trying to characterize the main hydro-
dynamic features of the bay: wind, sea level, seiches, mix-
ing and gravitational circulation. However, none of them ad-
dresses one of the most relevant problems inside the bay re-
lated to low water renovation and warm water temperatures
during summer periods. For this, a high-resolution numerical
model able to simulate interventions and impacts has been
implemented for the first time in the bay using the available
data from CMEMS numerical models (as initial and bound-
ary conditions) and following the nesting scheme designed in
the SAMOA initiative (Sotillo et al., 2019). The validation of
such an implementation with the available data in the coarser
domain has been done through comparison with HF-R water
surface currents, revealing very good performance and agree-

ment. The validation of the higher-resolution domain – local
– has been performed using SST and SSS from in situ field
campaigns, revealing a good agreement between observed
and modelled data for the SST. Errors in salinity could be
related to the lack of accurate data for freshwater flows (total
volume, spatial and temporal distribution) and the salinity of
these waters (fresh water from rice fields mixed with brackish
waters from the coastal lagoon). The model presented in this
paper could be also considered as the first attempt towards
the implementation of an operational system in the bay as a
local downscaling of CMEMS products, which could be used
by local authorities to improve the management of the bay.
However, this study has revealed the scarcity of information
about the bay, which may influence the robustness of mod-
elling results. Lacking data include, for instance, accurate in-
formation on bathymetry, which is expected to improve with
new products derived from Sentinel-2, and the correct char-
acterization of the freshwater flows (i.e. number and spatial
distribution of sources, water flows, and temperature).

As stated by several authors (i.e. Braunschweig et al.,
2003; Jouon et al., 2006; Dabrowski et al., 2012; Grifoll et
al., 2013) there are various ways to obtain the residence time
of a given waterbody. In this contribution, we have followed
different approximations, from a simplistic scheme using the
observed residual velocities or the application of a box model
that uses the salinities and freshwater flows to obtain the
gravitational circulation, to the most complete scheme using
the depletion of Eulerian conservative tracers in a numerical
model (LFT and TFT). The analysis has focused on surface
layers (above the pycnocline at 3–4 m) where the water col-
umn is entirely mixed. The water exchange times reveal val-
ues of 13 and 40 days for wet and dry periods, respectively,
using the box model, similar to those obtained using resid-
ual currents (20 and 70 days). These results are in agreement
with previous studies (Camp and Delgado, 1987; Llebot et
al., 2011) presenting residence times for the Alfacs Bay be-
tween 10 (wet period) and 25 days (dry period). The differ-
ences between these results and previous studies may be due
to the arbitrary selection of the bay mouth section, sensitivity
to salinity and freshwater flows used in the box model, and
the location of the current meters. In this sense, the variabil-
ity of the flow through the mouth section has been demon-
strated to be high in Cerralbo et al. (2016). However, simple
methods consider all water particles to have the same transit
time through the entire control volume (Takeoka, 1984). In
Alfacs Bay, several authors (Llebot et al., 2011; Cerralbo et
al., 2014, 2015, 2016) have observed remarkable variability
in the spatial distribution of the hydrodynamics fields. Thus,
the application of LFT allows for an understanding of the
spatial variability of the residence time inside the bay and
offers a proper information tool for the local authorities. The
results of the LFT method reveal differences in renewal times
among different areas (for instance, where the mussel farms
are located) with residence times (LFT) around 15–20 days
and regions inside the bay with much larger residence times

(∼ 40–45 days). According to these data, the location of the
mussel farms could be considered optimal when the resi-
dence time is considered. Only locations closer to the bay
mouth show higher ratios of renovation. These results agree
with an approximation by Artigas et al. (2014).

Once the numerical model is implemented, calibrated and
validated, it can be used to test different interventions di-
rected to improve the water quality of the bay. Considering
that some of the main problems of the bay are related to
the long residence times (i.e. anoxia as observed by Camp
et al., 1992) and the high values of water temperatures dur-
ing summer, several management options have been tested to
find the best option to mitigate these negative effects. Two
actions are proposed and analysed here: the modification of
freshwater flows (both volume and spatial distribution) and
the artificial connection with open sea through the El Tra-
bucador bar. Both actions show a remarkable reduction in
the LFT (and corresponding TFT), mostly concentrated in
the inner area of the bay, with LFT in B3 and R2 almost
half of that observed in C case, as noted in similar studies
by Netto et al. (2012) and Lill et al. (2012). Previous stud-
ies have pointed out the presence of a region in the northeast
of the bay with low residence times (Cerralbo et al., 2019),
also described as a nutrient accumulation area (Artigas et
al., 2014). The LFT shows noticeable spatial variability, with
highest diminution in the region close to the artificial chan-
nel (in B1, B2 and B3) and the freshwater discharge points
(R1 and R2). The region where the mussel farms are located
also shows lower LFT than in the control case (reductions
ranging from 20 % in B1 and R1 to 30 % in B3 and R2), but
the differences are not as high as those observed in the inner
bay. The effects of opening a ∼ 1 km wide channel (B3) are
negligible in comparison to modifying the freshwater flows
in R2 (increase in fresh water mainly concentrated in the in-
ner channel). In that sense, the modification of the freshwa-
ter flows seems more feasible both economically and techni-
cally compared to artificially opening and maintaining a new
connection with the open sea. Moreover, the opening of the
sandbar would imply high economic (dredging, jetties) and
environmental costs (breaking of alongshore circulation and
transport of sediments and nutrients) that must be evaluated
cautiously.

The water temperature from the drainage canals used in
the simulations corresponds to the climatological values ob-
served in the Ebro River, not to the observations in the
drainage channels, which is similar to the temperature of the
water inside the bay (see Fig. 2). This is because the chan-
nel freshwater input would not decrease the temperature of
the bay water, but there is the possibility of doing this by
conducting cooler water from the river directly to the bay us-
ing an irrigation system. However, none of the analysed sce-
narios show significant differences in the evolution of water
temperature, and only the tests R1 and R2 show decreases of
∼ 0.5 ◦C in the regions closest to the freshwater input points.
The shallowness of the bay implies that the effects of solar

heating, which is significant during the summer in these re-
gions, influence the entire water column and counterbalance
the analysed solutions. An example of this is the temperature
of the open seawater, which is originally colder but heats up
rapidly upon entering the bay.

A comprehensive analysis of the complete set of simula-
tions reveals the complexity of the area under study and sug-
gests that effort must be invested for the regulation of fresh-
water flows. For instance, by modifying the flows, the resi-
dence times and water temperatures are affected, and also by
regulating the nutrient (and contaminants, suspended matter)
load of the freshwater flows the productivity of the bay may
be controlled. However, the effects of increasing the fresh-
water sources could lead to some disturbances over the bay:
e.g. stress over the marine biota and nutrient enrichment (in-
creasing the risk of HABs under some conditions). For that
reason, future works should consider the application of bio-
geochemical models (e.g. Nash et al., 2011) in the bay char-
acterizing the ecological behaviour of the bay and perform-
ing numerical simulations in order to understand the effects
of such modifications. All these actions should also be con-
sidered to avoid some of the climate change effects expected
in the region: sea level rise (promoting marine intrusion in
the rice fields and blocking the freshwater discharges) and an
increase in water temperature (increasing the probability of
mussel mortalities).

5 Conclusions

The management actions proposed for Alfacs Bay (i.e. bar
breaching and modification of freshwater flows) revealed the
effectiveness of increasing water renovation within the entire
bay, thus preventing the innermost areas of the bay from hav-
ing long residence times and the corresponding ecological
problems (i.e. anoxia events). Both proposed actions show
similar results. However, only the modification of freshwater
flows could be useful due to its lower impact on the environ-
ment and associated economic costs. On the other hand, none
of the proposed solutions solve one of the main problems of
the bay related to occasional extremely high temperatures in
summer (>28 ◦C). In this sense, the shallow depths of the
bay and the warm water temperature from the rice fields re-
strict the ability to address the issue of higher mussel mor-
tality. The application of a set of validated numerical mod-
els in a preoperational mode, nested into a CMEMS regional
model, has allowed us for the first time to provide objective
high-resolution predictions for stakeholders and end users of
the bay (fisheries and tourism) and to investigate the effects
of the proposed actions on the ecological problems of the
bay. Future works should include an analysis of wave effects
on water circulation, the application of biogeochemical mod-
els, and the consideration of different initial conditions and
met-ocean conditions on the determination of water renewal
in Alfacs Bay.
