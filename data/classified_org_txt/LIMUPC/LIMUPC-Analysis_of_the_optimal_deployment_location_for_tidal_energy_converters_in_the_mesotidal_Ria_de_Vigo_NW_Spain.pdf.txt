The potential power output expected from the installation of a tidal farm near the mesotidal Ria de Vigo
(NW Spain) is assessed using two different tidal stream energy converters (TEC). For this, the results of a
previous resource assessment based on a 28-day long hydrodynamic simulation are used. From this data
we identify the areas susceptible of hosting the farms, select the optimal location for them, and assess
the total available and extractable energy for each turbine type. Finally, using a simple farm design based
on standard inter-turbine separation, we estimate the expected power supplied by the farm. Irrespective
of the site, the total available tidal power in the areas susceptible of hosting the farms is around 150 MW;
at the optimal location, the hourly extractable power is about 22.5 MW, of which only between 10% and
15% can be harnessed by the designed farms, powering between 4411 and 6638 homes. A local analysis of
the most energetic subregions within these sites increases this ratio up to 30%. Nevertheless, the power
output is sufficient to fulfil the needs of between 1660 and 2213 households, depending on the chosen
site and the selected TEC.

1. Introduction

The sustained growth in energy demand expected in the near
future (37% by 2040 [1]), the depletion of fossil fuel reserves [2] and
the raising concern for the effects on global climate change of fossil
fuels (e.g. [3]) has increased the interest for the exploitation of
renewable energy sources. Amongst these, one of the most prom-
ising is undoubtedly linked to the highly predictable and periodical
tidal currents [4]. Although the principles behind wind and tidal
stream energy extraction are the same, the higher density of
seawater as compared to air assures that the power generated by
tidal energy conversion devices is much larger than that generated
by a wind energy converter under similar conditions.

Tidal stream resources have been assessed worldwide in the last
years, and key areas have been identified. For instance [5], quan-
tified the tidal energy potential in the Kennebec estuary in the USA
[6], and [7] estimated the tidal stream power in the Severn estuary
and in the Pentland Firth (UK) respectively, and [8] or [9] assessed

this resource in Fundy Bay (Canada) and Norway respectively.
Countries like Iran [10], China [11] or Korea [12] have also evaluated
the tidal resource at different locations along their coasts. In the
particular case of Spain, studies analyzing the potential for tidal
stream energy tapping have been focused mostly on its mesotidal
Atlantic coast ([13e15]).

The power supplied by a tidal energy extraction farm does not
only depend on the available energetic resource, but is modulated
by several technological, environmental and economic factors.
Financially speaking, the development of a tidal stream energy
converter (TEC) farm involves a huge investment. For example, the
estimated cost per turbine in the set of EPRI reports analyzing
different prospective tidal energy farm sites in the USA [16] ranges
from 1 to 2.25 million US$; the single turbine deployed at Race
Rocks (Canada) required a 4 million US$ investment [17], whereas
the SeaGen converter installed in Ireland costs about 11 million US$
[18]. The design of a tidal stream farm must take all these aspects
into account in order to optimize its power output.

On the other hand, environmental concerns limit the fraction of
available energy that can be extracted without incurring in signif-
icant alteration of the environment. It has been shown that tidal
energy extraction can lead to changes in the tidal range, dispersion

and transport patterns, water quality [19], sediment and erosion
patterns [20] or even in the wave energy regime, depending on the
particular wave-current interaction [21]. [19] found that the effects
of a tidal farm on suspended sediment concentrations could extend
as far as 15 km downstream. Other effects include adjustments in
salinity and nutrient distributions, changes in benthic habitats,
toxicity associated to paint, antifoulants and lubricants, interfer-
ence with animal movements ([22,23]), or even long-term changes
to biological population and communities [24]. To minimize these
effects [25], suggested introducing a Significant Impact Factor (SIF),
defined as the percentage of the total resource at a site that can be
extracted without significant environmental impact.

The extracted power depends also on the extraction devices and
their distribution within the farm array. Each TEC is designed and
built to respond in a particular manner to different flow speeds; its
power curve determines the power output as a function of the tidal
current speeds [26]. Furthermore, the density of turbines within a
farm affects the economic viability of the installation, since the
spacing between converters is a key element in determining the
overall performance of the turbine array. Narrow lateral spacing
might result in negative interaction between converters, such as
reduced power output or increased thrust forces [27], whereas
large spacing leads to an inefficient use of space. Optimal lateral
spacing might even accelerate the flow between turbines [28],
increasing the production of downstream devices. [29] proposes a
lateral spacing between turbines of 2.5 times their diameter, which
is the value considered here. On the other hand, the wake effects
and the flow speed reduction on the lee side of a tidal energy
converter determine the downstream separation between devices
[28]; found flow velocity deficits up to ten rotor diameters down-
stream of the generator. The grouping of several turbines into an
array becomes a balance of maximizing the total power output
while minimizing the input on the natural flow [30].

In this paper, the results for the Ria de Vigo presented in Ref. [15]
are used, together with the above considerations, to determine the
best location for the installation of a tidal stream energy farm in the
area. Following this, the expected power output of such a farmwith
a minimum impact on the environment is assessed, based on a
simple turbine distribution and using two different energy con-
verter devices with a publicly available power curve.

2. Study site

The Ria de Vigo (Fig. 1) is the southernmost of the four Rías
Baixas, located in the Northwestern Spanish Atlantic coast. It
stretches approximately 32 km in a roughNE-SW direction, with an
external width of 10 km and a depth in its central part of about
26 m, which decreases rapidly towards the banks [31]. This Ria
covers an area of about 185 km2, and has a volume capacity slightly
larger than 3250 H m3, this yields a surface/volume ratio of 0.05,
typical of V-shaped estuaries [32].

The waterbody is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through three
channels defined by the presence of the Cíes Islands at the estuary
mouth. The northern channel is around 2.5 km wide, with a
maximum depth of 23 m, while the southern mouth is wider and
deeper (5 km and 52 m, respectively), and the central channel,
separating both islands, is narrower and shallow [33].

Circulation patterns in the estuary are strongly conditioned by
the semidiurnal mesotides [34], by the wind regimes on the con-
tinental shelf and in the ria itself, and by the freshwater discharge
of the Oitab�en-Verdugo river system. The shallow andwide basin at
the estuary head is dominated by riverine output and currents
induced both by the tide and the local wind, whereas the area
closest to the mouth (between the Cíes Islands and the line joining
Mar Cape and Borneira Tip) is influenced mostly by tidal currents
and flows driven by the wind blowing over the continental shelf. In
between, the currents in the central stretch might be driven by any
or all of the aforementioned forcings.

Astronomical tides constitute the principal contribution to the
sea level variations in this area, with a range varying between
0.82 m and 4.21 m, and a mean value of 2.4 m. These are much
larger than typical storm surges, although surge values of �1.08 m
and 0.69 m have been observed during the 1992e2009 period [35].

The tidal stream exergy for the Ria de Vigo has been estimated
previously [15] from the results of a 28 day long numerical simu-

exclusively by tidal sea levels and currents. The results found

therein are used in this paper to compare the power output sup-
plied by a tidal energy converter farm based on two different types
of generators.

In spite of the flow beingmostly tidally-driven [15], showed that
the exergy of the tidal stream within the estuary is too small to be
extracted under the actual technological conditions. Inside the Ría,
tidal currents seldom reach 1m/s, which is the minimum threshold
proposed by Ref. [36] for feasible tidal energy harnessing. However,
the same study identified a 7.5 km2 area outside the estuary, in the
strait between the northern Cíes island and the mainland (Fig. 1), in
which the average power density exceeds the minimum value of
0.5125 kW/m2 corresponding to the 1 m/s threshold. Thus, it pre-
sents a significant potential for tidal stream exploitation. The total
theoretically available power density for this area has been esti-
mated at around 3865 MWh/m2 per annum [15], which is higher
than the resource estimated by Refs. [13] and [37] in the nearby Ria
de Muros and the Ria de Ribadeo, respectively, both along the NW
Spanish coast.

3.2. Tidal in-stream energy converters

Two tidal stream energy converters with an available power
curve have been considered in this work: the Rotech Tidal Turbine
(RTT2000) by Lunar Energy, and the SeaGen-S generator by Marine
Current Turbines. These devices have been selected after evaluating
the characteristics (e.g., installation depth or rated speed) and
availability of the power curves of 18 devices [38], and their suit-
ability for this study case.

The RTT200 is a horizontal axis generator with a symmetrical
Venturi duct (Fig. 2, left) that guides the flow to the central turbine
from a wide range of directions while increasing the current speed,
thus eliminating the need for a yaw control system. The generator is
placed on a gravity base (i.e., kept in position by its own weight)
that lifts the device about 7 m above the bed. The diameter of the
duct is 25 m, with 7.8 m long blades and a 3.9 m central hub. With
these dimensions, and granting a 5 m top clearance, the minimum
water depth that allows the installation of this converter is 37 m.
The configuration used herein supplies 2 MW at a rated speed of
3.1 m/s, with a 1 m/s cut-in velocity [39].

On the other hand, the SeaGen-S converter incorporates twin
horizontal axis rotors mounted on a crossbeam supported by a
surface-piercing tubular steel tower (Fig. 2, right). Each rotor is
20 m in diameter, providing a total swept area of 628 m2, and relies
on blade pitching for flood and ebb production [40]. With a 5 m
clearance at the top and at the bottom, the minimum water depth

possible for this type of converter is about 31m. The SeaGen-S has a
cut-in tidal speed of 1 m/s, and a 2 MW rated power at 2.5 m/s flow
velocity. According to the developer [41], the device is suitable for
marine environments in water depths up to 38 m.

The main characteristics of each converter are summarized in
Table 1. The respective power curves, extracted from Ref. [39] for
the RTT2000 turbine and from Ref. [42] for the SeaGen-S converter,
are shown in Fig. 3. These curves provide an indication of the tur-
bine efficiency, taking into account Betz's limit and the exergy that
is destroyed during the energy conversion process (mostly in the
form of heat [43]), as a function of the tidal current speed.
3.3. Tidal farm configuration

The design of a tidal energy farm must take into account several
factors, such as the maximum installable number of turbines to
maximize the exploitability of the resource, the downstream and
lateral separation between turbines, the farm orientation, or the
probable environmental impact of the farm.

In order to optimize the capture of tidal stream energy, the tidal
farm considered herein is a simple several-row array of turbines,
perpendicular to the main direction of the flow (in this case,
coincident with the direction of the channel). The separation be-
tween both rows is taken as 10 times the diameter of the turbine
rotor, as suggested by Refs. [29] and [28], while the inter-turbine
lateral separation is 2.5 times the diameter [29]. Although, in
general, the lateral spacing could be affected by the yawing motion
of the turbines to adapt to the flow from awide range of directions,
neither the RTT2000 nor the SeaGen-S devices include a yaw
control system, so this motion is not considered for the determi-
nation of the lateral distance between turbines. The total number of
turbines per row will depend on the ratio between the total
extractable power resource and the expected power output per
turbine.

The extractable energy (i.e., the fraction of the available energy
that can be tapped without significant environmental effects) is
characterized by the Significant Impact Factor (SIF). The SIF might
range between 10% and 30%, depending on the type of site
([44e46]). Following [47], a SIF of 15% is adopted in this study.

4. Results and discussion

The selection of the optimal location to install a tidal energy
plant must consider several factors, such as the available average
power density, the distance to the coast, and the local water depth,
which should allow for the installation of the converter plus suit-
able top and bottom clearances. Typical clearance values are be-
tween 5 and 10 m near the surface, allowing the passage of most
vessels, while the bottom clearance is usually taken as 5m or 25% of
the water depth, whichever is largest [29].

With these clearances, the minimum depth required for the
deployment of the tidal energy converters restricts the area sus-
ceptible of hosting the farm. As can be seen in Fig. 4, a large fraction
of the most energetic area identified by Ref. [15] in the channel is
unsuitable for the installation of both the RTT2000 and the SeaGen-
S devices, since the water depth is smaller than 31 m. The deeper
zones are located to the north of this area, in which the depth can
reach up to 50 m. From the 7.5 km2 originally suggested by Ref. [15]

de Vigo (NW Spain), Energy (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.20
for the development of a tidal energy farm near the Ria de Vigo,
only 9% (0.7 km2, Area 1) is apt for the SeaGen-S converter while
0.65 km2 (i.e., 8%, Area 2) can support the deployment of RTT2000
converters.

Fig. 5 shows the spatial distribution of APD within each of these
areas. In both cases, the highest-energy region (delimited by cells
C1eC4) is located at the southeastern end of the site.

Using the numerical results from the 28-day simulation, the
total annual energetic potential can be estimated to be
181.11 MWh/m2 at Area 1 and 139.1 MWh/m2 at Area 2. These
values represent approximately 4.6% and 3.6% of the total annual
potential available in the whole selected region, which was evalu-
ated to be 3865 MWh/m2 by Ref. [15].

The energy that could be potentially generated by an array of
tidal energy converters can be determined following the flux
method [44], based on the calculation of the incoming kinetic flux
through the frontal cross-sectional area of a flow channel within
the selected site, and is independent of the device type, packing
density or distribution. Within each computational cell i, the total
cross-sectional power available (Pflux,i) can be defined as the
product of the average power density (APDi), the water depth (di)
and the cross-sectional width (wi). The total available power (Pflux)
within a region is the combination of the individual Pflux,i's, and
must be corrected with the Significant Impact Factor (SIF) in order
to provide an estimation of the available extractable power:

Pextr ¼ Pflux$SIF ¼ SIF$

Since the tidal stream energy converters are to be normal to the
typical flow direction in the channel in order to ensure maximum
efficiency, wi has been taken as the diagonal length of each
computational cell (i.e., wi ¼

, and Dx ¼ Dy ¼ 150 m).

With this assumption, the flux method shows that, on average,
150.078 MWof power is available for extraction at Area 1, of which
22.512 MW can be tapped without exerting a significant impact on
the environment; at Area 2, these values are very similar, with
149.600 MW of available power, and 22.440 MW of extractable
power.

The maximum theoretical number of devices that can be sup-
ported in each of the Areas can be estimated from the ratio between

the extractable power and the gross power extracted by a single
turbine, obtained by combining the frequency histogram of the
flow speed and the respective power curves. By operating on a cell-
by-cell basis, the results show that the extractable power at Area 1
is sufficient to feed up to 159 SeaGen-S converters, whereas Area 2
would require 276 RTT2000 generators to remove all of its
extractable power.

However, the number of tidal stream energy converters that can
be deployed is limited by physical considerations, such as the
lateral and downstream separation necessary to avoid

hydrodynamic interference between neighboring turbines (via the
alteration of the flow patterns), as mentioned before. As an
example, herein we consider a simple farm configuration with
parallel rows of turbines perpendicular to the main flow direction,
and keeping the aforementioned downstream separation between
rows of 10f, and lateral inter-turbine distance of 2.5f. With this
design, Area 1 allows for the deployment of 24 SeaGen-S turbines,
and 26 RTT2000 devices could be installed in Area 2 (Fig. 6).

The power output of the turbines at each cell is obtained by
combining the current speed frequency distribution (Fig. 7) with

the power curve for each device. The frequency analysis reveals
that, in both areas, the currents are below the cut-in threshold (i.e.,
1.0 m/s) over 50% of the time. In Area 1, the flow speed exceeds this
value between 25% and 50% of the time, with smaller values at the
edges of the Area, and larger ones along the central cells, whereas
the exceedance time is lower in Area 2, ranging from 22% to 35%.
The flow direction (not shown) is mostly along a NNW-SSE direc-
tion (about 70% of the time), with smaller contributions from
immediately neighboring sectors (between 10 and 20%). This sup-
ports the selection of non-yawing turbines for this study. Fig. 8
shows the power output per turbine at each computational cell,
highlighting the fact that the power extraction capacity of the
SeaGen-S turbine is more efficient at the velocity ranges encoun-
tered in this area than that of the RTT2000 converter, thus leading
to a smaller number of SeaGen-S converters required, although the
amount of extractable energy is higher in Area 1 than it is in Area 2.

This analysis shows that the overall power output of the
SeaGen-S farmwould be of 3146.1 kW, representing just 14% of the
total extractable power; on the other hand, an RTT2000 farm with
this configuration would supply 2090.9 kW, barely 10% of the
extractable power in Area 2. Thus, the yearly power production for
both farms would range between 27.6 GWh for the SeaGen-S tur-
bines and slightly over 18.3 GWh for the RT2000 farm.

Assuming that the losses between the tidal stream farms and
the main electricity distribution grid are of the order of 5% (e.g.
Fig. 7. Frequency histograms for the barotropic curr

[48]) and considering that the average household electricity con-
sumption in Spain in 2014 was of 3944 kWh/year [49], these tidal
stream energy farms could provide the necessary power for be-
tween 6638 homes (SeaGen-S farm) and 4411 households
(RTT2000 farm). These results are comparable to the number of
homes (approximately 6500) that are expected to be powered by
several planned tidal stream farms in the UK, such as the Skerries
Tidal Stream Array (6500 homes [50]) or the Sound of Islay Tidal
Array (5400 households [51]).

The potential of the most energetic subregions of each area
identified in Fig. 5 by cells C1eC4, is also assessed. These compu-
tational cells, extending over 0.09 km2, are centered on the cell
with highest power potential. As before, the extractable power for
these cells is calculated using the flux method, corrected with the
15% SIF, and is given in Table 2.

The frequency histograms for currents at cells C1 to C4 selected
in Area 1 and Area 2 are shown in Fig. 9. The output power per
turbine for each cell in terms of the current speed distribution is
shown in Fig. 10, whereas the total output power per turbine and
per cell is given in Table 2.

The total number of these devices that would be necessary for
the optimal extraction of tidal stream energy in Area 1 is 18,
whereas 36 RTT2000 turbines would be required to extract the
maximum amount of energy from the tidal stream in Area 2. Farms
using this number of turbines would harness 87.8% of the available
ent speed at all the cells in Area 1 and Area 2.

the spatial and temporal distribution of the tidal currents. The
average power density associated to these flows has been assessed
previously from the results of a 28-day long numerical simulation
[15]. Since this location depends, amongst other factors, on the
relation between the water depth and the size (diameter) of the
converters, two different horizontal axis turbines have been
considered for the sake of comparison: Lunar Energy's RTT2000,
and MCT's SeaGen-S. The power curve of both turbines allows also
estimating and comparing the power output that can be expected
within this region.

Once the threshold for exploitable energy and waterdepth re-
strictions have been considered, only small areas seem suitable for
the installation of a tidal farm. For the SeaGen-S device, this area
extends over 0.7 km2, whereas it is slightly smaller (0.6 km2) for the
RTT2000, since the latter requires deeper waters than the former. In
spite of this, the annual energetic potential in these small areas is
considerable, exceeding 181 MWh/m2 and 139 MWh/m2, respec-
tively. The use of the fluxmethod allows calculating the total power
that could be extracted without exerting a significant impact on the
environment. For Area 1 (SeaGen-S), and considering a 15% SIF, the
mean hourly extractable power is 22.51 MW, and 22.44 MW for
Area 2 (RTT2000). The inter-turbine spacing specifications required
to optimize energy tapping and minimize environmental impact
imply, however, that only a fraction of this potential can be actually
extracted.

A simple-design farm extending over the selected Areas, with
parallel rows of converters set perpendicularly to the main flow
(channel) direction and complying with the lateral and down-
stream spacing conditions, serves to quantify this ratio. Whereas
the total energy potential in the farm area is sufficient to feed 159
SeaGen-S (Area 1) and 276 RTT2000 (Area 2) turbines, space re-
quirements reduce these numbers to only 24 SeaGen-S and 26
RTT2000 turbines. With these arrangements, the potential power
output by the farms is between 10% and 15% of the available
extractable power in the region. Even with these small ratios, the
extracted power output is sufficient to fulfil the energy re-
quirements of between 4411 homes (RTT2000 farm) and 6638
households (SeaGen-S farm). The extraction ratio increases to
about 30% if only the most energetic location within each Area is
considered, although in this case the number of powered homes is
evidently smaller, between 2213 and 1660 for Area 1 and Area 2,
respectively.

This study shows that, from a resource point of view, the Ria de

Vigo estuary has enough potential for the installation of tidal en-
ergy converters which could, in principle, power over 6600 homes.
However, the number of turbines required to provide this output
might render the full exploitation of the proposed area unpractical
from an economic standpoint due to the large capital costs
involved. Since these are largely site-specific, it is difficult to
determine a typical installation cost. Although a detailed economic
analysis has not been done, the figures provided in the introductory
section suggest nevertheless that the scheme presented herein
might not be cost-effective for the development of a commercial
farm under current technological conditions. Still, it is expected
that continuous research in eand improvement of e converter
devices, experience and innovation should allow to reduce the
economic costs of tidal energy harvesting in the future.
