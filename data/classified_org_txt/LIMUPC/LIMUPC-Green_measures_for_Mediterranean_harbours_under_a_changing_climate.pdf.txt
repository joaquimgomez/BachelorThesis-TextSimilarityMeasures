Abstract 
 
Harbour operability may be hampered by climate change. Green solutions can be used to 

provide extra flexibility with respect to present grey infrastructures to adapt and mitigate such 

functional disruptions with affordable costs. This paper assesses the performance of a green 

solution (a seagrass meadow) by assessing its effectiveness through numerical modelling. The 

analysis is carried out at two harbours that under present climate are prone to wave agitation 

and overtopping problems. The efficiency of different seagrass layouts are tested at both sites, 

by comparing relevant hydrodynamic parameters. It is concluded that, for moderated sea level 

rise (SLR) rates, illustrated by the central trend of a medium scenario from IPCC (2013), the use 

of seagrass meadows would be effective enough to attenuate the impact of SLR on breakwater 

overtopping. In addition, the use of such measures could dampen increases in port agitation 

due to changes in wave direction originated by climate change. Nevertheless, the complexity of 

interactions between hydrodynamics and seagrass would require periodic monitoring and re-

evaluation for maintaining acceptable risk levels, especially in case of high-end scenarios.

1. Introduction 
 

Coasts are dynamic areas that foster growth by integrating several uses (e.g. tourism, fishing, 

aquaculture, maritime transport, etc.) that impose a severe anthropogenic footprint. Harbour 

structures and operations need to combine economic and environmental objectives in a 

sustainable manner. Under future climates, the effects of sea level rise (SLR), changes in wave 

patterns and storminess may alter this fragile balance and hamper sustainable long-term 

coastal and port management. 

 

Climate change has become a major focus of attention, in particular for vulnerable systems like 

low-lying coasts (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2011). In the last years, a number of studies have 

addressed the effects of SLR on beaches (e.g. Luo et al., 2015; Monioudi et al., 2016; Revell et 

al., 2011; Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2011), coastal defense structures (e.g. Burcharth et al., 2014; 

Isobe, 2013), coastal ecosystems (e.g. Kane et al., 2015), overtopping of port breakwaters 

(Sierra et al., 2016) or flooding of urban areas (e.g. Hallegatte et al., 2011; Paudel et al., 2015). 

Other studies have analysed the impacts of climate change shifts of wave patterns on beaches 



3 

(e.g. Adams et al., 2011; Casas-Prat et al., 2016; Sierra and Casas-Prat, 2014; Zacharioudaki 

and Reeve, 2011) or harbours (Casas-Prat and Sierra, 2010, 2012; Sierra et al., 2015). 

Recently, Sánchez-Arcilla et al. (2016a) assessed the impacts of SLR and changes in wave 

patterns on ports. 

 

To lessen the impacts of climate change on coastal areas and activities, many studies have 

proposed adaptation measures (e.g. Anthoff et al., 2010; Hinkel et al., 2013, 2014; Klein et al., 

2001; Linham and Nicholls, 2012; Moritz et al., 2015; Mycoo and Chadwick, 2012; Sánchez-

Arcilla et al., 2016b). The main adaptation alternatives can be categorized as grey and green 

measures. Grey measures correspond to conventional civil engineering works such as structure 

reinforcement or increasing breakwater freeboard. Green measures are solutions inspired and 

supported by nature, bringing natural processes to build resilience (e.g. the use of vegetation for 

coastal protection). The more common measures in port engineering are grey interventions that 

may provide immediate solutions but with high costs and rigidity (i.e. difficulty for changing the 

adopted measure if it does not work properly) as a drawback. In case that functionality needs 

are not met, the upgrading and substitution of these grey measures may be hampered due to 

technological limits and costs.  

 

Grey infrastructure may induce a steady hydrodynamic behaviour that can lead to local 

problems (Airoldi et al. 2005). Green solutions can soften some of these drawbacks, attenuating 

hydrodynamic drivers through the interaction of ecological and hydraulic processes (e.g. Jones 

et al., 2012; Keijsers et al., 2015; Pontee et al., 2016; van Loon-Steensma, 2015). For example, 

vegetated areas such as salt marshes or wetlands, reduce incoming wave length and velocity, 

and dissipate wave energy (e.g. Horstman et al., 2014; Möller, 2006; Möller et al., 1999; Vuik et 

al., 2016). This green solution also decreases surge heights (Möller et al., 2014) and acts as a 

natural beach defence (e.g. Arkema et al., 2013; Borsje et al., 2011; Gedan et al., 2011; 

Temmerman et al., 2012, 2013). Various laboratory (e.g. Blackmar et al., 2013; Koftis et al., 

2013; Manca et al., 2012) and field studies (e.g. Bradley and Houser, 2009; Verduin and 

Backhaus, 2000) have quantified the magnitude of wave attenuation facilitating the application 

of such green solutions for maintaining coastal resilience with affordable economic and energy 

costs.  

 

Seaports, located on open coasts or estuaries, are affected by SLR, storm surges and wave 

storms. The increase in mean sea level or changes in wave climate will condition essential 

aspects of harbour operations and infrastructure, modifying risk levels and economic 

productivity (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2016a). Moreover, local problems under present climate, 

such as erosion induced by ship propellers (Mujal-Colilles et al. 2017), may be modulated by 

changes in marine drivers, adding an extra layer of complexity for harbour logistics.

SLR will modify wave propagation patterns around and inside the harbour affecting wave 

agitation (oscillations within the port), siltation or structure stability (Sierra and Casas-Prat, 

2014). SLR also reduces the port breakwater freeboard, increasing the magnitude and 

frequency of overtopping discharges and affecting the assets located at the breakwater lee side. 

 

Changes in wave height will modify the amount of energy penetrating into harbours, while 

changes in wave period or direction will affect propagation processes such as shoaling, 

refraction and diffraction. This could induce changes in sediment transport patterns (potentially 

generating siltation) or wave penetration into harbours (Sierra and Casas-Prat, 2014), affecting 

port operability.  

 

Most climate measures applied to harbours have been based on conventional grey engineering 

solutions. For this reason, this paper aims to make a preliminary assessment of the engineering 

performance (measured in terms of overtopping discharge and wave agitation) that green 

solutions can provide for port adaptation against future climates. The effectiveness of these 

interventions is assessed for two harbours located on the Spanish Mediterranean coast, using 

hydrodynamic numerical models validated for the area and vegetation parameterisations from a 

large-scale wave flume data. The two small-craft harbours analysed have currently exploitation 

problems, one due to wave agitation (Cases d’Alcanar), and the other one due to breakwater 

overtopping (Cala Canyelles). Simulations comprise different vegetation layouts to analyse the 

relationship between vegetation features and hydrodynamic wave patterns.  

 
2. Site description 
 

The two studied ports are located on the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean), as shown in 

Figure 1. This is a microtidal environment with an average tidal range of about 25 cm. The 

meteorology and oceanography of this area are very complex due to orographic barriers like the 

Pyrenees, veering winds, shadow effects caused by the Balearic Islands and irregular 

bathymetry (continental shelf of variable width and existence of submarine canyons close to the 

coast). This leads to a large spatial and seasonal variability of wind and wave fields (Lionello et 

al., 2002, Campins et al., 2011), with mild wave conditions most of the time (average significant 

wave height lower than 1 m) and sporadic wave storms that can reach up to 7.5 m in extreme 

events (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2008). The most frequent waves are those from the East (largest 

heights) and South (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2008). 

 

The general trend in the Mediterranean shows a relative decrease in wave energy projections 

(Lionello et al., 2008), though combined with SLR this can result in either higher or lower waves 

depending on the coastal sector due to the effects of shoaling, refraction and diffraction. These 

projections are similar to those of Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013) who found a general decrease 

of the median Hs in most of the NW Mediterranean, with local rises of this parameter (e.g. Gulf 



5 

of Genoa). The seasonal wave distribution will also change, with greater median Hs in summer 

and lower in winter. Extreme events will decrease in frequency, but they may increase in 

intensity. Results also show changes in the seasonal distribution of directional frequencies 

which, in turn, can generate changes in sediment transport patterns or in the amount of wave 

energy penetrating into ports, whose entrances are usually oriented towards the South.  

 

3. Methodology 
 
To assess the performance of green interventions under future climates some plausible 

scenarios must be selected, derived from the last projections presented by the IPCC (2013) in 

its 5th Assessment Report (AR5). 

 

The IPCC-AR5 maps of SLR for the Mediterranean Sea (IPCC, 2013) indicate the possibility of 

an increase slightly lower (about 10%) than the global mean. Hence, the following estimations 

by the end of the century can be proposed, taking into account the IPCC (2013) scenarios and 

this 10% reduction: 0.47 m for RCP 4.5 (central estimate) and 0.88 m for RCP 8.5 (upper band) 

scenarios. A high-end SLR scenario (HES) of 1.8 m has also been considered. This is 

consistent with studies (e.g. Mori et al., 2013) that suggest reaching global SLR near 1.86 m or 

even 2 m (Rahmstorf, 2007) by 2100. These studies indicate that a sharp increase of mean sea 

level is possible, despite that the probability of occurrence is low (less than 5%), but non 

negligible (Jevrejeva et al., 2014). Figure 2 shows the evolution of SLR during the 21st century 

for the three scenarios considered. 

 

To compute overtopping discharges over the selected port breakwaters, the Empirical Methods 

proposed by the European Overtopping Manual (Pullen et al., 2007) are used, based on the 

values of wave height and structure freeboard, so that a proper wave propagation until the 

breakwater toe is essential. The SWAN model (Booij et al., 1999) is chosen for this propagation, 

because of its ability to reproduce energy dissipation due to vegetation (Vuik et al., 2016). This 

code has a vegetation module that has been validated by Suzuki et al. (2012). To assess the 

effects of vegetation, selected waves are propagated with and without vegetation in front of 

Cala Canyelles port breakwater, computing Hs at the breakwater toe in both cases. The 

computed Hs values are then used to estimate overtopping discharges. Waves corresponding to 

three return periods are considered: 1 year (frequent storms), 5 years (intense storms) and 50 

years (exceptional storms). The first and second return periods are typically used to determine 

the port operability whereas the last stands for the breakwater design conditions. In each case, 

six possible wave directions are analysed, due to the location of the port within a bay: E, ESE, 

SE, SSE, S and SSW. The resulting 18 wave conditions (3 return periods x 6 directions) have 

been used in 4 scenarios of SLR: 0 cm (to account for present conditions) and the previously 

mentioned future scenarios of SLR: 47 cm, 88 cm and 180 cm, totaling 72 hydrodynamic 

conditions. All these combination of waves and SLR are taken into account to carry out wave 



6 

propagations over three bottom configurations: no vegetation (present state) and two vegetation 

meadows, a sparse configuration with 50 stems/m2 and a dense layout with 100 stems/m2. The 

resulting combination of wave conditions, mean water levels and vegetation layouts has given a 

total of 216 simulations. Figure 3 shows the location and dimensions of the seagrass meadow, 

with a cross-shore width of 160 m and the same length as the breakwater (about 100 m). The 

stem height in all cases is 1 m. The drag coefficient has been computed using Myrhaug and 

Holmedal (2011). The seagrass has been placed in front of the breakwater to damp incoming 

waves and reduce overtopping. The cross-shore width of the meadow has been defined to span 

several wave lengths and, thus, guarantee an efficient wave attenuation.  

 

To study port agitation, SWAN may not be the preferred tool, because the involved physical 

processes demand a phase-resolving approximation. Therefore, a Bousinessq–type (BT) 

model, that can handle shoaling, refraction, diffraction, reflection, bottom friction and non-linear 

interactions is chosen instead. A wide description of the advantages, disadvantages and 

performance of this type of models can be found in Filippini et al. (2015). 

 

To account for the effect of vegetation in this type of models, there are two possible 

approaches: 

 

- Through a drag coefficient, whose value depends on the meadow features (stem length, 

stem diameter, plant density...). In this case the Boussinesq equations are modified by 

adding an extra term to account for the drag forces generated by the vegetation (e.g. 

Huang et al., 2011). 

- Through a friction factor that is calibrated with laboratory experiments, to obtain this 

factor as a function of the stem density and Ursell number (e.g. Blackmar et al., 2013; 

Lynett et al., 2002). 

In this paper the second approach is followed, calibrating the friction factor of the BT model with 

data from the experiments of Koftis et al. (2013). To assess the effect of vegetation on wave 

attenuation inside the harbour, two meadow configurations of Zostera marina have been placed 

between the two breakwaters of the Cases d’Alcanar port. Figure 4 shows the location and 

dimensions of both configurations. Layout A covers an area of 5175 m2 (115 x 45 m) whereas 

layout B represents a large solution with 7250 m2 (145 x 50 m). Zostera marina is the dominant 

seagrass species of the northern hemisphere, being present in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans 

and the Mediterranean, Baltic and North Seas (Reusch et al., 2000). The density assumed is 

high (360 stems/m2) to be the same used by Koftis et al. (2013) in lab experiments. The 

meadows are placed at the port mouth to minimize the wave energy penetrating within the 

harbour.  

 



7 

Since for port agitation SLR is not as critical as for breakwater overtopping, in Cases d’Alcanar 

case only the effect of climate change on waves has been taken into account without 

considering any SLR scenario. To perform the agitation analysis, the wave climate described in 

Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013) and the methodology followed in Sierra et al. (2015) have been 

chosen. Wave projections obtained with the SWAN model forced by winds generated with five 

combinations of global (GSMs) and regional circulations models (RCMs) that consider the A1B 

scenario of the 4th Assessment Report from IPCC (2007) have been used since no AR5 

downscaled projections were available. For the five wave datasets, present (1971-2000) and 

future (2071-2100) wave conditions have been selected. For each wave dataset, three 

directions (E, SE and S, due to the proximity of the Ebro Delta, (Sánchez-Arcilla et al. (2008)) 

and five representative wave heights (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 5 m) have been taken into account 

to assess port agitation, meaning 75 simulations for each of the 4 studied conditions (present 

waves without vegetation and future waves without vegetation, with layout A and with layout B). 

 
3. Results 

 
A sample computation of the improvement in breakwater overtopping achieved by vegetation is 

shown in Figure 5. The figure indicates the magnitude of wave height reduction around Cala 

Canyelles port depending on whether vegetation is present or not, for a particular case of wave 

and SLR conditions (waves from the South, with Hs0 = 5m and SLR = 0.47 m, where Hs0 is the 

offshore significant wave height). This example illustrates how the presence of seagrass 

reduces wave height in the vegetated area, this reduction increases as the wave propagates 

through the meadow, reaching a minimum wave height at the toe of the breakwater. In the 

example, a maximum attenuation of 40% is provided at the shallowest position of the meadow 

at about 4 m depth. 

 

In Figure 6, the results of wave propagation for all the studied cases are summarized by plotting 

the ratio between the significant wave heights obtained at the toe of the breakwater with 

vegetation (Hsv) and without vegetation (Hswv). The left graph shows the results for 50 stems/m
2 

and the right one corresponds to 100 stems/m2. It is apparent that wave attenuation increases 

with vegetation density, as shown also in Table 1. For a density of 100 stems/m2 the decrease 

induced by vegetation is almost twice that the obtained when the density is 50 stems/m2.  

 

There is a general trend indicating larger attenuation when Hs0 is greater, despite some 

modulation due to the wave period, which also has a certain influence in wave attenuation. 

Thus, for Hs0 = 2.77 m the average reduction considering all cases is 2.8%, whereas for Hs0 = 

9.59 m the average decrease reaches 24.6%.  

 

Higher SLR leads to lower wave attenuation, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 6, although the 

effect of SLR is less than that of vegetation density. Thus, for 50 stems/m2 the average 



8 

reduction of wave height decreases from 11.4% (for SLR = 0.0 m) to 8.7% (for SLR = 1.80 m), 

while for 100 stems/m2 the decrease is from 21.1% (for SLR = 0.0 m) to 16.4% (for SLR = 1.80 

m). 

 

The reduction of wave height entails a lower overtopping discharge, as it can be observed in 

Figure 7, where the ratio of this discharge with vegetation (qv) and without vegetation (qwv) is 

presented for all the simulated cases. The decrease of overtopping discharges follows the same 

trends as the wave height attenuation, but magnified due to the non-linear relationship between 

both parameters. Thus, for example, for 50 stems/m2 and the highest offshore waves, the 

reduction of significant wave height at the toe of the breakwater due to vegetation ranges 

between 15.4% and 19.3% (depending on the magnitude of SLR), while the decrease of 

overtopping discharge varies between 29.7% and 59%. For the 100 stems/m2 cases, these 

reductions vary from 28.1% to 34.2% for wave heights and 51% to 84.5% for overtopping 

discharges.   

 

In Table 2 the impact of SLR on overtopping discharges (with respect to present conditions 

without vegetation) is presented, showing the performance of different vegetation densities in 

this port. In the cases without vegetation, a SLR of 0.47 m almost doubles the present 

overtopping discharge, whilst a SLR of 0.88 m would more than triple the present volumes and 

a high-end scenario (SLR = 1.80 m) would increase overtopping by an order of magnitude. The 

introduction of vegetation with a moderate density (50 stems/m2) would reduce significantly the 

previous discharge increases, although only in the case of no SLR would the present 

overtopping rates be reduced. The increase in vegetation density (100 stems/m2) would reduce 

more the resulting overtopping and it could even compensate a SLR of 0.47 m. 

Another factor that has been analysed is the reduction of overtopping discharge due to the 

presence of seagrass meadows as a function of wave direction. In Figure 8, the percentage 

reduction of this discharge is presented for two cases: present bathymetry and SLR of 0.47 m 

(corresponding to the central band of RCP4.5 scenario). The analysis has been performed for 

the 6 wave directions (E, ESE, SE, SSE, S and SSW) of interest for the selected port. The 

lowest reductions are obtained in all cases for SE and SSE sectors, followed by S component. 

On the contrary, E and ESE sectors present the largest overtopping reductions. 

 
Figure 9 shows a sample computation of the port agitation due to vegetation at the Cases 

d’Alcanar port. The upper panel illustrates the wave field generated by the propagation of an 

irregular time series with Hs0 = 2.5 m from the East for present conditions. The simulated wave 

field inside the harbour ranges from Hs = 0.1 m to 0.3 m. Larger wave heights are found close to 

the entrance, ranging from 1.2 m to 0.4 m. The middle panel of Figure 9 shows the variation (in 

percentage) of Hs when the seagrass meadow A of Figure 4 is placed in the port mouth. In most 

of the domain the variations are rather low, below 2.5%. Major reductions are found in the 

immediate area of influence of the meadow with reduction rates between 5% and 15% over the 



9 

seagrass and up to 40% close to the dike outside the seagrass. In the bottom panel of Figure 9, 

the percentage of variation of Hs with layout B is presented. The results are similar to those of 

the middle panel, although wave reduction is enhanced, in particular within the port. 

 

In Table 3 the port average agitation variations for the selected models and layouts studied are 

summarized. If the present configuration (no vegetation) is maintained, the comparison between 

present and future wave climates shows future increases in agitation between 3% and 4% for 

Cases d’Alcanar port. A significant reduction of agitation is obtained in all models when 

seagrass is placed in the port mouth. The effect of the layout A meadow, shown in Figure 4 left, 

results in a future averaged agitation reduced 6.9%. If a larger meadow is considered (layout B, 

Figure 4 right) the total reduction is about 7.7%. 

 
4. Discussion  
 

The use of a seagrass meadow as a “green” solution for reducing the impact of climate change 

on breakwater overtopping and wave agitation in ports is a promising alternative but requires 

further quantification and engineering criteria. 

 

The obtained results show that placing a vegetation meadow in front of port breakwaters 

reduces significantly the wave height at the breakwater toe. The magnitude of this reduction 

depends on the density of plants. Of the two configurations analysed here, the denser one (100 

stems/m2) generated reductions of Hs at the breakwater toe almost twice those of the less 

dense meadow (50 stems/m2). These lower wave heights lead, in turn, to lower overtopping 

rates. For present sea level conditions, a meadow with a density of 50 stems/m2 generates 

overtopping reductions between 13% and 59% depending on the wave height, while doubling 

the plant density would reduce overtopping between 24% and 84%. These results are in line 

with Manca et al. (2012) and Koftis et al. (2013) who indicated that wave attenuation is greater 

for larger plant densities (number of stems per square meter).  

 

As expected, higher wave heights experience larger reduction by the meadow. In shallow areas 

the seagrass meadow effect on wave kinematics is mainly controlled by wave slope and depth. 

As a result, the seagrass meadow induces greater wave energy dissipation for higher waves. 

This is due to the greater orbital velocities associated to the higher waves which, in turn, give 

rise to larger Reynolds numbers and turbulent dissipation. In addition, waves with larger wave 

lengths are more attenuated (Koftis et al. (2013)).. 

 

Another factor that significantly bounds the overtopping discharge is SLR because it reduces 

the freeboard and increases the water depth, allowing higher waves to reach the breakwater 

without breaking. This has become a key point for Cala Canyelles, representing a small 

freeboard harbour (about 2.5 m above the mean water level). Even a SLR of 0.47 m would 



10 

generate overtopping flows that double those under present conditions. Vegetation would 

reduce these volumes, but a density of 50 stems/m2 would not be enough for keeping present 

discharges. Denser meadows (100 stems/m2) would compensate this SLR increase of 0.47 m 

for the directions that induce greater overtopping, albeit for the directions with lower present 

discharges (SE to S) the flows would be larger than now. The deployment of vegetation could, 

thus, offset the impact of SLR on overtopping and without any additional grey engineering 

measure. The average overtopping (all directions) would be reduced about 14% for the studied 

case (SLR = 0.47 m and 100 stems/m2) with respect to the present situation.  

 

For larger values of SLR (0.88 or 1.80 m), the vegetation patch would reduce overtopping 

discharges but would not be enough to keep present values. In this case, additional grey 

measures would be necessary to mantain the port infrastructure and operations.  

 

The depth influence on wave height reduction has been investigated for the Cala Canyelles 

case. Several field studies (Möller et al., 1999; Bradley and Houser, 2009) have shown that 

most of the wave height reduction occurred with a few meters of vegetation patch. In addition, 

laboratory tests (Manca et al., 2012; Koftis et al., 2013) concluded that the wave height 

reduction is larger for high submergence ratios, which is the ratio between stem height and 

water depth. Figure 5 confirms these previous results because in a large part of the meadow 

(the one with the lowest submergence ratios) the wave attenuation is relatively small. This 

suggest that, probably, the size (cross-shore width) of the meadow could be reduced, obtaining 

similar results. 

 

The influence of wave direction on wave attenuation and overtopping discharge has also been 

analysed. The lowest decreases in both variables are obtained for SE and SSE directions while 

the greatest reductions are associated to waves from E and ESE, showing the sensitivity to 

direction and domain effective geometry. Directions with larger reductions are those presenting 

higher wave heights and lengths. On the contrary, directions with the lowest decreases are 

those with the smallest wave heights and lengths. The Cala Canyelles port situation, within a 

bay, gives rise to diffraction and refraction processes that change the direction of waves, which 

arrive almost perpendicular to the port breakwater. For this type of geometry, future changes in 

wave directions due to climate would not significantly affect (by themselves) overtopping 

discharges via the directional sector. 

 

With respect to agitation our study suggests future increases due to changes in the frequency of 

wave directions which may enhance wave penetration within the harbour, unless the layout is 

modified. 

 

The placement of a vegetation patch in front of the port entrance would lead to a reduction of 

wave heights within the harbour. The plant canopy could compensate future increases of wave 



11 

energy inside the harbour. This means that submerged plants could be used as an effective 

protection system under future climates, beneficial for agitation and dike functionality, enhanced 

by the fact that close to the dike any increase of wave height due to the combination of incident 

and reflected waves would also be damped. 

 

The benefits of using a larger vegetation surface located at the same place are not conclusive, 

obtaining only slight additional reductions of port agitation. This means that an increase of 40% 

in the meadow surface only generates a marginal decrease of significant wave height. This is in 

agreement with Möller et al. (1999) and Manca et al. (2012) who stated that most of the height 

wave reduction occurred in the first few metres of a vegetation field. Therefore, the wave 

damping generated by vegetation meadows has a certain limit after which the benefits are 

minimal. An important practical implication of this is that seagrass to reduce incoming wave 

energy can be of limited extent, facilitating maintenance. 

 

The effects of SLR on wave heights outside the port cannot be estimated in general terms, 

since shoaling and refraction depend on water depth, wave period and port geometry, so at 

each case the response will be different either increasing or decreasing Hs. However, as pointed 

out by Sierra et al. (2017), greater water depths will lead to larger diffraction coefficients at the 

breakwater, so that waves arriving to the port mouth will penetrate more, generating larger port 

agitation. The combination of factors may result in positive (reducing agitation) or negative 

(increasing Hs within the port) differences, which should be studied on a case-by-case basis. 

The results presented here suggest that submerged vegetation could nevertheless contribute to 

reduce the potential negative impacts of SLR on port agitation. 

 

An additional benefit of green solutions, compared to the classical grey alternatives, is that they 

contribute to CO2 sequestration and have smaller environmental and visual impact. They are 

also of great ecological importance, contributing to maintain biodiversity since they can serve as 

important nursery grounds for numerous species of algae, fish and invertebrates both above 

and below the seabed (Koftis et al., 2013). They are also more flexible than rigid structural 

solutions, allowing changes in their layout to comply with future climate uncertainty. 

 

On the contrary, these meadows contribute to sedimentation by slowing down water motion and 

by reducing sediment suspension (Fonseca and Cahalan, 1992). This can lead to a reduction of 

the available depth for boats. In addition, seagrass may disturb navigation if the clearance 

above the plants is too small. 

 

Green solutions require a periodic evaluation of their performance. The limited experience of 

their behaviour and evolution over time adds a new layer of uncertainty, not only in the design, 

but also in the maintenance phase. In-situ and remote sensing monitoring can help to determine 

relevant indicators such as biota stress and growth rates and associated water quality. This 



12 

timely information can serve to redefine these interventions indicating whether further additional 

measures are required. Hence, “working with nature” demands long-term planning, including 

contingency plans in case that the expected results are not obtained. 
 

5. Conclusions 
 

This study is a first attempt to assess the benefits of vegetation patches for harbour adaptation 

to climate change. It has shown via numerical modelling that green solutions may diminish 

agitation and overtopping hazards for future and present conditions. The hydrodynamic 

behaviour of submerged meadows has been simulated with state-of-the-art parameterizations, 

evidencing that seagrass can produce significant wave attenuation, thus contributing to reduce 

the impacts due to climate change. 

 

In the case of Cala Canyelles port, a meadow has been placed in the offshore side of the main 

breakwater for attenuating waves and thus reducing overtopping. The obtained results indicate 

that the presence of seagrass reduces overtopping in all studied cases, but it would only 

compensate overtopping increases for moderate values of SLR (RCP 4.5 scenario) with a 

density of 100 stems/m2. The influence of SLR and meadow density on overtopping discharges 

needs to be further investigated, as a function of breakwater freeboard and port geometry. 

Moreover, the definition of the optimal surface required is an issue that demands an in-depth 

analysis. 

 

In the case of Cases d’Alcanar port, the obtained results show that placing seagrass meadows 

in front of the port mouth can significantly reduce port agitation, compensating the changes in 

wave direction due to climate change that could favour the penetration of waves within the port. 

Increasing the meadow area does not produce an improvement proportional to the surface 

extension. The influence of meadow layout and density in the reduction of port agitation is a 

topic that also needs further research. In addition, the effect of SLR on port agitation and how 

submerged vegetation can contribute to correct its potential negative effects is still a partially 

open question. 

 

Green interventions like submerged seagrass show a number of benefits, including 

performance, when compared to conventional harbour engineering. They can even compensate 

some of the negative effects of climate change. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this type of 

measures is limited, because they are only effective in attenuating waves when the ratio 

between stem height and water depth is within a certain range. The clear delimitation of 

application ranges and criteria under real field conditions will be required for a wide use of these 

natural solutions.
