Abstract: Twin propellers without a rudder were studied using a physical model with a fixed clearance distance and three different rotating
velocities. Experimental results were compared with results from theoretical expressions developed over the past 50 years for the efflux veloc-
ity, axial velocity, and maximum bed velocity. It was found that the efflux velocity equations overestimated the experimental results, whereas
the computed axial velocities matched the experimental data reasonably well. However, when maximum bed velocity expressions were com-
pared with experimental results, only one method was found to behave better; overestimation resulted if a quadratic superposition of single
jets was used. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WW.1943-5460.0000382. This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons

Introduction

The marine transportation industry and regular shipping lines
have been experiencing significant growth over the last 20 years.
The increments in the ships drafts and the power of engines dur-
ing the docking and undocking maneuvers can generate serious
problems in harbors. Currently, the present propulsion systems
have powerful engines that are closer to the toes of the docks,
causing severe problems for the stability of the docking plat-
forms. At the same time, the eroded sediment is deposited along
the inner harbor, thus reducing the water level and operative
zones for other maneuvering vessels.

The equations currently used to compute future erosion are
based both on theoretical equations with unrealistic hypotheses far
from reality and on experimental studies that use one propeller as
the propulsion system (Mujal-Colilles et al. 2016). The maximum
bed velocity is always expressed as a function of the efflux velocity,
which is defined in the literature as the velocity in the downstream
propeller plane; this velocity is used as the first parameter to analyze
the seabed erosion. However, the expressions for the efflux velocity
are based either on the mass continuity equation or on the momen-
tum balance equation, using experimental coefficients [e.g., Broglia
et al. (2013); Hamill (1988); Lam et al. (2012); Stewart (1992)].
Both expressions of the efflux velocity are only valid for single pro-
pellers, and the effects of two propellers are not included in them.

This paper deals with experimental values obtained for twin-
propeller vessels without rudders as the main propulsion system.

Experimental results are compared with results from theoretical
equations developed over the past 50 years.

Methodology

Experimental Setup

Physical experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Marine
Engineering (LIM) at UPC-BarcelonaTech. LaBassA (Fig. 1) is a
rectangular concrete tank measuring 12.5� 4.6� 2.5 m with three
lateral windows to monitor the phenomenon currently running
inside the tank. Experiments were performed using two propellers
with four blades, each with a diameter Dp of 25:4 cm, a pitch ratio
p0 of 0.94, and expanded area ratio b of 0.75. Propellers were
located at one end of LaBassA with a clearance distance from the
bottom of hp ¼ 26 cm (Fig. 2) and a water depth of 70 cm using
bollard pull conditions.

Three different rotating velocities (n = 300, 350, and 400 rpm)
were measured using five acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs)
hanging from an electronic moving reference system and located at
several positions to record the magnitude of the velocity decay
along the three axes. Table 1 shows the measuring points in the
three coordinates assuming that the origin of the reference axis is
located at the axis of symmetry at the bottom of LaBassA, as shown
in Figs. 1 and 2. A total of 220 points were measured along the three
dimensions of the flume.

Initial tests using ADVs located in particular areas of the tank
were performed to verify that the thrusters were far from the oppo-
site wall. Lateral walls were also considered to be far enough after
the results obtained with the initial tests (Fig. 2) showed that the
propeller jet was able to develop freely and resulted in minimum
influence on the convective cells created in the tank.

Fig. 2 plots the thruster system with the main distances used dur-
ing the setup of the experiments and the position of the origin of the
coordinate system. The rotating system was symmetric with the
right propeller, P1, rotating in a counterclockwise direction and
the left propeller, P2, rotating in a clockwise direction at the same
speed. Error in the rotational speed was on the order of 10%, with a
3% difference from one propeller to the other; the right thruster
rotated slightly faster than the left thruster. Table 2 shows the rela-
tive errors found between the theoretical input value of the rota-
tional speed and the real rotation of each propeller. These differen-
ces between the theoretical and real rotational speeds are important
in terms of the thrust force (a 10% error in rotational speed means

more than a 20% change in thrust force, and a 3% difference in rota-
tional speed between propellers is translated as a 6% of difference
in the thrust force), but they have a low influence on the results pre-
sented herein, as will be further discussed. However, errors have
been corrected for future experiments. Rotational speed values
were chosen using the upper limit of the structure with a security
factor as a reference value (�500 rpm). In an attempt to reproduce
real velocities downstream of the ship’s propellers, lower values of
the rotational speed were avoided.

Theoretical Aspects

The PIANC (2015) guidelines were used as the reference document
to compare the results of the physical model with those of the theo-
retical formulas given by several authors over the past 50 years [i.e.,

Bergh and Magnusson (1987); Fuehrer et al. (1987); Hamill and
Johnston (1993); Hamill et al. (2004); Hamill (1988); Johnston et
al. (2013); Stewart (1992)].

Efflux velocity is defined as the mean axial velocity at the outlet
of propeller systems without influence from the rudder, keel, and
wall. This velocity is defined for the initial zone of flow establish-
ment, normally delimited for x� 2.5Dp (Hamill 1987). Although the
influence of a second propeller may change this reference distance
or increment the mean velocity at a parallel plane located around 2.5
times the propeller diameter, the authors have considered this dis-
tance to allow for comparison of the experimental results of twin-
propeller models with those of the theoretical formulas.

Efflux velocity for single propellers based on the momentum
equation, Eq. (1), is a function with a dependent parameter called
the thrust coefficient, KT, which is usually given by the propeller
manufacturer.

The constant parameter, C, varies from 1.33 [e.g., Hamill and
Johnston (1993)] to 1.59 from the theoretical assumptions in the
momentum equation. Some other authors have developed experi-
mental studies to find empirical relations between the constant pa-
rameter and the pitch ratio, the projected area ratio, or the hub diam-
eter (Hamill andMcGarvey 1996; Stewart 1992).

However, the thrust coefficient is not always available, and a
second expression for the efflux velocity for single propellers can
also be used, as follows:

V0 ¼ 1:48

(2)

where fp = percentage of installed engine power, fp = 5–15%; PD =
maximum installed engine power (W); and rw = density of the
water.

As outlined previously, the expressions for the efflux velocity
are based on single propellers. In terms of the maximum bed veloc-
ity, which is a function of the efflux velocity, there is only one em-
pirical equation, proposed by Fuehrer et al. (1981), for seaborne
vessels with a twin propeller and a central rudder, as follows:

Vb;max ¼ 0:52V0
Dp
hp

� �0:275
0:9 <

hp
Dp

< 3 (3)

Again, Eq. (3) is based on the computation of the efflux velocity,
which is limited to a single propeller. Therefore, the effects of the
twin-propeller configuration are included in the constant
coefficient.

To provide other expressions to compute the maximum bed ve-
locity, the PIANC (2015) guidelines propose two methods to
account for the effects of a single propeller without a rudder: linear
superposition or quadratic superposition of the maximum bed ve-
locity induced by a single propeller. Linear superposition is more
realistic in terms of the induced maximum bed velocity, but because
the total impulse of the ship is not doubled, the linear superposition
is not physically correct.

Blokland and Smedes (1996) provided an equation for single
propellers that uses linear superposition to compute the maximum
bed velocity for twin propellers. This equation is restricted to a cer-
tain clearance-to-propeller separation ratio, as follows (Blokland
and Smedes 1996):

The quadratic superposition proposed by PIANC (2015) is

(5)

Eq. (5) is valid only when hp=ap < 0:5 and can be used for any
expression of the maximum bed velocity induced by a single
propeller.

The experimental expression for the maximum bed velocity
caused by a single propeller of Blaaw and van de Kaa (1978) [Eq.
(6)] and the expression proposed by Fuehrer et al. (1981) [Eq. (7)]
are computed for twin propellers without a rudder using the quad-
ratic superposition previously described in Eq. (5).

(7)

At the same time, to validate both of the previous equations, the
expressions for the axial velocity along the centerline of the

propeller used the former empirical relations for the maximum bed
velocities; the expressions for the axial velocity were developed by
the same authors.

Albertson et al. (1950) were the first authors to propose a func-
tion for the axial velocity along the propeller, which is based on ex-
perimental data as well, as follows:

Vaxis xð Þ ¼ AV0

� �a
(8)

where A = 6.17; and a = 1. Blaaw and van de Kaa (1978) and
Fuehrer et al. (1981) used the same expression as Eq. (8) with differ-
ent coefficients, which are detailed in Table 3. Both the Albertson et
al. (1950) and Blaaw and van de Kaa (1978) methods are used for
single propellers without a rudder. However, the expression pro-
posed by Fuehrer et al. (1981) can also be used for twin configura-
tions, according to PIANC (2015).

Experimental Results

Mean velocity distributions were analyzed for all three components
along the zone of established flow (x > 2:5Dp). To guarantee statis-
tically stationary data, previous experiments were run with ADVs
located at different points in the tank. Results yielded a total run
time of 1 h to reach the stationary state at each point of the propeller
flow (Mujal-Colilles et al. 2015). Therefore, to simplify the text
throughout the document, mean velocities will be referred to
directly as velocity, regardless of the component.

The first evolution of the propeller jet is described using planes
parallel to the plane containing the propellers, as shown in Fig. 3,
where the background variable is the axial component of the meas-
ured velocity. In the efflux plane (x = 2.5Dp), the two jets were
clearly visible, with no difference between the left and right propel-
lers, regardless of the 3% difference in rotational speed between
propellers described in the previous section; raw data are available
in Table S1. However, in the next plane (x = 5Dp), shown in Fig.
3(b), the two jets disappeared and merged into a single jet. It can
also be observed that the jet was directed toward the bottom of the
tank at some point between 2.5Dp and 5Dp, as shown in Figs.
3(a and b). The same evolution of the jet along the tank is shown in
Fig. 3, which confirms the small influence of the opposite wall in
the evolution of the jet because the jet was no longer present at a dis-
tance 15Dp [Fig. 3(d)], which is almost one-third of the total length
of the tank. Therefore, the propeller jet was considered to be negli-
gible at a distance larger than 15Dp (�4 m). However, the convec-
tive cells generated at the flume could have affected the lateral evo-
lution of the jet. The black dashed line in Fig. 3(a) is the boundary
between the positive and negative axial velocity, thus plotting the
returning flow. The progression of the contour plots in Fig. 3 shows
that the presence of the lateral walls did not affect the growth in the
transverse direction of the flow because the jet increased in width,
and the returning flow was located beyond y=Dpj > 3:

�� Thus, the
experimental values demonstrate the low influence of the lateral
walls on the evolution of the jet.

The vertical velocities plotted in Fig. 4 are one order of magni-
tude lower than the axial velocities, but these contour plots give im-
portant information; see the point data in Table S1. As expected,
absolute values of the vertical velocities close to the bottom
decreased as the distance from the helices increased. That is, at
2.5Dp, velocities close to the bottom were lower than those at
−5 cm/s, whereas at 7.5Dp, velocities were approximately −1 cm/s;
they were almost zero at 15Dp. The influence of the jet was still visi-
ble for vertical velocities at 15Dp because the location of the two
helices coincided with the zone of higher vertical velocities
(�1 cm=s), but with very low absolute values of velocity. The
results in Fig. 4(a) are consistent with the expected values because
the rotation of the propellers was still present in this plane.
However, further from the propellers’ plane, rotational effects dissi-
pated, and when the jet axis reached the bed of the tank [Fig. 4(b)],
maximum bed velocities were lower than those in the previous
plane. However, the presence of the twin propellers was still visible
with the vertical velocities [Figs. 4(b–d)], although the axial veloc-
ities showed the opposite. This indicates that the two separate
jets were directed toward the bed of the tank at the same angle,
maintaining the twin-jet composition in the lower-magnitude
components.

The three components of bed velocities recorded with ADVs are
shown in Fig. 5, which plots the axialUx, transverseUy, and vertical
Uz components of the velocity. Unlike Figs. 3 and 4, Fig. 5 plots the
planes perpendicular to the propellers’ plane (i.e., the planes parallel
to the bed of the tank). Axial velocities are the velocity components
used to compute the Shields parameter to determine whether there
will be erosion or not. In the present case, axial velocities at the

bottom were found to increase with the speed of revolution, as
expected, but the point with larger maximum axial velocities moved
further from the propeller plane [from Figs. 5(a–c)]. This point coin-
cided with the zone of the jet impact on the boundary, which,
according to Johnston et al. (2013), occurs at a distance between 5
and 6Dp; this is confirmed in Fig. 5. At the same time, the transverse
velocities, which are shown in Figs. 5(d–f), were of the same order
of magnitude as the axial velocities, meaning that the jet spread in
the x-direction at the same growth rate as it increased in diameter.
This comparison indicates that the opening angle of the jet flow
might not be on the order of 10–158 (Hamill 1988) but almost dou-
ble that amount. Moreover, the transverse velocities [Figs. 5(d–f)]
confirm that the center of both jets could merge, but the influence of
the twin propellers was maintained along the tank. However, the
influence of the vertical velocities [Figs. 5(g–i)] did not increase
significantly with the speed of revolution; they decreased abruptly
after 7.5Dp in all of the cases.

Discussion

To compare the results of the present study with those of formulas
from the literature, the efflux velocity was obtained from the maxi-
mum velocity in the plane x = 2.5Dp (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 4,
the theoretical results obtained with both Eqs. (1) and (2) were
approximately 2 times the efflux velocity yielded by the experi-
ments. Eq. (1) was computed with the assumption of a thrust coeffi-
cient of 0.35, obtained from Bernitsas et al. (1981), and an experi-
mental coefficient ofC = 1.33 as proposed by Hamill (1987). Power

values of Eq. (2) were measured in situ in the laboratory and yielded
final values of Eq. (2) similar to the results from Eq. (1).

Table 4 shows that the experimental results were not substan-
tially different between scenarios. However, the scenario with a
speed of 350 rpm had a higher efflux velocity value than the sce-
nario with a speed of 400 rpm. This may be attributable to the

location of the efflux velocity plane. The efflux velocity plane is
located beyond 2.5Dp (Felli et al. 2011), so if the efflux velocity is
measured at 3Dp, this error should disappear. For instance, in the
plane x = 5Dp, higher values of velocity correspond to higher values
of revolution, as shown in Fig. 6; this indicates that for twin propel-
lers, the flowwas not totally established at 2.5Dp.

In Fig. 6, the three scenarios reveal that the axial velocity at
the zone between the propellers [Fig. 6(a)] was higher than the
axial velocity at the center of the propeller [Fig. 6(b)]. This is at-
tributable to the cumulative effect of each propeller given the
small distance between the propellers in the present experiment.
It is expected that a configuration with a larger separation
between propellers should not produce this effect. In this section,
axial velocities at the center of symmetry will be used to compare
the experimental values with the theoretical expressions proposed
in the previous section.

Fig. 6(a) shows that the axial velocity at the axis of symmetry for
the case of n = 350 rpmwas slightly larger than the axial the velocity
for n = 400 rpm. Fig. 6(b) shows that larger velocity values at x =
2.5Dp were obtained for the scenarios with low-speed velocity. The
first result combined with the second indicates that the small differ-
ences in the rotational velocities of the propellers created a nonsym-
metric flux for which the axis of symmetry between the propellers
might not have been the point with higher values. However, it is im-
portant to point out that small errors in velocity will be corrected in
the future to avoid these problems.

The axial velocities along the x-axis are plotted in Fig. 7, and a
comparison of the experimental results (black line) with the theoret-
ical results detailed in Eq. (8) and Table 3 reveals that all of the the-
oretical expressions overestimated the axial velocity. The axial ve-
locity shown in Fig. 7 was located at the axis of symmetry of
LaBassA and the middle point between both propellers. If axial ve-
locity located along the x-axis at the center of the propellers had
been used, this overestimation would be even larger, as shown in
Fig. 6. In any case, it seems that the method proposed by Blaaw and
van de Kaa (1978) is the only method that was found to fit the exper-
imental data with reasonably accurate results, regardless of the low
estimation.

Finally, the maximum bed velocities obtained in the experimen-
tal results were also compared with the results of the theoretical
expressions. It is important to recall that the theoretical expressions
used herein considered the action of twin propellers. Fuehrer et al.

(1981) developed an equation for seaborne vessels with twin pro-
pellers and twin rudders, although the rudder angle is not an inde-
pendent variable in the function [see Eq. (3)]. The Blokland and
Smedes (1996) method is used for twin propellers considering a lin-
ear superposition of two single propellers. According to PIANC
(2015) guidelines, with linear superposition, the total impulse
increases, which is not consistent with reality; however, if quadratic
superposition is used (PIANC 2015), the total impulse of the jet
remains constant, but velocities are underestimated when both jets
start to merge. Several authors suggest the use of quadratic superpo-
sition for single-propeller maximum bed velocity (Blaaw and van
de Kaa 1978; Fuehrer et al. 1981) because the maximum velocity at
the bed for a single propeller is computed using each method in Eqs.
(6) and (7), respectively.

Maximum bed velocities are shown in Fig. 8; in this case, the
Fuehrer et al. (1981) method was found to more accurately predict
the maximum bed velocities. In contrast to the theory described
in the PIANC (2015) guidelines, the quadratic approximation using
the Fuehrer et al. (1981) method overestimated the maximum bed
velocity. Both superpositions of the jets using the formulas of
Blokland and Smedes (1996) and Blaaw and van de Kaa (1978)
clearly underpredicted the experimental results.

The results shown in Fig. 8 are consistent with the results
obtained for the axial velocities because the Fuehrer et al. (1981)
method always gives larger values than the Blaaw and van de Kaa
(1978) method. However, the overestimation detected for the axial
velocities was not as large as the overestimation found for the maxi-
mum bed velocities, indicating that the relation between axial and
maximum bed velocities should be further investigated for twin pro-
pellers. In fact, the best method to approximate maximum bed
velocities, the Fuehrer et al. (1981) method, clearly overpredicted
the axial velocity, whereas themaximum bed velocity formulas pro-
posed by Blaaw and van de Kaa (1978) were found to be best at fit-
ting the axial velocity but underestimated the maximum bed
velocity.

Conclusions

An accurate description of jet hydrodynamics is needed to esti-
mate the forces acting on quay structures and harbor basin beds.
Likewise, an understanding of the relation between these forces
and variables as controlled by the maneuvering of vessels (e.g.,
power propeller, clearance distance, rudder angle, pitch ratio)
can help with the maintenance of harbor structures and their
management.

The contribution of this research consists of the application of
formulas available in the literature to an experimental study using
twin propellers without a rudder, with a fixed clearance distance
and separation between propellers. Most of the expressions pub-
lished in the literature are used by structural and design engineers;
they have been developed for single propellers and are extrapolated
to the case of twin propellers without the support of experimental
research.

Experimental results compared with the theoretical work pub-
lished so far indicate that the efflux velocities obtained during
experiments were clearly lower than those predicted by the theoreti-
cal results. At the same time, the formulas proposed in the literature
to obtain axial velocities were found to overpredict the experimental
results. The best equation to predict axial velocities for twin propel-
lers was determined to be the method proposed by Blaaw and van
de Kaa (1978), although this method clearly underpredicted the
maximum bed velocity. However, the formula of Fuehrer et al.
(1981), particularly developed for twin propellers, was able to

match the bed velocity experimental results described in this
research reasonably well.

In the present experiments, viscosity did not influence the differ-
ence between the theoretical and experimental values because all
scenarios took place in a highly turbulent regime.

Supplementary data are provided in Table S1 to facilitate com-
parison with the real results and to provide information to be used
for future benchmarks; these data are available to any interested
researcher.
