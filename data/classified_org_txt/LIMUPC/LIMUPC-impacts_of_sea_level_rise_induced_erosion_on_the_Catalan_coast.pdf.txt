Abstract 

The Catalan coast as most of the developed Mediterranean coastal zone is characterized by 
the coincidence of stresses and pressures on the natural system with a high exposure and low 
adaptive capacity. Due to this, Climate Change-induced effects will increase natural hazards 
and aggravate their associated impacts and, in consequence, it is necessary to assess their 
effects for proper long-term management. In this work, we assess the impact of sea-level rise 
(SLR) induced shoreline retreat on the Catalan coast for three scenarios ranging from 0.53 m 
to 1.75 m by the year 2100. Implications are analyzed in terms of affectation of two main 
functions provided by beaches, i.e. recreation and protection. Obtained results show that CC 
will be a serious threat to analyzed functions since the expected enhanced shoreline retreat 
will severely decrease the recreational carrying capacity and, the capacity of protection in the 
near future under tested scenarios. The actual level of development along the coastal zone 
reduces the natural resilient capacity of beaches to SLR in such a way that, the lack of 
accommodation space can be identified as a main factor for the estimated impacts.

1 Introduction 

 

Coastal zones are some of the most productive areas on Earth, attracting and concentrating 

human population. From an anthropocentric standpoint, they provide land for housing and 

infrastructure development; goods and services for developing human (economic) activities 

and ecosystem services providing tangible and intangible benefits for human development 

(UNEP, 2006). Accordingly, one of the main characteristics of this area is its high 

susceptibility to change/damage due to the accumulation of human-induced pressures (e.g. 

Steffen et al. 2007; Newton et al. 2012). Thus, Newton et al. (2012) identified a number of 

impacts associated with coastal utilization and development such as erosion, reduced 

freshwater flow, habitats destruction and urban development. Within this context, coastal 

hotspots can be defined as regions largely affected by the combined presence of natural 

hazards and human vulnerability. The Mediterranean Sea represents a good example of such a 

regional hotspot comprising numerous locations where these impacts are concentrated (UNEP 

2009).  

 In addition, it is likely that climate change (CC) induced hazards will increase the 

forcing on coastal hotspots and, as a direct consequence, will intensify their impacts on the 

coastal system, becoming a major additional driver of changes in coastal land use (Hadley, 

2009). Hence, coastal management needs to consider these new conditions to properly 

minimize the associated impacts, and to optimize the use of the coastal zone while protecting 

natural values. The interest in assessing potential implications of climate change on the 

Mediterranean coasts has driven numerous research at different scales and approaches such as 

at the basin level (e.g. Nicholls and Hoozemans, 1996; Jeftic et al. 1996), at the regional scale 

(e.g. Snoussi et al. 2008; Torresan et al. 2012; Sierra et al. 2016), at local scale (e.g. Sánchez-



2 
 

Arcilla et al. 2011) and at the geomorphic unit scale (e.g. Sánchez-Arcilla et al 2008; El-

Nahry and Doluschitz 2010).  

 Among the different climate change drivers, storminess and sea level rise (SLR) are 

the most relevant from the coastal hazard perspective since they should originate and/or 

intensify the most important ones, i.e. erosion and inundation. Regarding storminess, most of 

existing projections of surge and wave height in the Mediterranean have found that they are 

not likely to increase during the 21st century (Lionello et al., 2008; Conte and Lionello, 

2013). However, the uncertainty about projections of extreme wave events is relatively large 

since the use of different atmospheric models can result in different wave fields (Planton et al. 

2012). This variation in wave projections was also detected by Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013) 

in the study area by using different combinations of Regional and Global Circulation Models.  

 Due to this, in this work we just focus on the potential impacts of SLR on coastal 

hazards. SLR impacts on coastal zones are well known (e.g. Nicholls and Cazenave 2010) 

with inundation and accelerated erosion being the two most important ones affecting coastal 

stability.  

Inundation is usually considered as an immediate hazard in which coastal areas at an 

altitude lower than the new (rise) water level and hydraulically connected to the shoreline will 

be subjected to submergence. In most of the cases, its assessment implicitly assumes no 

coastal adjustment to the new mean water level. In sedimentary coasts, and at the long-term 

perspective, shoreline should adjust to new conditions in such a way that, in the absence of 

any compensatory mechanism, a rise in the mean sea level will result in the retreat of 

unprotected coastlines (e.g. Nicholls and Cazenave 2010). In spite of this, most of the existing 

impact studies focus on inundation (e.g. Titus and Richman 2001; Li et al. 2009), with few 

cases specifically dealing with induced erosion (e.g. Hinkel et al. 2013). Due to this and 

taking into account the importance of sedimentary coasts for the socio-economic development 



3 
 

of the Mediterranean countries in general and, Spain in particular, this work focusses on the 

evaluation of the SLR-induced erosion effects.    

Thus, the main aim of this work is to assess the impact of sea-level rise induced 

shoreline retreat on a Mediterranean coastal hotspot. This will permit to assess how ongoing 

processes and hazards are accelerated or aggravated as well as to assess their implications for 

future coastal management. This will be done at a regional scale by analysing the case of the 

Catalan coast which is used as an example of the Mediterranean developed coasts.  

From the perspective of management, it is specially important to assess how a given 

climate forcing propagates through the coastal system via direct and indirect impacts. In this 

sense, Figure 1 shows a representation of the impact chain for SLR-induced erosion in the 

Catalan coast, where the main expected impacts are identified. 

Since the objective of the analysis is to contribute to coastal management through 

hazard and impact assessment, this study has focused on SLR scenarios covering the range 

provided by the IPCC AR5 (Church et al. 2013) as well as one high-end scenario. This last 

scenario has been selected from the high risk-management perspective which as Hinkel et al 

(2015) clearly pointed out can be tackled by defining an upper bound such as a worst-case 

scenario.      

 

 

2 Study area and Methods   

 

2.1 Study area 

 

The Catalan coast is located in the NE Spanish Mediterranean (Figure 2). It has about 600 km 

long coastline, with about 270 km of beaches. It has a wide variety of temperate coastal 



4 
 

systems comprising considerable geo- and biodiversity which is represented in cliffs, rocky 

coasts, sandy beaches, coastal plains, estuaries, and river deltas.  

 Figure 2 shows the study area divided into 12 administrative units (comarcas) that 

concentrate in just 22.8% of the surface, the 61.9 % of the population of Catalonia (4.68 

million people in 2013, IDESCAT 2014) and the 64.9% of the Catalan Gross Domestic 

Product (GDP). Current socioeconomic activities reflects the typical conditions of 

Mediterranean coastal areas and are based on activities such as tourism, commerce, 

agriculture, and, until recent dates, residential developments (e.g. Sardá et al 2005). The 

spatial distribution of main socioeconomic (GDP, population and tourist accommodation 

offer) and environmental (surface of protected areas of natural interest) indicators along the 

coast is shown in Fig 2 (see further details in Brenner et al (2006).  

 The hotspot condition of the Catalan coast arises from the combination of natural and 

societal factors and, it corresponds to situations in which pressures on the natural system 

coincide with a high exposure and low adaptive capacity: 

 Most of its population is concentrated in the coastal zone. The average population 

density in coastal municipalities is 1,518 people/km2, whereas the mean value for 

Catalonia is 232 people/km2.     

 Tourism is one of the main economic activities providing 11.1 % of the Catalan GDP 

(Duro and Rodriguez, 2011). Coastal tourism is the major contributor with coastal 

destinies comprising 62,9 % of tourism overnights.  

 Coastal ecosystem services when translated into economic values represent a 

quantifiable and substantial contribution to wellbeing of coastal communities. In market 

price terms, they provide the equivalent of each family receiving an additional 4.3 % in 

available income every year (Brenner et al 2010). 

 It contains 4 important low-lying areas with the Ebro delta being the largest one. 



5 
 

 It is an eroding coast with about 70 % of beaches retreating during the last decades at a 

mean rate of about -0.7 m/year (CIIRC 2010). 

 Coastal damage has significantly increased during the last 50 years in spite of the 

absence of an increasing trend in storm-induced hazards (Jiménez et al 2012).  

 

2.2 Shoreline retreat 

 

It is widely accepted that in the absence of any compensatory mechanism, a rise in the mean 

sea level will result in the retreat of unprotected coastlines (Nicholls and Cazenave, 2010). 

Although the total coastal response at the local scale will depend on the total sediment budget 

(e.g. Stive 2004; Cowell et al. 2006), the most common way to assess SLR-induced coastal 

retreat is the so-called Bruun rule (e.g. Le Cozannet et al. 2014). Bruun (1962) suggests that 

under a scenario of rising sea levels, the beach profile will respond by maintaining constant its 

relative position and shape with respect to the new mean sea level. 

 Recent reviews about the validity of this model suggest that it can be suitable for 

qualitative regional scale assessments, but not recommended for local scale assessments 

where high quantitative accuracy be required except in the case of absence of littoral transport 

gradients and presence of sediment sources/sinks (e.g. Stive et al 2009). Cooper and Pilkey 

(2004) concluded that the assumptions to be satisfied for applying this model are very 

restrictive and, in consequence it should only likely to be applicable on a small number of 

coasts. Ranasinghe et al (2012) proposed a probabilistic model based on governing physical 

processes to estimate coastal erosion (PCR) due to SLR. However, these authors explicitly 

stated that "several simplifying assumptions in the model need to be rigorously evaluated" and 

some elements of the model need to be defined using empirical evidence that are often absent 

(e.g. coast recovery processes).  



6 
 

 In the absence of a general accepted morphological model, we assume that the order of 

magnitude of regional-scale SLR-induced response on sedimentary coasts can be estimated 

using the Bruun model. The model predicts a landwards and upwards movement of the 

profile, which results in a shoreline retreat, ΔX, given by  

 

 act
*

S / MWL
)d+(B

L
 MWL =X   (1) 

 

where ΔMWL is the sea level rise, B is the berm/dune height of the active beach, d* is the 

active or closure depth (maximum depth where significant profile changes are observed), L is 

the across-shore distance from B to d* and Sact is the averaged inner shelf slope where beach 

profile changes. To reduce the uncertainty in the selection of the closure depth in the study 

area (see discussion in Ranasinghe and Stive, 2009), instead of selecting a specific depth, we 

have used characteristic values of the inner shelf slope, calculated from the shoreline to 10 m 

depth for different locations along the Catalan coast.  

Retreat and beach rebuilding due to SLR will only be possible if accommodation 

space is available: is there sufficient hinterland behind the shoreline where the beach could 

migrate. If not, the beach will be eroded and will progressively decline and ultimately 

disappear. One of the problems of the Catalan coast, as with most of the Mediterranean 

coastline, is that it is heavily urbanized and, in consequence, most of beaches are backed by 

fixed infrastructures such as promenades and transport links or other rigid boundaries limiting 

the accommodation space.  

It has to be stressed that the required accommodation space is a relative concept. It is 

related to the expected magnitude of the shoreline retreat, and it can be defined as the required 

space to permit the rebuilding of a given beach width at a given time horizon under a given 

shoreline rate of displacement.  



7 
 

 

The effect of the existing accommodation space is locally assessed by taking into 

account the expected shoreline retreat under a given SLR scenario and the actual beach width 

(distance from the shoreline to existing barrier in the hinterland). When the accommodation 

space is smaller than the expected shoreline retreat at a given time, the beach will disappear.   

 

2.3 Impact on beach functions 

 

To calculate the impact of the decrease in available beach width resulting from 

enhanced erosion to beach functions, we define here the called optimum and failure beach 

states. The optimum state is given by beach width equal or larger than the required one to 

properly provide the considered function whereas the failure state corresponds to a beach 

significantly narrower than the required one. Once these two limits are defined for each 

function, beaches are classified in three categories according to their projected width at a 

given time horizon: optimum, medium and low (see table 1).  

For recreation, the optimum beach width has been selected in the range 35 m - 40 m 

which is a representative value for Spanish Mediterranean beaches (Valdemoro and Jiménez 

2006). This value corresponds to the usual size of the resting and active zones occupied by 

beachgoers. Low quality beaches are given by a configuration that, under a given tourist flow, 

results in an excessive users' density (see table 1). 

For protection, the optimum beach has to be wide enough to dissipate the energy 

supplied by a storm of a given return period, Tr, (Bosom and Jiménez, 2011; Jiménez et al 

2011). The Tr value to be considered depends on the importance of values at exposure to be 

protected. Taking into account the characteristics of the Catalan coast we have defined 

optimum beaches as those wider than the expected cumulative storm-induced erosion 



8 
 

associated to return periods of 50 and 25 years. Low quality beaches are those narrower than 

the storm-induced erosion associated to a relatively frequent event (Tr = 25 years). Values 

associated with these probabilities are site-specific because they depend on local wave and 

beach characteristics. In this work, we have obtained a representative regional value by 

averaging storm-induced erosion climates obtained for different areas along the Catalan coast 

(see Table 1).   

 

 

2.4 Sea-level rise 

 

Present sea level trends in the Mediterranean basin have been estimated by Marcos 

and Tsimplis (2008) by analysing available tide-gauge records longer than 35 years, although 

as these authors stressed, existing data are biased towards the North coast. They calculated for 

the longest records in the Mediterranean a sea level trend between 1.2 mm yr-1 and 1.5 mm yr-

1. The only station where a larger trend was observed was Venice with a rate of 2.5 mm yr-1 

which was influenced by subsidence. Gomis et al (2012) reported that mean sea level in the 

Mediterranean has been rising at a rate of 0.6±0.1 mm yr-1 during the period 1948-2000, 

which is much lower than global mean sea level during the period 1971-2010 (between 1.7 

and 2.3 mm yr-1, Church et al. 2013).  

 Regarding the Catalan coast, there is no sea level time series long enough to make a 

reliable analysis. In spite of this, Marcos and Tsimplis (2008) analysed a sea level 13 years long 

time series in the Barcelona Harbour and obtained a sea level trend of 1.7 ± 1.5 mm yr-1. To 

illustrate the potential variability of sea level changes in the basin, these authors estimated for 

locations northwards (Marseille) and southwards (Alicante) of the study area a trend of 1.2 ± 0.1 

mm yr-1 and -0.3 ± 0.2 mm yr-1 respectively. 



9 
 

In spite of the before mentioned uncertainties, it should be useful and necessary for 

future planning of Mediterranean coasts to have a first estimation of the expected range of 

impacts induced by climatic-driven SLR. Taking into account that the main objective is to 

help in the process of coastal risk management, this study considers SLR scenarios covering 

the range provided by the IPCC AR5 and one extreme scenario. These are given by the best 

guess (50% probability) scenarios for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from AR5 (Church et al. 2013) 

and by a high-end scenario (see Figure 3). This last scenario was taken from the ones 

generated by Jevrejeva et al. (2014) and it is given by the projection of sea level at 95% 

probability of the Upper limit scenario using the RCP8.5 steric component (see Jevrejeva et 

al. 2014 for details). They are given by the year 2100 relative to 2000 by 0.53 m, 0.74 m and 

1.75 m respectively.  

In addition to these values, local contributions to SLR such as subsidence need to be 

also considered. With respect to this, areas with the largest susceptibility to subsidence along 

the Catalan coast are formed by the recent sediment deposits in deltas and low-lying areas 

(Copons, 2008). Unfortunately, there is a lack of systematic measurements of subsidence rates 

along the Catalan coast with most existing values corresponding to inferred Quaternary 

subsidence rates (e.g. Liquete et al. 2008; Vacchi et al. 2016). For the most important area 

subjected to subsidence, the Ebro delta, reported values differ since they have been obtained 

by different means, many times without accuracy enough to properly bound their associated 

uncertainty (Alvarado-Aguilar et al. 2012). Reported values go from 1.75 mm yr-1 (Somoza et 

al. 1998) during the Holocene up to larger values derived for current conditions with a 

representative average subsidence rate of 3 mm yr-1 (Ibañez et al. 1997; Jiménez et al. 1997). 

For the Llobregat delta plain, Duro et al (2004) reported average present-day values of 

1.25 mm yr-1 reaching a maximum of 6 mm yr-1 in the presence of soft sediment rich in pore 



10 
 

water and organic matter (see also Liquete et al 2008). Gamez et al (2009) characterized the 

Llobregat delta continental shelf as highly subsidence area (see also Vacchi et al 2016). 

  

 

3. Results 

 

3.1 Shoreline retreat 

  

SLR-induced coastline retreat will only affect geomorphic active (sedimentary) shorelines, 

with passive or rocky coasts being unable to respond to such forcing. Thus, about 52% of the 

Catalonian coastline will not be affected by SLR-induced erosion because it is composed by 

rocky and cliff (43%) and human built (9%) environments. The distribution of the passive 

coastline is directly controlled by the existing geomorphology along the Catalan coastal zone, 

with the largest percentage (67%) being located at the Northernmost area (Costa Brava), a 

highly indented coast dominated by cliffs and bay and pocket beaches. The composition of 

the passive (rigid) part of the Catalan coast is clearly dominated (about 83%) by the natural 

component (cliff and rocky coasts), with the exception of Maresme (coast northwards of 

Barcelona) where the rigid coastline is essentially human-built (revetment protecting the 

coastal railway and other coastal protection structures). 

Calculated retreats along the 21st century for the different sectors of the Catalan 

sedimentary coast under each SLR scenario are shown in Figure 3. They are bounded by 

values obtained in two areas which significantly depart from the average behaviour. On the 

one hand, the Ebro delta behaves as an erosional hotspot because, due to its very mild 

shoreface slope, SLR-induced shoreline retreat is between 2 and 3 times the obtained for the 

rest of the coast. Moreover, this site is also affected by subsidence which will increase the 



11 
 

expected erosion. On the other hand, the Tordera delta behaves as the less sensitive area due 

to its very steep slope in such a way that expected shoreline retreat will be very low. Since 

this behaviour is essentially controlled by the shoreface morphology, it is reproduced for all 

tested SLR scenarios.   

For RCP scenarios, the average SLR-induced shoreline retreat for the most 

representative part of the Catalan coast (excluding the two previously mentioned sectors) is 

almost equal at 2050 (20 m and 22 m for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively). However, due to 

the acceleration in SLR predicted for RCP8.5, the difference between expected shoreline 

retreats significantly increases at 2100 (47 m and 65 m for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively).  

Calculated shoreline retreats under the high-end scenario are about 2 times higher than 

those associated to RCP scenarios at 2050, increasing up to 3 times at 2100. Averaged values 

(excluding the two extreme sectors) are 41 m and 153 m at 2050 and 2100 respectively.  

 Applying Equation (1), the additional shoreline retreats induced by subsidence at 2100 

are 14 m and 63 m for the Llobregat delta and Ebro delta, respectively. These values should 

be added to the estimates shown in Fig 3 to obtain the total shoreline retreat for 2100 due to 

relative sea level rise (RSLR). 

At present, only the 24% of the Catalan coastal is backed by a hinterland providing 

some accommodation space to permit the dynamic adaptation of beaches to SLR. Figure 4 

shows the length of existing beaches along the Catalan coast under tested SLR scenarios with 

and without accounting for the existence of available space for beach accommodation. For 

relatively low SLR scenarios and/or short time horizons the relevance of the existence of 

accommodation space is relatively low. Under these conditions, the induced shoreline retreat 

is low and, only narrow and very narrow beaches should be fully eroded due to SLR. Since 

beaches backed by a hinterland providing accommodation space are usually wide (they are in 

pristine or low developed environments), its effective contribution to beach survival under 



12 
 

low retreats will be low. For high SLR scenarios and long-time horizons (2100), the current 

existing accommodation space along the coast significantly increases the beach survival. 

Thus, the beach survival at 2100, measured in terms of the length of existing beaches, 

increases in 93 km, 57 km and 39 km for the High-end, RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios 

respectively. 

In any case, it has to be stressed that we are accounting for the role of the current 

available accommodation space which has declined during the last decades due to the increase 

in urban development along the Catalan coastal zone. Without this human induced effect, the 

sedimentary coastline should be able to naturally adapt to this climate change induced hazard.           

The presented survival rates have been calculated by comparing beach widths at 

present with the SLR-induced retreat calculated for given time horizons. They can be 

considered as optimistic estimations because they represent existing beaches wide enough to 

permit the expected shoreline retreat under the different CC scenarios. Since, the dominant 

behaviour of Catalan beaches during the last decades is erosive with an average shoreline 

retreat rate of about 0.7 m yr-1 (CIIRC, 2010), it is expected that the role of the 

accommodation space will be much more important and relevant at shorter time horizons.  

 

3.2. Impacts on coastal functions 

 

To assess the expected impact of SLR-induced erosion and, in consequence, management 

implications, we have to estimate how CC is conditioning the functions being provided by the 

coast (see Fig 1). In what follows, these management implications are discussed for the 

Catalan coast grouped in two main values: recreation and protection. 

 

3.2.1 Recreation 



13 
 

 

One of the potential impacts of climate change on coastal areas is the change in tourism 

demand due to the high relevance of climatic factors (e.g. Hamilton et al. 2005; Amelung and 

Viner 2006). Recently, Bujosa and Roselló (2013) analysed the effects of climate change 

(increase in temperature) on the behaviour of Spanish domestic coastal tourism. They found 

that although it was not possible to confirm a decrease in tourism on the Spanish 

Mediterranean coast under the tested climate scenarios, new competitors will emerge on the 

Northern Spanish coast, which could change the actual distribution of domestic coastal 

summer trips. However, Moreno and Amelung (2009) have concluded that although non-

Mediterranean coasts will likely benefit from climate change, the expected impacts of climate 

change on Mediterranean beach tourist comfort may be less severe than anticipated. In fact, 

they recommended to put attention on other climate change induced impacts such as sea-level 

rise and/or water availability as the key factors potentially affecting beach tourism. 

 With respect to the climate-induced hazard analysed here, the decrease in available 

beach width resulting from enhanced erosion is of most concern for beach recreation. Under a 

steady tourist flow, the decrease in available beach surface will produce an increase in users' 

density and, thus, a decrease in comfortability. When this process extends in time, users' 

density will approach the saturation level where the beach should eventually collapse from the 

recreational standpoint and visitors would migrate to an alternative destiny supplying required 

conditions.  

Figure 5 shows the percentage of beaches classified in terms of their suitability to 

support recreational use for different time horizons and SLR scenarios. At 2050, just 

considering the SLR-induced shoreline retreat, the length of optimum beaches will decline 

from a present value of about 65% to about 45% for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. At 

this time, differences between both scenarios are not significant due to the time evolution of 



14 
 

SLR. During the first half of the century they are quite similar whereas SLR under RCP8.5 

significantly increases with respect to RCP4.5 during the second half (see Figure 3). Under 

the High-end scenario, only about 25 % of the sedimentary coast will be wide enough to 

provide optimum conditions for recreation. On the other hand, the coastal length with low 

recreational capacity beaches will significantly increase from around 12% in present 

conditions. To properly estimate this decrease in the recreational capacity we jointly consider 

very narrow beaches and those that will be fully eroded. The percentage of beaches falling in 

these two groups ranges from about 34% under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios to 61% 

under the High-end one. Observed differences between different scenarios are mainly 

reflected in the % of disappearing beaches.  

 When the analysis is extended to 2100, a dramatic decrease of the capacity of beaches 

to provide optimum recreational capacity is observed (Figure 5). Thus, only between 22% and 

12% of the sedimentary coast will fall in this category under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios 

respectively. Under the High-end scenario, nearly all beaches falling in optimum and medium 

recreational capacity conditions will disappear.  

Previous figures have been calculated by assuming non-accommodation space 

conditions and, they should represent the worst scenario in terms of expected impact. In fact, 

most of Catalan beaches supporting an intense recreational use are characterized by the 

presence of infrastructures at their back (e.g. Valdemoro and Jiménez, 2006).  

In spite of this, if we do the analysis taking into account the effect of the available 

accommodation space along the coast, the distribution of beaches in terms of their 

recreational capacity will change (Figure 5). Thus, main observed effects are the decrease in 

the percentage of beaches that will disappear and, the increase in the abundance of optimum 

beaches due to the beach rebuilding by wave action in the available space in the hinterland as 

shoreline retreats. As it is expected, these effects will be more important as larger the induced 



15 
 

shoreline retreat will be, i.e. under high SLR rates and long-time horizons (Figure 5). 

Although these results indicate a larger resilience of beaches to SLR, it has to be considered 

that areas with accommodation space are usually not important from the recreational use 

standpoint (at present) since they are generally located in natural areas.  

 

3.2.2 Protection 

 

As it was previously mentioned, protection refers to the function provided by the beach to 

protect the hinterland from wave action during storms and, it is supported by  dissipating the 

energy supplied by a storm of a given return period.  

 As no increase in storminess has been considered, the decrease in available beach 

width resulting from climate change-induced enhanced erosion should be the most impacting 

potential harm affecting the protection function. Figure 6 shows the percentage of beaches 

falling in each category of protection capacity to storm-induced erosion for different time 

horizons and SLR scenarios. The pattern of variation is similar to that obtained for recreation 

since width intervals to classify beaches are of similar magnitude (see table 1). Under current 

conditions, about the 7.5% of the total beach length along the Catalan coast fall into the low 

protection capacity, with about the 75% presenting optimum conditions. At 2050, the effect of 

SLR-induced shoreline retreat declines the length of optimum capacity beaches to about 55% 

and 50% under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively. Under the High-end scenario, 

only the 29% of the sedimentary coast will be wide enough to provide optimum conditions for 

protection. 

At 2100 the expected coastline length with an optimum beach configuration to provide 

enough protection to the hinterland are about 22% and 12% under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 

scenarios respectively and, only the 0.14% under the High-end scenario. The situation 



16 
 

regarding protection will be critical at this time horizon since the percentage of coast with 

fully eroded beaches and, in consequence, with a full exposure of the hinterland, will be about 

47%, 68% and 99% for RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and High-end scenarios respectively. 

 As in the case of recreation, when the effects of the existence of accommodation space 

are accounted for, a decrease in the percentage of beaches failing to provide protection (low 

category and fully eroded decreases), especially for High-end scenario and long time 

horizons. In spite of this, areas with accommodation space do not usually have significant 

values at exposure nor infrastructures and, in consequence, the apparent increase in the 

protection provided at regional scale it is not very relevant since these areas are mostly non-

developed coastal environments. 

 

4. Discussion and Conclusions 

 

This study has focussed on sea-level rise scenarios up to 1.75 m by 2100 which are 

consistent with the range defined by the IPCC AR5 report plus one extreme High-end 

scenario. It should be acknowledged that large rises in SLR could occur and it is prudent to 

consider these when assessing impacts and adaptation (Nicholls et al., 2013; Hinkel et al. 

2015). Obtained results show that climate change induced effects such as SLR will 

significantly affect coastal hotspots as Catalonia by increasing the magnitude of natural 

hazards and/or by decreasing the capacity to cope with them. In this sense, it has to be 

considered that the final coastal response to RSLR will strongly depend on the overall 

sediment budget. Thus, sediment supplies to the coast are very important for both horizontal 

and vertical accretion, which potentially act as resilient processes to erosion and inundation 

hazards, respectively. Following global trends of decreasing continental sediment supplies to 

the coastal zone (Syvitski et al 2005), rivers along the Catalan coast are playing a decreasing 



17 
 

role in contributing to coastal stability due to the significant human influence in their drainage 

basins. As an example, the most important river discharging in the Spanish Mediterranean 

coast, the Ebro river, has experienced a significant decreasing trend in annual water discharge 

(-221 hm3/year) since the 60’s. This coincides with a significant increase in the number of 

active dams and barriers in its drainage basin (173 active dams/barrages at present) in such a 

way that about 96 % of the drainage basin is fully regulated. The rest of rivers discharging 

along the Catalan coast are also affected in a different degree by human activities such as 

damming, water extraction, urbanization and sand and gravel mining (Liquete et al. 2009). 

Due to this, we can conclude that the present and future role of river sediment inputs to 

counteract SLR-induced erosion is nearly negligible.       

Under this scenario of SLR-induced retreat, the following potential changes are 

expected. Climate change will be a serious threat to coastal tourism in Catalonia as the 

expected enhanced shoreline retreat will severely decrease the recreational beach carrying 

capacity in the near future under tested scenarios. This will have a serious impact on the 

economy due to the importance of this sector for the Catalan GDP. To sustain the recreational 

use under the expected range of SLR adequate adaptation measures must be taken to 

compensate erosion which, in most of the cases, will involve the replacement of the sediment 

volume being eroded. This can be accompanied by using the resilient behaviour in areas with 

accommodation space. However, this will imply to promote a shift of the recreational use 

from current urbanized locations to more natural areas where beaches have no internal 

barriers.  

Similarly, the protection function provided by Catalan beaches will also be affected by 

climate change. Here, the target objective should be to maintain the level of protection of 

infrastructures along the hinterland under CC. The induced shoreline retreat will severely 



18 
 

decrease the capacity of protection and, in consequence, an increase in coastal damage will 

occur without any change in storminess. 

Since the main identified problem for recreation and protection is a loss of beach 

width, adaptation measures should be directed to how most effectively to maintain these 

widths. Since the required resources (sediment and money) are not unbounded, any effective 

policy should include a robust criteria to select areas where it is most effective and beneficial 

concentrate efforts. In any case, both approaches (large scale nourishment and managed 

retreat) imply a much more strategic approach to beach management than is currently the case 

on the Catalan coast. 

 The Catalan coast has been used as a paradigm of coastal hotspots in the 

Mediterranean basin because stresses and pressures on the natural system coincide with a high 

exposure and low adaptive capacity. Under a future affected by Climate Change in general, 

and SLR in particular, this hotspot condition will be exacerbated due to an increase in natural 

hazards unless a determined and timely societal response is taken.
