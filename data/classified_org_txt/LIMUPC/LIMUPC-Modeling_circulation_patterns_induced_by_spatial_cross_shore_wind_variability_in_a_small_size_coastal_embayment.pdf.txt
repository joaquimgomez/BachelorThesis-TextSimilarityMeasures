ABSTRACT 21 

This contribution shows the importance of the cross-shore spatial wind variability in the water 22 

circulation in a small-sized micro-tidal bay. The hydrodynamic wind response at Alfacs Bay (Ebro 23 

River delta, NW Mediterranean Sea) is investigated with a numerical model (ROMS) supported by 24 

in situ observations. The wind variability observed in meteorological measurements is characterized 25 

with meteorological model (WRF) outputs. From the hydrodynamic simulations of the bay, the water 26 

circulation response is affected by the cross-shore wind variability, leading to water current structures 27 

not observed in the homogeneous-wind case. If the wind heterogeneity response is considered, the 28 

water exchange in the longitudinal direction increases significantly, reducing the water exchange time 29 

by around 20%. Wind resolutions half the size of the bay (in our case around 9 km) inhibit cross-30 

shore wind variability, which significantly affects the resultant circulation pattern. The characteristic 31 

response is also investigated using idealized test cases. These results show how the wind curl 32 

contributes to the hydrodynamic response in shallow areas and promotes the exchange between the 33 

bay and the open sea. Negative wind curl is related to the formation of an anti-cyclonic gyre at the 34 

bay’s mouth. Our results highlight the importance of considering appropriate wind resolution even in 35 

small-scale domains (such as bays or harbors) to characterize the hydrodynamics, with relevant 36 

implications in the water exchange time and the consequent water quality and ecological parameters.     37

1. INTRODUCTION 44 
Tides, winds and freshwater inputs are the main factors determining the hydrodynamics in coastal 45 

areas such estuaries and semi-enclosed bays. In micro-tidal and low-freshwater-discharge 46 

environments the winds become the main driving mechanisms. The response in bay dynamics to wind 47 

forcing has been investigated in detail from different approaches. For instance, Csanady (1973) 48 

investigated the current response to a wind in a non-rotating basin, in which the forced response is a 49 

surface distortion due to the setup accompanied by a forced flow pattern due to bathymetry variability. 50 

Basically, a stable situation shows that in areas shallower than mean water depth the transport is with 51 

the wind direction, while it is against the wind direction in deeper areas. Gravitational estuarine 52 

circulation is also influenced by winds: intensified with a down-estuary wind, and weakened or even 53 

reversed with an up-estuary wind (Valle-Levinson and Blanco, 2004). Furthermore, interaction 54 

between wind and gravitational circulation is able to generate substantial transverse circulation in 55 

estuaries with a triangular section (Wong 1994), and the influence of winds on exchange flows in 56 

narrow areas is demonstrated in Narvaez and Valle-Levinson (2008). Recently, application of 3-D 57 

numerical models has allowed the physical mechanisms involving wind-driven circulation in coastal 58 

areas to be investigated: for instance, asymmetries in the ebb--flood cycle due to wind forcing in 59 

surface layers (deCastro et al., 2003), circulation patterns and water exchange processes (Schoen et 60 

al., 2014), and wind model resolution in circulation and wave model behavior (Signell et al., 2005; 61 

Klaic et al., 2011; Schaeffer et al., 2011).  62 

Contributions focused on regional and oceanic scales have demonstrated that wind variability due to 63 

topographic constraints not only influences the local circulation but also affects mesoscale structures 64 

(Chavanne et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2009). Espino et al. (1998) compares the wind curl with mesoscale 65 

circulation in NW Mediterranean Sea, and a theoretical approach to wind curl effects on coastal areas 66 

such as the Benguela Current was described by Junker et al. (2015).  Zampato et al. (2007) studied 67 

the sensitivity of sea level prediction in the Adriatic Sea to different atmospheric model resolution, 68 

showing how the finest-resolution models improve the representation of most energetic events. At 69 

smaller scales, Rueda et al. (2009) studied the uncertainty of 3-D hydrodynamic models associated 70 

with the spatially and temporally varying wind fields in a lake, demonstrating that the better results 71 

were obtained using the maximum of available observational data to interpolate the spatial wind fields 72 

(reproducing the maximum spatial wind variability). Herrera et al. (2005) studied wind variability on 73 

the coast of Spain, emphasizing the wind channeling effects of the Ria de Vigo estuary through a 74 

comparison of various meteorological stations. Cerralbo et al. (2012) applied a numerical model in 75 

the same estuary and observed that a meteorological model (≈4km resolution) was not able to 76 

reproduce all the spatial variability, thus leading to remarkable errors in current modeling. However, 77 

only few studies on spatial wind variability have been carried out on bays and estuary dynamics, 78 



mainly due to the lack of meteorological observations and the coarse resolution of meteorological 79 

models (on the order of a few kilometers). Klaic et al. (2011) compares the hydrodynamic patterns 80 

resulting from the application of different-resolution atmospheric models in the mid-Adriatic, 81 

revealing the appearance of new hydrodynamic structures using the finest-resolution models. An 82 

interesting example is found in Podsetchine and Schernewski (1999), based on a lake and showing 83 

how wind variability on short spatial scales affects the hydrodynamic response. On the other hand, 84 

Grifoll et al. (2012) investigated the influence of wind variability in harbors whose layout strongly 85 

conditioned the preferential directions for the water motion, thus reducing the effects of the spatial 86 

wind variability.  87

The wind variability affects the water exchange between the sheltered waters and the open sea. In this 89 

sense, an integrated parameter of water exchange between the bay and the open sea may be also useful 90 

to assess the influence of the spatial wind variability on the hydrodynamics. Water exchange time is 91 

a physical variable determining how the ecological status of a coastal embayment or estuary is 92 

affected by human-induced stresses. For example, short water exchange times indicate that there is 93 

insufficient time for the dissolved oxygen to be depleted (i.e. Tweed Estuary, U.K) (Wolanski, 2007). 94 

On the other hand, longer times in a restricted coastal area will, potentially, allow an increasing 95 

buildup of inputs from land and lead to seasonal or even permanent O2 depletion in bottom layers and 96 

consequently ecological problems (Jickells, 1998).  97 

With the purpose of gaining knowledge of the effects of wind variability in semi-enclosed areas on 98 

water circulation, Alfacs Bay (located on the Ebro River delta, Fig.1) was chosen as the study site, 99 

where a set of meteo-oceanographic data were available. The main objectives of this contribution are 100 

to characterize the hydrodynamic response of the bay under spatial wind variability conditions, as 101 

well as to investigate their influence on the water exchange between the bay and the open sea, 102 

estimating the water exchange times. The skill assessment of the numerical model is carried out with 103 

water current observations obtained during field campaigns in Alfacs Bay. The analysis and 104 

discussion of the results are also supported by numerical experiments in idealized domains made in 105 

order to investigate the physical mechanism responsible for the hydrodynamic response to the spatial 106 

wind variability. Even the results are particularized by the physical characteristics of Alfacs Bay; the 107 

new insights provided may be exported to similar domains in terms of hydrodynamic response to 108 

heterogeneous wind fields. The paper is organized as follows: the study area, observations and 109 

numerical model are described in Section 2. Numerical modeling skill assessment and the results of 110 

the numerical experiments are presented on Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the wind variability 111 

effects on the hydrodynamic response and contextualize our results in the state of the art. In Section 112 

5, we conclude by highlighting our main findings. 113 

2. METHODS 114 

2.1 -- Study area: 115 

Alfacs Bay is defined as a bar-build estuary (Pritchard, 1952) formed by the interaction of Ebro River 116 

sediment and currents (Fig.1). The bay is around 16km in length by 4km wide, with an average depth 117 

of around 4m. The connection with the open sea is 2.5km, with a central channel of 6.5m and shallow 118 

shoals of around 1-2m on both sides.  The bay is surrounded by rice fields to the north, which spill 119 

around 10m3s-1 of freshwater loaded with nutrients 9-10 months per year into the bay (April-120 

December), and a sand beach closing it on the east side. Monstià Serra, with maximum altitudes of 121 

around 700m, closes the bay on the western side (Fig.1). 122

and WRF3 configurations in Alfacs Bay. In b) and c) Gray lines shows the contour lines for topography at 200, 400 

and 600m. Coastline is plotted in black. Decorrelation scales for eastward (d) and northward (e) wind components for 

both WRF3 and WRF9 during summer and winter periods.  



The bay has been defined as a salt-wedge estuary (Camp and Delgado 1987) with almost stable 123 

stratification all year. The highest tidal range during spring tides is around 0.2m, and the 124 

hydrodynamic fluctuations are controlled by the wind modulated by the seiche activity (Cerralbo et 125 

al., 2014). The most intense regional winds in the area are from the north and northwest (Bolaños et 126 

al 2009), establishing a wind jet due to the orographic effects in the Ebro River valley. As an example, 127 

36h time-averaged wind fields (modeled) during a northwesterly event during winter 2014 are shown 128 

in Fig.2. In general, the water column used to be stratified due to the freshwater discharge, but well-129 

mixed conditions are more common during winter and mostly related to the hydrodynamic response 130 

to wind forcing (Llebot et al., 2013) and occasionally to seiches (Cerralbo et al., 2015a). 131 

2.2 -- Observations: 132 

The bulk of the observational data correspond to two field campaigns: from July to mid-September 133 

2013 and February to April 2014. The data set consisted of water currents from two 2MHz acoustic 134 

Doppler current profiler (ADCPs) moored in the mouth (A1) and inner bay (A2) (Fig.1) configured 135 

to record 10min averaged data from 10 registers per minute and with 25cm vertical cells. Both devices 136 

were equipped with pressure systems and a temperature sensor, and were mounted on the sea bottom 137 

at 6.5m depth. Moreover, a chain of three temperature and salinity sensors (CTs) was moored in A2 138 

at around 0.5, 2, and 4m depth, recording minutely data. The sea level data were obtained from the 139 

“Catalan Meteo-oceanographic Observational Network” (described in detail in Bolaños et al., 2009) 140 

in Sant Carles de la Ràpita harbor (Fig.1) and bottom pressure systems from the ADCPs. Atmospheric 141 

data (wind, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation and humidity) were obtained from a fixed land 142 

station: Alcanar (M-A) and M-Met (from Meteorological Service of Catalonia, http://www. 143 

meteocat.cat).  144 

2.3 – Description of numerical models and simulations:  145 

Numerical wind information was obtained from current implementations of the Weather Research 146 

and Forecasting model (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) applied at two spatial resolutions (9km and 147 

3km) in Alfacs Bay (Fig.2) and oriented to provide meteorological forecasts by the Meteocat agency. 148 

Information, configuration and validation details of the atmospheric models are summarized in 149 

Cerralbo et al. (2015b). 150 

The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model used in this study is the Regional Ocean Modeling 151 

System (ROMS). Numerical aspects are described in detail in Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005), 152 

and a complete description of the model, documentation and code are available at the ROMS website: 153 

http://myroms.org. The implementation of the model consisted of a regular grid of 186 x 101 points 154 

with a spatial resolution of 100 m (in both x and y) and 12 sigma levels in the vertical. The bottom 155 

boundary layer was parameterized with a logarithmic profile using a characteristic bottom roughness 156 



height of 0.002 m. This value has been considered according to the bottom characteristics of the bay 157 

bed (mud and silt as described by Palacín et al., 1991) and the presence of submerged aquatic 158 

macrophytes (Camp et al., 1991) and ripples on some areas. The turbulence closure scheme for the 159 

vertical mixing is the generic length scale (GLS), described in Warner et al. (2005) and tuned to 160 

behave as Mellor--Yamada level 2.5 (k-kl). The implementation included horizontal harmonic 161 

Laplacian viscosity and mixing for velocity and tracers, respectively, both with constant coefficients 162 

of 5m2s-1. Future works should determine the importance of these parameters for the validation results 163 

for both temperature and salinity in a particular case such as Alfacs Bay. The main configuration 164 

values for the model are summarized in Table 1. A two-year simulation (2012-2013) was performed 165 

in order to obtain realistic three-dimensional temperature and salinity fields. The sea level and water 166 

currents at the boundaries were imposed from hourly sea level data obtained on Sant Carles de la 167 

Ràpita, accommodating the perpendicular water velocities at the open boundary axis, consistent with 168 

the Chapman and Flather algorithms (Carter and Merrifield, 2007). Temperature and salinity were 169 

interpolated from MyOcean products at 6h data (Tonani et al., 2009). Atmospheric forcing and heat 170 

fluxes were obtained from M-A (10min) and M-Met. Freshwater inputs were added on the northern 171 

coast with an average summer flow of 10m3s-1 and 0 in winter (Camp et al., 1991). The temperature 172 

and salinity fields modeled in the long-term simulations were used as initial and boundary conditions 173 

for two simulations coinciding with summer (three months) and winter (one month) field campaigns 174 

described in the observations section. For both simulations, open boundary is forced with depth-175 

averaged velocities and sea level measured at A1 (10’ data). In summer simulation, freshwater inputs 176 

are set equal to 10m3s-1, whilst in winter simulation they are 0m3·s-1. For both periods, the skill 177 

assessment and validation of the model were done for the sea level, velocities in A1 and A2, as well 178 

as temperature and salinity data in A2.  179

In order to evaluate the hydrodynamic response to wind variability, we designed a set of simulations 180 

using different wind fields. Simulation Wr3 used hourly WRF winds at 3km resolution, simulation 181 

Wr3-A considered spatially averaged wind values at each time step and simulation Wr9 used wind 182 

fields from 9km WRF implementation with a temporal resolution of 3h. The averaged wind values 183 

were obtained considering strictly the wind data applied on the inner-bay water surface. We focus on 184 

the hydrodynamic response of a six-day period (from 28th February to 6th March 2014), during which 185 

northwesterly winds (hereafter NW winds) were blowing in the area (15-20m/s) (Fig.2 shows a 36h 186 

averaged wind field during 3rd and 4th March). We selected this period because it shows a series of 187 

typical northwesterly events recorded during the extensive campaign period, therefore coinciding 188 

with data from A1 and A2. During the northwesterly event, freshwater sources are considered to be 189 

equal to 0m3·s-1, corresponding to rice fields’ dry conditions. This period simulation does not consider 190 

baroclinic processes in order to isolate the hydrodynamic response to wind variability.  191 

 

Figure 3. Images a) and b) shows the observed depth-averaged velocities in A1 and A2 respectively during July 2013. 

Images c) and d) presents the scatter plot on A1 and A2 between eastward and northward depth-averaged velocities for 

both observational and modelled data during summer 2013. Same for winter campaign in images e) and f). 



Three cross-sectional sections are defined (T1, Th and T2 in Fig.1) with the objective of describing the 192 

role of cross-shore spatial wind variability in the water flows within the bay and open sea. T1 and T2 193 

coincide with A1 and A2 mooring positions, while Th represents the narrowest part of the bay’s 194 

mouth. The cross-sectional flows in each transect are analyzed (positive values indicating direction 195 

to the bay’s head). Moreover, a longitudinal transect along the main axis of the bay (Fig.1, named L) 196 

is utilized to observe the differences in cross-sectional flows. Finally, for the sake of gaining a 197 

mechanistic understanding of the bay’s response to wind variability, a set of numerical tests in 198 

idealized domains are defined, with wind patterns designed to reproduce the observed wind pattern 199 

in Alfacs Bay (see Section 2.1) in an idealized shape domain in order to minimize the effects of lateral 200 

roughness and nonlinearity induced by irregular bathymetry and coastline. The characteristics and 201 

main results are described in detail in Section 4. 202 

 203 

3. RESULTS 204 

3.1 Model validation   205 

The skill assessment of the atmospheric model was presented previously in Cerralbo et al. (2015b).  206 

The hydrodynamic model is validated using observational data for summer and winter simulations. 207 

Basic statistics (correlation factor and bias) and skill score -- skill assessment index SK (Wilmott, 208 

1981) and cost function χ (Holt et al., 2005) -- between observations and modeling results are used 209 

to validate the numerical model (see summary in Table 2). SK equals 1 when a perfect agreement 210 

between model and observations occurs and decreases to 0 for a complete disagreement. The cost 211 

function (χ) is defined as a measure of the ratio of model error to the observed variance. For χ, an 212 

acceptable predictive skill of the model is related to values lower than 1 (root mean square error 213 

(RMSE) smaller than the standard deviation from observations), and a well-modeled variable 214 

threshold is situated at 0.4 (Holt et al., 2005). The aforementioned skill score formulations are detailed 215 

in the Appendix. The correlation for sea level during the summer simulation (SS) period is 0.89 and 216 

0.85 for A1 and A2, respectively. SK shows values higher than 0.9 and χ close to 0 for both locations. 217 

Similar values are obtained for the winter period (WS). In consequence, the agreement for sea level 218 

is considered almost optimum.  219 

During summer, depth-averaged velocities for the zonal component show correlations of 0.73 (A1) 220 

and 0.77 (A2), and values of SK and χ also indicate good agreement (Table 2). The meridional 221 

component shows higher agreement at A1 for all skill scores, while at A2 better agreement is observed 222 

for the zonal component. The larger correlation in meridional or zonal direction in both places is 223 

related to the prevalent alongshore direction due to the bathymetry influence on water circulation 224 

(Fig.3c and 3d). Due to the prevalence of barotropic seiche motion, the axis with major variability 225 



corresponds to alongshore directions in both places (Fig.3a and Fig.3b). The scatterplot between 226 

observed and modeled depth-averaged velocities showed a significant grade of agreement in both 227 

components (Fig.3c, 3d, 3e and 3f). Moreover, there is seasonal variability in the observed--modeled 228 

comparison shown in Fig.3c--f. In that sense, due to the most intense seiches being observed during 229 

summer (Cerralbo et al., 2014), the modeled currents are overestimated during that period. During 230 

winter, the skill scores shows better performance of the model in comparison to the summer period. 231 

The correlation for depth-averaged velocities is between 0.8 and 0.9 (with the exception of the 232 

northward component in A2). 233

The velocity components are rotated in order to describe the maximum variability in one axis, which 237 

is called hereafter alongshore due to its alignment with the central axis of the bay. The main axis is 238 

obtained in winter at 36º and 26º counterclockwise for A1 and A2, respectively, and during summer 239 

at 59º and 21º for A1 and A2 respectively. The alongshore velocities measured in both A1 and A2 240 

considering vertical variability are graphically compared in Fig.4 with modeling results for both 241 

locations and seasons using Taylor diagram (Taylor 2001). In this diagram, the comparison between 242 

observations and the model are shown in terms of correlation, the centered root mean square 243 

difference (CRMSD) and the standard deviations (see Appendix). Along-shore correlations ranges 244 



between 0.6 and 0.7 for both locations (SS and WS), whilst cross-shore show values lower than 0.4 245 

for all layers. In order to compare in the same figure different vertical layers against observations, the 246 

standard deviations and CRMSD are normalized over the standard deviation of the corresponding 247 

observations (Grifoll et al., 2013). In the diagram, the model skill improves as the points get closer 248 

to the observation reference point. The proximity of A1 to imposed boundary conditions induces 249 

better agreement than A2, where the role of bay dynamics (stratification or nonlinearity induced by 250 

bottom friction) is complex and modifies the water response. On the other hand, during winter (WS) 251 

all the skill scores indicate better modeling performance than summer, probably due to the 252 

discrepancies in the modeled stratification (higher during the summer period). Future experiments 253 

using spatially variable bottom roughness should be conducted in order to understand the importance 254 

of such variability in the water currents.  255

and observational data are averaged in vertical layers of

 256 



Modeled temperature is compared with CTs and ADCP sensors, revealing a high correlation and good 257 

skill assessment factors for inner-bay (A2) surface sensors. At 3m depth, the correlation is still good 258 

albeit lower than at the surface. However, during summer, on bottom layers the correlation is close 259 

to 0, indicating no agreement with observational data, whilst during winter the modeled bottom layer 260 

temperature follows the observational data. The processes that lead to discrepancies in these layers 261 

during summer may be related to differences in the mixing processes in the water column. The 262 

differences observed from the surface to the bottom are around 2ºC for almost the entire summer, 263 

while the model reveals differences of about 0.5ºC. The bias shows how that model underestimates 264 

the temperature during summer and winter. However, the skill scores show good behavior, because 265 

the period and magnitude of the diurnal oscillations are well reproduced by the model. Maximum 266 

RMSE is around 1.3 ºC and similar to previous modeling works at Alfacs Bay (Llebot et al., 2013).   267 

Finally, salinity data were only available for the beginning of the summer campaign (around 15 days) 268 

due to biofouling. Moreover, in winter, the sensor at 4m did not work properly during the whole 269 

campaign. During summer, the differences between 3m and surface salinity were around 1.5 in A2, 270 

while in the model these differences were around 0.3--0.4. The discrepancies of the numerical results 271 

and the observations seem to indicate the presence of other sources of freshwater fluxes (i.e. 272 

groundwater fluxes or an increase of continental runoff not monitored) and a possible overestimation 273 

of the mixing. Sensitivity tests using double and quadruple freshwater flows during summer show 274 

remarkable differences in salinity and temperature values along the bay. These results indicate the 275 

relevance of a detailed information of freshwater inputs, thus encouraging future studies to address 276 

and rectify this lack of information considering also potential contribution of fresh groundwater 277 

sources (Camp, 1994). During winter, the salinity bias in both 0.5m and 2m layers was lower, albeit 278 

still positive, indicating higher simulated than observed salinity values. This agrees with previous 279 

studies that observed that during winter, even with the drainage channels closed (no water in rice 280 

fields), the bay still received freshwater inputs (lower salinity than open sea) (Camp and Delgado 281 

1987). 282

3.2. Hydrodynamic response to wind variability 284 

The hydrodynamic response is investigated in detail during the northwesterly wind event for the three 285 

simulations suggested in Section 2.3. In this period, the winds were blowing mostly from the north 286 

and northwest, lasting for more than 12h with sustained wind speeds higher than 8 m·s-1 (Fig.5a)  and 287 

maximum wind gusts of 20 m·s-1. Time-averaged winds for 3rd and 4th March showed noticeable 288 

spatial variability in Alfacs Bay (Fig.2a-c). One way to quantify the spatial variability is through the 289 

decorrelation distance. Using all the data inside the area marked in Fig.2b and c, the decorrelation 290 

scale is obtained for both periods, analyzed by components and then adjusted with an exponential 291 

equation (Fig.2d and 2e). Results show clear differences between WRF at 3km and 9km, revealing 292 

that the correlation decays much more clearly at smaller length scales with WRF at 3km, thus 293 

indicating that higher-resolution products resolve more spatial features. Moreover, differences 294 

between the summer and winter period reveal more variability during summer, probably related to 295 

the presence of more locally influenced wind sea breeze. These gradients were also appreciated at 296 

shorter timescales. For instance, Fig 6.e1 shows a snapshot of the wind fields at 10:00 UTC on 3rd 297 

March (corresponding to simulation Wr3). Maximum velocities are observed in the inner area of the 298 

bay, with an almost calm region over the bay’s mouth. This picture agrees with the wind pattern for 299 



NW described in Cerralbo et al. (2015), suggesting wind shadowing effects from local and regional 300 

orography on some occasions. The wind pattern shows a transition zone with maximum wind 301 

intensity gradient between Th and T2 sections. The averaged wind field (Wr3-A) presented intensities 302 

of around 6 m·s-1 from the NW (see snapshot in Fig 6.a1). 303

on the top left corner of a and e (a.1 and e.1) shows snapshot of wind forcing (m·s-1) in each experiments, while big 

size images (a.2 and e.2) show surface currents modelled with ROMS. Images b and f for cross-sectional velocities 

along T1, c and g for Th and d and h for T2. The initial point for each transect (km 0) is located on the northern shoal. 

In a and e, colors for wind and current speeds (different scales). In cross-sectional plots, colors represent velocities: 

positive values indicating inward bay velocities, and negative for outward water currents. 

The modeled water circulation for Wr3-A (Fig.6a) shows mean surface velocities around 4-5 cm·s-1, 304 

with surface currents following the wind direction. The maximum intensities are observed in the 305 

narrow areas and coincide with headlands in the southern margin of the bay. In the eastern margin, 306 



the shoreline and the shallow bathymetry force the alignment of the currents with the boundaries. A 307 

similar current pattern but larger water velocities are modeled for the Wr3 simulation. The most 308 

intense currents for Wr3 are obtained in the inner bay, according to higher wind stress. At the bay’s 309 

mouth, surface velocities in Wr3 are lower in comparison to Wr3-A, coinciding with areas with the 310 

lowest wind stress. Noticeable variations in surface water direction are observed at the bay’s mouth 311 

(between T1, Th and offshore). In this area, the water current is intensified on the southern side of the 312 

mouth, and a counter flow towards the inner bay appears on the northern side.  313 

The corresponding cross-sectional currents for the three sections considered (i.e T1, T2 and Th) are 314 

presented on Fig.6b--d and f--h. Positive means inward flow, and negative means outward flow. For 315 

transect T2 in Wr3-A velocities across the section are small and the flow is positive (inwards). For 316 

Wr3, larger velocities induced by wind stress over the eastern margin and southern shore induced a 317 

significant increment of inward flow in T2 (south extreme). For this section, outward flows occupy 318 

half of the section, with horizontal shear in the along-shelf direction. Alongshore currents for T1 319 

section show a similar pattern between Wr3 and Wr3-A simulations, with outward flow over margins 320 

and inward flow in the deep central channel. 321 

The most relevant differences between numerical tests appear on the Th transect. For Wr3-A water 322 

circulation follows the main wind direction in the surface layers, with a divergence flow in the 323 

southern headland. On the other hand, for Wr3 this section coincides with the vertex of an anti-324 

cyclonic gyre observed between T1 and Th. Alongshore velocities through sections reveal structures 325 

completely different between both tests. For Wr3-A, horizontal shear is observed between the margins 326 

(outward flow) and the central area, along with vertical shear in the margins, with ingoing flows at 327 

the bottom (Fig.6c). On the other hand, Wr3 reveals a clearly horizontal two-layered structure (no 328 

vertical shear), with inflows in the northern region and outflow in the south (Fig.6g). The intensities 329 

of these flows are much higher than Wr3-A. 330 

To explore the vertical structure of the flow along the bay and with the same wind direction (almost 331 

cross-shore), the velocities across transect L (Fig.1) are shown in Fig.7, corresponding to the same 332 

instant as Fig.6. Both numerical simulations show a two-layered vertical structure, with surface 333 

currents flowing downwind (negative values), and a northwestward return flow (upwind, positive) in 334 

the deeper layers. The bottom circulation shows two regions of maximum velocities: one region 335 

between Th and T2 and another between T2 and the eastern boundary of the bay. These regions are 336 

also observable in Fig.6a, showing lower surface velocities linked with the return flow observed in 337 

the bottom circulation. Differences between Wr3 and Wr3-A yield different water velocity of upwind 338 

and downwind flows. In particular, larger intensities are found for the Wr3 simulation in comparison 339 

to Wr3-A around T2. 340

values for velocities northward, and negative values for velocities shouward. The location for sections Th and T2 are 

marked with dashed lines.   

 341 

The temporal evolution of net exchange flow over each cross-shore transect is obtained for the entire 342 

northwesterly event in both Wr3 and Wr3-A simulations. The inflow differences between simulations 343 

(Wr3 minus Wr3-A) are plotted in Fig.8b, c, and d. The mean, standard deviation and total flow 344 

differences throughout each section are summarized in Table 3. Differences in T2 and Th sections are 345 

evident, with an increase of net flow (positive) for Wr3 simulation in comparison to the Wr3-A case. 346 

In contrast, the T1 section does not present significant differences for both simulations. Standard 347 

deviations reveal similar values for the three sections. These differences could also be defined in 348 

relative terms (percentages of variation). In this case, the Wr3 case versus Wr3-A represents an 349 

increase of 14 and 22% of mean flows through sections T2 and Th, respectively, and a decrease of 350 

around 3% in T1. The dashed box in Fig.8 corresponds to the snapshot plotted in both Fig.6 and Fig.7. 351 



For both Th and T2 this event is related to a period of significant maximum (positive) differences. 352 

During this snapshot the flow differences between simulations for T1, T2 and Th were 41, 44 and 88 353 

m3·s-1, respectively, computed from the cross-sectional flow shown in Figure 6. The previous 354 

numerical results reveal a strong influence of the wind direction in the vertical structure of the flow 355 

(Fig.6).  356

A hydrodynamic time parameter applied to the defined volumes is used to analyze and compare the 358 

flows due to wind variability and their relative effects on the water exchange in Alfacs Bay. There 359 

are many definitions used to describe the hydrodynamic time parameters for a given domain, the 360 

simplest one being the ratio of total volume (V) to water flow (Q) entering or leaving it (Jouon et al. 361 

2005). The methodology is based on the displacement concept, which gives us the time required to 362 

displace all the water in a volume once, assuming that all water particles have the same transit time 363 

through the control volume. This means that, when using this approximation, space and time 364 

variability of the hydrodynamics within the control volume is not considered. This is summarized in 365 

𝜃 = 𝑉 𝑄⁄  (with θ as water exchange time) as proposed by Jouon et al. (2005). Following the bay 366 

division presented in Fig.1 by T1, T2 and Th, we used the cross-sectional flows and corresponding 367 

water volume enclosed on their eastern side or inner-bay side (naming each volume as VT1, VT2 and 368 

VTh). Results for the entire northwesterly wind event are presented in Table 4. With non-variable 369 

winds (Wr3-A) the highest flow appears in T2 (biggest section, with 16.4·10
3 m2, and around 15·103 370 

m2 in T1), almost twice that observed in T1 and Th. Considering the volume of water enclosed by each 371 

section, the θ shows similar values for both T1 and Th and minimum ones for T2. Considering the 372 

wind variability, the averaged flows and corresponding θ are modified in T2 and Th, reducing them 373 

about 14% and 20% respectively, and remaining without noticeable changes at T1. On the other hand, 374 

the hourly snapshot observed during 3rd March at 10:00 UTC (Fig.6 and 7) reveals noticeable 375 

variations in all the sections, showing associated water exchange time reductions of 20%, 47% and 376 

40% for T1, Th and T2, respectively, between Wr3 and Wr3-A. 377

4. DISCUSSION  379 

Current measurements have shown the complexity of the water circulation due to the nonlinearity of 380 

the flow and the non-stationary response. This behavior is related to the short frictional time 381 

adjustment (estimated to be 1.5h according to Cerralbo et al., 2015a) and short sea level adjustment 382 

time at wind forcing. A linear response to wind forcing is only expected during the first hours of wind 383 

events. For instance, during 3rd March (northwesterly event) the current velocity measured in A1 and 384 

A2 increases at the same time as the wind intensity (see Fig.5). Then, after a few hours, although the 385 

wind intensity remains approximately constant, the velocity of the surface currents decreases due to 386 

the likely adjustment of the frictional effects as well as the emergence of other terms in the momentum 387 

balance (i.e. pressure gradient and advective term). For instance, the adjustment time for the 388 

appearance of sea level gradients is on the order of the length of the bay divided by the celerity of 389 

long gravity waves (~(g·H)1/2). Applied at Alfacs Bay the adjustment time is around 50min. 390 

Therefore, for periods of a few hours it is realistic to consider the wind setup (i.e., 1cm with winds of 391 

around 10ms-1 and assuming bay width of 4km) opposing the wind stress. For longer periods, the sea-392 

surface adjustment time may lead to the generation of longitudinal and lateral oscillations as well as 393 

internal seiches in the bay due to the transient nature of the wind, variability in the remote sea level 394 

forcing (e.g. atmospheric pressure; Boegman, 2009) or stratification. Moreover, the differences in 395 

water column stratification could imply significant differences in surface water response to wind 396 

stress. For instance noticeable differences in the stratification of the water column between the inner 397 

bay (mixed) and bay’s mouth (stratified) were observed on 25th February (Cerralbo et al., 2015a). In 398 

consequence, the expected larger water velocities in A2 in comparison to A1 due to the wind 399 

variability during the northwesterly wind event are partially hidden by the complex response of the 400 

bay.  401 

Due to the lack of additional meteorological and hydrodynamic observations within the bay to 402 

complete the analysis of the wind variability response, the results of the validated modeling system 403 



(atmospheric and hydrodynamic) provided interesting insights. Previous works in Alfacs Bay (Camp, 404 

1994; Llebot et al., 2013) have observed well-mixed conditions in winter under energetic cross-shore 405 

winds. In addition, observations only one week before the northwesterly event showed complete 406 

water column mixing in the bay (Cerralbo et al., 2015a). In consequence, in order to isolate the 407 

hydrodynamic wind response, the stratification and the astronomical tides have not been considered 408 

in our simulations.  409

Numerical simulations using cross-shore spatial wind variations (Wr3) versus the homogeneous case 410 

(Wr3-A) reveal noticeable differences in hydrodynamic structures. One of the most noteworthy 411 

hydrodynamic features observed is an anti-cyclonic gyre close to the bay’s mouth. This structure is 412 

clearly observable in Fig.6 and Fig.7b and is related to an increase of the flow between Th and T2. 413 

The water fluxes through the sections (summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 8) show that the wind 414 

variability not only determines the hydrodynamic response but also affects the water fluxes through 415 

the bay. A similar structure at the bay’s mouth is found 24h later (not shown). Sectional flow 416 

differences between numerical simulations showed two clearly different hydrodynamic responses: Th 417 

and T2, with noticeable differences between tests, and T1, revealing lower sensitivity to the wind 418 

variability. Therefore, the wind variability in inner areas (Th and T2) implies noticeable reduction of 419 

water exchange times. However, these differences among spatially variable (Wr3) and non-variable 420 

(Wr3-a) winds in Th and T2 respond to different physical mechanisms. Over T2 the differences are 421 

due to an increase of wind speed (Wr3-A to Wr3) affecting the circulation pattern (quadratic effects 422 

through wind stress). Otherwise, over Th (and T1) the wind is much lower in Wr3 than Wr3-A, and 423 

in this case the mechanism that leads to the flow increment is related to the appearance of the anti-424 

cyclonic structure.  425 

In order to understand the mechanism which leads to the hydrodynamic pattern observed in Fig.6 and 426 

Fig.7, a set of idealized numerical tests were implemented. The geometry is reduced to a rectangular 427 

shape (oriented east--west) opened at the southwestern side with a north--south- oriented channel 428 

keeping away the open boundary (Fig.9). Reference test is forced by 5m·s-1 northwest wind (Fig.9a). 429 

The wind variability tests are defined by a zone with constant winds of 2 m·s-1, and then wind speed 430 

is increased linearly towards the eastern side. Wind patterns along the x-axis are defined above each 431 

image in Fig.9. Two experiments, with the region of varying wind occupying 2/3 or 1/3 of total area, 432 

were designed (Fig.9c-d and e-f, respectively). Another test with extreme variations is presented in 433 

Fig.9g-h; in this case the region of constant wind is defined as 0m·s-1. The spatially integrated wind 434 

intensity is the same for all cases and equivalent to 5m·s-1 over each grid in the homogeneous test 435 

(Fig.9a). The same geometry and numerical mesh are used with two different bathymetries: flat 436 

bottom with 4m water depth and bathymetry with shoals of 2m depth in the lateral margins and a 437 

central channel of 6m (see Fig 9b). The model implementation is the same as the realistic case 438 

presented in Section 2, except that the water density is homogeneous in the whole domain. The 439 

numerical solution is analyzed after 24 hours of simulation, when the stationary conditions are 440 

reached. For flat bottom with homogeneous wind fields (Fig.9a), the surface currents move in the 441 

same direction as the wind (+3º clockwise from winds). For the channel bottom case, surface currents 442 

are modified in comparison to the flat-bottom case (Fig.9b).  443 



 

Figure 9. Surface streamlines for idealized schemes. Each panel shows the velocity module contours (grey scale) and 

streamlines for each of the idealized wind tests after 24hours of simulation. The winds along x-axis utilized in each 

test are shown at the top of each panel. Left images for flat bathymetry (4m depth) and right images for channelized 

bathymetry. Isobaths 4m and 6m are plotted in dashed grey lines in image b, d, f and h.  

Over the shoals the currents flow with the wind direction but are rotated 30º counterclockwise, while 444 

in deeper areas (central channel) the surface currents rotate 45º clockwise. Cases c and d are similar 445 

to the wind described in Fig.2 and Fig.6 but with larger wind gradients. The eastern corner shows the 446 

highest water velocity with a similar direction to wind forcing, whilst over the region with lower wind 447 

speeds high variability in water surface currents appears. A similar structure (gyre) described in Fig.6 448 



appears in the transitional wind area. When the wind gradient is applied more to the east (Fig.9e and 449 

f), a clear anti-cyclonic gyre is also observable but located in the innermost area of the bay. The last 450 

case (with no wind on the west side) maximizes the effects of the anti-cyclonic gyre. The 451 

southeastward currents induced by wind pull water from the areas with no wind. Then the anti-452 

cyclonic gyre is established covering the entire width of the bay.  This gyre is observed in all the 453 

experiments with wind variability (with both types of bathymetries). The results from idealized tests 454 

indicate that the water circulation on the left side of the wind gradient is characterized by a gyre. The 455 

responsible mechanism is the wind curl, establishing an eastward surface current in the northern 456 

region of the bay with calm winds, and westward flows in the southern regions. Although the 457 

bathymetry has been idealized through a central channel, the numerical results show that the cross-458 

shore wind variability dominates over the bathymetric effects under these circumstances. Therefore, 459 

in our idealized case the spatial wind variability is at least as important as bathymetry in driving the 460 

circulation.  461 

At larger spatial scales than Alfacs Bay, several authors have observed that the vorticity of wind fields 462 

is related to the generation of mesoscale gyres (eddies) on more regional scales such as the 463 

Mediterranean Sea (Espino, 1997; Schaeffer et al., 2011) and the Hawaii Islands (Chavanne et al., 464 

2002). However, the gyres and vortices modeled in Alfacs Bay related to wind variability are not 465 

usually described in small coastal embayments (characteristic length of 10km). The spatial mean wind 466 

curl (  
∑ (𝑑𝑢 𝑑𝑦⁄ −

𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑥⁄ )

𝑛
𝑖=1

𝑛
 , with n for each data pixel) from Wr3 (domain in Fig.2) is shown in Fig.8b 467 

for the northwesterly event. The highest negative values coincide with northwesterly wind events and 468 

respond to the wind variability shown in Fig.2 and Fig.6. Results indicate that negative vorticity close 469 

to Th is causing the appearance of the anti-cyclonic gyre observed in Fig.6 and described in the 470 

idealized tests (Fig.9). In Alfacs Bay, during most energetic winds, the entire water column would 471 

respond to wind stress -turbulent boundary layer larger than the maximum water depth (Llebot et al. 472 

2013, Cerralbo et al. 2015a)- proving the importance of an accurate description of spatial wind 473 

variability.   474 

The averaged flow and timescales in Alfacs Bay are investigated in order to analyze the influence of 475 

spatial wind variability over the entire northwesterly event. Camp (1994) uses salinity-balance-based 476 

approximation to obtain the water exchange time as V/Q, albeit considering the estuarine circulation 477 

as the flow through the section. In his case, a flow of 150m3·s-1 and 40m3·s-1 through a similar section 478 

of Th during open- and closed-channels seasons, respectively (corresponding to water exchange times 479 

of 14 and 50 days), was obtained. Even these flows are an approximation, and they respond to a 480 

completely different physical forcing (gravitational circulation) from what we have used: they gave 481 

us an idea of temporal (θ) and velocity scales (flows) in the bay. When comparing these values with 482 



the numerical results during northwesterly event, it is clear that during the closed-channels season 483 

(winter) the role of the wind variability in the bay exchange flows must be considered (Wr3 and Wr3-484 

A show flows of 59 and 46 m3·s-1, respectively). 485 

For the northwesterly event we have applied the WRF model at 9km resolution (Wr-9) to assess the 486 

results using medium-range products of meteorological forecasts. The averaged wind field is shown 487 

in Fig.2a. The flow differences between Wr3 and Wr9 are summarized in Fig.8c, d and e (grey line). 488 

In general, their differences are similar to the ones observed between Wr3 and Wr3-A. The correlation 489 

between flow differences from Wr3 to Wr3-A or Wr9 moves from 0.56 in T1 and to 0.67 in Th, 490 

indicating that the numerical resolution used in Wr9 is equal to Wr3-A and does not reproduce the 491 

spatial variability under some circumstances. The spatially averaged velocities for both Wr3 and Wr9 492 

are shown in Fig.8f, revealing that the differences between them are minimum most of the time; under 493 

some circumstances (i.e. 1st and 4th March) Wr9 is even more intense. These differences imply a flow 494 

increase through the sections. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that these high-resolution models 495 

are able to solve spatial structures (not reproduced by coarser models), which implies noticeable 496 

variations in hydrodynamic structures, as observed in Klaić et al. (2011) and Zampato et al. (2007). 497 

In consequence, in this contribution case we only estimates hydrodynamic differences explained by 498 

wind curl but energetic differences may be also raised from different wind resolution products. On 499 

the other hand, Wr9 has a temporal resolution of 3h. Considering that the time response of Alfacs 500 

Bay is on the order of a few hours, we can expect that models with larger time resolution would imply 501 

loss of relevant information (for instance, in the exchange flows; see Fig.8). Future research will 502 

include studies on temporal resolution impacts on hydrodynamic response. 503 

For stratified conditions in the water column, larger velocities in the surface layer are expected due 504 

to the diminishing of the vertical momentum transfer. However, observational studies and numerical 505 

sensitivity tests show that the stratification is modified by energetic NW wind events (Llebot et al., 506 

2013; Cerralbo et al., 2015a). During these events the wind stress is able to mix, and the circulation 507 

pattern obtained by the homogeneous case is reproduced in the stratified-water-column simulations. 508 

Therefore, despite the limited depth of Alfacs Bay and the reported stratification due to freshwater 509 

and heat fluxes, we assume that the response pattern to wind variability would not vary significantly 510 

under most energetic winds described in this contribution. However, spatial variability in weaker 511 

winds under stratified conditions would promote more complex circulation. The response under 512 

weaker winds will benefit from extended and simultaneous stratification and water currents 513 

observations. 514 

Several contributions in similar domains to Alfacs Bay (i.e. shallow and micro-tidal environments) 515 

have investigated the hydrodynamic response using homogeneous winds: for instance, Cucco and 516 



Umgiesser (2006) at the Venice Lagoon (Italy), Ferrarin et al. (2010) at Marano and Grado (Italy), 517 

Alekseenko et al. (2013) at the Berre Lagoon (southern France) and Schoen et al. (2014) at an 518 

estuarine lake in South Africa. Also the hydrodynamics of large harbors have been investigated based 519 

on wind measurements at one point (Mestres et al., 2007; Grifoll et al., 2011). Finally, Llebot et al. 520 

(2013) investigated Alfacs Bay using homogeneous winds. Using spatially variable winds likely does 521 

not significantly change the circulation pattern obtained in the mentioned contributions; however their 522 

influence may be relevant in particular cases when the hydrodynamics are linked to ecological issues. 523 

Although not all these locations present similar wind variability to what we observed in Alfacs Bay, 524 

we think that proper sensitivity tests may conclude with significant differences and reveal variability 525 

in water exchanges between the semi-enclosed water body and open sea. The variability of the shape 526 

and dimensions of the coastal embayment influences the relative importance of wind variability 527 

effects, so further combined numerical and observational efforts are desirable to describe the 528 

hydrodynamics in coastal areas. Moreover, these results could be useful to understand wind 529 

variability effects on similar coastal areas with strong variability in cross-shore winds (Raubenheimer 530 

et al., 2013) and also exportable to different environments like mountain lakes, which are usually 531 

surrounded by irregular orography (Venalainen et al., 2003; Podsetchine et al., 1999). 532 

The effects of cross-shore wind variability over the water exchange time influence the grade of the 533 

water flushing, which, in turn, controls relevant issues of the ecological behavior of the bay. For 534 

instance, in Alfacs Bay, the water flushing influences the ecological behavior of the system, 535 

determining the development of harmful algal blooms (HABs) (Loureiro et al., 2009), production of 536 

mollusk farms (Galimany et al., 2011) and fisheries, and importing/exporting species from the open 537 

sea into/out of the bay (as observed in Delgado, 1989). Further investigations linking the variability 538 

of the water exchange and the ecological evolution will benefit the sustainable management of the 539 

bay. Additional wave momentum flux due to wave height gradients is expected to be small; however, 540 

as a future work, a coupled numerical model implementation may provide a range of these forcing 541 

mechanisms. 542 

  5. CONCLUSIONS 543 

Hydrodynamic response in coastal embayments is demonstrated to be very sensitive to wind 544 

variability. A semi-enclosed bay in the Mediterranean Sea is chosen as the application site. The wind 545 

in the bay is affected by regional and local surrounding orography. Due to the lack of high-spatial-546 

resolution observational data, a meteorological model is used to explain the main wind patterns and 547 

to investigate the surface current response. The hydrodynamic model, ROMS, is validated against 548 

observational data, showing good skill assessment in variables such sea level, currents, and 549 

temperature, while larger errors are found in salinity. A barotropic mode of the numerical model, due 550 



to well-mixed conditions in the bay during most extreme winter events, is used in a set of twin 551 

experiments, using winds from the WRF3 model and comparing them with spatially homogeneous 552 

wind fields. Results show the development of anti-cyclonic structures near the bay’s mouth, which 553 

are related to the variation of net flows through the inner bay. A set of idealized numerical tests 554 

confirms the dependency of these hydrodynamic structures on the wind curl (vorticity). At longer 555 

timescales, the variability in hydrodynamic patterns linked to the cross-shore wind heterogeneity 556 

implies noticeable variation in associated water exchange times (20%) over some areas of the bay; 557 

this probably affects the O2 distribution and other key ecological parameters of the bay. Comparison 558 

with a coarser meteorological model (9km) demonstrates the information lost using coarse temporal 559 

and spatial resolutions. Our results demonstrate how the spatial variability of crosswinds could 560 

notably modify the circulation patterns. These results are applicable to similar coastal areas such as 561 

harbors, bays and estuaries affected by local or regional wind variability, and they confirm the 562 

importance of spatial wind variability even in small domains.  563
