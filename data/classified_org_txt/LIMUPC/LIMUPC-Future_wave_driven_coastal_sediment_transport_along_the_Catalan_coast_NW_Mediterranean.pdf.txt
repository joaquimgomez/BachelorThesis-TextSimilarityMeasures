Abstract In the context of climate change, this study evaluates the impact on9
the long-shore and cross-shore sediment transport (LST and CST) along the10
Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean Sea) derived from climate projections ob-11
tained from five combinations of regional and global circulation models (RCMs12
and GCMs). Special emphasis is given to how inter-model variability trans-13
lates from wave projections to wave-driven coastal impacts, which is still poorly14
known. Results show that the uncertainty is in general larger, especially for15
LST, for which the discrepancies among regional models are more relevant16
than those associated to the forcing wave parameters. Such increase in the17
uncertainty can be explained by the nonlinear processes involved, and the role18
of the forcing wave parameters having sometimes competing effects (e.g. wave19
height vs. wave direction). This illustrates that the performance of each RCM-20
GCM can vary from forcing to impact parameters, hence, the suitability of a21
particular RCM-GCM to evaluate a certain impact should be assessed based22
on its ability to properly simulate such impact. In this regard, LST and CST23
rates computed using empirical formulae that integrate several wave climate24
parameters, as in this study, can be used as a non-computationally expen-25

1 Introduction30

Coastal areas are a focus for growing populations and economies (Nicholls and31
Kebede, 2012), in some cases already currently facing issues related to safety32
and/or recreational amenity. Many studies have provided increasing scientific33
evidence that ocean waves–one of the main drivers that shape our coastlines—34
are likely to be affected by a future warmer climate (e.g. Hemer et al, 2013).35
It is therefore important to assess the wave-driven coastal impacts potentially36
arising from climate change to design adaptation strategies to minimize the37
associated negative effects.38

In the last decade, some studies have assessed the wave climate change im-39
pact on the coastal morphology for some regions. However, many of them are40
based on simplified wave climate change scenarios, which may not be realistic41
enough (e.g. Adams et al, 2011; Coelho et al, 2009; Dickson et al, 2009; Hemer,42
2009). Some localised studies have explicitly accounted for the greenhouse43
effect—and some of their sources of uncertainty (e.g. Charles, 2012; Zachari-44
oudaki and Reeve, 2011) but further research is needed to well-understand the45
regional variability of such coastal impacts.46

The location of this study is the Catalan coast, situated in the NW Mediter-47
ranean Sea. The European EUROSION project (2002-2004, http://www.eurosion.48
org/, accessed January 2014) classified this coast, home of about three mil-49
lion people—40% of the Catalan population, as an area highly exposed to50
coastal erosion. Bosom and Jiménez (2011) found many stretches of the cen-51
tral Catalan coast being currently exposed to high levels of vulnerability to52
erosion. Indeed, during the last 50 years, erosion has been the dominant cause53
of reported damage along the Catalan coast (Jiménez et al, 2012). Acting on54
different time scales, long-shore and cross-shore sediment transport (LST and55
CST) are the main coastal processes that contribute to erosion. In this study56
we assess how these processes could change in a warmer climate due solely57
to variations in the wave climate. We do not consider other impacts driven58
by waves (e.g. coastal flooding, infrastructure damage, etc.) or other coastal59
drivers (e.g. sea level rise, storm surge, tides, etc.).60

Casas-Prat and Sierra (2012) undertook a regional study along the Cata-61
lan coast based on extrapolated future wave climate obtained from the trend62
analysis of hindcast wave data of the second half of the last century. They63
identified important variations in the long-shore sediment transport, which64
amounted to a general reduction, but with high uncertainty. In this study we65
use wave projections that were forced by 10-m wind fields derived from the66
midline A1B scenario (IPCC, 2007) using five combinations of regional-global67



Inter-model variability of projected future wave-driven coastal sediment transport 3

climate models (Casas-Prat and Sierra, 2013). Note that the inter-model vari-68
ability in surface wind speed, which drives the ocean surface waves, has been69
found to be one of the most important sources of uncertainty in climate change70
projections (Kjellström et al, 2011).71

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it assesses the future im-72
pact of the greenhouse effect on wave-driven coastal sediment transport at the73
Catalan coast—as done for the first time in this area using climate projections74
that explicitly account for the rise in the greenhouse gas emissions. Second,75
towards a more general understanding of the range of climate change effects,76
this study provides insight into how inter-model climate variability translates77
from climate projections to coastal impacts, in this case, through changes in78
waves.79

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a descrip-80
tion of the datasets that are used. In Section 3 the methodology adopted to81
calculate the sediment transport is explained. Section 4 presents and examines82
the results and a final discussion is included in Section 5. Supplementary ma-83
terial is also provided to explain the main features of the study area in terms84
of both wave projections and geomorphological aspects.85

2 Datasets86

2.1 The forcing: wave climate87

2.1.1 Wave projections88

To project future long-shore and cross-shore sediment transport scenarios,89
this study utilizes 30-year regional wave climate projections at high temporal-90
spatial resolution (3 h and 0.125°). They were obtained by Casas-Prat and91
Sierra (2013) for the time slices: 1971-20001 (baseline period) vs. 2071–210092
(future period). Wave parameters were simulated with the SWAN model (Booij93
et al, 1999), which was forced by 5 wind climate projections, denoted as:94
HIR E, RAC E, REM E, RCA E and RCA H. The first 3 characters of these95
acronyms stand for the regional circulation model (RCM) used whereas the last96
one is related to the driving global circulation model (GCM) (see Appendix97
A of supplementary material). Consequently, we involve a total of 4 RCMs98
driven by the same GCM and one RCM that is also driven by another GCM.99

For winter and summer seasons (defined as December–January–February100
and June–July–August, respectively), Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013) analysed101
the present and the future mean and extreme wave climates from the median102
of the significant wave height (Hs) and the 50-year return period of Hs (z50).103
The distribution of the mean wave direction (θm) and the types of sea states104
were also investigated. A summary of the climate change signals along the105
Catalan coast observed by Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013) that are relevant for106

LST and CST processes, is detailed in the supplementary material (Appendix107
A).108

2.1.2 Wave hindcast109

Additionally, we make use of the wave hindcast data of the HIPOCAS project110
(Guedes Soares et al, 2002). We calculate its associated LST and CST to com-111
pare with those obtained for the baseline period of the wave climate scenarios112
presented in Section 2.1. The HIPOCAS data set was obtained with the WAM113
model (Monbaliu, 2000) and forced by the wind output of the regional atmo-114
spheric model REMO (same RCM as for REM E), which in turn was forced by115
the global re-analysis data of NCEP project (Kalnay et al, 1996). With a time116
resolution of 3 h, this dataset covers the period 1958–2001 but here we use117
only the last 30-year period (baseline period). Along the Catalan coast, the118
spatial resolution is 0.125° whereas it is 0.5° offshore. Similar to the majority119
of simulated data, HIPOCAS data tend to underestimate extreme events but120
the mean climate is well represented (Ratsimandresy et al, 2008). Casas-Prat121
and Sierra (2013) found that the median Hs field obtained with HIPOCAS is122
similar to that of RCA E and RCA H (see Section 2.1.1).123

2.2 The receptor: beaches124

The sediment transport depends not only on the forcing wave climate but also125
on the beach geomorphology (eg. van Rijn et al, 2003) The Catalan coast,126
with a length of about 780 km, encompasses a large geo-diversity of coastal127
types such as cliffs, bays, pocket beaches, long straight beaches and deltas128
(Jiménez et al, 2012). In this study we are assessing the impact of wave climate129
change on the LST and CST, that principally affect sandy beaches. In the130
supplementary material, a brief description of the main regional features is131
included (Appendix B).132

The parameters that characterize the beach and will be used in the LST133
and CST computations are (see Section 3): the mean beach slope (tanβ), the134
median of the sediment grain size distribution (d50) and the mean beach orien-135
tation (γ) (see Figure SM3 of supplementary material). For the Catalan coast136
this information was acquired during beach profiling and sediment sampling137
field campaigns (CIIRC, 2010).138

In this study we assume that current values of tanβ, d50 and γ will remain139
valid into the future. This entails a limitation in the analysis because natural140
beaches gradually tend to re-adapt to changing wave conditions and they also141
might evolve forced by other drivers (e.g. sea level rise). However, major (long-142
term) changes in tanβ, d50 and γ are expected to be limited since the majority143
of the Catalan beaches are significantly engineered and/or human-controlled.144



Inter-model variability of projected future wave-driven coastal sediment transport 5

3 Methodology145

As mentioned in the Introduction, the effect of the sediment transport is sepa-146
rately assessed by means of the long-shore and cross-shore components, which147
usually act at different time scales and are controlled by different wave regimes.148
Long-shore sediment transport (LST) is modulated by the mean wave climate149
in a seasonal to decadal time frame. On the contrary, cross-shore sediment150
transport (CST) tends to occur at a shorter time scale. In this study, we only151
consider the beach erosion due to CST, which is an hourly to weekly pro-152
cess controlled by the extreme wave climate. The beach recovery that occur153
between storms is not assessed.154

Two widely used approaches to estimate the sediment transport are: (i)155
bulk transport formulas and (ii) process based models. The former are com-156
monly used in management or engineering applications and are based on sim-157
plified representation of pysical processes which use empirical coefficients. The158
latter are more detailed and include a large number of physical processes but159
need a large number of input parameters which need to be calibrated per160
application (Mil-Homens et al, 2013). In this study, we use the first type of161
empirical (physical-based) approach (ie. i) to compute both LST and CST (see162
Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively). With this approach, we can easily obtain a163
regional picture of the potential coastal impacts and evaluate their sensitivity164
to changes in the wave climate without significant computational cost. These165
empirical methods have certainly some limitations though. For example, de-166
spite reproducing a similar spatial pattern, CIIRC (2010)’s study showed that167
the choice of the LST formula can induce deviations of a factors 10. However,168
they did not apply the formula used in this study (see Section 3.1), which is169
recommended by Leont’yev (2014), as long as the size of the sediment does170
not change significantly along the profile. Anyway, the analysis of the results171
(Section 4) will not focus on the accuracy of punctual values but in the spa-172
tial performance, which can be properly assessed if the same methodology is173
consistently applied all along the coast.174

Recently some studies (Callaghan et al, 2013; Wu and Dong , 2015) have175
also accounted for the stochastic nature of the shoreline evolution by means of176
using a probabilistic approach. In the present study, however, we focus on the177
inter-model variability and we use a deterministic approach to compute LST178
and CST.179

3.1 Long-shore sediment transport (LST)180

As waves approach the coast, they break and generate a long-shore current181
which moves beach material parallel to the coast within the surf-zone. To182
estimate this transport we use the well-known CERC formula (see Eq.1) in183
which LST is proportional to the long-shore wave energy flux.184

where Q is the LST produced by the wave conditions at breaking defined185

mated in terms of wave and sediment properties, with the formula of Bayram191

where cf is the friction coefficient (cf = 0.005), γb the breaking index (γb =194
0.78), ws the sediment settlement velocity, Tp the peak wave period and ε195
the portion of wave energy effective to move the sediment. ws is estimated in196
terms of d50 using the formula of Jiménez and Madsen (2003). Mil-Homens et al197
(2013) proposed an improved Bayram formula but we prefer to use the original198
formula of Bayram et al (2007) because Mil-Homens’s proposed coefficient does199
not depend on the sediment properties. This could be explained by the fact200
that they used a dataset with 94% of the data points having D50 smaller than201
0.5 mm, which is not the case of the present study (see the D50 distribution202
along the Catalan coast in Figure SM3). In addition, Mil-Homens et al (2013)203
showed that, contrary to other formulations, the original formula of Bayram204
et al (2007) already presented a small bias.205

For each beach n, n = 1, ..., N (N the total number of beaches, N=299 in206
this study), the corresponding offshore forcing wave conditions are extracted207
from the wave projections described in Section 2, considering the nearest wave208
grid point m0 from those plotted in Figure 1. Particularly, we use the follow-209
ing wave parameters (at deep water): significant wave height Hs,0, mean wave210
direction θs,0 and peak wave period Tp,0. To obtain the conditions at break-211
ing, we use the linear wave propagation (Snell’s law) taking into account the212
refraction and shoaling processes and assuming a constant peak wave period213
(Tp,b = Tp,0). Instead of propagating every single value of the 30-year 3-hourly214
wave time series {Hs,0, θs,0, Tp,0} of each present/future time period obtained215
by each climate model, only a set of representative wave conditions are prop-216
agated and used to compute LST. Specifically, we divide the wave data into217
k groups: 8 directional sectors ∆θi, i = 1, ..., kθ (kθ = 8), of 45° each (N, NE,218
E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and 5 groups of Hs, ∆Hi, j = 1, ..., kH (kH = 5, [0–1,219
1–2, 2–3, 3–4, >4] m). Therefore, k = kθ · kH = 40. The LST associated with220
each group (Q∆Hj ,∆θi), is then computed using the following representative221
values: HRs,0 =[0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5] m, θ

315]°(in this study we use the Nautical convention for θ). The corresponding223
TRp,0 are obtained after averaging all period values for each group {∆Hj , ∆θi}224
(R stands for “representative”). As shown in Eq. 3, the annual (net) LST225
(Qannual) is finally obtained as the addition of all Q∆Hj ,∆θi values with the226
corresponding sign (positive from north to south, and viceversa). Also, they227

are respectively weighted by the frequency of occurrence of each wave group228

Q∆Hj ,∆θi(n) · f∆Hj ,∆θi(m0(n)) (3)

Note that i = kθ1(n), ..., kθ2(n) in Eq. 3, rather than i = 1, ..., kθ. This is230
to account only for the range of wave directions [θ1, θ2] that are effective to231
generate LST for a certain beach n. In this regard, kθ1 and kθ2 are obtained232
taking into account the beach orientation (γ) together with the nearby ob-233
stacles, such as coastal infrastructure or natural promontories. Additionally, a234
filter is added to LST computation—for beaches shorter than 1 km, directly235
Qannual = 0 since waves need a certain distance to generate significant LST236
rates.237

3.2 Cross-shore sediment transport (CST)238

At event or seasonal time scale, erosion/accretion can also occur due to CST,239
which governs the short term beach dynamics and encompasses both offshore240
and onshore transport. In this study, the effect on the CST is estimated by241
means of the beach erosion potential defined by Mendoza and Jiménez (2006)242
in terms of the eroded volume V . Using the beach profile evolution model243
SBEACH (Larson and Kraus, 1989), they obtained Eq. 4 to calculate V (in244
m3/m) of a certain beach profile with slope tanβ, caused by the impact of a245
wave storm with mean significant wave height Hs,0, mean peak period Tp and246
storm duration τ . Storms are defined with the peak over threshold method247
considering Hs > 2 m and τ > 6 h with additional duration requirements in248
order to select independent storms (Mendoza and Jiménez, 2006). Also, only249
those storms with a mean θm within the range of effective wave directions250
[θ1, θ2] (as for LST computation, see Section 3.1) are considered.251

V = 4.5[(D0 −D0,e)0.5τ tanβ] + 5.02, forD0 > D0,e (4)

where D0 is the Dean parameter for deep water:252

D0 =
Hs,0

(5)

and D0,e is D0 at equilibrium (D0,e = 2.7). As for LST computation, the253
deep water wave parameters are obtained using the wave grid points plotted254
in Figure 1 and ws is estimated in terms of d50 using the formula of Jiménez255
and Madsen (2003).256

For both the baseline and the future periods (and each model configura-257
tion), a time series of {V } is therefore obtained with Eq. 4. Afterwards, the258
(temporal) median of V and the cumulative value over the 30 years (Vcum)259

as the offshore grid points used to derive the forcing wave conditions.

associated with each simulation is used to analyse and compare the CST re-260
sults. The first parameter gives an idea of the average erosion given a storm261
episode. Vcum is the total volume of sediment lost over the 30 years and it is262
related to the rate of sediment exchange. During mild wave conditions, the263
beach would gradually restort the pre-storm beach profile. However, if severe264
erosion events are very frequent (which translates into a high Vcum), the beach265
might not be able to recover completely. As mentioned before, the recovery266
between storms due to on-shore sediment transport has not be taken into ac-267
count in this study. Therefore Vcum is not a real accumulated erosion but it268
indicates the total sediment lost in a 30-year time period that needs to be269
recovered between storms to be in equilibrium.270

4 Results271

In this section, results of LST and CST are presented and related to the driving272
wave climate changes, mostly to those occurring in the winter season. In spite273
of LST being estimated for the whole year, the most energetic winter waves274
are the ones that mostly contribute to the annual LST. Additionally, CST is275
controlled by the most extreme waves, which usually occur during winter.276

With special focus on the inter-model variability, for both LST and CST,277
the performance for the baseline period is assessed, first, and, afterwards, the278
climate change signals are examined.279

4.1 Long-shore sediment transport (LST)280

4.1.1 Baseline period281

Figure 1 illustrates the LST results for the present (baseline) period associated282
with the 5 combinations of RCM-GCM and HIPOCAS data (see Section 2.1).283



Inter-model variability of projected future wave-driven coastal sediment transport 9

Positive values (red colour) denote LST going from north to south (see arrow284
in Figure 1), whereas negative values (in blue) indicate the opposite result. Ex-285
cept for HIR E, the (spatial) 90 percentile of Qannual is below 100,000 m

3/year,286
which is a reasonable value for this area. Median (absolute) values range from287
7,000 m3/year (RCA E) to 38,000 m3/year (HIR E and REM E). The spatial288
pattern of HIPOCAS-driven LST is similar to that of RAC E, REM E and289
RCA H but with lower intensity.290

Except for HIR E (and RCA E to some extent), all models reproduce a291
general positive LST, which is in agreement with current observations (CIIRC,292
2010). Zonally, they also correctly reproduce the existing LST spatial pattern293
at the Ebre Delta, which is one of the factors that explains the current delta’s294
beach retreat (see Appendix B of supplementary material): negative(positive)295
LST rates north(south) of the river mouth (CIIRC, 2010). The Ebre delta,296
which river mouth is roughly located at the most eastward point, is mainly297
affected by marine erosional process since the Ebre river is highly regulated298
by dams which notably limits the sediment transport along the river (e.g.299
Vericat and Batalla , 2006). Also, the negative LST in some beaches south of300
Cape Salou that are sheltered from NE waves is well-captured. However, LST301
results are in general not very accurate (neither using HIPOCAS data) where302
the orography is very irregular like south of Cape Creus. The reason might303
be related to the LST computation and, more specifically, to the linear wave304
propagation. Even though the shadowing effect of obstacles like Cape Creus305
is introduced with the range of effective wave directions (see Section 3.1),306
neither the actual bathymetry is accounted for, nor complex wave propagation307
processes such as wave diffraction.308

Given the unrealistic LST spatial pattern obtained with HIR E for the309
baseline period, the associated RCM-GCM combination is considered not to310
be suitable to evaluate the future LST in the study area. With respect to the311
wave climate, HIR E already stood out from the other simulations as pointed312
out by Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013). However, the discrepancies in terms of313
Qannual are higher than in terms of the analysed wave parameters (for example,314
major discrepancies were not obtained in terms of the wave direction frequency315
distribution, see Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013)).316

Compared to other simulations, lower (absolute) values of Qannual are ob-317
tained for RCA E (especially for the positive range). This is in agreement318
with the lower median Hs obtained using this climate model configuration,319
that seems to be caused by the spatial-averaged forcing wind fields associated320
with this RCM (Casas-Prat and Sierra, 2013). However, the RCA H-driven321
wave climate, which produced even lower values of the median Hs due to be-322
ing forced by the same RCM as RCA E, has LST rates similar to RAC E and323
REM E (Figure 1). The reason for this result seems to be related to the dif-324
ferences in θm induced by the different driving GCMs: ECHAM5 for RCA E325
and HadCM3Q3 for RCA H. In particular, there is a larger fraction of waves326
coming from the east sector for RCA H-driven wave climate, which generally327
contributes to a positive LST along the Catalan coast (see Appendix A of328
supplementary material).329

4.1.2 Climate change signals330

Figure 2 illustrates the projected LST changes (difference between the future331
and the present Qannual) along the Catalan coast associated with each climate332
model. The location of each beach is plotted as a function of the distance along333
the coastline from the northernmost side, projected onto the x-axis. More than334
90% of the locations predict a change in Qannual below 30,000 m

3/year. With335
local exceptions, this change is positive for RAC E, RCA E and RCA H, and336
negative for REM E. Their spatial median relative changes are, respectively:337
42%, 43%, 7% and -47%.338

The increase of Qannual associated with RCA H (dark blue line) was ex-339
pected taking into account the general increase of the frequency of E waves340
(see Figure SM2 of supplementary material), which contribute to generate a341
positive LST. However, it is surprising to see how results corresponding to dif-342
ferent RCMs but the same GCM (RAC E, RCA E vs. REM E—red and cyan343
lines vs green line) have such a different response in terms of LST even though344
their projected mean wave climate change signal was similar (see Figure SM1345
of supplementary material). Indeed, Qannual changes associated with RCA E346
are surprisingly close to those of RCA H despite the large differences in the347
climate change signals of the corresponding wave direction field.348

RAC E, RCA E and REM E all project for winter more waves in the S-349
SW sector accompanied by fewer waves from the NE-E one (see Figure SM2350
of supplementary material). Superficially, this would seem to suggest a de-351
crease in the LST component, as obtained just for the REM E case. Here it352
is worth pointing out that the tendency of Qannual to decrease was also ob-353
tained by Casas-Prat and Sierra (2012) (see Introduction) when performing a354
trend analysis with the HIPOCAS data, which uses the same regional model355
as REM E (although driven by different global data) (see Section 2.1.2).356

To better understand LST changes, we need to get deep insight into the357
wave climate signals. On the one hand, we observe that predicted changes358

in the frequency of θm and the intensity of Hs for a given direction lead359
sometimes to competing effects, as similarly found out by Charles (2012).360
For instance, Figure 3 illustrates the relative change of the mean Hs during361
winter just for those waves coming from NE. Close to the Catalan coast, these362
waves are expected to be higher for RAC E and RCA E simulations, which363
may counteract the effect of having less waves coming from that direction (see364
Figure SM3 of supplementary material) and therefore producing an increase365
in Qannual for RAC E and RCA E, rather than a decrease. On the other hand,366
the high uncertainty of the extreme wave climate projections (see Figure SM1367
of supplementary material) might give rise to Qannual inter-model variability368
despite LST being a process mainly dominated by the mean wave climate. For369
example, z50 associated with REM E suffers from a notably more accentuated370
reduction than the other models, which further contributes to the Qannual371
reduction associated with REM E.372

Clearly, the inter-model variability is accentuated in terms of Qannual, if373
compared with that of the wave climate, especially the mean wave climate. For374
some areas, this variability can lead to important differences in the tenden-375
cies of erosion/accretion. At the Ebre delta, for example, REM E projects an376
increase(decrease) north(south) of the river mouth whereas RAC E predicts377
the opposite. Taking into account the present LST pattern, the later response378
would lead to an increasing rate of the delta’s beach retreat.379

Figure 4 shows the results of both the median of V (top) and Vcum (bottom) for382
the baseline period. Compared to Qannual, the inter-model variability is lower383
(especially for the median V ): the spatial pattern is more or less consistent384
among models (although with different magnitudes). The factors that seem385
to contribute to enlarge this agreement are the following. First, θm—that has386
a large degree of uncertainty in the context of climate projections, is not387

considered in CST computation (whereas it plays an important role for LST).388
Second, the fact of including the ratio between Hs and Tp—variables with389
a close relationship for wind-sea states—contributes to reduce the effect of390
model biases because they are highly correlated in this area due to the short391
fetches (Casas-Prat and Sierra, 2013).392

The (temporal) median of V has a spatial median between 16 m3/m and393
21 m3/m and the 90 percentiles are between 32 m3/m and 43 m3/m. The larger394
extreme values of the median of V are achieved by RCA H. Paradoxically,395
this RCM-GCM configuration simulates relatively low(high) median values of396
Hs(Tp) for stormy conditions (not shown) but their storms are on average397
longer, which highlights the strong dependence of V on τ . Results associated398
with REM E exhibit the second largest extreme values of the median of V (first399
ranking in the northern part of the coast), thanks to a combination of relatively400
high(low) values of Hs and τ(Tp) (for stormy conditions). HIPOCAS results401
show, in general, a low value of V (especially for extremes), having similar402
values to RAC E and RCA E. The similarity with these two models is more403
or less maintained in terms of Hs, τ and the number of storms but not for Tp404
(it is significantly larger for HIPOCAS). For example, the spatial median of405
Tp is 8.4 s for HIPOCAS whereas ranges from 7.7 s to 8.0 s for all the other406
models. Apart from having a different atmospheric forcing, which influences407



Inter-model variability of projected future wave-driven coastal sediment transport 13

this result, the disparity in terms of Tp particularly, can be related to the408
wave model used. As explained in Section 3, HIPOCAS was obtained with409
WAM, whereas the remaining wave projections were simulated with SWAN.410
Bolaños-Sanchez et al (2007) already found some discrepancies between these411
two wave models in terms of Tp (using the same forcing) and the recent study412
of Pallarès et al (2014) has pointed out that, for the study area, SWAN tends413
to underestimate Tp (comparing simulations with measurements).414

As aforementioned, the cumulative value (Vcum) shows a larger inter-model415
variability. This is the result of this parameter being largely affected by the416
number of storms, which exhibit a larger variability among models (especially417
between HIR E and the rest). HIR E clearly shows the larger values of Vcum418
because, apart from larger values of Hs for stormy conditions (not shown), it419
simulates a greater number of storms (in many locations, more than double of420
that of the other models). This result suggests that this model overestimates421
the cumulative erosion potential too. The second largest values of Vcum are422
obtained for REM E, that combines high values of τ and the number of storms423
(not shown).424

Another interesting conclusion can be yielded from these results: spatial425
variability is largely affected by morphological features and that might also426
explain the larger consistency of the spatial patterns among models. The two427
geomorphological parameters explicitly included in CST computation, Eq. 4,428
are tanβ and d50 and they are usually related: steeper beaches normally have429
coarser sediment and viceversa. Mendoza and Jiménez (2006) showed that,430
for the same storm, reflective beaches (d50 >= 0.6 mm and tanβ ∼ 0.1)431
had a larger erosion potential than dissipative beaches (d50 ∼ 0.25 mm and432
tanβ ∼ 0.01). On average terms, our results follow this tendency but this433
pattern is not always maintained as explained by Eq. 4. According to this434
equation, higher values of tanβ are associated with a greater erosion potential435
but d50 induces the opposite effect. Additionally—and this is an important436
limiting factor, for a given storm s, there is a maximum grain size that can437
be mobilized (say dmax.50 (s)) independently of the value of tanβ (in order to438
fulfil D0 > D0,e). This is reflected in the fact that, for example, beaches north439
of Barcelona—typically reflective, achieve both very low and very high values440
of the median of V (Figure 4). The first case occurs for beaches with a very441
coarse sand for which d50 > d

max.
50 (s) for many storms s. For beaches with finer442

sand, the threshold condition D0 > D0,e is fulfilled more often, enabling the443
role of tanβ. Actually, regressing tanβ against the median of V (not shown),444
we could see that high values of erosion potential are necessarily associated445
with relatively steep beaches but not the other way around (steep beaches can446
have a low erosion potential).447

Moreover, the coastal orography plays an important role through the range448
of effective wave directions (see Section 3.1). For example, despite the most449
energetic waves typically threatening the northern Catalan coast, compara-450
tively low values of Vcum are obtained along this coastal stretch because the451
rugged coastline offers shelter from high waves coming from many directions,452
reducing the number of storms capable to erode the beach.453

4.2.2 Climate change signals454

Figure 5 shows the projected future changes for both the median of V (top)455
and Vcum (bottom). To better understand the climate change signals, Figure 6456
illustrates the changes (difference between the future and the present period)457
found for the driving (stormy) wave conditions (from top to bottom): the458
median of Hs, Tp and τ and the number of storms (# storms).459

Along the coastline, most of the simulations oscillate between positive and460
negative changes for the median of V (especially for HIR E, REM E and461
RCA H) whereas there is a common tendency for Vcum to decrease (except462
for RCA E). In terms of the (temporal) median of V , the spatial median463
is positive only for RAC E (18%) and RCA E (11%) but close to zero for464
RCA H. Coastal areas showing a more or less consistent positive change for465
more than two RCM-GCM combinations are the central part of the coast north466
of Barcelona and the mid-southern part of the Ebre delta, which could enhance467
the current problems of beach retreat. Simulations driven by RAC E show the468
largest percentage of beaches for which the erosion potential rises for both469
the median of V and Vcum. This can be explained by the fact that this model470
configuration projects the largest increase in terms of Hs and τ (Figure 6), the471
latter representing a spatial median relative change of 23% (whereas the other472

two positive values are for RCA E and RCA H which amount to 4% and 1%,473
respectively).474

As aforementioned, Vcum has a general tendency to decrease (except for475
RAC E) but this reduction is accentuated for HIR E and REM E (Figure 5)476
with a spatial relative decrease of 24% and 38%, respectively. For HIR E re-477
sults, this can be mainly explained by a large reduction in the number of storms478
(spatial median relative change of -23%) and, for REM E, by both a reduction479
in the number of storms and τ (spatial median values of -29% and -13% respec-480
tively). All models present, indeed, a general decrease in the number of storms,481
with a median relative reduction of at least 11%. The tendency to decrease is482
observed not only for the effective number of storms (Figure 6) but also for483
the total number of storms (not shown), which is consistent with the reported484
decrease in the number of cyclones in the Mediterranean (Christensen et al,485
2007). Actually, a negative trend in the number of storms has already been486
observed in the Ebre delta between 1990 and 2006 using measured wave data487
(Sánchez-Arcilla et al, 2011).488

The pattern of change of Hs and Tp exhibit some discrepancies, consis-489
tent with the uncertainty stated in Christensen et al (2007) about whether490
or not the cyclones in the Mediterranean will be more intense in the future.491
Inter-comparing Hs and Tp, we confirm the different behaviour of RCA H (see492
Section 2.1.1), showing a notable tendency of Tp to increase whereas Hs mod-493
erately increases or even decreases. This is reflected in the spatial median of494
the relative change: 3.4% for Ts whereas 0.7% for Hs. This is in agreement with495
the fact that this model project a larger influence of swell waves, as explained496
in Appendix A of supplementary material. Despite Hs and Tp changes poorly497
contributing to enhance V in RCA H case, in some locations (central coast498
north of Barcelona or Ebre delta)) an increase of the median of V is found499
for this simulation. This can be explained by the rise of τ , pointing out the500
important role of this storm parameter for the erosion potential, as mentioned501
in Section 4.2.1.502

5 General discussion503

Coastlines respond to both mean and extreme wave climate characteristics504
and so assessing future changes must also consider the changes to both means505
and extremes. However, the representation of extreme climate characteris-506
tics is typically not well described by GCMs due to the limited spatial and507
temporal resolution of the models. Therefore, higher resolution climate mod-508
els simulations are usually downscaled using RCMs. As shown in this study,509
RCMs however add significant uncertainty in the coastal sediment transport510
responses.511

Casas-Prat and Sierra (2013) pointed out that discrepancies in the wind512
projections could be enhanced in terms of the wave climate due to the non-513
linear relationship governing the wind-sea states and the favouring character514
of certain fetch conditions. Nevertheless, except for winter wave extremes, a515



Inter-model variability of projected future wave-driven coastal sediment transport 17

large amount of the inter-model variability could be explained by GCMs. This516
study shows how the downscaling procedure from the regional wave climate to517
the local coastal dynamics further accentuates climate model biases and their518
inter-model variability, especially for LST, for which wave direction plays an519
important role. This result highlights that the local-regional scale response of520
coastline to the broader scale changes in climate is a challenging problem.521

The rise in the uncertainty can be partly explained by the non-linear rela-522
tionship governing the sediment transport processes, that can exaggerate the523
discrepancies present in the wave driving factors. Also, the problem is further524
complicated because not only one but a set of wave parameters have an im-525
portant role in coastal dynamics. For example, as observed by Charles (2012)526
in the LST changes along the Aquitanian coast (France), this study shows527
that for the Catalan coast as well, the expected changes in wave height and528
wave direction can lead to opposite changes in LST. This complexity makes529
difficult to predict beforehand the resulting net effect. In terms of CST, the530
general effect of the reduction in storms, which alone would be expected to531
reduce CST, can be countered by increased storm duration.532

In spite of the uncertainty, we think that this study’s results can serve as533
a guideline to locate and design further local assessment studies (e.g. beach534
retreat at the Ebre delta) that can afford the use of more accurate but com-535
putationally more expensive morphodynamic numerical models, like in the536
studies of He et al (2015) and Villaret et al (2013), who used DELFT3D and537
TELEMAC, respectively. The latter approach can give a better estimation of538
the present and future sediment transport rates and changes in the beach con-539
figuration, although they will still be affected by the variability in the driving540
wave projections. In this respect, further research is needed to try to reduce541
the variability in the future (forcing) projections.542

Finally, we think that if looking at the problem from a different perspective,543
LST and CST projections can bring additional value towards the assessment544
of the underlying RCMs and GCMs. Many studies have pointed out that the545
capability of climate models to properly reproduce the (atmospheric) climate546
system depends on the output variable or the physical aspect under evaluation547
(e.g. Kjellström et al, 2011). This is one of the reasons why it is, in general,548
so difficult to choose a “top” sub-set of climate models. Moreover, considering549
how uncertainty propagates to coastal impact parameters as shown in this550
study, it would be risky to establish a set of “best” climate models only based551
on their atmospheric or wave climate patterns. The decision whether or not to552
use a particular climate model to evaluate a certain impact should take into553
account explicitly the capability of that model to simulate a consistent spatial554
parameter of the mentioned impact. In this case, Qannual or V—parameters555
obtained with low computational effort, could be employed as an additional556
tool to check the use of RCMs and GCMs to assess coastal dynamics. For557
example, this study’s results suggest that RCM-GCM combination associated558
with HIR E is not valid to evaluate LST processes.559
