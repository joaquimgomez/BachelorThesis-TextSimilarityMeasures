Abstract 4 

Massive use of beaches has forced traditional management of these systems to focus on the 5 

service offer to users. Consequently, human activity and behavior prevailed over other biological 6 

and physical processes and functions. Mirroring this tendency, the use of Performance Awards 7 

(Blue Flag) and Environmental/Quality Management Systems (ISO 14001, EMAS, and Q of Quality) 8 

were popularized as standards of environmental quality. In parallel to this process, recent 9 

international coastal and marine policies have emphasized the need to develop sustainable 10 

strategies for implementing the principles of the Ecosystem Approach into management with the 11 

overarching goal to maintain ecosystem integrity while enabling the sustainable use of ecosystem 12 

goods and services in system under management. As Performance Awards and 13 

Environmental/Quality Management Systems do not follow the Ecosystem Approach, an 14 

Ecosystem-Based Management System for beaches (EBMS-Beaches) is introduced to overcome 15 

this issue. The EBMS-Beaches is intended as a formal standard framework that add new aspects 16 

not considered in a classical beach management by the introduction of the principles of the 17 

Ecosystem Approach, between them: a) a clear vision-driven process; b) a holistic approach from a  18 

geographical perspective; c) pressure analysis and institutional coordination inside clear 19 

participatory planning; d) use of risk management techniques in planning; e) the ecosystem 20 

service concept as the central piece of the system; f) use of the DPSWR as accountable framework 21 

of indicators, g) desired vision based on state indicators and using BQI partial indices; and h) 22 

timely participation by local population. The EBMS is structured along three pillars (managerial, 23 

informative and participatory pillars) working in an adaptive management way. Based on these 24 

three pillars, existing management practices can be standardized into a viable, systematic means 25 

of implementing, in an integrated way, the new international policies for beach social-ecological 26 

systems. An initial experience of EBMS implementation is a particular beach (S’Abanell beach, 27 

Girona-Catalonia, Northwestern Mediterranean) has been initiated and it is presented.  28

1. - Introduction 29 

The Ecosystem Approach emerged as the dominant paradigm for managing coastal and marine 30 

ecosystems (Olsen et al., 2009). New international policies emphasize the need to develop 31 

sustainable strategies for implementing the principles of ecosystem management ("Ecosystem 32 

Approach" -EA, "Ecosystem-Based Approach" -EBA, "Ecosystem-Based Management" -EBM three 33 

concepts considered similar according Farmer et al. (2012) that will be used indistinctly here). This 34 

approach offers new opportunities for sustainable use of the sea but requires better understanding 35 

of how marine social-ecological systems operate, how they generate goods and services, how well 36 

these benefits are captured and sustained, how human degradation of the systems affects human 37 

welfare and generates costs, and the complex social relations and value systems underpinning 38 

human governance of marine systems. In Europe for example, the achievement of Good 39 

Environmental Status (GEnS, following Borja et al., 2010, 2013) and sustainable use of marine 40 

ecosystems became primary objectives of the new Environmental Marine Policy of the Union 41 

(Marine Strategy Directive-MSFD [2008/56/EU]; Maritime Spatial Planning-MSP [2014/84/EU]). This 42 

new policy is aimed towards the achievement of a common vision and a holistic integrated approach 43 

using the Ecosystem Approach as its framework of reference. In the Mediterranean region, the 44 

"Mediterranean Action Program" (MAP) also has included the Ecosystem Approach as its basic 45 

marine strategic framework. While all countries belonging to the European Community supports its 46 

marine strategy, the MAP program has been ratified by 22 countries of the Mediterranean beyond 47 

their different political and social affinities (Cinnirella et al., 2014). All of this confirms the 48 

international support to the principles of the ecosystem approach at the level of policy and send a 49 

clear message of how it should be the future management of the coastal and marine environments. 50 

In practice, realities are a little bit different. Different guides and manuals have been developed to 51 

facilitate the implementation of these strategies (Shepperd, 2008; Ehler and Douvere, 2009; PISCES, 52 

2012) and several regulatory tools have been proposed (i.e. in Europe, MSFD, MSP and the 53 

Mediterranean Protocol of Integrated Coastal Zone Management-ICZM [2009/89/EC]), however, the 54 

application of the principles of the ecosystem approach into management and the use of its 55 

associated jargon is still confusing, makes its related type of management nebulous rendering it 56 

difficult to put into practice, and problems get accentuated by the complex institutional system that 57 

manage these environments, with very fragmented responsibilities and extremely reactive (Cormier 58 

et al., 2010;. Bainbridge et al., 2011; Sardá et al., 2014). All these issues and controversies can be 59 

seen i in present practices of beach management.  60 



3 
 

Beaches are social-ecological systems that play a key role in coastal environments.  Beaches play 61 

multiple functions, being three the most important ones: to act as natural reservoirs, to offer coastal 62 

protection, and to provide human recreation. A long list of ecosystem services is provided by these 63 

three assigned functions (Sardá, 2013). In the Mediterranean region, as in many other regions of the 64 

world, beaches constitute the main asset for the maintenance of the tourism industry and a clear 65 

relation between quality, user’s perception and economic valuation is found (Ariza et al., 2012a). 66 

Following such issues most of its public/private management has been developed around its 67 

recreational function and other functions observed in beaches have been just seen as a complement 68 

of the previous one and, in many cases, managed in a reactive way.   69 

During recent decades, in order to bring the best recreational attributes for beach users (clean sand 70 

for lying, clean water for bathing and the best services possible), environmental quality standards 71 

and environmental management systems have been widely used in beach management. Although it 72 

is clear that those frameworks improved the way in which beaches were managed, these schemes 73 

are far to applied the principles of the Ecosystem Approach. The introduction of the Ecosystem 74 

Approach in beach management arrangements would requires the incorporation in the used 75 

framework of a set of principles to ensure the inclusion of essential components such as 76 

participation, planning and decision-making, integration, promoting accountability and quality 77 

assurance, as well as a new jargon of concepts such as social-ecological systems, ecosystem 78 

functions and services,… (CBD, 1998; Balvanera et al., 2001; Cognetti and Maltagliati, 2010; Sardá et 79 

al., 2014).   To advance into the solution of this deficit, this paper presents the development of a 80 

new formal procedure for beach management, intended to be used in practice, the Ecosystem-81 

Based Management System for Beaches (EBMS-Beaches). The Ecosystem-Based Management 82 

System was recently developed as a formal standard management system to implement the 83 

Ecosystem Approach into the management of public goods (Sardá et al., 2014). It is one of the main 84 

outputs of the FP7 KnowSeas project (www.msfd.eu). The EBMS is an adaptive management system 85 

that combines the theory of environmental and risk management (Measham and Lockie, 2012) with 86 

the principles of ecosystem management (Farmer et al., 2012) and permit its application in a nested 87 

way at different spatial scales, whether national, regional, sub-regional or local. 88 

This paper describes the structural and operational components of this new management model 89 

(EBMS-Beaches). In its first section, the paper describes the evolution of beach management in 90 

Spain, a country that it has always distinguished itself by introducing innovative aspects in the 91 

management of beaches. In a second section we describe what the new system incorporates into 92 

previous managerial standard systems in order to introduce the EA principles. In the third section, 93

the EBMS for beaches is described and the applications of several internal tools to the beach of 94 

S’Abanell (Blanes-Girona, Spain) are used as examples. Finally, we present some general conclusions 95 

that we believe can make the EBMS sufficiently attractive for its use. 96 

 97 

2.- The development of beach management frameworks in Spain 98 

2.1.- From the initial services in beaches to the use of Environmental Managements Systems (EMS). 99 

In Spain, it was not until the end of the First World War when the first transformation of the pre-100 

tourism industry was observed, from low supply activities (spa-resorts) to the initial development of 101 

new specific generic types of tourism, which would result in the “sun and sand” tourism model 102 

during the second part of the century (a good analysis of this evolution can be found in Garay and 103 

Cànoves, 2010). The pre-fordist tourist phenomenon was then initiated and beaches become part of 104 

the human landscape like other areas of the territory. At that period, the ecosystem concept was 105 

not introduced in public management and only scattered services on beaches were disposed without 106 

considering these systems as natural resources of economic interest (Figure-1). 107 

Innovative beach management processes were initiated in Spain during the 1950s and 1960s 108 

following the long post war period after the Second World War. A new fordist stage of tourism was 109 

born and the preponderance of the “sun and sand tourist model” became a reality. The Spanish 110 

Coastal Act of 1969 established the so-called General Zoning Plan for beaches (PGOP) allowing to 111 

plan for services and facilities, and the first management guidelines were published for urban 112 

environments. During the 1970s Spain developed the "Indicative Plan for the Use of Public Domain" 113 

(PIDU) who had a great importance during the 1980s at the beginning of the Spain’s democratic 114 

transition (Figure-1). The green environmental movement was born during these decades and a 115 

change in the prevailing worldview of our relation with nature recognizing the need for a sustainable 116 

use of natural resources was introduced. 117 

The Sustainable Development concept globalized the environmental issues and the mainstreaming 118 

of environmental values within all sector and policies during the 1980s. The new Constitution of 119 

Spain (1978) promoted the development of a new Coastal Act (22/88) and its Reglament with the 120 

main focus in the protection of the coastal public domain. The management of beaches became 121 

more important but also more complex due to fragmentation of responsibilities between a bunch of 122 

local, regional, autonomic and central governments. Eco-labels emerged in mid 1980s, when the 123 



5 
 

crisis of mass tourism and the consequent pressure exerted on certain fragile resources as beaches 124 

was found. As a consequence of all these changes, concepts as sustainability, continuous quality 125 

improvements, impact assessment ... were introduced as references for beach management policies 126 

(Fraguell and Martí, 2013) and different Performance Standards such as the Blue Flag (voluntary eco-127 

lable award found in 49 world-wide countries) and  Environmental Management Systems such as the 128 

international European EMAS, the Global ISO 14001 or the Spanish Q of Quality were increasingly 129 

used in the management of beaches in Spain (Figure-1) (Ariza et al., 2008). Although Performance 130 

Standards and Environmental Management Systems are still widely used they are far of introducing 131 

the latest concepts of the internationally environmental policy that was initially developing at that 132 

time. 133 

<FIGURE 1> 134 

At the entrance into the new millennium, the World Summit on Sustainable Development of 135 

Johannesburg (2002) recommended the introduction of an Ecosystem-Based Management approach 136 

for coastal management advocating for a new social-ecological paradigm in its management 137 

processes (Figure-1). In the Mediterranean, the established legally binding mechanism of the 138 

Integrated Coastal Zone Management Protocol of the Mediterranean mirrored and reinforced the 139 

ideas of the Ecosystem Approach (Haines-Young and Poschin, 2011). Under these recommendations, 140 

beach management schemes should evolve. Beaches must be managed today as complex systems, 141 

moving into its sustainable use to guarantee socio-economic prosperity while maintaining the 142 

integrity of its natural components and its potential for the provision of ecological goods and 143 

services. Despite these ideas, during the last ten years we have not seen a substantial improvement 144 

in beach management processes, the new environmental policy is rarely applied and a deep gap is 145 

found between the theory of environmental policy and the practice of environmental management 146 

(Katsanevakis et al., 2011; Sardá et al., 2014). 147 

2.2.- The need of an Ecosystem-Based Management System in beach management (EBMS-Beaches) 148 

A management system is a systematic framework of policies, procedures and practices used to 149 

ensure that an organization can fulfil the tasks required to achieve its objectives. When objectives 150 

are related to environmental considerations such is the case of a natural environment like a beach, 151 

an Environmental Management System (EMS) is developed. On the other hand, the Ecosystem-152 

Based Management (EBM) has been defined as “an integrated approach to management that 153 

considers entire ecosystems, including humans. The goal of ecosystem-based management is to 154 

maintain an ecosystem in a healthy, productive and resilient condition so that it can provide the 155 



6 
 

services humans want and need” (COMPASS, 2005). EMS are useful frameworks through which 156 

organizations can reduce their environmental impact, improve their environmental performance and 157 

provide relevant information to the public and other interested parties. EBM constitute a set of 158 

principles and work as a framework for the application of the new international environmental 159 

policy. Used in conjunction, a possible evolution of an EMS could be viewed as a useful tool for 160 

implementing EBM. Another important aspect to be considered is the need to develop in 161 

management a kind of vision to be reached when managing a particular issue. In this case, 162 

management should be taken care and deal with all the associated risks that could impede and/or 163 

maintain this vision. Risk management systems (RMS) are widely used in different management 164 

constructs to deal with that (Cormier et al., 2013). We used all these ideas to develop a new 165 

intended standard tool, the Ecosystem-Based Management System-Beaches linking the EMS and 166 

RMS tools with the EBM framework for beach environments. 167 

To work with an EBM application, it would be necessary to incorporate into our used framework, the 168 

Ecosystem approach principles presented at the UNEP/CBD/COP/4/Inf.9 Conference and referred as 169 

the Malawi principles. Table-1 is listing such principles and dictating what these principles bring into 170 

the need of modifying present beach management practices. 171 

<TABLE 1> 172 

When they are compared, EMS/RMS frameworks tend to focus more on institutional management 173 

issues while EBM schemes are intended to focus more on an ecosystem management perspective. 174 

When putting all together preponderance should be given to the welfare mechanisms by which 175 

societies can benefit of a sustainable use of a natural resource while maintaining its integrity, both 176 

structural and functional. The concept of ecosystem services acquires a preeminent role in the 177 

functioning of the EBMS-Beaches. In addition, Elliott et al. (2006) emphasized that in order to 178 

develop one of those EBM frameworks, we should have a clear integration among the components 179 

of the ecosystems and resource uses and users, we must lead to a sustainable outcome, we should 180 

take clear precaution in avoiding deleterious actions and have a clear vision of change by developing 181 

and adaptive management approach; all of these aspects were cautiously applied in the EBMS-182 

Beaches. 183

3.1.- The Ecosystem-Based Management System (EBMS) 186 

With the final aim to create a comprehensive scientific knowledge base as a practical guidance for 187 

the application of the Ecosystem Approach to the sustainable development of Europe’s regional 188 

seas, the European project FP7-KnowSeas developed a suite of tools to assist policy makers and 189 

regulators with its practical application (legacy of the project can be seen in www.msfd.eu). The 190 

Ecosystem-Based Management System (EBMS) (Sardá et al, 2014) was one of these tools. The EBMS 191 

is based on a three pillar structure and intended to facilitate the integration of an ecosystem 192 

approach to coastal and marine policy development, regardless of the ecosystem or administrative 193 

scales.  194 

The managerial pillar is based on classical environmental and risk management systems that 195 

incorporate environmental considerations and objectives within a continuous improvement cycle of 196 

adaptive management. The managerial pillar is thought to be supported by governance structures 197 

that provide oversight and thereby ensure that planning and implementation activities adhere to 198 

modern environmental principles. The information pillar ensures that data and scientific advice are 199 

based on current knowledge, and the participation pillar brings together institutional coordination, 200 

communication and consultation requirements as indicated by the principles of the ecosystem 201 

approach (Sardá et al., 2014). Figure-2 (upper left) shows how these pillars work together in a 202 

continuous improvement loop-cycle path that is intended to bring a present social-ecological system 203 

situation to its desired vision for the future. 204 

<FIGURE 2> 205 

The conceptual thinking underpinning the EBMS is the combined use of well-established 206 

environmental and risk management systems (EMS-RMS), ISO 14001 (ISO, 2004) and ISO 31000 (ISO 207 

2009a; 2009b; 2009c) with a set of tools that allow to introduce in the framework all aspects needed 208 

to encompass the principles of the Ecosystem Approach (Table-1, left column).  As EMS/RMS 209 

frameworks can be used by whatever organization despite size, sectors or geographical locations, 210 

the EBMS is scalable and its structure can be adopted for any program of measures, from regional 211 

scale initiatives to local ones, and adapted to the different social-ecological systems under 212 

management. The use of the EBMS in beach social-ecological systems allow us to move towards a 213 

new integrated beach management system that could fill the gap produced during the last decade 214 

regarding the management of public goods. In order to apply the EBMS into EBMS-Beaches, the 215 

principles of the Ecosystem Approach were transferred into needs for beach management (Table-2 216 

right column). 217 

http://www.msfd.eu/

3.2.- The EBMS-Beaches: application to the S’Abanell beach case study. 218 

The theoretical foundation of this academic work consists of three pillars working together in an 219 

adaptive management way with the final aim to reach a desired vision for the beach social-ecological 220 

system under management. While the first pillar helps to get an understanding of the management 221 

mechanism applied (managerial pillar), the second one provides much value added from an 222 

information context (information pillar) establishing all indicators that will be used by the system. 223 

The third pillar defines the ways in which participation of stakeholders is regulated in the framework 224 

(participatory pillar). By looking all three of them from a theoretical pint of view, it is possible to 225 

grasp certain elements that are especially important for achieving project’s objectives. The 226 

methodology presented is in validation at S’Abanell beach located in the bay of Blanes (NW 227 

Mediterranean Catalan Coast, Spain) (Figure-3). This does not want to say that the entire EBMS 228 

framework is in use now but several of the applicable tools have been proven and a good 229 

relationship with the managerial institutions in charge of the beach has been obtained which 230 

facilitate pilot studies and tool checking.  231 

<FIGURE 3> 232 

S'Abanell beach is the northern landmass emerged zone of the Tordera River delta (Figure-3). During 233 

the last four decades, S’Abanell beach have been suffering significant erosive processes due to man-234 

made activities aggravated by periodic episodes of droughts that reduced drastically the sediment 235 

supply from the Tordera River. Today, the occasional wetland developed at the mouth of the 236 

Tordera river is nowadays put in danger by the retreat of sediment supply by the river. A description 237 

of the S’Abanell beach evolution can be found in Lozoya et al. (2011) and Sardá et al. (2013). 238 

Historical cartography of this region can be obtained back to the year 1611 (ICC, 2005) indicating 239 

abundant information on this area. The general erosive process and retreat has contributed recently 240 

to the failure of S’Abanell beach as a supplier of several ecosystem services due to the non-241 

fulfilment of its protective and recreational function. At the mouth of the River, in the southern tip 242 

point of the beach, a coastal lagoon is sometimes formed allowing a wetland area which has been 243 

awarded under the distinction of Natura 2000 site following European regulation. 244 

3.2.1. Visioning phase (establishing the context) 245 

The first task to be accomplished is the establishment of the foundation for the EBMS-Beaches. 246 

Defining the social-ecological system under management (unit of analysis, in this case the beach of 247 

S’Abanell) will identify the targeted geographical area. After having delimited the unit, an initial 248 



9 
 

assessment report should be drafted to develop a common understanding of the system. The 249 

assessment allows us to compile and synthesize all the relevant information for this particular unit 250 

that becomes necessary for its correct management. The assessment also let us knows about the 251 

pressuring factors on the system and the related stakeholders to be considered. The objective of the 252 

report is to comprehensively describe the major features of the unit that must be used sustainably, 253 

the human activities which must be managed within it and the major interactions among the unit 254 

features and the human activities observed there. The report is intended to provide managers with a 255 

better understanding of the social-ecological actions and relationships in the selected unit as well as 256 

to inform the public and other stakeholders about the “status quo” of the system and the pressures 257 

it is receiving. The visioning phase constitute the starting procedure to implement the information 258 

and participatory pillars to build interest, expand participation and create settings for actors to come 259 

are part of its work. As a final task, the visioning phase should develop the desired vision to be 260 

reached and a set of overarching goals with a potential measuring mechanism. These overarching 261 

goals must be presented as indicators of “State” following classical Driver-Pressure-State-Welfare-262 

Response (DPSWR) accounting framework (Cooper, 2013). 263 

In the case of S’Abanell beach, we have a large amount of information in form of scientific papers 264 

and grey literature (doctoral thesis, environmental impact assessment reports, nourishment 265 

technical studies…). The analysis of this information constitutes the initial assessment report 266 

obtained for the beach (a tool demanded by the EBMS, Sardá et al., 2014). Based on all this 267 

information and expert judgment criteria we develop our desired vision for this beach to be: a) to 268 

recover a width of, at least, 30m all over its length within a stable beach profile in order to ensure 269 

that the beach can develop its protective and recreational functions, and b) to maintain the natural 270 

integrity of the wetland found in the mouth of the River to allow the accomplishment of its 271 

preserved natural function.   272 

3.2.2. Managerial pillar 273 

The managerial pillar was developed with the same structure of an EMS ISO 14011-type. It followed 274 

the five main elements of the Deming cycle loop: policy baseline, planning preparedness, 275 

implementation and operation, checking and corrective actions, and management review (Deming, 276 

1986). These elements were then adapted to work with the principles of the Ecosystem Approach 277 

following Table-1.  Presently used EMS tools applied to beaches can be easily modified and adapted 278 

to the changes required by and ecosystem-based approach by modifying some of the required 279 

clauses as a consequence of having introduced the ecosystem-based management jargon, notably 280 



10 
 

clause A.3.2. (Social-ecological key aspects), A.3.4 (Risk management programs), and A.6. 281 

(Management review).  Table-2 listed the different clauses observed in this pillar through the above 282 

commented steps (a much detailed explanation can be found in Sardá et al. (2014) and 283 

www.msfd.eu. 284 

<TABLE 2> 285 

The selection of the key social-ecological aspects in the planning phase will be carried out using risk 286 

management techniques (Figure-4). A Risk Management framework using the ISO 31000:2009 Risk 287 

Management Standard is used for this job. The work to be done is related with the identification of 288 

those aspects (human activities and behavior, natural hazards,) pressuring the littoral unit under 289 

management. After risk identification and environmental risk profile will be done providing the most 290 

up-to-date knowledge of the risks and its environmental effects, causes and consequences. The 291 

assessment will inform the decision-making process preparing a risk evaluation of management 292 

strategies to eliminate, reduce or mitigate risks including the costs and benefits of the 293 

implementation and evaluating options for feasibility and effectiveness. Once this is done, the risk 294 

management plan is developed (goals, targets and objectives) and it will be implemented by a series 295 

of actions that will be included in the risk management program. The further implementation and 296 

operation phase, as well as the checking and corrective measure phase will not change too much 297 

from what it is normally seen in an ISO 14001 application besides the fact that new jargon is 298 

introduced and new monitoring requirements highlighted. 299 

<FIGURE 4> 300 

The management of environmental issues is usually linked to chains of cause and effect. These cause 301 

and effect issues are the ones that can put us in danger of not reaching and/or not maintaining the 302 

desired state. In order to practicing these previous ideas, a proposed methodology was developed 303 

using S’Abanell beach as example (Lozoya et al., 2011). The methodology used the risk management 304 

framework (ISO 31000) in which coastal hazards and beach ecosystem services were jointly 305 

considered. The definition of the risk profile and the assessment of identified risks was done by 306 

building the beach Pathway of Effect, where links between coastal hazards with ecosystem services 307 

were identified following a DPSWR approach (Cooper, 2013); the second phase (risk evaluation)  308 

including risk valuation and hazard prioritization followed previous work. Figure-2 shows the scheme 309 

of this tool in the planning phase of the managerial pillar. In its application to S’Abanell beach 310 

(Lozoya et al., 2011) River floods and storm-induced floods were the riskiest hazards and the 311 

disturbance regulation ecosystem service the most affected one. When these events are related to 312 

http://www.msfd.eu/


11 
 

the present states of beach social-ecological components, beach width becomes the most acute 313 

problem that should be prioritized in S’Abanell beach.  314 

The DPSWR accounting framework for analysis is used (Cooper, 2013). In this accountability, aspects 315 

are analytically structured along pressures, which are caused by one or multiple drivers resulting in 316 

changes in the state of the social-ecological system components. These changes may lead to welfare 317 

changes in the societal use of ecosystem goods and services and it require some type of response. 318 

These responses are the ones that will be translated into the management program designed to 319 

eliminate, mitigate or compensate pressures related to drivers of human activities, and to control 320 

drivers coming from natural events and/or hazards, both of them with the purpose of avoiding 321 

potential environmental negative effects.  322 

The final management review is an essential part in the continual improvement of the management 323 

system. As an adaptive management tool, the EBMS needs periodic reviews to analyze the distance 324 

with its desired vision and to incorporate new scientifically and technical knowledge, and sometimes 325 

even to re-analyze our own vision. The final review of a loop cycle will be connected with the 326 

planning phase of the next cycle establishing the main context in which the next risk identification 327 

and prioritization of programs should be carried out. 328 

3.2.3. Information pillar 329 

An essential requisite for correct environmental management is the compilation and analysis of 330 

exhaustive environmental information. The information pillar must provide the managerial pillar 331 

with user-friendly tools to facilitate the flow of information into the decision making process. In the 332 

EBMS, the information pillar is structured into an Information Factory with two main support tools: a 333 

Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) following standard procedures, and a platform of indicators 334 

accessible to be used in the system at any time.  335 

Coastal and marine SDI are no longer a novelty, they are well reported in existing literature and are 336 

acknowledged to be a key element in improving the management of these areas (Drapeau, 2008; 337 

Cinnirella et al., 2011). S’Abanell beach is the shoreline unit under management but it is being 338 

influenced by processes occurring at a much wider territorial area. A cartographical representation 339 

of the boundary delimitations of all this area is advisable to understand major events than can occur 340 

in the zone of management (Balaguer et al., 2008). 341 



12 
 

Concerning the platform of indicators, for clarity the EBMS employs the DPSWR social-ecological 342 

accounting framework to organize the information on aspects that are relevant to represent the 343 

interactions between them (Cooper, 2013). This accounting framework is utilized by the risk 344 

management tools used in the planning phase of the management pillar and it is also used in the 345 

initial assessment and at the revision phase of each management cycle. In the case of beach 346 

environments, “State” indicators of the different identified beach functions and sub-functions were 347 

compiled to form a composite index based on function analysis called the Beach Quality Index-BQI 348 

(Ariza et al., 2010). The BQI (Figure-5) includes thirteen partial indices divided into the three main 349 

functions of the beach (recreational, natural and protective functions) that gave place to three sub-350 

indices too. Each partial index provides a quality of value of its represented state. All values (index, 351 

sub-indices and partial indices) scores from 0 (worst situation) to 1 (best situation). These indicators 352 

of state will also drive the implementation of the risk management program through the 353 

implementation and operation and the checking and corrective measure phases.  354 

<FIGURE 5> 355 

State indicators are the ones that will be used to measure the distance to the desired vision. The 356 

thirteen partial indices computed in the BQI can serve as a Balance Scorecard for the management 357 

of the beach system. An assessment of these values was performed in S’Abanell beach during 358 

summer 2005 and 2006 (Ariza et al., 2010). Obtained values gave a global score of 0.67; the analysis 359 

of the different partial indices assessed told us that we were not having the desired vision for the 360 

beach.  From 2007 to 2009, three nourishment processes were carried out in S’Abanell beach 361 

(180.000 m
3
 in November 2007; 144.000 m

3
 in May 2008; and 250.000 m

3
 summer of 2009, Sardá et 362 

al., 2013). Besides these nourishment processes the geomorphological condition of the beach only 363 

has improved slightly; the protective partial index that gave a value of 0,31 in summer 2006 was 364 

computed as 0,33 in February 2014 (beach width at that time can be seen by transects in Figure-3). 365 

3.2.4. Participatory pillar 366 

The third pillar of the EBMS is aimed to facilitate societal participation, an element required in the 367 

Ecosystem Approach. Participation means active involvement of the actors (people influencing and 368 

affected by management actions). In order to implement a well-structured functioning of the EBMS-369 

Beaches, it is necessary to work with an effective governance structure and to identify and involve 370 

its main actors. In addition, the Ecosystem Approach requires the adoption of a holistic attitude from 371 

a geographic perspective, beach environments cannot be isolated from the watershed and marine 372 

environment that are forming them which yield to institutional complexities and fragmented 373 



13 
 

responsibilities derived from its management. The effective governance structure will require 374 

significant cooperation amongst governments; civil society and private interests in the need of a 375 

collective action, and this participatory pillar should facilitate this work in order to overcome the 376 

barriers imposed by administrative procedures. 377 

The participatory pillar of the EBMS accomplished three main tasks: a) facilitation of stakeholder 378 

identification, b) allowing effective participation and conflict resolution, and c) enhancing 379 

capacitation.  Tools are available for the identification of stakeholders (e.g. Sanó 2009, Bainbridge et 380 

al. 2011), and initiatives to generate informed networks of stakeholders are beginning to emerge. 381 

The visioning phase (initial assessment) of the EBMS-beaches identifies these actors and this list 382 

should be maintained through the revision steps. 383 

Participation should require institutional coordination of all national, regional and local authorities 384 

competent in the littoral unit managed as well as society involvement. The EBMS-Beaches 385 

implementation can be hampered by the complexity and potential conflicting jurisdictional policy 386 

objectives of the various arms and levels of government. In this case a lack of coordination can imply 387 

governance failures and can create conflicts between these different administrative institutions and 388 

between these institutions and civil society. In the case of S’Abanell beach different offices have 389 

different responsibilities and the complexity is amplified by the land-based interactions located in 390 

the Tordera catchment area and its urban environment as well as several policy objectives that may 391 

not align with the beach integrity. The Blanes municipality manage all services associated to the 392 

beach, the Regional Government (Autonomous Community of Catalonia) has two different 393 

“Consellerias” (Community Ministries) involved. The Ministry of Territory and Sustainability has the 394 

Coastal Service Unit managing licensing of beach activities and the Water Catalan Agency (a 395 

private/public institution) deals with the management of the Tordera watershed and it is responsible 396 

of managing in Catalonia the Water Framework Directive. On the other hand, the Catalan Ministry of 397 

Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, Food and Natural Environment have the responsibility to manage 398 

the Natura 2000 site of the mouth of the Tordera River. Finally the Central Government of Spain 399 

(Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment) through its Coastal General Directorate manage the 400 

Public Marine Domain regulated by the Spanish Coastal Act and it is in charge of the Marine 401 

Framework Strategy Directive. The tremendous amount of complexity involved in this structure 402 

without any supra-municipal beach office and without any clear managerial leadership is the main 403 

obstacle for a correct implementation of the EBMS-Beaches today, however, the use of the EBMS-404 

Beaches framework could introduce a common language and a common set of procedures 405 

facilitating dialogue, coordination, and capacity building between the different offices involved. 406 



14 
 

Public engagement in coastal management was highlighted as an essential component of ICZM 407 

activities (Ernoul, 2010; Lozoya et al., 2011; Areizaga et al., 2012). Public participation is encouraged 408 

but practicing of this engagement is rare. The introduction of the Ecosystem Approach in beach 409 

management obliges to accommodate and prioritize needed public services but also to take care 410 

about the different social-ecological activities and events that are observed in the beach. At that 411 

level, the participation of users and agents with economic interest in the system need to be 412 

guarantee. To assess beach user’s motivations, expectations and priorities, a survey based 413 

questionnaire is recommended to be used during the bathing season in the EBMS-Beaches. An 414 

example about this questionnaire can be found in Lozoya et al., 2014 for S’Abanell beach. 415 

Concerning agents with economic interest, innovative schemes for linking public and private efforts 416 

to protect social-ecological systems by ensuring the provision of ecosystem services are becoming 417 

more and more used today involving “payment for ecosystem services” schemes (Wendland et al., 418 

2009; Farley and Costanza, 2010; Farley et al., 2010) or just raising tables for discussion.  419 

Finally, the participatory pillar should enhance manager and societal capacitation. Raising a web 420 

portal where people can find enough information systems under management is appreciated. The 421 

EBMS standard tool has today one of this tools in operation, a visit can be done at www.msfd.eu  422 

 423 

4.- Discussion. 424 

Massive use of beaches has forced traditional management of these systems to focus on the service 425 

offer to users. Consequently, human activity and behavior prevailed over other biological and 426 

physical processes and functions that are normally managed in a reactive way. Mirroring this 427 

tendency, the use of Performance Awards and Environmental Management Systems (EMS) were 428 

popularized as standards of environmental quality. Although EMS has proven to be a good tool for 429 

improving beach management processes, its promotional benefits are hardly visible in the eyes of 430 

typical mass tourism and for this reason many coastal managers preferred to combine both type of 431 

certifications (performance awards and EMS) as complementary (Fraguell and Martí, 2013). 432 

However, these standard tools do not reflect the new principles of the environmental policy 433 

recognized in the international coastal and marine regulation. The change towards the requested 434 

ecosystem management approach constitutes a social challenge today; it is not seen in practice and 435 

should involve not only local managers and formal stakeholders, but also the civil society (Ariza et 436 

al., 2012b).  The application of the EBMS for beach social-ecological systems is aimed to facilitate 437 

such integration. 438 

http://www.msfd.eu/


15 
 

The EBMS is aimed to be a standard adaptive management methodology to assist coastal and 439 

marine environments by introducing a common set of tools and procedures and a common language 440 

that can be useful for facilitating knowledge transfer and capacity building when applied to beaches. 441 

The EBMS-Beaches is aimed to fill the gap between the present theory of environmental policy and 442 

present beach management practices.  The EBMS for beaches is scalable, can be hierarchically 443 

introduced at different spatial scales and this could facilitate the institutional coordination needed 444 

to solve the problem of policy fragmentation and differentiated responsibilities (Cormier et al., 445 

2010). The EBMS-Beaches can be considered as a quality assurance tool by itself being used in a 446 

vision-driven process of continuous improvement which makes it necessary to reach a societal 447 

consensus for the desired future conditions of the beach environment under management. Although 448 

we are just introducing the idea, the EBMS-Beaches potentially could also work (as other standards 449 

do) with the possibility to allow certification if promoting circumstances become important. 450 

Although the implementation of Environmental Management Systems enhanced the achievement of 451 

sustainable outcomes in the management of beaches, this enhancement was mainly focused in the 452 

environmental quality for its recreational function. The use of the EBMS-Beaches will allow us to 453 

manage together, in an integrated way, the different functions of the beach environment and the 454 

ecosystem services they provide. The EBMS add new aspects not considered in a classical EMS 455 

framework: a) beach management is part of a clear vision-driven process; b) beach management 456 

adopts a holistic approach from a  geographical perspective; c) it requires pressure analysis and 457 

institutional coordination inside clear participatory planning; d) planning is obtained through the use 458 

of risk management techniques; e) the concept of ecosystem service is a central piece of the system; 459 

f) beach management use the DPSWR as its analytical accountability framework of indicators, g) 460 

good final state is based on “state” indicators using BQI partial indices (Ariza et al., 2010); and h) it 461 

ensures timely participation by local population. Although the EBMS-Beaches can be seen as an 462 

evolvement of previous EMS systems, there are enough aspects that make this new system 463 

different. The structure of the EBMS and all related jargon was uploaded into a web platform tool 464 

(www.msfd.eu) to facilitate training and capacitation, something similar for beaches would be of 465 

great help.  466 

The use of management systems and certifications ensures that importance is given to the territorial 467 

presence of beaches. It is sad to see how geographical areas as beaches what are considered 468 

essential economic assets are not properly managed.  By the understanding of the role of 469 

stakeholders in capturing the benefits obtained from ecosystem good and services of beaches, we 470 

can discuss better arguments for the recognition of possible additional governance costs of the new 471 

http://www.msfd.eu/


16 
 

adaptive management system supporting the EBMS-Beaches tool, including transaction costs, the 472 

cost of monitoring and dynamic economic effects. It is clear that beaches play a key role in the 473 

maintenance of the Tourism Industry in Spain, an essential sector for the economic welfare of the 474 

country as the present economic crisis has shown (Sardá and Fluvià, 1999; Sardá, 2001).  Yepes 475 

(2004) described how the 0,001% of the Spanish surface (beaches that holds the “sun and beach” 476 

tourism model), are indirectly responsible of more than 10% of the Spanish Gross Domestic Product. 477 

Consequently, in Spain beaches should be considered to be one of the country’s major assets.  The 478 

recreational service of the Lloret de Mar central beach (1.3 km; 5.6 ha, located 5 km north of the 479 

S’Abanell beach) was assessed using the Travel Cost Methodology (TCM) as a valuation technique 480 

(Ariza et al., 2012a). We obtained an annual value of 73.8 million Euros for this beach just as its 481 

direct use. At that time, 19% of this money (13.4 million Euros) went into taxes received by the 482 

different administrations involved. The results also show the important gap between investments 483 

made by coastal managers (less than 1 million Euros for all municipal beaches of this town during 484 

the analyzed year) and users’ economic valuation (73.8 million Euros year as a direct use). With all 485 

these data, the value per meter square of the central beach of Lloret de Mar was computed as 1320 486 

Euros and its annual value per ha on 13.2 million Euros. We do not have the same values for 487 

S’Abanell beach, however, even if we assume that we can talk about half of the value per meter 488 

square (Lloret de Mar is one of the most popular beaches in Catalonia while S’Abanell is a normal 489 

one), the amount of money entering into the public finances as a consequence to have the beach is 490 

enormous when compared on the money spent on it. Ignorance of these numbers put in risk even 491 

the presence of beaches in the future in a constant tendency of accelerated erosion process, and 492 

today, no accountability is obtained by any management process.  493 

The theoretical work done in S’Abanell about the main risks at the beach yielded the present width 494 

of the beach as the most notable state indicator to focus management activities. This is something 495 

that present management systems are not able to detect in a formalized way. The EBMS-Beaches, as 496 

it is integrated, has the potential to prioritize the most important aspects going on in the beach and 497 

it obliges coastal managers to know it and to deal with that. In this sense, it would be appreciated if 498 

Administrative offices could lead a program of advice and support to enhance the use of 499 

environmental certification of beaches for integrated management and sustainability of the coast 500 

that could be based in the new environmental policy where the EBMS-Beaches could play a major 501 

role. 502 

 503

5.- Conclusion. 504 

The new European coastal and marine policy, as well as the Mediterranean Action Plan, uses the 505 

Ecosystem Approach as its framework of reference, a management concept that focuses on the 506 

relationship between human society and the ecosystems that supports it. It is necessary to bring this 507 

approach into practice and fill the gap between theory and practice. In order to bridge this gap we 508 

have described the EBMS (Sardá et al., 2014) as a new management standard system. This 509 

management scheme it is easily applicable for beaches. Due to the large economic importance that 510 

beaches have for the economy of different countries on its relationship with Tourism activities, we 511 

believe that we need the most rapid transition possible into this type of new management standards 512 

that can facilitate the correct management of social-ecological systems today. 513

CBD Ecosystem Approach principles 
 

Beach management needs 

1) The objectives of management of land, water 
and living resources are a matter of societal 
change 

 Use participatory planning: appropriate management schemes should 
adequate timely participation in a  transparent decision-making process 
by local populations. 

 Adopt a holistic way from a geographic perspective: beach environments 
cannot be isolated from the watershed and marine environment that is 
forming them.  

2) Management should be descentralized to the 
lowest appropriate level 

 Effective governance structure should be developed  to guide 
implementation 

3) Ecosystem managers should consider the 
effects (actual or potential) of their activities on 
adjacent and other ecosystems 

 Social-ecological dynamics and functioning of the beach should take 
care  about the interdependency between the land and the 
marine/freshwater parts forming a  single entity. 

 All elements relating to the hydrological, geomorphological, climatic, 
ecological, socio-economic and cultural systems should eb taken into 
account ina n integrated matter, not exceeding carrying capacity and 
preventing negative effects of natural disasters and development. 

4) Recognizing potential gains from management, 
there is usually a need to understand and 
manage the ecosystem in an economic context 

 Accommodate and prioritize public services needed, but also taking care 
about the multiplicity of social-ecological activities/events  that are 
observed on beaches. 

5) Conservation of ecosystem structure and 
functioning, to maintain ecosystem services, 
should be a priority target of the Ecosystem 
Approach 

 The concept of ecosystem services should be central in the management 
of beaches following the new environmental policy 

6) Ecosystems must be managed within the limits 
of their functioning 

 Beach management should work taking care of natural processes and 
adopting a long-term perspective 

 Damage to the beach environment shall be prevented and, where it 
occurs, appropriate restoration shall be effected. 

7) The Ecosystem approach should be 
undertaken at the appropriate spatial and 
temporal scales 

 Beach management frameworks should be taken into consideration 
when plans and programs for urban development or sectorial policies 
evolve. Development of these policies can have an effect on the beach 
environment and this need to be analyze. 

8) Recognizing the varying temporal scales and 
lag-effects that characterize ecosystem 
processes, objectives for ecosystem 
management should be set for the long term 

 Beach management should be part of a vision-driven process. 
 The final idea is to align this management with the obtention of a 

sustainable development for the zone around the beach. 

9) Management must recognize that change is 
inevitable 

 
Adaptive management should be implemented to recognize change. 

 

10) The Ecosystem approach should seek the 
appropriate balance between, and integration 
of, conservation and use of biological diversity 

Depending of the particular case and specificities of the beach under 
management, natural functions of the beach should allocate the 
presence and use of biological diversity 

11) The Ecosystem approach should consider all 
forms of relevant information, including 
scientific and indigenous and local knowledge, 
innovations and practices 

 An information system should be developed to guide decision-making 
and monitoring in the management process. 

12) The Ecosystem approach should involve all 
relevant sectors of society and scientific 
disciplines 

 Institutional coordination of the various administrative services and 
regional and local authorities competent in coastal zone should be 
required. 

 Appropriate effective governance structure needed.
