Abstract The potential impacts of tsunamis along the Catalan Coast (NW Mediterranean)
are analysed using numerical modelling. The region is characterized by moderate to low

seismic activity and by moderate- to low-magnitude earthquakes. However, the occurrence

of historical strong earthquakes and the location of several active offshore faults in front of

the coast suggest that the possibility of an earthquake-triggered tsunami is not negligible

although of low probability. Up to five faults have been identified to generate tsunamis,

being the highest associated possible seismic magnitudes of up to 7.6. Coastal flooding and

port agitation are characterized using the Worst-case Credible Tsunami Scenario Analysis

approach. The results show a multiple fault source contribution to tsunami hazard. The

shelf dimensions and the existence of submerged canyons control the tsunami propagation.

In wide shelves, waves travelling offshore may become trapped by refraction causing the

wave energy to reach the coastline at some distance from the origin. The free surface water

elevation increases at the head of the canyons due to the sharp depth gradients. The effects

of potential tsunamis would be very harmful in low-lying coastal stretches, such as deltas,

with a high population concentration, assets and infrastructures. The Ebro delta appears to

1 Introduction

Tsunamis pose a very low-probability but potentially high-risk natural hazard, which may

have catastrophic effects in coastal areas, damaging assets and even generating casualties.

There are areas of intense seismic activity where this risk is evident and where authorities

and population are aware of it. The 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean triggered the

development and implementation of early warning systems (see Papadopoulos 2016 for a

review), evacuation plans (UNESCO-IOC 2009; Scheer et al. 2012) and inundation maps.

Nevertheless, there are other areas where although the seismic activity is frequent, it is of

low intensity so that most earthquakes have not enough energy to generate tsunamis. In

these areas, although strong earthquakes may have been recorded in the remote past, the

perception of tsunami risk does not exist despite the fact that, although very low, the

probability of having one of these events cannot be neglected. In particular, in densely

populated regions, with extensive infrastructure and industrial facilities along the coast, the

vulnerability to flooding by tsunamis is very high and therefore even low-probability or

long-recurrence events need to be assessed.

About 300 descriptions of tsunami and similar phenomena are known for the

Mediterranean Sea (Soloviev et al. 2000). The areas more struck by tsunamis are located in

eastern and central regions, like the coast of insular Greece and the coast of southern Italy.

Meanwhile, the western Mediterranean coast has also been historically impacted by tsu-

namis, but the generated waves were more moderate or less documented than the ones

reported in the eastern part of this region (Gailler et al. 2013). Besides this, in western

Mediterranean some tsunamis related to earthquakes with epicentres near the coast of

Algeria (Tinti et al. 2005a; Kherroubi et al. 2009) or the French Riviera (Scotti et al. 2004)

have been generated.

Most of the earthquake-induced tsunami studies in the Mediterranean have focused on

the reconstruction of specific past events with the main purpose of constraining the

earthquake source parameters (e.g. Tinti and Piatanesi 1996; Piatanesi and Tinti

1998, 2002; El-Sayed et al. 2000; Alasset et al. 2006; Gutscher et al. 2006). Others have

used hypothetical or inferred earthquake source parameters for constructing tsunami sce-

narios (e.g. Pelinovsky et al. 2002; Tinti et al. 2005a; Álvarez-Gómez et al. 2011). There

are also tsunami simulations oriented to both tsunami risk estimation and forecasting. In

this regard, tsunami hazard in a certain area can be computed adopting different approa-

ches like the Worst-case Credible Tsunami Scenario Analysis (WCTSA) or the Proba-

bilistic Tsunami Hazard Analysis (PTHA). According to Tonini et al. (2011), PTHA seems

more exhaustive and more informative than WCTSA, but PTHA requires more input data

and computational effort and its use in case of lack of data may be questionable. Examples

of application of WCTSA are Tinti et al. (2005a); Titov et al. (2005); Lorito et al. (2008);

Tonini et al. (2011). The PTHA approach has been used by Tinti et al. (2005b); Geist and

Parsons (2006); Grilli et al. (2009); and Grezio et al. (2010, 2012) among others.

The Spanish Mediterranean border has a moderate to low occurrence and magnitude/

intensity seismic activity (Papadopoulos et al. 2014). However, since the 1960 s, the coast

has experienced an intense urban development shifting most of the population to coastal

areas. As a consequence, the occupation of the littoral enormously increased and numerous

tourist resorts, houses, marinas and other infrastructures were built. Therefore, the assets

and population exposed to eventual tsunami hazards are greater than ever and, for this

reason, Spain is considered a country with a higher tsunami risk (Álvarez-Gómez et al.

2011).

There are also a number of studies about tsunami propagation and impact on Spanish

Mediterranean coasts. Wang and Liu (2005) performed a numerical investigation to

evaluate the accuracy of various suggested fault plane mechanisms for the earthquake and

tsunami of Boumerdes–Zemmouri (Algeria) occurred in 2003, calibrating the model with

data of tide gauges located in the Balearic Islands. Alasset et al. (2006) studied the same

event, testing different seismic sources and modelling the tsunami initiation and propa-

gation and comparing the results with tide gauge records in order to determine the source

of the tsunami. Roger and Hébert (2008) made a numerical simulation of the 1856 Djijelli

(Algeria) tsunami and its impact on Balearic Islands, in particular on Mallorca and

Menorca Islands. Yelles Chaouche et al. (2009) simulated also this tsunami analysing its

effects on Balearic Islands and the city of Djijelli. Álvarez-Gómez et al. (2010, 2011)

analysed the impact of tsunamis induced by north Algerian seismic sources on the Island of

Mallorca and studied the tsunami hazard at the Mediterranean Spanish coast. All these

studies have two features in common: they analyse tsunami propagation generated in a

source located in a particular region of the western Mediterranean (mainly Algeria), and

they study the impact of tsunamis on a particular stretch of the Spanish Mediterranean

coast (mainly the Balearic Islands).

The Catalan Coast (Spanish Mediterranean) is an area of frequent seismic activity

although with low intensity. Even although this area can be considered relatively safe from

tsunamis generated in North Africa, geologic studies (Perea et al. 2006, 2012) showed that

a number of faults located in the Catalano-Balearic Sea have potentiality to produce

earthquakes with magnitudes larger than 7 and, thus, could be responsible for future

unexpected tsunamis in the zone.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to perform a study of the tsunami hazard in the

Catalan Coast, taking into account the features of the faults located in front of this coast.

The study focuses on beaches and coastal infrastructures, with special emphasis on coastal

flooding and port agitation. The paper is structured as follows: in Sect. 2, the study area is

described, in particular its geological and seismological features. The methodology and

data used are presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, the obtained results are displayed and

discussed. Finally, in Sect. 5, the main conclusions are presented.

2 Study area

2.1 Site description

The Catalan Coast (Fig. 1) is located in the NW Mediterranean border and limited by the

Gulf of Lion (France) to the north and the Ebro Delta (Spain) to the south. This coastal

Nat Hazards

stretch has an approximate length of 700 km, and its continental margin is crossed by

several submarine canyons of different evolutionary history (Canals et al. 2004).

The coastal fringe presents almost all types of littoral environments. The main mor-

phological features are (from south to north): (1) the Ebro Delta unit (a 50-km sandy

fringe) and the low-lying beaches of Costa Daurada, (2) the straight segmented relatively

coarse beaches at the centre (represented by the Barcelona–Maresme system), and (3) the

pocket beaches and cliffs near the French border (Costa Brava). The strong anthropogenic

pressure and the economic activity developed in the area during the last 30 years have

created a very fragmented coastal landscape as a result of the marine facilities and different

coastal protection interventions. Moreover, urban sandy beaches usually border the coastal

backside with a seafront promenade and infrastructures such as streets, roads, railways or

houses. Few coastal stretches remain pristine or have a low human imprint. The Ebro delta

at the south and the Gulf of Roses at the north are examples of these low-lying natural

environments.

The central part of the coast is under the influence of the Barcelona metropolitan area

and contains most of the marinas and urban settlements. The main economical attraction

points are the harbour and airport of Barcelona. The activities performed by the Port of

Barcelona—ship, logistics and intermodal transport services—directly and indirectly

generate Gross Value Added (GVA) for the economy to the tune of 2.291 billion €, which
represents the 1.4% of Catalonia’s total GVA. The direct and indirect employment asso-

ciated with the harbour represents the 0.9% of Catalonia’s job market (BPA 2015). The

Barcelona airport, located three kilometres from the Port of Barcelona, is the second

biggest in Spain. In 2015 it was the 10th European airport in passenger traffic.

As can be seen, the high concentration of population, assets and infrastructures makes

the Catalan Coast particularly vulnerable to hazards coming from the sea-like wave storms

or tsunamis.

2.2 Geological and seismological settings

The opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the collision between African and Eurasian plates

have controlled the geodynamics of the Iberian microplate. During the Neogene, an

extensional back-arc process took place in the western Mediterranean due to the subduc-

tion of Africa beneath Eurasia (e.g. Malinverno and Ryan 1986; Royden 1993; Gueguen

et al. 1998; Doglioni et al. 1999; Jolivet et al. 1999; Gelabert et al. 2002; Rosenbaum et al.

2002; van Hinsbergen et al. 2014; Chertova et al. 2014). As a consequence, a number of

extensional basins were formed (the València Trough, the Alboran Sea, the Ligurian-

Provençal, the Algerian and the Tyrrhenian basins). Specifically, the Valencia through

basin is a NE–SW-trending basin with a wedge shape opening towards the NE and being

limited to the NW by the Catalan and Valencia coasts and to the SE by the Balearic Islands

promontory. Two tectonic phases have been defined in the evolution of the Valencia trough

basin since the Neogene (Roca and Guimerà 1992; Roca 1996, 2001; Roca et al. 1999):

(a) a rifting phase that lasted from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene and during which

a NE–SW-trending rift system with a total extension of 7.1 km developed; and (b) a

thermal subsidence phase characterized by moderate tectonic activity mainly localized

along the borders of the basin and by a total extension of 4.1 km since the middle Miocene

to the present.

The geological structure in the north western margin of the Valencia trough basin is

controlled by several extensional faults forming a horst and graben system. The main faults

are listric, dip 60�, have normal dip slip, branch in a common detachment level at
approximately 15 km depth, accumulate kilometric displacements and have produced a

considerable crustal thinning on the axis of the basin (Roca and Guimerà 1992; Roca

1996, 2001; Sàbat et al. 1996; Roca et al. 1999; Vergés and Sàbat 1999; Gaspar-Escribano

2004). Although these faults are under low strain rates, different studies have proposed that

some of them, onshore and offshore, are still active with slip rates ranging between 0.1 and

0.01 mm/yr and capable of producing large earthquakes (M[ 6) with mean recurrence
intervals between 10

3
and 10

5
years (Masana et al. 2001a, b; Perea et al. 2003, 2006, 2012;

Perea 2009).

The instrumental seismicity around the Catalan Coast is low and characterized by

earthquakes of low to moderate magnitude (maximum reached Mw = 5.1) (Olivera et al.

1992; Perea et al. 2006, 2012). Moreover, the earthquakes are described as shallow

regarding that more than 90% of the events are located between the surface and 15–20 km

depth, which may correspond to the thickness of the seismogenic crust. Accordingly to this

and in agreement with the location of the common detachment level, the fault rupture

planes used in the tsunami modelling do not surpass the 15 km depth. Geographically, the

highest earthquake density is localized in the Pyrenees and the Transverse ranges, whereas

the lowest density is observed across the Catalan and Valencia coasts. Despite the low-

intensity seismic activity, some large earthquakes have occurred in the past, such as those

of the Catalan seismic crisis in 1427 and 1428 (earthquakes of Amer, Olot and Camprodon

with intensities—MCS scale—of VIII, VIII and IX, respectively) (Olivera et al. 2006;

Perea 2009) or as those deduced from palaeo-seismological studies (Masana et al.

2001a, b; Perea et al. 2003). Accordingly, it could not rule out the possibility of occurrence

of a future large earthquake in the area and the important economic and social conse-

quences it could have, considering that the area is densely populated, very industrialized

and with important infrastructures (e.g. nuclear power plants or harbours).

3 Materials and methods

3.1 Model description

The most extended models to simulate tsunami propagation are based on the nonlinear

shallow-water equations, like MOST (Titov and Sinolakis 1998), COMCOT (Liu et al.

1994, 1995; Wang and Liu 2006), TSUNAMI2 (Imamura 1996) or UBO-TSUFD (Tinti

et al. 2006; Argnani et al. 2012) or on Boussinesq equations, like FUNWAVE (Wei and

Kirby 1995; Chen et al. 2000; Kennedy et al. 2000) or COULWAVE (Lynett and Liu

2002, 2004; Lynett et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2009). In this paper, the COMCOT model has

been used to analyse the tsunami-related hazards along the Catalan Coast. The model

simulates the entire lifespan of a tsunami, including the generation, propagation and run-

up. It has been previously used to reproduce recent recorded tsunamis like the event of

May 2003 in Algeria (Wang and Liu 2005) and the episode in the Indian Ocean in 2004

(Wang and Liu 2006).

The tsunami generation mechanism in the model assumes that the initial water dis-

placement generated by the earthquake is identical to the vertical displacement of seabed

induced by the ground motion, which is determined using the expressions proposed by

Mansinha and Smylie (1971) and Okada (1985). This hypothesis is reasonable because the

rupture typically has duration of few minutes, which can be considered instantaneous

comparing to the timescale of tsunami propagation. Since the WCSTA approach is used, a

duration enough long to reach the maximum tsunami elevation is assumed.

COMCOT adopts a modified leapfrog finite-difference scheme to solve (both linear and

nonlinear) shallow-water equations (Liu et al. 1994, 1995) in both Spherical and Cartesian

coordinates and uses a nested grid system that allows to save computational time, with a

detailed mesh in the coastal region and a broader mesh in deepwater areas where a more

precise mesh is not necessary. Finally, to simulate the wave run-up, COMCOT uses a

moving boundary scheme.

3.2 Tsunami impact assessment

Tsunami scenarios are commonly used to determine the vulnerability of a specific coastal

area; their results are used to define guidelines in policy planning. To analyse the Catalan

Coast exposition to tsunamis, the WCTSA has been used. Similar approaches can be found

in the literature to study the tsunami hazard in different areas (Tinti et al. 2005a; Okal and

Synolakis 2008; Lorito et al. 2008; Tonini et al. 2011; Pagnoni et al. 2015; Armigliato et al.

2015).

The WCTSA can be described as a three-step framework: (1) the source identification;

(2) the generation and propagation; and (3) the building of a unique aggregated scenario.

The construction of the worst-case scenario is obtained by generating and propagating

tsunamis triggered by the offshore faults with their associated major earthquakes. The

parameters necessary to characterize the seafloor displacements responsible of these

earthquakes are: (1) the epicentre, (2) the focal depth, (3) the fault length, (4) the fault

width, (5) the strike, (6) the dip, (7) the slip and (8) the rake. The elastic fault model has

been used in the generation mechanism. Thus, the model assumes an idealized rectangular

plane as the interface between two colliding plates, and the fault motion takes place on this

plane and the water surface will follow the seafloor uplift.

123



On the other hand, shallow-water tsunami wave propagation is strongly influenced by

the existing bottom morphology (Iglesias et al. 2014). Therefore, to obtain realistic results,

detailed topo-bathymetric information, describing relevant morphology details, is required.

The fault parameters and topo-bathymetry data used in this study are described in Sect. 3.3.

To study the potential impacts of tsunamis in the Catalan Coast, the offshore effects and

the inland repercussions of these waves have been analysed. The offshore effects have been

described for every case by the wave estimated times of arrival to the coast and the

maximum water surface elevations achieved. The maximum water surface elevations

registered during the events are plotted in maximum free surface elevation (FSE) maps,

which indicate the hazard distribution in worst-case scenarios studies.

Coastal flooding and port agitation are the main hazardous effects provoked by tsunami

on the coast, although not all the tsunamis are strong enough to cause them. In this study,

the effects of the most powerful waves generated on the most affected areas have been

analysed through flooding maps which show the areas inundated during the events. These

maps are used to identify areas most vulnerable to inundation and for land-use planning.

Nevertheless, these maps must be interpreted with caution because maximum/minimum

FSEs may occur with significant time lag, and therefore, they are not representative of the

maximum agitation, although they indicate the minimum and maximum levels reached

during the event. On the other hand, to characterize Barcelona Port agitation, maximum

and minimum FSE maps have been used, which show the complete FSE range during the

events. In addition, flow maps showing the water velocities’ distribution within the port

boundaries have been plotted because current velocity and wave height are the two vari-

ables primarily used to define port operability.

3.3 Data and modelling strategy

The required fault information in the area has been obtained from Perea et al. (2006, 2012).

These authors estimated the maximum magnitude (Mw) earthquake on each fault assuming

that the mapped length of each fault corresponds to the maximum surface rupture length

that an earthquake could produce and using available empirical relationships for normal

faults (Wells and Coppersmith 1994). On the offshore, since there is no geomorphologic

evidence of these faults on the seafloor, industrial reflection profiles were used to map their

length (Roca 1996, 2001; Roca and Guimerà 1992) and to determine their present activity

(Perea et al. 2006, 2012). Usually, in this type of profiles, the vertical resolution does not

allow to detect small fault offsets in shallow reflectors, as those expected in areas char-

acterized by slow slip-rate faults. However, considering that the area has been affected by a

thermal subsidence (Roca and Guimerà 1992; Roca 1996, 2001; Roca et al. 1999) and the

stress field is similar to the one that resulted in the formation of the faults (Perea et al.

2006, 2012), it has been assumed that the faults offsetting the shallow reflectors corre-

sponding to the Plio-Quaternary units, as the ones studied here, are still active and may

produce large earthquakes in the future.

The worst-case tsunami scenario has been built by analysing the wave characteristics

triggered by five offshore faults with a seismic magnitude greater than 6.9 (Fig. 2). Other

unknown necessary data have been selected as follows:

• Epicentre latitude and longitude: the epicentre has been placed in the centre of the
mapped active fault planes.

• Focal depth: since earthquakes at this area usually occur at depths between 5 km and
15 km, the middle value (10 km) has been used for all the cases.

Nat Hazards

123



• Slip (dislocation) has been obtained through the seismic moment equation

M ¼ lAD:

where M is the seismic moment, l is the rock rigidity, A is the fault area, and D is the
average dislocation. For the rock rigidity, due to the lack of data, a close-to-average

typical value of 32 GPa has been assumed, which is similar to that used for many

authors, as for example Lay et al. (2005) for the Sumatra–Andaman Trench. Since

rigidity varies quite a bit from region to region, we keep in mind that the actual values

in the studied area could be different and, therefore, also the results, which can be

considered preliminary.

To calculate the M corresponding to the maximum earthquake, we have used the given

Mw and the Hanks and Kanamori (1979) relation. The A has been estimated using the

mapped surface length of the fault and the width of the fault plane, obtained considering

that the fault dips 608 and extends from the seafloor up to 15 km depth (Table 1). The
equation is used in an inverse manner, that is, known the seismic moment of a Worst-case

Credible Tsunami Scenario (according to Perea et al. 2006, 2012), the associated dislo-

cation is found. In addition, a uniform slip distribution on the fault is assumed since it

corresponds to the WCTSA, although heterogeneities could lead to different results.

123



With respect to the rake, since the faults in the area have been characterized as normal

faults (Perea et al. 2006, 2012), an angle of -90� has been selected because it gives the
maximum movement in the vertical direction, being the most hazardous expected case.

Table 1 shows a summary of the seismic parameters associated with the five-fault worst-

case scenario earthquake (Perea et al. 2006, 2012).

The model setup is structured in a sequence of nested grids in four different levels

(Fig. 3). The first level (grid A) covers the northeast Iberian Peninsula Coast and part of the

Balearic Islands. There are three grids in the second level (B1, B2 and B3) covering the

northern, central and southern parts of the Catalan Coast. These two levels have been used

to carry out the WCTSA. Once the hazard along the Catalan Coast has been assessed, the

third and four levels have been built where the analysis showed a higher hazard, to make

more precise studies, including inundation analysis. Thus, the third-level grids contain the

areas studied in detail: Gulf of Roses (C1), Barcelona and surroundings (C2) and Ebro

Delta (C3). The fourth level (D) includes the Barcelona Harbour. The different grids have

been integrated into a nested spherical coordinate system, and all use nonlinear equations

and the same Manning’s roughness parameter 0.013. Grid size ratios between 4 and 5 have

been used in the different levels. Table 2 shows the different grid parameters used in the

study.

The necessary topographic and bathymetric data for the above-described model strategy

have been obtained from the following databases:

• The GEBCO_2014 Grid, with a resolution of 30’’. It has been used in the two coarser
grids, where the level of detail needed is not as demanding.

• The EMODnet Bathymetry from the European Marine Observation and Data Network,
generated from bathymetric survey datasets and composite digital terrain models

(DTM). It has a resolution of 0.125’ and has been used for the finer grids. It has to be

complemented with topography data for inundation studies.

• DTM from the Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya, with a horizontal resolution of 15 m
and altimetric accuracy of 0.9 m (value of the root-mean-square error). It has been used

to complement the EMODnet bathymetry.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 The Gulf of Roses fault

The fault is placed in the Gulf of Roses, a low-lying coast with urbanized areas and several

campsites on the seaside, as well as the Empordà Marshes Natural Park (Figs. 2 and 4).

The fault is perpendicular to the general Catalan coastline, being partially inland in its

northwest end. Its maximum associated earthquake magnitude is Mw 7.3. Its initial

movement causes a maximum FSE of 0.37 m in the coastal side and a maximum 1.32 m

free surface depression offshore.

The generated tsunami (Fig. SM1 in the Supplementary Material) propagates in two

fronts: a trough–crest system travelling towards the south and a crest–trough unit moving

towards the north. The results indicate a complex tsunami circulation pattern with

important coastal reflections at the Montgrı́ cliffs and the shelf and submarine canyons. The

existing relative wide shelf induces the trapping of the southern wave front in such a way

that it returns to L’Estartit after approximately 10 min after its generation inducing the

highest FSE in the area. La Fonera canyon appears to be a morphological barrier for the

tsunami propagation concentrating the wave energy in the canyon head (close to the coast)

and permitting its travel towards the south. About 15 min after the earthquake, there is an

interaction between reflected waves and the trapped refracted front causing important FSE

at the Gulf of Roses coastline. The results show the trap effect of the Gulf of Roses for also

the reflected–refracted waves from the northern front. As a result of this, a maximum in the

FSE is generated in the area.

The maximum FSE map (Fig. 4) shows the highest tsunami affectations between the

enclosed coastal stretches of the Gulf of Roses and L’Estartit although it is observed up to

100 km southwards. The maximum modelled FSE is 6.4 m. A significant flooding is

observed in both areas severely affecting the inland. The total flooded area during the event

the Baix Empordà Marshes Natural Park and the existing coastal holiday resorts and

campsites are the main affected infrastructures at the north. Given that the fault is entering

in the onshore, the displacement on the fault plane in this area could produce some

subsidence increasing the possible flooded area. Thus, the obtained values should be

considered as minimum. A similar landscape is observed at L’Estartit, being the village,

the existing farmlands and small resorts also affected by the tsunami. The fault is able to

significantly affect up to 16 campsites.

The topography influence in the inundation process is evident since the flooding is

greater in areas near rivers mouths, marshes and canals, where the topography is low-lying

or even below the sea surface. The inundations would take place when the maximum wave

crest hits the coast. The Gulf of Roses shore is reached 20 min after the earthquake;

meanwhile, L’Estartit area is reached before, 15 min after the event. The arrival times

derived from the simulations were too short and hardly would allow a warning notice and

evacuation ordered by the authorities. For this reason, self-evacuation based on natural

signs such as strong ground shaking should be exercised.

4.2 The Blanes fault

The Blanes fault (Figs. 2 and 5) is located between La Fonera Canyon and Blanes Canyon,

and it slides towards the coast. Its maximum earthquake magnitude isMw 7.1 and causes an

initial maximum uplift of 0.3 and 1.1 m of maximum depression. The generated wave

crests propagate initially parallel to the coast (see Fig. SM2 at Suppl. Mat.). The Blanes

canyon at the south and La Fonera canyon at the north limit the alongshore front growth

concentrating the energy on the coast. The highest FSE is reached between minutes 15 and

20 with a maximum value of up to 3.2 m. The maximum FSE plot for Blanes fault scenario

shows how the higher water elevations are concentrated in front of Palamós. In the sur-

rounding areas, there are some significant surface elevations, but they do not produce

remarkable flooding. The low maximum FSE together with the high-lying topography in

the area prevents significant inundation, and therefore, the hazard associated with this fault

is expected to be low.

4.3 Barcelona fault

The Barcelona fault is located 10 km offshore from the coastline and parallel to it (Figs. 2

and 6). It is 123 km long and the longest fault considered in this study. It also has the

largest earthquake magnitude (Mw 7.6) and the largest slip (4.63 m). Similarly to the Gulf

of Roses fault, Barcelona fault slides seawards. The initial displacement produces a

maximum free surface depression of 2.2 m and a maximum FSE of 0.8 m.

The results show that the most important tsunami activity is developed within the first

50 min (Fig. SM3 at Suppl. Mat.). The coastline is affected by the initial disturbance

because of the short distance between them. A wave crest can be observed in front of the

coast 10 min after the earthquake. At minute 20, the crest has reached the entire coast, and

at the same time, the offshore wave propagates faster towards the Balearic Islands because

of the deeper bathymetry of the basin. The wave trough arrives to the coast of the Balearic

Islands (180 km eastwards) at minute 30 and to the Ebro Delta (150 km southwards) at

minute 40 after the earthquake.

The generated waves hit first Blanes at the north and the Barcelona Port at the south. In

the first case, the Blanes canyon acts as coastal attractor, as the Fonera canyon in the Gulf

of Roses fault scenario, by increasing the wave celerity through the canyon and refracting

it. Nevertheless, this effect is very local and of low magnitude due to the limited width of

the canyon and the short distance. In the case of Barcelona Port, this early arrival is due to

its proximity to the fault. The small canyons located in front of Mataró at the north may

also influence the wave propagation too, causing the highest wave concentrations in

Mataró area (Fig. 6). The largest concentration of tsunami energy there is due to the ‘‘wave

guide’’ effect of the much shallower ridge between the two neighbouring canyons, since

waves travelling into the two canyons are refracted towards the shallower depth area

between the two canyons, focusing more energy to Mataró. The maximum FSE registered

is 5.5 m.

A significant flooding can be observed at the south of the Barcelona Port partially

affecting the airport facilities and the existing campsites. The water moves through the

Llobregat river mouth and advances to the southwest side of the airport up to 2 km inland.

The total inundated area is 8.5 km
2
. The low-lying nature of the region, situated in the

Llobregat delta, totally controls the flooding. Thus, areas with higher FSE (mainly at the

north of Barcelona) will not experience such flooding because the land infrastructures also

have a high topographic level (greater than 3.5 m). As an example, the railroad at El

Masnou although is located at less than 100 m from the shoreline is build at datum ?4 m

above the mean water level and acts as a coastal defence against flooding. The maximum

run-up is 4.38 m.

Figure 7 shows the maximum and minimum water elevations recorded at Barcelona

port during the event. The breakwater crown elevation, up to ?12.5 m above the mean

water level, is significantly higher than the obtained FSE (less than 2 m), and consequently,

overtopping during the event is not expected. Inside the harbour, there is almost uniform

maximum and minimum elevation distribution of about 1 m (positive and negative).

The tsunami propagation inside the port is shown in Fig. 8. The simulation starts with

steady flow conditions. The tsunami enters first in the southern harbour mouth. An intense

offshore current is developed at the south of up to 2 m/s associated with the through pass.

A similar pattern less intense (of up to 1 m/s) is observed at the north 2 min later. A second

wave front hits the harbour following the same direction of propagation although in this

case the wave crest is big enough to generate an inflow current of similar magnitude and an

eddy. Finally, around minute 30 a well-developed wave front from the north impacts the

harbour affecting the southern mouth mainly due to its more exposed orientation and big

dimensions.

The flow velocities and the wave heights registered during the event within the harbour

reach values of up to 1 m/s and 1 m. The developed inside hydrodynamics reflects the

differences in the harbour geometry. The southern basin has the largest dimensions, with a

wider entrance of about 370 m at 16 m depth, whereas at the north, the second entrance is

narrow (145 m) and shallow (11 m). Because of that, a more clear current field and eddy is

developed and propagated at the south, whereas at the north, the tsunami affects imme-

diately the entire area.

The tsunami has repercussions on the entire harbour activities making the manoeuvring

or anchoring hazardous. According to the regulations of the Spanish Harbour Authority

(Puertos del Estado, ROM 3.1-99), the conditions reached (wave height and flow veloci-

ties) will be large enough to stop most of the activity.

4.4 Salou fault

The Salou fault (Fig. 2) is situated between Tarragona and Tortosa canyons. It has the

smallest maximum credible earthquake magnitude Mw 7 among the studied faults and the

smaller slip 1.77 m. The initial movement causes a 0.3 m maximum water elevation

offshore and 0.9 m free surface depression towards the coast.

The wave development (Fig. SM4 of Suppl. Mat.), unlike the previous cases, propagates

without being affected by coastal reflections. The fault location, at the border of a wide

shelf, leads to steady wave propagation. The trough reaches the coast at minute 15. The

continental shelf morphology appears to be an important element controlling the tsunami

propagation. The Ebro delta continental shelf, at the south of the fault, is wider and

presents a steeper continental slope with respect to the area located to the north of the fault.

For this reason, the wave propagation at the south is slower and the Ebro delta coast is

reached after 25 min although with a small FSE. The maximum FSE is presented in Fig. 9.

The wave energy focuses on the coasts around Vilanova i la Geltrú and Torredembarra.

The results indicate that the Tarragona Canyon influences the wave propagation as in

previous cases although with less intensity. The maximum FSE recorded is 1.8 m, and

significant flooded areas cannot be appreciated.

4.5 Fault of the Amposta basin

The fault of the Amposta basin (Fig. 3) is located at the south of the Ebro Delta; it has a

north–south direction and slides to the coast. Its maximum earthquake magnitude isMw 7.1

and generates a 0.3 m maximum initial offshore FSE and a 1.1 m maximum onshore

depression. Figure SM5 (Suppl. Mat.) shows the tsunami development. The fault dis-

placement generates two trough–crest fronts propagating towards the south and north,

respectively. The first system arrives to the southern coast after 20 min and generates a

reflected wave that propagates offshore and remains in the shelf. The second front prop-

agates to Sant Jordi Gulf and is trapped in the shelf by refraction causing a refracted wave

front to reach the Ebro delta. Trapped reflected waves have been previously discussed by

Camfield (1982, 1988) and in the Shore Protection Manual (Shore Protection Manual

(SPM) 1984). Both wave fronts of the reflected crest from the south and the trapped

onshore propagated front from the north interact around minute 50 producing the highest

FSE of the event along the southern hemidelta.

Nat Hazards

123



The maximum FSE in the Ebro Delta produced by the tsunami is plotted in Fig. 10.

Wave heights concentrate in Castellon coast and Tortosa Cape. The maximum FSE

recorded is 1.5 m and the maximum run-up is 2.29 m. Even though the water elevations

obtained are higher close to Castellon, the inundations are larger in the Ebro Delta because

of its low-lying topography. Due to its orientation, the northern part of the deltaic coast is

less exposed to the tsunami although a wave energy concentration is observed at Sant Jordi

Gulf due to the coastline orientation which forces the wave to propagate towards it.

The area flooded by the tsunami triggered in this case is shown in Fig. 10. The trapped

wave front is responsible for the complete inundation of Els Alfacs Spit and the barrier

beach of El Trabucador (5 km long) and also the flooding of L’Eucaliptus residential area.

The total area flooded is about 65 km
2
, representing 20% of the total Ebro Delta surface.

4.6 Aggregated scenario

Combining the maximum FSE from all the different computed scenarios in a unique

framework provides the aggregated worst-case scenario for any point in the studied area.

This map would provide a good approximation for the expected hazard distribution along

the coast, and it would allow identifying areas where the hazard is higher as well as the

responsible source. Consequently, these areas can be studied in detail. A joint map with the

maximum water elevation from the five different sources and a plot with the fault con-

tribution distribution to the aggregated worst-case scenario are plotted in Fig. 11. The area

with the highest hazard associated is the northern half of the Catalan Coast, from the Gulf

of Roses to Barcelona, but the hazard is not negligible in the rest of the coastal areas shown

in this figure, including Castellón and the Balearic Islands, that are out of the scope of this

study. The obtained results suggest that the Barcelona fault is the largest contributor to the

aggregated scenario, generating the largest FSEs in more than half of the Catalan Coast.

The Gulf of Roses and the Amposta basin faults have also a large contribution, giving the

highest FSEs in the areas closest to their location. The Salou fault has local influence too,

but it affects the coast with smaller FSEs. On the contrary, the Blanes fault is eclipsed by

the Barcelona fault, as it could be expected because both faults are located in nearby areas

and the last one has a greater slip. Ultimately, the worst-case tsunami scenario for the

Catalan Coast cannot be related to a unique fault since there are four different sources

giving rise to the highest FSEs at different stretches of that coast.

5 Summary and conclusions

The Catalan Coast (NW Mediterranean) is an area with a high concentration of population,

assets and infrastructures, where the seismic activity is frequent but of low intensity and

where the perception of tsunami risk does not exist. Nevertheless, strong earthquakes in the

past and the presence of a number of offshore faults in front of this coast suggest that the

possibility of having a tsunami in this area, although with a low probability, is not

negligible.

Using the numerical model COMCOT and information about the fault features and the

WCTSA approach, the worst possible tsunamis that could take place in this region have

been simulated, including their generation, propagation and potential impacts on different

stretches of the coast.

The results can be considered preliminary, since they are dependent on the assumptions

and hypothesis made (summarized as a WCTSA) and could be different if these

assumptions were changed. In addition, the accuracy of DTM (0.9 m) is not very

favourable for detailed inundation modelling and, therefore, results may change if better

topographical data (e.g. LIDAR) were used. However, the presented results are illustrative

of the potential hazard posed by tsunamis on large areas of the studied coast.

Results indicate that the worst tsunami scenario is generated by the Barcelona fault,

located at the centre of the studied region, in front of the largest city of the studied area and

where strategic infrastructures (Barcelona port and airport) are located. The tsunami would

flood partially the airport, penetrating 2 km inland and inundating an area of 8.5 km
2
. The

same tsunami would produce strong currents (up 2 m/s) around the two port mouths and

positive and negative FSE of 1 m within the harbour, putting at risk port operations and

berthed vessels. Long stretches of the coast would not be flooded due to the existence of

high seaside promenades that would protect the beach backside from the waves. This

shows the need of a good coastal topography that complements the WCTSA to better

explain the hazard distribution.

Other faults could trigger tsunamis affecting other areas of this coast. Thus, the Gulf of

Roses fault, located at the northern part of the Catalan Coast, could generate waves

penetrating 2.5 km inland and flooding an area of 23.7 km
2
due to the low-lying coast.

Similar situation was found in the south of the Catalan Coast, where a tsunami triggered by

the Amposta basin fault could flood up to 20% of the Ebro Delta surface.

In addition to discovering the zones most threatened by tsunamis, this study highlighted

that the waves would arrive to the coast in few minutes, due to the proximity of the faults to

the coastline. Therefore, the available time for warning and evacuation is too short and

stresses the need of increasing the awareness of stakeholders and public in general.

Consequently, in spite of the low probability of occurrence, the tsunami hazard in the

Catalan Coast is significant due to the high level of coastal urbanization that in case of an

event would potentially generate large losses. In particular, during the peak tourist season,

the large number of assets, campsites and beaches that could be flooded by these events

pose a high risk (probability 9 loss) of damages and even casualties.
