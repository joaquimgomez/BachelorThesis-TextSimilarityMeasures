ABSTRACT 32 

 33 

The effects of atypical climatic conditions, such as those of a drought 34 

event, are remarkably accentuated in minor estuaries filled with sediments 35 

and with reduced or sporadic freshwater input, where the salinity intrusion is 36 

pronounced. To understand these effects, hydrological and hydrodynamic 37 

parameters were evaluated during a drought period in a small estuary located 38 

on the eastern Amazon coast in northern Brazil. Five campaigns were 39 

conducted between June 2012 and June 2013. Samples were collected from 40 

the surface and bottom layer every three hours over a 25-hour period at three 41 

stations of the Taperaçu Estuary. To compare drought and post-drought 42 

periods, in terms of salinity and chlorophyll-a, data was recorded until June 43 

2015. Taperaçu is a relatively shallow estuary of the Amazon coastal zone, 44 

which is characterized by the absence of any direct fluvial discharge, although 45 

it does receive freshwater input from adjacent wetlands, as well as less saline 46 

waters from the Caeté Estuary through the Taici Creek. Hydrological variables 47 

were controlled by rainfall levels and the tidal range, and the water became 48 

more saline and more oxygenated, with reduced dissolved nutrient and 49 

chlorophyll-a concentrations when precipitation decreased. Significant 50 

variation was found between the months of June 2012 (most intense drought) 51 

and 2013 (less intense drought). The connection to the neighboring Caeté 52 

Estuary, and adjacent mangroves and wetlands contributed to the influx of 53 

nutrient-enriched waters. Overall, then, it is hoped that the results of this study 54 

can contribute to the understanding of the effects of drought events in other 55 

minor estuaries on the highly indented Amazon coast, as well as in other 56 

areas of the equatorial zone with similar environmental characteristics. 57

1. Introduction 65 

Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems found in the intertidal 66 

zones of equatorial, tropical and subtropical estuaries. These environments 67 

are normally considered to be a potential source and/or effective sink of 68 

nutrients and organic matter (Dittmar and Lara 2001). Associated typically 69 

with estuarine environments, these ecosystems play an important role in 70 

coastal areas, due to their significant input of terrigenous sediments, organic 71 

matter, and nutrients into coastal waters (Burford et al. 2008; Shilla et al. 72 

2011). Mangroves function as nutrient filters, modifying the biological 73 

productivity and biogeochemical cycles in estuarine systems (Dittmar and 74 

Lara 2001; Nagelkerken et al. 2005). In mangrove-estuarine systems, the 75 

characteristics of hydrodynamic factors such as tides, currents, and river 76 

discharge are critical for the exchange of water, nutrients, sediments, and 77 

organisms between intertidal and coastal areas (Arumugan et al. 2016; 78 

Claudino et al. 2015; Ray et al. 2014).  79 

The Brazilian Amazon coast encompasses one of the largest 80 

continuous tracts of mangrove forest found anywhere in the world (Kjerfve 81 

and Lacerda 1993) with dozens of estuaries, including that of the Amazon 82 

River itself. This coastal zone straddles the equator (5°N–4°S), and forms one 83 

of the world’s most extensive and well-preserved areas of tropical coastline. 84 

Coastal processes in this low latitude zone result from a combination of local 85 

macrotides (tidal range of 4–12 m during spring tides), moderate energy 86 

waves (Hs up to 2.0 m), strong tidal currents (normally above 1.0 m s-1) and 87 

high levels of rainfall (~ 2000–3000 mm). In addition, the enormous discharge 88 

of freshwater from the Amazon River (located 150 km from the study area) 89 



 4 

and 23 other estuaries, containing suspended particles and dissolved 90 

nutrients from local river basins, affect the whole of the Amazon coastal 91 

waters (Geyer et al. 1996; Nittrouer and DeMaster 1996). 92 

The availability of these dissolved nutrients, associated with the 93 

region’s high-energy hydrodynamics, sustains high levels of biological 94 

productivity (DeMaster and Pope 1996; Goes et al. 2014). While these 95 

processes have been analyzed in detail in the region’s principal estuaries 96 

(those of the Amazon and Pará rivers), as well as in the Amazon plume that 97 

encroaches the Atlantic Ocean, few data are available for coastal waters, 98 

mainly for its minor estuaries, despite their relative abundance. In fact, minor 99 

estuaries have received comparatively little attention worldwide, although a 100 

number of recent studies have focused on different aspects of the role of the 101 

size of an estuary on its hydrological characteristics (Jickells et al. 2014; Pye 102 

and Blott 2014). Studies of this type have contributed to the understanding of 103 

the effects of natural phenomena such as atypical climatic conditions and 104 

anthropogenic interference on the hydrological characteristics of minor 105 

estuaries, and their consequences for local biological communities. In 106 

particular, minor effects on small estuaries may have far-ranging impacts due 107 

to their spatial limitations, with secondary effects for the entire system 108 

(Callaway et al. 2014). 109 

In recent years, the Amazon coastal zone has been increasingly 110 

impacted by atypical climatic conditions (Pereira et al. 2013; Andrade et al. 111 

2016), although what happens during years of drought events is not well-112 

understood.  While an increase in rainfall levels and fluvial discharge affect 113 

the waters of whole Amazon coast, no information is available on how drought 114 



 5 

events may affect the oceanographic processes in these ecosystems. During 115 

the present study, the drought event was not related to an El Niño Southern 116 

Oscillation, but was the result of a complex relationship between Atlantic sea 117 

temperatures and rainfall in the Amazon, when an increase in the sea surface 118 

temperature (SST) provoked a decline in rainfall rates in the eastern Amazon 119 

and Northeast Brazil (Marengo et al., 2013a). Two recent short-term events – 120 

known locally as the “droughts of the century”, which occurred in 2005 and 121 

2010 – have received a great deal of attention (Gloor et al. 2013; Marengo et 122 

al. 2011a) due not only to their serious environmental and social 123 

consequences for the whole Amazon region, but also for their potential 124 

impacts on global climate (Gratiot et al. 2008; Marengo et al. 2008, 2011b).  125 

Small estuaries filled with sediments and with reduced or sporadic 126 

freshwater input – such as the Taperaçu Estuary – can be found in a number 127 

of parts of the world. The Taperaçu is a minor Amazon estuary with less than 128 

30 km in length. It is also relatively shallow (mean depth 4 m) and currently 129 

has no fluvial input, but receives freshwater input from adjacent wetlands 130 

during the rainy season. Local mangrove forest plays an important role in the 131 

input and distribution of nutrient in adjacent coastal waters during high tides. 132 

The connections between local tidal creeks and areas of mangrove also 133 

provide an important pathway for the exchange of materials (Cohen et al. 134 

1999; Dittmar and Lara 2001).  During high tides, the Taperaçu is connected 135 

to the upper sector of the Caeté Estuary (Asp et al. 2012); and, together with 136 

the adjacent mangroves, this connectivity contributes to the rich biological 137 

productivity of the estuary (Magalhães et al. 2011, 2013). 138 



 6 

Local anthropogenic interference is also minimal. In this coastal zone, 139 

phytoplankon and microphytobenthos – dominated by diatoms such as 140 

Asterionelopsis glacialis, Skeletonema sp., Campylosira cymbelliformis, 141 

Coscinodiscus concinus, C. perforates Ehrenberg, Dimmeregrama minor and 142 

Cyclotella meneghiniana (Costa et al. 2011; Matos et al. 2011), and 143 

phytoflagellates (non-identified nanoplankton) – contribute to the high local 144 

phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity. These organisms, together 145 

with the local mangrove forests appear to be the primary determinants of the 146 

high chlorophyll-a concentration in the study area, as proposed by Wollf et al. 147 

(2000) for the neighboring Caeté Estuary. Few data are available on the 148 

nutrient concentrations of the Taperaçu Estuary, although it is known to 149 

support a high density of phytoplankton biomass, which sustains high levels of 150 

secondary biological productivity (Costa et al. 2008; Magalhães et al. 2009; 151 

Palma et al., 2013).  152 

The local natural features of the Taperaçu make of it an excellent study 153 

site for the understanding of the effects of atypical climatic conditions, such as 154 

a drought event. To test whether lower rainfall levels affect hydrological 155 

variables, the present study evaluated an anomalous dry season in the study 156 

area. In this context, the study includes three main questions: a) How do 157 

anomalous climatic events (such as droughts) affect oceanographic 158 

processes? b) What are the effects of these atypical events on small Amazon 159 

estuaries? c) What is the role of the tides in sustaining the connectivity of 160 

different Amazon coastal environments? The main aim of this study was thus 161 

to evaluate the effects of drought on these conditions in a small, equatorial 162 

estuary on the Amazon coast, which is connected to adjacent nutrient-rich 163 



 7 

environments. For this, the spatial and temporal dynamics of physical, 164 

chemical, and biological variables (chlorophyll-a) were studied during a period 165 

of abnormally dry climatic conditions. As the rainfall pattern is similar to that of 166 

other Amazon coastal areas (INMET, 2013), it is hoped that the results of the 167 

present study can contribute to the understanding of the specific effects of 168 

similar conditions (i.e., drought events) on that highly indented coast, as well 169 

as in other areas of the equatorial zone that have similar environmental 170 

characteristics. 171 

 172 

2. Study area 173 

The present study focuses on the Taperaçu Estuary, which is located 174 

on the Amazon Macrotidal Mangrove Coast of the northern Brazilian state of 175 

Pará. This estuary is in the municipality of Bragança, about 150 km southeast 176 

of the mouth of the Amazon River (Fig. 1), and has a surface area of 21 km² 177 

and a catchment of approximately 40 km² (Araújo Jr. and Asp 2013). This 178 

funnel-shaped body of water is relatively shallow with extensive sandbanks 179 

running down its midline, half of which are exposed during low tide, forming 180 

deep channels (up to 12 m), mainly at the margins of the estuary (Asp et al. 181 

2012). 182 

Local hydrodynamics are driven primarily by the tidal regime, but also 183 

by local winds and wind-waves. The local tides are semidiurnal and may 184 

range up to 5–6 m near the mouth of the estuary during spring tides and 185 

between 3 and 4 m during neap tides. Wind-waves are of secondary 186 

importance in the local hydrodynamics, and their propagation is reduced 187 



 8 

primarily by the sandy shoals. Tidal currents are typical of shallow estuaries, 188 

reaching values above 1.5 m s-1 (Asp et al. 2012). 189 

 190 

Insert Figure 1.  191 

 192 

The local climate is humid equatorial with a period of relatively high 193 

precipitation (rainy season), typically between January and June, when total 194 

rainfall often exceeds 2000 mm, winds blow with a mean intensity of up to 3.0 195 

m s-1 and mean temperatures are around 26–27°C. During the second half of 196 

the year (dry season), monthly rainfall is normally no more than 100 mm and 197 

mean temperatures are around 28°C (INMET, 2013). The driest months are 198 

marked by negligible precipitation and by the strongest winds (mean speeds 199 

over 4.0 m s-1), leading to a surplus of evaporation over precipitation (INMET, 200 

2013). Figure 2 shows the annual precipitation recorded in the study area 201 

over the past 16 years, highlighting the driest years (2012 and 2013). 202 

Precipitation levels have a direct influence on the temporal oscillations 203 

in the salinity of the waters of the whole Amazon coast (Pereira et al. 2012, 204 

2013), but in the Taperaçu, in particular, spatial fluctuations in salinity are 205 

controlled by the influx of marine waters into the lower sector of the estuary, 206 

and the input of freshwater from local wetlands and less saline waters from 207 

Caeté Estuary into the upper sector of the Taperaçu (Magalhães et al. 2015).  208

3. Data and Methods 213 

 To understand the functioning of this minor estuary during an 214 

anomalous period of climate (low rainfall), spatial and temporal oscillations in 215 

physical, chemical and biological variables were monitored over a 13-month 216 

period, between June 2012 and June 2013. During this period, five field 217 

campaigns were undertaken during: (i) the rainy season: 13–14th June 2012, 218 

19–20th March 2013, and 3rd–4th June 2013, and (ii) the dry season: 22–219 

23th September 2012 and 5–6th December 2012.  220 

Each campaign was conducted during the neap tide over a 25-h 221 

sample period at three stations representing the upper, middle, and lower 222 

estuarine sectors (Fig. 1). Neap tide conditions were chosen because the tidal 223 

range is lower, inundating a smaller area of the mangrove. It is thus 224 

reasonable to assume that hypotheses related to tides under neap tide 225 

conditions may also be applicable to spring tide conditions, although the 226 

opposite is unlikely to be true. 227 

The post-drought campaigns were made to better support the influence 228 

of atypical rainfall levels, using salinity and chlorophyll-a as parameters. Nine 229 

campaigns were undertaken every three months, between September 2013 230 

and June 2015. In addition, monthly rainfall levels were obtained between 231 

2012 and 2015 from the Tracuateua station of the Brazilian Institute of 232 

Meteorology (INMET), located about 20 km from the study area.  233 

 234 

3.1 Field Survey 235 

To understand how circulation patterns contribute to the supply chain 236 

of dissolved nutrients and the input of waters of reduced salinity, oscillations 237 



 10 

in water levels were measured simultaneously at the three stations using a 238 

bottom-mounted mooring, to which tide gauges were attached. A mini-current 239 

meter (Sensordata) was also attached to the mooring in the middle sector to 240 

record current speeds and directions. Current data for June 2013 are missing 241 

due to equipment malfunction. Water level oscillations, and the speed and 242 

direction of the currents were recorded every 10 min.  243 

To determine how rainfall levels affect the oscillations in the 244 

hydrological variables in a minor Amazon estuary, data on temperature, 245 

salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxygen saturation (DO%) were 246 

collected simultaneously in a vertical profile (1 m below the surface and 1 m 247 

above the bottom) at each station. A bottom-mounted mooring to which the 248 

CTDs were attached was also used and every three hours, the equipment 249 

was brought to the surface for 1 h. One hundred and fifty measurements were 250 

taken by each CTD over the 25 h sample period (i.e., readings were taken 251 

every 10 min). The CTDs were equipped with dissolved oxygen and turbidity 252 

sensors (RBR). Every 3 hours, 5 L Niskin oceanographic bottles (General 253 

Oceanics) were used to obtain the water samples (surface and bottom). 254 

These samples were used to determine the pH, and dissolved nutrient and 255 

chlorophyll-a concentrations. A total of 270 water samples were collected 256 

during the study period. 257 

To compare drought and post-drought periods, in terms of salinity and 258 

chlorophyll-a, data was recorded until June 2015 using the same campaign 259 

methods than that applied during drought period. 260 

 261 

 262

3.2 Laboratory Analyses 263 

Water samples were vacuum-filtered through glass-fiber filters 264 

(Whatman GF/F 0.7 µm, 47 mm), and both the samples and the filters were 265 

freeze-dried for further analyses of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, respectively. In 266 

the laboratory, pH was determined by a pHmeter (Hanna). Dissolved 267 

inorganic nutrient concentrations (nitrite: NO2
-
		1	 , nitrate: NO3

-		1	 , ammonium:  NH4
+
		1	 , 268 

orthophosphate: PO4
3-		1	  and dissolved silicon compounds: DSi) were determined 269 

by spectrophotometry, following the procedures described by Strickland and 270 

Parsons (1977) and Grasshoff et al. (1983). Chlorophyll-a was extracted with 271 

90% acetone v.v. and determined spectrophotometrically, following the 272 

protocol of Parsons and Strickland (1963) and UNESCO (1966). The specific 273 

equations were applied to obtain the chlorophyll-a concentrations of each 274 

sample. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) levels were calculated by NO2
-
		1	  + 275 

NO3
-		1	  + NH4

+
		1	 . Filtered water samples were also frozen for subsequent analyses 276 

of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). The 277 

TDN and TDP values were determined by applying an adaptation of the 278 

simultaneous oxidation of the nitrogen and phosphorus compounds using an 279 

alkaline persulfate-oxidizing solution (Grasshoff et al. 1999). 280 

 281 

3.3 Statistical Analysis 282 

Hydrological data were analyzed spatio-temporally, according to depth 283 

(surface and bottom), sector (upper, middle and lower), season (dry and 284 

rainy), month and tidal phase (ebb and flood). The assumptions of data 285 

normality and homogeneity of variances were tested using Lilliefors' (Conover 286 

1971) and Bartlett's Chi-square tests (Sokal and Rohlf 1969), respectively. 287 



 12 

When the data were not normal or homogeneous, they were log (x + 1) 288 

transformed to produce a near-normal or near-homogeneous distribution. 289 

Analyses of Variance (ANOVA-F test) were used. A one-way ANOVA was 290 

then run to assess whether the hydrological variables vary by sampling depth, 291 

sector, season, month and tide. In addition, a two-way ANOVA was used to 292 

examine the hydrological interactions, sector vs season and sector vs month. 293 

Whenever the data were non-normal or heterogeneous, even after 294 

transformation, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H 295 

tests were used. When a significant difference was found among sectors and 296 

months, a posteriori pairwise comparisons were based on the Fisher LSD test 297 

and the Student-Newman-Keuls analysis. A Spearman correlation matrix was 298 

used to evaluate the relationships among the hydrological variables, rainfall 299 

and wind speed. All these analyses were run in STATISTICA 8, with α = 0.05.  300 

 301 

4. Results 302 

 Our results show as inter-annual oscillations in rainfall level can affect 303 

hydrological variables in a small estuary in Amazon coast. Firstly, the 304 

influence of rainfall level was shown on salinity and chl-a data, comparing 305 

drought and non-drought period. After, rainfall level, hydrodynamics and 306 

hydrological patterns were detailed during a drought period. 307 

   308 

4.1 Influence of rainfall levels on salinity and chlorophyll-a parameters: 309 

drought and non-drought period 310 

  To show how rainfall levels can affect temporal oscillations in 311 

hydrological variables, figure 3A presents cumulative rainfall levels and 312 



 13 

averages of spatial salinity data every three months between 2012 and 2015, 313 

detaching drought and non-drought periods. This drought period was marked 314 

by the annual rainfall levels of 1552 mm in 2012 and 1612 mm in 2013, 315 

representing only 60% of the annual mean recorded between 2000 and 2015 316 

(Fig. 2). Comparing rainfall level and water salinity between 2012 and 2015, it 317 

is possible to show that a reduction in 400-500 mm during drought period 318 

(2012-2013) results in higher salinity waters (around 50%), when compared 319 

with the non-drought period of 2014 and 2015. The effects of drought and 320 

non-drought periods on the salinity of the water can also be observed in figure 321 

3B, when lower rainfall levels (June 2012) are reflected in higher salinity 322 

levels, as well as lower chl-a concentrations (Fig. 3C).  323

4.2 Hydrodynamic forces 327 

Hydrodynamic forces appear to be essential to the understanding of 328 

the spatial and temporal fluctuations observed in hydrological variables, as 329 

well as the connectivity of the tides with adjacent environments. Tides are 330 

responsible for connecting the Taperaçu with lower salinity waters, as well as 331 

with rich-nutrient environments, where oscillations in water levels (range 2–4 332 

m) were typical of mesotidal conditions (Fig. 4A). By comparing 333 

measurements from the outer and inner sectors, it was possible to observe 334 

substantial tidal attenuation when tidal waves propagate through the estuary, 335 

being of the order of 10% in the dry season (December 2012, when strong 336 

winds blew) and 50% in the rainy season (June 2013, when wind intensities 337 



 14 

were the lowest). This means that the influence of marine waters in the upper 338 

estuary is greatly reduced during rainy season. During this period, the source 339 

of freshwater provided by the wetlands located in the upper sector is at its 340 

maximum level because this area is completely flooded due to the increased 341 

rainfall. 342 

The highest tidal ranges observed during the study period were 343 

recorded in September 2012 (Fig. 4B). During the high tide, the water level 344 

reaches nutrient-rich environments such as the mangrove and other wetland 345 

areas, as well as receiving the input of less saline waters from the upper 346 

sector of the Caeté Estuary. The asymmetric pattern of the semi-diurnal tides, 347 

with a longer ebb and shorter flood tide, also contributes to the persistence of 348 

nutrient-rich waters within the estuary for longer periods. In the upper sector, 349 

for example, ebb tide periods varied from 8 h 10 min to 10 h (Fig. 4B). This 350 

asymmetry was less pronounced in the lower sector, where minimal 351 

differences were observed between the flood (5 h 30 min–6 h 10 min) and 352 

ebb (6 h 20 min–7 h 20 min) phases.  353 

An asymmetric pattern was also recorded in current intensity in the 354 

middle sector (Fig. 4C). Normally, a single peak of current intensity is 355 

observed during the ebb tide, while two or more peaks can be observed 356 

during the flood phase, with a final peak just before high tide, as a 357 

consequence of the inundation of the mangrove. A longer inundation period 358 

results in a sudden increase in ebb current intensities, as observed in 359 

September and December (0.72-0.75 m s-1). Thus, during periods of higher 360 

hydrodynamic energy, the duration of the re-suspension process varied 361 

considerably. 362

4.3 Spatial variation   366 

Spatial variations reflect the influence of the connectivity of the 367 

Taperaçu Estuary with adjacent environments, and the significant longitudinal 368 

variation in the majority of the study variables is shown in Table 1. In addition, 369 

this is a well-mixed estuary, with no significant variation (p > 0.05) being 370 

recorded between the bottom and surface layers in any of the hydrological 371 

variables. The means and standard deviations of the hydrological variables 372 

recorded at the three stations (upper, middle and lower sectors) are shown in 373 

figure 5. 374 

The highest turbidity values were found in the zone of maximum 375 

turbidity (middle sector), with mean values of above 400 NTU (Nephelometric 376 

Turbidity Unit) being recorded (Fig. 5B), and significant differences (Table 1) 377 

being found among the sectors. 378 

Salinity and pH increased downstream between the upper and lower 379 

estuary sectors (Fig. 5C). The input of freshwater from neighboring wetland 380 

areas, as well as the less saline water from the Caeté Estuary contributed to 381 

the variation in salinity (F = 53.7; p < 0.001), with values ranging from 382 

24.1±9.6 in the upper sector to 33.5±3.5 in the lower sector, and pH (F = 12.0; 383 

p < 0.001) from 7.5±0.3 (upper sector) to 7.7±0.4 (lower sector). A greater 384 

influence of winds and waves in the lower sector also contributed to the 385 

significant differences in DO and DO% (Table 1), which presented maximum 386 



 16 

means of 4.9±0.5 mg L-1 (Fig. 5D) and 107.7±10.7% in the lower sector, 387 

respectively. 388 

The connectivity of the Taperaçu Estuary with nutrient rich 389 

environments (mangroves, wetlands and the Caeté Estuary) contributes to the 390 

eutrophic characteristics of the upper sector of the Taperaçu. Thus, PO4
3-		1	  (F = 391 

40.1; p < 0.001), TDP (H = 911.1; p < 0.001), DSi (U = 2023.5; p < 0.001) and 392 

chlorophyll-a (U = 2102.0; p < 0.001) presented a gradient increasing 393 

upstream from the lower to the upper sectors with maximum mean values 394 

reaching, respectively, 1.3±1.0 µmol L-1, 1.8±1.2 µmol L-1, 124.1±77.5 µmol L-395 

1 and 26.3±28.0 mg m-3 (Fig. 5I-L). The highest mean concentrations of NO2

		1	 , 396 

NH4
+
		1	  and TDN were also observed at the upper sector (Fig. 5E and G-H), but 397 

no significant longitudinal variation (p > 0.05) was recorded (Table 1). 398

4.4 Temporal variation 404 

The temporal variation in hydrological variables was influenced by 405 

physical forces, such as rainfall and hydrodynamic processes, and also 406 

biological processes, such as photosynthesis. Temporal fluctuations were 407 

found between the months of the dry and rainy seasons, and a comparison 408 

was made between the months of June in the two years. As rainfall was 409 

higher in the first semester of 2013 (Fig. 2), June of that year was significantly 410 

richer in chlorophyll-a and dissolved nutrients (Fig. 6E and Table 1). These 411 



 17 

findings indicate that lower rainfall levels, such as those recorded in the first 412 

semester of 2012 (most intense drought period), result in more saline and less 413 

oxygenated waters, with lower nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Each 414 

hydrological variable is described below, and their monthly means and 415 

standard deviations are shown in figure 6. 416 

Water temperatures remained relatively high and stable (varying by 417 

only 2°C) throughout the study period, and significant differences were only 418 

recorded on a monthly level (Table 1). Turbidity (Fig. 6A) also showed 419 

significant monthly variation, with the highest mean values recorded in June 420 

(mainly in 2012) and in December when strong winds and currents were 421 

recorded (means > 500 NTU). A significant positive correlation (Table 2) was 422 

found between wind and turbidity (rs = 0.13; p < 0.05). 423 

On the other hand, salinity (Fig. 6B) varied considerably between 424 

seasons, resulting in significant differences between the rainy and dry 425 

seasons (p < 0.001), with more saline waters being observed during the dry 426 

season. Significant differences (Table 1) were also found among months, and 427 

the most saline waters (above 30) were recorded during the driest months. A 428 

clear difference was also found between the June of 2012 and 2013, with the 429 

more intense drought event of 2012 being reflected in more saline waters 430 

(31.9±2.1), due to both lower rainfall levels and more intense winds which 431 

result in higher evaporation. These findings are supported by a highly 432 

significant negative correlation (Table 2) between rainfall and salinity (rs = -433 

0.68; p < 0.001), and by a highly significant and positive correlation between 434 

wind speeds and salinity (rs = 0.51; p < 0.001).  435 



 18 

As for salinity, higher values were recorded in the dry season for DO, 436 

DO%, chlorophyll-a, DSi, PO4
3-		1	  and TDP. During the dry season, DO and DO% 437 

values (Fig. 6D) were at their highest (above 5.0 mg L-1 and 100%, 438 

respectively), coinciding with the most intense winds (highly significant 439 

positive correlations with DO, rs = 0.47, p < 0.001 and DO%, rs = 0.53, p < 440 

0.001) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (rs = 0.23; p < 0.001, probably due to 441 

photosynthetic activity).  442 

Significant monthly variation was also recorded in the chlorophyll-a 443 

concentrations (Table 1), with the highest concentrations (Fig. 6L) being 444 

recorded in September (25.6±31.5 mg m-3), coinciding with the least turbid 445 

water (Fig. 6A). Significant differences in chlorophyll-a concentrations (p < 446 

0.01) were also found between day and night, with higher concentrations 447 

being observed during the daylight period (14.4±9.1 mg m-3), as well as in 448 

different tidal phases, with higher concentrations being recorded during the 449 

ebb tide (16.2±12.0 mg m-3), when turbidity is reduced. However, a positive 450 

correlation was found between chlorophyll-a and turbidity (rs = 0.25; p < 451 

0.001). In addition, PO4
3-		1	
 
(rs = 0.58; p < 0.001), TDP (rs= 0.60; p < 0.001) and 452 

DSi (rs= 0.48; p < 0.001) were also significantly and positively correlated with 453 

chlorophyll-a concentrations (Table 2).  454 

 An opposite trend was recorded during periods when rainfall was 455 

higher (mainly in the rainiest months of 2013) and salinity decreased. The 456 

highly significant and negative correlation found between rainfall and wind 457 

speeds (rs= -0.70; p < 0.001) was consistent with the less oxygenated waters 458 

observed during the rainy season, but in June 2012 (most severe drought) the 459 

water was more oxygenated than in June 2013. Comparing June 2012 and 460 



 19 

June 2013, it was possible to record peaks in the concentrations of 461 

nitrogenous compounds (Fig. 6E-G), such as NO2
-
		1	  and NH4

+
		1	 , when the drought 462 

event was weaker, indicating an increase in the washout from local 463 

mangroves by the rainfall. These results are supported by the highly 464 

significant and positive correlation recorded between NO2
-
		1	 , NH4

+
		1	  and DIN and 465 

rainfall (NO2

nitrogenous compounds and salinity (NO2

 The spatial and temporal interactions shown in Table 1 reinforce the 475 

influence of both these factors, the most intense drought period (2012), and 476 

the connectivity of the Taperaçu with adjacent nutrient-rich environments, 477 

mainly near the upper and middle sectors. The interactions between sectors 478 

and months were associated with significant differences in all variables, 479 

except silicate, although no significant variation (p > 0.05) was recorded 480 

between the sectors and tidal phase in any of the hydrological variables. 481 

 482 

5. Discussion  483 

The past ten years have seen increasingly severe droughts and floods 484 

in the Amazon region, with some of these events being characterized as 485 



 20 

“once-in-a-century” occurrences (Lewis et al. 2011; Marengo et al., 2013b). 486 

Despite this, few studies have focused on the consequences of anomalous 487 

rainfall patterns on the characteristics of these coastal waters. In addition, 488 

nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations are strongly influenced by 489 

anomalous climatic events in different latitudes. Wilkerson et al. (2002), for 490 

example, investigated hydrographic, nutrient and chlorophyll-a data under 491 

typical and atypical rainfall conditions in Gulf of the Farallones. During the La 492 

Niña event, those coastal waters were richer in dissolved nutrients and 493 

chlorophyll-a concentrations when compared with the El Niño period. Similar 494 

results have been found in other parts of the world, such as the Pacific coast 495 

of Panamá (Valiela et al. 2012). More eutrophic conditions were also found in 496 

the water of the Caeté Estuary when compared periods of higher (Monteiro et 497 

al. 2016) and lower (Sousa et al. 2016) rainfall levels. But, how does the 498 

reduction in rainfall levels affect oscillations in hydrological variables in a small 499 

Amazon estuary?  500 

During the rainy season, the increased fluvial discharge dominates 501 

most Amazon estuaries (Costa et al. 2013b; Pamplona et al. 2013; Pereira et 502 

al. 2010), reducing the salinity of the region’s coastal waters, including those 503 

of the Taperaçu Estuary (Costa et al. 2013a; Magalhães et al. 2015; Souza-504 

Junior et al. 2013). Thus, the effect of the drought event seems to be greater 505 

during the rainy season, possibly because 80-90% of the total annual 506 

precipitation occurs during this period. In this study, abnormally low 507 

precipitation levels in April, May and June 2012 resulted in more saline waters 508 

in the latter month, whereas higher precipitation rates in 2013 resulted in less 509 

saline and more eutrophic waters in June. In fact, the water was less saline, 510 



 21 

more alkaline, more oxygenated, and nutrient and chlorophyll-a 511 

concentrations were much higher (over 50%) in June 2013 in comparison with 512 

the same month of the previous year, reflecting the much higher rainfall (more 513 

than 30%) during the period between March and June, in comparison with the 514 

same period in 2012. Overall, then, during the rainy season under typical 515 

conditions, these waters are less saline (over 40%, figure 3A) than those 516 

recorded during this drought period and much less saline (over 60%, i.e., 517 

around 10) under a La Niña event (Andrade et al. 2016), showing that this 518 

small estuary was adversely affected by the drought event.  519 

 In addition, TDN reached higher concentrations, mainly in June 2013 520 

(higher precipitation rates), while negative correlations were recorded 521 

between NH4
+
		1	  and NO2

-
		1	  and salinity (Table 2). The highest concentrations of 522 

nitrate was also recorded in June 2013, when in comparison with the same 523 

month of the previous year. Pereira et al. (2013) showed that, during the rainy 524 

season of a La Niña event near the study area, hydrological conditions are 525 

accentuated by the increased rainfall levels and fluvial discharge, with the 526 

coastal waters becoming less saline, and richer in dissolved nutrients.  527 

In an adjacent area, Wolf et al. (2000) showed that 10% of all biological 528 

productivity (g m-2
 

yr-1) may be derived from  phytoplankton and 529 

microphytobenthos (mainly diatoms). In this study, chlorophyll-a 530 

concentrations (indirect metric of biomass) were also highest in the upper 531 

sector of the estuary, mainly during non-drought period (Fig. 3C) reinforcing 532 

the influence of the anomalous climatic event on hydrological variables. The 533 

increasing penetration of sunlight into the water column in September appears 534 

to have created ideal conditions for the growth of phytoplankton and 535 



 22 

microphytobenthos, as indicated by the higher chl-a concentrations. The lower 536 

nitrogenous concentrations recorded during this month were probably a 537 

consequence of intense autotrophic consumption, as indicated by the high 538 

chl-a concentrations. On the other hand, the positive correlation between chl-539 

a and turbidity (Table 2) indicates that the re-suspension of the mangrove 540 

detritus and the microphytobenthos may have also contributed to the increase 541 

in chl-a concentrations, as reported for other tropical estuaries (Wollf et al. 542 

2000, Murolo et al. 2006, Pamplona et al. 2013).  543 

  Comparing our results with those of other studies of mangrove regions, 544 

it is possible to confirm that this minor estuary sustains similar chlorophyll-a 545 

concentrations to those found in much larger Amazonian estuaries (even 546 

during a period of intense drought), such as the Paracauari (up to 26 mg m-3; 547 

Costa et al. 2013a) and Quatipuru (up to 30 mg m-3; Pamplona et al. 2013), 548 

and even higher concentrations than those found in other tropical estuaries 549 

under similar rainfall levels (up to 5 mg m-3; Pan et al. 2016) and sub-tropical 550 

estuaries under different rainfall levels (up to 15 mg m-3; Hart et al. 2015).”  551 

However, what is the origin of the nutrients in an estuary with absence 552 

of any direct fluvial discharge? On the Amazon coast, tidal range plays an 553 

important role in the determination of the dissolved nutrient profile due to the 554 

flooding of the extensive areas of mangrove during each tidal cycle. The high 555 

tide may connect certain nutrient-rich environments, as in the present study 556 

area, where the flooding of the Taici Creek creates a connection with the 557 

Caeté River, and the flooding of adjacent mangroves and wetland areas leads 558 

to an additional input of less saline water and richer in dissolved nutrients and 559 

chlorophyll-a, mainly in the upper sector. Studies have shown that the water in 560 



 23 

the upper and middle sectors of the Caeté Estuary (where the Taici Creek is 561 

located) are less saline during the rainy season (i.e., around zero) and slightly 562 

richer in nitrogenous compounds, for example, with average total dissolved 563 

nitrogen around 30% (approximately 30 µmol L-1) higher than the levels 564 

recorded in the Taperaçu estuary (Monteiro et al. 2016; Sousa et al. 2016). It 565 

thus seems reasonable to assume that the Caeté Estuary can be an important 566 

source of nutrients for the Taperaçu Estuary.  567 

Another factor contributing to the nutrient concentrations in the upper 568 

sector is the storage of water in the mangrove sediment. In a tidal creek in the 569 

adjacent Caeté Estuary (“Furo do Meio”), Dittmar and Lara (2001) showed 570 

that water may be stored in the mangrove sediment following inundation or 571 

rainfall, and is then released during the ebb tide. In the present study, the 572 

comparison of the salinity levels over the tide cycle in June (2012 and 2013) 573 

indicated that the water was most saline during 2012, when the drought was 574 

most intense. In both years, however, salinity decreased during the ebb-low 575 

tide, indicating that pluvial water was stored in the mangrove and then 576 

released during the ebb tide, in particular in 2013, coinciding with the highest 577 

PO4
3-		1	 , TDP and DSi concentrations. 578 

 Overall, the upper and middle sectors presented similar hydrological 579 

conditions when compared with the lower sector. However, an opposite 580 

pattern was recorded in the majority of the study variables recorded in June 581 

2012 and 2013 (one-way ANOVA, Table 1). Significant differences were also 582 

found among the spatial and temporal interactions (two-factor ANOVA, Table 583 

1) reinforcing the influence of the lower rainfall level in 2012, and the 584 



 24 

connectivity between the upper and middle sectors with adjacent nutrient-rich 585 

environments.  586 

  587 

6. Final Considerations 588 

Our results showed how physical forces can influence the oscillations 589 

in hydrological variables in a small Amazon estuary during a drought event. 590 

As would be expected for an estuary with no major freshwater input and high 591 

levels of hydrodynamic energy, there is little vertical variation in the water 592 

column, although marked longitudinal gradients were found among the three 593 

sectors of the estuary. Rainfall is the principal physical variable controlling 594 

local hydrological oscillations, and when precipitation decreases, as observed 595 

during a drought event, the water becomes more saline, and has reduced 596 

dissolved inorganic nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The 597 

considerable local tidal range also plays an important role in the control of 598 

local phytoplankton biomass and the profile of dissolved nutrients through the 599 

inundation of adjacent mangroves and wetland areas. The connection to the 600 

neighboring Caeté Estuary through the Taici Creek further contributes to the 601 

influx of less saline and nutrient-enriched waters. Given the combination of 602 

these processes, the Taperaçu, despite being a relatively small estuary, plays 603 

an important role in the input of dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll-a to the 604 

adjacent coastal waters, even during a period of intense drought. It seems 605 

likely that these observations can contribute to the understanding of the 606 

effects of equivalent conditions (i.e., drought events) in other minor estuaries 607 

on the highly indented Amazon coast, as well as in other areas of the 608 

equatorial zone with similar environmental characteristics. 609

Table 1. Summary of the univariate statistical analyses of the hydrological variables and chlorophyll-a in the Taperaçu estuary, northern Brazil. 

The spatial (sectors) and temporal scales (season, month and tide phase) were evaluated by ANOVA, and the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis 

tests. If the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test indicated significant variation among stations or months, a posteriori pair-wise Fisher’s LSD and 

Student-Newman-Keuls analyses were run. The interactions between sectors vs. seasons and sectors vs. months were assessed by a two-factor 

ANOVA.
