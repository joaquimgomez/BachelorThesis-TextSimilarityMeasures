A ferrofluid-based sensor to measure bottom shear stresses under currents 1 

and waves 2 

ABSTRACT 3 

The measurement of the near-bottom flow characteristics is crucial to correctly understand coastal 4 

processes. Aiming at overcoming some of the limits of present state-of-the-art measuring instruments, 5 

we propose a novel approach to measure bottom shear stress under currents and waves based on the 6 

exploitation of magneto-rheological fluids, named ferrofluids. In particular the deformation of a 7 

magnetically controlled ferrofluid drop O(0.01 ml) is transduced by a conditioning circuit into an 8 

output voltage which is proportional to the bottom shear stress. Calibration curves are presented for 9 

both steady-current and regular wave conditions, over fixed and weakly mobile beds, by showing that 10 

the behaviour of the proposed measuring system can be assumed linear. In the range of the investigated 11 

parameters, it is shown that the working range is comprised between 0.08 N/m2 and an upper limit 12 

which is a function of the controlling magnetic field and of the flow type. 13 

Keywords: magneto-rheological fluids, bottom shear stress measurement, gravity waves, 14 

transducer, Rosensweig effect 15 

1 Introduction 16 

The measure of shear stresses close to solid boundaries is crucial in several fields, ranging 17 

from hydraulics to aerospace. The interaction between flow and solid walls influences to a 18 

great extent the characteristics of the flow itself. In hydraulics, the knowledge of wall shear 19 

stresses is fundamental to evaluate energy dissipation of the flow and to assess the flow 20 

interaction with the bottom. This is extremely relevant not only to optimize the design of 21 

pipelines or open-channels, but also to investigate and quantify sediment transport processes 22 

in rivers, estuaries or along the coasts. In other research fields, such as automotive, naval or 23 

aerospace industries, the correct evaluation of wall shear stresses is needed to design 24 

solutions, shapes and materials which allow to reduce energy losses and in turn fuel 25 

consumption. 26 

In the past, bed shear stresses have been measured by means of simple instruments, 27 

such as Preston tubes and Stanton tubes (Head and Rechenberg, 1962). Nowadays, bottom 28 

shear stresses 0 are still indirectly derived from the logarithmic velocity profile or integral 29 

momentum method, by using acoustic sensors, such as Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter 30 

(Musumeci, Cavallaro, Foti, Scandura, and Blondeaux, 2006) or optical sensors, such as 31 

Laser Doppler Velocimeter or PIV systems (Cox, Kobayashi, and Okayasu, 1996; Nimmo 32 

Smith, Atsavapranee, Katz, and Osborne, 2002). Direct measurements of the bed shear 33 

stresses can be performed by using flush mounted shear plates, which integrate the force over 34 



a relatively large area (Riedel, Kamphuis, and Brebner, 1974; Rankin and Hires, 2000; Barnes 1 

and Baldock, 2007; You, Yin, and Huo, 2009). In the aerospace community, in the last 2 

decade, great attention has been devoted to direct measurements of bed shear stresses by 3 

means of Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)-based sensors, which exploit the 4 

capabilities of silicon micro-machining technology (Löfdhal and Gad-el-Hak, 1999; 5 

Rezazadeh, Loftiani, and Khalilarya, 2009). Thermal sensors are also widely used. For 6 

example, hot film anemometers relate the intensity of flow or shear to the forced convection 7 

of heat from the sensor surface (Gust, 1988; Sumer, Arnskov, Christiansen, and Jorgensen, 8 

1993). Recently, bioluminescent organisms have been used to map shear stress over a rippled 9 

seabed (Foti, Faraci, Foti, and Bonanno, 2010). However, difficulties emerged, since 10 

dinoflagellates used to sense the shear stresses can survive only under controlled temperatures 11 

and salinity of the water and their bioluminescence is emitted at night and consequently 12 

experiments had to be carried out during the night, which is not efficient for the facility 13 

operation.  14 

For extensive reviews of the available methodologies and instruments used to 15 

estimate wall shear stress, the reader is referred to the work of Winter (1977),  Ackerman and 16 

Hoover (2001), Naughton and Sheplak (2002), Wallace and Vukoslavčević (2010), 17 

Bagherimiyab and Lemmin (2013), and Musumeci, Marletta, Andò, Baglio and Foti (2015a). 18 

Table 1 summarizes some of the main characteristics of the measuring systems presently 19 

used, along with their advantages and disadvantages. It appears that the latters are mainly 20 

related to: (i) the capability to obtain point measurements of small bottom shear stress using a 21 

robust system; (ii) the fact that several methodologies rely on the validity of the logarithmic 22 

profile; (iii) non-uniqueness of the calibration relationship; (iv) sources of error due to 23 

misalignments between the flow and the axis of the instrument, and to mechanical or thermal 24 

disturbing processes; (v) high fragility of the sensors which cannot be used in the presence, 25 

for example, of moving sediments. 26 

Aiming at complementing the present available instrumentations and at obtaining a 27 

measurement methodology that can be applied also in the presence of sandy bottoms, over 28 

which state-of-the-art-instruments usually fail, in the present work we investigate the 29 

performances of an innovative ferrofluid sensor able to measure bottom shear stresses under 30 

currents and waves, which exploits the Rosensweig effect (Cowley and Rosensweig, 1967). 31 

Preliminary tests of the measuring systems have been performed by Musumeci, 32 

Marletta, Andò, Baglio, and Foti (2015b), based on a limited set of steady current 33 

experiments in the presence of a smooth fixed bed, and by Musumeci et al. (2015a) in the 34 

presence of regular surface waves on a rough bottom covered with medium-coarse sand. 35 

However, in the above previous works not only the number of tested flow conditions was 36 



limited, but also neither the effects on the performances of the system of the strength of the 1 

external magnetic forces that generate the Rosensweig effect were systematically quantified 2 

nor movable beds were considered to investigate possible disturbances of the impacts of 3 

moving sediments on the ferrofluid sensor. Moreover, a comparison between the behavior of 4 

the system in steady and oscillatory flows was not performed. 5 

The aim of the present contribution is to characterize the behavior of the proposed 6 

ferrofluid sensor under both steady currents and regular surface waves. In particular, here, 7 

two extensive experimental campaigns, one in steady flow conditions, over a smooth fixed 8 

bed, and one under regular surface waves over a coarser and a finer sandy bottoms, are 9 

presented. The results allow to define the range of application of the proposed measuring 10 

system and to quantitatively assess the errors of the calibration relationship as a function of 11 

the sensor setup and of the flow conditions, both in unidirectional flow and in oscillatory 12 

flows. 13 

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the measurement 14 

methodology based on the use of the ferrofluid, the experimental methodology implemented 15 

to create the ferrofluid sensor through the Rosensweig effect, and the architecture of the 16 

inductive transducer; Section 3 describes the experimental campaign carried out to validate 17 

the proposed measuring system in the presence of steady currents and of regular waves; 18 

Section 4 presents the experimental results, while in Section 5 the calibration of the proposed 19 

methodology is discussed along with an estimate of the measuring errors. The main 20 

conclusions  along with possible future developments are summarized in Section 6. 21 

2 Ferrofluid-based measurement methodology  22 

Ferrofluids are two-state systems made up by solid small ferromagnetic particles (size 23 

1÷15 nm) dispersed in an organic non-magnetic liquid solvent (Odenbach, 2002). Such 24 

materials behave like Newtonian liquid when the applied magnetic field is null or very small. 25 

If a critical magnetization is achieved, ferrofluids can experience forces due to magnetic 26 

polarization (Odenbach, 2004). At the microscopic scale, long chains of particles are formed 27 

in the direction of the magnetic field, whereas at the macro-scale a series of hexagonal pattern 28 

deformations aligned along the magnetic field appears (Cowley and Rosensweig, 1967). Such 29 

a phenomenon is known in the literature as Rosensweig effect and it disappears as soon as the 30 

magnetic field is removed. Figure 1(a) shows an example of such an effect with the formation 31 

of hexagonal conical patterns induced on a relatively large amount of ferrofluid O(10 ml) by 32 

an external magnetic field. Figure 1(b) schematically visualizes how such patterns are aligned 33 

along the magnetic field line. The application of a magnetic field on a small amount of 34 

ferrofluid induces the generation of a single fluidic pattern with a conical shape (see Figure 1c 35 



and 1d), whose axis is aligned with the direction of the magnetic field, and whose dimensions 1 

are very small, since the height of the ferrofluid spike is O(1 mm) (see Figure 2). 2 

Being non-miscible with water, the ferrofluid spike acts as a sensor of the bottom 3 

shear stresses. Indeed, in hydrostatic conditions the forces acting on the ferrofluid are its own 4 

weight, the hydrostatic forces and the external magnetic field. In this condition, the ferrofluid 5 

spike remains where it has been generated, i.e. at the measuring station (see Figures  1c and 6 

3a). Besides the gravitational and the magnetic forces, G and M, under the action of a water 7 

flow, the ferrofluid is also subject to dynamic forces, such as the pressure drag D, lift L, 8 

friction on the surface of the spike Fs, and drag generated at the bottom of the ferrofluid spike 9 

Db. The order of magnitude of the forces involved in the dynamic equilibrium can be 10 

estimated by assuming similarities with other types of flows. In particular, by approximating 11 

the volume of the ferrofluid spike to that of a cone with the same diameter and the same 12 

height, the weight of the control volume G is O(10-5 N). The magnetic force M exerted by the 13 

permanent magnets to generate the spike and to keep it in place could not be directly 14 

measured at present. However, it turns out that such a force should be large enough to 15 

compensate the largest force in the equilibrium, which would be otherwise not equilibrated. 16 

The mean form drag force exerted on the spike due to pressure in the flow direction D should 17 

be O(10-7 ÷10-4 N), with the drag coefficient 1.5÷2.5, i.e. approximatively equal to that of a 18 

cylinder in the same range of Reynolds numbers (Sumer and Fredsøe, 1997). The lift force L, 19 

which is orthogonal to the flow direction, should be O(10-7 ÷10-4 N), where the lift coefficient 20 

has been assumed equal to the mean value of the measurements on rigid cone of Okamoto and 21 

Yagita (1977), which is about 0.3. The friction generated on the surface of the ferrofluid spike 22 

Fs should be O(10
-7 ÷10-4 N), since considering a similarity with the case of smooth and rough 23 

cylinders, it has been demonstrated by Achenbach (1968) that Fs is 2-3% of D. Concerning 24 

Db, this is the drag generated at the base of the ferrofluid spike by bottom shear stresses. 25 

Indeed, since the ferrofluid remains at the liquid state, a circulation at the base of the 26 

ferrofluid must be induced at the bottom of the ferrofluid, as a consequence of the continuity 27 

of velocity and pressure at the water-ferrofluid interface. Several simplifying hypotheses can 28 

be considered to get a rough estimate of the order of magnitude of Db. First of all, the shear 29 

stresses at the bottom of the ferrofluid can be estimated by assuming a Newtonian behavior. 30 

Moreover the vertical velocity gradient is assumed similar to that of the outside water, since 31 

at the interface the water velocity and the ferrofluid velocity must be the same. Finally 32 

considering that the mean value of the dynamic viscosity of the ferrofluid should vary in the 33 

range 5÷9 Pa·s (Roszkowski, Bogdan, Skczynski and Marek, 2008), it turns out that the order 34 

of magnitude of Db  should be O(10
4 N). 35 

Considering the above hypotheses, it appears that the largest force in the equilibrium 36 

should be the drag force at the bottom of the ferrofluid spike, mainly because of the very large 37 



dynamic viscosity of the ferrofluid material. All the other forces, except the magnetic force 1 

which must compensate Db, are very small and can be neglected. It turns out that under the 2 

flow action, the dynamic equilibrium leads to deformations and displacements of the 3 

ferrofluid spike, which are thus proportional to the magnitude of the bottom shear stress. 4 

Figures 3b and 3c qualitatively show how the displacement of the ferrofluid spike 5 

increases as the bed shear stress increases. It follows that through an appropriate calibration of 6 

the system, shear stress measurements can be obtained by recovering the deformation of the 7 

spike. It should be mentioned that the frequency response of the ferrofluid spike to the action 8 

of the water flow is O(5Hz) (Andò, Baglio and Beninato, 2012). Therefore the proposed 9 

system is suitable to measure Reynolds-averaged flow characteristics and it cannot be used 10 

for turbulence measurements. 11 

Andò, Baglio, Trigona, and Faraci (2009) were the first to discuss the possibility to 12 

measure the near-bottom velocity profile by qualitatively observing the deformation of a 13 

ferrofluid, using a web-cam. In the present work a small drop of ferrofluid, O(0.01 ml), 14 

subject to the Rosensweig effect located at the bed is used to estimate bottom shear stress, by 15 

quantitatively measuring the deformation and displacement of the ferrofluid spike induced by 16 

the action of the flow through of an inductive readout strategy. 17 

2.1 Inductive readout strategy 18 

The transfer of the displacement of the ferrofluid spike’s center of mass  into a measurable 19 

output signal is carried out by means of an on purpose developed inductive readout strategy 20 

which makes use of two copper planar coils photoligraphically engraved onto a printed circuit 21 

board. The architecture of the inductive transducer which senses the flow-induced has been 22 

preliminarily investigated by Musumeci et al. (2015b). 23 

In particular, a PET (PolyEthylene Terephthalate) substrate 100 µm thick was used to 24 

cover the planar coils in order to electrically isolate the coils from the water and the ferrofluid 25 

drop. The ferrofluid drop is located above the two engraved copper coils. Below the flume 26 

bottom, one or more permanent magnets are used to generate the external magnetic field, 27 

which at the same time produces the ferrofluid spike and maintains it at the measuring station. 28 

In order to obtain a single spike shape, an iron nail is used to concentrate the external 29 

magnetic field. In the case of movable bottom experiments, to contrast buoyancy or drag 30 

effects on the coils, the proposed system can be easily buried within the sand by using a 31 

support of the board to increase the weight and to facilitate the burial. Here a 32 

Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) Perspexplate about 1 cm thick, 6 cm width an 15 cm long 33 

is used.  34 

The ferrofluid spike sits initially in the middle between the two coils. The movement 35 



of the ferrofluid spike, due to the external water flow, produces a variation in the magnetic 1 

permeability  of the water layer adjoining the two coils and consequently a variation of the 2 

inductance L in both the coils. A conditioning circuit is used to transduce the variation of 3 

inductance into a direct current (DC) signal, whose value is proportional to the ferrofluid's 4 

movement. The system is calibrated in such a way that in hydrostatic conditions the output 5 

voltage Vout is null and in dynamic condition a Vout different from zero is obtained, which is 6 

proportional to the flow. The design of the conditioning circuit has been carefully addressed 7 

in order to reach a stable behaviour of the system. A detailed description of the components of 8 

the conditioning circuit was provided in Musumeci et al. (2015a) and in Musumeci et al. 9 

(2015b). 10 

 11 

3 Experimental campaign 12 

The experimental calibration of the system for measuring bed shear stresses under currents 13 

and waves has been carried out at the Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Catania. 14 

In the present experiments, the commercial ferrofluid EFH1 produced by the 15 

multinational company Ferrotec (www.ferrotec.com) has been used. Such a ferrofluid is 16 

specifically designed for educational purposes, therefore it presents negligible hazards for 17 

human health and environment. Moreover, during the experiments, about 80% of the 18 

employed ferrofluid has been retrieved from the experimental setup and reused. The waste of 19 

the very tiny amount of ferrofluid, which could not be recycled, has been treated according to 20 

the national procedure on disposal of waste oils. Although the exact composition of the 21 

material is a proprietary information of Ferrotec, the data sheet provided by the producer 22 

reveals that the mixture is made up by magnetite (about 3-15% of the volume), an oil soluble 23 

dispersant (6-30% of the volume) and a carrier liquid (55-91% of the volume). The specific 24 

gravity is about 1.195. 25 

The volume of ferrofluid used to generate the ferrofluid spike by Rosensweig effect is 26 

equal or smaller than 0.02ml in all the experiments. Such a volume has been optimized to 27 

easily obtain a single ferrofluid spike by using an insulin syringe. Indeed a larger drop would 28 

generate more than one spike, due to the action of external magnetic field. On the other hand, 29 

it is difficult to produce a smaller drop. To create the Rosensweig effect, several types of 30 

permanent magnets with different attraction forces F, sold by Supermagnete 31 

(www.supermagnete.it), have been used (see Table 2). Since, the dynamic equilibrium of the 32 

ferrofluidic sensor is at leading order the result of the balance between the intensity of the 33 

external retaining magnetic field and the hydrodynamic forces related to the bottom shear 34 

stress, in order to quantitatively assess the effect of the first one on the measurement system, 35 

http://www.ferrotec.com/
http://www.supermagnete.it/


various combinations of permanents magnets are considered during the tests. 1 

Preliminary tests have been carried out by Musumeci et al. (2015a) in order to assess 2 

the behaviour of the conditioning circuit in hydrostatic conditions. In particular, the system 3 

has been used within a tank with water depths which varied in the range h=0÷60 cm. It has 4 

been found that the relationship between changes of the hydrostatic water level h and of the 5 

output voltage of the conditioning circuit Vout is linear. The relationship h=-1.81Vout is 6 

independent on the intensity of the external controlling magnetic field and on the presence of 7 

the ferrofluid, therefore it is a characteristic of the conditioning circuit. 8 

The experimental calibration of the proposed measurement system has been 9 

performed considering two types of flow conditions: steady currents and regular waves. 10 

3.1 Steady current tests 11 

In order to produce highly repeatable experimental conditions, the proposed measuring 12 

system has been applied in a small scale flume, which is 3.60 m long, 0.15 m wide and 0.36 13 

m high. In the present experiments, the bottom is smooth and the slope is equal to 1.36%. A 14 

constant discharge has been recirculated by means of an electro-pump. The value of the 15 

discharge can be accurately set by means of a control weir coupled with an electromagnetic 16 

flowmeter.  In the present tests, subcritical steady flow conditions with a decelerated current 17 

are considered.  18 

In order to guarantee that the bottom boundary layer is fully developed, the ferrofluid 19 

drop has been located at a distance of 2.57m from the flow entrance to the flume. The 20 

ferrofluid sits at the center of the printed circuit board, which is glued onto the PMMA flume 21 

bottom. The iron nail used to focus the lines of the external controlling magnetic field is 22 

inserted in a small hole on the lower external side of the flume bottom itself and the 23 

permanent magnets are attached below it.  24 

A 10MHz Sontek micro-Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) has been used to obtain 25 

measurements of the mean velocity profiles. The control volume of the ADV is a cylinder 9 26 

mm high with a volume equal to 0.3 cm3, located 5 cm far from the transmitter. The time-27 

averaged velocity profiles are calculated by averaging the 3D velocity time series measured at 28 

least at ten elevations in the range 0.5-5 cm above the bed. Each time series is 60 seconds 29 

long, with a sampling frequency equal to 30 Hz. The water depth h at the measuring station is 30 

measured by means of a water level gauge throughout the experiments, being in the range 31 

10.5÷11.0 cm for all the investigated steady current conditions. 32 

Figure 4 shows a sketch of the experimental apparatus and the setup of the ferrofluid 33 

sensor and of the printed circuit board with the two planar coils. 34 



In order to obtain an estimate of the average bottom shear stresses, the ADV’s 1 

measurements have been best-fitted within the log layer (y
+
>30 ) using the classical wall log 2 

law to estimate the friction velocity u* and, in turn, the bottom shear stress x0. Besides the 3 

value of x0, the estimated value of u* allows to determine the average velocity at the 4 

ferrofluid location UFF, as the theoretical velocity at y
+
=yFF·u*/, with yFF=1mm. A shown in 5 

Figure 5, depending on the flow conditions, the ferrofluid tip may be located in in the log 6 

layer, in the buffer layer (5<y
+
<30) or in the viscous sublayer (y

+
<5), where the linear law 7 

and the van Driest’s profiles respectively hold.8 

By varying the recirculated water discharge, the velocity UFF varies within the range 9 

0÷20 cm/s. Table 3 reports a summary of the investigated experimental conditions, in terms 10 

of water depth h , estimated depth-averaged mean velocity in the flow direction U , velocity 11 

at the ferrofluid location UFF, bottom shear stress x0 and Reynolds number Re=Uh/.  12 

In order to determine the effect of the intensity of the controlling magnetic field on the 13 

sensitivity of the sensor and on the repeatability of the measurements, several tests have been 14 

carried out in the presence of steady currents by changing the number and types of permanent 15 

magnets used to generate the Rosensweig effect on the ferrofluid drop. Some combinations of 16 

permanent magnets have been used at least three times to verify the repeatability of the 17 

measurements. Table 4 reports an overview of the investigated combinations of permanent 18 

magnets used to generate the Rosensweig effect on the ferrofluid drop. An estimate of the 19 

overall nominal attraction force F is also shown in the Table. Since it is extremely difficult to 20 

measure the effective magnetic field in the presence of water, here, for simplicity sake, it is 21 

assumed that F increases linearly with the specific attraction force of each magnet. Such a 22 

simplification provides an indication of the magnetic force acting on the ferrofluid. Each one 23 

of the combinations reported in Table 4 has been tested by varying the near-bottom velocities 24 

from the minimum to the maximum value, i.e. by considering the flow conditions described in 25 

Table 3. The experiments performed in still water conditions are used as reference condition 26 

(e.g. flow condition C0 in Table 3). 27 

3.2 Regular wave tests 28 

The proposed measurement methodology has been tested in the presence of regular surface 29 

waves as well. The experiments have been carried out in a wave tank which is 18 m long, 3.6 30 

m wide and 1 m deep, equipped with an electronically-controlled hydraulic piston-type 31 

wavemaker. At the onshore end of the tank a 1:5 planar sloping beach made up by marble 32 

stones (d50=3cm) allows to control wave reflection within the tank. 33 

During wave tests, the printed circuit board with the two copper coils has been glued 34 



onto a Perspex plate about 1 cm thick. The plate serves as a support for the iron nail and the 1 

permanent magnets. Such a system replicates the setup used for the steady current tests, but in 2 

the present case it has been partly buried into a sandy bottom, with the surface of the coils at 3 

the level of the initial bed, to test the behaviour of the system in the presence of sediments. 4 

Two types of well-sorted quartz sand have been used in the tests, characterized by a median 5 

diameter equal to d50=0.24 mm and d50=0.56 mm respectively. The measuring point is located 6 

about 8 m onshore of the wavemaker, at a section where the wave motion is fully developed. 7 

A resistive wave gauge has been used to measure the characteristics of the waves, such as 8 

water depth h, wave period Twave and wave height H, by adopting a zero-upcrossing method. 9 

Figure 6 shows a planar view of the experimental wave tank along with the setup of 10 

the ferrofluid sensor with the printed circuit board on the coarser sandy bottom. It may be 11 

noticed that the dimensions of the ferrofluid spike are similar to that of the sediments. 12 

Monochromatic waves have been generated with water depths in the range 13 

h=0.20÷0.30 m, wave heights in the range H=0.06÷6.66 cm and  wave periods in the range 14 

Twave=0.10÷2.01s. The characteristics of the waves have been set to obtain waves both in 15 

deep, intermediate and shallow water depths. In particular, deep water tests have been 16 

performed to test the behaviour of the conditioning circuit. Indeed, while the ferrofluid 17 

sensors is not deformed if there is no flow at the bottom, the conditioning circuit could be in 18 

principle be influenced by the varying total water depth. Deep water conditions provide an 19 

ideal situation in which the free surface elevation changes, but the bottom shear stress should 20 

be null, therefore the ferrofluid deformation should be null and in turn the output voltage 21 

should be negligible. 22 

By applying linear wave theory, the wavelength Lwave, the amplitude of the potential 23 

velocity at the bottom in the wave direction U0 and the oscillations amplitude at the bottom A 24 

can be estimated. The maximum wave bottom shear stress 0max is estimated as a function of 25 

the wave friction factor fw=20max/|U0|
2
. Since the bottom is rough, the present tests are in the 26 

transitional regime, therefore f should be in principle a function of both the Reynolds number 27 

Rew=AU0/, where  is the kinematic viscosity, and of the relative roughness A/kN, where kN is 28 

Nikuradse roughness, which can be estimated as kN=2.5d50. In this regime, in principle the 29 

implicit formula proposed by Myrhaug (1989) could be used to estimate fw. However, it turns 30 

out that in the region of the present Reynolds number Rew and relative roughness 31 

A/kN<36, the predictions of the Myrhaug’s formula collapse in the laminar regime, where 32 

ww
f Re2 .  33 

In order to investigate the behaviour of the ferrofluid sensor and of the inductive 34 

readout measurement strategy: (i) a smaller and a stronger external magnetic controlling force 35 

have been considered, by using a series of two or four permanent magnets of the type S0805 36 



(nominal force F=19.61 N each); (ii) the gain of the conditioning circuit G, which allows to 1 

amplify the output voltage signal, has been varied in the range G=11.6÷25.0. 2 

Table 5 summarizes the characteristics of the total 83 wave experiments, indicating 3 

for each series of tests: the number of tests, the type and number of permanent magnets used 4 

to generate the Rosenseweig effect on the ferrofluid, the value of the gain G of the 5 

conditioning circuit, the ranges of water depth h, wave height H and wave period Twave. 6 

Additionally to the experiments performed in the presence of regular surface waves, for each 7 

test series a hydrostatic experiment has been carried out. Table 5 reports also the range of the 8 

investigated dimensionless wave parameters, namely the Reynolds number of the wave 9 

boundary layer Rew=U0A/, the relative roughness A/kN, and the maximum Shields parameter 10 

max=max/g(s-1)d50. In particular, the values of the critical Shields parameter (Soulsby, 11 

1997), which are equal to 0.046 for test series WS001-S003 and to 0.030 for test series 12 

WS004-WS006, indicate that in about the 30% of the tests the threshold of motion of the 13 

sediments was exceeded, giving rise to a weakly mobile bed over which moving sediment 14 

particles impacts on the ferrofluid sensors. 15

4 Results 17 

4.1 Steady current results 18 

The proposed ferrofluid sensor and the inductive readout strategy described in Section 2 have 19 

been first tested in steady current conditions over a fixed smooth bottom. These are highly 20 

repeatable tests which allow to define the range of application of the system, to investigate the 21 

existence of a unique calibration curve and its dependence on the controlling parameters.  22 

Preliminary results proved that the influence of the thermal and electronic instability of 23 

the conditioning circuit is negligible, since the maximum uncertainty of repeated measurements 24 

is about 0.3% (Musumeci et al., 2015b). The specific aim of the present experimental campaign 25 

has been instead to assess the influence of the intensity of the external controlling magnetic 26 

field on the ferrofluid measurements. 27 

Figure 7 shows the relationship between the average output voltage Vout measured by 28 

the conditioning circuits and the velocity at the ferrofluid location UFF, i.e. the velocity at 1 mm 29 

above the bottom. In particular, the Figure shows the experimental data of repeated tests carried 30 

out by using a smaller intensity (nominal force F=2·19.61 N, see Figure 9a); a medium intensity 31 

(nominal force F=2·24.51 N, see Figure 9b) and a larger intensity (nominal force F=3·19.61 32 

N, see Figure 9c) of the external controlling magnetic field generated by the permanent magnets 33 

(see Table 4). 34 



When using the weaker magnets (Figure 7a and 7b), the relationship between the 1 

velocity at the ferrofluid UFF and the measured output voltage is consistent within each 2 

individual test, as it follows a parabolic shape with small scatter. However, by comparing 3 

repeated trials performed in the same hydraulic conditions using the same number and type of 4 

magnets, the calibration curves obtained for each tests are different. On the other hand, when a 5 

stronger controlling force is exerted on the ferrofluid spike, all the data collapses on the same 6 

curve (see Figure 7c). In the presence of weaker retaining magnetic force, the equilibrium 7 

condition of the conditioning circuit, and in turn the measured calibration curve, may be 8 

affected by small differences in the condition of the experimental set-up (i.e. ambient 9 

temperature, salinity of the water, slight change of the electrical input signal, etc.). Moreover, 10 

being the ferrofluid spike less stiff (then more deformable) it can assume different possible 11 

shapes under the effect of a flow, due to the interaction with the magnetic field lines in the 12 

neighbourhood, thus producing different variations of the inductance of the sensing coils. Such 13 

spurious effects become less important when the retaining force is larger. The grey area reported 14 

in Figure 7 indicates a region within which the sensitivity of measuring system is low. Indeed, 15 

when the velocity UFF is small, the action of the external magnetic controlling force prevails on 16 

the action of the flow and the ferrofluid spike is only slightly deformed. In principle, the lower 17 

limit for the application of the proposed measurement methodology is a function of the external 18 

magnetic force and of the volume of the ferrofluid drop. However, as shown in Figure 7, the 19 

variability of such a threshold is quite small in the tested conditions and the value UFF=0.08 20 

m/s is considered reasonable in all cases. It should be mentioned that an upper limit of the flow 21 

intensity also exists for the application of the present measurement system. Indeed, if the flow 22 

velocity at the ferrofluid tip is too large, the force of the permanent magnets which generates 23 

the Rosensweig effect may not be large enough to keep the ferrofluid at the measuring point 24 

and the ferrofluid drop can be carried away with the flow. By using the combinations of 25 

controlling magnetic forces reported in Table 4, it has been found that when UFF is larger than 26 

0.2 m/s, the proposed methodology cannot be applied. 27 

Figure 8 reports the relationship between the measured output voltage Vout and the 28 

average bottom shear stress x0, for the same test conditions considered in Figure 7. Also in this 29 

case a lower limit and an upper limit of the average bottom shear stress are recovered when 30 

applying the proposed methodology for measuring bottom shear stresses in the presence of 31 

steady currents. In the investigated conditions, such limits are about equal to 0.08 N/m2 and to 32 

0.2 N/m2, respectively. In particular, the experimental results demonstrate that the response of 33 

the proposed methodology can be assumed to be linear above the lower threshold. Moreover, 34 

also in this case, a large scatter is recovered in the presence of weaker intensities of the external 35 

controlling magnetic field and the collapse of the experimental data on the same curve is 36 

observed when such an intensity is larger. This indicates that the permanent magnetic field 37 



should be strong enough, compared to the flow intensity, to reduce the uncertainties of the 1 

measurements and to make the proposed measurement system reliable within its range of 2 

application.  3 

4.2 Regular wave tests 4 

Regular wave tests in the presence of sandy bed have been performed to analyze (i) the range 5 

of application of the system in oscillating flows, particularly in deep, intermediate and shallow 6 

water conditions, and (ii) to assess the sensitiveness to changes of the retaining force or of the 7 

gain of the circuit. In this case the bed is characterized by a weak mobility (see Table 5). 8 

Therefore wave experiments have been aimed also at testing the “survival” of the ferrofluid 9 

sensor, notwithstanding the fact that several sand grains impact on the spike. Indeed it is known 10 

that hot films probes, for example, are damaged by the action of sediments on the sensor. 11 

In the case of an oscillating flow, values of the bottom shear stress vary between 0max 12 

and –0max during the wave cycle. Therefore, the testing of the ferrofluid sensor in oscillating 13 

conditions must take into account the frequency response of the overall measuring system and 14 

the influence of control parameters (e.g. the intensity of the external permanent magnetic field 15 

and of the gain of the conditioning circuit). 16 

First, an analysis of the frequency response of the conditioning circuit has been carried 17 

out. Figure 9 shows several examples of the raw time-dependent signals of both the surface 18 

elevation  and of the peak-to-peak output voltage Vout measured by the resistive wave gauge 19 

and by the conditioning circuit respectively. The results show that the proposed system is able 20 

to provide not only the maxima bottom shear stresses in the presence of oscillatory flow, but 21 

also its periodic behaviour. Moreover, it should be observed that the sensitivity of the proposed 22 

system increases as wave heights and periods increase. 23 

Figure 10 presents the mean wave periods measured independently by the wave 24 

gauge and by the ferrofluid sensor through the conditioning circuit, namely Twave and Tcirc, 25 

both estimated by averaging the individual wave periods determined by applying a zero-up 26 

crossing method. Figure 10 reports also the error bars of Tcirc, which corresponds to the 27 

standard deviation of each test within the test series. The magnet strengths and the circuit gain 28 

used in the different test series are the ones reported in Table 5. The experimental results 29 

show that the wave period measured by the proposed system is generally consistent with that 30 

of the waves, which means that the frequency response of the measuring system is linear in 31 

the range of investigated frequencies. It may be observed that the system behaves better in the 32 

presence of shallow and intermediate water depth waves, while a larger dispersion of the 33 

experimental data is recovered in the presence of waves closer to the deep water limit. In the 34 

latter case, the interaction between the wave motion and the bottom, where the ferrofluid is 35 



located, is negligible. The results obtained in deep waters prove that the influence of the 1 

changing water level is not significant on the voltage output recovered by the conditioning 2 

circuit. On the other hand this increases the probability of errors in the estimate of oscillations 3 

of the output signal, due to the residual noise of the conditioning circuit. Moreover, it appears 4 

that larger errors in the determination of the wave period occur when a larger gain of the 5 

conditioning circuit is adopted, as in the test series WS004 and WS005 (G=25.0). On the 6 

other hand the increase of the strength of the magnetic field play just a minor role. This is 7 

probably due to the increased level of noise and the amplification of the disturbances obtained 8 

in such a case. Smaller gains guarantee a smaller variability of the measurements (e.g. see test 9 

series WS002 and WS003).  10 

The capability of the proposed ferrofluidic sensor to measure bed shear stresses in the 11 

presence of regular surface wave is analyzed by comparing the maximum bed shear stress 12 

0max to the peak-to-peak output voltage of the inductive transducer Vpp. In particular, Figure 13 

11 shows the relationship between Vpp and 0max for the small and the large value of the 14 

external controlling magnetic force, considering a constant gain equal to G=11.6. Figure 12 15 

reports analogous data with an increased value of the gain, i.e. G=25.0. Finally, keeping 16 

constant the intensity of the external magnetic field, Figure 13 compares the behaviour of the 17 

conditioning circuit with increasing values of the gain.  18 

The analysis of the experimental data reveals that, also in the presence of the waves, a 19 

lower limit of application of the proposed methodology exists, which corresponds to a 20 

threshold of the maximum bed shear stress below which the developed ferrofluid sensor is not 21 

able to react consistently to the action of the flow. In particular, in the investigated wave 22 

conditions, the range of application of the proposed technique is comprised between a lower 23 

limit equal to 0.08 N/m2, which is equal to that recovered in the presence of steady currents, 24 

and an upper limit equal to about 0.4 N/m2, determined by the characteristics of the waves 25 

which was possible to generate in the experimental tank. 26 

Coherently with the results shown in the previous Section, also in the presence of 27 

waves the relationship between the measured peak-to-peak output voltage Vpp and the 28 

maximum wave bed shear stress 0max is linear. In particular, the results in Figure 11 29 

demonstrate that the sensitivity of the developed sensor decreases as the intensity of the 30 

external magnetic field increases. Indeed a stronger magnetic field makes the ferrofluid spike 31 

stiffer, making it less sensible to the action of the flow. Moreover, in the latter case the 32 

repeatability of the measurements is reasonable also in the presence of waves, 33 

notwithstanding the less controllable experimental conditions due to the characteristics of the 34 

larger experimental apparatus, compared to those of the steady current experiments (see 35 

Figure 11 b).  36 



Although a linear trend may generally be recognized, the comparison between 1 

Figures 11, 12 and 13 shows that the increase of the gain of the conditioning circuit generates 2 

a greater dispersion of the measurements. It follows that for the optimal setup of the system, a 3 

gain G=11.6 should be used, at least in the investigated experimental conditions. 4 

Finally, besides a large dispersion, the results in Figure 12a and Figure 13b, which 5 

correspond to the test series WS004( no. 2 magnets S0805, G=25.0) and  WS006 (no. 4 6 

magnets S0805, G=19.5) respectively, are characterized by an almost constant value of  peak-7 

to-peak output voltage over the entire range of investigated bed shear stresses. Indeed, in 8 

these cases the noise induced by the higher gain of the transducer is larger than the inductive 9 

unbalance in the conditioning circuit due to the ferrofluid deformation and displacement, 10 

therefore the readout strategy is not able to measure correctly. 11 

 12 

5 Discussion 13 

The experimental validation of the new ferrofluid sensor coupled to the developed inductive 14 

readout strategy to measure bottom shear stress at the bottom of currents and waves allows to 15 

highlight some of the peculiar features of the proposed methodology. 16 

First of all, the working range of the system is determined. Such a range is a function 17 

of both the configuration of the measuring system, i.e. of the intensity of the controlling 18 

magnetic field, and of the flow characteristics, e.g. steady or oscillatory motion. In particular, 19 

in the investigated conditions it is found that it is reasonable to consider the minimum 20 

measurable value of bottom shear stress equal to about 0.08 N/m2 for both currents and 21 

regular waves. Indeed, below such a threshold, the magnetic field which generates the 22 

Rosensweig effect on the ferrofluid drop is stronger than the action of the flow, thus the 23 

deformation of the ferrofluid drop induced by the latter is too small to be sensed by the 24 

conditioning circuit and transduced into a coherent output voltage. On the other hand, the 25 

upper limit of the working range of the measurement system is different in the case of 26 

currents and waves. In the first case, the upper limit is equal to 0.2 N/m2, while it is doubled 27 

to a value of about 0.4 N/m2 in the second case. It should be observed that the latter value is 28 

determined as a mere consequence of the characteristics of the highest/longest waves 29 

generated experimentally within the wave tank. Indeed, in this case the ferrofluid drop is 30 

always kept at the measuring point and it is not washed away with the flow, therefore the 31 

above threshold could be, in principle, even larger. 32 

Such a difference should be indeed expected, as a consequence of the oscillatory 33 

nature of the wave motion. In fact, in the steady flow case an average bed shear stress is 34 

measured, but due to the turbulence the instantaneous values of the bottom shear stress could 35 



be much higher than the mentioned average threshold. Instead, under the oscillating wave 1 

motion the maximum flow action on the ferrofluid spike, which corresponds to the estimated 2 

value of 0max, is exerted only for few instants during the wave cycle, namely during the crest 3 

and trough phase. It follows that the ferrofluid sensor can be controlled at the measuring 4 

station even in the presence of relatively more intense flow conditions, before being carried 5 

away. 6 

Another important element for the setup of the proposed measuring system is related 7 

to the amplification of the output voltage signal, which can be obtained by changing the value 8 

of the gain. Indeed, in the presence of steady flow larger gains can be used (here G=277 is 9 

considered in all the steady current tests) without introducing significant noise in the 10 

measurements. The operations in the presence of waves require a more careful setting of the 11 

system and the use of much smaller values to avoid undesired dispersion of the experimental 12 

data. In the present experimental wave conditions, the optimal value is equal to G=11.6. 13 

In the above ranges of application and considering an optimized gain of the 14 

conditioning circuit, the calibration curve of the ferrofluid sensor turns out to be significantly 15 

linear in both steady current and wave conditions. 16 

Finally, it is found that the sensitivity of the measuring system is controlled by the 17 

intensity of the permanent magnetic field used to generate the ferrofluid spike through the 18 

Rosensweig effect. However the system behaves differently, depending on the flow type. 19 

Figure 14 reports the calibration curves of the system obtained in terms of the measured 20 

average output voltage Vout and estimated average current bottom shear stress x0 in the flow 21 

direction, for different values of the permanent magnetic field. The 50% confidence interval is 22 

also plotted. Similar calibration curves of the peak-to-peak output voltage Vpp and of the 23 

maximum wave bed shear stress 0max and confidence intervals are presented in Figure 15 for 24 

the wave case. Moreover, for both flow types, Table 6 summarizes the calibration parameters 25 

and the errors, in terms of the slope S of the linear calibration curve and of the minimum and 26 

maximum standard deviation sd of the predictions with respect to such a calibration curve. It is 27 

worth pointing out that a smaller value of S corresponds to a larger sensitivity of the measuring 28 

system. 29 

In steady current conditions, only a minor reduction of sensitivity is registered as the 30 

intensity of the magnetic field increases. However larger difference appears when considering 31 

the errors of the measurements. Indeed, the values of the standard deviation decrease as the 32 

intensity of the magnetic field increases. In particular, considering the present experimental 33 

campaign, when the magnetic field is weaker, some errors larger than one standard deviation 34 

are recovered in the dataset, while the use of stronger magnetic field guarantees errors equal 35 

to about 0.1sd . It turns out that if the intensity of the retaining force is properly selected 36 



compared to the flow conditions, the width of the confidence interval may be significantly 1 

reduced, up to a factor of three in the case being (e.g. compare Figures 14a and 14b to Figure 2 

14c). 3 

In the presence of regular waves, the sensitivity of the proposed measuring system 4 

changes significantly compared to the steady flow case, with values of S equal to 2 or 3 times 5 

those observed in the latter condition. Again the measurement sensitivity was increased by 6 

decreasing the strength of the magnetic field. However, as opposite to the current case, the 7 

measurement errors are smaller if the magnetic field is smaller. Indeed, under the oscillating 8 

motion the ferrofluid spike must move continuously back and forth under the action of a 9 

varying flow, between 0max and–0max in half of a wave period. If the controlling magnetic 10 

field is too strong it may contrasts such a smooth movement, by producing larger standard 11 

deviation values and a larger dispersion of data (see Figure 15b). 12 

Finally some considerations should be made about the use of the system in the 13 

presence of sediments. As mentioned in Section 3.2, during the tests performed within the 14 

wave tank, the measuring apparatus is buried within the sand. In particular, two types of 15 

sediments are used, a medium-coarse quartz sand (d50=0.56 mm) and a medium fine (d50=0.24 16 

mm) quartz sand. According to Soulsby (1997), the value of the critical bed stress for the 17 

incipient motion of the sediment is about 0.27 N/m2 and 0.17 N/m2, since the critical Shields 18 

parameter c is about 0.046 and 0.030 respectively. It follows that, at least in the case of the 19 

finer sand, there should be a weak bed load during part of the wave cycle, with sand particles 20 

impacting on the ferrofluid drop. Since the experimental data are not significantly affected by 21 

such impacts (see, for example, Figure 11), the experimental campaign carried out in the 22 

presence of sediments confirms that the proposed measurement methodology is robust enough 23 

to be used in the presence of a weak bedload transport without costly damages to the sensor. 24 

 25 

6 Conclusions 26 

In the present work the development of a system for measuring bottom shear stresses 27 

generated by waves and currents based on the use of ferrofluids is presented. 28 

The Rosensweig effect is used to generate a single peak of ferrofluid right at the 29 

bottom, whose dimensions are O(1 mm) and which acts as a sensor of the bottom shear 30 

stresses, being deformed and misplaced by the action of the flow. 31 

An inductive readout strategy is used to sense the movement of the center of mass of 32 

the ferrofluid spike as a modification of the inductance produced by two planar coils. Such 33 

coils are photoligraphically engraved onto a printed circuit board, located at the bottom and 34 



controlled by a conditioning circuit, whose direct current output voltage can be used as a 1 

measure of the bottom shear stress.  2 

The sensing element is relatively small O(1mm) and can provide measurements very 3 

close to the wall. Thanks to the dimensions of the ferrofluidic sensing element and to the 4 

robustness of the electro-magnetic transducer, the proposed technique is complementary to 5 

state-of-the-art instruments, such as hot-film and MEMS, since it overcomes some of their 6 

limits, mainly related to the costs and to the fragility of the sensors in the presence of 7 

sediments moving at the bottom. 8 

The proposed measurements methodology has been experimentally tested to obtain 9 

measurements of the bottom shear stress in the presence of both steady currents and surface 10 

regular waves. In the latter case, the measuring system is located over a sandy bottom 11 

characterized in dynamic conditions by a weak bedload transport. 12 

In all the investigated flow conditions the behaviour of the proposed ferrofluid sensor 13 

to measure bottom shear stresses is reasonably linear, while the sensitivity of the measuring 14 

system and the related errors are function of the external magnetic field used to generate the 15 

Rosensweig effect and to control the ferrofluid spike at the measuring station. Indeed, by 16 

increasing the strength of the magnetic field also the stiffness of the ferrofluid spikes 17 

increases. This may lead to relatively large scatter of the data, if the strength of the magnetic 18 

field is not large enough. 19 

Moreover, also the range of measured velocities is a function of such a parameter. 20 

Indeed, the smallest measurable value of bottom shear stress is about 0.08 N/m2 in all 21 

analyzed conditions, while the largest measurable value is different in the presence of currents 22 

or waves. In the first case, a maximum value of about 0.2 N/m2 can be measured, before the 23 

ferrofluid drop is dragged away. In the presence of the oscillating motion, larger values of 24 

measured velocity and bottom shear stresses can be reached. This is due to the fact that in the 25 

present tests only laminar/transitional oscillatory flow conditions have been generated. 26 

Therefore the maximum value of such variable is achieved only for few instants during the 27 

wave cycle. 28 

A limitation of the technique is related to the fact that only information on the mean 29 

flow can be obtained, due to the relatively large frequency response of the ferrofluid sensor 30 

O(5Hz) compared to that of turbulent velocities. 31 

Furthermore, in the present work, the calibration of the system relies on the measured 32 

or theoretical knowledge of the velocity profile. A direct calibration, with no assumptions on 33 

the flow structure is still desirable for a practical application of the proposed methodology. 34 

Therefore, a future work will be to compare measurements obtained using the ferrofluid 35 

sensor with those obtained by state of the art instruments, such as shear plates or hot-films. 36 

Moreover future developments of the proposed technique will be aimed at increasing the 37 



measuring range, which is mainly related to the intensity of the permanent magnetic field. A 1 

possible solution could be to use self-adjusting magnetic strength, by implementing a 2 

measuring closed-loop feedback response. To these aims, the testing of the proposed 3 

methodology in a large scale setup is considered necessary. By taking advantage of the non-4 

invasiveness of the measuring system, other possible developments include the possibility to 5 

obtain measurements in the presence of biologically active beds, such as vegetated bottoms. 6
