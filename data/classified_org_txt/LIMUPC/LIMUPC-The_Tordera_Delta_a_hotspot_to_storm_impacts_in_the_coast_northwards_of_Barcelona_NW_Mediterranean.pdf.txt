The Catalan coast, as most of the developed Mediterranean coastal zone, can be characterized as a high-risk area to the impact of storms due to the large concentration
of values together with the dominance of eroding shorelines. In consequence, any long-term coastal management scheme must include a risk analysis to permit
decision makers to better allocate resources. This can be done in a nested approach in which hotspots are first identified along the coast at a regional scale and
secondly, they are further analysed to produce dedicated risk reduction strategies. In this work, we apply the methodology developed within the RISC-KIT project for
identifying and analysing coastal hotspots in the Catalan coast as a test for applying it to Mediterranean conditions. Obtained results show that this methodology is
very efficient in identifying hotspots of storm-induced flooding and erosion at a regional scale. The adoption of the response approach resulted in the direct assessment
of the hazards' probability distributions, which allowed for the selection of the severity of the hotspots to be identified. When a given coastal stretch behaves as a
hotspot for both hazards, it is identified as a very highly-sensitive area to storm impacts. In the study area, the Tordera Delta possesses this condition of very high
“hotspotness.” This has been demonstrated by the large and frequent damages suffered by the site during the past decades. The paper analyses different aspects related
to the risk management of this area, including stakeholder actions.
1. Introduction

Two of the most important natural hazards causing significant dam-
ages in costal systems worldwide are storm-induced erosion and flooding
(Kron, 2013). The progressive concentration of urban settlements in
coastal zones has increased the exposed values and this, together with the
nearly worldwide erosive trend of our coastlines (Bird, 2000; European
Commission, 2004), has led to an increase in the associated risks, even
under a steady-storm climate e.g., (Zhang et al., 2000; Jim�enez et al.,
2012a). Moreover, it is expected that under a climate change scenario,
these risks will increase in the near future (Hallegatte et al., 2013; Wong
et al., 2014). This current situation and the plausible perspective of
worsening conditions stress the need for including risk management as a
regular chapter in any exercise of long-term coastal planning. In this
sense, the Protocol for Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the
Mediterranean (PAP/RAC, 2007) dedicates a specific chapter to natural
hazards where parties (countries) are advised to undertake vulnerability
and hazard assessments to address the effects of natural disasters in
coastal zones. To this end, there is an increasing number of existing
practical approaches ranging from vulnerability to risk assessments e.g.,
(Ferreira, 2004; Bosom and Jim�enez, 2011; Villatoro et al., 2014; Cirella
et al., 2014; Rangel-Buitrago and Anfuso, 2015). In this line, recently in

the framework of the RISC-KIT research project, a set of tools and ap-
proaches have been developed to support storm-induced risk manage-
ment in coastal areas (van Dongeren et al., 2017).

When this risk management process is going to be implemented for
very large spatial scales, one of the first steps to be done is the identifi-
cation of hotspots. In simple terms, a coastal hotspot can be defined as a
coastal stretch that is more sensitive to a given hazard (and within the
context of this work, an associated risk) than surrounding areas. This is a
screening process that allows for the delimitation of sensitive stretches
along the coast to storm impacts, where a further and -more refined risk
assessment analysis will be implemented at a later time.

Within this context, the main aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to
identify hotspots to the impact of storms along the coast northwards of
Barcelona (NW Mediterranean) by applying the methodology developed
within the RISC-KIT project (Viavattene et al., 2017); and (ii) to analyze
the importance of storm-induced risks in the most highly-sensitive hot-
spot of the area, namely, the Tordera Delta.

The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows: (i) the
second section describes the study area and the data used; (ii) the third
section presents the identification of hotspots at the regional scale along
the Maresme coast; (iii) the fourth section analyses in detail risk assess-
ment and management at the hotspot scale in the Tordera Delta; and

2. Study area and data

2.1. Study area

Maresme is the coastal region of Catalonia (Spain, NW Mediterra-
nean), extending from the city of Barcelona to the south to the Tordera
river to the north (Fig. 1). It is composed by about 45 km of straight,
coarse, sandy beaches that, originally was an uninterrupted coast. Today
it is segmented into five coastal cells due to the presence of five marinas.
The combination of relatively high net longshore sediment transport
rates directed toward the SW, and the presence of these barriers has
induced a typical alternating shoreline evolution pattern, with upcoast
accreting beaches and downcoast eroding ones.

From an administrative standpoint, the coastal fringe extends along
16 municipalities, which are the most densely-populated areas of the
region (IDESCAT, 2014). The region can be divided into two different
areas in terms of socio-economic and territorial dynamics. Southern
municipalities are strongly influenced by the presence of the city of
Barcelona, which has a large, residential development, while the north-
ern ones have largely based their economies on tourism. This area sup-
ports an important transport link composed of a coastal railway and a
national road. The coastal railway is located very close to the shoreline,
and in many sections is only separated from the sea by a revetment
protecting the infrastructure against direct wave impact. The large urban
and infrastructure development in the coastal fringe makes this region
particularly vulnerable to extreme marine events, having experienced
significant damage during the past decades (Jim�enez et al., 2012a).

The northern end of the study area is formed by the Tordera Delta
coast (Fig. 1). This is a highly dynamic zone, currently in retreat due to
the net result of the littoral drift and the decrease of the Tordera River
sediment supplies. As a result of this, beaches surrounding the river

mouth, traditionally stable or accreting ones, are being significantly
eroded during the last 20 years, with a measured shoreline retreat of
about 120 m at the point of maximum erosion (Jim�enez et al., 2011,
2016). The hinterland of this area is composed by the deltaic plain, which
is occupied in its outer part by different campsites which are solely
protected from wave action by existing beaches, with the exception of a
few spots where small revetments exist.

2.2. Data

The topography of the study area has been characterized by using a
2 m� 2 m Digital Elevation Model obtained from Lidar flights performed
between 2008 and 2011 by the Cartographic and Geologic Institute of
Catalonia. Sediment sizes along the coast have been obtained from data
supplied by (CIIRC, 2010).

Wave and water level data have been obtained from the extended
SIMAR dataset obtained by Puertos del Estado (Spanish Ministry of
Public Works) for the Spanish coast. This dataset originally consisted of a
44-year (1958–2001) time series of wave and water level data obtained
within the Hipocas project (Guedes-Soares et al., 2002; Ratsimandresy
et al., 2008), which has been extended until 2016. Waves were generated
by using the third-generation wave model WAM forced by wind fields,
whereas sea level data were obtained by means of the baroclinic HAM-
SOM model. This database has been widely used (Bosom and Jim�enez,
2011; Gomis et al., 2008; Alvarez-Ellacuria et al., 2009; Casas-Prat and
Sierra, 2010) and has been extensively validated in the Mediterranean
(Ratsimandresy et al., 2008; Sotillo et al., 2005; Musi�c and Nickovi�c,
2008). Although some extreme events are underestimated, we have used
the time series without further calibration. A similar approach was also
used by (Casas-Prat and Sierra, 2010) in analysing storminess along the
Catalan coast.

To characterize existing land uses in the coastal zone we have used
the last version of the land-use map of Catalonia developed by CREAF for
the Government of Catalonia (Ib�a~nez and Burriel, 2010). Socio-economic

data have been obtained from the official information provided by the
Statistical Institute of Catalonia (IDESCAT, 2014).

3. Regional assessment of hotspots

The first step in the analysis consisted of the identification of coastal
hotspots to the impact of extreme events in the area. It essentially consists
of assessing storm-induced risks, in terms of flooding and erosion hazards
associated to a given probability of occurrence and their potential con-
sequencesalong the coast to identify sectors with higher risks than sur-
rounding areas. This is done by evaluating a risk index along the coast, CI,
which is composed by a hazard, ih, and, an exposure iexp indicator and it is
given by

To this end, the area was segmented in 46 sectors of one km length
along the coast, each one being defined in terms of a representative beach
profile which has been selected by taking the most sensitive one to
analysed hazards. Hazards are characterized in each sector by using the
response approach, which requires computing hazard time series from
initial forcing data to directly obtain hazard–probability distributions
(see Fig. 2 in (Viavattene et al., 2017)).

The magnitude of the flooding hazard was assessed by estimating the
water level extreme climate along the coast and the extension of the area
to be flooded. Storm surges in the area are relatively small (maximum
recorded values up to 0.5 m) and thus, wave-induced runup, Ru, becomes
the main contributor to water levels during storms (Mendoza and
Jim�enez, 2008), and they were calculated by applying the Stockdon et al.
(2006). model in each sector along the coast. In the southern part of the
study area, there are some stretches where the beach is fully eroded and
the coastline is formed by a riprap revetment. In these areas, Ru has been
calculated using the EuroTop model (Pullen et al., 2007). Resulting Ru
time series calculated for each beach profile (defined in terms of its slope)
were fitted bymeans of a General Pareto Distribution (GPD). Obtained Ru
probability distributions for representative beach slopes of the study area
are shown in Fig. 2, together with the representative regional regime,
which has been obtained by averaging Ru climates obtained in each one
km section.

The extension of the area to be potentially flooded along the coast was
calculated using the bathtub approach. Due to the characteristics of the
study area, with beach profiles characterized by a monotonous increasing
elevation in the landward direction, this approach is a good representa-
tion of the maximum area to be (temporarily) potentially affected by
inundation. The point where the storm-water level intersects the beach
was individually calculated for each profile, taking into account the
3

corresponding water level for selected return periods, Tr, and the local
beach topography. Computed values were converted to a flooding hazard
scale, which was derived by taking into account the local characteristics
of the process. These values range from zero (potentially flooded area
restricted to the beach) to five (a large area at the hinterland will be
affected) (Viavattene et al., 2017).

The magnitude of storm-induced erosion hazard was assessed by
estimating the eroded volume from the inner part of the beach and the
corresponding shoreline retreat during the impact of the storm in each
sector along the coast. This was done by applying the parametric erosion
model proposed by (Mendoza and Jim�enez, 2006) which predicts the
storm-induced beach profile erosion as a function of storm (wave height,
wave period and storm duration) and profile (slope and sediment grain
size) characteristics. Since storms need to be defined in order to compute
the associated erosion during each event, a threshold criteria given by
Hs ¼ 2.5 m and minimum duration of 6 h was used. This threshold was
selected based on previous works on the storm climate in the area
(Mendoza and Jim�enez, 2008; Mendoza et al., 2011) and adapted to the
objective of this work. These authors used a threshold of 2 m and 6 h,
which has been increased to just retain the most significant storms per
year (about 3 storms per year) which will be the most hazardous for
the coast.

Similarly than for flooding, in order to compute the extreme beach
erosion climate, and resulting eroded-volume, time series calculated for
each sector were fitted by means of a GPD. Fig. 2 shows the calculated
shoreline retreat values associated with different return periods for
representative beach profiles of the study area.

Once the probability distributions of storm-induced hazards assessed
along the coast, the next step is to derive the value of corresponding
hazard indicators, ih. This is done by selecting the hazard magnitude
associated to the target probability of the analysis and, ranging them
from 0 to 5 according to the scale showed in Table 1.

In order to assess the “consequences” component of the risk, exposed
values susceptible to the effects of storm-induced hazards were charac-
terized, following the methodology outlined in (Viavattene et al., 2017).
To do this, an exposure indicator (iexp) which integrates five types of
receptors was used: land use (iexp-LU); population (iexp-SV); transport sys-
tems (iexp-TS); critical infrastructures (iexp-UT); and business settings
(iexp-BS). It is given by

iexp-LU measures the importance of the different types of land uses
susceptible to be affected. iexp-SV indicates the intangible impacts to the
affected population in terms of their socio-economic characteristics by
adapting the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) suggested by (Tapsell et al.,
2002). iexp-TS and iexp-UT indicate the existence and importance of a
transport network and critical infrastructures respectively. iexp-BS mea-
sures the potential impact on business. Since, tourism is the most

representative coastal economic sector involved, we have used the tourist
index developed by la Caixa bank (Caixa, 2013). This indicator measures
the relative importance of the tourist sector at municipal level based on
the tax rate (Business Activities Tax), and it takes into account local
characteristics of tourism establishments (category, number of rooms and
annual occupancy). Exposure indicator is calculated and ranked from 1 to
5 following the scale shown in Table 2 for each sector along the coast.
The exposure will vary depending on the hazard extent, which will
depend on the hazard type (flooding or erosion), which is calculated
independently. In the case of flooding, it is computed for a 100 m-wide
buffer landwards from the beach, whereas for the case of erosion, it is
computed considering only a 25 m buffer behind the beach.

Fig. 3 shows the computed values for each component of the exposure
indicator, as well as for iexp, for flooding along the Maresme coast. With
these values, this coastal stretch can be classified as having medium
values at exposure, with a more or less homogeneous distribution along
the coast with the exception of transport and business. The southern part

has important transport elements subjected to exposure and low-business
importance (tourism), whereas the northern part has high-business
values and few transport elements subjected to exposure.

As mentioned before, hazard and exposure indicators are integrated
into a Coastal Index for each analysed hazard.

This index can be calculated associated with any probability of
occurrence since hazards have been characterized in probabilistic terms
(Fig. 2). The selection of the probability to be used to find hotspots is a
choice of the decision-maker and depends on the safety level to be used in
the analysis. As an example, here we use the probability of occurrence
given by a Tr of 100 years, which is the value used in the EU Flood

Fig. 4 shows the spatial distribution of flooding and erosion coastal risk
indexes obtained for a Tr of 100 years along the Maresme coast.

With respect to flooding, the area can be classified as a low-medium
risk due to the relatively short extension of inundation reaches, with the
exception of two areas. The first exception is the Tordera Delta, at the
north, which is composed of relatively narrow and steep beaches pro-
tecting a low-lying area. In terms of values at exposure, beaches in this
area are used for recreational purposes, being important in economic
terms (local scale), supporting various campsites, which are the basis for
local tourism. This area has been experiencing systematic storm-induced
e coast during the impact of a storm on March 2003.

problems since the end of 90's, which have been aggravated in recent
years due to the significant deltaic front retreat and the consequent in-
crease in the level of exposure of the hinterland (Jim�enez et al., 2011,
2016). The second exception represented by two spots to the south,
which are located downcoast to the Balis andMatar�o harbours, where the
beach has been fully eroded in such a way that currently, the coastal
fringe is composed by a riprap revetment protecting the coastal railway
from wave action. During the impact of moderate and extreme storms,
wave-induced runup can exceed the height of the revetment, producing
overtopping and, as a consequence, affecting the railway traffic. This has

been observed several times during the last decades along this coastal
stretch (see Fig. 5).

With respect to erosion, the obtained coastal risk index reflects the
spatial distribution of hazard intensities but is modulated by the spatial
distribution of values at exposures, and specifically, by the level of pro-
tection of the hinterland (the coastal railway and the revetment pro-
tecting it). In comparison with flooding, the area presents lower risk
values due to both lower hazard intensities and values at exposure. In
general, the area can be classified as low to medium risk with the
exception of two spots: one to the north, which coincides with the one

previously identified in the inundation analysis, namely, the Tordera
Delta beaches; and one to the south, located between the Premia de Mar
and Masnou municipalities. Although beaches upcoast existing marinas
are wide, the rest of the coast presents relatively narrow beaches, which
can be fully and instantaneously eroded by the impact of storms. It has to
be mentioned that the southern hotspot identified in the inundation
analysis has not been identified for erosion because the coast was
composed of a revetment where no erosion is possible.

4. Storm-induced risks at the Tordera Delta coast

Among all the identified sensitive areas along the Maresme coast, the
Tordera Delta is one of the most significant hotspots for both storm-
induced hazards, flooding, and erosion. This is a simple cuspate deltaic
sandy shoreline where the northern part is composed by a straight beach
(s’Abanell) with an orientation of 20� with respect to the East whereas
the southern part is orientated from 55� to 70� with respect to the East
(Fig. 6). The combination of this configuration and location determines
the coastline to be directly exposed to the action of the most energetic
storm waves in the area (E-NE storms) as well as to those coming from
secondary directions (S) (see details on storms characteristics in the study
area in (Mendoza et al., 2011).

To analyze in detail the sensitivity of this hotspot, we have used the
XBeach model (Roelvink et al., 2009) to simulate storm-induced erosion
Fig. 9. Simulation of coastal flooding in the Tordera delta using XBeach under the impac

and flooding hazards. First, the model was calibrated using Lidar mea-
surements of the beach before and after the impact of an extreme storm
(Tr ~ 100 years), the St. Esteve storm, on the 26th December 2008
(Jim�enez et al., 2012b; S�anchez-Vidal et al., 2012; Plana Casado, 2013).
Pre-storm and post-storm Lidar data were acquired on 16th October 2008
and 17th January 2009 respectively by the Institut Cartogr�afic de Cata-
lunya and they have an average vertical error of 8 cm (see also (Dur�an
et al., 2016)). To select model parameters during the calibration we used
the Brier Skill Score (BSS) to assess the model skill by comparing it to the
real post-storm LIDAR measurements of the emerged profile. Final cali-
brated model resulted in a BSS score of 0.651 which according to
(Sutherland et al., 2004) can be considered as a very good morphody-
namic model performance. Fig. 7 shows some simulated vs measured
beach profiles at both sides of the river mouth obtained during the
calibration process.

After that, the model was used to simulate storm-induced hazards for
a set of storms covering the full range of potential storm conditions in the
area in terms of wave height, direction, and storm duration. This
permitted the assessment of the expected magnitude of storm-induced
hazards for any condition, and thus, to assess their possible implica-
tions in terms of damages induced in the hinterland.

It is out of the scope of this paper to present the details of the per-
formed numerical analysis. However, to illustrate obtained results, Fig. 8
shows the simulation of the morphodynamic response of the area to the
impact of the previously-mentioned extreme storm of December 2008.
This was an ENE storm reaching a Hs of about 4.7 m just in front the
Tordera Delta (Jim�enez et al., 2012b). As it can be seen in Fig. 8, the
response of the area was different at both sides of the river. The northern
beach was directly exposed to wave action, and it suffers a generalized
typical storm-induced erosion with significant sediment volumes eroded
from the emerged beach and deposited in the submerged beach due to
cross-shore transport. The volume of sediment eroded from this northern
beach was estimated to be about 88,000 m3 with a beach-averaged
erosion of 37 m3/m reaching a maximum of about 100 m3/m (Jim�enez
et al., 2014). The area closest to the river mouth, due to its lower
elevation, was also overwashed during the storm, resulting in some
onshore sediment deposition, a fact that was also well reproduced in the
model (see Fig. 8). These volume changes resulted in a beach-averaged
shoreline retreat of 11 m, with a maximum value of about 25 m
(Jim�enez et al., 2014).

On the other hand, due to its orientation, the southern beach was
partially sheltered from wave action during the storm. This, together the
presence of a submerged longshore bar running parallel to the beach
from the river mouth to the south, resulted in a different behaviour. Thus,
for the southern beach, the storm-induced erosion was smaller, with a
t of an extreme storm (TR > 100 years) coming from E (left) and S (right) directions.



Fig. 10. Example of damages induced in Tordera delta beaches during the impact of
different storm events in the last decade (see locations in Fig. 6).

J.A. Jim�enez et al. Coastal Engineering xxx (2017) 1–11
beach-averaged erosion of about 17 m3/m and maximum shoreline re-
treats of about 10 m. However, due to its lower elevation, this beach
suffered a larger overwash, with sediment accumulations in the back of
the beach up to 10 m3/m (Jim�enez et al., 2014). This spatial variation in
the response to storm impacts was well reproduced by the model (Fig. 8).

This spatial variation in hazard magnitude at both sides of the river
mouth is also detected in storm-induced flooding. As an example of the
analysed potential variations, Fig. 9 shows XBeach simulations of storm-
induced flooding under the impact of an extreme storm (Tr > 100 years)
with different directions (E and S). As can be seen, whereas the flood-
prone area northwards of the river mouth has a similar extension for
both storms, the affected area in the southern beach is very sensitive to
incident wave direction. Under the impact of an E storm, the extension of
the flood prone area, although large, is smaller than under the S storm,
due to the orientation of the coastline. Under the impact of an S storm,
the potential extension of the flood prone area significantly increases,
because on the one hand, waves impact nearly perpendicular to the coast
and, on the other hand, the existing submerged longshore bar is not very
efficient in protecting the area.

These results stress the sensitivity of the southern part of the delta to
wave direction during storms. However, it has to be considered that wave
heights during S storms are usually smaller than during E storms (Men-
doza et al., 2011). In spite of this, this analysis permits the identification
of potential changes in storm-induced flood risk under a scenario of wave
climate variations see, e.g., (Casas-Prat and Sierra, 2013).

The hinterland of this area has been occupied by campsites for over
40 years, which were originally protected from wave action by relatively
wide beaches (from 60 m to 100 m, depending on the location). How-
ever, as was previously mentioned, beaches along the deltaic front on
both sides of the river have been retreating during the last 20 years
(Jim�enez et al., 2011, 2016). This has resulted in an increasing exposure
of values in the hinterland to storm impacts, which has become an
alarming situation due to the current high frequency of damages
(Jim�enez et al., 2011, 2012a). Moreover, due to the decrease in protec-
tion provided by beaches, these situations are beginning to occur under
the impact of relatively moderate storms, which reinforce their “hot-
spotness” to storm-induced hazards. Fig. 10 shows an example of dam-
ages experienced by the area due to storm impacts during the last decade,
which include beach promenade collapses at the north, campsite in-
frastructures damages at both sides of the river, as well as flooding of
various campsites with associated damages in their installations.

Until now, disaster reduction measures have seldomly been imple-
mented in the area by the responsible Administrations and, when done,
they have been met with limited success. As an example, a 180,000 m3

nourishment was done by the Catalan Water Agency in the northern
beach to protect a pumping station of a desalination plant that was
directly exposed to wave action (Fig. 10b) due to a massive shoreline
retreat. However, the lifetime of the works was only 1.5 months, since
they were fully eroded after the impact of a moderate storm (Jim�enez
et al., 2011). Under this situation of increasing damages and the
perception of being abandoned by the Administration, local private
stakeholders have taken action under their own initiative to cope (or to
try to) with coastal disasters (Fig. 11). It should be stressed that these
actions are illegal, and they have usually been undertaken without any
integrated perspective, in such a way that, some of the implemented
measures have affected adjacent neighbours by inducing new problems.
The clearest example of these new induced problems is observed
downcoast of a revetment that was built to locally protect a building at
Les Nacions campsite (point 11 c in Fig. 6). Once the beach in front of the
revetment was fully eroded, the revetment started to affect littoral dy-
namics and produced the typical flanking effect downcoast accelerating
erosion in front of the neighbouring campsite.

In order to test the performance of different risk management stra-
tegies, we analysed the behaviour of the system by simulating the same
set of storms used to characterize current conditions by including
different measures in the southern beach (Malgrat de Mar). The first one
8

was designed to reduce the magnitude of the hazard by increasing the
protection provided by the beach. This was done by means of moderate
beach nourishment to only increase the beach width 40 m along 600 m of
the coastline and, by building a þ4 m-high artificial dune at the back of
the beach. Obtained results showed that the protection strategy was
effective in reducing storm-induced risks, although it behaves as a very
ephemeral measure due to erosion of the fill during the impact of the
storm. This implies that after each storm season, the beach has to be re-
nourished in order to maintain its protective capacity against storms. The

effectiveness of this strategy was also tested in the field by analysing the
behaviour of a 114,000 m3 nourishment done to increase the width of a
southern beach (Malgrat de Mar) in July 2015. The hinterland remained
protected during the impact of two moderate storms (Hs ¼ 3.5 m) in
October 2015, although the fill was fully eroded (Jim�enez et al., 2016). It
has to be mentioned that most of the sediment eroded during the impact
of dominant E storms are removed from the site and alongshore trans-
ported towards the south. The most efficient conditions to promote local
beach recovery correspond to the action of S waves which bring sediment
to the area, which are the least frequent ones.

The second strategy consists of reducing the damages by managed
realignment, which implies the redefinition of the public domain limit
and the removal of all values at exposure between the new limit and the
shoreline. To this end, we tested the effects of imposing three different
setbacks: 25 m, 50 m, and 75 m. As expected, this strategy was also
effective in reducing risks, with larger reductions for larger retreats (see
(Sano et al., 2011) for discussion on setbacks and coastal erosion). As in
9

the previous case, if additional action is not taken, this will also be an
ephemeral strategy due to the existing background erosion, although at a
longer timescale.

Finally, we consulted risk management strategies in the area with
local stakeholders in a Multi-Criteria Analysis as described in (Barquet
and Cumiskey, 2017). Strategies were scored taking into account three
different criteria, i.e. feasibility, acceptability and sustainability, where
corresponding weights were agreed by stakeholders (3/8, 1/8 and 4/8
respectively). Obtained results showed that the most valued strategy was
the one based on beach nourishment and the artificial dune. This was
essentially due to the fact that, in addition to solving the problem, it
permits the maintenance of the economic activity (campsites) as they are
at present and, also provides a beach for sustaining coastal tourism. With
respect to its ephemeral behaviour, stakeholders consider that eroded
volumes will positively contribute to the sediment budget of the neigh-
bouring area, acting as a sediment input. Of course, the acceptance of this
strategy is assuming that re-nourishment is granted when necessary.



J.A. Jim�enez et al. Coastal Engineering xxx (2017) 1–11
On the other hand, setback redefinition was very negatively consid-
ered, with rejection increasing the greater the retreat was. Private
stakeholders argue that they have already retreated to accommodate to
background erosion, and that under this strategy, they bear the brunt of
the costs. Moreover, they state that if no further action is taken, new
retreats will be required in the near future. In summary, from the
perspective of the private stakeholder, this is not a solution. In any case,
the selection of any risk management strategy must be integrated in a
general beach management framework, such as the ecosystem-based one
proposed by (Sard�a et al., 2015).

5. Summary and conclusions

In this paper we have tested the methodology developed within the
RISC-KIT project for identifying and analysing coastal hotspots to the
impact of storms in the Catalan coast. Analysed conditions can be
considered as characteristic of the Mediterranean coastline where the
influence of waves usually dominates over surges, and where the erosion
hazard is, at least, as important as flooding.

Obtained results show that, at a regional scale (several tens of km),
the employed methodology has been very efficient in separately identi-
fying hotspots to storm-induced flooding and erosion. The use of the
response approach resulted in the direct assessment of the hazards'
probability distributions, which permitted the selection of the severity of
the hotspots to be identified. This selection will be made by decision-
makers as a function of the safety level of the analysis and, in this
work, we have used the probability of occurrence associated with
Tr ¼ 100 years.

The obtained spatial distribution of hazards shows that, although they
are related, they are not necessarily coincident. This is due to the
different dependence of hazards' magnitude on storm variables and, on
the different variables determining the resilient capacity of the coast, i.e.,
beach width and height. In spite of this, there are few locations behaving
as hotspots simultaneously for both hazards, and when present, they
become very highly sensitive stretches to storm impacts. In the study
area, this condition of very high “hotspotness” is the Tordera Delta.

The spatial distribution of risks along the coast will depend on the
hazard distribution but modulated by their potential consequences. In
this sense, the adopted approach in which these consequences are
hypothesised by means of indicating values at exposure, implies to
assume a kind of worst-case scenario, i.e., potential damage does not
depend on values' vulnerability. In areas as the analysed one, where
many of the exposed values present a more or less homogeneous dis-
tribution along the coast, local variations can determine a significant
relative increase in the assessed risk. This is important because it will
permit an improved discrimination of sensitive coastal stretches. In the
study area, existing values at exposure in the identified Tordera Delta
hotspot, have been significantly affected during the past decades, with
most of the damages affecting campsite installations (tourist use).

When the analysis is done at the hotspot scale (few kms), the
adopted approach in which storm-induced processes are simulated in
detail for the full range of storm conditions permit the testing of the
associated risk under any risk reduction strategy. In our case, this small-
scale approach has been used to test the efficiency of two typical stra-
tegies based on protection and retreat. In both cases, they efficiently
cope with storm-induced damages, but both are temporary solutions.
This is due to the medium-term coastal behaviour in the area, where
existing erosion rates determine a continuous shoreline retreat. Thus,
any beach nourishment-based solution needs to consider an adequate
re-nourishment scheme to compensate such erosion. Otherwise, the
capacity to protect the hinterland will progressively decrease until its
total disappearance in a relative short period. Similarly, to design a long
lasting retreat-based solution, the setback definition must consider not
only the storm-induced erosion but the background shoreline retreat to
avoid the need of further retreat in a relatively short period. The
absence or the non-application of a storm-induced risk analysis (from
10
identification, quantification, and proposal of solutions) in the study
area has led to non-regulated operations by private stakeholders to
protect their assets. Of course, they have not solved existing problems
and, even worse, they have been aggravated in some locations. These
experiences highlight the need to include these types of risk manage-
ment frameworks in coastal planning, as well as to promote a partici-
patory process that involves the affected stakeholders.
