1. Introduction 

 

Cruise tourism is currently the segment of the international tourism market that has 

grown most strongly worldwide (Brida & Zapata, 2009; Sun et al., 2014; Polat, 2015). 

Despite the global economic crisis in 2008, cruise tourism has experienced significant 

growth, reaching a total of 24.2 million passengers in 2016. According to CLIA (2017), 

this number is expected to reach 25.3 million passengers in 2017. This growth in cruise 

tourism has been reflected not only by passenger volume but also by the number of 

calls, the number of new destinations and the size of cruise ships (London & Lohmann, 

2014). From 2009 to 2013, cruise capacity increased by 18% (CLIA, 2015). 

Furthermore, in the coming years (2017-2026), the leading cruise lines are planning to 

build up to 17 vessels with capacities of more than 5,000 passengers (Cruise Industry 

News, 2017). Thus, the trend towards giant cruises is expected to continue.  

 

The increasing number of passengers entails a set of economic, environmental and 

socio-cultural impacts for the cities and ports that attract these cruises (Brida et al., 

2010).  

 

Many studies have investigated the economic impacts of cruises in various ports around 

the world: Australia (Dwyer & Forsyth, 1996), France (Torbianelli, 2012), Malta 

(McCArthy, 2003), Greece (Lekakou et al., 2011), the Caribbean (Brida et al., 2012), 

Jamaica (Kerswill, 2013), Spain (AQR-Lab, 2015) and globally (Pallis, 2015).  

 

In terms of environmental impacts, although maritime transportation is considered the 

most cost-effective mode of transport compared to road, rail or air (Butt, 2007), cruise 

ships produce serious adverse effects on the marine environment and human health that 

cannot be neglected (Poplawski et al., 2011; Maragkogianni & Papaefthimiou, 2015). 

The main environmental impacts are the emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere 

and the generation of waste. A typical cruise can generate between 2.5 and 4.0 

kg/pax·day of solid waste, 0.16 kg/pax·day of hazardous waste, 40 l/pax·day of black 

water, 340 l/pax·day of grey water and 10 l/pax·day of bilge water (European 

Commission, 2009; Caric, 2015). In addition, a cruise ship emits an average of 33.6 

g/pax·h of NOx, 29.8 g/pax·h of SOx and 3.1 g/pax·h of PM10 (CENIT, 2016). All of 

these pollutants have significant effects, especially considering the growth forecasts for 

this industry. Therefore, further measures are needed to mitigate the environmental 

effects of cruises in order to make cruises a more sustainable mode of transport (Klein, 

2002; Butt, 2007). These measures may include legislative restrictions and adopting 

specific procedures for waste management (Commoy et al., 2005; Dragovic et al., 

2015).  

 

The third category of impacts frequently associated with cruise tourism is socio-

cultural. The large daily and, in particular, short-term passenger flows affect the quality 

of life of the local population. The main problems that have been identified are 

overcrowding, the homogenization of the port experience and the need to honestly 

represent cultural and historical sites (Klein, 2011).  

 

Inside a port, the impacts associated with cruise activity are essentially related to 

mobility and are based on providing good service to a high volume of passengers who 

typically arrive en masse all at the same time (Klein, 2011). The port must guarantee 

sufficient operating space at the piers assigned to cruise activity for all of the transport

modes used by passengers (Fogg, 2001). Therefore, a sufficiently wide esplanade is 

required to serve all available transport modes: taxis, public buses, shuttle buses, 

excursion buses and private vehicles (PIANC, 2016). These transportation links should 

not be underestimated, since transportation to and from the port is the cruise passenger’s 

first and last impression of the port (Fogg, 2001) and since the environment is one of the 

most valued factors for cruise passengers (Baker, 2015). It is also essential to have 

roads with enough entry and exit lanes so that passengers can reach their destination 

cities quickly, safely and efficiently. However, in most cases, available space on the pier 

is a scarce resource (McCarthy, 2003) because it is land reclaimed from the sea. 

Therefore, optimizing the free space is very important (Fogg, 2001).  

 

A passenger’s decision to choose one transport mode over another depends on several 

factors, such as whether the port is a homeport or a port of call, the length of stay, 

whether he or she is travelling alone or with family, income level, and age. Many 

studies have been conducted regarding passenger behaviour, focusing on the 

motivations that encourage passengers to take a cruise ship (Andriotis & 

Agiomirgianakis, 2010; Brida et al., 2012; Sanz-Blas et al., 2015). However, none of 

these studies have specifically addressed the passengers’ choice of transportation; 

therefore, this is still a not well understood phenomenon (Ferrante et al., 2016). 

 

The Port of Barcelona, which is a cruise port that had 2.6 million passengers in 2016 

(Port de Barcelona, 2017), is considered one of the largest European turnaround cruise 

ports and the fourth busiest port internationally (European Commission, 2015). At this 

port, the most common transport option is a taxi. Taxis are often used by passengers 

travelling to or from the airport, railway stations or hotel, since they are carrying their 

luggage. Another available transport mode is a public bus, which typically heads to the 

city centre. These buses are chartered by the Port Authority depending on the number of 

cruise ships that day. Despite their low cost, however, public buses are still rarely used. 

On certain cruises, cruise lines operating at the port offer shuttle buses to the city. 

However, due to their high cost compared with other transport modes, the shuttle buses 

are not widely used. The cruise lines and the associated travel agencies also organize 

excursion buses to the main museums and city landmarks. Another travel option is a 

private vehicle, although this option requires long-term parking at the pier. Finally, as 

the cruise terminal is located near the city, passengers can travel on foot (see Fig. 1). 

 

The main mobility problems, queues and waiting times, arise during disembarkation, as 

passengers usually exit at the same time. Disembarkation is therefore a complex process 

that requires tremendous logistical effort (Gibson, 2006) and, in the worst case, can last 

up to 12 hours (Fogg, 2001). In contrast, embarkation is normally a staggered process 

that does not cause mobility problems. Cruise ships typically arrive early in the morning 

(5-10 a.m.) and leave in the afternoon (5-10 p.m.), and only a few ships remain moored 

at the pier for more than one day. There is, however, a tendency to minimize the time at 

port to reduce port taxes and to encourage passengers to spend more on board than in 

the city. The berth allocation problem has been the subject of numerous articles 

addressing how to determine the best positions of ships on the pier in both time and 

space (Cordeau et al., 2005; Wang & Lim, 2007). For cruise ships, this is not an issue 

since the cruise terminals have sufficient berthing capacity. Each terminal hosts a 

maximum of one cruise ship per day, as previously assigned by the Port Authority. 

Therefore, there are no physical limitations that force cruise ships to wait to dock.

Mobility problems associated with disembarkation often worsen when more than two 

cruise ships are disembarking passengers at the same time. Traffic management is 

necessary on days with more than approximately 15,000 passengers, whether they are 

embarking or disembarking (Port de Barcelona, 2014). Ferry operations located on the 

same pier do not interfere with the mobility of cruise passengers, as their schedules do 

not coincide. The ferries arrival between 22:00 and 23:00, when the cruise ships have 

already departed. 

 

The growing importance of the cruise industry is highlighted by its status as one of the 

tourism industry sectors that generate the highest profit, along with lodging and 

restaurants; however, there is a lack of literature studying the impacts of passenger 

mobility (Stynes, 1997). As previously explained, the existing literature has generally 

focused on analysing the economic effects of cruises on the destination, particularly 

examining cruise passenger expenditure and profiles, to objectively assess whether 

cruises are beneficial to the global community economy (Henthorne 2000; Río & Cruz, 

2008; Brida et al., 2010).  

 

This paper uses the terrestrial mobility data of cruise passengers (passenger flows and 

modal distribution), which have not yet been addressed in the literature. Some studies 

have discussed the design of cruise terminals (Fogg, 2001; PIANC, 2016), but they did 

not specifically address passenger mobility. The data obtained in this study can serve as 

the starting point for dimensioning the different spaces in a cruise terminal, which has 

frequently been demanded by the designers of these terminals. 

 

In this context, the aim of this work is to study the impacts of cruise passenger on 

mobility in ports using data from the Port of Barcelona. This research studies the main 

explanatory variables, the flow distribution over time, the modal shift of the passengers 

and the traffic generated by cruise activity. 

 

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In section 2, the empirical data source and 

the methodology are explained. Section 3 discusses the empirical results, and section 4 

is devoted to the concluding remarks. 

 

2. Data and methods 

 

2.1. Data  

 

The data used in this paper came from a mobility study commissioned by the Barcelona 

Port Authority in 2011 (most recent data available) for the cruise pier located at Adossat 

Pier (Fig. 2). The study (Doymo, 2011) consisted of fieldwork that included data 

collected from direct observations of passenger transport mode choice for 9 cruise ships 

using the port. In 2011, there were 881 calls, and 81 of them were from different 

vessels. Cruise ships of differing types, capacities, cruise lines and arrival times were 

chosen to cover most of the representative cases. The representativeness of the sample 

was analysed using the expression given for finite populations of small size, with a 

confidence level of 95% and a standard deviation of p = 0.05. A sampling error of 13% 

was obtained, which is acceptable for this analysis. This fieldwork may have the 

following two limitations: the date the observations were taken and the number of cruise 

ships taken as a sample.

Although all data were recorded in 2011, these data are considered relevant because no 

significant changes have occurred since that time. The port infrastructure has remained 

the same: 4 cruise terminals with the same road access. Since 2011, the volume of 

passengers at the port has varied each year, but in 2016, the number of passengers was 

similar to that in 2011 (2,683,584 passengers). Despite the number of passengers 

remaining stable, the number of calls has decreased because the cruise industry has 

adopted the economies of scale that have been so successful in other naval sectors 

(Kendall, 1972; Papatheodorou, 2006; Tran & Haasis, 2015). As a result, there are 

fewer cruise ships with greater capacities. Thus, the total number of passengers is very 

similar to the one registered in 2011. In addition, the proportion of homeport versus 

transit calls has barely changed, from 56% of homeport calls in 2011 to 58% in 2016. 

 

The number of samples may not be representative because it is assumed that the same 

cruise ship results in the same passenger behaviour, which may not always be the case. 

Depending on the season, the number of passengers and the climatic conditions, 

passenger behaviour could differ. However, these data should be taken as a first 

approach to the problem of terrestrial mobility related to cruise ships. Additional studies 

would be required to extend the results. 

 

The fieldwork was conducted by a team of five people between 13 June and 15 July 

2011. One observer at the exit of the pier counted passenger entries and exits in 10-

minute periods. In addition, four more observers at the exit of the maritime stations and 

at the drop-off and pick-up points of the esplanades counted the total number of 

passengers entering and exiting the terminal in 10-minute periods as well as their 

selected transport mode: taxi, public bus, shuttle bus, excursion bus or private vehicle. 

Some other variables were considered such as the number and occupancy of vehicles, 

queues, efficiency and incidents.  

 

The sampling campaign was performed from the moment that the cruise ship arrived 

until its departure. Data collection took an average of 11.4 hours per cruise. In these 

periods, an average of 3,909 passengers entered the terminal, and 3,903 passengers 

exited the terminal (Table 1). These data are the starting point for the work described in 

this paper. 

 

Direct observation was selected as the data collection method because it is particularly 

suited to understanding an on-going behaviour, process or event (Taylor-Powell & 

Steele, 1996). Additionally, data collection is a reliable and widely used method in the 

existing literature. For instance, Scherrer et al. (2011) observed visitor behaviour during 

guided tours of Kimberley Coast (Australia) to examine the potential environmental 

impacts. Jaakson (2004) observed the space-time behaviour of passengers in 4 cruise 

ships in the Port of Zihuatanejo (Mexico). Other methods can be used to collect 

information, and each has its own advantages and weaknesses. Douglas & Douglas 

(2004) gave questionnaires to cruise passengers on 7 Pacific Island ports of call to 

evaluate their expenditures. Andriotis & Agiomirgianakis, (2010) and Brida et al. 

(2012) used surveys to determine cruise passenger profiles in the ports of Heraklion 

(Crete, Greece) and Cartagena (Colombia) respectively. Finally, De Cantis et al. (2016) 

used a more modern method that consisted of monitoring cruise passenger flow using an 

infrared beam counter and subsequently tracking the passengers using GPS devices.

2.2. Methodology  

 

The cumulative curves of the passenger exit flow for the nine studied cruises were 

plotted. The most relevant variables, such as the periods of maximum demand, 

variability of the peak hour over time and maximum and average exit rates, were 

derived from these curves. To obtain greater detail, these variables were studied over 

shorter periods of time (10 minutes), since the passenger flow fluctuated substantially 

over time. Subsequently, to determine the passenger exit rates for each cruise, the 

curves were adjusted using linear regression with R
2
 > 0.9 (Fig. 4). The curves were 

grouped by cruise operation type to find repeating patterns that could explain passenger 

behaviour in terms of leaving the terminal. In addition, to explain the different exit 

rates, the correlations were analysed using the Pearson correlation coefficient, with the 

help of the commercial software Minitab, taking a moderate correlation to be r > 0.4.  

 

In addition, to quantify the modal distribution of the cruise passengers, the 

disembarkation data were statistically analysed and validated to obtain the relative 

percentages of passenger transport mode choice and the average occupancies of the 

various transport modes.  

 

The ratio of the number of vehicles generated per cruise ship to the number of 

passengers carried by a cruise was calculated and analysed to determine whether there 

was any correlation between this ratio and the cruise operation type.  

 

3. Results 

 

3.1. Cruise passenger flow exiting the terminal in a disembarkation operation 

 

The analysis of the passenger exit flow for the nine studied cruises (Table 2 & Fig. 3) 

shows that disembarkation is a lengthy process that can last between 7 and 12 hours. 

This finding is in agreement with that of Fogg (2001), who established that the 

disembarkation process for a home port falls within 12 hours. The maximum demand 

period, which is defined as the time slot in which the largest number of passengers 

departs, typically begins one hour after the cruise docks at the pier.  

 

The cruise operation (turnaround, transit or interporting) depends on the passenger flow, 

which is in accordance with the results from Di Vaio & D’Amore (2011). In turnaround 

cruises, the period of maximum demand lasts up to four hours, with a peak time 

between the third and fifth hour depending on the cruise. However, in transit cruises, 

this period extends over five hours, peaking at the fourth hour (Table 2). This difference 

occurs because the exit flow of transit passengers is a more staggered and prolonged 

process than the exit flow of turnaround passengers. In turnaround cruises, passengers 

have already booked their return journey by plane or train at a certain time, and 

therefore exit the terminal within a shorter period of time. In addition, in interporting 

cruises, which are a mixture of the previous two cruise operation types (Lekakou et al., 

2009), the maximum demand period is concentrated within approximately two hours. 

Specifically, the peak demand for MSC Fantasia occurred in the second hour, and that 

of MSC Splendida occurred in the first hour. These cruises have a later arrival time and 

more turnaround passengers than transit passengers.

The data suggest that cruise ships arriving at 5 a.m. generally have a four-hour period of 

maximum demand for the disembarkation process that peaks in the fourth or fifth hour. 

For cruise ships arriving at 6 a.m., the period of maximum demand lasts five hours, with 

a peak in the fifth hour. For cruise ships arriving at 7 a.m., the maximum demand period 

varies from two to five hours with a peak in the second, third or fourth hour depending 

on the cruise. In addition, for cruise ships arriving at 9 a.m., the maximum demand 

period only one hour and peaks within that hour. These data show that the later the 

cruise arrives, the sooner passengers begin to disembark and the earlier the peak hour is. 

  

When designing and managing a cruise terminal, the maximum number of users that the 

terminal can serve must be determined (PIANC, 2016). The results of this analysis show 

that, at most, over half of all passengers could disembark in one hour (Table 3). This is 

the case of the interporting cruises, in which an average of 52% of all passengers 

disembarked in one hour. On the other hand, transit cruises disembarked 30% of its total 

passengers in one hour. Turnaround cruises present an intermediate percentage (37%). 

Considering 10-minute intervals, the maximum passenger flow ranges from 18% in 

transit cruises (Grandeur of the seas) to 30% in turnaround cruises (Sovereign of the 

seas). These figures are again in accordance with the previous results. The maximum 

exit flows in turnaround operations are higher than in the transit operations, since the 

turnaround passengers end their journey and many of them have already arranged a 

travel mode to return to their homes. 

 

In most of the cases studied, the flow of passengers exiting the terminal (Fig. 4 & Table 

4) occurs linearly in three different stages. In the first stage, which roughly occurs 

between the first and third hour after the cruise ship arrives, the average exit rate (λ1) is 

13 passengers per minute in turnaround cruises and 9 passengers per minute in transit 

cruises. The second stage, which occurs between three and four and a half hours, is 

when most passengers leave the terminal. During this time, in turnaround cruises the 

exit rate (λ2) doubles compared to that of the first stage, with an average of 27 

passengers per minute. In transit cruises, the pace also increases but slower (15 

passengers per minute). In interporting cruises, the first two stages show an exit rate of 

37 passengers per minute, which is a high rate. In the third stage, which occurs between 

four and a half hours until the last passenger has disembarked, the exit rate (λ3) is very 

low, between 1 and 2 passengers per minute in the three cruise operation types. 

Comparing these results with those of the few other studies that have investigated the 

flow of passengers in different transport modes confirms that passenger disembarkation 

is a linear process. Molyneaux et al. (2014) indicated that the flow of passengers 

disembarking from trains follows a piecewise linear function. In the case of airplanes, 

this process also behaves linearly (Horonjeff, 1969) with an exit rate of between 4 and 

39 passengers per minute (Fricke & Schultz, 2008), which is within the range of our 

results (Table 4). To explain the different exit rates found, a correlation analysis was 

conducted. This analysis (Table 5) confirmed that the passenger exit flow strongly 

depends on the type of operation and the arrival time of the cruise ship. This correlation 

exists only during the first period (λ1), between one and three hours after the cruise ship 

arrives. After this time (in the second and third periods), the passenger exit flow is 

independent of the cruise operation and the arrival time of the cruise ship. 

 

Future demands for high-capacity cruise ships with disembarkations of approximately 

5,000 passengers will not significantly increase the passenger flows from maritime 

stations during peak periods of 10 minutes. When exiting the ship, the passenger must

go through different spaces inside the terminal, such as the gangway, boarding corridor, 

baggage lay down, customs and exit door (PIANC, 2016), which make disembarkation 

a more staggered process over time. However, a good dimensioning of these spaces, 

especially the gangway, which is the most critical element of the terminal, will be 

necessary (Cox & Long, 2004). In addition, the results show that an increase in cruise 

capacity does not necessarily result in an increase in the maximum flows. 

 

3.2. Modal distribution of cruise passengers in a disembarkation operation 

 

The results obtained during the disembarkation operation of the studied nine cruises 

from the fieldwork at Adossat Pier of the Port of Barcelona (Table 6) show that 35% of 

all cruise passengers use a taxi, making it the most commonly used transport mode. 

These results are consistent with those of Hall & Braithwaite (1990) since the Caribbean 

ports in their study are mostly homeports, resulting in high taxi use. In contrast, in the 

Port of Zihuatanejo (Mexico), a port of call between the ports of Miami and Los 

Angeles, few passengers use taxis, and most opt for excursion buses (Jaakson, 2004). 

 

Currently, the Port of Barcelona is considered a homeport because more than half of 

passengers begin or end their journey in this city. If the modal distribution is 

differentiated by type of cruise operation, then the use of taxis in turnaround operations 

increase to an average of 48%. These ports occur at the end of the journey, so 

passengers are carrying their luggage and usually stay in the city overnight. Therefore, 

the passengers find it quicker and easier to take a taxi to their hotels instead of using 

other transport modes as taxis offer a direct route without requiring transfers. In 

addition to taking a taxi, passengers heading for the airport have the option of taking a 

transfer bus (25%), which some cruise lines charter to take passengers straight to the 

airport. For transit cruises, the most frequently used transport mode is the shuttle bus 

(49%). In these cases, passengers stay in the city for a few hours and leave their luggage 

on the cruise ship. Additionally, passengers may have previously booked a shuttle bus 

through a travel agency or on board the ship to take them directly to the area they wish 

to visit. For interporting cruise operation, the most common transport modes are shuttle 

buses (35%) and taxis (25%). This is a logical outcome since this operation is a mixture 

of the previous two modes and includes both passengers who are ending their journey 

and others who are just calling. 

 

Other significant findings include the following:  

 

- The number of passengers choosing excursion or transfer buses is fairly constant 

regardless of the cruise operation (13-25%). In ports of call, such as the port of 

Chios (Greece), the percentage of passengers who opt for excursions is much 

higher (55%) (Lekakou et al., 2011). 

 

- No passengers in the turnaround operation chose shuttle buses, since they are 

ending their journey and heading for hotels, the airport or railway stations. 

 

- For various reasons, few passengers choose public buses (8-15%). The first 

reason is a lack of knowledge; the passengers have not been informed about the 

existence of a public bus that can take them to the city, and the signage for the 

bus stop in insufficient and often not appropriately visible. The second reason is 

finances; although the cost of bus travel is relatively cheap (€3 one way, €4

return), many passengers think that taking a taxi costs less. In reality, taxi rides 

from the Adossat Pier cost €0.98/km with additional charges for the pick-up fee 

(€2.05) and pier entry/exit (€4.20). The Port Authority needs to encourage the 

use of public buses to reduce gas emissions and traffic at the pier. 

 

- The number of passengers travelling in private vehicles is low (1-8%), and these 

are mostly vans from private companies hired by the passengers themselves. The 

pier does not have long-term parking, and the closest parking area is over 1 km 

away. In other ports, especially in America, long-term car parks are one of the 

main sources of income for port authorities. Fogg (2001) estimates that in 

American ports, between 20 and 30% of the cruise passengers use private 

parking. 

 

- A significant number of passengers (5-12%) go into the city on foot, which is a 

key feature of the Port of Barcelona, since the city is located just 1.8 km from 

the cruise pier. Therefore, in ports close to the destination city, the pavement 

must be wide, comfortable and safe. In addition, these designs should consider 

the profiles of cruise passengers: sensitive to long distances and often have 

difficulties walking (up to 10% of cruise passengers) (Jaakson, 2004). 

 

- The use of the various transport modes does not vary greatly with the cruise 

operation. Taxis have an average occupation of 3 passengers (Table 7), but 

despite the need to queue, passengers are increasingly demanding taxis with 

greater capacity (4+ pax). Although public buses do work at full capacity (40 

pax) at certain times, the average number of bus passengers throughout their 

operating hours is only 10. Chartering large excursion and transfer buses often 

costs less for cruise lines, even the buses are not used to full capacity (32.4 pax). 

The average occupancy of private vehicles is over 4 pax as these are often vans 

hired by the passengers and not their own cars. 

 

- The number of passengers who remain on the cruise ship and do not exit during 

a cruise call can be significant (Jaakson, 2004). According to Stefanidaki & 

Lekakou (2014), these passengers do not interact with the local system or 

population. In the case of the studied cruises, 30% of the total passengers stayed 

on the cruise ship. By contrast, in the port of call of Cartagena de Indias 

(Colombia) this percentage decreased to 10% (Brida et al., 2010). 

 

- In terms of the parameters that influence a passenger’s transport mode choice, 

the data show a clear correlation between only the mode choice and the cruise 

operation. Nevertheless, many other factors such as the distance from the port to 

destination attractions, the confidence level against the destination, the safety of 

the destination, and the passenger profile can be considered (De Cantis et al., 

2016). These last parameters were not included in this analysis due to the lack of 

adequate data. As shown in Fig. 5, the number of passengers selecting taxis and 

those using shuttle buses varies greatly depending on the cruise operation type.   

 

The recent arrival of high-capacity cruise ships will require reinforcing the transport 

modes and managing traffic with a greater number of personnel. Special consideration 

should be given to taxis, as this port seeks to become a pure homeport, which mostly 

uses taxis, rather than a port of call. The reason for this desired shift is that homeports

produce a higher economic impact for the city (de la Vina & Ford, 1999; Lekakou et al., 

2009; Brida & Zapata, 2009; Pallis, 2015). The trend towards becoming a homeport has 

been developing in Barcelona since 2011, and in 2016, 58% of cruises were turnaround 

operations (Port of Barcelona, 2017). As a consequence, the cruise terminals at this port 

will require a greater number of taxis, since cruise ships that begin or end at the same 

port (turnaround operations) require more taxis. 

 

3.3. Estimating the traffic generated by a cruise 
 

Estimating the traffic generated by a particular cruise ship is quite difficult since the 

traffic depends on many factors, such as the cruise operation type, arrival time, and 

cruise line, as noted previously. Table 7 presents the empirical data from the fieldwork, 

from which some conclusions can be drawn. 

 

In general, the traffic generated by cruise activity has no direct implications for the city. 

At most, 881 new vehicles are generated, the process can last for up to 12 hours, and 

passengers are heading to multiple destinations (airport, train stations, tourist 

attractions, etc.). 

 

As illustrated in Table 8, turnaround cruises generate more vehicle traffic (15-22%) 

since more passengers use taxis, which have a smaller capacity than buses. However, 

for transit cruises, the percentage of vehicles drops to 7% because more passengers 

choose shuttle buses, which have a greater capacity than taxis. For interporting cruises, 

as taxis and shuttle buses have similar demand, the percentage of vehicles generated 

(10-11%) falls between the two previous cruise operation types. 

 

With the expected future trends of this port becoming a homeport and higher capacity 

cruise ships, traffic is expected to increase even as the overall number of passengers 

remains constant. This result will occur because passengers will travel by taxi more than 

by bus and because taxis have smaller capacity. 

  

 

4. Conclusions 

 

The fundamental contribution of this paper is studying the impact of cruise passengers 

on mobility within a port area, focusing on the Port of Barcelona. Specifically, this 

study analyses and predicts the behaviour of cruise passengers on land, that is, 

understanding how, when and why the flow of passengers occurs, their transport mode 

choice and the vehicles generated by cruise activity.  

 

The results show that the flow of cruise passengers exiting the terminal greatly depends 

on the type of cruise operation and the arrival time of the cruise ship. The data show that 

the later the cruise ship arrives, the sooner passengers disembark, and the less time they 

take to do so.  

 

Looking more closely at passenger exit flow, this process generally occurs linearly in 

three different stages. In the first stage (between one hour and three hours after the 

arrival of the cruise ship), the mean exit rate is 13 and 9 passengers per minute in 

turnaround and transit cruises respectively.

In the second stage (from three to four and a half hours), the mean exit rate is 27 

passengers per minute in turnaround cruises, which is more than twice that in the first 

stage. In transit cruises, the pace is 15 passengers per minute. In the third stage (from 

four and a half hours until the last passenger has disembarked), the mean exit rate 

sharply decreases between 1 to 2 passengers per minute in all cruise operations. These 

results are in agreement with the conclusions of other studies. For example, in the case 

of trains, disembarkation is a piecewise linear function (Molyneaux et al., 2014). In 

airplanes (Horonjeff, 1969), the disembarkation process is linear, with an exit rate 

within the range of our results (Fricke & Schultz, 2008). 

 

The modal distribution analysis shows that, on average, most passengers choose a taxi 

(35%), followed by excursion and transfer buses (22%), shuttle buses (19%), public 

buses (12%) and private vehicles (5%). This distribution is for the particular case of the 

Port of Barcelona, which is considered a homeport. In addition, a passenger’s choice of 

transport mode strongly depends on the cruise operation type. In a turnaround operation, 

most passengers (48%) select a taxi. However, in a transit operation, most select shuttle 

buses (49%). In addition, in an interporting operation, both taxis and shuttles are 

popular transportation modes, since in this type of operation, some passengers are 

beginning or ending their journey while others are just calling. Furthermore, 30% of all 

passengers remain on the cruise ship and do not exit at the Port of Barcelona.  

 

Predicting the road traffic generated by a cruise is very difficult as it depends on many 

variables. Using the percentages of vehicles with respect to the total number of 

passengers, the data shows that in turnaround cruises, the percentage of vehicles is 

between 15% and 22%; in transit cruises, the percentage drops to 7%; and in 

interporting cruises, the percentage is between 10% and 11%. In terms of mobility, this 

new traffic has little impact on the overall city traffic. The cruise traffic is small 

compared with the city traffic and has multiple destinations: airports, railway stations, 

tourist attractions, etc. However, this traffic does affect the internal mobility of the port, 

as the traffic is generated at peak hours and on roads with limited capacity. 

 

The future demands of the port entail receiving cruise ships with greater capacity and 

with turnaround operation. These factors affect port mobility, as the future cruise 

activity will generate a higher volume of traffic that should be better managed. More 

turnaround cruises will require a greater number of taxis, which will generate more 

vehicles on the road and result in queues and long waiting times for passengers. The 

long-term solutions aim to completely change the current taxi management model, as 

taxis are responsible for the main mobility problems. One option is a mass transit 

system, such as a “People Mover” capable of moving a massive number of passengers 

via tramway or light rail (Vickerman & Beatley, 2004). This system has already been 

implemented in the Port of Venice as an air train connecting the maritime terminal with 

the car park (Moretti, 2012). Port Everglades (Florida) is also considering implementing 

this system in its cruise port to alleviate vehicular congestion (Vickerman & Beatley, 

2004). However, this solution requires a substantial infrastructure investment. Another 

proposed suggestion is the creation of a “Mobility Centre”, which is defined as an area 

far away from the cruise pier where passengers are brought by shuttle buses and can 

then take a taxi to their destination without a long waiting time.  

 

The results of this research can be applied by port authorities or private operators for the 

correct dimensioning of a cruise terminal and can thus help to manage port traffic more

efficiently. Considering the lack of research on cruise passenger mobility, this article 

contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying how, when and why mobility 

problems arise, determining which factors determine the passenger flow, and 

quantifying the transport modes and the road traffic generated by cruise activity. In 

addition, this paper considers the future mobility needs of the cruise industry and 

proposes possible solutions. 

 

Due to the limitations of the data used in this study, the results should be considered a 

first approach to the problem of terrestrial mobility related to cruise ships. More 

research is necessary to understand and predict cruise passenger behaviour and to thus 

improve their mobility within a port.
