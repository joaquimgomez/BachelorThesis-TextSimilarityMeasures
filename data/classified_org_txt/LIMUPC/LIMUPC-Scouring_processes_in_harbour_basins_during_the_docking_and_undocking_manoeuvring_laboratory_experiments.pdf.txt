Scouring processes due to manoeuvring actions can produce big consequences on the stability of har-
bour structures such as docks and protecting dikes. As a consequence, the sedimentation of the eroded
sediment reduces the total depth of the harbour basin and navigation channel. At the same time, con-
taminants settled at the bed of the harbour basins may be resuspended by the effect of vessel?s pro-
pellers and produce an important environmental problem to harbour authorities. Present formulas to
compute the total scouring depth have revealed to overestimate the maximum scouring depth or be
non-realistic in other cases. Experiments performed at the Marine Engineering Laboratory in LaBassA
flume (12x4.6x2.5 m3) with a twin propeller reduced model of 0.25 m diameter are presented herein.
Main propeller and bow thruster conditions are evaluated for three different rotating velocities using a
sediment diameter of D50 = 250µm at bollard pull conditions.

1. Introduction

The last release of The World Association for Waterborne
Transport Infrastructure in 2015 was a monographic about scour
caused by ships and the berthing protections, (PIANC, 2015).
However, both the velocity downstream the propellers and the
scouring processes due to vessels manoeuvres have been stud-
ied so far.

Efflux velocity or downstream velocity, is the first parame-
ter needed to analyze the seabed erosion, since all the theoreti-
cal equations developed so far, use this variable as a dependant
variable. Bed velocity, has always been expressed as a function
of efflux velocity and is used, in turn, to obtain the maximum
scouring depth caused by ships propulsion systems. Although
efflux velocity for twin propellers has only been described by
(Schokking et al., 2003; Fuehrer et al., 1981; PIANC, 2015)
proposes to use the expressions for a single propeller with a lin-
ear or quadratic superposition hypothesis. Therefore, the axial

momentum theory can be used, along with (Hamill, 1987; Stew-
art, 1992) or (Hamill et al., 2010) but always bearing in mind
the option decided in order to analyse the variability of the final
results for expected erosion. (Mujal-Colilles et al., 2016b) anal-
yses the results of the equations proposed by (PIANC, 2015),
with twin propellers experimental results with good results for
the bed velocity predicted by the German method using a quadratic
superposition hypothesis.

Other authors outlying local scouring problems can also
be used to estimate the maximum erosion in harbours due to
propellers. Most of the literature is based in experimental ex-
pressions found in laboratories (Mason and Arumugam, 1985;
Chiew and Lim, 2012; Canepa and Hager, 2003; Chiew et al.,
2003; Hong et al., 2012), and can produce non-realistic val-
ues when implemented in real harbours (Mujal-Colilles et al.,
2016b).

The present paper is aiming to describe the experimental re-
sults of scouring processes in a physical laboratory using twin
propellers. In order to reproduce more realistic manoeuvres
two different configurations were used: scour produced by main
propellers and scour produced by bow-thrusters.

2. Experimental setup

Figure 1: Experimental setup in LaBassA (LIM/UPC-BarcelonaTech).
The center of reference is located at the symmetry axis in the bottom
of LaBassA.

Physical experiments were performed at a facility located
in the Laboratory of Marine Engineering (LIM) from Techni-
cal University of Catalonia (UPC-BarcelonaTech). LaBassA,
see Figure 1, is a rectangular concrete tank of 12.5x4.6x2.5m3

with three lateral windows visually access the experiments in
time. A sediment layer with a height hs = 0.55m was located
covering most of LaBassa. The grain size distribution of the
sediment layer was D50 = 250µm and D90 = 375µm. Two
helix, with Dp = 0.25m, were located at the end of LaBassA
with a clearance distance from the bottom of hp = 0.26m (see
Figure 2) and a separation distance between them of ap = 2Dp;

Experiments were performed to reproduce two configura-
tions in order to obtain comparisons with real situations:

A. Scour produced due to main propellers, which coincides in
literature with unconfined scenarios.

B. Scour due to bow thrusters close to quay wall, also named
confined situation.

Twin propellers were located at the lower part of a metal-
lic structure that was hanging from a railroad in each side of
LaBassa. The configuration allowed us to move the propellers
along the flume and locate them close to the opposite wall in or-
der to reproduce either the main propellers or the bow thruster
scouring processes.

A mechanized arm with three degrees of freedom was sus-
pended from a footbridge placed at the same railroads as the
propellers metallic structure, see Figure 1. Three photoelec-
tric sensors, Efector200-O1D100, were used to locate the po-
sition in the x-y-z coordinate system of the mechanized arm
with respect to the bottom of the tank. The z-component was
placed inside a cylindrical Perspex tank in order to acquire data

measured after scanning the sediment bed with 13 longitudinal
profiles and 11 transversal profiles, located as detailed in Table
2. The centre of coordinates for each scenario is shown in Fig-
ure 3 and located at the propellers plane for the main propeller
scenario and the end of the tank for the bow thruster scenario.

the speed direction of both propellers and was only used with
the bow thrusters configuration. Errors in the speed rotation
were of the order of 10% with a low difference of 3% from one
propeller to the other. Three different rotating velocities were
used for the two docking scenarios, n = 300, 350, 400 rpm, and
only the maximum rotating speed was used for the docking and
undocking case.

2.1. Main Propellers

Experiments performed to reproduce the scour caused by
the action of twin non-ducted main propellers were done locat-
ing the propellers at one end of LaBassA in order to avoid the
influence of the other end of the tank, as seen in Figure 3. How-
ever, the convective cells created in the tank influenced the jet
originated by the propellers. Thus, one can consider that the
influence of the propellers opposite end is negligible, but side
walls are clearly affecting the scouring results.

The scouring action caused by main propellers was simu-
lated by performing sequences of 5 hours run, except the first
run of 10 minutes which tried to reproduce the scaled time of a
docking and undocking maneuvering, concurrently.

2.2. Bow Thrusters

The scour produced by non-ducted bow thrusters was repro-
duced by moving the metallic structures holding the propellers
to a distance of 7Dp, as shown in Figure 3.

For each experiment, sets of 5 minutes with the forward
speed were used to evaluate the evolution of the scouring action
of the twin propellers, from 5 to 25 minutes. This sequence was
used in order to scale the duration of a docking manoeuvring
action of a cruise vessel without tugboat or pilot along an entire
week.

In order to reproduce a more realistic manoeuvre, we did a
second type of experiments with the bow thruster configuration.
Thus, a series of 5 minutes alternating forward (undocking) and
backward (docking) speed rotation, starting from an undocking
manoeuvre (forward design).

The difference in the time analysis between the main pro-
peller, 5 hours run, and the bow thruster configuration, 5 min-
utes run, was aiming to, respectively, find the asymptotic state
(described by (Hamill, 1988) around 48 hours) and reproduce
the reality as much as possible.

3. Results

3.1. Main Propellers

Results found after analysing the experiments performed
with the main propellers configuration revealed that the station-
ary time was not reached before 20 hours run. However, exper-
iments were stopped after 20 hours because the sediment layer
used was already eroded at some points of the sediment layer.

Figure 4: Scour due to main propellers after 15 hours running at 350
rpm.

Figure 4 plots a 3D rendering reproduction of the scouring
hole created by the propellers rotating at 350rpm with a max-
imum scouring depth of up to 1.8Dp and a maximum eroded
height of around Dp. In the case of twin propellers, the scouring
pattern turns out to be almost symmetric, since the rotating ef-
fect observed by (Hamill, 1988) for one propeller experiments
is compensated with the second propeller. This effect is also
confirmed in the other scenarios studied herein.

The scouring evolution of the centerline is shown in Figure
5 for the scenario of 400rpm. As detailed above, the concrete
bottom of LaBassA is reached after 20 hours of experiment re-
quiring a thicker layer of sediments from the beginning of the
experiments.

Figure 5 shows how the distance from the propellers plane
and the maximum scouring point increases simultaneously with
the deposited height. Thus, the scouring hole increases in length
and width, settling the sediment to an external ring that sur-
rounds the main eroded hole. It is important to point out that
the maximum deposited height is not located at the centerline
of the scouring hole, but in the lateral zones.

At the same time, (Lam et al., 2006) experiments revealed
that the influence of twin propellers is very local and disappears
in time. Figure 6 illustrates the low effect of separate propellers
in our experiments. The effect of twin propellers configuration
is not perceived in Figure 4, but a closed zoom to the transver-
sal profiles close to the propellers plane is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Transversal profiles in the X0 and X1 location, scanned for
the 300 rpm scenario.

The twin propeller?s influence is only detected in the X1 pro-
file, Figure 6b, particularly at the beginning of the experiment.
However, after 15 hours of experiment the twin propeller effects
close to the propeller plane disappear completely.

The main problem for harbor authorities may not only be
the maximum scouring depth caused by the main propellers, but
also the deposition and the further reduction in the basin depth,
as detailed by (Mujal-Colilles et al., 2016a). Figure 7a plots
the evolution of the maximum scouring depth, εmax , where the
asymptotic state is clearly not reached, as described previously.
The behavior of the three scenarios is consistent with qualita-
tive previous experiments (e.g. (Hamill, 1988; Geisenhainer
and Ka.Koll, 2014; PIANC, 2015)) and can be fitted within a
log-log profile. This work is left for further publications, where

more scenarios varying the clearance distance and the propeller
pitch will be included.

deposition heigh

On the other hand, the maximum deposition height, smax,
plotted in Figure 7b shows a clear semi-logarithmic tendency,
being proportional to the time logarithm.

3.2. Bow Thrusters

When the propellers are placed close to one end, the model
scenario is trying to reproduce bow thruster conditions. In this
case, as detailed in the previous section, propellers are located
7Dp meters from the opposite wall. Besides, experiments in
these scenarios were performed using 5 minutes runs instead of
5 hours, trying to simulate the entire process of docking and
undocking manoeuvring.

moving forward after 15 minutes run at 400 rpm. White line is the
location of the helix plane.

Figure 8 shows a 3D render plot of the results, with a clear
scouring hole formed close to the wall (x = 0). The effects up-
stream of the propellers shall be neglected since they are clearly
influenced by the experimental setup, and the shape of the ves-
sels hull is not included in this research. Underneath the pro-
pellers hub, there is a small sedimentation area, mainly due to
the negative pressure flow field created at this part of the pro-
pellers. This phenomenon may also occur in real vessels, how-
ever, the manoeuvring process balances the small sedimentation
hill, as reported by (Geisenhainer and Ka.Koll, 2014).

Figure 9: Contour plot evolution of bow-thrusters scenario, with a speed
revolution of 400rpm. Dashed line is the position of the helix plane.

Again, the asymptotic state is not reached after 25 minutes
run, but this was not the mail goal of the present experiments. In

Figure 9, the upstream scouring hole is static throughout the ex-
periments, but the main scouring hole located at the wall keeps
growing in time. The blank zone in Figure 9 is due to the set-up
of the scanning probe. In fact, the increasing rate of the maxi-
mum scouring depth, Figure 10, follows an exponential trend.

Figure 10: Maximum scouring depth evolution for the bow-thrusters
scenario with a speed revolution of 400rpm.

If the former case, using only forward speed conditions is
compared to a back and forth speed conditions of the bow thrusters,
there is a clear change, particularly upstream of the propellers.
In this case, the shape of the facility built to support the pro-
pellers is a clear influence in the formation of the upstream
scouring hole. However, the present experiments shall be used
as a guide to understand the process of the scouring hole due to
the docking and undocking process.

In Figure 11, a 3D render scan of the scouring hole pro-
duced after 15 minutes running with a series of 5 minutes forth
and back shows how the magnitude of the hole created close to
the wall is of the same order of magnitude of the scouring hole
formed upstream of the propellers.

Figure 11: Scour due to bow-thruster after 15 min forward at 400 rpm

The sequence of speed direction produced an interesting
phenomenon which consisted on the scouring process in the
downstream hole, while the sediment was settled in the up-
stream cavity and opposite. Figure 11 shows clearly this pro-
cess, with the formation of a connecting channel between them.
This channel was formed after a forward (docking) run and was
destroyed after a backwards run (undocking).

4. Discussion

A first comparison between the two propeller experimen-
tal configuration confirms what (Hamill et al., 1999) concluded
with their experiments: the effect of the boundary substantially
increases the potential erosion caused by propellers. In the
paper of (Hamill et al., 1999) experiments were done using a
single propeller and the maximum scouring depth was around
twice the depth caused by main propellers. At the same time,
the deposition of the eroded sediment settled close to the wall in
the neighborhood of the scouring hole. In the present research,
only the 10 minutes set up can be compared between scenar-
ios, being the maximum scouring depth found for bow-thrusters
configuration almost 4 times larger than the same variable for
main propellers. Therefore, the number of propellers is clearly
a variable to take into account when computing the scouring
effects produced by vessels, along with the engine power, the
pitch and the clearance distance.

When the two scenarios of the bow thruster configuration
are compared, it is clear that the back and forth scenario is less
dangerous for quay structures since one maneuver scouring pro-
cess balances the opposite maneuver. However, it seems that in
the asymptotic state both scenarios will yield the same maxi-
mum scouring depth close to the wall, being the more realis-
tic scenario the worst case. Besides, the docking and undock-
ing maneuvering produces two different cavities with twice the
eroded volume as the docking maneuvering with the subsequent
deposition problems along the harbor basin.

The experiments presented herein reveal what has already
been described in real harbors: the high scouring capacity of

the bow thrusters and main propellers close to the wall, produc-
ing big problems on the stability of quay structures. The conse-
quent problem of the sedimentation is also very important since
the reduction of the depth in some areas of the harbor basins
may force the vessels to maneuver in order to avoid these zones
and finally declare the harbor basin inoperative for certain ves-
sels with the consequent economic losses. The main propellers
results are more likely to occur in navigation channels than in
harbor basins. Therefore, results found during these investiga-
tions shall be considered as absolute values for harbor author-
ities and protection designs. However, if this is the situation,
the main problem for harbor structures and operational system
will not be the scouring process but the zone where the eroded
sediment is deposited. This is clearly influenced by the maneu-
vering actions of the vessels in the navigation channel or basin.
Besides, the deposition of contaminants at the bed of the har-
bor has to be tracked by studying the effects of main propellers
when the vessel transits the contaminated zone.

The expressions detailed in (Hamill, 1987; Hamill et al.,
1999) and (PIANC, 2015) were applied to the data of the exper-
iments with results far from the experimental data. It is left for
further studies a detailed description of the data and the prob-
lems in the formulations. Moreover, a new expression to esti-
mate maximum scouring and maximum sedimentation height is
now under development and will be published.

5. Conclusions

Results obtained after modelling main propulsion system
and bow-thrusters using a laboratory experimental facility built
with a twin propeller design are found to be different from the
previous data using a single propeller (i.e. (Hamill et al., 1999;
Chiew et al., 2003)).

First, main propeller experiments can be used as a guide-
line to obtain the erosion caused by vessels when manoeuvring
in navigation channels or areas with no rear influence of a wall.
This is important in order to estimate the amount of bedload
accumulated close to the walls of the navigation channel which
will reduce the depth of the area and can also cause environ-
mental problems to harbour authorities.

Second, in terms of the bow thrusters influence on the sta-
bility of quay structures, it is clear that the effect caused by the
propellers is very important and can cause severe damages to
the structures, particularly at the beginning of the undocking
manoeuvers and at the end of the docking manoeuvers. There-
fore, the prediction of the total erosion is important to design the
protections or implement some manoeuvring operations in or-
der to minimize such effect. The maximum erosion caused dur-
ing docking and undocking manoeuvers is more than twice the
erosion occasioned by the main propellers in an open channel.
However, the influence of main propellers during the docking
and undocking manoeuvring must be taken into account as well.
In this regarding, the estimation of erosion caused by main pro-
pellers close to quay walls can be computed with the formula-
tions proposed by bow-thrusters close to the wall or confined
areas, as seen in literature.



A. Mujal-Colilles et al. / Journal of Maritime Research Vol XIII. No. II (2016) 81–87 87

Finally, the sedimentation caused by the eroded sediment
is more important when the main propellers in a navigation
channel were analysed. However, the settling of the sediment
scoured by bow-thrusters may be more uniform and influenced
by the manoeuvring actions in the harbour basin. To prevent the
accumulation of sediments in certain zones, a detailed study of
the manoeuvers needs to be done, and further small changes in
the manoeuvres may prevent the harbour basin to be inoperative
in the same zones.
