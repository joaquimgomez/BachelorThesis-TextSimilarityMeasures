Abstract 1 

Estuarine waters are usually eutrophic due to nutrients input derived from natural and 2 

anthropogenic sources. In the Caeté Estuary, nutrients and thermotolerant coliforms 3 

input is intensified by the absence of a public sanitation system and by mangrove 4 

outwelling. This input is more accentuated in the upper sector of the estuary where 5 

90% of the local population is concentrated and a high incidence of commercial 6 

activities (public markets, ice factories and boat repairing among others) is located. 7 

As a consequence, eutrophic waters with high concentrations of thermotolerant 8 

coliforms (up to 1100 MPN/100 ml) were observed during the dry season when 9 

dilution and/or advection are less effective. Eutrophication, though less pronounced, 10 

also occurred in the other sectors (middle and lower), but these results seem to 11 

indicate that this could be a natural condition of an Amazon region which is naturally 12 

enriched with a high amount of nutrients. On the other hand, nutrient concentration 13 

values in the upper sector are similar to those found in other highly populated and 14 

industrialized Brazilian estuaries. Taking into account that the population increases by 15 

about 20% per decade in the region, this growth may lead to a significant increase in 16 

human pressure and impacts on the area, mainly during periods when the estuary is 17 

more susceptible to retaining nutrients (e.g., during the dry season). In order to 18 

improve water quality, the DPSIR framework was used as a guide for proposing 19 

potential measures to be implemented in the Caeté Estuary based on (i) urban 20 

planning to control sewage discharges, (ii) construction of water treatment 21 

infrastructures to reduce untreated effluents inputs and (iii) water use regulations as a 22 

function of the current water quality. 23 

Key-words: eutrophication, sewage outfall, mangrove outwelling, trophic status. 24

1. Introduction 25 

Estuaries are some of the most attractive coastal environments for human occupation 26 

because they have enormous potential for the development of several economic 27 

activities, such as agriculture, aquaculture, harbour and touristic activities (Kennish, 28 

2002 and Dias et al., 2013). Consequently, during recent decades, estuaries worldwide 29 

have been affected by rapid population growth, which has led to unregulated urban 30 

expansions and the corresponding effects of multiple human activities (Lindeboom, 31 

2002; Elliot and Quintino, 2007; Dias et al. 2013). As a result of excess nutrient 32 

inputs from anthropogenic sources, also known as cultural eutrophication (Hasler, 33 

1947), one of the major and most commonly associated environmental problems in 34 

these areas is the decrease in water quality. 35 

Estuarine waters are usually eutrophic due to land-derived nutrients (Janelidze 36 

et al. 2011; Majewska et al. 2012), and anthropic influences (e.g., the lack of an 37 

adequate public sanitation system) can contribute to an increase in the input of 38 

inorganic nutrients and organic components (Howarth and Marino, 2006; Burford et 39 

al. 2012). High dissolved nutrient concentrations generated by natural and/or 40 

anthropogenic causes can result in negative consequences, such as: (i) the increase of 41 

particulate organic matter and water turbidity; (ii) the occurrence of phytoplankton 42 

and microphyte blooms which may be responsible for the reduction of concentrations 43 

of dissolved oxygen in the water, inducing the mortality of some organisms, and (iii) 44 

the decrease of  local biodiversity (Roberts and Pierce, 1974; Anderson et al. 2002; 45 

Karlson et al. 2002; Burford et al. 2012). 46 

Cultural eutrophication has been detected in estuaries worldwide, from 47 

developing to developed countries (e.g., China, India, Brazil, Russia, United States, 48 



3 

 

and Australia) (Fisher et al. 2006; Martin et al. 2008; Santiago et al. 2010; 49 

Aleksandrov, 2010; De et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2012). In order to reduce this impact 50 

on estuarine environments, countries are progressively adopting measures to decrease 51 

nutrient loads from point and diffuse sources. The building of sewage treatment plants 52 

is the most common of these measures (Greening and Janicki, 2006).  53 

In Brazil, although the situation is progressively improving, the current public 54 

sanitation system is precarious, with less than 40% of the total domestic sewage being 55 

treated (IBGE, 2000). In the northern Brazilian coast (known as the Amazon coast), 56 

the situation is even worse, since the lack or the inefficiency of a public sanitation 57 

system occurs in practically 100% of local cities. Moreover, this coast is located at the 58 

edge of the largest and one of the best-preserved tropical rainforests in the world with 59 

the largest continuous mangrove system on the planet (Kjerve and Lacerda, 1993). It 60 

occupies approximately 35% of the Brazilian coastline and is characterized by the 61 

presence of dozens of estuaries, including the Amazon River Estuary. This estuarine–62 

marine system is also responsible for one of the largest run-off of sediments, 63 

dissolved nutrients, and organic material found on Earth (Geyer et al. 1996). Thus, 64 

eutrophication in this area can occur due to natural processes (e.g., outwelling from 65 

mangroves) and/or human processes (e.g. the presence of wastewater outfalls) 66 

(Menezes et al. 2009; Gomes et al. 2011).  67 

Within this context, we analyze in this study the environmental quality of the 68 

Caeté Estuary where Bragança city is located, a 400 year-old historical city. The area 69 

is naturally influenced by the presence of an important mangrove area, and 70 

anthropogenically, by the existence of several sewage outfalls, mainly in the upper 71 

estuarine sector. In this sense, this work can be considered as a good case study for 72 



4 

 

assessing the potential effects of expanding human settlements in these natural 73 

environments. Thus, the main goal of this work is to identify how natural 74 

characteristics of the region and anthropogenic activities surrounding the estuary 75 

influence the water quality. 76 

 77 

2. Study Area  78 

The Caeté Estuary is part of the Amazon estuarine system in Pará, NE Brazil 79 

(Figure 1). It consists of numerous channels that branch off and form the main 80 

mangrove peninsula. The main channel has a meandering form with a length of more 81 

than 40 km, and a width of 150 m at its southernmost limit and 4,600 m at the mouth 82 

(the Atlantic Ocean) (Guerra and Cunha, 1998). It can be classified as a well-mixed, 83 

permanently open, turbid, and shallow estuary, with a maximum depth of about 10 m 84 

(Dittmar et al. 2001; Barletta-Bergan et al. 2002). 85 

The climate of the area is classified as equatorial humid, with a wet season, 86 

between January and June, when total rainfall often exceeds 2,000 mm, and mean 87 

temperatures are around 26ºC to 27°C, and with a dry season, from July to December, 88 

when monthly mean rainfall is below 100 mm, and mean temperatures are around 89 

28ºC to 30°C (Martorano et al. 1993; INMET, 2009).  90 

 <insert Figure 1>  91 

The area is subjected to semi-diurnal tides, with a 4-6 m tidal range during 92 

spring tides, and a 2-4 m range during neap tides (Cohen et al. 1999; Pereira et al. 93 

2009, 2010). Fortnightly, the tidal water reaches the highest levels in the mangrove 94 



5 

 

forests and as a result dissolves solutes and other nutrients, transferring them into the 95 

estuary (Cohen et al. 1999; Pereira et al. 2010; Monteiro et al. 2011).  96 

The estuary is part of the Caeté-Taperaçu Marine Extractivist Reserve. It is a 97 

valuable and productive ecosystem, surrounded by a broad range of coastal 98 

environments, including salt marshes, tidal sand flats, coastal sand dunes, barrier sand 99 

ridges, creeks, and ebb tidal deltas, providing a wide variety of benefits to humans in 100 

the form of ecosystem services and functions.  101 

 The estuary is located at the Caeté hydrographic basin, which covers a total 102 

area of 2,195 km², where about 300,000 people live (IBGE, 2010). About 27% of this 103 

population (80,585 inhabitants) is concentrated along the estuarine sector in the 104 

municipality of Bragança. The city’s economy is based mainly on fishing, commerce, 105 

and tourism (IBGE, 2010). It occupies the third position in marine-origin fishery 106 

production in the state, which is the largest extractive fish producer of Brazil 107 

(CEPNOR - IBAMA, 2005). According to Krause and Glaser (2003), Glaser and 108 

Diele (2004), Gorayeb et al. (2009) and Guimarães et al. (2011), the principal 109 

economic activities of the local rural population are related to the sustainable use of 110 

natural resources, particularly fishing (crabs, mollusks, and fish) and agriculture (rice, 111 

beans, and açaí). 112 

 113 

3.  Material and Methods 114 

The study area was surveyed from April 2006 to February 2007, when rainfall, river 115 

discharge, tides, currents, and river hydrological data (i.e., dissolved nutrients, 116 

chlorophyll a and thermotolerant coliforms) were acquired.  117 



6 

 

Rainfall and wind speeds were recorded daily by the Brazilian Meteorology 118 

Institute – INMET (-1.06º S -46.9º W), while river discharge data was obtained from 119 

the Brazilian Water Agency – ANA (-1.16º S -46.5º W). 120 

Hydrodynamic and hydrological conditions were monitored during six field 121 

campaigns undertaken between April 2006 and February 2007. Each campaign was 122 

conducted during the spring tide over a 25-h period in three sectors of the estuary 123 

which are subject to different levels of human influence. The upper sector (St3, about 124 

40 km upstream the estuarine mouth) is characterized by a high human influence. 125 

With about the 90% of the total estuarine population (72,621 inhabitants), this sector 126 

concentrates main services available in the region (markets, hospitals, fishing and ice 127 

factories and boat repairs among others). On the other hand, the middle (St2, about 20 128 

km upstream the estuarine mouth) and lower sectors (St1, in the estuarine mouth) are 129 

representative of low direct human pressure: a fish processing plant (GPesca Ltda.) 130 

and two ice factories in the middle sector are the main human elements.  131 

The magnitude of sewage effluents produced by the local population was 132 

estimated by assuming that each inhabitant produced a minimum of 150 l per day of 133 

sewage effluents containing 54.0 g of DBO, 8.0 g of Nitrogenous and 2.5 g 134 

Phosphorous compounds (ABNT, 1993; Von Sperling, 1996). 135 

Water samples were obtained by using a Niskin bottle every 6 h at 3.0 m 136 

below the surface at the three sectors mentioned above (Figure 1). Simultaneously, 137 

current speeds were measured every 10 min using a mini-current meter (Sensordata 138 

SD 6000). The water level was measured by using a tide gauge located between the 139 

upper and middle reaches of the estuary at the same interval of 10 min (Figure 1). 140 

Tidal records representative of conditions at the outer part of the estuary were 141 



7 

 

obtained at the Salinópolis station from the Hydrographic and Navigation Department 142 

(DHN) of the Brazilian Navy. 143 

Water microbiological conditions were determined by means of the multiple 144 

tube fermentation technique (APHA, 1992), and results were evaluated in accordance 145 

with the criteria of the Brazilian Ministry of Environment - CONAMA (Ordinance nº 146 

274/2000). In this study, thermotolerant coliform concentrations were used as an 147 

indicator of anthropic pressure due to sewage outfalls.  148 

Salinity was measured with a salinity meter and dissolved nutrients 149 

(phosphate-PO4, nitrite-NO2 and nitrate-NO3) were analyzed according to the 150 

Strickland and Parsons (1972) and Grasshoff et al. (1983) methods. Chlorophyll a 151 

concentrations were estimated by the Parsons and Strickland (1963) and UNESCO 152 

(1966) methods. All collected data were analyzed according to spatial (different 153 

sectors of estuary) and seasonal (wet and dry periods) variations. 154 

To characterize the trophic status of the estuary two trophic indexes were used. 155 

The Karydis index, TI, is calculated as (Karydis et al, 1983):  156 

    
 

      
      

where, C is the log of the total loading of nitrates in an area, x is the total 157 

concentration of nitrates at a given station, and A is the number of stations. Score 158 

values provide a continuous assessment of water quality: TI values larger than 5 159 

indicate eutrophic waters; mesotrophic waters are indicated by values between 3 and 160 

5, and values lower than 3 correspond to oligotrophic conditions. The nitrate level 161 

was selected to determine the TI index because it is considered the best indicator of 162 



8 

 

water quality in areas affected by wastewater because nitrates dissolve quicker than 163 

other nutrients (APHA, 1992).  164 

The TRIX index was developed by Vollenweider et al. (1998) and it is given 165 

by: 166 

TRIX = (log10 [Chl a x (DO2%) x DIN x DIP] + k) / m 167 

where Chl a is the chlorophyll a concentration, DO2% is the oxygen saturation rate, 168 

DIN is the dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and DIP is the concentration of dissolved 169 

inorganic phosphorus. k and m are constants with values of 1.5 and 1.2 respectively. 170 

Water is classified according to the following scale: (i) 0 - 4: low eutrophication level 171 

and high water quality; (ii) > 4 - 5: medium eutrophication level and good water 172 

quality; (iii) > 5 - 6: high eutrophication level and bad water quality and, (iv) > 6 - 10: 173 

elevated eutrophication level and poor water quality. 174 

 175 

4. The behavior of the Caeté Estuary  176 

4.1 Physical processes 177 

The cumulative precipitation during this period reached 2,171 mm which is in the 178 

same order of magnitude of normal conditions for the Bragantinian region (long-term 179 

averaged annual rate of about 2,500 mm, INMET). Rainfall reflected the typical 180 

climate seasonality of the area, with two well-defined seasons: wet and dry (Figure 2). 181 

The wet season extended from January 2006 to July 2006, when the 92% of the 182 

annual rainfall occurred (total rainfall of 2,000 mm). Months with the lowest rainfall 183 

ranged from August 2006 to January 2007, with a total precipitation of 171 mm (8% 184 



9 

 

of the annual rainfall). The wettest and driest months were March (465 mm) and 185 

October (1 mm) of 2006, respectively.  186 

Hydrodynamic conditions in the estuary are controlled by the river discharge 187 

and tides. The highest river discharge was 82.5 m
3
/s, and it was recorded in April 188 

2006, at the peak of the wet season, whereas a minimum discharge of 3.0 m
3
/s was 189 

measured at the end of the dry season (January 2007) (Figure 2).  190 

<insert Figure 2> 191 

Water levels in the estuary varied between 4.2 m and 4.9 m at the upper sector 192 

and from 4.1 to 4.6 m at the lower sector. The largest tidal range was recorded during 193 

the dry season (August), whereas the smallest range was registered during the wet 194 

season (June). The tidal range increased in the upstream direction along the estuary 195 

between 0.10 and 0.40 m due to the narrowness of the channel in the middle sector. 196 

Tide propagation through the estuary is asymmetric, with an ebb period (6.3 to 8.3 h) 197 

that is longer than the flood period (3.8 to 6.0 h). The tidal asymmetry is lower during 198 

the dry season when the river discharge is the lowest.  199 

In general, the highest mean current velocities were recorded at the middle 200 

estuary (Figure 3), probably due to the presence of sand banks which narrow the 201 

estuarine channel. Observed seasonal differences in current velocity reflected 202 

variations in river discharge. During the wet season, the highest river discharge 203 

resulted in the largest ebb current velocities, which were recorded at the upper sector 204 

(around 1.0 m/s). During the dry season, the increase of the relative influence of 205 

marine processes due to low river discharges contributed to higher flood currents at 206 

the lower estuary, principally in October (0.7 m/s) and in December (0.9 m/s). 207 



10 

 

Moreover, during this period, constant winds blowing towards the land were 208 

dominant in the region, with average monthly values ranging from 3.0 to 4.0 m/s. 209 

These winds have induced a landward flow at the estuary mouth, contributing to the 210 

observed increase in flood current velocity. 211 

<insert Figure 3> 212 

 213 

4.2 Hydrological processes  214 

At the upper sector, the lowest salinity (around 0) and dissolved nutrient 215 

concentrations were recorded during the wet season (1.2 µm of nitrate-NO3, 0.1 µm of 216 

nitrite-NO2, and 0.3 µm of phosphate-PO4), most likely reflecting a larger dilution due 217 

to high river discharges. Moreover, we would expect that the long ebb tidal cycle 218 

(minimum of 8.0 h) and strong ebb currents observed in this period, would enhance 219 

the downstream advection of nutrients, directing them towards the middle and lower 220 

sectors. We observed that during the wet season, these downstream sectors presented 221 

slightly higher nutrient concentrations (maximum of 8.4 µm of nitrate-NO3, 0.7 µm of 222 

nitrite-NO2, and 1.0 µm of phosphate-PO4 in the middle sector; and 9.6 µm of nitrate-223 

NO3, 0.5 µm of nitrite-NO2, and 0.7 µm of phosphate-PO4 in the lower sector) (Figure 224 

4).  225 

During the dry season, the low river discharge contributed to an increase of 226 

salinity values (around 10) due to the higher marine intrusion into the estuary and to a 227 

lower dilution of effluents released in the upper estuary. As a consequence, dissolved 228 

nutrient values (mainly nitrogenous), increased in the upper sector (maximum of 35.6 229 

µm of nitrate-NO3 and 2.8 µm of nitrite-NO2). On the other hand, the transport from 230 



11 

 

upper to middle and lower sectors during ebb tide cycle was reduced (maximum ebb 231 

tide period in the upper sector 7.5 h) in such a way that a better water quality was 232 

observed in these sectors (a maximum of 12.9 µm of nitrate-NO3, 2.6 µm of nitrite-233 

NO2, and 3.3 µm of phosphate-PO4 in the middle sector; and 11.5 µm of nitrate-NO3, 234 

0.4 µm of nitrite-NO2, and 0.9 µm of phosphate-PO4 in the lower sector) (Figure 4). In 235 

addition, the large tidal range recorded during the dry season should favor the 236 

inundation of mangrove areas adjacent to the estuary. This increase in inundation 237 

would enhance the mangrove outwelling, with a corresponding increase in nutrient 238 

inputs to the estuary. 239 

The high chlorophyll a concentrations recorded (between 3.9 mg/m
3 

and 17.6 240 

mg/m
3
) demonstrated the high productivity of the system. Observed values did not 241 

show any clear seasonal pattern, however, values tend to increase near the sewage 242 

outfalls in the upper sector (Figure 4) during wet season.  243 

<insert Figure 4> 244 

 245 

4.3 Trophic Index 246 

Figure 5 shows calculated trophic conditions along the estuary during the monitoring 247 

period. Eutrophic conditions were frequent in the Caeté Estuary, indicating its high 248 

biological productivity. As was expected, the index presents the same spatial and 249 

seasonal trends as those observed for dissolved nutrients. 250 

During the wet season, the upper sector presents the mesotrophic condition due 251 

to the aforementioned downstream transport to middle and lower sectors that reached 252 

poorer conditions (eutrophic). In contrast, during the dry season, the upper sector 253 



12 

 

presented the largest values of the trophic index (eutrophic), whereas the downstream 254 

sectors tended to present mesotrophic conditions (Figure 5). Results obtained by using 255 

the TRIX index also indicated the worst conditions during the dry season in the upper 256 

estuary, corresponding to poor water quality and elevated eutrophication. In the lower 257 

estuary, no significant seasonal variations were detected, with elevated eutrophication 258 

being indicated in both seasons (Figure 5). During the dry season, both indexes 259 

predicted high eutrophicaton at the upper sector of the estuary, indicating that, during 260 

this period, estuarine dynamics was insufficient to naturally depurate the excess of 261 

nutrients in the water column. 262 

<insert Figure 5> 263 

4.4 Bacteriological State 264 

Figure 6 shows the variation of measured thermotolerant coliform concentrations 265 

along the Caeté Estuary during the monitoring period. With the exception of the April 266 

campaign (wet season), the highest concentrations measured occurred at the upper 267 

sector, with the sampling taken in February 2007 (end of the dry season) being the 268 

largest recorded value (>1100 NMP/100 ml), a value about 5 times higher than that of 269 

the lower estuary (<240 MPN/100 ml). This pattern would reflect the negative impact 270 

caused by untreated sewage effluents released in the upper sector of the estuary. This 271 

seasonal behavior is consistent with the observed pattern in dissolved nutrients, in 272 

which case concentrations in the upper sector drastically increased during the dry 273 

season and decreased during the wet period. 274 

Applying the criteria of the Brazilian Ministry of Environment for brackish 275 

water environmental quality standards (CONAMA - resolution nº 274/2000), the 276 



13 

 

water quality in the Caeté Estuary was good during the wet season. However, during 277 

the dry period, the water quality was inadequate for aquaculture, human supply and, 278 

even, primary contact. Observed values during the dry season were 4 times higher 279 

than accepted standards established by CONAMA criteria.  280 

<insert Figure 6> 281 

 282 

5. Human vs natural dimensions  283 

The previously described behavior of the waters of the Caeté Estuary is the result of 284 

the balance between natural system dynamics, which is governed by the river 285 

discharge and tidal dynamics, and human forcing, which alters natural conditions. 286 

Both components are put into context in what follows. 287 

 288 

5.1 Human forcing 289 

In recent decades, unplanned urban development associated with rapid population 290 

growth, the absence of efficient public policies, and associated human activities have 291 

caused serious social and environmental problems in the Caeté river basin (Gorayeb 292 

et al. 2011; Guimarães et al. 2011). 293 

The population in the Bragantinian region has grown significantly during the 294 

second half of the XXth century, with an increase of about 200% between 1940 and 295 

2010. In 2010, the total number of inhabitants in Bragança city and in small villages 296 

surrounding the Caeté Estuary was around 80,585 (IBGE, 2013), with about 90% 297 



14 

 

(72,621 inhabitants) living in the upper estuarine sector. The remaining inhabitants 298 

live in small villages located at the middle (7,672) and lower (292) sectors. 299 

Fishing is the main economic activity in the area, and is one of the main 300 

sources of sewage pollution in the estuary. Associated activities, such as ice factories, 301 

fishing factories, fishing markets, and boat repairs (boat docks), are located along the 302 

estuary. In the middle sector of the estuary one of the most important fish processing 303 

plants of the state of Pará (GPesca Comercial Ltda.) has been operating since 2002. 304 

This plant produces a daily average of 130 m
3
 of liquid effluents, which are treated 305 

before being released to the Caeté Estuary. Estimations of the total volume of BOD 306 

(biological oxygen demand) and nutrients discharged into the Caeté Estuary per day 307 

are shown in table 1. Unfortunately, difficulties in getting water consumption data 308 

from other local industries does not permit the quantification of the total amount of 309 

effluents released to the estuary.   310 

The most intense development of agriculture in the Caeté river basin is mainly 311 

concentrated in the high and middle sectors. In spite of this, previous studies carried 312 

out by Gorayeb et al. (2009) did not observe a significant influence of this activity on 313 

the river water quality. Along the estuarine part of the Caeté River (lower reach of the 314 

hydrographic basin), agriculture is essentially implemented at small scale (subsistence 315 

agriculture). Due to this difference in the scale of development, and extrapolating 316 

observations in the upper parts, we can assume that the influence of agriculture on the 317 

water quality of the estuary is low.  318 

<insert Table 1> 319

One of the main consequences of the unplanned urban development has been 320 

the absence of sewage treatment systems, which has become the principal agent 321 

affecting Caeté estuarine waters (Guimarães et al. 2009; Pereira et al. 2010, Monteiro 322 

et al. 2011). As a result of this, the Caeté Estuary receives direct sewage inputs or 323 

those transported by sewer networks (Gorayeb et al. 2009). The most important direct 324 

sewage outfalls along the estuary are shown in Figure 1.  325 

In order to estimate the order of magnitude of potential pressure, if we apply 326 

the Brazilian Standard for water treatment (ABNT/NBR-7229, 1993) the population 327 

situated along the Caeté Estuary (without considering industrial activities) should 328 

produce about 12,000 m
3 

per day of sewage effluents. This corresponds to an 329 

equivalent production of 5.4 tons of DBO, 0.6 ton of nitrogen and 0.08 tons of 330 

phosphorous. Due to the lack of water treatment plants, these effluents are not 331 

receiving the treatment recommended by the CONAMA criteria (Resolution nº 332 

274/2000), and they are discharged directly into the estuary.  333 

 In addition to this, the Cereja River is another important potential pollution 334 

source. This 4 km-long river course crosses Bragança, receiving the input of 335 

domestic, commercial and hospital sewage directly from existing outfalls, which are 336 

later released into the upper sector of Caeté Estuary (Guimarães et al. 2009). 337 

According to existing data, population dynamics and associated economic 338 

activities do not show significant temporal variations, which could be reflected in 339 

variations in the total amount of sewage released to the estuary. In this sense, the 340 

pressure associated with human activity in the estuary can be considered as 341 

reasonably steady during any climatic year. 342 



16 

 

 343 

5.2 Natural forcing 344 

In addition to the above mentioned nutrient source, the intrinsic characteristics of the 345 

Caeté Estuary, such as its location within the world's second largest mangrove region, 346 

which encompasses an area of 8,900 km
2
, can contribute to the nutrient balance. It is 347 

well known that mangrove forests exchange materials with the surrounding 348 

environment (estuary or coast) through tidal inundation. As a result of this, they 349 

usually tend to export nutrients (Woodroffe, 1992; Dittmar and Lara, 2001; Dittmar et 350 

al. 2006)  351 

In this case, the increase of the tidal range during spring tides enhances the 352 

inundation of the mangrove forest along the margins of the estuary. This inundation 353 

promotes the release of nutrients from mangrove sediments to the water column, and 354 

as a consequence, should induce an increase in nutrients. According to Dittmar and 355 

Lara (2001) and Adame and Lovelock (2011), the outwelling of nutrients and organic 356 

matter from mangroves measured at the Caeté Estuary (5.0 gN m
-2

 year
-1

) usually 357 

exceeds values recorded in mangrove forests in other regions of the world (e.g. Conn 358 

Creek in Australia: 1.2 gN m
-2

 year
-1

; Lobos Bay in Mexico: 1.8 gN m
-2

 year
-1

; see 359 

Ayukai et al. (1998) and Carrillo et al. (2009) respectively). Although this is a natural 360 

contribution to nutrient concentrations in the estuary, when it is added to the 361 

anthropogenic input both can synergistically induce a negative impact on the 362 

environmental quality of an estuary (measured in terms of nutrients concentration). 363 

This normally occurs when the estuary is more susceptible to “retaining” the nutrients 364 

(e.g., the dry season). 365 



17 

 

To put in perspective the present and future role of mangrove outwelling in the 366 

eutrophication process, it has to be considered that the extension and quality of 367 

mangroves in the area is subject to temporal changes (e.g.  Saint-Paul and Schneider, 368 

2010). As an example, Lara et al. (2010) detected a loss of 19 km
2
 of mangrove 369 

surface during the period 1972 to 1997. However, in a smaller scale analysis, these 370 

authors also observed a gain of 3.1 km
2 

in the middle sector of estuary during the 371 

period 1990 to 1999. To assess the potential consequences of these changes on 372 

nutrients release to the river, the evolution of mangroves needs to be monitored, and 373 

specially, the extension of the flooding area. 374 

Contrary to what has been observed in other estuaries such as the Nile or the 375 

Patuxent (Nixon, 2003; Boynton et al. 2008), the river discharge from the Caeté basin 376 

contributes to the dilution of effluents released into the estuary, mainly during the wet 377 

season when the river runoff is the highest. According to the data recorded in the 378 

Caeté Estuary, an average monthly river discharge of about 45.0 m
3
/s or more can be 379 

considered to be the threshold to converting river flow into an efficient mechanism 380 

that significantly reduces the impact of released effluents.  381 

This larger dilution capacity of sewage effluents observed during the wet 382 

season possibly occurs due to the low level of human activities in the hydrographic 383 

basin (other than those observed along the estuary itself in Bragança), which would 384 

not be expected to significantly affect the water quality of the basin. Regarding this 385 

dilution capacity, Gorayeb et al. (2008) showed that along the Caeté hydrographic 386 

basin, nutrient levels are very low (nitrate-NO3 < 2.0 µm, nitrite-NO2 < 0.2 µm, and 387 

phosphate-PO4 < 0.2 µm). Within this context, it ought to be mentioned that a change 388 

in land use in the drainage basin due to an excessive increase in occupation (and 389 



18 

 

corresponding human activities and uses) should modify this factor, producing a 390 

surplus of nutrients as has been observed in other areas (e.g., see  Noriega and Araújo, 391 

2009). 392 

During the dry season, the river runoff decreases, and it is not as efficient in 393 

diluting the effluents as it is during the wet period. Consequently, the nutrients and 394 

coliforms concentration increases in the estuary. This also serves to identify the high 395 

vulnerability of the system to climatic fluctuations, such as the El Niño phenomenon, 396 

which induces droughts in the area through teleconnections (e.g., see Marengo et al. 397 

2008).  398 

The impact of this lower dilution of discharged effluent is most pronounced in 399 

the region surrounding the urbanized zone (Bragança city, upper estuary). During this 400 

period, the concentration of thermotolerant coliforms was 5 times the maximum value 401 

for water permitted for human uses, and it also exceeded the recommended limit for 402 

effective conservation of aquatic life, according to the CONAMA criteria (Resolution 403 

nº 274/2000).  404 

 405 

6. The management perspective 406 

This study has shown that the water quality status in the Caeté Estuary is the result of 407 

a combination of factors where the human dimension is clearly dominant. This 408 

apparent causal chain between human forcing and environmental risk makes the 409 

DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) framework a useful tool to identify 410 

different measures to improve the current situation. The DPSIR (OECD, 1993) is an 411 

analytical framework to analyze environmental problems by identifying the links 412 



19 

 

between socioeconomic drivers, exerted pressures on the environment, resulting state 413 

of the environment, induced impacts and, societal responses to combat the problem. It 414 

has been largely used in the analysis of environmental problems in general and in 415 

water quality related issues in estuarine and coastal environments (e.g. Borja et al. 416 

2006; Zaldivar et al. 2008; Garmendia et al. 2012). Here this tool is used as a guide 417 

for proposing potential management measures to improve the system. 418 

Figure 7 illustrates the application of the DPSIR framework to analyze 419 

potential measures to be implemented in the Caeté Estuary. As can be seen, potential 420 

measures to mitigate/solve the environmental problem vary significantly in type 421 

depending on the target. 422 

<Insert Figure 7> 423 

As has been previously mentioned, the major driver controlling the analyzed 424 

environmental problem is the urban development around the estuary, especially 425 

Bragança city. This identification is an important issue since, for instance, according 426 

to European policies the primary focus of the DPSIR decision-making framework 427 

should be on driving forces (Rovira and Pardo, 2006). In this sense, the main type of 428 

measures to act on this driver is essentially proper urban development planning. 429 

However, at present, the city and small settlements already exist, so these measures 430 

would not be very effective. In spite of this, they could help to control further 431 

increases in sewage discharges into the estuary caused by ongoing urban growth. In 432 

this sense, it will be necessary to strictly regulate the occupation and development of 433 

new settlements in the near future, as laid out in the city’s master plan (Municipal 434 

Law nº 3875, Bragança, 2006). The responsibility for the implementation of these 435 

measures rests with the Urban planning and Infrastructure Departments of the 436 



20 

 

Bragança municipal administration, which must guarantee the inclusion of systems 437 

for the recovery and treatment of the domestic and industrial effluents produced by 438 

new settlements. Again, it is important to stress that although this measure will not 439 

solve current problems, they will avoid the increase of untreated effluents into the 440 

estuary. 441 

Another potential response is to directly act on the discharge of untreated 442 

effluents (pressure), which is responsible for the water quality deterioration in the 443 

upper estuary, principally during the dry season. In this case, the type of measures are 444 

related to building proper infrastructure and would require the construction of 445 

efficient sewage treatment systems to avoid the input of untreated effluents into the 446 

estuary. Ideally, this should include a sewage system collecting all wastewater and a 447 

treatment plant. At present, the responsibility for the treatment of domestic effluents 448 

rests with the Pará State Sanitation and Water Supply Company (COSANPA). In the 449 

short-term, this response is not likely to be effective since there is currently no public 450 

sanitation system in the municipality and these works likely would take decades to 451 

complete. In spite of this, it is compulsory to immediately start to implement these 452 

types of measures because they would provide a definitive solution for untreated 453 

wastewater release into the Caeté Estuary. 454 

The release of untreated sewage into aquatic environments is strictly forbidden 455 

in Brazil by resolution number 357/2005 (article 24) of the National Environment 456 

Council (CONAMA), and in Pará by state Law nº 5887/1995 (Pará, 1995). However, 457 

this work has shown that despite the existence of these laws, the state of the water in 458 

the Caeté Estuary is adversely affected by the existence of these effluents. Thus, the 459 

estuary has experienced episodes of eutrophication and microbiological pollution. 460 



21 

 

While management measures can be applied, they will probably not solve the 461 

environmental problems of the Caeté estuary directly, given that in most, if not all 462 

cases, they will do no more than monitor the quality of the estuary’s water. In this 463 

context, the current lack of any systematic monitoring of the water quality by local 464 

authorities and the complete absence of any effective punishment for infractions 465 

surely contribute to the ongoing contamination of the Caeté Estuary. 466 

Finally, when measures are directed to mitigate the identified impacts, which 467 

essentially are on economic activities dependent on water resources such as fishing, 468 

aquaculture and agriculture, they will be related to regulation. This implies the need 469 

to establish some limits and restrictions for water use depending on the current water 470 

quality. This is already regulated by CONAMA and its application to the recorded 471 

values indicate that those uses demanding high water quality, such as bathing and 472 

domestic use, should be prohibited during some seasons. Of course, to effectively 473 

implement this, an efficient monitoring program encompassing different sectors of the 474 

estuary will be required to guarantee the effective evaluation of water quality. This 475 

program should include the monitoring of indicators such as ammonia and 476 

biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in addition to those included in the present work 477 

(nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, thermotolerant coliforms and chlorophyll a). 478 

In any case, this regulation should consider specific characteristics of Amazon 479 

waters (high concentrations of dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll a) and fluctuations 480 

in the freshwater discharge associated with seasonal rainfall variations, events of 481 

equinox spring tides and other phenomena such as El Niño events. 482 

 483 



22 

 

7. Final consideration 484 

A comparison between values observed at the Caeté Estuary with similar 485 

environments (the Amazon region, macrotidal regions, or equatorial environments) 486 

demonstrated that observed values of nutrient concentrations in the middle and lower 487 

sectors correspond to those expected in the Amazon region reported by Lam-Hoai et 488 

al. 2006 (nitrite-NO2 + nitrate-NO3 between 0 and 21.0 µm and phosphate-PO4 489 

between 0 and 0.5 µm) and Pamplona et al. 2013 (nitrite-NO2 predominantly lower 490 

than 3.0 µm and nitrate-NO3 lower than 15.0 µm). However, the high quantity of 491 

nutrients and chlorophyll a observed in the upper sector does not correlate with the 492 

expected amount for regions with low industrial development and low population 493 

density. These values are similar to those found in other Brazilian estuaries subject to 494 

intense discharge of domestic and industrial effluents, such as the Pina basin and 495 

Tejipió river (frequent values of nitrite-NO2 from 1.2 to 4.3 µm, nitrate-NO3 from 1.7 496 

to 29.0 µm and phosphate-PO4 2.8 to 6.7 µm, Nascimento et al. 2003). They are also 497 

similar to values found in highly humanized areas such as the Recife and the 498 

Massangana harbors (chlorophyll a concentrations between 1.0 and 20.0 mg/m
3
; 499 

Flores-Montes et al. 2011, Alves et al. 2013; Cotovicz et al., 2013).  500 

In the Caeté Estuary, the high level of fecal coliforms found in the upper 501 

sector is indicative of the relevance of human influence (e.g., sewage effluents), and 502 

its potential contribution to the estuary eutrophic status. However, the eutrophication 503 

status observed in the middle sector may be essentially considered to be a natural 504 

process, since low coliform concentrations should be indicative of a significant 505 

decrease in human influence. 506 



23 

 

Yet the Caeté river basin has a low population density and a low industrial 507 

development, so human pressure can be considered to induce a moderate impact. The 508 

concentration of the population and the centralization of economic activities in the 509 

upper sector of the estuary, combined with the influence of a harbor, applies a 510 

considerable local pressure in this sector, with the potential risk of exporting their 511 

effects downstream. 512 

Assuming that the population grows about 20% per decade in the region, 513 

which leads to an increase in human impacts in the area, it is important to implement 514 

a monitoring program that will evaluate pressures and corresponding impacts on the 515 

estuary before it becomes affected in an irreversible way.  516
