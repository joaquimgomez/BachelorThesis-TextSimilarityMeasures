Abstract. A quantitative definition for the land–sea (coastal)
transitional area is proposed here for wave-driven areas,
based on the variability and isotropy of met-ocean processes.
Wind velocity and significant wave height fields are exam-
ined for geostatistical anisotropy along four cross-shore tran-
sects on the Catalan coast (north-western Mediterranean), il-
lustrating a case of significant changes along the shelf. The
variation in the geostatistical anisotropy as a function of
distance from the coast and water depth has been analysed
through heat maps and scatter plots. The results show how
the anisotropy of wind velocity and significant wave height
decrease towards the offshore region, suggesting an objec-
tive definition for the coastal fringe width. The more viable
estimator turns out to be the distance at which the signifi-
cant wave height anisotropy is equal to the 90th percentile of
variance in the anisotropies within a 100 km distance from
the coast. Such a definition, when applied to the Spanish
Mediterranean coast, determines a fringe width of 2–4 km.
Regarding the probabilistic characterization, the inverse of
wind velocity anisotropy can be fitted to a log-normal distri-
bution function, while the significant wave height anisotropy
can be fitted to a log-logistic distribution function. The joint
probability structure of the two anisotropies can be best de-
scribed by a Gaussian copula, where the dependence param-
eter denotes a mild to moderate dependence between both
anisotropies, reflecting a certain decoupling between wind
velocity and significant wave height near the coast. This
wind–wave dependence remains stronger in the central bay-
like part of the study area, where the wave field is being more
actively generated by the overlaying wind. Such a pattern
controls the spatial variation in the coastal fringe width.

1 Introduction

Land–sea border areas are narrow strips of water that display
unique met-ocean dynamics due to (a) non-linearity and sea
bottom interactions (including bathymetric control) for the
ocean (Shaw et al., 2008) and (b) differential land–sea heat
and a topographic control on winds (e.g. channelled winds
and coastal jets) (Miller et al., 2003; Estournel et al., 2003).
This results in enhanced gradients that interact with very pro-
ductive ecosystems and a large number of infrastructures and
socio-economic uses related to tourism, fisheries and aqua-
culture, or maritime transport (Halpern et al., 2008; Bulleri
and Chapman, 2010; Barbier et al., 2011; Sánchez-Arcilla
et al., 2016). However, the limits of this land–sea transition
remain fuzzy and even somewhat subjective, depending on
the type of process or application considered and with tech-
nical, economic and legal implications.

There is, thus, a need for a systematic and objective def-
inition of the coastal fringe that considers underlying pro-
cesses and that has general applicability allowing for the
time/space dynamics of this fringe. This type of approach has
been explored in the literature; for instance, Sánchez-Arcilla
and Simpson (2002) reviewed a number of possibilities based
on a dynamic balance of competing processes (i.e. drivers)
such as inertial effects, geostrophic steering, sea bed friction
or water column stratification. Another suitable option is to
focus on the consequences of such processes, such as the
nearshore morphodynamic features (Geleynse et al., 2012;
i.e. deltas, sand spits, overwash fans, beach berms). Both
complementary classifications require spatial data that need
to be accordingly updated within timescales that may range

from years (i.e. long-term erosion due to sea level rise) to
days (i.e. storm-scale).

In the last decades, the advent of remote sensing has led
to environmental monitoring at spatio-temporal scales that
were previously hard to achieve with just in situ measure-
ments. Hence, such high spatial resolution and short revisit
time offer an alternative source of information for such a
coastal zone definition, although with some limitations since
the data may start degrading at a few kilometres (approxi-
mately 10 km) offshore (Cavaleri and Sclavo, 2006; Wiese
et al., 2018; Cavaleri et al., 2018). The land boundaries in-
duce errors in the satellite observations. Hence, it is useful
to use high-resolution numerical simulations supported by
in situ data so that land–sea boundary effects are properly
captured for the subsequent coastal definition that will be
based on the heterogeneity introduced by the presence of the
land boundary.

The geostatistical anisotropy in wind and wave fields
(Swail et al., 1999) can be a useful indicator of spatial struc-
ture, affected by topo-bathymetric constraints that generate
substantial wave-driven gradients under strong met-ocean
conditions. In this text, the term “anisotropy” refers only
to the geostatistical anisotropy, not the geophysical one. A
wind or wave field that has a high anisotropy can present a
predominant wind or wave direction, respectively. It is well
known that the geostatistical anisotropy can be a measure to
define directional variation, e.g. for mineral configuration in
rocks (Amadei, 1996), for propagation velocity in heteroge-
neous media (Crampin, 1984) or for seismic waves (Verdon
et al., 2008). Similarly, topographically induced geostatisti-
cal anisotropy affects coastal wind patterns that force wave
and current fields (Soomere, 2003).

The aim of this paper is to analyse the geostatistical
anisotropy of nearshore wind and waves for wave-driven
coasts. From that, what follows is to propose a new quan-
titative and objective definition for the land–sea border that
benefits from these high-resolution (spatial and temporal)
fields and from the underlying process-based knowledge.
This definition can be useful to determine a set of criteria
for numerical purposes (e.g. nesting coastal domains) but
also for more practically oriented applications (e.g. offshore
limit for outfall dispersion). The analysis is based on a set of
high-resolution wind and wave fields in the latter case us-
ing a well-tested code such as SWAN (Simulating Waves
Nearshore; Booij et al., 1999; van der Westhuysen et al.,
2007; WISE Group, 2007; Zijlema, 2010). The numerical re-
sults, pertaining to a micro-tidal environment to avoid any
distortion of spatial patterns by tides, will be subject to com-
putationally inexpensive statistical methods to characterize
spatial structures. Following this approach, the paper is struc-
tured as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical back-
ground. Section 3 describes the study area, and the method-
ology is presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 lists the main results,
which are discussed in Sect. 6, followed by some conclusions
in Sect. 7.

statistical geometric anisotropy of a wind or wave field. Supposing
u and v are the two principal directions of anisotropy, the anisotropy
ratio is R = u

2 Theoretical background

Given a spatio-temporal field X(s, t), where s stands for a 2-
D vector (zonal and meridional components) and t is time, it
is assumed that the iso-level contours of the correlation func-
tions are invariant, i.e. ellipses in two dimensions. The main
axes of these ellipses are termed u and v (see Fig. 1). The
metric of the geometric anisotropy then becomes their ratio
R =

u
v

(R ∈ [0, ∞); Chorti and Hristopulos, 2008; Petrakis
and Hristopulos, 2017). An R value close to unity means that
u and v are isotropic, i.e. homogeneous across the different
directional sectors. As R increases, the difference between
the main axes increases, showing higher anisotropy at cer-
tain directional sectors.

Considering the ratio R as a 1-D random variable, it can
be fitted to a probability distribution function. Such a fitting
depends on theoretical and practical considerations. The pre-
ferred shape is determined by looking at statistical character-
istics such as mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis, or by
examining the similarity between quantiles (dataset versus
theoretical probability distribution) using a quantile–quantile
plot. The more direct candidates to fit variable R are (a) the
log-normal function, where the probability distribution of its
log-transform is Gaussian (Aitchison and Brown, 1958), and
(b) the log-logistic function, with a logistic probability distri-
bution for the log-transformed variable. A logistic distribu-
tion has a probability density function of the following form:

f (x)=
1
s

exp((x−m)/s)(1+ exp((x−m)/s))−2, (1)

wherem is its location parameter and s is its scale parameter.
Sklar’s theorem (Sklar, 1959) expresses the multivariate

joint probability structure of two variables x and y as the
product of their cumulative probability distributions F(x)
and G(y), and a 2-D copula. The interval of variation
in F(x), G(y) is [0, 1] and a 2-D Gaussian copula has the
following form:

bility structure has the form of a Gaussian copula, this struc-
ture can be applied without excessive computational cost (Li
et al., 2014; Rueda et al., 2016) compared, for instance, to
an Archimedean copula approach (Wahl et al., 2011; Lin-Ye
et al., 2016; Okhrin et al., 2013).

3 Study area

The selected pilot site is the wave-driven and micro-tidal en-
vironment of the western Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 2), where
enough validated met-ocean simulations exist and where the
spatial wind/wave structure will not be distorted by tidal forc-
ing. Current fields, slower to respond to the overlying mete-

orological driving, have not been considered in this initial
analysis. The focus is on the Spanish north-eastern Mediter-
ranean coast, where we have in situ and altimeter support-
ing data. Moreover, the continental shelf varies from 10 km
to more than 100 km in an alongshore distance of less than
500 km. The wind fields are affected (most frequent wind
direction is from land, approximately corresponding to the
north-west) by the presence of a mountain chain roughly par-
allel to the coastline and featuring several openings corre-
sponding to river valleys. The geometrical anisotropy anal-
ysis was performed at four transects, characteristic of their
common topo-bathymetric features. They correspond to the
following locations (from south-west to north-east): Ebro
(40.7◦ N, 0.87◦ E), Tarragona (41.12◦ N, 1.25◦ E), Mataró
(41.53◦ N, 2.45◦ E) and Begur (42.28◦ N, 3.02◦ E) (Fig. 2).

The north-western Mediterranean presents a particularly
intense wind forcing, which is shaped by local orography
(Jordi et al., 2011; Lebeaupin Brossier et al., 2012). The
Pyrenees mountain chain across the strip of land connect-
ing the Iberian Peninsula to the European continent forces
a strong northern wind flux following the French–Spanish
Mediterranean coast (Nicolle et al., 2009; Schaeffer et al.,
2011; Obermann-Hellhund et al., 2017). This same wind pat-
tern is channelled by the river valleys resulting in a north-
western orientation for winds blowing from land to sea fur-
ther down along the coast (Cerralbo et al., 2015) for latitudes

southward of 41◦ N. The most frequently observed patterns
are thus from the north in the coastal sector closer to the
Pyrenees barrier and from the north-west further south, con-
ditioned by the river valleys and gaps in the coastal parallel
mountains (Obermann et al., 2016; Lin-Ye et al., 2016). The
second most frequent pattern corresponds to western winds,
associated with atmospheric depressions in northern Europe
(Barnston and Livezey, 1987; Trigo et al., 2002; Lin-Ye et al.,
2017). Easterly winds are frequent during the summer, trig-
gered by an intense high-pressure area over the British Isles.

The most common wave fields in the northwestern
Mediterranean Sea correspond to the wind-sea spectral band
driven by easterly, northerly and north-westerly winds (Li-
onello and Sanna, 2005; Bolaños et al., 2009). Because of
the semi-enclosed character of the basin, the waves are fetch-
limited, with maximum trajectory lengths around 600 km,
one-sixth of the average distance that a wave train trav-
els across the Atlantic (García et al., 1993). The aver-
age wave climate in the north-western Mediterranean Sea
presents a mean significant wave height (Hs) of 0.78 m at
the southern part of the Catalan coast, near the Ebro Delta
and slightly lower values (around 0.72 m) further north and
close to the French border. The spatial distribution of wave
storms presents an opposite trend, with maximum Hs be-
tween 5.48 m in the southern sector and 5.85 m at the north-
ern coastal stretch (Bolaños et al., 2009). Future projections
(Casas-Prat and Sierra, 2013) indicate, for the interval 2071–
2100 and the A1B scenario (IPCC, 2000), a variation in
the significant wave height around ±10%, whereas the same
variable for a 50-year return period exhibits rates of change
around±20 %. Additionally, the variability in large-scale in-
dices (i.e. North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO; East Atlantic Os-
cillation, EA; or Scandinavian Oscillation) may drive sig-
nificant changes in wave-storm components (Lin-Ye et al.,
2017).

4 Methods

The approach suggested for assessing the geostatistical
anisotropy of wind and wave fields is schematized in Fig. 3.
It requires high-resolution met-ocean fields to determine how
the covariance of the geostatistical anisotropies of wind and
wave fields evolve with distance to the land–sea border. The
starting point is wind and associated wave fields, as the sug-
gested candidates for reflecting the heterogeneity induced
by coastal topo-bathymetry. Although other definitions of
the coastal boundary can be based on river plumes or bio-
geochemical processes, it has been intended to focus on a
more hydro-dynamical expression of such a boundary for
wave-driven coasts. It is intended to show that, as one ap-
proaches the coast, the wind and the wave fields should
present a greater geostatistical anisotropy, i.e. they should
display predominant wind and wave directions. Furthermore,

per. The dashed blue rectangle represents the input data, and the
dashed red rectangle indicates the output data. The wind velocity
is obtained from an external source, and it was validated in Martin
et al. (2006). The rest of the steps have been carried out for this anal-
ysis. Rectangles indicate data generation (input/output), and rhom-
buses indicate the subsequent analyses of the proposed methodol-
ogy.

there should be a geostatistical boundary to the value of this
anisotropy that could help define a coastal boundary.

The wind fields have been provided by the UK Met Office
from their Unified Model (Cullen, 1993) for weather and cli-
mate applications. This code solves the compressible, non-
hydrostatic equations of motion with semi-Lagrangian ad-
vection and semi-implicit time stepping, including suitable
parameterizations for sub-grid scale processes such as con-
vection, boundary layer turbulence, radiation, cloud micro-
physics and orographic drag (Brown et al., 2012). There are
two atmospheric prognostics: the dry one (three-dimensional
wind components, potential temperature, Exner pressure and
density) and the moist one (specific humidity and prognostic
cloud fields (Walters et al., 2011). Both long- and short-wave
radiation (from the Sun and the Earth itself) are included, and
the effect of aerosols reflecting radiation is taken into con-
sideration. These wind data have been validated in previous
works, such as in Martin et al. (2006).

The computational domain of the wind field spans the
whole Mediterranean Sea using a regular grid with spacing of
17 km and a time step of 1 h. The wave fields have been cal-
culated with the SWAN code, covering the same geograph-
ical domain and with an equal time step of 1 h. SWAN is a
spectral wave model based on the wave action balance equa-
tion (Booij et al., 1999; Zijlema, 2010) that includes non-
linear interactions at various depths and dissipation processes
(i.e. whitecapping, bottom friction, wave breaking). It applies

A. Sánchez-Arcilla et al.: The land–sea coastal border 117

a fully implicit numerical scheme for propagation in geo-
graphical and spectral spaces that is unconditionally stable.

SWAN employs an unstructured grid with spatial resolu-
tions of 600 m–40 km, denser near the land–sea boundary.
Mesh sizes are proportional to bathymetry gradients and dis-
tance to the coastline, following the same criteria than in
Pallarés et al. (2017). Such a non-structured-grid approach
avoids nesting and internal boundary conditions, while main-
taining a good spatial resolution to capture bottom and coast-
line irregularity (submarine canyons and capes or pro-deltas
that are found in the Catalan continental shelf). Furthermore,
unstructured meshes are well suited to tackle non-linear ef-
fects (Qi et al., 2009; Roland et al., 2012; Roland and Ard-
huin, 2014). The resulting wave fields have been validated
with two directional wave buoys at the northern (Begur, de-
ployed at 1200 m) and southern (Tarragona coastal buoy, de-
ployed at 15 m) ends of the domain, managed by Puertos del
Estado (Fig. 2). Altimeter data from three satellites (CryoSat,
Jason-2 and Jason-3) are also used as a complementary ob-
servational source. The simulation period ranges from Octo-
ber 2016 to March 2017.

Once obtained the wave outputs, the empirical semi-
variograms for the significant wave height and the wind ve-
locity at 10 m are estimated. In order to have enough data, the
spatial radius of influence is assumed to be 5 km, plus time
blocks of 24 h. From these semi-variograms, the anisotropy
for the wave height (RHs ) and the wind velocity (RVw ) is es-
timated along the four transects in Fig. 2.

Distance to the coast (x) and water depth (h) are selected
as independent variables for analysing the anisotropy spatial
patterns. RVw and RHs are taken to represent the behaviour of
met-ocean conditions under the effect of the land–sea bound-
ary (in this initial analysis height/depth gradients in topo-
bathymetry). Hence, RVw and RHs have been interpolated
(1 km spacing) along a 100 km transect perpendicular to the
coast (see Fig. 2), considering periods of 24 h, long enough
for the waves to respond to the acting wind forcing.

The geostatistical anisotropy needs to be computed on a
regular grid and therefore both wind velocity (Vw) and sig-
nificant wave height (Hs) have been interpolated on a rect-
angular mesh, first on a grid of 1 km then to a finer mesh of
10 m.

The interpolation method used in this case is the inverse
distance weighted (IDW) interpolation, which estimates the
value at an interpolated location (x) as the weighted average
of neighbouring points with weights w(x) given by

w(x)=
1

d(x,xi)
p
. (3)

Here, xi is a neighbouring point, d is the Euclidean distance
and p is the inverse distance weighting power. The IDW
power chosen is 1 for RVw and 3 for RHs and h, based on
a sensitivity analysis for this area and consistent with the
physical relation between wind velocity and generated wave
height.

Heat maps are used to represent the spatial distribution of
the geostatistical anisotropy, showing how the density of R
behaves as a function of distance to the coast and time (see
Figs. 6 and 7). These maps are scatter plots that act as a
2-D histogram, in which two variables (in this case R and
distance to the coast) are grouped in pre-defined intervals.
The elements selected to aggregate samples for the heat map
are hexagons with 5 km side and a scale for anisotropy of
20 units for both RVw and RHs . Both R and its variance are
calculated on a discrete number of distances to the coast-
line, assuming that the width of the fringe affected by bound-
ary effects is below 100 km for this coastal sector (Sánchez-
Arcilla and Simpson, 2002). From here, as is with signifi-
cant wave height to determine the presence of wave storms
(Eastoe et al., 2013; Bernardara et al., 2014), the proposed
coastal zone limit is the cutting point where the variance in R
is equal to the 90th percentile of the total R variance span-
ning a fringe between 0 and 100 km:

l = 90th percentile of var
(
RHs (0km≤ x ≤ 100km)

)
. (4)

This cutting point has shown, as expected, larger stability for
the wave field than for the forcing wind patterns. The varia-
tion in RHs with coastal distance x (Fig. 7) indicates for ref-
erence the 20 km distance where satellite data offer enough
robustness (Cavaleri and Sclavo, 2006; Janssen et al., 2007;
Durrant et al., 2009). The plot also displays depth against x.
The obtained RVw and RHs values were fitted to a probabil-
ity distribution, empirically selecting the log-normal function
for the inverse of RVw and the log-logistic function for RHs .
Once the marginal distributions are estimated, the depen-
dence structure of the joint probability is adjusted to a Gaus-
sian copula (see Sect. 2).

5 Results

The modelled wave heights (Hs) have been validated with
buoys from the Puertos del Estado monitoring network and
available altimeter data (Jason-2, CryoSat and Jason-3). Two
locations have been selected, located at the southern (Tarrag-
ona) and northern (Begur) coastal sectors (Figs. 4 and 5). The
Hs buoy data show good agreement with the simulated Hs,
quantified in Table 1 and in Figs. 4 and 5.

In general, the wave model performs better for deep wa-
ters than for coastal waters. The standard deviation is higher
in the model than in the observations. At Begur, the bias and
the scatter index are lower, whereas the RMSE is higher (Ta-
ble 1). At the same buoy, the correlation coefficient is near
95 % and the difference between standard deviations is lower
(0.2 m vs. 0.4 m). Note that the northern part of the Catalan
coast is more energetic than the southern one (see Fig. 5).
For instance, in Begur the storm peaks can reach about 7 m,
whereas at Tarragona the highest recordings are 3.5 m.

The collocated altimeter data have a positive bias in the
coastal zone, and the opposite (i.e. negative bias) in deep

waters. Nevertheless, there exists qualitative consistency be-
tween the in situ and remote-sensing sources. Additionally,
SWAN has been able to capture the regime switching and the
proper timing of the storms, despite that it tends to underes-
timate the magnitude of the storm peaks.
RVw and RHs have been analysed with heat maps (Figs. 6

and 7) and scatter plots (Figs. 8 and 9). RVw presents values
that span from 1 to 250 and display a dependence on coastal
distance (Fig. 6), featuring a combination of anisotropy close
to the land boundary (0 to 20 km) and then a more isotropic
behaviour towards the offshore region (up to 100 km), al-
though with a rich variability. The wind fields present, in
summary, a decreasing variance from 0 to 100 km with a
pronounced slope from 0 to about 40 km (southern sector)
or even further offshore (northern sector) and then an almost
asymptotical trend. RHs behaves similarly to RVw , but with a

turning point at about 40 km in all transects (Figs. 8 and 9)
and, thus, a higher level of consistency. From December to
January, there are some winds and waves registered within
20 km of the coast that present higher RVw and RHs ; how-
ever, they are so few that the variances in RVw and RHs in
this area do not differ from warmer seasons. Therefore, there
is not a clear seasonality to the RVw or the RHs . The coastal
zone limit l, corresponding to the 90th percentile of the total
variance (fringe between 0 and 100 km), is calculated from
Eq. (4) (Figs. 8 and 9) and is 3 km. It is consistent with the
time interval (month of study) and location (sector).

In order to find a copula structure, marginal probabil-
ity distributions for the two anisotropies are needed. Skew-
ness and kurtosis from the analysed data show that the in-
verse anisotropy of Vw follows a log-normal distribution,
while the anisotropy ofHs follows a log-logistic distribution.
Quantile–quantile plots were used to assess the fit of each
probability function (not shown here) to its target dataset,
verifying that the selected samples can be adjusted to the
corresponding probability distributions. The joint probabil-
ity structure of the two anisotropies does not present any
marked dependence for the upper-tail percentiles, suggesting
the use of a Gaussian copula, whose dependence parameter ρ
is shown in Fig. 10. The so obtained dependence ranges from
total independence (0) to a mild (|ρ12| = 0.1) dependence be-
tween RVw and RHs .

6 Discussion

The calculated anisotropies should be as robust as the start-
ing wave or wind fields that are employed in the analysis. Be-
cause of that, the SWAN code has been calibrated with local
atmospheric and hydrodynamic conditions (Pallarés et al.,
2017). Special emphasis has been put on using high-quality
wind fields, both for the direct assessment linked to meteo-
rological fields and for the indirect effect they exert on the
behaviour of the forced hydrodynamics. The results show,
as expected, a higher level of robustness for the wave-based
geostatistical anisotropy, where the calculations used an un-
structured grid and a locally adjusted whitecapping term cal-
ibration (Pallarés et al., 2014). The cell size has been deter-
mined as a function of depth and distance to the coast, con-
sistently with the transect analyses performed in the paper.
The application of an unstructured grid allows for reducing

computational costs (by about 50 %) and the troublesome im-
position of internal boundaries.

This leads to an efficient determination of the coastal water
boundary that contains some of its common geometric set-
tings (e.g. bathymetric gradients affecting wave fields). Other
processes, such as the continental discharge are of course not
captured by the present analysis and would require a simi-
lar approach based on the resulting circulation fields, which
would certainly capture the regions of fresh-water influence
and wave–current interactions (Staneva et al., 2016). How-
ever, the performance of the wave model has shown com-
monalities with previous studies. For instance, the good per-
formance of spectral models at the Begur buoy can be found
in multi-model comparisons (see Bertotti et al., 2012), and
also the consistent underestimation under storm peaks (Cav-
aleri, 2009).

The anisotropy-based approach will lead to different re-
sults depending on met-ocean conditions (wave conditions in
our case), requiring a reliable simulation of both average and
extreme patterns, as shown by the validation process (e.g.
see Figs. 4 and 5). The transfer of energy from the coastal
to the offshore domain and vice versa may condition the re-
sults of the analysis for areas near the transition, which is

where the boundary will be likely located. This suggests a
combined approach using numerical fields and satellite data
supplemented by along-track in situ observations, all suitably
interpolated in space and time to provide a picture that is as
consistent as possible.

The values of Vw, Hs and h obtained through the IDW in-
terpolation, using an IDW weighting from 1 to 3, are sim-
ilar and reasonable. For marine variables the weight of 3
has been selected to account for the influence of the clos-
est neighbours based on the water inertia (which is 3 orders
of magnitude larger than for air). The proposed IDW power
for Vw is smaller because gas is more turbulent than water
and thus should have a smaller spatial dependence. The ob-
tained pattern for RVw is consistent for the four selected tran-
sects in the study area, showing a mostly isotropic behaviour
for coastal distances from 0 to 100 km. Higher values of RVw
at distances from the coast below 20 km (see Fig. 6) indi-
cate a clear directional spread of winds within the coastal
fringe, linked to orographic control such as channelling by
local mountains and river valleys.

Despite the fact that the results are based on Novem-
ber 2016 and February 2017, the spatial trends of the

(near the Ebro Delta), (b) central-south transect (near Tarragona harbour), (c) central-north transect (near Mataró harbour) and (d) north
control transect (near Begur cape). The elements selected to aggregate samples for the heat map are hexagons with 5 km side and a scale

anisotropy were coherent throughout the simulation period,
thus exhibiting the robustness of the methodology.

The numerical wind fields present errors below 2 m s−1

(Martin et al., 2006), which means that the Vw calculated can
well represent actual wind conditions. The RVw is lower in
the Ebro Delta (Fig. 6a) than at Tarragona (Fig. 6b) due to
the fact that the orography at the Ebro Delta is flat, and wind
blows from a wide range of directions; whereas Tarragona
features mountain chains that channel the winds into a more
limited directional subset. The anisotropy pattern at Begur
(Fig. 6d) may be explained by the strong mistral and eastern
winds (Obermann et al., 2016; Obermann-Hellhund et al.,
2017) that both affect nearshore and deep waters.

Hence, the behaviour of RVw near the coast can show
sharp local variations due to the joint effect of orography,
mesoscale circulation and large-scale circulation, all affect-
ing wind strength and directionality. However, the seasonal-
ity does not affect RVw as much. In all cases, Vw becomes
more isotropic towards the offshore, denoting a decreasing
control by the land–water boundary.

The RHs pattern is similar, with wave fields show-
ing boundary effects (mainly in directional properties) for
coastal distances below 50 km, which has also been consid-
ered an order of magnitude estimate for land wind effects.
Farther from the coast there is a clear trend to isotropy, more

pronounced for transects with more stable atmospheric con-
ditions. The link between RHs and land-originated winds
can be appreciated by the shift from a homogeneous to
anisotropic behaviour in the northern- most transect (Begur)
where the effect of Vw onHs is only evident up to 38 km from
the coast. Note that the Ebro Delta shows a more isotropic
value at the coastal zone. This area presents a wider continen-
tal shelf than the other profiles, where wave dissipation and
refraction tend to be more homogeneous. Henceforth, more
anisotropic winds plus a steeper profile may be considered
as the main reasons for the discrepancies among the beach
profiles.

Such behaviour of RHs with coastal distance parallels
that of particulate matter diffusivity, which tends to become
isotropic at around 10 km (Romero et al., 2013) from the
land–water boundary. The degree of geostatistical anisotropy
in diffusivity is physically related to eddy kinetic energy,
which varies as x5/4 (x being separation distance) for depths
below 20 m (Gràcia et al., 1999). A steep bottom slope will
favour deep-water wave behaviour at relatively short dis-
tances from the coast, as shown by the distinctive behaviour
of RHs for coasts of different slope. However, although
RHs presents greater variance (more outliers) for steep slopes
(e.g. due to the combination of deep- and shallow-water wave
regimes as in the central-north transect near Mataró harbour),

Figure 7. Heat map of the geostatistical anisotropy ratio of significant wave height (RHs ) against distance to the coast for (a) south control
transect (near the Ebro Delta), (b) central-south transect (near Tarragona harbour), (c) central-north transect (near Mataró harbour) and
(d) north control transect (near Begur cape). The elements selected to aggregate samples for the heat map are hexagons with 5 km side and
a scale for anisotropy of 20 units. The counts are the number of elements within a hexagon. A rough limit of the order of magnitude for the

the gradient ofRHs with distance to the coast is similar for all
types of bathymetry considered, suggesting a generic value
of the proposed approach. This is also true for any time of
the year.

The coastal boundaries suggested by Sánchez-Arcilla and
Simpson (2002) for the Catalan Coast can be 0.1–0.6 km
(frictional coupling of fluids between shelf and nearshore),
10 km (non-linear coupling between shelf and slope) and
1 km (non-linear coupling between shelf and nearshore),
among other suggested values of the same order of magni-
tude. The l provided in our analysis is slightly larger than
the value given for the frictional coupling of fluids between
shelf and nearshore, whereas it is similar or smaller than in
the non-linear couplings. Nevertheless, the orders of magni-
tude are similar.

The ρ parameter of the Gaussian copula, characterizing
the dependence structure among RVw and RHs , reflects a
certain similarity to the spatial behaviour for both variables
(see Figs. 6 and 7). The overall mutual dependence of RVw
and RHs is strongest for the northern-most transect (Begur),
where the topo-bathymetric control of the Pyrenees and their
submerged signature becomes better defined. Such mutual
dependence gets weaker for the central and southern coastal

transects (see Fig. 10). There seems to be a strong wind chan-
nelling aligned with the main river valleys (Sánchez-Arcilla
et al., 2014; Rafols et al., 2017) in February and March, dom-
inating the local wave fields. The ρ parameter should reflect
this spatial and temporal variation, resulting in a coastal zone
width that will be a function of the prevailing met-ocean
drivers and should thus be considered a dynamic concept.

The resulting coastal definition can be data (numerical
or observed) driven, being directly applicable to any region
with a forecasting system or with enough coverage of in situ
plus satellite data. The proposed criteria appear to work well
for wave-dominated and micro-tidal environments; and al-
though suitable for any combination of factors, their appli-
cation to macro-tidal regimes or river-discharge-dominated
areas should account for the corresponding signature in the
hydrodynamic fields. Under these conditions, the preferred
variable could change to current velocity or to temperature,
considering in all cases the effect of spatial resolution in the
results.

height (RHs ) from shore to 100 km offshore. Locations are (a) south control transect (near the Ebro Delta) and (b) central-north transect
(near Mataró harbour). The distance of 20 km, which has been suggested as an approximate order of magnitude limit for direct applicability
of remote-sensing data, is also shown (dashed blue line) together with the variance in RHs across the transect. From here, the coastal zone
anisotropy-based boundary has been calculated and is also depicted. A dash-dotted green line delimits its horizontal distance from the coast,
whereas a dotted purple line denotes its elevation.

7 Conclusions

The proposed coastal fringe (water sub-domain) definition
is based on an objective estimation of the geostatistical
anisotropy as a proxy for the influence of the land border.
The suggested statistical assessment can be applied to any

variable that reflects such an influence (here it has been il-
lustrated with wind velocity and significant wave height) and
can be easily automated for any field, numerical or observa-
tional, that presents enough resolution.

The methodology has been tested with numerically gen-
erated fields and validated with datasets from Puertos del

Estado buoys and altimeter. Anisotropies of wind velocity
and significant wave height have been extracted along a set
of characteristic profiles spanning widths of up to 100 km
(see Fig. 2), considered sufficient for the relatively narrow
shelves in the Spanish Mediterranean coast. The performed
analysis has shown how wind and wave fields are influenced

by the land–sea border, demonstrating the topo-bathymetric
control on met-ocean factors. This control depends on topo-
graphic (mountain chains and river valleys) and bathymetric
(bottom slope, submarine canyons or pro-deltas) features but
also on the energetic level of the prevailing weather, lead-
ing to a dynamic definition of the coastal water domain.

Figure 10. Copula parameters ρ of the proposed Gaussian copu-
las for all considered profiles: (a) south control transect (near the
Ebro Delta), (b) central-south transect (near Tarragona harbour),
(c) central-north transect (near Mataró harbour) and (d) north con-
trol transect (near Begur cape). The plot shows the variation with
time (horizontal axis) between November 2016 and March 2017.
The parameters are placed in a manner such that they start from
January.

The resulting widths, based on variance variation, span dis-
tances in the kilometre range, depending on bottom slope
and coastal plan-shape geometry. The correlation between
the wind- and wave-based definitions (i.e. the mutual de-
pendence among RVw and RHs ) seems to be stronger in
the northern-most parts of the study area, where the topo-
bathymetric control is most prominent.

This new definition of the coastal zone can be useful for
setting up standards to delimit this transitional fringe, facil-
itating the selection of processes and boundary conditions
for modelling and providing an objective coastal zone limit
for impact assessments. Such an approach can also support
directional and asymmetric measures of error and the under-
lying metrics (between model and data), leading to improved
products and standards in the coastal zone.
