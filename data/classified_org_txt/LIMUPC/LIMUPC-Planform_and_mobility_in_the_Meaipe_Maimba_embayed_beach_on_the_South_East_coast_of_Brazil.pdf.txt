Abstract 

 

The Meaípe-Maimbá embayed beach (MMEB) on the south-east coast of Brazil has been subject 

to anthropogenic pressures since the 70's. In this study we discuss the adequacy and contribution 

of the parabolic planform model to determine the planform and variability of the MMEB, taking 

into consideration variation in wave conditions. The role of different controlling conditions on the 

planform variability is analyzed, as well as the morphological and planform mobility. MMEB 

exhibited a new configuration in response to the construction of a harbor, which interrupted the 

longshore sediment transport. After four decades, three particular morphodynamic sectors have 

been recognized along the beach. The central sector is more exposed to normal wave incidence 

and cross-shore processes predominate. The northern and southern sectors are influenced by 

wave diffraction processes around the headlands and port, respectively. In the northern sector, 

the presence of secondary headlands and inner islands imposed a geomorphological control on 

beach morphology and coastal processes. The use of the parabolic planform model provided 

useful insights for the assessment of potential planform mobility, since the decadal shoreline 

evolution combined with beach profiles and sediment characteristics allowed understanding of 

the beach mobility processes and supported the interpretation of modeling results.  

 

Key words: planform modelling; geological control; beach morphodynamics; medium-term.

1 - Introduction 

 

Understanding beach morphological variations is a major challenge for geomorphologists, coastal 

engineers, researchers and managers. Conceptual and numerical models for planform and cross-

section equilibrium determination are widely used to analyze beach morphodynamics and to 

predict coastal evolution due to climate change or anthropogenic interventions (e.g. Krumblein, 

1944; Hsu and Evans, 1989; Moreno and Kraus, 1999; Schiaffino et al., 2011). The parabolic model 

proposed by Hsu and Evans (1989) has been applied in a number of cases to study  the planform of 

embayed beaches  (e.g. Gonzalez and Medina, 2001; Klein at al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2010; Oliveira 

and Barreiro, 2010).  Other models based on empirical mathematical functions were proposed to 

evaluate beach planform, namely the logaritmic spiral (Krumblein, 1944) and the hyperbolic 

tangent (Moreno and Kraus, 1999). The parabolic model is now the most widely adopted approach 

to evaluating the planform of embayed beaches. This parabolic model has the ability to predict the 

planform resulting from the construction of coastal structures such as breakwaters and ports, and 

also to determine the volume of sand needed for beach adaptation in the case of beach 

nourishment (Gonzalez and Medina, 2001; Hsu et al., 2010; Gonzalez et al., 2010). In addition to 

application in engineering projects, Oliveira and Barreiro (2010) suggest using the parabolic model 

to analyze embayed beach stability by comparing the existing shape with the modeled one. 

Schiaffino et al. (2011) modified the parabolic model proposed by Hsu and Evans (1989) in order to 

make it applicable to gravel beaches.

Embayed beaches are typically affected by the diffraction of waves around a headland. Therefore, 

three different zones are identified i) a curved portion in the zone protected from diffraction 

processes; ii) a slightly curved central portion; and iii) a more rectilinear distal portion (Short and 

Masselink, 1999; Raabe et al., 2010). A embayed beach is considered in static equilibrium when 

the beach shoreline is predicted by the parabolic model. Likewise, the embayed beach is in 

dynamic equilibrium when the predicted curve does not coincide with the actual shape (Hsu et al., 

2008). However, Hsu and Evans (1989) stressed that the parabolic model could only be applied 

under specific conditions and is not suited to analyze every single embayed beach.  One of these 

important conditions is that the beach should be subjected to a predominant wave direction. 

Short and Masselink (1999) argue that despite the evidence of diffraction processes in embayed 

beaches, the parabolic model does not take into account the influence of other elements of the 

coastal environment. There are still various factors that affect planform and beach variability 

besides morphodynamics, corroborating the limitations of the model. The main considerations can 

be summarized as: (a) planform mobility is subject to the fluctuations of the wave climate on 

various time scales, the processes of rotation and oscillation; (b) other processes, besides 

diffraction and geomorphological control, act on the development of embayed shape; and (c) 

there is the difficulty of adjusting the model and determine the diffraction points among multiple 

potential points in the area. Moreover beach profiles, sediment characteristics and wave data are 

needed to support planform interpretations resulting from the model. 

Oliveira and Barreiro (2010) modeled embayed beaches in Portugal using the parabolic model and 

found discrepancies between the actual and modeled plan. Field data indicated that the beaches 

were in dynamic equilibrium, with the significant role of longshore sediment transport due to 

active longshore currents. The model suggested that beaches were in static equilibrium and the 

authors interpreted this result as a plan view caused by recent inversions of wave conditions and

high mobility of the beach. The parabolic model considers a predominant incident wave direction 

and, as a consequence, inversions of wave conditions are not considered by the model.  Changes 

in wave climate, especially in the direction, cause variability of volume and sediment transport in 

embayed beaches between the two limits of the beach arc, a phenomenon known as beach 

rotation (Short and Masselink, 1999; Short et al., 2000). Beach rotation can occur over different 

timescales without changing the sediment balance (Klein et al., 2002). Medium-scale oscillations 

of wave direction and height would be responsible for combining cross-shore and longshore 

hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes (Short et al., 2000; Ranasinghe et al., 2004). 

Cross-shore morphological changes along an entire embayed beach are known as beach oscillation 

(Short and Trembanis, 2004).  The combination of longshore morphological changes with cross-

shore morphological changes drive the combined morphological change in a embayed beach 

(Harley et al., 2011).  

According to Lausman et al. (2010a, 2010b), the parabolic model cannot predict the shape of the 

beaches in dynamic equilibrium, since it does not describe what happened up to the static 

equilibrium. Ranasinghe et al. (2004) proposed a conceptual model for the embayed beaches of 

Australia, where periods of retreat or accretion on the beach were identified under the rotational 

process. The temporal and spatial variability of wave heights act predominantly on the longshore 

and cross-shore transport to the coast. The longshore current generated by waves is responsible 

for different water levels and morphological processes at the embayed beach extremes. The 

numerous disagreements between the actual and predicted beach shapes in plan studies of the 

Brazilian coast were attributed to the lack of information about the submerged portion 

morphology and physical processes, especially in reflective beaches (Klein at al., 2010). Thus, the 

morphodynamic data are believed to help the interpretation and applicability of the modeled 

planform. However, determining the diffraction point used in the parabolic models for beaches in

equilibrium is still not a simple and straightforward task, either due to the difficulty in identifying 

the point among the many potential diffraction points that geomorphologically control the rocky 

shores, or due to the operator subjectivity.  The problem of identifying the right diffraction point 

when shoals are present close to the headlands was discussed by Bowman et al. (2014) for 

beaches of Elba Island in Italy. Klein et al. (2003) argue that successful implementation is achieved 

only when embayed beaches are in dynamic equilibrium, and there is a precise geometrical 

relationship between the parabolic shape and the wave angle. The change in the diffraction and 

control points changes the approach angle of the wave and the modeled plan.  Gonzalez (1995) 

pointed out other limitations when defining the control point, such as the presence of river 

mouths and islands. Jackson and Cooper (2010) choose multiple diffraction points to adjust the 

plan model to the actual configuration of some beaches of Ireland, including more internalized 

secondary diffraction points that receive diffracted waves. Geometric shapes as an ebb tidal delta 

were also considered potential diffraction points. According to these authors, the plan equilibrium 

concept assumes that the wave diffraction is responsible for the shaping process and all other 

processes are disregarded. This assumption is invalid for natural shores. However, the alternative 

and possible interpretation is that secondary diffraction points are not important when the 

predicted and actual coast are in agreement and the angle of the waves used is correct. If the 

coast is unstable, but the predicted and actual plans agree, the coast is subjected to oscillatory and 

rotational patterns that are not considered in the model. Despite the limitations in the use of the 

parabolic model it presents important advantages to the logarithmic spiral model and the 

hyperbolic tangent model. According to Hsu et al. (1987) the logarithmic spiral model should only 

be applied in the zone protected from the diffraction processes. Furthermore the logarithmic 

spiral model is not valid to be used as criterion to verify beach stability (Walton, 1977). Oliveira

and Barreiro (2010) observed that the application of the hyperbolic tangent model is not very 

intuitive and is more complex than the parabolic and the logarithmic spiral model. 

This study applies the parabolic model of Hsu and Evans (1989) to evaluate the planform variability 

in the Meaípe-Maimbá embayed beach (MMEB), located in Espírito Santo, Brazil (Fig. 1). Seasonal 

and decadal wave changes are considered when assessing planform variability. Wave climate data 

of 38 years’ duration are used to identify in the plan, portions of the beach susceptible to 

morphological adaptation. This identification is carried out considering the shape of the beach and 

the characteristics of the diffraction processes. The studied beach is a portion of the coast where 

the crystalline rock outcrops create an extremely indented coastline, with headlands and islands. 

In 1977, a private harbor was built in the 6 km-long beach, dividing it into two separate bay 

beaches. The beach probably changed from static to dynamic equilibrium to adapt to the new port 

structure. Today, more than 40 years from the harbor construction, it is likely to be in new static 

equilibrium with the prevailing incident waves. The presence of headlands, islands and shore 

platforms cause small arches to develop within the main embayment. Therefore, the 

geomorphological characteristics greatly control beach morphology and coastal processes. The 

beach is narrow and limited along its length by active cliffs and urban structures, which are often 

reached by waves, and erosion events are observed. Considering the characteristics and historical 

evolution of MMEB, the main objectives of this study are to discuss and evaluate: (A)  the 

adequacy and contribution of the parabolic model of Hsu and Evans (1989) to determine the 

planform and variability of the Meaípe-Maimbá embayed beach in terms of changes in wave 

climate; (B) the role of different controlling conditions on the variability in planform; (C) the beach 

planform and morphological mobility. In order to achieve these objectives the potential mobility 

of the modeled beach plan, which takes into account the wave direction changes over 38 years, 

was evaluated considering contemporary morphodynamic processes.

2 - The study site 

 

The state of Espírito Santo, in south-eastern Brazil, faces the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 1). The Meaípe-

Maimbá beach is located 70 km south of Victoria, the state capital, in Guarapari and Anchieta 

municipalities. Precambrian crystalline hills and Neogene sedimentary plains alternate along this 

portion of the coastline, forming beaches and discontinuous coastal plains. Shore platforms and 

beach rocks develop small beach arches along the Meaípe-Maimbá beach (Fig. 2A). The narrow 

sandy strip, bounded by sharp cliffs in some portions, is not wide enough to protect urban 

structures and erosion processes are observed in the important coastal route, Highway ES 010 

(Fig. 2C). The beach is 10 km long, bordered to the north and south by the Meaípe and Ubu 

headlands, respectively. In 1977, the construction of a port in the southern portion divided the 

embayment in two distinct embayed beaches, the northern one approximately 7.7 km long. Small 

islands and shore platforms are present in the central portion (Fig. 1).               

The sand composition of this beach is predominantly siliciclastic; however, the contribution of 

heavy minerals can reach up to 45% by weight on the surface level of the beach face in storm 

conditions when the light fraction is more easily removed (Fig. 2b, detail). The heavy fraction 

composition indicates that sediments derived from erosion processes of the sedimentary cliffs and 

weathered material from crystalline headlands are the main source of the beach sediment 

(Coutinho, 1974; Anjos et al., 2006). The contribution of carbonate sands generated by 

incrustations is more relevant in the submerged portion, where organisms such as coralline algae 

and mollusks on the rocky substrate are abundant (CEPEMAR, 2009).

The coastline is predominantly NE-SW oriented and exposed to the Atlantic pressure systems. The 

most intense winds are the E and SE winds, associated with the trade winds and the winds that 

arise from the passage of frontal systems, respectively. Pianca et al. (2010) proposed, based on 

data from the NWW3 (operational model hindcast reanalysis), that waves heights of 1 to 2 m and 

waves periods of 6 to 8 s coming from east are dominant during summer, winter and spring. In the 

fall, SE waves predominate, followed by E waves, with heights between 2 and 3 m and periods 

ranging from 10 to 12 s.  The spring tide range in the region is 1.70 m (DHN, 2012).  

3 - Methods  

Three data sources were used in this study: (a) wave data, (b) topographical and sedimentological 

survey data, and (c) aerial photography and cartographic data. The different methods used to 

collect and treat the data are grouped as follows: 3.1) Waves, 3.2) Morphology and 

sedimentology, 3.3) Longshore sediment transport, 3.4) Shoreline variation and 3.5) Equilibrium 

and variability of beach planform. 

3.1 Wave Data 

Hindcast wave data were obtained for the period between 1970 and 2008 from the Global Ocean 

Wave (GOW) model, which consists of a reanalysis of global waves (Reguero et al., 2012). The time 

series of the various statistical parameters of wave and spectral energy were obtained from the 

GOW, which uses a global mesh with 1.5° longitude and 1.0° latitude and hourly resolution. The 

GOW model has been calibrated and validated globally using instrumental measurements of 21 

buoys and satellite altimetry data extracted from satellite images (Reguero et al., 2012). This study 

uses the results given by GOW model for the 20°50'S and 40°25'W coordinates (30 m depth) 

between 1970 and 2008. The robustness of the GOW model to represent wave conditions near the 

Meaípe-Maimbá beach was analyzed. To this end, the numerical results were compared with sea

wave data obtained in situ with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) at 20°48'S and 

40°33'W (25m depth) during 4 periods in the field campaign: i) 31/01/2007 to 04/04/2007; ii) 

29/09/2007 to 25/10/2007; iii) 23/11/2007 to 18/12/2007; and iv) 23/11/2007 to 6/3/2008. 

Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the parameters, significant wave height (Hs), peak wave period (Tp) 

and mean direction (θ) obtained by GOW and measured in situ for the 4 periods of the field 

campaign. The root mean square error (RMSE) and bias for significant wave height, peak wave 

period and mean wave direction calculated over the 4 periods are given in Table 1. 

  

In general the GOW model results reproduce quite accurately the evolution and magnitude trends 

of the parameters Hs, Tp and θ recorded in situ. However, it is noted that sometimes Tp and θ 

display episodic variations that are not correctly represented in the model. These variations are 

mostly associated with Tp and θ smaller than 6 s and 45°N, respectively, and therefore may be 

related to less energetic waves generated by local winds, not considered by the global model. 

  

Fig. 4 shows the distribution of θ with Hs and Tp simulated by the GOW model, for the 38-year 

period, during which wave directions are mainly from southeast to east (63%) and northeast to 

east (25%). The most common ranges of wave heights are 0.5 to 1.0 m (47%) and 1.0 to 1.5 m 

(42%), while waves 2.0 m high and above have an occurrence probability of 1.5%. For the studied 

wave periods, 76.42% are between 6 and 8 s.

3.2 Morphology and sedimentology   

The morphological field data were obtained in 4 surveys conducted in October 2006, February and 

December 2007 and February 2008, at 6 stations (P1 to P6) along the beach, as shown in Fig. 1. 

The cross-sections started at emerged fixed points (P1 to P6 in Fig. 1) located on the cliffs or on 

the narrow coastal plain and were extended around 400 m to the shoreface.  A surveyor’s Dumpy 

Level and a graduated staff were used in the topographic survey. The bathymetric part of the 

profiles was establish using a vessel equipped with an ODOM Hydrotrac Sounder operated at 200 

kHz (accuracy of 0.01 m ± 0.1% of depth). Positioning was obtained with a DGPS (Differential 

Global Positioning System) with a horizontal accuracy of +/- 0.9 m. The reference level adopted as 

vertical datum for the surveys was 0.82 m, corresponding to the Mean Tide Level at Ponta de Ubu 

Terminal – Espírito Santo State (Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegação, DHN) of the port located in 

the embayment. 

The morphological parameters were determined based on topographic data: (a) berm height, (b) 

beach width (distance between the Mean Water Level (MWL) shoreline and the landward limit of 

the beach, corresponding to the base of the cliff or the base line on the vegetated coastal strand), 

and (c) beach-face slope. The superposition of beach profiles yielded an estimate of beach mobility 

given by the changing sediment volume.  This estimation is made taking into account the beach 

volume above mean water level per linear meter of beach (m
3
/m).   

The sedimentological field data were collected on the surface level of the beach face (in the swash 

zone) in 5 surveys (October 2006, February, April and December 2007 and February 2008) at the 

same locations as the topographic profiles. The sample composition (content of siliciclastics, heavy 

minerals and CaCO3) and particle size were determined. Size and distribution of sand fractions 

were determined  by dry sieve analysis in 1/2 phi intervals.  The sediment grain size classification

proposed by Folk (1964) was estimated using the software GRADISTAT version 4.0 (Blott and Pye, 

2001). Carbonate content was determined by dissolution with hydrochloric acid. Heavy minerals 

were separated from light minerals by density separation using bromoform (density = 2.86 g/cc). 

The contents of carbonate and heavy mineral fractions were obtained by the difference between 

the initial and final sample weights analyzed.    

 

3.3 Longshore Sediment Transport 

The longshore sediment transport was calculated for a central beach profile using the CERC (1984) 

equation. This method is based on the assumption that the sediment transport is directly 

proportional to the longshore component of the wave energy flux, determined at wave breaking 

point. In the CERC equation, the value Ql  (in m
3
/s) expresses the sediment transport rate by a 

wave of significant height, Hb, at the breaking point:

where  ρs  is sediment density; ρ is sea water density; n is sediment porosity; αb is the angle 

between the crests of the waves breaking and the shore; K is an empirical proportionality 

coefficient; and g is acceleration due to gravity. 

The value of K was calculated according to the equation proposed by Mil-Homens et al. (2013). 

These authors used a field and laboratory database (a total of 247 sampling points) to analyze K 

trends with respect to a large number of parameters and found that the best fit for K is obtained 

by the polynomial function:

where, L0 is the deep water wave length. Propagation based on linear wave theory was used in this 

study to propagate 30 m-deep waves to the onshore breaking point. This method accounts for 

shoaling and refraction, and is based on Snell's law, the wave energy conservation principle and 

the assumption that waves propagate on a constant sloping bathymetry parallel to the shoreline. 

The depth-induced wave breaking criteria H/h = 0.78 (McCowan, 1894) is used to identify the

3.4 Shoreline variation 

The shoreline evolution was determined by superimposing the shorelines extracted from aerial 

photographs from 1970 and 2008. The 1970 scanned coastline, 1:35000 scale, was provided by the 

Instituto de Defesa Agropecuária e Florestal do Espirito Santo (IDAF-ES). The geo-referenced aerial 

photo of 2008, scale 1:8000 was courtesy of the Instituto Estadual de Meio Ambiente (IEMA-ES). 

Both photos have a georeferencing precision of 1 m. The 2008 coastline photo was scanned and 

overlapped with the 1970 photo using the GIS software package Arcgis 9.3® to datum WSG 84, 

scale 1:3000. The DSAS 4.0 (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) software was used to calculate 

shoreline variation using 39 cross-sections along the beach, separated by 200 m from each other. 

The location of the shoreline was defined based on the previous high tide high water level (Boak 

and Turner, 2005). As a basic approximation, considering a 1:8 reflective slope with 1.7 m tide 

range, we can assume a lateral error of about 6.8 m on the shoreline detection.

3.5 Equilibrium and variability of beach planform 

In polar coordinates, the parabolic bay equation developed by Hsu and Evans (1989) is given by: 
 

𝑅

𝑅0
= 𝐶0 + 𝐶1  

𝛽

𝜃
 + 𝐶2  

𝛽

𝜃
 
2

 

 

(3) 

where R is the length between the control point (diffraction point) and any point on the bay 

periphery, 𝑅0 is the control line length (where the linear zone of the shoreline starts), 𝛽 is the 

wave obliquity, 𝐶0, 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 are coefficients defined empirically depending on 𝛽. In this work the 

application of the parabolic equation was performed using the software MEPBAY (Klein et al., 

2003). 

According to Hsu and Evans (1989) and Hsu et al. (2008), certain conditions must be met for 

successful implementation of the parabolic model and its suitability in equilibrium assessment, 

namely: (a) the beach should be predominantly composed of sand, (b) the beach should be 

subjected to a predominant wave direction; (c) the beach must be submitted to micro-tidal 

regime; (d) there must be a headland that represents the diffraction point; (e) cross-shore 

sediment transported during storm events, forming bars, must return to the beach face under fair 

weather conditions; (f) the wave incidence angle should produce a longshore current and be 

associated with prevailing waves; and (g) the resultant of the annual longshore sediment transport 

is higher than the resultant from storm sediment transport. 

Hsu et al. (2008) interpret and classify the results of the comparison between the actual and 

modeled shape as follows: 

• If the embayed beach shoreline is predicted by the parabolic equation, the beach is considered 

in static equilibrium. The straight outer portion is parallel to the wave crests approaching the

shore. To meet this requirement, it is assumed that no sediment is added or eroded from the 

embayed beach in the future; wave conditions are maintained and persistent; waves break 

simultaneously along the beach and longshore drift is almost nonexistent. 

• If the predicted shoreline is located landward in relation to the actual shoreline, the beach 

section is considered to be in dynamic equilibrium and is susceptible to erosion resulting from 

changing available sediment or wave climate. Furthermore, the beach is classified as "natural 

beach reshaping" when in the shadow area, protected by a headland or engineering structure, the 

shoreline progrades and is more exposed to erosion. The eroded sediments are carried by the 

longshore drift up to the protected portion. The parabolic model requires that the diffraction 

points and control point be chosen on a plan over an aerial photograph (Klein et al., 2003). 

Based on the aerial photo of 2008 (scale 1:8000) and the wave climate between 1970 and 2008, 

the planform equilibrium was evaluated for two conditions. Firstly, the planform was evaluated 

considering the average wave direction between 1970 and 2008 as a predominant wave direction. 

In this study, we refer to this average wave condition as ‘representative wave’.   Secondly, the 

planform was evaluated considering a wave direction that is obtained based on the assumption 

that the beach from the aerial photo of 2008 is in static equilibrium. In other words, a 

geomorphological wave fitting to the parabolic model is done. Hereinafter, we term this wave 

condition as ‘geomorphological wave’.  

The Meaípe-Maimbá beach has distinct diffraction points to the north and south ends. To the 

south, the diffraction point is represented by the breakwater head of the port. To the north, it is 

represented by headlands and crystalline islands. In this case all the potential diffraction points 

were taken into account in order to evaluate the embayment planform. The inner island in the 

north part of the beach was considered as a secondary diffraction point.

Potential oscillations of the beach planform induced by changes in the incident wave angle were 

analyzed. The mobility of the beach was determined by introducing the variation of the annual 

averaged wave direction between 1970 and 2008 in the model.  

 

4 Results 

 

4.1 Beach Mobility  

4.1.1 Variation of the shoreline in recent years 

From 1970 to 2008, the comparison between the shoreline plans from transects 34 to 39 (Fig. 5) 

showed an average progradation of 121.89 m in the southern portion of the beach. This totals an 

increase of 122,000 m
2
 in area in the last 38 years, which corresponds to a rate of 3200 m

2
/year. 

An average retreat of 15 m is observed along the northern and central portion of the beach 

between transects 1 and 33. In the northern portion of the beach (between transects 1 and 13) 

the shoreline was more stable, with an average 13 m shoreline retreat. The central portion 

(between transects 14 and 33) presents retreat values that range from 17 to 28 m. The total 

erosion in the northern and center portions is 99,000 m
2
 in area, which corresponds to a rate of 

2600 m
2
/year. The long-term balance of the beach is positive with a progradation rate of 600 

m
2
/year. 

Assuming that the Meaípe-Maimbá beach is a closed system, the small difference between retreat 

and accretion can be explained partially by the area of progradation being a plain beach. By 

contrast, vertical variation in the cliffs portion of the beach is considered to have occurred without 

significant horizontal variation. These discrepancies between accretion and retreat were observed

by Lausman et al. (2010b) for other Brazilian beaches. The erosion processes that increase the 

sediments eroded from the cliff and transported across the beach may explain the difference 

observed. 

The port, built in 1977, became a barrier to the longshore transport of the sand. This barrier is 

responsible for the largest width of the south beach, and the vegetated and stable coastal plain 

recently developed between the cliffs and the active beach. The north-central beach is directly 

backed by the cliffs (Fig. 2) and narrow coastal plains are observed among the small arches.  

The beach has shown little mobility and changes in the plan are most noticeable in the long term. 

It is likely that the morphological adaptation was faster and more intense in the early years, soon 

after the port construction. Thus, it is assumed that the beach has experienced lower mobility in 

recent years. 

 

  4.1.2 The modeled shape and plan mobility 

Table 2 presents the results for the annual longshore sediment transport (Equation 1) and K values 

(Equation 2) obtained for 2008 as a reference year. Results indicate a residual transport of 396,754 

m
3
/year, directed southwards.  

The direction of the representative wave, responsible for the beach planform during the 38 year 

period, is 113°N (i.e. ESE). The wave climate was considered stable, with a small fluctuation of ± 4° 

in the annual mean direction (Fig. 6). This small fluctuation in wave direction strengthens the 

resultant from the sediment transport from north to south (Table 2). Moreover an increase in the 

incident wave energy from 1996 onwards (Fig. 6) suggests an increase in capacity to mobilize 

sediments.

Considering the morphology and degree of exposure to incident waves, Maimbá beach can be 

divided into three sectors, (a) the curved northern sector subjected to wave diffraction processes 

around the headlands and island; (b) the straighter central sector exposed to the incident waves 

and limited by the cliffs; and, (c) the curved southern sector controlled by the wave diffraction 

processes around the port. The central sector also indicates the geomorphological control 

imposed by the presence of eroded cliffs. Furthermore, the parabolic model indicated wave 

diffraction process in the northern and southern sectors, with final control in the central sector 

(Fig. 7). 

In the northern sector, assuming a geomorphological wave condition, we observe that the 

modeled planform agrees with the actual shore, indicating geomorphological fitting (Fig. 7, black 

line). The results showed that the overall configuration is controlled by the direction of the waves 

diffracted by the main headland. However, small arches are produced by the processes resulting 

from secondary features, such as sandstones and minor headlands, while the island plays a major 

role. Therefore two diffraction points were taken into account in order to predict the shoreline 

plan. They are the main headland and the inner island in the north part of the beach. Fitting 

parameters that solve the parabolic bay model for Meaípe-Maimbá Beach are summarized in 

Table 3.  The modeled shape by adopting a geomorphological wave indicates that the northern 

sector responds appropriately to the parabolic model and the beach is in static equilibrium.  

On the other hand, the shoreline modeled using the direction of the representative wave 

diffracted around the main headland fits very poorly the actual shoreline. The offset between the 

two angles is 17° south, indicating the necessary geomorphological fitting when no final control 

point allows us to fit a parabolic shape. This is replaced by another process, such as the transport 

of sediments along the coast (Fig. 7). Considering that the beach planform is in static equilibrium,

variations in incident wave direction can induce sediment transport redistribution and 

modifications in the planform.  

The application of the model was repeated adding to the geomorphological wave direction the 

variation of ± 4° found in the annual mean direction. Fig. 7 shows the potential oscillations of the 

beach planform induced by changing the wave angle. The innermost shoreline is associated with 

the wave displacement angle to the NE, thus generating increased sediment transport 

southwards. In this condition, the beach would be in dynamic equilibrium. On the other hand, the 

outer shoreline would be produced by increasing the wave angle from the SE, decreasing sediment 

transport to the S and resulting in a natural reshaping beach. A maximum plan mobility 

displacement of 141 m was obtained due to variations on wave direction.  

The planform of the southern sector (see Fig. 8), whose wave diffraction point is the breakwater 

head of the port built in 1977, revealed that this portion of the beach is in static equilibrium with 

respect to representative waves in almost the entire length of the beach arc. However the 

shoreline is landward of the modeled shoreline in the southern extreme of the beach arc. In order 

to understand this difference, the presence of a secondary diffraction point provided by the ship 

berth jetty was tested in the model. No good fit was obtained considering this secondary 

diffraction point.  The difference between modeled and observed shoreline can be attributed to 

local variations on morphodynamics processes induced by harbor dredging activities.  

The application of the model was repeated in the southern sector adding to the representative 

wave direction the variation of ± 4° (Fig. 8b). Results indicate a maximum plan mobility 

displacement of 99 m in the south sector. This result indicates that the maximum plan mobility 

displacement is smaller in the southern sector than in the northern sector of the beach.

4.2 Beach morphology and sedimentology   

4.2.1 Beach profiles 

The mean values of the morphological parameters for the beach profiles are summarized in Table 

4. Results indicate that the emerged width beach ranged from 23.56 m to 38.36 m between  

October 2006 and February 2008, in P1 and P5 profiles, respectively. The height of the berm crest 

ranged from 1.44 to 4.10 m above MWL, with a maximum in P5. The emerged profiles are narrow 

and steep due to these characteristics. The beach becomes wider, with higher berm crest height 

and higher gradient of the beach face southwards, from profiles P1 and P2 in the north to P5 and 

P6 in the south. 

Beach mobility in the medium term is represented by the variations observed between October 

2006 and February 2008 (Fig. 9). The surveys were conducted under easterly wave conditions, 

with low mobilization and transport competence. Accumulated wave energy in the last 30 days  

preceding each survey showed that in October 2006 the wave energy were above monthly 

average accumulated wave energy  in 2006 (Table 5). The higher offset from the yearly average 

wave direction was recorded in the survey performed in December 2007, with waves from 96ºN 

prior to the survey.  Higher wave energy variations observed between October 2006 and February 

2007 reflected a significant morphological adaptation. Lower wave energy variations, observed 

from December 2007 to February 2008, induced more stable profiles despite the possibly 

sediment transport to the bay due to cross-shore transport promoted by the easterly waves (Fig. 

9).

Major morphological changes were observed between October 2006 and February 2008 in profiles 

P1, P2, P3 and P6. These profiles are more dynamic since they aggregate processes associated with 

beach curvature and longshore drift.  Around P4, where the sediment transported by the 

longshore drift moves either southwards or northwards, the cross-shore transport controls the 

morphology. There is also significant mobility of the nearshore bars.  

 

4.2.2 Sedimentology 

Sediment characteristics along each of the beach profiles are summarized in Table 6 and Fig. 10. 

The beach sediments consist mainly of siliciclastic sands and heavy minerals. The contribution of 

carbonate sands is less than 1% of total weigh. According to the median grain size diameter (D50), 

the sediment is classified as medium sand, moderate to well sorted and presenting a symmetric 

distribution along the beach. An exception was a negative asymmetry obtained in sands of P1. The 

highest contribution of coarse sands is present in P4, P5 and P6. 

The heavy mineral contents are higher in the north-central portion of the beach, in the beach face. 

The levels decrease as the sand becomes coarser to the south. The high levels of heavy minerals 

can be explained by the proximity to the source area, represented by crystalline headlands and 

sediments eroded from the sedimentary cliffs, as the higher concentration of heavy minerals is 

found in the proximity of such features.  

The sedimentological data combined with morphological characterization allows us to classify the 

beach type as reflective according to Wright and Short (1984). In this case, the beach is composed 

of medium and coarse sands, narrow cross-sections and high profile gradients.

5. Discussion  

 

5.1 Adequacy of the plan model and beach mobility  

The Meaípe-Maimbá embayed beach presents itself as a closed cell, where over the last 4 decades 

the port structure interrupted the longshore sediment transport from the northern and central 

portion of the beach towards the southern extremity. On a decadal scale, the beach is nowadays 

in equilibrium with the incident waves, and current mobility is small. Three morphodynamic 

sectors were recognized based on mobility (Fig. 11). 

The northern and southern sectors are influenced by the wave diffraction processes around the 

headlands and exhibit the greatest mobility, especially in the curves and near the headlands. As 

the beach curvature diminishes, the volume and width changes of the beach profiles are more 

homogeneous, as shown by Klein et al. (2002) in other beaches. In the central sector the beach 

becomes more stable and the cross-shore transport more active. 

The parabolic model was used to determine the mobility potential of beach northern and southern 

sections when facing small fluctuations in the wave direction (between -4° and +4°), on a decadal 

scale. But the procedures for applying the model and the responses were different for the two 

extremes.  

With only one potential diffraction point and using the representative wave on a decadal scale, the 

beach planform of the south beach sector was in static equilibrium. The mobility represented by 

volume fluctuations of the profiles (ΔV in Fig. 11) agrees with the decadal and modeled changes. 

Plan mobility displacement and profile variations were higher at the beach extremes while in the 

central portion and both scales, these fluctuations were smaller (Fig. 11).

In the southern sector, maximum plan mobility is 99 m. Regarding the current shoreline, the 

displacement would be higher in the case of shoreline retreat, promoted by a higher proportion of 

E and SE waves (a variation of +4° in wave direction) that transport sediments by longshore drift to 

the north. Under this condition, the waves would reach the coastal plain, feeding into the active 

coastal system the sediments deposited during the last 38 years. With the increase of NE waves, 

the modeled shoreline becomes closer to the present shoreline. Stability, observed also in the 

contemporary morphodynamic behaviour, would be associated with mobilization of sediment 

available along the active profiles. 

The sediment transported by the longshore drift since the construction of the port was sufficient 

for the morphological adaptation of the beach arc in the south sector. The consideration of the 

wave direction changes in the model reflected the probable short-term morphological variation 

and this is, likely, in agreement with profiles’ mobility.  The morphological response would be 

stability or, if there were no sediment available, shoreline retreat. 

Shoreline retreat of the northern sector would be higher under increasing NE waves (a variation of 

-4° in wave direction). The real magnitude of the erosion process depends on sediment availability 

and the existence of obstacles that limit free morphological evolution. Currently, this section is 

characterized by a narrow beach and limited by urbanization often exposed to wave action. The 

medium term sediment balance is negative (ΔV total in Fig. 11).

5.2 Beach planform and morphological mobility  

The historical development shows that the southern sector of the embayed beach is in gradual 

accretion and the northern sector in progressive retreat. This can be explained by the potential 

longshore sediment transport of 400,000 m
3
 per year, of which 95% is southwards. The longshore 

sediment transport is also responsible for the spatial distribution of the heavy mineral contents 

due to a selective removal of the hydraulically most susceptible grain sizes (Rao, 1957; Komar and 

Clemens, 1986; Li and Komar, 1992, among others). When the profile is subjected to erosive 

processes, the heavy sediment fraction tends to remain as a residual deposit (Frihy and Komar, 

1993; Frihy and Dewindar, 2003). In the study area heavy mineral content is extremely variable, 

with highest concentrations in the northern half of the beach arc (Table 6).  Mean grain size trend, 

with the finest mean grain size and negative skewness at P1, increases in mean size from P1 to P6 

(Table 6), contrary to the expected pattern due to the grain size selective longshore transport 

related to the wave incidence. This increase occurs inside the same grain size classification and 

seems related both to an overpassing of coarser and lighter grain sizes over smaller heavier ones 

(Orford et al. 1991; Isla, 1993; Horn & Walton, 2007), as also an increase in wave exposure due to 

the configuration of the beach arc - resulting in an continuous increase in beachface declivity, 

increase in beach berm high (Table 4), and also in a better grain size selection toward the southern 

extremity of the beach.

The different geomorphological sectors of the beach and the potential energy of the waves allow 

considering the combined oscillating-rotating processes acting along the beach, as suggested by 

Ranasinghe et al. (2004). In Meaípe-Maimbá beach rotation mechanisms are suggested by the 

inverse behavior of volume fluctuations for the profiles (ΔV in Fig. 11) in the extremes of the 

embayment. In the central beach, cross-shore processes predominate, which is reflected by the 

profiles’ mobility and grain size variation. 

Despite the dominant longshore transport southwards, historical evolution analysis indicated that 

the northern sector is in slow progressive retreat.  Seasonal sediment transport causes oscillation 

and rotation of the beach morphology and retards the decadal historical trend, provided that the 

wave variations remain. Thus, the modeled displacement would not be achieved. According to the 

modeled planform, the southern beach is susceptible to retreat with increasing SE waves (a 

variation of +4° in wave direction). Field monitoring data indicate that the beach is in equilibrium 

with the sediment amount present on the beach and coastal plain. Very likely over time, the beach 

will not attain dynamic equilibrium classification provided that sediment amount remains or even 

increases. Modeled results show that an increase in the frequency of NE waves leads to an 

increase in the potential plan mobility in the northern sector. Additionally, measured beach 

profiles indicate high mobility in the north sector. This sector still does not have sufficient 

sediment for future adaptations. The sandy beach is narrow and bordered by either active cliffs or 

urban structures.  The cliffs can be potential sediment sources, but causing loss of area for 

urbanization (Fig. 2). The reclassification of the beach in dynamic equilibrium due to changes in 

the amount of sediment and/or wave variation is observed in the northern sector. However, 

modeled displacements can be overestimated due to the fact that the model doesn't take into 

account medium term processes and some geomorphological features.

Depending on the duration of the analyzed period, the intensity of coastal processes can be 

fundamental in explaining the final planform. In other words, the time required for wave changes 

can be shorter than that required for planform adaptation. But it is likely that the beach dynamics 

respond quickly to medium-term changes, as seen for the Meaipe-Maimbá beach and the 

Portuguese beaches studied by Oliveira & Barreiro (2010), where there was disagreement with the 

current wave dynamics. 

 

5.3 The geomorphological control on the implementation of the plan model and beach mobility  

Different factors limit the application of the planform beach model (Hsu and Evans, 1989). Among 

these factors, two were identified in the northern section of Meaipe-Maimba beach: (i) other 

processes, besides diffraction and geomorphological control, act on the development of embayed 

shape and (ii) difficulty of adjusting the model and determine the single diffraction point among 

potential points. Assuming that the representative wave is correct, the planform is inadequate in 

the northern sector (Fig 7a), since secondary processes produce uncertainty in the application, as 

proposed by Gonzalez (1995). In the southern sector, the beach is in static equilibrium with 

respect to the representative wave in almost the entire length of the beach arc.  

According to Klein et al. (2003), the parabolic model is successful only for beaches in static 

equilibrium. Considering, on the one hand, that the Meaipe-Maimba beach plan is in equilibrium 

in the aerial photo and, on the other, the existence of two diffraction points (the main headland 

and the inner island), it was found that the modeled planforms fit the current shoreline. A similar 

approach was used by Jackson and Copper et al. (2010) to model the planform of natural beaches 

in Northern Ireland. Fitting the modeled planform to the current configuration exposes the 

method to subjectivity (e.g. Lausman et al., 2010 a, 2010 b; Klein at al. 2010). However, this

procedure was satisfactory used in the assessment of potential planform mobility in this study.  

Decadal shoreline evolution combined with beach profiles and sand sedimentary data improved 

the current understanding of MMEB morphodynamic behavior. Moreover the available data 

supported the interpretation of modeling results. The need for beach profiles and sedimentary 

data to analyze the model plan was previously pointed by Short and Masselink (1993).  

  

6. Conclusion 

 

There is consensus regarding the existence of a large number of conceptual issues that may 

interfere with the parabolic model when compared to existing shoreline, among these, the ability 

of the beach to adjust to changes in wave energy and direction. The absence of dynamic variables 

such as currents, sedimentology and shoreface morphology limits its application. 

In this study, the parabolic model was applied to evaluate the mobility potential of the Meaípe-

Maimbá embayed beach due to wave changes over a period of 38 years, considering that the 

beach is in static equilibrium. Information about shoreline evolution trend and seasonal profile 

variability was fundamental for the successful interpretation of the results. However, the 

displacement modeled by the parabolic model did not show the magnitude and intensity of 

erosive behavior along the beach. The pace of the adjustment depends on sediment availability 

and, especially, on short-term sediment transport processes.

Local geomorphological control acts on the resulting beach planform, since it limits sediment 

transport along the beach and influences local wave dynamics. It is not a simple task to identify 

the diffraction and control points among the potential ones and achieve, by modeling, the 

resulting planform of the beach in equilibrium. Nevertheless, assuming that the beach is in static 

equilibrium under the condition of incident waves, the mobility can be modeled in terms of 

changes over time and this application may be considered a useful tool in coastal management.
