Abstract 

 16 

Cross- and along-shelf winds drive cross-shelf transport that promotes 

the exchange of tracers and nutrients to the open sea. The shelf response 18 

to cross-shelf winds is studied in the north shelf of the Ebro Delta 

(Mediterranean Sea), where those winds are prevalent and intense. 20 

Offshore winds in the region exhibit strong intensities (wind stress larger 

than 0.8 Pa) during winter and fall. The monthly average flow observed in 22 

a one-year current meter record at 43.5 m was polarized following the 

isobaths with the along-shelf variability being larger than the cross-shelf. 24 

Prevalent southwestward along-shelf flow was induced by the 3-

dimensional regional response to cross-shelf winds and the coastal 26 

constraint. Seaward near-surface velocities occurred predominantly 

during offshore wind events. During intense wind periods, the surface 28 

cross-shelf water transport exceeded the net along-shelf transport. During 

typically stratified seasons, the intense cross-shelf winds resulted in a 30 

well-defined two-layer flow and were more effective at driving offshore 

transport than during unstratified conditions. While transfer coefficients 32 

between wind and currents were generally around 1%, higher cross-shelf 

transfer coefficients were observed in the near-inertial band. The regional 34 

extent of the resulting upwelling during energetic cross-shelf winds 

events, estimated using surface temperature, was concentrated around 36 

the region of the wind jet. Cross-shelf transport due to along-shelf winds 

was only effective during northeast wind events. During along-shelf wind 38 

conditions, the transport was estimated to be between 10% and 50% of 

the theoretical Ekman transport.   40

1. INTRODUCTION 42 

In recent years, cross-shelf wind-driven circulation has been the focus of 

extensive research. Modeling [Tilburg, 2003; Horwitz and Lentz, 2014] and 44 

observational [Lentz, 2001; Fewings et al., 2008; Dzwonkowski et al., 2011; 

Horwitz and Lentz, 2014] studies have shown that cross-shelf wind stress can 46 

result in cross-shelf flow in areas where the surface and bottom boundary layers 

overlap (i.e., inner-shelf). In most cases, the cross-shelf wind term of the 48 

momentum balance equation is smaller than the Coriolis term [Lentz and 

Fewings, 2012] and is relatively unimportant over the mid- and outer-shelf 50 

[Fewings et al., 2008]. In these regions, the cross-shelf circulation tends to be 

dominated by along-shelf winds generating upwelling/downwelling flow [Crépon 52 

et al., 1984; Lentz, 1992; Lentz, 2001; Keubel Cervantes et al., 2003; 

Dzwonkowski et al., 2011] consistent with early theoretical considerations 54 

[Ekman, 1905]. [Horwitz and Lentz, 2014] explained that in shallower areas  

wind momentum is able to mix the entire water column faster than the time-56 

scale of the rotation influence resulting in a reduced effect of the along-shelf 

wind stress to drive cross-shelf transport [Ekman, 1905; Lentz and Fewings, 58 

2012]. Thus, the cross-shelf pressure gradient (or sea-level slope in the depth-

averaged momentum balance) due to cross-shelf winds are balanced by wind 60 

stress in the region onshore of where the surface boundary layer extends to the 

bottom [Lentz and Fewings, 2012].      62 

 

Several studies have shown that cross-shelf wind stress drives substantial 64 

cross-shelf flow in a 3-dimensional sense while being modified by local 

circulation. Liu and Weisberg [2005] found that cross-shelf wind stress plays an 66 



4 
 

important role in driving cross-shelf currents in the shallower areas of the West 

Florida shelf (less than 15 m water depth). Cudaback et al., [2005] found 68 

temporal and spatial variability of the wind-current correlations in the mid/inner-

shelf near Point Conception (California, USA). In that region, the spatial 70 

gradient of wind stress influences the circulation in Santa Barbara Channel 

[Winant et al., 2003]. Schaeffer et al. [2011] showed that 3D circulation resulted 72 

in along-shelf flow divergence driving substantial transport in the cross-shelf 

direction and increasing the spatial complexity of the flow. 74 

 

Our study area is Sant Jordi Bay, located in the northwestern Mediterranean 76 

Sea in the southern Catalan shelf as part of the North Ebro (or Ebre) Shelf 

(NES). Regional wind analysis reveals strong and persistent cross-shelf winds 78 

over the NES. A wind atlas (published by the Spanish Ministry of Energy; 

www.mineturb.gov.es) showed strong persistent winds (annual mean in excess 80 

of 7 m/s, ~0.07 Pa) and some spatial variability in the NES (Figure 1.c). A 

channelization effect associated with the Ebro Valley triggers northeasterly 82 

winds (called Mestral) resulting in a wind-jet approximately 20 km wide (Figure 

1.b).  84 

 

To compare the relative importance of the cross-shelf winds at several sites 86 

along the U.S. East Coast in the depth-averaged cross-shelf momentum 

balance, Fewings et al. [2008] defined the ratio R: the size of the cross-shelf 88 

winds relative to the Coriolis term. The ratio R (computed as R=(τxs)/(ρofhvda), 

where τxs represents cross-shelf wind stress, ρo is water density, f is the Coriolis 90 

parameter, h is the water depth and vda is depth-averaged along-shelf current) 



5 
 

at the NES suggests that the cross-shelf wind stress was an important term in 92 

the momentum balance when vda is weak. The ratio R estimated from a 

complete one-year record at 43.5 meters bottom depth in the NES was R=0.42. 94 

The ratio in the U.S. East Coast for similar depths (35-55m) ranged from 0.08 to 

0.25 [Fewings et al., 2008]. Meanwhile, results near the Martha’s Vineyard 96 

Coastal Observatory (MA, US) at 12 m depth yield a ratio around 0.6. If only the 

period when the cross-shelf winds are relatively persistent in the NES region, 98 

the resulting R factor is larger than 0.5 (R=0.54 for December 2011). These 

large R-values confirm the importance of the cross-shelf winds in the 100 

momentum balance in the NES even at depths of several tens of meters.  

 102 

The objective of the present contribution is to characterize the shelf response to 

prevalent intense cross-shelf winds. We analyze whether the cross-shelf winds 104 

were dynamically important at driving cross-shelf flow in the NES when 

compared to the effect of along-shelf winds. In the results section, a seasonal 106 

description of winds in the NES is provided using a set of events that cover 

cross-shelf winds during both typically stratified and unstratified condition. The 108 

set of energetic events is chosen to examine the cross-shelf circulation through 

the assessment of cross-shelf surface transport. The wind and ocean-current 110 

relations are investigated through a spectral approach with the squared 

coherence and the transfer coefficients (section 3.3). We estimate the Ekman 112 

cross-shelf circulation induced by along-shelf winds in section 3.4. The 

discussion highlights the cross-shelf circulation response between typically 114 

stratified and unstratified conditions and the resulting surface cold temperature 



6 
 

signals. Also, we analyze the response at different temporal scales highlighting 116 

the role of the along-shelf flow to drive cross-shelf circulation.  

2. STUDY AREA AND OBSERVATIONS  118 

2.1 North Ebro Shelf 

Sant Jordi Bay and the surrounding NES are located near the south margin of 120 

the Catalan/Balearic Sea (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea).  The Ebro River 

Delta is located immediately to the south of the NES and the average annual 122 

river discharge ranges from 300 to 600 m3/s. NES is defined as the area 

confined by the Ebro Delta to the south and Salou Cape to the North (Figure 1). 124 

The curvature of the Bay shelters it from southerly waves. The continental shelf 

in this region corresponds to the north margin of the Ebro Shelf and is relatively 126 

wide (approximately 60 km) in comparison to the Catalan shelf to the north 

[Grifoll et al., 2012].  128 

 

Previous studies based on long-term wind measurements in the proximity of the 130 

region showed that winds have a persistent seasonal pattern [Font, 1990]. 

During winter and fall, a dominant northwesterly component caused by wind 132 

channelization was observed. During these times, the energy is concentrated in 

the low frequencies associated with synoptic scales (periods of 2-5 days that 134 

correspond with the passage of weather systems). The warmer period (spring 

and summer) is characterized by high variability with a dominance of 136 

southwesterly winds. During spring and summer, the relative contribution of the 

daily components (breezes) to the variability increases [Font, 1990; Cerralbo et 138 

al., 2015]. The warmer seasons are less energetic than the cold seasons. 



7 
 

 140 

Studies of the Ebro river region have focused primarily on the shelf dynamics of 

the south margin [Puig et al., 2001; Palanques et al., 2002; Rippeth et al., 2002; 142 

Salat et al., 2002; Jordà, 2005; Bastida et al., 2012]. Observational results 

[Jordà, 2005] revealed that the inner and mid shelf dynamics are characterized 144 

by a strong influence of the frictional component of the flow. The flow in the 

outer part of the shelf and the slope is dominated by inertial fluctuations [Salat 146 

et al., 2002; Jordà, 2005; Rippeth et al., 2002].  

 148 

Stratification also contributes to the seasonal variability in inner and mid-shelf 

dynamics. The presence of a strong pycnocline during summer, between 10 150 

and 20 m depth in the Ebro shelf [Jordà, 2005; Bastida et al., 2012], decouples 

the processes between surface and deep layers [Jordà et al., 2005; Grifoll et al., 152 

2013].  Additionally, Durand et al. [2002] and Mestres et al. [2003] showed that 

the effects of the river plume are important only near the river mouth (order of 154 

10 km offshore from the river mouth). From their observations and numerical 

results, the NES is relatively far from the influence of the river. 156 

2.2 Observations and methods 

As part of large effort to collect physical data for development strategies of 158 

offshore wind energy in the NES, a buoy was moored 3.1 km from the coast at 

43.5 meters bottom depth to measure wind, waves, and water currents. Wind 160 

speed and direction was measured at 4 m height every 10 minutes using an 

Ultrasonic Wind Sensor (Gill Instruments) during one year (November 2011 to 162 

November 2012). The measurements at 4 m height are adapted to standard 10 

m height using a logarithmic profile adjustment [Oke, 1987]. Water currents 164 



8 
 

were measured with a Sontek Acoustic Doppler Profiler at 500 kHz every hour 

using 20 vertical layers (layer depth was 2 m). The blanking distance was of the 166 

order of 1 m at the surface and 1.5 at the bottom. Wind intensity and direction 

were converted to wind stress using the Large and Pond [1981] formulation. For 168 

the analysis, we used unfiltered wind and current time series; except for the 

surface cross-shelf flow estimations where we used filtered data with a 24-hour 170 

cutoff to remove high-frequency fluctuations. 

 172 

Empirical Orthogonal Functions estimated for the along and cross-shelf current 

directions from the entire vertical profile were used to identify the modal 174 

variability. Estimates for two temporal scales are provided: selected cross-shelf 

wind events (lasting a few days) and monthly scales. The monthly EOFs 176 

consider the relation between the modal description and the wind direction 

prevalence and the multi-layer structure in the water column.   178 

Remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) was used to assess a regional 

characterization of the upwelling extent. The Group for High-Resolution Sea 180 

Surface Temperature (GHRSST, www.ghrsst.org) provides new generation 

global high-resolution SST products [Martin et al., 2012]. The chosen product 182 

(http://ourocean.jpl.nasa.gov/SST) is available from the Jet Propulsion 

Laboratory Regional Ocean Modeling System group (JPL-ROMS). Their 184 

product includes daily global gap-free SST with spatial resolutions of around 1 

km (ultra-high resolution) and input SST data sets derived from the GHRSST 186 

Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP). Additionally, climatological fields from World Ocean 

Atlas 2013 (WOA13; www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13; Locarnini et al. [2013]; 188 



9 
 

Zweng et al., [2013] were used to complement information about water column 

ocean conditions.   190 

3. RESULTS 

3.1 Wind description and wind event selection 192 

This section statistically characterizes the wind data and several energetic 

cross-shelf wind events. Wind data (Figure 2) were consistent with the 194 

described seasonal pattern of the region. The percentage of Northeasterly 

(fourth quadrant; Mestral) winds during the period November 2011 - November 196 

2012 (Figure 2.a) revealed its prevalence during fall and winter (the maximum 

percentage, 92%, occurred during December). Mestral periods exhibited the 198 

largest wind intensity. These peaks reached speeds larger than 15 m/s (~0.4 

Pa) during fall and winter. Even during summer, Mestral intensities were larger 200 

than the maximum intensities from other wind directions (Figure 2.b). Mestral 

events were persistent lasting for periods of up to several weeks with large 202 

fluctuations in intensity (e.g., January 2011).  

 204 

The energy spectrum of the unfiltered rotated (following the coastal alignment) 

along-shelf and cross-shelf wind components (Figure 3.a) revealed an energetic 206 

band at low frequencies (periods over 2 days) and a peak associated with sea 

breeze (period of 1 day), especially in the along-shelf direction. The sea-breeze 208 

is quite important in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea [Font, 1990; Grifoll et 

al., 2012; Cerralbo et al., 2015] providing a large fraction of the wind energy 210 

outside of storm events. Meanwhile, the wind energy at near-inertial frequencies 

is small in both directions. The cross-shelf spectrum exhibited larger energy at 212 



10 
 

most frequencies than the along-shelf consistent with the prevalent cross-shelf 

wind in the region.  214 

 

Figure 4a and 5a show time series of computed along-shelf and cross-shelf 216 

wind stresses using filtered time series. Specific instances were selected to 

study the cross-shelf wind events (NW; purple boxes) covering different 218 

seasons. The stress during the events selected exceeded 0.5 Pa in the cross-

shelf direction. Additionally, northeasterly wind events (NE) were observed a 220 

few times during the study period and the wind intensities were substantially 

lower than Mestral (cross-shelf) wind events (green boxes in Figures 4.a and 222 

5.a). The characteristics of the selected events were summarized in Table 1. 

3.2 Annual and monthly water circulation conditions  224 

First, we characterize the annual mean flow using the spectra in both cross-

shelf and along-shelf directions. The monthly conditions are calculated to 226 

investigate the relation between the seasonal flow behavior and the seasonal 

winds. Analysis of the unfiltered time series of observed velocity was performed 228 

using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results identified that the water 

flow was polarized in the along-shelf direction. The angle of the PCA for depth-230 

averaged current was similar to the coastline orientation (~26º). The major axis 

accounted for 91% of the annual variability and the mean flow in the direction of 232 

the major axis was - 0.025 m/s. The axis direction convention (positive north-

eastward and offshore) is shown in Figure 1. As the depth-averaged cross-shelf 234 

flow ( ) was limited by the coastal constrain, the energy contained in that 

component at low frequencies was 2-5 times smaller than the depth-averaged 236 



11 
 

along-shelf flow ( ̅; Figure 3.b), while the fluctuations were of the same order for 

periods smaller than a day.  238 

The surface cross-shelf flow was estimated from the observations during the 

entire record. The cross-shelf flow averaged over the surface layer ( ) was 240 

found by integrating from surface to the first-zero crossing of the observed 

profile (Equation 1) as an approximation to boundary layer thickness [Lentz, et 242 

al., 2001]: 

,   (1) 

where z is the depth, δS is the water depth of the first zero velocity crossing and 244 

u is the cross-shelf flow. The depth-averaged cross-shelf flow ( ) was removed 

from the observations to isolate the depth-dependent cross-shelf circulation 246 

[Lentz, 2001; Kirincich et al., 2005].   

The surface cross-shelf flow was also used for spectral considerations following 248 

Equation 1. Variance preserving spectral analysis of the depth-averaged along-

shelf and cross-shelf flow (Figure 3.b) revealed an energetic band at low 250 

frequencies associated with synoptic fluctuations lasting 3-12 days in the 

northwestern Mediterranean Sea [Font et al., 1990]. The along-shelf flow 252 

contained less energy than the surface cross-shelf flow as expected from 

frictional effects. A peak at the diurnal frequency was evident in the depth-254 

averaged along-shelf and cross-shelf directions. Energy in the near-inertial 

band, which dominated in observations over the mid-shelf and slope [Rippeth et 256 

al., 2002; Jordà, 2005], was not significant in the along-shelf due to the 

prevalence of the frictional terms [Lentz and Fewings, 2012]. The near-inertial 258 

band contained a large fraction of the total energy of the surface cross-shelf 

flow with values exceeding the diurnal (sea-breeze effect) frequency. 260 



12 
 

 

Monthly mean velocity and standard deviations were estimated for three 262 

characteristic layers (5 m, sub-surface; 17 m, mid-depth; and 32 m, near-

bottom) in the along-shelf and cross-shelf directions (Figure 6.a and 6.b). Along-264 

shelf velocities exhibited a prevalent southwestward flow with common 

reversals as highlighted by the large standard deviations. Along-shelf standard 266 

deviation was roughly twice the cross-shelf standard deviation. The cross-shelf 

standard deviation in the upper layer was largest during spring and minimum 268 

during winter. Winter also exhibited the smallest along-shelf current in the 

surface and mid-water column layers, while the largest along-shelf current was 270 

observed in late summer (August and September). As the cross-shelf mean 

flow from the three layers was smaller than the standard deviation, we consider 272 

that the coastal constraint reasonable holds at monthly scales. This result 

differs from shorter time-scales where the vertically averaged cross-shelf 274 

velocity may be significant (standard deviation equals to 0.02 m/s with peaks of 

0.1 m/s) which means that the flow alignment is less important and 3-276 

dimensional effects may be relevant.        

 278 

Figure 6.c shows the monthly variance explained by the first vertical mode, 

obtained from an Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis, in the cross- 280 

and along-shelf direction.  In the cross-shelf component, during winter 

(November through February) the first mode exhibited a single-layer, likely 282 

barotropic, vertical structure; while during the rest of the months, the vertical 

structure showed reversals (multi-layer modal structure, likely associated with 284 

baroclinic flow). As concurrent density and flow data were not available, the 



13 
 

separation between baroclinic and barotropic fluctuations could not be 286 

achieved, but we expect single-layer flow to be associated with barotropic 

conditions and multi-layer flow to be present during baroclinic conditions. In 288 

contrast, the along-shelf modes of variability followed a single-layer structure 

during the entire year. In both components, a seasonal cycle was observed with 290 

the importance of the first mode being larger during winter and smaller during 

summer.    292 

3.3. Time-lagged correlation, coherence and transfer function 

Time-lagged correlations between cross-shelf water transport and cross-self 294 

wind (Figure 7) showed significant peaks in correlation at zero lag (10% 

explained variance) and with lags near the inertial frequency (6% explained 296 

variance). In contrast, the lagged correlations for the along-shelf winds were 

smaller even for zero-lag and exhibited a peak at around 6-7 hours lag (less 298 

than 1% explained variance).   

    300 

To quantify the relation between local wind and water flow, we calculated the 

squared coherence and transfer function between wind velocity components 302 

and along-shelf and surface cross-shelf flow. The coherence squared (Figure 

8.a) showed significant values for all components except between along-shelf 304 

wind and cross-shelf flow. The along-shelf flow exhibited high coherence (larger 

than 0.4) with both along-shelf and cross-shelf winds at the diurnal frequency. 306 

The cross-shelf wind was coherent (values above 0.3) with the surface cross-

shelf flow at large periods (more than 3 days) and also at near-inertial 308 

frequencies. Meanwhile, the coherence between cross-shelf wind and cross-

shelf flow was significant at diurnal band and near-inertial frequencies.  310 



14 
 

 

The transfer coefficients (Figure 8.b) between winds and surface cross-shelf 312 

and along-shelf flow were small but consistent with estimates of energy transfer 

between wind and ocean currents [Weber, 1983; Loder and Greenberg, 1986; 314 

Jenkins, 1987]. The transfer coefficients between both wind components and 

along-shelf flow were fairly constant for most of the spectrum outside of low 316 

frequencies with values ranging between 1.5% (2-3 day periods for the along-

shelf wind) and below 0.25% in the semi-diurnal band (inertial periods for the 318 

cross-shelf wind). Large transfer coefficients (over 1%) were obtained between 

the cross-shelf wind and the surface cross-shelf flow at near-inertial 320 

frequencies. The large transfer coefficients between along-shelf wind and 

surface cross-shelf flow at frequencies between inertial and semi-diurnal might 322 

not be meaningful as the uncertainty associated with the estimates is much 

larger for non-significant coherence [Bendat and Piersol, 1986]. 324 

 

3.4. Water transport during selected events. 326 

The surface cross-shelf transport ( ) was assessed from the 

surface Ekman depth (Figure 4.b and 5.b) as an estimation of the cross-shelf 328 

circulation. The time series were band-pass filtered between 1 and 10 days to 

remove large amplitude unresolved seasonal trends, maximizing the effective 330 

degrees of freedom [Kirincich et al., 2005]. Mestral events (NW1-NW9, Table 1) 

exhibited increased surface offshore cross-shelf transport. Three events 332 

exceeded 1 m2/s surface water transport (more than 0.2 m/s velocity): NW5, 

NW6 and NW8. These events occurred during spring (NW5 and NW6) and fall 334 

(NW8). The NW5 and NW8 events did not correspond to maximum 



15 
 

northwesterly wind intensities, which occurred during NW1, NW6 and NW9 336 

(more than 0.8 Pa). Also, long duration cross-shelf wind periods (for instance, 

the persistent cross-shelf wind during December 2011 - January 2012) did not 338 

result in maximum surface cross-shelf transport (two-month average surface 

flow transport was 0.1 m2·s-1).   340 

 

Cross-shelf flow can be, and usually is, induced by along-shelf winds. Many 342 

studies have observed upwelling/downwelling cross-shore flow in the inner and 

mid-shelf associated with along-shelf winds [Allen et al., 1996; Lentz, 2001; 344 

Kirincich et al., 2005; Gutièrrez et al., 2006]. In this case, the along-shelf 

momentum equation integrated between the surface and the surface boundary 346 

layer thickness (δS) can provide information of the relevance of the transfer of 

momentum between directions. Neglecting the non-linear terms, the resulting 348 

equation is:     

  (2) 

where v is the along-shelf flow, P is the pressure, f is the Coriolis frequency and 350 

Uδs is the cross-shelf transport between the surface and - δS, т
sy is the along-

shelf component of wind stress and тδy is the stress at the boundary layer 352 

thickness depth (δS). Alternatively, when we assume no pressure gradient or 

bottom friction, the along-shelf momentum equation reduces to the theoretical 354 

Ekman transport US equation:  

 
(3) 

The theoretical Ekman transport can be compared with the observed cross-356 

shelf transport estimated from the cross-shelf velocity profiles during NE (along-



16 
 

shelf) wind events. Figure 4.c and 5.c showed the time series of cross-shelf 358 

Ekman transport for the selected NE events (green boxes). In shallow waters, 

where the Ekman transport is not fully developed [Lentz et al., 2001], the 360 

relationship can be further approximated using linear regression: 

 
(4) 

 where a, the slope, defines the fraction of full Ekman transport present. In 362 

general, during the period of analysis, onshore surface transport pulses were 

associated with northeasterly winds. Thus, a qualitative relation between the 364 

pulses of the theoretical Ekman transport and the surface cross-shelf transport 

during the NE events was observed. The Ekman transport fraction (slope of 366 

Equation 4) ranges from 16% during NE2 to 58% during NE4 (Table 1).    

4. DISCUSSION 368 

4.1. Cross-shelf flow during cross-shelf winds and stratification effects 

Cross-shelf circulation in the inner-shelf during cross-shelf winds is 370 

characterized by a downwind transport in the upper part of the boundary layer 

[Tilburg, 2003; Lentz and Fewings, 2012]. The downwind transport is 372 

proportional to the Ekman transport in deep water (VE) decreasing onshore 

when the boundary layers overlap (i.e. inner-shelf): 374 

0.4
h

 
(5) 

The surface boundary layer may be estimated by Weatherly and Martin [1978]: 

1.3 ∗
 

(6) 

where u* = (τsx/ρ)0.5 and N  is the buoyancy frequency. Considering 376 

characteristic conditions of intense cross-shelf wind over the NES (stress τsx = 



17 
 

0.7 Pa) and using an approximation to N (0.005 s-1; [Grifoll et al., 2012]), the 378 

surface boundary layer thickness was equal to 49 m confirming the inner-shelf 

nature of the observation location during intense cross-shelf winds. The surface 380 

cross-shelf transport estimated following equation (5), with the surface 

thickness provided by equation (6), was equals to 2.5 m2·s-1. The value was 382 

close to observed values during some events (for instance, transport during 

NW6 was 1.8 m2·s-1), supporting the circulation model in the inner-shelf based 384 

on Ekman transport and the surface boundary layer.   

The ADCP observations provided evidence of the relation between intense 386 

cross-shelf winds and cross-shelf transport (Figures 4 and 5) with the maximum 

surface cross-shelf transport occurring during NW5 and NW6 events. A 388 

comparison of the vertical structure of the observed flow during two of the 

largest Mestral events (NW6 and NW9) (Figure 9) showed substantial 390 

differences. The NW6 event (20-24 May 2012) was characterized by a well-

defined two-layer flow in the cross-shelf direction during peak wind intensities. 392 

Flow reversals occurred between 20 and 25 meters, at similar depths to the 

thermocline from previous observational studies in the region [Jordà 2005; 394 

Bastida et al., 2012]. The offshore flow in the upper water column was 

compensated by a return flow in the lower water column. The intensity of the 396 

compensating flow was related to the magnitude of the upper water column 

offshore flow and also to the cross-shelf wind intensity. Furthermore, when 398 

Mestral winds were particularly intense (22 May 2012; NW6), the two-layer flow 

was reduced as most of the water column was flowing offshore. During this 400 

event the along-shelf circulation exhibited a complex behavior with flow 

reversals in depth. The along-shelf flow seems to be consistent with a pressure 402 



18 
 

gradient being established in the early part of the storm that relaxed after the 

peak and resulted in a reversal of the flow.  404 

 

The NW9 event (28-30 November 2012) was characterized by a shift between 406 

two-layer and one-layer flow in the cross-shelf direction (Figure 9.b). During 29 

November, onshore flow was observed in the deeper part of the water column 408 

and transitioned to offshore flow in the entire water column during the cross-

shelf wind intensity peak. After the wind peak, the cross-shelf circulation 410 

returned to a two-layer flow likely associated with a relaxation of the pressure 

gradient (sea level set-down during storm). Thus, the cross-shelf flow exhibited 412 

two distinct regimes in the vertical during Mestral events: a two-layer flow 

predominantly during spring; and a regime shift during fall and winter between 414 

one-layer (peak) and two-layer flow. The intensification of two-layer flow during 

warmer months (NW6 and NW7 events) highlighted the seasonal pattern in the 416 

cross-shelf response.  

 418 

Observational studies in the Ebro delta shelf [Jordà 2005; Salat et al., 2002; 

Bastida et al., 2012] have suggested enhanced stratification by increased spring 420 

and summer heat fluxes. Not far from our study site, Grifoll et al. [2013] found 

large seasonal variability in the buoyancy frequency in front of Barcelona and a 422 

relationship between the annual cycle of hydrographic conditions and the 

atmospheric variability (wind and net heat flux). The average seasonal 424 

temperature, salinity and density profiles from the ¼ degree WOA in the NES 

(Figure 10) exhibited strong summer temperature stratification and well-mixed 426 

winter conditions. Unfortunately, hydrographic measurements in the NES were 



19 
 

not available during the period of study, but the characteristics of the first mode 428 

of variability in the along-shelf velocity tend to be associated with stratification 

intensity [Winant and Bratkovich, 1981; Grifoll et al., 2012].  430 

 

When the percentage of the first mode was large and associated with single-432 

layer flow, the water column tended to be weakly stratified or unstratified. The 

EOF modes and the percentages of the total variance explained by the firsts 3 434 

modes were calculated for the selected events (Table 2). In the along-shelf 

direction, the first mode contained a majority of the total variance (larger than 436 

70%). The vertical distribution of the first eigenvector was predominantly depth-

independent and likely associated with barotropic fluctuations. The second 438 

mode was associated with 2-layer flow fluctuations and exhibited a large 

magnitude only during NW8 event. In the cross-shelf direction, the EOF 440 

revealed sizeable differences among Mestral events. For the events occurring 

during cold months (NW1, NW2, NW3, NW4, and NW9), the dominant mode 442 

was still single-layer and represented up to 64% of the flow variability. During 

these events, the next largest eigenvector was related to 2-layer flow and the 444 

percentage of variability explained was around 25%. In contrast, the events 

occurring during spring and fall (NW5, NW6, NW7 and NW8) revealed modal 446 

structures influenced by multi-layer (likely baroclinic) fluctuations. Except for 

NW7, the first mode was associated with 2-layer flow with up to 55% of flow 448 

variability. During NW7, the first single-layer mode was relatively small (59%) 

and the second and third modes (both multi-layer) accounted for 32% of the 450 

variability. In consequence, stratification tends to develop multi-layer, likely 

baroclinic, modal structure with bottom and surface currents flowing in opposite 452 



20 
 

directions. The event-based EOF analysis agrees with the monthly EOF 

analysis (Figure 6.c) where the along and cross-shelf variability explained by 454 

the first mode decrease during spring and summer. 

 456 

The vertical stratification enabled the wind stress to create a larger transport 

near the surface because the effective water depth was shallower due to the 458 

suppression of vertical momentum transfer [Nakayama et al., 2014]. 

Observations in the inner-shelf showed that, when there is stratification, the 460 

vertical mixing is inhibited and this allows larger vertical shear and larger cross-

shelf transport [Horwitz and Lentz, 2014]. Fewings et al., [2008] noticed an 462 

increased surface transport observed at 12 m during the summer due to cross-

shelf winds south of Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts, USA). In the NES, a 464 

similar behavior was observed with comparable wind stresses than NW6 (for 

instance NW1 or NW9) producing more cross-shelf transport under likely 466 

stratified conditions. Additionally, partially stratified conditions during April 2012 

(NW5; Figure 9) showed larger surface cross-shelf transport than most 468 

energetic wind events (e.g., NW1, NW4) during winter (unstratified conditions). 

In contrast, numerical experiments by Tilburg [2003] suggested that the cross-470 

shelf transport driven by cross-shelf winds decreased for stratification 

conditions. Also an observational study by Dzwonkowski et al., [2011] found 472 

that as stratification increases, the cross-shelf winds become less important in 

comparison to low stratification conditions. Considering the differences between 474 

our results and the mentioned papers, the diversity and complexity of the 

processes involved in the cross-shelf response to cross-shelf winds under 476 



21 
 

typically stratified conditions is evident and will benefit for simultaneous 

stratification and velocity information.  478 

 

Depth-averaged cross-shelf velocity is not constrained to be zero because the 480 

circulation is not along-shelf uniform [Tilburg and Garvine, 2003; Kirincich and 

Barth, 2008; Lentz and Fewings, 2012]. 3D circulation may generate 482 

divergences in the along-shelf flows driving substantial cross-shelf transport and 

increasing the spatial complexity of the flow [Lentz and Fewings, 2012]. 484 

Recently, Horwitz and Lentz [2014] stated that the cross-shelf density gradient 

rather than the vertical density gradient is critical for the estimation of the cross-486 

shelf transport driven by cross-shelf winds. Cross-shelf density gradients are 

expected in NES according to measurements obtained in the Ebro shelf [Salat 488 

et al., 2002; Bastida et al., 2012] adding a level of complexity in the shelf 

response to offshore winds. The one-layer response (likely barotropic) observed 490 

during unstratified conditions in the NES can be the result of a complex 

tridimensional circulation implying a regional response to cross-shelf winds. 492 

 

The presence of a strong thermocline in the NES was likely during NW6 494 

according to long-term hydrographic measurements in the region [Jordà, 2005; 

Bastida et al., 2013] and the average WOA conditions (Figure 10). 496 

Theoretically, the two-layer flow observed during offshore wind events could 

lead to a surface expression of colder water upwelled from deeper layers or 498 

locally mixed. As expected, relatively cold sea surface temperature was 

observed  during NW6. Figure 11 shows SST for a non-event day (15 May 500 

2013) and the NW6 event sequence (21-24 May 2013). The cold water 



22 
 

signature in SST was consistent with the two-layer flow observed in the velocity 502 

measurements. The characteristics and extent of the cold water changed during 

the cross-shelf wind event. We provide an estimate of the cold water region 504 

extent by calculating the surface area with temperatures lower than 18ºC 

(Figure 11). The maximum area of cold water (over 2000 km2) occurred during 506 

May 23 (two days after the start of the event and when the wind intensity had 

started to decrease). After the peak, the cold water extent decreased in size 508 

until returning to the normal conditions two days after the end of the intense 

wind event. Seaward winds during winter (e.g., MW9) may result in cold waters, 510 

but SST did not show gradient in water signature due to the diminished thermal 

vertical gradient (not shown). Csanady [1977] concluded from observations in 512 

Lake Ontario that offshore winds alone rarely produce upwelling and tend to be 

short lived in comparison to along-shelf wind upwelling. Similar cooling events 514 

induced by vertical mixing due to cross-shelf winds have been reported in the 

Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico [Trasviña et al., 1995; Barton et al., 2009; 516 

Velazquez-Muñoz et al., 2011]. The cold water in the NES due to cross-shelf 

winds deserves further investigation to discern between local mixing or 518 

upwelling processes and it will likely require both observational and numerical 

efforts.        520 

4.2. Influence of cross-shelf wind at different temporal scales  

Wind observations have revealed prevalent cross-shelf winds in the NES. 522 

However, monthly standard deviations showed that the variability in the along-

shelf circulation was larger than in the cross-shelf direction by a factor of 2 524 

(Figure 6.a). The variability at monthly-scales was consistent with the flow being 

polarized following the isobaths due to the coastal constraint. This circulation 526 



23 
 

pattern is characteristic of inner and mid-shelves where the Ekman depths 

(surface and deep) cover a large portion of the total water depth [Lentz and 528 

Fewings, 2012]. As a consequence, the frictional terms of the momentum 

balance tend to be larger than the geostrophic term. In the southern margin of 530 

the Ebro shelf (near the NES), the flow alignment has been reported at depths 

around 60 m [Puig et al., 2001; Palanques et al., 2002]. In contrast, north of the 532 

Ebro shelf  (in front of the city of Barcelona), the ratio between along-shelf and 

cross-shelf standard deviations for similar depths was 3-4 [Grifoll et al., 2013] in 534 

an area where the cross-shelf winds are substantially less intense.  

 536 

Several strong cross-shelf wind episodes showed a qualitative relation between 

increased cross-shelf winds and southwestward along-shelf flow (e.g. NW5, 538 

NW7 or NW9), but a direct relation was not observed during other episodes 

(e.g. NW4, NW6). Moreover, the prevalent NW wind months (during autumn 540 

and winter) did not correspond with a significant increase of the along-shelf flow 

(Figure 6.a). Additionally, the transfer function (Figure 8) did not show a strong 542 

link between along-shelf flow and local cross-shelf winds. Thus, the along-shelf 

flow seems to be a response to horizontal pressure gradients established by 544 

cross-shelf winds rather than an Ekman response to local wind. The complex 

hydrodynamic response seems associated to the spatial variability of the wind 546 

(i.e. wind-jet) and the complex geometry of the shelf (Ebro Delta to the south 

and narrowing shelf to the north). 548 

 

The coherence between wind and current at low frequencies (periods of more 550 

than 3 days) were consistent with previous estimates in other environments 



24 
 

[Lewis and Reid, 1985; Wong and DiLorenzo, 1988; Wong and Moses-Hall, 552 

1998]. The enhanced coherence at diurnal and near-inertial frequencies has not 

been previously reported, as past studies focused in low frequency fluctuations.  554 

 

The transfer function revealed significant exchange between cross-shelf winds 556 

and surface cross-shelf transport in the near-inertial band. According to the 

spectral analysis (Figure 3) of the cross-shelf velocities and winds, the energy in 558 

the near-inertial band was relatively small compared to low frequencies. The 

larger transfer coefficients and relevant lagged correlations (Figure 7) between 560 

cross-shelf wind and surface flow in the near-inertial band are related to 

relatively short time response (time lags near zero hours) due to limited water 562 

depth. Near-inertial motions were found in the region but in deeper areas than 

NES [Font, 1990, Salat et al., 1992; Rippeth et al., 2002]. In our case, during 564 

the initial phases of a wind event, the along-shelf velocity component responds 

gradually to wind stress on a time scale equal to the inertial period (~18h time 566 

lag), while the cross-shelf velocity responds almost immediately (zero time lag) 

[McNider and O’Brien, 1973; Cushman-Roisin et al., 1983]. The energy from the 568 

wind at near-inertial frequencies is rapidly transferred to the water column 

without major opposing forces (compensating frictional forces require longer 570 

times to be completely established) resulting in flow acceleration (e.g., Figure 

9). In our case, the effectiveness of the cross-shelf wind in accelerating surface 572 

water flow was even higher as compensating pressure gradients to oppose the 

flow were difficult to be established.  574 

 



25 
 

On the other hand, the wind energy at synoptic frequencies is partly transferred 576 

to the water column, but some of the energy goes into wind set-up or set-down 

that compensates the momentum added by the wind stress. In this case, the 578 

frictional forces have enough time to be established (the frictional time, tf, was  

around 24 hours and was estimated as   considering a linear drag 580 

coefficient of 5 x 10-4 m·s-1; [Winant and Beardsley, 1979]). The result is that the 

transfer of energy between wind stress and water flow is not as efficient as in 582 

the near-inertial band and both times-series are not as correlated at scales of 2-

5 days. While the sea-level adjustment of the wind is relatively fast, the frictional 584 

response dominates after the initial hours of a wind pulse. The oscillations in 

sea level, the bottom friction and the non-linear terms balance the flow 586 

acceleration caused by the wind and decrease the direct relationship between 

wind stress and water flow resulting in reduced transfer coefficients at longer 588 

time scales.  

 590 

The small transfer coefficients for the along-shelf flow confirm that the along-

shelf fluctuations were influenced by other processes like the regional sea-level 592 

response (e.g., barotropic pressure gradient) to cross-shelf winds instead of a 

direct Ekman response. The strong influence of the spatial wind variability due 594 

to orographic effects (i.e., wind-jet) would explain the complex sea-level 

response. The along-shelf and cross-shelf low-frequency transfer coefficients 596 

were consistent with estimates of energy transfer between wind and ocean 

currents (3.1-3.4%, Weber [1983]; around 1%, Loder and Greenberg [1986]; 598 

2.2-2.8%, Jenkins [1987]).  

4.3. Cross-shelf transport due to along-shelf winds 600 



26 
 

Cross-shelf flow is commonly associated with along-shelf winds as a result of 

upwelling/downwelling dynamics [Allen et al., 1995; Lentz, 2001; Austin and 602 

Lentz, 2002; Kirincich et al., 2005; Gutièrrez et al., 2006]. In the NES, the 

observations revealed that the theoretical Ekman transport during northeast 604 

events was small in comparison to the cross-shelf circulation due to Mestral 

events. Comparing NE and NW wind events, the maximum cross-shelf transport 606 

estimated from the observations during cross-shelf winds (1.80 m2·s-1) was 

three times larger than the maximum cross-shelf transport due to along-shelf 608 

winds (- 0.68 m2·s-1; Table 1).  While the maximum correlation between the wind 

stress and transport parallel to it was present at near-zero time lag, the 610 

maximum correlation between wind and transport perpendicular to it (along-

shelf wind) was observed at a longer time lag (6-7 hours). 612 

 

The observed surface cross-shelf flow during NE events revealed that only a 614 

portion of the theoretical Ekman transport was driven by along-shelf winds 

(between 0.16 to 0.58). This is due to the coastal effects [Gill, 1982] where, in 616 

very shallow waters, the surface stress is transmitted directly to the bottom 

[Lentz and Fewings, 2012]. The fraction of Ekman transport observed in the 618 

NES agrees with conceptual models where the cross-shelf transport tends to 

increase with increasing water depth [Lentz and Fewings, 2012]. For instance, 620 

our results (43.5 m at ~3 km from shore) were similar to observations from the 

Oregon shelf [Kirincich et al., 2005] where the full Ekman transport occurs 5-6 622 

km offshore at 50 m bottom depth. However, further observations or numerical 

simulations are required to confirm the water depth where the full Ekman 624 

transport is established over the NES. The investigation of the portion of the 



27 
 

Ekman transport due to along-shelf winds as a function of temporal wind 626 

variability and intensity would benefit from extended observational time-series 

that were not available for the present study. 628 

 

5. SUMMARY 630 

Our investigation shows that intense cross-shelf winds drive offshore transport 

in the surface layers at 43.5 m. The analysis of wind observations over the NES 632 

showed a prevailing intense cross-shelf wind. The currents at 43.5 m bottom 

depth exhibited a flow polarization with the along-shelf variability being larger 634 

than the cross-shelf at monthly scales. Prevalent southwestward along-shelf 

transport was associated with the regional response to the cross-shelf winds 636 

instead of Ekman transport. During the periods of intense wind, the cross-shelf 

water transport can be larger than the along-shelf transport. During typically 638 

stratified periods, the cross-shelf winds were more effective at driving offshore 

water transport by establishing a well-defined two-layered flow. In this case, the 640 

SST revealed an extensive upwelling region during intense cross-shelf winds. 

Spectral analysis shows a strong response to the offshore wind at near inertial 642 

frequencies. Cross-shelf transport due to along-shelf winds was effective only 

during NE wind events. During NE wind periods, measured transport was 644 

between 10% and 50% of the full Ekman transport. The results showing that the 

cross-shelf winds can be more dynamically important than the along-shelf winds 646 

even in water depths > 40m could drive future investigations in the region and 

other inner-shelf regions where strong offshore winds are present. In addition, 648 

there is a motivation for future studies of the complex three-dimensional 

dynamics associated with offshore winds pulses that are not yet fully 650 



28 
 

understood, particularly over the inner-shelf. Our results clarify the role of cross-

shelf winds in driving flow over relatively shallow areas of the continental shelf.  652
