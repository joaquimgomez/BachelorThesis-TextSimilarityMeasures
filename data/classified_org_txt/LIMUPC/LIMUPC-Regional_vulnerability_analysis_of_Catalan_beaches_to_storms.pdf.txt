Abstract 

 

A framework to estimate coastal vulnerability to storm impacts at a regional scale is 

presented. It assesses the physical coastal vulnerability to storm impacts by separately 

estimating two components: flooding and erosion. It covers the following steps: (i) 

characterization of the forcing, (ii) evaluation of the induced beach response – inundation and 

erosion – (hazards quantification), (iii) coastal zone characterization, (iv) definition of a 

coastal vulnerability index to storms – a composite of two partial vulnerability estimations, 

the flood vulnerability and the erosion vulnerability indices-, and (v) assessment of the coastal 

vulnerability. Instead of assessing the vulnerability associated with a given storm, the forcing 

is defined in terms of representative storms which are obtained by classifying storms in the 

area using a 5-class system similar to that used for hurricanes (weak, moderate, significant, 

severe and extreme). Later, a vulnerability assessment for the entire coast to each storm 

category is produced. The method has been derived for and applied to the Catalan coast (NW 

Mediterranean) but can be easily adapted to other coasts. It permits managers to identify

coastal stretches sensitive to a given storm class for a given induced hazard (flooding, erosion 

or combination of both) to decide where to take actions.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

The impact of storms in coastal areas induces a series of impulsive morphodynamic 

responses or hazards, especially important in sedimentary environments such as beach and 

dune erosion, overwash and/or inundation of low-lying areas. When this happens in 

developed / urbanized areas, they are usually accompanied by damages to infrastructures 

and/or affectation of coastal uses and resources. This means to move from coastal hazards to 

harms and, bearing in mind their potential consequences, one of the usual (and important) 

needs of coastal managers should be to know the potential of a coastal stretch to be harmed by 

such processes. Thus, in the recently signed Protocol1 on ICZM in the Mediterranean by the 

EU and the Mediterranean countries there is a specific chapter on Natural Hazards (chapter 

22) where the Parties are advised to undertake vulnerability and hazard assessments of coastal 

zones and take prevention, mitigation and adaptation measures to address the effects of 

natural disasters. 

In this context, we adopt the recommendation of the FLOODsite project to define 

(coastal) vulnerability as the potential of a (coastal) system to be harmed2. Its assessment 

should let coastal managers to anticipate potential damages along the coast to a given agent 

and this has originated numerous approaches from different standpoints, objectives, processes 

and scales (see McFadden et al3). Here we address the topic considering a single source of 



 5

coastal hazards, the assessment of coastal vulnerability to the impact of storms. Moreover, as 

a first step only the physical (geomorphic) vulnerability is examined. Even restricting the 

analysis to a single process –storms-, to a single component of the coastal system –

geomorphic- and to a single country - the Spanish coast - different approaches can be 

found4,5,6. 

The main objective of this paper is to present a methodology to estimate the coastal 

vulnerability to storm impacts at a regional scale to be applied in the Spanish Mediterranean 

coast. Due to the typical geomorphology of the Mediterranean Spanish coast and taking into 

account the spatial distribution of main coastal uses and, that most of storm-induced damages 

in natural coasts occur in beaches, the methodology is mainly designed to be applied to 

beaches. In any case, it can be integrated in a broader coastal vulnerability assessment 

framework where other processes and environments could be easily included. 

The developed methodology is schematised in Fig. 1 and it consists of a five-steps 

procedure: (i) characterization of the forcing in the study area; (ii) evaluation of the induced 

beach response – inundation and erosion – (hazards quantification), (iii) coastal zone 

characterization – a GIS database comprising data on all the beaches along the Catalan coast 

has been created-, (iv) definition of a coastal vulnerability index to storms – a composite of 

two partial vulnerability estimations, the flood vulnerability and the erosion vulnerability 

indices-, and (v) assessment of the coastal vulnerability. This paper presents the overall 

developed methodology and it highlights some results obtained after applying it to the Catalan 

coast (Fig. 2). 

Although this work has been done for the Catalan coast, the proposed methodology is 

general enough to be applied / adapted to other coastal areas. Moreover, due to the 

representative characteristics of the study area in terms of waves and coastal morphology, it is 



 6

also expected that the framework can be directly applied to most of NW Mediterranean 

coasts. 

 

 

2. Area of study 

 

The Catalan coast is located in the NE Spanish Mediterranean (Fig. 2). It is about 700 

km long and it comprises a large variety of coastal types such as cliffs, large bays, pocket 

beaches and long straight beaches and deltas. It supports a large variety of coastal uses and 

resources resulting in a coastal zone comprising high natural value areas to highly developed 

ones. 

Data used to characterize storms were obtained from records of a network of existing 

wave buoys and tidal gauges along the Catalan coast (Fig. 2). For the purposes of this 

analysis, data registered by a Datawell waverider directional buoy located in Cap Tortosa 

(Ebro delta) in the southern part of the Catalan coast (Fig 2) at a depth of 50 m and at 

approximately 8 km off the coastline were used. This buoy was selected because it has the 

longest directional wave record in the Catalan coast and it has been operating since June 1990 

until present.  

Mean water level variations during each storm were obtained from tidal records 

registered by a tide gauge located in the Barcelona Harbor (Fig. 2). The data consisted of a 

time series of hourly tide levels registered since 1992. 

In addition to this data, a 40-year hindcast time series of wave and sea level along the 

Catalan coast, obtained within the Hipocas project7 has also been used to characterise the 

spatial variations in storm characteristics along the coast and to assess their long-term 

variation. 



 7

To characterize the range of existing beaches along the Catalan coast two main 

representative types have been selected, i.e. reflective and dissipative beach profiles. The 

reflective profile is composed by coarse sand (d50 ≥ 0.6 mm) with a relatively high berm and a 

steep slope (tan β ≥ 0.1), being representative of areas such as Costa Brava (Northern coast) 

and Maresme (central coast along Barcelona). The dissipative profile is composed by fine 

sand (d50 ~ 0.20-0.25 mm), with a low berm and very mild slopes (tan β ~ 0.01 - 0.02). These 

beaches are frequent in the Costa Daurada (Southern coast at Tarragona) and the Ebro delta. 

 

 

3. Storm characterization 

 

The first step in the developed methodology is to define the forcing or source of 

considered hazards, i.e. the storm. Taking into account that this is a first approach to regional 

analysis, we have decided to group storms into classes comprising events of similar 

characteristics instead of analysing individual storms. Thus, if a wave forecasting system 

predicts a storm with given wave height and period, instead of assessing the vulnerability 

associated with those specific conditions, we identify which is the corresponding storm 

category for which the assessment should be already available.  

To this end and to maintain an analogy with existing extreme events 

classifications8,9,10 a 5-class scale was adopted: I - weak, II - moderate, III - significant, IV - 

severe, V - extreme. This was done through three steps: (i) storm definition, (ii) selection of 

the storm characterization parameter and (3) selection of classification method.  

A wave storm can be simply defined as an event where the wave height exceeds a 

given threshold during a certain time period. Due to the objective of the analysis, this 

threshold was selected in such a way that events exceeding its value will induce a significant 



 8

coastal response (erosion and inundation). According to previous analysis on beach profile 

response to storms in the area11, a storm is here defined as an event where the wave height 

(Hs) exceeds a threshold value of 2 m during a minimum duration of 6 hours. This minimum 

duration was imposed to assure that the storm had time enough to induce processes of interest.  

As the objective of the classification was to characterize induced impacts on the coast, 

the selected classification variable to represent this property was the storm “energy content”, 

E, which was also used by Dolan and Davis10 and which was defined as  

∫=
2

1

2
t

t

dtHsE            (1) 

where t1 and t2 delimited the duration of the storm, τ.  

Once storms were characterized through their energy content, they were classified by 

means of cluster analysis and supervised classification. In this work, the average linkage 

method was used. The final result was a 5 category classification defined taking into account 

the obtained dendrogram partition, the cluster consistency and the energy content variation 

within each group.  

Resulting class-averaged values of Hs, Tp and duration, τ, for each storm type are 

presented in Fig. 3 and Table 1. As it can be seen, when storm classes are defined with mean 

values of Hs and τ they present a strong linear relationship, with a monotonous increase in the 

magnitude of both variables as storm energy (and category) increases. With respect to wave 

periods, they are very similar for lower storm classes (I to III) reaching values of Tp up to 8 s 

whereas the most energetic classes –IV and V- present longer periods (up to 11 s). In terms of 

energy content, the averaged content increases three times from class-I to class-II and, from 

this level, the energy content approximately doubles in each pass from one category to the 

upper one.  



 9

Due to the coastal configuration the E-NE direction has associated a very long fetch 

and it also corresponds to the direction of strongest onshore blowing winds in the area. As a 

result of this, E-NE wave storms are the most energetic ones and they are also the most 

frequent (60 %) comprising all the recorded IV and V storms. S storms have only a 15 % of 

occurrence and although they are of lower intensity they are responsible of significant 

shoreline rotations in bayed beaches12. Full details on the classification process and resulting 

storm classes can be seen in Mendoza and Jiménez13. 

 

 

4. Coastal hazards  

 

The impact of storms in the coastal zone induces a series of morphodynamic 

processes, especially relevant in sedimentary environments such as beaches and dunes. For 

the purposes of this work, two main processes have been considered as the most relevant ones 

in terms of the induced response, which represent two of most common coastal hazards: 

flooding and erosion. Because potential damages associated with both hazards are different, 

we have decided to analyze the vulnerability associated with a single event – the storm- by 

separately calculating each induced potential response. Thus, we shall associate to each storm 

class the magnitude of induced individual hazards (flooding and erosion) along the Catalan 

coast. 

 

4.1. Flood potential 

 



 10

The flood potential of a storm can be described as the potential temporary inundation 

of coastal areas due to wave action during the storm. Vulnerability assessment to flooding is a 

relatively straight forward task since it basically consists in evaluating which is the extension 

of the coastal zone to be inundated by a given water level (the event)14. Its accuracy will 

depend on the quality of the description of the coastal topography, the inclusion of the coastal 

response to the event and the evaluation of the water level during the event. To be properly 

calculated it requires good quality topographic data, an inundation model and a good 

description of the water level during the event.  

Due to the selected large spatial scale we approach to the evaluation of the flood 

potential in a simpler manner. We define the flood potential as the maximum elevation of the 

mean water level associated with each storm class, being calculated as the sum of the 

contributions of the wave run up, Ru, and the storm surge, ξ.  

The induced wave run-up during storms, Ru2%, was calculated by using the expression 

proposed by Stockdon et al15 who derived it by using only field data (no scale effects 

included) obtained in reflective and dissipative beaches. Individual run-up estimations are 

done at the peak of the storm, i.e. maximum induced Ru2%. The final run-up associated with 

each class is obtained by averaging the Ru2% values calculated for all storms recorded within 

the class. Estimated class-averaged run-up values for each storm class and beach type are 

shown in Fig. 4. As it was expected, as higher the intensity of the storm is, the larger the run-

up will be, with practically doubling the magnitude of the run-up from type-I storms to type-V 

ones for reflective beaches. For the selected representative beach slopes for the study area, the 

estimated run-up for reflective beaches is about two times larger than the one associated with 

dissipative ones. Obtained values for both profile types represent the envelope of expected 

values for any beach along the Catalan coast.  



 11

Storm surges in the area were characterized by analysing hourly tidal data recorded at 

the Barcelona Harbour from August 1992. It has to be considered that these water levels have 

been recorded in a sheltered area and they should not properly include effects visible in open 

coasts such as the contribution of wind set-up. As a consequence of this, obtained values must 

be considered as the minimum expected water level increase. Fig 4 and Table 1 show the 

calculated class-averaged storm surges where no well defined trend is detected. According to 

this variable, storms can be grouped into three groups: types I, II and III with ξ ≤ 0.20 m, type 

IV with surges between 0.20 m and 0.40 m and, type V with ξ > 0.40. 

If both contributions to the flood potential of storms in the area of study are compared, 

it can be clearly seen that along the Catalan coast, the main contributor to inundation during 

the impact of storms is the wave-induced run-up.  

 

4.2. Erosion potential 

 

The erosion potential can be described as the potential beach erosion induced by the 

impact of a storm when no constraints exist. This is characterized by two bulk parameters (see 

Fig. 5): the maximum retreat of a given control line in the beach (e.g. the shoreline), ∆X, and 

the eroded volume from the inner beach ∆V.  

The erosion potential of each storm class was estimated following the procedure 

developed by Mendoza and Jiménez11,16. First, a selected number of storms belonging to each 

class are used to calculate the induced erosion in a beach profile by using the Sbeach 

model17,18. Calculations are done for a theoretically infinite beach width to estimate the 

maximum erosion induced by the storm without any restriction such as that introduced by the 

presence of seawalls and/or waterfronts. Secondly, these calculated erosion values are 

parameterized in terms of a beach profile change parameter. The final goal is to obtain an 



 12

erosion predictor that fed with simple variables defining the storm (instead to use the full time 

series of wave characteristics during the storm as it was done with the model) will estimate its 

potential erosion. This parameter is afterwards used to calculate the erosion induced by all the 

storms included in each category. As in the case of flooding, this analysis was separately done 

for reflective and dissipative beaches because the magnitude of the induced erosion in both 

profiles to a given storm will differ. 

The final used beach change predictor was the one proposed by Jiménez et al19 which 

is based on the dimensionless fall velocity D (= H / wf T). It includes the D-parameter as a 

function of the excess of the actual D-values (for a given storm) above the equilibrium 

condition modulated by the beach slope. It is given by: 

 

βtan
5.0

DDJA e −=           (2) 

 

To properly reproduce the erosion simulated by the model, the JA-parameter had to be 

modified by including the storm duration, τ, i.e. JA· τ, which is consistent with the already 

observed importance of storm duration on the induced morphodynamic response20. Fig. 6 

shows the relationship between eroded volumes calculated with the Sbeach model and the 

corresponding JA· τ values for reflective and dissipative beaches. It has to be mentioned that 

the use of predictors without including the beach slope results in very poor prediction 

capability16.  

Fig. 7 shows the calculated class-averaged potential eroded volumes for each storm 

class and beach type. Again, and as it was expected, the higher the storm intensity is, the 

larger the eroded volume will be. Mean eroded volume values range from 11 m3/m/storm to 

103 m3/m/storm for classes I and V respectively in reflective beaches and, from 7 m3/m/storm 

to 28 m3/m/storm for dissipative ones. These results indicate that the storm potential erosion 



 13

in dissipative beaches would be about one third of the corresponding to reflective ones, 

provided they are similarly exposed to wave action during the storm. It has to be considered 

that in this first estimation significant overwash and breaching processes have not been 

included in the calculations which imply that class IV and V storms induced erosion should 

be under-predicted in dissipative beaches.  

The large difference in erosion magnitude from class-IV storm to class-V one was 

probably due to the fact, that there was only one storm classified as extreme. This storm 

consisted of a double peak wave event with the highest waves recorded during the entire 

period and, with a very long duration (7 days comprising the two peaks). This resulted in an 

extremely high energy content event inducing significant damages to ports and beaches along 

the Spanish Mediterranean coast.  

 

 

5. Coastal vulnerability 

 

Once coastal hazards have been estimated for each storm class, the next step was to 

build a framework to integrate this information with actual data of beach characteristics along 

the coast in such a way that we can assess its vulnerability. This implies to relate the hazard 

intensity with a variable characterising the capacity of the beach to cope with this process. In 

other words, this combination will measure the potential of the system to be harmed.  

This was done within a GIS-environment where a database comprising data on all 

beaches along the Catalan coast was included. The database contains basic information such 

as location, orientation, beach type, sediment grain size, width, height and hinterland 

properties.  



 14

 Due to the spatial scale of the analysis, it is necessary to take into account the 

variability of storm and beach properties along the entire regional coast. Geomorphologic 

variability is directly implemented in the database since specific data for each beach are 

already included. On the other hand, to take into account the spatial variability on storm 

properties and induced hazards, the Catalan coastal area was divided into 8 geographical 

zones where wave conditions during storms can be considered relatively homogeneous after 

propagation towards the coast. The definition of these areas was based on the use of a spatial 

database of hindcasted wave conditions during the period 1958-20017 and by analysing 

propagation patterns of storm conditions towards the coast simulated by using the WAM 

model. Thus, a single storm defined by a set of conditions at an offshore location could 

belong to different storm classes along the coast depending on the area to be considered.  

As it was previously mentioned, vulnerability indicators have been built by combining 

variables characterizing hazards intensity – erosion and flooding potentials – and beach 

parameters characterizing its capacity to cope with those processes. Thus, the Erosion 

Vulnerability Index includes the beach width whereas the Flood Vulnerability Index includes 

a measure of the local values of the height of the beach/dune crest. 

The Erosion Vulnerability Index, EVI, is defined in function of a erosion intermediate 

parameter, EIP, which is defined for each storm class as  

 

( )
W

X
EIP X∆

+∆
=

σα
          (3) 

 

where ∆X is the representative storm-induced shoreline retreat of the corresponding class for 

the given beach type, σ∆X is the standard deviation of the retreat calculated for all storms 



 15

within the class, α is a factor to account the safety level of the analysis (here use a value of 1) 

and W is the beach mean width.  

Similarly, the Flood Vulnerability Index, FVI, is defined in function of a flood 

intermediate parameter, FIP, which is defined for each storm class as  

 

( )
B

Ru
FIP Ru

ξσα ++
=           (4) 

 

where Ru is the representative run-up of the corresponding class for the given beach type, σRu 

is the standard deviation of the run-up calculated for all storms within the class, ξ is the 

representative storm surge of the storm class and B is the height of the beach/dune crest. 

These parameters are evaluated for each beach included in the database taken into 

account their location along the coast (potential changes in the storm intensity), the beach type 

(reflective or dissipative, which condition the magnitude of the induced erosion and water 

level at the shoreline) and actual beach width and height (this parameter has to be regularly 

updated as coastal geomorphology changes through time).  

Once EIP and FIP are known, the corresponding Erosion Vulnerability Index EVI and 

Flood Vulnerability Index FVI were calculated following the functional rule represented in 

Fig 8. This function assigns zero vulnerability to situations where the combination of the 

hazard intensity and the respective beach dimension determines the potential of the coast to be 

harmed to be very low, whereas it assigns a value of 1 to combinations indicating “full 

damage”.  

As a first approximation, we have defined the “safest situation” (zero vulnerability) for 

a storm class with respect to erosion to a beach configuration given by ( )XXW ∆+∆≥ σα2 , i.e. 

the actual beach width is equal or larger than two times the representative retreat induced by 



 16

the considered storm class. Similarly, for the case of flooding, the “safest situation” (zero 

vulnerability) for a storm class corresponds to a beach configuration given by 

( )ξασ ++≥ RuRuB 2 , i.e. when the representative total water level associated with the 

considered storm class is equal or less than the half of the beach/dune crest. 

On the other side, the maximum vulnerability (1) is assigned to situations where the 

actual beach width is equal or narrower than the representative retreat associated with the 

analyzed storm class for erosion (EIP ≥ 1) and, to situations where the actual beach height is 

equal or lower than the representative total water level for inundation (FIP ≥ 1).  

Between these two extremes, the corresponding (erosion and inundation) vulnerability 

index linearly increases as a function of EIP and FIP values. Finally, a qualitative 5-class 

scale has been defined ranging from very low to very high vulnerabilities by taking intervals 

of 0.2 units in EVI and FVI (Fig 8). 

As an example of application, Fig. 9 shows values of the erosion and flood 

vulnerability indexes assessed in two stretches of the Catalan coast comprising reflective 

(Barcelona city coast) and  dissipative beaches (Ebro delta) to the impact of class-V storms. 

Results obtained for the Ebro Delta are reflecting the existence of very wide (wider 

than 100 m), low- lying (dissipative) beaches with heights around 1.3 m except in the Riumar 

area where the existence of a dune row increases it up to 2.4 m. Although the representative 

total water level value for dissipative beaches is relatively low, the low height of these 

beaches determines the corresponding FVI value to be Very High, with the exception of the 

Riumar area, where the existence of a higher elevation decreases its value down to Medium 

vulnerability. The relatively low erosion values estimated for dissipative beaches together the 

large width of Delta beaches determine the EVI value to be Very Low. Again, it has to be 

considered that overwash induced erosion has not been fully considered in this first 



 17

approximation. Fig. 10 shows the behavior of this area under the impact of a storm of this 

category, where beaches are fully inundated. 

Results obtained for reflective beaches along the Barcelona city waterfront reflects that 

high water levels (as corresponds to steep beaches) associated with this V-class storm clearly 

exceed the beach height (averaged value of about 3 m), determining FVI values to be Very 

High. With respect to erosion, the combination of narrow widths (between 10 and 20 m) and 

the large retreat values associated with the impact of a class-V storm determines the EVI to be 

Very High. The lower obtained values for Nova Icaria and Sant Miquel beaches (Medium 

vulnerability) are due to the fact that they are significantly wider (30 and 40m respectively) 

and that they are partially sheltered (a local correction factor is included).  

Fig. 11 shows the impact of a class-V storm on Barcelona beaches. The Nova Icaria beach 

(at the forefront on the right picture) shows flood marks up to the promenade in the back 

(beach fully inundated) but it was wide enough to be fully damaged by erosion. On the other 

hand, the narrower Bogatell beach (in the back of the photo) together the full inundation, it 

experienced the direct impact of the waves on its promenade due to the nearly fully shoreline 

retreat during the storm. The case of Sant Sebastia and Barceloneta beaches (left picture) is 

similar to the described before. Thus, the Sant Sebastia beach (in the forefront) shows marks 

of fully inundation but still, it maintains a subaerial beach after the impact of the storm, 

whereas La Barceloneta beach (at the back) is nearly fully eroded downward the groin and, 

the promenade is fully exposed to wave action.

6. Discussion and conclusions 

 

In this paper a framework to estimate coastal vulnerability to storm impacts at a 

regional scale has been presented. It has been derived for the Catalan coast (NW 

Mediterranean) but can be easily adapted to other coasts. The framework estimates the 

physical vulnerability of the coast to storms by separately estimating two partial hazards: 

flooding and erosion.  

Instead of estimating the vulnerability associated with a given set of wave conditions, 

the method assesses the vulnerability induced by representative storms of the area. To do this, 

storms are first classified using a 5-class system similar to that used for hurricanes (weak, 

moderate, significant, severe and extreme). This permits coastal managers to associate a given 

set of wave conditions to one storm class and, to the corresponding vulnerability map of the 

Catalan coast, where they can easily and rapidly identify the areas sensitive to such storm 

conditions.  

The selected functional relationship to define the erosion and flood vulnerability 

indexes, EVI and FVI, is based on the ratio of two magnitudes representing the potential harm 

and a beach variable characterizing its ability to cope with it. In the case of flooding these 

variables are the total water level associated with the storm class and the actual beach height 

respectively. In the case of erosion they are the shoreline retreat associated with the storm 

class and the actual beach width. In both cases, the variable characterizing the harm is 

obtained from statistics of calculations of total water level (wave runups and surges) and 

induced retreats for all storms within a class and, as larger the number of storms are, the more 

robust the estimation will be.  

In the example of application included here, vulnerability assessment for a class-V 

storm in some beaches along the Catalan coast, a qualitative agreement has been observed 



 19

between calculations and the reality. At present, a first generation of vulnerability maps has 

been produced for the entire Catalan coast21, which can be viewed through Google Earth by 

using a kml file provided upon request. 

Because the vulnerability assessment largely depends on beach characteristics (height 

and width) and they are significantly affected by coastal dynamics, it is necessary to 

periodically update their values, especially when extreme events occur. This will permit 

managers to update their vulnerability assessments and the corresponding plans to manage it. 

In the case of the Catalan coast, because a large part of beaches are experiencing significant 

long-term erosion, it is expected that even under a steady wave climate (intensity of coastal 

hazards associated with storms), the vulnerability will tend to increase due to a lower capacity 

of the beaches to cope with the harm.
