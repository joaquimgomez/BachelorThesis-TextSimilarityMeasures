Abstract. Integrated risk assessment approaches to support
coastal managers’ decisions when designing plans are in-
creasingly becoming an urgent need. To enable efficient
coastal management, possible present and future scenar-
ios must be included, disaster risk reduction measures in-
tegrated, and multiple hazards dealt with. In this work, the
Bayesian network-based approach to coastal risk assessment
was applied and tested at two Mediterranean sandy coasts
(Tordera Delta in Spain and Lido degli Estensi–Spina in
Italy). Process-oriented models are used to predict hazards at
the receptor scale which are converted into impacts through
vulnerability relations. In each site, results from 96 simu-
lations under different scenarios are integrated by using a
Bayesian-based decision network to link forcing character-
istics with expected impacts through conditional probabili-
ties. Consultations with local stakeholders and experts have
shown that the tool is valuable for communicating risks and
the effects of risk reduction strategies. The tool can therefore
be valuable support for coastal decision-making.

1 Introduction

Increasing coastal risk due to the intensification of haz-
ard and exposure magnitudes (IPCC, 2012, 2013) is driv-
ing the needs of coastal managers towards more innovative
approaches for coastal risk assessment and management. At
the international and European levels these needs are high-

lighted by the impact of recent extreme events such as Hur-
ricane Katrina in Louisiana in 2005 (Beven II et al., 2008),
storm Xynthia in France in 2010 (Bertin et al., 2012; Kolen
et al., 2013), Hurricane Sandy in New York in 2012 (Kunz
et al., 2013; Van Verseveld et al., 2015), and the southern
North Sea storm in 2013 (Spencer et al., 2015). Similarly,
in the Mediterranean, several extreme events have impacted
coastal communities at the local and regional levels such as
storm Klaus in 2009, as described in Bertotti et al. (2012),
and cyclogenesis mechanisms in the NW Mediterranean de-
scribed in Trigo et al. (2002). In this context, the coasts
of Catalunya (Spain) and Emilia-Romagna (Italy) also re-
cently experienced coastal storm impacts that caused socioe-
conomic losses (Jiménez et al., 2012; Perini et al., 2015;
Harley et al., 2016; Trembanis et al., 2017).

Therefore, coastal managers must properly deal with
coastal risk when designing management plans. This is
recognised in several initiatives such as the protocol of In-
tegrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) for the Mediter-
ranean, which includes a chapter on natural hazards and ad-
vises signed parties to implement vulnerability and risk as-
sessments. In addition, the EU Floods Directive is another
example dealing specifically with floods. Therefore, the need
for integrated decision support systems based on modern
approaches for coastal risk assessment is increasing. Cop-
ing with storm-induced risks in coastal areas involves test-
ing multiple risk reduction measures against multiple forc-
ing conditions in current and future scenarios considering
climate change.

The literature provides different approaches with which
to implement these assessments. It is becoming increas-
ingly important to consider multi-hazard approaches when
assessing risk at all levels (i.e. from the regional to local
scales). Therefore, the scientific community provides inte-
grated and interdisciplinary approaches (e.g. Ciavola et al.,
2011a, b; Penning-Rowsell et al., 2014; Vojinovic et al.,
2014; Oumeraci et al., 2015; Van Dongeren et al., 2018).
Up-to-date methodologies can be used in coastal risk assess-
ments at different scales ranging from regional (up to hun-
dreds of kilometres) to local assessments (up to 10 km). Re-
gional methodologies aim to locate coastal sectors more sen-
sitive to impacts, the so-called hotspots. Local approaches
aim to achieve the highest possible level of accuracy for risk
evaluation and to support decision-making for previously
identified hotspots. Notably, coastal risk assessments must
include physical concepts to characterise physical phenom-
ena (i.e. the source of the hazard) and socioeconomic con-
cepts to describe the impact of the physical phenomena on
human assets (i.e. the consequences). A conceptual flexible
framework that can capture all aspects of coastal risk assess-
ment is the source–pathway–receptor–consequence (SPRC)
model (e.g. Narayan et al., 2014; Zanuttigh et al., 2014;
Oumeraci et al., 2015).

When addressing the problem at the local scale, it is neces-
sary to accurately predict the impact and reproduce in detail
coastal hazards. The analysis of physical impacts is regularly
implemented with process-based numerical models provid-
ing detailed information for areas prone to multiple hazards
(e.g. Roelvink et al., 2009; McCall et al., 2010; Harley et al.,
2011; Roelvink and Reniers, 2012). However, multiple forc-
ing conditions acting at the site and under different scenarios
must be evaluated. Bayesian network-based (BN) approaches
have demonstrated their versatility and utility in efficiently
combining multiple variables to predict system behaviour
for multiple hypotheses (e.g. Plant et al., 2016). The data
assimilation capacity of BN approaches allows integrating
many multi-hazard simulations from process-oriented mod-
els for joint assessment of different scenarios and alternatives
(e.g. Gutierrez et al., 2011; Poelhekke et al., 2016), includ-
ing also socioeconomic concepts (e.g. Van Verseveld et al.,
2015). This is an advantage compared to classical GIS-based
approaches, which are more limited when combining large
number of simulations in multiple subsets of scenarios.

Jäger et al. (2018) proposed the conceptual BN framework
used in this work, which is based on the integration of the
SPRC and was developed in the RISC-KIT EU FP7 project
(Van Dongeren et al., 2018), where it was used as a Bayesian-
based decision network (BDN). Plomaritis et al. (2018) ap-
plied the framework to test its potential as an early warn-
ing system and the response of risk reduction measures in
Ria Formosa (Portugal). In this paper, the authors describe
the application of the framework adapted to select and com-
pare strategic alternatives to reduce coastal risk in current and
projected future climate scenarios. The application was con-

ducted at two sedimentary coasts in the Mediterranean en-
vironment, namely the Tordera Delta for the Catalan coast
(Spain) and the Lido degli Estensi–Spina for the Emilia-
Romagna coast (Italy). At both study sites, the tested mea-
sures were pre-selected taking into account the outcome of
interviews to stakeholders (see Martinez et al., 2018) and ob-
tained results were used in a participatory process to select
acceptable measures on the basis of a multi-criteria analysis
(see Barquet and Cumiskey, 2018).

2 Regional contexts and case studies

The two presented case study sites are representative of many
other coastal areas in the Mediterranean consisting of sandy
beaches where local economic activities are based on the
tourist sector. These areas are characterised by urbanisa-
tion and infrastructural growth close to the shoreline (lim-
iting natural beach accommodation processes) and economic
activities located on the beach and immediate first part of
the hinterland (e.g. concessions, campsites, restaurants). The
coast keeps offering its recreational function, but loses its
protective function against storms. In addition, the hinterland
is exposed to storm-induced hazards.

2.1 Tordera Delta, Catalunya (Spain)

The Catalan coast is located in the NW Mediterranean Sea
(Fig. 1a1). It consists of a coastline 600 km long with about
280 km of beaches. Coastal damage has increased during the
last decades as a result of the increasing exposure along the
coastal zone and progressive narrowing of existing beaches
(Jiménez et al., 2012) through dominant erosive behaviour
due to net littoral drift (Jiménez et al., 2011). Locations expe-
riencing storm-induced problems are present along the entire
coastline and are especially concentrated in areas experienc-
ing the largest decadal-scale shoreline erosion rates. Among
these areas, the Tordera Delta, located about 50 km north of
Barcelona, provides a good example (Jiménez et al., 2018)
(Fig. 2).

The deltaic coast is composed of a coarse sandy coastline
extending about 5 km from S’Abanell beach at the northern
end and Malgrat de Mar beach in the south (see Fig. 2). This
zone is highly dynamic and is currently in retreat because
of the net long-shore sediment transport directed southwest
and the decrease in Tordera river sediment supplies. Con-
sequently, the beaches surrounding the river mouth, which
were traditionally stable or accreting, are being significantly
eroded (Jiménez et al., 2011; Sardá et al., 2013). As a result
of the progressive narrowing of the beach in the area, the fre-
quency of inundation episodes and damage to existing infras-
tructure (beach promenade, campsite installations, desalina-
tion plant infrastructure, roads) has significantly increased
since the beginning of the 1990s (Jiménez et al., 2011; Sardá
et al., 2013) (Fig. 2).

(b2) local hotspots of Lido degli Estensi–Spina. The main locations (red dots), wave buoys (red triangles), tide gauge (red diamond), and the
case study sites (red squares). The domains of the large-scale and local models (dashed red lines) are highlighted for each box.

Subsequently, existing campsites in the most affected
zones have abandoned the areas closer to the shoreline, as
in many cases, those are fully eroded or directly exposed to
wave action. In other cases, owners have tried to implement
local protection measures that in many cases have enhanced
existing erosion (Jiménez et al., 2018).

Coastal storms in the Catalan Sea can be defined as events
during which the significant wave height (Hs) exceeds a
threshold of 2 m for a minimum duration of 6 h (Mendoza
et al., 2011). Despite this, not all storms can be considered as
hazardous events in terms of induced inundation and/or ero-
sion. Mendoza et al. (2011) developed a five-category storm
classification for typical conditions in the Catalan Sea based
on their power content. The classification seems to well rep-
resent the behaviour of storm events in the Mediterranean
and was successfully employed in the Northern Adriatic (Ar-
maroli et al., 2012). Furthermore, Mendoza et al. (2011) es-
timated the expected order of magnitude of induced coastal
hazards (erosion and inundation) for each class and beach
characteristics along the Catalan coast. According to their re-
sults, storms from category III (Hs = 3.5 m, duration around
50 h) to V (Hs= 6 m, duration longer than 100 h) are most

likely to cause significant damages. One important aspect to
consider is that wave-induced run-up (setup+ swash) is the
largest contribution to overwash at the beach during storm
events, because the magnitude of surges along the Catalan
coast is relatively low (Mendoza and Jiménez, 2008).

2.2 Lido degli Estensi–Spina, Emilia-Romagna (Italy)

The Emilia-Romagna (Italy) coast is located in the north-
ern part of the Adriatic Sea (Fig. 1b1). The coast is about
130 km long and characterised by low-lying, predominantly
dissipative sandy beaches. The coastal corridor has low
elevations, mainly ranging from −2 to 3 m a.m.s.l. (Re-
gione Emilia-Romagna, 2010). The area alternates between
highly urbanised touristic zones and natural areas with dunes,
which are often threatened by flooding and erosion (Re-
gione Emilia-Romagna, 2010). The impact of coastal ero-
sion was emphasised by subsidence due to water and gas
extraction over the last century, especially in the Ravenna
area (Taramelli et al., 2015), a decrease in riverine sediment
transport because of the strong human influence on rivers and
their basins (Preciso et al., 2012), and the reforestation of
the Apennines (Billi and Rinaldi, 1997). Touristic activities

(accommodation, food service, beach services) can be con-
sidered main drivers of the coastal economy. Beach conces-
sions, which provide beach and food services, have grown
exponentially in number since the second half of the last
century, with negative consequences on natural areas, as in
the province of Ravenna (Sytnik and Stecchi, 2014). To pro-
tect the coast and its assets from the impacts of flooding and
erosion, regional managers have constructed hard defences
(e.g. emerged and submerged breakwaters, groins, rubble
mounds; Regione Emilia-Romagna, 2010) along the entire
regional coast (over 60 % of the coast is protected) and regu-
larly implement restorative nourishment plans.

During the last decades, several EU projects such as The-
seus (www.theseusproject.eu, last access: May 2018) and
MICORE (www.micore.eu, last access: May 2018) provided
a good understanding of hydro-morphodynamics and risks
to the coast. These projects and works published in the in-
ternational literature such as Ciavola et al. (2007), Armaroli
et al. (2009, 2012), and Perini et al. (2016) were the prod-
uct of strong collaboration between scientists and regional
managers (Servizio Geologico Sismico e dei Suoli, SGSS).
This led to the compilation and implementation of a storm
database (Perini et al., 2011) and a regional early warn-
ing system (Harley et al., 2016). The RISC-KIT project
(www.risckit.eu, last access: May 2018) provided additional
knowledge on this coastal area. The areas most exposed to
coastal risk are well known, as can be seen in the works of
Perini et al. (2016) and Armaroli and Duo (2018).

For a more local perspective, the Lido degli Estensi–Spina
coastline (Comacchio municipality, Ferrara province, Italy)
area represents a highly touristic stretch of coast with con-
cessions directly facing the sea (Fig. 1b2). The littoral drift
is northward as confirmed by the width of the sandy beaches,
which increases from 20 to 50 m in the southern part of Lido
di Spina to 200 to 300 m in the northern part of Lido degli
Estensi. Here the sediment is trapped by the groin of the
mouth of a navigation canal (Porto Canale). The beach is not
protected, and regional managers implement regular nour-
ishment in the southern part of the area (Nordstrom et al.,
2015). At the back of the concessions, the villages accom-
modate restaurants and hotels for tourists, along with resi-
dential buildings (mainly holiday houses). In a recent study,
Bertoni et al. (2015) analysed aerial photographs of the evo-
lution of the case study area, focusing on the stretch of coast
between Porto Garibaldi and the Reno river mouth. The area
was impacted by the event in February 2015 (see Fig. 3) with
limited, but not negligible, consequences for several conces-
sions (Perini et al., 2015; Trembanis et al., 2017).

The hydrodynamics of the regional domain are well de-
scribed in terms of storm waves and surges (IDROSER,
1996; Ciavola et al., 2007). The area is micro-tidal (neap tidal
range: 0.3–0.4 m; spring tidal range: 0.8–0.9 m); the surge
component plays an important role (1-in-2-year storm surge:
0.61 m) and is mainly generated from the SE (Scirocco)
winds (according to the orientation of the Adriatic Sea). Fur-
thermore, the wave climate is low energy (mean Hs −0.4 m;
60 % of waves are below 1 m). However, extreme events can

be energetic, such as the storm of September 2004 (maxi-
mum Hs= 5.65 m, estimated by Ciavola et al., 2007) or the
one of 5–6 February 2015 (maximum Hs= 4.66 m, measured
at the Cesenatico buoy shown Fig. 1b1; Perini et al., 2015;
Trembanis et al., 2017).

The combination of high waves and storm surges, whose
combined probability of occurrence in the area was assessed
by Masina et al. (2015), can have strong impacts at the re-
gional level, as demonstrated by Armaroli et al. (2009), Ar-
maroli et al. (2012) and Harley and Ciavola (2013). Notably,
based on historical data (Perini et al., 2011), Armaroli et
al. (2012) provided a set of critical storm thresholds for natu-
ral and urbanised beaches to characterise potentially impact-
ing storms. The thresholds included a combination of off-
shore Hs and total water level (TWL): (1) Hs≥ 2 m and TWL
(surge+ tide)≥ 0.7 m for urbanised zones and (2) Hs≥ 3.3
and TWL (surge+ tide)≥ 0.8 m for natural areas with dunes.

3 Methodology

3.1 General approach: from source to consequences

The analysis framework employed in this study follows Jäger
et al. (2018) and is based on the use of the SPRC model
(FLOODsite, 2009; Oumeraci et al., 2015), as shown in
Fig. 4. This model is widely used in coastal risk management
(e.g. Narayan et al., 2014) and permits a clear representation
of all risk components and their links from source to conse-
quence.

The source includes the forces determining coastal re-
sponse to the impact of extreme storms, which in this case are
essentially a set of events representative of the storm climates
of the study sites over the entire intensity range (from mod-
erate to extreme). These storms propagate through the path-
way, causing erosion at the coast and inundation on the hin-
terland. Both hazards are the main focus of the analysis. The
pathway is solved through a process-oriented model chain to
propagate storms and quantify induced processes. These are
assessed for the entire coastal domain where receptors are
present, characterised by their location and typology, which
define their exposure and vulnerability to each hazard. Fi-
nally, consequences are evaluated by combining the vulner-
ability and exposure of each receptor with the magnitude of
the hazards.

Since the main objective of the analysis is to test risk re-
duction strategies to help decision makers in future planning,
the framework is applied under current conditions (CUS),
which define the baseline scenario and climate change sce-
narios (CCSs) to define a plausible future projection. Finally,
the analysis is repeated considering different risk reduction
measures.

The BN approach reproduces the steps of the SPRC model
through dependency relations between variables. This affects
the application of the steps of the SPRC model, as explained
in the following sections. At the same time, the BN data as-
similation capabilities are used to integrate large amounts
of simulations, i.e. results from multiple sources at multiple
receptors. The BN integrates dependency relations between

work is implemented through (b) a model chain, which consists of a

sequences (C) are calculated based on the computed hazards (H) at

pacts and the implementation of measures (M).

source, hazard, and consequences, at the receptor scale, for
all available incoming conditions and scenarios.

3.2 Source: identification and design

To properly characterise storms, all relevant variables con-
trolling the magnitude of induced hazards (erosion and inun-
dation) must be considered, i.e. Hs, wave period (Tp), wave
direction, storm duration, and water level. In this approach,
source characteristics are defined in terms of a set of rep-
resentative storms that cover the typical conditions at each
study site. This information is obtained from existing wave
time series or bulk data of the events (recorded or modelled),
usually in deep waters, propagated towards the coast to char-
acterise storm conditions at the nearshore of the study areas.
Probable combinations that cannot be covered using exist-

ing records are represented by synthetic design storms (e.g.
Poelhekke et al., 2016; Plomaritis et al., 2018; Jäger et al.,
2018). The storm events were selected based on the infor-
mation available for each study site through the RISC-KIT
WEB-GIS impact-oriented database (Ciavola et al., 2018;
http://risckit.cloudapp.net/risckit/#/), which provided storm
characteristics and socioeconomic impacts of the events. In
addition, time series of waves (either bulk Hs, Tp and mean
direction, or spectrum) and water levels during each storm
event were used when this information was available. In or-
der to be used in a BN approach, storm characteristic vari-
ables must be discretised in ranges which define the resolu-
tion of the source description. In this application, used simu-
lations cover uniformly all variable combinations, assuming
no prior knowledge of their statistics.

For the Tordera Delta case, the selected variables to de-
fine storm scenarios were Hs at the peak of the storm, to-
tal storm duration, and incoming storm direction. Tp does
not significantly vary during storms in the study area (see
Mendoza et al., 2011) and was not included as a character-
istic variable. Due to the coastline configuration and mor-
phology, the area is sensitive to the direction of the incom-
ing storm (Sanuy and Jiménez, 2018). Thus, the main di-
rections in terms of dominant (E) and secondary (S) storms
needed to be considered separately. Finally, the position of
the mean sea level (MSL) during the event was included to
reproduce hypothetical future projections of sea level rise
(SLR) due to climate change. The selected bins for each
variable can be seen in Table 1. These lead to 12 combina-
tions defining the source under current MSL and 12 under
future MSL (given by a SLR scenario). Each combination
of states is represented by two simulations of slightly differ-
ent storms to account for potential variability within variable
ranges, leading to a total of 24 simulations under the current
MSL and 24 under SLR. Of the 24 simulations under current
MSL, 16 correspond to historic (recorded) events including
the two largest, which occurred in November 2001 and De-
cember 2008. These were classified as extreme storms (cat-
egory V) according to the Mendoza et al. (2011). To include
the full range of cases, the remaining eight storms were com-
pleted by using combinations of Hs–duration–direction not
previously recorded. These events were modelled assuming
they follow a triangular-shaped evolution with the peak in-
tensity at the half of their duration (see e.g. McCall et al.,
2010; Poelhekke et al., 2016). Data used to reproduce the
historic events include the time series of hindcast wind fields
and 2-D wave spectra time series in deep waters for the NW
Mediterranean (Guedes-Soares et al., 2002; Ratsimandresy
et al., 2008). Wave conditions must propagate towards the
coast to properly define storm events at the study site. At the
Catalan coast, the storm surge contribution to the sea surface
level is a magnitude lower than the wave-induced compo-
nent, and the two variables are uncorrelated (Mendoza and
Jiménez, 2008). All historical events with recorded associ-
ated water levels were simulated with the real storm surge,

while the synthetic storms were simulated with a storm surge
of a 0.25 m constant throughout the event, as representative
of the site according to the same authors.

Previous works in the area of the Lido degli Estensi–Spina
case study have identified the dominant role of wave height
and total water level in controlling the magnitude of storm-
induced erosion and inundation (Armaroli et al., 2009, 2012).
Due to this, variables used to characterise the source were
the maximum Hs and maximum TWL (surge+ tide) during
each storm event. Thus, wave period and the direction of the
storms were not considered as a source characteristic variable
to be discretised. The used range for each variable is shown in
Table 1. Seven historically based events were selected from
the RISC-KIT Database, and to cover all 12 possible com-
binations in the CUS five additional synthetic events were
considered. Notably, for several historic events, neither re-
liable nor continuous time series for waves and water lev-
els were available from local measuring stations. To ensure
consistency, both historical and synthetic events were rep-
resented based on the following methodology. Starting with
the list of bulk information for each event (maximum Hs,
Tp, main direction of the storm, maximum TWL or duration
when available), storms following triangular-shaped evolu-
tion (e.g. Carley and Cox, 2003; Corbella and Stretch, 2012)
for Hs, Tp, and surge were created. The peak of the waves
was assumed to occur at the same time as the maximum
surge (calculated as the difference between the TWL and
maximum astronomical predicted tide). When bulk param-
eters were missing, the following “worst case” assumptions
were introduced: Tp at peak of 10 s, wave direction orthog-
onal to the shoreline, and duration based on similarity with
other storms. Each storm representing a Hs–TWL combina-
tion was simulated twice, with slightly different directions,
to account for potential variability on source characteristics,
leading to 24 simulations in the CUS. Additional 24 simula-
tions were performed to cover the CCS.

3.3 Pathways: modelling multi-hazard impacts

To simulate the pathway and obtain hazards of interest, a
model chain was designed and adapted for each site (Fig. 4b).
Any model can be used within the model chain, and results
will be as good as the model is accurate. The chain must
be able to reproduce all hazards to be assessed (i.e. erosion
and inundation). To do this, a detailed 2-D process-oriented
model designed to simulate coastal storm-induced processes
is used, the XBeach model, which is able to provide inte-
grated information on inundation and erosion (see Roelvink
et al., 2009, for model details). At present it is a state-of-art
model on coastal systems. However, the proposed framework
can work with different (simpler) models when they are able
to simulate the target processes (inundation and erosion). The
XBeach model was used in both study cases.

The model chain for the Tordera Delta consists of two
blocks, one “external” and one “internal”. The external mod-
ule comprises three models (HAMSOM, HIRLAM, and
WAM) that supply the forcing conditions (time series of wa-
ter levels, wind fields, and waves) and are run by Puertos
del Estado (Spanish Ministry of Public Works). The output
of these models is taken directly as an input for the inter-
nal module, which comprises the SWAN (Booij et al., 1996)
and XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009) models. SWAN was used
to propagate wave conditions from deep waters to the off-
shore boundary of the XBeach model (20 m depth), while
XBeach was employed to assess the extension and magni-
tude of inundation and erosion at the study site (local scale).
The model chain was validated through the St. Esteve event
in 2008, obtaining a Brier skill score of 0.68 for the morpho-
logical response of the emerged part of the beach (Sanuy and
Jiménez, 2018). Simulation results can be considered excel-
lent for scores over 0.6 (Sutherland et al., 2004)

The model chain for Lido degli Estensi–Spina only in-
cluded the XBeach model. This simple approach was pos-
sible based on the assumption that the information derived
from the RISC-KIT Database can be considered representa-
tive of the storm in the domain, as collected from different
sources (e.g. offshore buoys, harbours’ tide gauges, newspa-

pers) along the Emilia-Romagna coast (Perini et al., 2011;
Ciavola et al., 2018). The model was qualitatively validated
using observed inundation extension and profile beach re-
sponse of the February 2015 event (Perini et al., 2015; Trem-
banis et al., 2017).

3.4 Receptors and consequences

The methodology applied in this work individually identi-
fied receptors located at the study sites (Fig. 4c) (Jäger et al.,
2017). First, receptors with homogeneous vulnerability char-
acteristics were defined and separately considered. Then, for
each group of receptors, polygons were drawn using a GIS-
based tool to account for their exact location and size. Fi-
nally, the polygons were intersected with the cells of the 2-D
detailed model grid (XBeach) to assign to each receptor the
nodes of the model that will affect it.

For the inundation hazard, the value of the maximum water
depth inside each polygon (receptor) was used as the impact
variable. Then, by using flood-damage curves for the cor-
responding receptor typology, inundation water depth was
translated to relative damage. This was then translated into
four levels of impact – none, low, medium, and high – which
are dependent on the case and receptor (see the following
sections). The chosen damage curves do not include uncer-
tainties, and they are used as recommended by the Admin-
istration at each study site. This implies that damage ranges
and damage–hazard relations are different and, therefore, fi-
nal impact levels (from none to high) are specific to the site.
This assumption aimed to better communicate results to local
stakeholders.

The magnitude of the risk associated with erosion de-
pends on the combination of vertical erosion and distance
of erosion to the receptors. This was implemented by build-
ing multiple buffers (increasing in distance) around each re-
ceptor and applying the polygon intersection formerly ex-
plained with the gridded maximum vertical erosion output
from XBeach. The definition of risk categories related to ero-
sion thresholds and distances is also site dependent, given
their different morphologies.

3.4.1 Exposure and vulnerability in the Tordera Delta
case study

The distribution of receptors for the Tordera Delta case study
was derived from cartographic information of the Catalan
Cartographic Institute and completed manually through or-
thophoto analysis. The study site was divided into eight ar-
eas, of which four are located at the south of the river mouth,
corresponding to the Malgrat de Mar municipality, and the
other four to the north, corresponding to the Blanes munic-
ipality. These two sets of four areas were selected to enable
the analysis of the impact at different bands regarding their
distance to the limit of the public beach. The first band cor-
responds to the first 20 m of hinterland. The second band is

30 m wide and located just after the first one, i.e. 20 to 50 m
from the boundary of the public domain. The third covers the
range from 50 to 75 m, while the fourth band covers all the
hinterland omitted between the end of the third band and the
inland domain boundary. This enables an assessment of the
distribution of the impacts in terms of distance to the coast-
line and allowed exploring setbacks as risk reduction mea-
sures. Three groups of receptors were identified to be homo-
geneous in terms of vulnerability, namely houses (concrete
buildings), campsite elements (soft buildings and caravans),
and infrastructure (promenade and road at the back of the
beach). Table 2 shows the distribution of campsite elements
and houses in the different areas. The infrastructural recep-
tors (promenade at the north and road at the south) are only
located in the first 20 m band (areas 1 and 5).

The consequences of flooding were assessed through
flood-damage curves used to characterise the relative dam-
age based only on water depth (Table 3). Data were obtained
from the Agència Catalana de l’Aigua (2014).

The relative damage values to buildings and campsite ele-
ments were converted into the level of risk as follows: (i) no
impact for 0 % relative damage to buildings and campsite el-
ements; (ii) low impact for damages below 26 % to buildings
and 50 % for campsite elements; (iii) medium impact when
damages to buildings range from 26 to 45 % and damages to
campsite elements range between 50 and 70 %; and (iv) high
impact for relative damages higher than those formerly ex-
posed for both receptors.

The buffers defined to assess the erosion hazard at the
Tordera Delta are as follows: (i) a 20 m distance was used
as a threshold from “none” to “low” erosion risk and cor-
responds to the average beach retreat at the site for a storm
with a return period of 38 years (commonly used for infras-
tructural receptors similar to those in the Tordera Delta for
a lifetime of about 25 years). (ii) The 12 m buffer (average
retreat for the 10-year return period) was used as the thresh-
old from low to “medium” impact. Medium impact is a post-
monitoring situation where receptors will be exposed to the
direct impact for relatively frequent storms. (iii) Finally, the
3 m buffer was used as the threshold for “high” impact risk,
meaning that the receptor is directly affected by erosion at
the toe or impacted by waves during the storm. A buffer was
considered to be affected when vertical erosion was higher
than 50 cm.

3.4.2 Exposure and vulnerability in the Lido degli
Estensi–Spina case study

The analysed receptors belong to the central area of the
model domain at approximately 600 m from the lateral
boundaries (Fig. 1b2). Two main types of receptors were se-
lected: (i) the residential and commercial buildings mainly
present in the towns of Lido degli Estensi and Lido di Spina
and (ii) beach concessions on the beach directly facing the
sea. In this study, only receptors belonging to the seafront of

Lido degli Estensi and Lido di Spina were considered, as they
are mainly impacted by sea storms. Receptors were extracted
from a recent regional topographic map (Carta Topografica
Regionale, scale 1 : 25 000, year 2013). Table 4 summarises
the identified receptors.

The vulnerability relation for inundation hazards was de-
fined considering a flood-damage curve from a recent study
on Italian territory by Scorzini and Frank (2015). This work
was based on a micro- and macro-scale study of the impacts
of the 2010 river flood in Veneto (Italy) on residential houses.
In the current work, it was adapted and applied to the re-
ceptors of the area (see details in Table 5a) and relates the
relative damage factor (values: 0–1) to flood depth. In partic-

ular, the worst case curve was used, which represents flood-
related damages to single-family detached buildings with a
basement. Although this curve is for residential buildings, it
was assumed the same for commercial buildings and beach
concessions, as no additional and specific information was
available. The curve was modified considering the risk re-
duction implementation described in Sect. 3.5.2. The level
of flood risk was defined as follows: none, when the relative
damage is null; low, when the relative damage factor is higher
than zero but lower than 0.1; medium, for a factor between
0.1 and 0.2; and high, for a relative damage factor higher than
0.2.

The vulnerability relation for erosion was defined for con-
cessions only. The impacts due to the erosion hazard were
defined based on a two-buffer approach for each receptor:
the first buffer was the receptor limits in the ground, and the
second included a corridor of 10 m around the receptor.

Erosion was considered present if > 0.05 m (vertical) and
significant when > 0.5 m. The erosion risk categories for
each receptor were set as follows: (i) safe, when there is no
erosion in any buffer; (ii) potential damage, when erosion is
present in the 10 m buffer and/or present but not significant
in the receptor itself; and (iii) damage, when the erosion limit
of 0.5 m is exceeded within the receptor limits. Notably, the
threshold of 0.5 m was set by considering the uncertainty of

the model grid topography (±0.15 m) and assuming that the
foundations of the concessions are a minimum of 0.2 m thick.

3.5 Testing scenarios and risk reduction alternatives

To compute the analysis under CCSs and under the imple-
mentation of risk reduction measures, it was necessary to
identify the variables and settings affected by each scenario,
either a future projection or implementation of a measure.
Therefore, an appropriate approach was selected to consider
these modifications in the methodology chain.

The CCSs mainly affect the hazard and, therefore, are ap-
plied in the modelling chain. The risk reduction measures
can affect both hazard and vulnerability/exposure variables.
In the following, the implementation of the CCSs and mea-
sures is described for each case study, emphasising the af-
fected variables and steps of the methodology. The measures
were pre-selected considering interviews with stakeholders
and were assumed to be fully implemented and completely
effective (measure uptake and effectiveness: 100 %) in all
cases.

3.5.1 Climate change scenarios in the case studies

Future projections of MSL were based on the AR5 RCP8.5
(Church et al., 2013). Other factors such as changes in
storminess, wind speed, or wave height were not expected
to change significantly in the NW Mediterranean (Lionello
et al., 2008; Conte and Lionello, 2013) and are characterised
by high uncertainty in the Northern Adriatic (IPCC, 2013).
Data to include the SLR in the assessment of future scenarios
were provided by the EC Joint Research Centre database (for
further detail, see Vousdoukas et al., 2016). For the Tordera
Delta study case, the time horizon of 2100 was chosen, while
the 2050 projection was used for Lido degli Estensi–Spina,
because the projections in the Adriatic are more uncertain
than in the NW Mediterranean. Therefore, the 2100 horizon
could yield highly unreliable results.

At the Tordera Delta, the RCP8.5 estimates an increase of
0.73 m by 2100. Therefore, all 24 simulations described in
Sect. 3.2 were repeated with the projected future sea level.
Moreover, the potential beach accommodation to SLR was
modelled following Bosom (2014) and Jiménez et al. (2017).
This was accomplished assuming an equilibrium coastal pro-
file response following the Bruun rule (Bruun, 1962), re-
sulting in landward and upward displacement of the beach
profile. Dunes preserve the pre-SLR shape when there is
enough accommodation space, otherwise the shape is cut.
The estimated shoreline retreat due to the SLR in the area
is 22 m. Thus, morphological response to SLR is included
in the assessment. Finally, Casas-Prat and Sierra (2012) pre-
dicted a directional change in mean sea conditions from the
current dominant (E) to the secondary direction (S). This ef-
fect was explored by assessing only eastern incoming storms
in present conditions and imposing an equal frequency of

Figure 5. Risk reduction measures at Tordera Delta: receptor set-
backs (20, 50, and 75 m) and nourishment+ dune (beach nourish-
ment at Malgrat beach+ artificial dune at S’Abanell and Malgrat
beaches).

eastern and southern incoming storms in future projections.
Therefore, three different CCSs were explored: (i) CCS1 is
CUS+SLR with the corresponding estimated beach accom-
modation; (ii) CCS2 is CUS+ effect of direction switch of
incoming storms, and (iii) CCS3 is the assessment of the con-
tribution of both components if occurring at the same time.

In Lido degli Estensi–Spina, the combined contribution
of the predicted SLR with the subsidence component (not
negligible in the area; e.g. Taramelli et al., 2015) was imple-
mented. The resulting value of relative SLR by 2050 used in
the analysis is 0.30 m. The position of the MSL was changed
for all forcing events, adding the predicted relative SLR by
2050 in the CCS. The morphological accommodation to the
SLR was not implemented in the numerical analysis; how-
ever, the implication of this choice is discussed in Sect. 5.2.
In total, 24 additional simulations were run for the CCS.

3.5.2 Risk reduction alternatives in the case studies

Three risk reduction measures were tested for the Tordera
Delta zone (see Fig. 5): (i) receptor setback, (ii) flood re-
silience measures, and (iii) nourishment+ dune.

The receptor setback measure affects the exposure of the
receptors. It entails removing all receptors inside a defined
band measured from the public domain coastal limit (the
limit between the back of the beach and hinterland). Three
scenarios of the setback were simulated: 20, 50, and 75 m.

The flood resilience measures affect the vulnerability of
receptors so that for a given water depth, the expected impact
decreases when the measure is implemented. It was assumed
that resilience measures such as raised electricity outlets and
utilities, adapted flooring, resilient plaster, and waterproof
doors and windows were installed in all houses and camp-
site elements. This measure was implemented by assuming a
modified damage curve as shown in Table 4.

dune by beach scraping at Lido di Dante (Ravenna, Italy) (Harley,
2014); (c) representative model profiles at Lido di Spina north (orig-
inal: black solid line; with winter dune measure: red dashed line).

Finally, the nourishment+ dune changes the pathway and
affects the inundation/erosion hazard. It includes beach nour-
ishment at the south of the river mouth to increase the beach
width by 50 m over 1 km, where the highest erosion occurs.
In addition, the level at the top of the beach was increased on
both sides of the river mouth, with non-erodible sandbags at
the northern side, where the campsites are closer to the coast-
line, and a sandy dune at the southern side. At both sides,
the final height of the protective measure was+4.8 m a.m.s.l.
Since this measure affects the pathway, it had to be imple-
mented in the XBeach grid. Thus the 48 storms (24 current
MSL, 24 current MSL+SLR) were simulated again with the
edited morphology arriving to the final 96 simulations.

The selected measures tested for the Lido degli Estensi–
Spina case study were (i) a winter dune system, affecting
both flooding and erosion impacts, and therefore the hazards
modelling process and (ii) flood resilience measures, influ-
encing the flood vulnerability relations of receptors.

The winter dune (see Fig. 6) is a common risk reduc-
tion practice along the Emilia-Romagna coast, especially in
the Ravenna province (Harley and Ciavola, 2013), and reg-
ularly implemented by local concessionaires without a sci-
entifically based design criterion. It consists of a set of em-
bankments built on the beach in front of concessions through
beach scraping or sand replenishment (less frequent option).
This risk reduction measure was implemented in the XBeach
model. The winter dune was designed as a continuous dune
that protects more than one concession, introducing breaks in
the continuity of the feature where natural or human obsta-
cles or passages were located. The top of the dune was fixed
at 3 m a.m.s.l. and the width (at the top) at 10 m. The dune
was integrated in the model modifying the bed levels through

Figure 7. BN graph with four nodes.

the DuneMaker 2.0 tool (Harley, 2014). Both the CUS and
CCS were tested with this measure adding 48 additional sim-
ulations.

The flood resilience measures decrease the receptor’s
physical vulnerability to floods. It was assumed that the ef-
fective application of these measures would decrease the
damages for water levels lower than a certain threshold, as-
sumed here as 0.7 m (e.g. all electronics must be placed
above the threshold). This assumption was integrated in the
analysis by modifying the selected depth–damage curve, as
defined in Table 5b, and included in the BN. Considering the
adopted definition of flood risk levels (see Sect. 3.4.2), the
measure results in a complete obliteration of receptors for
the medium flood risk, therefore increasing the receptors at
the low level and not affecting receptors at high risk.

3.6 Bayesian-based decision network.

BNs use probability theory to describe the relationships be-
tween many variables and can evaluate how the evidence of
some variables influence other unobserved variables. For ex-
ample, evidence could be a forecast of the source variables
characterising an impending storm. In contrast, local hazards
and damages in the coastal area have not yet been observed,
but can be predicted with the BN. The model can also be up-
dated with artificial evidence to explore extreme event sce-
narios or investigate the potential of risk reduction plans.

A BN is based on a graph (Fig. 7). It consists of nodes con-
nected by arcs that represent random variables and the poten-
tial influences between them. The direction of the arcs is cru-
cial for the probabilistic reasoning algorithm of the BN, but
does not necessarily indicate causality. For any two variables
connected by an arc, the influencing one is called a parent,
while the one influenced is referred to as the child. Thus, in
Fig. 7, X1, X2, and X3 are the parents of X4. A simple way to
parameterise a BN is to discretise continuous variables after
defining their data range and to specify conditional probabil-
ity tables for each node. The authors adopted this approach.
The conditional probability tables indicate how much a vari-
able could be influenced by others. Mathematically, the graph
structure and conditional probability tables define the joint

distribution of all variables in the network, X1, . . . , Xn, based
on the factorisation of conditional probability distributions
(Eq. 1):

p(X1, . . .,Xn)=
n∏

i=1
p(Xi | pa(Xi)) , (1)

where pa(Xi) are the parents of node Xi (Pearl, 1988; Jensen,
1996). Once the joint distribution has been defined, the ef-
fects of any evidence can be propagated with efficient algo-
rithms throughout the network (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter,
1988).

In the RISC-KIT project, a generic structure for a BN-
based approach that can support decision-making in coastal
risk management was proposed. This structure is based on
the SPRC and has five components (node types): source
boundary condition, hazard, receptor, impact/consequence,
and risk reduction measure. Typically, each component in-
cludes several variables. Figure 4d shows their influence on
each other. In general, all boundary conditions influence all
hazards. Each type of receptor (e.g. people, buildings, infras-
tructure, and ecosystems) is represented by a node where dif-
ferent areas are the different bins (proxy for the locations of
receptors on the site). Hazard intensity is conditioned by the
location of the receptors and the presence of measures. Con-
sequences are conditioned by hazard intensity, receptor type
and presence of measures.

Alongside the generic structure, a C++ programme that
automatically creates the BN (https://github.com/openearth/
coastal-dss, last access: May 2018) is also provided. As in-
put, the programme requires variable definitions and land-
use data, vulnerability relationships, and a 2-D gridded sim-
ulation output of numerical physical process-based models
of hindcast or synthetic extreme event scenarios. Essentially,
the programme extracts the values of hazard variables from
the simulation output at the locations of every individual re-
ceptor so that hazard distributions for each receptor type can
be obtained. Because each simulation contains the coastal re-
sponse to one storm scenario under a specific set of measures,
the distributions are conditional and can be stored directly as
entries of the conditional probability tables associated with
each hazard node. Being parents of the hazard nodes, bound-
ary conditions, receptors’ areas, and risk reduction measures
define the dimensions of the conditional probability tables.
In the final step, the conditional hazard distributions were
transformed to conditional impact distributions with vulner-
ability steps. In the present application, the BN-based ap-
proach is applied assuming no prior knowledge on the statis-
tics of the source. Thus, all source variable combinations are
equally fed into the BN resulting as uniform distributions of
either Hs, duration, TWL, or direction. Each combination is
represented by two simulations of slightly different storms
to include some uncertainty due to intra-bin variability. No
other uncertainty is included. Therefore, the present appli-
cation is deterministic, a Bayesian-based decision network

which mainly uses the data assimilation capacity of the BN
as principle advantage with respect to other methodologies
(e.g. GIS-based assessments). Additionally, the BDN allows
also reverse assessments, where output variables (i.e. conse-
quences) can be constrained to get conditioned results on the
source variables. In the Discussion section further guidance
into a fully probabilistic BN approach integrating multiple
sources of uncertainty is presented.

3.6.1 BDN implementation at the case study sites

The schemes of the BDNs implemented for the Tordera Delta
and Lido degli Estensi–Spina case study sites are shown in
Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The nodes (circles) define the
variables of the network, while arcs (arrows) show the rela-
tions between the variables. The boundary conditions (blue),
and the location and distributions of the receptors (grey) af-
fect the hazards’ nodes (dark orange). The hazard is then
transformed through the vulnerability relations into conse-
quences (light orange). The measures’ nodes (green) can af-
fect different node types depending on the effect (by defini-
tion) of the measure. The structure is very flexible and can
be applied at different coastal settings. The scheme can be
adapted with different boundary conditions, hazards, recep-
tors, consequences, and measures, depending on the needs
driven by research and/or coastal management objectives. It
follows that, for very similar coasts, or even for the same case
study, the scheme can differ. The variables and bin ranges
characterising boundary conditions are pre-selected by the
user. Bins are equidistant and covering the observed values at
each study site (Table 1). Additional non-observed ranges are
introduced to account for SLR. The used number of intervals
is a compromise between accuracy and computational effort.
A total number of 96 model runs were required for the ap-
plied setup at each case study site. As a reference, using par-
allel simulations with 48 threads, the ratio computation time
over real storm time was ∼ 0.2, meaning that a 40 h storm
takes ∼ 8 h of simulation time.

4 Results

The results of scenario testing are provided for each case
study through an integrated comparison of percentages of re-
ceptors at each level of flooding and erosion risks. This is
done by comparing the risk levels under current and CCSs,
with and without measures. The results of the scenarios that
will be presented in the following sections are produced by
integrating in subsets all 96 simulations at each study site.

Figure 10 shows an example of the integration of simula-
tions at the Tordera Delta considering the CUS without mea-
sures. The figure includes three boxes with different level of
(un)constrained boundary conditions and corresponding re-
sults in terms of erosion risk to infrastructures. In box A, both
Hs and storm duration are constrained to a specific bin (in

In box B, Hs is unconstrained while duration is constrained

boundary condition is uniform when unconstrained). This
approach is adequate to explore scenarios and to assess the
efficiency of protection measures in terms of impact reduc-
tion.

4.1 Tordera Delta

The result assessment was performed separately for both
sides of the river at S’Abanell beach at the north and Mal-
grat beach at the south. The inundation impact assessment
considered all receptors at the study site whereas the erosion
analysis focused only on the first 20 m band of hinterland
because the only receptors exposed to an erosion hazard are
located in that area.

The results of the flooding impacts, here presented for
campsite elements, indicate that under current conditions, re-
ceptors at both sides of the river mouth are expected to suffer
the same magnitude of damages: 80–83 % of elements will

be safe, while only 2–3 % of the elements are under high-
impact risk (Fig. 11).

Under CCSs, a different behaviour at each side of the river
mouth is detected. Southwards of the river mouth, the beach
is highly sensitive to changes in both storm direction and
SLR (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, when CCS3 conditions are
analysed in Malgrat, the BDN indicates that 69 % of campsite
elements are affected, with 41 % being at high risk. In con-
trast, the beach at the north (S’Abanell) is highly sensitive
to SLR (CCS1, Fig. 11) but it is not affected by a potential
change in storm direction (CCS2 and CCS3, Fig. 12).

Comparing the effectiveness of the risk reduction mea-
sures highlights nourishment+ dune as the most effective
one against flooding under current and climate change sce-
narios. As expected, the effectiveness is higher in Malgrat
than in S’Abanell, as beach nourishment is located only south
of the river mouth whereas the dune is present on both sides.
It was observed that all significant impacts (medium and
high) to receptors under current scenario were removed for
both sides of the river. Moreover, at Malgrat, the number
of affected receptors was reduced by ∼ 20 % for the CUS,
CCS1, and CCS2 scenarios and ∼ 40 % under CCS3.

The implementation of the flood resilience measures was
effective in terms of preventing high impacts on any receptor,
but did not significantly reduce the total number of receptors
affected by some level of risk. The magnitude of reduction of
receptors at risk was ∼ 9 %. It should be mentioned that this
is a theoretical measure, as we assumed that it is properly de-
signed, implemented, and 100 % effective for site conditions.

Finally, three receptor setbacks were tested: 20, 50, and
75 m. The results indicate that only the 75 m setback demon-
strated a risk reduction magnitude comparable to nour-
ishment+ dune; however, the efficiency of the nourish-
ment+ dune was in general higher than the managed retreat.
Only in S’Abanell, with higher topography and where the
measure only consists of a dune without nourishment, was a
greater risk reduction achieved through the 75 m setback.

spectively).

Results for the erosion impact risk assessment showed
similar results for the three analysed receptor categories and
no significant differences between CUS and CC2 or between
CC1 and CC3. For simplicity, results related to Infrastructure
(Fig. 13), for the CUS and CC1 scenarios are provided in the
following.

Under the CUS, the promenade at the north of the river
mouth is at significant risk (70 % at medium risk and 13 %
at high risk), whereas the road in Malgrat is potentially safe.
In the CCS1 scenario, the assessment highlights that because
of the increase of sea level and corresponding morphologi-
cal accommodation, the percentage of promenade under high
risk and therefore direct erosion at the toe increases up to
33 %, with some impact appearing on the road in Malgrat.

The assessment of the efficiency of the measures regard-
ing erosion indicates that the nourishment+ dune does not
have a significant impact on reducing risk. In addition, the
beach nourishment is regularly washed out in severe storm
conditions. The only case where the nourishment plays some
protective role is at the road in Malgrat, where the measure
prevents the impact in CCS1. In contrast, receptor setback
is 100 % effective in dealing with the impact of erosion, and
a 20 m retreat (measured from beach limit in current condi-
tions) is enough to cope with risk under the present situation
and for all future projected conditions at both sides of the
river mouth.

The overall results for flooding and erosion risks on conces-
sions are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. Focusing on the flooding
risk (Fig. 14), the CUS evidenced noticeable impacts, with
Lido di Spina presenting the larger number of receptors at

risk and with higher intensity. The presence of a CCS exac-
erbates expected impacts.

The winter dune system had a positive impact in all cases,
with the number of concessions at risk decreasing to 10 %
(only low risk) at Lido degli Estensi and 13 % at low and
3 % at medium risk at Lido di Spina. This measure was also
effective to reduce the risk under the CCS.

The flood resilience measures had positive effects on im-
pacts by moving all receptors at medium risk to the low risk
category. However, by definition, it had no effect on lowering
the fraction of receptors presenting, in the current situation,
low and high levels of risk.

With respect to erosion-induced impacts, obtained results
indicate a lower level of risk than the identified for flooding,
with only the 8 and 14 % of concessions being at risk at Lido
degli Estensi and Lido di Spina, respectively (Fig. 15). These
percentages increase up to 11 and 30 %, respectively, when
the CCS is considered.

The effectiveness of the winter dune system as a risk re-
duction measure is demonstrated by the observed decrease
in the number of potentially damaged concessions at Lido
di Spina under both climate scenarios. However, at Lido
degli Estensi this measure increases the number of poten-
tially damaged receptors. Simulation results show that when
the dune is present with concessions close at its rear, and the
storm overcomes the measure, water arrives with enough ve-
locity to produce scouring at the first concessions.

A further step in the analysis of risk scenarios was un-
dertaken using the BDN in reverse mode, i.e. looking at the
distribution of the boundary conditions given a certain distri-
bution of flood damage to concessions at Lido degli Estensi–
Spina, both with and without winter dune. Flood damage to
concessions is constrained in the BDN to equal fractions of
low, medium, and high risk. This can be understood as a

scenario at Lido degli Estensi; (c) current scenario at Lido di Spina;

sures).

qualitative scenario were all receptors suffer some damage,
and the intensity of the damage is uniformly distributed. The
BDN outputs the fractions of boundary conditions which are
likely to produce the constrained impacts, according to the
introduced data.

Notably, under current scenario and without measure, the
Hs is distributed more uniformly compared to the TWL
(Fig. 16), which demonstrates a strong increasing tendency.
This indicates that compared to wave conditions, the water
level is the main driver for flood impacts.

The results for the winter dune scenario showed that
the largest fraction of conditions leading to flood dam-
ages to concessions are TWL > 1.45 m (93 %) and Hs > 4 m
(4 < Hs < 5 m: 47 %; 5 < Hs < 6 m: 43 %). These results in-
dicated that the winter dune is effective to minimise the
consequences of coastal storms with TWL < 1.45 m and
Hs < 4 m in the current situation.

When the analysis was performed under the CCS (Fig. 17)
the situation without measure demonstrated an even lower
influence of Hs on flood consequences to concessions, since
a more uniform distribution of this variable is obtained. As
expected, the relative SLR (+0.3 m; RCP8.5 by 2050) in-
creased the risk of lower-intensity storms. Thus, in general,
under the CCS, all storm combinations generated flood con-
sequences to concessions.

The results for the winter dune in the CCS showed that
the influence of the dune system is less effective than in cur-
rent conditions. Lower-intensity storms can now lead to flood
damages to concessions (TWL < 1.45 m: 25 %; Hs < 4 m:
32 %). This explains the observed decrease in effective-
ness of the measure in future conditions when compared to
present conditions.

5 Discussion

The framework of the present study is appropriate for the pre-
vention phase of the disaster management cycle. In this con-
text, it has been applied to support decisions for coastal risk
management by facilitating intercomparison of risk reduction
strategic alternatives. This comparison was performed for a
large set of simulations, covering many (current and future)
conditions and multiple hazards. The presented work is part
of a larger investigatory process (see Martinez et al., 2018)
where stakeholders and end users were interviewed to select
possible measures for critical coastal areas (i.e. local scale).
The objective of the present work was to provide rather sim-
ple information on the efficiency of measures to be used in a
participatory process (see Barquet and Cumiskey, 2018) aim-
ing at selecting acceptable measures to be applied as part of
an integrated local strategy for risk reduction. The analysis
has some inherent uncertainties associated with the imple-

mentation of the steps of the SPRC model, which are identi-
fied and discussed in what follows.

With respect to the definition of sources, the BN approach
has been built by chosen storm variables limited to those pre-
viously identified as the most important to control the magni-
tude of storm-induced hazards at each site. Once identified,
they were discretised in equal intervals covering the whole
range of values observed so far. A limited number of com-
binations has been used to cover the most important storm
classes in terms of induced hazards and damages (Armaroli
et al., 2009, 2012; Mendoza et al., 2011). Increasing num-
ber of variables and/or variable resolution will allow us to
better reproduce the inherent climate variability and to char-
acterise better this source of uncertainty in the assessment.
In spite of this, used values can be considered as representa-
tive for forcing source in both areas and, in this sense, they
will allow us to use the framework to assess the efficiency
of tested measures to reduce inundation and erosion risks for
each given condition. No prior knowledge of storm charac-
teristic variables was assumed, representing them with uni-
form distributions. Thus, the current application, the BDN,
was essentially deterministic. This was enough to commu-
nicate scenarios and measure efficiencies to stakeholders by
integrating the BDN in a multi-criteria analysis such as that
presented in Barquet and Cumiskey (2018). In such multi-
criteria assessments, the BDN output is combined with infor-
mation on additional elements required for decision-making
such as economics, endurance, ecological, stakeholders’ per-
ception, allowing for the final evaluation of alternatives. As it
has been mentioned before, the next step should be to repro-
duce the local maritime climate to analyse this performance,
taking into account the relative frequency of each condition.
In such a case, the BN approach would be fully probabilistic.
In addition, using time series data on real historical events
would reduce the uncertainties introduced by representing
some events with synthetic design shapes.

Uncertainties associated with the pathway are related to
the selection of the process-oriented models used to simulate
induced hazards. In the current analysis, we have not consid-
ered this source of uncertainty since the framework is applied
by using previously selected models and recommended dam-
age curves. As it was mentioned in the method section, the
selected model to simulate storm-induced hazards is XBeach
(Roelvink et al., 2009), which is currently one of the most
applied at the international level. Applied model setting has
been selected for each case study based on local calibrations
and validations for selected storm impacts. This step must be
done prior to BN development since it will control the ac-
curacy of hazard estimation and it is also a source of uncer-
tainty. In any case, the methodology can easily deal with this
source of uncertainty if simulations from multiple models or
model settings are used to feed the BN.

Another point to be considered is that this assessment
framework has been designed to analyse the storm-induced
coastal response. This implies that used models do not fore-

cast the coastal morphology at a given time (where it should
be necessary to couple all governing processes) but pre-
dict the expected storm-induced changes for a given coastal
configuration. As storm-induced hazards depend on existing
morphology at the time of the impact (e.g. Cohn and Rug-
giero, 2016), the initial morphology used in the model is also
a source of uncertainty. To overcome this, a long-/medium-
term morphological model (Hanson et al., 2003; Lesser et
al., 2004) could be used to forecast the future coastal mor-
phology under a given climate scenario at a given time and
then, to use it as the initial configuration to assess storm-
induced changes. This has been illustrated here by consid-
ering the change in estimated risks due to SLR in Tordera
Delta. This approach can also be applied to assess the effects
of consecutive storm impacts (Coco et al., 2014) by using es-
timated post-storm bed levels as pre-storm morphology for
given storm combinations. Once this extra information is in-
cluded in the BN, the uncertainty associated to future shore-
line configurations on assessed risks can be analysed.

Regarding receptors, their location and typology have little
associated uncertainty, except for future projections, where it
was not considered (i.e. type and location of receptors remain
constant in time). Houses, promenades, and fixed elements
were derived from accurate land-use and cadastral data avail-
able for the sites. Moreover, campsite elements were man-
ually located and delimited from available GIS-based tools
and raster imagery. In spite of this, some uncertainty asso-
ciated with the mobility of campsite elements between sea-
sons, as well as to land-use changes or new developments,
remains. In the case of temporary elements, the worst case
scenario was considered; i.e. they are assumed to be present
at any space allocated to them. This implies that maximum
potential damage was estimated. This could be modified by
considering the existing time lag between intensive tourist
use of beaches (and consequently in campsites or conces-
sions) and storms seasonality (e.g. Valdemoro and Jiménez,
2006). The existing lag can be used to modify or reduce the
exposure of this temporary elements to storm impacts.

With respect to the consequences, expected damages due
to inundation have been estimated by using damage curves.
Although this is a standard approach for this type of anal-
ysis (see e.g. Penning-Rowsell et al., 2013), the damage
curves used have been recommended by Agència Catalana
del ’Aigua (2014) and Scorzini and Frank (2015) for river
flooding in Catalonia and Italy, respectively. The absence of
specific damage curves estimated for analysed process and
existing elements also introduces uncertainty, although in
this case it is already assumed by the corresponding adminis-
trations since they are recommending its use. The equivalent
for expected damages due to erosion was set in terms of an
erosion buffer, which represents the protective function of
the beach against the direct impact of waves. As it was pre-
viously shown, this buffer was selected specifically for each
site and, similarly to damage curves, it must be defined ac-
cording to local conditions.

Regarding the inclusion of the risk reduction measures in
the analysis, it is assumed that protective strategies are com-
pletely and efficiently implemented when storm events oc-
cur. In the case of flood resilience measures, this implies that
all existing elements in each site (from campsites to build-
ings) implemented flood-proofing measures. However, local,
social, and economic conditions will influence its real imple-
mentation (see e.g. Bubeck et al., 2013) and, in any case, this
assumption clearly overestimate its efficiency.

When setback definition and retreat is the adopted strategy,
the used approach to characterise the initial coastal morphol-
ogy also has implications on the results consideration. This
implies that the effectiveness of the retreat is just measured
with respect to the storm reach. To be efficient in time, the
existence of any additional mid- and long-term background
erosion, as it is the case of the Tordera site (Jiménez et al.,
2018), should be included to properly define the required set-
back (e.g. Sano et al., 2011).

This also applies to infrastructural measures, which are
considered to be implemented at the time of the storm im-
pact. In the case of the combined nourishment–dune solu-
tion considered in the Tordera case, this would imply that to
maintain its efficiency in time, the beach would have to be
renourished after each storm impact to maintain the 50 m in-
crease in beach width. This also affects the efficiency of the
winter dune tested in the Italian case, which strictly depends
on the beach width before the storm impact. In this sense,
Harley and Ciavola (2013) indicate that the dune height and
crest width required to protect the area should be designed
differently for different coastal stretches along the study site.
From the coastal manager standpoint, this implies that to
properly assess their performance in the future, background
processes must be considered to account additional losses in
beach nourishment in the Tordera (e.g. Jiménez et al., 2011)
or in beach width variations along the Italian case (Armaroli
et al., 2012).

Assessed risks under current conditions at both locations
are consistent with already observed impacts. At the Tordera
site, erosion and direct wave impact problems are the main
issue for campsites and existing infrastructures (Jiménez et
al., 2011, 2017b). At the Italian case, flooding is the dom-
inant hazard with assessed impacts being comparable with
previous observations (e.g. Perini et al., 2016).

As a result of the combination of hazard and site charac-
teristics, a notable increase of the assessed impacts is pre-
dicted for both sites when SLR is considered. At the Tordera
delta, overall results indicate a doubling of expected flooding
impacts. Moreover, erosion impacts will increase even fur-
ther since the induced retreat will immediately imply an in-
crease in receptor exposure. This behaviour is similar to the
observed increase in damages due to the present background
erosion, where campsites located in unprotected areas have
been progressively losing space at the seaward boundary, and
the existing promenade has suffered frequent damages dur-
ing the last decades (Jiménez et al., 2011). At the Italian case

study, SLR and subsidence effects are mainly identified in
flooding risk which will be significantly larger. However, al-
though erosion risk will also increase, it will remain rela-
tively low. This lower increase is caused by both a closer fu-
ture projection compared to Tordera and by the effect of not
including the morphological response to SLR since, in this
case, the future scenario was only characterised by increas-
ing the position of the MSL.

When considering SLR-induced effects on time evolution
of storm-induced risks, existing uncertainties must be also
taken into account. Thus, the first uncertainty is related to
the magnitude of the change itself. Here the RCP8.5 SLR
projection was used, but other scenarios could be possible
(Church et al., 2013). The other source of uncertainty is con-
trolled by the way in which this forcing is translated into the
system. In this work the Bruun rule was assumed to be valid
and it was used to generate a morphological accommodation
of the Tordera Delta site to SLR. Since there is no consensus
on the best model to simulate this effect, other existing mod-
els and approaches (see e.g. Le Cozannet et al., 2014) could
be tested and integrated in the BN to include this source of
uncertainty. In any case, the effect of the uncertainty on the
SLR projections may be larger than their associated morpho-
logical response.

In spite of the sources of uncertainty previously men-
tioned, this analysis has permitted us to identify the most
harmful conditions to induce storm-related inundation and
erosion risks at the two study sites, to identify which are
the most affected receptors, and to compare the efficiency
of different risk reduction strategies. This has been done by
considering both hazards in a separated manner, which is
an advantage for the manager since damage induced by ero-
sion and inundation differs in characteristics and needs to be
afforded in a specific manner. Although this can be a valu-
able tool for decision-making in storm-induced risk manage-
ment, it must be further complemented with a similar anal-
ysis including the reproduction of the statistical structure of
storms in combination with a socioeconomic valuation such
as multi-criteria analysis to properly make final decisions. In
this sense, this analysis can be used as the first step to identify
the most relevant risks and strategies to be further tested.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, a methodological framework for storm-induced
coastal risk management purposes developed within the
framework of the RISC-KIT EU project was presented
and applied in two sites in the NW Mediterranean and
N Adriatic coasts. The study is based on the integration
of the SPRC model in a BN-based approach. This was
fed with a large number of numerical simulations obtained
through process-oriented model chain able to simulate mul-
tiple storm-induced hazards at the receptor scale. The BN
integrates impact results that individually account for all re-

ceptors in the hinterland. Once developed, the BN can be
regularly updated with additional simulations and further ex-
tended with new scenarios.

The presented application, a Bayesian-based decision net-
work, has been fed with storms covering the range of repre-
sentative conditions at both study sites and uniform distribu-
tion of source variables. This permitted us to assess in a de-
terministic way, the performance of different risk reduction
strategies to individual hazards and under different climate
scenarios.

In spite of not statistically mimicking the maritime cli-
mate, the approach demonstrated impact responses in the
current situation in accordance with existing knowledge at
both sites. Tordera Delta, which is characterised by quick
and intense erosive responses to storms, showed greater im-
pacts to erosion than Lido degli Estensi–Spina and they were
essentially concentrated in infrastructure located just behind
the beach. As expected, the flooding impact in the current sit-
uation is higher for receptors located closest to the shoreline
or at the lowest elevation areas of the hinterland (i.e. conces-
sions at Lido di Spina and campsites at Malgrat).

The estimated risk significantly increases for the cli-
mate change scenario. The morphological accommodation
response to the projected MSL, which was only included at
the Tordera Delta, was identified as a major process to be
considered in the impact assessment to properly account for
modifications in erosion and inundation hazards.

From the tested risk reduction strategies, the construction
of artificial dunes was identified as very effective for inunda-
tion at both study sites, whereas its efficiency for managing
erosion was lower. In contrast, and as expected, setback def-
inition and managed retreat seems to be the best option to
tackle the impacts of erosion.

Finally, the developed framework has proven to be effi-
cient to analyse storm-induced risks and strategies to cope
with them. Moreover, a series of elements to be addressed to
further improve it and to extend its applicability have been
identified and discussed. In this sense, the BN approach is
a versatile tool to make robust comparisons across different
conditions.
