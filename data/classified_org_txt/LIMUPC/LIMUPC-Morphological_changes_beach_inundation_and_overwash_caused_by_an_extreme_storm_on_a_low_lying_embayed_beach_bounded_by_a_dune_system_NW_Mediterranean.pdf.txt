Abstract: The geomorphological evolution of a low-lying, micro-tidal 

sandy beach in the western Mediterranean, the Pals beach, was 

characterized using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. 

Data were collected in prior to, and six months after, the impact of an 

extreme storm with a return period of 50 years with the aim of 

characterizing the beach's response to the storm. The use of repeated 

high-resolution topographic data to quantify beach geomorphic changes has 

allowed assessing the accuracy of different proxies for estimating beach 

volume changes. Results revealed that changes in the shoreline position 

cannot accurately reproduce beach volume changes in low-lying beaches 

where overwash processes are significant. Observations also suggested 

that volume estimations from beach profiles do not accurately represent 

subaerial volume changes at large profile distances in beaches with 

significant alongshore geomorphological variability. Accordingly, the 

segmentation of the beach into regularly spaced bins is proposed to 

assess alongshore variations in the beach volume with the accuracy of the 

topographic data.  

The morphological evolution of Pals beach during the study period showed 

a net shoreline retreat (-4 m) and a significant sediment gain on the 

subaerial beach (+7.5 m3/m). The net gain of sediment is mostly due to 

the impact of the extreme storm, driving significant overwash processes 

that transport sediment landwards, increasing volume on the backshore and 

dunes. The increase of volume on the foreshore and the presence of 

cuspate morphologies along the shoreline also evidence post-storm beach 

recovery. Observed morphological changes exhibit a high variability along 

the beach related to variations in the beach morphology. Changes in the 

morphology and migration of megacusps result in a high variability in the 

shoreline position and foreshore volume changes. On the other hand, 

larger morphological changes on the backshore and larger inundation 

distances occur when the beach and the dunes are lower, favouring the 

dominance of overwash. The observed storm-induced morphological changes 

differ from predicted beach storm impacts because of spatial and temporal 

variations in the beach morphology, suggesting that detailed 



morphological parameters and indicators used for predicting beach 

vulnerability to storms should be regularly updated in order to represent 

the pre-storm beach conditions. Finally, observed morphological changes 

in the Pals Bay evidenced a different behaviour between natural and urban 

areas, with better post-storm beach recovery on natural areas where the 

beach is not artificially narrowed.

Abstract  10 

The geomorphological evolution of a low-lying, micro-tidal sandy beach in the western 11 

Mediterranean, Pals beach, was characterized using airborne Light Detection and Ranging 12 

(LiDAR) data. Data were collected in prior to and six months after the impact of an extreme 13 

storm with a return period of approx. 50 years, with the aim of characterizing the beach’s 14 

response to the storm. The use of repeated high-resolution topographic data to quantify beach 15 

geomorphic changes has allowed assessment of the accuracy of different proxies for estimating 16 

beach volume changes. Results revealed that changes in the shoreline position cannot accurately 17 

reproduce beach volume changes on low-lying beaches where overwash processes are 18 

significant. Observations also suggested that volume estimations from beach profiles do not 19 

accurately represent subaerial volume changes at large profile distances on beaches with 20 

significant alongshore geomorphological variability. Accordingly, the segmentation of the 21 

beach into regularly spaced bins is proposed to assess alongshore variations in the beach volume 22 

with the accuracy of the topographic data. The morphological evolution of Pals beach during the 23 

study period showed a net shoreline retreat (-4 m) and a significant sediment gain on the 24 

subaerial beach (+7.5 m

extreme storm, driving significant overwash processes that transport sediment landwards, 26

increasing volume on the backshore and dunes. The increase of volume on the foreshore and the 27 

presence of cuspate morphologies along the shoreline also evidence post-storm beach recovery. 28 

Observed morphological changes exhibit a high variability along the beach related to variations 29 

in beach morphology. Changes in the morphology and migration of megacusps result in a high 30 

variability in the shoreline position and foreshore volume changes. On the other hand, larger 31 

morphological changes on the backshore and larger inundation distances occur when the beach 32 

and the dunes are lower, favouring the dominance of overwash. The observed storm-induced 33 

morphological changes differ from predicted beach storm impacts because of spatial and 34 

temporal variations in the beach morphology, suggesting that detailed morphological parameters 35 

and indicators used for predicting beach vulnerability to storms should be regularly updated in 36 

order to represent the pre-storm beach conditions. Finally, observed morphological changes in 37 

Pals Bay evidenced a different behaviour between natural and urban areas, with better post-38 

storm beach recovery on natural areas where the beach is not artificially narrowed. 39

1. Introduction 43 

Understanding how low-lying coasts respond to storms is crucial for assessing the vulnerability 44 

of these areas to natural hazards and developing tools and management approaches to reduce 45 

risk and increase coastal resilience. Low-lying coasts are highly sensitive to storm-induced 46 

hazards such as beach erosion, breaching of the dune system, overwash and inundation (e.g. 47 

Sallenger, 2000; Morton, 2002). Furthermore, human activities such as flow regulation of river 48 

systems, coastal construction and tourism add additional pressure on the coastal system by 49 

increasing vulnerability in already highly vulnerable areas (Morton et al., 1994; Willis and 50 

Griggs, 2003; Richter et al., 2013). In relation to climate change, low-lying coasts are 51 

particularly vulnerable because of rising sea levels and accelerated coastal erosion (Nicholls et 52 



3 

al., 2014). Sea-level rise will raise storm-induced maximum water levels (Fiore et al., 2009), 53 

enhancing the impact of storms by increasing the potential for erosion and coastal flooding 54 

(Zhang et al., 2002). Assessing vulnerability to inundation of these areas by identifying coastal 55 

areas at risk of flooding and defining flood extent is therefore a key issue at both European and 56 

global level. In Europe, the assessment of flood risks is dealt with in the European Flooding 57 

Directive 2007/60/EC and the Protocol of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (PAP/RAC, 58 

2007).  59 

The vulnerability of a coast to inundation during storms depends on the morphology of the 60 

beach and dune relative to the intensity of the ocean's forcing (Wright and Short, 1984; 61 

Sallenger, 2000). Even in the context of steady forcing, some areas of the beach may experience 62 

severe erosion and/or overwash while adjacent areas may appear unaffected, mostly due to the 63 

spatial variability of the beach width and slope, or the dune elevation (Sallenger et al., 2003; 64 

Stockdon et al., 2007). Recent studies have found that foredune accretion is dominant in wider 65 

and low-gradient beaches while eroding dunes are associated with narrower, steeper beaches 66 

(Saye et al., 2005; Keijpers et al., 2014). Similarly, small variations in the elevation, volume and 67 

alongshore extent of the foredune also lead to a more spatially variable beach response to storms 68 

(Sallenger, 2000; Houser et al., 2008, 2015). In locations where storm-induced water levels 69 

exceed the crest of the dune or the dune is breached, sediment is transported landward as 70 

overwash and deposited on the backdunes (Sallenger, 2000; Stockdon et al., 2007; de Vries et 71 

al., 2008). The detailed assessment of the magnitude and alongshore variability of the beach 72 

response to storms is therefore required to accurately predict the coastal response to storms and 73 

to identify areas at risk of erosion and flooding. 74 

Remote sensing techniques such as airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) are now commonly used to 75 

quantify storm-induced morphological changes and post-storm beach recovery (e.g. Zhang et 76 

al., 2005; Stockdon et al., 2009; Keijpers et al., 2014; among others). LiDAR technology 77 

provides elevation data with high vertical accuracy (less than 20 cm) and horizontal resolution 78 

(about 50 cm), high point density and large coverage areas (400 m of swath wide), which 79 



4 

resolve the small-scale variability of the beach and dune morphology for an accurate assessment 80 

of coastal vulnerability during storms (Sallenger et al., 2003). In addition, the highly automated 81 

aspect of LiDAR collection lends itself to resampling areas quickly and efficiently, which is 82 

particularly important in the coastal zone, where storm-induced changes can be dramatic and 83 

rapid.  84 

The aim of this paper is to characterize and quantify the impact of an ‘extreme’ storm and the 85 

post-storm recovery of a large bay on the NW Mediterranean coast, Pals Bay, using LiDAR-86 

derived topographic data collected prior to and six months after the storm. The morphological 87 

evolution of the backshore during the study period is primarily due to the extreme storm. 88 

Conversely, the recorded changes in the foreshore are also influenced by other storms of smaller 89 

magnitude, as well as the post-storm beach recovery. Thus, only morphological changes 90 

occurred at elevations higher than the maximum storm-induced water during the moderate 91 

storms are associated to the impact of the extreme storm. More specifically, this work aims to: 92 

(i) evaluate the beach’s response to the impact of the storm by characterizing morphological 93 

changes between both surveys; (ii) quantify the maximum observed inundation and compare it 94 

with predicted vulnerability to storm-induced inundation; and (iii) assess the anthropogenic 95 

influence on the beach response.  96 

2. Field site 97 

Pals Bay, on the northern coast of Catalonia (NW Mediterranean), is a low topographic coast 98 

bounded by two rocky headlands, the Montgrí massif to the north and Cape Begur to the south 99 

(Fig. 1A). It belongs to the Baix Empordà littoral plain, which includes extensive marshes, river 100 

channels, a complex dune system, urbanized areas such as L’Estartit, Els Griells, El Mas Pinell 101 

and Pals beach golf course, and embayed beaches (Figs. 1B, 1C). Much of the littoral plain is 102 

currently considered a protected area at regional and European levels because of its great natural 103 

value (Fig. 1B).  104

Two rivers flow into Pals Bay: the Ter River, which is 212 km long and has a draining area of 105 

about 3000 km
2
, and the Daro River, which is 35 km long and has a drainage area of 300 km

2 
106 

(Fig. 1A) (ACA, 2002; Liquete et al., 2009). These rivers have a typical Mediterranean 107 

torrential regime, with most of the discharge concentrated in short-lived flood events, 108 

particularly between December and February (Sabater et al., 1992; Liquete et al., 2009). During 109 

the study period, the highest river flow (120 m

 in the Ter River and 7.6 m

 in the Daro 110 

River) was recorded on 26 December 2008 and was associated with heavy rainfall of up to 3.36 111 

mm h
-1 

recorded by the Girona rain gauge (Fig. 2). Changes in the course of these rivers 112 

together with the local geomorphology and anthropogenic activities played an important role in 113 

the formation and evolution of the Baix Empordà dune system (Cros and Serra, 1993). The main 114 

changes in the Ter River course have occurred during the last millennium as a result of periods 115 

of high fluvial activity, widespread deforestation and accelerated sedimentation (Marqués and 116 

Julià, 2005). The main course of the Ter River frequently changed along two active channels 117 

from a river bifurcation at the Verges site (Montaner et al., 2010). The northern branch flowed 118 

into the Roses Bay, contributing to the sedimentary infill of the Alt Empordà littoral plain and 119 

acting as a natural barrier to the sediment transported by northern winds (Fig. 1B). In the early 120 

14
th
 century AD, the avulsion of the Ter River at Verges produced the abandonment of the 121 

northern branch in favour of the eastern course (Montaner Roviras and Solà Subiranas, 2004), 122 

contributing to the progressive infill of the Baix Empordà plain and the formation of the Baix 123 

Empordà dune system (Marqués and Llulià, 2005). At present, the configuration of the dune 124 

system is controlled by the strong northern winds, the west-east orientation of the main river 125 

courses and the presence of local topographic highs such as the Montgrí massif and Cape Begur, 126 

which act as natural barriers against aeolian processes (Fig. 1B).  127 

Pals Bay is characterized by a large sandy beach, named hereafter Pals beach, and two small 128 

pocket beaches, Illa Roja and Sa Riera (Fig. 1B). Pals beach is a typical embayed beach 129 

extending 6800 m from L’Estartit to Cape Begur (Fig. 1B). The beach width is highly variable 130 

alongshore between 25 m at Els Griells and 130 m in the south (Fig. 1C). Sediment grain size 131 



6 

shows high spatial variability, with a median grain size (d50) ranging between 230 μm in the 132 

north and 1260 μm in the south (CIIRC, 2010). This trend in the grain is reflected in the beach 133 

slope and the berm height, which also increases southward from 1.3 m at L’Estartit to 2.7-3.2 m 134 

in the southernmost sector of the beach (CIIRC, 2010). Pals beach is backed by a discontinuous 135 

vegetated foredune that covers an area of 205,000 m
2
, with a predominant NNW-SSE 136 

orientation. The dunes show a variable height along the beach, varying from 0.5-1.5 m in the 137 

north to 3.5 m in the south. Illa Roja and Sa Riera are small pocket beaches located in the 138 

southern part of Pals Bay and bounded by 45 m-high cliffs (Fig. 1B). Illa Roja has a length of 139 

185 m, a variable width (8-35 m), and a mean grain size of 1670 μm. Sa Riera has a length of 140 

186 m, a variable width (50-95 m), and a mean grain size of 1770 μm (CIIRC, 2010). 141 

Pals Bay is a microtidal environment with a tidal range of about 0.2 m. Dominant winds in the 142 

area are from the north and northwest in December and January and from the south and east in 143 

February, March, April and November. High velocities have been recorded for marine winds (E 144 

winds) during storm conditions associated with cyclonic activity over the NW Mediterranean 145 

(Font, 1990). Wave climate in the region is highly seasonal, with the severest conditions usually 146 

occurring from late autumn to early spring (Bolaños et al., 2009). Statistical analysis of wave 147 

conditions in the region showed a yearly mean significant wave height (Hs) of 0.77 m with a 148 

maximum Hs of 7.8 m (Mendoza et al., 2011). Storms with Hs between 3.5 and 4.25 m are the 149 

most frequent, but severe events (Hs up to 5) and even extreme events (Hs higher than 5 m) are 150 

also recorded. Severe and extreme storms have a predominant easterly direction, whereas less 151 

energetic storms arrive from the south (Mendoza et al., 2011).  152 

3. Data sets and methods 153 

3.1 Storm-induced water levels  154 

Storm-induced water levels (Rlow and Rhigh) were calculated to characterize fluid forcing during 155 

the study period, and particularly at the peak of the extreme storm. Rlow is the sum of the 156 

astronomical tide, storm surge and wave-induced setup (ƞ),  as proposed by Stockdon et al. 157 



7 

(2007) (Fig. 3). Rhigh represents the highest elevation of the landward margin of swash relative 158 

to a fixed vertical datum. It includes the combined effects of the astronomical tide, storm surge 159 

and the wave-induced runup (R2%) (Sallenger, 2000; Stockdon et al., 2007) (Fig. 3). The 160 

elevation of R2% was calculated from offshore wave conditions using Stockdon’s empirical 161 

parametrization (Stockdon et al., 2006), which includes both wave-induced setup and swash and 162 

is given by  163 

                       
  

          
         

         

 
 ,    (1) 164 

where βf is the foreshore slope, defined as the average slope over the portion of the beach 165 

extending from the shoreline to the crest berm, Hs is the significant wave height, and Tp the 166 

associated peak period.  167 

Rhigh was calculated over the study period considering the mean foreshore slope of the beach (βf 168 

= 0.11 ± 0.03) to characterized the storms occurring during the study period, and particularly the 169 

most energetic storm. To assess the spatially variable coastal response and to compared it with 170 

the storm-impact scaling model presented by Sallenger (2000), the foreshore slope (βf) and 171 

storm-induced extreme water levels (Rlow and Rhigh) were also calculated along the beach from 172 

cross-shore profiles evenly spaced (1 m) in the alongshore direction, considering three different 173 

wave conditions: calm weather, the extreme storm and other moderate storms that occurred 174 

during the study period. 175 

Still water levels (WL) were derived from tide gauge records (every 2 hours) at L’Estartit 176 

harbour (Fig. 1B). It includes both astronomical tide and storm surge. Wave data were recorded 177 

by the Palamós wave buoy (Puertos del Estado, www.puertos.es), which is located 178 

approximately 4.5 km offshore, at 90 m depth (Fig. 1A). The Palamós wave buoy has been 179 

operated since the end of the 1980s, recoding data every hour. The data used in this study 180 

include significant wave height (Hs) and peak period (Tp) calculated for 24 minute recordings 181 

taken every hour, with a sampling frequency of 4 Hz. 182

3.2 LiDAR data 183 

Morphological changes in the study area were quantified using LiDAR-derived beach 184 

topography complemented with high-resolution (0.25 m) orthophotos acquired on May 2008 185 

and August 2009. Surveys of beach topography were carried out on 16 October 2008 and 11 186 

August 2009 using a Leica ALS50-II airborne laser scanning system. LiDAR uses a laser beam 187 

to depict the shape of the terrain. Through a combined use of a laser transmitter with high 188 

repeating pulse frequency and a high speed scanning system, very dense measurements of range 189 

from the LiDAR system to the terrain surface are produced (Table 1). The global positioning 190 

system (GPS) and inertial navigation systems on board allowed 3D position coordinates to be 191 

assigned to the points where the signal was reflected. The European Terrestrial Reference 192 

System 1989 (ETRS 1989) was used and points were projected to the Universal Transverse 193 

Mercator system (zone 31 N). The GRS80 ellipsoidal heights were transformed into orthometric 194 

heights by adding the geoid undulations of the local geoid EGM08D595, which is an adaptation 195 

of the EGM2008 geoid to the local levelling network (Grau et al., 2012). 196 

The LiDAR points are affected by systematic errors. The main error contribution is a height 197 

offset, which we assumed to be constant and different for each strip. It was corrected in a strip 198 

adjustment using control fields and LiDAR strips from a previous project, which minimized the 199 

height differences in crossing areas as well as the differences between strips and measurements 200 

taken in the control fields, following the procedure described in Kornus and Ruiz (2003). The 201 

systematic errors for both surveys were simultaneously minimized by least squares. After 202 

adjustment, LiDAR point data were classified into ground and non-ground points with 203 

TerraScan and TerraModeler from Terrasolid. Finally, high-resolution digital elevation models 204 

(DEMs) with a 1-m grid step were interpolated from the points classified as ground, also with 205 

the help of TerraModeler. This is an interpolation on flat triangles of a triangulated irregular 206 

network model. The absolute height accuracy of the LiDAR points was evaluated in a control 207 

field. A flat area without vegetation or other obstructions was chosen. A total of 54 points were 208 

measured in the control field with GPS-RTK, which has a vertical precision of 2-3 cm. The 209 



9 

results of the comparison are shown in Table 2. In addition, the relative height accuracy for the 210 

temporal coastal change and vertical offsets were quantified from 50 control fields selected 211 

from stable flat and hard surfaces adjacent to the beach, as proposed by Zhang et al. (2005). The 212 

relative elevation accuracy between the two flights was examined by comparing the elevations 213 

of each point within these control fields extracted from the 1-m gridded DEMs. Results revealed 214 

a mean difference in elevation of -0.006 ± 0.045, with a root mean square of 0.04 m, lower than 215 

the resolution of LiDAR data, thus supporting that no significant errors exist between the two 216 

surveys. 217 

3.3 Morphological analysis 218 

3.3.1 Shoreline changes 219 

Topographic data were integrated in the ArcGIS 10.1 Geographical Information System to 220 

quantify changes in the shoreline position and subaerial beach volume. The shoreline was 221 

defined for each survey as the horizontal position of the datum-based mean high water 222 

(Stockdon et al., 2002). The shoreline displacement was calculated as the difference between the 223 

initial and final configurations in cross-shore transects at a 1 m intervals along the coast.  224 

To identify changes in the beach planform and to exclude the effect of smaller-scale 225 

morphologies (e.g. megacusps), the method proposed by Sancho-García et al. (2013) was 226 

applied. In this procedure, the embayed beach is described mathematically by fitting a 227 

hyperbolic tangent shape to it (Moreno and Kraus, 1999). The overall beach planform changes 228 

are defined as the difference between the initial and final fitted shorelines, whereas residuals 229 

provide information about smaller-scale morphologies along the shoreline.  230 

3.3.2 Volume changes 231 

Total volumetric change was calculated by subtracting the DEMs obtained for each survey. The 232 

net volumetric change was normalized by the linear metre of coastline (in m
3
/m) to compare the 233 

differences between the three beaches. To assess cross-shore variations in the subaerial beach 234 



10 

volume, the beach was divided into two sectors: the foreshore, defined between the shoreline 235 

and the berm crest, and the backshore, which includes the backshore and the dune system and 236 

extends from the berm crest to the landward limit of the observed changes in beach elevation 237 

during the study period (Fig. 3).  238 

Alongshore variations in the beach volume changes are commonly quantified by analysing 239 

beach profiles along the coast, which essentially consists in reducing 3D topographic data to 2D 240 

cross-shore transects (Stockdon et al., 2009; Keijpers et al., 2014). However, previous studies 241 

have highlighted that the accuracy of volumetric change measurements from beach transects 242 

decreases as the profile spacing increases, particularly on beaches with complex morphology 243 

and at short (yearly) timescales (Wright and Short, 1984; Robertson et al., 2007; Muñoz-Perez 244 

et al., 2012). Furthermore, the location of the selected profiles can also lead to errors in the 245 

beach volume measurements (Pearre and Pauleo, 2009; Theuerkauf and Rodriguez, 2012, 246 

2014). In this work, alongshore variations in the subaerial beach volume changes were 247 

quantified by segmenting each DEM into 3D cross-shore segments (called bins) with regular 248 

width. The use of bins instead of transects resolves the spatial variability of the beach 249 

morphology with the accuracy of the high-resolution topographic data. 250 

To define an appropriate bin width that accurately resolves the spatial variability of the beach 251 

morphology, the subaerial beach volume change was calculated from DEM subtraction as well 252 

as from beach transects. Different computations were tested by varying profile spacing (from 1 253 

to 200 m, every 5 m) and location (10 different profile locations). The relative volume error was 254 

calculated from difference between the net volumes calculated from transects and that obtained 255 

for each DEM. 256 

Volume change is calculated for each transect using Equation (2) 257 

                              (2) 258 

where Y is the transect spacing, (Xi+1-Xi) is the across-beach distance between grid cells, ΔZ is 259 

the change in elevation, and n is the total number of grid cells of each transect. 260 



11 

Results revealed that the best accuracy of beach volume change is achieved from 1 m-spaced 261 

profiles, corresponding to the grid resolution (Fig. 4). The accuracy decreases with increasing 262 

profile spacing, particularly at distances greater than 20 m. Furthermore, large errors in the 263 

beach volume (either over- or under-estimation) appear to be associated with changes in the 264 

transect location, regardless of the distance between transects, due to the spatial variability of 265 

the beach morphology (Fig. 4). Based on these observations, a bin width of 20 m is considered 266 

to represent the observed alongshore variable beach morphology. 267 

3.3.3 Beach vulnerability to inundation 268 

The vulnerability of the beach to inundation during storms was estimated by comparing pre-269 

storm beach morphology (Dlow and Dhigh) with maximum storm-induced water levels (Rlow and 270 

Rhigh) calculated at the peak of the extreme storm, using the conceptual model proposed by 271 

Sallenger (2000) and expanded by Stockdon et al. (2007). Dhigh is the elevation of the dune crest 272 

or, in the absence of dunes, the elevation of the beach berm (Fig. 3). Dlow is defined as the 273 

elevation of the base of the dune (Fig. 3). When a dune is not present, Dlow is not defined. The 274 

position of the dune crest and toe were extracted from the 1 m-gridded DEM (and related 275 

products such as slope and aspect maps) obtained in the first survey. Where dunes were not 276 

present, the berm crest was digitized as the highest position on the beach. After digitization of 277 

the position of the dune or berm crest on the DEM, their precise cross-shore location and 278 

elevation were automatically identified as the highest elevation within a 5 m-wide swath centred 279 

on the digitized line. Where dunes were present, the horizontal position and elevation of the 280 

dune base were calculated as the location of maximum slope change within a region (6 m wide) 281 

around a line digitized along the dune toe. The location of the dune or berm crest and dune toe 282 

was superimposed on the 1 m-spaced cross-shore profiles to verify the accuracy of the 283 

elevations extracted from the DEM.  284 

According to Sallenger’s model (Sallenger, 2000), swash regime occurs when Rhigh is confined 285 

to the foreshore region, collision regime occurs when Rhigh exceeds the base of the dune, and 286 

overwash regime occurs when Rhigh equals or exceeds the dune crest. The most extreme regime, 287 



12 

inundation, occurs when Rlow exceeds the crest of the dune, and the beach and dunes are 288 

completely and continually subaqueous. The storm-impact regime was predicted every 1 m 289 

along the coast using measurements of pre-storm dune elevation and estimates of storm-induced 290 

expected water levels. Results were represented in the figures using a low-pass filter for 20 m 291 

length scale in order to represent the observed alongshore variable beach morphology, allowing 292 

patterns to be easily identified. 293 

4. Results 294 

4.1 Forcing conditions 295 

Time series of the main forcings in the study area during the study period are illustrated in Fig. 296 

5. Recorded waves show typical climatic conditions of the area, with a stormy period from 297 

November 2008 to April 2009 followed by a fair-weather period from May to August 2009 298 

(Figs. 5A, 5B). Following Ojeda and Guillén (2008), significant storms were defined by Hs 299 

higher than 2.5 m at the peak of the storm and a minimum duration of 12 h, with Hs higher than 300 

1.5 m. If the interval between two consecutive storms was shorter than 12 h, they were 301 

considered as a single double-peaked storm, as was proposed by Mendoza and Jiménez (2009). 302 

According to these criteria, six storms impacted the area during the study period (Table 3).  303 

The most energetic storm occurred on 26 December 2008. It was characterized by a Hs of 7.5 m 304 

and an associated Tp of 12.2 s at the peak of the storm, with a predominant easterly direction, 305 

which induced a maximum water level, Rhigh, of 4.1 ± 1.1 m (Fig. 5D). The magnitude of the 306 

astronomical tide and the storm surge recorded by the tidal gauging (0.4 m) was much lower 307 

than the wave-induced runup (3.7 m), which constituted the main contributor to increased water 308 

levels at the coast during the storm. The storm corresponded to category-V (extreme storm), 309 

following the storm intensity scale for the Catalan Sea proposed by Mendoza et al. (2011) with 310 

a return period of approx. 50 years (Bolaños et al., 2009). In addition to the extreme storm, 311 

other moderate S and NE storms occurred during this period, with Hs between 2.5 and 3.4 m, an 312 



13 

associated Tp of between 8 and 11.1 s, and a mean Rhigh of between 1.6 and 2.5 m (Fig. 5, Table 313 

3).  314 

4.2 Shoreline variations and beach volume changes 315 

4.2.1 Pals beach 316 

Shoreline displacements along the Pals beach during the study period ranged between –29 m 317 

and +40.7 m, with a mean shoreline retreat of -3.9 m that resulted in a reduction of 32 787 m
2
 in 318 

the beach area (7% of the emerged beach area). Shoreline changes showed a non-uniform 319 

alongshore pattern (Fig. 6B), reflecting the influence of the evolution of small-scale 320 

morphologies, such as megacusps, on the overall beach planform response. 321 

Changes in the overall beach shape were derived by comparing the pre- and post-storm fitted 322 

shorelines to the hyperbolic tangent shape (Figs. 6C, 6D). Results showed a good fit (squared 323 

correlation, r
2
, between the fit and the shoreline of almost 1), except in the northernmost sector 324 

of the beach where the curvature of the real shoreline is significantly higher than the fitted 325 

shape. The shoreline experienced an overall retreat during the study period, although it was not 326 

uniform along the beach. The only area where the beach planform experienced accretion was 327 

the southernmost extreme of the beach, where the shoreline advanced up to +45 m. It must be 328 

considered that net alongshore sediment transport along the beach is towards the south and this 329 

area is therefore a typical accumulation zone.  330 

Residuals of the fitted shoreline result in secondary morphological features showing two spatial 331 

scales (Figs. 6D, 6E): megacusps with a mean spacing of 290 m and amplitudes of 10-15 m and 332 

larger rhythmic morphologies with a spacing of up to 2700 m and amplitudes of 75-80 m. 333 

Changes in the morphology (amplitude and/or extension) and migration of megacusps produce a 334 

differential erosion/accretion pattern along the beach that results in a high variability in the 335 

shoreline position (Fig. 6B). The largest rhythmic morphologies also change in amplitude and 336 

extension and migrate southward over the study period, particularly in the southern sector of the 337 

beach. 338 



14 

In terms of volume, Pals beach experienced a significant gain of sediment of +64,580 m
3
 on the 339 

subaerial beach (+7.5 m
3
/m). The volume gained in the foreshore during the study period was 340 

+10 540 m
3 

(+1.2 m
3
/m), which represents 16% of the total beach volume. The remaining 84% 341 

(+54,040 m
3
, +6.3 m

3
/m) was accumulated on the backshore. Subaerial volume changes showed 342 

a non-homogeneous alongshore behaviour, with alternating deposition/erosion zones in the 343 

foreshore, and deposition prevailed on the backshore, particularly in the northern sector from 344 

L’Estartit to the Daro River mouth (Fig. 7). The alongshore pattern of volume changes in the 345 

foreshore is well correlated with the observed shoreline behaviour, so retreating areas showed 346 

eroding foreshore and vice versa (Fig. 6B, 7C). However, the comparison between volume 347 

changes in the subaerial part of the beach and observed shoreline changes reveals no significant 348 

relationship (Fig. 8) because retreating areas can show an increase in the overall beach volume. 349 

The only area where both variables showed a ‘coherent’ behaviour (shoreline advance was 350 

accompanied by volume increase and vice versa) was the southern sector of the beach, south of 351 

the Daro River mouth (Figs. 6B, 7B, 8). This different behaviour between shoreline 352 

displacements and total volume changes can be explained by the observed sediment 353 

accumulation on the backshore (Figs. 7D, 7E).  354 

The net accumulation on the backshore comprises backshore aggradation and changes in the 355 

dune system, including dune erosion, burial of small dunes, accumulation on the interdunes and 356 

overwash deposits. Dune geomorphic changes also displayed a high alongshore variability that 357 

can be explained by alongshore variations in the beach and dune elevations that control the 358 

beach inundation potential during storms (Fig. 9). Beach and dune elevation show an increasing 359 

trend southwards, from 4.5 m in the north to 7 m in the south (Fig. 9B). From L’Estartit to the 360 

Daro River mouth, large morphological changes were observed at elevations of up to 4.5 m with 361 

respect to mean sea level and up to a distance of 135 m from the shoreline (Figs. 7E, 9). In this 362 

sector of the beach, maximum water levels during the extreme storm of December 2008 363 

significantly exceeded the dune or berm crest. As a result, the beach was overtopped and the 364 

sand was transported landwards and deposited as overwash fans that extend tens of metres 365 



15 

landward of the dune crest (up to 80-100 m; Fig. 7E). During moderate storms, maximum water 366 

levels were higher than the elevation of the base of the dune but lower than the dune crest 367 

elevation, likely forcing dune erosion (Fig. 9). On the southern part of the beach, however, most 368 

of the observed volume changes occurred on the foreshore, with only minor changes on the 369 

backshore. This is probably due to the fact that dune and beach elevations are higher and, 370 

consequently, overtopping conditions during the extreme storm were not likely to occur and 371 

most of the changes were restricted to the external part of the dune system (Figs. 7E, 9).  372 

To assess the influence of urbanization on the morphological response of Pals beach, areas with 373 

different levels of urbanization were compared with natural areas. Urbanized areas include 374 

L’Estartit, Els Griells, El Mas Pinell and Pals beach golf course, where the beach width is 375 

reduced by urban construction in the hinterland (Fig. 1). The natural areas include 376 

environmental protected areas within the Medes Islands and Baix Ter Natural Park and the 377 

Partial Nature Reserve of the Baix Ter and Daro (Fig. 1). The morphological evolution of the 378 

beach during the study period revealed a net shoreline retreat of -3.9 m and a gain of volume of 379 

+9.2 m
3
/m in natural areas. In urbanized areas, the beach exhibited a shoreline retreat of -4.4 m 380 

and a net gain of volume of +4.7 m
3
/m. 381 

4.2.2 Illa Roja and Sa Riera 382 

The two small embayed beaches located at the south of the study area (Illa Roja and Sa Riera) 383 

behaved differently in terms of shoreline change (Fig. 10). Shoreline variations at Illa Roja 384 

showed an advance in the southern sector (up to 7 m) and a retreat in the northern sector (up to 385 

17 m), with a mean shoreline retreat of -3.7 ± 6.9 m and a reduction in the subaerial beach area 386 

of -677 m
2
 (Fig. 10C). Conversely, shoreline and emerged beach area at Sa Riera remained 387 

almost constant during the study period; shoreline displacements ranged between -2.3 and +3.8 388 

m, with a mean value of -0.2 ± 1.3 m and a negligible loss (-44 m
2
) of the beach area (Fig. 10F). 389 

At Illa Roja, the change in the orientation of the shoreline implied a decrease in the total beach 390 

area but without significant volume changes (+0.4 m
3
/m); sediment eroded from the northern 391 

side of the beach was transported towards the south (Fig. 10C). In contrast, Sa Riera showed the 392 



16 

highest accumulation values of the three beaches, with a net gain of volume of +11.2 m
3
/m, 393 

mostly accumulated on the backshore (Fig. 10F).  394 

5. Discussion 395 

5.1 Shoreline changes as a proxy for subaerial beach volume? 396 

In most morphological studies in micro-tidal environments, a usual hypothesis is that shoreline 397 

variation is a good proxy of subaerial volume, which implies the existence of a strong 398 

correlation between the two parameters (e.g. Lee et al., 1995; Dail et al., 2000; Sallenger et al., 399 

2002; Dingler and Reiss, 2002; Farris and List, 2007). However, the general validity of this 400 

hypothesis is questioned by observed differences in the magnitude and, most important, the sign 401 

of shoreline and volume changes along Pals beach. This beach shows a poor correlation (r
2
   402 

0.43) between shoreline changes and emerged beach volume due to the observed sediment 403 

accumulation on the backshore (Fig. 8A). The only part where shoreline and volume changes 404 

are well correlated (r
2
   0.71; Fig. 8B) is the southern sector of the beach, where most of the 405 

changes were restricted to the foreshore: shoreline advances coincided with sediment deposition 406 

and shoreline retreat with erosion. This finding suggests that low-lying coasts subjected to storm 407 

impacts driving significant overwash processes are not a suitable environment for assuming that 408 

shoreline changes properly reflect beach volume changes. The use of shoreline changes as a 409 

proxy of volume changes implicitly assumes that the shape of the beach profile does not change 410 

significantly over time; the entire profile migrates in the same direction as the shoreline (e.g. 411 

Hanson, 1989; Dail et al, 2000; Farris and List, 2007). However, changes in the shape of beach 412 

profiles such as those due to overwash processes can significantly limit the validity of this 413 

proxy, in particular at short timescales. This is in agreement with other studies that observed 414 

decreasing accuracies in the beach volume estimation on beaches with along- or cross-shore 415 

variations in the magnitude of volume changes (Robertson et al., 2007; Theuerkauf and 416 

Rodriguez, 2014).  417 



17 

The only part of the beach that shows a relative consistency between volume changes and 418 

shoreline displacements is the foreshore. Along Pals beach, a good correlation (r
2
   0.75) is 419 

observed between measured shoreline displacements and foreshore volume changes (Fig. 8C), 420 

particularly in the southern sector (r
2
   0.84; Fig. 8D). In spite of this good correlation, the beach 421 

experienced an overall mean shoreline retreat (-3.9 m) but a positive volume change in the 422 

foreshore (+1.2 m
3
/m), which should indicate that expected volume losses in the foreshore for 423 

retreating parts were lower than expected when compared with sediment deposition in 424 

prograding areas. The difference in magnitude and sign of the shoreline and foreshore volume 425 

changes is probably related to differences in the slope and elevation of the accreting and eroding 426 

sectors of the beach. Small changes in the shoreline position imply small changes in the 427 

foreshore volume in low (1-1.5 m high) and gentle (βf 0.6) beach profiles, as observed in the 428 

northern and central areas of the beach (Fig. 3A). Conversely, larger changes in the foreshore 429 

volume are associated with smaller changes in the shoreline in higher (up to 3.5 m) and steeper 430 

(βf 1.1) beach profiles, as observed in the southern sector of the beach (Fig. 3B).  431 

The morphological evolution of Pals beach during the study period revealed a significant 432 

increase in the emerged beach volume of +7.5 m
3
/m, mostly due to large accumulation of sand 433 

on the backshore (+6.3 m
3
/m). This large accumulation was related to the impact of storms 434 

when storm surge and waves produced overwash that deposited sand on the dune system or 435 

even inland, forming overwash fans (Fig. 11) and increasing volume on the backshore. High 436 

water levels associated with moderate storms also contributed to backshore aggradation through 437 

overtopping of the beach berm, particularly in the northern sector where the beach topography is 438 

lower and gentler (Fig. 9). During calm weather waves, swash is confined to the foreshore of the 439 

beach seaward of the dune and berm crest; consequently, the sand accumulated on the 440 

backshore during storms remains as a buffer deposit, resulting in larger and more permanent 441 

changes on the backshore and increasing differences between shoreline and beach volume 442 

change rates. The increasing volume on the backshore during energetic storms was also 443 

observed on other low-lying sandy coasts (Sallenger, 2000; Doughty et al., 2006; Stockdon et 444 



18 

al., 2007; Gervais et al., 2012; Clemmensen et al., 2016). Stockdon et al. (2007) found that the 445 

magnitude of the beach volume change was significantly greater during energetic storms than 446 

during moderate storms due to the landward transport of sand. Similarly, in the nearby Gulf of 447 

Lions, Gervais et al. (2012) reported deposition on the backshore when the highest water levels 448 

raise the elevation of the top of the berm, and cause breaching and/or overwash of the dune 449 

system accompanied by large sand accumulation (about 8 m
3
/m).  450 

In addition to large accumulation on the backshore, Pals beach also experienced large gains of 451 

sediment on the foreshore (+1.2 m
3
/m), with the largest accretion at the southernmost limit (Fig. 452 

7C). Geomorphic changes in Pals beach suggest that the increase in foreshore volume is 453 

produced by post-storm beach recovery, alongshore sediment redistribution and fluvial 454 

sedimentary inputs. After storms, onshore reworking of storm deposits in the submerged profile 455 

usually result in onshore bar migration, followed by bar welding and foreshore accretion 456 

(Wright and Short, 1984; Morton et al., 1994; Masselink et al., 2006). On Pals beach, the post-457 

storm beach aggradation through slip-face ridges merging to the beach is confirmed by the 458 

foreshore configuration, which is characterized by the presence of bar type morphologies 459 

attached to the shoreline with a landward–facing slip-face. The large foreshore accretion at the 460 

southernmost limit of the beach likely results from the prevailing alongshore sediment transport 461 

towards the southwest, as is also evidenced by changes in the beach planform, the southwards 462 

migration of cuspate morphologies along the shoreline, and the huge gain in sediment of Sa 463 

Riera beach (+ 11.2 m
3
/m). The sand eroded from the northern Pals and Illa Roja beaches during 464 

storms is transported downdrift to Sa Riera, contributing to the recovery and infilling of the 465 

beach during post-storm conditions (Fig. 10). Finally, rivers may also locally contribute to the 466 

observed positive volume changes in the subaerial beach, particularly at the river mouth (Figs. 467 

7, 11). Though it is very difficult to differentiate river contribution from alongshore sediment 468 

transport processes at the river mouths, the observed morphological changes and the net volume 469 

gain at the Ter and Daro River mouths (+800 m
3
 and +980 m

3
, respectively) suggest that rivers 470 



19 

could also be contributing to increased beach volume during short-lived flood events such as 471 

that observed during the extreme storm of December 2008 (Fig. 2).  472 

5.2 Observed and predicted beach inundation  473 

The morphological evolution of Pals beach indicates the occurrence of inundation during the 474 

study period, which must have occurred during the impact of the largest storm. Large sediment 475 

accumulation on the backshore, and dune morphological changes, were observed in those areas 476 

where maximum storm-induced water levels exceed the maximum beach and dune elevation 477 

(Figs. 9, 12). The maximum distance of inundation has been defined as the landward limit of 478 

overwash deposits. It was determined from observed elevation changes across the beach and 479 

was measured using the initial (pre-storm) shoreline position as a reference (Fig. 12A). 480 

Following the observed alongshore pattern in beach changes, the inundation distance was 481 

significantly larger (up to 135 m) in the northern sector of the beach, where the beach and dunes 482 

are lower and overwash deposits extend up to 80-100 m inland from the dune ridge, than in the 483 

southern sector (~ 65 m), where higher dunes prevented overwash (Fig. 12B). In addition, 484 

inundation distance was also strongly reduced in areas where houses and promenades occupy 485 

the backshore, limiting the potential overwash transport, as observed at Els Griells. 486 

The observed inundation derived from morphological changes was compared with expected 487 

storm impacts based on the use of predictive models to evaluate their accuracy. The Sallenger 488 

(2000) model was applied to the pre-storm beach morphology considering the maximum storm-489 

induced water levels associated to an energetic storm, the extreme storm, with a return period of 490 

approx. 50 years. The distribution of the observed inundation along Pals beach is consistent 491 

with the predicted regime based on the storm impact scaling model proposed by Sallenger 492 

(2000). Larger inundation distances and larger changes in the dune system were observed on the 493 

northern part of the beach, where beach and dune morphologies and the total water level 494 

determined the prevalence of the overwash and inundation regimes during the impact of the 495 

extreme storm of December 2008 (Fig. 12). On the other hand, dune changes were almost 496 

negligible and a shorter inundation distance was observed in the southern sector, where the 497 



20 

conditions determined the existence of the collision regime during that storm. These findings 498 

should indicate the validity of this conceptual model for predicting the response of low-lying 499 

coasts to storm impacts. 500 

The observed inundation was compared with existing assessments of regional vulnerability to 501 

storm impacts (Mendoza, 2008; Bosom, 2014). The first aspect to be considered is that these 502 

methods were developed to be applied at a regional scale and therefore represent the beach 503 

morphology along the beach in a simplified manner by just using two profiles for the northern 504 

and southern parts. Also, they are not applied to a specific storm, such as the one analysed in 505 

this work, but to characteristic storm conditions obtained from cluster analysis (Mendoza, 2008) 506 

or from extreme probabilistic distributions (Bosom and Jiménez, 2011; Bosom, 2014). 507 

Therefore, these methods only indicate the expected overall behaviour of the beach in response 508 

to storm impacts without reproducing the observed alongshore small-scale variability. 509 

Nevertheless, these general vulnerability assessment methods indicate that the northern part of 510 

the beach has a much greater vulnerability to inundation during storms than the southern part, 511 

which showed a very low vulnerability (Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 12C, the length of the 512 

inundated area during the peak of the extreme storm represented 75%, 77%, 60% and 37% of 513 

beach length based on our observations, and on expected overwash and inundation regimes 514 

following the models of Sallenger (2000), Mendoza (2008) and Bosom (2014), respectively. In 515 

addition to the total length differences, many locations defined in the predictions as areas with 516 

low vulnerability to inundation were overwashed during the extreme storm (Fig. 12). 517 

Discrepancies between the observed inundation and expected storm impact are mainly due to 518 

differences in the prediction associated with measurements of beach morphology and estimates 519 

of storm-induced water levels during the specific storm. The accuracy of predicted vulnerability 520 

to inundation strongly depends on the quality of beach morphological parameters that vary 521 

significantly alongshore, such as beach and dune elevation and foreshore slope, beach width or 522 

dune volume. Therefore, good quality topographic data are necessary to properly define the 523 



21 

spatial variations in the beach susceptibility to inundation during storms, particularly for 524 

beaches with high alongshore variability.  525 

Furthermore, the beach morphology varies with time, affecting the differences between the 526 

observed and expected storm impact. The variations can be clearly observed in Table 4, where 527 

predicted storm impact using two different datasets for the same beach (pre-storm and post-528 

storm LiDAR-derived topographies) and the same storm are shown. The predicted overwash 529 

and inundation regimes during the extreme storm of December 2008 varies between 77% and 530 

64% of the total beach length for pre-storm and post-storm beach morphologies, respectively. It 531 

is also interesting to note that the predicted overwash and inundation regimes are reduced in 532 

2009 (after the impact of the extreme storm) in comparison with the pre-storm morphology 533 

(2008), probably due to higher beach elevations produced by large accumulation on the 534 

backshore. These observations highlight the need to regularly update the morphological 535 

indicators used for predicting beach vulnerability in order to represent the pre-storm beach 536 

conditions. 537 

5.3 Influence of urbanization on the beach response 538 

Existing studies of storm-induced changes in low-lying coasts reported different behaviour 539 

between natural and urban areas related to the decrease in the beach width caused by urban 540 

development in the hinterland (Morton et al., 1994; Saye et al., 2005; Gervais et al., 2012; 541 

Jiménez et al., 2012; Richter et al., 2013, among others). Morton et al. (1994) observed that 542 

beach recovery is prevented in urbanized areas because the beach seaward of houses, roads and 543 

promenades is too narrow to permit an efficient cross-shore sediment transport and dune 544 

construction. Gervais et al. (2012) reported an increase in coastal vulnerability to extreme 545 

storms of urbanized areas along the Gulf of Lion coastline in relation to natural coastal barriers. 546 

Overwash and/or breaching of the dune system dominate in natural areas, whereas severe 547 

damage to coastal infrastructures and facilities is observed in urbanized ones. Jiménez et al. 548 

(2012) also observed that anthropogenic intervention along the Catalan coast causes significant 549 

changes in beach response, intensifying erosion and inundation during storms. 550 



22 

The influence of urbanization on the morphological response of Pals beach is evidenced by 551 

comparing the morphological response of areas with different levels of urbanization and natural 552 

areas (Figs. 13A, 13B). The morphological evolution of the beach during the study period 553 

revealed a similar net shoreline retreat in both pristine and urbanized areas. However, the 554 

volume change, particularly accumulation on the backshore, on natural areas was two times 555 

higher than at locations where the beach had been artificially narrowed. The smaller 556 

accumulation of sediment in urban areas can be explained by the blocking effect of 557 

infrastructure, which prevents the landward transport and accumulation of sediment during 558 

storms (Fig. 13A). On the other hand, natural areas showed a significant increase in sediment 559 

volume on the backshore as a result of storm-induced overwash transport. However, though the 560 

anthropogenic influence is more subtle in these areas, the results also revealed alongshore 561 

variations in the morphological beach response related to small human interventions. These 562 

variations were observed in the dune system northwards of the Ter River mouth, where the sand 563 

was transported landwards through artificial cuts between dunes, such as beach access roads and 564 

walking paths (Fig. 11). 565 

Identifying coastal areas at risk of flooding, determining the flood extent and assessing the 566 

human influence on the beach response are particularly important in Pals Bay due to its high 567 

natural value. A large extent of the littoral plain is protected by the Plan for Areas of Natural 568 

Interest (Pla d'Espais d'Interès Natural, PEIN) of Catalonia and the Natura 2000 network of the 569 

European Union. The management of Natura 2000 sites includes interests for coastal protection 570 

and users, since human activities are not excluded in these areas. It is fully recognized that 571 

humans are an integral part of nature, so human activities must be regulated in these areas, 572 

giving priority to increasing coastal resilience and maintaining a healthy sediment balance in the 573 

coastal system. Taking into account the inundation observed along Pals beach and the more 574 

resilient beach response to storms in natural areas, a minimum distance of between 65 and 135 575 

m should be applied in the definition of the setback line. This distance corresponds to the 576 

maximum observed inundation and will serve to promote coastal resilience in this area by 577 



23 

enhancing sediment deposition in the hinterland. Strictly speaking, this setback should be 578 

effective for storms similar to the recorded one, which had an associated return period of 579 

approx. 50 years. Moreover, as has been demonstrated in this analysis, the extension and 580 

magnitude of the deposition are modulated by beach morphology, so the aforementioned 581 

distance will also be controlled by the dune/beach morphology. As a general rule, the lower the 582 

dune is, the larger the distance will be. Finally, it should also be considered that, in a context of 583 

climate change with sea-level rise and induced background erosion; longer setback distances for 584 

‘no development zones’ should be required to reduce coastal vulnerability to storm impacts.  585 

6. Conclusions 586 

The morphological evolution of a low-lying embayed beach bounded by a dune system in the 587 

NW Mediterranean coast was quantified using LiDAR derived high-resolution topographic data 588 

collected prior to, and six months after, the impact of an ‘extreme’ storm with a return period of 589 

approx. 50 years. Results revealed a net shoreline retreat and, consequently, a loss of the 590 

emerged area, but a significant sediment gain on the subaerial beach. The opposite behaviour 591 

between shoreline and subaerial beach volume changes is related to storm impacts driving 592 

significant overwash processes that transport sediment landwards and increasing volume on the 593 

backshore.  594 

The use of repeated high-resolution topographic data to quantify beach geomorphic changes has 595 

proven to be a valuable tool for estimating subaerial beach volume changes in relation to other 596 

proxies such as changes in beach profiles and shoreline positions. Results from this study 597 

indicate that shoreline displacements may not properly represent beach volume changes on low-598 

lying coasts, where overwash processes during storms are significant due to the cross-shore 599 

redistribution of beach sediment. Observations also suggest that beach transects may not resolve 600 

volume for beaches with variable morphology alongshore at short time scales (months). 601 

Accordingly, closely spaced beach profiles or segmentation of the beach into bins should be 602 

necessary to capture along-shore volume changes associated to beach complexities such as those 603 

resulting from beach cusps or dunes. 604 



24 

Observed morphological changes evidenced the impact of the storm and the subsequent beach 605 

recovery and revealed significant spatial variability in the beach response. The impact of the 606 

extreme storm on the beach morphology is evidenced by large accumulation on the backshore 607 

and the formation of overwash deposits. On the other hand, the net gain of sediment on the 608 

foreshore and the formation of second-order morphologies along the shoreline evidence beach 609 

recovery after the storm. This alongshore variability of the morphological response is strongly 610 

related to alongshore variations in the beach morphology, such as smaller-scale morphologies 611 

along the shoreline, beach and dune elevations and foreshore slope. Changes in the morphology 612 

(amplitude and/or extension) and migration of megacusps over the study period produce a 613 

differential erosion/accretion pattern along the beach that results in a high variability in the 614 

shoreline position. On the other hand, the magnitude and alongshore variability of 615 

morphological changes on the backshore are related to the impact of the extreme storm and are 616 

modulated by beach morphology, and particularly the dune/beach elevation and the beach slope. 617 

Larger geomorphic changes are observed where beach dunes are lower, favouring the 618 

dominance of overwash conditions, whereas beach changes are limited to the foreshore where 619 

beach dunes are higher.  620 

The comparison between observed and expected storm inundation highlights the need to obtain 621 

high-quality, updated coastal topographic data to properly define the spatial variations in beach 622 

inundation during storms. Observed inundation is in agreement with the model of Sallenger 623 

(2000) using pre-storm beach topography, but it is slightly different from the storm regime 624 

expected from post-storm beach topography because of temporal changes in the beach 625 

morphology. Similarly, the observed inundation also differs from existing regional assessments 626 

of vulnerability to storm impacts, as these methods focus on the expected overall behaviour of 627 

the beach in response to storm impacts without reproducing the observed alongshore small-scale 628 

variability.  629 

Finally, alongshore variability in the beach response can be also modulated to anthropogenic 630 

intervention on the backshore or the foredune. The comparison between natural and urban areas 631 



25 

evidences a better post-storm beach recovery of natural beaches, although the latter also reveal 632 

the influence on the beach response of small anthropogenic interventions such as regulated 633 

pathways and walking paths. Based on the alongshore variability of the beach inundation during 634 

storms and the increasing resilience of natural areas, a minimum distance corresponding to the 635 

maximum observed inundation should be assumed in the definition of the setback line in low-636 

lying coasts in order to increase coastal resilience.  637
