Summary: We examine the role of different forcings on the subtidal circulation in a microtidal bay with freshwater inputs in 
the NW Mediterranean Sea: Alfacs Bay. Observations of subtidal flow in summer 2013 and winter 2014 reveal a two-layered, 
vertically sheared circulation. During the summer, there is a significant positive correlation between surface currents and 
winds along the main axis of the bay, while a negative correlation is observed between wind and the bottom layers. During 
the winter, the cross-shore response is correlated with the most energetic winds, showing a two-layered vertical structure 
inside the bay and a nearly depth-independent water motion caused by high wind speeds at the bay mouth. The vertical struc-
ture of the velocities, as determined through empirical orthogonal function analysis, confirms that surface layers are affected 
by winds and bottom currents correlated negatively with winds as a response of the wind set-up. Seasonal mean circulation 
reveals gravitational exchange at the bay mouth during the summer. However, mean circulation is unclear in the inner bay 
and close to the drainage channels. Observed flow patterns are supported by modelling results that confirm the persistence 
of averaged current in the low-frequency dynamics. Re-circulation areas in the inner bay indicate the rich spatial variability 
in flow at low-frequency time scales.

Keywords: subtidal circulation; microtidal bay; numerical model; gravitational circulation.

Circulación submareal en una bahía micromareal del Mediterráneo

Resumen: En esta contribución se examina el papel de distintos forzamientos en la circulación submareal de una bahía 
micromareal con aportes de agua dulce en el Mediterráneo noroccidental: la bahía de los Alfacs. Las observaciones de las 
corrientes submareales en verano del 2013 e invierno de 2014 muestran una circulación de dos capas con cizalladura vertical. 
Durante el verano, existe una importante correlación positiva entre las corrientes superficiales y los vientos a lo largo del 
eje principal de la bahía, mientras que se observa una correlación negativa entre el viento y las corrientes de las capas más 
profundas. En invierno, la respuesta en la dirección perpendicular a la costa se correlaciona con los vientos más energéticos: 
con una estructura bi-capa en el interior de la bahía y una circulación prácticamente homogénea en la vertical a causa de la 
fuerza de los vientos en la zona de la bocana. La estructura vertical de las corrientes se determina a través de análisis EOF y 
confirma que las capas superficiales están afectadas directamente por los vientos, mientras que las capas más profundas se 
correlacionan negativamente con los vientos como respuesta del incremento de nivel del mar en la zona más interna debido 
al empuje de los mismos. La circulación estacional muestra intercambio estuarino en la bocana durante verano. No obstante, 
la circulación media no es tan evidente en la zona más interna cercana a los puntos de descarga de agua dulce. Los patrones 
de circulación observados se complementan con los resultados de la aplicación de un modelo numérico que confirma la 
persistencia de una circulación clara en el domino de la baja frecuencia. Las zonas de re-circulación en la parte más interna 
de la bahía es una muestra clara de la elevada variabilidad espacial de los campos de corrientes en las escalas temporales de 
baja frecuencia.

Palabras clave: circulación submareal; bahía micromareal; modelo numérico; circulación gravitacional.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics and physical processes in estuaries 
can be investigated at different time scales. A common 
approach is to use the tidal period as a cut-off fre-
quency and to consider the variability at periods longer 
than the tides. In most regions, the main tidal currents 
are semidiurnal (Browne and Fischer 1988) or diurnal 
(van Maren and Hoekstra 2004). At longer time scales, 
processes that are due to winds (Noble 1996), co-os-
cillating waves (Uncles et al. 2014), rain (Grifoll et al. 
2011) or intense freshwater inputs (Valle-Levinson et 
al. 2011) are the main factors controlling the hydrody-
namic response. At these scales, processes are catego-
rized as subtidal or low-frequency, and include local 
wind or remote forced circulation (Janzen and Wong 
1998), atmospheric pressure influence (Salas-Monreal 
and Valle-Levinson 2008) and residual circulation 
(Narváez and Valle-Levinson 2008). For instance, syn-
optic events have time scales of two to five days related 
to the passage time for weather systems and influence 
the circulation at those scales (Dyer 1997). 

The different time scales of winds and density 
gradients indicate the need to study subtidal flows at 
those scales. The importance of low frequency on the 
water environment is therefore great: residence times, 
as key parameters for evaluating the flow exchange 
between the open sea and the bay, and the consequent 
ecological status of the bay, are conditioned by the 
low-frequency water circulation, among other factors. 
For instance, the presence of gravitational circulation 

implies exchange between the estuary and the open 
sea, thus diminishing the residence time and affect-
ing ecological and biological processes (e.g. Acha et 
al. 2008, Hagy et al. 2000). Several studies on low-
frequency water circulation in a microtidal environ-
ments have been made (e.g. Valle-Levinson et al. 
2001, Malačič and Petelin 2009), but they are limited 
by the weak low-frequency flows and the long-term 
information required.

The main sources of flow variability in microtidal 
bays (NW Mediterranean Sea, Fig. 1) can be related 
to winds and seiches at periods shorter than one day 
(Camp and Delgado 1987, Cerralbo et al. 2014, 
2015b). Llebot et al. (2013) showed that wind influ-
ences not only the hydrodynamic response but also the 
hydrographic structures at time scales of a few hours. 
Therefore, the objective of this contribution is to de-
scribe the hydrodynamic response at low frequency in 
the microtidal and shallow Alfacs Bay. We investigate 
the mechanisms that force the residual circulation by 
evaluating the seasonal and spatial variability. Results 
from a previously implemented numerical model (Cer-
ralbo et al. 2016) provided supplementary information 
that helped interpret the observations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study area

Alfacs Bay is defined as a bar-built estuary 
(Pritchard 1952) formed by the interaction of Ebro

River sediment and Mediterranean coastal currents 
(Fig. 1). The bay is around 16 km long and 4 km wide, 
with an average depth of ~4 m. Its connection with the 
Mediterranean Sea is 2.5 km wide, with a central chan-
nel with a maximum depth of 6.5 m and shallow shoals 
of around 1-2 m on both sides. The bay is surrounded 
by rice fields to the north and a sand spit closing it 
on the east side. The rice fields contribute around 10 
m3 s–1 of nutrient-laden freshwater into the bay from 
April to December. Alfacs Bay has been defined as a 
salt wedge estuary for almost all of the year (Camp and 
Delgado 1987), with a noticeable influence of freshwa-
ter fluxes (Llebot et al. 2011, Solé et al. 2009) and heat 
fluxes during the spring and summer (Cerralbo et al. 
2015b). Surface heating and freshwater inputs stratify 
the bay, promoting the two-layered structure in the wa-
ter column.

The synoptic winds on the Catalan coast are af-
fected by orographic constraints, such as the blocking 
winds of the Pyrenees that promote tramontane (N) 
and mistral (NW) winds over the Ebro Delta area, and 
the wind channelling due to river valleys (Grifoll et al. 
2016). Northerly winds in the region are produced by 
high pressures over the Azores and lows over the Brit-
ish Isles and Italy (Martín Vide 2005). Winds in the 
bay have been characterized as having a northwestern 
and southwestern predominance, with the strongest 
ones coming from the NW (Cerralbo et al. 2015a). 

Observations

The bulk of the observational data came from two 
field campaigns: from July to mid-September 2013 and 
from February to April 2014. The data set consisted of 
water currents from two 2-MHz acoustic Doppler cur-
rent profilers (ADCPs) moored at the mouth (A1) and 
the inner bay (A2). Instruments recorded ten-minute 
averaged data from ten pings per minute and with 25-
cm vertical cells. Both devices were equipped with 
pressure and temperature sensors, and were mounted 
on the seabed at 6.5 m depth. Water level data were 
obtained from the Catalan Meteo-Oceanographic Ob-
servational Network (described in detail in Bolaños et 
al. 2009) in Sant Carles de la Ràpita harbour (M-SC 
in Fig. 1), and bottom pressure data were from the 
ADCPs. Atmospheric data (wind, atmospheric pres-
sure, solar radiation and humidity) were obtained from 
a fixed land station, Alcanar (M-A), and from M-SC. 
From 2012 to 2014, more than 100 CTD profiles were 
collected during five intensive daily campaigns. More 
details on the CTD data are available in Cerralbo et al. 
(2015b).

In order to analyse the dynamics at low frequencies, 
both currents and wind observations were filtered us-
ing a 30-h low-pass filter (Lanczos filter) (Emery and 
Thomson 2004). The vertical structure of the water 
column was investigated using empirical orthogonal 
functions (EOF) (Emery and Thomson 2004). The 
EOF analysis was performed considering both along- 
and cross-shore components at both stations, so that the 
EOF would explain the combined spatial variability at 
A1 and A2.

Numerical model

The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model used 
in this study is the Regional Ocean Modelling System 
(ROMS). Numeric aspects are described in detail in 
Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005), and a complete 
description of the model, with documentation and 
code, is available at the ROMS website: http://myroms.
org. The implementation of the model consisted of a 
regular grid of 186×101 points with a spatial resolution 
of 100 m (in both the x and y directions) and 12 sigma 
levels in the vertical dimension. More details about the 
configuration and validation of the model are described 
in Cerralbo et al. (2016).

RESULTS

Winds

Spectral analysis (Fig. 2A) of wind data from 1996 
to 2013 at M-SC (see location in Fig. 1) revealed prom-
inent variance peaks at 24-h and 12-h periods. Both 
periodicities correspond to sea breezes with strong 
asymmetry between daily influences (onshore winds) 
and nightly influences (weaker offshore winds). Lower 
frequencies contain energy over a broad band. This 
low-frequency energy is usually associated with the 
synoptic passage of low-pressure systems, which in the 
Catalan Sea has periods of 3-12 days (Font et al. 1990).

During the summer, unfiltered data from M-A 
show a mean wind speed of 3.1 m s–1, with a standard 
deviation of 1.7 m s–1 and maximum hourly winds of 
13.4 m s–1. The sea breeze pattern (diurnal cycle) is 
clearly observable during the entire summer (Fig. 2B) 
in unfiltered data, with the exception of two periods of 
seaward winds. These events occurred on 8 and 25 Au-
gust and lasted for a few hours (orange box in Fig. 2B, 
C). In winter, the mean wind speeds rose to 4.2 m s–1, 
with a standard deviation of 3 m s–1 and a maximum of 
14.2 m s–1. On the other hand, the 30-h filtered wind 
data in summer (winter) showed a maximum of around 
6 m s–1 (12 m s–1). Moreover, in March 2014 more than 
four events were observed with winds >10 m s–1 (Fig. 
2D in orange). 

Water current

The filtered depth-averaged current speeds at A1 
and A2 (see locations in Fig. 1) are plotted in Figure 
2C and 2E for the summer and winter seasons, respec-
tively. The standard deviations are also higher at A1 
than at A2 (2.2 and 1.6 m s–1 against 1.8 and 1.2 m 
s–1 for summer and winter, respectively). In order to 
qualitatively compare the wind and current intensities, 
the filtered wind speeds were scaled by a factor of 0.03. 
This value corresponds to the theoretical surface layer 
velocity (uw) due to the wind speed (W), assuming 
that the relationship follows the quadratic stress law 
uw=(ρa/ρw)1/2W (Large and Pond 1981, deCastro et al. 
2003), where ρa and ρw are the air and water densities, 
respectively. From 7 to 20 July the depth-averaged wa-
ter speed response (in both A1 and A2) followed the

Fig 2. – A, spectral energy for wind observations at M-SC from 1996 to 2013. In order to obtain statistical significance, the data were analysed 
with a time window of ~60 days (the total amount of 86 data sets being used to obtain the mean and standard deviation). Images B to E show 
filtered wind (W*) and depth-averaged currents. In B and D, the thin grey line represents wind speed (W) measured at Met-A in summer 2013 
and the thick grey line represents 30-h low-pass band filtered wind (W*) in the same period. In C and E, the grey line represents the theoretical 
surface layer velocity (uw*), and the red and blue lines represent the depth-averaged water current speed at A2 and A1, respectively. All units 

are in m s–1.

main pattern described by the winds, but for the rest 
of summer period the graphical comparison in Figure 
2C does not reveal a clear relationship between wind 
and depth-averaged currents. Correlation coefficients 
between depth-averaged current speeds and winds 
were close to 0, while in winter their values increased 
to 0.2 and 0.4 at A1 and A2, respectively. In summer, 
the maximum current speeds were observed on 4 Au-
gust, as well as in late August and early September 
(and with considerable differences between A1 and 
A2). In both cases, water currents have been related 
to co-oscillating waves (“seiches”) instead of winds 
or other forcings with hourly time scales (Cerralbo et 
al. 2014, 2015b). In this case, because the filter is ap-
plied on the water speed, the high-frequency signal is 

not completely filtered and some energy remains in the 
low-frequency band.

Current rose plots for the filtered currents in the 
surface and bottom layers (1-m averaged) are shown in 
Figure 3. In summer, different patterns were observed 
at each mooring. Seaward flows dominated in the sur-
face layers at A1, and opposite flows in the bottom lay-
ers. Meanwhile, at A2 (not shown), inflows dominated 
in the surface layers. The events with highest current 
speeds in summer corresponded to NW and NE winds 
(8 and 25 August, respectively). In winter, the filtered 
data were more scattered at A1, showing two predomi-
nant directions in the surface layers (NE and S-SE), 
while at A2 (not shown) the surface layers were similar 
to those observed in summer, although more dispersed 
from the main axis. The maximum surface velocities at 
A1 coincided with periods of NW winds (2 to 5 March 
and 25 March).

Correlations between the surface and bottom layers 
for both A1 and A2 in both periods are shown in Table 
1. At both locations and during all periods, correlations 
between the bottom and surface layers were negative, 
indicating the presence of two differentiated layers. In 
contrast, in winter, the correlation coefficient between

the surface and bottom layers was ~0 at A1 for the 
northward component. 

Rotated water currents

Low-frequency current observations show that the 
maximum variability of the water currents at A1 (Fig. 
3) and A2 is associated mostly with one axis aligned 
with the coastline (following the central axis of the 
bay). This axis was obtained by adjusting a line (linear 
regression) between both components (northward and 
eastward) and obtaining the angle with the east-west 
axis. Therefore, the explained variability shown in 
Figure 4A and C expresses the variance of each axis 
with respect to the total variance. These results are con-
sistent with previous contributions that used unfiltered 
velocities in Alfacs Bay (e.g. Camp 1994, Cerralbo et 
al. 2015b). Velocities corresponding to the rotated axis 
are defined as u′a_b and v′a_b, with a representing A1 or 
A2 observations, and b as s or w indicating the summer 
or winter periods, respectively. The u′ axis corresponds 
to the along-bay (alongshore) circulation and the v′ axis 
to the cross-bay (cross-shore) circulation. Alongshore 
positive values indicate velocities toward the head 
of the bay. New axes for the filtered data are rotated 
20° anticlockwise for A2 for both seasons because the 
summer and winter observations reveal similar values 
(19° to 21°). On the other hand, for A1, the axis is 43° 
anticlockwise in summer. However, winter observa-
tions do not reveal a major axis of variability because 
there are two clearly dominant components (Fig. 3B). 
For this reason, the rotation for the A1 observations 
in winter is carried out using the same axis as for the 

summer observations. In order to compare winds and 
currents, the wind is also rotated according to the cor-
responding location.

The variability explained by the new axis for each 
vertical layer is shown in Figure 4. Alongshore currents 
accounted for more than 75% of the total variability at 
A2 in both seasons and at A1 in summer. In winter, 
the surface layers exhibited a higher variability at A1, 
indicated by the cross-shore component, as shown by 
the current rose (Fig. 3B). 

The linear correlations between the rotated currents 
and winds are plotted in Figure 4B and D (consider-
ing all water layer depths). There is only a modest 
correlation of the surface alongshore layer with the 
corresponding alongshore wind component in summer 
(R=0.4). In winter, surface currents and winds showed 
a weak correlation (i.e. ≈0.2), and in all cases this cor-
relation decreased quickly with depth, the sign of the 
correlation coefficients changing to negative values, 
with the maximum correlation in the bottom layers 
(e.g. maximum R=–0.7 in winter at A2). 

Considering the limitations of linear correlation 
coefficients, alongshore and cross-shore currents (both 
surface and bottom layers) are graphically compared 
with the corresponding wind components (rotated to 
the same axis as the currents) for the summer and win-
ter periods in Figure 5. In summer, the results show 
the maximum wind variability in the alongshore axis. 
Two energetic events are observed on 8 and 25 August 
(in green in Fig. 2B). For the currents, the maximum 
variability is observed in the alongshore direction, with 
higher speeds in the surface layers. The u′A1_S shows 
that 59% of the total speeds are higher than 3 cm s–1,

following the rotated axis: 21° and 42° anticlockwise for A2 and A1, respectively. Red shaded areas indicate instances of qualitatively relevant 
correlation between alongshore surface currents and the corresponding winds. Orange shaded areas indicate relevant correlations with the 

cross-shore currents. Panels B and D show the same parameters in winter.

while for u′A2_S only 23% of the total current speeds 
exceed this threshold. In the cross-shore direction, 
only 16% and 3% of the observations show values 
higher than 3 cm s–1, respectively. Current velocity in 
the bottom layers at A2 does not exceed 3 cm s–1, and 
only 14% of the bottom velocities at A1 alongshore 
exceed this value. Qualitatively, alongshore currents at 
both A1 and A2 show a clear two-layered structure. In 
general, at A1 the surface layers show negative values 
(seaward), reproducing the oscillations observed for 
the winds, while at A2, the surface currents oscillate 
between positive and negative values following the 
main oscillations of the winds. Thus, a relevant surface 
response to the wind forcing is observed qualitatively 
on alongshore currents in summer.

In winter, two northerly wind events were observed 
on 3 to 5 March and 23-28 March (in orange in Fig. 
2D). Also, two events of E-NE winds occurred on 13 

and 30 March. In general, both the surface and the bot-
tom currents showed the highest alongshore velocities. 
In early March, there was a direct surface response to 
two events of SW winds in the alongshore velocities. 
Between 15 and 17 March, light winds from the SW 
(aligned with the main axis of the bay) were corre-
lated with surface currents. The most energetic events 
(northerly winds) did not induce a clear water response 
at low frequencies in the alongshore velocities. Be-
tween 23 and 27 March, both the surface and bottom 
layers showed a direct response to the wind in their 
cross-shore components (orange shaded area in Fig. 
5B). Using a threshold of 3 cm s–1 (as for the summer 
observations) the measurements at A2 exceeded this 
velocity 20% and 23% of the time at the surface and the 
bottom, respectively. On the other hand, at A1, surface 
layer velocities exceeded 3 cm s–1 44% and 28% of the 
time. This speed threshold is similar to the observed

evolution for the first component (pc1) is shown in image E, compared with the filtered alongshore wind in red (corrected by factor of 0.1 to

standard deviation. Comparisons between currents at 
A1 and A2 only reveal correlations higher than 0.40 
for alongshore components in the surface layers (0.47 
and 0.46 in summer and winter, respectively). The 
maximum correlation was observed in winter in the 
alongshore component of the bottom layers (0.60).

Along-axis EOF analysis shows differences along 
both moorings and periods: the first EOF explains 42% 
in both periods, and reveals a clear two-layered struc-
ture (i.e. Fig. 6A-C, F-H), excluding cross-shore at A2 
(Fig. 6D, I) with a barotropic response. The second and 
third EOFs explain ~20 and ~10% of the variability, 
respectively. In this case, the two-layered structure is 
only observed in A1 alongshore currents (Fig. 6A, F). 
The time evolution of the coefficients (PC1, PC2 and 
PC3) correlates with the alongshore winds (rotated with 
the same angle as currents at A1). The highest correla-
tion is observed between PC1 and alongshore winds, 
with values of ~0.66 and ~0.59 in summer and winter, 
respectively (see Fig. 6E, J). In summer, correlations 
between the rest of the components (PC2 and PC3) and 
winds (along- or cross-shore) are not significant. On 
the other hand, correlation around ~0.5 is observed be-
tween PC2 and PC3 with cross-shore winds in winter. 
Finally, correlations of the first component with cur-
rents show maximum values at the bottom layers.

Averaged circulation (seasonal time scales)

Since gravitational circulation typically occurs over 
long time scales (weekly and higher), it is instructive 
to examine the deployment-long mean currents at the 
moorings (Wong and Valle-Levinson 2002). Aver-
aged circulation for both A1 and A2 was obtained by 
time-averaging the observations corresponding to the 
filtered u and v velocities for all measurements in both 
time periods (summer and winter). The results are sum-
marized in Figure 7. A typical gravitational circulation 
is observed at A1 during both periods, with outflow 
at the surface and inflow at depth (Pritchard and Kent 
1956). In summer, water currents show southwestward 
velocities in the surface layers around 4-5 cm s–1, and 
northeastward flows of 2 cm s–1 at 2-3 m above the 
seabed. In winter, the currents are almost in the same 
direction but at lower speeds. At A2 the situation is 
completely different. In summer, the surface velocities 
are very small (close to 0), but in the E-NE direction, 
while in the lower layers the flow is directed westward 
at around 1 cm s–1. In winter a nearly depth-independent 
flow is observed at A2, toward the E-NE. The corre-
sponding standard deviations for each averaged current 
are shown in grey. In general, the variability is higher 
than the mean value, and only during the summer at A1 
do the surface currents show mean values higher than 
the standard deviation.

DISCUSSION

Low-pass analysis

Low-pass filtered velocities revealed a clear 
two-layered structure, which for 60% to 80% of the 

time featured opposite directions in the surface and 
bottom layers. Previous investigations (Cerralbo et al. 
2014, 2015b) with unfiltered data showed a one-lay-
ered structure for ≈70 % of the time, mostly related 
to barotropic seiches. In consequence, the removal of 
these high-frequency oscillations resulted in the pre-
dominance of a two-layer vertical structure. Moreover, 
some additional data analysis using low-pass filters 
of 6 h and 12 h (not shown) revealed similar percent-
ages to those observed using 30-h cut-off filters. This 
low-frequency characterization is in agreement with 
previous studies by Llebot et al. (2013), who observed 
the predominance of a two-layered structure in aver-
aged circulation. 

At A2, the main axis of the bay coincided with the 
axis of greatest variability in currents in both seasons 
and was almost equal at all depths (the percentage of 
variability explained by the first—alongshore—axis 
was more than 80% for the entire water column). How-
ever, A1 showed greater variability in the cross-shore 
component in winter (mostly in the surface layers), 
which is related to wind influence. In fact, A1 is 1.5 km 
from the coast, while A2 is at 600 m. As observed by 
Noble (1996), close to the shoreline laterally sheared 
boundary layer currents are expected to flow parallel to 
the coast. Thus, a transference from cross-shore winds 
in both locations to the alongshore currents seems 
clear, as they are higher at A2. A similar example of 
the strong influence of coastline on water circulation is 
described in Grifoll et al. (2012).

Baroclinic circulation

In contrast to a previous EOF analysis with unfil-
tered flow (Cerralbo et al. 2015b), the current low-
frequency EOF analysis showed an evident baroclinic 
behaviour in alongshore currents at both locations. The 
first mode (with two-layer structure) explained ~42% 
of the variability in all cases. These results are similar 
to those of Llebot (2010), though in their study they 
suggest that the first baroclinic mode (obtained using 
weekly time-scale analysis) was related exclusively to 
gravitational circulation rather than wind forcing. The 
analysis of the time evolution of each mode is useful 
to determine possible relationships between physi-
cal forcing and the variability described by the EOFs 
(Salas-Monreal and Valle-Levinson 2008, Schaeffer et 
al. 2011), even if sometimes the results of EOF analy-
sis may have no physical meaning (Huang et al. 1998; 
https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu). In our case, the 
PC1 correlates positively with wind in all periods and 
locations, linking the main mode to winds (correlations 
of 0.66 and 0.59 in summer and winter, respectively). 
On the other hand, cross-shore currents and winds only 
show relevant correlation or modes 2 and 3 (which ex-
plain ~20% and ~10% of variability) in winter, with 
correlations of around 0.59 and 0.47, respectively. This 
could be explained by the high winter prevalence of 
winds aligned with the cross-shore direction. 

Similar relevant correlations are observed when 
filtered winds and surface currents in the along-axis 
are compared at both locations in summer. However,

SCI. MAR. 82(4), December 2018, 231-243. ISSN-L 0214-8358 https://doi.org/10.3989/scimar.04801.16A

in winter, the effects of winds in along-axis surface 
currents are relatively weak, and the only noteworthy 
hydrodynamic response is observed in the cross-shore 
component of A1 during the most intense northwest-
erly wind. The low-frequency response shows the 
strongest correlations between winds and bottom cur-
rents. Different factors could be responsible for this 
hydrodynamic response. For example, stratification 
of the bay modifies the response to wind forcing in 
the water column. Surface layers are directly affected 
by wind, while bottom layers respond to the pressure 
gradient established along the bay due to the wind 
set-up, as observed in a shallow stratified system by 
Noble (1996). So, even if the origin is the same (i.e. 
wind forcing), the current-driving mechanism is dif-
ferent. Surface current observations are restricted to 
the 1-m layer below the free-surface. Therefore, the 
oscillations on the pycnocline (close to the surface) 
may induce a high degree of variability in the water 
response related to surface winds and the depth of 
the surface mixed layer. Conversely, bottom layers 
are farther from the effects of pycnocline oscillation, 
implying a more stable and consistent hydrodynamic 
response. Furthermore, the short distances of the 
observational points from the coast suggest a strong 
coastline influence (higher at A2), which in turn im-
plies some energy transfer from cross-shore winds to 
alongshore surface currents. 

Another possibility is related to the effects of re-
mote forcing. Winds can induce low-frequency vari-
ability in estuaries through a combination of remote 
and local effects. Considering the remote effect, winds 
on the continental shelf adjacent to an estuary can pro-
duce sea level fluctuations at the estuary mouth (Wong 
and Valle-Levinson 2002). For instance, variations in 
the coastal sea level due to the effects of winds (and 
atmospheric pressure variations) will induce incom-
ing and outgoing flows in the bay. To investigate this 
phenomenon, we compared the alongshore velocities 
to the sea level variations and the results shows correla-
tions of 0.6 at the bottom layers and lower correlations 
(–0.23 to –0.43) at the surface in winter. No correlation 
was found in summer. These results indicate the pos-
sible influence of shelf dynamics in the low-frequency 
response of the bay, as observed in other environments 
(Gačić et al. 2004, Murphy and Valle-Levinson 2008, 
Valle-Levinson et al. 2001). However, more observa-
tions on the shelf and numerical experiments covering 
the Ebro Delta shelf would be necessary to confirm the 
hypothesis. 

At the monthly time scale, the average circulation 
shows considerable differences from A1 to A2 (Fig. 7). 
The theoretical gravitational circulation due to fresh-
water influences (Hansen and Rattray 1965, Pritchard 
1952) on the bay would be represented by surface ve-
locities to the west at A2 and to the southwest at A1. 
Only observations at A1 coincided with the expected 
gravitational circulation. Moreover, considering some 
basic statistics such as the standard deviation (Fig. 
7), only at A1 and in summer (and especially at the 
surface) were the averaged currents higher than the 
standard deviation. 

Depth-averaged density fields observed on 7 May 
2014 (I-5 campaign) are shown in Figure 7. Two 
density distribution patterns are observable: 1) in the 
alongshore direction, from saltier water in the open sea 
to the freshest water in the inner bay (1027 to 1022 kg 
m–3); and 2) a cross-shore gradient in the inner bay, 
with the freshest water at the northern margin. Moreo-
ver, the freshest water in the north is concentrated 
around A2, close to the main drainage channels. This 
density field is representative for the open channel sea-
son and similar to that observed in summer 2012 and 
summer 2013, and to the scenarios described in Camp 
(1994) and Llebot et al. (2013). Consequently, it seems 
reasonable to conclude that the average circulation at 
A1 is explained by the density distributions and differ-
ences between inside and outside the bay (considering 
all freshwater sources in the inner bay), as well as the 
narrow shape of the bay mouth.

Another factor to consider is the wind stress influ-
ence on the gravitational circulation. Several reversals 
of surface flows have been observed in previous stud-
ies (Llebot et al. 2013, Cerralbo et al. 2015b). On those 
occasions, the wind stress overwhelmed the gravi-
tational circulation. The competition between wind 
stress and density gradients to produce subtidal flows 
is characterized with the Wedderburn number W (e.g. 
Monismith 1986, Valle-Levinson and Blanco 2004):

 W
L

ρ

with L being the basin length (around 16 km), g the 
gravity acceleration (9.81 m s–2), Δρ the density differ-
ence between two points, h the depth, and τs the surface 
wind stress. The wind stress τs is computed following 
Large and Pond (1981) as τs=CdρairU2, where Cd=1.3 
10–3, ρair=1.22 kg m–3, and U is the wind speed. Us-
ing W~1, we can obtain the theoretical threshold for 
overcoming the gravitational influences by wind stress. 
The only unknown value is the corresponding densi-
ty gradient. Considering the depth-averaged density 
fields shown in Figure 7, density differences between 
the inner bay and the open sea in summer are around 
3-5 kg m3. These values suggest that winds of between 
4 and 5 m s–1 would be able to overcome the gravi-
tational circulation. This analysis therefore gave us a 
general picture of the bay behaviour, but no specific 
description of responses at A1 and A2.

A2 is located in the middle of the bay and close 
to drainage channels. Thus, if the bay is divided into 
two areas from a cross-sectional axis at A2, freshwater 
inputs are distributed on both sides, diminishing (even 
cancelling) the possible gravitational circulation along 
the main axis of A2. This means that the average circu-
lation in the along-axis direction at this point is likely 
to be more influenced by other factors, but mainly 
wind forcing. 

Spatial variability: modelling study

The spatial variability of the mean circulation in the 
bay is illustrated with the results from a numerical mod-
el (Figs 8-9). Modelled average salinity and tempera-

ture fields (Fig. 8) revealed similar structures to those 
described by observations. For example, the modelled 
surface 2D salinity fields are very similar to the density 
structures observed in May 2014 (Fig. 7G). Moreover, 
the modelled salinity during the closed channels sea-
son (Fig. 8) shows a similar structure to that observed 
and described in Figure 7H, and previously described 
by Camp (1994), with density gradients along the bay 
and a well-mixed water column (not shown). Averaged 
surface currents in summer (Fig. 9A) show maximum 
velocities located close to the bay mouth. On the other 
hand, modelled velocities at A2 are much weaker than 
at A1, agreeing with observational data, with the direc-
tions also showing same vertical variability. As stated 

above, A2 is more sensitive to the freshwater inputs 
and the influence of winds, which influence the densi-
ty-driven circulation. 

Moreover, numerical results show how the 
near-surface average circulation exhibits two different 
behaviours inside the bay. The inner area (from A2 to 
the head of the bay) describes a near-surface anticy-
clonic circulation that follows isobaths. This behaviour 
was more evident in winter and related to spatial vari-
ability of northwesterly winds and bathymetry (Cerr-
albo et al. 2016). On the other hand, from A2 to the 
bay entrance, the main surface currents are seaward, 
consistent with the classical gravitational circulation. 
Also, in winter (Fig. 9D-F) relatively lower velocities 
appeared throughout the bay, and the maximum aver-
aged velocities occurred at the margins (in the shal-
lower areas). Moreover, two different structures are 
visible: the clearest being an anticyclonic gyre in the 
inner bay (close to the head), which clearly separates 
the average circulation from the region close to the 
bay mouth. These patterns suggest weak connectivity 
between the two bay volumes, and this disconnection 
would imply differences in residence times in the bay. 

In summer, flows perpendicular to the cross sec-
tions (Fig. 9B, C) reveal two-layer exchange with the 
interface at a depth of 3-4 m. The maximum outflows in 
the bay mouth are at the centre of the section (3 cm s–1) 
and the maximum inflows are at the bottom. However, 
the inner bay flows also display horizontal shears over 
the shallower area close to the channels (also shown 
by the observations in Fig. 7C). This zone is located 
between the main freshwater discharge points and the 
surface anticyclonic circulation. During the winter, 
there is also a two-layered circulation in both sections. 
However, in winter the maximum outflows (1 cm s–1) 
are located over the margins, while outflows are almost 
null in the centre of the bay. 

The summer results revealed that during that season 
the average behaviour of the bay seems to predominate 
over the variability at this time scale (low frequency, 
with a cut-off time of 30 h). This dominance is clear-
er at the bay mouth, and probably directly correlated 
with the gravitational circulation. In winter, the aver-
age circulation is not as evident as in summer, and the 
variability dominates over the mean behaviour in the 
shallower areas.

CONCLUSIONS

Analysis of the flow structures in the bay and their 
variability, through EOF, revealed a clear two-layer 
response at low-frequency scales (>30 h). Observa-
tions indicated a positive relationship between surface 
currents and winds along the main axis of the bay in 
summer and winter, while negative correlation is ob-
served in the bottom layers. On the other hand, in win-
ter the cross-shore flow responds to winds at the bay 
mouth, showing one-layer flow. In winter, significant 
correlation coefficients between alongshore winds and 
bottom alongshore currents (negative values) indicate 
that the near-bottom currents in the bay respond to a 
wind set-up.

average circulation in summer 2013 (A) and winter 2014 (D). Flows 
across the black dashed sections (A and D) are plotted in images B 
and C for summer, and E and F for winter. Locations of the ADCP 

moorings are shown with grey circles.

At much longer time scales (monthly), averaged 
circulation reveals gravitational circulation at the bay 
mouth, only noticeable in summer. In the inner bay 
(A2), and close to the drainage channels, no clear aver-
aged circulation is observed (low velocities) and varia-
bility induced by wind stress and proximity to the coast 
is greater. Observations show that density structure 
within the bay may be responsible for this behaviour. 
Observed patterns are supported by modelling results 
that make it possible to estimate the spatial variability 
of averaged currents in the low-frequency dynamics. 
Re-circulation areas in the inner bay suggest the need 
for further studies in order to understand the influence 
of spatial variability on spatial distribution of nutrients 
and sediments. 

Finally, both wind-induced and gravitational circu-
lation are evident at the low-frequency band. Although 
gravitational circulation is prevalent in summer due to 
the persistence of the density gradients, episodic on-
shore winds alter this pattern (i.e. there are reversals in 
the estuarine circulation due to sea breezes).
