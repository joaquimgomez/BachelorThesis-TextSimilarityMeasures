Abstract. In this study we investigate the variability in near-
bottom turbidity in Alfacs Bay (in the northwestern Mediter-
ranean Sea). The bay is characterized by a micro-tidal envi-
ronment and seiching activity that may lead to flow veloci-
ties of more than 50 cm s−1. A set of current meters and op-
tical sensors were mounted near the sea bottom to acquire
synchronous hydrodynamic and optical information from the
water column. The time-series observations showed an evi-
dent relation between seiche activity and sediment resuspen-
sion events. The observations of turbidity peaks are consis-
tent with the node–antinode location of the fundamental and
first resonance periods of the bay. The implementation of a
coupled wave–current numerical model shows strong spa-
tial variability of the potential resuspension locations. Strong
wind events are also a mechanism responsible for the resus-
pension of fine sediment within the bay. This is confirmed
by suspended sediment concentration maps derived from
Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We suggest that the sequence of
resuspension events plays an important role in the suspended
sediment concentration, meaning that the occurrence of sed-
iment resuspension events may increase the suspended sed-
iment in subsequent events. The suspended sediment events
likely affect the ecological status of the bay and the sedimen-
tary process over a long-term period.

1 Introduction

Suspended sediment in the water column and subsequent de-
position play a critical role in coastal ecosystems and the
management of coastal environments. High levels of sus-
pended sediment in the water column have substantial impli-
cations for aquatic ecosystems and natural habitats (Ellis et
al., 2002), particularly over longer exposure periods (New-
combe and Macdonald, 1991). Furthermore, sediment sup-
plied from rivers potentially transports significant amounts
of organic matter, pollutants, and heavy metals that may be
deposited on the seabed or even transported offshore (Palan-
ques et al., 2017). The sediment dynamics are relevant in
coastal bays and estuaries due to the large amount of sed-
iment delivered by freshwater and the presence of potential
fine-sediment trapping zones in these areas. In addition, sedi-
ment resuspension significantly contributes to the total nutri-
ent load (Sondergaard et al., 1992) and prevents sunlight pen-
etration (Mehta, 1989). The analysis and prevention of fine
sediment within basins and channels also plays an important
role in port engineering and is used to examine and moni-
tor siltation processes (e.g. Ghosh et al., 2001; van Maren
et al., 2015). Finally, the growth of harmful species, such as
dinoflagellate cysts, may be related to significant local resus-
pension via the mixing of the upper layers, resulting in more
homogenous cyst profiles in the sediment (Giannakourou et
al., 2005).

In coastal areas, sediment transport is related to the hydro-
dynamic conditions. On long timescales, advection processes
determine the final depositional pattern as a function of the
sediment and water current variables (Ogston et al., 2000;
Bever et al., 2009). Hydrodynamic processes driven by wind
waves (Grifoll et al., 2013; Carlin et al., 2016), tides (Fan et
al., 2004; Garel et al., 2009), winds (Sherwood et al., 1994;
Hofmann et al., 2011), surface seiches (Jordi et al., 2008), or
internal seiches (Shteinman et al., 1997) promote the resus-
pension, advection, and settling of fine sediment, conditioned
by the continental sediment sources. Subsequent resuspen-
sion effects due to natural causes also contribute to the re-
working and final deposition of the sediment load (Guillén et
al., 2006; Grifoll et al., 2014a). Moreover, anthropogenic ac-
tivities such as trawling, ship propellers, and waves generated
by vessels, introduce additional energy into the water system
and influence the resuspension, transport, and final sediment
deposition, in particular in shallow waters (e.g. Garel et al.,
2009; Hofmann et al., 2011).

This study focuses on Alfacs Bay (in the northwestern
Mediterranean Sea – in the southern region of the Ebro Delta)
which is a micro-tidal estuary. The bay area is intensively ex-
ploited by commercial activities, including tourism, fishing,
and aquaculture; hence, the ecosystem has a significant eco-
nomic importance. In the past, the bay has been extensively
investigated in terms of its hydrodynamic response (Solé et
al., 2009; Llebot et al., 2014; Cerralbo et al., 2015a, 2016,
2018), tidal wave propagation (Cerralbo et al., 2014), bio-
chemical processes (Llebot et al., 2010, 2011), and optical
water properties (Ramírez-Pérez et al., 2017). The estuary
mainly receives freshwater discharge from the rice fields on
the Ebro River. Several episodes of algal blooms have been
reported and have been linked to increased nutrient con-
centrations, which were possibly triggered by resuspension
mechanisms. Moreover, the presence of harmful bacteria has
been found in bivalves in the region which has negative ef-
fects on aquaculture (Loureiro et al., 2009; Roque et al.,
2009).

The goal of this study was to improve the knowledge re-
garding fine-sediment dynamics in coastal bays and provide
insight into the controlling factors of sediment resuspension
events observed within the Alfacs micro-tidal bay. Using sea-
level heights, water currents, and wind speed measurements
we investigated the driving mechanisms of the resuspension
of fine bottom sediment within the bay. Subsequently, the
spatial and temporal interpretation of the resuspension mech-
anisms were linked to hydrodynamic processes and analysed
via the implementation of a coupled wave–current numer-
ical model. This contribution aims to explain resuspension
mechanisms which may have a positive impact with respect
to management activities (e.g. harmful species resuspension
or algal blooms with negative effects on aquaculture activi-
ties).

The water circulation in Alfacs Bay has been extensively
analysed in previous studies, using observational data sets

and numerical models (Camp and Delgado, 1987; Cerralbo
et al., 2014, 2015a; Llebot et al., 2014). However, fine-
sediment dynamics and their resuspension mechanisms have
not been examined to date. Synchronous optical measure-
ments, in combination with velocity and sea-level measure-
ments, have facilitated an opportunity to investigate the re-
suspension mechanisms in this region. Considering that Al-
facs Bay is a micro-tidal estuary, wind or wind waves are
candidate mechanisms for the dispersal of fine sediment.

2 Methods

2.1 Study area

Alfacs Bay, located in the south of the Ebro Delta, is formed
by the prograding southern spit. The semi-enclosed bay is ap-
proximately 16 km long and 4 km wide. The average depth is
4 m and the maximum depth is about 6.5 m in the middle of
the bay (Fig. 1). A central channel, which is 2.5 km long and
6.5 m deep, connects the bay with the open ocean. Shallow
edges that are around 1–2 m deep are found on both sides of
the bay. To the north, the bay is surrounded by rice fields.
From April to December, these fields spill around 10 m3 s−1

of freshwater that is loaded with nutrients into the bay. These
nutrient rich waters are distributed among several channels
on the eastern side of the delta, close to a sandy beach. The
seabed in the central part of the bay is composed of very fine
sediments (typically 50 %–65 % silt, 30 %–45 % clay, and
approximately 5 % sand) with an increasingly sandy content
towards the edges of the bay (Guillén and Palanques, 1997;
Satta et al., 2013). The bottom of Alfacs Bay is composed of
mud, with a significant clay and sand content (Palacín et al.,
1991). It was discovered that the muddy sediment extends to
the central part of the bay, whereas the sand content increases
near the spit that separates the bay from the open ocean. The
same was found along the southern shallow edge.

The bay is categorized as a salt-wedge estuary (Camp and
Delgado, 1987) and has almost stable stratification all year.
Tidal ranges during spring tides reach around 0.2 m, and the
hydrodynamic fluctuations are controlled by the wind and
modulated by the seiche activity during short periods (Cer-
ralbo et al., 2015a). Both wind and salinity gradients due to
freshwater discharge dominate the water circulation in the
low-frequency band (Solé et al., 2009; Cerralbo et al., 2018).
Intense regional winds from the north and northwest and oro-
graphic effects result in wind jets in the Ebro River valley
(Grifoll et al., 2015, 2016). This offshore wind is charac-
terized by noticeable spatial variability due to the surround-
ing topography (Cerralbo et al., 2015b). The water column
within the bay is usually stratified due to the freshwater dis-
charge, but well-mixed conditions are common during win-
ter as a consequence of the hydrodynamic response to strong
wind forcing (Llebot et al., 2014) and occasionally due to
seiches (Cerralbo et al., 2015a). During the summer, the con-

tribution of the temperature to stratification may also be sub-
stantial (Cerralbo et al., 2015a).

2.2 Measurement campaigns

The bulk of the observational data were collected during a
2-month field campaign from July to mid-September 2013.
Water currents were measured using two 2 MHz acoustic
Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) that were moored in the
mouth (Fig. 1 – A1) and inner bay (Fig. 1 – A2); these in-

struments were configured to record 10 min averaged data
from 10 registers per minute with 25 cm vertical cells. Both
devices were equipped with an optical backscatter sensor
(Campbell Scientific OBS-3), a bottom pressure meter, and a
temperature sensor. The instruments were mounted at the sea
bottom at a depth of 6.5 m, whereas the sensors were 0.25 m
above the seabed. The signals from the OBS instruments
were transformed into nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)
according to the device calibration report. In the past, a lin-
ear relation between the optical signal and the suspended
sediment concentration has been observed in the study area
(Guillén et al., 2000). The ADCP has a 20 cm blanking zone.
Additional sea-level data were obtained using a sea-level
gauge mounted in Sant Carles de la Ràpita harbour (Fig. 1)
and bottom pressure systems from the ADCPs. Atmospheric
data (wind, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, and humid-
ity) were obtained from a land-based station (M-Sc) located
in Sant Carles de la Ràpita, which was mounted 10 m above
the ground.

2.3 Current and wave model implementation

We use the coupled SWAN-ROMS models included in the
COAWST system in order to simulate the hydrodynam-
ics within the bay. The COAWST system (Warner et al.,
2010) consists of several state-of-the-art numerical mod-
els such as ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) for
ocean and coastal circulation and SWAN (Simulating Waves
Nearshore) for surface wind-wave simulation. SWAN is a
third-generation numerical wave model that computes ran-
dom, short-crested waves in coastal regions with shallow wa-
ter and ambient currents (Booij et al., 1999). It is based on the
wave action balance with sources and sinks and incorporates
state-of-the-art formulations of the processes of wave gener-
ation, dissipation, and wave–wave interactions. ROMS is a
three-dimensional circulation model which solves the primi-
tive variables on a σ -level in the vertical and horizontal reg-
ular grid. Numerical aspects of ROMS are described in de-
tail in Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005). In the COAWST
system, the wave model provides hydrodynamic parameters
(i.e. significant wave height, average wave periods, wave
propagation direction, near-bottom orbital velocity, and wave
energy dissipation rate) to the water circulation model. The
ocean model provides water depth, sea surface elevation,
and current velocity to the wave model. The variables ex-
change is made “online” during the simulation processes,
via the Model Coupling Toolkit (Jacob et al., 2005), where
a multi-processes message passing interface (MPI) protocol
is used to distribute the computations among several nodes.
The COAWST system also includes different formulations
to parameterize the wave–current bottom boundary layer and
the wave effect on currents (Warner et al., 2008; Kumar et
al., 2012).

The implementation of the COAWST system in Alfacs
Bay consists of a regular grid of 186×101 points with a spa-

tial resolution of 100 m (in both the eastward and northward
grid directions) and 12σ levels in the vertical direction. De-
tails regarding the implementation and the skill assessment
of the ROMS model in Alfacs Bay are provided by Cerralbo
et al. (2015a). The same regular grid is used by the SWAN
model. A 2-year water circulation simulation (2012–2013)
was performed in order to obtain realistic three-dimensional
temperature and salinity fields. The barotropic time step for
ROMS is set to 30 s, and in SWAN the wave field is solved at
a time interval of 3600 s. The interval time between the ex-
change of variables for ROMS and SWAN was established
in 3600 s. For both simulations, water motion at the open
boundary was forced by depth-averaged velocities and sea-
level measurements at A1 (data interval of 600 s). The fresh-
water inputs are distributed on eight points and simulate the
main rice channels with a total discharge of 10 m3 s−1 (Cer-
ralbo et al., 2015a).

The bottom boundary layer was parameterized using the
combined wave–current (Styles and Glenn, 2000) that was
adopted in ROMS and SWAN coupling (Warner et al., 2008).
The input parameters for the model are the velocity com-
ponents and wave characteristics near the bottom (wave pe-
riod, wave direction, and wave orbital direction). For each
computational step, an initial assessment of bed roughness
length is estimated as a function of the grain size, ripples,
and sediment transport. Consequently, the pure current bot-
tom stress (τc) and pure wave bottom stress (τw) are com-
puted as follows:

τc =

(
u2+ v2

)
κ2

ln2 (z/z0)

τw = 0.5fwu

b, (2)

where z is the vertical coordinate, z0 is the total bottom
roughness length, u and v are the water current components,
ub is the orbital velocity, κ is the von Kármán constant, and
fw is the Madsen wave-friction factor. The maximum bot-
tom stress under wave–current conditions is computed as
(Soulsby, 1997)

τwc = τc

. (3)

The wave effects from currents are considered using vortex-
force formalism, which is included in COAWST. This ap-
proach considers the effect from gravity waves on the mean
flow, and was tested in different experimental and real con-
figurations by Kumar et al. (2012).

3 Results

3.1 Observations

In order to investigate the suspended sediment events within
Alfacs Bay, we used a subset of the total observations

recorded at A2: from 2 to 8 August 2013. This is because
the subset data selected include the main hydrodynamic con-
ditions likely to increase the near-bottom turbidity. Figure 2
shows the time series recorded at A2 in terms of NTU from
the OBS, measured sea-level height (the sea-level height
measured at A1 is also shown), bottom current speed in
m s−1 at A1, and wind speed and direction measured at M-Sc
(see Fig. 1). The sea-level height reference was obtained by
subtracting the mean value of the pressure meter time series
provided by the ADCP.

Two typical wind conditions are considered (Fig. 2a, b):
sea breeze and the northwesterly winds (Cerralbo et al.,
2015a). The sea breeze is associated with an increase in wind
speed during the central hours of the day (approximately
from 11:00 to 18:00 GMT with a wind direction within the
range of approximately 30 to 180◦). From a daily point of
view, this seems evident during the 1 to 6 August period.
A different pattern is observed during the wind speed peak
(7 to 8 August) when 330◦ wind directions were measured.
This corresponds to an offshore wind typical for the region
(northwesterly winds known as “mistral” winds).

During the analysis period (on 3 August), a seiche event
was also captured. This seiche event was previously de-
scribed (hydrodynamically) in Cerralbo et al. (2015a) reveal-
ing an oscillation (of 1 h periods) in sea level and currents.
This oscillation is characterized by a node (roughly located
at A2) where the velocities reach a maximum, and an antin-
ode (approximately located at A1) where the amplitude of
the sea-level oscillation reaches a maximum (see sea-level
height at A1 in comparison to A2 in Fig. 2c). The homoge-
neous vertical profile in velocities measured at A2 is shown
in Fig. 3, with velocity peaks in the order of 0.5 m s−1 in the
water column, in the along-shore direction (i.e. following the
axis of the bay). The near-bottom water current speeds at A2
(Fig. 2d) show fluctuations with peaks over 0.1 m s−1, ex-
cept for the previously mentioned seiche event during which
peaks rose to 0.4 m s−1.

The near-bottom turbidity shows a fluctuating behaviour
with values ranging from almost 0 to over 10 NTU (Fig. 2e).
Three distinct events with high turbidity are observed. These
events are E1 (covering the period from 08:00 GMT on
3 August to 10:00 GMT on 5 August), E2 (from 03:00 to
12:00 GMT on 6 August), and E3 (from 08:00 GMT on 7 Au-
gust to 15:00 GMT on 8 August). The maximum turbid-
ity is measured during the E1 event (maximum turbidity of
41.1 NTU). This event also lasts longer than the E2 (maxi-
mum turbidity of 4.6 NTU) and E3 (maximum turbidity of
12.1 NTU) events.

3.2 Skill assessment near the sea bottom

The performance of the water circulation model used in this
study was examined in terms of sea level, water currents, and
temperature/salinity evolution in previous research (Cerralbo
et al., 2014). However, in this work we pay attention to the

near-bottom velocities due to their relevant role in the sedi-
ment resuspension and transport dynamics. Thus, the skill as-
sessment of the near-bottom velocities at A1 and A2 is anal-
ysed using a Taylor diagram (Taylor, 2001). This diagram
characterizes the similarity between numerical model and
observations using their correlation, the root mean square dif-

ference (RMSD), and the amplitude of their variations (rep-
resented by their standard deviations). The skill of the model
improves when the triangles are closer to the observation ref-
erence point in the diagram which denotes full agreement
between the model and the observations (Fig. 4). In general,
the model results showed good agreement with the observa-

tions in the prevalent along-shelf direction, with correlations
larger than 0.5 and RMSD values below 1. In addition, the
water current fluctuations are well represented in the model
because the normalized standard deviation is close to 1 at
both measuring points.

3.3 Modelled bottom stress

The bottom stress is obtained from the coupled numerical
model implemented in Alfacs Bay. Figures 5 and 6 show
different snapshots of the modelling results to examine the
bottom stress pattern for two components (i.e. wave-induced
and current-induced bottom stress). These results correspond
to the different episodes identified from the previous ob-
servational analysis. The plot scale of the bottom stress is
transformed in log10 for clarity. During the E1 case (3 Au-
gust 2013, 10:00 GMT) the bottom stress is mainly caused
by currents (Fig. 5a, c, e). Maximum values of 0.15 Pa for
the combined bottom stress are obtained in the centre of the
bay, and at the mouth. This episode corresponds to a seiche
event, and the spatial variability of the bottom stress is con-
sistent with the spatial pattern of the node–antinode position.

Figure 4. Taylor diagram comparing the error metrics between the
observations and model results for the near-bottom currents. A1 and
A2 correspond to the ADCP locations shown in Fig. 1.

This means that the maximum combined bottom stress (as-
sociated with maximum water currents) corresponds to the
node position (minimum sea-level amplitude). In contrast,
the minimum bottom stress corresponds to the antinode po-
sition (maximum sea-level amplitude). The A2 position is
located near the node, where the water currents are at their
maximum during the seiche event (0.08 Pa for combined bot-
tom stress). It is worth mentioning the node–antinode pattern
of the current-induced bottom stress, which would presum-
ably indicate a large spatial variability of the resuspension
process within the bay.

After the seiche activity (second stage of E1), the wind
speed increases due to the sea breeze and the current-induced
bottom stress (5 August 2013, 08:00 GMT) decreases signif-
icantly, particularly in the centre of the bay (Fig. 5b, d, f).
The bottom stress distribution shows how the maximum val-
ues are obtained near the shoreline (2.2 Pa) due to the contri-
bution of the wave-induced bottom stress. At A2, the com-
bined bottom stress is equal to 0.03 Pa (which is presumably
too small to induce resuspension). For this event, the wave
field during the sea breeze is shown in Fig. 7; it reveals that
the maximum significant wave height (equal to 0.3 m) occurs
near the northern and southern shallow edges which is con-
sistent with the maximum wave-induced bottom stress.

The bottom-stress pattern during episode E2 (Fig. 6a, c, e)
is similar to the second stage of episode E1. Both wave and
current bottom stress (08:00 GMT, 7 August) tend to be low
at A2 in comparison to the seiche event. Substantial bottom
stress is only observed on the shallow edges of the bay due
to the wave action originating from the sea breeze.

During the E3 episode (northwesterly wind; Fig. 6b, d, f),
the combined bottom stress (23:00 GMT, 8 August) is domi-
nated by both wave and current action. The southern part of

plotted in log10 scale and the vertical range differs between both bottom stress distributions.

the bay shows that the maximum wave-induced bottom stress
is consistent with the wave climate (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the
current-induced bottom stress presents non-negligible val-
ues within the bay. Focusing on A2, both mechanisms con-
tribute in a similar manner (wave and current bottom stress
are 0.09 and 0.06 Pa respectively) to the combined bottom
stress.

4 Discussion

The synchronous time series of the meteo-oceanographic
variables and turbidity shown in Fig. 2, in combination with
the bottom stress model provides a good opportunity to char-
acterize the turbidity peaks measured at A2. During the first
stage of the E1 episode, the bottom current speed responds
to the node–antinode pattern with velocities that increase to
0.4 m s−1 at A2. This increase of the bottom velocity causes
bottom sediment resuspension and a turbidity peak (Fig. 2).
Even if an increase in wind speed occurs (peaks that reach

8 m s−1), the oscillating pattern of 1 h periods of the current
(see Fig. 3) polarizes strongly, following the along-shore di-
rection. This suggests an increase in turbidity due to the se-
iche instead of the wind-driven current. The analysis of the
modelled bottom stress during the E1 episode (Fig. 5) also
suggests that the seiche is the main mechanism for turbid-
ity increase at A2 during the first stage of the E1 event. Re-
suspension mechanisms in the water environment caused by
seiches have been mentioned in observational investigations
(Niedda and Greppi, 2007; Chung et al., 2009; Jordi et al.,
2011). However, these studies have not explained the high

spatial variability of the importance of the seiche-induced
resuspension mechanism, which is implied by the modelled
current-induced bottom stress. This means observational re-
sults regarding turbidity variability may differ significantly
as a function of the location of the node–antinode and its
consequent maximum and minimum velocities.

The turbidity still showed large values after the seiche had
already dissipated and the bottom current had decreased dur-
ing the second stage of the E1 event. Typical sea-breeze wind

on 4 August, which was unrelated to the measured bottom
current speed. Llebot et al. (2014) and Cerralbo et al. (2015a)
stated that the water current profiles due to winds observed
in Alfacs Bay do not imply a barotropic shape in the wa-
ter velocity profiles; this suggests a different behaviour near
the bottom, compared with the surface, related to wind set-
up phenomena. Consequently, the local resuspension due to
wind seems unlikely in this area of the bay. It seems more
feasible that high turbidity measured at A2 during E1 (sec-
ond stage) is associated with advection of fine sediment that
was previously resuspended by seiches or by sea-breeze ac-
tivity on the shallow edges of the bay, with a subsequent
transport towards the middle of the bay. This last mechanism
would also explain the turbidity peak measured on 5 Au-
gust at 00:00 GMT, after the fine-sediment settling occurred
within the bay. The sediment advection within the bay is dif-
ficult to confirm according to our data, but Alfacs bathymetry
shows a characteristic shallow edge near the coastline (water
depths below 2 m; see Fig. 1). On these shallow edges the
bottom stress increases by 0.8 Pa, suggesting potential sed-
iment resuspension. The shallow edge may be a source of
fine sediment under energetic wind conditions in the case of
fine-sediment availability. Therefore, the advection of resus-
pended sediment highlights the relevance of the water current
patterns within the bay for turbidity measurements.

Episode E2 is attributed to a sea-breeze mechanism. This
event is qualitatively less important in terms of the turbidity
measured at A2. The comparison of the sea-breeze events on
4 and 6 August (both have similar wind and bottom current
speed but different turbidity values) seems to indicate the rel-
evance of the previous events and the subsequent advection
of fine sediment, following the mechanism explained previ-
ously. Similar to the second stage of E1, the bottom stress is
low (below 0.02 Pa) in the central basin of the bay, indicating
that local resuspension is unlikely. Consequently, the turbid-
ity measured at A2 is probably due to advection processes
of suspended sediment from the shallowest areas (combined
bottom stress more than 0.8 Pa) in the central basin.

Finally, episode E3 corresponds to a strong northwesterly
wind event with wind speeds in excess of 12 m s−1. The bot-
tom current speed does not show significantly higher val-
ues during this episode, in comparison with calm periods.
However, in contrast to the sea breeze, the sea waves gen-
erated by the northwesterly wind conditions are relevant to
the resuspension mechanisms due to an increase in the wave-
induced bottom stress (Fig. 6b, d, f). Unfortunately, the set-
up of the ADCP did not allow us to record the oscillatory pat-
tern derived from the orbital velocities generated by waves,
and the relative importance of each resuspension mechanism
(i.e. wind or waves) is difficult to quantify.

E2 and E3 are examples of two mechanisms that may in-
crease the turbidity: wind-driven current and wind waves. In
Alfacs Bay, the roles of these mechanisms in sediment resus-
pension are less clear that the role of seiches, as the former
are a function of wind speed without any clear correlation
between the wind module and the observed turbidity. The re-
suspension of fine sediment due to wind and wind waves in
shallow environments has been reported in literature (Luet-
tich et al., 1990; Ogston et al., 2000; Guillén et al., 2006;
Bever et al., 2011; Grifoll et al., 2014b; Hawley et al., 2014;
Martyanov and Ryabchenko, 2016; López et al., 2017). Some
of these studies highlight the complexity of the sediment pro-
cesses due to the temporal and spatial variability of the im-
portance of resuspension mechanisms and the presence of
available material to be resuspended. Apparently, this is the
case in our observations, because similar wind conditions do
not imply the same turbidity measurements. A good exam-
ple is the sea-breeze wind events on 4, 5 and 6 August dur-
ing which different turbidity values were observed. As men-
tioned in the previous section, advective fluxes and the se-
quence of events may play an important role in the observed
water turbidity. Many authors have reported an apparent in-
fluence from advective fluxes correlated with the suspended
sediment concentration after an initial deposition of fine sed-
iment (Sherwood et al., 1994; Ogston et al., 2000; Guillén
et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2008; Bever et al., 2009; Grifoll et
al., 2014b). This means that on longer timescales, advection

of sediment by currents may redistribute sediment and deter-
mine final deposition patterns (Wright and Nittrouer, 1995).
This may be the mechanism responsible for the high turbid-
ity observed under relatively low hydrodynamic conditions.
For instance, the sea-breeze event on 2 August does not cause
high turbidity, in contrast to the event on 5 August (second
stage of the E1 event); this may indicate that an energetic
event (i.e. seiche) could mobilize sediment, which is then
easily resuspended in subsequent events. The lack of propor-
tionality of the resuspension related to hydrodynamics is also
found in extended data time series, where divergences are
mainly associated with sediment availability on the bottom,
among other factors (e.g. in Wiberg et al., 1994 or López et
al., 2017). In the case of Alfacs Bay, more extended observa-
tions may clarify the relation between wind intensity, wind
waves, seiches, and the amount of suspended sediment and
fluxes, taking the sequence of energetic events into account.

The sediment distribution in Alfacs Bay (high percentage
of silt and clay in the central basin and sand prevalence on the
southern, eastern, and western shores) is consistent with the
modelling results shown in this study, where larger bottom
stress values were obtained in the lateral shallow edges due
to the contribution of the wave-induced bottom stress in shal-
low areas. However, the deposition mechanism is a complex
process, composed of an initial settling and a subsequent dis-
persal, as described in Wright and Nittrouer (1995). Further
sediment transport simulations, including those considering
sediment classes and erosion and settling effects, would help
to investigate the sediment settling dynamics and its final de-
position. These processes should include the cohesive nature
of the fine sediment or other phenomena, such as armouring
or bioturbation, which may modify the physical properties of
the sediment layers (van Ledden et al., 2004; Amoudry and
Souza, 2011).

The characteristics of the bay, such as the relatively nar-
row and shallow entrance, favour the trapping of fine sedi-
ments, fed either by the freshwater outflow or the exchange
between the open sea and the inner bay. The trapping effect
of the bay may entail the presence of a thin surface bottom
layer of fine sediment that is easily subject to resuspension.
This behaviour is typical of shallow and sheltered environ-
ments such as lagoons or lakes. According to Luettich et
al. (1990) and Hofmann et al. (2011), regular resuspension
events in sheltered and shallow water bodies prevent sedi-
ment consolidation and the formation of a cohesive sediment
layer. This could explain the high turbidity values observed
in Alfacs Bay under relatively weak conditions, such as sea-
breeze events, which would likely not occur if the sediment
was cohesive.

The Sentinel-2 satellites provide imagery which allows
for the further identification of scenarios with resuspension
linked to hydrodynamic forcing. Figure 8 shows the total
suspended matter (TSM in mgr L−1) for Alfacs Bay in two
differentiate scenarios: northwesterly wind and calm condi-
tions. Without access to local calibration data, a generalized

approach for TSM retrieval has been applied. Using the Sen-
tinel Application Platform (SNAP; v. 6.0.0) the Level 1C
Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) data were con-
verted to geophysical values (suspended sediment concen-
tration) using the most recent version of the water quality
processor “C2RCC” (v. 1.0); the C2RCC processor was run
using default values. Following processing in SNAP the data
were post-processed (tiles merged, and data noise corrected)
and TSM maps were created. Northwesterly wind condi-
tions increase the TSM substantially in the southeastern shal-
low edges; hence, this would be a source for the subsequent
advection of fine sediment towards the central bay, as was
stated in the previous paragraphs. In contrast, the values of
TSM decrease significantly during calm conditions.

Also, the proximity of the Ebro River mouth (15 km at
north) may increase the suspended sediment within the bay
under specific circumstances. River discharge is the main
driver of the Ebro River plume, followed by wind and re-
gional oceanic circulation (Fernández-Nóvoa et al., 2015;
Mestres et al., 2003). Analysis of the turbid plume by re-
mote sensing products indicate that more than 70 % of the
plume extension was located south of the river mouth, influ-
enced by the regional oceanic circulation (Fernández-Nóvoa
et al., 2015). Other external sediment sources may be asso-
ciated with freshwater discharge from channels, overwash in
the bar, flash floods from small creeks, or aeolian transport.
A complete study of the suspended sediment dynamics will
provide objective information to address the problem of de-
grading water quality within the bay, and will assess how to
make use of natural mechanisms to limit undesirable concen-
trations of nutrients or pollutants. This applies in particular
to harmful algae blooms that are prone to occur in the area
under present and future conditions.

5 Conclusions

The observational set and the wave–current numerical results
obtained for Alfacs Bay allowed for a thorough investigation
of the resuspension mechanisms of fine sediment. The re-
sults indicate evidence of a clear mechanism of resuspension
induced by eventual seiche events, which according to the
bottom stress patterns may have a relevant spatial variability
within the bay consistent with the node–antinode position.
The wind and wind wave mechanisms are also responsible
for fine-sediment resuspension during energetic wind events,
especially in shallow areas of the bay. A similar contribu-
tion of current-induced bottom stress and wave-induced bot-
tom stress in the assessment of the combined wave–current
bottom stress is found for the northwesterly wind case. In
the case of the sea breeze, the wave-induced bottom stress
prevails. The lack of proportionality between the turbidity
and the hydrodynamics highlights the relevance of the se-
quence of the events, suggesting an effect of advective sed-
iment fluxes within the bay (from the lateral shallow edges
to the middle of the bay) which increase the suspended sedi-
ment concentration. The trapping effect of the bay may entail
the presence of a thin surface layer of fine sediment that is
easily involved in resuspension, neglecting the expected co-
hesive effects. However, these points deserve further analysis
using extended data sets and sediment transport modelling.
The exchange of fine sediment between the bay and the open
sea is also evident according to remote sensing images. How-
ever, these points require further analysis in the same fash-
ion as the previously mentioned factors. As the Ebro Delta
is a region with high-anthropogenic pressure, this research
may contribute to furthering integrated development plans
that consider sustainable aquaculture activities and climate
change mitigation in the region.
