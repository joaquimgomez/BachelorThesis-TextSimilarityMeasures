Against the background of possible substantial sea-level rise, an important question is, to what 16 
extent are coastal societies able to adapt? This question is often answered in the negative by 17 
referring to sinking islands and submerged mega-cities. While these risks are real, the picture is 18 
incomplete because it lacks consideration of adaptation. This Perspective explores societies’ 19 
abilities to adapt to 21st century sea-level rise by integrating perspectives from coastal 20 
engineering, economics, finance and social sciences, and provides a comparative analysis of a set 21 
of cases that vary in technological limits, and economic, financing, and social conflict barriers to 22 
coastal adaptation.  23 

Recent literature has reinforced concerns about possible substantial sea-level rise (SLR) due to rapid  24 
melting of ice sheets1 which may lead to 21st century global mean SLR of 2 m or more.2–4 25 
Discomfortingly, the potential for high-end SLR may remain even if the ambition of the Paris 26 
Agreement to limit the temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels is met. This is 27 
due to the large uncertainties associated with ice-sheet responses and sea levels continuing to rise for 28 
thousands of years even if greenhousegas concentration will be stabilized during the 21st century.5,6  29 

Against this background, an important question is to what extent societies are able to adapt and 30 
maintain human settlements safe from SLR and associated extremes during the 21st century. Following 31 
the current sea-level rise literature and the media, this question is often seemingly answered in the 32 
negative by referring to, for example, the “complete flooding and submergence of entire mega-cities.”5 33 
or showing emblematic cities around the world submerged by the sea.7 While these headlines illustrate 34 
that SLR may constitute a major challenge to coastal societies, they are incomplete and possibly 35 
misleading in that they neglect coastal adaptation. This is specifically true because adaptation could 36 
reduce some coastal impacts by several orders of magnitude.8,9 Furthermore, coastal societies have a 37 
long history of adapting to environmental change and local SLR because coasts are amongst the most 38 
dynamic environments on Earth.10 For example, a number of coastal mega-cities in river deltas have 39 
experienced, and adapted to, relative SLR of several meters caused by land subsidence during the 20th 40 
century.11  41 

Efforts that integrate across biophysical and social dimensions of SLR impacts and adaptation are 42 
limited in the otherwise vast literature on SLR. This perspective provides such an effort and addresses 43 
the question of societies' abilities to adapt to 21st century SLR by analysing a set of diverse cases from 44 
around the world in terms of four main factors that have been empirically found to constrain societies' 45 
abilities to adapt (Fig. 1). These factors are defined in Box 1. We assess technical limits and economic 46 
barriers under 21st century SLR and socio-economic development, assuming current technology. 47 
Following the empirical social science literature on adaptation barriers,12–14 we assess financing 48 
barriers and social conflict barriers mainly for the present situation with limited speculation on how 49 
these barriers may evolve during the century. 50

and social sub-systems and my be constrained by technological limits, and economic, financing, and 53 
social conflict barriers. Adapted from Nicholls et  al.15 54 

 55 

The purpose of this effort is not to analyse which criteria are actually used in decision making nor to 56 
prescribe how decisions should be made. For example, the presence of an economic barrier does not 57 
mean that coastal societies actually decide using social benefit-cost analysis, nor that societies should 58 
not adapt, because there are many other reasons for adaptation beyond monetary ones, such as human 59 
safety or nature conservation. Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to study how different factors 60 
combine in a given case, so that further research and policy attention can be aimed at those factors that 61 
are critical in the given case. The combination of constraints found has thereby indications on possible 62 
pathways for overcoming these. For example, the presence of both finance and economic barriers 63 
suggest that future efforts should focus on grant finance, while if only financing barriers are present, 64 
concessional and private finance may also be sought.16  65 



3 

The cases have been chosen to cover different coastal landforms, income groups, types of coastal 66 
impacts, as well as urban and rural settings (Table 1). While the cases we consider here are coastal, the 67 
framework is generic and can be applied for integrated analysis in other fields of adaptation. 68 

  69 

Box 1: Adaptation limits and barriers 

A growing literature has categorized factors that have been observed to constrain adaptation. This 
literature distinguishes between limits beyond which human activities cannot be maintained and
barriers which can be overcome through adequate efforts, technology, deployment of economic and
human resources, management and institutional change.14,17–19 For social constraints it is preferable to 
use the term barrier rather than limit, because what may be considered a social limit is mutable and
depends on cultural context and human values.12 Here, we consider the following four adaptation 
constraints, because they i) have been found to be most relevant in previous empirical analysis;13,20,21

and ii) represent the perspectives of the main groups of actors involved in coastal adaptation. 

Technological limits arise when there are no adaptation options available to effectively reduce the 
impacts of SLR, including the consideration of the time needed for implementing options. Asserting
technical limits requires the subjective choice of an adaptation goal.12 Here we consider the goal of 
maintaining human settlements safe from SLR and associated extremes through protection and
accommodation measures as this perspective has been prominently represented in societies for
centuries by coastal engineering.10 We deliberatively exclude the coastal adaptation measure of retreat, 
because it is, in principle, always possible and hence never technologically limited. Asserting technical
limits also entails the choice of a level of acceptable risks (or probability or consequence) as any 
coastal protection or accommodation measure may fail and there is no absolute or objective measure
of effectiveness or safety.17 

Economic barriers arise if the implementation and maintenance of adaptation are more costly in
monetary terms than the impacts they avoid, as assessed through social benefit-cost analysis (BCA). 
BCA comes along with several well-known limitations that have been widely discussed in the climate
change literature. First, not all costs and benefits can be adequately monetized.22 Second, results are 
very sensitive to the choice of the discount rate applied.22–24 Third, costs and benefits are aggregated 
across actors, which means that socially preferred options may differ from those preferred by
individual actor.25,26 To capture this issue specifically relevant to adaptation, we include the barrier of 
social conflicts as described below. Nevertheless, BCA constitutes a prominent public decision making
perspective on coastal adaptation and is legally prescribed in countries such as the US, the UK and
The Netherlands. 

Financing barriers arise if it is difficult to access financial resources for adaptation, including from
public budgets, development and climate finance and private sources.18 This perspective has been 
included, because it is central to the adaption finance activities under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as to donor and development finance
organisations and public authorities involved in funding adaptation.  

Social conflict barriers arise whenever stakeholders' conflicting interests impede or exacerbate 
adaptation. In the social sciences, the concept of social conflict is a fundamental one for understanding
why or why not societies manage to act collectively in that they develop informal and formal
institutions such as culture, laws, policies, social norms and conventions that guide human behaviour
to resolve social conflicts.27–31 Social conflicts may arise due to diverging private interests (e.g., a
Catalan tourist operator favouring beach nourishment and an environmental activist opposing), 
diverging public interests at different levels of administration (e.g., conflicting building codes at
Federal, State and City levels in New York; also called institutional crowdedness barrier13) or between 
actors' interests and existing institutions (e.g., populations of remote islands opposing a population
centralisation policy in the Maldives; also called cultural constraints,12,18 or political (economy) 
barriers20,25). Here, we apply the broad concept of social conflict, because this represents the 
perspectives of diverse stakeholders involved and constitutes the first step in any analysis of
governance issues. From there, analysis can proceed to exploring more specific questions regarding



4 

the nature of the social conflict and how this may be overcome.14,30

Table 1: Coastal adaptation cases considered in this paper, their coastal and social characteristics, 72 
and adaptation constraints found in maintaining human settlements safe from 21st century sea-73 
level rise. * Mean population density values are based on the UN-adjusted GPWv4 year 2010 74 
population density dataset.32 For the administrative boundaries of the case studies we used the Global 75 
Administrative Areas (GADM) dataset version 2.0 (http://www.gadm.org/). For New York City, Ho 76 
Chi Minh City and the Maldives mean population density was calculated for the entire administrative 77 
area of the city. For Catalonia, Bangladesh and the Netherlands mean population density was 78 
calculated for the LECZ (low elevation coastal zone; areas ≤ 10m and hydrologically connected to the 79 
ocean). For Bangladesh, the districts of Cox’s Basar, Bandarban, Chittagong, Ramgamati and 80 
Khagrachhari were excluded as they are outside the delta. For the definition of the LECZ we used 81 
CGIAR-CSI SRTM v4.1 elevation data.33 ** Population density for the capital island of Malé taken 82

Bangladesh 85 

Bangladesh, largely situated on the delta of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna rivers, is widely 86 
recognised as one of the most hazardous large countries on Earth, having rural population densities 87 
exceeding 1,000 people/km2, and being impacted by river and sea floods, salinization and drought, 88 
exacerbated by climate change, SLR and land subsidence.34,35 There are extensive diked polder 89 
systems which protect agriculture, against most flooding (Fig. 2), but failures during more extreme 90 
tropical storms are common, causing agricultural damage. Upgrade of these dikes is ongoing and 91 
higher reliability can be expected in the future. Experiments are also in progress with controlled 92 
sedimentation to raise land levels, termed tidal river management.36,37 All of these measures are part of 93 
Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100,38 a holistic, integrated and long-term plan that the government is 94 
currently developing, learning from the Dutch Delta Programme experience. 95 

Technological limits. From a technological point of view, high-end SLR would be extremely 96 
challenging, but the technological measures that are needed either exist or are being developed. For 97 
example, in rural areas, tidal river management combined with of order 109 tonnes of sediment 98 
delivered by the rivers per year offers great potential to build land elevation with sea level.39 Changes 99 
in land use such as from agriculture to aquaculture are also feasible and already occurring. Urban areas 100 
would need to be protected with more conventional methods. Rising salinity is a challenge which 101 



5 

might be countered by a range of measures such as salt tolerant crops and freshwater reservoirs. While 102 
these options are available much more assessment and trials of their application are required, 103 
recognising that this may be made more challenging due to other barriers mentioned below.40 104 

Economic barriers. With a dense rural and urban population, adaptation provides large direct and 105 
indirect monetary benefits, such as avoided damages and reduced health effects of flood events. All the 106 
options mentioned above are expected to have benefits exceeding their costs, although it is hard to find 107 
detailed analyses demonstrating this.  108 

Financing barriers. Bangladesh is the biggest recipient of climate adaptation funds, and is also a 109 
major recipeint of donor aid, receiving $2.6 billion in 2013.41 Many NGOs such as the Red Cross Red 110 
Crescent are active, such as in the provision of cyclone shelters. Significant efforts have been funded, 111 
but future funding needs are large38 and the maintenance of existing polder systems is often 112 
constrained by a lack of funds.42 113 

Social conflicts. Bangladesh’s dense population and intense land use means it is easy for conflict to 114 
emerge. For example, conversion of agriculture to aquaculture has given rise to conflicts associated to 115 
land grabbing, salinization impacts and reduced labour demand.43 Tidal river management removes 116 
large areas of land from use while the land is being flooded and raised, which affects households 117 
income. At the same time, there is profound change with major rural to urban migration and 118 
agriculture progressively diminishing relative to the national economy, so adaptation is occurring on 119 
an evolving stage.44 120

rising sea levels. Courtesy Robert Nicholls. 125

Catalonia 127 

The 600 km long Catalan coastal zone in the Spanish Mediterranean concentrates about 62% of the 128 
population and about 65 % of the GDP of Catalonia, with tourism being the main economic activity 129 
(>10% of GDP).45 The major SLR-induced impacts are related to enhanced shoreline erosion due to 130 
the combination of narrow beaches and lack of accommodation space.46 The SLR impacts of coastal 131 
flooding and inundation are low due to the steep coastal topography, with the exception of some 132 
lowlands.47,48 Currently, adaptation measures are oriented towards maintaining beaches for recreation 133 
and enhancing protection of the hinterland through artificial nourishment (i.e., counteracting shoreline 134 
erosion by replacing the eroded sand). 135 

Technological limits. There are no technological limits for these adaptation measures. Some 136 
challenges relate to the availability of adequate sand volumes for nourishment,49 because the sand used 137 
for nourishment needs to have a grain size compatible (i.e., similar or coarser) with the eroded sand or 138 
nourishment needs to be combined with additional measures to reduce sediment mobility. In the past, 139 
nourishment has not always been effective because it was carried out mainly reactively when major 140 
erosion impacts were already observed. 141 

Economic barriers. Generally, beach nourishment is highly beneficial in areas of tourism development 142 
due to the large contribution of coastal tourism to Catalan GDP.50 Empirical studies have found that 143 
beaches in front of hotels raise prices of hotel rooms by up to 17% along the Catalan coast.51 Unit 144 
costs for sand are, however, expected to rise in the future, because the shallow near-shore sites from 145 
which most of the sand is gained today are expected to be exhausted, which will increase the distance 146 
between sand source sites and nourishment sites. 147 



6 

Financing barriers. Currently, there are no financing barriers as beach nourishment is publicly 148 
financed by the Spanish Government. The required annual nourishment costs will, however, increase 149 
with SLR and it is not clear how long public finance can be maintained in the future. 150 

Social conflicts. Increasing social activism is questioning the long-term sustainability of a beach 151 
nourishment strategy due to its potential negative ecological impacts on high-value coastal ecosystems 152 
such as endemic Posidonia sea-grass meadows.52 In addition, the multi-level governance structure for 153 
coastal zone management generates conflicts between national, regional and local administrations,  154 
limiting the implementation of effective adaptation policy.53 The Spanish Central Government takes 155 
beach nourishment decisions within the so-called Maritime-Terrestrial Public Domain, the Regional 156 
Government is responsible for land use planning outside this domain, and the local municipalities are 157 
responsible for urban planning adjacent to this domain.54,55 For example, in 2016 a group of coastal 158 
municipalities northwards of Barcelona opposed obtaining sediment for beach nourishment by 159 
nearshore dredging claiming that this would promote unsustainable coastal management. 160

Ho Chi Minh City 163 

As a fast-growing delta metropolis, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, is heavily affected by frequent 164 
flooding today, a phenomenon that will exacerbate with SLR, changes in precipitation extremes and 165 
present rates of land subsidence of about 1 cm/year.56 A combination of adaptation measures could be 166 
implemented to substantially reduce flood risk, including i) building a system of ring dikes around the 167 
urban area,57 ii) elevating districts where people and assets most concentrate, and iii) retrofitting 168 
buildings to reduce damage in households and small businesses. So far, only limited private adaptation 169 
has been carried out in the form of retrofitting existing houses and elevating land for new houses (Fig. 170 
3). 171 

Technological limits. Considering all measures together, there are no apparent technological limits to 172 
coastal adaptation. Elevating districts should effectively reduce flood risks even under high-end SLR. 173 
As SLR progresses, all of these measures will need to be combined and substantially upgraded over 174 
time.58 175 

Economic barriers. Investing into most of the aforementioned measures promises high benefit-cost 176 
ratios.59 Using a discount rate of 5%, for example, elevating areas at high risk and retrofitting 177 
buildings would have 21st century benefit-cost ratios of 8-11 and 15, respectively, and net present 178 
values of US$ 33-48 billion and US$ 69-73 billion, respectively, assuming a SLR between 50 and 180 179 
cm. Under the same assumptions, a ring dike would have benefit-cost-ratios of 1.2 for 50 cm SLR, but 180 
negative for 180 cm SLR. 181 

Financing barriers. Adaptation faces deep financing challenges. So far, the city has not managed to 182 
secure finance for the highly beneficial flood protection options, even in the face of vast damage and 183 
nuisance during every monsoon season. A ring dike, for example, would require investments in the 184 
order of US$ 1.4 to 2.6 billion.60 185 

Social conflicts. One conflict that has been found to inhibit large scale investment is disagreement on  186 
adaption measures between authorities at various administrative levels.57 For example, the Ministry of 187 
Agriculture and Rural Development favours the ring dike, whereas the city government opposes it for 188 
both environmental reasons and fear of protests.61 A ring dike would likely trigger conflict between 189 
urban and rural populations, since rural citizens outside the ring dike will suffer even greater floods. 190 
Building-scale measures would not lead to this particular conflict, but they would also not keep water 191 
out of Ho Chi Minh’s streets, hampering the transformation of the city into the modern business hub 192 
that it aspires to be. 193

The Maldives 200 

The Maldives consist of 1,192 atoll islands with a mean elevation of approximately 1.5 m above mean 201 
sea level. One third of the country's population of 400,000 lives in the urban capital island of Malé 202 
(Fig. 4), which is one of the world’s most densely populated cities.62 To relieve this population 203 
pressure the Maldives have constructed a new island, Hulhumalé, on a reef-flat directly adjacent to 204 
Malé and included adaptation by raising the island to just over 2 m above mean sea-level.63 205 

Technological limits. Island expansion and construction by land claim is a mature and wide spread 206 
technology, common in the Maldives and many other parts of the world. The elevated island 207 
Hulhumalé will be safe from flooding until SLR reaches approximately 0.6 m and thereafter it could 208 
suffer from periodic flooding due to energetic swell waves.64 Island raising, however, can further 209 
continue even under high-end SLR, and further adaptation such as dikes, early-warning systems and 210 
shelters can supplement this. The highly permeable substrate of all Maldives islands should be noted 211 
as a possible challenge. 212 

Economic barriers. Island construction is, for densely populated atoll nations, at relatively low cost, 213 
because the reef-flats that need to be filled with sand are shallow (1-2 m in the case of Hulhumalé), 214 
which minimises sand requirements. The cost of reclaiming Hulhumalé were about US$ 30 per m². 215 
While no detailed benefit-cost analysis is available, adaptation through land reclamation and fill  216 
around Malé is deemed to have a high benefit-cost ratio even when raising islands by 2 m due the high 217 
real-estate prices (about US$ 2,000 per m²). Contrary to this, land raising is not economically 218 
beneficial in areas of low population density, which includes most of the remote islands.   219 

Financing barriers. Island construction was financed by the Government of the Maldives and a 220 
concessional loan form the Saudi Fund for Development.65 Generally, land reclamation is attractive for 221 
investors, because investments can be paid back in the short term through real-estate revenues 222 
generated on the newly created land. In addition, the Maldivian economy has been attractive for 223 
investors, because it has been growing at an average rate of 7.4% over the last 30 years.66 224 

Social conflicts. The main social conflict regarding adaptation is a distributional one between the 225 
urban elites on one hand and the peripheral islands on the other hand.67 The former favour a 226 
centralisation of population and services on a few well-protected islands with the dual goal of reducing 227 
costs of services (National Population Consolidation Policy) and of reducing coastal risk (Safer Island 228 
Strategy). These policies, however, meet the opposition of inhabitants of smaller and more remote 229 
islands as they are perceived to “destroy the country’s 3,000-year-old cultural identity and its social 230 
fabric.”68 231

The Netherlands 238 

While a large part of The Netherlands already lies below sea levels, and complex defences against sea 239 
floods are in place, SLR entails a number of challenges including i) salt intrusion stressing agricultural 240 
production and freshwater provision in the west;69 ii) the Maeslant barrier, protecting Rotterdam city 241 



8 

and harbour, ceasing to be effective under 50 cm SLR; and iii) the IJssel lake system not providing 242 
necessary flood and drought relief with > 30 cm SLR;70,71. Furthermore, coastal flood impacts will be 243 
compounded by increases in Rhine and Meuse river peak discharges.72 These challenges are currently 244 
being addressed in the context of the Delta Programme through a combination of measures including 245 
sand nourishments, dunes, dyke improvements, river widening and urban planning and adaptation. 246 

Technological limits. The dominant impression is that the Netherlands can technically cope with 247 
future SLR of 0.9 m by 2100,71 or 1.5 m/century, although with “major improvements.”70 Research 248 
also showed that with an investment of ~€80bn, it is possible to preserve territorial integrity of the 249 
Netherlands even under 5m SLR, using current engineering technology.73,74 250 

Economic barriers. For the Netherlands as a whole, coastal adaptation to 0.8m SLR was deemed 251 
economically highly beneficial, with an overall benefit-cost ratio of 5 using a discount rate of 4%.75 252 
Adaptation cost are estimated to €1.6 to 3.1 billion per year up to 2050 (about 0.5% of the current 253 
Dutch GDP), while the cost of doing nothing are much higher.76 BCA are not available for higher 254 
SLR, but ballpark estimates suggest that under 5m of SLR, protection cost may exceed the cost of 255 
evacuation.73  256 

Financing barriers. The Delta Programme 2015 has already allocated €1.2 billion per year for 257 
adaptation through the Delta Fund until 2028. State funding is assumed to be continued afterwards, 258 
and it is foreseen that regional (the Water Boards) and local entities (municipalities) will supplement 259 
these resources. Water Boards are autonomous governmental bodies that have their own independent 260 
tax revenue system to maintain water infrastructure. 261 

Social conflicts. The Netherlands has a long history of developing institutional arrangements (i.e., the 262 
Water Boards) for dealing with saline-, fresh water and flooding conflicts and these are likely to be 263 
effective in the future, at least under moderate levels of SLR.77 Current conflicts relate to areas where 264 
dikes have been relocated in order to allow for larger peak flows. For some river widening projects, a 265 
dozen of farms have either been rebuilt on elevated hills or have been relocated, which has triggered 266 
huge debates.78 Under high-end SLR, large investments to protect the west of the country may spark a 267 
debate over the distribution of resources with the population in the safe eastern parts, which already 268 
feels neglected by the population in low lying cities in the west.79 269 

 270 

New York City 271 

Historical flood events have shown that hurricanes and winter storms can have considerable impacts 272 
on New York City (NYC), as illustrated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012 causing more than US$ 20 273 
billion of damage.80 SLR and population growth will further increase the potential consequences of 274 
flooding. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, NYC has been formulating flood adaptation strategies, 275 
which include a wealth of potential measures such as enhancing building codes, building dikes (“the 276 
big U”), installing large scale storm surge barriers, and “green” engineering measures to enhance 277 
resilience of wetlands against storm surges.81  278 

Technological limits. Theoretically, there are no technological limits for this case. The main 279 
technological challenge involved in implementing adaptation measures is that they have to fit into the 280 
existing high-density building stock, which increases costs.82 Furthermore, a change of buildings codes 281 
will effectively only pertain to new buildings.   282 

Economic barriers. The investment costs for different combinations of adaptation measures vary from 283 
US$ 14.7-23.8 billion for strategies containing large scale levees, to US$ 11.6 billion for a “hybrid” 284 
strategy targeted at protecting critical infrastructure and enhancing building codes.83 When only 285 
considering the current climate conditions, benefit-cost ratios for all combinations of measures are 286 
below 1 (discount rate 4%). However, when also considering 21st century SLR of up to 1m, all benefit-287 
cost ratios are above 1, with the highest one being 2.5 for the hybrid strategy. 288 

Financing barriers. After Sandy, the Federal Government made available US$16 billion for disaster 289 
recovery and adaptation through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act (2013), but the allocation of 290 



9 

this money is proceeding slowly. To date, US$ 4 billion have been allocated by NYC, mostly to 291 
recovery.84 About US$ 1 billion has been spent on adaptation projects in NYC and New Jersey under 292 
the Rebuild by Design program.85 The novel aspect of this program is the bottom-up process to 293 
develop projects as joint efforts between the public, research, private sector and government. 294 

Social conflicts. One main distributional conflict in the context of coastal flood risk management in 295 
the US relates to the National Flood Insurance Program subsidising flood insurance for home-owners 296 
in order to stimulate them to enrol into the program. In addition, this creates disincentives for 297 
households to implement disaster risk reduction measures such as flood proofing their homes.86,87 298 
Another issue has been conflicting and fragmented policies issued by Federal, State and City level 299 
authorities regarding building codes. The federal National Flood Insurance Program assigns building 300 
codes to be implemented in 1-in-100 year flood zone, while State and City authorities have added 301 
additional and conflicting requirements as to how much to elevate new buildings (called freeboard).87 302 
State and city-level policies are under revision right now to address this issue. 303 

 304 

Lessons learned across cases 305 

Technological limits. In the cases considered a number of technological challenges such as the lack of 306 
space for building protection infrastructure in densely populated cities are observed, but these do not 307 
constitute technological limits but rather raise costs. While the cases chosen represent a wide variety 308 
of contexts and SLR-related coastal challenges, this does not mean that generally no technological 309 
limits exist. For example, coastal protection is technologically extremely challenging for Miami, 310 
because protected areas can be flooded from below due to the underlying porous limestone. Pumps can 311 
be implemented to deal with the flooding issue, but this reduces groundwater storage and limits the 312 
effects of infiltration pumps to reduce salinity intrusion into the aquifers.88 313 

In principle, technological limits could also arise in the case of adaptation options not offering a low 314 
enough level of residual risk for societies to accept (See Box 1). In our cases and beyond we currently 315 
do not find evidence supporting this point and also expect that this will not be the case under 21st 316 
century SLR. Currently, at least 20 million people accept the risk of living up to several meters below 317 
normal high tides in countries such as Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, the 318 
Netherlands, Poland, Thailand, the UK, and the USA.89 In principle there is no technical obstacle to 319 
engineer coastal protection to very high standards, as for example the discussion on so-called   320 
“unbreakable dikes” illustrates.90 Hence residual risks can be managed, but should never be forgotten 321 
or taken for granted. 322 

In any case, it seems that economic, financing and social conflict barriers are reached before 323 
technological limits arise. The core questions concerning adaptation technology are how much this 324 
will cost, whether societies will be able to access sufficient finance and resolve the distributional 325 
conflicts associated with spending large amounts of public money on coastal protection rather than on 326 
other policy domains. It should also be noted that coastal protection may lead to many unfavourable 327 
side effects such as the loss of tourism due to a decline in beach attractiveness and the loss of coastal 328 
ecosystem through coastal squeeze, which in turn may trigger social conflicts as elaborated further 329 
below. 330 

Economic barriers. Few economic barriers are found in the six cases considered here. On the one 331 
hand this is due to coastal adaptation research generally focusing on the hotspots of coastal social 332 
impacts. In those low-lying areas with high population and asset densities it is generally economically 333 
highly beneficial to protect against even high-end SLR. Hence, it is very unlikely that we will see 334 
mega-cities submerged by SLR during the 21st century. On the other hand, the high benefit-cost ratios 335 
found here, as well as in earlier global analyses,9 illustrate why massive coastal protection is 336 
widespread today and is likely to continue to be so during the 21st century, even if prices for sand and 337 
other materials rise. 338 

Conversely, protecting rural coastal areas and agricultural land will generally have benefit-cost ratios 339 
below one, at least when only considering market values of benefits. When also considering non-340 



10 

market values, hard protection may actually lead to negative benefits, because it constrains coastal 341 
wetlands such as mangroves and marshes to migrate inland with rising sea level.91 A solution may be 342 
offered by so-called nature-based adaptation measures, which provide coastal protection together with 343 
additional ecosystem service benefits, however there are still large uncertainties about the 344 
effectiveness of these solutions.92,93 345 

Financing barriers. Coastal adaptation seems to be frequently constrained by inaccessible finance, 346 
even if benefit-cost ratios are high. One reason for this is that it is difficult to convert the benefits of 347 
coastal adaptation into revenue streams for financing the up-front investment, because benefits, such 348 
as the avoided damage of extreme sea-level events, occur stochastically over a long time horizon, and 349 
are distributed across stakeholders. An interesting exception occurs when adaptation is combined with 350 
the creation of short-term revenue streams via real-estate development on land either newly created or 351 
made more valuable through coastal protection, as illustrated in the case of the Hulhumalé, Maldives; 352 
as well as through urban land-reclamation projects in other parts of the world.94  353 

Social conflicts. Social conflicts are present in all the cases investigated here and very likely also 354 
beyond these. Two types of conflicts were observed. The first one relates to actors that are negatively 355 
affected by adaptation measures. In Catalonia, for example, the tourism sector welcomes beach 356 
nourishment since it directly benefits, while those living from natural resources (e.g. fishermen) show 357 
a growing opposition. This type of conflict can generally be expected in coastal adaptation, because 358 
SLR and coastal adaptation redistribute risks and benefits amongst stakeholders, creating winners 359 
favouring adaptation and losers objecting to it. The second type of conflict relates to the distribution of 360 
public money between coastal actors receiving public support for adaptation and non-coastal actors 361 
paying for this through taxes, as found in the cases of The Netherlands, NYC and Catalonia. 362 

In many parts of the world, coastal adaptation is further complicated by existing conflicts over 363 
resources. For example, illegal coastal sand mining is currently a major driver of coastal erosion in 364 
many parts of the developing world.95 In Ghana, for example, lack of law enforcement, lack of 365 
employment opportunities for the youth, and high demand for sand from the construction industry 366 
continue to make this practice attractive.96 367 

Other social barriers. While the four types of limits and barriers considered here cover main societal 368 
perspectives on coastal adaptation, they are not exhaustive. Even when no conflict of interest is 369 
present, a lack of capacity of governance structures to plan, implement, enforce, monitor and maintain 370 
coastal adaptation measures may constrain adaptation.18,97 In the Ho Chi Minh City case, for example, 371 
the limited experience in dealing with large projects has been reported as a barrier to adaptation.57 A 372 
lack of capacity is particularly problematic when it comes to the maintenance of coastal protection 373 
infrastructure as this has caused many coastal disasters in the past such as in New Orleans,98 just to 374 
mention one prominent example. In other countries in which coastal defence systems have existed 375 
over a long time, effective governance arrangements for maintenance, such as the Water Boards in the 376 
Netherlands, have emerged. Mixed experiences with both bottom-up and top-down governance 377 
structures have been gained in Bangladesh since the introduction of the Dutch-like polders in the 378 
1960s.42 We have left this dimension aside, because it is difficult to make the concept of governance 379 
capacity operational for a high-level comparison of diverse cases as done in this paper.99  380 

Evolution of limits and barriers. Adaptation constraints will evolve over time. Technological change 381 
may help to overcome technological limits and economic barriers (i.e., by reducing adaptation unit 382 
cost). The effect of this is likely to be small for classical “hard” coastal engineering measures as these 383 
are mature technologies, but potentially larger for emerging nature-based solutions. For financing and 384 
social conflict barriers it is more difficult to speculate how these will evolve during the 21st century. 385 
On the one hand, economic growth and better institutions may help to overcome these barriers. On the 386 
other hand, these barriers may aggravate as the overall expenditure for adaptation rises with sea-levels 387 
and this will have to compete for public expenditure with other needs, such as pensions and 388 
unemployment. In any case, financing barriers are likely to persist in the near future, because in the 389 
developed world austerity policy generally reduces public investment levels,100 and in the developing 390 
world, where many countries rely on donor funding, the adaptation finance gap is large.101  391

Outlook and future research 394 

Taken together, our results suggest bifurcating coastal futures during the 21st century. On the one hand, 395 
urban and richer areas will continue to have engineered coasts with higher and higher defences, with 396 
radically altered landscapes, and possible catastrophic consequences in the case of defence failure. On 397 
the other hand, rural and poorer areas will struggle to maintain safe human settlements and will 398 
eventually retreat from the coast. Such retreat is likely to involve massive social conflict, forcing 399 
societies to address difficult questions concerning transfer payments, compensation and liability for 400 
loss and damage.102 Looking beyond 2100, this picture may or may not change. As sea-levels will 401 
continue to rise for millennia, the world is already committed to a long-term SLR in the range of 1.2 to 402 
2.2 m under present levels of global warming, and this commitment could increase to 25-52m within 403 
the next 10,000 years under cumulate emissions of 1280 and 5120 PgC.5 This means that our heirs 404 
could either see a world similar to the one described in this paper or a radically different world with 405 
sea levels tens of meters higher. Irrespective of the deep uncertainties in future sea-levels, strong 406 
mitigation efforts can, and are needed to, reduce the risks of high-end sea-level rise. 407 

In addition to mitigation efforts, research is needed to advance coastal adaptation by finding ways to 408 
overcome prevailing barriers. Towards this end, we advance two avenues of research. One avenue 409 
concerns research and experimentation for overcoming technological challenges and economic 410 
barriers. So-called green or nature-based options92 seem to promise multiple co-benefits, amongst 411 
them the capacity to self-adjust to SLR.103 But research is needed to better understand effectiveness, 412 
optimal timing and benefit-cost ratios together with other socially relevant criteria such as risk 413 
tolerance and social desirability associated with both traditional and novel adaptation options across 414 
the full ranges of SLR and socio-economic uncertainties. 415 

A second, much less developed research avenue concerns understanding and designing governance 416 
arrangements for overcoming financing barriers and social conflicts. This needs to be a priority, as 417 
these are today clearly the most critical barriers to adaptation. Research should thereby target both 418 
international arrangements for enhancing the scale and effectiveness of adaptation finance mechanisms 419 
under the UNFCCC and beyond, as well as project-based financial arrangements for leveraging public 420 
funds, also through the involvement of private investors and project developers.16 Due to the potential 421 
severe distributional consequences of SLR and adaptation, specific attention needs to be placed on 422 
distributional justice, compensation and transfer payments to poorer and rural areas for which the 423 
economics of adaptation is less favourable. 424
