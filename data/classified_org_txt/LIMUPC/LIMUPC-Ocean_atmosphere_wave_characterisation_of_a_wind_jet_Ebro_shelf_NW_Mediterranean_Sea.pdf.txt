Abstract. In this contribution the wind jet dynamics in
the northern margin of the Ebro River shelf (NW Mediter-
ranean Sea) are investigated using coupled numerical mod-
els. The study area is characterised by persistent and en-
ergetic offshore winds during autumn and winter. Dur-
ing these seasons, a seaward wind jet usually develops
in a ∼ 50 km wide band offshore. The COAWST (Cou-
pled Ocean–Atmosphere–Wave–Sediment Transport) mod-
elling system was implemented in the region with a set
of downscaling meshes to obtain high-resolution meteo-
oceanographic outputs. Wind, waves and water currents were
compared with in situ observations and remote-sensing-
derived products with an acceptable level of agreement. Fo-
cused on an intense offshore wind event, the modelled wind
jet appears in a limited area offshore with strong spatial
variability. The wave pattern during the wind jet is charac-
terised by the development of bimodal directional spectra,
and the ocean circulation tends to present well-defined two-
layer flow in the shallower region (i.e. inner shelf). The outer
shelf tends to be dominated by mesoscale dynamics such
as the slope current. Due to the limited fetch length, ocean
surface roughness considering sea state (wave–atmosphere
coupling) modifies to a small extent the wind and significant
wave height under severe cross-shelf wind events. However,
the coupling effect in the wind resource assessment may be
relevant due to the cubic relation between the wind intensity
and power.

1 Introduction

Coastal areas are often characterised by highly variable and
heterogeneous wind, wave and current conditions, which
make the numerical prediction of the meteo-oceanographic
processes difficult. For instance, wind jets induced by oro-
graphic effects present strong spatial wind field variabil-
ity due to the orographic characteristics (e.g. Shimada and
Kawamura, 2006; Zhai and Bower, 2013). Due to the per-
sistence in wind intensity and direction, these regions are
preferential sites for the installation of offshore wind farms
(Nunalee and Basu, 2014). In the case of coastal regions, the
resultant offshore winds decisively influence the exchange of
water mass and material along the shelf/slope (Jordà, 2005;
Barton et al., 2009). Despite the relatively limited fetch in
the wind jet region, the wave height can be relevant, in-
teracting with bimodal features (Shimada and Kawamura,
2006). In this sense, several contributions have highlighted
the influence of variable wind conditions in relatively small-
scale areas (such as wind jet), influencing wind–wave gen-
eration (Shimada and Kawamura, 2006; Bolaños-Sanchez et
al., 2007; Alomar et al., 2014) or modifying ocean circulation
patterns (Csanady, 1980; Zhai and Bower, 2013; Schaeffer et
al., 2011; Klaić et al., 2011).

In coastal zones the air–sea momentum transfer presents a
high complexity due to the dependence of wind intensity on
ocean surface roughness. The relevance of the atmospheric
bottom roughness increasing due to waves has been inves-
tigated in recent years (Janssen, 1989; Janssen and Viterbo,
1996; Lionello et al., 1998; Taylor and Yelland, 2001; Oost
et al., 2002; Drennan et al., 2003). In this sense, advanced
computational tools allowed for the feedback of meteo-

oceanographic momentum and heat transfer to be addressed
numerically (Warner et al., 2010; Zambon et al., 2014).
Warner et al. (2010) developed a fully coupled numeri-
cal system (COAWST: Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere–Wave–
Sediment Transport) to investigate the impact of storms on
coastal systems. Using COAWST, Olabarrieta et al. (2012)
and Renault et al. (2012) proved numerically that the wave-
induced ocean surface roughness is a key parameter in the
air–sea momentum transfer. Under severe storm conditions
(hurricanes and cyclones), this parameter influences the spa-
tial and temporal evolution of the meteo-oceanographic vari-
ables. Other recent examples that use a fully numerical model
to investigate the air–sea interaction and its effect on oceano-
graphic processes are found in Nelson and He (2012) and
Drews (2013).

The case of the Ebro River shelf (NW Mediterranean Sea;
see Fig. 1) is characterised by a strong, dry and usually cold
wind that blows from the north-west through the Ebro val-
ley. The westerly wind, greatly affected by the orography, is
channelised into a limited band, forming a wind jet (Jansà,
1985; Spanish Ministry of Energy, 2014). The synoptic sit-
uation is related to an anticyclone in the Bay of Biscay and
a low-pressure area in the Mediterranean Sea (Riosalido et

al., 1986; Font, 1990; Martín-Vide, and Olcina, 2001; Cer-
ralbo et al., 2015). Offshore wind is more usual and intense
during autumn and winter, when larger atmospheric pressure
gradients take place and cause stronger winds with an advec-
tion of cold air, but a small atmospheric pressure difference
along the Ebro valley is sufficient to initiate wind during any
season (Riosalido et al., 1986; Cerralbo et al., 2015).

The objective of this contribution is to describe the meteo-
oceanographic processes associated with a wind jet devel-
oping at the northern margin of the Ebro River shelf. This
work provides insight into wind jets in an orographically
complex region, such as the Ebro delta shelf, describing the
main wind, wave and current patterns and the feedback rel-
ative to the air–sea momentum transfer in terms of wave-
induced ocean surface roughness. After the introduction
(Sect. 1), in Sect. 2 (Methods) we describe the study area,
the COAWST model implementation and the wind jet event
selected to investigate in detail the meteo-oceanographic dy-
namics. Then, in Results (Sect. 3) we show the most rele-
vant meteo-oceanographic processes observed and a detailed
skill assessment of the fields modelled, comparing them with
a set of available data (i.e. in situ observations and remote-
sensing products). Also, the feedback in the air–sea momen-

tum transfer in terms of wave-induced ocean surface rough-
ness is investigated with a set of coupled simulations test-
ing different air–sea momentum transfer formulations. Af-
terwards, we discuss (Sect. 4) the relevance and particulari-
ties of the dynamics of the wind jet area in terms of waves,
winds and currents, comparing with previous investigations.
The implications of the wind–wave coupling in terms of the
wind resource assessment are highlighted. We close with the
Conclusions (Sect. 5).

2 Methods

2.1 Study area and observations

The meteorological patterns over the NW Mediterranean Sea
exhibit sharp gradients associated with the topographic con-
trol on synoptic fluxes (Jansà, 1985; Martín-Vide and Olcina,
2001). Regional wind analysis reveals strong and persistent
cross-shelf winds. A channelisation effect associated with
the Ebro valley triggers north-westerly winds (called Mes-
tral: Catalan for Mistral wind), resulting in a wind jet. Pre-
vious studies based on long-term wind measurements in the
proximity of the region showed that winds have a persistent
seasonal pattern (Font, 1990; Cerralbo et al., 2015; Grifoll
et al., 2015). During winter and autumn, a dominant north-
westerly component caused by wind channelisation was ob-
served. For instance, recent wind measurements revealed that
cross-shelf winds were observed more than 60 % of the time
during these seasons (Grifoll et al., 2015). In this period, the
energy is concentrated in the low frequencies associated with
synoptic scales (periods of 2–5 days, corresponding with the
passage of weather systems). However, the warmer period
(spring and summer) is characterised by high variability with
a dominance of south-westerly winds. This means that during
spring and summer the relative contribution of the daily com-
ponents (breezes) to the variability increases with respect to
the synoptic winds (Font, 1990; Cerralbo et al., 2015). The
warmer seasons are less energetic than the cold seasons in
terms of wind intensity.

The Ebro River delta is located immediately to the south
of the wind jet region, and the average annual river discharge
ranges between 300 and 600 m3 s−1. The curvature of the bay
partially shelters it from southerly waves. Regional wave cli-
mate in this area is characterised by the south-eastern and
eastern sectors, the latter being the most energetic due to hav-
ing the largest fetches (Bolaños-Sanchez et al., 2007).

Oceanographic investigations in the Ebro River region
were focused primarily on the outer shelf and slope dynamics
of the southern margin (Font, 1990; Palanques et al., 2002;
Salat et al., 2002; Jordà, 2005) with relevant eddy activity
(Redondo et al., 2013). The circulation in these regions is
dominated by the inertial band, with a relevant signal of the
slope current associated with the regional northern current
northern or Liguro–Provençal–Catalan current (Jordà, 2005).

Observational analyses have revealed that the inner and mid-
shelf (less than 50 m water depth) dynamics in the Ebro shelf
are characterised by a strong influence of the frictional com-
ponent of the flow (Jordà, 2005; Grifoll et al., 2015). Further-
more, the regional response to wind jets is not clear due to the
complex bathymetry and the spatial variability of the wind
jet. Durand et al. (2002) and Mestres et al. (2003) showed
that the effects of the salinity river plume are important only
near the river mouth (of the order of 10 km offshore from the
river mouth).

As a part of large effort to collect physical data and im-
plement numerical tools for the assessment of offshore wind
energy potential, a buoy was moored in the northern margin
of the Ebro shelf where the wind jet develops (see Fig. 1).
The buoy was moored 3.1 km from the coast at 43.5 m bot-
tom depth, measuring wind, waves and water currents for
1 year. A TRIAXYS directional wave sensor mounted on
the moored buoy was used to record statistical wave spec-
tra parameters. Wind speed and direction were measured
at 4 m height every 10 min using an ultrasonic wind sensor
(Gill Instruments) for 1 year (November 2011 to Novem-
ber 2012). Water currents were measured with a SonTek
acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) at 500 kHz every
hour using 20 vertical layers (layer depth was 2 m). The
mooring period covered more than 1 year (from Novem-
ber 2011 to December 2012).

Additionally, satellite-measured winds were used for the
numerical model validation. Sea wind intensity and di-
rection were obtained from the National Climatic Data
Center (NCDC-NOAA; http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/rsad/
air-sea/seawinds.html). This product is the result of a spa-
tial and temporal interpolation of the data received from the
different satellites passing through the study area during a
time interval, and it has 6 h time resolution and 0.25◦ spatial
resolution.

2.2 Numerical model and meshes

The COAWST modelling system (Warner et al., 2010) was
used in this study. COAWST relies on the three-dimensional
(3-D) ocean modelling ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling
System; see Haidvogel et al., 2000), the phase-averaged
wave model SWAN (Simulating WAaves Nearshore; see
Booij et al., 1999), the non-hydrostatic meteorological
model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting; Ska-
marock et al., 2005) and the sediment transport module
CSTMS (Community Sediment Transport Modeling System;
Warner et al., 2008). The ocean model ROMS is a free-
surface, terrain-following numerical model, which resolves
the 3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equa-
tions using hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations. The
WRF model (advanced research WRF version) is a non-
hydrostatic, quasi-compressible atmospheric model with a
variety of physical parameterisations of sub-grid-scale pro-
cesses for predicting meso- and microscales of motion. The

SWAN model solves the wave action balance equation sim-
ulating wind generation and propagation in deep and coastal
waters. The modelling system COAWST includes the cou-
pler Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT; Jacob et al., 2005) for
the transmission and transformation of the physical variables
using a parallel computing approach. The COAWST sys-
tem also allows for the exchange of data fields on different
grids using the Spherical Remapping Interpolation Package
(SCRIP; Jones, 1999) to compute the interpolation weights.

The largest wave domain (mesh O1) covers the west-
ern Mediterranean Sea, which is considered large enough to
capture the wave generation in the study area. The SWAN
model implementation used amends the underestimation in
the wave growth rates reported by Alomar et al. (2014) and
Rogers et al. (2003) in a low- and medium-frequency energy
spectrum. The measure adopted was introduced by Pallares
et al. (2014) and consists in modifying the whitecapping dis-
sipation term (see Appendix A1).

The largest water circulation domain (mesh O3) is nested
into the daily MyOcean-MEDSEA product (Tonani et al.,
2009), with a horizontal resolution of 1/16◦× 1/16◦ and
72 unevenly spaced vertical levels, in order to provide suit-
able boundary conditions for the oceanographic variables in
terms of water velocity, sea level, temperature and salinity.
The 3-D ocean model implementation (ROMS) includes a
generic length-scale turbulent-mixing scheme (Umlauf and
Burchard, 2003), with coefficients selected to parameterise
the k-epsilon scheme (Rodi, 1987) and fourth-order bihar-
monic Laplacian viscosity and mixing terms on geopotential
surfaces for velocity and tracers, respectively, both with con-
stant coefficients of 0.5 m4 s−2. The bottom boundary layer
was parameterised using a log profile with bottom roughness
equal to 0.005 m. The time interval for data exchange be-
tween the models is 600 s.

The atmospheric model is nested into the ECMWF (Eu-
ropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA-
Interim reanalysis product considering four downscaling
meshes – M1, M2, M3 and M4 with resolutions of 27, 9,
3 and 1 km, respectively – to obtain suitable grid resolution
for the complex orography of the region (see Fig. 1). The
WRF implementation uses a Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–
Niino (MYNN) level 2.5 planetary boundary layer scheme.
The nesting strategy consists of a set of different downscal-
ing meshes (Fig. 1c and Table 1). The ocean–atmospheric–
wave online coupling was implemented in the finer domain
(mesh O4 for the wave and circulation model, and mesh M4
for the meteorological model) where the scale of the coupling
process due to cross-shelf winds may be more evident in
the results. In this case, air–sea coupled effects are included
considering the Taylor and Yelland formulation (Taylor and
Yelland, 2001), for the ocean surface roughness modification
due to the wave effect, and vortex force for the wave effects
on currents (Olabarrieta et al., 2012).

2.3 Episode description and numerical sensitivity test

As we noted in the introduction, the air–sea momentum
transfer presents high complexity due to the relation of wave
characteristics and the ocean surface roughness, which in
turn affect the wind field. In order to investigate the air–sea
momentum transfer in the wind jet, a set of simulations have
been designed applying different air–sea momentum trans-
fer formulations included in the COAWST modelling system.
The sensitivity tests pursue an evaluation of the “coupling”
effects on two principal variables involved in the air–sea mo-
mentum transfer: wind intensity (W ) and significant wave
height (Hs). In this sense three different formulations have
been tested (see Appendix A2), which consider the modifica-
tion of the atmospheric bottom roughness due to the waves.
In consequence, we compare directly the “coupled” results
with an “uncoupled” simulation where the bottom roughness
length is only a function of the wind stress. The sensitivity
tests are as follows: CHK for the simulation considering the
bottom roughness as a function of the wind stress (uncoupled
with the wave sea state) using the Charnock coefficient equal
to 0.016, T–Y simulation considering the Taylor and Yel-
land formulation (Taylor and Yelland, 2001), DRE using the
Drennan formulation proposed by Drennan et al. (2003) and
OOST simulation considering the formulation introduced by
Oost et al. (2002). Two numerical points are chosen to com-
pare the results for the sensitivity test simulations. One point
is near the buoy’s moored position (where the numerical re-
sults are also compared with the measurements). The second
point is located 30 km offshore of the measurement point (see
control point in Fig. 1). This point has been chosen in order
to capture the wave growth due to cross-shelf winds and eval-
uate properly the coupling–uncoupling differences.

We select a cross-shelf wind event in order to characterise
in detail the meteo-oceanographic dynamics of the wind jet.
The episode selected for the sensitivity tests lasted from 19 to
23 March 2012. The synoptic situation during the selected
episode corresponds to a typical offshore wind event in-
duced by atmospheric pressure differences (see Fig. 2). A
high-atmospheric-pressure area is centred over the North At-
lantic Ocean, with the anticyclonic edge affecting part of the
Iberian Peninsula. The low pressure is located in the cen-

tre of Europe. In this situation the cross-shore winds in the
Ebro delta zone are intensified. The sequence of wind field
modelled in the Catalan coast mesh during the wind jet pe-
riod is characterised by a rise of wind intensity during the
20 and 21 May, leading to a wind jet in the northern mar-
gin of the Ebro delta (see daily-averaged wind intensity in
Fig. 3). Then, the cross-shore winds remain strong during
22 May, decreasing during the 23 May 2012.

3 Results

3.1 Description of meteo-oceanographic processes and
skill assessment

The skill assessment of the model is carried out for dif-
ferent meshes in function with the spatial coverage of the
observations. Modelled winds during the simulation period
reproduce the main wind directions previously reported in
the study area. Offshore wind prevails throughout the year,
intercalated with southerly winds during spring and sum-
mer (i.e. sea breeze). The adjustment of the wind time se-
ries into a Weibull distribution is used to evaluate the sta-
tistical inter-comparison between wind observations (mea-
sured from the buoy and satellite) and the 3 km WRF model
results (mesh M3). Blended Sea Winds were used from
the NOAA/NCDC SeaWinds project which contain 6-hourly
globally gridded, high-resolution ocean surface vector winds
and wind stresses on a global 0.25◦ grid. Figure 4 shows the
Weibull distributions considering the wind intensity time se-
ries. Also the global model (i.e. ECMWF) used for WRF
model downscaling is included. The results show that for
high and medium range wind speeds (> 2.5 m s−1), the nu-

merical simulation presents better agreement with the wind
measurements than the global model and the gridded satellite
wind estimations. Although the global wind model assimi-
lates the satellite information, the Weibull distribution of the
high-resolution model presents a better level of agreement
with the observations. A snapshot of the SeaWinds product
was compared with the numerical outputs in Fig. 5. Wind pat-
terns from both products present a significant level of agree-
ment in both components, assuming the coarser resolution of
the SeaWinds. Additional verification is presented in Table 2
using model–observation statistics in terms of wind intensity
for the whole year of 2012. The correlation coefficient (R)
is almost 0.8 and the root mean square error (RMSE) and
the bias are smaller than the mean and the standard deviation
obtained from the observations. In summary, modelled winds
show an acceptable level of agreement with the observations.

In Fig. 6, time series comparing the results obtained from
the coupled SWAN model (mesh O3) and the buoy measure-
ments (see position in Fig. 1) are shown. The time series
comparison corresponds to the significant wave height (Hs),
the mean wave period (Tm01) and the mean wave direc-
tion (θw). Table 2 presents the error statistics for the whole
year for mesh O3 in terms of Hs and Tm01. In general,
the model reproduces the observed values in terms of mean
behaviour and variability. Error statistics are similar with
previous numerical investigations in the region; Pallares et
al. (2014) obtained values of R range from 0.68 to 0.91 for
Hs.

Figure 7 (right panel) shows a snapshot of the waves’ di-
rectional spectra during the wind jet period selected at the
measuring point; the results reveal the tendency to develop
bimodal directional spectra due to the co-existence of sea
and swell waves. Directional spectra presents a peak around
315◦ mean wave direction associated with the growing wave
due to the wind jet and another peak around 135◦ associ-
ated with the swell. Despite the limited fetch, larger wave
frequencies (smaller wave period) are obtained for the 315◦

wave direction peak than for the 135◦ wave direction peak.

out a wind jet are also shown for comparison. In this case,
unimodal wave spectra are obtained. In summary, the high-
resolution mesh (O4) is able to capture the bimodal spectra
during a wind jet. Unfortunately, only the statistical spectra
parameters were recorded in the buoy measurements, and full
spectra comparison is not possible.

The water circulation observed at the buoy is charac-
terised by an alignment of the flow following the isobaths.
The principal component analysis of the flow for the ob-
served depth-averaged currents reveals an angle similar to
the coastline orientation (∼ 26◦). As the cross-shelf flow is
limited by the coastline, the variability in this direction is
smaller than in the along-shelf direction: standard deviation
is 2.3 cm s−1 in the cross-shelf direction vs. 7.4 cm s−1 in
along-shelf direction. However, the water circulation dur-
ing the wind jet events shows a different pattern. Dur-
ing these events, the cross-shelf flow variability increases
(3.8 cm s−1 for the wind jet event selected), with either two-
layer flow or an offshore flow in the whole water column.
As an example of water current response during wind jet
event, the along-shelf and cross-shelf velocities are shown
in Fig. 8 for May 2012 at the observational point (nega-
tive values mean south-westward/onshore and positive north-
eastward/offshore). The surface currents in the cross-shelf
direction intensify, causing an eventual two-layer flow dur-
ing the peak of the wind intensity (21 May). When the
wind jet calms down, the cross-shelf velocities are small
while the along-shelf flow intensity is larger than that of the
cross-shelf. The along-shelf current observed during wind
jet events tends to reverse from south-westward to north-
eastward.

The skill assessment of the numerical results in terms of
current (water velocity) was carried out following a similar
scheme to the one used for winds and waves. The numerical
model validation with ADCP observations shows an accept-

able level of agreement according to the comparison for the
wind jet event. For instance, Fig. 8 shows a noticeable agree-
ment between the observed and modelled currents in the wa-
ter column for both along- and cross-shelf components. In

addition, Table 2 presents the error statistics for the depth-

ical model results for the wind jet event. Skill assessment
is better in depth-averaged along-shelf flow in comparison
to cross-shelf (e.g. R equal 0.82 to vs. 0.24) due to the fre-
quent two-layer flow structure observed in cross-shelf mea-
surements during wind-jet events giving rise to a weak depth-
averaged cross-shelf velocity.

event (21 May) is shown in Fig. 9 for two different depths:
sub-surface (2m water depth) and intermediate (50 m wa-
ter depth) for O3 mesh. Depth-averaged velocities are also

presented in Fig. 9. The surface current modelled at 1 km
(mesh O3) and 250 m (mesh O4) grid resolution presents a
relatively homogeneous offshore direction qualitatively that
is well correlated with the spatial distribution of the wind in-
tensity. In this case, the surface current is seldom affected
by topographic features such as the Ebro delta. Consistent
with Fig. 8, at deeper layers the flow direction turns onshore,
resulting in a two-layer flow in which the current intensity is
lower than that of the surface layer (Fig. 9, centre panel). The
depth-averaged flow is small due to the balance between the
sheared two-layer flow; however, a flow component slightly
appears that is aligned with the isobaths in the deeper areas

averaged currents.

3.2 Ocean surface roughness numerical experiments

The wind intensity and the significant wave height during the
selected wind jet event for the four simulations are shown in
Fig. 10 (for the control and observational points shown in
Fig. 1). Comparing the numerical results and the observa-
tions (Fig. 10, upper panels), all the numerical simulations
reproduce the wind intensity and the significant wave height
with a similar level of agreement. The uncoupled (CHK) and
coupled simulations (e.g. T–Y, OOST and DRE) only present
differences in the numerical outputs during the joint occur-
rence of strong winds and wave peaks in the control point.
Waves and wind intensity numerical results at the observa-
tional point do not present significant changes among the
four simulations due to the limited fetch conditions, which
means lower significant wave height in comparison to the
control point. During the calm period (at beginning and end
of the wind jet event) the differences among the four simu-
lations are inappreciable. Numerical coupled results do not
present better agreement at the observational point than the
uncoupled mode results. Comparing the error statistics for
the observational point among the three coupled numerical
simulations, we cannot assure which formulation ensures a
better skill assessment (Table 3). At the control point the
magnitude of the wind intensity and the significant wave
height is larger for the uncoupled simulation (CHK) in com-
parison to the coupled simulations (Fig. 10, bottom pan-
els). Maximum differences of 3 m s−1 in wind intensity and
0.3 m in significant wave height are obtained if we compare
OOST and CHK simulations. In consequence, small differ-
ences are found between coupled and uncoupled simulations
when wave conditions increases.

4 Discussion

The shape of the wind jet modelled is benefited by the high-
resolution meshes used in our investigation. According to
our results, the wind jet approximately covers an area of
50 km width offshore. This area is in agreement with the
wind intensity atlas provided by the Spanish Ministry of En-
ergy (see Fig. 11) obtained from a long-term reanalysis prod-
uct (15 years using the MASS model). In this sense, high-
resolution meshes used in this investigations (i.e. 1 and 3 km
grid resolution) are suitable for an accurate wind jet mod-
elling. As it was pointed out by Alomar et al. (2014) and
Cerralbo et al. (2015), the relevance of winds in the ocean
response in terms of waves and currents justifies the high-
resolution in the modelling investigations in the Ebro delta
region.

Our results have shown an acceptable representation of the
bimodal structure of the significant wave height and support
the conclusions highlighted by Alomar et al. (2014), who
note that a high spatial resolution of the wind field is re-
quired to represent an acceptable numerical wave field in
very limited fetch conditions. The occurrence of bimodal
wave features may also have different implications: the first
one is that, because of the spatial resolution, the local north-
westerly wind that produced the second peak of spectra may
not have been detected in previous investigations (Sánchez-
Arcilla et al., 2008; Alomar et al., 2014). The second impli-
cation is related to the momentum transfer: several authors
have highlighted that under mixed wave-train conditions the
ocean surface roughness may increase appreciably (Sánchez-
Arcilla et al., 2008). Also, the wave modelling deserves to be
mentioned particularly with regard to the good fit of wave
results in comparison to previous investigations (Bolaños-
Sanchez et al., 2007; Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2008). Statis-
tical errors were reduced significantly due to the young sea
developed in the wind jet region likely thanks to the mod-
ification of a parameter relative to whitecapping dissipation
(Pallares et al., 2014). In particular, smaller root mean square
errors were obtained in the mean wave period variable, which
presented large uncertainty (Bolaños-Sanchez et al., 2007;
Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2008; Alomar et al., 2014).

As we noted in the Results section, the water circulation
pattern showed differential behaviour for the long-term wa-
ter circulation in comparison to the wind jet event. For the
long-term circulation and in the shallow region, the frictional
response prevails, with the along-shelf flow variability being
larger than the cross-shelf flow, similar to other investiga-
tions in the inner and mid-shelf (see review in Lentz and
Fewings, 2012; Grifoll et al., 2013). However, a different
picture occurs during the wind jet event. In this case a char-
acteristic surface current is high correlated to the offshore
wind. According to the numerical outputs and in situ obser-
vations shown in Fig. 8, a deeper onshore flow, opposing the
surface layer flow offshore, is developed. This flow is rel-
atively weak due to the prevalence of the along-shelf com-

ponent that increases offshore. These circulation patterns are
consistent with other investigations (e.g. Horwitz and Lentz,
2014; Fewings et al., 2008; Dzwonkowski et al., 2011) where
a well-developed two-layer flow due to intense cross-shelf
winds tends to occur when the turbulent layers overlap (water
depth in the inner shelf is of the order of metres to tens of me-
tres according to Lentz and Fewings, 2012). In the mid- and
outer shelf, the flow tends to be oriented in the along-shelf di-
rection due to the prevalence of the regional response to the
wind jet and the slope current. In this sense, the frictional ad-
justment time due to the wind (inversely proportional to the
depth) varies in the continental shelf section and may be of
the order of days in the mid-/outer shelf (Csanady, 1982).
As a consequence, the expected response at deeper layers
will also be dependent on processes acting at larger scales

than the wind jet (i.e. baroclinic forcing, mesoscale activ-
ity) such as the slope current signal observed at 50 m water
depth and depth-averaged currents in the numerical results
(Fig. 9). The along-shelf flow in the inner shelf is presum-
ably influenced by the regional response to the wind jet at the
stratification in the water column and the barotropic pressure
gradient adjustment due the spatial wind variability. These
factors play an important role in the resultant water circula-
tion pattern and its variability deserves additional numerical
efforts and extended local wind and sea level information.
For instance, Oey et al. (2004) and Liu and Weisberg (2012)
include extended measurements to investigate the water cir-
culation’s response to spatial wind and the particular role of
the barotropic pressure gradients. Finally, it is worth noting
that the interaction between offshore winds and regional cir-

culation was filtered in previous investigations in the region
(Font, 1990; Salat et al., 2002; Jordà, 2005).

Several investigations have found the importance of the
sea state in the impact on the air–sea momentum flux; in
particular the calculations based on the Charnock constant
underestimated the air–sea momentum transfer (e.g. Janssen
and Viterbo, 1996; Drennan et al., 2003), which can be sig-
nificant under mixed seas (Sanchez-Arcilla et al., 2008). In
the northern margin of the Ebro delta and during the wind jet,
no relevant differences were found when comparing the sig-
nificant wave period and the wind intensity between the nu-
merical model and observations for the observational point.
During calm periods, the averaged conditions prevail over
energetic events, so the feedback of the air–sea momentum
does not show significant differences. The detailed analy-
sis of 21–22 May event showed significant differences be-
tween the coupled and uncoupled cases for significant wave
height and wind intensity offshore of the wind jet (e.g. con-
trol “offshore” point). When we compare the coupling nu-
merical results (i.e. T–Y, OOST and DRE) versus CHK re-
sults, we observe that the wind intensity at the control point
is affected significantly by the sea state during the ener-
getic event. For the coupling simulations the wind intensity
is reduced due to the increasing wave-induced ocean surface
roughness. This behaviour is consistent with other coupling
atmosphere–ocean investigations under a high level of me-
teorological energy (e.g. Olabarrieta et al., 2012). In paral-
lel, the wave field is modified by the feedback between wave
and wind stress. During the energetic wind event selected,
Hs is lower in comparison to the uncoupled case (CHK),
consistent with other numerical experiments (Webber et al.,
1993; Warner et al., 2010; Olabarrieta et al., 2012) and ob-
servational investigations (Yelland et al., 1998; Edson, 2008),
which found that the momentum flux is underestimated using
the Charnock constant parameter. Unfortunately, the lack of
measurements offshore of the observational point (i.e. larger

fetch in comparison to observational point) has not allowed
one to investigate if the coupling simulations present better
skill assessment than the uncoupled case.

Differences in the primitive variables between the coupled
and uncoupled simulations during particular energetic events
are relatively small in terms of wind intensity and significant
wave height. Furthermore, the assessment of the wind energy
resource is relevant in this region with a high potential for
wind farm installation due to the large and persistent wind
intensity and the relatively large spatial extension of the con-
tinental shelf. A simple way to estimate turbine power from
wind intensity is based on the idealised machine of blade di-
ameter (D) being equal to 100 m (Manwell et al., 2002):

P = ρ(2/3D)2W 3. (1)

Wind intensity (W ) simulations are taken at 10 m height, so
a log-law-based conversion is used to obtain wind values at
80 m (typical value of turbine hubs). With the converted val-
ues of the numerical simulations, we estimate the idealised
wind power for the period 21–22 May 2012 at the control
point. The power using the CHK wind value is 8.087 kW (av-
erage wind speed of 11.41 m s−1); in contrast, using OOST
formulations leads to a power of 7.207 kW (average wind
speed of 10.98 m s−1). Intermediate values are obtained for
T–Y and DREN formulations: 7.365 and 7.346 kW, respec-
tively. The cubic relationship between wind power and wind
velocity highlights the importance of accurate estimations
of wind intensity for wind energy resources using coupling
techniques (a maximum percentage of 10 % is assessed).
This example shows the relevance of coupled effects for an
accurate wind power assessment for wind farm project plans.

The wave-limited fetches and the persistent offshore winds
represent particular ocean–atmosphere conditions never in-
vestigated before from a full-coupling perspective; only ener-
getic cyclogenesis activity and extreme conditions have been
recently modelled and investigated (e.g. Warner et al., 2010;
Olabarrieta et al., 2012; Renault et al., 2012; Zambon et al.,
2014; Ricchi et al., 2016) where also the heat transfer plays a
relevant role in the air–sea coupling. In the mentioned cases,
extreme modelled waves and wind benefitted from the use
of full-coupling systems. Our case only presents compara-
ble energetic conditions during a very short period of time;
however, the cubic relationship between the potential wind
energy and the wind intensity may justify, for engineering
purposes, the use of coupled formulations between wind and
waves. Further observational campaigns and the future use of
high-resolution remote-sensing products (e.g. Sentinel-1 and
Sentinel-3; Torres et al., 2012; Malenovsky et al., 2012) will
benefit the numerical results and extended physical investi-
gations in such a complex process as wind jet, in particular
the role of the air–sea transfer formulations. Our results are
also relevant in that they may be useful for further physical
investigations in similar domains where the wind jets control
the ocean–atmosphere dynamics (Jiang et al., 2009; Barton
et al., 2009; Shimada and Kawamura, 2006).

5 Conclusions

Wind jet events, investigated using numerical modelling
and both in situ and remote-sensing data, present partic-
ular conditions in meteo-oceanographic variables in the
northern margin of the Ebro delta. A fully coupled meteo-
oceanographic numerical model was implemented, with a
good level of agreement in terms of waves, currents and
wind fields measured. The numerical results reveal a spatially
varying wind pattern, forming a well-limited wind jet. The
water current velocity pattern during wind jet is well cor-
related with the wind intensities in the surface layer. How-
ever, in deep layers the flow becomes complex, and other
processes of larger temporal and spatial characteristic scales
affect the water circulation. The wave modelling during the
wind jet event is characterised by the development of bi-
modal wave spectra: local wave generation due to wind jet
and waves propagated from the open sea. Numerical results
from sensitivity tests have shown the relatively small rele-
vance of air–sea transfer formulations considering the sig-
nificant wave height for the ocean surface roughness estima-
tion. Furthermore, the accurate estimation of the wind en-
ergy resource may be benefitted by the coupled numerical
modelling. The characteristics of the meteo-ocean variables
during the wind jet in the northern Ebro delta may be useful
for understanding processes in similar domains under severe
cross-shelf wind conditions.

Appendix A: Modification of the whitecapping term in
SWAN

Pallares et al. (2014) performed numerical experiments that
aimed to improve the numerical wave predictions in semi-
enclosed bays, modifying the dissipation terms in the wave
energy balance equation. For this purpose two whitecapping
formulations are considered in SWAN, obtained from the
pulse-based model of Hasselmann (1974) reformulated in
terms of wave number (the WAMDI group, 1988):

Sds,w(σ,θ)=−0σ̃
k

k̃
E(σθ), (A1)

where σ̃ and k̃ denote the mean frequency and the mean wave
number, respectively, and the coefficient 0 depends on the
wave steepness (Janssen, 1991):

0 = Cds

(
(1− δ)+ δ

k

k̃

)(
s̃

s̃PM

)p
. (A2)

The coefficients Cds, δ and p can be adapted to the study
case; s̃ is the overall wave steepness; and s̃PM is the value
of s̃ for the Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum.

In SWAN the previously mentioned coefficients are ob-
tained by adjusting the energy balance for idealised wave
growth conditions (fully developed wind seas in deep wa-
ter), despite the wave growth in semi-enclosed domains with
highly variable wind fields differing considerably from those
idealised conditions. As a result of a calibration process in
the NW Mediterranean Sea, which led to a reduction of
the wave forecast errors mainly present in the wave period,
the coefficients selected for the wind jet region were δ= 1,
Cds= 2.36× 10−5 and p= 4, achieving a notable fit between
numerical outputs and wave observations.

Appendix B: Air–sea momentum transfer formulations
(bottom roughness length)

The standard bottom roughness length scale is expressed as
a function of the Charnock coefficient (Ca; typical value
of 0.016) and surface wind stress (us):

z0 = Ca · u
2
s/g, (B1)

where g is the gravity. Coupling online simulations in
COAWST allows for three different formulations to be cho-
sen to parameterise the bottom roughness considering the
wave effects. The formulation of Taylor and Yelland (2001)
considers the wave effects:

z0/Hs = 1200 ·
(
Hs/Lp

)4.5
, (B2)

where Hs is the significant wave height and Lp is the
wavelength at the peak of the wave spectrum. Drennan et
al. (2003) proposed a formulation to estimate z0 as a function
of the phase-wave speed (Cp) and wind friction velocity (u∗):

z0/Hs = 3.35 ·
(
u
∗
/Cp

)3.4
. (B3)

Similar to Drennan’s formulation, Oost et al. (2002) pro-
posed the following formulation based on an experimental
data set:

z0/Lp = 25.0/π ·
(
u
∗
/Cp

)4.5
. (B4)

Conceptual differences arise from these formulations: Taylor
and Yelland (2001) considers the wave steepness, Drennan
et al. (2003) is based on the wave age and Oost et al. (2002)
considers effects of both wave steepness and wave age.
