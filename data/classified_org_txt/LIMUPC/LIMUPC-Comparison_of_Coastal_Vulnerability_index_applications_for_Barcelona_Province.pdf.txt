The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is one of the simplest and commonly used methods to assess coastal
vulnerability to sea-level rise (SLR) driven erosion and/or inundation. In this way, it is a common tool con-
tributing to the decision-making process in long-term coastal planning and management. However, there is not a
unique approach to be adopted, and existing ones can supply different information and, thus, promote different
decisions. Within this context, the main goal of this paper is to compare and evaluate different methodologies to
determine CVI, and to suggest the most appropriate approach that can be generically applied for coastal vul-
nerability assessment. For doing this, the approaches proposed by Gornitz (1991), Shaw et al. (1998), Thieler
and Hammar-Klose (2000), and Lopez et al. (2016) are applied along the 160 km long the Barcelona coastline in
the Spanish Mediterranean.

Shaw et al.‘s (1998) method appears to be the more realistic approach to assess vulnerability of the Barcelona
coast while the overall vulnerability level calculated by the equation proposed by Gornitz (1991) indicate a wide
variability, from highly vulnerable to a very low level of vulnerability. This study shows that the ranking tables
generated from site-specific databases may not be applicable elsewhere, and indicates that it might be prudent to
develop site or region-specific ranking categories to compute the overall CVI in order to provide reliable inputs
to local coastal zone management initiatives. Despite the potential bias in the categorization of the overall CVI
classes and their expert opinion/judgment approval requirements, CVI tools help decision makers to take the
necessary actions to increase the resilience of coastal zones to SLR.

1. Introduction

A significant and growing number of residents in the European
Union (EU) live in coastal regions. Nearly 19 percent of the population
(around 86 million people) are living within 10 km of the coastal strip
(EEA, 2006), and close to 50 percent of the population (around 200
million people) (ESTAT, 2009) are living within 50 km of a European
coastline. Due to the anthropogenic effects, the sea level rose by 0.06m
during the nineteenth century and 0.19m in the twentieth century
(Svetlana et al., 2008). Approximately 140.000 km2 of EU land is 1m
above sea level, and in some countries, low-lying coastal areas are
densely inhabited (e.g., Denmark, England, Germany, Italy, and the
Netherlands) (EEA, 2010), making coastal ecosystems and people who
benefit from coastal services vulnerable to potential sea-level rise (SLR).

Climate models typically focus on the projections of global SLR by

2100, based on varying assumptions, and attempt to explain the in-
crease in greenhouse gas emissions and melting ice sheets in Greenland
and the West Arctic, as well as the sea level's response to increasing
global surface air and ocean water temperature.

Climate projections, similar to those of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change IPCC, (2001),IPCC et al., 2007, 2014) are increas-
ingly used in decision-making. The most recent projections presented
by the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), consider a scenario of very high
emissions and predict a global SLR of 0.52–0.98m by the end of this
century. Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios are
based on a greenhouse gas concentration trajectory adopted by the
IPCC in the AR5. In spite of this, there are other studies predicting
larger SLR as Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009) who used a semi-empirical
method linking temperature changes to SLR, and the resulting projected
global SLR of 0.75–1.9m which is significantly higher than the IPCC

AR5 projections.
While these projections estimate the likely SLR rates for different

climate scenarios, severe impacts on coastal regions, rivers systems, and
urban infrastructures has already been observed. The permanent in-
undation of coastal areas results with shoreline erosion, declining water
quality, decreasing fish cultivation, seawater intrusion to freshwater
resources, the inundation of wetlands and estuaries, and a declining
water quality, are listed as the drastic consequences of SLR due to cli-
mate change.

SLR will lead to coastal recession (Bruun, 1962; Ranasinghe et al.,
2012; Ranasinghe and Stive, 2009), coastal flooding (e.g. Aucelli et al.,
2018; Woodruff et al., 2013; Nicholls et al., 2008), subsidence (e.g.
Aucelli et al., 2017) and may decrease the efficacy of existing coastal
protection structures (e.g., overtopping of breakwaters, groins, sea-
walls, and dikes, e.g. Arns et al., 2017). In extreme cases, an existing
effective coastal protection structure may be exposed to erosion due to
SLR (Ranasinghe, 2016). Climate change is also expected to affect storm
wave characteristics and storm surges in the coming decades (Bennett
et al., 2016; Hemer et al., 2012; Sterl et al., 2009; Nicholls et al., 2007;
IPCC, 2001), due to warming of the oceans and atmosphere. If storm
patterns and wave distributions are changed, coastline shapes will tend
to adjust to the new condition. It is a process involving greatly ac-
celerated shoreline erosion in many areas that will affect coastal com-
munities and infrastructure (Slott et al., 2006). Ranasinghe (2016)
stated that increased storm induced erosion may pose a more damaging
coastal impact than a slow, gradual erosion due to SLR. Climate change
also affects rivers systems. Ranasinghe et al. (2013) pointed out that the
40 percent of change in annual river flow (IPCC et al., 2013) and/or
fluvial sand supply in the estuary/lagoon will further increase (or de-
crease), due to the additional (reduced) demand of sand by the basin to
maintain equilibrium velocities within the estuary/lagoon.

The vulnerability concept is explained in various ways by the ex-
perts from different disciplines. Gouldby and Samuels (2005) defined
vulnerability using the Source-Path-Receptor-Consequences conceptual
model as a characteristic of a system that describes its potential to be
harmed. IPCC et al. (2014) states that exposure and vulnerability are
influenced by a wide range of social, economic, and cultural factors and
processes that have been incompletely considered to date, which make
quantitative assessments of their future trends difficult (high con-
fidence). These increasing effects of climate change on the coastal zone
has confronted the coastal zone managers and decision makers usually
with the limited resources and the question of where to invest. To make
this decision rational, vulnerability analysis is necessary along the coast
indicating the relative vulnerability of different areas.

Although the first tool-based initiative to evaluate the coastal vul-
nerability to SLR was developed by Carter (1990), the Sensitivity Index
was named a more simplistic approach based on a preliminary coastal
hazards database developed by Gornitz and Kanciruk (1989). The
methodology of Gornitz and Kanciruk (1989) became one of the sim-
plest, commonly used methods to assess coastal vulnerability to SLR,
particularly due to erosion and/or inundation. Their initial aim was to
develop a coastal hazards' database to provide a global overview of the
relative vulnerabilities of the world's coastlines to inundation and
erosion hazards associated with accelerated SLR. To reflect the physical
vulnerabilities of coastal regions, an improved version of this database
was named the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI), using the coastal
geomorphology, regional coastal slope, relative sea-level change, mean
significant wave height, historical shoreline change rate, and the mean
tidal range (Gornitz and Kanciruk, 1989). Additional to these listed
physical land and sea variables, Gornitz (1991) and Gornitz et al.
(1994) modified the CVI to distinguish the effects of severe storms on
coastal vulnerability by adding six more climatological variables, such
as the annual tropical storm probability, the annual hurricane prob-
ability, a hurricane frequency and intensity index, the mean forward
velocity, the annual mean extra-tropical cyclones, and the mean hur-
ricane surge.

The CVI approach proposed by Gornitz (1991) and Gornitz et al.
(1994), has been applied and/or adapted by numerous researchers to
assess coastal vulnerability around the world coastlines (e.g. Shaw
et al., 1998; Thieler and Hammar-Klose, 1999, 2000; Pendleton et al.,
2004: Boruff et al., 2005; Doukakis, 2005; Diez et al., 2007; Nageswara
Rao et al., 2008; Ozyurt and Ergin, 2010; Abuodha and Woodroffe,
2010; Lopez et al., 2016). CVI results can be used to highlight regions in
which factors contribute to shoreline changes and may have the
greatest potential to contribute to changes to shoreline retreat
(Gutierrez et al., 2009). Despite the robustness of CVI application plans
for climate change adaptation, the results require the need for an expert
opinion/judgement in the computation of vulnerability indices due to
the bias recorded in categorizations. Gibb et al. (1992) explained the
deficiency as the tendency to distort the output range and distribution
of the final index. On the other hand, expert opinion or judgment has
been commonly used to validate the findings of vulnerability assess-
ments, deciding on appropriate climate change adaptation plans, or
concerns on the thresholds of climate change events (Brooks and Adger,
2005; Doria et al., 2009; Arnell et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2009). On the
other hand, against the reported deficiencies of CVI tools by means of
output range distortions, nearly 30 percent % of the studies on coastal
vulnerability used this methodology (Cogswell et al., 2018).

There have been also several approaches for vulnerability analysis
that requires different types of data within different ranges and for-
mulas. For instance, besides the characterization of physical elements,
some vulnerability indexes also integrate the socio-economic variables.
These indexes include total population versus the total population af-
fected by floods, population density, the total non-local population,
poverty levels, and municipal wealth (McLaughlin et al., 2002;
McLaughlin and Cooper, 2010), loss of urban versus agricultural land
value (e.g. Snoussi et al., 2008; Sterr, 2008), and a community's social
vulnerability to natural hazards (Cutter et al., 2003). Devoy (2008)
added another perspective to coastal vulnerability due to SLR by means
of the costs of coastal protection.

Here in this study, coastal vulnerability refers to geophysical vul-
nerability and is used to distinguish the integrated coastal behavior
considering both negative and positive responses to climate change-
induced conditions (i.e., resilience and susceptibility). Vulnerability
assessment studies classify coastlines differently from strictly quanti-
tative to semi-quantitative, non-adaptive to perfectly adaptive, science-
driven to policy-driven, and simplistic to sophisticated, etc. (Fussel and
Klein, 2006). In this study, CVI is based on the previous studies
(Gornitz, 1991; Shaw et al., 1998; Thieler and Hammar-Klose, 2000;
and Lopez et al., 2016), because of their efficiency and wide and large
spatial scale use. They use similar physical variables and permit to as-
sess vulnerability just associated to physical impacts of erosion and
inundation. It is aimed to compare the sensitivity of each selected study
for the regional characteristics due to differences in each ranking
system, and then select the most robust one to guide coastal managers
on decision making process. This analysis is applied to a coastal stretch
characteristic of sensitive human-influenced Mediterranean coastline
conditions, i.e. the Barcelona coastal region.

2. Study area

The Barcelona coast is located in the NE Spanish Mediterranean and
it extends about 100 km around Barcelona city (Fig. 1). This stretch is
representative of highly developed areas of the Mediterranean coastal
zone, with large urban settlements and intensive use of the coastline for
leisure and tourism, and as a consequence accumulating human-in-
duced pressures, which make this a high sensitive and vulnerable
coastline which has experienced an increase in coastal damages during
the last decades (Jiménez et al., 2012). This area concentrates about 75
percent of the Catalan population and about the 52 percent of the
Catalan GNP (see e.g. Jiménez et al., 2017).

It is a wave-dominated coast, comprising more than 100 beaches

along 4 coastal comarcas (administrative units); Maresme, Barcelonès,
Llobregat, and Garraf (Fig. 1).The beaches are characterized by coarse
sand sediment northwards of Barcelona (d50≥ 0.4mm) whereas south
of the Barcelona harbor they are composed by fine sediments
(d50≥ 0.2 mm) (Jiménez and Valdemoro, 2019). While about 65% of
the Catalan beaches are retreating under current conditions (Jiménez
and Valdemoro, 2019), the study area includes some of the most
eroding beaches, the Maresme coast, with an average evolution rate of
about −0.7m/y and eroding stretches retreating at an average rate of
−1.5m/y (Jiménez and Valdemoro, 2019). This coastal stretch sup-
ports an important infrastructure network, being a coastal railway
connecting Barcelona with northern small cities the most important
one. This infrastructure is sensitive to storm-induced events in such a
way that under the impact of extreme storms, the service can be dis-
rupted (e.g. Ballesteros et al., 2018b; Jiménez et al., 2018). On the other
hand, the city waterfront is composed by a set of artificial beaches
which were built after the 90's and that, currently, support an intensive
recreational use during all over the year. As an example, according to
the Municipality of Barcelona, these beaches received more than 4.7
million of visitors during 2016. The Llobregat sector comprises deltaic
beaches southward of Barcelona harbor with an area of natural interest
at the Eastern part, and of residential and recreational interest at the
Western end. Finally, the Garraf sector includes pocket beaches with a
dominant recreational use.

3. Material and methods

The data used in this study to assess coastal vulnerability included
in the corresponding indicators such as geomorphology and geology,
the coastal slope of the region, sea level change, shoreline change,
significant wave height, and tidal range. All the required data have
been stored and manipulated within a geographic information system
(Table 1).

The historical data sets for each variable are implemented as attri-
bute tables, and vulnerability scores are calculated according to each
selected methodology.

The recent coastline is trimmed from the original, projected ED50
and freely available European coastline shape file (EEA, 2017) and used
with the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. After that, the
coastline is divided into 160 cells of 1 km by 1 km comprising a grid

template using ArcGIS10.5.1.
Variables are categorized on a scale of 1–5 (low risk to high risk) by

breaking the range into five equal divisions (Table 2). Beside the
geospatial comparison of varying vulnerability classes, the vulnerability
class distributions are evaluated by using statistical analysis (skewness
and mean). In this context, the cell distribution around moderate vul-
nerability classes (mean) and their peaks or extreme vulnerability ca-
tegories are analyzed.

3.1. The CVI and its components

CVI studies addressing geophysical vulnerabilities are mostly
adapted from Gornitz (1991) and the basic of physical–geological
parameters include SLR, geomorphology, coastal slope and regional
elevation, shoreline change, significant wave height, and tidal range.
Geomorphological landforms represent resistance to erosion, where the
rates of erosion are considered indicators of sensitivity to coastal pro-
cesses. Wave energy is related to capacity for erosion, where relief and
vertical land movements are considered indicators of inundation risk.

The selected methods and their ranking table comparisons are
summarized in Table 2.

3.1.1. Geomorphology and geology
The morphology of the coast plays a pertinent role in determining

the response of the coast to SLR, as it expresses the relative erodibility
and the degree of resistance of the different landforms varying from
high cliffs to sandy shores (Thieler and Hammar-Klose, 1999).

Geology or, namely, a rock-type variable, is associated with erod-
ibility risk. Bedrock lithology, shore materials, and coastal landforms
vary substantially in terms of their resistance to erosion. A generalized
scale of lithologic and geomorphologic resistance to erosion was dis-
cussed by Gornitz and Kanciruk (1989).

The geomorphology analysis of the Catalan coast shows the major
landforms of Barcelona's coastline. Sediments along the Barcelona city
coast originated from the Besòs delta and the Llobregat emerged deltas,
which are separated by the Barcelona Coastal Plain and are bounded by
the Catalan Coastal Ranges to the north (Fig. 1). Maresme, extending
from the city of Barcelona to the north is formed by the Tordera delta
coast (Jiménez et al., 2018). The Besòs delta is limited by the Littoral
Ranges to the north, and by the Barcelona Coastal Plain to the west,

which separates the Besòs delta from the neighboring Llobregat delta. It
is a Holocene depositional system that was also active during the
Pleistocene (or Ice Age). On the other hand, Barcelona city area is
characterized by artificial beaches and a big harbor that extends along
more than 15 km. Its southern part developed over the delta plain of the
Llobregat River, which create a sandy coastline over 18 km long. Ad-
ditionally, in the south, the Garraf coast is characterized by the low
calcareous cliffs (Ojeda and Guillén, 2008).

A detailed digital geomorphological map is made by using digitized
raster topographic sheets of 1:50,000 scale (Table 2), provided by the
Cartographic and Geological Institute of Catalonia (ICGC, 2017). A
geological map of the Besòs delta and adjacent zones is digitized at
scale of 1:50,000 derived from the data sources of the Instituto Geo-
lógico y Minero de España (IGME, 2017). The delta is being constituted
by sediments supplied by the Besòs River and their tributaries.

The digitalized geomorphological map is then attributed into the
1 km×1 km grid cells, so that each cell has its own unique value to be
evaluated in selected CVIs with varying values.

3.1.2. Coastal slope and regional elevation
The coastal slope is an indicator of not only the relative risk of in-

undation, but also the potential speed of shoreline retreat. Thus, on a
steep coast, the consequence of SLR would be insignificant, which is on
the contrary to a gentle sloping coast, where any rise in sea level would
inundate large extents of land (Nageswara Rao et al., 2008).

While the elevation zone within 1m of the shoreline faces the
highest probability of permanent inundation, the coastal strip within
5m of the present shoreline is also at high risk to above the normal
tides from severe storm surges. Gornitz (1991) stated that the hazard
decreases progressively for higher average elevations. In any case, it has
to be considered that storm surges along the Catalan coast are not
especially relevant, being the wave-induced run-up, the most important
component contributing to storm-induced total water level (Mendoza
and Jiménez, 2009).

The emerged coastal slope of Barcelona's coasts is calculated by
using the orthometric height of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM),
which is based on the altimetry information of the topographic base of
Catalonia 1:5.000 provided by the ICGC (2017) (Table 1). The DEM of
the region is regenerated with using a 2m×2m regular grid model
provided in and reconfigured as 10× 10m tiles, then it is mosaicked in
GeoTIFF format in ArcGIS 10.5.1. The mosaic tool is useful when two or
more adjacent raster datasets need to be merged into one entity. Some
mosaic techniques can help minimize the abrupt changes along the
boundaries of the overlapping raster.

After the mean regional elevations are calculated, the slopes are
calculated along the coastline. The slope values are characterized with
1 km×1 km grid cells, varying from 1 or 2 to 95 percentiles. The ob-
tained data indicates that the regional elevations vary from a few me-
ters to 80–90m respectively. Spatial aggregation of values into 1 km
grids results in relatively mild slope coastal profile.

3.1.3. Sea-level change
The relative sea-level change variable is derived from the increase

(or decrease) in annual mean water elevation over time as measured at
tide gauge stations along the coast (e.g., Emery and Aubrey, 1991). This
variable inherently includes both the global eustatic SLR as well as local
isostatic and tectonic land motion (subsidence). Duro et al. (2004) re-
ported that there are rich soft sediments in pore water and organic
matter in Llobregat delta plain, with average subsidence rates of
1.25mm yr−1, and 6mm yr−1 as a maximum value. Relative sea-level
change data is a historical record, and thus it shows changes for only
recent time scales (the last 50–100 years).

The Barcelona tide gauge data set starting from 1993 to 2016 is also
used as the primary source of information for sea level trends in the
study area. The tide gauge is placed at the dock 140 of the ENAGAS
building at 2.17° E, 41.34° N coordinates (Fig. 2). The historical data set
is downloaded from Puertos del Estado (Table 2) (Puertos del Estado,
2017).

3.1.4. Shoreline change
Coastlines are in different types of coastal landforms including

beaches, tidal flats, deltas, cliffs, and barrier islands with varying re-
sponses to erosion/accretion. Erosion and accretion patterns indicate
the dynamics of the coast. In CVI methodology, shoreline change is used
as an indicator for the potential impact of climate change, and it can be
considered as a resilience capacity of the coast.

Similar with most of the beaches in Mediterranean Sea, Barcelona
beaches are associated with both natural processes and human-induced
actions (Ojeda and Guillén, 2008). The sedimentary shorelines are
subject to natural, dynamic processes such as the southwards directed
net longshore sediment transport (CIIRC, 2010; CEDEX, 2014; Jiménez
and Valdemoro, 2019).

The shoreline change is calculated here based on the shoreline re-
cords of 2004 and 2016 (Luijendijk et al., 2018). Digitized shoreline
records are calculated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System
(DSAS) tool of Arc-GIS developed by U.S. Geological Survey. The DSAS
is an extension that enhances the normal functionality of ESRI ArcGIS
software. DSAS uses a measurement baseline method (Leatherman and
Clow, 1983) to calculate rate-of-change statistics for a time series of
shorelines. The baseline is constructed and served as the starting point
for all transects cast by the DSAS application. Transects intersect each
shoreline at the measurement points that are used to calculate shore-
line-change rates (Thieler et al., 2009). Transects are placed at 100-m
intervals along the shoreline stretch, either landward or seaward, and
perpendicularly to the baseline. Shoreline change (m/yr) is then ana-
lyzed to derive the rate of shoreline change over time by using the End-
Point Rate (EPR) technique. The major advantages of the EPR are the
ease of computation and the minimal requirement of only two shoreline
dates (Thieler et al., 2009).

Representing positive or negative values due to natural processes
are then shown as EPR results, indicating accretion or erosion rates.
After that, the results are spatially aggregated at a 1 km grid cell scale
and attributed to each grid cell respectively.

3.1.5. Significant wave height
The waves are the main hydrodynamic force on the beaches,

transforming the shoreline by sediment transport. Waves with larger
wave height are broken with higher energy on beaches and mobilize
larger sediment volumes and induce larger morphodynamic changes.
Thus, the increase in the incident wave power, particularly if it is

combined with an increased sea level, catalyze many coastal responses
such as erosion and inundation. Hence, they have vital consequences in
terms of coastal geomorphology. Therefore, in CVI applications, wave
height, is included as an indicator of wave energy, driving coastal

sediment budget.
To account this effect of wave power, Lopez et al. (2016) proposed

to use a variable indicating the power content instead of using a single
dependence on wave height as mots of CVI usually does. They proposed
to use the formula (Equation (1)) to define the storm erosion-induced
coastal vulnerability.

In this study, wave data along the coast was obtained from the of-
ficial online website of Puertos del Estado (Ports of the State) for the
period of 1958–2016 (Puertos del Estado, 2017).

Hs95%=95th percentile wave height along the coast
Hs threshold= locally adopted threshold for storm definition

According to the data, the mean significant wave height varies be-
tween 0.45m and 0.6 m whereas the maximum significant wave height
was 5m. The corresponding mean wave period was about 4.5 s. Fig. 2
shows the directional distribution of wave conditions along the study
area for the available data.

The total Hs along the Catalan coast shows a gradual decrease from
north to south and the main direction of the wave energy gradually
turns from north to northeast, east, southeast, and finally to the south
(e.g. Bowman et al., 2009).

3.1.6. Tidal range
The tidal range is linked to both the permanent and episodic in-

undation hazards. Gornitz (1991) suggests that a high tidal range is
associated with stronger tidal currents, which have the capacity to
cause the erosion and transportation of sediment in such a way that,
macro-tidal coasts (> 4m) will be more vulnerable than those with
smaller values. Similarly, Shaw et al. (1998) modifying Gornitz (1991)
added that an increase in the mean water level would increase the
flooding frequency of high intertidal environments, such as deltas and
estuaries. This will also result in the flooding of areas presently above

astronomical high tide levels. According to the perspective of both
Shaw et al. (1998) and Gornitz (1991); a coastal area is considered
highly vulnerable if it experiences a high tidal range, whereas those
with low tidal ranges are designated to be of low vulnerability.

Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000) classified micro-tidal coasts to be
of high vulnerability and macro-tidal coasts to be of low vulnerability.
The reason behind this argument is that, on micro-tidal coasts, the sea
level is always quite close to high tide; therefore, in the event of a storm
surge, flooding is more likely than at macro-tidal coasts (Pendleton
et al., 2004). On the other hand, at macro-tidal coasts, it is not unlikely
that the sea level during a storm surge event is significantly lower than
the high-tide level, thus increasing the possibility of reduced flood risk
(Rosen, 1977).

Tidal range values of the study area are obtained in the tide tables
from the tide gauge placed at the dock 140 of the ENAGAS building at
2.17° E, 41.34° N coordinates. The historical data set is downloaded
from Puertos del Estado (Table 1) (Puertos del Estado, 2017). The
Catalan coast is micro-tidal, with a range of 0.2m. The tidal range
variable has been assigned a mid-value rank; all 160 cells have been
assigned the same value within this study area, which is 0.23m.

3.2. CVI calculations

One of the initial methods to evaluate the potential vulnerability has
been broadly adapted from Gornitz (1990, 1991), who used the U.S.
coastline on a national scale by focusing on seven variables that
strongly influenced coastal evolution. The overall CVI is described as
the square root of the product of the variables divided by the number of
variables (n).

a4= shoreline change rates
a5= significant wave height
a6= tidal range
a1= geomorphology
a2= coastal slope/relief
a3= relative sea level rate

Here, Python scripts(Python Software Foundation) for each ranking
table are created to assign the vulnerability classes of each variable
within the ArcGIS spatial calculation tool with respect to their threshold
values for each category. Vulnerability levels of each variable are
classified from 1 (very low vulnerability) to 5 (very high vulnerability),
according to the variable ranking tables of the corresponding study.

The vulnerability class values are used in Equation (2) to calculate
the composite CVI value for all the different coastal stretches that
combine to form the national coastline. Subsequently, the vulnerability
categories are represented with percentile ranges as 0–25%, 25–50%,
50–75%, and 75–100% (Thieler and Hammar-Klose, 2000; Shaw et al.,
1998). In other words, a value of 1 represents the lowest vulnerability
and where the value of 4 represents the highest vulnerability.

The distribution of vulnerability classes of cells are then examined
with statistical analysis by way of skewness and the mean values of
each study to examine the reason behind the difference of the assigned
vulnerability classes and to help with selecting the most realistic ap-
proach for future planning.

4. Results

4.1. Physical and geomorphological parameters

4.1.1. Geomorphology and geology
The Maresme coast is an almost rectilinear sedimentary coastline

which is only interrupted by several marinas. Next, the Barcelona city
area is characterized by artificial beaches and a big harbor that extend
along more than 15 km. Its southern part developed over the delta plain
of the Llobregat River, which creates a sandy coastline over 18 km long.
Additionally, in the south, the Garraf coast is characterized by the low
calcareous cliffs (Ojeda and Guillén, 2008). Fig. 3-a depicts the geo-
morphological component of analyzed CVIs.

Although the geology of Garraf, for instance, is mostly dominated by
the cliffs, spatial aggregation of adjacent series of pocket beaches
within 1 km grid dominate the geomorphological character mostly as
sandy beaches. This leads to the following assigned vulnerability
rankings: 74 percent of the grids are sand, 11 percent is cobble, 11
percent is Portland, and 4 percent is cobble beach and low cliffs.

Gornitz (1991), Shaw et al. (1998), Thieler and Hammar-Klose
(2000) and Lopez et al. (2016) indicate similar vulnerability with re-
spect to geomorphology. The classification due to geomorphological
characteristics indicates that 74 percent of the coastline is very highly
vulnerable, while 11 percent is highly vulnerable, 0.6 percent is mod-
erately vulnerable, 11.4 percent is at a low level of vulnerability, and 3

percent has a very low vulnerability level. The green grid cells are
showing where the coastline is composed by the Barcelona Port.

Further, regarding the geomorphology variable, only Shaw et al.
(1998) and Gornitz (1991) added the geology variable to be included in
the calculations of the overall CVI. Fig. 3-b is showing how the region's
rock type contributes to overall vulnerability. The composition of the
passive (rigid) part of the Catalan coast is clearly dominated (about
83%) by the natural component (cliffs and rocky coasts), with the ex-
ception of Maresme (coast northwards of Barcelona), where the rigid
coastline is essentially human-built (revetment protecting the coastal
railway and other coastal protection structures). According to their
ranking systems, both agreed that most of the coastline of the Barcelona
province is highly vulnerable with respect to the coasts' resistance to
inundation by SLR. According to the calculations and their ranking
categories, 81 percent of the stretch is highly vulnerable (namely, in
Barcelones, Maresme, and Garraf municipalities), 10 percent of the cells
are moderately vulnerable, 1 percent of cells are at a low vulnerability
level, and 8 percent of cells are at a very low level of vulnerability due
to their geological characteristics. The calculations also show that
compared to three other coastal comarcas, Llobregat is moderately
vulnerable to SLR due to the geological characteristics of the coast.

4.1.2. Coastal slope and regional elevation
Shaw et al. (1998) and Gornitz (1991) used regional elevation

parameters to characterize the vulnerability of coastal regions due to
inundation, while Lopez et al. (2016) and Thieler and Hammar-Klose
(2000) prefer to define this variable as coastal slope.

Coastal slope and regional relief variable ranking comparisons for
Barcelona's coast are shown in Fig. 4. In this figure, Shaw et al. (1998)
and Gornitz (1991) both indicate similar vulnerability classes due to the
elevation characteristics of the region. According to the calculations, 87
percent of the cells are very highly vulnerable, 6 percent are highly
vulnerable, 2 percent are moderately vulnerable, 1 percent are at a low
level of vulnerability, and 4 percent are at a very low vulnerability level
due to relief variables. On the other hand, spatial distribution of the
vulnerability levels indicates that, according to their ranking categories,
Shaw et al. (1998) and Gornitz (1991) depict the whole coastline as
inherently highly vulnerable. This conclusion holds in areas, with the
exception of the coasts of some municipalities of Garraf; such as Vila-
nova i la Geltrú and Sitges, and the municipalities of Maresme, such as
Vilassar de Mar and Cabrera de Mar.

On the other hand, Lopez et al. (2016) and Thieler and Hammar-
Klose (2000) indicate similar vulnerability classes due to a coastal slope
with relatively higher category values. The calculations made within
this ranking classification shows that according to Lopez et al. (2016),

14 percent of the total grid cells are very low vulnerable, 13 percent are
low vulnerable, 26 percent are moderately vulnerable, 19 percent are
highly vulnerable, and 28 percent are very highly vulnerable due to the
coastal slope variable. While in the calculations of Thieler and
Hammar-Klose (2000), 73 percent of the grid cells are very low, 7
percent are low, 4 percent are moderate, 7 percent are very high, and 9
percent are very high vulnerable due to the emerged coastal slope of the
region.

Essentially, if these variables are analyzed separately as coastal
slope and coastal elevation, it can be relatively easier to define the huge
difference. Although the coastal slope and coastal elevation are basi-
cally representing a similar approach, the coastal slope in fact re-
presents the ratio between the emerged elevation and the width of the
coast.

Although Lopez et al. (2016) and Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000)
use the same variable, namely coastal slope, the ranking values of Lopez
et al. (2016) represent more conservative ranges than compared to
Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000), which indicate higher vulnerability.
Consequently, the same mild, shore-face slope values point out higher
vulnerable scores from Lopez et al. (2016) compared to Thieler and
Hammar-Klose (2000).

On the other hand, Shaw et al. (1998) and Gornitz (1991) define the
inundation risk by the elevation of the land. In this case, due to the
selected rank proposed by these authors, the Barcelona coast scored as
having a very high level of vulnerability.

4.1.3. Sea level change
The sea level change variable for coasts of the Barcelona province

does not show any variances spatially, since the data is retrieved from
the same data station along the shoreline and this variable usually
presents a small spatial variation unless that the area of study is really
large. Fig. 5 is showing the relative SLR comparison for the four se-
lected ranking classes.

As seen from Fig. 5, grids of “a” (representing Lopez et al., 2016)
indicate a moderate vulnerability class with an assumption of SLR of
0.18–0.38m corresponding to RLSR of 1.5–3.9mm annually, which is a
relatively low value. According to the ranking table of Thieler and
Hammar-Klose (2000), Barcelona coasts are very highly vulnerable to
relative SLR (Fig. 5-b). On the other hand, based on the ranking tables
of both Shaw et al. (1998) and Gornitz (1991), the shoreline is highly
vulnerable to SLR (Fig. 5-c).

4.1.4. Shoreline change
The adapted values of Shaw et al. (1998) for shoreline changes

differ from the ranges used by Gornitz (1991) and Thieler and Hammar-
Klose (2000), because some of Canada's coasts experience extensive,

persistent erosion, but average rates are less than 1m annually
(Table 1). Most rocky coastlines are assigned a rate of 0m annually,
although very slow recession commonly occurs. Fig. 6 is showing the
shoreline change comparison for varying ranking values for selected
CVIs for the study area. As seen in the figure, Thieler and Hammar-
Klose (2000); Gornitz (1991), and Lopez et al. (2016) have slight dif-
ferences in shoreline change due to ranking values. Thus, the main
difference is observed between Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000) and
Shaw et al. (1998).

In this context, it can be easily said that the approach of Thieler and
Hammar-Klose (2000) on shoreline change is more conservative than
that of Shaw et al. (1998), especially for the northern part of the pro-
vince. On the other hand, they are all agreed on the high vulnerability
scale, especially for the Garraf and Sitges shores located in the southern
part of Barcelona. Unlike other applications of the CVI rankings, which
considered five shoreline evolution categories, here, and the above
three behavioral types were directly assigned by Lopez et al. (2016):
very low, moderate, and very high vulnerability classes as shown in
Table 1.

In these comparisons, the vulnerability categories of Lopez et al.
(2016) are listed as very high, moderate, and very low. According to
their rankings, 14 percent of the shoreline in grid cells is at a very high
risk, 61 percent of the shoreline has a moderate erosion risk, and 25
percent of shoreline is at a high erosion risk.

Since Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000) is adapted from Gornitz
(1991), they agreed on the vulnerability levels. Eventually, according to
their ranking categories, 8 percent of the shoreline in grids has very
high vulnerability, 7 percent is highly vulnerable, 60 percent is mod-
erately vulnerable, 14 percent is at a low level of vulnerability, and 11
percent is at a very low erosion risk. On the other hand, the results of
Shaw et al. (1998) show a more flexible evaluation on erosion vulner-
ability of Barcelona's coasts respectively. Due to their ranking classes,
14 percent of the stretch has very high vulnerability, 6 percent is highly
vulnerable, 6 percent is moderately vulnerable, 26 percent is at a low
level of vulnerability, and 48 percent of the coast has a very low vul-
nerability level.

When it is evaluated spatially, all of the CVIs shoreline change
vulnerability classifications indicate grids of relatively low vulner-
ability, especially for the municipalities of Maresme (except a few grid
cells). However, Ballesteros et al. (2018) indicates the medium-term
shoreline displacement rate along the northwards of Barcelona, namely
the Maresme coast, and highlights that the coastline is mostly eroding,
particularly downcoast of ports, as expected. The difference between
the relatively low vulnerability ranking values is mostly due to the
weighted average values of 100m transects contributing to each 1 km
coastline cell.

4.1.5. Significant wave height
Fig. 7 shows the attributed values for the wave height and wave

climate in the grid cells. Maximum and mean wave height values are
gained from 10 wave stations that represent the wave climate along the
shoreline. The reports shows that the maximum wave heights are 5m,
while mean wave heights are 0.4–0.55m. Therefore, the whole shore-
line is in very low, low, and moderate risk classes for all selected CVIs.

The ranking classes for Lopez et al. (2016) and Thieler and
Hammar-Klose (2000) indicate that the wave climate or mean wave
height below 0.55–0.65m has a very low level of vulnerability. In this
context, the whole Barcelona coastline is representing a very low vul-
nerability level with respect to wave energy.

Conversely, the calculations based on rankings of Shaw et al. (1998)
and Gornitz (1991) reveal that the maximum wave height values be-
tween 3.0 and 4.9m are categorized as low vulnerability and values
between 5.0 and 5.9m are in the moderate vulnerability category. In
this context, 52 percent of cells are in the moderate category and 48
percent of cells are categorized as in the low vulnerability category. In
this context, the coasts of Llobregat and the northern municipalities of
Maresme have moderate vulnerability levels and the municipalities of
Garraf and Barcelones have a low vulnerability contribution to the
overall CVI.

4.1.6. Tidal range
The Catalan coast is micro-tidal, with a range of less than 0.2 m,

where the tidal range can be considered negligible. The comparison of
the tidal range of Barcelona's coastline for the ranking value of various
authors is given in Fig. 8. Similar to sea-level records, the tidal records
originate from one data station along the Barcelona province.

As seen in Table 2, Lopez et al. (2016) and Thieler and Hammar-

Klose (2000) claim that vulnerability evaluations for the coast rank at
very highly vulnerable level due to the tidal effect, while Shaw et al.
(1998) and Gornitz (1991) claim a very low level of vulnerability. The
ranking tables of Lopez et al. (2016) and Thieler and Hammar-Klose
(2000) agree that all the grid cells of shore contributions to the overall
CVI have a value of five (very high tidal vulnerability), while Shaw
et al. (1998) and Gornitz (1991) considered the contribution of the tidal
effect on the overall CVI as having a value of one (a very low vulner-
ability level).

Gornitz (1991) emphasized that a coastal area with a high tidal
range is considered highly vulnerable, whereas those with a low tidal
range are designated to be of low vulnerability.

Contrary to Gornitz (1991), Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000) de-
fines the tidal vulnerability relating the impact of a tidal range with the
potential influence of storms on coastal evolution. They explain the
relationship as a 50 percent chance of a storm occurring above mean
tide. Consequently, according to their evaluations, a micro-tidal
coastline is essentially always near high tide and, therefore, always at
the greatest risk of significant storm impact.

4.2. The overall vulnerability classification along the coast

Fig. 9 is showing the overall ranking category distribution for the
four selected modified ranking tables.

A vulnerability comparison due to percentile areal distribution for
Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000); Shaw et al. (1998); and Gornitz
(1991), who all divided the overall CVI values into equal 4 percentage
classes, is summarized in Fig. 10. Originally, Lopez et al. (2016) divided
the overall CVI values into five equal classes. However, in this study the
overall vulnerability classes of Lopez et al. (2016) are distributed over 4
equal percentage classes to compare with the other selected CVIs.

The distribution of vulnerability classes of cells are then examined
through statistical analysis by means of skewness and mean values of
each study to examine the reasons behind the differences of the as-
signed vulnerability classes and help to select the most realistic ap-
proach for future planning.

In this context, a further characterization of the number cell dis-
tribution among the vulnerability classes is explained using skewness,
mean and maximum values (Table 3). These basic statistical termi-
nology explains how the cells are distributed around sample mean
(skewness) or in other words among the low and very high vulnerability
classes.

Skewness is negative for a distribution in which the data are spread
out more to the left for Lopez et al. (2016) and Gornitz (1991). That
means the distribution of vulnerability categories to the left shifted,

indicating low vulnerability levels. However, the vulnerability dis-
tribution of Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000) with highly skewed
characters shows a higher moderate vulnerability level than the other
authors (Table 3).

The high skewness supports the dense cell distribution around the
moderate vulnerability class, which attempts the evaluation of high and
low vulnerability classes diffused in the moderate class. This contains
the risk of ignorance with respect to the highly vulnerable coastal
stretch when decision makers plan action lists.

The spatial distribution of varying overall CVI categories and their
statistical meanings are discussed in detail in the Discussion section.

5. Discussion

Besides the scientific popularity of usage and development of vul-
nerability index tools, CVIs are strong management tools to highlight
potential coastal hotspots to a given set of climatic hazards. They effi-
ciently simplify a number of processes acting at different scales, which
should require applying robust and detailed modeling to fully char-
acterize the induced coastal response. This permits to identify coastal
hotspots to analyzed climatic hazards at regional scale which is a cru-
cial step in long-term and large scale coastal planning to define coastal
protection and adaptation strategies. However, this approach presents
some uncertainties that can condition the representativeness of the
obtained results and, in consequence, the effectiveness of adopted de-
cisions. To tackle this problem from the practical standpoint, it has been
made an analysis of the effect of selecting different versions of the index
to be used and, they have been applied to a coastal stretch re-
presentative of urban Mediterranean coastlines.

Thus, in this study the vulnerability of the Barcelona coast is ana-
lyzed by comparing the sensitivity of four different versions of the CVI.
They are based on the equation proposed by Gornitz (1991) which
computes the vulnerability index as the square root of the product of
the variables divided by the number of variables. Although there are
some concerns about the potential error sources due to its tendency to
distort the output range and distribution of the final (Gibb et al., 1992),
this method is still widely used. Furthermore, Cogswell et al. (2018)
claims that the method is sensitive to the number of variables used;
more variables increase the skewness, and mean of the coastline index

distribution at predictable rates and, to avoid such aspects they propose
to use the geometric mean. However, as Cogswell et al. (2018) pointed
out, that method also presents some shortcomings.

In this study, the four selected CVI versions include six to seven
variables contributing to the overall scores, which are clustered in four
vulnerability classes. In order to select the “best” one properly re-
presenting the relative vulnerability of the study area, it is crucial to
analyze the bias and their sources. Consequently, here in this paper, the
discussions on the sources of bias focus not only on the variables and
their ranking table categories individually, but also on the statistical
parameters of the overall CVI categorizations.

Geomorphology is the only variable that all the four CVI rankings
categorized with the same vulnerability classes. This is due to fact that
all of them consider the role played by this variable to control vul-
nerability in the same way. Moreover, as this variable is assessed in
qualitative terms, i.e. coastal type, the associated ranking intervals are
almost the same for the different methods.

With respect to the wave climate component, relatively small dif-
ferences are detected among the different methods. This is due to the
different definitions adopted to characterize the wave climate. Formally
speaking, if this component is going to be used to characterize storm-
induced risks, the use of the mean wave height should not be the best
choice. In this context, the use of an extreme value such as the max-
imum wave height (Gornitz, 1991; Shaw et al., 1998) would be a more
representative approach. In any case, the selected intervals to char-
acterize the vulnerability associated to this component should be
adapted to regional wave characteristics since they can significantly
vary. In the case showed here it is recommended to adapt such range to
the Western Mediterranean storm wave climate (Mendoza et al., 2011).

Although all methods consider shoreline evolution in the same way,
they provide different vulnerability values due to differences in the
ranking system. Again, the most realistic option will be to select a rank
adapted to local conditions. This should consider not only the typical
shoreline evolution rates in the area but, also the characteristic beach
width. Thus, a given shoreline retreat will have not the same practical
consequences in a narrow or a wide beach. Thus, this rank should be
established taking into account regional statistics on shoreline changes
and beach widths (Jiménez and Valdemoro, 2019), as well as the
dominant beach uses which determine the optimum and minimum
widths to be managed (e.g. Jiménez et al., 2017). Moreover, the way in
which local values are spatially integrated may hide the real coastal
vulnerability. When averaging the shoreline behavior within a sector,
accretive sectors are artificially compensating erosive ones. However,
in reality, this compensation does not exist and if a significant per-
centage of a given sector is erosive, it should be necessary to reflect it to
properly identify the sector as vulnerable. This occurs along the Mar-
esme coast where this way of integration hides the presence of severe
eroding stretches (Ballesteros et al., 2018; Jiménez and Valdemoro,
2019).

Coastal slope and elevation assessment show a larges variation in
vulnerability classes. For instance, Shaw et al. (1998) and Gornitz
(1991) used coastal elevation to reflect the vulnerabilities due to SLR
and storm surge. In this case study, their ranking category reveals that
most of the Barcelona coastline is highly vulnerable. However, as it was
previously mentioned, this is not directly applicable to the Barcelona
case. As storm surge is not significant in this area, the storm-induced

inundation is mainly controlled by run-up. Thus, when assessing this
risk factor by using inundation models, obtained results characterize
this coast as relatively moderate to low vulnerable with few exemptions
associated to the low-lying stretches such as the Tordera and Llobregat
delta (Ballesteros et al., 2018b; Jiménez et al., 2018). This also indicates
that the use of a “universal” rank is not efficient to properly reflect local
vulnerabilities, and that this rank should reflect regional expected
water level variations.

With respect to the tidal contribution, CVI's reflect very different
vulnerability conditions because they consider the role played by this
variable in a very different way. With independence of this, one of the
observed features is that, unless the analysis is done at a very large
spatial scale where tidal range can significantly vary, this component
does not add significant information to discriminate the most vulner-
able spots along the coast. This is the case of the study area where CVIs
classified the entire coast as very high or very low vulnerable without
any small-scale variation. In order to select how to account the role of
tides in CVI, its contribution to the expected impact has to be properly
considered. Although, as previously mentioned, different views can be
adopted, it has to be considered that micro-tidal coastlines are very
sensitive to SLR and their coastal ecosystems (Benassai et al., 2015),
such as wetlands, are less resilient to water level changes (e.g. Cahoon
and Guntenspergen, 2010).

Similarly to tides, the SLR component does not reflect any spatial
variation. Again, this is a factor that will have relevance in large scale
analysis where local conditions modify the expected sea level changes
along the coast (e.g. Sallenger et al., 2012). Moreover, unless local data
are derived from local observations, the use of sea level projections will
also strongly condition a relatively homogeneous value with its con-
tribution being given by the selected scenario, which will be a choice of
the analyst.

As it has been highlighted, the use of the different methods may
indicate a different vulnerability for a given coastal sector, in such a
way that one grid cell can be evaluated from low to a very high vul-
nerability levels. Fig. 11 shows the spatial distribution of the variability
in the overall relative vulnerability level indicated by the different
methods along the study area computed for each 1 km cell. Obtained
results indicate that the 5 percent of the 160 coastal cells present a
difference in three vulnerability levels ranking from having a low to a
very high vulnerability. Conversely, 25 percent of the grid cells are
showing two vulnerability classes difference, which vary either from
low to high or moderate to very high vulnerability. This reflects the
importance of the selection of the method, although all tested method
serve to assess coastal vulnerability they provide different information

and this may lead to different decisions.
It is important to understand the effect of a calculation upon the

resultant index and its distribution, while selecting a specific method
for the integration of variables in calculation of a vulnerability index.
Cogswell et al. (2018) stated that the CVI equation proposed by Gornitz
(1991) is sensitive to the vulnerability class percentile divisions that are
assigned due to the skewed index values. Therefore, the conversion of
the overall vulnerability index scores into percentiles to divide them
into various categories is usually subjective and subject to expert opi-
nion (Fussel and Klein, 2006). Despite the knowledge of the experts on
climate change and relevant risks, their opinion is not devoid of biases
that may occur. Their priority shaped by their values and understanding
of climate and social systems (Lowe and Lorenzoni, 2007) and their
academic backgrounds (Hinkel et al., 2013) will affect the overall re-
sults in a vulnerability assessments.

Finally, as it can be deduced from this discussion, it is clear that
although CVI's are useful tools for identifying vulnerable coastal areas,
they need to be adequately used. Thus, a simple decision such as se-
lecting a given method may have serious consequences from the man-
agement standpoint, since vulnerable hotspots can be identified in
different locations. As an example, in the analyzed case whereas two
methods classify the Maresme coastal stretch as mostly very high vul-
nerable, the other two ones significantly lower this classification.
Moreover, it is also necessary to assess which is the partial contribution
of each component to the overall vulnerability since this will also
condition how expected differences will vary along the coast. Thus, in
the analyzed case, in spite of the mentioned difference in Maresme, all
methods classify the Llobregat coast as a very high vulnerable stretch.
So, a priori is not possible to assume that a method is over or under
predicting the overall vulnerability. Due to this, it is recommended that
before to include the use of CVI as a tool to help in coastal risk man-
agement, to perform a sensitivity analysis and to select a ranking system
properly reflecting local conditions.

6. Conclusions

Four different CVI computation approaches were applied to the
160 km long Barcelona (Spain) coastline, and results were compared
and contrasted. As seen from the vulnerability categories of each vari-
able and also the overall CVIs, the different approached reflect different
vulnerability categories for the same grid cell. Among the CVI variables,
the vulnerability categories of wave climate or wave height and
shoreline change indicate minor differences for each CVI application.
On the other hand, the most severe vulnerability class variations are

seen in coastal slope and elevation, relative sea level rise, and tidal
range variables.

Based on this analysis, Shaw et al. (1998) method appears to be the
more realistic approach to assess vulnerability of the Barcelona coast.
Taking into account the contribution of the maximum wave height and
the tidal range to the overall CVI, the overall CVI scores and their
distribution over cells, Shaw et al. (1998) approach indicates a higher
number of areas with low and moderate vulnerability, compared to the
other considered approaches.

Robust evaluation approaches, such as CVI applications, play an
important role in facilitating future decision-making processes of
coastal management strategies, especially in view adaptation to the
increasing threats posed by climate change. However, it is important to
reduce the need for subjective expert opinions in computing overall CVI
scores.

This study shows that the ranking tables generated or adapted from
databases of Pacific or Atlantic Coasts, may result in conflicting vul-
nerability results in other parts of the world. The large differences in
vulnerability categories in each variable and overall CVIs point towards
the need to develop site or region specific ranking categories. Also it
shows that the methodology which is developed for and specific region
with specific hydro-geomorphological condition is not always applic-
able to other regions.

The selected CVI ranking will be used in an ongoing project, “The
Development of a Coastal Sustainability Index Scoring Tool (CoaSST),”
as an input for the tool development process. This project has received
funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Program for
research, technological development and demonstration under grant
agreement no 606838, with additional support from IHE Delft. The
contribution of JAJ was done in the framework of the M-CostAdapt
(CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R, MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE) research project.
