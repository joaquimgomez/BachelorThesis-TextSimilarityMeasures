Abstract: The growth of marine traffic in harbors, and the subsequent increase in vessel and
propulsion system sizes, produces three linked problems at the harbor basin area: (i) higher erosion
rates damaging docking structures; (ii) sedimentation areas reducing the total depth; (iii) resuspension
of contaminated materials deposited at the seabed. The published literature demonstrates that there
are no formulations for twin stern propellers to compute the maximum scouring depth. Another
important limitation is the fact that the formulations proposed only use one type of maneuvering
during the experimental campaign, assuming that vessels are constantly being undocked. Trying
to reproduce the real arrival and departure maneuvers, 24 different tests were conducted at an
experimental laboratory in a medium-scale water tank using a twin propeller model to estimate
the consequences and the maximum scouring depth produced by stern propellers during the
backward/docking and forward/undocking scenarios. Results confirm that the combination of
backward and forward scenario differs substantially from the experiments performed so far in the
literature using only an accumulative forward scenario, yielding deeper scouring holes at the harbor
basin area. The results presented in this paper can be used as guidelines to estimate the effects of
regular vessels at their particular docking location.

1. Introduction

The significant growth experienced by regular shipping lines and the marine transportation
industry over the last 20 years is producing severe problems for old marinas designed to host
smaller vessels with lower docking frequencies. New, bigger and more powerful propulsion systems
and deeper draft vessels are needed nowadays to satisfy the demands on marine traffic. However,
this increase in propulsion system and vessel sizes is affecting the docking infrastructures and the
operability of the entire harbor. The main problem is the change in bed morphology of the harbor:
entrance channels suffer high rates of erosion and the changes on harbor basins seafloor combine
both erosion and sedimentation. A recent field study of a particular harbor basin [1], showed that the
erosion in these areas of the port can reach a depth up to the same order of magnitude as the stern
propeller‚Äôs diameter. The effects of the erosion are different depending on the location of the scouring
hole. If the erosion is located close to the toe of the docking wall it can seriously affect the stability
of the berth infrastructure. On the other hand, if the erosion is located at more central areas of the
harbor basin, a problem arises with the deposition of the eroded sediment along the harbor basin,

reducing its operability for larger draft vessels and the area has to be dredged often enough for safe
navigation (with sufficient keel clearance). Moreover, an environmental problem can also arise from
the scouring effects of stern twin propellers of the vessels, and the increase in marine traffic in ports
is also increasing the accumulation of heavy contaminants in some areas of the harbor. One of the
engineering solutions to improve the water quality of the harbor is to trap the contaminated sediment
below a layer of coarser gravel [2]. However, as reported by [3,4], the action of stern propellers over
the seafloor can negate the solution and free the contaminated sediment creating an important issue
that correlates sediment resuspension of contaminants due to the stern propellers‚Äô effects and water
quality requirements of the cruise shipping industry.

Therefore, the growth of marine traffic in harbors and its subsequent increase in vessel and
propulsion system sizes produces three linked problems at the seabed of the harbor basins: (i) higher
erosion rates damaging docking structures; (ii) sedimentation areas reducing the total depth of
the harbor basin and its operability; and (iii) resuspension of contaminated materials deposited
at the seabed.

The formulation published and used so far to investigate the erosion rates of ship‚Äôs propellers is
based on empirical equations with a dependent variable named efflux velocity, V0. Efflux velocity is
defined as the average velocity of the flux nearby a single propeller in a plane parallel to the propeller
blades. The first empirical equation for V0 was developed by [5,6], and detailed the expression for
V0 based on the application of the momentum and mass conservation equations to an ideal actuator
disk. Later, other authors proposed more complicated empirical equations based on the momentum
equation, and including the particular characteristics of propellers, such as: the number of blades,
the expanded area ratio, the propeller pitch and the hub diameter [5,7‚Äì11]. However, the former
equations were developed considering a single propeller. The guidelines published in [12] proposed
two mathematical methods to extrapolate the efflux velocity of a single propeller to twin propellers,
but [13] demonstrated that the empirical formulas to compute efflux velocity clearly overestimated the
experimental results of a twin propeller model.

The maximum erosion can be computed either (i) using the efflux velocity to obtain the bed
velocity [7,8,14] and then computing the Shields parameter; or (ii) using empirical formulas developed
in physical experiments with a single propeller model [15‚Äì22]. For the first case, ref. [13] found
that bed velocity for twin propellers was estimated properly if the formulation proposed by [8] was
used, but [13] did not compute the maximum erosion. In the second case, [1] compared the previous
formulations to a real case and concluded that all of them clearly overestimated by far the real scouring
actions, and only [17,21], using the confined propeller jet equation, yielded results close to reality,
but doubled the real maximum scouring depth. Therefore, no formulations for twin propellers are
present in the literature to compute both the efflux velocity and the maximum scouring depth. Another
important limitation is the fact that the formulations proposed only use one type of maneuvering
during the experimental campaign, assuming that vessels are constantly being undocked at the same
point, but never docked.

This paper deals with the results obtained at an experimental laboratory using a twin propeller
model to estimate the maximum scouring depth produced by stern propellers. As a novel incorporation,
and in order to compare results with the real scouring effects at harbor basin, the research includes
two different maneuvering conditions: undocking maneuvering (forward scenario) only to compare
twin results with single propeller erosion published in the literature; and, alternatively, docking and
undocking maneuvering (back and forth scenario) in the same harbor basin. The experimental setup is
described in the second section, while the results are presented in the third section and discussed in
the fourth section. The fifth section summarizes the conclusions of the research.

2. Experimental Setup

Experiments were conducted in the Marine Engineering Laboratory at the UPC-Barcelona Tech
University in a medium-scale water tank named LaBassa [13]. Figure 1 presents a sketch of the tank,

propeller and the sediment bed, Xw is the distance between the propeller plane and the front wall,
and ap is the distance between the center of the two propellers.

propeller and the sediment bed, ùëã  is the distance between the propeller plane and the front wall, 
and ùëé  is the distance between the center of the two propellers. 

Initially, the experiment was designed to scale a real Ro-Ro vessel with a daily docking 
frequency at a particular harbor basin. The scaling factor was set to 1/25 using the Froude number to 
scale dynamic effects, but including the Reynolds self-similarity criteria found in [23,24] to assure a 
turbulent flow beyond the propellers and neglect the viscous effects. Twin 4-blade inward rotating 
propellers with a pitch ratio of 0.9 and an expanded area ratio of 0.75 were used. The diameter of the 
propellers was 0.25 m and the distance between propellers was 0.6 m. The total duration of a single 
test was 30 min, scanning the bed sediment evolution at 5 min intervals.

A total of 24 different tests were obtained by combining the following variables: clearance 
distance, front wall distance, speed rotation, ùëõ, and the maneuver scenario (forward; back and forth), 
as detailed in Table 1. Forward maneuvering tests follow the sequence: (i) initialization of the 
sediment bed to a horizontal plane; (ii) 5 min run at a determined rotation speed; (iii) scanning of the 
sediment bed; (iv) repeat steps (ii)‚Äì(iii) for a total run of 30 min. Back and forth maneuvering tests 
follow the sequence from the second step: (ii) 5 min run in backward mode; (iii) scanning of the 
sediment bed; (iv) 5 min run in forward mode; (v) scanning of the sediment bed; (vi) repetition of 
second to fifth steps for a total run of 30 min.

Sediment used in the experiments was a D50 = 250 ¬µm uniform fine sand. Sediment was not scaled
from the prototype due to the limitations of finer sand in model reproductions. Two @ULTRALAB
UWS 1M Echo Sounders measured the surface of the sediment bed layer after each 5 min-run. The Echo
Sounders were hanging from a mechanized arm covering an area of 3.5 m √ó 2.8 m with blanking
distances at the edges of the tank (0.25 m front wall and 0.9 m at each lateral wall), as shown in
Figure 2. Echo Sounders were separated by 7.5 cm in the y direction, and measured at a 40 Hz sampling
frequency. Therefore, the 3D render was build up using 40 longitudinal profiles parallel to the long
edge of the LaBassa tank.

3. Results 

At each test, a scan of the measuring area yielded results like the example shown in Figure 3. 
Upper plots (Figure 3a,b) represent the situation where the propellers are closer to the sediment bed 
(ùëê , ) and to the front quay wall (ùëã = 7ùê∑ ). On the contrary, Figure 3c,d, shows the opposite 
conditions, with the propellers further from sediment bed (ùëê , ) and from the front quay wall (ùëã =10ùê∑ ). 

The scans provide visual information of the eroded and deposited areas and their morphological 
shape. Each subplot of Figure 3 indicates the existence of two eroding zones: (i) the scouring hole 
created below the propellers at the harbor basin area, HB; and (ii) the effects of the jet flow at the 
vicinity of the front wall (this is at the toe of the docking wall, DW). The former is originated by the 
direct impact of the jet flow at the sediment bed, whereas the latter is produced by the returning flow 
with a clear vertical component towards the sediment bed due to the existence of the docking wall. 
The differences between the two scouring areas were reported in [17], although they are not 
mentioned explicitly. In their communication, when the propellers are closer to the front wall (ùëã <4ùê∑ ), the scouring effects at the harbor basin are limited. However, when the distance increases (ùëã >6ùê∑ ), both effects of the propeller jet are detected. These two eroded zones are not always 
disconnected from each other and can sometimes merge, forming a unique eroded area depending 
on maneuver scenario, time evolution, and n, ùëê , and ùëã  variables, as will be further detailed in 
Section 3.1.

both effects of the propeller jet are detected. These two eroded zones are not always disconnected from

According to the results obtained from the experiments, maximum eroded depth, Œµmax, is located 
at the symmetry plane between the propellers, regardless of the engine order (ahead/forward or 
astern/backward direction). When a twin propeller model rotates inward in the ahead direction 
(forward scenario), the left-hand propeller rotates to starboard and the right hand to port, and the 
flux at the symmetry plane between propellers is towards the bed [13], increasing the action of a 
single propeller due to the sum of each propeller flow. On the contrary, if the twin propeller model 
is rotating outwards in the astern direction (backward scenario), the right hand propeller rotates to 
starboard and the left hand to port; thus, the flux at the symmetry plane is moving upwards, and the 
maximum scouring action should be concentrated below each propeller. However, Figure 4 plots an 
example of the reality when the astern telegraph order (backward) is used for the first time. The result 
extends to the rest of backward runs, where the maximum scouring depth is still found at the 
centerline. Therefore, when the flow of twin propellers reaches the sediment bed, the separated flows 
of each propeller have already been mixed with maximum velocities at the symmetry plane.

3.1. Forward Tests

In the case of forward tests, the time evolution of the longitudinal profile located at the centerline
between the propellers, plotted in Figure 5, helps to understand the merging of the eroded area at
the harbor basin and the eroded area close to the toe of the wall, outlined previously. For low-speed
revolutions (e.g., 300 rpm, Figure 5a), the scouring profile retains a clear distinction between the
two scouring areas. When the revolution speed increases, Figure 5b,c, the separation between the
zones is not maintained over time and disappears after 15‚Äì20 min of the experiment. After this stage,
the erosion at the vicinity of the docking wall dominates the profile.

scenarios. In general terms, when the propellers are closer to the sediment bed (ùëê = ùëê , black 
lines), scouring depth is almost twice as high as the results obtained with the propellers are located 
further from the bed (ùëê = ùëê , gray lines). On the other hand, the distance to the front wall does 
not seem to play an important role, since the differences between ùëã = 7ùê∑  (continuous lines) and ùëã = 10ùê∑  (dashed lines) are not significant.

The significant decrease in ŒµHBmax of T3-fwd-400 rpm, Figure 6c, is caused by the merging of the
two scouring areas already discussed at the beginning of this section. In fact, the results of maximum
scouring depth at the harbor basin, ŒµHBmax, are obtained from the centerlines plotted in Figure 5c, where
the centerline behavior changes substantially after a 15 min run (yellow line). This also occurs for
T1-fwd-400 rpm, Figure 6c, after 20 min, but at smaller magnitudes.

The differences between the revolution speeds in Figure 6 are significant at the early stages of
the tests, but become less important after a 30 min run, although maximum scouring depth is always
higher for larger values of n. A steady state is considered to be reached after 30 min, according to
the results presented in Figure 6, the results obtained using the formula proposed by [17] and the
steady-state time established by [25].

In the vicinity of the docking wall, Figure 7, the evolution of the maximum scouring depth
at the docking wall, ŒµDWmax, has a completely different behavior from the evolution of the maximum
scouring depth at the harbor basin, ŒµHBmax. The blanking area close to the wall in the present experiment
(see Figure 2) can reduce the absolute values of maximum eroded depth at the vertical wall by up to
5 cm. However, the results presented herein are used qualitatively to differentiate the two scouring
areas and obtain the orders of magnitude of the differences between the evolution of the scouring hole
produced by the direct impact of the propeller jet to the sediment bed at the harbor basin area, and the
effects of the returning flux at the toe of the docking wall. The differentiation between the two eroded
areas clearly indicates that the behavior of the erosion is different, depending on the area of study.
Moreover, in the forward scenarios, the final erosion at the vertical wall can reach higher values (in the
case of T4-fwd-400 rpm, three times larger) than the maximum erosion depth at the harbor basin area.

The significant decrease in ùúÄ  of T3-fwd-400 rpm, Figure 6c, is caused by the merging of the 
two scouring areas already discussed at the beginning of this section. In fact, the results of maximum 
scouring depth at the harbor basin, ùúÄ , are obtained from the centerlines plotted in Figure 5c, where 
the centerline behavior changes substantially after a 15 min run (yellow line). This also occurs for T1-
fwd-400 rpm, Figure 6c, after 20 min, but at smaller magnitudes. 

The differences between the revolution speeds in Figure 6 are significant at the early stages of 
the tests, but become less important after a 30 min run, although maximum scouring depth is always 
higher for larger values of n. A steady state is considered to be reached after 30 min, according to the 
results presented in Figure 6, the results obtained using the formula proposed by [17] and the steady-
state time established by [25]. 

In the vicinity of the docking wall, Figure 7, the evolution of the maximum scouring depth at the 
docking wall, ùúÄ , has a completely different behavior from the evolution of the maximum scouring 
depth at the harbor basin, ùúÄ . The blanking area close to the wall in the present experiment (see 
Figure 2) can reduce the absolute values of maximum eroded depth at the vertical wall by up to 5 cm. 
However, the results presented herein are used qualitatively to differentiate the two scouring areas 
and obtain the orders of magnitude of the differences between the evolution of the scouring hole 
produced by the direct impact of the propeller jet to the sediment bed at the harbor basin area, and 
the effects of the returning flux at the toe of the docking wall. The differentiation between the two 
eroded areas clearly indicates that the behavior of the erosion is different, depending on the area of 
study. Moreover, in the forward scenarios, the final erosion at the vertical wall can reach higher 
values (in the case of T4-fwd-400 rpm, three times larger) than the maximum erosion depth at the 
harbor basin area. 

Close to the wall, the increase of the erosion is clearly affected by the speed revolution; maximum 
eroded depth can be two or three times bigger when n increases from 300 rpm, Figure 7a, to 400 rpm, 
Figure 7c, although the erosion has apparently not reached the asymptotic state.

The maximum erosion at the toe of the vertical wall depends on the clearance distance (black

sediment bed, this is ùëê = ùëê , . Likewise, the distance between the propeller plane and the vertical 
wall also influences the final results of the maximum scouring depth at the toe of the docking wall. 
In Figure 7, when the propellers are closer to the vertical wall (ùëã = 7ùê∑  continuous lines), the 
maximum eroded depth is always higher, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Close to the wall, the increase of the erosion is clearly affected by the speed revolution; maximum
eroded depth can be two or three times bigger when n increases from 300 rpm, Figure 7a, to 400 rpm,

The maximum erosion at the toe of the vertical wall depends on the clearance distance (black and
gray lines in Figure 7), with higher values of ŒµDWmax when the propellers are further from the sediment
bed, this is ch = ch,max. Likewise, the distance between the propeller plane and the vertical wall also
influences the final results of the maximum scouring depth at the toe of the docking wall. In Figure 7,
when the propellers are closer to the vertical wall (Xw = 7Dp continuous lines), the maximum eroded
depth is always higher, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Tests shown in Figure 8 start with a horizontal sediment bed, representing a new or a recently fixed
harbor basin. Then a vessel docks at a particular quay using the astern engine telegraph order at the
end of the maneuver, in the backwards direction, Figure 8a. Then, the undocking maneuver can start,

recently fixed harbor basin. Then a vessel docks at a particular quay using the astern engine telegraph 
order at the end of the maneuver, in the backwards direction, Figure 8a. Then, the undocking 
maneuver can start, with the twin propellers working ahead, in the forward direction, Figure 8b.

In Figure 8, a sequence of the back-and-forth scenario shows the evolution of the sediment bed 
and the formation of three scouring holes: a first one located slightly upstream of the propellers (right 
side of the red line) and formed mainly during the backward runs (Figure 8a,c); a second one located 
downstream of the propellers, originated during the forward runs (Figure 8b,d) and similar to the 
main hole present in the forward scenarios; and, finally, a third one in the vicinity of the front wall, 
formed by the impact of the propeller flux at the wall during the forward runs (Figure 8b,d). The first 
two are originated by the impact of the jet flow at the sediment bed, whereas the latter is caused by 
the returning flux of the original propeller jet. When the vessel finishes the docking maneuver with 
both propellers working backward/astern, Figure 8a, the sediment erosion is located underneath, 
slightly upstream of their vertical position. Afterwards, when the undocking maneuver starts, with 
the twin propellers rotating forward/ahead, the action towards the sediment bed starts downstream 
of the propellers, as seen in Figure 8b, and the scouring hole created during the previous maneuver 
reduces its depth slightly (see Figure 9). During the next step, simulating a second docking maneuver 
consecutive with the two maneuvers previously described, Figure 8c, the scouring hole created 
downstream of the propeller decreases in depth at the same time as the main scouring hole of the 
first docking maneuver increases its size. Finally, Figure 8d shows the scan following two backward 
maneuvers and two forward maneuvers, reproduced intercalatedly and iteratively. In this plot, the 
last five minutes of the forward run have increased the downstream hole, decreased the upstream 
hole, and influenced the area close to the wall enough to create the third scouring hole in the vicinity 
of the vertical front wall. However, this influence on the vertical front wall shows up earlier if the 
centerline longitudinal profiles are plotted, see Figure 9. The light purple line in Figure 9 is the first 
erosion profile produced after a 5 min run in astern engine order mode, and the scouring action is 
concentrated upstream the vertical location of the propellers, whereas the accretion is located both 
upstream and downstream. However, after a 5 min run in the forward direction (dark purple lines 
in Figure 9), the scouring action slightly increases the depth of the main scouring hole and, at the 
same time, reduces the accretion downstream of the propellers, starting a new scouring hole at this 
particular point, and also starts acting near the vertical wall.

formed by the impact of the propeller flux at the wall during the forward runs (Figure 8b,d). The first

returning flux of the original propeller jet. When the vessel finishes the docking maneuver with both
propellers working backward/astern, Figure 8a, the sediment erosion is located underneath, slightly
upstream of their vertical position. Afterwards, when the undocking maneuver starts, with the twin
propellers rotating forward/ahead, the action towards the sediment bed starts downstream of the
propellers, as seen in Figure 8b, and the scouring hole created during the previous maneuver reduces its
depth slightly (see Figure 9). During the next step, simulating a second docking maneuver consecutive

The behavior of ahead and astern direction combining back and forth maneuvering yields 
interesting results in terms of evolution and maximum scouring depth magnitudes. In Figure 10, 
when the speed revolution increases, the effects on the sediment bed are more significant, yielding 
deeper scouring holes at the harbor basin area that are more significant than in the experiments using

4. Discussion 

The jet flow originated by stern propellers causes severe damage to the toes of the docking 
structures during approximation and departure maneuvers. However, the evolution of the maneuver 
along the harbor basin also affects its sediment bed throughout the entire maneuver, producing 
scouring holes and the motion of eroded sediment. This latter effect has no influence on the stability 
of harbor structures, but the deposition of the scoured material at other areas of the harbor basin 
reduces the operability of the basin itself. At the same time, as described in the Introduction section, 
the effects of the stern propellers during harbor maneuvers can affect particular bed protections 
designed to trap contaminated sediment below them. 

The study of the maximum eroded depth produced by the stern propeller jet flow in different 
scenarios has led to the definition of the jet itself. In particular, the focus of this study has tried to 
reproduce the consequences of this jet flow with the influence of a vertical wall simulating the 
berthing infrastructures during docking and undocking maneuvers. It is important to outline that the 
width and length of the LaBassa tank were large enough to avoid the influence of the lateral walls 
and the opposite vertical wall, as concluded by [13]. Moreover, the experimental facility only allowed 
a fixed configuration with respect to the vertical wall and the sediment bed. However, given the 
former limitations of the experimental facility, the results presented throughout the document can be 
used as guidelines to estimate the effects of regular vessels at their particular docking location. 

According to the sediment bed 3D scans obtained using 24 different configurations of the 
location and speed revolution of the propellers during both docking and undocking maneuvers close 
to a vertical wall, the vessel produces two different erosion areas: (i) nearby the propellers, that is, at 
the harbor basin area; and (ii) at the toe of the vertical wall. Each scouring hole is caused by the jet

Figure 11 confirms the information outlined in Figure 9 regarding the influence of the forward
runs on the erosion at the toe of the vertical wall. Thus, ŒµDWmax in Figure 11 starts increasing only when
the propellers are working ahead/forward for the first time, at t = 10 min, showing that it already
influences this area of the sediment bed. Moreover, astern/backward runs (t = 5(2n + 1), n = 0, 1, 2)
do not have any influence on the erosion at the toe of the vertical wall, since ŒµDWmax does not deviate
from the value of the previous run.

According to the sediment bed 3D scans obtained using 24 different configurations of the location
and speed revolution of the propellers during both docking and undocking maneuvers close to a
vertical wall, the vessel produces two different erosion areas: (i) nearby the propellers, that is, at the
harbor basin area; and (ii) at the toe of the vertical wall. Each scouring hole is caused by the jet flow of
the propellers and its interaction with the horizontal (seafloor) and vertical (berthing wall) limits of
the basin.

The scouring hole at the harbor basin is originated by the impact of the jet flow with the
bed sediment, regardless of the engine telegraph order under which the propellers are running
(ahead/forward or astern/backward). Ref. [26] defines the expansion angle as the angle between the
impact point of the exterior jet flow and the sediment bed. If the clearance distance is of the order
of 20 cm, the expansion angle can be from 13‚ó¶ to 20‚ó¶, which, in the present experiments, should
be a distance of between 70 and 112 cm. However, according to the results obtained, the impact
distance from the propeller plane to the maximum erosion depth in the harbor basin is around 70
cm in T1-fwd and below 70 cm in T2-fwd. When the propellers are rotating astern, the distance is
reduced substantially to down to 30 cm. In the case of ch,max, according to [26], the expansion angle
should reduce to 10‚ó¶ and, therefore, the jet may impact 230 cm downstream of the propeller plane.
In the present experiments, the jet impacted the sediment bed at a distance of around 100 cm. These
differences from the results presented by [26] are mainly due to the influence of the vertical wall,
particularly when the clearance distance is larger.

The results of maximum scouring depth at the harbor basin depend on the successive engine
telegraph orders in which the propellers are rotating. When the experiments are performed using only
the forward direction, the maximum erosion depth depends mainly on the speed rotation and the
clearance distance, with a slight influence on the distance between the stern propeller plane and the
vertical wall. Moreover, at large values of speed rotation, the scouring hole at the harbor basin merges
with the scouring hole at the toe of the vertical wall when the propellers are in the closer position
with respect to this vertical wall. If the scenario combining back-and-forth tests is used, the maximum
eroded depth only changes with the rotation speed, see Figure 10, with no influence on the clearance
distance and the distance to the vertical wall. This combination of engine telegraph order yields
interesting results in terms of the formation of the scouring holes. The experiments were performed
starting with astern/backward engine telegraph orders, and the first scouring hole at the harbor
basin was formed upstream the propellers, at a shorter distance from them. The depth of this hole,
Figure 10, is almost twice as large as the depth of the first five minute run in the ahead/forward engine
telegraph order, as shown in Figure 6. Actually, the depth of the scouring hole obtained at the end of
the experiments is significantly larger when the two telegraph orders (ahead/astern) are combined.
When [1] computed the maximum eroded depth using the formulas presented in the literature, they
concluded that only two equations, [17,21], yielded feasible results, although they were twice the real
value. The formulas were presented after experimental work using either a single propeller in forward
continuous mode or a simple jet impacting a sediment bed, respectively. The final results of maximum
scouring depth when back-and-forth combinations are used are not twice the final scouring depth
using only ahead/forward engine telegraph order, if we compare Figures 6 and 10, although they are
still higher. Therefore, the previous equations should still be used, bearing in mind that they clearly
overestimate the maximum eroded depth.

The scouring hole at the toe of the vertical wall is caused by the returning flux of the propellers.
The vertical component of the flux at the wall erodes the area at the intersection between the vertical
wall and the sediment bed. In some particular cases of the only forward scenarios, Figure 7, for low
speed revolution, the initial stages of the sediment bed evolution cloase to the toe of the wall present a
small sedimentation. This is an apparent sedimentation produced by the lack of data at areas close to
the vertical wall due to the blank measuring area, 25 cm, as seen in Figure 2. Thus, small erosion at the
toe of the wall shall be expected.

The results indicate that the influence of the revolution speed is the most important in the erosion
phenomenon close to the toe of the wall, rather than other variables, regardless of the direction of
propeller rotation in which the experiments were performed. In general terms, maximum values
of Œµmax are obtained for minimum values of Xw, as expected, since the jet is more energetic when it
impacts the wall, and thus the returning flux has a higher velocity. Surprisingly, this is not the case for
minimum values of the clearance distance ch; according to Figures 7 and 11, the scouring holes at the
toe of the vertical wall are deeper when the propellers are further from the sediment bed (gray lines).
This can be explained by the variation in the impact angle; the impact angle decreases for larger values
of ch, and the distance at which the jet impacts the sediment bed increases, being closer to the vertical
wall. Therefore, the loss of momentum due to the impact of the sediment bed is produced at areas
closer to the vertical wall, and the flux velocities reaching the wall are higher. The results obtained
from the equation proposed by [17] for the maximum scouring depth in the presence of a vertical
wall estimate a maximum erosion for ch,min of between 15 and 25 cm, which is congruent with the
results obtained for maximum scouring depth in the harbor basin (see Figure 6), but underestimates
the erosion at the toe of the vertical wall (see Figure 7). Moreover, maximum scouring depth in the
vicinity of the docking wall did not reach the steady state during the presented experiments, meaning
that the maximum erosion depth should be expected to be larger than the present results. In the case of
ch,max, the equation proposed by [17] yields results for maximum erosion depth of 25 to 35 cm, higher
than Œµmax for ch,min, which are only valid for the results obtained at the docking wall, although they
overestimate the minimum values (see Figure 7).

In the scenario combining back-and-forth tests, the erosion at the toe of the wall starts only when
the ahead/forward engine telegraph order is run, which is at 10 min. The astern/backward engine
telegraph order, and therefore the docking maneuver, does not have any impact on the erosion close to
the vertical wall, Figure 11. However, the erosion in this area is not exactly equal to the accretion of the
harbor basin scoured hole in Figure 10. In fact, the erosion produced by the ahead/forward engine
telegraph orders is larger than the sedimentation occurred at the scouring hole of the harbor basin,
indicating that other accretion areas are produced when the propellers rotate inwards.

5. Conclusions

The analysis of experimental work performed to estimate the scouring effects produced by stern
propellers during docking and undocking maneuvers has pointed out the need to include the effects
of twin propeller configurations and propeller rotation direction. The present contribution introduced
the use of twin propeller experimental results and the description of the consequences and erosion
evolution of the sediment bed when incorporating back-and-forth scenarios.

During docking and undocking maneuvers, the effects of stern propellers can be divided into
two different actions: (i) the impact of the propeller flow on the sediment bed, producing important
scouring holes at the harbor basin area; and (ii) the impact of the propeller flow on the docking wall,
and its subsequent returning flux, eroding the toe of the vertical wall.

The use of a continuous ahead/forward scenario in the experiments presented in the literature
underestimates the maximum erosion depth at the harbor basin, and overestimates the effects at the
toe of the wall. This is due to the importance that the forward scenario has with regard to erosion
rates, since the backward scenario creates deeper scouring holes than the forward rotating direction
using the same revolution speed. However, the present experiments did not reach the asymptotic
state, and the erosion at the toe of the vertical wall in the back-and-forth scenarios should continue
increasing, reaching the maximum values of the continuous forward scenarios.

The variables used in the present experiments also play an important role when comparing the
continuous-forward scenarios and the back-and-forth scenarios. Apparently, neither the clearance
distance nor the distance to the vertical wall seem to influence the maximum eroded depth at the
harbor basin for back-and-forth scenarios, although they are important in the erosion at the toe of
the docking wall. As expected, when the propellers are closer to the vertical wall, the effects on the



Water 2018, 10, 1571 13 of 14

maximum eroded depth are more significant. On the contrary, further distances to the sediment bed
produce deeper scouring holes at the toe. This indicates that and increase in draft particulars may not
increase the final erosion depth, but further research is needed along these lines.

The results presented in this contribution highlight the need to further investigate the
consequences of stern propellers on seafloors. The increase in the problems produced by docking
vessels in several harbors requires the existence of a tool available to harbor authorities to predict
scouring processes and prevent them. More experimental and field data is needed in order to better
predict both the potential erosion and sedimentation at the harbor basin.
