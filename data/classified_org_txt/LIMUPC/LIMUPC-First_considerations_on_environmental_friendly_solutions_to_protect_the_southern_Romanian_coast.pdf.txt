1. INTRODUCTION 

Many of the coastal defense structures, such as groynes, 
seawalls and detached breakwaters, along the Southern Ro-
manian coast are in poor condition, as they are approaching 
or have already exceeded their lifetime. For this reason, in 
many places, the effectiveness of the coastal structures for 
controlling beach erosion and protecting the coast is signifi-
cantly reduced. Therefore, the need for major capital works to 
improve or replace the damaged structures becomes critical 
(Halcrow UK et al., 2011-2012). 

New approaches concerning green solutions for coastal 
protection have been developed in recent years, to be more 
sustainable with the climate change scenarios. Apart from 
the existing hard structures, green measures are also taken 

into account for coastal protection against the increasing 
intensity of storms, where appropriate (Borsje et al, 2011; 
Narayan et al., 2016; Pontee et al., 2016).

In recent years, around the world, there is interest in sea-
grass as a green measure (Ondiviela et al., 2014; Sierra et al., 
2017), mostly as it is considered as an appropriate habitat for 
some species. It is also considered as an indicator of the qual-
ity of the marine environment (Marin et al., 2013). Neverthe-
less, the efficiency of wave height reduction in the case of a 
green solution, based on numerical modelling, has not been 
assessed for the Romanian coast so far.  

Available information on the Southern Romanian coast 
mentions the presence of seagrass in the area of Mangalia 
city (Marin et al., 2013; Niţă et al., 2014). Our study focuses

Abstract. The aim of this work is to assess the effect of a nature-based solution for reducing wave heights on the Southern Romanian coast. Apart from 
investigating the presence of seagrass from the environmental point of view, there is also a need to assess its impact on the coastal hydrodynamics. The 
impact on the wave heights of a seagrass meadow located on the Southern Romanian coast, has been analyzed by means of a wave model. In this purpose, 
several numerical simulations have been performed, both for low and average offshore wave conditions, available from a previous wave climate study, 
which used a 30 years climate data set. A first set of simulations have been performed in the absence of seagrass. Then a seagrass meadow has been added 
to our grid and the wave model has been run in the same offshore wave conditions. The differences in computed nearshore wave heights reach around 4% 
for moderate energy waves. These results show that, on the Southern Romanian coast, seagrass could be regarded as an additional measure for nearshore 
wave attenuation.

on a specific area on the Southern Romanian coast, located 
north of Mangalia city, between the Venus and Saturn resorts. 
This area has been chosen as there are no coastal structures.

The main purpose of this study is to analyze the impact 
of a seagrass meadow on the wave heights, by means of a 
wave model. The wave model was first run in the absence of a 
seagrass meadow, for low and average wave conditions. Then 
we added a seagrass meadow and ran the model again, for 
the same wave conditions. Finally, the results were compared 
in order to assess the efficiency of the seagrass meadow on 
wave attenuation. Differences in wave heights reach around 
4% for moderate energy waves. This suggests that, even if 
specific vegetation is considered an indicator of a good quali-
ty of the marine environment, in what concerns wave attenu-
ation it could be seen only as an additional measure.

2. METHODOLOGY 

2.1. Specific vegetation 

Zostera noltei (Dwarf Eelgrass) is a widely studied sea-
grass catalogued by the IUCN Red List as a Least Concern in 
the Threatened Species scale. All the specifications of the sea-
grass can be found in Short et al., 2010, as well as a distribu-
tion map, showing that this species is present on most of the 
Western Europe coasts, on the western half of the Mediter-
ranean, and on the whole Black Sea and Caspian Sea coasts. 

Our main interest is to assess the effect of a Zostera noltei 
meadow on the waves on a specific area of the Southern Ro-
manian coast. There are studies about the transplantation of 

the Zostera noltei as its population is considered in decrease 
in the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas (Short et al., 2010; Marin 
et al., 2013).

Our study relies on the work of Niță et al., 2014, who dis-
cuss the possibility for transplantation of these species in the 
coastal area close to Mangalia city, in order to regenerate the 
specific submerged vegetation along the Romanian coast. 
Moreover, in this scientific publication, creation of “nurseries” 
is discussed, in order to grow this specimen in controlled eco-
systems to later transplant them on desired locations.

In 1982, Fonseca et al., 1982 published an observational 
study on the influence of seagrass on current flow, followed 
by Fonseca and Cahalan, 1992, where various types of sea-
grass and salt marshes were tested in a wave tank. The damp-
ing effect of seagrass has been demonstrated, being compa-
rable to the effect of salt marshes when water depth is scaled 
to plant size. The same statement can be found in Blackmar 
et al., 2013 and Christianen et al., 2013. In more recent stud-
ies (Manca et al., 2012; Koftis et al., 2013), Posidonia oceanica 
(or Mediterranean tapeweed), which is a seagrass endemic of 
the Mediterranean Sea, has been used.

In 1993, Kobayashi et al., 1993 went one step above, ana-
lyzing this effect using the continuity and linearized equa-
tions and comparing them with experimental tests runs. 
Möller et al., 1999 introduced the numerical modelling on the 
damping effect of seagrass, and also suggested the necessity 
of maintaining or even growing salt marshes as part of coast-
al set-back or shoreline realignment schemes.

Möller, 2006 shows that wave attenuation due to vege-
tation goes up to a threshold value. As a consequence, the 
damping effect does not keep up for high wave heights val-
ues that can occur in some storm events. But this is not really 
well understood, as stated by Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; 
Bouma et al., 2014. There is strong indication of vegetation 
causing considerable wave attenuation, even when water 
levels and waves are higher than the average, but these can 
flatten and break vegetation stems, and thereby reduce dissi-
pation (Möller et al., 2014) so it is not the optimal situation. It 
is a combined effect of stems bending and breaking progres-
sively, which reduces wave attenuation, but at the same time 
it still attenuates as the vegetation is lower, but denser.

Ondivela et al., 2014 have searched in submerged veg-
etation a possible solution to mitigate the future changing 
climate effects to the coast, concluding that seagrass mead-
ows cannot protect shorelines in every scenario and finding 
optimal conditions in shallow waters and low wave energy 
environments. Sierra et al., 2017 have analyzed the efficiency 
of seagrass meadow to attenuate the impact of Sea Level Rise 
on breakwater overtopping, through numerical modelling, in 
two harbours on the Catalan coast. Their results indicate that 
the presence of seagrass may compensate overtopping in-
creases for moderate values of Sea Level Rise, for a high den-
sity of 100 stems/m2.

2.2. Wave Climate 

The Wave Climate data used is from the European Centre 
for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis of 
38 years wave data (Onea and Rusu, 2017). 

Lin-Ye et al., 2018 produced a hindcast and forecast of this 
data set, using SWAN (Booij et al., 1999) and a generalized 
additive model. In this work, the SWAN outputs have been 

validated against the ERA-interim reanalysis model available 
for the northwestern Black Sea, for the period 1979 – 2016. 
This study focused on the northwestern part of the Black Sea, 
spanning along a part of the Ukrainian coast, the Danube 
delta coast, and a part of the Romanian coast south of the 
Danube delta, the southern limit being close to the Eforie re-
sort. The data set used in our study is from the southernmost 
point available from this work, which is the closest one to the 
Southern Romanian coast. 

The Wave Climate data set is more than a hundred years, due 
to the reanalysis with hindcast and forecast performed. The data 
corresponding only to 30 years (1988-2018) have been used in 
order to derive the average waves to be used as input for our 
SWAN simulations. This decision has been taken mainly for ca-
pacity reasons, but also because the precision of the Wave Cli-
mate derived for this period is considered more than enough.

The waves that would not reach the coast have been 
eliminated from the data set. So the remaining directions are 
from 11.25 º to 191.25 º, covering the NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, 
SSE, and S directions. Figure 2 shows the wave roses for the 
significant wave heights and associated wave periods corre-
sponding to these directions.

The next step to perform is to calculate the Hmorf, that syn-
thesizes the wave information, in order to represent an average 
surge, as the extremal scenarios (or storms) are not of our interest. 

The Hmorf is defined as:

,

where i is the number of a registered wave height between 
certain limits, Hi is the wave height and fi is its rate of occur-
rence.

Details concerning the calculation of Hmorf can be found 
in Monclús i Bori, 2018.

A low and a moderate wave energy spectrum have been 
selected for our analysis, the one with wave periods between 
4 and 6 s (average 5 s), and the one with wave periods be-
tween 8 and 10 s (average 9 s). Very low periods and wave 
heights are not a concern for the coast.

As the intention was to evaluate the feasibility of the sub-
merged vegetation as a green coastal protection measure, 
three wave directions have been selected for our analysis: NE, 
E, SSE.  

The highest wave height is for NE direction, for the wave 
period of 9 s. The lowest wave height is for the E direction, for 
the average wave period of 5 s. The SSE direction is a mod-
erate one, with a high Hmorf for the average wave period of 5 
s, and a low Hmorf for the average wave period of 9 s. Table 1 
summarizes the Hmorf values for the analyzed directions.

Table 1. Hmorf for the average wave periods of 5 s and 9 s for the 
analyzed directions

Wave Direction Hmorf (m) Average Wave Period T (s)

NE 1.15 5 

NE 3.43  9 

E 0.85  5 

E 2.33  9 

SSE 1.21  5 

SSE 1.63  9 

2.3. Bathymetry data and grids

The bathymetry data (Fig. 3) for this study have been 
collected from electronic navigational charts (www.navion-

ics.com). The bathymetry data used herein goes until 50 m 
depth, on a 28 km wide alongshore strip. 

Nesting was used in order to avoid high computational 
cost. Therefore, two domains with different extents and res-
olutions, have been defined. The larger domain is denoted 
as DOM1, while the smaller one, which includes the seagrass 
field, is finer and denoted as DOM2 (Fig. 4). 

The grids have been generated using the Kriging meth-
od. Both domains consist in regular meshes with equal grid 
spacing in the x and y directions. The spacing is 80 m in DOM1 
and 15 m in DOM2. DOM1 covers 476 km2 and goes rough-
ly until 50 m deep. DOM2 covers around 49 km2 and goes 
roughly until 35 m deep.

2.4. The SWAN model 

The SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) model (Boo-
ij et al., 1999; The SWAN Team, 2018) is a third generation, 
phase-averaged, open source numerical model based on the 
so called “action-balance equation”. 

The SWAN theory is based on two main concepts:
1.  the random-phase/amplitude model, which describes 

the wave propagation based on statistics obtained 
through observations and, in our case, observations plus 
hindcast; 

2.  the linear wave theory, also called Airy wave theory (Airy, 
1841), describing the generation, propagation and dissi-
pation of the waves. 

The spectral energy balance equation, which describes 
the evolution of the energy density spectrum, is the conse-
quence of the combination of these two concepts. 

The spectral energy balance models can be extended to 
shallow water implementing some corrections to account 
for those phenomena that occur when waves approach the

coastline (refraction, shoaling, diffraction), achieving quite 
good estimations of the significant wave height, period and 
mean wave direction (Holthuijsen, 2007).

Some references of publications that use SWAN and are 
related to our study are Blackmar et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 
2012; Sierra et al., 2017; Lin-Ye et al., 2018.

2.5. The Vegetation model

This area, of approximately 1 km2, has been defined 
taking into account the Zostera noltei limitations and the 
bathymetry of the coastal zone between Venus and Saturn 
(Fig. 5). The vegetation is a limitation due to its minimum and 
maximum deep where it can live. As stated by Short et al., 
2010, the Zostera noltei species range is from 1 to 10 m deep. 
In a previous study on Zostera noltei species on the Southern 
Romanian coast, the maximum depth is considered 6 m (Niță 
et al., 2014). 

In our model the vegetation meadow has been placed 
starting with 2 m deep, to avoid disturbing swimmers and 
tourists, and extends up to 6 m deep (Fig. 5).

The plant height and section area values are extracted 
from Short et al., 2010 and Niță et al., 2014. Similar studies 
(Fonseca and Cahalan, 1992; Kobayashi et al., 1993; Koftis et 
al., 2013; and Castell, 2018) have determined a commonly ac-
cepted range of density between 50 and 100 stems/m2. 

In our case the density of 100 stems/m2 is chosen, as 
this place is catalogued as very suitable for Zostera noltei to 
develop (Niţă et al., 2014). However, a higher density value 
didn’t seem reasonable for this location.

Fig. 5. Position of the vegetation meadow

The stem height was considered 20 cm in all the simu-
lations, corresponding to a good development of this spe-
cies. According to Surugiu, 2008, Zostera noltei may reach no 
more than 20 cm. 

Finally the drag coefficient has been calculated following 
Myrhaug and Holmedal, 2011. Its value is 0.095.

2.6. Simulations – actual wave conditions and 
with vegetation mask

For our analysis, the actual state of the wave propagation 
from deep waters to shallow waters was first taken into ac-
count. Then it was compared to the new state of the wave 
propagation, with the vegetation meadow. Therefore, a Base-
line Scenario and a Vegetation Scenario have been devel-
oped for each direction analyzed. 

The Baseline Scenarios of wave propagation have been 
conducted in our first domain (DOM1) with the correspond-

ing boundary conditions. Then, for every analyzed direction, 
the computed data were stored in points that surround the 
second domain (DOM2).

The stored data are used as the new boundary conditions 
both for the Baseline Scenario and the Vegetation Scenario 
in DOM2. 

A total number of 18 simulations have been performed. 
For every direction and level of energy (Hmorf value), a first 
simulation has been performed on DOM1, then a second sim-
ulation in DOM2, and later, a simulation with vegetation mask 
in DOM2. 

Figure 6 illustrates the scenarios and the nesting per-
formed for our analysis. 

Finally, for every direction, the results for the Baseline 
and the Vegetation Scenarios were compared using a MAT-
LAB script. The maximum attenuation was reported as the 
highest difference between the Baseline and the Vegetation 
significant heights in all the points of the grid. For the aver-
age attenuation, all the points with non-zero difference have 
been used. The maximum and average attenuation have also 
been determined as percentages with respect to the Baseline 
significant height in every point of the grid.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The SWAN output has been plotted using a MATLAB 

script. 

The following figures show the spatial distribution of the 

wave heights provided by SWAN, in the DOM1 and DOM2 

domains, in the absence of the seagrass meadow, as well as 

the distribution of the wave height difference, for all the wave 

forcings considered. The horizontal and vertical coordinates, 

as well as the color scales, are in meters. The bathymetry lines 

(m) are also reported on the figures.

3.1. NE waves 

The results for the NE low energy waves are illustrated in 

figures 7 and 8. The results for the NE moderate energy waves 

are illustrated in figures 9 and 10.   

3.2. E waves 

The results for the E low energy waves are illustrated 
in figures 11 and 12. The results for the E moderate energy 
waves are illustrated in figures 13 and 14.   

3.3. SSE waves 

The results for the SSE low energy waves are illustrated 
in figures 15 and 16. The results for the SSE moderate energy 
waves are illustrated in figures 17 and 18.   

For all the three directions, one can notice an increase of 
the wave height difference for the moderate energy waves 
(Figs. 8 vs. 10, 12 vs 14, 16 vs 18). 

Table 2 shows the maximum and average attenuation de-
termined for every direction and level of energy considered 
in our analysis.

Following their experiments, Koftis et al., 2013 stated that 
wave attenuation increases with the wave period. This is the

reason that, in the case of moderate energy waves, hence 
with higher wave periods, the attenuation is higher. The same 
result is reached in our case.

To sum up, these numbers indicate a 4 to 8.1 % reduction 
of the wave height due to the seagrass meadow for moder-
ate energy waves cases, in all the considered directions, and 
a reduction of 2.1 to 3.5 % for the low energy ones. Overall, 
for all the analyzed directions, we can consider an average 
reduction of 4.4 % for the moderate energy waves, and of 2.4 
% for the low energy ones.

The maximum attenuation shows the lowest value (6.4 %) 
for the moderate waves from NE, that have the highest signif-
icant wave height. Waves from NE are almost parallel to the 
breakwater located north of our study area (Fig. 3), so attenu-
ation occurs mainly through the seagrass meadow. 

The highest value of the maximum attenuation (8.1 %) 
occurs for the moderate waves from E. These waves have the 
shortest distance to travel through the seagrass meadow. But 
the bathymetry shows an elevated zone, of depths between 
3.4 and 5 m, while the surrounding depths are between 7 and 
10 m (Fig. 3). This elevated zone is included in DOM2. The off-
shore E waves travelling towards the coast reach this elevated 
zone, which is an obstacle leading to attenuation. 

The moderate waves from SSE also show slightly higher 
attenuation (7.7 %), as they have the longest distance to trav-
el through the vegetation meadow. 

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Specific submerged vegetation, such as Zostera noltei, 
can help in slight reduction of the wave height in the coastal 
zone between the Venus and Saturn resorts. 

An improvement of this result could be achieved with 
higher stem height and a larger field, but the Zostera noltei 
proposed for this project is limited to the conditions used. 

Taller seagrass could provide an improvement to the results, 
but there is no information on such seagrass native from this 
coast. Using other species does not appear to be an option, as 
we don’t know if they can adapt and develop. 

From the numerical point of view, the detail of the models 
meshes could be improved, even adding more nesting steps. 
A 30 years span of data have been used for the Wave Climate, 
enough to calculate an accurate approximation at this stage 
of the study. Taking into account that the available forecast 
and hindcast cover more than a hundred years, there is room 
for improvement. Thus, the detail of the work could lead to 
a more extended and accurate approximation of the reality.

Overall, assessing the effect of a Zostera noltei meadow 
on the wave heights in our chosen study area opens a subject 
of interest for the Southern Romanian coast, mostly because 
the presence of this species is associated to a good ecological 
state.

Our results show that, from the hydrodynamic point of 
view, seagrass could be taken into account as an additional 
coastal protection measure.
