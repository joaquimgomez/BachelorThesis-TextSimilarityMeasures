Abstract

This paper deals with the limits in hydrodynamic and morphodynamic predictions for
semi-enclosed coastal domains subject to sharp gradients (in bathymetry, topography,
sediment transport and coastal damages). It starts with an overview of wave prediction
limits (based on satellite images) in a restricted domain such as is the Mediterranean5
basin, followed by an in-depth analysis of the Catalan coast, one of the land boundaries
of such a domain. The morphodynamic modeling for such gradient regions is next
illustrated with the simulation of the largest recorded storm in the Catalan coast, whose
morphological impact is a key element of the storm impact. The driving wave and
surge conditions produce a morphodynamic response that is validated against the pre10
and post storm beach state, recovered from two LIDAR images. The quality of the fit
is discussed in terms of the physical processes and the suitability of the employed
modeling equations. Some remarks about the role of the numerical discretization and
boundary conditions are also included in the analysis. From here an assessment of
errors and uncertainties is presented, with the aim of establishing the prediction limits15
for coastal engineering flooding and erosion analyses.

1 Introduction

Coastal regions are often characterized by sharp gradients in meteo-oceanographic
drivers, sedimentary fluxes and socio-economic pressures. This happens under
present climate conditions and is also expected to occur under the projections for future20
scenarios, which makes such coastal areas a challenging test case for predictions and
projections alike. Our study case is the Catalan coast in the North-western Mediter-
ranean (Fig. 1). This region is characterized by a complex coastal orography with the
Pyrenees to the North as the main orographic feature running in an East–West di-
rection. It is conditioned by the opening between the Pyrenees and the Alps which25
corresponds to the Southern France area, including the Rhone valley. It also presents

several abrupt mountain ranges parallel to the coast in a Northeast–Southwest direc-
tion. The continental shelf is characterized by a narrow width which in front of Tarrag-
ona’s harbour (the second in importance for the Catalan coast) means that the 600 m
isobath its only 60 km offshore. This also affects the distribution of population and in-
dustries, where the location of the main rivers exerts an important control. The corre-5
sponding river deltas are also associated with a widening in continental shelf width and
milder slopes, more clear for the larger of rivers (e.g. the Ebre) where the submerged
pro-delta and emerged delta constitute one of the main sediment and environmental
reservoirs of this coastal stretch.

During regional Northern wind events the orography favours wind channelling down10
the river valleys and through the “breaches” in the coastal mountain range, which leads
to jet-like wind patterns over the coastal area with a Northwest direction. These land to
sea winds from the Northwest (Mestral in the local vernacular) are particularly intense
and persistent, especially during the fall and winter seasons. In winter and early spring
the eastern wind fields present the highest wind speeds and the longest fetch, resulting15
in the largest waves acting on this coast associated to low pressure centres over the
western Mediterranean, which often spend several days recirculating in this part of
the basin and therefore generating wave storms with more than one peak. This turns
out to be an effective mechanism for producing erosion, flooding and various types of
damages along the coast.20

The directional distribution of waves show, in accordance with the presented wind
features, a predominance of Northwest and Eastern wave conditions, with some South-
ern wave systems. Double peaked (bi-modal) wave spectra are often observed under
strong local Northwestern winds combined with offshore easterly or southerly winds in
the offshore areas (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2008). This applies particularly to river val-25
leys such as the Ebro delta region, where these bi-modal spectra can occur more than
50% cof the time (Bolaños et al., 2009), with implications for the prediction of sediment
transport and morphodynamic evolution.

The general circulation pattern in this area follows the Northern or Ligurian current
flowing from Southern France towards the central Spanish Mediterranean coast. It is
characterized by average speeds around 10 cmseg−1, although presenting winter in-
tensifications up to 50 cmseg−1. Some pulsating events and mesoscale eddies may
lead to higher current velocities that in all cases are seldom strong enough near the5
coast to transport sediment particles that are, from the circulation perspective, stable
at the coastal zone. Mean water levels in the area are dominated by storm surges
which may reach up to 50 cm (Conte and Lionello, 2013). The astronomical tidal range,
between 10 and 30 cm is quantitatively less important, making the area a micro-tidal
environment.10

This average Southwest flowing current is super imposed on near inertial motions,
linked to small sized meteo events which dominate the fluctuations over shelf regions
(Rippeth et al., 2002). The flow is mostly topographically steered, including the effect of
the shoreline boundary (Grifoll et al., 2012). Near the coast the mean flow is Southwest
wards also, but with reversals throughout the year, particularly under high energetic15
events mainly from the East and Northeast sectors.

In this type of coastal domains, the sharp gradients (due to the topographic and
bathymetric features) in the spatial patterns of wind, wave and circulation fields impose
a tough challenge for numerical simulations. It requires using a mesh discretization fine
enough to be able to solve these spatial variations, without introducing numerical errors20
or diffusivity that degrades the quality of the calculated results.

To prove this point, the paper will start by presenting wave simulations, the nest-
ing strategy and how the computational results have been calibrated with available
observations. This allows establishing some performance limits for the hydrodynamic
variables (Sect. 2). The paper continues with a description of a significant storm (in25
hydrodynamic and morphodynamic terms) that has recently affected the Catalan coast
and for which there are some observations available (Sect. 3). We shall present hydro-
dynamic results from deep water down to the surf zone and assess the resulting errors,
linking them to the controlling physical processes.

It follows an analysis of the morphodynamic simulations performed, presenting the
morphodynamic modelling suite and how it can provide erosion and flooding results
based on the driving hydrodynamics for the selected storm (Sect. 4). This is the basis to
calculate the errors between observations and simulations for hydrodynamic variables
and the uncertainties we find when obtaining morphodynamic predictions (Sect. 5).5
After this there is a discussion session on the limits of hydro-morphodynamic predic-
tions and the implications for engineering design and management decisions (Sect. 6),
followed by some conclusions (Sect. 7).

2 Hydrodynamic modelling. Waves, currents and mean sea level

The wave code selected is the third-generation model SWAN (Simulating Waves10
Nearshore), which is based on a finite differences discretization of the wave action
balance equation (Booij et al., 1999). It incorporates wind wave growth, quadruplet
and triad wave-wave interactions plus depth-induced breaking. In this paper, the se-
lected physics consist of exponential wind wave growth computed by means of the
Janssen (1991) formulation. Non-linear wave interactions are parametrized through15
the DIA scheme (Hasselmann et al., 1985) and the LTA method (Eldeberky, 1996) at
deep and shallow waters, respectively. Regarding sink terms, whitecapping dissipa-
tion corresponds to the Komen et al. (1984) formula and bottom friction dissipation is
derived from the JONSWAP results (Hasselmann et al., 1973). Finally, depth-induced
breaking is triggered through the Battjes and Janssen (1978) bore-based model.20

Calculations are performed through a set of three nested domains that cover the
Mediterranean Sea. The first one is the Mediterranean sea grid which has a resolution
of 10km×10 km (0.09◦×0.09◦), comprising from −6◦ to 36.93◦ longitude and from 30◦
to 45.93◦ latitude (178×478 mesh grid). The second one is the Catalan sea domain,
with a 2.778km×2.778 km (0.025◦ ×0.025◦) grid size, comprising from −0.5◦ to 4.0◦25
longitude and from 33.5◦ to 38.5◦ latitude (200×180 mesh grid). The last one is a 1km×
1 km grid that represents the coastal/shelf domain of the Catalan sea, with a coastal

boundary on the North-western side and three open boundaries at the North, South
and East of the domain. In all three cases, the bathymetry comes from the GEBCO
(GEB-2008) dataset which has a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km).

The main aim of this nesting strategy is to solve the spatial variability of the region
and to improve wave estimations near the coast, since the morphodynamic results will5
depend directly on the quality of these nearshore values, which happen to show a larger
hydrodynamic error than that found for the more offshore (open) domain. Because
of that we have tested higher resolution wind models going down to a mesh size of
4 km and a wind input every one hour (Bolaños-Sanchez et al., 2007). In all cases the
differences between the input and dissipation terms were not relevant for such limited10
coastal domains. Moreover, the fact that SWAN uses a semi implicit scheme has also
proven to be advantageous in terms of selecting time and space steps.

Model boundary conditions are provided by the wind, mean sea level and current
fields. Input wind fields are obtained from IFREMER blended wind fields (Bentamy
et al., 2007) with a spatial grid resolution of 0.25◦ ×0.25◦ [27km×27 km] and 6 h time15
frequency. Data comprises operational ECMWF wind fields blended with remote sens-
ing observations (QuikSCAT scatterometer and SSM/I radiometers) through optimal
interpolation. These wind estimates were compared with moored buoy data, both at
deep and shallow waters and the results exhibit better agreement in open sea than in
nearshore areas. The conclusion is that near the coast the observations were up to20
2 ms−1 stronger and having a weaker onshore component. The input included daily
averaged sea level and velocity fields with a horizontal grid resolution of 1/16◦ (c.a.
6–7 km), as provided by MyOcean (Tonani et al., 2009).

Simulations span from 20 December to 31 December 2008 (i.e. they are initiated
six days prior to the storm peak on 26 December). This start point guarantees enough25
time margin to avoid warm-up phenomena, excluding it as a possible uncertainty factor
during the extreme event simulation. The model outputs are compared with different
data sources ranging from remote (satellite) images (deep water) to buoy network data
(shallow water). Usually, a storm event is characterized by the storm duration and wave

height, peak period and direction. Fortunately, wave height records are available both
at regional and local scale, becoming the “connecting” physical magnitude along the
different stages of this study. The models’ suitability for the study domain and some of
the associated errors, when compared with observations, have been also analysed in
Grifoll et al. (2013).5

The first step in the error estimation is based on the relation between satel-
lite preprocessed wave height data (Queffeulou, 2004) and the numerical output at
deep waters. Up to 14 000 data are within the considered regional area, derived
from the combined tracks of four satellites: ERS-2 (21.43% of the total), ENVISAT
(21.43%), JASON-1 (27.136%) and JASON-2 (30.044%). The second step deals10
with shallow water comparisons, based on the XIOM meteo-oceanographic network
observations. In this case, hourly wave height, period and direction are recorded.
Three directional buoys cover the three Catalan coast sectors: Barcelona (Llobre-
gat buoy [41◦16′31.52′′ N; 2◦08′16.04′′ E], deployed at 45 m depth), Girona (Tordera
buoy [41◦38′48.61′′ N; 2◦48′55.81′′ E], deployed at 75 m) and Tarragona (Cap Tortosa15
buoy [40◦42′54.51′′ N; 0◦58′50.78′′ E], deployed at 60 m). This network of observational
points allows to capture accurately both average and extremal hydrodynamic patterns
along the Catalan coast (Bolaños et al., 2009). In the studied period, going from 22
December to 31 December 2008, there were intervals of average and extreme wave
energy levels. The error analysis begins two days after the simulation initial time, be-20
cause the model needs less than 48 h to reach a steady state from a stationary cold
start.

3 Storm simulation and analysis

In the last two decades, up to 200 damaging wave storms have been reported at the
Catalan coast. Although this zone could be considered as well monitored in terms of25
hydrodynamics (see Sect. 2), the lack of pre and post-storm beach profile data repre-
sent an important constraint in terms of storm impacts. However, in the selected storm

(December 2008), pre- and post storm subaerial beach profiles from a LIDAR cam-
paign were available, offering an opportunity for improving morphodynamic response
assessment under extreme conditions.

The studied event consisted in a Mediterranean tropical-like storm that affected the
entire Catalan coast during almost 3 days (from 26 to 29 December). A high pressure5
centre in northern Europe helped to locate a weak low pressure centre in front of the
Catalan coast which kept on growing (due to the difference in air-water temperatures)
generating strong eastern winds with speeds of about 50 kmh−1 and gusts of up to
85 kmh−1. As a consequence, a big storm travelling from North to South affected the
Spanish NE coastal zone, producing severe damages on many coastal infrastructures.10

The highest waves recorded (XIOM network) appear in the central and northern
Catalan coast, with significant wave height (Hs) values up to 4.65 m and peak periods
up to 14.3 s (Fig. 2). In that area, Hs grew from 0.5 m to 4.65 in about 12 h as a result
of the eastern strong winds, with maximum height values of about 8 m. The southern
buoys registered smaller wave heights and periods, up to 3.3 m and 13.3 s respectively.15
The storm duration (considering a threshold value of Hs of 2 m) varies from 65 h at the
northern part of the Catalan coast to 55 h at the central and southern parts. The wave
direction had a clear Eastern component throughout the whole event.

If only the wave height is considered, the storm had an associated return period
of about 5 yr. However, its duration and the energy integrated contents arriving to the20
coast makes the event extraordinary and can be classified with the maximum category
that a storm can have in the Catalan coast (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2011b).

The impact of this storm was significant shoreline retreat in most of the beaches, with
overtopping and flooding in some cases, especially at the northern sector, together with
damages in many coastal and harbor structures. There were also three casualties and25
a generalized social alarm, which resulted in the closing of beaches and promenades.
Further details of the storm characteristics and effects can be found in Sánchez-Arcilla
et al. (2013) and Gràcia et al. (2013a).

Inverse uncertainty quantification through parameter calibration has been performed
with the same dataset already presented in Sect. 2. The method consists in fitting a free
parameter with the aim of minimising a quadratic cost function (Eq. 1), establishing
a ratio of model error to the observed variance. If the cost, χ , is equal to zero, both
recorded and computed time-series agree without “discrepancies”. Increasing “costs”5
indicate lower degrees of similarity. Moreover, the quadratic term ensures that large
differences weigh heavily in the total χ value. Such a cost function can be written as:

χ =

√√√√ 1
Nσ2

Y

N∑
n=1

(Xn − Yn)
2 (1)

Where X and Y refer to the computed and observed signals respectively, N is the10
number of data points and σ2Y is the variance of the observations.

The whitecapping dissipation coefficient, normally used to balance wind input (Leck-
ler et al., 2013), has been chosen as the free fit parameter. This choice is based on the
assumption that whitecapping is one of the worse known processes in the wave action
balance, despite recent efforts to improve its parameterization (Ardhuin et al., 2010).15

The minimum χ cost obtained with altimeter wave height is 0.37 with a rate of white-
capping dissipation of 2.25×10−5. Costs between 0.4 and 1.0 could be interpreted as
the range in which the variables are well-modeled and there is “enough” predictive skill
(Holt et al., 2005).

This dissipation parameter has been obtained with a sample that includes both mod-20
erate and extreme conditions (33.77% of the data records are above Hs = 2 m) and,
thus, could be considered to span the different storm stages (i.e. calm, growth and
decay). Higher data densities are found in the interval of Hs = 0.5 to 1.5 m, despite of
statistics showing a wave height mean of 1.81 m and a standard deviation of 2.39 m.
In the same interval, when plotting model values vs. observations, an almost linear fit25
is revealed (see red line in Fig. 3) which tends to separate from an “optimum” ratio
(dashed black line) at extreme values. Furthermore, if this linear trend is assumed,

a forecasting error from 0.5 m to 1.0 m would be within a confidence interval from 70%
(magenta lines) to 95% (blue lines), respectively.

The spatial distribution of the wave height differences has been analyzed with a Nor-
malized Root Mean Square Error approach (NRMSE, Eq. 2). This statistical indicator
is obtained clustering the data subset within a 0.5◦ ×0.5◦ grid and a time window of5
20 min. In case of having more than one time point on the same grid point, a mean
NRMSE is obtained instead (Fig. 4).

procedure highlighted that at deep and “open” waters (i.e. with no obstacles such as
islands, mountains and peninsulas that modify the meteo-oceanographic flow) the pro-
posed modelling sequence is able to reproduce wave height accurately with values
ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. However, sheltered nearshore areas such as the Southern
part of France, Northern part of Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea and the Eastern part of15
Cyprus confirm the more limited model performance (NRMSE near 1.0) in restricted
domains when using the coarse mesh. This phenomena is partially alleviated by a suit-
able nesting stategy and by implementing the required nearshore physics.

For the sake of completeness, the XIOM buoy network has been compared with the
finer mesh (1×1 km) results, but also refining the time step discretization and looking20
for time trends. As expected, correlated wave height costs are found in shallow waters,
exhibiting larger errors than for deep waters, with cost values of χ = 0.30 at Llobregat
and similar at Blanes (χ = 0.38) and Cap Tortosa (χ = 0.40) buoy positions. At Blanes
a 1.5 m difference between predicted and measured wave height was obtained during
the first storm peak, although the second one presented a much better fit. In the south-25
ern part of the coast, at the Cap Tortosa buoy, the first peak is overpredicted (3.14 m

measured vs. 3.5 m modelled) while the second storm maximum is underpredicted. At
the same place, it is also observed that a 3 h lag exists for the predicted storm peak.
It has to be considered that Llobregat and Cap Tortosa show a smaller error than the
Blanes location (the Llobregat buoy for the first storm peak presented “only” a discrep-
ancy of 0.56 m). In these central and southern parts of the coast the storm impact5
was lower. In all cases, the storm (wave height) growth and decay slopes were well
reproduced by the model, which also captured well the storm onset and peak pattern.

The peak period and average direction exhibit a similar behaviour, but with slightly
higher cost levels (with a maximum value of χ = 0.55), underlining that the model re-
produces better the wave pattern in the central coast (Llobregat buoy) than in the other10
two coastal sectors (northern and southern). Regarding the peak period fit quality, it
must be stressed that such variable depends on the directional wave spectral shape,
which is more complicated to reproduce than the integral (bulk) properties of the sea
state. This makes the fit assessment more difficult and uncertain, particularly when
considering the directional veering and spread typical of semi-enclosed domains with15
variable winds. This illustrates also a “physical” limitation of wave models, that need
a minimum time to “react” from sharp wind direction shifts (Bolaños-Sanchez et al.,
2007).

4 Hydro-morphodynamic impact: erosion and flooding

Once the hydrodynamic main driver (wind generated waves) has been quantified,20
coastal impacts (erosion and flooding) can be assessed using a “response” model. For
that purpose we have employed (Sect. 3) a 1m×1 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
grid from LIDAR campaigns. Although there were pre-storm observations all along the
coast, post-storm LIDAR data were available only at specific beaches. Considering this
and the morphodynamic model used (which shows a better performance with open25
coasts), two beaches have been selected. They had pre and post storm observations
and suffered important damages during the storm event: they are the Badalona and

Mataró beaches, both located at the central part of the Catalan coast (Fig. 1), where
the error levels for wave drivers are smallest.

The Badalona beach is a typical Mediterranean urban beach with a seafront prome-
nade in its backshore between +5 m and +6 m above MWL. The beach is characterized
by coarse sediment, between 350 µm and 600 µm. The main storm impacts reported5
were severe shoreline retreat and flooding due to run-up episodes.

The Mataró beach is located upstream of the Mataró harbor, in an accretive sector
due to the barrier effect of the harbour. It features an alongshore revetment in its back-
side that protects a railway line from the impact of incoming waves. The beach width is
variable, ranging from 10 m at the northern-most part up to 100 m at the south (closer10
to the harbor barrier). The sediment is also coarse, with median diameter of about
500 µm. The main reported storm impacts were overtopping beyond the revetment and
a reshaping of the upper part of the beach, which showed an important growth at
the southern part due to the impoundment produced by the harbor breakwaters under
storm waves.15

To start the analysis, prior to modelling tasks, the differences between pre and post
storm LIDAR bathymetries are calculated, helping to determine which processes must
be reproduced by the morphodynamic model. Hydrodynamic results from Sect. 3 con-
stitute the first step, where the central buoy position (Llobregat buoy) provided the best
fit. This buoy is close to the simulated Badalona domain and can be considered to be20
reasonably near the “upstream” of the Mataró beach. The emerged beach evolution
under the storm presented some general features (overall retreat, loss of sedimentary
volume and flooding) but was also conditioned by local constraints such as the railway
revetment at Mataró or the groyne at Badalona.

In previous sections it has been shown that the December 2008 storm was a two25
peak event with a predominant Eastern direction. Waves coming from the East induce
cross-shore directed water mass fluxes and a longshore current from Northwest to
Southwest due to wave obliquity with respect to the shoreline. Cross-shore currents to-
gether with high run-ups (enhanced by the associated storm surge) are able to capture

subaerial beach sediment. This material could be transported landward through over-
topping or offshorewards driven by undertow currents. In addition, long-shore currents
advect sand from NW to SW which is deposited at the emerged southern part of the do-
main, impounded by the barrier presence and, thus, resulting in accretion. This barrier
effect is produced by the Badalona port, located at the southern end of the Badalona5
sector; for the Mataró beach there exists a non-permeable groyne also at the southern
part.

During the studied storm there was a significant precipitation volume, reaching daily
mean values of 23.1 mm on 26 December and 16.6 mm on 27 December. Storm runoff
contained fine material making it difficult to distinguish between the inland or offshore10
origin of the sediments.

When looking at the detailed hydro-morphodynamics, some differences between the
two cases emerge. The Badalona sector (Fig. 5a) can be divided in three transects:
from the northern part to the groyne (B-North [B-N]), from the groyne to the sewer
outfall (B-Central [B-C]) and from the sewer outfall to the southern barrier (B-South15
[B-S]). There is a 2 km long, wide and open beach just outside the analyzed domain
(northern part) constituting a sediment source that is transported towards the Badalona
sector by longshore currents. This material is retained by a groyne (see green line)
located at about 100 m from the North border of the coastal stretch. In addition, cross-
shore currents drive material towards the offshore part of the profile. From +5.0 m to20
+2.5 m erosion dominates, relocating the sediment at the shoreface (i.e. from +2.0 m
to 0 m). On the contrary, deposition occurs at the central B-C zone where the sewer
outfall acts as a sediment trap. In contrast to the northern sector, in this zone cross-
shore currents drive sediment from the offshore to the inshore. The beach slope at B-C
is more reflective than at the B-N zone. Thus, wave overtopping and run-up are higher25
at B-C, helping to store sediment at the most inshore part of the profile. Finally, the
southern part acts as a sink zone, receiving sediment from longshore currents and the
sewer outfall but remaining sheltered by the Badalona port.

Despite the Mataró barrier (Fig. 6a) being more than four times longer than the
Badalona groin, the resulting pattern can be explained with only two sectors: from the
Northern part to the stream [S point in magenta] (M-North [M-N]) and from the stream
to the southern part (M-South [M-S]). At the North part a revetment (see green line)
protects the railway from wave action. High run-up and surges enhance wave-induced5
eroding fluxes that take material from the subaerial beach towards the submerged
beach, mainly by undertow currents. Such an offshore flux can be advected by long-
shore currents, that take it from the narrower northern sector (M-N) to the southern
side (M-S), storing the sand next to the groyne. The stream mouth (see magenta line)
shows a locally important accretion that should come from the river solid discharge,10
trapped by the low elevation zone present there.

Numerical modelling has provided further insight into how hydrodynamic drivers re-
shape the beach after a storm event. For this purpose, a locally adapted XBEACH
version (Roelvink et al., 2009), termed PREMOS, has been selected to reproduce
nearshore hydrodynamics and sediment transport for a range of conditions. This model15
solves nearshore waves and currents by means of a wave action balance equation
(similar to SWAN), coupled with a 2DH Navier Stokes shallow-water system (Stelling
and Duinmeijer, 2003). This coupling provides circulation and bed shear stress fields
which are used to feed an advection-diffusion equation computing the 2DH sediment
concentration patterns. This allows estimating sediment fluxes based on the continuity20
of sediment mass equation with suitable source/sink terms. From here we can calculate
erosion/accretion at every grid node, including the possibility to trigger an avalanch-
ing mechanism (van Thiel de Vries, 2009) on the wet-dry (shoreline) beach boundary
wherever the slope requires it.

The two studied beaches (Badalona and Mataró) have been discretized with an ir-25
regular grid. The Badalona domain has a cross-shore distance of 500 m (maximum
depth= 19.60 m) and an along-shore distance of 370 m. The mesh has a mean grid
size of 6.2 m in the cross-shore and 4.56 m in the along-shore directions (6724 nodes).
The Mataró domain has a cross-shore distance of 1440 m (maximum depth= 11.24 m)

and an along-shore distance of 1640 m (26 569 nodes). The mesh has a mean grid
size of 8.9 m in the cross-shore and 10.12 m in the along-shore directions. The sed-
iment has been taken as uniform in size, both for Badalona beach (D50= 550 µm)
and for Mataró beach (D50= 500 µm). The sediment equilibrium concentration (one of
the crucial choices in the source term of the advection-diffusion equation) has been5
evaluated with the van Rijn (2007) formulation, which considers wave assymetry and
skewness, based on previous results from the Catalan coast (Sánchez-Arcilla et al.,
2013).

The model perfomance has been evaluated through the Brier Skill Score (BSS) in-
dex, defined by van Rijn et al. (2003) as shown in Eq. (3):10

BSS = 1−



〈(∣∣zb,c − zb,m∣∣)2〉〈(

zb,0 − zb,m
)2〉


 (3)

Where zb,m is the post-storm bathymetry from LIDAR, zb,c is the model output grid
and zb,0 is the pre-storm bathymetry from LIDAR. A BSS value of 1 means that the
simulated and measured observations fully agree. As these two datasets diverge, the15
BSS is reduced even reaching negatives values. The threshold value that indicates
a prediction as “acceptable” is 0.4.

For both studied beaches the LIDAR campaign only covered the emerged part.
Hence, the bathymetry has been digitized from the most updated available nautical
charts. Due to this restriction, metrics have been calculated only where active cell20
points are present. Non-erodable points are not taken into account, avoiding BSS val-
ues “masked” with non-active points (since zero changes would artificially increase the
BSS index). Previous experiences at the Ebro delta (where Cap Tortosa buoy from the
XIOM network is located) have resulted in a BSS of 0.44, which can be considered as
acceptable (Gràcia et al., 2013b).25

Offshore boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic drivers required wave and sea
level fields, since the general circulation has been verified to be too small to transport

significant enough amounts of sediment. Directional spectra have been extracted from
the SWAN model output (see Sect. 3) every 20 min. Level boundary conditions are gen-
erated through blending Barcelona port sea level measurements (provided by Puertos
del Estado) and assimilated local atmospheric pressure gauges, with a time sampling
of 300 s. Storm surges did not influence significantly the sea level height, except on5
the 25 December when there was a mean decrease of 8 cm and the second half of 26
December when a mean increase of 12 cm occured.

As noted in Figs. 5b and 6b, the simulations have reproduced the observed erosion
and accretion patterns. From a qualitative point of view, the model has even been able
to capture the influence of local constraints such as the Badalona groyne or the existing10
revetments. However, the sedimentary input from land, although observable, has not
been taken into account due to the lack of reliable data.

With these settings a BSS of 0.36 has been obtained for Badalona beach which can
be considered as “acceptable”. Better results have been achieved at Mataró beach, de-
spite being a larger area (BSS=0.38). The main reason of these apparently low index15
values stems from the inaccuracies in the computed erosion/accretion magnitudes. Fig-
ures 5c and 6c show that the simulations are “smoother” than measured values, with
a clear underprediction, reaching maximum errors of −0.8 m in the Badalona case,
and even worse, 1.5 m in the Mataró case. The reason of these discrepancies will be
addressed in the next sesion.20

5 Errors and uncertainties

As shown above, the observed hydromorphodynamic patterns have been successfully
reproduced, with a relative error level of around 20%; however, the resulting error in
morphodynamics is of order 1.0 m (difference between observations and simulations)
which leads to a relative error level of 50%. The error is propagated in a non-linear25
sequential manner: from shelf meteo-oceanographic conditions that control regional
hydrodynamics that, in turn, condition local hydromorphodynamics to morphodynamic

evolution. The wind field (Cavaleri et al., 2010; Alomar et al., 2010) is the main source
of error for wind waves (the key hydrodynamic driver) and, thus, the first step to bound
this sequential error would be to deal with the wind field uncertainty.

For this purpose a linear correlation between wind velocity measurements and ob-
servations, analogous to the one presented in Sect. 3 (i.e. altimeter wind modulus vs.5
wind field modulus) has been obtained (not shown here). Although the wind field anal-
ysis against altimeter observations is out of the scope of this paper, it can be shown
that when increasing the wind velocity by 10% the fit to observations gets “better” (in
average) for the area that spans the whole Mediterranean (i.e. D-1 domain, see Fig. 1).
This is in accordance with previous results (Bertotti and Cavaleri, 2011) and shows that10
a 15% error in wind forecasting is not unusual, especially when sharp gradients occur.
An alternative to improve the hydrodynamic results is to perturb the wind field modulus
(Alomar et al., 2009). To analyse the sensitivity to the various options that are computa-
tionally feasible, the following subset of cases have been selected: no perturbation (A);
20% increase (B), 10% increase (D) and 5% (F) increase; and, correspondingly 20%15
(C), 10% (E) and 5% (G) decrements. The same computational approach exposed in
Sects. 3 and 4 has been here employed.

For the sake of simplicity, hydrodynamic analyses will be presented at shallow waters
only, comparing the XIOM buoy network wave height data with the SWAN output from
the D-3 domain (i.e. 1×1 km mesh). A sample comparison of the observations from20
two buoys (Llobregat and Blanes locations) vs. the model output using Taylor diagrams
(Taylor, 2001) appears in Fig. 7. This diagram summarises observations and model
agreement, establishing a graphical relationship among standard deviation (scaled by
the number of samples), centered root mean square difference (CRMSD, scaled by
the number of samples) and correlation coefficient. The model performance can be25
assessed from the distance between the observations reference point (LLOB for Llo-
bregat and BLAN for Blanes buoy, respectively) and the model points (see red points for
Blanes and blue ones for Llobregat). Note that the reference point position in the x axis
is related to the standard deviation intrinsic to each buoy. In other words, since higher

waves were recorded and more variability exists at the Blanes location, the standard
deviation is slightly larger.

Interestingly, each buoy presents distinctive trends but with common traits that sup-
port the existence of a link between deep and shallow water wave conditions (through
the propagation physics). If the wind modulus field is decreased, better performance5
(i.e. minimum distance) is found at Blanes, but the opposite occurs at Llobregat. The
model skill became worse for extreme cases: B and C did not show any improvement.
On the same line, E (−10%) case at Blanes and F (+5%) case at Llobregat show
shorter distances than the “unperturbed” model. These results reinforce the concept
that a perturbation ranging from 5 to 10% could represent more accurate wind fields in10
terms of the resulting waves.

In both cases, model and observations could be considered as “well correlated” with
mean coefficients near 0.95 at Llobregat and 0.97 at Blanes. Likewise, CRMSD is
higher at Blanes (mean value of 0.45) than at Llobregat (0.41). Moreover, distances
among the different cases are greater at Blanes than at Llobregat, suggesting that15
Blanes is more “sensitive” to perturbations. This could be attributed to the fact that the
Blanes location is more exposed to Eastern wave storms (more energetic and thus,
more capable of producing morphodynamic impact) than the Llobregat location.

Cap Tortosa results (not shown here) are similar to the ones from Blanes: minimum
distances are found by decreasing the wind modulus in 10% (E case). Correlations are20
lower than the ones described above (0.94), but also in a positive way, with CRMSD
(0.4) and standard deviation (1.01) showing the lowest values. These metrics could be
explained as the result of the “milder” wave conditions that characterize the Tarragona
sector (see Fig. 2), suggesting that simulations for “moderate waves” show better skill
than for more extremes (high or low) ones.25

In previous Catalan Coast analysis (for wave storm periods), it was shown that hydro-
dynamic drivers play a fundamental role and their accurate forecasting becomes crucial
(Gràcia et al., 2013b). Consequently, it was expected to find a wide range of BSS val-
ues when perturbing sea level and wave conditions. Directional spectra coming from

the SWAN model simulations altered the metrics but, surprisingly, sea level alterations
did not trigger any significant change in the response. This can be due to the reserve
beach height (berm) level in some profiles and to the crest level of the promenade or
revetment in others (when there was hardly any beach available).

In Sect. 4 it was noted that PREMOS results were smoother than the observations5
(see Figs. 5c and 6c). This could be partially solved by increasing the energetic level
of the hydrodynamic drivers, enhancing sediment fluxes that would lead to a sharper
morphodynamic evolution. As it can be seen from Fig. 8, in Mataró (see purple line)
a moderate increase of drivers (+5%, F scenario) improves BSS from 0.38 to 0.44. This
behaviour reinforces the critical role played by hydrodynamic forcing, whose best model10
skill is obtained by increasing the wind strength in a moderate way. However, there are
still exceptions such as the G case (−5%), where a decrease of hydrodynamic action
improves the subaerial beach accretion in Mataró South (see Fig. 6b), going from +6 m
to +4 m and resulting in more balanced metrics.

Therefore, when the wind modulus (and, thus, the wave height) is augmented, both15
the “correct” and “incorrect” patterns would tend to be amplified. The proposed balance
concept for the fit quality could be assessed in terms of the bias (see green line).
As highlighted by the green line, the bias is proportional to the drivers magnitude;
higher BSS are, thus, not necessarily correlated with lower global mean error. For
very energetic levels, e.g. B scenario (+20%), some simulations may even become20
morphodynamically unbounded and, thus, unstable.

Similar conclusions can be derived from the Badalona beach case (see red line), but
in this case morphodynamic patterns are more complex due to local constraints (i.e.
groyne, sewer outfall and Badalona port). If the wind modulus is decreased by 5% (G
case), the balance between “good” and “poor” patterns leads to higher BSS (from 0.3625
to 0.40). Note that it is another case where bias increases (see blue line) and BSS
increases, indicating that the overall pattern reproduction is improved while the model
error is not. It could be explained in terms of a fragile balance between local variables
and the overall energetic level. For instance, when the wind input is reduced (−10%

or −20%, i.e. E and C cases), the observed morphodynamic patterns (see Sect. 4)
are not properly developed, resulting in a BSS around 0.2. Moreover, when the wind
strength is decreased unrealistically, the sediment fluxes coming from the Northern
part of the domain start to bypass the groyne (see red line), reversing the behaviour in
the central part [B-C], Fig. 5a and c, from erosion to accretion.5

6 Discussion

Uncertainty reduction, as seen in previous sections, depends critically on the accuracy
of the forcing fields but is also conditioned by all terms appearing in the governing equa-
tions (the balance expression from previous sections). In this balance, the physics, the
corresponding parameterizations and the numerical discretizations play all important10
roles.

As shown in Sect. 3, strong bursts of wind momentum transfer were captured by the
wave model, albeit with large errors in areas near the land-ocean border (e.g. South-
ern France, see Fig. 4). The implemented wave growth parameterizations are based on
“moderate” wave conditions, because extreme event data for semi-enclosed domains15
are scarce and, thus, not well included in the calibrated formulations. Moreover, as
sharp gradients appear, the stationarity assumptions are no longer valid and nonlin-
earity gains in importance.

On the same line, as spatial and temporal scales become shorter (semi enclosed
domains), dominant processes have a significantly shorter “life”, making the simulated20
results too dependent on numerical inertia and boundary conditions errors. Since, the
time scale of hydro and morphodynamics may differ by one order of magnitude or
more, this introduces additional metric-related uncertainty (see Sects. 3 to 5). Higher
resolution implies also getting closer to the prediction limits and a higher sensitivity
to “numerics” and physics. The Mataró domain (1700 m alongshore) is four times big-25
ger than the Badalona one (370 m alongshore) and, as it has been shown in Sect. 5,

the same wind input changes “affect” Badalona more than Mataró according to the
employed metrics (see Fig. 8).

Sharp gradient modelling (again typical of semi-enclosed domains), requires to retain
the maximum amount of information among the different nested or coupled models, es-
tablishing “links” that control information exchanges. For this reason, directional wave5
spectra have been selected as the link between the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic
models, instead of using spectral integral parameters (e.g. Hs, Tp etc) that may mask
the true driving term characteristics (e.g. two crossing wave trains transporting sedi-
ment in opposite directions that are “condensed” into a single average direction that
is not physically correct). In all cases due attention should be paid to the consistency10
of “internal” boundary conditions (wind, wave and current values mutually compatible)
and the amount of information (energy) imposed at such boundaries, much more criti-
cal for restricted domains than for open sea areas.

Regarding the morphodynamic response under combined drivers, it is a qualitatively
well-known field but that is still in its infancy in modeling or quantitative terms. Adding15
storm surges to incident wave action (see Sect. 4) should have deep and significant
morphodynamic consequences, although in some runs they may be numerically lim-
ited. A perturbation of +0.1 m in sea level due to surges or uncertainty may provoke
a markedly different beach response and/or flooding consequences. This depends on
berm or structural crest levels (e.g. the promenade at the Badalona case and the revet-20
ment at the northern part of Mataró case). The coupling between mean sea level and
wind-generated waves is particularly important for determining gradients and it is these
gradients that control the sedimentary response.

The simulated bottom and coastline evolution will depend on the overall sediment
budget, which means considering the land discharge (in this case the sewer outfall at25
Badalona and the river stream at Mataró). They have not been, however, included in
the analysis, due to the lack of quantitative observations but they are expected to have
a significant (even if local) effect on the morphodynamic evolution under storm events,
when torrential rain discharges in a few hours most of the land-derived sediments

throughout the year (see Sect. 4, Figs. 5a and 6a). In order to quantify this discharge,
a run-off model coupled with the morphodynamic model could be an interesting solu-
tion but also a rather complex one.

The morphological evolution will also depend on the initial bathymetry. In the pre-
sented cases, as it usually happens in coastal studies, the emerged beach could be5
characterized (e.g. using LIDAR) in a more quantitative manner than the submerged
part of the profiles, that had to be at least in part interpolated. This introduces another
uncertainty in the computations, although in the presented cases the interpolated sub-
merged beach behaved (qualitatively) according to expectations from previous knowl-
edge. The interpolation provides, in addition, the smooth bathymetry that is required10
to avoid instabilities in the numerical runs, which requires often to artificially “smooth”
surveyed isobaths to ensure numerical stability, particularly when sharp gradients are
present. Because of that it cannot be stated, in general, that high resolution bathymetry
(with abrupt elevation changes) would significantly improve the results with respect to
a “smoothed” one.15

The connection between the emerged and submerged parts of the beach through
the swash zone is another important hindrance of present numerical approaches. It
depends on non-linear processes such as wave assymetry, skewness and non-linear
moments of bottom orbital velocity, including the turbulent component. As it has been
noted in Sect. 4, van Rijn (2007) is one of the formulations that takes these processes20
partly into account. Some of these processes has been included in PREMOS, but in
a simplified form and without considering the new knowledge recently derived from
large scale laboratory data (Alsina and Cáceres, 2011; Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2011a).

In addition to this land boundary condition, the beach evolution will depend on the
lateral sediment fluxes, which constitute another uncertainty source. These lateral con-25
ditions determine the real sand volume available in a littoral cell and, therefore, the
amount that can be “mobilised”. The uncertainty can be, however, partially alleviated
with nested simulations that move far “enough” these poorly known sediment boundary
fluxes.

In all the above remarks there is the question of multiple sediment sizes, which is the
normal situation in real beaches but that is seldom considered in the simulations, due
to the poor performance of transport formulations for a wide granulometric distribution.
Effects such as heterogeneous mixing and bottom armoring are still not considered in
state of the art models, due to the limited knowledge about the underlying physics.5

In summary, present models combine multiple limitations that, in addition to natural
variability, result in uncertainties at multiple scales which are still hard to quantify, both
individually and as part of a joint assessment.

7 Conclusions

Hydro-morphodynamic predictions in restricted domains show larger errors than simu-10
lations for open sea cases, where temporal and spatial scales show smaller gradients,
easier to capture by numerical models. Wave action is the main driver for morphody-
namic evolution and the errors in spectral wave parameters near the coast are about
twice what has been found in the middle of the Mediterranean basin. The spectral
shape has also significant effects on sediment transport since, for instance, the exis-15
tence of more than one spectral peak results in long waves or crossing wave trains,
both of which may modify critically the associated morphological evolution. The ap-
pearance of time “lags” between predicted and simulated storm peaks is another type
of error that, together with the under- and over-predictions mentioned in the paper may
lead to important differences when simulating erosion or flooding processes.20

The spatial distribution of sediment fluxes introduces further uncertainties in the sim-
ulations, whose errors may go from 20% for hydrodynamics to more than 50% for the
computed morphodynamics. This is due to the integrative nature of the calculated sea
bed evolution (responding to wave and surge conditions plus the effects of sediment
characteristics, the presence of barriers etc.). The result evolution comes from mutu-25
ally interacting long-shore and cross-shore transports that must appear explicitly in the
computations (e.g. the discussed offshore transport during storms that is then captured

by the alongshore flux and leads to enhanced by-pass around the tip of breakwaters
or groins). The river and outfall solid discharges should be also considered in the anal-
yses since their signature is apparent in some of the data. The lack of quantitative
measurements, however, has precluded considering it in the paper, adding another
source of uncertainty. The morphodynamic computations also “integrate” the sediment5
fluxes at the lateral and shoreline boundaries, all of which are difficult to quantify. This
explains the large discrepancies of simulations and observations (up to 1.5 in bed level
in the worst cases) and justifies BSS index values around 0.30. The quality of simu-
lated results gets worse in the presence of structures (groins, revetments, etc.), where
the modified sediment fluxes are even more uncertain (more complex hydro and mor-10
phodynamics, partial barrier effects, etc.).

The quality of the predictions may be improved by semi-empirical coefficients (e.g.
a 10% increase in the driving wind velocity) or by improved physical formulations
(swash zone parameterized fluxes for the shore boundary condition). More energetic
conditions may lead to larger errors if the input or boundary conditions are perturbed15
but they may also converge more quickly towards the “true” solution if these conditions
are properly specified.

This illustrates the complex nature and propagation of errors in hydro-
morphodynamic modeling suites and the need to combine measurements with detailed
“physics” to improve the accuracy and robustness of the calculations. This would be the20
way to achieve more informed coastal decisions.

Fig. 1. Western Mediterranean Sea and the three domains employed in the numerical simula-
tions. The purple one represents the Western Mediterranean Sea, the green one represents
the Baleric Sea (D-2) and the red one the Catalan Coast Shelf (D-3). The red crosses denote
the XIOM buoy positions. The two insets (Mataró and Badalona municipalities and beaches)
correspond to the areas selected for morphodynamic analysis.

Fig. 7. Hydrodynamic sensitivity analysis schematized in a Taylor diagram. Green lines repre-
sents the correlation coefficient. Blue semicircles represent the CRMSD error for the Llobregat
buoy. Red semicircles represent the CRMSD error for the Blanes buoy. The radius is propor-
tional to the CRMSD, representing a 0.1 unit each step. Red (Blanes buoy) and Blue (Llobregat
buoy) dots come from the sensitivity analysis. Black axis: standard deviation. Point legend:
A (Original wind field), B (+20%), C (−20%), D (+10%), E (−10%), F (+5%) and G (−5%). All
perturbations in the wind driving (for initial, see text).
