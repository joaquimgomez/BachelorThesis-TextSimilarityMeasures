Abstract The propagation of bichromatic wave groups with differences in the wave-group structure
and its influence in long-wave generation are investigated. The wave-group structure is controlled by
the number of wave groups (Ng) within a repetition period. Consequently, an important energy content
is measured at lower frequencies than the group frequency fg, in particular, at the repetition frequency
fr . The cross-shore evolution of the energy at fr is partly explained by nonlinear energy transfers from
the primary frequencies and partly by a breakpoint forcing. When Ng increases, the energy transfer to fr
during wave group shoaling reduces. When Ng ‚â• 3, the amplitude of fr suddenly grows at the
breakpoint displaying a node-antinode pattern within the surf zone. In this case, the observed dominance
of the breakpoint forcing over the energy transfers is justified by the combination of steep-slope regime
and steep-wave conditions. The resultant cross-shore structure is in agreement with the Symonds et al.
(1982, https://doi.org/10.1029/JC087iC01p00492) mechanism. A new methodology is proposed to identify
the amplitude and phase cross-shore evolution of the radiated and reflected components. Due to energy
dissipation of short waves and long waves at fg, the swash zone motion can be dominated by wave motions
occurring at fr .

Plain Language Summary Examination of the sea surface profile records indicates that wave
heights are not uniform showing a tendency of forming wave groups, that is, high waves often seem to
be grouped together. During shoreward wave group propagation, the waves forming the groups undergo
substantial transformations and they eventually break close to the shoreline, defining a moving wave
breakpoint. This moving breakpoint acts as a wave maker generating seaward and shoreward propagating
waves whose wavelength is related to the modulation of the wave group (typically long waves). As a result
of this long-wave generation, a characteristic cross-shore pattern is identified. These breakpoint-generated
long waves have been traditionally measured on field and laboratory under specific conditions associated
to relatively steep beach slopes only, with no evidences of their existence on milder beach slopes.The
present paper is one of the first investigations on nearshore processes where evidences of breakpoint
generated long waves on a mild beach slope (1:100) have been measured. To achieve that, differences in the
wave-group structure have been imposed in the design of the experimental wave cases. Furthermore, a new
methodology is proposed to identify and compute the cross-shore evolution of these breakpoint-generated
long waves.

1. Introduction

The generation of long waves by the breaking of short-wave groups is an important mechanism for energy
transfer to low-frequency motions in coastal regions. These low-frequency motions were initially termed as
surf beat (Munk, 1949; Tucker, 1950) referring to long waves in coastal areas propagating seaward whose
phase was in good agreement with the time required by the incident short waves forming the wave-group
to reach the shoreline and reflect as long waves. Since then, two mechanisms are widely accepted to be
responsible for those outgoing long waves. One is due to the reflection of the group-bound incoming
long waves (ILWs; Longuet-Higgins & Stewart, 1962) that travel seaward from the shoreline as free long
waves. The second mechanism, proposed by Symonds et al. (1982, henceforth Sym82), is the radiation of
shoreward and seaward long waves as a consequence of variations in the radiation stresses induced by a
moving breakpoint.

In water of finite depth, a group-bound ILW appears as the water depression at the center of the wave
group. Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962) formulated the presence of this group-bound ILW as the equi-
librium response of the system to variations of the radiation stresses on the time and length scales of the
short-wave groups. This implies an equilibrium solution where the ILW remains in antiphase with the wave
group envelope. However, when the wave group propagates over a sloping bed, the system is no longer
in equilibrium (unless the slope is so gentle that a dynamic equilibrium might be achieved, as suggested
by Longuet-Higgins & Stewart, 1962) and the ILW amplitude at fg grows due to nonlinear energy transfers
from the primary frequencies (Battjes et al., 2004). Associated to this amplitude growth, a progressive lag of
the ILW wave motion behind the wave group envelope has been widely reported (Battjes et al., 2004; Janssen
et al., 2003; List, 1992; Padilla & Alsina, 2017b; Van Dongeren & Svendsen, 1997). Battjes et al. (2004) observed
that the amplitude growth of the ILW during wave group shoaling is a function of the normalized bed
slope parameter

ùõΩ = S
ùúî

‚àö
g
h
, (1)

where S is the bed slope, ùúî is the angular frequency, g in the gravitational acceleration, and h is the water
depth defined as the water depth at the mean breakpoint. Van Dongeren et al. (2007) identified a mild-slope
regime when ùõΩ < 0.1, whereas a steep-slope regime exists when ùõΩ > 0.45. On mild-slope regimes, the energy
transfer to low-frequency motions is more intense than on relatively steep slopes, and the growth rate of ILW
is larger than on steep-slope regimes (Battjes et al., 2004; Van Dongeren et al., 2007). As a result, in the mild
slope regime the importance of long waves radiated at fg from the moving breakpoint (Sym82 mechanism) is
secondary (List, 1992; Van Dongeren et al., 2003). This fact justifies why previous authors (i.e., Janssen et al.,
2003; Van Dongeren et al., 2007, among others) did not find any evidence of that mechanism in experiments
performed over relatively mild slopes. Conversely, on relatively steep slopes (Baldock & Huntley, 2002; Baldock
et al., 2000; Contardo & Symonds, 2013; Kostense, 1985; List, 1992), the cross-shore structure of the long-wave
motion seems to be in agreement with the Sym82 mechanism. In these cases, the long waves radiated by the
Sym82 mechanism and reflected at the shoreline dominate over the group-bound ILW at fg.

The relative importance of the breakpoint generation mechanism has been also related to the short-wave
steepness (Baldock, 2012; Baldock & Huntley, 2002; Contardo & Symonds, 2013). The wave steepness indicates
whether short-wave breaking occurs in shallow water. Short-wave breaking before the shallow water condi-
tion typically occurs by steep-wave conditions (high short-wave steepness). In this case, the ILW may decay
to a smaller amplitude inside the surf zone as the primary wave forcing is reduced after breaking, and the
breakpoint forcing becomes dominant (Baldock, 2012; Baldock & Huntley, 2002; Contardo & Symonds, 2013).
Conversely, for mild-wave conditions (low short-wave steepness), short-wave breaking occurs in shallow water
and the ILW satisfies the wave dispersion relationship, being progressively released from the high-frequency
(hf ) wave groups, and the breakpoint forcing is weak (Baldock, 2012; Baldock & Huntley, 2002).

To quantify the long-wave generation due to nonlinear coupling of primary components (Longuet-Higgins &
Stewart, 1962) or breakpoint forcing leading to long-wave radiation (Sym82), Baldock (2012) proposes a surf
beat similarity parameter

ùúâsurfbeat = ùõΩ

‚àö
HOS
LOS

, (2)

where ùõΩ is the normalized bed slope and HOS‚àïLOS is the short waves steepness in deep water. Therefore, high
ùúâsurfbeat values are associated with steep wave conditions (high HOS‚àïLOS) traveling on a steep-slope regime
(high ùõΩ), which are the ideal conditions for a dominant breakpoint generated surf beat in agreement with Con-
tardo and Symonds (2013). In random sea states, the low-frequency energy distributes over a relatively wide
range of low frequencies, also called infragravity band (Guza & Thornton, 1985; Holman, 1981), and the gen-
eration mechanism of forced long waves (breakpoint, nonlinear interaction) might have different importance
depending on the beach slope and the frequency band.

In dissipative beach conditions, energy saturation is observed at the incident primary components and the
energy close to the shoreline can be dominated by infragravity components (Guedes et al., 2013; Guza &
Thornton, 1982; Holland et al., 1995; Holman & Bowen, 1984; Raubenheimer et al., 1995; Ruessink et al., 1998;
Ruggiero et al., 2004; Senechal et al., 2011). However, saturation of the infragravity energy close to the shore-
line have been also reported (Battjes et al., 2004; Van Dongeren et al., 2007) especially for relatively high
values of low-frequency components (Guedes et al., 2013; Padilla & Alsina, 2017b). Low-frequency energy

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the breakpoint long-wave generation. The t0, t1, and t2 are three different time
instants: In t0, the wave group travels shoreward with the ILW, which is group bound in antiphase with the group
envelope. Between t0 and t1, the smaller and higher waves forming the group break defining the inner (xib) and outer
(xob) breaking locations. At this stage, the moving breakpoint radiates RI and RO shoreward and seaward, respectively. In
t2, the ILW and RI reach the shoreline and reflect back as free long waves Rf. Outside the surf zone, the combination of
ILW, RO, and Rf defines the total ingoing and outgoing long-wave TIOLW (adapted from Moura & Baldock, 2017).
ILW = incoming long wave; RO = Radiated Outgoing; RI = Radiated Incoming; Rf = Reflected; TIOLW = Total Ingoing and

reduction can be also observed as a consequence of the dissipation of the primary forcing components after
high-frequency waves breaking (Baldock, 2012). In these gentle slope conditions, the swash motion might be
dominated by the lower infragravity frequency range, particularly when dissipation of the higher infragravity
components occurs (Guedes et al., 2013; Ruggiero et al., 2004).

1.1. Breakpoint-Generated Surf Beat
When a wave group propagates on a plane beach slope, the sequence of individual wave breaking defines
an oscillatory breakpoint. The smaller waves break further shoreward, defining the inner breaking location
xib, whereas the higher waves push the breakpoint seaward, defining the outer breaking location xob (see
Figure 1). Using a parametrization of the time modulated surf zone, Sym82 modeled the generation of long
waves at the breakpoint, freely propagating shoreward and seaward. These long waves radiated from the
breakpoint are henceforth called RI (Radiated Incoming, toward the shoreline) and RO (Radiated Outgoing).

In Figure 1, a wave group propagating on a plane bed with the ILW in antiphase with the group envelope is
illustrated at t0. As the wave-group sequentially breaks (t0 to t1), ingoing and outgoing long waves, RI and RO,
are radiated from the breakpoint. From t1 to t2, the ILW and RI travel shoreward and reflect at the shoreline,
subsequently traveling seaward as free waves, Rf. The combination of ILW, RO, and Rf outside the surf zone
defines the Total Ingoing and Outgoing Long Wave (TIOLW). This describes a situation where the nonlinear
energy transfer and breakpoint mechanisms (Longuet-Higgins & Stewart, 1962, and Sym82, respectively) are
comparable and define a complicated cross-shore pattern (Sch√§ffer, 1993). Assuming a negligible contribution
of the ILW, the resulting cross-shore structure is the following: within the surf zone, RI and Rf travel in opposite
directions, and their amplitude relationship is expected to be ARI >ARf due to some energy dissipation at the
shoreline. Consequently, RI and Rf develop a quasi-standing pattern with antinodes, when RI and Rf are in
phase, and nodes, when RI and Rf are in antiphase. Outside the surf zone, Rf and RO travel in the same direction.
They combine and become TO (Total Outgoing long wave), which is equal to TIOLW when ILW is negligible.
As a result of this combination, TO lays between a maximum amplitude (ARf +ARO) if Rf and RO travel seaward
in phase and a minimal amplitude (|ARf ‚àí ARO|) when Rf and RO travel seaward in antiphase.
The contribution of the breakpoint forcing to generate surf beat results in a maximum outgoing amplitude
ATO whenŒîŒ¶ = ùúôRO‚àíùúôRf = 0 rad, and consequently, the linear superposition of Rf and RO creates a maximum
constructive wave interference. In this case, it is said that the response of the system is maximum (Baldock

et al., 2000; Kostense, 1985; Symonds et al., 1982). Conversely, when ŒîŒ¶ = ùúã rad, Rf and RO result in a maxi-
mum destructive wave interference where the response of the system is minimal. A nondimensional measure
of ATO is typically a function of the relative phase ŒîŒ¶, which is not usually known. Sym82 found that the

, (3)

whereùúî is the angular frequency of the breakpoint oscillation, xmb is the mean breakpoint location measured
from the shore, and S is the beach slope, accounts reasonably well for ŒîŒ¶ in relative steep slopes. Results
from Baldock et al. (2000), Baldock and Huntley (2002), Moura and Baldock (2018), and Contardo et al. (2018),
among others, widely support that maximum response is expected at ùúí ‚âà 1.2, whereas minimal response at
ùúí ‚âà 3.7 (Sym82). However, other studies, such as Kostense (1985; experimentally), Sch√§ffer (1993; analytically),
or Madsen et al. (1997; numerically), support qualitatively but not quantitatively the results of Sym82.

The present experimental work focuses on the generation mechanism and dynamics of forced long waves on
gentle beach slope conditions. Controlled bichromatic waves are generated aiming to reproduce long waves
at the group and lower frequencies, in particular, at the repetition frequency fr , associated to the repetition of
the wave group structure. The generation of long waves at lower frequencies than the characteristic group fre-
quency has not been studied in detail in previous works (with the exceptions of Baldock et al., 2000, and Moura
& Baldock, 2018), although lower-frequency components than fg can be an important source of energy at the
shoreline when saturation of the group frequency occurs (Ruessink et al., 1998; Ruggiero et al., 2004; Senechal
et al., 2011). Following the description and analysis of the present data (section 2), we propose a methodol-
ogy to compute the breakpoint-radiated long waves RI and RO, and the reflected long wave at the shoreline
Rf (section 3). The conditions where the long-wave evolution at fr is dominated by the Sym82 mechanism are
presented in section 4. The generated wave conditions aimed to reproduce strong energy dissipation of the
group frequency close to the shoreline, and therefore, the importance of the fr component at the swash zone
in these conditions is also explained in section 4. Finally, results are discussed and summarized in sections 5
and 6, respectively.

2. Experimental Work
2.1. Experimental Setup
The experimental data presented in this study have been obtained in the Wave Evolution Flume at Imperial
College London. This wave flume has a length of 60 m, with a distance from the wave paddle to the emerged
end of 52 m. A beach profile has been built with glass panels forming a mild beach slope of 1:100. The flume
width is 0.3 m with a working water depth of 0.7 m at the generation end, and 0.5 m at the toe of the beach
profile (see Figure 2). Waves are generated using a flap-type, bottom-hinged, wave paddle, which is numer-
ically controlled incorporating active-force feedback control. This guarantees the generation of the desired
waves and the absorption of any unwanted reflected waves. Wave generation is performed using a force

control technique that effectively suppresses high-frequency spurious waves. This technique is included in
the commercial software that controls the wave paddle. Moreover, the wave generation is corrected as in
Padilla and Alsina (2017a) to minimize the appearance of low-frequency spurious waves (See Appendix A).

Water surface elevation is measured using resistance-type gauges (RTGs), acoustic-type sensors (ATSs), and a
resistance-type run-up wire (RTRW). The RTG and ATS have been deployed on movable platforms that, with
repeated experiments, allow obtaining a surface elevation data set with a spatial resolution from 0.3 m in the
shoaling zone to 0.1 m in the surf zone. The nonintrusive ATSs are deployed in the swash zone with an average
separation of 0.2 m, whereas the run-up wire, parallel to the beach profile, measures the swash horizontal
location time series. In total, this high spatial resolution allows obtaining 234 cross-shore measuring locations
along the 52 m of wave flume (see Figure 2). The measured water surface elevation time series have a typical
duration of 10 min with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz.

2.2. Data Set Description
In this work, 10 bichromatic wave cases, gathered in DIFFREP-ICL data set, have been studied. Table 1 displays
the main characteristics of the generated wave conditions. These are fully modulated waves comprising a

range of wave group frequencies (fg = f1 ‚àí f2), wave group repetitions (Ng), mean primary frequencies (fp =
(f1 + f2)‚àï2), and initial amplitudes of the primary components (a1 = a2), where the primary frequencies are
f1 and f2. Within a time series of water surface elevation ùúÇ, Ng is the number of wave groups before a specific
wave phase repeats exactly. Therefore, Ng = Tr‚àïTg (in terms of the repetition and group periods), or Ng = fg‚àïfr
(in terms of the group and repetition frequencies). For instance, when Ng is set to 1, identical wave groups
repeat exactly within a times series (Padilla & Alsina, 2017b). In the present experiments, Ng is varied from 1
to 5 indicating that a given wave phase repeats exactly every one to five wave groups. The concept of group
repetition number (Ng) is illustrated in Figure 3 where four wave cases with Ng = 1, 2, 3, and 5 are showed
(a more detailed explanation of these wave conditions is given below). The different wave group repetition
Ng has been combined with varying fg, fp, and primary wave amplitude-inducing variations in the location,
width, and length of the moving breakpoint. The range of fp varies from 0.3 to 0.9 Hz. fp has an influence on
the main breakpoint location by affecting the steepness of the primary waves and group velocity. Therefore,
for a given primary waves amplitude, the main breaking onset moves shoreward for increasing values of fp,
whereas the breaking onset moves seaward for decreasing values of fp as seen in Padilla and Alsina (2017b).

The primary wave amplitude varies from 0.010 to 0.025 m, and it is also responsible for the breakpoint
location inducing seaward breaking onsets for increasing a1, a2. The group frequency fg varies from 0.074
to 0.284 Hz and controls the width and length of the moving breakpoint. For a certain Ng and fp, fg is
computed as

fg =
fp

n + Œîn
, (4)

where (n+Œîn) is the number of wave crests forming the groups: n is the integer number of crests, whereasŒîn
is the necessary increment to satisfy the repetition condition imposed by Ng.Œîn is a Ng-dependent parameter
numerically computed by varyingŒîn in increments of 5 ‚ãÖ10‚àí5 until the mean absolute difference of ùúÇ between
repetition periods Tr is minimized. As a result, Œîn = [0.5, 0, 0.16665, 0.1] for Ng = [1, 2, 3, 5].

2.3. Data Analysis
The measured water surface elevation signals at different cross-shore locations, ùúÇ‚àó, are ensemble averaged
over the repetition period (Tr). The standard deviation of the ensemble signals is very low, O(10

‚àí4 m), and
similar to the RTG accuracy (¬±5 ‚ãÖ 10‚àí4 m). Then, for the present analysis new water surface elevation signals
ùúÇ are built repeating the ensemble-averaged signal a minimum of 30 times. This technique, already used by
Padilla and Alsina (2017b), allows the reduction of noise and undesired errors in the presented analysis. The
same technique is carried out for the run-up signal. Spectral analysis of the surface elevation is performed via
a fast Fourier transform, and each fast Fourier transform was performed using time series resampled to 10 Hz
with a frequency resolution of 0.001 Hz.

Figure 3 shows the water surface elevation for wave cases with different repetition number Ng. For case MR-01
(plot a), Ng = 1, and a given wave phase repeats exactly every 1 wave group that is, all the wave groups
are identical within a time series. In contrast, the signal repeats after two wave groups for case MR-02 (plot
b), whereas for cases MR-03 (plot c) and MR-06 (plot d) the signal repeats every three and five wave groups,
respectively. Three different wave periods are clearly identified in Figure 3: the mean primary wave period
or time between two consecutive short-wave crests forming the groups (Tp = 1‚àïfp), the period of the wave
groups (Tg = 1‚àïfg), and the repetition period (Tr = 1‚àïfr).

3. Identification of Breakpoint Forced Long Wave Components

At a certain low frequency f (i.e., subharmonic of the primary frequencies), the water surface elevation filtered
at f is ùúÇf . Assuming the presence of breakpoint generated long waves, ùúÇf is the result of the combined compo-
nents RI, RO, and Rf (see Figure 4). RI and RO are the ingoing and outgoing, respectively, radiated long waves
at the breakpoint, whereas Rf is the reflected wave at the shoreline. The combination of RO and Rf from the
breakpoint seaward is the TO. The cross-shore amplitude and phase evolution for RI, RO, and Rf are

the following procedure where the ILW is assumed to be negligible. This is an important assumption, whose
validity at fr will be discussed in section 4.2.

3.1. Computation of TO
Assuming the group-bound ILW to be negligible compared with the radiated components, Rf and RO are the
only two energetic long-wave components from Xob seaward. Since TO is the combination of Rf and RO, the

3.2. Computation of RI and Rf
From Xib shoreward, RI and Rf are traveling in opposite directions. Consequently, they build a quasi-standing
pattern where the ùúÇf motion is minimum at nodes (Xnode) and maximum at antinodes (Xanti). By definition, RI
and Rf share the same phase at the antinodes. Therefore, at the maximum constructive interference between
RI and Rf (point [Xanti, tanti] in Figure 4c), ùúô

As seen, RI and Rf are in phase at (Xanti, tanti), whereas RI and Rf are out of phase at (Xnode, tnode). Therefore, the
amplitudes of RI and Rf satisfy the following linear system:

3.3. Computation of RO
From Xob seaward, RO must satisfy the condition TO = Rf + RO, which is written as the following nonlinear
system:

Equations (10)‚Äì(19) are solved for the present experimental observations to obtain the RI, RO, Rf, and TO
components. The solving scheme is the following:

1. Assuming the ILW to be negligible, the TO amplitude and phase are obtained at any cross-shore location
in the shoaling region by solving equations (10) and (11). The assumption of negligible ILW is valid at the
repetition frequency fr as it will be discussed below.

2. Within the surf zone, the phase and amplitude of the ingoing breakpoint-radiated long wave (RI) and the
shoreline reflected long wave (Rf ) are obtained at the nodes and antinodes by solving equations (12)‚Äì(15).
Then, the phase and amplitude at any cross-shore locations within the surf zone are obtained by linear
wave propagation.

3. Finally, the breakpoint-radiated outgoing long wave (RO) is obtained outside the surf zone using
equations (18) and (19) knowing the amplitude and phase of TO and Rf from steps 1 and 2.

The obtained results will be presented in section 4.3.

4. Results

4.1. Wave Group and Long-Wave Propagation at the Group Frequency
During shoreward propagation of the wave groups, nonlinear coupling of the primary wave components
[f1, f2] induces energy transfers to components resultant of the sum (f1+f2) and difference (f1‚àíf2) of interacting
frequencies. The difference frequency is the group frequency fg and its gain of energy is visible as the growth
of the group-bound ILW during shoaling. Figures 5 and 6 show the cross-shore distribution of wave amplitude
at different frequency components (i.e., f1, f2, fg, and fr) where wave conditions with similar fg but different Ng
are displayed in Figure 5, and wave conditions with different fg but same Ng are displayed in Figure 6. In plots
a‚Äìc of Figures 5 and 6, the amplitude reduction of f1 and f2 is mainly explained by energy transfers to super-
harmonics and subharmonics, although side-friction loses are not negligible (Padilla & Alsina, 2017b). Baldock
et al. (2000) and Padilla and Alsina (2017b, among others) revealed that, in general, f1 contributes to the
growth of fg more than f2, which explains why f1 decreases before f2. The nonlinear triad interaction [f1, f2]‚Üí fg
results in an important growth of energy at fg, and consequently, fg becomes the dominant low-frequency (lf )
component during shoaling (see plots a‚Äìc).

During wave-group propagation onto a beach, the short waves forming the wave groups undergo substantial
nonlinear transformations due to energy transfers to hf components. The short waves become more asym-
metric progressively and eventually break (shaded region in Figures 5 and 6). As a result, the energy content
of hf components (f1, f2, and higher) is mostly dissipated and lf components become the dominant features
along the surf zone. Actually, the dominance of fg is very clear, just few meters after the inner breakpoint and
shoreward (see plots a‚Äìc in Figures 5 and 6). Shoreward of the short-wave breakpoint, the amplitude of fg
progressively reduces due to the reduction of the primary waves energy forcing the long wave at fg (Baldock,
2012) until the remaining energy reflects at the shoreline. In shallow water, the nonlinear triad interaction
between primary components and the group frequency becomes resonant and the resultant long wave might
propagate as a free wave.

Previous works (Battjes et al., 2004; De Bakker et al., 2014; Padilla & Alsina, 2017b; Van Dongeren et al.,
2007) have related the reflection coefficient at fg with the parameter ùõΩ that, for a constant beach slope and

short-wave breaking location, depends solely on the wave group frequency. Similar wave conditions to the
ones presented here were studied by Padilla and Alsina (2017b) but restricted to Ng = 1. Padilla and Alsina
(2017b) showed that for relatively high fg (i.e., reducing the groups length or number of waves per group n, in
particular n = 3) the reflected wave at fg is almost negligible due to dissipation of wave energy at fg induced
by long-wave breaking. This is also confirmed in the present data by the tiny undulation of the cross-shore
amplitude at fg in plots a‚Äìc (Figure 5), indicating that the ILW is dominant. Alternatively, when fg decreases
(i.e., n increases from 3 to 8), no long-wave breaking is expected and the magnitude of the reflected wave
increases. This is confirmed by the rising amplitude of the undulations of the cross-shore ILW at fg from plots
a‚Äìc (Figure 6), indicating the superposition of Rf and ILW.

4.2. Nonlinear Interactions and Energy Transfer to fr During Wave Group Shoaling
As seen in Figure 3, Ng and fr are closely related in the way fr = fg‚àïNg. This implies that fr is a subharmonic
of fg. The value of Ng, then, plays an important role in the nonlinear energy transfer to the fr component. For
instance, when Ng = 1, fr receives energy as a result of the nonlinear triad interaction [f1, f2] ‚Üí fr because
fr = fg. An extensive discussion about the energy transfers when Ng = 1 is found in Padilla and Alsina (2017b).

When Ng = 2, the group frequency receives energy during shoaling as [f1, f2] ‚Üí fg. Nonlinear energy trans-
fers are obtained using bispectral analysis (see Appendix B for an overview of nonlinear energy computations
using the bispectral technique) over time series resampled to 10 Hz with a frequency resolution of 0.001 Hz.
Figures 7a and 7c show the superimposed energy density spectra of the water surface elevation (SùúÇùúÇ) at every
cross-shore location. For the case MR-02 (Ng = 2) in plot a, the most relevant energetic frequency components
below the primary frequencies are highlighted. According to these frequency components, plot b illustrates
the cumulative cross-shore energy fluxes due to nonlinear energy exchanges only (‚à´ x

x1
Snl dx) for the most rel-

evant triads involving fr . For instance, blue line in Figure 7b refers to the balance of energy exchange between
fr and the rest of energetic wave components. Therefore, negative values means a net energy transfer to fr
(fr ‚Üê F). Figure 7b shows that the net energy flux to fr (O(10

‚àí7) m3/s) is mainly due to contributions from the
component f1 ([fr, f1 ‚àí fr] ‚Üê f1), whereas the contribution from the remaining triads is negligible.

Figure 7. Plots a and b, and c and d illustrate the wave cases MR-02 and MR-03, respectively. The energy density spectra of the water surface elevation (SùúÇùúÇ ) at
every cross-shore location is superimposed in plots a and c in order to highlight the most relevant energetic wave frequencies below [f1, f2]. Plots b and d show
the cumulative cross-shore energy fluxes due to the triads in the legend. The red dashed line is the breaking onset xob.

The same analysis about the energy transfers to fr is illustrated in Figures 7c and 7d for case MR-03 (Ng = 3). In
this case, the net energy flux to fr when Ng = 3, compared to the case with Ng = 2, is an order of magnitude
lower (O(10‚àí8) m3/s). Similarly, f1 is the main energy supplier to fr , followed by f2, whereas the contribution
of the remaining triads is again negligible. In general, this important reduction in the energy flux from f1 to fr
is seen when Ng > 2. Consequently, there is no noticeable amplitude growth of fr during shoaling, as seen in
Figures 5e and 5f where no energy growth at fr is observed before the breakpoint location.

4.3. Breakpoint Generated Long Wave at fr
The long-wave behavior at fr within the surf zone is very different compared to fg when Ng ‚â• 3. From the
breakpoint shoreward, the amplitude of fr suddenly grows displaying a node-antinode pattern. This is clearly
observed in Figures 5e and 5f and 6d‚Äì6f. As a consequence of this growth in fr within the surf zone, the
amplitudes of fg and fr are comparable in the vicinity of the shoreline.

The sudden amplitude growth at the breakpoint undergone by fr in Figure 6d (case MR-03) cannot be
explained by the nonlinear energy exchanges between frequency components. In contrast, the long waves
radiated by the moving breakpoint, RI and RO, and the associated reflected wave at the shoreline Rf do explain
this sudden growth. Figure 8 gathers the measured surface elevation at fr and the computed RI, RO, and Rf
for case MR-03, based on the methodology proposed in section 3. In plot a, the sum of RI, RO, and Rf pro-
vides a theoretical cross-shore amplitude (Th) that is in very good agreement with the measured cross-shore
amplitude (Md) at fr . The existence of Rf and RI propagating in opposite direction develops a quasi-standing
pattern that explains the node-antinode pattern observed in the surf zone. The perfect match in the location
of the nodes and antinodes validates the estimation of the phase velocities of RI (cRI) and Rf (cRf). However, the
zeroth-order Bessel function J0 (Lamb, 1932, art. 186) is unable to correctly reproduce the standing pattern.
This is partly due to the fact that the phase velocities of Rf and RI within the surf zone are no longer equal
to

‚àö
gh, but slower (see Figure 8d). Note that the surf zone is shallow water (kd ‚â™ ùúã‚àï10) for fr and, overall,

c =

gh is a valid simplification of the Linear Dispersion Equation along the flume.

case MR-03 (Ng = 3). Additionally, the zeroth-order Bessel function (J0) is included. Plots b and c show the cross-shore
evolution of the phase and amplitude of RI, RO, Rf, and TO. Plot d shows the actual phase velocities cRI and cRf compared
to the depth-induced phase velocity (

x axis is in log-scale, and it has been displaced +1.7 m.

gh has already been pointed out by Baldock and Huntley
(2002) and Contardo and Symonds (2013). In the theoretical solution (Th) displayed in Figure 8a, the free
long-wave celerity within the surf zone has been obtained experimentally by using the average long-wave
celerity between antinodes. As the experimental velocity between antinodes provides only a local estimation
but not a continuous velocity cj , a depth-induced slowdown factor Œîc is proposed to account for potential
velocity reductions below

‚àö
gh within the surf zone:

cj = ¬±(
‚àö

gh‚àó ‚àí Œîcj), (20)

where j refers to the long-wave components RI (sign ‚àí) and Rf (sign +) and h‚àó) is the actual water depth.
Experimentally, the depth-induced slowdown factor Œîc is computed as

Œîc =

(21)

where ùúÅ j is a best fit parameter obtained by fitting equation (20) to the averaged measured celerities between
antinodes for RI (cRI) and Rf (cRf), respectively (see plots b and d).

This slow down of RI and Rf is clearly seen in Figure 8b. Solid lines show the actual phase propagation for
RO, RI, Rf, and TO by tracking the time-space evolution of their crests. Figure 8b confirms that RI and Rf travel
slower than the depth-induced phase velocity

‚àö
gh (dashed lines) within the surf zone. This velocity (

estimates that RI takes around 18s to travel from the breaking onset to the shoreline, whereas it effectively
takes about 34 s, which is nearly 90% more. In contrast, this percentage reduces to 43% for Rf. Outside the surf

zone,
‚àö

gh reproduces quite well the phase velocity, as it is clearly seen with TO traveling offshore. Actually,
Figure 8b suggests that the mechanism causing the slowdown in RI and Rf, is no longer acting outside the
surf zone since Rf and RO travel seaward with the same phase velocity (parallel lines in plot b).

Within the surf zone, RI and Rf travel in shallow water and the slowdown in the actual phase velocity (equal to
the group velocity in shallow water) compared to the

‚àö
gh estimation implies an amplitude growth for RI and

Rf different from the theoretical linear shoaling. In order to preserve the energy flux conservation, the actual
wave phase velocity computed in Figure 8d is used to compute the shoaling coefficient Sh in equation (9).
Consequently, since the ingoing and outgoing phase velocities are remarkably different, RI and Rf have differ-
ent shoaling coefficients and their cross-shore amplitudes grow differently. That explains why, in Figure 8c, RI
is slightly larger than Rf along the surf zone, suggesting small-energy dissipation at the shoreline, although
RI and Rf are similar at the moving breakpoint.

The case MR-03 presented in Figure 8a illustrates a practically minimal response scenario, in which RO and Rf
are about ùúã radians shifted at the outer breaking location. In general, a minimal response scenario does not
imply almost null energy content for TO, but it does for case MR-03 since ARf ‚âà ARO in the shoaling region.
Furthermore, the linear long-wave amplitude transition within the breaking excursion for RI and RO seems to
reproduce the sudden amplitude growth fairly well (Figures 8a and 8c).

Figure 9 presents phase relationships for the wave cases where the breakpoint generated surf beat at fr was
clear. Figure 9a shows the phase of the RO versus RI at the mean breakpoint location (xmb = (xib + xob)‚àï2),
where RI and RO seem to share the same phase at the mean breakpoint. This is physically consistent with
radiated waves by a moving breakpoint that acts as a wave maker. Likewise, Figure 9b shows the phase lag
between RO and Rf at the outer breakpoint location (ŒîŒ¶ = ùúôRO ‚àí ùúôRf ) against the normalized ATO at xob. This

antinode of the free standing wave.

4.4. Low-Frequency Energy at the Shoreline
Due to hf wave breaking and the strong short-wave energy dissipation over the gentle beach slope (1:100),
the remaining wave energy in the inner surf zone is mainly driven by lf components (see Figures 6 and 8).
Eventually, these lf components are responsible for the uprush and backwash events that define a moving
shoreline and the swash dynamics. The maximum cross-shore length of the uprush is the run-up excursion.

Figure 10a shows the horizontal shoreline location (xs) normalized by the run-up for the wave cases presented
in Figure 3. Note that xs is measured from the shoreline at still water conditions and positive landward. As

time scale of the features at Tg and Tr is highlighted and their corresponding frequencies identified and marked in the power spectrum. Note that units of the
power spectrum are 1/Hz because the time series is nondimensional.

PADILLA AND ALSINA 8934



Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1029/2018JC014213

expected, the shoreline signal is, in general, dominated by large wave periods (Tg and Tr), whereas the shorter
waves (Tp) are negligible. That is, lf components (fg and fr) are far more energetic than hf components. In
fact, the frequency threshold below 0.4 Hz contains about 90% of the energy content of the shoreline signal
(plot b).

For wave groups satisfying Ng = 1, fg is the only energetic lf component. In this case, the ILW at fg becomes the
most energetic component at the shoreline. Consequently, the moving shoreline presents a very well defined
oscillation at the time scale of Tg (case MR-01 in Figure 10a). In contrast, cases MR-02 (Ng = 2) and MR-03
(Ng = 3) show a longer uprush duration (time scale of Tr), comprising two and three grouping structures,
respectively. For the later cases, it is clear that the energy content at fr dominates over the one at fg in the
shoreline. This loss of relative importance of fg compared to fr is consistent with the long-wave breaking of
the ILW at fg suggested by Padilla and Alsina (2017b). However, the energy content at fr in the swash zone
progressively decreases when Ng increases, in agreement with Figures 5d‚Äì5f.

In order to quantify the relative importance between fg and fr at the shoreline, Figure 10b gathers the energy
spectral density of the previously mentioned moving shoreline signals. In general, the energy content at fr is
equal or higher than the one at fg when Ng ‚â§ 3. In particular, fr represents 91.4% of the total shoreline signal
energy content for case MR-02, which is far higher than the 6.6% at fg. The magnitude differences between
fr and fg reduce for MR-03 (fr contains 59.9% compared to the 12.5% associated to fg). The reduction in the
relative importance of fr turns evident for case MR-06, where the energy content associated to fr (0.4%) is
negligible compared to the one at fg (39%).

5. Discussion

The long-wave breakpoint generation has been clearly identified for frequencies lower than the wave group
frequency (Figures 5d‚Äì5f and 6d‚Äì6f) as previously reported by Baldock et al. (2000) and Moura and Baldock
(2018). The fact that the moving breakpoint may radiate waves at further frequencies than just fg has been
proposed by Baldock et al. (2000) and Moura and Baldock (2018). However, most of the existing works have
traditionally addressed the breakpoint generated surf beat at fg (Baldock et al., 2000; Contardo & Symonds,
2013; Kostense, 1985; List, 1992, among others). Long waves radiated from the moving breakpoint at fg coexist
with existing ILWs, which grow in amplitude during wave group shoaling. The separation of both waves (the
ones due to breakpoint forcing and the ones due to nonlinear interactions) is complex at fg. This is not the
case at fr when Ng ‚â• 3. The increase in the repetition number Ng reduces the nonlinear energy transfer to fr
as the energy flux from f1 to fr reduces (see Figure 7). The implications of this energy flux reduction have been
clearly illustrated in Figure 5 where the amplitude at fr in the shoaling region decreases when Ng increases. In
this context, if the breakpoint generated surf beat is relevant enough, it dominates over energy transfers as
seen in Figures 5d‚Äì5f and 6d‚Äì6f.

The present data set is in agreement with Baldock (2012) showing that the breakpoint generated surf beat
is dominant for steep-wave conditions over a steep-slope regime. Concerning the slope regime, Battjes et al.
(2004) and Van Dongeren et al. (2007) used the normalized bed slope parameter ùõΩ , equation (1), to identify
the mild-slope regime (when ùõΩ < 0.1) and the steep-slope regime (ùõΩ > 0.45). Case MR-01 (Ng = 1) represents
a mild-slope regime (ùõΩ = 0.106) where fr = fg and the amplitude growth due to energy transfers dominates
over the breakpoint generated surf beat. In contrast, if wave steepness keeps the same but Ng increases to
3 (case MR-03), then this case now performs a near steep-slope regime (ùõΩ = 0.308) where the breakpoint
generated surf beat dominates over energy transfers. Overall, ùõΩ at fr is above 0.3 for the wave cases where
the breakpoint generated surf beat is identified (Table 2). These wave cases are in nearly steep-slope regime
in agreement with List (1992) and van Dongeren et al. (2003), who indicated that the breakpoint generated
surf beat becomes more important with steeper slopes. The slope gradient in this study (1:100) is an order
or magnitude lower than the usual one of previous experiments where the breakpoint generated surf beat
has been identified (i.e., 1:20 in Kostense, 1985). However, both are comparable and represent steep-slope
regimes because low frequency waves fr over mild slopes behave similarly to higher frequency waves over
steep slopes (Sch√§ffer, 1993).

Concerning the short-wave steepness, Baldock and Huntley (2002), Baldock (2012), and Contardo and
Symonds (2013) showed that the breakpoint-generated surf beat may be still weak if the wave conditions

are mild (low wave steepness) even within a steep-slope regime. Most of the presented cases perform

steep-wave conditions since the short waves mostly break before shallow water conditions (xob > xShWL in

Table 2). Consequently, the breakpoint-generated surf beat effectively dominates. In summary, both factors

(wave conditions and slope regime) are included in the surf beat similarity parameter ùúâsurfbeat, equation (2),

proposed by Baldock (2012). This parameter indicates whether the breakpoint generated surf beat dominates

(large values of ùúâsurfbeat) over the energy transfers (small values of ùúâsurfbeat). In the present experiments, low

values of ùúâsurfbeat(Table 2) indicate a dominance of energy transfers (ùúâsurfbeat ‚âà 0.01), whereas higher values
(ùúâsurfbeat > 0.04) indicate the dominance of the breakpoint generated surf beat.

So far, we have discussed the relative importance between the breakpoint-generated surf beat and the

nonlinear energy transfers, assuming an existing breakpoint generated surf beat. In order to assess if the

breakpoint-generated surf beat may potentially exist at a certain frequency f , Baldock et al. (2000) concluded

that the ratio between the length of the breaking excursion (Œîxb) and the wavelength of the free long wave at
the frequency f (Lf ) must be at most in the range 0.2‚Äì0.3. Certainly, this is the case since Œîxb‚àïLfr < 0.2 for any
long-wave case at fr presented in this work (see Table 2). Note that the limiting value (0.2‚Äì0.3) proposed by

Baldock et al. (2000) is based on results at the grouping frequency fg, but the same physical reasoning seems

to be applicable to further frequencies, like fr .

In comparison, fg overall represents a clear mild-slope regime with ùõΩ ‚âà 0.1 (not shown). Although the
short-wave steepness is high, the breakpoint forcing at fg remains weak under a mild-slope regime with

ùúâsurfbeat values importantly lower than the ones for fr . This is consistent with a dominant ILW at fg growing due

to nonlinear energy transfers (Figures 5a‚Äì5c and 6a‚Äì6c). On top of that, even assuming nonlinear energy

transfers to be negligible, the development of the Sym82 mechanism at fg seems to be unlikely according to

Baldock et al. (2000) since overall Œîxb‚àïLfg > 0.3.

As expected from Sym82 and Baldock et al. (2000), the radiated waves RO and RI are in phase at the mean

breakpoint for minimal response scenarios (Figure 9a). In the design of the experiments for the present data

set, the aim was to cover a range of wave cases comprising maximum and minimal response at fr . This range

is achieved when ŒîŒ¶, the relative phase between RO and Rf at the breakpoint, goes from 0 to ùúã radians. The
easiest way to modify ŒîŒ¶ is modifying the location of the breakpoint. To do so, the present data set com-
prises wave cases modifying (1) the initial amplitude of the primary frequencies [a1, a2]; (2) the mean primary

frequency fp; (3) the repetition of the wave groups Ng; and (4) the number of crest forming the wave groups n.

However, the combination of low frequencies (fr) and mild slope (1:100) seems to prevent the development

of any scenario different from a nearly minimal response. The values for ŒîŒ¶ vary around ùúã regardless of the
normalized surf zone width ùúí (Figures 9b and 9d), which traditionally should correspond to values of ùúí ‚âà 3.7
(Baldock et al., 2000; Contardo et al., 2018; Symonds et al., 1982). The computed values of ùúí goes from 1.6 to

18.1 instead (Figures 9c and 9d), performing always a nearly minimal response.

The measured slowdown detected for the RI and Rf within the surf zone has been previously reported, at

least, by Baldock and Huntley (2002) and Contardo and Symonds (2013). In both cases, the steeper slope

induces a shorter surf zone and the resulting slowdown is an order or magnitude lower than the one in

Figure 8. Contardo and Symonds (2013) suggest that the slow down might be due to inaccuracies measur-

ing the bathymetry or allocating the shoreline. However, the high level of spatial resolution achieved by the

present data set excludes this possibility.

The importance of long waves at lower frequencies is clearly seen in mild-slope conditions due to the pos-

sible saturation of higher low-frequency energy close to the shoreline and the increasing importance of

lower-frequency components. Energy dissipation of the wave group long wave has been found, and conse-

quently, the run-up is dominated by fr . Previous works have already reported the saturation of long-wave

energy at fg close to the shoreline (De Bakker et al., 2014; Guedes et al., 2013; Padilla & Alsina, 2017b; Senechal

et al., 2011; Van Dongeren et al., 2007, among others) and a frequency roll-off to lower frequencies of the

run-up signal (Ruessink et al., 1998; Ruggiero et al., 2004).

6. Conclusion

New laboratory data on surf beat generation induced by bichromatic wave groups propagating on a 1:100
sloping bed have been presented. The investigated wave groups comprise a range of group frequencies (fg),
wave group repetitions (Ng), mean primary frequencies (fp), and initial amplitudes of the primary compo-
nents (a1, a2) for fully modulated cases (a1 = a2). Measurements with high spatial resolution include moving
shoreline time series and water surface elevation with clear identification of the breakpoint excursion.

The generation and propagation of long waves at lower frequencies than the group frequency has been inves-
tigated. In particular, frequencies associated with the wave group structure beyond the main group, that is,
repetition of the wave group structure at fr , has been investigated. The long-wave generation and growth at
fr is partly due to the breakpoint forcing (breakpoint oscillating by the repetition of the wave group structure)
and partly due to the nonlinear energy transfer from primary frequencies. It has been found that the domi-
nance of one or other mechanism (breakpoint forcing, nonlinear energy transfer) depends on the repetition
frequency for the given beach slope. For low repetition numbers (Ng < 3), the cross-shore amplitude at fr
progressively grows mainly due to nonlinear energy transfers from f1, whose energy flux depends on the rep-
etition number Ng. When Ng = 2, the wave group represents a nearly mild-slope regime at fr (ùõΩ < 0.2) and
the breakpoint generated surf beat at fr is comparable to the nonlinear energy gain of fr . In contrast, when
the wave group sequence repeats, at least, after three groups (Ng ‚â• 3), the nonlinear energy transfer during
wave group shoaling is drastically reduced.

The cross-shore amplitude of fr suddenly grows at the breakpoint and develops a node-antinode pattern
within the surf zone. In this case, the wave group represents a steep-slope regime at fr (ùõΩ > 0.3) and, con-
sequently, the breakpoint generated surf beat at fr dominates over the nonlinear energy transfers. With a
dominant breakpoint generated surf beat, we propose a methodology to compute the actual amplitude and
phase evolution of the radiated components by the moving breakpoint (RI and RO) and the reflected wave at
the shoreline (Rf ).

From the breakpoint shoreward, RI and Rf travel in opposite directions developing a quasi-standing pat-
tern that explains the nodes and antinodes identified along the surf zone. The distance between nodes has
confirmed the slow down in the phase velocity of both RI and Rf far below the expected depth-induced
velocity

‚àö
gh.

From the breakpoint seaward, TO is the linear combination of RO and Rf. Due to the combination of wave con-
ditions and slope regime for this study, the normalized amplitude of TO suggests a nearly minimal response
of the breakpoint-generated surf beat for all the tested cases. This minimal response is also confirmed by the
difference phase (ŒîŒ¶ ‚âà ùúã) between RO and Rf. For steeper slopes 1:O(10), the nondimensional parameter ùúí
has traditionally been a good descriptor of the maximum (ùúí ‚âà 1.2) and minimal response (ùúí ‚âà 3.7) of the
breakpoint-generated surf beat. However, this might not be the case for fr on milder slopes (1:100) because
minimal response is always observed regardless of ùúí varying from 1.6 to 18.1. Instead, data suggest that the
magnitude of the minimal response grows with increasing ùúí . On top of that, at the mean breakpoint, RI and
RO seem to share the same phase at minimal response scenarios.

For the presented beach slope and wave conditions, saturation has been observed at the primary frequencies
and group frequency. In this situation, the swash zone is dominated by lower frequencies, that is, the repetition
frequency fr .

Appendix A: Validation of the Experimental Wave Cases

In order to verify a proper suppression of the lf spurious waves throughout all the experimental wave cases
presented in this research, Figure A1 illustrates the amplitude of the Ingoing Free Long Waves (IFLWs, spurious)
before and after the wave generation is corrected according to Padilla and Alsina (2017a). The efficiency of
the procedure is assessed by the suppression percentage after correction (plots c and d).

Wave cases forming the DIFFREP-ILC data set are characterized by a range of Ng with a variety of lf components
at the lf domain. In this case, Figure A1 only illustrates the IFLW suppression at fg and fr . At fg, the suppression
percentage is in general above 90% (plot c) and the resulting IFLW amplitude after correction is O(10‚àí4 m)
(plot a). At fr , Figure A1d shows a decay in the efficiency of the correction procedure (overall above 60%)
compared with fg (overall above 80%). However, the resulting IFLW amplitude at fr is O(10

‚àí5 m), which is an
order of magnitude below the IFLW at fg.

Figure A1. Plots a and b show the IFLW amplitude at fg and fr respectively before and after the low-frequency
correction is applied to the wave generation obtained at the first measuring location X1. Plots c and d show the IFLW
attenuation percentage at fg and fr , respectively. IFLW = Ingoing Free Long Wave.

Appendix B: Nonlinear Energy Exchanges Based on Bispectral Analysis

During wave propagation, the energy content associated to any frequency may increase-decrease due to
near-resonant nonlinear energy exchanges among components. The net transfer of energy associated to
a frequency f due to nonlinear triad wave-wave interactions can be studied to the second order on the
basis of high order spectral energy balance (De Bakker et al., 2015; Elgar & Guza, 1986; Hasselmann et al.,
1963, among others). In these studies, the transport of energy associated with a frequency f is presented as the
following balance:

ùúïFf (x)
ùúïx

= Snl,f (x) + Sds,f (x). (B1)

where Ff is the cross-shore gradient of the energy flux spectrum, Snl,f is the nonlinear source term that accounts
for the triad wave-wave interactions, and Sds,f is a dissipation term that includes energy losses such as viscous
dissipation.

The resonance condition accounts for the phase coupling between the wave components in the triad. There-
fore, the amount of energy transfer between resonant components depends on their relative phases, which
is quantified through bispectral analysis (Hasselmann et al., 1963). The bispectrum (B) decomposes the
third-order moment of a signal and analyses the interaction between frequency components in a triad-type
[fi, fj, fi + fj], accounting for their phases coupling. The digital bispectrum, applied for discretely sampled
data, is

B(fi, fj) = E[A
‚àó
fi

A‚àó
fj

Afi+fj ], (B2)

where A refers to the complex Fourier coefficients belonging to each frequency component. At first glance,
equation (B2) returns to zero unless the frequencies forming the triad [fi, fj, fi+fj] are all energetic wave compo-
nents with a high degree of frequency coherence. When this phase coherence occurs, a nonlinear wave-wave
interaction is taking place.

Herbers and Burton (1997), using the Boussinesq hypotheses, formulated a simple relation between the net
nonlinear energy transfer (Snl,f ) to and from a frequency f and the bispectrum (B), which is

Snl,f =
3ùúã f

h
‚Ñë

{
f‚àë

f ‚Ä≤=0
B(f ‚Ä≤, f ‚àí f ‚Ä≤) ‚àí 2

f‚àë
f ‚Ä≤=0

B(f ‚Ä≤, f )

}
, (B3)

where h is the water depth and‚Ñë indicates the imaginary part. The nonlinear energy exchanges are computed
using the bispectrum definition given by equation (B2) in order to describe which frequency components
receive and transfer energy within the triad. Assuming a resonant triad [f1, f2, f1 + f2], if ‚Ñë{B(f1, f2)}> 0, f1 and
f2 export energy to f1 + f2. On the contrary, if ‚Ñë{B(f1, f2)} < 0, f1 and f2 receive energy from f1 + f2. When
‚Ñë{B(f1, f2)} = 0, the energy transfer vanishes.
