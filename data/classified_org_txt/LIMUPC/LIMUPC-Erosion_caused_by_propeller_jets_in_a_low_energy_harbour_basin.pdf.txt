ABSTRACT
Field data of a harbour basin are compared with analytical formulations for predicting maximum scouring depth due to propeller jets. Spatial data
analysis of seven-year biannual bathymetries quantifies the evolution of the scouring hole along with the sedimentation process within a harbour
basin. The maximum scouring depth is found to be of the order of the propeller diameter with a maximum scouring rate within the first six months
of docking manoeuvring. Three of the analysed expressions yielded realistic results while observed discrepancies between the theoretical predictions
and field data are related to scaling factors. The outcomes of this analysis can be extrapolated to other harbours to improve their management. The
obtained results highlight the importance of field data in developing combined physical and numerical models.

Keywords: Erosion control; erosion processes; field studies; flow–structure interactions; sedimentation; turbulence–sediments
interactions; velocity measurements

1 Introduction

Morphodynamic changes inside marinas due to ship manoeu-
vring represent an increasing problem for harbour authorities.
The rise in shipping activities along with the size of vessels and
an increase in engine power over the last 20 years have led to
growing economic and structural problems. The increase in the
size of vessels has given rise to morphodynamic changes in the
harbour basin due to two different but linked problems: scour-
ing effects in the vicinity of the structures affecting the stability,

and sedimentation of the scoured material in the harbour basin
that reduces the average depth of the basin. In particular, old
marinas designed to host ships with lower depths and engine
powers have to either fill the scouring holes or dredge the sed-
imentation areas quite often, or alternatively implement bed
protection measures in the harbour basins. Both factors decrease
the efficiency and operability of the harbour, causing signif-
icant economic losses. This problem affects several harbours
around the world with different configurations, morphologies
and tidal ranges (e.g. Berg & Magnusson, 1987; Chait, 1987;

Fuehrer, Pohl, & Römish, 1987; Hamill, Johnston, & Stewart,
1999; Hamill, Ryan, & Johnston, 2009; Schokking, Janssen, &
Verhagen, 2003).

Theoretical and experimental expressions to predict the
dimensions of the propeller scouring actions were published in
the 1987 report of the World Association for Waterborne Trans-
port Infrastructure (PIANC) (Berg & Magnusson, 1987; Chait,
1987; Fuehrer et al., 1987; Hamill, 1987; Robakiewicz, 1987)
and in the last technical report by PIANC (2015). The problem
of ship scouring during docking and undocking manoeuvring
was first addressed by simulating the effects of the helices with
a water submerged jet. However, Verheij (1983) concluded that
water jets and propeller jets produce different effects due to the
rotating effect of the latter and the suppression zone directly
underneath the propellers. From then on, different authors have
proposed equations to predict the size of the scouring hole
caused by the propellers. Most of these equations are based on
experimental studies (e.g. Chiew & Lim, 1996; Hamill, 1987;
Hamill & McGarvey, 1996; Hamill, Kee, & Ryan, 2015; Hong,
Chiew, & Cheng, 2013; Ryan & Hamill, 2013; Schokking et al.,
2003; Stewart, 1992). Interestingly, Ryan, Hamill, and Johnston
(2013) proposed a new methodology based on artificial neu-
ral networks to predict maximum erosion as a result of ship
docking manoeuvring. Real studies were only used for prob-
lem definition and real data were not used for the experimental
formulations (Berg & Magnusson, 1987).

This research aims to evaluate the existing formulations pub-
lished so far and compare their results to real scouring data.
We based our research on a unique set of data at a particular
basin obtained during the period 2007–2014: morphodynamic
changes were identified after periodic bathymetries of the basin,
dominated by a single ship berthing at different docking loca-
tions in time. For the first time, this enabled the testing of
formulations obtained through physical model studies in a real
case. Additionally, the detailed study of a long set of bathyme-
tries was used to evaluate the effects produced by vessels during
docking and undocking manoeuvring with real data of the
manoeuvring frequencies and duration. The real location of the
harbour basin data used in this research is kept confidential at
the request of the harbour authorities.

2 Methodology

2.1 Data description: real case

Periodic bathymetric surveys were carried out with a multi-
beam system SeaBeam1185, Elac-Nautik, Germany. The blank-
ing distance from the floating line was 0.65 m and data were
recorded at 180 kHz with a boat speed ranging from 3 to 5. The
data acquisition average error was around 0.1 m due to an upper
layer of mud within the harbour basin of an estimated thickness
of 0.5 m.

A detailed study of the frequency and vessel type, Domingo
(2014), concluded that most of the scouring process was caused

by a RoPax vessel type. The prototype vessel was chosen as
a combination of the docking frequency (daily), and the total
draft of all the vessels using the same harbour basin over one
year (7 m). The vessel had two stern propellers with a diam-
eter of 5.6 m and an engine power of 11,000 kW each. The
effect of other vessels docking at the same areas could also
be considered but with the aim of being conservative, only
the RoPax vessel has been taken into account in the current
research.

Figure 1 plots bathymetric data of a real harbour basin with
a depth of 12 m above sea level (asl), where the evolution
of berthing depth is represented for seven years together with
the trajectories of the docking and undocking manoeuvring.
Geological studies performed by the harbour authorities yield
sediment characteristics below the mud layer of d50 = 0.3 mm
and d90 = 1.0 mm, normal sizes for a harbour located in a
deltaic zone. According to the geological studies, the sediment
layer with these characteristics reaches up to the − 26 m asl
level, which is thick enough to assume that the equations can be
used with a single value of d50.

The docking location of the RoPax vessel changed during the
period of 2007–2014. Until 2008 the ship docked with a daily
frequency at the NW corner with docking manoeuvring clearly
seen in the bathymetry (Fig. 1b). In 2010 (Fig. 1c), the docking
location changed to the NE corner and again manoeuvring oper-
ations left an eroded track on the harbour basin bed. In October
2012 harbour authorities decided to dredge the areas with a
lower depth in the harbour basin without rectifying the already-
existing scouring problems. The same RoPAx vessel changed
the docking location in 2013 to the SW corner, as seen in Fig
1d. Parallel to the scouring action of the vessel, a sedimentation
process occurred between 2009 (Fig. 1b) and 2011 (Fig. 1c),
with the sediment deposition located parallel to the west dock
(Fig. 1c). The effects of the two propellers in the erosion pattern
at the three docking locations are visible in the analysis of the
bathymetric data in Fig. 1.

Two detailed sections of the scouring and eroding processes
within the harbour basin are plotted in Figs 2 and 3. In Fig. 2
(a section parallel to the north quay) the comparison between
the profiles from May 2010 to November 2010 in the NE dock
shows an increase in the scouring hole of up to 2 m, at a rate
of 1 m every three months. Moreover, the sedimentation rate in
the same period of time is of the order of 1 m. At the NW dock,
as regards daily operations between April 2007 and December
2008, the maximum scouring rate occurred between April 2007
and July 2008, with a total increase in water depth of 3 m (Figs
2 and 3). In the same location (the NW dock), the scouring
action that occurred post-2008 cannot be accounted for by the
same RoPax vessel, since the RoPax vessel changed the dock-
ing location at the beginning of 2009. The third docking location
at the SW dock, with daily operations post-November 2013,
produced a scouring rate of 2 m within seven months, which
represents the same order of magnitude as the previous docking
locations.

Figure 4 Evolution of the maximum scouring depth with the number
of manoeuvres, considering one manoeuvre the sum of the docking and
undocking manoeuvres

The effects of twin propellers are clear in all the docking loca-
tions. Comparing Figs 2 and 3 with the manoeuvring plotted in
Fig. 1, it is clear that the propeller on the port side produces
deeper scouring holes, regardless of its location with respect to
the wall of the dock. This indicates that the influence of the wall
is not as important as the manoeuvring itself.

Figure 4 summarizes the evolution of the scouring rate
produced at the three docking locations as a function of the
number of manoeuvres, yielding a constant value of 1.2 m every
100 manoeuvres. After 600 manoeuvres, the scouring process
reaches a steady state. The final depth at this stage is up to one
propeller diameter.

2.2 Erosion depth formulae

The erosion caused by propellers during docking and undock-
ing manoeuvring can be addressed from three perspectives. The
first, unconfined propeller jets, is related to the consequences
produced by a rotating propeller far enough from any block-
ing object or wall; the second addresses the effects of the same
rotating propeller but close to a wall; finally, the third focuses
on local jet scouring, approaching the same problem without the
rotational effects. The local physics behind the same problem
are different for the third case because, as described by Verheij
(1983), rotational effects are not considered and there is no sup-
pression zone directly underneath the jet orifice. However, the
latter formulations were used in order to increase the options to
compute the maximum erosion caused by ship propellers.

The maximum scouring depth, defined as the maximum
scour in time produced by a propeller, is expressed as a func-
tion of the efflux velocity (described as the velocity behind the
propeller); the propeller diameter; the distance between the pro-
peller and the bottom of the harbour basin; and the size of the
sediment settled at the bottom of the harbour basin. Apart from
the influence of the previous variables, other authors have sug-
gested the need to include rudder influence (Verheij, 1983), the

use of more than one propeller (Berg & Magnusson, 1987), and
the influence of the propeller characteristics (i.e. Hamill, 1988;
Hamill et al., 1999; Hashmi, 2007; Lam, Hamill, Robinson, &
Raghunathan, 2012).

Some of the following equations estimate the maximum
scouring depth as a function of time, but restricted to an exper-
imental time in which a steady state, also named asymptotic
state, is reached. Results obtained with the formulations below
can be compared to the aforementioned field data, since the
maximum scouring depth has already been reached in at least
one of the three docking positions.

One of the most important variables used in the formulas
described in the literature is the efflux velocity, V0. This velocity
can be estimated with two theoretical approaches that are based
on the idealized behaviour of a single propeller. The first expres-
sion is based on the momentum equation of an actuator disk with
negligible thickness and infinite number of blades:

V0 = C1nDp
√

KT (1)

where C1 is the coefficient shown in Table 1. When this coeffi-
cient is unknown, the second theoretical expression, developed
after the mass continuity equation, gives another result for the
efflux velocity:

V0 = C2

(2)

where C2 is the coefficient shown in Table 2, fp is the percent-
age of installed engine power during the docking and undocking
manoeuvring, which is 0.15 according to PIANC (2015) and 0.4
according to Puertos del Estado (2012).

Mujal-Colilles, Gironella, Jaquet, Gomez-Gesteira, and
Sanchez-Arcilla (2015) conclude that the results obtained using
both expressions are overestimating real efflux velocity, par-
ticularly for the case of Eq. (1). However, in the cases where

3 Results and discussion

The data described in the previous section were used as a refer-
ence to assess the equations presented in the previous section.
The clearance height between the harbour basin bottom and
the propeller tip is 5 m and the wall distance is assumed to be
around 2 m.

Constraining values for the expressions above are only given
for laboratory results and will not be considered, initially, to
obtain the total erosion depth in the real case. The first hypoth-
esis is that the real data correspond to an asymptotic state, at
least in the NE dock where the ship docked daily for more
than two years. The maximum scouring depth in this area is
around 5 m, as seen in Fig. 4. These data are important as some
of the proposed equations detailed in Table 3 use time as a
predictor variable. However, both Hamill et al. (1999), Hamill
(1987) and Hong, Chiew, Susanto, and Cheng (2012) define
an experimental time for the asymptotic state. Therefore, the

asymptotic state reached in the real data are compared to results
yielded by Eqs (5–8), using their reference time scale with a
1/25 geometric scale.

Results of the predicted maximum erosion depth due to pro-
peller effects are shown in Fig. 5. For unconfined jets, the
formula proposed by Hamill (1987), Eq. (5), underestimates the
real case study values whereas all the other expressions clearly
overestimate the measured values. Moreover, the use of Eq. (6)
to compute the maximum scouring depth for confined jets is
also out of a realistic range, although it was proposed to cor-
rect Eq. (5). However, a detailed sensitivity analysis performed
on Eq. (6) suggests that only higher values of d50 will yield
results closer to the expected eroded depth. In terms of appli-
cability of the proposed equations, only Eqs (9) and (5) provide
a sensitive result, including a safety factor, although none of the
constraining conditions are fulfilled.

A physical model, with scaling geometric variables with
a ratio 1/25, is used to check the applicability of the same

Figure 5 Results obtained using empirical equations to predict the maximum scouring depth, d∞, at the example harbour basin

real data

equations (Fig. 6). The sediment diameter in the labora-
tory is not scaled following the geometric scale due to the
experimental limitations and finally a sediment grain size of
d50 = 0.25 × 10−4 m was used in the experiments presented
herein. Results are all closer to the expected maximum ero-
sion depth, between 0.8 and 2 m, except Eq. (8) from Puertos
del Estado (2012). In this case, the constraining conditions are
mostly satisfied for Eqs (5), (9), (10) and (13). Again, as for the
field results, Eq. (6) yields values that do not reflect the reality
of the situation. A more detailed study of this equation shows
high sensitivity to the clearance distance and the sediment grain
size, compared to other equations.

4 Conclusions

The detailed study of real bathymetric data allowed trend lines
to be obtained for the behaviour of a daily berthing vessel. If the
docking frequency is constant, the scouring rate is also constant,
representing 1.2 m every 100 docking and undocking manoeu-
vres. The maximum scouring, reached after almost two years
of daily berthing and 600 manoeuvres, is of the order of the
propeller diameter.

The influence of quay walls, studied throughout confined
jets, was revealed to be less significant than pitch and rudder
effects when the bathymetries were correlated with manoeuvring
trajectories.

For harbour authorities to prevent and correct the scouring
action of vessels during docking and undocking manoeuvring,
only three of the formulas described in the literature are rec-
ommended. Most of the empirical and theoretical expressions
described herein are useful for physical model studies but are
clearly influenced by a scaling factor and are, therefore, not use-
ful for real cases. The formulas that harbour authorities can use,
keeping in mind that they already include a security factor, are:

• equations for unconfined propeller jets: Hong et al. (2013)
with Eq. (7);

• equations for confined propeller jets: Hamill et al. (1999) with
Eq. (9), but using the first expression described by Hamill
(1987) to compute the scouring action of an unconfined
propeller jet, Eq. (5);

• equations for local scouring of a jet: Hong et al. (2012) with
Eq. (10).

Finally, further research is clearly needed on the scouring
effect of vessels during docking and undocking manoeuvring,
using field data instead of the physical model data. However,
due to limitations of field data, physical models should be used
in addition to field measurements, but always adding a scaling
factor to the expressions stated for experimental data. The use
of numerical models may be restricted due to limited knowledge
of the initial conditions; that is, the detailed knowledge of the
efflux velocity including the rotational aspects of the flow pro-
duced by the propellers. Composite models may also be useful

in order to study real cases and reduce the costs of the field data
acquisition.
