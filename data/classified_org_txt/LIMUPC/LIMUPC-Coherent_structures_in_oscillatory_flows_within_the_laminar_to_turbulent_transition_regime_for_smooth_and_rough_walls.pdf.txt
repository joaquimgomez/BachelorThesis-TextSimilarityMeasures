ABSTRACT
We investigate coherent structures present in oscillatory boundary layers over smooth and rough beds for Reynolds numbers between 103 and 104,
in the transition to turbulence regime. A two-camera 2D- particle image velocimetry (PIV) system was used to visualize coherent structures in an
oscillatory-flow tunnel. The obtained results show that smooth-bed flow is populated by vortex-tube structures that are formed due to the Kelvin–
Helmholtz instability. Three types of coherent structures are observed in the rough-wall experiments: vortices randomly distributed in space; turbulent
bursts – spatial structures without a clear shape compared to vortices but with a longer life than the former; and shear layers of vortices originating
due to flow separation from some of the grains on the bed. The reported study contributes to the description of coherent structures in oscillatory flows
that are captured with the PIV technique, particularly a new structure in flows over rough beds in the transition to turbulence regime.

Keywords: Boundary layer turbulence; coherent structures; oscillatory flows; particle image velocimetry (PIV); transition to
turbulence

1 Introduction

Unsteady flows are of great importance owing to their preva-
lence in nature and industry. Due to the difficulties in studying
unsteady flows, canonical cases have been used to characterize,
for example, acceleration and deceleration phases. Oscillatory
flows are of particular interest because of their relevance in
the study of biological processes such as human breathing
cycles, nutrient cycling in plants, and also the physical pro-
cesses involving sediment transport under wave action. These

flows have additionally received a great deal of attention due to
their simple driving mechanisms.

Laminar oscillatory flows were first studied in the context
of the Stokes boundary layer with the theoretical foundations
developed by Lamb (1932) and Batchelor (1967). Experimental
studies began with the work by Li (1954) who first attempted
to parameterize the relevant flow regimes. Kamphuis (1975)
focused his experiments on the friction factor effects under oscil-
latory flows where he developed a Moody-type diagram and
a corresponding flow regime distribution chart. More recently,

Pedocchi and Garcia (2009) proposed a methodology for esti-
mating the friction coefficient in oscillatory flows in the transi-
tion from hydraulically smooth to fully rough flow conditions.
Several authors have carried out many more experiments under
a wide range of Reynolds numbers (R = AU0m/υ, where A is the
amplitude of oscillation and U0m is the maximum free-stream
velocity) and different wall conditions (e.g. Hino, Nakayama,
Kashiwayanagi, & Hara, 1983; Jensen, Sumer, & Fredsoe, 1989;
Jonsson, 1980; Sleath, 1987; Sumer, Jensen, & Fredsoe, 1987).
Many of these previous studies focused on defining oscillatory
flows using an approach analogous to that typically used for
steady flow scenarios. For instance, Jonsson (1980) was the first
to propose a time-dependent logarithmic law that is valid for
most of the flow phases in the turbulent regime. This formu-
lation was improved by Sleath (1987) with a larger number of
experiments, and further by Jensen et al. (1989).

Several studies have specifically focused on the existence of
turbulence in oscillatory smooth- and rough-wall flows over a
range of R (e.g. Blondeaux, Scandura, & Vittori, 2004; Hino
et al., 1983; Jensen et al., 1989; Sleath, 1987). In general, it is
understood that turbulence appears during the latter stages of the
acceleration phases and is maintained during the deceleration
half cycle. At the early stages of the acceleration phase, flow
can revert back to the laminar regime depending on R.

Coherent structures are a key feature of any transitional or
fully turbulent flow. They drive transport and mixing processes
as well as induce significant drag at solid surfaces. In the con-
text of oscillatory flows, a recent study by Carstensen, Sumer,
and Fredsøe (2010) highlights the existence of such coherent
motions in the transitional regime. They described two differ-
ent structures depending on R. The first type, termed vortex
tubes (for R < 3 × 105), appears as 2D spanwise-rotating tubes
emerging at the end of the deceleration phase, and disappear-
ing during the later stages of the acceleration phase. Carstensen
et al. (2010) hypothesized that these vortex tubes originated due
to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability that develops in the shear
layer at motion phases prior to the flow reversal. The second
observed structure, termed turbulent spots (R > 1.5 × 105), is
highly three-dimensional (3D) in shape and appeared randomly
in space in a manner similar to that in the classical transitional

boundary-layer flows (i.e. with a unidirectional free-stream).
Mazzuoli, Vittori, and Blondeaux (2011) utilized numerical
simulations to study the origin of the latter structures, follow-
ing the scheme used previously by Vittori and Verzicco (1998)
and Costamagna, Vittori, and Blondeaux (2003).

For oscillatory rough-wall flow, Jensen et al. (1989)
described the revealed structures as jets and bursts, with the
former being specifically associated with individual rough-
ness elements and occurring at specific phases (Sleath, 1987).
Fornarelli and Vittori (2009) performed numerical simulations
over a rough wall formed by a periodic pattern of hemispheres
following the experiments of Keiller and Sleath (1976). Both
studies described the formation of near-wall shear layers during
the acceleration phases, similar to the jets described previously
by Sleath (1987).

The present study utilized planar particle-image velocimetry
(PIV) to capture the coherent flow structures present in oscilla-
tory flows under the laminar to turbulent transition regime over
smooth and rough beds in the streamwise–wall-normal plane.
The formation, evolution and life of the observed structures
were identified within the PIV velocity fields acquired within
the transition-to-turbulent regime using periodic oscillatory con-
ditions. The smooth-wall results reveal structures consistent
with the vortex tubes described by Carstensen et al. (2010).
However, as the experiments presented herein employ steady
oscillations with a fixed period, phase-averaging methods are
exploited to describe the coherent structures at specific phases
of the oscillatory flow.

2 Experimental set-up

Experiments were conducted in the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems
Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
in a U-shaped oscillatory flow water tunnel (Admiraal,
García, & Musalem, 2004). Figure 1 presents a sketch of the
flume which has a working section approximately 0.25 m high,
0.20 m wide, and 4 m long. The surface and side walls are made
of smooth transparent Perspex which facilitates optical access to
the flow from the sides and above, while the bed upon which the

Journal of Hydraulic Research (2016) Coherent structures in oscillatory flows 3

smooth-wall oscillatory boundary layers developed is composed
of a bare polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plate. Gravel was glued to
the surface of the PVC plate for the rough bed scenarios.

The oscillatory flow was driven by an Exlar electrical actu-
ator powering a piston located at the downstream end of theQ10
flume. The actuator was controlled by a computer through
a National Instruments card and a custom program devisedQ11
with LabView which generated a repeatable sinusoidal motion.

Q12 Cycles were recorded continuously without stopping the actu-
ator, but not consecutively and so they must be considered
independent experimental runs. The sinusoidal motion was set
using an amplitude control (accuracy to within 0.1 mm) and a
period control with 1 μs accuracy. A honeycomb structure was
placed across the entire cross-section at the upstream inlet of the
flume to suppress flow disturbances generated at the junction of
the flume and the equilibrium chimney. The laser sheet mea-
surement section was positioned far from the transition between
Perspex and PVC to ensure uniform flow characteristics at each
phase (Admiraal et al., 2004).

Table 1 describes the flow conditions measured for the
three bed scenarios: a smooth bed, a small-grain rough bed
(D50 = 1.5 mm, σ D = 1.3 mm) and a large-grain rough bed
(with D50 = 7.0 mm, σ D = 1.2 mm). In Table 1, T is the period
of the oscillation and δ is the measured height of the boundary
layer (Mujal-Colilles, Mier, Christensen, Bateman, & Garcia,
2013). In terms of nomenclature, scenarios refer to the three
different wall conditions (smooth, small roughness and large
roughness), while cases refer to the four R values used in each
scenario. The term test refers to a case-scenario combination.

Figure 2 categorizes all flow regimes studied herein using
the classification of Kamphuis (1975). The smooth-wall sce-
narios fall close to the line dividing the laminar and turbulent
regimes. Although the limits between these regimes are not per-
fectly defined, measured velocity profiles show how Tests 3
and 4 may be considered in the laminar regime whereas Tests
1 and 2 appear to be in the laminar-to-turbulent transition zone.
However, in real terms all smooth-wall scenarios shall be con-
sidered to be in the laminar-to-turbulent regime, as reported by

Figure 2 Diagram defining the flow regime (adopted from Kamphuis,
1975). Smooth wall scenarios are close to the R values separating the
laminar regime from the transition regime. Smaller bed roughness sce-
narios are within the transition to rough turbulent and finally larger
bed roughness scenarios fall close to the border between the transition
regime and the rough turbulent

Mujal-Colilles et al. (2013). Scenarios tested with the smaller
roughness clearly sit within the smooth-to-rough transition
zone. Finally, the larger roughness scenarios fall within the
rough turbulent regime but in a region very close to the tran-
sition zone, suggesting that most of the oscillatory phases in
our study are likely within the transition zone with only a few
extending into the rough turbulent regime. A detailed discussion
of these flow regime classifications for the present experiments
can be found in Mujal-Colilles et al. (2013).

Instantaneous velocity fields were measured at the centre-
span of the tunnel using a planar PIV system consisting of a
Gemini PIV Nd:YAG pulse laser (New Wave Research) and Q13
two 4 MPx, 12-bit frame-straddle charge-coupled device (CCD)
cameras (TSI Inc.). The two cameras were set on opposite Q14
sides of the flume and offset in the streamwise direction so that
the individual fields of view overlapped by 6.3 mm (Fig. 3) to
facilitate a wide composite streamwise field of view. Each cam-
era was mounted to an aluminium frame and set 55 cm from

Figure 3 Top view of the experimental set-up: camera locations. Two 4 Mpx CCD cameras were used

the measurement plane defined by the laser light sheet. The
combined field of view was 4 cm high and 8 cm long [wall-
normal (y) by streamwise (x)]. The light sheet had a thickness of
0.5 mm at the channel bottom, and was optimized with a com-
bination of cylindrical and spherical lenses with focal lengths of
15 mm and 500 mm, respectively. The tracer particles used for
the PIV measurements were Sphericel® hollow glass spheres
of 1 μm mean diameter and a density of 1.1 g-cm−3 (Potter
Industries Inc.).Q15

Table 1 summarizes all test conditions analysed for the
smooth and rough scenarios. The velocity U0m represents the
amplitude of the free stream velocity defined as:

U0(ωt) = −U0mcos(ωt) (1)

including a negative value at t = 0, due to the free-stream velo-
city initial motion from right to left in the field of view. Here,
ω = 2π /T represents the angular frequency of the oscillation.
The results obtained using the boundary layer height, δ, follow-
ing a definition offered by Sumer et al. (1987), are shown in
Table 1.

Measurements were made at a sampling rate of 7.25 Hz,
which was the maximum acquisition frequency allowed by the
PIV system. Thus, the initial periods of oscillation considered
(T = 5, 3, and 2 s) were adjusted proportionally to the sam-
pling rate to exactly fit the number of phases recorded in a
cycle. Therefore, each experiment has a number of recorded
image pairs proportional to 12; this represents an increment in
phase between samples of 10° when T = 5.007 s, 15° when
T = 3.338 s and 30° when T = 1.669 s. Sixty cycles were
recorded for each scenario, a number slightly larger than the
proposed by Sleath (1987) for convergence of mean statistics.

Analysis of the PIV image pairs was accomplished using
the Insight 8 software (TSI Inc.). The final interrogation win-
dow size for all experimental runs was 16 × 16 px2, which was
obtained by applying a recursive interrogation approach with an
original interrogation window size of 64 × 64 px2. Nyquist’s
criterion was satisfied in all interrogation steps, meaning that
the final interrogation area of 16 × 16 px2 overlapped by 50%
yielded a vector grid spacing of 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm in the final
velocity fields. A local validation was performed between the
recursive passes in order to eliminate erroneous vectors. Final
validation was performed using three local median valida-
tions of different sizes, and two replacement steps for initially

eliminated vectors, the last of which was performed using a
smoothing window size of 3 × 3 grid points. The interrogation
process was conducted separately for each camera image fol-
lowed by a final merging of frames at the vector field level. The
overlap between the camera fields of view was obtained with a
simple matching code meant to minimize differences between
the right and the left vector fields in the overlapping region. The
final merging process consisted of a smooth transition between
the two fields, thus avoiding any transition region in the middle
of the composite field of view.

3 Results

Phase averaging from the 60 cycles acquired, as suggested
by (Sleath, 1987), is used to explore phase-dependent flow
behaviour for the various scenarios considered herein. In this
context, the velocity fields can be analysed as a function of
phase as:

U0(ωt) = −U0mcos(ωt)
Ui(x, y, ωt) = −Uim(x, y)cos(ωt)

U(x, y, ωt) = 1
N

∑

i

Ui(x, y, ωt)

U(x, y, ωt) = −Um(x, y)cos(ωt)

(2)

where the superscript i denotes the cycle, the subscript m is the
maximum value of U, and ω is the frequency of the oscillation.
Turbulence quantities were first computed for each fluctuation
field and then averaged over the 60 cycles as shown below for
the case of the Reynolds stress:

u′v′(x, y, ωt) = 1
N

∑

i

[(Ui(x, y, ωt) − U(x, y, ωt))

× (Vi(x, y, ωt) − V(x, y, ωt))] (3)

The overbar indicates phase averaged variables and will only
be used in this paper for velocity fluctuations (i.e. turbulence
intensities). The rest of the variables are assumed to be phase-
averaged and overbar is omitted throughout the document.

The variable used herein to visualize the coherent structures
within the planar PIV velocity fields is the swirling strength,

Journal of Hydraulic Research (2016) Coherent structures in oscillatory flows 5

Adrian, Christensen, and Liu (2000) for vortex core identifica-
tion in planar velocity fields. It is frame-independent and only
identifies regions of local flow rotation in contrast to vorticity,
which can be tainted by regions of intense shear as are often
present in the near-wall regions of the wall-bounded flows under
study (Adrian et al., 2000; Wu & Christensen, 2006).

3.1 Smooth wall

Carstensen et al. (2010) defined two different types of
coherent structures for oscillatory flows with increasing
velocity amplitude over smooth-wall beds: vortex tubes
(7 × 104 < R < 3 × 105) and turbulent spots (R > 1.5 × 105).
The ranges of R studied herein are below the limits described by
Carstensen et al. (2010) for both structures (Table 1). Neverthe-
less, streamwise-averaged turbulence intensities plotted in Fig. 4
reveal the existence of significant velocity fluctuations in these
tests which implies the possible existence of underlying coher-
ent structures. As expected, higher levels of turbulence inten-
sities are present at later phases of the acceleration half cycle
(90° < ωt < 180°), which are maintained during the deceler-
ation cycle (0° < ωt < 90°). In all smooth-wall tests, lower
levels of turbulence coincide with the wall-flow reversal in
the range 60° < ωt < 90°, as detailed previously by Batchelor
(1967) and several experimental studies (e.g. Carstensen et al.,
2010; Jensen et al., 1989).

The main driver in the formation of vortex tubes, as discussed
in Carstensen et al. (2010), is the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability
which develops at the interface between two layers of the same
fluid flow at dissimilar velocities (including in opposite direc-
tions). This scenario results in the formation of a peak in the
vertical profile of the viscous shear stress. The location of this
peak may indicate the position of the centre of the vortex tube if
the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability is fulfilled. Figure 5 presents
the streamwise total shear-stress vertical profile obtained for
Test 2 (only half a cycle is plotted but it is representative of
the entire period of oscillation, being symmetric for the rest of
the cycle). Although Test 2 is within the laminar-to-turbulent

regime, Mujal-Colilles et al. (2013) reported low levels of tur-
bulence in the vicinity of the wall. Therefore, beyond the first
point closer to the wall, the total shear stress is entirely due to
viscous effects and the profiles in Fig. 5 can be fit with the sec-
ond derivative of the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS)
streamwise velocity profile equation for laminar oscillatory flow
over smooth beds:

U0(y, ωt) = −U0m[cos(ωt) − eδ1ycos(ωt − δ1y)] (4)

where δ1 =
√

νT/π is the Stokes length.
Using Eq. (4) after some mathematical manipulation, the

conditions for the existence of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability
holds when d2U0/dy2 = 0 and (U – U0)d2U/dy2 < 0 (Cushman-
Roisin, Gualteri, & Mihailovic, 2008). According to several
previous studies (e.g. Carstensen et al., 2010; Jensen, 1988;
Mujal-Colilles et al., 2013), the flow reversal close to the wall
occurs between ωt = 60° and ωt = 90°, coincident with the for-
mation of a new peak seen in the total shear stress profile as
indicated in Fig. 5. Pedocchi et al. (2011) described the pres- Q1
ence of shear layers emerging during the deceleration phases as
inflection points in the phase-averaged velocity profiles. These
shear layers become more intense when the flow reverses close
to the wall and are linked to zero shear stress at the interface
between the shear layers. At ωt = 90°, the shear-stress profile
presents a clear peak around y/δ ≈ 0.2 that propagates away
from the wall during subsequent phases. This inflection point is
still visible for ωt = 0° at y/δ ≈ 0.4 and continues migrating
while sharpening, until ωt = 60°, where the cycle begins again.
However, the phase ωt = 90° shows the existence of a new
peak as well as the prevalence of the maximum at y/δ ≈ 0.75
from the previous cycle with opposite sign, which slowly dis-
sipates in magnitude while migrating upwards. This behaviour
indicates that two types of vortex tubes may be simultaneously

present in the flow: “new” structures created during the cur-
rent flow reversal close to the wall, and “old” structures formed
during flow reversal at an earlier phase migrating upwards and
dissipating.

The snapshots of the phase-averaged swirling strength com-
pared with the streamwise-averaged vertical shear stress profiles
are helpful to better describe the formation and lifetime of the
vortex tubes. In Fig. 6a, both peaks in shear stress correspond
exactly to the centres of structures located at y/δ ≈ 0.2 and
y/δ ≈ 0.75 noted in the phase-averaged swirling-strength field.
Moreover, the height of zero shear stress location coincides
with the division between these layers of swirling strength and
indicates the division between the “old” and the “new” vortex
tubes. In Fig. 6b, the negative peak in the shear-stress profiles
is smoothed and the swirling strength snapshots show some
residual turbulence but devoid of spatial coherence. Finally, in

Fig. 6c, the upper peak has almost disappeared from the shear-
stress profile and no regions of non-zero swirling strength are
present beyond y/δ ≈ 1.0. These observations are entirely con-
sistent with the existence of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability
leading to the formation of vortex tubes.

The presence of “old” and “new” vortex tubes at the same
phase suggests that the life of these structures is longer than half
a cycle. Figure 7 presents the correlation of swirling strength
(background variable) and vorticity (colour contours) of the first
half cycle (note that the entire cycle is actually represented
because ωt > 180° is symmetric in the plots of Fig. 7a–f).
Figure 7a shows the vortex tubes that were already created dur-
ing the wall flow reversal of the previous half cycle, ωt < 0°.
New vortex tubes are created during the wall flow reversal in
Fig. 7c and d at y/δ ≈ 0.2. These vortices grow in size while
they remain close to the wall, but the centre of the tubes moves

Therefore, the life of the vortex tubes appears to be in the
range ωt ≈ 60° to ωt < 300°, representing three quarters of
a cycle. Carstensen et al. (2010) reported that the vortex tubes
they detected survived less than a quarter of a cycle, being dissi-
pated around ωt ≈ 120° based on dye-based flow visualization.
This observation may be biased by dilution of the dye owing
to intense mixing and thus a lower estimate of vortex lifetime
compared to that reported herein.

3.2 Rough wall

Few studies have considered the existence of structures in
rough-wall oscillatory boundary layers. The first experimental
work of Keiller and Sleath (1976) focused on regular rough sur-
faces using hemispheres. This was later reproduced numerically
by Fornarelli and Vittori (2009) who also compared their results
to another experimental work carried out using square rough-
ness elements (Krstic & Fernando, 2002). Sleath (1987) and
Jensen et al. (1989) revealed the existence of jets of fluid ema-
nating from irregular sediment beds, indicating the possibility of
coherent structures created close to the bed and ejected outward
during the oscillatory motion.

The recent experimental study of Carstensen, Sumer, and
Fredsøe (2012) describes the existence of turbulent spots in
the range 5 × 104 < R < 105 motivated by their original work
with smooth-wall oscillatory boundary layers (Carstensen et al.,
2010). Turbulent spots were first described for unidirectional
flow by Emmons (1951) as structures that are formed after
strong fluctuations randomly positioned in space. Hladík, Jonáš,
and Uruba (2011) presented PIV measurements that offered a
detailed description of turbulent spots in both side and plan
views. As with the present smooth-wall conditions, the present
rough-wall conditions do not fall within the limits described by

Carstensen et al. (2012) for the formation of turbulent spots.
Moreover, the lack of plan information in the current work does
not allow us to confirm the existence of turbulent spots which
have a well-defined character in plain view. Thus, though we
identify spatial structures in the side-view PIV velocity fields
that share some consistency with turbulent spots, we instead
simply refer to them as turbulent bursts, which reflects the
occurrence of spatially-coherent events associated with strong
and intermittent turbulent behaviour in the side views presented
herein.

The analysis performed to describe the coherent structures
for rough-wall experiments follows the same procedures as the
previous analysis for the smooth-wall experiments. The use of
the phase-averaging may erase imprints of instantaneous tur-
bulent spots, as described by Carstensen et al. (2010). On the
other hand, the existence of regions with the consistent swirling
strength can be explained by assuming that the same type of
structure is being formed in the vicinity of the same location for
all experiments, as will be detailed below.

Observations for the two different irregular rough beds
showed three types of coherent structures:

(1) vortices: structures created during the wall flow reversal that
are ejected as vortices and ultimately become bursts;

(2) turbulent bursts: structures that emerge like vortices during
the flow reversal at the wall but are not strong enough to
maintain coherence; these structures are ejected as bursts
and reach lower heights compared to vortices 0; Q16

(3) shear layers: these features were only detected in experi-
ments with A/ (2D50) < 15, and consist of several vortices
shed continuously from particular grains at the wall; at
the wall flow reversal stages, vortices 0 are formed at the
same distance from the remaining structure of the shear
layer.

Vortices

In the present rough-wall experiments, vortices are formed
during the flow reversal close to the wall, exhibiting similar
characteristics as the vortex tubes described in section 0 for
smooth-wall flow. However, several differences arise due to the
presence of a rough bed.

The formation process of a representative vortex is plotted
in Fig. 8 which presents the phase-averaged velocity field com-
puted from 60 independent cycles of Test 6 (see supplementary
material Test 6), with the small roughness and an amplitude-
roughness ratio A/ks = 33. Therefore, the detection of a vortex

in the phase-averaged flow fields indicates the existence of this
vortex, with similar spatial characteristics, in a large number of
the instantaneous velocity fields at that phase. In the vicinity of
a grain, flow separation occurs around ωt = 70° and forms a
clear vortex. In contrast to vortex tubes formed in smooth-wall
oscillatory flows, the phenomena associated with the origin of
vortices in rough wall flows is clearly related to negative pres-
sure gradients just downstream of some sediment grains, and
therefore the location of vortex formation is directly correlated
to specific grains of the bed. Locally, the detachment of the
boundary layer at the top of the grains, seen in Fig. 8a, cre-
ates a wake transformed into a vortex due to the flow reversal
close to the wall, which is clearly seen in Fig. 8b and c. Once
the flow close to the wall is fully reversed (Fig. 8c), the detach-
ment of the boundary layer at the top of the same grain occurs
in the opposite direction compared to Fig. 8a. In other stud-
ies, including Fornarelli and Vittori (2009), with regular rough
walls, vortices were formed behind all hemispheres during the
wall flow reversal. Herein, there exists a preferential formation
of vortices from specific grain features owing to the irregularity
of the bed roughness considered.

After being formed, these vortices detach from the wall and
migrate upwards until a certain height with progression in phase.
Figure 9 presents the evolution and dissipation of the same vor-
tex shown in Fig. 8, where the vortex is highlighted with a
red ellipse. The vortex sheds from the wall at ωt = 90° and
loses some of its spatial coherence. Before dissipating around
ωt = 130°, the vortex travels as a simple burst along a well-
defined upward path. Only two clear vortices are formed within
this field of view, although one can identify other features in
these fields that will be addressed later.

These results are consistent with the numerical observations
of Fornarelli and Vittori (2009), particularly that vortices are
formed behind specific sediment grains where pressure is mini-
mum during the near-wall flow reversal, but pressure gradients
are higher. Krstic and Fernando (2002) described a dipole-like

vortex formed during the wall flow reversal which was not
detected in any of the cases presented herein. This may be
attributable to the shape of the cubic roughness elements used
by Krstic and Fernando (2002) which may have led to the for-
mation of a second vortex after the first vortex was formed. In
fact, the shedding process of the dipole-like vortices described
by Krstic and Fernando (2002) coincides with that shown in
Fig. 9 in which vortices are elongated while propelling from the
wall. Vortices were present in all the experiments, with vortices
trajectories not differing from the ones described for Test 6.

Figure 10 presents the phase evolution of the streamwise and
wall-normal positions of the vortex centre, defined here as the
centre of the zone with constant swirling strength (T l2ci > 50).
In general, larger roughness scenarios resulted in longer vortex
burst lifetimes. Clear distinctions can be seen for the different
bed scenarios, but among all tests there is similarity in profiles
belonging to tests with the larger A/ks ratio (Test 5 and Test 6;
Test 7 and Test 8). Focusing on the streamwise vortex displace-
ment with phase, Fig. 10a, higher velocities at latter stages are
found in tests with larger amplitude, regardless of the rough-
ness size of the bed (Test5 and Test 6; Test 9 and Test 10;
see also supplementary material Text 10). This is likely due
to the fact that the vertical location of the vortices is further
from the wall where the mean streamwise velocity is also higher.
The evolution of the vertical vortex position (Fig. 10b) displays
an inflection point close to the free-stream flow reversal stages
(ωt = 90°), indicating that the detachment from the wall is com-
plete by this phase. This is more notable for higher-amplitude
experiments with a small roughness bed size (Test 5 and Test 6).
The evolution of the vertical position combined with the hori-
zontal displacement shows that higher horizontal velocities are
reached once the detachment complete. The dependence of the
vortex horizontal and vertical position evolution on the ampli-
tude (Fig. 10b), as well as on the roughness size, shows that
these two variables can be defined as characteristic lengths of
the flow.

Turbulent bursts

Turbulent bursts are defined separately from vortices due to their
different spatial characteristics in the phase-averaged velocity
fields. Figure 9 displays the trajectory of a turbulent burst (green
square), compared to the vortex trajectory in Test 6 with small

roughness elements. It is important to highlight that Fig. 9, like
Fig. 8, presents phase-averaged swirling strength fields. Thus,
the representation of a turbulent burst in the phase-averaged
flow field is likely the result of several vortices forming near
the same position but being offset in different cycles. However,
when we look at each experiment, the zone where a turbulent
burst is located does not show a clear vortex, indicating that it is
indeed a burst.

The first difference between turbulent bursts and vortices
described in the previous section is the coherence of the vortex
itself. That is, bursts may be created as vortices but the coher-
ence of the vortex is lost even before the structure detaches
from the wall. Also, some of the turbulent bursts are not born
as a clear vortex but rather simply as a spatially-coherent region
of high turbulence levels. The trajectory of turbulent bursts is
similar to that of vortices. They are created close to the wall dur-
ing the near-wall flow reversal, and shed from the wall rapidly.
However, turbulent bursts reach higher elevations than vortices
once they have been shed from the wall, as seen in Fig. 9. The
snapshot presented in Fig. 9d shows the existence of three vor-
tices moving at a central height of about y/δ ≈ 1.0 and two
bursts at a height y/δ ≈ 0.5.

The location of turbulent bursts relative to vortices is thought
to be random. Other experiments do not show this pattern which
may be related both to the shape of the gravel particles and
the specific characteristics of the flow regime. It is important
to recall that experiments performed with the small roughness
sediment bed have been characterized as flows in the laminar-
to-turbulent transition, and that flows with the larger roughness
are closer to the rough-wall flow regime. Therefore, none of the
flows are fully rough when turbulent bursts and vortices are cre-
ated during the wall flow reversal, and so the bed roughness
has a significant influence on the location and evolution of the
structures formed near the wall.

Figures 11 and 12 show the same snapshots as Fig. 9 detail-
ing the position of the vortices and the turbulent bursts along a
quarter of a cycle where both are formed, shed from the wall
and move with the flow. From Fig. 11, where the distribution
of the total shear stress is shown, another difference between
vortices and turbulent bursts can be identified, whereby peaks
of shear stresses occur near the centre of a vortex, particu-
larly at the early stages of inception. On the other hand, no

large gradients of velocity are detected coincident with the loca-
tions of turbulent bursts. In addition, higher values of shear
stress vanish after ωt = 110◦ which coincides with the phase
when vortices lose their spatial coherence and begin behaving
as bursts (Fig. 9). In Fig. 12, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is
plotted as the background variable showing how vortices con-
centrate maximum values of TKE on their upper-right sides
in the direction of the flow at each phase. Likewise, turbulent
bursts have higher values of TKE at their leading edge. How-
ever, the highest values of TKE are found in locations coincident
with vortices, showing that these features concentrate larger
amount of turbulence which, in turn, contributes to their longer
lifetimes. This last observation represents another fundamental
difference between turbulent bursts and vortices: the levels of
turbulence are higher in vortex structures and persist longer than
the same for turbulent bursts.

Carstensen et al. (2012) described turbulent spots as
3D structures randomly located in the plan view that form close
to the wall during the wall flow reversal. Carstensen et al. (2010)
reported that turbulent spots first occur during the bed shear
stress reversal, grow in size and eventually merge together.
Spikes in the shear stress signal were detected when the tur-
bulent spot passed over a hot-film probe in their experiments.
Mazzuoli et al. (2011) performed 3D numerical simulations and
described the turbulent spots in oscillatory flow over smooth
beds in the vertical plane. Based on previous descriptions,
the structures detected in this research have been found to
present similar characteristics in the side-view plane as the ones
described by Mazzuoli et al. (2011) for smooth-wall conditions,
mainly in the evolution of the structure once it has detached
from the wall. However, as seen in Fig. 11, higher values of
the shear stress are found to coincide with vortices rather than

turbulent bursts. Bearing in mind that the present analysis is
based on phase averaging of 60 cycles, at an instantaneous cycle
the shear stress could be as high as the one for the vortex coher-
ent structure, but spatial intermittency coupled with the phase
averaging may somewhat suppress this result.

Shear layers

Shear-layer signatures are only present in the experiments with
larger roughness elements, D50 = 7.0 mm (Tests 9, 10, 11
and 12) and are found to be related to vortices and turbulent
bursts. However, in the vicinity of the grains, the flow is stronger
at smaller roughness for vortices to be shed and therefore, the
flow conditions for larger roughness experiments are not strong
enough to cause flow separation from all the grains in the same
magnitude as it does for smaller roughness experiments.

Shear layers consist of a sequence of vortices shed from
specific grains of the rough wall. This is observed in Fig. 13a
where a shear layer is formed at the location x ≈ 25 mm. This
signature is linked to vortices described previously as a single
coherent structure: the shear layer forms after the generation of

multiple single vortices shedding from the vicinity of a particu-
lar grain during the acceleration phases. Thereafter (ωt > 0), the
angle of the shear layer increases until the onset of the wall flow
reversal (Fig. 13a, b and c). At this phase, the vortex is formed
with the remaining turbulence from the shear layer and shed
from the wall during latter phases (Fig. 13d, e and f). Simul-
taneously, another shear layer forms from a different grain with
an opposite directional sense and grows continuously until the
maximum free-stream velocity phase. During the acceleration
process, the shear layer grows in size instead of increasing in
angle as no significant angle can be identified at the early stages Q17
of initiation.

Q3It is not entirely clear if the shear layer shown in Fig. 13a
is originated from a single grain. In a closer view of Fig. 13a
shear layers, previously described, seem to originate from more
than one grain of sediment. In fact, when observing previous
stages in detail in Fig. 15, the shear layer is formed from one
grain at early stages of the acceleration quarter cycle, when
the flow is laminar. Then, as the free-stream flow and near
wall velocity increase, the shear-layer covers the grain reach-
ing the next grain similar to that in Fig. 13e. Thereafter, once

the local velocity has increased, the shear layer detaches from
the wall at the second grain (Fig. 15a) as a vortex. In Fig. 15b,
the boundary layer formed at the original grain is detached but
does not have enough energy to shed from the wall until it
reaches a third grain in Fig. 15c. Finally, when the free-stream
flow is at maximum, the shear layer becomes stable without
any waviness and is comprised of several vortices from dif-
ferent grains, although the boundary layer detaches originally
from one grain. Other tests showed similar behaviour on the ini-
tiation and development of the shear layer. Moreover, higher
Reynolds number cases showed a complete development of the
shear layer at previous phases. Finally, the fact that vortices are
shed from certain grains at pre-flow reversal and other grains at
post-flow reversal implies that the specific shape of the grains
upstream and downstream of the local oncoming flow plays a
defining role in determining whether local flow separation will
occur.

4 Conclusions

The PIV experiments detailed herein facilitated the study of
the formation and evolution of coherent structures present in
oscillatory flows over smooth and rough walls. In contrast
to previous qualitative flow-visualization studies, PIV allowed
quantification of the characteristics of the underlying coherent
motions for a range of wall conditions.

Features present in oscillatory flows over a smooth wall
were confirmed to be vortex tubes, defined within the limita-
tions of 2D planar PIV. Similar to the experimental work of
Carstensen et al. (2010), features detected in the experiments
within the laminar to turbulent transition regime were formed by
the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability during the wall flow reversal.
As outlined by several authors (i.e. Jensen et al., 1989; Mujal-
Colilles et al., 2013; Sarpkaya, 1993), the flow reversal close to
the wall occurs before the free-stream flow reversal. Therefore,
there exists a gradient in the vertical velocity profiles, reflected
in the shear stress profiles, in which very low values of turbulent

stresses were detected to trigger the Kelvin–Helmholtz instabi-
lity. During the second half cycle, where another near-wall flow
reversal occurs, vortices present from the previous half cycle
merge and migrate upwards while new structures form near
the wall.

Three different coherent structures were identified in phase-
averaged representations of the rough-wall flows: vortices, tur-
bulent bursts, and shear layers. Vortices appeared during the
wall flow reversal and were shed from the wall. Beyond this
point, their coherence as a vortex disappeared and transitioned
into a burst. Thus, these bursts originated as clear vortices
close to the wall and maintained a certain height, particularly
in the smaller roughness scenarios. The trajectory of vortices
was found to depend, ultimately, on the roughness diameter
ks and the amplitude of oscillation, A, although the formation-
evolution-decease process was common in all the experiments. Q12
Thus, vortices were created during the latter stages of the
deceleration phases and ejected from the wall during early accel-
eration stages. Vortices disappeared before the next decelerating
cycle began, lasting, at most, a quarter of a cycle includ-
ing the stages in which they lost their vortex appearance and
became bursts.

The second feature defined was linked to vortices, but was
termed bursts. Bursts consisted of smaller vortices created
close together in different instantaneous fields that appeared
as a spatially-coherent region of high turbulence in the phase-
averaged snapshots. Bursts also originated at the wall but did
not extend into the flow as far as the vortices did prior to dis-
sipating. However, their life cycle was equivalent to that of the
shed vortices.

Finally, the third coherent structure observed was a shear
layer that formed during the maximum free stream velocity
stages. Shear layers were only detected in experiments with
A/ks < 15 and were linked to vortices described as the first
structure. Thus, shear layers formed just as vortices shed from
some selected grains of the irregular rough bed. Initially they
were considered laminar structures covering a single grain.
However, as the streamwise velocity increased, this attached

structure eventually detached from the grains. At this phase,
small vortices were formed, and the shear layer became a chain
of vortices formed at a specific grain, colliding into the next crest
and subsequently detaching. This was clearer at maximum free
stream velocity phases. During decelerating stages, small vor-
tices did not rebound on the following crests and the shear layer
instead became a large vortex during the wall flow reversal. This
behaviour was previously observed in experiments conducted in
the same oscillatory flow facility but in the presence of ripples
(Admiraal et al., 2004). Vortices developing in the lee side of
the ripples and later advected by the oscillatory flow were found
to play a major role in the mechanisms leading to the formation
and evolution of finite amplitude bedforms.

In all experiments, phase averaging was used to identify
structures in the mean (i.e. phase-averaged) flow which were
also present in most of the instantaneous velocity fields. For
smooth walls, this showed that vortices appear located at
the same place. In rough walls, although the roughness was
designed to be spatially uniform in its characteristics, structures
were commonly shed from the same topographical features.
This is likely due to the transitional flow regime studied herein
(laminar to turbulent) in which particular roughness features
can become important. Discrete shedding locations may also
have resulted from structures forming during phases of very
low free stream velocity. Recalling that the definition of the
flow regime (laminar/turbulent) in oscillatory flows assumes
that most of the phases are within one regime, some may be
in laminar regime (particularly the flow reversal phases), during
which features are formed and shed. It is in this situation where
anomalies in the roughness appear to trigger signatures at the
same position. It is important to highlight that structures ran-
domly distributed in space are not analysed in this work due
to the phase-averaging analysis that can mask most of them.
However, some of the features defined in this research can also
be the result of the phase averaging of small vortices located
close one to the other but not at exact same location in each
instantaneous field (i.e. turbulent bursts).
