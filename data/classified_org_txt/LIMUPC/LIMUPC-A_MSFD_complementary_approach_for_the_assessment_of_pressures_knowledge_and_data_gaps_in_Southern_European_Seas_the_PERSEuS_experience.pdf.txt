PERSEUS project aims to identify the most relevant pressures exerted on the ecosystems of the Southern
European Seas (SES), highlighting knowledge and data gaps that endanger the achievement of SES Good
Environmental Status (GES) as mandated by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). A comple-
mentary approach has been adopted, by a meta-analysis of existing literature on pressure/impact/knowl-
edge gaps summarized in tables related to the MSFD descriptors, discriminating open waters from coastal
areas. A comparative assessment of the Initial Assessments (IAs) for five SES countries has been also
independently performed. The comparison between meta-analysis results and IAs shows similarities
for coastal areas only. Major knowledge gaps have been detected for the biodiversity, marine food
web, marine litter and underwater noise descriptors. The meta-analysis also allowed the identification
of additional research themes targeting research topics that are requested to the achievement of GES.

1. Introduction key requisites of a healthy ecosystem such as diversity, food web
The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC,
European Commission 2008) (MSFD) is one of the several legal
instruments existing worldwide (Oceans Act in the USA, Australia
or Canada; EC Water Framework Directive (WFD), National Water
Act in South Africa, European Regional Sea Conventions etc.) that
have been adopted in order to protect more effectively the marine
environment. The MSFD requires that all EU Member States (MSs)
take measures to maintain or achieve Good Environmental Status
(GES) in their seas by 2020. It calls for an ‘‘ecosystem-based
approach’’ whereby management of marine activities is expected
also to protect and preserve the marine environment as a whole.
The implicit assumption is that it should be possible, at the present
level of knowledge on the functioning of the marine ecosystem, to
determine how to keep the collective pressure of human activities
within levels compatible with the preservation or restoration of
GES. This in turn implies that human pressures should not exceed
the capacity of the marine ecosystem to withstand human-induced
changes, whilst enabling the sustainable use of the marine environ-
ment now and in the future (MSFD Article 1(3)).

MSFD is innovative under several aspects if compared with pre-
vious regulatory EC directives. Contrary to the WFD, which follows
a ‘‘deconstructing structural approach’’, the MSFD follows a ‘‘holis-
tic functional approach’’ identifying the set of 11 descriptors
(Table 1), which collectively represent the state and functioning
of the whole system (Borja et al., 2008, 2010). The concept of
GES sensu MSFD integrates physical, chemical and biological
aspects, together with the services provided by ecosystems, includ-
ing elements on the sustainable use of marine resources by society.
Another difference is spatial overlapping between the MSFD and
the WFD, which covers the coastal waters only (up to 1 nautical
mile, except for chemical status, where 12-mile territorial waters
are also included) making the MSFD a new challenge for environ-
mental protection strategies for the open seas. The holistic view
of MSFD is clearly reflected in the descriptors (Table 1) that,
despite their qualitative or semi-qualitative character, address
robustness, sustainable inputs of xenobiotic substances and bio-
logical immigration or physical perturbations.

The MSFD operational approach is based on marine regions and
sub-regions according to geographical and ecological criteria, tak-
ing into account the trans-boundary nature of marine waters. EC
Member States sharing a marine region or sub-region shall coop-
erate in developing their national marine strategies to ensure
coherence and coordination (Art. 5.2, MSFD). Implementation of
the MSFD is conceived as an adaptive process. It started with an
analysis of the essential characteristics and current environmental
status, following the requirement of Article 8 of the MSFD, i.e. to
report on Initial Assessments (IAs). The IAs highlighted the ‘‘pre-
dominant pressures and impacts (including human activity)’’ on the
environmental status, the economic and social impacts regarding
the use of the marine environment and the cost of its degradation.
To be effective, IAs and further actions foreseen by the imple-
mentation of the MSFD (the monitoring phase and adoption of
proper mitigation measures), must be agreed with the stakehold-
ers at transnational level and based on solid scientific knowledge.
The effort required for producing IAs has been huge and there is
general agreement that this is only the starting point of a long-
term iterative process. Analysing the IAs reports, Laroche (2013)
and, later, Palialexis et al. (2014) demonstrated that the available
information was heterogeneous and incomplete. The methodologi-
cal approaches were diverse and highly variable among countries
depending on the descriptors selected (without common reference
standards) and the assessments have been obtained from not sig-
nificant data sets, as will discussed later in Section 4.2.

In relation to the Regional Sea Conventions (RSCs) in other
European seas, OSPAR (for the North East Atlantic Seas) and
HELCOM (for the Baltic Sea) are developing regional plans to
improve adequacy and coherence in the implementation of marine
policies. Efforts are dedicated to identify knowledge gaps and
prioritize actions in relation to MSFD, using the outcome of the
Initial Assessments performed by Member States, but also their
own regional knowledge as described in draft documents (OSPAR

COMMISSION, 20141; HELCOM, 20152). Further, OSPAR benefits
from the outcomes of FP7 STAGES project with regards to the work
done on pressures and impacts by MSFD (OSPAR Science Agenda,
OSPAR COMMISSION, 2014.3)

In parallel with the institutional activities of Member States,
FP7 PERSEUS (Policy-oriented Environmental Research in
Southern European Seas) provides an attempt to evaluate pres-
sures exerted by human activities and natural processes, identify-
ing their impacts on Mediterranean and Black Sea ecosystems,
linking them to the MSFD descriptors, criteria and indicators. The
ambition of this project is to identify the major pressures
jeopardizing the environmental state of Southern European Seas
(SES) and link them directly to possible impacts in a coherent

and integrated manner. This assessment provides an evidence-
based analysis of existing gaps in scientific knowledge in support
of a strategy to fill them.

Two further elements differentiate the project strategy from
MSFD IAs: the trans-national dimension (i.e. involvement of scien-
tists from different countries, even beyond EU borders, in the
evaluation process) and a knowledge synthesis strategy, meaning
that the meta-analysis was not driven by the need to comply with
MSFD indicators but by the intention to connect the descriptors to
known mechanisms or to highlight knowledge gaps as regards the
link. The knowledge synthesis strategy aims at distilling required
information from data, refining the process from one level to the
subsequent one (Fig. 1), as will be discussed further in this
paragraph.

The process followed under the PERSEUS project has been
inspired by a truly international vision, thanks to 55 member-in-
stitutions belonging to both EU and non-EU countries. This
approach proved particularly beneficial for covering the first prior-
ity of this study (the retrospective analysis of existing data and
knowledge), thus increasing spatial coverage, acknowledging
sub-regional contributions, and aggregating a broader community
aiming to tackle, in a coherent way, the trans-boundary effects of
selected environmental pressures and provide a clear link with
MSFD descriptors and indicators in neighbouring EU and non-EU
countries. The latter point is of great relevance in the case of
trans-boundary issues (e.g. marine pollution, habitat loss or over-
fishing) affecting an area that falls under the jurisdiction of several
countries, either EU or non-EU.

The second element of the process was to elicit the existing
knowledge and to ‘project’ it on the descriptors. The ‘knowl-
edge synthesis’ approach moves in the opposite way when
compared to IAs, where a list of pre-assigned indicators was
used to ‘take the pulse’ of the European oceans and seas. In
the PERSEUS approach, the focus has been on identified pres-
sures in the SES, the observed or presumed impacts and the
assessment of the robustness of the hypothesized causative
link between them. In this respect, it is complementary to
the MSFD, which focuses mostly on assessing the environmen-
tal status.

This article is a commented summary of the above effort and its
conclusions aim at highlighting the existing gaps in data and
knowledge. It is organised according to the following points:

– highlight of some methodological aspects connected also with
MSFD conceptual aspects, relevant to the PERSEUS approach;
– identification of the major scientific gaps (in data and knowl-
edge) filtered by the expert judgment produced by a high-level
multidisciplinary scientific community from the scientific
literature and data bases;
– comparison of the major scientific gaps with the findings of
the gap analysis based on the review of MSFD Article 8 IA docu-
ments of the MSs;
– final remarks and suggestions for the MSFD adaptive
implementation.

So far, no such exercise of comparison of assessment
approaches (as presented here by PERSEUS) has been performed
for the Northern European Seas. On the other hand, OSPAR distin-
guishes coastal and offshore waters using the 12 nm (Territorial
Waters limit) in the assessment process for certain sections of their
Quality Status Report 2010, e.g. hazardous substances in sediment
and biota (CEMP assessment report, OSPAR, 20095). Meanwhile,
HELCOM establishes their own coastal areas and open sea (off-
shore) areas, referring the latter to waters beyond 1 NM seaward
from the baseline). Like in the SES, monitoring efforts are concen-
trated in coastal waters.

2. The MSFD philosophy and the PERSEUS approach

In the terminology of the MSFD, pressures are identified as per-
turbations that exert changes in forcing and/or fluxes (see descrip-
tions in Table 2, Annex III of the MSFD). The rationale behind this is
the conception that pristine ecosystems have, by definition,
achieved GES that can be altered only by pressures, i.e. changes
in fluxes and forcing. In other words, only the detailed holistic
knowledge of the pressures exerted on marine environments
allows identification of the best practices to mitigate the impacts
and to improve the environmental status of the seas. The analysis
of the anthropogenic pressures and the natural pressures (that call
for specific adaptation measures) will help identify the most
effective mechanisms and the actions able to restore GES condi-
tions. The PERSEUS approach privileged the understanding of the
pressures and their roles in altering environmental status.

Previous ‘Strategies’ or ‘Directives’ (e.g. WFD) were character-
ized by the assignment of thresholds for specific state variables,
whereas the MSFD assesses the status of environmental compo-
nents considering ecosystem structure and function and links it
to specific drivers/pressures. GES diagnosis through state variables
(represented by 56 quantitative indicators) is therefore only a com-
ponent of its assessment, since the complex interactions among
processes, pressures and state will require a global assessment of
status.

The values of the indicators (Table 1, Annex III of the MSFD) are
expected to vary in time according to specific time scales (i.e. sea-
sonal, interannual or decadal). They are also often interdependent.
To draw a rather simple image, the ‘status’ of an ecosystem can be
compared to an orbit of a planet, which describes a trajectory
constrained in a limited volume, while continuously changing its
position. The ‘space’ spanned by the indicators is multidimensional
and their variability directly drive the orbit representing the status
(Tett et al., 2013; Micheli et al., 2013; Halpern et al., 2012). In this
vision, GES is therefore a subspace in which the indicators are con-
fined within prescribed thresholds.

The ecosystem orbit is however not necessarily periodic, as the
Commission Staff Working Paper SEC 1255 (2011) recognized, in
the presence of climatic trends and abrupt ‘regime shifts’
(Moellmann et al., 2009) and their possible recovery (Oguz and
Velikova, 2010). These transitions call for a determination of GES
that needs to be adapted over time to take into account the
ongoing changes.

The implicit hope is, however, that marine ecosystems are resi-
lient enough to allow driving the descriptor back to their pristine
orbits by adopting appropriate sets of measures aimed at reducing
the pressures and minimizing the impacts on the state.

Acknowledgment of the importance of pressures indeed clarifies
why pressure-impact connections play a crucial role in the identifi-
cation of the actions requested to keep/restore the marine ecosys-
tems structure in conditions that sustainably provide goods and
services and why PERSEUS centred its analysis on this key point.

3. Methodological procedures

This study includes two parallel methodological approaches,
one developed by PERSEUS analysis and the other for the compar-
ison of IAs.

PERSEUS analysis was conducted by grouping the ecosystems in
two broad categories: the open sea (henceforth OS for the open
sea), where larger spatial homogeneity and reduced impact of
human activities are expected, and the coastal hot spots (hence-
forth CS for the coastal systems), where a superposition of different
pressures is noted. More details on the review analysis for OS and
CS are respectively provided in the PERSEUS reports by Karageorgis
et al. (2013) and Tornero et al. (2013). Hence, two groups of natural
and human pressures have been identified: those directly linked
with specific MSFD pressure descriptors, and those that jeopardize
the environmental status considered by GES (i.e. connected to
more than one descriptor). The pressures were discussed along
with their potential impacts, at different spatial scales. During
the above process, attention was paid also to data and knowledge
gaps that were identified during the review analysis.

In the open sea case, the SES have been divided into 4 areas
(Western Mediterranean, Central Mediterranean, Eastern
Mediterranean and Black Sea) in order to assess the relevant natu-
ral processes and anthropogenic pressures and their impacts (and
potential interactions) on the ecosystems.

In coastal areas, human pressures and their environmental
impacts have been analysed for selected sites in the SES (7 in the
Western Mediterranean, 2 in the Adriatic Sea, 3 in the Eastern
Mediterranean, and 8 in the Black Sea) in order to identify and



Table 2
Pressures (in brackets the referenced descriptors, if different), Impacts, and knowledge gaps for the open sea.

Pressure Impacts Knowledge gaps/research priorities

Changes in thermohaline
properties and pH of seawater
(hydrographic conditions)

Positive trends of temperature in the upper layer of the
Mediterranean Sea induce stronger stratification. Potential
modification of the primary production of the basins

The combined effects of thermohaline properties and pH trends
on the conditions of SES interiors are still unclear

The combination of foreseen pH decrease and surface warming
will potentially impact on calcifying organisms and ocean CO2
drawdown

Large uncertainty on the long-term effect of acidification on the
whole food web

Atmospheric input of nutrients,
organic carbon

Atmospheric deposition is supposed to provide a substantial
input in an otherwise largely oligotrophic system

The role, the spatial and temporal variability of the
atmospheric deposition (its organic component in particular)
needs to be further investigated

Contamination by hazardous
substances (contaminants and
contaminants in fish and
seafood)

Maritime transport is the main source of petroleum
hydrocarbon pollution in the Mediterranean Sea

Unclear relationship between contaminants in different
matrices and those found in biota and species of commercial
interest

Atmospheric deposition significantly contributes to the PAHs
introduction in the open sea

Transfer of contaminants from coastal waters to the open sea is
not well quantified; the role of shelf-slope exchange processes
needs further study. Lack of data and information on emerging
pollutants. Increased number of species should be considered
in the evaluation of the contaminants impacts

Down slope processes can transfer contaminants in the deep
basins.
Hg stock of the Mediterranean Sea has significantly increased
since industrial times. Hg concentration in the Black Sea is 4–
10 times than in the Mediterranean and other open ocean
waters. The methyl mercury levels are often higher in
Mediterranean fish species than in the Atlantic

Physical damage and loss of
habitats (sea-floor integrity)

Offshore engineering (oilrigs, pipelines, cables) activities will
increase in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. The drilling
operations produce drilling mud, brine wastes, deck runoff
water and pipeline leaks

Quantification of the damages and the loss of habitats in open
water via an accurate seabed mapping is requested for SES, at
least for the areas with expected higher pressure

Limited deep-sea trawling in the NW Mediterranean Impact of the deep-sea trawling on benthic habitats

Introduction of non-indigenous
species (non-indigenous
species – NIS)

Habitat alterations may favour the NIS rapid dispersal outside
the areas of introduction. NIS may perturb the food web
structure, displace the native species by out-compete them for
resources, modify the genetic pools by hybridization, introduce
pests and parasites

Development of methodologies to quantify the impact of NIS
on the marine ecosystem functioning, its carrying capacity and
resilience

Identification of the anthropogenic vectors of invasions and
their dispersal mechanisms
Enhanced taxonomic expertise targeted to exotic species

Overfishing (commercially
exploited fish and shellfish)

Important offshore fishing activities for large pelagic species
(blue-fin tuna, swordfish) take place in the Mediterranean and
particularly illegal overharvesting of blue-fin tuna populations
has resulted in their dramatic decrease in recent years, facing
the risk of extinction. Offshore deep-water fisheries targeting
deep water shrimps (Giant red Shrimp, Blue and red Shrimp)
also take place in the Mediterranean Sea. The status of these
stocks, wherever assessments are available, is found to be
overfished

Effective control of fishermen actions to strengthen compliance
of TAC enforcement measures

Improvement of by-catch mitigation techniques

Dumping of marine litter and

Plastic, glass, metal and clinker are the most abundant litter
components in Mediterranean waters. Shallow areas generally
show higher proportion of plastics than deeper regions, where
heavy litter predominates, mostly originating along major
shipping routes

Underwater noise and other forms
of energy

The underwater noise impacts have not been specifically
assessed in the SES. Noise from heavy and increasing maritime
traffic and oil and gas explorations represent a permanent and
widespread pressure over the SES. Noise is increasingly being
considered as a threat to marine mammals (abundant in certain
Mediterranean regions) and some fishes

Nutrients and organic enrichment
(eutrophication)

The elevated concentration of nutrients and organic matter in
the water column is observed only in proximity of highly
populated areas or where the influence of river inputs is
high(the Po prodelta, the Rhone and Ebro estuaries and the
Danube delta)

Link between high nutrient load, phytoplankton response in
terms of community structure, HABs and mucilage production

Reduction of nutrient concentrations has been recently
recorded in several coastal areas (northern Adriatic, Saronikos
Gulf, Haifa harbor, NW Black Sea). Observed impacts include
changes in chlorophyll concentration, shifts in the food web
structure, decrease of diatoms and increase of small
phytoplankton species, and increase of opportunistic and
tolerant vs sensitive benthic fauna

Mechanisms of impact of change in nutrients, nutrient ratios
and organic molecules on the structure of food web and carbon

Contamination by hazardous
substances (contaminants and
contaminants in fish and

Organic pollutants and heavy metals at levels which might be
of toxicological concern have been found in many areas: the
northwestern Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea, the Naples
harbor, Haifa, the Saronikos Gulf, the Sea of Marmara, and the
northwestern Black Sea. Observed impacts include gastropod
species associated with TBT exposure and impacts on seabirds
associated with oil chronic pollution. Oxidative stress in
mussels and shifts in zoobenthic community’s structure have
also been suggested

Physical damage and loss of
habitats (sea-floor integrity)

Construction of ports and other infrastructure represents a
significant pressure all around the Mediterranean and Black
Seas. Associated impacts include sandy beach erosion and need
of beach nourishment. Sea meadow destruction and changes in
the food webs have been also usually observed and related to
dredging, bottom trawling, anchoring, discharges of
wastewaters, and littering. Desertification due to harvesting
and destructive fisheries has been described in the Naples area,
the southeast Adriatic, the Burgas Bay and the northwestern
Black Sea

The pressure is high in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Most
relevant impacts include local replacements (e.g. Asparagopsis
taxiformis instead of Cystoseira spp. in the gulf of Naples),
negative impacts on fishing gears and tourism associated with
jellyfish blooms in Haifa and the sea of Marmara, and drastic

prioritize the knowledge gaps for follow-up work. This compilation
focused on areas with a high level of disturbance, i.e. big coastal
cities and ports, coastal areas under the influence of large rivers,
and on issues considered as major threats to the achievement of
GES. The coastal ‘hot spots’ have been characterized in terms of
site-specific physical, chemical and biological features, main
human activities and (when available) regulations for environmen-
tal management.

The results of the compilation of several PERSEUS reports (22
organized by geographical region/sub-region and 15 coastal site-
related) are summarized in two pressure/impact tables (Tables 2
and 3). Despite the significant analysis efforts, the reports suc-
ceeded only partially to provide an even coverage of the regions
and pressures. All the listed impacts were derived from expert
judgment based on scientific literature that is largely older, and
therefore irrespective of the MSFD. This means that a considerable
effort and additional expertise was required in reworking the
material and making them consistent with the MSFD framework.
For the sake of simplicity, all the references to the scientific articles
used for compiling the pressure/impact tables are not quoted here
and can be found in the abovementioned OS and CS project reports.

The assessment elements used in the IAs of the five EU MSs par-
ticipating in PERSEUS (Spain, France, Greece, Cyprus and Romania),
were reviewed and analysed in order to summarize and assess the
main methodological approaches and identify eventual method-
ological issues as well as gaps in data availability and knowledge.
The IAs have been evaluated with respect to both the methodologi-
cal consistency and the availability of data and workable knowledge.
Table 5 summarizes the reference methodologies used in the IAs.

A comparison of the results regarding the gaps in data and
knowledge has been performed to evaluate consistencies and dis-
crepancies in the results. The outcomes of this comparison are
reported here in Section 5.

4. Results

4.1. Pressures/impacts and gaps in data and knowledge

The PERSEUS analysis results target the identification and
evaluation of the pressures (i.e. the only controllable vectors of
changes) and their presumed impacts, instead of the assessment
of a status that provides a limited insight into possible intervention
policies. MSFD indicators are conversely identified as indicators of
state (D1, D3, D4, D6) and pressure (D2, D5, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11).
The pursued approach also reflected some basic assumptions that
have been implicitly retained in the analysis:

� intrinsic differences between coastal systems and open seas,
and also within a specific sub-region;
� identification as ‘pressures’ of some driving mechanisms that

are well recognized and that can be supposedly related to the
effects on the marine (eco) system;
� projection of these pressures on the descriptors.

The results will be discussed in an aggregated way, even if a
sub-regional approach has been followed in PERSEUS, since
substantial homogeneity in the results emerged despite the
geographical approach. Thus, efforts were made to identify com-
mon features rather than to highlight the differences that make
every area a unicum where site-dependent intensity, variability
and superposition of pressures interact. This offers a good opportu-
nity for the adoption of generic (i.e. site-independent) measures,
even if some flexibility must be retained.

A synthesis of the main outcomes of the analysis is reported in
Tables 2 and 3, to which the reader should refer for a complete
view. In parallel, the major gaps in data have been identified and
a synthesis of the results is presented in Table 4.

The presence of data is rated as good (the state/pressures/im-
pacts can be properly identified and quantified and additional
data/information would not substantially improve policy options),
medium (additional data can ameliorate policy options), poor
(expert judgment will be still needed even in case of substantial
new data availability) and none (virtually no data is available).

The general patterns and pressures/impacts that may, in our
view, be controversial are discussed below.

In general, there is good agreement on the pressures identified
in open seas (8 pressures) and those active in coastal systems (8
pressures) (Tables 2 and 3). The considered pressures have been
found active in both cases with the exception of eutrophication
and hydrographic conditions. These last two descriptors are not
strictly applicable to SES open seas. Conversely, other pressures
were identified that are relevant to trophic conditions and to the
circulation of SES open waters, and therefore the pressure/impact
tables have been modified accordingly.

Firstly, the hydrological condition descriptor is related to the
changes in fresh water and sediment riverine fluxes, which are lar-
gely of coastal relevance (with the possible exception of Nile dam-
ming and the north-western Black Sea shelf), and hence it appears
that the pressures related to this descriptor turns are not applic-
able to open sea regions. The long term variability introduced by
climatic and anthropogenic modifications in the atmosphere (e.g.
CO2 increase) has been considered instead.

The eutrophication descriptor, confirmed also by ‘‘high’’ data
availability (Table 4), is not appropriate for non-eutrophic basins
and SES; no evidence of eutrophication processes has been found
or any risk of substantial modification of trophic conditions is
foreseen for the open SES. Instead, potential modification of the
stratification due to global warming can reinforce the oligotrophic
regime typical of the Mediterranean Sea. Even if eutrophication
sites are reported in Table 3, there are signals that the trophic
conditions in some continental shelves and coastal areas are
veering to oligotrophic because of stricter regulations on
macronutrient inputs in coastal waters (Giani et al., 2012;
Tsiamis et al., 2013). In Tables 2 and 3 atmospheric input is
instead considered since it substantially contributes to the trophic
budget at basin scale and acts as a major driver of the primary
and bacterial production in Low Nutrient Low Chlorophyll areas
(Guieu et al., 2014).

The pressure/impact tables connect pressures (and the
corresponding descriptors) to the expected impacts and gaps in
knowledge (Tables 2 and 3). Even if the reports closely followed
a geographical organization, an emerging feature is that the pres-
sures are to a large extent ubiquitous. Despite similar pressures,
the impacts and their relevance are substantially different in

coastal hot spots and in open seas, reflecting the diversity of scales,
peculiarity of the specific environments and intensity.

For example, although high fishing pressure is exerted on fish-
ery resources of both open sea (OS) and coastal waters (CW) of
the Mediterranean Sea, the targets of these fisheries are species
with different life history, strategies and hence different resilience
to fishing pressure. Mediterranean OS fisheries focus mainly on
large pelagics, (i.e. bluefin tuna and swordfish) and deep-water
red shrimps (Aristeus antennatus and Aristemorpha foliacea). The
latter species present an overfished status in some sub regions of

the Mediterranean Sea; however, blue fin tuna stocks being less
resilient to fishing pressure, have shown a dramatic decline in
recent years, which was followed by the adoption of strict manage-
ment measures. Regarding the CW, an overfished status was found
for most of the assessed small pelagic and demersal stocks
(Cardinale and Osio, 2013); however, the assessment of many
stocks is still not possible due to lack of pertinent data (Table 4).
Stock assessments are very limited in non-EU countries, thus high-
lighting the need to initiate monitoring activities and relevant
analysis through close collaboration between EU and non-EU coun-
tries particularly in the case of shared fishery resources. The pres-
sure exerted by the introduction of non-indigenous species is high
for all SES, and is mainly associated to Lessepsian migrators in the
eastern Mediterranean and to shipping traffic (including ports and
ballast waters) and sea farming in the case of the Black Sea where
the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi badly affected Black Sea fisheries
(Kideys, 2002).

Similar considerations regarding site-specificity and the differ-
ences between open sea and coastal hot spots could be valid for
the vast majority of pressures and should be considered carefully
in all future developments and strategic plans. A series of gaps in
the knowledge about the consequences of pressures emerged from
the impact analysis, filtered by the expertise of the groups; these
are reported in the third column of both tables (Tables 2 and 3).
These gaps can be considered as a list of priorities for scientific
research in these selected topics. The eventual bridging of these
gaps will help to verify the actual occurrence of impacts on the
Environmental Status (whose relevance is often a matter of spec-
ulation) and will provide a more robust reference framework to
be used in the design strategy of the mitigation measures.

The comparison of results shown in Tables 2 and 3 with the
independently obtained estimates through the IAs, will be pre-
sented in Section 5.

Table 5 summarizes the reference methodologies used in the

IAs. The predominant methodological approach used in the MSs
IAs as a reference international framework was the WFD. SES
member states also used combinations of diverse methodologies,
covering from EU Directives (Habitats Directive, Birds Directive,
Natura 2000) and regional conventions (Barcelona Convention or
Black Sea Convention) to national methods. OSPAR methodologies
(North East Atlantic Ocean region) were also mentioned in some
cases indicating the existence of methodological gaps in SES

regions. In the case of fisheries, member states used quantitative
approaches based mainly on commercial stock assessments carried
out under the umbrella of international organizations such as the
International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the
General Fishery Commission for the Mediterranean Sea (GFCM)
or the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tunas (ICCAT), and on data collected under the DCF (Common
Fishery Policy). For stocks that were not reliably assessed,
survey-derived indicators were used. Regarding non-indigenous
species, none of the methodologies listed in Table 4 was adopted;
most of the countries followed a qualitative approach showing the
lack of legislative frameworks or international methodologies as
well as reference conditions. Marine litter and underwater noise
are emerging issues with no international regulatory frameworks
at European level, which prevented member states from delivering
appropriate assessments.

The overall analysis of the assessment elements revealed the
need for (a) harmonized methodologies, (b) development of
methodological standards and thresholds, and (c) adaptation of
the coastal water methodology to open sea needs. These recom-
mendations are well in line with those put forward in the IDA
(Palialexis et al., 2014) for all European countries.

4.2.2. Assessment of the data and knowledge gaps
Most countries reported data on D1 (Biodiversity) acquired

either through national monitoring programs or from Regional
Sea conventions (Barcelona Convention: Mediterranean Action
Plan data bank). However, many data gaps could be attributed to
the wide and complex scope of the descriptor. Significant lack of
data concerning offshore issues was underlined, whereas the
available data covering coastal waters were scarce, disperse and
heterogeneous. Time series datasets were missing, as well as data
harmonized at spatial and temporal scale. Lack of data was
observed regarding the extent, intensity and frequency of the pres-
sures along with their impacts on biodiversity, as well as lack of
suitable monitoring networks. Knowledge presented high hetero-
geneity among countries, while lack of basic knowledge on marine
ecosystems was evident.

Lack of data and knowledge concerning D2 (Non-Indigenous
Species) was highlighted in the IAs. Data sources were regional
or national research programs; however, low data availability
was reported by all countries. Additionally, the fragmentary char-
acter of available information and heterogeneity were obvious in
terms of spatial and temporal coverage. The observed gaps in
knowledge concerned local biota, ecology of allochthonous species
and ecosystem along with food web functioning. The need for
impact assessment studies and for specific monitoring programs
was identified.

Regarding D3 (Fisheries), the countries used data from the Data
Collection Framework (DCF), as well as other national or interna-
tional data collection programs. Concerning OS fisheries, a shortage
of data was reported for deep-water fish and the same was true for
CS fisheries targeting a large number of commercially exploited
fish and shellfish species, which resulted in a rather small number
of stocks that have been assessed so far. Moreover, it should be
pointed out that D3 was not considered in the IDA (Palialexis
et al., 2014) due to the extensive relevant work conducted by
ICES (ICES, 2014). According to the latter, the assessment of GES
was only available for a low number of stocks using indicators
3.1.1 (fishing mortality) and 3.2.1 (Spawning Stock biomass) and
the need for an agreed strategy for coherent assessment of GES
in the Mediterranean Sea were underlined. Regarding the Black
Sea, only 5 of the 25 important stocks in the region were assessed.
Furthermore, ICES highlighted a lack of reliable estimates of indica-
tors from research surveys, which is believed to be closely con-
nected to the standardization process of the DCF in the region.
Concerning data used for the assessment of D4 (marine food
webs), countries referred to monitoring programs implemented
under different EU and convention commitments (an international
bottom trawl survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS), ICCAT, WFD
quality components, Natura 2000 species). However, general lack
of pertinent data was underlined, especially for coastal areas, rocky
bottoms and deep areas. The lack of data concerning experimental
and functional ecology as well as energy fluxes was also
highlighted revealing the existing problem of the knowledge gap
and the need for further development.

Most countries had extensive datasets on eutrophication (D5)
acquired through national monitoring programs in the framework
of WFD implementation or the Regional Sea Conventions. Other
sources of data were national or international research programs,
technical reports, scientific publications and satellite imagery,
especially in coastal areas within the framework of monitoring
projects. Regarding data gaps, the countries mentioned mainly
the lack of spatial coverage and particularly the lack of offshore
data on nutrients, phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen.
Furthermore, lack of quantitative data on pressures (monthly/sea-
sonal variation, natural/anthropogenic sources) and of appropriate
monitoring programs to allow the use of multimetric indices was
reported.

For most countries, data regarding D6 (Sea-floor integrity) had
been acquired mainly for coastal waters under national monitoring
programs in the framework of the implementation of the WFD,
NATURA 2000 and the Habitat Directive. International data
sources, such as Regional Sea Conventions, EUNIS (European
Nature Information System) and MEDITS were also reported.
Additional data sources were sedimentology databases and map-
ping databases, along with scientific publications. However, lack
of data and knowledge was reported relative to habitat modelling,
size distribution, ecosystem structure, species’ response to
impacts, and sensitive or opportunistic species. Furthermore, lack
of knowledge on the relation pressure-impacts was mentioned.

D7 (Hydrological conditions) illustrated the difficulty to dif-
ferentiate between the impact of direct anthropogenic pres-
sures and the consequences of global change. The data
sources considered were monitoring programs, research pro-
jects, and model products. However, data gaps were reported
by almost all countries. The lack of long time-series datasets
was emphasised, and therefore monitoring programs need to
be optimized.

Regarding D8 (Contaminants), many datasets were available on
several contaminant families, such as heavy metals, PAHs, or PCBs,
along with data on specific contaminants (e.g. TBT, pesticides,
detergents) and other pollutants specified in Annexes IX and X to
the WFD. All countries reported the availability of contaminant
concentration data in water, sediments and biota matrices.
Regarding biota, most countries had mussel data. Some countries
also used fish data. In the framework of the MYTILOS/ MYTIMED/
MYTIAD/ MYTIOR programs (using transplanted mussels), harmo-
nized data had been acquired for Mediterranean EU and non-EU
countries. Despite the availability of an important amount of data-
sets and long time series, there was still lack of data for specific
contaminants. Furthermore, most of the datasets referred to
coastal environments and, consequently, an important lack of off-
shore datasets; a gap that needs to be filled in by the development
of appropriate monitoring programs.

For D9 (Contaminants in fish and seafood), a general lack of data
was reported by most countries, highlighting the low number of
contaminants analysed and the low number of species considered
in the assessment. Data sources included monitoring programs at
different levels, national, sub-regional and European monitoring
networks, such as the MYTILOS project and MED POL (MAP marine
pollution assessment and control program) monitoring. It should,



A. Crise et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 95 (2015) 28–39 37
however, be noted that these monitoring networks do not aim to
monitor the contaminant levels in products placed on the market.

Data on D10 (Marine litter) was reported as scarce and often
incoherent. Again, existing datasets concerned mostly the coastal
environment. The lack of data for deep areas was reported, and it
constituted a gap for the assessment of the environmental status
regarding this descriptor. Lack of knowledge was also a major issue
for this descriptor. Whenever available, data came from a few
monitoring programs, specific research projects, programs led by
NGOs or from MEDITS campaigns (which allowed data collection
on seafloor litter). However, available data presented restricted
spatial distribution, confirming gaps for most countries.

D11 (Underwater noise) was subject to a major lack of data and
knowledge, and thus several countries were unable to include it in
their assessment. Data sources referred to scientific publications,
impact assessment studies and recording of activities from pres-
sure indicator data.

The overall analysis of data and knowledge gaps in the IAs gen-
erally revealed (a) low data availability, (b) fragmented knowledge
on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, (c) limited and hetero-
geneous knowledge on the processes relating pressures and
impacts, (d) the need for long-term time series datasets and (e)
the need for establishing suitable monitoring networks.
5. Discussion

In order to understand correctly the pressure/impact tables pro-
duced (Tables 2 and 3), some additional comments are required.
Firstly, even if the PERSEUS reports did not explicitly mention it,
our analysis showed the existence of uneven spatial and temporal
distribution of data and information: there was a clear North–
South ‘‘data and knowledge gradient’’ due to the chronic scarcity
of marine data availability in all the disciplines. This reflects the
comparatively larger effort in marine observation carried out in
the European sector of the Mediterranean Sea. Similar but less pro-
nounced decrease in data and information was observed along the
West–East direction, mainly due to the same reasons.

Similar difficulties were found for the open sea in comparison
with coastal systems, where the relative easiness in the observa-
tional procedures and the less demanding infrastructures produced
a larger amount of data. The relative abundance of coastal data
was, however, somehow misleading because the distribution was
uneven and often reflected the presence of marine biological
stations.

Another relevant factor was the different scales of the processes
involved in coastal systems vs open waters. The baroclinic Rossby
radius of deformation (that is usually used to define the mesoscale)
in coastal areas can be one-to-two orders of magnitude smaller
than in the open ocean (being inversely proportional to the depth).
Since the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale processes deeply influence
the spatial and temporal patchiness of chemical and biological
parameters, the sampling rate must be higher in order to sample
the signals correctly. Thus, even relatively highly sampled coastal
areas cannot retain the complexity of the biogeochemical dynam-
ics in all its aspects. The relatively large number of bioprovinces
(areas with coherent seasonal variability of key biological vari-
ables) present in SES (i.e. Bianchi and Morri, 2000; D’Ortenzio
and Ribera d’Alcalà, 2009) confirms the differences between
coastal and open sea processes, but also reaffirm the speciality of
the Mediterranean Sea calling for more detailed spatial inves-
tigation of the open waters.

The independent analysis of data gaps carried out by exploiting
the present knowledge for PERSEUS and by in depth analysis of SES
IAs produced interesting results that are summarized in Table 4.
The PERSEUS evaluation retains the difference between open sea
and coastal hot spots while the IAs review does not explicitly
account for this difference, even if this issue has been mentioned
now and then in the reports. In both assessments, data availability
relative to non-indigenous species, marine food webs, marine litter
and underwater noise was rated as poor both in IAs and in coastal
and open waters. In this case there is a perfect alignment in the
opinions of the two communities. In the case of biological diver-
sity, commercially exploited fish and shell fish, eutrophication,
contaminants and contaminants in seafood, the prevailing opinion
of medium-to-high (eutrophication) data abundance is confirmed
only in the IAs and in the coastal evaluation. Conversely, in the
open sea only pressures related to nutrient dynamics and ocean
circulation (related but not equivalent to eutrophication and
hydrographical conditions) are supported by a sufficient data base.
This leads to the tentative conclusion that IAs, aimed at responding
to the requirements of the MSFD criteria, tended to extrapolate the
existing information (mainly along the coasts) to the open seas.
This is a major pitfall in IAs, since the analysis of the pressure/im-
pact tables show how, even considering similar pressures, the
states, gaps and impacts are clearly different.

The PERSEUS approach and the IAs both agreed on the sub-
stantial lack of knowledge for many descriptors. The IAs identified
more prominent gaps in biodiversity, NIS, food webs, marine litter
and noise, while PERSEUS started to list some of the pressures
that are better known or that can be tackled (at least partially)
during the project lifetime (marine litter and underwater noise).
PERSEUS, however, tried to identify some specific research
themes (listed in the third column of Tables 2 and 3) needed to
reach a better insight of the (eco) systems for their efficient
management.

A very poor knowledge of mechanisms and processes governing
the D1 (Biodiversity) descriptor has been acknowledged both by
knowledge synthesis and IAs assessment. Even if the quantity of
observations for some coastal areas has increased in recent years
(see Table 4), the assessment of governing mechanisms that rule
biodiversity in the marine environment is still at its early stage
(e.g. there are no benchmarks for the assessment) because of the
intrinsic difficulties in collecting multidisciplinary datasets with
the appropriate sampling strategies accounting for the peculiar
traits of marine ecosystems. Semi-qualitative evaluations have
been based on a subset of organisms, with a robust taxonomic pro-
file, which have been recorded over decades and whose abundance
might be plotted over time. However, this would not provide an
assessment of the trend in biodiversity but only of the trend in
community composition. Some information is available from the
decrease in species richness of highly impacted environments,
which have been monitored over the last decades because of being
hot spots, e.g. the Black Sea (Kideys, 2002). Another reason specific
to the pelagic environment, where a key role is played by uni-
cellular plankton, is that a clear definition of diversity is not yet
available.

Both IAs analysis and the knowledge synthesis process agree
that food web structure is not known with enough detail to answer
the D4 question (Marine food webs). Despite the fundamental con-
tributions during the last century in providing general patterns for
the structure of the marine food web (i.e. Longhurst, 2010; for an
overview of the pelagic environment), new views are emerging
on the different components of the food webs, which show a much
higher complexity than previously thought. Changes that might be
ongoing but are presently overlooked in certain processes can
be therefore more difficult to be assessed. A few hypotheses, e.g.
the impact of removing large predators from the ocean by inten-
sive fishery (Daskalov, 2002) or strongly increasing nutrient inputs
in semi-enclosed coastal sites have been put forward and to some
extent have been reflected in the reports, but there is no systematic
analysis of the food webs as such.



38 A. Crise et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 95 (2015) 28–39
It is worth noting that biodiversity and food webs, including the
microbial loop, are in fact the essential trait of ecosystem function-
ing and that their poor coverage anticipates the difficulties in pro-
ducing a sound assessment of the Environmental Status and
effectiveness of mitigation measures.

The role played by gelatinous macrozooplankton in the marine
ecosystem and its impact on socio-economic activities and on
human health was not sufficiently highlighted, but emerged clearly
from the scientific analyses of recent data and the success of the
Jelly Fish Spotting campaign promoted within PERSEUS.
Increased in-depth knowledge of the behaviour and ecology of
these species seems therefore timely, owing to the fact that they
directly and indirectly affect many descriptors.

A cross cutting theme, which was not properly considered, is
related to the resistance and resilience of the ecosystems. The com-
bined analysis of pressures and impacts shows that pressures are
not always directly related to the impacts and that the typical
response time of the (eco) system is largely unknown. This means
that the absence of evident modifications in the environmental sta-
tus does not automatically imply the absence of driving pressures.
Conversely, even if mitigation measures are adopted to reduce the
pressures, the improvement of the environmental status will
depend on the response time of the ecosystem and the strength
of the pressures. Pressures indeed can drive an ecosystem out of
its equilibrium, by creating a (potentially) irreversible regime shift.

The time scale of ecosystem response to external perturbations
should also be considered during the monitoring phase: even if a
set of measures is adopted the eventual improvement can heavily
depend of the ecosystem time scale of reaction. This delay should
be carefully considered when planning the MSFD monitoring phase.

An open and urgent question is how the GES can be influenced
by the cumulative effects of multiple stressors. Multiple and some-
times complex interactions occur or are anticipated between the
different natural and anthropogenic pressures (MERMEX group,
2011). Ecosystem response to concomitant multiple stressors is
known to be non-linear and its resilience is reduced if compared
to the impact of the same stressors applied one-by-one (e.g.
Crain et al., 2008). This may result in reducing the ranges of indica-
tors where GES is defined. Besides levels, the typical rate of the
induced change should be considered since it is frequently (but
not always) much faster when induced by humans.

6. Conclusions

The results obtained during the first phase of the PERSEUS pro-
ject exploit its international dimension and the scientific excel-
lence of the consortium by implementing a truly transnational
science-based bottom-up approach in assessing major natural
and anthropogenic pressures (i.e. vectors of change) in open seas,
and choke points (i.e. straits, coastal ‘hot spots’). At the same time,
a joint independent analysis of the Initial Assessment documents
from SES member states (top-down driven by the MSFD imple-
mentation requirements) has been carried out. In this article these
two complementary approaches have been compared, in order to
elicit, presenting light of current best knowledge, the gaps in data
and in understanding processes and their mutual interactions.

The major achievements can be summarized as follows:

� The PERSEUS approach privileged an overview of the pressures
and their roles in altering the environmental status identifying
their impacts.
� The science-based consolidated evidence dictated a dual

approach for PERSEUS retrospective analysis: the first applied
to large scale processes considered as pressures for open sea
environmental status, the second one considering coastal hot
spots where a superposition of different pressures is present
(IAs did not discriminate coastal vs open waters).
� The PERSEUS approach and the analysis of IAs documents

exhibit a striking correspondence in data and knowledge gaps
analysis, despite the differences in the communities producing
the reports, the data bases and the methodologies adopted.
Five (6 in the case of PERSEUS) over 11 descriptors suffer
scarcity of data.
� There is a large consensus supporting the statement of

Commission Decision 2010/477 EU on the substantial need to
develop additional knowledge and understanding to implement
GES in a truly science-based way. So far, some of the indicators
resulted to be almost impossible to be evaluated for operational
purposes (e.g. those related to biodiversity, food web structure,
marine litter and microplastics, underwater noise and energy
input due to human activities).
� No evidence of eutrophication processes has been found or any

risk of substantial modification of trophic conditions is foreseen
for SES open waters. A potential modification of the strati-
fication due to global warming instead can reinforce the olig-
otrophic regime typical of the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the
presence of eutrophic conditions in some hot spots, contradic-
tory examples have been found in some coastal waters.
� A number of additional targeted scientific priorities have been

identified for SES to help reduce the uncertainties and the gaps
in data and knowledge in the case of open seas and coastal hot
spots. These have been reported in the pressure/impact tables.
Among them, the largest gap consists in the lack of a proper
understanding of marine biological diversity and food web
functioning, which is far to be operational and deserves a tar-
geted study, being the backbone of any holistic approach to
the management of the marine environment.

As a general suggestion, the precautionary principle should be
adopted in all cases where the Communication from
the Commission (European Commission, 2000) conditions can be
applied. In addition, new scientific tools are becoming mature
enough to evaluate the effectiveness and the associated risks of
the mitigation actions and measures. Adaptive scenario analyses
incorporating also the socio-economic component (i.e. PERSEUS
Adaptive Policy Tool Box) and decision support systems are two
relevant examples. These tools should increasingly be used for
the assessment of the response of marine ecosystems, whose
uncertainty is and will be an intrinsic feature of such ‘highly
non-linear’ complex systems.

It is also commendable that the scope of the MSFD will go
beyond a reductionist definition of ‘impacts’ in order to assess ‘im-
pacts’ at the level of ecosystem functioning. PERSEUS made an
effort to put in practice this vision, though focusing on the robust-
ness of inferred links between pressures (perturbations), which are
easier to quantify, once selected, and the impacts, i.e. changes in
the state of the ecosystem.

In conclusion, with this article we tried to demonstrate how the
PERSEUS approach added value to a common effort of a large
scientific community to obtain a sound and extensive analysis
and state-of-art of knowledge and understanding of the Southern
European Seas state.
