Abstract 

This study analyses the wave energy resource along the Atlantic coast of Morocco using a 44-year 
series of data obtained from numerical modeling (hindcasting). The spatial distribution of wave 
power is analyzed using data from 23 points along that coast. The estimated resources (average 
wave power up to 30 kW/m and average annual wave energy up to 262 MW h/m) are considerable 
and slightly lower than at the neighboring Canary Islands. The central part of this area (between 
latitudes 29º30’N and 34ºN) is the most productive, while in the northern and southern parts the 
resource is significantly lower due to the shadow effect of the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary 
Islands, respectively. The study of the temporal variability indicates a considerable seasonal trend, 
being the wave energy resource over four times greater in winter than in summer. Moreover, the 
power matrices of two wave energy converters (WECs) are considered to estimate the average 
power output at all the studied points. Finally, a multi-criteria analysis is carried out considering five 
different factors in order to select the best places for WEC deployment. 
 

1. Introduction 

The energetic needs of the planet are continuously growing due to the increase of population and 
the emergence of new energy-demanding activities. This is particularly critical in emergent counties 
like Morocco, in which this situation might be aggravated by the lack of fossil fuel reserves. As a 
consequence, the development of renewable energies in emergent countries is crucial for both 
environmental and economic issues.  

According to data from 2012 [1], about 90% of the energy production in Morocco is from thermal 
origin, while the other 10% is from renewable sources, mainly hydraulic and wind energy. The 
energetic sector shows a large dependence from external energy sources, which account for 97% 
of primary energy sources and 15% for electric power [1]. 

Morocco presents a high potential for renewable energies, and some studies have analyzed the 
availability of energies due to wind [2-4] and solar radiation [5-6] in this country. Nevertheless, as far 
as the authors know, there are no specific studies addressing the potential of wave energy there. 

Some studies assessed the wave energy resource in the whole Mediterranean. Thus, [7] found at 
the Mediterranean Coast of Morocco wave energy powers between 2 kW/m and 6 kW/m, while [8] 
estimated a mean wave power of 6.3 kW/m at a point in the Moroccan Mediterranean. 

A number of studies have assessed the wave resource in islands located in the Atlantic Ocean, not 
far from the Moroccan coast, like the Canary Islands [9-12], Madeira [13-14] or Azores Islands [15], 
or all of these plus Iceland [16]. Other research has focused on the Northeast Atlantic, mainly in the 



2 
 

United Kingdom [17-19], France [20-21], Portugal [22-24] and Spain [25-28] or several places at a 
time [29]. These studies found a considerable potential of wave energy in those areas. Moreover, it 
was estimated that the annual gross theoretical wave power is more significant on the western 
coasts of the continents, due to the prevalence of west-to-east winds [26, 28-32]. 

Considering the potential of nearby areas, wave energy could be a good alternative to reduce the 
dependence of Morocco on fossil fuels, as well as to contribute to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. Moreover, besides energy generation, wave-energy farms can be used for coastal 
protection in order to limit erosion processes [29, 33]. 

This paper focuses on the assessment of wave power potential and wave energy yield around the 
Atlantic coast of Morocco. Section 2 briefly describes the study area and presents the available data 
and the methodology used. In Section 3 the wave energy resource along the Atlantic coast of 
Morocco is assessed, while in Section 4 the results are discussed and the best places for deploying 
Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are identified. Finally, the conclusions of the paper are presented 
in Section 5. 
 
 
2. Data and methods 
 
2.1. Study area and available wave data 
 
Morocco, located in the northwest of Africa, has a long coast (more than 1,800 km) facing the 
Mediterranean Sea (from the Algerian border to the strait of Gibraltar) and the Atlantic Ocean (from 
this strait to the limit of Western Sahara). This last stretch is the study area (27º40’-35º48’N, 13º11’-
5º53’W) with an approximate length of 1,300 km (Figure 1). 
 
Waves arriving at the Moroccan Atlantic coast have their origin in the Azores islands, where winds 
of large intensity and duration generate high waves that propagate for long distances, reaching that 
coast in around 30 h [34]. During their propagation, these waves are deviated to the right arriving 
almost perpendicular to the coast and reducing their power [35]. On the northernmost part of this 
coast, waves are reduced by the shelter provided by the SW corner of the Iberian Peninsula. On the 
southernmost area, the Canary Islands also contribute to reduce the magnitude of the incoming 
waves. 
 
The data used for this study correspond to the 44-year hindcasting wave climate database (1958-
2001) from the European HIPOCAS project [36-37]. This wave data set was obtained using the 
WAM model [38] forced by the wind output of the REMO regional atmospheric model [39], which in 
turn was forced by the global atmospheric reanalysis carried out by the U.S. National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The HIPOCAS database has been extensively validated for wind, 
wave and sea-level parameters [40-41]. This simulation, like most, has some limitations in terms of 
properly reproducing certain storm events, but it generally reproduces mean values quite well [42]. 
With a resolution of 0.25º X 0.25º and three-hourly data, this database offers homogeneous long-
term data and a higher spatial coverage than that obtained with single-point observations (e.g. 
buoys). Moreover, data from the HIPOCAS project have previously been used to characterize wave 
energy potential in various areas [10, 26-27, 30-31]. 
 
A total of 23 points are analyzed for investigating their wave energy potential. The location of these 
points is presented in Figure 1, while their geographical coordinates, water depths and distances to 
the coast are provided in Table 1. These last two data were obtained from nautical charts and the 
values shown in the table are only approximate. It can be noticed that all the points, except P17 (35 
m) and P20 (40 m) have water depths greater than, or equal to 50 m. On the other hand, the 
distances to the coast are very variable, ranging from 5 km (P1) to 52 km (P6 and P19), with 14 
points being located at distances smaller than 25 km while the other 9 are farther away from the 
coast. Although some distances could seem too large, they can be considered viable for a future 



3 
 

farm location since they are deemed feasible for the offshore wind industry, with some projects 
operating (or planned to be installed) at distances from the shore between 79 and 112 km [29].

2.2. Methodology 

Wave power can be obtained using the following deep-water expression:



          (1) 

 
where P is the is the wave power per unit of crest length (kW/m), Hs is the significant wave height, 
Te is the energy period, ρ is the density of seawater (assumed to be 1025 kg/m

3) and g is the 
gravitational acceleration. Te is computed as a function of spectral moments:

0
e

m
T

m
                      (2) 

 
The database used in this work does not provide information on spectral moments or spectral 
shape, and sea states are specified in terms of significant wave height Hs and peak period Tp, so Te 
must be estimated from other variables. One approach when Tp is known is to assume the following: 
 

e pT T                  (3) 

where α is a coefficient whose value depends on the shape of the wave spectrum (0.86 for a 
Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum and increasing towards unity with decreasing spectral width) [43]. 
Taking into account that wave spectra in this area are rather wide due to the combined presence of 
sea and swell sea states, as suggested by [43-44] a conservative value of Te = 0.9Tp was used to 
assess the wave energy resource. 
 
Most of the points analyzed are located at depths greater than 90 m, so for most of the wave 
periods they are in deep waters and thus equation (1) can be applied without restrictions. In some 
cases the use of equation (1) introduces a certain error, when the points are located in intermediate 
waters for some sea states (those with longer wave periods). Nevertheless, taking into account the 
inaccuracy introduced by the use of equation (3) and the conservative value adopted to assess Te, 
the use of expression (1) in those points can be considered acceptable. 
 
With Equations (1) and (3), the total wave energy resource at a point can be assessed, allowing the 
computation of the power average at each point. As mentioned above, this assessment of wave 



5 
 

power uses data sets from 44-year numerical simulations, which are long enough to account for 
inter-annual variability. 
 
Besides the amount of wave power and potentially available energy, another factor to consider 
when selecting a site for wave energy converter (WEC) deployment is its temporal variability at 
different time scales (daily, monthly and seasonal). Sites with a steady wave energy flux are 
preferable to those with unsteady wave conditions since they are more reliable and show a greater 
efficiency. 
 
Among the coefficients proposed to assess the temporal variability in wave power at a specific 
location we use three proposed by Cornett [43]: the coefficient of variation (COV), the seasonal 
variability index (SV) and the monthly variability index (MV).  
 
The COV is obtained by dividing the standard deviation (σ) of the power time series (F(t)) by the 
mean power (): 
 

 
 

( )
F t

COV F
F t

  
   

              (4) 

 
The COV would be zero for a fictitious wave power time series with absolutely no variability; from 
there, its value increases with variability. Values of 0.85-0.9 indicate that the resource is only 
moderately unsteady, while values greater than 1.2 denote considerable variability. 
 
The SV is defined as: 
 
 

1 4s s

year

P P
SV

P


            (5) 

 
where PS1 is the mean wave power for the highest-energy season (usually winter) and PS4 is the 
mean wave power for the lowest-energy season (usually summer), and Pyear is the annual mean 
wave power. The greater the value of SV the larger the seasonal variability, with values lower than 1 
indicating moderate seasonal variability. 
 
MV is defined as follows: 
 

1 12M M

year

P P
MV

P


           (6) 

 
where PM1 is the mean wave power for the highest-energy month and PM12 is the mean wave power 
for the lowest-energy month. Obviously, the values of MV are greater than those of SV. 
 
On the other hand, the amount of electric energy delivered by a WEC depends on the average 
wave energy available at the location of the device, but is also highly dependent on the way in 
which this energy is scattered amongst the energy bins, defined by intervals of significant wave 
height and wave energy period [14]. This is because each WEC has its own power matrix, indicating 
the power output for each energy bin. Thus,

where E is the WEC energy output per year (in kW h), hij is the number of hours per year 
corresponding to the bin defined by the column j and the row i, while Pij is the electric power (in kW) 
provided in the power matrix of the WEC for the same bin. In this study, two WECs whose 
development state can be considered mature [29] are used to assess the potential energy 
production: the Pelamis converter [45], whose principle is attenuator, and the Wave Dragon device 
[46], whose principle is terminator. 

Finally, to assess the WEC efficiency an index usually considered is the capacity factor Cf, which is 
computed as:

where PE is the average electric power produced by the WEC at a specific location and PWECmax is its 
maximum rated power. 

 

3. Results 

3.1. Analysis of wave data 
 
 
Before assessing the wave energy, the wave conditions in the area are analyzed. Figure 2 shows 
the mean Hs and Te at the 23 studied points while Table 2 presents a statistical analysis of the 
significant wave height. It can be observed that the largest significant wave heights are located in 
the central area of the Atlantic Moroccan coast, while in the northern and southern parts these 
values are considerably lower due to the aforementioned shadow effects generated respectively by 
the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary Islands.

From the analysis of the Hs mean values, it can be noticed that the sector between points P9 and 
P12 has the highest values, all of them exceeding 2 m, particularly at P10 with 2.13 m and P11, with 
2.09 m. The neighbouring stretches (from P6 to P8 and from P13 to P16) show slightly smaller 
mean wave heights, with values between 1.91 and 1.98 m. The northernmost (P1 to P3) and 
southernmost (P20 to P23) areas present the lowest values, which are less than 1.6 m. Regarding 
the energy period, the largest mean value is found at P14 with 10.07 s, followed by P8 with 10.03 s 
and P13 with 10.01 s. In the stretch between P4 and P17 all the values are larger than 9.7 s. 
Surprisingly, the two most energetic points show some of the lowest mean Te values with 9.79 s 
(P10) and 9.83 s (P11).

The statistical parameters of Hs displayed in Table 2 include the average and maximum values, the 
95th percentile, the standard deviation and the percentage of values greater than 2 m. As regards to 
maximum Hs values, these are concentrated in the sector P2-P15, with values higher than 9.5 m, 
with point P10 presenting the maximum value (10.9 m), followed by P11 (10.6 m) and P9 (10.5 m). 
The points in the southern part of the studied area (P17-P23) have significantly lower maximum Hs 
values (smaller than or equal to 8 m). Regarding the 95th percentile (95%) the maximum values are 
found in the stretch P3-P19, where they are larger than 3 m, peaking at P9 and P10 with 3.9 m. The 
analysis of the standard deviation values indicates that the larger deviations from the mean Hs are 
located in the sector P4-P11 with values greater than or equal to 0.90, progressively decreasing 
towards the ends. This parameter presents particularly low values in the southernmost area (P20-
P23), ranging between 0.50 and 0.61. Finally, the significant wave heights greater than 2 m have 
also been computed, being again the central area (from P6 to P16) where this value is more 
exceeded. More than 37% of the sea states have a Hs higher than 2 m at all these points, 
particularly at P10 with almost half of the time (49.5%) and P11 (47.7%).

In Figure 3 the wave roses of four selected points (spread along the studied area) are presented, 
showing the directional distribution of the significant wave height. From these wave roses it is 
evident that almost all the wave energy arriving to this coast comes from the sector between N and 
WNW. At P3, the presence of the Iberian Peninsula at the north prevents the existence of waves 
from the N and therefore almost all the waves come from NW and WNW, being WNW waves less 
frequent (33%) than NW ones (46%), although they are more energetic. At P10, most of the wave 
energy is distributed in three directions: N (29%), NNW (36%) and NW (21%), being the N the 
direction with smaller waves. At P15 the same three directions concentrate most of the wave 
energy, although in this case the NNW represents more than 57% of the waves, followed by NW 
(22%) and N (14%). Finally, in the southern part of the studied domain, the presence of the Canary 
Islands prevents the arrival of swells from the NW and therefore, the N (50%) and NNW (20%) are 
the dominant directions.  

3.2. Wave energy resource 

The average wave power (computed with equations (1) and (3)) at the 23 locations is shown in 
Figure 4 and Table 3. Several areas with different wave energy distributions can be distinguished: a 
higher-energy area encompassing the central part of the studied domain (from P6 to P15) with 
annual average wave powers greater than 25 kW/m and annual wave energies greater than 218 
MW h/m; two low-energy areas, including both ends of the studied domain (P1-P3 and P20-P23) 
with average wave powers lower than 18 kW/m and annual wave energies lower than 160 MW h/m; 
and two transitional areas with intermediate-energy (P4-P5 and P16-P19) with average powers 
between 19 kW/m and 24 kW/m and annual wave energies between 165 MW h/m and 205 MW h/m.

Besides the clear spatial distribution of the wave energy shown in Figure 4, it is also interesting to 
analyze the temporal variability of the wave power. Figure 5 shows the average monthly wave 
power at the 23 studied locations. In this figure, a clear seasonal trend can be observed, with 
energy power reaching its largest values in the winter months (December-February), peaking at all 
points in January, followed by December and February. On the contrary, during summer months 
(June-August) wave power drops to its minimum values, while in the rest of the year there is a 
transition between these two situations. In the southernmost less energetic points this contrast 
between summer and winter is not as marked and, in particular, at P21 and P22, the points more 
affected by the presence of the Canary Islands, the distribution of energy is fairly uniform throughout 
the year. 
 
In Figure 6, the average seasonal wave power at the 23 studied sites is plotted. This plot shows the 
strong seasonal character of Morocco’s wave energy, with a considerable range of variation 
between seasons, except at the aforementioned P21 and P22 sites. About 43% of Morocco’s 
annual wave power corresponds to winter, 26% to spring, 21% to autumn and 10% to summer, 
such that the wave energy resource is more than four times greater in winter than in summer.

In summary, four periods throughout the year can be distinguished from the point of view of the 
wave energy: a stormy period from November to March, with over 65% of the annual wave energy 
(average in all the area); a calm period from May to September with the 19% of the total wave

energy; two transitional periods (April and October) with intermediate wave energy conditions, 
accounting for almost 16% of the annual wave energy. This concentration of energy in the period 
between November and March is consistent with similar studies carried out in different areas of the 
Eastern Atlantic Ocean: Canary Islands [10, 16], Iceland [16], United Kingdom [17] and the Sea of 
Iroise [47], although in areas like Madeira and Azores Islands [16] or the West coast of France, 
October was also among the most energetic months. On the contrary, the seasonal distribution of 
wave energy is more uniform in areas of the Western Atlantic Ocean like Santa Catarina (Brazil) 
[48]. 
 
To conclude the temporal variability analysis the coefficients described in Section 2.2 have been 
computed and their values are shown in Table 3 and Figure 7. The three coefficients COV, SV and 
MV show a general decreasing trend from North to South, with some distortions in the southernmost 
part of the studied area due to the influence of the Canary Islands. Regarding the points with a 
larger wave energy potential, in the stretch P6-P9 the temporal variability is high, with MV varying 
between 1.56 and 1.69, SV between 1.47 and 1.60 and COV between 1.43 and 1.54. The following 
stretch going southwards (P10-P14) present less variability, with COV from 1.33 to 1.36, MV from 
1.44 to 1.49 and SV from 1.35 to 1.39. Finally, the points located near the southern end of the coast 
present the lowest variability coefficients. It is noticeable that P15 and P16, which have a 
considerable wave energy potential, have relatively low coefficients, in particular P16, with values of 
1.20 for SV, 1.26 for COV and 1.27 for MV. Therefore, these points show a priori a good potential 
for WEC deployment because they combine a significant wave energy resource with a more uniform 
distribution of the resource throughout the year. Other points located southward from P16 show less 
temporal variability, but the energy resource is also lower.

5.1. WEC output and performance 
 
The primary consideration for the deployment of a WEC at a certain site is the amount of wave 
power available at this point. In the previous section, the central stretch of the studied area (points 
P6 to P15 and, in particular from P8 to P12) was identified as that offering the greatest wave energy 
potential. Another factor to take into account in choosing a site for WEC installation is the temporal 
variability at different scales (daily, monthly and seasonal). Sites with moderate wave energy flux 
may be preferable than other where energy is higher but more unsteady (and, therefore, less 
reliable) because WEC efficiency may decrease significantly under more variable wave conditions 
[43]. In Figure 7 and in the previous Section it was shown that the lowest temporal variability is 
found in the southern part of the studied area, which is one of the less energetic, while the most 
energetic central stretch presents a medium temporal variability.

Another very important factor for verifying the suitability of a certain site for WECs deployment is the 
wave energy output delivered by the device installed at this point. The amount of electric energy 
delivered by a WEC depends on the average energy available at the location but also on the way in 
which this energy is scattered among the energy bins, defined by intervals of significant wave height 
and wave energy period [14]. This is because each WEC has its own power matrix, with a power 
output for each energy bin. 
 
With this aim, the scatter diagrams of Hs and Te have been obtained for the 23 studied points and 
some of them (those corresponding to the most energetic and therefore the a priori most suitable 
sites) are shown in Figures 8 and 9.

Figures 8 and 9 show the total annual energy that could be extracted from each sea state (at 
intervals of 1 s for the energy period and 0.5 m for the significant wave height). At each point, there 
is a zone with significant energy potential. At these four points the largest-energy area corresponds 
to periods between 10 and 15 s and wave heights between 1.5 and 4 m. Sea states with Hs 
between 1.5 and 4 m account for a considerable fraction of the total energy (between 67% and 
71%, depending on the point), as do the sea states with Te between 10 and 15 s (between 58% and 
62% depending on the point).  

In Figures 8 and 9 the energy roses are also plotted, showing that at these points almost all the 
wave energy comes from the sector between NW and N, being NNW the most energetic direction. 

Once the scatter diagrams have been obtained, the WEC energy output can be computed. As 
pointed out in Section 2.2, in this study two WECs whose power matrices are available in [14] have 
been considered: Pelamis [45] and Wave Dragon [46]. With their power matrices and the bin 
distribution of wave heights and periods, the power output is computed for the 2 WECs and the 23 
studied points (Figures 10 and 11 and Table 4). 

 

 
 

Figure 10. Annual wave energy output of the Pelamis WEC at the 23 studied points. 
 

It is interesting to notice that the two points (P10 and P11) with the highest energy potential are also 
those giving the largest energy outputs for both WECs. In the case of the Wave Dragon the energy 
output exceeds 15 GW h per year, while for the Pelamis the energy produced is slightly lower than 1 
GW h per year. With a decreasing productivity, the next most suitable locations for a Wave Dragon 
WEC are P9, P8 and P12, while for the Pelamis these positions are P15, P12, P16 and P19. The 
differences are probably due to the fact that Wave Dragon offers its best performance at wave 
periods between 10 and 15 s [14], while Pelamis gives the maximum output at wave periods 
between 6.5 and 11.5 s [14], being this last range more frequent in the southernmost part of the 
studied area. 
 
As indicated in Section 2.2, an indicator of the WEC efficiency is the capacity factor, which gives the 
ratio between the actual energy produced by the WEC and the hypothetical energy that it could 
produce operating all the time at its maximum rated power. In Table 4 and Figure 12 the capacity 
factors for both devices at the 23 studied points are shown. In the central part of the studied coast, 
the Wave Dragon reaches capacity factors between 22% and 25.5% decreasing towards both ends. 
The highest values of the capacity factor for the Pelamis are slightly lower than 15% and vary 



16 
 

between 12% and 14.7% in the central area of the Moroccan Atlantic coast, also decreasing 
towards the northern and southern ends.

5.2. WEC best location 

Besides the resource, there are further aspects of a site to be considered before selecting it to 
install a wave farm: its proximity to the coastline and to the electricity grid, its environmental impact 
at the site and on the coast, the possible interference with navigation or fishing activities, etc. [28]. 
From these factors, only those relative to the physical features of the site and to the wave energy 
potential and WEC performance have been considered herein to assess the best places for the 
deployment of the WECs. The remaining aspects fall outside the scope of this work, and have thus 
not been included in the analysis 
 
With regard to the energy, the parameters considered are the wave energy potential, the temporal 
distribution of waves and the WEC output. The wave energy potential indicates the total amount of 
energy existing at a point. The temporal variation of waves is also relevant because a lower 
temporal variability will result in better WEC efficiency. Finally, the WEC output is essential because 
it indicates if the grouping of waves in certain bins (ranges of Hs and Te) is suitable for a specific 
WEC to produce more energy.  
 
Regarding the site’s physical features, the two parameters considered are the water depth and the 
distance to the coast. Water depth is important because all the WEC systems have a recommended 
working depth. Thus, for the two WECs studied here, the recommended depths of deployment are 
>25 m for the Wave Dragon and >50 m for the Pelamis [29], but greater depths increase the 
mooring costs. On the other hand, the distance to the coast can be assumed as a proxy for the 
connection costs (the larger the distance, the greater the costs since more cable is necessary).  
 
The contribution of the wave power is assessed by computing the dimensionless normalized wave 
power index Pn as: 
 

max

i
n

P
P

P
                     (9) 

 



18 
 

where Pi is the average wave power at point i and Pmax is the maximum average wave power for all 
the reference points. 
 
In a similar way, a normalized capacity factor Cfn may be assessed for each considered WEC as: 
 

max

fi
fn

f

C
C

C
                     (10) 

 
where Cfi is the capacity factor at point i and Cfmax is the maximum capacity factor for a certain WEC 
and all the reference points. This normalized factor ranks the sites as a function of the WEC 
efficiency. 
 
To account for wave temporal variability, a parameter TV is computed as the average of the three 
coefficients that measure the temporal variability: COV, MV and SV. After this, a normalized 
parameter TVn is computed, bearing in mind that high values of TV should correspond to low values 
of TVn, since they indicate less suitability for WEC deployment. To compute TVn the following 
expression is used: 
 

min

max min

1 (1 ) in TH
TV TV

TV TV
TV TV


  


             (11) 

 
where TVi is the temporal variability parameter at point i, TVmax and TVmin are respectively the 
maximum and the minimum values at all the studied points and TVTH is a threshold value selected 
to give a minimum value to TVn. From expression (11), if TVi = TVmin then TVn = 1, while if TVi = 
TVmax then TVn = TVTH. A value TVTH = 0.3 has been arbitrarily assumed. 
 
The influence of the distance to the coast is taken into account in a similar way, computing a 
normalized distance index dn as: 
 

min

max min

1 (1 ) in TH
d d

d d
d d


  


                     (12) 

 
where di is the distance to the coast of point i, dmax and dmin are respectively the maximum and 
minimum distances to the coast from all the studied points and dTH is a threshold value (assumed 
0.3) to give a minimum value to dn. 
 
Finally, the water depth also intervenes in the suitability of a site for WEC deployment. To consider 
its contribution, a similar coefficient hn is computed as: 
 

min

max min

1 (1 ) in TH
h h

h h
h h


  


                    (13) 

 
 
where the meaning of the variables is the same as in the previous expressions, but referred to the 
water depth at each site. The main difference in this case is that the value of hmin is WEC-
dependent. Since the water depth at all the locations is larger than the minimum recommended 
depth for the Wave Dragon WEC, for this converter hmin is set to the minimum depth (35 m, at P17). 
On the other hand, the minimum recommended depth for the Pelamis converter is 50 m, so this is 
the value assumed for hmin for this WEC. At the locations shallower than 50 m (P17 and P20), hmin is 
set to zero for the Pelamis case.  
 



19 
 

Once these five normalized coefficients have been computed, they are combined in a multi-criteria 
analysis. Here, the same weight has been assumed for all the factors, although different weights 
could be defined if the manager or stakeholder responsible for the site  selection considers some 
factors to be more relevant than others. In the same way, the threshold values could also be 
changed. The analysis consists of calculating a simple WEC Location Suitability (WLS) index, as: 
 

n fn n n nWLS P C TV d h                         (14) 
 
The WLS index takes into account all the considered factors and those points having a greater WLS 
value will be the more suitable for WEC deployment. This is a flexible index that allows an easy 
integration of other factors which might be identified as significant in the process of defining the 
convenience of deploying WECs at a certain location. 
 
In Table 5 the values of the different coefficients integrating the WLS index are shown, while in 
Figure 13 the values of this suitability index at the 23 studied points are plotted. From these data, 
the most suitable points for WEC deployment are P11, P12 and P9 for both the Pelamis and the 
Wave Dragon converters. A second group of suitable points includes P16, P8 and P13, although the 
order differs between the Pelamis (P16, P8, P13) and the Wave Dragon (P8, P13, P16). Notice that 
P10, which has the largest wave energy potential, is not among the most suitable points for WEC 
installation.

In summary, the best area in the Atlantic coast of Morocco for deploying the 2 studied WECs is the 
stretch comprised between P8 and P13, with the exception of P10, which is penalized by its depth 
and its distance to the coast.  
 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
Nowadays, and in spite of its large potential for wind and solar energies, only 10% of the energy 
production in Morocco is from renewable sources, mainly hydraulic and wind energy. In this study, 
the wave energy resource along its Atlantic coast is assessed using a 44-year series of data 
obtained from numerical modeling (hindcasting). 
 
The wave power is analyzed using data from 23 points between latitudes 27ºN and 35º45’N. The 
average wave power obtained is considerable (up to 30 kW/m with average annual wave energy up 
to 262 MW h/m) and slightly lower than at the neighboring Canary Islands. 
 
The spatial distribution of wave energy along Morocco’s Atlantic coast shows a large variability, with 
a high-energy stretch in the central part of this area (between latitudes 29º30’N and 34ºN). On the 
contrary, at both ends of the coast the wave energy potential is lower due to the shadow effects 
generated by the Iberian Peninsula in the North and the Canary Islands in the South. About 60% of 
the energy is concentrated in wave periods between 10 and 15 s and about 70% in wave heights 
between 1.5 and 4 m. Regarding the wave directionality, waves from N, NNW and NW are the most 
energetic. 
 
The temporal variability of wave energy along the Morocco’s Atlantic coast shows a clear seasonal 
pattern, with a high-energy winter (43% in average), a mild summer (10%) and intermediate-energy 
spring and autumn (with 26% and 21% respectively). There is also a significant monthly variability, 
with January being the highest-energy month (followed by December and February) and July 
(followed by August and June) the mildest one.

Taking into account the power matrices of two WECs (Pelamis and Wave Dragon), the energy 
output and the capacity factor are computed at the 23 studied points. Finally, a multi-criteria 
analysis is carried out considering five different factors, combined into a single WEC Location 
Suitability (WLS) index, in order to select the best places for WEC deployment. These factors are: 
the wave power at the point, the WEC capacity factor, the energy temporal variability, the distance 
to the coast and the water depth at the point. The analysis of the WLS index allows identifying 
points P11, P12 and P9, in the central stretch of the study area, as the optimal places for WEC 
installation along the Moroccan Atlantic coast.
