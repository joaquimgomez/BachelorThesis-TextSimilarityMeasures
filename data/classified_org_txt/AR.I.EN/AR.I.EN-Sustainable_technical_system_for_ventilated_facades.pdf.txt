1. CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES FOR THE FAÇADES OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 
 
Façades of residential buildings in Spain have been built usually out of brick.  The most com-
monly used construction technique (from inner to outer) has consisted of: plaster siding, a 7.5 
cm partition wall, an air chamber with neither ventilation nor drainage, thermal insulation of 
variable thickness and an exterior wall made of brick, either 11.5 or 14 cm, with or without ex-
terior cladding.  Carefully implemented, this construction technique complies fairly well with 
the Technical Building Code’s current  basic requirements for façades: (1) safety in the event of 
fire, thermal and acoustical insulation, resistance and stability against wind loads, and imperme-
ability (waterproofness). 
 
The appearance and fast growth of the construction model known as “rain screen” (2), or “venti-
lated façade,” has come about because of an inability to insulate properly the edge of the 
framework, generating thermal bridges; compatibility problems resulting from the wide dimen-
sional tolerances of the concrete structures; and above all, the architects’ desire to experiment 
with new products and materials in the building of façades. This new construction technique 
(technique 1) consists (from inner to outer) of:  one or two sheets of plasterboard attached to 
flashings, an 11.5 or 14 cm brick wall, thermal insulation of variable thickness, a ventilated and 
drained chamber, and a cladding system of rigid plates with specific fastenings.  The cladding 
system is usually attached to the wall and to the edges of the framework.   
 
At present, various cladding systems have been developed and optimised for this type of façade; 
in particular, asbestos cement, thermo-hardened resin or porcelainised stoneware plates.  This 
construction technique complies well with some of the demands imposed upon the façade:  
thermal and acoustical insulation and impermeability; but a thorough analysis is required with 
regard to the problem of safety in the event of fire, because of the risk of a fire spreading 
through the chamber to the entire façade (3).    
 
One cannot disregard wind activity either; suction and/or pressures, usually weak, that may act 
on the plates as a result of the compartmentalization of the air chamber, or on the inner masonry 
wall (4).  Despite these inconveniences, this type of construction technique is gaining ground on 
façades for residential, administrative, hospital, and school buildings.

ABSTRACT:  This paper studies industrial systems of facades ventilated from market products, 
detachable and recyclables. Also it assessments the probable durability of the components of the 
facade, it tracks his service life and it determines the environmental impact that it causes due to 
the energy and CO2 produced in the obtaining and manufacture of the materials that compose it. 



Lately, a further step has been taken.  In some projects, mainly in hotels and dwellings, the brick 
wall has been substituted by a sandwich made of steel plate sections that act as resistant ele-
ments, acoustical and thermal insulation, one or more sheets of pla sterboard as cladding for the 
inner side, and a special asbestos cement plate as cladding for the side that is exposed to the 
elements.  Sometimes the asbestos cement side is clad with complementary thermal insulation to 
minimise the thermal bridges caused by steel plate vertical girders or by the edges of the frame-
work.  This construction technique (technique 2) is complemented, similarly to the prior tech-
nique, with a system of exterior cladding made of rigid plates with specific fastenings.   The 
tremendous popularity of this technique is a result both of the elimination of humid conditions 
in the façade's building stage, and of the search for more industrialised building processes that 
generate less waste during construction, waste that is lighter and not as thick as that generated 
by previously described techniques.  
 
Nonetheless, the substitution of one type of façade construction technique for another cannot be 
automatic, inasmuch as the brick wall unquestionably helps to achieve technical benefits that 
could not otherwise be easily accomplished.   We refer in particular to acoustical insulation, im-
permeability to wind, safety in the event of fire, and even resistance and stability of the cladding 
system.  
 
First and foremost, the façade must be solid and durable; must  create comfort, primarily ther-
mal, acoustical and with reference to light, in inner spaces; must be wate rproof; must be safe in 
case of fire; and must be energy efficient.   
 
This paper analyses various ventilated façade techniques that are being built in Spain at present, 
with similar technical benefits:  construction techniques 1 and 2, with different types of cladding 
systems: (A) porcelainised stoneware plates, (B) thermo-hardened resin plates, and (C) asbestos 
cement plates, comparing different parameters: weight per square meter – energy consumption 
of  materials – CO2 production.

3. RESULTS OBTAINED 
 
Resulting values as to weight (K/m²), energy utilised (MJ/m²) and CO2  production (K/m2) are 
recorded on the spreadsheet attached to this paper, obtained from ITEC’s DB Table (9), for fa-
çade construction techniques 1 and 2, as well as for the three types of exterior cladding (A, B 
and C).  
 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS  
 
4.1 Concerning construction techniques 1 and 2. 
 
• Construction technique 2 is lighter than technique 1 (0.584 KN/m² against 2.51 KN/m2).  In 
buildings with a large number of stories, this feature allows a reduction in the amount of mate-
rial needed for construction of the structure and foundation, which is a positive result because of 
a reduction in the level of CO2  emitted during manufacture of these materials, as well as in the 
energy consumed in said processes.   
 
• Construction technique 2 requires more energy per square meter than technique 1 for its 
manufacture (1032.40 MJ/m² against 694.65 Mj/m²).   Moreover, construction technique 2 pro-
duces larger quantities of CO2 in the manufacture of its materials than construction technique 1, 
(88.23 Kg CO2 /m² against 54.93 Kg CO2 /m²). One could evaluate for a particular building the 
influence on the final result of the reduction in materials for structure and foundation because of 
the lighter weight of construction technique 2.    Another conclusion derived is that  construc-
tion technique 2 should have a smaller thermal transmittance value so as to compensate during 
its useful life for the excess energy and CO2 production that it has as opposed to construction 
technique 1.  This conclusion, arising as it does from the sustainability approach, agrees with the 
thermal comfort approach, inasmuch as construction techniques with little thermal inertia, as is 
the case with construction technique 2, require more thermal insulation to compensate for their 
quick thermal response to outside weather changes.  
 
 
4.2 Concerning the exterior cladding of plates.  
 
• All three claddings present a similar surface weight (weight of cladding A = 0.274 KN/m²; 
weight of cladding B = 0.179 KN/m²; weight of cladding C = 0.199 KN/m²). 
 
• The three claddings present considerable differences as to the energy required to manufac-
ture the various materials of which they are composed (cladding A, of porcelainised stoneware 



plates, 1223.81 Mj/m²; cladding B, of thermo-hardened synthetic resin plates, 702.53 Mj/m²; 
cladding C, of asbestos cement plates, 303.62 Mj/m²). These differences particularly have to do 
with the material used in the manufacture of the metallic sections that comprise the substructure, 
thus, the use of a material requiring less energy would improve the cladding solution.  An im-
portant point, unavailable to us, would be to ascertain the useful life of each cladding, which 
would allow an evaluation of the energy rate consumed for each year of useful life.   The mate-
rials that comprise the chosen claddings allow closing of their respective cycles by means of re-
cycling.  
 
• Similarly, the three claddings present considerable differences regarding CO2 emissions 
produced when manufacturing the various materials of which they are composed (cladding A, of 
porcelainised stoneware plates, 166.23 Kg CO2 /m²; cladding B, of hardened synthetic resin 
plates, 84.18 Kg CO2 /m²; cladding C, of asbestos cement plates, 29.02 Kg CO2 /m²). These dif-
ferences particularly have to do with the material used in the manufacture of the metallic sec-
tions that comprise the substructure, thus the use of a material that would emit less CO2 during 
its manufacture would improve the cladding solution.  An important point, unavailable to us, 
would be to ascertain the useful life of each cladding, which would allow an evaluation of the 
rate of CO2 that has been emitted for each year of useful life.   
 
4.3 Concerning the whole of the construction techniques for ventilated façades.  
 
• Different combinations of construction techniques (1 and 2) and exterior claddings pre-
sent big differences with regard to the energy required and CO2 emitted in manufacture of the 
materials: 
 
Construction technique 2 + cladding A: (2556.21 Mj/m2 and 255.16 Kg CO2 /m2) 
 
Construction technique 1 + cladding C: (998.27 Mj/m2 and 83.95 Kg CO2 /m2). 
 
These differences cannot be taken as definitive when selecting materials for the ventilated fa-
çade, but rather as a clear reference; as it has been said earlier, the cladding material’s useful life 
is an important piece of information that depends on the environmental characteristics of the site 
where it is placed.   
 
4.4 Final conclusions.  
 
• Generalised adoption of industrialised construction techniques to build façades will im-
ply larger energy consumption and CO2 emissions that can only be compensated by a decrease 
in the amount of material for structure and foundation because of its lesser weight.  
 
A possibly negative final impact with regard to the environment should be balanced by im-
provement of the thermal insulation for the techniques and with a larger useful life for these.  
 
• Despite the larger energy consumption and CO2 emission, industrialised and light con-
struction techniques for façades permit a better use of the materials that integrate them when 
they are able to close the life cycle through recycling or even through reuse of the materials.  
 
• It is possible that industrialised construction techniques for wood with simple fastenings 
may add a reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions during manufacture to the better 
use and recycling of the materials.
