Abstract. The influence of risk perception and risk attitudes in the process of accepting genetically 
modified (GM) food is often ignored, and particularly whether both constructs (latent variables) have a 
combined effect in explaining consumer acceptance. Similarly, the inclusion of organic product standards 
juxtaposed to GM food is unknown. This paper attempts to shed some light on this question by examining 
the decision making process through the use of structural equation modeling (SEM). We use survey data 
from Spain and a set of theoretical constructs that allow us to identify independent mechanisms 
underlying individuals’ risk decision making. Our results suggest that the conceptualized model captures 
the decision making process, and that both perceptions and attitudes toward risk have independent effects 
on consumer acceptance. However, the effect from risk perception is larger in intensity. Finally, attitudes 
towards organic production emerge as an informative determinant of attitudes towards GM food. 

Keywords: Keywords: risk perceptions, consumer acceptance, risk attitudes, and GM food.

1. Introduction 

Consumer behaviour regarding food has been widely analysed over time.  However technology changes 
bring new behavioural dimensions that shift decision making processes.  Few theories have been 
proposed to unveil the formation process of behaviour. Among the most cited work stands the “Theory of 
Reasoned Action” (TRA) (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975). The TRA focuses on the determinants of 
behavioural intentions to objects of choice where individuals have sufficient control over their decisions 
when they have perfect information. This is not the case with newly commercialised products made from 
the use of new technologies. Therefore, it seems natural to expand the TRA to technology decision 
making concerning the choice scenarios where information is far from perfect, which has been developed 
through the “Theory of Planned Behaviour” (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991). Indeed, the latter implies the 
introduction of an “incomplete volitional control” parameter as a determinant for consumers’ behaviour. 
Hence, individuals decide their actions with regard to future consequences, conditioned upon available 
information. Moreover, it states that either intentions or behaviour are a function of personal attitudes 
towards the behaviour; personal perception of social pressure; and individually perceived behavioural 
control of the corresponding intention (Ajzen, 2005).  

 

Risk perception is qualified as an important construct to understanding decision making when individuals 
lack full information (Fischhoff et al., 1993).  This last element of control, which very much depends on 
the available information that people receive, is hypothesised to be a central element for GM food 
consumer intentions as well as for other consumer food choices. “Perceived behavioural control” is 
defined by Ajzen (2005), as a function of beliefs concerning the presence or absence of factors that help 
or obstruct the execution of behaviour. Interestingly, perceived potential hazards related to behaviour, 
namely risk perceptions, have been shown to be important determinants of this control issue. Fischoff et 
al. (1993) argue that individuals need to not only understand the costs and benefits of behavioural choices 
but also the limits to their knowledge and that of experts.   

 

The way in which the mind interprets intuitive feelings varies depending on the type and availability of 
information about the risk at the time of decision-making (Slovic et al., 2004). A wide range of literature 
has concluded that people overestimate low risks and underestimate high probability risks (Kahneman 
and Tversky, 1979; Viscusi, 1992; and Hurley and Shogren, 2005).  The risks of GM food are of 
particular importance due to its technical nature that determine a set of behavioural processes that need to 
be disentangled and better understood.   Hence the association between risk consumer perceptions 
regarding GM food consumption is of particular importance, especially when intermediate risk attitudes 
influence the decision making process.  

 

The adequacy of conventional risk models, which assume full knowledge of outcomes and probabilities, 
has been questioned by studies, including Yeung and Morris (2006), in the context of consumer behaviour 
when potential hazards that threaten food safety. This is because consumers are subject to high levels of 
“uncertainty” regarding the consequences of their behaviour. In that case, neither identities nor relative 
probabilities of possible consequences are known by consumers and consequently an ambiguity situation 
exists. Ambiguity has been defined by Frisch and Baron (1988) as “the subjective experience of missing 
information relevant to a prediction”. When this ambiguity situation exists, consumers do not perceive 
control over the situation and therefore perceptions of risk increase due to the existence of ambiguity 
aversion described in several studies (see Slovic and Tversky, 1974; Saring and Weber, 1993; and Costa-
Font and Mossialos, 2007). This explains the need for new models to analyze factors affecting potential 
food risk perception and its relation with consumer intentions from a more psychological standpoint.

The subjective dimensions affecting the intensity of risks perceptions in the case of GM food include the 
involuntariness of some aspects of risk-taking behaviour, the lack of knowledge about a certain risks and 
particularly the existence of dread associated with the risk, the immediacy, irreversibility and intensity of 
impacts, the possibilities to control or reduce the risk, and others (Kasperson et al., 1988).   There is also 
evidence of gender-specific effects on risk perceptions (Hurley and Shogren, 2005). Another important 
bias affecting the way people perceive risks of GM food is referred to as availability bias, which acts as a 
heuristic in the risk assessment process when individuals judge the likelihood of an event taking place 
based upon the mind’s ability to recall previous occurrences of the same event (Tversky and Kahneman, 
1973; Slovic et al., 1981).  

 

In addition to how people perceive risks of GM food, another important dimension to evaluate includes 
risks attitudes – in the form of risk aversion, proxied by insurance behaviour- in influencing consumer 
acceptance. Yet, the net effects of risk attitudes, once risks perceptions are controlled for, are still a matter 
of academic scrutiny.  Weber and Hsee (1998) argue that culture might significantly affect risk 
perceptions situational determinants, which might also impact risks aversion. As a result, the final amount 
risk individuals take on, results from the combination of both risks attitudes and perceptions. Though, it is 
important to separate individual preferences and certain technologies, it is also important to separate the 
specific influence of risk perception from the influence of risk attitudes. Measurement is another issue 
concerning risks and attitudes. Risk attitudes are measured through different theoretical approaches 
(Hartog et al., 2002) or indirectly via survey data (Barsky et al., 1997). However, a straightforward way to 
identify risks attitudes is by assuming revealed preferences so that those who are risk averse would tend 
to purchase different forms of insurance. The latter is the approach followed in this study by disentangling 
the individual’s effects of risk attitudes and perceptions in determining acceptance of GM food.  

 

This paper attempts to shed some light on this question by examining the decision making process 
drawing form structural equation modelling. We use survey data from Spain and a set of constructs that 
allow us to identify independent mechanisms underling individuals’ decision making. Our results suggest 
that the conceptualised model captures the decision making process, and that both risk perceptions and 
risk attitudes have independent effects on consumer acceptance. However, the effect of risk perception is 
larger in intensity. A further step in this study will be to examine the other two elements of the TPB: 
namely that wider attitudes towards a specific behaviour and the perception of social pressure (of 
“perceived social norms”) offer a more complete picture of individuals’ behavioural process towards GM 
food, alongside its environmental influences.  

 

The paper is structured as follows: section two present a theoretical framework and the hypothesis of 
analysis. Next, section three exposes the methodology of analysis as well as the sample description, 
followed by section four that provides the results of the study. Finally, section five contains conclusions 
and discussion.    

 

2. Background 

2.1. The formation of risks perception, attitudes and consumer acceptance 

One of the main theories regarding the formation of consumer attitudes towards a product is the Fishbein 
Multi-attribute Model (Fishbein, 1963), which implies that an attitude towards any product is based on 
knowledge about the product itself and its attributes.  In fact, many studies, by means of choice 
experiments or experimental beats among other methods, attempt to analyse the most important attributes 
that consumers take into account when purchasing food products. Indeed, there is a broad variety of 
attributes such as price, ingredients, brand, origin, appearance, freshness and so forth.  Moreover, the 



4 

importance of each attribute depends on the type of food under selection. Consumers generally take into 
consideration the price as a basic criterion when undertaking purchasing decisions. However, in food 
related decisions, other elements such as external appearance are considered as quality indicators for 
which consumers are willing to pay a premium (Alfnes et al., 2006). Contrary, Gianni et al. (2002) found 
that visual appearance is not significant when defining consumers’ preferences for organic food. 
Similarly, food expectations of taste or flavour have been found to be important predictors of general food 
consumption behaviour by Shepherd and Raats (1996). Taste or sensory appeals are also frequently 
mentioned as criteria when food is described either positively or negatively (Steptoe et al., 1995). Finally, 
price, tenderness or food safety was noticed as significant for US consumers beef selection (Loureiro, 
2007).  That is, preferences are expected to influence consumption (Olsen, 2003).  

 

However, these preferences towards a product and its attributes - particularly for the case of GM food - 
are shaped by personal characteristics and individual values (Grunert et al., 2003 and 2004; Bredahl, 
2001; and Saher et al., 2006). A relevant theory regarding the role of values on consumer attitude 
formation is the ‘means-end’ approach . Grunert et al. (2001), prove this theory with some European 
consumers that reveal to prefer conventional products to GM products essentially because of the 
conventional means of production. Conventional products are associated with safety and health, while 
GM products are associated with uncertainty and poor health. A handful of studies have evaluated the 
influence of affective and moral considerations on product perceptions and purchase decisions. Arvola et 
al. (2008) stated that Organic Food (OF) purchases are motivated by expected positive consequences for 
the self and for others, based on moral considerations. That is “measure reflecting positive, self-rewarding 
feeling of ‘doing the right thing’, seems to be useful especially in understanding, but in some cases also in 
predicting intentions to buy organic foods” (Arvola et al., 2008). This building perception approach 
explains the fact, revealed by Saher et al., (2006), that even with little scientific support, OF is strongly 
considered by consumers to be healthier and more nutritious than regular food.   

 

Following Chen and Li (2007) it should come as no surprising that people resort to their more general 
attitudes for evaluating new and unfamiliar GM foods. As Brendahl (2001) concluded, attitudes towards 
food are related to several antecedent factors: attitude toward technology, attitude towards nature, food 
neophobia, among others.  Therefore, it is important to understand consumers’ general attitudes regarding 
science, technology, and technological progress, in order to be aware of their associated risk perception 
(Bredahl, 2001 and Sparks et al., 1994). The same can be applied to food technology and GM food 
technology.  Consumers with high levels of food neophobia are less likely to try “unfamiliar” foods, such 
as GM food (Chen and Li, 2007). Moreover, Krishna and Qaim (2008), by means of a contingent 
valuation approach, observed that consumers who do not pay a lot of attention to the risk of pesticide 
residues are also not significantly concerned with potential GM food risks.  This is contrary to risk-averse 
consumers concerned about both types of risk who directly prefer organically produced vegetables for 
which the reduction in pesticides residues would not be associated with a new type of risk. A similar 
conclusion was made by Roe and Teisl (2004) for U.S. respondents. They showed that US consumers 
were more favourably disposed to purchasing novel products made entirely of GE ingredients if they 
believed that conventional products in the market place also contained high levels of GE content. 
Moreover, consumers with lower levels of concern do not display an externality unless exposed to a label 
highlighting that he long term consequences of GE ingredients are unknown (full information). Certainly, 
consumers appear to be cautious about accepting novel technologies applied to food because of perceived 
risks and lack of benefits, or to avoid unknown risk than to get an additional benefit (Christoph et al., 
2006). In fact, Cox et al. (2007) observed that people favoured regular prawns to those treated with novel 
technologies such as irradiation, triploid and electron beam. Moreover, they also observed that addressing 
an “information deficit” does not overcome aversion to novel technologies applied to food concepts 

 

A negative relationship has been observed when valuing GM and organic food. Dreezens et al. (2005) 
observed that consumers relate GM to power and universalism values contrary to OF. This was also 
demonstrated by Saher et al. (2006) and Burton et al. (2001). Their results from a choice experiment 



5 

indicate that attitudes towards organic food may be taken as a useful indicator of attitudes towards GM 
technology. In addition, Saher et al. (2006) explained this negative relation by means of the so-called 
behavioural inhibition responses to novel and negative situations. He stated that since GM is associated 
with risk and OF with avoidance of it, there must be a negative relation between behavioural inhibition 
tendencies and GM attitudes and a positive relation for OF attitudes. This inhibition was also asserted by 
Lind et al. (2005), who relate subjective food hypersensitivity with concern to food additives and GM 
food. Finally, Devcich et al. (2007) found that people with high “modern health worries ” were more 
likely to choose functional foods with disease-preventing properties than either risk-reducing or 
appearance-enhancing properties. Moreover, they also found that modern health worries were 
significantly associated with a higher use of organic foods.  

 

In the case of GM food risks or other food related risks, such as pesticide risk, existing information does 
not allow individuals to form objective risks estimates. Therefore risk perceptions are the result of 
perceptions of uncertain damage (Costa-Font and Mossialos, 2007). Indeed, ambiguity might lead 
individuals to develop the perception that technology is not under their control thus leading to a social 
amplification of risk (ambiguity-adverse) (Costa-Font and Mossialos, 2007), and therefore, are adopted as 
a potential risk to be avoided (Chen and Li, 2007). Furthermore, Eom (1994) compared the effects of risk 
information across models and observed that technical risk information does not significantly affect 
purchase intentions for safer produce until we explicitly introduce subjective beliefs about risk and 
demographic characteristics in risk perceptions. This study also concludes that consumers were willing to 
pay substantially higher price premiums for safer produce, in return for only small reductions in risk. 
Moreover, the price premium was insensitive to the amounts of risk reduction evaluated. Indeed, Baker 
and Burnham (2001) found the level of risk aversion to be a significant factor in determining which 
consumers were accepting or disapproving genetic engineering technology. Finally, a direct relation 
between perceived risks and consumer attitude or purchase intentions towards GM food and GM-free 
food has been confirmed by many studies such as Siegrist (1999 and 2000); Tanaka (2004); Yeung and 
Morris (2006); Loureiro and Bugbee (2005); and Bukenya and Wright (2007) among others. Moreover 
two characteristics of risk were also shown to have direct influence on purchase likelihood. “Perceived 
knowledge” and “own control” which has a positive relationship with purchase likelihood. (Yeung and 
Morris, 2006). 

Base on the previous findings discussed above, the main factors affecting potential food risk perception 
and its relation with consumer purchasing intentions were presented in Figure 1 and summarized in the 
following hypothesis of analysis:  

 

H1: Consumers that reveal a positive attitude towards sensory considerations associated to naturalness 
and safe food - flavour, freshness and appearance- are expected to reveal a positive attitude towards 
organic food production standards.  

H2: Consumers that perceive more risks associated with general food production technologies are 
expected to reveal a positive attitude towards organic production standards.   

H3: Consumers that perceive more risks associated with general food production technologies are 
expected to perceived more risk of GMF.  

H4: Consumers that reveal a positive attitude towards organic production standards are expected to 
perceive more risks associated with GMF.  

H5: A perceived risk of GMF is expected to negatively influence consumer purchase intentions towards 
GM food.  

H6: Consumer risk- aversion is expected to negatively influence consumer purchase intentions towards 
GM food.

3. Data and Methods 

3.1. The sample   

The data used in this study is a separate part of the survey described in chapter 3.  It was administered, 
during spring 2007 by a face to face questionnaire. A total of 314 final questionnaires were used and 
distributed among 6 regions in almost equal percentages –Galicia, Murcia, Andalusia, Madrid, 
Extremadura and Catalonia. The sample age distribution was almost equal among predefined age groups 
starting at 18 years old and up to +65.  Moreover, 80% of respondents are located in the medium income 
level and 15% of the sample are in the high household income, while the remaining 5% is allocated into 
the lowest income category.  There is a clear majority of females among Spanish respondents (about 
80%).  More than 60% of Spanish respondents continue educational studies after 16 years old. However, 
only about 25% of respondents attended higher education. About 5% do not respond to this question. 
Finally, around 60% of the respondents do not have children in school or at pre-school age. Moreover, 
18% have only one child, from where 36% are pre-school age and 44% in school age. The remaining 10% 
have two or more children, while 18% of them are pre-school age. 

3.2. Measurement 

We have considered, as the literature points out, that responses range from agree to disagree going 
through some uncertainty threshold (Gaskell et al., 2004; Gaskell et al., 2006; and O’Connor et al., 2006). 
Therefore, “don’t know” answers are classified as “undecided or indifference” which are accordingly 
placed somewhere between acceptance and rejection (Costa-Font and Mossialos, 2007). 

 

All attitudinal questions and food technology risk perceptions were measured on a 5-level Likert scale, 
where “totally disagree” or “not at all important” responses are codified by an ordinal value of 1, “tend to 
disagree” or “not very important” by 2, “undecided or indifference” by 3, “tend to agree” or “important” 
by ordinal value 4 and finally, “totally agree” or “very important” by value 5. Questions regarding 
purchase intentions were measured in a 3-level Likert scale: “not willing to pay” (1), “willing to pay les 
than for conventional products” (2) and finally “willing to pay more than for conventional products” (3). 
Finally, in order to value risk aversion respondents were asked about their contracted insurances. A 
dichotomous variable was constructed to differentiate between those having contracted a compulsory 
insurance and those who did not. The list of indicators for each construct is shown in Table 1.    

[Insert Table 1 about here] 

 

3.3. Analytical procedures 

Structural equation modelling has been used in this study in order to arrange the decision making 
process. Indeed, the structural regression (SR) model has been tested following a two-step modelling 
approach (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988), where we first define an acceptable confirmatory factor analysis 
(CFA) and next an adequate SR model.   

 
Following Jöreskog and Sörbom (1996), we have specified a Structural Equation Model which 

consists of three main types of relationships. First, a measurement model is identified after performing 
confirmatory factor analysis. The outcome relates, on one hand, observed indicators with the exogenous 
latent variables;   
  x = Λ x   ξ + δ   (1) 
 
where x, is a q × 1 vector of observed exogenous or independent variables, Λ x is a q × n matrix of 
coefficients of the regression of x on ξ, ξ is an n × 1 random vector of latent independent variables and δ  
is a q × 1 vector of error terms in x. 
 

 On the other hand, observed indicators are related with the endogenous constructs; 



7 

  y   = Λ y   η + ε   (2)  
 

where y, is a p × 1 vector of observed endogenous or dependent variables, Λ y is a p × m matrix of 
coefficients of the regression of y  on η, η is an m × 1  random vector of latent dependent variables and ε 
is a p × 1 vector of measurement errors in y.   
 
 A third equation defines the structural model, which specifies the causal relations that exist 
among the latent variables, while describing its causal effects and assigns the explained and unexplained 
variances (Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1996). 
 
  η   = B η + Г ξ + ζ             (3)  
 
where B is a m × m matrix of coefficients of the η variables in the structural relationship, Г is a m × n 
matrix of coefficients of the ξ - variables in the structural relationship, and ζ is a vector of errors.   
 
 This study uses ordinal data, arguably a rudimentary measurement of continuous variables, 
where the scale is considered as thresholds of the continuous variables (Jöreskog, and Sörbom, 1996). 
Correlations among ordinal variables are called polychoric correlations, which are theoretical correlations 
of the continuous version (Jöreskog, and Sörbom, 1996). In order to perform the analysis we use the 
Generalized Weighted Least-Squares (WLS) method instead of Maximum likelihood (ML) since both the 
data present a nonnormal distribution and because ML does not allow us to employ the weighting matrix 
required for the analysis, which is the inverse of the estimated asymptotic covariance matrix, W , of the 
polychoric correlations (Kline, 2005).  
 

F (ө) = ( s – σ)’ W ( s – σ)        (4)    
 

where s’ is a vector of the elements in the lower half of the covariance matrix S of order k × k, σ’ is the 
vector of corresponding elements of Σ (ө), W -1 is the positive definite matrix of order u× u where u = k 
(k+1)/2. The WLS function is the weighted computation of the square residuals (Barrio and Luque, 
2000).  
 
 Finally, we will assess the goodness-of-fit of the model by analysing factor loadings, which 
relate each indicator with the constructs. Reliability will be measured by means of composite reliability 
and Cronbach’s α. Moreover, the extracted validity for each construct will be also measured (Hair et al., 
1999).  
 

Regarding the structural model, we begin with an assessment of the significance of the estimated 
parameters in the structural equations (Hair et al., 1999). We proceed with estimating the reliability 
coefficients of each equation and the associated correlation matrix among constructs examined in our 
model (Barrio and Luque, 2000). Finally, diagnostic parameters such as Chi square (X2); Root Mean 
Square Error of Approximation (RMSE); Goodness of Fit Index (GFI); the Adjusted Goodness of Fit 
Index (AGFI); the Comparative-Fit-Index (CFI); the Normed-Fit-Index (NFI) and the Non Normed-Fit-
Index (NNFI) will be also considered as indicators of the model goodness-of-fit for the CFA and the SR 
model.  

4. Results 

4.1. Descriptive Analysis 

The survey employed for this analysis asked respondents questions regarding food purchasing 
behaviour such as: food qualities that can influence food purchasing, awareness of GM issues, 
information sources about genetic engineering in food production and finally attitudes towards GM 
technology and organic products/methods. Although not all these questions have been used for the 
development of the structural equation model, a brief description of its results is reported in this section in 
order to better understand the general behaviour of participants.

Based on the theoretical framework, this study assumes that when purchasing food people value 
a diverse range of attributes. In order to develop which are more relevant, this survey presents 
respondents a list of food attributes that can arguably influence food purchasing and asks them a value 
based on five Likert scale ranges – from 1 not at all important to 5 very important1. Actually, as Figure 2 
shows, freshness and flavour are the most important parameters for food purchasing decision. This is the 
case for almost 70% of respondents. These dimensions are followed by use-by-date and appearance, 
which are very important for 50-60% of respondents. Moreover, ingredients and price rank high for about 
40% of respondents. Finally, brand dimensions and production location are very important for only 12% 
of respondents.  

 
[Insert Figure 2 about here] 

 
The next behavioural element which has been accounted for in our survey design was people’s 

knowledge about GM food technology. Here it is important to acknowledge the complexity of measuring 
this issue.  Indeed, at least two broad types of knowledge can be defined. First, objective knowledge refers 
to what people know about something based on some type of examination or facts. The latter type is not 
as easy to disentangle due to difficulties in coming up with unbiased indicators and is ignored in this 
study. Instead, an index of subjective knowledge –namely, what people suggest to know about some 
object- was elicited, by means of a direct question: How knowledgeable are you on the issue of genetic 
engineering in food production? Up to 60% of respondents see themselves as not very well or not at all 
informed about GM food. In addition, about 15% of respondents consider themselves as quite or well 
informed. The remaining 25% are not able to value their knowledge degree. This question supports the 
hypothesis of Spaniards as exhibiting an extremely low level of knowledge regarding GM food, 
consistent with Martinez et al. (2004); Noomene and Gil (2004); and Vilella-Vila et al. (2005). 

 
Not only was the level of knowledge accounted for but also its trust with information sources. 

Indeed, if individuals would follow some kind of Bayesian updating, then the sources of information are 
key. Hence, our survey requested respondents to reveal their information sources of trust about genetic 
engineering in food production. As Figure 3 shows, Spanish respondents trust more consumer 
organizations, followed by medical doctors and commercial scientists. Next in the rank comes university 
scientists and environmental groups, both closely followed by the mass media. The last reliable source of 
information was producers or retailers (who might be perceived as self interested parties) along with 
government and EU institutions. These findings are consistent with previous results such as 
Eurobarometer surveys (Gaskell et al., 2003; 2004; 2006)2.Finally, it is important to highlight that 
Spaniards, when compared with other Eueopean respondents are found to reveal significantly lower level 
of trust with respect to national and European institutions.

Public attitudes towards GM and organic foods were measured through five-point Likert scale –
from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree3.  As Table 2 exhibits, the statement that people agree most 
refers to the consumers’ right to choosing between GM and not GM food. Finally, the survey finds that 
what respondents tend to agree less regarding the possibility of GM technology developing healthier 
foods. In addition, it is also important to highlight the high level of “Neither agree nor disagree” and 
“Don’t Know” answers. These answers, commonly come from people with not a clear position regarding 
GM food, named as “undecided”. This is consistent with preceding results about subjective knowledge. 
Indeed, for the statement regarding environmental effects of GM crops, more than 50% of respondents 
can be labelled as “undecided”. Moreover, the chance to develop healthier food is not clear for almost 
half of the respondents. Finally, about 40% of respondents do not really know if GM food might harm 
their environment.  

                                                           
1 In order to contrast the internal consistency of responses we employed Cronbach’s alpha. It is important 
to note that we attain a coefficient of 0.64, which indicates an acceptable reliability. 
2 Indeed, gasket el al 2006 find that Europeans’ most trusted stakeholders are doctors, university scientists 
and consumer organisations, followed by scientists working in industry, newspapers and magazines, 
environmental groups, shops, farmers and the EU 
3 We have looked at the reliability of responses using Crombach alpha coefficient, interestingly it is of 
0.74, which indicates a very good reliability or internal consistency.

In relation to organic food (see Table 3) 4, 82% of Spanish respondents are highly worried about 
the harmful effects of chemical residues in food. In the same fashion, effects of agriculture on the 
environment are also envisioned as an issue which alarms at least 68% of the Spanish sample. For the 
other raised statements – if organic production managed to taste better than conventional food – there is a 
clear propensity to agree with the statement. Nevertheless, many people do not have an opinion. That is, 
43% of the sample “neither agree nor disagree” or “Don’t know” (see Table 3).

In relation to organic food, a declared behavioural question was also included: the food 

expenditure allocated to organic products. Results indicate, as expected, that Spanish consumers do not 
spend much money on organic products. More precisely, respondents’ budget allocated for organic 
consumption is around 10%. Indeed, more than 25% of Spanish respondents reveal no purchase of 
organic food at all. Moreover, almost 30% do invest from 1 to 10% of their food budged on organic food 
and only 20% devote more than 10% of their budget to organic consumption.      

 
The last part of the survey analyses questions related to risk perception and attitudes or risk 

taking. To tackle these issues, two related questions are introduced. On the one hand, respondents were 
requested to reveal which type of non compulsory insurances they hold (as a proxy to measure risk 
aversion). The widely held insurances are car and life insurances. Health care insurances are less 
demanded, possibly due to the relevant public sector role in health care. On the other hand, respondents 
were requested to rank in a Likert scale from 1 to 5 –1 very high risk and 5 very low risk- the following 
technologies in terms of risk to human health. Irradiation is perceived as the most risky technologies for 
around 80% of Spanish respondents, artificial colours, flavours and preservatives follow in the rank.  
 

4.2. Measurement Model or scales validation analysis 

 

As mentioned in Section 3, first a Confirmatory factor analysis for all constructs was performed, that is: 
1) Sensory considerations for food purchasing; 2) attitude towards organic production standards; 3) 
perceived risks of food production technologies; 4) perceived risks of GM food; 5) risk aversion;  and 6) 
consumer intentions towards GM food, assuming all errors to be uncorrelated. The confirmatory factor 
analysis with all indicators resulted suitable and the correlation matrix among all variables is presented in 
Table 4. In addition, all constructs but one was measured by three indicators as proposed by Kline (2005) 
among others.  

[Insert Table 4 about here] 

 

The main parameters to test for the robustness of the constructs, following Hair et al. (1999); and 
Kline (2005) appear to show acceptable results as shown in Tables 5. Analysis of test statistics showed 
that constructs exhibited good reliability of estimation.    In fact, reliability of factor loadings are high for 
all constructs (above 0.5) and t-values associated with the loadings are all significant (P<0.001), implying 
a satisfactory convergent validity (Olsen, 2003; and Bagozzi et al. 2001). Regarding internal consistency 
of the model, we can state that is robust, including composite reliability (which must be > 0.7), internal 
consistency reliability, measured by Cronbach’s α, (which must be about 0.7), extracted validity (which 
must be >0.5) and discriminant validity (correlations among constructs < 0.85) (Hair et al.1999; and 
Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). Moreover, for every construct, all composite reliabilities are greater than 0.7 and 
all Cronbach’s α are over 0.7 but for construct C3 (perceived risk of GM food) which is 0.5, thus we can 
say that reliability is acceptable. Regarding the variance extracted, it is 0.50 or higher for all cases (Table 

                                                           
4 The reliability of responses using Crombach alpha coefficient is of 0.63, which indicates an acceptable 
reliability level.

5).  Finally, since the correlations among latent factors do not exceed 0.85, in any case, it can be stated 
that discriminant validity has been accomplished too.

The model meets the widely accepted goodness of fit standards indicating that the conceptual 
model satisfactory fits the data (see Table 5). However, it must be pointed out that the chi-square statistic 

was significant and the Normed chi-square (NC) NC = 4.3
2

=
df

χ
 is about 3, demonstrating a good 

model fit (Carmines and McIver, 1981; and Bollen, 1989). The Root Mean Square Error of 
Approximation (REMSEA) is 0.08, which is well inside the 0.05-0.08 limit interval offered by Hair et al. 
(1999) and Kline (2005). The goodness-of-fit index (GFI) was 0.98, the Comparative-Fit Index (CFI) 
0.98, the Normed-Fit Index (NFI) 0.97 and the Non-Normed Index (NNI) 0.97, all were greater than 0.90 
as offered by Marcoulides and Schumacker (1996); and Chen and Li (2007).  
 

 

4.3 Structural Model 

Following the results of the measurement model, the proposed theoretical causal relationships 
have been analysed using Lisrel 8.51 statistical program. We find a satisfactory fit for the model as Table 
6 shows. Moreover, Figure 4 reveals the paths coefficients obtained for the structural model. It must be 
highlighted that all causal relations (Hypothesis) were supported with paths significant at  001.0=p   
level.  
 

First of all, we found that an important negative relationship between “Perceived Risks of GMF” 
and “Consumer Intentions towards GMF” exists (H5), with a correlation coefficient of almost -0.70. This 
result is consistent with all previous literature and verifies the importance of negative information on 
behavioural intentions, as already stated by some studies such as Yeung and Morris (2006) and Rousu et 
al. (2004) among others. Nevertheless, and as stated in the theoretical framework, the role of “Risk 
Aversion” has also been shown to be a significant factor in determining if consumers are willing to accept 
the consumption of GM food (H6). In fact, a negative relationship between “Risk Aversion” and 
“Consumer Intentions towards GMF” with a path of 0.13, has been obtained from the structural model.  

 
[Insert Table 6 and Figure 4 about here] 

 

 
Hypotheses 2 and 3 are also supported with relevant correlation coefficients: 0.43 and 0.28. 

Consequently, we can tentatively conclude that Spanish respondents risk perception towards food 
technology as general science is very important for the perception of a single food technology application. 
As stated in section 2, more general attitudes are considered by respondents when evaluating new and 
unfamiliar GM foods, Chen and Li (2007). That is, perceived risks associated with GM foods rely on the 
perceived risks associated with general food technology. Indeed, this relating is tested either by a direct 
causal relation (H3) or by means of an indirect path (H2+H4). This conclusion supports the empirical 
evidences explained by Krishna and Qaim (2008) and Roe and Teisl (2004) who stated that consumers 
with low levels of concern for an “uncertain-risk” food technology will present a similar level of concern 
for other “uncertain-risk” food technologies.  

 
It has been stated that consumers relate OF with healthy food  and also that individuals consider 

OF as a way of avoiding risks related to food technology (Devcich et al., 2007). Our results support these 
statements since respondents that perceive more risks associated to food production technologies reveals a 
positive attitude towards organic production standards (H2). Moreover, the negative relation among GMF 
and organic food perceptions reported by many studies such as Dreezens et al. (2005); Saher et al. (2006); 
and Burton et al. (2001) is also supported in the case of Spain (H4). That is, a significantly positive 
relation between attitude towards organic production standards and risk perception associated to GM food 
has been observed with an associated path of 0.28.  

 



11 

Finally, this study also confirmed the existence of a positive relation between, “natural” factors 
affecting behaviour (such as flavour freshness or appearance) with a positive attitude towards organic 
production standards (H1).    

 

5. Discussion 
 

The combined and net effect of risks attitudes and perceptions in determining consumer acceptance of 
GM food has been the motivation of this paper. We examined these effects by using structural equation 
modelling to determine the decision making process that leads to consumer acceptance of GM food using 
survey evidence from a sample of Spanish consumers.  In doing so, we propose a model that accounts 
from a set of constructs that altogether leads to a final acceptance, theoretically underpinning consumer 
decision making. Our contribution relies on exploring the independent influence of two main variables, 
the effect of risk attitudes and the effect of risk perceptions at portraying information on other relevant 
consumption processes  

 

Our results suggest clearly independent effects of both risks attitudes and risks perception in determining 
consumer acceptance. This result is consistent with some findings from previous studies outside the food 
sector (Weber and Hsee , 1998). Hence, besides a relatively lower risks aversion level, individuals who 
reveal acceptance of GM food tend to perceive fewer risks. However, the net effect of risks perceptions is 
overall higher possibly due to the cumulative influence present when risk attitudes are not controlled for, 
as well as the other constructs including age, gender and other relevant variable as hypothesised in out 
structural model. Therefore, aspects that influence risk perceptions might not impact risks attitudes, and 
instead are affected by more structural personality treats.  On the other hand, the fact that risk attitudes are 
significant indicates that neo-phobic type would tend to include people with higher risk aversion besides 
perceiving risks where other does not.  

 

In addition, the roles of wide attitudes towards food are important in the formation of consumers’ 
perceptions and attitudes towards GM food have also been empirically tested. That is, we find that as 
expected, in order to be able to value a particular scientific application, individuals rely on their general 
attitudes towards an object of study, which suggests that individuals are likely to follow some shortcuts 
based on values and attitudes in forming their behaviour when they have limited information to come up 
with solely a reasoned risk benefit decision. This result is very important and consistent with the fact that 
about 85% of the Spanish sample reveal to have low levels or are not able to value their knowledge about 
GM food.  Finally, food applications associated with opposite values are contrarily valued by consumers. 
This is the case of GM and organic food production.    

 

Some important caveats of the study should be mentioned. First of all, although the model analyzes a key 
element of the TPB, the introduction of the variables and attitudes towards the behaviour and subjective 
norm improve the model. Moreover, the impossibility of achieving a larger sample did not lead us to 
perform some form of multi-group analysis which might identify heterogeneity regarding age groups, 
gender or income levels among other variables might still exist.   However, this paper shows that the 
process of decision making regarding new foods produced with genetic modification is the result of 
complex behavioural mechanisms.
