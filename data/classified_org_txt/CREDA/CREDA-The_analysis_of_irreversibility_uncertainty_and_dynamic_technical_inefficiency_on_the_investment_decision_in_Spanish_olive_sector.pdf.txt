The analysis of irreversibility, uncertainty and dynamic technical inefficiency on 

the investment decision in Spanish olive sector 

1. Introduction 
 
Spain occupies a first ranking position in worldwide production and exportation for 

olive oil and table olives. Such position is enforced by the positive evolution of investment 

demonstrated by an increase of approximately 5% of area dedicated to this cultivation 

during the last 6 years (Spanish Ministry for Agriculturea, 2008). 

As other types of investment, the olive sector investment is characterized by 

irreversibility and uncertainty (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). The irreversibility is due to the 

presence of a sunk cost. The uncertainty is reflected through factors that affect future 

outcome and therefore, farmer’s investment decision. Moreover, uncertainty can emerge 

from many sources as: market conditions, regulatory initiatives and constraints, farmer’s 

knowledge and information access. Thus, farmers take time before deciding to invest until 

they dispose of new information and diminish their uncertainty. Farmers who search 

information have more managerial experience which is associated to high technical 

efficiency level (Wilson et al., 2001). 

This study analyzes Spanish olive sector investment decision under irreversibility and 

uncertainty taking into consideration the technical efficiency as a relevant element that 

could impact that decision by integrating the Real Option Approach (ROA) and a dynamic 

Stochastic Frontier Model (SFM) estimation. The ROA allows us to analyse the decision 

to invest under uncertainty and irreversibility. There is an extensive literature applying this 

approach to agricultural sector applications (e.g., Purvis et al., 1995; Stokes et al., 2009) 

with Price and Wetzstein (1999) addressing orchard management specifically. However, 

up to date no previous published papers have focused on the analysis of investment 

decision under uncertainty and irreversibility in Spanish olive sector. Moreover, the 



 2

novelty of our approach is assessing the impact of managerial skills (the farmer’s 

knowledge, information access…etc) on investment, such skills are associated to farms 

technical efficiency (Wilson et al., 2001 and Battese and Broca, 1997). The key question 

of our analysis is the evaluation of the relationship between the investment under 

uncertainty and irreversibility and the persistence of technical inefficiency. 

A dynamic SFM is developed to estimate the long run technical efficiency and it 

persistence. In a posterior step, the rate of technical efficiency and it persistence are used 

to evaluate their impact on investment decision using ROA.  

 

2. Literature review 
 

This section contains a brief literature review for both approaches the dynamic SFM, 

ROA, and a brief discussion of different orchard replacement models used in the literature.  

 
2.1 The dynamic stochastic frontier model 
 

Few stochastic frontier production studies account for dynamics in panel data models 

of technical inefficiency (e.g. Cornwell et al., 1990; Kumbhakar, 1990; Battese and Coelli, 

1992; and Ahn and Schmidt, 1995). Other studies, such as Ahn et al., (2000), allow firm 

specific technical inefficiency levels to follow an autoregressive process of order one 

(AR(1)). This approach does not require the imposition of the arbitrary restrictions on the 

short-run dynamic efficiency levels, but it is criticized by the absence of a theoretical 

justification. The limited number of studies focusing on this aspect about dynamic models 

efficiency (e.g. Ahn et al., 2002; Huang, 2004 and Tsionas, 2006) are characterized by a 

complex likelihood function specification as well as the difficulties of assuming the 

inference on unobserved firm-specific inefficiencies (Tsionas, 2006). 

Tsionas (2006) proposes that the inefficiency factors need to be adjusted by time 

which depends on adjustment costs.

2.2 The real options approach 
 

The dynamic version of discounted cash flow analysis and, in particular Net Present 

Value (NPV) offers significant advantages over static discounted cash flow analysis such 

as the incorporation of future uncertainty and offers the flexibility of the adjusting 

managers’ decisions in the future.  

Myers (1977) indicates that the use of traditional discounted cash flow approach 

ignores the value of options arising in uncertain and risky investment projects by viewing 

of discretionary investment opportunities as “growth options”. Dean (1951); Hayes and 

Garvin (1982) recognized that standard discounted cash flow undervalued investment 

opportunities as financial analysts ignored important strategic considerations.  

In 1994, Dixit and Pindyck introduced the irreversibility model1 and were the first to 

point out the interactions between the irreversibility nature of investments in an uncertain 

future and the timing of those investments.  

 

2.3 The Orchard investment analysis 
 

The most of research in orchard investment developed by economists have used the 

mathematical programming approach to analyse the decision of investment (Hester and 

Cacho, 2003). Early examples include Graham et al., (1977) and Willis and Hanlon 

(1976), both of whom used the mathematical programming methodology. Childs et al., 

(1983) used the dynamic programming to maximise profit under the replacement policy 

applied to apple orchards. While, Cahn et al., (1997) used the simulation methodology to 

explore NPV under the planting density restriction. However, few models have used the 

econometric approach on orchard investment with emphasis on uncertainty, adjustment 

costs and informational imperfections (e.g. Bernstein and Nadiri, 1986).

The ROA to analysing orchard investment is undertaken by Price and Wetzstein 

(1999), which consider uncertainty on yield and price to analyse irreversible investment 

decisions in peach orchards.  

 
3. Methodology  

 
3.1 Dynamic stochastic frontier model 
 

Following Tsionas (2006), the stochastic frontier production function with panel data 

can be expressed as follows: 

 
1, . . . . , , 1, . . . . ,i t i t i t i ty x v u i n t T      (1) 

 
where itx and   are a 1k   vector of regressors and parameters respectively. 

itv  is a two-sided random errors that are assumed to be iid 
20 vIN( , ) , 

1,..., , 1,...,i n t T  , and itu  is a vector of independently distributed and nonnegative 

random disturbances that represent technical inefficiency. 

We assume that technical efficiency follows an autoregressive process: 

 

, 1log log ,it it i t itu z u      for 2 , . . . ,t T    (2) 

1 1 1log /(1 ) ,i i iu z       for 1t   for all 1 , . . . , .i n   (3) 

 
where 2~ (0, ),it IN   for 2,...,t T  is a random variable capturing the “unexpected log-

efficiency sources” and 2 21~ (0, /(1 )),i IN    for all 1,...,i n . The “systematic part” 

, 1logit i tz u    reflects “expected” log-inefficiency sources. itz  and   are an 1m  vector 

of covariates and parameters, respectively. We assume that itv , itu , itx and itz  are 

independent.  

The estimation of the model in (2) and (3) applies the Bayesian inference approach to 

characterize the likelihood function. Even still involves a high dimensional which 

precludes a closed form solution to the likelihood function and thus, requires a numerical 



 5

solution approach. Gibbs sampling2 method with data augmentation has been used in order 

to make Monte Carlo draws from the joint posterior distribution of the model and to 

perform the computations (Gelfand and Smith, 1990). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo 

(MCMC) scheme is used to provide conditional distribution to measure technical 

efficiency for each farm (Koop and Steel, 2001). 

 

3.2 Real option methodology 

 

Following Dixit and Pindyck (1994), we assume that the project value V  follows a 

geometric Brownian motion with drift  and diffusion . 

 
dV Vdt Vds         (4) 

 

where ds is the increment of a Wiener process with   0E ds   and   2E ds dt .  

We define the value of the option to invest or the investment opportunities ( )F V  

and the objective is to find the rule that maximizes this value using a dynamic 

programming (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994):  

 

 A V if V HV K if V HV         (5) 
 

1
H K



 

 is the optimal investment trigger or threshold value of the project that 

would cause immediate investment, which accounts for both irreversibility and 

uncertainty. V represents the value of the decision; either the decision is to invest now or 

to wait to invest. If the value of the investment opportunity is less than the trigger value, 

the value AV  consists in both NPV and option value. In the other case (if V>H), the 

                                                 
2 Gibbs sampling is an iterative approach that permit making draws from a joint distribution by doing an 
iterated sequential draws from the conditional distributions.

strategic value of the investment is given by NPV (V-K), there is no value in waiting to 

invest. 

 
4. Empirical application 
 

In this section, the investment of Spanish olive sector is analyzed followed by the 

empirical application of SFM and RO.  

 
4.1 Characteristic of investment in Spanish olive sector  
 

The analysis of the investment focuses on three indicators: the Gross Real 

Investment (GRI), the Investment Rate (IR) and the Investment Spikes (IS). We used a 

balanced panel data of 158 olive farms from the Farm Accountancy Data Network 

(FADN), available over the periods 1999-2004. 

Figure 1 shows the evolution of this different type of GRI by year. As we can see 

there is a clear increasing tendency of total investment (more than 60%), until having a 

peak in 2003. Such positive evolution is explained mainly by the increase in “machinery 

and equipment” investment associated to the increase in “plant” investment.

The distribution of IR shows that zero investments account for about 71% of the total 

observation, positive investment account for 7% and negative for 22%. The majority of 



 7

positive IR observations (77.2%) has an IR superior to 90%. The IR interval [0-5%], and 

[80-90%] each comprise 5.1% of total observations. While, the IR intervals [10-20%], 

[50-60%], and [70-80%] each account for 2.5% of total observations. The IR interval [40-

50%] accounts for 4% of the total of observations. At the last ranking, we find IR interval 

[30-40%] which represents 1% of total observations. The IS fluctuate from 16.2 % in 1994 

to 1% in 2004, with a peak in 2001 (39.1%). The 93% of farms with positive IR have an 

IS superior to 20%.  

 
4.2 Estimation of dynamic stochastic model  

 
The dynamic SFM is specified as Cobb-Douglas (C-D)3 :

where k, j = 1,…,K indicate the inputs used in the production process.  

Production ity  is defined as total olive sales in currency units divided by the olive 

price indice. Vector kitx  is composed of five inputs and a time trend (t). Input variables are 

labor hours ( Lx ), expenditure on fertilizers ( Fx ), pesticides ( Px ), and other inputs such as 

plants costs and farming overhead ( Ix ). The total area occupied by olive groves defines 

the land variable LNDx .  

Vector iz , in the technical inefficiency effects function, is a (1x3) vector that 

specifies the variables age and farm size.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                 
3 The Translog functional form results were not robust, with many coefficients being much less than twice 
their respective standard errors (the distributional assumptions make it difficult to have conclusive claims 
about the distribution of the Lagrange multiplier statistic).

4.3. The construction of olive grove investment project (ROA) 
 

Following Purvis et al., (1995), the variability of investment return can be 

approximated using the variance of 1ln ln( ) ln( )n n nV V V    , where nV is the value of the 

equivalent opportunity to invest in perpetuity:

where n: time period, and nPV the present value of the project. 

The value nV supposes that the investment can be reinitiated at the end of its usual 

life at the same sunk cost K. 4 The numerator of equation (7) provides the annuity 

equivalent to the present value of investment. 

Besides FADN data set, additional data have been used from the Spanish Ministry 

of Agriculture, Statistical National Institute (SNI, 2008), and published studies (Barranco 

et al., 2006; Spanish Ministry for Agricultureb, 2008).  

After the simulation of nV  using a Monte Carlo simulation, the optimal investment 

trigger value H  is calculated. The technical inefficiency have been included in the 

production variable using equation (2) and (3) of the dynamic SFM.  

 

5. Results and discussion 
 

The results derived from the estimation of the C-D dynamic SFM are presented in 

Table 1. First-order parameters kβ  of labor, fertilizer, and other inputs are all positive and 

                                                 
4 Because of the alternant of olive grove production, and in order to decrease it volatility,the time period is 
defined by two years long (the good plus the bad production year)

statistically significant, indicating that the production is increasing in such inputs. 

Pesticide is negative but statistically weak and not significant. 

Land is negative and statistically significant, which is not an unusual result in such 

cases, given that is a fixed input and cannot be adjusted in orchard crops. The time trend is 

negative but statistically not significant, which suggests that the technology embodied in 

the trees is unchanged. Therefore, any growth taking place over time is from the installed 

trees and is not able to be added over time, which essentially means that there is no 

additional technical change effect. 

The estimation results of the gamma component reveals that only the constant and 

size variable included in Gamma 1 component are significant implying that technical 

inefficiency increases at a decreasing rate for larger farms. The posterior mean for the 

autoregressive component is 0.294 which is fairly small and far from unity which suggests 

means that a small quantity of technical inefficiency is transmitted to the next time period 

and, thus, there is not as much friction of inefficiency over time.  

The comparison of our results with previous studies shows a similarity with Ahn et 

al., (2002) study, that had a persistence component equal to 0.18. While the comparison 

with Tsionas (2006), that had a persistence component close to 1, indicate that the 

technical inefficiency of Spanish olive farms are minimally persistent, which suggests a 

lower cost of adjustment as well as less competition in this sector. 

Table 2 shows farm specific efficiency frequency and posterior statistics for 

technical efficiency for two models; the first one represents the static C-D production, 

while the second one is the C-D dynamic frontier used in this study.   

The distribution of estimated technical efficiency scores by farm for the short run 

shows a fluctuation between a minimum of 65.6% and a maximum of 83.7%. This short 

term efficiency takes an average value of 78.1% throughout the period studied, implying 



 10

that output could have increased substantially if technical inefficiency were eliminated. 

The majority of farmers have efficiency scores in the range 70-80% (82% of the sample), 

followed by the range 80-90% (16% of the sample).  

Referring to long- run predicted technical efficiency, the measure ranges from 

39.4% to 76.5%, and with an average value of 72.7% through the period studied. The vast 

majority of olive farms in the sample have a dynamic efficiency scores in the range 70-

80%, which represents 81.7% of the total sample. The difference between static and 

dynamic technical inefficiency are not very important, as we can see that the static 

inefficiency is 0.06 percentage units upper compared to the dynamic frontier model. This 

result is consistent with the low persistence inefficiency, which shows that the most of 

farms are reasonably keeping efficiency at the same level from short to long term.  

Table 3 presents the NPV, option value and trigger value found by varying the 

percentage of discounted rate. The results indicate that a decrease of discount rate leads to 

an increase on option value and a decision to invest. Thus, at higher discount rate (8%) the 

decision is wait to invest.  

Uncertainty in price combined with discounted rate play an important role on the 

decision to invest in Spanish olive sector. Table 4 shows the simulation results by varying 

olive price and discounted rate. At a lower discount rate level (7%), an increase in price 

leads to the decision is to invest with no option value of waiting to invest.  

Moreover, the lower price increase combined with higher discount rate delays the 

investment decision in the olive sector. So, at higher discount rate (e.g., 8%) and lower 

price increase (5 % and 10%), the decision is to wait to invest with an important option 

value of waiting. Such a situation changes when the discount rate decreases, which means 

that the increase of price market level encourage farmers to take the decision to invest at 

farm level. 



 11

A table 5 presents the effect of dynamic technical inefficiency and its persistence in 

investment decision. A higher technical inefficiency rate leads to the decision is wait to 

invest with important option value for waiting, and vise-versa. This indicates that the 

technical inefficiency increases the option value of waiting to invest and therefore delays 

the investment decision, while being technically efficient leads to farmers being more 

decisive about the investment decision.  

Table 6 shows the results under an alternative technical inefficiency persistence 

increase. As the persistence of technical inefficiency increases the decision is wait to 

invest, and under small percentage of persistence of technical inefficiency the decision is 

to invest. An increase in the persistence parameter of technical inefficiency leads to higher 

costs of adjustment combined with strong competition. Thus, the farmers take the decision 

to wait to invest. However, at small persistence parameter of technical inefficiency, the 

decision is to invest. 

 

6. Conclusion  
 

The purpose of this paper is the evaluation of the investment decision under 

uncertainty and irreversibility allowing for long run inefficiency. This analysis has been 

applied to a 158 Spanish olive farms using FADN data set.  

The empirical results show that the technical inefficiency persistence parameter is 

fairly low to unity, which means that small technical inefficiency is transmitted to the next 

time period. The technical efficiency average is 72.7% and the static inefficiency is 0.06 

percentage points greater compared to the dynamic technical efficiency. 

The olive groves investment is irreversible and characterized by uncertainty on 

price and discount rate that play an important role on the decision to invest in Spanish 

olive sector. An increase of discount rate means that the farmers take the decision to 



 12

postpone investment. An increase on price along with a decrease of discount rate leads to 

the decision to invest with no option value of waiting to invest. 

The results also suggest that the decision of investment in Spanish olive sector does 

not depend alone on discount rate and olive price, but also on technical inefficiency and its 

persistence impact. The increase of farms inefficiency means that the decision is to wait to 

invest. Consequently, at higher inefficiency persistence the decision to invest. 

The recent CAP reform policy implemented after 2006, and modified in 2007 can 

have a possible positive impact about olive investment. Such policy is decoupled by 93% 

and combined with the price support which can stabilize farm income and diminish the 

uncertainty related to price. This policy can allow the farm operator to have a more secure 

environment to future investment, which is guaranteed by the high technical efficiency 

scores of Spanish olive farms associated to low persistent inefficiency through time.
