Abstract 7 

In this paper, we analyse the opinions, attitudes and willingness of consumers to pay for 8 

biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in Barcelona province. Data were gathered from face-to-9 

face structured questionnaires from 300 diesel car owners/users that regularly purchase fuel. 10 

A variation of the traditional choice experiments (CE) was used by excluding the price 11 

attribute from the design. In a subsequent contingent valuation (CV) exercise, respondents 12 

were asked to state their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for their preferred choice sets 13 

using the ―payment card‖ format. The relative importance of the attributes and levels were 14 

calculated by estimating a random parameter logit model. The results demonstrated, contrary 15 

to the literature in Spain, that consumers were not willing to pay for biodiesel, especially 16 

when its production may negatively affect food prices. The main limitation was that car 17 

manufacturers do not recommend its use as it may lead to engine failure. The public 18 

authorities are asked to work jointly with the automotive industry to address this drawback. 19

1. Introduction 24 

Renewable energy sources are becoming an increasingly important issue in the 25 

political agenda of countries all over the world. They are considered a primary driver of 26 

economic progress, enabling countries to reduce energy dependency, achieve goals of 27 

sustainability and enhance competitiveness [1]. In the last decades, the global debate on the 28 

environment and climate change was primarily focused on the reduction of the emission of 29 

CO2, which is considered a major source of the greenhouse gas effect [2]. As a 30 

consequence, many countries adopted policies and strategies to diversify their energy 31 

sources in many sectors, transport being the most important one. According to Eurostat 32 

(Table 1), in 2011, the production of the total renewable energy
1
 in the EU 27 has increased 33 

significantly, reaching 208,006 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE). Germany leads the 34 

list of the EU countries, followed by France, Spain and Italy. 35

The European transport sector, including the Spanish sector, faces two major 40 

challenges. First, it depends greatly on imported energy sources, especially fuel oil, which is 41 

one of the fossil fuels that contributes to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases 42 

[3]. This sector accounted for more than 20% of the total EU emissions in 2010 [4]. This 43 

situation limits the possibility of meeting the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol and increases 44 

the energy dependence of the EU [5]. According to the data from Eurostat, the EU is energy 45 

deficient, with energy dependency of 53% in 2010. Second, price volatility, the continuous 46 

increase in the prices of fossil fuels, and uncertainties regarding its availability generate 47 

concerns for its long term sustainability. 48 

In this context, the Spanish transport sector experienced a significant increase in road 49 

infrastructure of approximately 16,000 km in early 2012, behind only the US and China in 50 

absolute terms [6], and its greenhouse emissions have increased by 66% since 1990. It is 51 

the largest user of final energy, accounting for 40% of the total final consumption [7].Thus, 52

 Following the Eurostat methodology, by total renewable energy we refer to the following: solar energy, solar 

thermal, biomass and renewable wastes, wood and wood wastes, hydro power, wind power, solar photovoltaic 
and the tide, waves and ocean.

reducing its emissions is crucial to reducing overall emission. As indicated by [8], the low 53 

taxation of car fuels in Spain, which is 20% below the European averages for 2010, the shift 54 

of car fleets to diesel [9] due to its low relative price and the consequent increase of 55 

problems related to local greenhouse gases in Madrid and Barcelona [10] and [6] make this 56 

sector a relevant case study.  57 

Biofuels as a renewable energy source have been viewed for decades as a worthwhile 58 

alternative to address these challenges. However, the shift toward this source remains weak 59 

[11]. Their total production in the EU27 increased from 7 TOE in 1991 (mainly produced by 60 

Austria) to 11,455 TOE. In 2011, Germany was the major European producer of biofuel, 61 

followed by France, Italy and Spain (Table 1). Biodiesel represents the major share of biofuel 62 

production, reaching 71% (8,112 TOE) of the total EU 27 production. The EU is the world‘s 63 

largest biodiesel producer, representing, on a volume basis, approximately 70% of the total 64 

biofuels market share in the transport sector [12]. The largest producer of biodiesel is 65 

Germany followed by France, Spain and Italy (Table1). 66 

In the last decade, the production of biofuels, in particular first-generation biofuels, has 67 

generated a debate about the impact of production on food prices. The debate regarding the 68 

negative effect of biofuels on food security around the world is not quite new. Within this 69 

context, there are two clearly differentiated opinions on if and to what extent biofuel 70 

production affects feedstock prices. On the one hand, certain studies have stated that 71 

biofuels are not responsible for the price increase and volatility of feedstock. [13] concluded 72 

that the increases in biofuel production have a non-significant impact on feedstock prices in 73 

the case of corn, wheat, barley, sugarcane, rapeseed, soybean and sunflower. [14] and [15] 74 

stated that rising feedstock prices are primarily related to other factors, such as oil price 75 

developments, financial speculation and the recent strong economic growth of China. 76 

However, on the other hand, several studies ([16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and [21]) noted that 77 

the food price increases have been mainly the result of the expansion of biofuels. [22] 78 

mentioned that the biofuel market expansion had led farmers to produce crops for the 79 

biofuels sector, driven by several subsidy programs, at the expense of the local and 80 

international food markets. He concluded that the most important factor in the growth of food 81 

prices is the large increase in biofuel production in the U.S. and the EU. 82 

In considering the empirical analysis of the relation between biofuel production and 83 

feedstock prices, we can analyse two approaches: the first focuses on the supply side of 84 

biodiesel. This approach analyses the advantages and shortcomings of the production and 85 

its relation to agricultural feedstock and food prices. The second relies on the analysis of the 86 

demand side and focuses on the social attitudes and opinions toward biodiesel and the 87 

public opinion on its relation to the increase in food prices. The combination of both 88 



4 
 

approaches is necessary to determine the optimal provision of biofuels from a social point of 89 

view. In theory, once the optimum is located, the policy authorities will be in a position to 90 

design the appropriate instruments to correct the market failures. 91 

In recent years, certain studies have addressed the first approach, especially after the 92 

2008 food price crisis, focusing their analysis on price volatility and the relationship between 93 

biodiesel production and food prices [23]. However, there is a scarcity of studies that have 94 

focused on the perceptions of society regarding biodiesel production and the opinions and 95 

acceptances of the role they play in rising food prices, in particular in Spain. In this context, 96 

the main objective of this paper is to analyse consumer opinion and attitudes toward 97 

biodiesel as an alternative fuel in Barcelona Province (Spain) and their willingness to pay for 98 

it. The importance of using this region as a case study is the high degree of dependence on 99 

imported energy sources, the high energy consumption per unit of GDP and the 100 

environmental problems caused mainly by the increased GHG emissions from the transport 101 

sector [6]. 102 

 103 

2. Literature review 104 

Biofuels are derived from biomass
2
, which mainly includes ethanol and biodiesel [24]. 105 

There are four known generations of biofuels. The first generation is directly related to a 106 

biomass that is generally edible [11] and produced directly from food crops. The most 107 

common for ethanol production are corn, sugar beets and sugar cane, while for biodiesel 108 

production palm oil, rapeseed and soybean are the main crops. The second generation is 109 

produced from non-food crops, such as wood, organic waste (municipal solid wastes) and 110 

other food crop waste. The third generation focuses on improvements in the production 111 

process of biomass, introducing algae as a principal energy source [25]. The introduction of 112 

algae is due to its potential to produce more energy per acre than conventional crops. The 113 

fourth generation is similar to the second and third generations with the difference that during 114 

the production process, the carbon emission is captured and stored, locking away more 115 

carbon than it produces. 116 

The biomass-based fuel may have advantages and disadvantages. From one 117 

perspective, biofuels might be manufactured from a wide range of materials, thus improving 118 

the recycling efficiency. They are easily renewable as new crops are grown and waste 119 

material is collected [26]. Moreover, because they are produced locally, they help reduce the 120 

foreign energy dependency and create new jobs in rural areas [27]. They also may provide 121

 As mentioned by the International Energy Agency, biomass is any organic, i.e. decomposing, matter derived 

from plants or animals available on a renewable basis. Biomass includes wood and agricultural crops, 

herbaceous and woody energy crops, and municipal organic wastes, as well as manure.

economic incentives for the agricultural sector if the demand for the energy crops increases 122 

[28]. Finally, less carbon output and toxins are produced when it is burned in comparison to 123 

the fossil fuels. However, biofuels may not be worth producing, especially those from the first 124 

generation [29]. Those that are based on raw agricultural material produce negative net 125 

energy gains because the carbon footprint (the machinery necessary to cultivate the crops 126 

and the plants to produce the fuel) is high. Food prices and shortages may also be affected. 127 

As the demand for raw agricultural material grows for biofuel production, it could also raise 128 

the prices for the necessary primary food crops [30]. Water demand for biofuel production is 129 

also high, both for the irrigation of the crops as well as for the production process of fuel [30]. 130 

Within this debate, the regulations for producing biofuels in recent years have 131 

undergone remarkable changes. In September 2013, a narrow majority of European 132 

Parliament voted that "first generation" biofuels should not exceed 6% of the final energy 133 

consumption in transport by 2020, while advanced biofuels should represent at least 2.5% of 134 

the energy consumption in transport. These changes affected the Directive 2009/28/EC on 135 

the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, which set up mandatory targets 136 

for its member states of a 20% share of renewable energy in the total energy consumption 137 

and a 10% share of energy from renewable sources (primary biofuels) in all forms of 138 

transport by 2020. Member states may introduce for themselves the measures that promote 139 

biofuel consumption to reach this goal. It is worth mentioning that Spain has set a renewable 140 

energy target in the transport sector that is 3.6 points above the 10% binding European 141 

objective for 2020 [5]. 142 

The renewable energy policy in Spain, with its emphasis on biofuels, progressed in line 143 

with other EU counties and presents a response to the main challenges that the Spanish 144 

energy sector has faced in the last decades. In the Spanish biofuel market, biodiesel plays a 145 

predominant role because the consumption of bioethanol is negligible compared to the USA, 146 

which is the case for all European countries [31]. This policy follows both the Renewable 147 

Energy Directive (RED) [27] and the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) [32]. The former involves 148 

the need to meet 10 per cent of the transport energy demand from renewable sources by 149 

2020; the latter, to reduce the emissions of the transport fuels by at least 6 per cent by 2020. 150 

In June 2007, Spain imposed mandatory biofuel blending for transport with Law 151 

12/2007. The FQD enabled fuel operators to market B7 and E10, which are blends with a 152 

volumetric biodiesel content of 7 per cent and an ethanol content of 10 per cent, respectively. 153 

It is worth mentioning that in 2011, biodiesel production in Spain has decreased from 841 154 

TOE in 2010 to 679 TOE as a result of the worldwide economic crisis. Biofuels in Spain are 155 

supported due to their joint production with other public goods. The biofuel industry in 2011 156 



6 
 

was supported with €237 million for ethanol and €1,002 million for biodiesel [26]. Biodiesel 157 

consumption was supported with €0.31 per litre and €0.40 per litre for ethanol.  158 

Without presenting an extensive review, fewer studies have focused on the public 159 

preferences and the willingness to pay for biodiesel, in particular in Spain. In the US, [33] 160 

analysed the preferences of ethanol (E-10 and E-85); [34] also analysed different policies to 161 

promote biofuel, and [35] analysed the WTP for biomass ethanol. [36] Analysed factors 162 

affecting adoption of biodiesel in China. [37] assessed the determinants factors of the 163 

renewable energy choice and [38] studied car users and their WTP for biofuels in Greece. 164 

[39] and [40] estimated the WTP for the reduction of air pollution, which is brought about by 165 

using biodiesel in the US. In Spain, [41] and [6] focused on the willingness to pay for 166 

biodiesel. These studies were conducted in Spain, and their results indicated that although 167 

consumers have low levels of knowledge about biodiesel, there is a positive perception of 168 

biodiesel due to its environmental impacts, which consequently demonstrated that 169 

consumers are willing to pay more for biodiesel than for conventional diesel and are ready to 170 

use it. 171 

In this context, our paper attempts to verify these hypotheses especially after the 172 

worldwide economic crisis. This study aims to fill the gap in the existing literature by 173 

attempting to elicit consumer preferences for biofuels by investigating the WTP for biodiesel 174 

in Catalonia (Spain), taking into consideration the current discussions surrounding the 175 

development of alternative fuels for transport. 176 

3. Material and methods 177 

3.1. Data sample and collection 178 

The data used in this analysis were obtained from 300 face-to-face questionnaires with 179 

the drivers/owners of diesel engine vehicles in the Barcelona Province (the city of Barcelona 180 

and the suburbs). The population represents consumers over 18 years of age who are car 181 

users/owners and thus regularly purchase diesel fuel (Table 2). We follow a quota sampling 182 

procedure stratified by age and gender, and the participants are selected randomly. This 183 

distribution, however, does not have to be in proportion to the population of Barcelona 184 

Province, as we restrict the sample to consumers who own/drive a diesel vehicle. As we are 185 

not able to access the total number of diesel vehicles registered in Barcelona Province and 186 

the distribution of their drivers by gender and age, we use a proxy variable. The citizens with 187 

a driver‘s licence in the province of Barcelona stratified by age and gender have been used. 188 

Nevertheless, this set does not reflect the citizens who drive diesel vehicles in each strata; 189 

thus, we correct the strata percentage using the primary information obtained from face-to-190 



7 
 

face interviews with several authorised car dealers and garages. The final description of the 191 

sample is discussed in the results section. 192

A structured questionnaire has been designed to analyse consumer preferences and 197 

attitudes towards biodiesel as well as their maximum willingness to pay for it. The 198 

questionnaire was divided into several parts: 199 

 In the first part, consumer awareness and knowledge of biodiesel is measured 200 

(familiarity with biodiesel, the raw materials to produce biodiesel and the present 201 

percentage of biodiesel mixture in the market). 202 

 In the second part, consumers were asked about the use of diesel and biodiesel as a 203 

fuel in their cars, the frequency of use, their car‘s fuel efficiency (l/km), the purchase, 204 

the consumption and the year of registration. 205 

 In the third part, respondents were asked to indicate their opinion towards the relation 206 

between food and biodiesel and its environmental impact. They were also asked about 207 

the alternatives that they would choose if fuel prices continue to rise. The questions 208 

were formulated on an 11-point scale ranging from ―0 to10‖, the most understood scale 209 

in Spain. 210 

 The fourth part is focused on analysing the most important factors that consumers take 211 

into consideration when deciding to refuel their car and their willingness to pay for 212 

biodiesel, using an approach that applies the joint use of the choice experiment and the 213 

contingent valuation 214 

 The final part contains questions on the socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., 215 

gender, family size and composition, age, education level, and income) and other 216 

psychographic variables. 217 

 218 

3.2. The experimental design 219 



8 
 

In analysing ―complex goods‖ the choice experiment (CE) is one of the most relevant 220 

methods. It involves the characterisation of the product through a series of descriptors that 221 

can be combined following an orthogonal fractional factorial design to create different 222 

hypothetical scenarios of the product (alternatives). The respondents are faced with several 223 

of these scenarios (choice sets) and are asked to select their preferred alternative at different 224 

price levels while implicitly making a trade-off between attributes. However, in our approach, 225 

we exclude the monetary attribute from the design of the scenarios, and we subsequently 226 

ask respondents for their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) following a contingent valuation 227 

(CV) exercise. Within the CV, respondents were asked to state their maximum WTP using 228 

the ―payment card‖ format, as it combines both the advantages of the open-ended formats 229 

(the elicitation of the point information of the WTP) and of the close-ended formats (the ease 230 

of the cognitive burden on the interviewees) while minimising the risk of the ―starting-price 231 

bias‖ associated with the iterative bidding processes [42]. This procedure is related to the 232 

dual response choice experiment (DRCE) design proposed by [43], with the exception that 233 

the price in our case was set in a contingent valuation exercise. Asking consumers whether 234 

they are willing to purchase the product emphasises the purchasing context, which leads the 235 

respondents to focus more on their budget constraints and places more attention on the 236 

price. In contrast, in the traditional single-stage CE, the respondents can be driven by reason 237 

and logical arguments rather than by price considerations [44]. Figure 1 represents the 238 

experimental design used in our study. 239

Figure 1: Example of the choice set 241 

First, individuals are asked to choose their preferred scenario from three possible 242 

alternatives. Afterward, the respondents are faced with a ―pay/not to pay‖ decision response 243 

mode for the preferred scenario to set their maximum WTP. Introducing this follow-up 244 

question allows individuals to approach the information twice regarding their preferences, 245 

first by stating what they prefer and subsequently if they are willing to pay for it and if they 246 



9 
 

can afford it. Asking consumers about the maximum willingness to pay in a purchasing 247 

context may bring them to a greater emphasis on their budget constraints. 248 

Due to the hypothetical nature of the assessment of the willingness to pay, a standard 249 

cheap talk was used in the survey process as proposed by [45] and [46]: ―Previous studies 250 

indicate that individuals in general respond to surveys differently from the way they act in real 251 

life. It is quite common to find that individuals say they are willing to pay higher prices than 252 

those that they are really willing to pay. We believe that this is due to the difficulty in 253 

calculating the exact impact of these higher expenses on the household economy. It is easy 254 

to be generous when in reality one does not need to pay more‖. 255 

Applying the previous design to analyse the attributes that consumers take into 256 

consideration when he/she refuels and the relative importance of biodiesel, the first and most 257 

important step is to identify the attributes and their levels. After reviewing the market 258 

conditions in Barcelona Province and the abovementioned literature research on the relevant 259 

topic of consumer preferences toward biofuels, four attributes have been selected with their 260 

levels: 261 

1) Type of diesel. This attribute was straightforward because it is a main objective of the 262 

study. According to the available mixtures of biodiesel on the Spanish fuel market, we 263 

assess four levels of this attribute, one of them being the conventional diesel and the 264 

other three being the mixtures of 10% (B10), 20% (B20) and 30% (B30) biodiesel. 265 

2) Location of petrol stations. This attribute takes two levels to demonstrate whether the 266 

location of the petrol station affects the decision of the consumers to select the preferred 267 

station. We define the two levels as on the ―usual route‖ and ―outside the usual route‖` for 268 

the consumers. 269 

3) Type of the petrol station. For the more than 10,000 petrol stations in Spain, we assign 270 

two levels for this attribute. The first one is referred to as the ―local petrol stations‖, which 271 

represents the 33.85% that belong to local operators, cooperatives and supermarkets. 272 

The other belongs to the ―multinational operators‖, which represents 66.15% of the total. 273 

4) Price of the bread. Due to the potential relation between the feedstock price and biofuels 274 

production, we used the price of bread as a proxy variable to analyse this trade-off. [47] 275 

mentioned that an increase in the cost of raw materials in the US (vegetable oils) also 276 

leads to an increase in the commercial price of bread and breakfast cereals. [48] also 277 

noted that biofuel production in the U.S. increases the price of bread among other food 278 

products by approximately 10% to 30%. [49] stated that biofuel production in the US had 279 

an impact on planted acreage, crop prices, livestock production and retail food costs, 280 

leading to an increase in the price of bread and bakery items. Thus, the price of bread 281 

was used due to its daily consumption in our case study region and because consumers 282 



10 
 

are more familiar with its price. In addition, the bread price is also related to cereals as 283 

well as to vegetable oils prices. In Spain oil seeds are used to produce biodiesel, the 284 

direct effect of increased biodiesel production is likely to be felt on vegetable oil prices 285 

but also on cereals crops as both compete for the same agricultural land and thus its 286 

production is affected. This attribute will indicate the impact of the potential price increase 287 

of bread as a result of increasing biofuel production on consumer decisions to purchase 288 

biodiesel. We evaluate the following four levels of this attribute for bread prices: 289 

unchanged, might increase by 5%, 10% and 20%. 290 

 291 

Our sample was divided into two equal subsamples with 150 consumers each. Both 292 

subsamples share all of the survey questions but differ by the number of attributes included 293 

in the CE analysis. The choice sets were created using a fractional factorial orthogonal 294 

design. For the first sample, we include the first three attributes (type of diesel, location of 295 

petrol stations, type of petrol station), leading to eight choice sets that are presented for each 296 

participant. For the second subsample, we include the fourth attribute (bread price), obtaining 297 

16 choice sets. This differentiation was made to estimate how the changes in the price of 298 

bread can influence the purchasing decision for biodiesel and to compare how the 299 

preferences are affected by the presence of this attribute. To avoid the fatigue effects 300 

associated with the multiple-scenario valuation tasks, the 16 choice cards were divided into 301 

two blocks with eight choice sets each following the factorial blocking procedure. 302 

 303 

3.3. The econometric modelling 304 

The choice data obtained from the first question in our experimental design (Figure 1) 305 

were analysed using the traditional data treatment of the CE. Thus, following the Random 306 

Utility Theory [50], the subjects choose among scenarios according to a utility function with 307 

two components: a systematic (i.e., observable) component plus a random term (non-308 

observable by the researcher): 309 

( , )
in in i n in

U V X S          (1) 310 

Where 
in

U  is the utility provided by alternative i  to subject n , inV  is the systematic 311 

component of the utility, 
i

X  is the vector of attributes of alternative i , nS  is the vector of 312 

socio-economic characteristics of the respondent n , and in  is the random term. 313 

To predict the subjects‘ preferences for the attributes and their levels, it is necessary to 314 

define the ―probability of choice‖ that an individual n chooses the alternative i rather than the 315 

alternative j  (for any i  and j  within choice sets ( )C ), which is equivalent to the probability 316 



11 
 

that 
i

U  is greater than 
j

U . Several probabilistic models are available to analyse the choice-317 

stated data from the CE. The Conditional Logit Model (CL) is the basic model whereby the 318 

probability that an individual n will choose alternative i  ( inP ) among other alternatives ( 1j   319 

to J ) of a set ( )C  is formulated as follows [51]: 320

where   is a scale parameter that is inversely proportional to the standard deviation of 322 

the error terms. Within this model, the 
in

V must be defined. In our case, we follow a 323 

separable, additive and linear utility function as follows: 324

where ( )

  is a mean effect for each attribute level, ( )
k

X  is the value of attribute 326 

1...k K  in alternative i , ( )k  is the standard deviation, and in  is the error term. This 327 

utility specification leads to the random parameters logit model (RPL)
3
, which has been 328 

applied in the study because it accounts for the unobserved heterogeneity and allows 329 

obtaining the individual-specific parameter estimates. For more details about the CE 330 

technique and the RPL model, see among others [52] and [53]. 331 

 332 

3.4. The relative importance of biodiesel attributes and levels 333 

From the RPL model estimates in the traditional discrete choice experiment, the 334 

marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between attributes is usually calculated. Because one of 335 

the attributes is expressed in monetary terms, it is possible to determine the implicit price (IP) 336 

of the attributes. However, in this study, we use the marginal utilities estimates ( )
k

  attached 337 

to the levels of the attributes to calculate the global utility (i.e., the relative importance) of 338 

each attribute ( )
k

I  and their levels ( )
kl

I . Regarding the attributes, the ratio of the particular 339 

estimate to the sum of all the estimates of a specific attribute is used to reveal its relative 340 

importance as follows (Smith, 2005):  341 

                                                           
3
 We started by estimating a conditional logit model. However, the result of the Hausmann-MacFadden test demonstrates the 

violation of the IIA property. Thus, we specified the different types of model that relax the IIA, of which the RPL have 

demonstrated the best goodness of fit.

3.5. The joint use of the CE and CV: decomposing the WTP 353

. Decomposing the value of a ―complex good‖ into different values of their 356 

attributes and levels is not new. [54] decomposed the value of complex goods (agricultural 357 

multifunctionality and rabbit meat) using the CV and the relative importance of the attributes 358 

and levels obtained from the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). However, in their procedure 359 

they assumed positive utilities for the attribute levels, which is rather restrictive. Thus, to 360 

alleviate this drawback, in this paper we propose the use of the CE instead of the AHP to 361 

obtain the relative importance of the attribute and attribute levels. Following the basic model 362 

presented by [54], the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for the shift from ―do not choose‖ 363 

to ―choose‖ a preferred scenario can be decomposed into the maximum WTP of their 364 

descriptors (i.e., the attributes and attribute levels) using their relative importance (I). 365 

Thus, the WTP for the k-th attribute is given by: 366

4. Results and discussion 382 

4.1. Sample description 383 

The sample consisted of 300 diesel car owners/users over 18 years old who regularly 384 

purchase fuels. Most of the respondents were male (72, 33%), aged between 30 and 44 385 

years and living in three-member households. More than half of the participants had 386 

university-level studies and were employees with an average income between 1000 and 387 

2500€ per month. 388 

The consumers were asked to state how much money they spent on fuels per week 389 

and whether they paid for the fuels by themselves. The answers indicated that the majority of 390 

respondents paid by themselves, and 53% of respondents spent 1-25€ in fuels per week, 391 

while the average consumption is 32.06€ per week. The next questions referred to the year 392 

the respondents bought the car and their average fuel consumption per 100 km. Half of the 393 

respondents (51.5%) had cars registered after 2006, 37.1% registered their vehicles in the 394 

period between 2000 and 2005, while a small percentage of respondents (11.3%) had old 395 

cars registered before 1999. The average fuel consumption was 6.49 litres per 100 km. 396 

 397 

4.2. Attitudes and opinions toward biodiesel 398 



14 
 

The actual consumption of biodiesel among respondents was very low, with only 1% of 399 

respondents using biodiesel always, and 16% of them using it occasionally. The consumers 400 

who have never or almost never used biodiesel were asked to indicate their reasons for such 401 

behaviour. The main reason was ―not recommended by their vehicle manufacturer‖ (20.8%) 402 

followed by ―I had never thought in using it‖ (20.4%). The fact that biodiesel is not available in 403 

most of the petrol stations was also an important reason (18.4%). Although biodiesel is 404 

cheaper or approximately the same price to conventional fuel in the area of Barcelona, 12.4 405 

% of the respondents answered that they did not use it because it is more expensive. ―I do 406 

not trust its reliability‖ and ―I do not think that there is any difference from the conventional‖ 407 

comprise 9.2% and 0.8%, respectively. 408 

Nearly all of the respondents (91.7%) were familiar with the existence of biodiesel. 409 

Although the percentage was significantly high, when consumers were asked to indicate two 410 

crops that are used for its production, a significant percentage could not indicate any 411 

(48.7%). The others mostly stated that biodiesel is produced from corn (16.3%), sunflower oil 412 

(11.7%) or rapeseed (10.7%). In this context, the consumers were asked to indicate the 413 

percentage of the mixture between conventional diesel and biodiesel allowed in the market in 414 

Spain; 18.3% of the respondents answered the question correctly (10-30% of the mixture). 415 

However, the majority of the respondents (81.7%) wrongly answered, or they did not know. 416 

Participants were also asked to assess various statements related to certain 417 

characteristics of biodiesel. The evaluation was on a scale of 0 ―I strongly disagree‖ to 10 ―I 418 

strongly agree‖. The respondents agreed with the notion that biodiesel releases less 419 

pollutants than conventional diesel, with an average of 6.81. They also agreed that biodiesel 420 

will make the country less dependent on fossil fuels. However, the respondents did not agree 421 

that the number of kilometres travelled using biodiesel is greater than that of conventional 422 

diesel, with an average of 4.55.  423 

Finally, the environmental issues related to biodiesel and other renewable energy were 424 

analysed. Consumers were asked to rate from 0 to 10 the respect for the environment of the 425 

different energy sources. Solar energy and wind energy were evaluated as the most 426 

environmentally friendly energy sources, with an average of 8.43 and 8.2, respectively. 427 

Hydraulic energy was close, with an average 7.61. However, the respondents evaluated 428 

natural gas and biodiesel at a lower range, with 5.57 and 5.44, respectively. The low mean of 429 

biodiesel may indicate that consumers do not consider biodiesel as a clear alternative energy 430 

source, as it received a lower value than natural gas. The average level of respect for the 431 

fossil fuels was 4.2 for conventional diesel and 3.64 for gasoline. Finally, nuclear energy 432 

received a 3.14 and thus is considered to be the least satisfactory energy for the 433 

environment. 434 

 435 



15 
 

4.3. The CE results 436 

First, we started by checking for the IIA property. The results from the Hausman-437 

McFadden test for both subsamples indicated that the IIA property does not hold for the 438 

conditional logit model (
2
= 32.8752 with a p-value = .0000 for the first subsample and 439 


2
=67.8044 with a p-value =.0000 for subsample 2). Thus, the RPL model will better fit our 440 

data set. Table 3 presents the results of the RPL model for both samples. As can be 441 

observed, at the 99% confidence level, we can reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients 442 

are jointly equal to zero. We thus do not reject the overall significance of the model. The 443 

results exhibited an acceptable range of goodness of fit through McFadden‘s pseudo-R
2
 444 

value (0.256 and 0.226, respectively). It also exhibited a satisfactory value of the predicted 445 

percentage of the correct classification (78.5% and 76.9%, respectively). For the estimation 446 

of the random parameters, we assumed that the attribute coefficients were normally 447 

distributed, as they better fit our stated data. 448 

The positive or negative sign of the parameters indicates a positive or negative 449 

contribution to the utility function. Thus, in both samples, diesel car users primarily prefer to 450 

refuel in their habitual route and at the local petrol station. The results also indicate that in 451 

both cases the respondents demonstrate a rejection of biodiesel in all its proposed mixture. 452 

This non-acceptance of biodiesel is more accentuated when its production may increase the 453 

price of bread. The standard deviations of almost all random parameters are significant, 454 

confirming the suitability of the specification of this model to our data. 455

To better understand the relative importance of all levels of the attributes, it is important 460 

to calculate the utility of the base levels because they are not directly estimated from the 461 

model. The coefficients of the reference level of each attribute are obtained following the 462 

coding effect procedure. Thus, 
0

  is calculated as -1
P

 , where P  is the number of the 463 

total levels of each attribute. For the significance of the values, we employed the [55] the 464 

method for 1000 random repetitions. The results are displayed in Table 4. 465

4.4. The WTP of the attributes and levels 470 

The relative importance of the attributes and levels are displayed in Table 5. The 471 

results indicated that for sample 1, the most important attribute was the ‗location of the petrol 472 

station‘ followed by the ‗type of diesel‘ and the ―type of the petrol station‖. For sample 2, the 473 

respondents demonstrated the same preferences pattern. However, as expected, they 474 

exhibited the highest relative importance for ―bread price‖. These values were used for the 475 

decomposition of the WTP of the preferred scenarios into the WTPs of the attributes and 476 

levels. As observed, the participants from the first sample demonstrated a willingness to pay 477 

0.81€ for the location of the petrol station, 0.37€ for the type of diesel and a non-significant 478 

0.02€ for the type of petrol station. The participants from sample 2 demonstrated the highest 479 



17 
 

WTP for the attribute ―bread price‖ (0.79€) followed by the location (0.22€), type of diesel 480 

(0.15€) and finally the type of the petrol station (0.12€). 481

In a subsequent step, the previous WTP values attached to the attributes (i.e. 
k

WTP ) 487 

were decomposed into the WTPs of their levels. The procedure and the results are exhibited 488 

in Table 6. In both samples, participants were willing to pay 0.018€ and 0.116€ for the local 489 

petrol station. The respondents also demonstrated a WTP of 0.37€ and 0.106€ for 490 

conventional diesel. However, they were not willing to pay a premium for biodiesel and for 491 

the different proposed mixture. One of the main factor for such rejection is that car 492 

manufacturers do not recommend its use as it may negatively affect the energy efficiency 493 

and may cause engine failure [56]. For the location of the petrol station, diesel car users 494 

exhibited a WTP of 0.808€ and 0.223€ if the petrol station is located in their habitual route, 495 

being the most important level in the first sample. Finally, as expected for the attribute of 496 

bread price, the respondents were willing to pay 0.710€ to keep it unchanged (i.e., a 0% 497 

increase), being the most important level. 498

5. Conclusions 503 

In this study, we assessed the consumer preferences toward biodiesel in the transport 504 

sector in Catalonia Spain. The results demonstrated that the Spanish users/owners of diesel 505 

cars are not willing to pay for biodiesel, which seems to be rejected in all the mixtures 506 

proposed; this result is contrary to the results obtained by [6], who confirmed that consumers 507 

are willing to pay 0.08 Euros/litre and [41] who determined that Spanish users of diesel are 508 

willing to pay up to 5% over the price of standard diesel.  509 

The data indicated that in Spain, few manufacturers of cars currently accept the use of 510 

more than B5, while others do not recommend any level of biodiesel to refuel. Vehicle 511 

owners are asked therefore to check the recommendations of the vehicle manufacturer 512 

before using biodiesel, particularly if the vehicle is covered by a new vehicle warranty. For 513 

instance, Toyota, Mercedes Benz and BMW (with the exception of Germany) among other 514 

brands do not recommend the use of biodiesel in their engines. Biodiesel requires certain 515 

changes in the engine, such as the use of synthetic plastics. Thus, the term ―non-516 

recommended‖ indicates that any amount of biodiesel can damage the engine, and the 517 

owner may lose the car warranty. However, other brands (for instance, Audi, Ford, Honda, 518 

Seat…) allow the use of a maximum of 5% of the mixture of biodiesel in their engines. 519 

Although all of the respondents were familiar with the existence of biodiesel, they 520 

exhibited a lack of information about its production and its situation in Spain at the moment. 521 

They did not consider biodiesel as a clear environmentally friendly alternative energy in the 522 

transport sector, and thus more studies are needed in the future. Another significant 523 

limitation is the lack of biodiesel availability due to its low market share. At present, there are 524 

only 204 petrol stations that offer biodiesel in Spain, which represents a very small portion 525 

(approximately 2%) of the total number of petrol stations. 526 

At the methodological level, our approach demonstrated the capacity to decompose the 527 

WTP associated with any scenario into the WTPs of its attributes and levels using the 528 

relative importance estimated from the CE. However, this approach needs to be validated 529 

and compared with the traditional CE, and it is necessary to test the consistency of the 530 

results obtained. This point is beyond our objective and will be assessed in future research. 531
