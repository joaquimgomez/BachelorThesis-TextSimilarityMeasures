Abstract 

Technology plays an important role in the classroom as unavoidable tools supposed to help teachers 
in developing their activities. By Technology we refer to the capabilities, given by the practical 
application of knowledge, in carrying out their subjects a) more efficiently, b) more precisely and c) 
more thoroughly. In this work, students’ acceptance for the “voice correction” tools in evaluating their 
works was analyzed. In this context, this new tool has been compared to a) the “traditional” correction 
method of printed document and c) the “track change” tool of text processors. A structured 
questionnaire was designed and answered by 57 students of the agricultural technical engineering 
career using the web 2.0 application of “Google Form”. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is 
used to assess students’ relative preference for the above-mentioned three correction tools. We used 
a pair wise comparison approach where in a first step the students had to indicate which of the two 
correction tools prefers. Then a nine point scale is used to measure the strength of this preference by 
means of verbal judgments using a 9 point scale. Results show a high preference toward the “voice” 
correction tool obtaining a 42.02% of relative preference, followed by the “track change” with 33.02% 
and the traditional printed document by 24.95%. To complement our research, “technical difficulty” 
faced by student in using the voice correction tool have been analyzed by a Logit regression. Results 
show that male students with low average qualification who do not have smartphone with internet 
connection are prone to face difficulties in using this technology.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

Information and communication technology (ICT) is changing modes of learning, collaboration and 
expression [1]. In teaching their basic role is to help teachers to improve the development of their 
subjects in an efficient and precise way. In this context, a radical rethinking of the use of the 
technology in education by teachers is needed as a mean of a continuous improvement of the 
transmitted information for students [2]. Among this technology, the Web 2.0 tools are of great help in 
developing educational activities and a way to involve student in different task. From the different 
resources on the web, we highlights the relevant tools used for presentations (Mindomo for mental 
maps, Prezi, etc.), for collaborating (Google applications such as documents, calendar, and sites, 
etc.), for storage and sharing (Dropbox and syncplycity, etc.) and for participation (Blogs, Wikipedia, 
etc.). Amongst these applications we comment the Voxopop tool presented as a voice based e- 
learning approach. It is rely on message boards but using voice rather than text. The obtained 
recorded voices files can be shared between individuals in three ways: public, semi-private (do need 
an account) and private (need voxpop account). However, this application suffers from the restriction 
of including audio files in other soft wares such as the text processors. 

The idea behind this work is to use teacher recorded voice in the task of correcting documents. This 
may allow a better explanation of knowledge in a more efficient way. In this line, a text processor is 
needed that allow inserting voice within the document. To my knowledge, there are no web 2.0 tools 
that may facilitate this requirement. For instance, the Google Docs tool does not allow (yet) introducing 
voice within its text processor. However, some free software such as the Open Office allow for it. 
Moreover, the word office software allows introducing audio file or recorded voice within the text of a 
document. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to analyze students’ acceptance for the “audio or 



voice correction” tools in evaluating their works by introducing the teachers voice with the text. In 
addition, we seek to compare this correction tool with the “traditional” correction method of printed 
document and with the “track change” tool of text processor. We have decided to use the office word 
text processor as it is the used in our university and to be the only available in students’ computers. 
However, as commented, the open office software can do also the some function. 

2 METHODOLOGY 

As mentioned before, the main objective of this study is to analyze the students' acceptance of a new 
correction tool. To achieve this aim, two specific objectives have been identified. The first one focus on 
analyzing the “relative importance” of the “voice tool” compared to the “traditional correction” one 
(writing on printed document) and to the “track change tool” of a text processor. The second objective 
tries to analyze factors affecting the perception of difficulties that students faced in using it. To reach 
the objectives different techniques have been proposed. Table 1 summarizes the applied methods.

2.1 The Analytical Hierarchy Process- AHP 

The AHP is a mathematical technique for multi-criteria decision-supporting method in discrete 
environments ([3] and [4]). It enables decision makers in their planning, setting priorities, selecting the 
best product among a set of them, and allocating resources. It aims to decompose a complex decision 
problem in a hierarchy of smaller constituent sub-problems. Thus, determining the individually most 
preferred alternative from a set of elements is a decision problem where the hierarchy top level 
represents the individual elements (Figure 1). 

 

Figure 1: Hierarchy of elements 

In order to implement the AHP, alternatives should be compared in order to set the best and preferred 
one. Thus, one needs to carry out a survey where individuals are asked to make a pairwise 
comparison between elements. First, the respondent has to indicate which of the two elements the 
respondent prefers. Then a nine point scale is used to measure the strength of this preference by 
means of verbal judgments as can be seen in Table 2.

From the answers provided, a matrix with the following structure is generated for each individual k and 
is known as the Saaty matrix:

where aijk represents the value obtained from the pairwise comparison between element i (iN / iP) 
and element j; (jN / jP) for each individual k. The fundamental properties of this comparison matrix 
are: a) reciprocal comparison: if aijk=x then ajik=1/x); b) homogeneity: if element i and j are judged to be 
of equal relative importance then, aijk = ajik = 1; and c) all the elements of its main diagonal take a 
value of one (aiik=1  i). 

If perfect consistency in preferences holds for each decision-maker, it should also hold that aihk  ahjk = 
aijk for all i, j and h (hN / hP). This condition implies that values given for pairwise comparisons 
represent weights given to each element by a perfectly rational decision-maker aijk= wik/wjk for all i and 
j. Therefore, the Saaty matrix can also be expressed as follows:

Under such circumstances, K weights (wNk) for each element (N) can be easily determined from the 
N(N-1)/2 values for aijk. However, perfect consistency is seldom present in reality, where personal 
subjectivity plays an important role in the pairwise comparison. Thus in the case of perfect consistency 
it should hold that: Sk×W=N×W (for elements) where W =(w1, w2, …, wN). However, in Saaty matrixes 
(Sk=aijk) some degree of inconsistency is present. Therefore, Saaty proposed the redefinition:  

Sk×W=max×W, where max is the maximum eigenvalue of matrix Sk which is determined by: 

 

max ijk ik
i j

a w   
   (3) 

Saaty proved that max ≥ N (element) enables one to test the degree of inconsistency in respondent 
ratings. Thus the quantity max – N measures the degree of inconsistency within the Sk. In this context, 
Saaty proposes the Consistency Index (CI): 

 

   (4) 



[2] defined the Consistency Ratio as CR=CI/RI where RI is a Random Index which denotes the CI for 
a randomly generated Sk matrix as can be seen in Table 3. Values of CR ≤ 0.1 are acceptable and 
higher value respondents are asked to revise their pairwise comparison 

Table 3: RI values

RI 0,00 0,00 0,58 0,90 1,12 1,24 1,32 1,41 1,45 1,49 

 

In Saaty matrices where some degree of inconsistency is present, alternative approaches have been 
proposed to estimate the weight vector that is better able to represent the decision-maker’s real weight 
vector. [3] and [5] proposed two options as the accurate estimate of real weights: the geometric mean 
and the main eigenvector. Other authors have proposed alternatives based on regression analysis 
([6]) or goal programming ([7]). As all criteria meet the requirements to estimate the above-mentioned 
weights, we choose the geometric mean ([8] and [9]). Using this approach, weights assigned by 
subject to each attribute and level are obtained using the following expression: 

max ijk ik
i j

a w        (5) 

AHP was originally conceived for individual decision-making, but was rapidly extended as a valid 
technique for the analysis of group decisions ([10]). We aggregate corresponding individual weights 
(wik) across subjects to obtain a synthesis of weights for each element (wi). The geometric mean can 
be used in the aggregation process for the whole sample ([11]) as follows:

2.2 The Logistic regression 

The purpose of the logistic regression is to obtain a multiple regression model with the following 
characteristics: 

a) The response variable (Y) is discrete, usually binary: true (1) or false (0). 

b) The explanatory variables can be both quantitative and categorical. 

c) The starting model is not linear but exponential, but with the logit transformation is represented as 
linear. 

Logit models are a basic tool for analyzing problems of different kinds. In this sense, it highlights their 
use in biomedical studies (especially studies answer yes / no treatment). In this line, the acceptance 
(1) or not (0) of the students of the voice correction tool fits perfectly in the same regression models. 
For this reason the logistic model has been considered in this paper to analyze this response variable 
(Y). 

The Logistic regression tries to express the probability pi to accept the voice correction tool according 
to the following exponential model: 



This model is called logistic distribution, where  ki2i1ii X...,,X,X1,'x   represents the profile of cases i 
in the explanatory variables Xj and  k10 ...,,,'    is the vector of coefficients to be estimated 
through the regression. 

If we make the ratio of the odds that a student accepts or not the voice tool, i.e. the number of times it 
is more likely that a student with particular characteristics accept or not the proposed correction tool, it 
would be easy to obtain that: 





ln      (10) 

is called logit transformation of pi. 

Thus, logistic regression models the logit of the probability of occurrence of a success in the response 
variable (Y = 1, i.e. the acceptance of the voice tools) as a linear function of the explanatory variables. 
In this same context, it is relevant to mention that the linear logistic function given by

kik2i21i10 X...XX   , does not provide the probability (pi) to accept the new tool of 
correction, but its logit, i. e., the logarithm of the number of times that a student with a characteristics 
 ki2i1i ,...,XX,X   is more likely to accept the tool in front of not accepting it. 

In the logistic equation, as in any linear model, the coefficients I are interpreted as the change 
(increase or decrease) of the response variable (logit of pi) that could cause a unit increase in the 
explanatory variable Xi.. A clearer interpretation would be obtained by taking exponential for the 
elimination of the logit transformation. So we get the so-called odds ratio (OR). Thus, the OR of the ith 
explanatory variable is defined as: 

ieORi
     (11) 

In this case, it is easy to check that the odds ratio expresses the change that originates in the quotient

3 THE EMPIRICAL APPLICATION 

The data used in this analysis was obtained from a survey using a structured questionnaire in classes 
with students. We used the Google Form option to ensure students anonymity allowing them to 
comment freely their opinions and concerns. The questionnaires were carried out during April 2011. 
Each questionnaire solicits information on student’s characteristics and their opinion toward the 
different correction tools. The final sample consists of 57 students of agro-food market subject in their 
second year of the agricultural engineering grade.1. 

It is worth mentioning that before carrying out the survey, students have already experiment the voice 
correction tools as it was used to correct some document in a work group’s task. To insert a voice 
comment, only we need a microphone and earphones. The process starts by inserting an object (from 
the insert menu) and continue by selecting the option of voice file. In a subsequent step, we choose 
the “new file” option and we start to record our voice comment within the document for one minute as 
limiting time for each inserted audio file.

3.1 The AHP Application 

For the AHP application a pair wise comparison exercise is needed in order to obtain judgments that 
estimate the relative importance for each alternative at individual level (student) as well at the whole 
sample. The pair wise comparison used in our questionnaire can be shown in Table 4.

In your opinion, what is the most important element that determines your preference for rabbit 
meat? Indicate the degree of superiority of the preferred element. In case of equality of items, 
select the option "1". 

3.2 The Logistic regression application 

For the logistic regression, the dependent variable (y) used was the technical difficulty that faced 
student in using the "voice correction" tool. This variable was initially created using an 11 point Likert 
scale (from 0 to 10) where 0 is “did not face any technical difficulty” and 10 is “I face several technical 
difficulties”. In order to adapt this scale for a logistic regression, we have created a dummy variable 
that take the value of “0” if for the scale value from 0 to 5 (26.3% of the responses) and take the value 
of “1” if the scale value is from 6 to 10 (73.7% of the responses).  

The explanatory variables proposed for the realization of the logistic model were:  

 IDEA: What did you think of the idea of correcting a survey through an voice option? 
 GEND: Gender of the student 
 LAP: Do you have a laptop? 
 PC: Do you have a desktop computer? 
 SMRT: Do you have a smartphone or similar with Internet connection? 
 AVRG: What is the average grade you usually get in the courses? 

The inclusion of these variables has been done using the stepwise selection method. Thus, the 
proposed model is: Y = f (ID, GEND, LAP, PC, SMRT, AVRG). More specifically, the mathematical 
expression to be adjusted with the logistic regression is:

4 RESULTS 

Results demonstrate that the idea of the voice correction has been positively perceived by students 
with an average valuation of (8.58). However, they stated that they faced technical difficulty in hearing 
the corrections (7.04). This is because some of the desktop computers in the University (for Students) 
do not contain “sound card hardware” and therefore it was impossible for students to realise this task 
in the University since the task requires the presence of all the member of the group. In addition, using 
their personal computer was also in some cases difficult as they need to use in a public space. In this 
context students were asked to mention 3 main advantages and three main disadvantages of the 
“voice correction”. Results are summarized in the Table 5. 

 
  



Table 5: Advantages and disadvantages of the “voice correction tool” as stated by students 

Disadvantages Advantages 

 You cannot get a piece of the recording, but 
you have to hear all of it. 

 Obligation to have headphones or speakers. 
 If you're in a public place and do not have 

headphones, you can annoy other people. 
 Could not stop the recording. 
 File Size. 
 In some cases you should write corrections 

on a paper if are numerous. 
 is less comfortable 
 Problems in compatibility of versions for the 

text processor. 

 The corrections are clearer. 
 It is a quick and easy way to understand what 

should be corrected. 
 You can edit the document while listening to 

the voice. 
 It is Fast, clear and concise. 
 It is a useful and innovative method. 
 You do not need to print the corrections. 
 You have always the corrections for the 

future. 
 It is a more ecological method. 
 Allows the teacher to better express his 

ideas. 
 It is closer to student. It's more like a face to 

face correction. 
 Allow for much information in little time. 

4.1 Results of AHP 

Results allow us to identify the relative importance of the three alternatives of corrections. Figure 2 
shows a graphical illustration of the obtained weights. 

As can be seen, the proposed “voice correction” tool was the most preferred for students with a weight 
of 42.02% compared to the other alternatives (24.95% for the traditional correction and 33.023% for 
the track change). This result confirms the acceptance that receives the voice correction tool as a new 
method adapted to student’s concerns. They stated that their preference is toward tools that allow 
them to feel closer to teacher and obtain concise and better information in correction within a few part 
of time.

4.2 Results of the Logistic regression 

In analyzing the factors that affect technical difficulties faced by students when using the voice 
correction, results of the logistic regression are shown in Table 6.

The model was significant for gender (GEND), having or not a smart phone with internet connection 
(SMRT) and the average grades of the course (AVRG). Wald test for these variables is significant (p 
less than 0.1) indicate that these coefficients are statistically different from zero and justify a significant 
contribution to the model. Before the interpretation of results it is important to keep in mind the 
interpretation of the Odds Ratio coefficient (OR). We should distinguish between an OR greater than 
one and less than unity. In the first case, an OR> 1 implies that an increase in the explanatory variable 
leads to an increase in the probability of Y = 1 (presence of technical difficulty in using voice 
correction) and OR < 1 explains the opposite behaviour, i.e. the greater the value of the independent 
variable, the lower is the probability of occurrence of the dependent variable Y = 1. 

Results show an OR = 3.927 for the gender variable (GEND) showing that the probability that male 
students face technical difficulties increase in front of females by 3.927 times. In this same line, 
student with smart phone and internet connection (SMRT) show that are more likely to face problems 
in using the voice correction than the other students by 3.655 times. This result seems to be 
unexpected as we assume that more “technological” students are able to find less technical difficulties. 
However, this could be explained by the fact that these student are used to use the smart phones as a  
normal way to be connected to internet, to hear music, to chat and to check e mails rather than the 
traditional use of computers. Finally, for the AVRG variable with an OR =0.289 <1 we can state that for 
a 1 point increase in the results of the students, the probability that the student face technical problem 
in using the voice correction decreases 0.289 times. This confirms that more successful students are 
prone to face less technical problems. 

5 CONCLUSIONS 

This paper focuses on assessing and comparing student’s preferences, using the AHP, for different 
alternative of correction documents. On the basis of a nine-point scale pair wise comparison, we 
obtained the relative importance (weights) of the analysed alternatives. Moreover, we use the logit 
regression model to analyse factors affecting technical difficulty in using the voice correction. Data 
was collected from 57 students of agro-food market subject in their second year of the agricultural 
engineering grade during April 2011. 

Results Show a high acceptance of the voice correction method. It seems to be an efficient way of 
work taking into consideration the quantity and quality of the information transmitted to students in few 
minutes in comparison to writing or typing corrections. However, improvements are needed of such 
procedure in order to allow the edition and the time control of the generated audio file. This is because 
the audio file should be heard entirely even if you need to hear only the last part of the voice comment. 
It is worth mentioning that it is essential that the university computers for students to be compatible 
with playing voice with the presence of earphone. The voice correction tools support the need of such 
investment with the PC rooms in the ESAB (Agricultural School of Barcelona) school where the study 
have be done.
