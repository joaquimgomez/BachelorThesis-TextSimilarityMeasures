Factors Explaining the Consumers' Willingness-to-Pay for a “Typical" 

Food Product in Spain: Evidence from Experimental Auctions 

1. Introduction 

The so-called "typical" food products have occupied a preferential place within the agro-

food sector because their particular identity is supported by the quality and origin of its raw 

materials, as well as the peculiarity of the production method used. "Typical" food products may 

be referred to both non-processed and processed products. Within the former, the level of quality 

and differentiation has been determined either by the land's natural characteristics and/or climatic 

conditions or by the particular farming systems. Yet, for the initially processed products, the 

typicality results from the posterior production method, permitting the raw materials to be 

autochthonous or imported from other areas (Caldentey and Gomez, 1996). According to 

Letablier and Nicolas (1994), the typicality of a food product seems to be highly linked to its 

territory of origin. Probably, this close link between typicality and territory explains why 

"typical" food products are usually referred as Origin Labeled Products (OLPs) even when there 

is no specific legal instrument protecting their name. Within food quality policy, the European 

Union has recently strengthened its action to protect OLPs, in particular through EC Regulation 

2081/92, by introducing Protected Designations of Origin (PDOs) and Protected Geographical 

Indications (PGIs) as two legal instruments for protection. 

In Spain, at the end of 2005, 138 PDOs and PGIs were officially registered (excluding 

wines), from which 17 (12%) were located in Catalonia (North-East of Spain, being Barcelona 

the main town) (MAPA, 2005). Each year new "typical" products request being recognized as 

PDO or PGI One of these products is "Mongeta Ganxet". "Mongeta" means white bean 



 3 

(Leguminous) and "Ganxet" is the name of traditional variety cultivate in the countries of Valles 

and Maresme (around 50 Km away from the Barcelona Metropolitan area, the main consumption 

market). 

In spite of the intensive research that has been undertaken to recover this variety as well as its 

organoleptic characteristics and to allow a controlled production system, there is a necessity to 

obtain additional information regarding the real productive situation (providing the possibility to 

learn about the existing competition in the market) and foremost, regarding the market potential for 

such a variety. 

This paper aims at analyzing the market potential of the "Mongeta Ganxet" (MG) in 

Barcelona. The measurement of the market potential is approached by calculating, through an 

experimental auction, the consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) a price premium for this variety 

over the conventional counterpart. Unlike other hypothetical valuation methods, such as the 

contingent valuation, where the surveyed person tends to overestimate the valuation of the 

product; experimental auctions try to simulate a real market situation by offering the participants 

real products and allowing an exchange of real money. In this way, the participant may incur in 

real costs if he or she deviates from his or her equilibrium strategy. In our work, we used the 

random nth price auction as an auction mechanism to measure the participants' WTP for the 

MG
1
. This paper also seeks to better understand the consumers' making decision process by 

estimating a model to explain main determinants of the calculated WTP. 

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it is one of the first attempts in Spain to use 

experimental auctions to elicit the WTP for a food product
2
. Second, although from a 

methodological point of view this paper applies established methods in the experimental protocol 

(the random nth price auction, the introduction of referenced prices and the release of additional

information during the experiment, including tasting), up to our knowledge, it is the only one 

which combines the three elements. Finally, this paper is unique in the analysis of the 

experimental data in the sense it provides a modelling framework to determine main factors 

affecting the consumers' WTP. 

2. Design and implementation of the experimental auction 

2.1 Sample, auctioned good and questionnaire 

 To achieve the experiment, we surveyed a random sample of people from Barcelona and its 

metropolitan area who were responsible for food shopping in their household. In total, 90 

participants carried out the experiment during July 2006. The auctioned good was one kilogram of 

the variety 'Ganxet' white bean, stored in a cloth bag. Before auctioning the product, 

participants were requested to fill in a questionnaire food consumption habits and regarding 

various aspects related to white beans and, specifically, to the 'Mongeta Ganxet'. 

2.2. Auction Mechanism 

In practice, the random nth price auction works as follows: each one of the participants 

offers a bid for the auctioned product. Then the auctioneer orders the bids from highest to lowest 

and selects randomly a number n from a uniform distribution between 2 and k (k participants). 

The n-1 highest bidders are declared winners of the auction and the auctioneer sells them one unit of 

the auctioned good at the nth price. For example if n = 4, the three highest bidders each will buy 

one unit of the auctioned good priced at the fourth highest bid (Shogren, 2001). 

2.3. Experimental Treatments 

An additional goal from the experiment consisted in analyzing the sensitivity of the price 

premium participants were willing-to-pay for the Mongeta Ganxet under different marketing 



 5 

strategies. Two main effects have been tested: 1) the potential presence of prices from substitute 

products (as a proxy of a real purchase situation); and 2) the provision of additional information 

about the auctioned product during the experiment. With respect to the first effect, besides the 

priceless product to be auctioned, three different levels of information were provided: 1a) retail 

prices of conventional white beans; 1b) retail prices of both conventional and high value (PDO) 

white beans; 1c) control level: no information on prices. Regarding the second effect, again three 

levels of information were provided to participants: 2a) a promotional leaflet, informing about the 

organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of the product, as well as recipes of some typical 

plates based on the 'Mongeta Ganxet'; 2b) product taste (cooked with salt and seasoned 

exclusively with olive oil); and 2c) control level: no information. Table 1 shows the nine 

experimental treatments (sessions) derived from the combination of levels of the two effects 

considered (roughly 10 participants per treatment).

2.4. Steps followed in the Experiment 

The process to obtain the relevant information in this study consists of four steps. In step 1 

and after taking a seat and given a welcome, each participant received an envelope which 

contained 15 Euros as compensation for their participation, his or her number of identification, ten 

bidding cards and a questionnaire which have to be completed before the beginning of the 

experiment. In step 2, the operating procedure of the random nth price auction was described 

orally. Afterwards, a practical example was carried out with the auction of a 330 ml. bottle of 

water, during three rounds. In step 3, participants were requested to come close to a table where a 

few units of 'Mongeta Ganxet' were placed along with or without other brands of priced-white 

beans, depending on the treatment. Participants were then provided an opportunity to closely 

examine the auctioned product. Once all participants had finished inspecting the product, each 

one had to report how much he or she would be willing-to-pay for the offered product. After the 

first round was finished, the bidding cards were collected and ordered, n was randomly selected 

from a uniform distribution and the winner(s) was (were) announced. The same process was 

repeated during three additional rounds. In step 4, the auction was interrupted after the fourth 

round, when the additional information was granted, and consequently the next four rounds were 

made till completing a total of eight rounds. At the end of the eight rounds, one round was chosen 

randomly to determine the winner(s). The winner(s) of such round was (were) appointed as the 

winner(s) of the auction. Once the results were announced, the experiment ended by handing the 

product to the winner(s) who had to pay the corresponding market-clearing price. 

 

3. Results 

3.1. Willingness-to-pay for the Mongeta Ganxet 

Figure 1 shows the distribution of frequencies of the average bids made by the participants 

during the last four rounds in order to make homogeneous comparisons among treatments. As 

mentioned in the previous section, the additional information about the auctioned product was 



 7 

provided at the end of the fourth round; thus, taking into consideration the last four rounds will 

enable us also to compare the effects of the introduction of such information.

Considering that the average market price for the conventional white bean 1.85€, results 

from Figure 1 suggest that 58% of the participants are not willing-to- pay an extra price for the 

MG. A 35% of participants are willing-to-pay a price between 3 and 6 Euros/kg. This price 

range is higher than the price for the conventional product but it is below the price for the white 

bean 'Ganxet' at bulk paid directly to the producer or in local markets, which is around 6 

Euros/kg. In general terms, it is a segment of consumers heterogeneously mixed between young 

and elder persons, frequent buyers of white beans (70%), and occasional consumers of MG. The 

majority is employee and 85% earns an average salary between 1,000 and 2,000 Euros. Taking 

also into account the results from the questionnaire, this segment is willing to sacrifice additional 

money if the product provides them higher quality. In fact, participants in this segment assign (in a 

scale from 0 to 10) an average score of 8.70 to the phrase: "I'll pay more if the product has a 

guaranteed quality" and 7.85 to the phrase: "I don't mind paying more if the product has more 

quality". 



 8 

Only 7% of the participants are willing-to-pay between 6 and 9 Euros for the MG. In 

other word this is the real market potential for the auctioned product as the price premium is over the 

minimum market price you may purchase the MG directly to the producer or usually in the local 

market, at bulk
3
. All members in this segment are regular consumers of MG. Around 50% are 

between 35 and 49 years old and have a university degree. All are employees and have monthly 

earnings between 2,000 and 3,000 Euros. At the same time, these are the consumers that allocate a 

higher valuation (in a scale from 0 to 10) to the phrases: " I'll pay more if the product has a 

guaranteed quality" and "I don't mind paying more if the product has more quality" (9 and 8.25, 

respectively). The previous experience (score of 9.67), the product creaminess (9.50) and the 

texture of the skin (8.75) are the principal attributes influencing their decision to purchase the 

Mongeta Ganxet white bean. 

 

3.2. Effect of the presence of reference prices in the willingness-to-pay for the MG 

As can be observed in Table 2, the presence of PDO priced-substitutes increases 

significantly participants' valuation of the 'Mongeta Ganxet'; the average price that participants are 

willing-to-pay when prices for PDO white beans are provided is significantly higher than in 

the other two cases. Second, it seems not to be any significant difference when providing only 

prices of conventional white beans and providing no information on prices (the average WTP is 

2.86 and 2.76 Euros for cases without providing reference prices and providing only conventional 

products' reference prices, respectively).

 In any case, no participant manifested paying the real market price for the auctioned product in a cloth bag, which was 

11.60 Euros/kg.

3.3. Effect of the provision of additional information about GM characteristics  

 The second effect we were interested in was the provision to participants during the auction 

of additional information regarding the characteristics of the Mongeta Ganxet. As can be 

observed in the Figure 2, providing information about the organoleptic, nutritional and 

gastronomical characteristics of the MG, seems to not have any effect on consumer willingness to 

pay for the MG. This result is statistically confirmed by the information shown in Table 3 that 

provides the comparison of the average bids made by participants in the first four rounds and in the 

last four rounds under the three scenarios considered. As we can be observed there are no 

significant differences in mean values and therefore neither the leaflet information nor the taste 

have effect on the WTP for the MG. This result can be explained by the learning effect which 

seems to offset the effect of releasing new information. The learning effect has been deeply 

analyzed in Shogren et al. (1994) and Shogren et al. (2000) who showed that as the rounds go on 

participants tend to decrease significantly their bids.

3.4 Factors affecting the willingness-to-pay for the Mongeta Ganxet 

As we mentioned in the introduction, in this study we are not only interested in knowing 

the willingness-to-pay a price premium for the MG, but also in analyzing main factors affecting 

such decision. In this study, the price premium is measured as the difference (denoted by "y") 

between the average bids of each individual in the last four rounds and the average price of the 

conventional brands of white beans used in the experiment
4
. If the difference lies between the 

average and one positive or negative standard deviation we have assumed that the willingness-to-pay 

is zero. In our case, only 13% of the average bids were not statistically different from the average 

price of the conventional white beans. 

The price premium presents two important characteristics: it is censored at 0 and the decision 

with respect to the price premium each individual is willing-to-pay may be preceded by a decision 



 11 

to pay or not to pay, an extra price. Therefore, a bivariate “Sample Selection” model fits adequately 

for the purpose of this study. The Sample Selection model is defined as the following:

Results from the estimated Sample Selection model are shown in Table 4. In the decision 

whether to pay or not to pay a price premium (first equation), among the socio-demographic 

variables, only employment and the education level affect significantly the probability of paying an 

over price for the MG. In the case of the education level (EDUCAT), the negative sign of the 

parameter indicates that as the participant has a higher education level his or her probability to pay a 

price premium for the MG decreases. This result has to be interpreted taking into account the nature 

of the auctioned product. The auctioned white beans require a minimum of two hours cooking. 

Participants with higher education level have less free time to cooking and, then, convenience 



 12 

becomes a relevant attribute
4
. As a consequence, those participants have a lower probability to enter 

in the market which would explain the negative sign found from our estimated model. Regarding 

the employment effect (PROFESS), the positive sign of the parameter shows that participants who 

are self-employed or employees have a higher probability of entering the market of the ‘Mongeta 

Ganxet’ in comparison to the other labour categories.  

As expected, the consumption level of white beans (CONSUMP) (the low knowledge about 

the auctioned product (LOWKNOW)) affects positively (negatively) the probability to pay a price 

premium for it. In fact, as shown in Table 4, those participants that have declared in the survey a 

higher consumption level of white beans, have more probability to pay a higher price premium. At 

the same time, those participants that have shown a higher level of knowledge about the MG 

present a higher probability of paying a higher price for such product. This result suggests the need 

to provide more and better addressed information regarding the product from producers to 

consumers with the aim of increasing the market potential for MG. In this sense, quite recently mass 

media in Barcelona has started to pay attention to current research aimed at improving the 

organoleptic characteristics of the MG. 

Among 'Mongeta Ganxet' attributes, two have resulted in having a significant effect on the 

probability of participants' willingness-to-pay a price premium. The first one is price 

(HIGPRICE). The negative sign indicates, as expected, that when the price of the product plays a 

key role in the consumer decision process the probability of paying an extra price for the MG 

decreases, as this variety is relatively more expensive that other substitutes. The second relevant 

attribute is "convenience" (TIME), which has a negative effect over the probability of participants' 

WTP. In other words, the participants who highly value cooking time when purchasing white 

beans are less likely to buy the MG, as it requires more care cooking that the conventional 

counterpart. 

                                                 
4
 Results obtained from both a preliminary focus group and the implementation of the pilot questionnaire indicated that 

among the different attributes consumers look for when purchasing white beans, respondents with higher education 

level ranked convenience among the highest valued attributes. 



 13 

Table 4. Estimated parameter of the Sample Selection model 

 

Previous experience (EXP) also plays a relevant role in purchasing decision. In this sense, 

participants that have given a higher score to this attribute are more likely to pay a price premium for 

the Mongeta Ganxet. Finally, among the four attitudinal variables that have been introduced 

initially in the model, only the variable "willingness-to-pay more for higher quality food" (F21) has 

a significant effect. The positive sign indicates that participants, who are willing to sacrifice money 

in exchange of an improvement in the quality of the food, are also more likely to pay more for the 

'Mongeta Ganxet'. 

Once the consumer has decided to pay an extra price for the MG, the second decision is to 

determine how much to pay with respect to the conventional product. The results obtained in the 

estimation of the model show that this decision is solely based on the participants' experience with 

Mongeta Ganxet (FREQMG). That is, after deciding to participate in the market, only the fact of 

being a usual or an occasional consumer is the main determinant of the price premium he or she 

is willing to pay. The positive sign of the parameter indicates that the more experience the 

consumer has (usually but not only associated to a better knowledge of market prices, as

4. Concluding remarks 

This study has aimed at analyzing, on one hand, the market potential of MG in the 

metropolitan area of Barcelona and, on the other, main determinant factors affecting such 

decision. Results suggest a number of points. First, the market for "Mongeta Ganxet" is still 

narrow out of the local production area. Despite the majority of the participants acknowledging the 

organoleptic quality of the MG, only 7% of participants would be willing to pay a price superior 

to the minimum price for which the MG may be purchased directly to the producer or in the local 

producing market and none of the participants was willing-to-pay the real market price of the 

auctioned product. 

Our results from the analysis of the main factors explaining consumers' purchasing 

intentions are quite consistent with those found in the empirical literature regarding the 

consumption of high value-added products but also we have found some interesting results which are 

product specific. As in previous studies, the psychographic characteristics of the participants are 

more relevant than their economic characteristics when making food choices. Moreover, as 

expected, the likelihood of purchasing the product increases with experience and with a positive 

attitude to pay more for higher quality products. Finally, results indicate that a better knowledge 

about the product and a larger previous experience in the consumption of MG increase the 

probability of paying a price premium for such product. 

However, some results have to be with the nature of the product itself and, to certain extent, are 

opposite to those found in previous similar studies as the price and convenience attributes affect 

negatively the probability of entering into the market of MG. In relation to the later attribute, 

while in most studies convenience plays a positive role (or, at the worst, no significant role) in 



 15 

explaining the WTP for a high-value food product, in this study the relationship is negative, as 

the cooking time for such a product is around two hours and needs periodic inspection. In 

relation to the price, conventional white beans are a relatively cheap product and an important 

source of energy. While in most studies prices of high-valued food products lie between one or 

two time the price of the conventional counterparts, in this case, MG is around seven times more 

expensive than the price of the conventional white beans. In this context, communication and 

promotion strategies should be very careful in explaining the reasons behind price differentials and, 

second, some further research is needed to improve the convenience attribute as this will limit its 

market potential for an increasing share of the population.
